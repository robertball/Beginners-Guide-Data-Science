these cookies were delicious! the best recipe i've found for this type so far... if you make a small change.. i agree with the other reviewers about the salt. i added only 1/4tsp to the dough and they were perfect. i especially like that this recipe calls for pwd sugar instead of white sugar in the dough. i think that it made the cookie extra melt-in-your-mouth. i also used ground pecans instead of almonds, that's the way i like best. a hint for rolling them in the sugar after they bake...
roll once when the cookie is still hot and again when it is completely cool. YUM!

I took everyone's feedback here on the first try and used salted butter with no more salt added (surely the amount shown is a typo?). I also decided that with the almonds and the heavy dose of vanilla called for in this recipe that I would make either true "almond crescents," which is a popular cookie, or true wedding cookies. So, I used only 1 tsp. of vanilla and 3 tsp. almond extract.  I could not grind the almonds finely enough, however,so the texture of the final result was a bit too rubbery and bumpy with almond bits easily noticeable and getting stuck in teeth (at least mine), but this was probably my own fault. I'm sure that finely ground almonds would have enhanced my results (can you buy finely ground almonds? I cannot imagine grinding these by hand or machine such that they would truly be fine enough...the almond is very moist).

The flavor of these cookies was marvelous! Everyone liked them. Since I bake cookies almost exclusively as my Christmas gifts, I appreciated the larger quanitity produced from this recipe than most others I see. 

So,a hit for this year means a tradition next year. 

Think I'll try them with ONLY the vanilla and pecans next Christmas (in addition to the almond crescents again). Thanks for a nice recipe.

I made 1/3 of this recipe and got about 15 cookies.  I used about a pinch of salt.  everytime Ive had wedding cookies (store-bought) I thought they were too salty. even with all the sugar though, I dont think they need that much.
Anyway, after I finished rolling these cookies in the sugar, I realized that I left out the ground almonds.  Luckily, I used almond extract along with the vanilla and it still tasted PERFECT, you couldn't even notice it was missing it.  I ended up sprinkling the ground almonds on top, over the sugar.    
Also, I found it easiest to coat the cookies in a deep bowl, filled with the sugar, using a spoon.  If you use your fingers (and the cookies are still warm), it will stick and come off the cookie.

This is a delicious recipe. As I'm always too busy, the first time I made them, I modified the recipe and made half the amount (40 cookies, less to be tempted by!?) but at the end I wished I'd made the entire amount as they were so good! 

I put the butter and icing (confectioners') sugar in the moulinex food processor, added the vanilla and only a half teaspoon of salt (which was fine), then gradually added the flour as well and mixed all together with a couple zaps.  

The mixture became soft, crumbly and I easily formed the balls quickly, and rolled them by hand. The entire process took less than half the time, too and they were all eaten in 10 minutes by the family who loved them!!

These were excellent.  My husband has always loved these cookies and I am by no means a good baker and he raved about these.  A little tip... I scooped them inot a 1 oz cookie scoop and clicked the handle a few times to form perfect balls.  No messy hands and they turned out perfect!

This recipe produces an excellent version of this type of cookie.  I reduced the salt to about 1/4 tsp and rolled them in 10X sugar three times each.  I found that about 12 minutes produced the right amount of doneness.

Someone get these away from me - I can't stop eating them!  And I don't usually like nuts in my cookies.  Other than putting in a teaspoon of almond extract and reducing the salt to about 1/4 teaspoon (I used lightly salted almonds that I ground in my mini-chopper) I made them as stated.  I wasn't sure how far apart to place them on the cookie sheet, but they didn't spread at all, so you can really load up the sheet.  I cooled them for about 10 minutes and then rolled them in the confect. sugar once, waited about 3-4 minutes and then rolled them again.  I'm making these for a wedding - I hope they last until then!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought these turned out pretty good.  I made them for a wedding reception and they were very elegant.  I used unsalted butter and reduced the amount of salt to 1/4 t. I also added 1 t. of almond extract for a bit more flavor.  With a small food scale, I weighed my dough to about a half ounce per cookie and the recipe made more than 80 cookies.  I made the crescent shapes, and they didn't "roll in the extra confectioners sugar" too easily, so I put them on wax paper and sifted the powdered sugar over them.  Also, to finely chop the almonds, I used a Black and Decker Handy Chopper.  It chops about a 1/2 cup to 1 cup at a time.  Just have to run it for at least a minute to get the almonds as small as it will chop.  Final Note:  Not your average cookie, so don't expect the kiddos to go wild over them!

This was a very simple cookie to make.  I made the ground almonds by grinding up sliced almonds in my blender, it works well if you do it in small batches and scrape down the sides now and then.  The cookie itself reminds me of a biscotti but not completely dry - it has that puffy airy texture to it.  Very nice slightly sweet almond flavor, I think I'll try adding a little almond extract to enhance the flavor.  I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp salt per the other reviewers comments.  They're very pretty and rustic - I plan on giving these as favors at my sister's bridal shower!  :)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy to follow and the cookies came out great.  I did however follow someone's advice and rolled the cookies twice once when they were warm and a second time when they had cooled down.

Very good recipe and this is an excellent "make it your own" type recipe.  Use any nut you like just make sure it is very fine.  I used almond meal the first time, and I thought they came out great.  Substitute almond extract if you like, however I like it with just a hint of almond, so that people are asking, "what is that flavor?" So, I replaced 1 1/2 teaspoons of the vanilla with almond extract and that's one of my fav's now.  You can make these into orange or lemon by using those extracts however don't use as much because I think they are too strong; use maybe 1/2 the amount and then throw in some zest to give that extra zing.  Here's my favorite trick though, when I make the nut based cookie, I roll them in powdered sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon of powdered vanilla.  AMAZING!  I like the Nielsen-Massey brand which you can get on Amazon or at Williams Sonoma. For the lemon and orange, mix in some finely grated zest with the powdered sugar.  The possibilities are endless.  One more thing, since we all like to tweak things and make them our own, I tried substituting some of the flour for cornstarch to see if it produced a more tender cookie and I think it did. Replace 1/2 cup of the flour with the cornstarch and see for yourself. I also save my powdered sugar in between batches and either use it in the next recipe or use it again for tossing the cookies in.  These are so darn addictive, baker beware!

My grandmother used to make these when I was little & this recipe is close to it.  We called them Mexican Wedding cookies or Besos de Nuez.  I used salted butter & ommitted the salt and instead of almonds I used walnuts, they were delicious!  The cookies were cooked & slightly brown at bottom at 15 minutes, next time I'll try 12.
I recommend letting the cookies cool almost completely before dusting with powdered sugar otherwise the sugar gets warm & melts a little making it sticky & a little clumpy, especially to touch (but they still taste good).  The sugar will still stick if you let them cool & they will have a prettier powdery look, then you can roll them again if you want.  I used a ziploc & placed about 7 cookies at a time (be gentle).  After I was done i put them in a tray & sprinkled more sugar on top of the batch.  I found I used a lot more sugar for dusting/rolling than what was recommended, next time I wouldn't bother measuring for this part.  Cover tightly to maintain freshness.

These were ok, not the best wedding cookies I have ever had.  I found I needed to bake them a lot longer, not only to be fully cooked, but also so they didn't fall apart.  They were so delicate while rolling in the sugar!  I used a coffee grinder (used only for nuts) to chop the almonds after breaking my minichopper with them.

Members of my family have nut allergies, so to modify this great recipe, I substituted crushed graham crackers for the almonds and they came out delicious! Gone in a matter of an hour at a small dinner party!

This recipe is perfect.  One helpful hint, to get the right size ball use a 1/2 teaspoon (measuring spoon) to scoop up your cookie dough for shaping into a ball.  Use a slightly heaping 1/2 teaspoon full.  You will get a nice size ball and they will all cook evenly because they are all the same size.  I cooked mine for about 9 min.  If you make them bigger then you will have to increase your cooking time, if you get much bigger than a full heaping teaspoon you may start having trouble with the bottom browning too much and the inside not as done as it needs to be.  Great recipe just used it and made about 3 doz cookies. Experiment to get the size of ball you want and the cooking time that is needed to satisfy you.  Once you get it down you will forever have great results!

These turned out ok.  They tasted good, but were very delicate and kept crumbling in your hand if you picked them up too hard.  I made them for a party and kept finding spots around my house that I could tell people were too rough with their little cookies... I've used better recipes for this type of cookie.

These went over like gang busters!  They are very delicate and are awesome in tea.  They melt in your mouth!!  I used walnuts instead of almonds or pecans, as those are the favorite in my house.  Worked GREAT!

I want to say THANK YOU Chris for putting this recipe on Allrecipes.com. I grew up with these, & I haven't been able to find the recipe ANYWHERE!! My problem??? My Mother called "Danish Wedding Cookies". Needless to say, She was Danish. I adore these cookies! I tripled the recipe! We used to take the cookies, once they were cooled down & gently shake them in a gallon sized plastic bag with powdered sugar and place them to continue to cool. We did the cresants & round balls. Shake GENTLY in bag cuz these cookies melt in your mouth! THANK YOU, THANK YOU for giving me back my Xmas cookies!

You know, to be fair, I have to rate this based on the way it's written and that brings it to four stars because the salt called for is way too high (I eliminated it all together because I use salted butter, but if I used unsalted butter, I would reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon) and also the vanilla is a bit on the high side (and I love vanilla!!). But I reduced it to two teaspoons and it was perfect!! With these two changes it easily goes to a five star, delicious cookie recipe! And for ease of rolling into balls, grind the nuts as finely as possible and you can even add up to 1 tablespoon of milk if you find the dough too crumbly. Enjoy!!

Very nice cookie recipe and exceptionally easy to make. Only adjustment I made was to use salted butter so I then used less salt. (1/4tspn salt).  I made my cookies really small so I wound up with alot of cookies and got tired of baking !  I decided to experiment with the dough and so I place the rest of the dough into a glass pie dish.  Pressed it down and baked it for 10 mins.  Once it cooled I filled it with chocolate pudding. So I wound up with very nice cookies and a chocolate pudding pie !  Next time I plan on using lemon extract.  I think the combination of lemon and almonds will be exceptional ! thanks for sharing !!!

This recipe was perfect. Cookies melted in my mouth - buttery and light. I have a warning though - you will be tempted to want to see a light browning around the bottom edge of the cookie indicating it's done - RESIST! Bake 5-20 minutes as per instruction (you may have to experiment with the time on first batch & adjust for your oven) and DO NOT BROWN. I tested this by lightly browning a batch and the difference was measurable. The lightly browned cookie was harder and not as buttery - the one that I did not brown was light and melted in our mouths. This recipe is a keeper.

I love this recipe!!! So good. I did a few adjustments to mine. Since I didn't have any pecans I used 1/2 to 1 cup of Walnuts. I found that putting them in the food processor and chopping them very fine works great. I also didn't put all that vanilla extract. I used 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I also didn't add the salt and that was because I forgot. It still was amazing. After mixing all the ingredients, I placed the bowl with the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes so the dough will set a bit. It was easier to make the balls to put on the cookie tray. Mine turned out perfect in 20-22 minutes in a gas oven. They just melt in my mouth every time I bite one. They are so addictive! 
Great recipe!! Thanks.

Wonderful cookie and great for the holiday potlucks at work!  I did what most did...reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I decided not to take the advise of some and dusted the cookies with powdered sugar just before serving, otherwise they got gooey on the outside.  I also used pecans in lieu of almonds.

Yum, just pulled these out of the oven, I tried "toasting" the nuts, perhaps my only mistake... easy to make 1/2 recipe, went lighter on the salt, but don't forgo to salt, it makes them even more tasty.

I used 1 cup margarine, and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the 1 1/2 cup butter.  I also didn't have quite enough almonds, so I filled in the remainder with walnuts (prob. 1/2 to 3/4 cup)... and added 1 t. almond extract.  The dough was not that tasty, but the cookies were awesome!

This is the first time that I've made this type of cookie, and they turned out great. The dough was very sticky, so I refridgerated it for a while to firm it up, and it was way easier to work with.  I used a small stainless steel scoop (melon ball size) to scoop the dough into balls.  Then I cut each ball in half.  You can then pinch into a crescent it you like.  I got 9 1/2 dozen cookies this way!  Don't let them brown in the oven, they should look dry on top, and they are done.  They are crumbly but great!  I substituted 3 t. fresh lemon juice for some of the almond extract, and also added the zest of a lemon to the dough.  
I also used about a tablespoon of zest and about 2 c. powdered sugar...whirred in the food processor to create a lemony flavored sugar to roll them in.  They were very good!  I may try almond lavender next time. ;)
another tip: don't use a warm pan, or the cookies will spread as you are shaping them.

This is the secound year that I have used this recipe.  I love them.  I cut the salt a little this year, I didn't notice too much salt but my husband said something last year.  I think I ate these the most out of all the cookies I make.  I just love them.

These tasted way too salty!  I would reduce the salt to a dash or 1/4t rather than 3/4t.  I will try them again using much less salt.

Extremely easy to make and delicious.  My daughter and I whipped out a batch which produced 3 dozen cookies in well under the 45 minute prep time.  Perhaps the Kitchen Aid mixer helped. The only tweak we made was to use almond extract instead of vanilla as this is how I've had these cookies in the past.

Very IMPORTANT! CHILL the dough before making these or you will end up with black bottoms. The amount of butter to flour is the reason. My Grandma made these and her recipe says chill for 1 hr but otherwise the same.

I have always loved these cookies, and I really never eat sweets, but when these are around I do.
I used my bullet to ground the pecans fine. Thanks, Ann

These were FABULOUS.  I did soften the butter a bit before I started mixing it and followed the directions exactly as shown.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My experience was that it was easier to cover them in powdered sugar when they were room temperature rather than warm as others have said.  Only two cookies broke apart, but I happily ate my mistakes.  I will defintely be making these again.

My daughter and I cooked these together. We followed the recipe exactly.The recipe is very simple and an easy thing to cook with the kids. It had too  much of a vanilla taste to me. Next time I would cut it down to maybe 3 Tsp Vanilla Extract. It was very cake like to me and not like the Wedding Cookies I am use too.I think I'll keep searching for the right Wedding Cookie recipe.

These have the best flavor out of any wedding cookies that I have made. I doubled the recipe, did not use unsalted butter and did not add additional salt. I used chopped pecans instead of almonds and instead of 6 cups of flour, I only used 5. I was a nervous because the dough was a little crumbly, which is why I didn't add the additional cup of flour. However, these cookies turned out to be the best tasting cookies.

Delicious! Very good, but not overly sweet. Just perfect. I didn´t alter a thing, except that I used salted butter and did not add any additional salt.

These were very good!  I make Mexican wedding cakes at Christmas and have found that putting the powdered sugar in a bag (brown lunch or large zip lock baggie) and waiting for the cookies to cool, then add 5-6 cookies to the bag and lightly toss works the best for coating.

I toasted some whole pecans, then processed in the food processor until they were quite fine. I used 2-1/2 tsp. vanilla plus 1 tsp. almond extract to add some sweetness.  I refrigerated the dough before rolling which worked fine.  My 1" balls took 22 minutes at 325 degrees in my oven to be fully set inside and not raw in the center. (I cut into a few test cookies at different time intervals to check.)  Be sure to use a stand or hand mixer to mix the butter/sugar to make it light and fluffy and then fold in the flour gently so it does not get 'tough'.  The results were good, although they are not very sweet and you could really taste the flour as other reviewers have mentioned.  Next time and I might add more powdered sugar to the mix and may try the other reviewers suggestion to substitute 1/2 cup of the flour for 1/2 cup of corn starch.

I just made these cookies for an Macaroni Western night and they were a BIG hit. They're great for dipping with tea or coffee. Instead of rolling them in powdered sugar again after taking them out of the oven, I just made a simple frosting out of confectioners sugar, water, and almond extract, and then decorated them with a few gold cupcake sprinkles to make 'em fancy.  I'll for sure make these again!

My family loved them. I did different shape (croissant shape)and dipped one half in dark chocolate then sprinkle some of the silver baking dust on the top of the part with chocolate...Also, I used pecan nuts instead of almonds and less salt. It was a big hit for Christmas. I'll make them again for sure.

Made these for Christmas and they were a big hit.   I put an indentation in each ball before I baked them and added a pecan with a drizzle of honey on top.   Turned out to be a very good touch to the recipe.   (I put the honey on a teaspoon and gently forced off a bit onto the pecan. It "glued" the pecan onto the cookie and formed a hardened crunch).  Very Good cookie.  Instead of rolling the cookie in powdered sugar, I sprinkle it on the top of the cookie with a small strainer after they have cooled.

I've been baking versions of these cookies for years, and though these are good, they aren't great.  I DID like that they were more light and airy than the usual dense recipes but they also lacked flavor.  If I were to bake them again I would add more powdered sugar as others have suggested and halve the vanilla, it just overpowered. Oh yes and leave some of the salt called for right in the cabinet.

Pretty darn good cookies! I used unsalted butter and cut the salt down by half. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. They cooked perfectly after 17 minutes in the gas oven at 325 degrees. I made hundreds of these cookies to make favors for my sister-in-law's wedding. I hope they're a hit! I gave them a four because I find them to be not quite sweet or tasty enough, but my sister-in-law and the rest of the family loved them so it might just be me!

My husband loves these cookies.  I only made few minor changes - half vanilla extract, half almond extract; hand crush sliced almonds so that we can see the almond when eating; instead of rolling in the confectionate sugar (which i did during my first try but turned out to be too sweet and messy), I simply sprinkled the sugar on top with a mesh coffee filter/sieve.  They look a lot prettier.

Love it! thanks for sharing!

Try putting a tablespoon of flour in with the almonds when you grind them.  This should help you get a finer grind.

I literally just took my first tray out of the oven, I ate one warm and it was so delicious. I only made half the recipe to make sure it was the cookie I was looking for, and now I am wishing I made the whole batch. I used salted butter because that is all I had on hand,so I didn't add the salt called for in the recipe, and I used walnuts instead of almonds..... These are AMAZING!!

Great Christmas Cookie. A nice change from the very rich and heavy treats. Nice to have with tea or coffee. I halved the recipe and still got 25 nice sized crescents. I used ground blanched almonds I purchased from the bulk food store. I used some almond extract as well. I found that by making crescents I didn't have to roll in sugar and worry about all that . I just let them cool on wire rack a bit. Then I used a makeshift seive (my tea strainer) filled with icing sugar and tapped it gently while lightly powedering all the cookies:) Worked great! I took an extra step to temper some semi sweet chocolate and then put it into a ziploc baggie with the tip cut off. I then put a swirl of chocolate on the top! Even with the extra step it didn't take long and it was well worth it. Plus it added something special for Christmas. Great recipe. Thank you!!!!

Depending on how many you are making, you should probably cut down on the flour by about 10% and add a few tablespoons of water to keep the dough pliable. The kitchenaide was laboring through it as it's pretty dry.   Also, plan on baking for 20-22 minutes, 15 is too short.  I did not find these to be brittle or crumbly, but that is probably be cause i cut down ont eh flour and really chopped the almonds to almost  a powder in the food processor because I hate when nuts get stuck between your teeth!

I thought I should finally review this cookie since I noticed my printout was dated 2003!  The printout is wrinkled, yellowed and sprinkled with cookie dough as I have made this recipe many, many times for different functions.  Everyone loves them and beg for more!  Be sure to let the butter soften well or it won't mix like it should.  I prefer pecans over almonds as I like them better!  This turns out perfect every time but don't tell anyone how easy they are!

I bought sliced almonds and ground them in a food processor. I also added 1 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter. The batter was too salty when I used the recommended amount of salt, but it tasted better when the salt was reduced to 1/4 tsp. I learned that the balls will flatten if you make them too big. I liked eating the cookies after they were chilled in the fridge because they didn't crumble so easily.

Our family calls these Danish Wedding Cookies.  They were very easy to make and tasted wonderful.  I received lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  This recipe makes a LOT of cookies and I made a lot of idividual tins to give as gifts at Christmas.

these were great.  I just put a pinch of salt and used unsalted butter as well.  because I made a double batch and didn't feel like rolling all those cookies (again!) one by one in the powdered sugar, I put the powdered sugar in a large baggie, dropped 15-20 cookies in until dusted.  worked out great.  Also, the cookies have to be completely cooled, not slightly cooled as recipe suggested.

After the the first batch, I had to make another batch without salt to try and save the rest.

I love this recipe, however, I added more vanilla than what was called for because vanilla gives it such a good flavor.  I also used pecans instead of almonds.  I've made other versions of this particular cookie but I like this recipe the best and will make it every year at Christmas time.

My mother's recipe is called Nut Gems and has 4 1/2 cups heaping flour, 2 cups confectionary sugar, one bottle Rum extract, one pound butter and 2 cups chopped walnuts.  Similar, but exquisite, as was baked yearly for Christmas.  Shake in powdered sugar when cool.  Freezes well.

I have been making these with pecans for more than sixty years.  They are still a favorite, but much easier to make thanks to parchment paper and a food processor! (My ancient recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon salt.)

I prefer the recipe from my ancient Betty Crocker  cookbook called Russian tea cakes, and I prefer the look of the cookie using ground hazel nuts . So many Christmas cookies use almonds , the change to hazelnuts  is nice and makes a prettier  cookies inside.

The only change that I made was the salt per the suggestion from other bakers from 3/4 tsp to 1/4 tsp. Regardless, these didn't turn out well.  They were so crumbly, that I was unable to pick them. The flavor was just so-so.

Found these to be kind of blah. If I were to make them again I would use almond extract instead of vanilla.

I have been making a similar version of this cookie with walnuts. I prefer this recipe with almonds for three reasons: almonds are cheaper, they crush more easily than walnuts and they give a nicer flavor than walnuts. Forget the ungreased cookie sheet: line the cookie sheet with parchment paper and these cookies will turn out perfectly with no burning and very little browning on the bottom. One of the nice things about the parchment paper trick is it allows you to make large cookies: the center has time to cook, and since the bottoms don't burn, they turn out great. Cookies like these pair well with a cuppa tea! (translation: cup of tea)

Just made these to pack for Christmas presents.  Followed others recommendation: unsalted butter, 1/4 tsp salt, used the ice cream scooper method then rounded them with my hands, then squeezed the balls so that they are slightly taller because they flatten out a little after baking.  I was able to get total 60 cooikes with this recipe.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

Italian Wedding cookies, Mexican Wedding cookies, I had no idea they were also called that! I know them as Kourambie, a very popular Christmas Bisquit from Greece. Only one more week till Christmas and then the house will be filled with the aroma of these and other sweet delights, cant wait!

Like BERDISA, I needed to bake these cookies about 30 minutes, and they were still crumbly. Good taste, but they also flattened out while baking. So I could not roll them in sugar even if I wanted to.

Yummy recipe. Remember folks, they aren't supposed to be browned, they stay pale. Cook for the correct amount of time, even if the dough on the top looks like it's not completely 'finished,' it is. Also I like to use pecans in them. But not ground. I buy the pecan halves & then slice them against the grain into slivers so they can be SEEN inside the cookies. Yes it can be a bit time consuming, I usually do all the slicing the night before I make them. 
Oh I have to add. Used 1/4 tsp Salt & then used regular salted butter.

It is a nice and easy recipe. Instead of adding the vanilla and the nuts, I just added Amaretto liquor.  Instead of using "unsalted" butter I just used real salted butter (not the fake stuff) and instead of "rolling" the cookies in the sugar. I just put them in the bag and "gently" shake (like you are making chicken but much gentler) and then very carefully pull them out and put them on wax paper in a tin (after letting them cool) My mother cannot eat nuts, so that's why there are no almonds in my recipe. I have made these exactly as written (without rolling them in sugar afterwards) and they make an excellent cookie to put out with tea or coffee!

Made these today because i was stuck in the house with my daughter who is feeling under the weather. So easy, so few ingredients! I only gave it four stars because 1. Too much salt!! Would have been fine with 1/4TSP 2. So darn sweet!! I guess that's more my own preference. So i left a couple aside for myself that i didn't roll in the sugar. Very pour-is so its great for drinking coffee or dunking in milk!! Melt in your mouth delicious.

Absolutely delicious - I blended some almonds and it turned out really yummy. I wanted round cookies rather than flat on the bottom, so I'll chill dough next time and see if that helps.

We used Earth Balance, a kind of vegan buttery spread instead of butter and it turned out great! Awesome for vegans looking for tasty desserts.
It's a bit on the crumbly side, but that kind of comes with the territory. Wonderful recipe!

This a great cookie recipe!  I used salted butter and no salt at all and it was wonderful.  I bought slivered almonds and used a small processor and was able to grind them very very fine.  It worked perfectly.  Everyone who tried them wanted the recipe.!!

These were outstanding!!! So easy too!! I rolled them when right out of the off...be careful, still hot!! Then again about 5 minutes later! Confectioners sugar stuck very well, covering the cookie, making it totally white :D They are ALL GONE! Wish it made more, will double next time. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This recipe is almost perfect. I HIGHLY recommend using margarine instead of butter. Butter makes the cookie crumbly. I also increased the powdered sugar to almost a full cup. As the others did, I decreased the salt to 1/4 teas. I have never used almonds for my cookies. I prefer walnuts, finely ground. Everyone RAVES about them.  I also only used 2 1/2 teas of pure vanilla. Only cool long enough to touch and then roll in powdered sugar. Then after completely cool, roll again to make them look very pretty. Friends and Family ADORE my cookies every Christmas!

I had problems with this recipe. My cookie dough was way too soft & sticky to form balls. I added some more flour to the consistency I could work with. The cookies came out way too tender and just trying to pick them up caused them to crumble. I followed the recipe exactly, other than having to add more flour, so no idea what went wrong. The entire batch was just way too delicate to even roll in the powdered sugar without crumbling.

At first I hated this cookie because it was so crumbly. It disintegrated when my teenager went to grab one and I gave it two stars. I thought it was pretty bland but you really have to give it time to cool completely before tasting. This cookie is better on day 3 so make it days in advance of your event. It's less crumbly on the 2nd and 3rd day probably because the butter solidifies a little bit. This cookie grew on me and so I'm going to try bringing it to our Thanksgiving cookie contest and see how people like it. I'll edit this afterwards to let you know. co-workers liked it. I did follow others suggestions regarding salt and making it 1/3 vanilla and 2/3 almond extract. I think I'll try just using all extract next time. I also tried dipping the tops in chocolate and my teen loved it that way better. I will also try putting a chocolate kiss in the center and see how that does in the oven.

These cookies were great! So simple to make! I reduced the serving size because i didnt need that many, and used recommendations from reviews. For good rounded ingredient amounts, I scaled recipe to 27. Omit salt. Use 1/2 cup of nuts. Use 1 tsp vanilla & 2 tsp almond extract. Use mellon baller to form shape. Bake for 20 min. Roll in sugar when warm, and again when cooled. Made about 50 cookies.

Best christmas cookie ever! Most of mine are going to Maryland from Arizona for the 2nd year in a row (so they ship well in a tin). I have decreased the salt by 1/4 tsp and used chopped pecans. Other than that...no changes to the recipe. Perfect consistency before and after baking. The dough keeps well in the fridge for 3 days and in the freezer for 3 months. Its best to bring the dough close to room temp before baking. These cookies are suppose to be a little on the crumbly side. They are a delicate cookie. When coating in confectionary sugar, place in a large bowl then add the sugar on top. Gently move the bowl so they dont crumble. Makes it easier to coat if they are still warm.

I just made these last night and they were awesome! However, they do crumble easily 1-2 hours right after they are out of the oven...so rolling them in powdered sugar was an adventure. The trick is using good butter and vanilla extract. I used walnuts instead of almonds and added a teaspoon of cinnamon just for kicks. They taste yummy refrigerated too.

This is truly a five star recipe! I used chopped roasted almonds and ground them in the food processor and also added about a tsp of, yes, pumpkin spice! It was that much better! They were incredibly crumbly and crunchy! When I ran out of almonds, I had to improvise, so I ground 3/4 cup of toasted sesame seeds and added about another half a cup of flour to the mix and they were amazing. Try this and u will love it!

I used almond meal from Trader Joes instead of finely ground almonds.  The confectioners' sugar certainly made a difference.  As the other reviewers suggested the I decreased the amount of salt.  I think next time I will use almond slivers to decorate the cookie.  Quick eggless cookie, definitely a keeper!

Unbelievable!  Everyone at my work raved about them, and told me they were better than the cookies made by a local gourmet bakery.  I rolled them in powdered sugar twice (once when they were warm, and once when they were cool).  I will definitely be making these again and again and again :)

I absolutely loved these cookies! I'm from an italian family so these cookies are made in cookie trays when we have parties. When I found this receipe i was suprised to find out their not so difficult to make either. It makes about a batch of 25-30 cookies. I did add a little bit of almond extract in another batch just to bring out the taste, but the original receipe is phenomenal!

Love this recipe!  The picture is weird, they won't look like this, but they are gorgeous and delicious.  I buy the very same cookied from Cafe Silicia in my town and now I have the recipe!  I used about twice as much raspberry jam....the possibilities are endless and yummy!  One of my all time favorites ever.

In response to the salt issue, I used salted almonds, and omitted the salt from the recipe entirely. They turned out great! I did let them chill in the fridge for about 2 hrs. before baking, and tossed them in sugar 3X. 

I used my hand blender to finely chop up the almonds, and it worked perfectly.

Perfect cookie- not too sweet, too dry or crunchy. Best version of this cookie I've tasted in awhile. I used roasted salted almonds and omitted the salt. It still turned out wonderful.

Light and crisp shortbread cookies. So delish, the only changes I made were to decrease the vanilla by a third, and added green and red sugar crystals to make them Christmas cookies. Perfect!

Fairly easy recipe.  Just time consuming and messy.  Hint:  make sure your butter is very soft.  And when rolling cookies in sugar after baking--they tend to be fragile.

Great cookies.  I can't say they taste much different from my other standby recipe, but they did bake up much firmer.  I made the balls teaspoon size, which is smaller than I have before, so that may have made the difference.  I used salted butter and used only 2 tsp of vanilla.  I read that someone wore out a small machine grinding the almonds; use the blender - it's sturdy and will get the job done.  I'm not sure what to think of the reviewer who made these without nuts - the nuts are a key ingredient for taste and texture. Yum!

These were easy and tasted great!  Instead of rolling them in powdered sugar, I put about 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar into a plastic bag and dumped about 10 cookies at a time in the bag and shooked them up to coat them.  It was way faster and easier than doing them individually.

Fantastic cookie. I received many compliments and recipe requests. I made these for a wedding shower and they were absolutely perfect. The first time I made them I used almond extract instead of vanilla - they were too rich but still good. The next time I used 1 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 3 tsp. vanilla extract and they were perfect. I will be making these for my neighborhood Christmas gifts. Definitely a keeper!

Great flavor. These became the favorite at my cookie bake. But they flatten a little while cooking, not realy balls. Maybe I should refrigerate the dough before poping them in the oven.

YUMMY!!  Since I didn't have an nuts to add to the cookie, I increased the powdered sugar to 1 cup, and then added add about 3 teaspoons vanilla AND 3/4 teaspoon almond extract.

BTW, I made this once with UNsalted butter and added added the 1/4 teaspoon salt as suggested, but thought it still needed more, so I added a few dashes.  But remember, I didn't use any nuts.  The amount of saltiness needed probably has a lot to do with the type of nut (if any) that you used.

When I made the recipe again I used SALTED butter and only a dash of salt (no nuts though) and it tasted perfect.

I agree with the reviewer who said to roll them in powdered sugar while hot and then roll (or dust) again.  It makes the cookies kinda goey, so separate layers with wax paper, but they totally melt in your mouth.  

I made them teaspoon sized as the recipe says, but actually prefer a larger cookie, just add a bit more cooking time. Remmeber, these cookies don't really brown, so be careful.  Check for doneness by the touch-test, or by looking at the bottom of the cookie, it should be only slightly brown.

YUMMY!!

Creamy, mild and tasty! I sub'd pecans for the almonds, and used real margarine minus the salt. Turned out good. However, rolling the cookies afterwards in the powered sugar got a little messy. Once suggestion was using a baggy, not. I suggest a plate or something wider and deeper. Overall great flavor, texture and recipe. However, our kids didnt care too much for it. I think it's more of an adult taste.

Growing up we called these 'snowball' cookies, and this is a very good recipe.  I like crushed pecans, instead of almonds - but any nut would do.  The salt is excessive, unless you're using unsalted butter.  I cut it for my second batch to 1/2 teaspoon.

These are really lovely cookies.  Very soft and melt-in-your-mouth, with a heavenly almond flavor.  I used 1 teaspoon almond extract and reduced the vanilla extract by the same amount - it really gave them a flavorful, delicious kick.  And I listened to other reviewers and reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon - perfecto!

Wonderful recipe!  Easier to make than I thought.  Used parchment paper to bake the dough on, and a pastry brush to brush chocolate on the top layer. If chocolate cracks when cutting, just fill it in with melted chocolate.

These cookies were very fry and crumbly and didn't stay together when rolled into a ball. The flavor was OK, but I like them better with pecans as opposed to almonds.

I made these yesterday and they were delicious! However, the recipe never said when to add the egg or the baking powder.

Great recipe! I made a double  batch, but only had 2 tsp. of vanilla, so I added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Also a bit dry, probably because short on vanilla so had to add a couple tbls of water. I ended up rolling in my had to make balls because using a melon baller made the dough crumble, it needed the heat to make the butter melt a bit. 
As I stated, the cookies are great, and a very simple recipe!! Thanks for that! Oh baked at the 325° for 15 in my oven (next time if make same size will only cook 13 minutes, but plan to make them smaller so they are one bite cookies for less of a mess when eating) and I rolled in sugar right out of oven and again after they cooled. I've already eaten a "few" as you can see in the pic lol!!!

These turned out lovely.  Delicate, flavorful.  I used the suggested amount of vanilla with about 1/4 tsp almond extract and otherwise  followed  the  recipe  exactly.  I used a measuring tablespoon  of dough for each ball and baked for 20 minutes. One big bite per cookie.......yum.

I followed the recipe and baked for 15 mins on first batch.  They were very dry and crumbly.  Second batch I baked for 14 minutes, and they were better but still crumbly.  Not great flavor either.

These cookies are melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I had a lot of ground walnuts in the house, so I used them instead of almonds - it gave it a slightly nuttier flavor. To compensate, I replaced 1 tsp. vanilla with 1 tsp. almond extract and that was a great addition.

A hit with every age.  Not too sweet and not too dry.  Pretty easy to make.  No changes made -- followed recipe to the T, and they turned out perfect (made little balls rather than crescents because they were simpler).

Excellent cookie. Followed the recipe exactly except I used finely chopped pecans instead of almonds.  The family can't get enough of them.

I doubled the recipe and it was too dry. I used less salt as suggested but felt it needed more in the end. I also substituted 1/4 of the vanilla with almond extract.
If I made this again I'd use more powdered sugar, more salt and a little less flour.

Great recipe. Definitely pull them out before they color. I have  very accurate oven, and I baked mine for the full 20 minutes. I did want some texture, so I added about a cup of slivered almonds that I crushed iinto small pieces with my hands, and a small amount of almond extract (maybe 1/2 teaspoon).

I made crescents and balls.  What I forgot is the cookies are very delicate.  You can’t roll them in the sugar as soon as they come out of the oven.  They crumble if you do.  I found that letting them rest 5 to 10 minutes, they then have more structure so you can powder them.

I spent the  morning baking Christmas cookies for my neighbors. I tried this recipe after reading all the wonderful reviews. I followed the directions to a tee and even chilled the dough as some suggested. It was a disaster. The balls flattened to thin patties which crumbled when I tried to remove them. I had to throw the whole batch out and I went to the store and bought some lovely sweet star shaped raspberry filled cookie. I will include these in my box of assorted Christmas cookies. Ver disappointed.

I lightly soaked the cake layers with amaretto liqueur for additional moisture. It was a bit dry, and not as good as the ones sold in italian bakeries. ( I am from NY, italian bakeries are very authentic)

Pretty good cookies! There was a really nice balance of flavor. The only thing I would have liked to know is what the cookies should have looked like when they're done baking. I wasn't sure if I under-baked them or not. Other than that, I really enjoyed them!

I had a little bit of dough left, so I experimented with rolling in powdered sugar first like I do with molasses cookies.  That was a failure. It turned them from melt in your mouth bites of deliciousness to hard little rocks with a bitter aftertaste.  Directions like "let cool" are always a little vague and I shattered a few (more for me to snack on!), so really do let them cool to be cool to touch and they held together better then.

Perfect the way they are! Only advice, all ovens are different, so just be mindful of how much time it takes to make them look like they've "set". Do not brown them!

I live in Southwest Texas and this dough came out rather dry, so I added just enough milk, so that the dough would "clump" and I could make the little balls.  I also only added 1/4 tsp on salt.  I love these cookies!

These are really very good. I mostly followed the recipe but used walnuts because it's what I had. I used the suggested salt and honestly didn't think they were too salty as others mentioned. They were pretty delecate and I had to be really careful while doucing them in the sugar directly out of the oven but they were perfect for handling later. The walnut flavor was so good and people loved them!! I cooked them for 13 min.  I will make these again!

My family loved these cookies. The flavor is simple and subtle. I halved the recipe and omitted the salt in favor of using salted butter. I did not add any almond extract. They were gone in a day. They are great with coffee.

I have made and am burrently making hundreds of these for my cinco de mayo wedding. ill be freezing them and adding the powdered sugar the day before. I accidentally misread the amount of vanilla to read 4 TABLEspoons and it is really teaspoons. HOWEVER, I ended up adding 3 tablespoons  of good Mexican vanilla, and it was AMAZING. So, I just keeping making it that way. These are buttery, light, and will be a huge hit. This will be my recipe at Christmas also for my russian tea cakes. thanks!!

These were good but may not be sweet enough for most people. I like crunchy and crumbly cookies and these definitely fit the bill. I'm not sure how I'd modify it to make it sweeter.

I made this recipe as written. Sorry to say I actually had to make it twice because the first batch was eaten...by me...the family did help...some...I couldn't stop! They were so good!  It's a fantastic cookie to make because you can put so many in a pan even though the cooking time is longer than a usual cookie and it really was so easy!!! I look forward to making these for many years to come!

I used 2 sticks of salted butter and 1 stick of unsalted, did not add any salt, and only used 3 tsp of vanilla.  I put a hershey kiss in the middle of each of them before baking and baked for 20 minutes.  They came out perfect and everyone is raving over them!

Made a half recipe of these as an extra for a xmas cookie tray.  Used about 3/4 of a cookie scoop for each and got 28 cookies.  Very tasty ..almost melt in your mouth.  Rather than rolling in icing sugar, I just sifted it over top while they were still warm.  I will make again, but might add in a bit of Skor bits.

My family loved these, I pulsed almonds and walnuts together in the food processor. I left out the salt and used salted butter. They were crumbling a bit when I tried to roll them in powdered sugar, but perhaps I didn't wait for them to cool enough first. Delicious!

I made these earlier today. Substituted walnuts for the almonds (our preference for these type of cookies). They definitely needed the whole 20+ minutes to cook and made sure not to make them too big. Made the recipes as written except omitted the salt (used salted butter) and came out with 65 cookies. They were very light brown on the bottoms, but fully baked inside. 20 minutes in the oven at 350, take them out and they'll bake just a little bit more sitting on the counter. They are very good; just not the best cookie ever.

I did not add the nuts. I used almond extract instead of vanilla and used a small ice cream scoop so they were all the same size.  Made them for a Christmas party, everyone loved them. Will definitely make them again and again.

Yes!  I made another recipe from this website that I had to throw away they were so dry.  These had the right balance of butter to dry ingredients so they were just right.  I did find that baking them a couple minutes longer ensured that they were baked through and had a nice crunch.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I found that grinding the almonds down to where it was almost a butter was better than keeping large chunks.  You still get the texture of the nuts, but it blended better with the butter and flour.

These cookies were a huge hit at a party. They were very easy to make, and just exploded with soft fluffy cookie in your mouth. I used just salted butter, and made sure they were cool enough to roll in powdered sugar. I also used Macadamia nuts! These really were outstanding. This is my go-to recipe for these cookies. They are easy to make.

Awesome cookies. I added 2.5 cups of almond flour and 2 cups of flour (instead of the 1.5c and 3c. as the recipe calls). I did not change anything else. YOu can skip rolling the cookies in powdered sugar and they are still delicious.

Trying to use the things I had at home I used margarine, salted almonds, and 1/2 tsp of salt.  I do enjoy the balance of the salty with the sweet.  I baked each pan for 17 mins on parchment paper so I could easily swap out sheets of cookies and use the same AirBake cookie sheet.  This recipe yielded 97 cookies (1 tsp each) for me.

The recipe was really great, quick and easy to make, The time is not correct. I left mine in for closer to 25 minutes, let them cool then rolled them in powdered sugar.

I followed this recipe in everything except I didn't have unsalted butter. So, I used regular, and cut the extra salt. They were so rich, and not too crumbly. I kept them in the fridge till the next day and they still held together and disappeared very quickly at the party! This is a repeat for sure

My grandmother made wedding cookies for years and I learned from her.  They are fantastic.  But what she taught me is to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening for the fat.  It makes such a delicate flavored cookie.  The all butter ones to me are too dense, I like mine to just melt in my mouth.  Also, always pecans finely chopped. I have never tried this recipe, just giving cookie hints

I  substituted  1/2 cup of corn starch for 1/2 cup of the flour as another reviewer had said to do. It made the cookies so soft they fell apart whenever I touched them.  So except for cutting the salt down the recipe is best as it is written.  I've made this recipe many times as written and everyone has loved them.

I substituted pecans and used my small scoop which expedited the process.  I dumped the hot cookies into a pie plateful of confectioners sugar and tossed them with a fork.  The texture was a little too dry but that could be pecans v. almonds.  I think I'll go back to my old recipe.

Good recipe! I experimented with it a little by leaving out the almonds and mixing in Nutella to replace the nut flavor. I also only used a cup of flour and then put in 1/2 cup of cornstarch which I think made the cookies a little softer. They came out nicely brown and flavorful, and taste great with raspberries on top!

I made half of the recipe and they came out pretty good... The only thing I will do differet next time is to cool off the cookie for a little more time before I roll it into the confecciones sugar.

These are great lil cookies. I also used pecans, and rolled twice in powdered sugar. That's how I was taught as a kid from my mom. I found 17 mins to be perfect timing.

These are really good. They taste just like they are supposed to. The only thing is i left them in for the 15 minutes the first time around and they were way over done. Not black but they tasted burned. So i tried again and found that 10 minutes is perfect.

These are my favourite cookies in the world! My grandmother called them "Danish Wedding Cookies"... probably because SHE is Danish LOL! Anyway, I didn't have that much butter so I substituted shortening, and I think that's why mine flattened while baking. They still turned out DELICIOUS! I had a hard time with the hot cookies because the sugar melted and when I picked the cookie up the melted sugar burned my fingers... ouch! Instead of this, I used a salt shaker filled with the sugar to sprinkle on the cookies and this was much more attractive and easier!

i didn't give it 5 stars only bc i did alter the recipe a little bit.  i used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and i'm lazy tonight so i didn't sift my whole wheat flour (LOL).  BUT everything else i did do the same and the recipe is fabulous.  so yummy!  :)

Mine came out flat, but still delicious. My mistake was melting the butter. DO NOT melt the butter. It also helped to cool the batter and not overbeat. They are marvelous!!!! Flat or no, still wonderful. Make two batches, because they go quickly. This is a keeper!

I have made this recipe several times and have always been pleased with the results. I found that it is always a  good idea to wait until the cookies have cooled quite a bit before rolling them in sugar. If they are too warm, the sugar gets too pasty and they have to be rolled again to give them the powdered look. I also prefer to use pecans rather than almonds or walnuts, but that is just a personal preference.

These came out soooo good!  This was the best cookie I have ever made.  I didn't have time to grind the almonds, so I used almond extract.  Came out perfect!  :-)

Okay I have a reputation for being a great baker(not bragging here) these cookies were like BRICKS I should have used my judgment and cut back the flour  They were dry! I had never made this type cookie so I followed the recipe exactly using all organic ingredients so it was pretty sad that they didn't turn out. :(

GREAT recipe.  I only had 1 stick of the unsalted butter so the other two sticks were margarine and I had to use pecans instead of almonds.  The cookies were part of Christmas gifts I gave to co-workers. Everyone loved these cookies the best out of the assortment I gave them. I had to make another batch the next night and they came out good, but the first batch was better.  I really think if I had used the unsalted butter it would have made a big difference. I didn't have problems like others did as far as the cookies crumbling.

Simple and delicious!!! I made these cookies (3 double batches) in a food processor.  They were just the easiest and most delicious cookies I've ever made.  Took them to a Christmas cookie party and they were gone 1/2 way through with (literally) dozens of people asking for the recipe.  This is a home run.  I made them with salted butter and left out the salt.  Also added some almond flavoring.  Next batch I'm going to experiment with adding some gran marnier for a kick.

These cookies were amazing! Melt in your mouth goodness with a bang of almond flavour.  I didn't change a thing and they came out perfect.  Making another batch today and will take them out a bit early to see if I can get them any chewier.

These were good, but mine came out a little dry and some were crumbly. be careful not to use too many dry ingredients vs butter. I've had better, made by others.

These are a nice cookie because people love their size.  You can easily eat 2 or 3 and not feel too guilty.  I used the pecans and everybody liked them.

I substituted the almonds for pecans since that's what I had... and it was awesome!  So yummy!  I have these before but never made them myself and I must say they were so easy.  I also just used a tad bit of salt since I do not normally add salt in my baking.  Next time I might try it completely without just because we're not salt people.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

I just made these cookies today & they are quite yummmmy... the only change I made was with the butter since I only had two sticks of unsalted butter I put 1/2 cup spreadable butter and since this has salt in it I only put 1/2 tsp salt. These cookies came out so good and so yummy... I am bringing them to a friends house this evening I hope they like them as much as I do...

These are awesome! They are super light and crisp.  I made tiny teaspoon sized ones, which I like more than making 1" balls, I think the texture is better as bite size.  I also used pre-slivered almonds, which had no 'skin' on them, so the cookies were totally creamy colored with no dark flecks.

Yummy, these are really good cookies. Recipe made about 45 cookies and I cooked them for 20 minutes, I didn't have any trouble with them falling apart. Definitely a once and awhile treat since they are really high in fat and calories.

These cookies are my favorite. The ground almonds add a perfect touch!

I remember having these as a child. I was so happy to find a good recipe. They are very tasty, just as I remember them, and my son loved helping me roll them in the powdered sugar. I will definitely put this in my recipe file so my children can enjoy them often. Thank you for sharing your recipe!
