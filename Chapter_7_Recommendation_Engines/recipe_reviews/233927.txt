Used this recipe for making Navajo tacos.  We were just 4 people for lunch, so I halved the recipe. (Used half tablespoon SAF instant yeast.) 
I thought these were more tender than the fry bread made with baking powder. We enjoyed the meal!

I love this recipe.  They puffed up a little more then I wanted so I didn't roll them too thin to prevent.  I have be using my own recipe for fry bread for about 20 years, but will be changing to this one.  Thanks for sharing it.

This was a very delicious recipe. I made a slight alteration, I kneaded the dough with flour until it was light and no longer sticky. It also made 12 servings rather than 10, but maybe I like a smaller fry bread.

Great taste!  I made the mistake of adding the water all at once and I should have added a little at a time. I ended up adding more flour to get to the desired consistency. Once that was achieved, everything went well. Use caution adding it to the oil, it is a little difficult to do without splashing the oil. I ended up putting it in with the side closest to me first, that directed the splash away from me.

Great recipe for sweet fry bread. My dad being 100% Navajo, does his differently. I made this recipe to eat with chili and it was way too sweet to eat with it. Instead, we put butter, honey and powdered sugar. It was absolutely delish! I didn't give it 5 stars because I personally think fry bread should be more salty instead of sweet. Although this recipe is a keeper for sweet fry bread!

I made these for tacos, just as the recipe is written. I got unanimous votes that they were really good. I used my 8" cast iron skillet and fried one at a time while the others rested. The texture kinda reminds me of a donut. Totally worth the extra time.

My husband loved this recipe. The only thing i didn't use was the sugar because we were having tacos and didn't want a sweet bread. Totally loved this! =)

I've made several fry bread recipes and this one is my families favorite one by far. The bread turns out every time and it tastes heavenly. It is now the only fry bread I make. It's great for Navajo Tacos, Carne Asada Tacos, with chili or eating it plain with nothing on it.  Love, love, love it.

I feel bad giving this three stars because it seems as no one had the problem I did but this was so sticky I probably added at least a cup of extra flour! When I tipped it onto the floured surface It was impossible to work with. I will need to adjust the water next time around!

I needed a frybread recipe for some indian tacos my husband requested. It tasted exactly the way I expected. I made the recipe as written but I did opt for warm milk in the place of the warm water. Really great recipe. Will make again and again again.

Perfect and very easy.   We love this recipe best.  They turned out light, crunchy, delicious and hard to resist long enough to let them cool down enough to eat.  Thank you for sharing!  :9

Made this for a family of 20 and was gone before I took a second look! We have made fry bread in our family for since I can remember. This was a great recipe!
