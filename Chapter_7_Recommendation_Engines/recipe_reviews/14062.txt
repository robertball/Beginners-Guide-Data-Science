This turned out to be a wonderful Valentines Day dinner for two.  The sauce was wonderful -- we added more mushrooms and left out the green onions and enjoyed it immensely!  We actually simmered the sauce for about three hours and thought it really helped the flavor intensify. For the polenta, we used only cornmeal and it turned out wonderfully.

This was sooo gooood!  However, I didn't put as many green onions in the polenta - I just put in one bunch, and I didn't use the quinoa.  The tomato sauce was excellent.  Thanks, Jen!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  It was so good and it was our first polenta recipe.  The only differences I made were that I used regular mushrooms rather than portabella (as they are not my favorite) and I added more red pepper flakes as we like things spicy!  This was SO GOOD - just loved the parm and the green onions in the polenta - I thought it was a wonderful addition.  Thanks!

I was desperately looking for something new to use some of the overabundance of roma tomatoes from the garden. Used about 5 peeled and whole romas (for 2 servings) and balsamic vinegar instead of sherry.  A keeper recipe with or without the quinoa.

This recipe was delicious!!! I loved the quinoa in the polenta, and the tomato sauce was quite tasty.  I didn't use as much onion as was called for, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Looking forward to having this again--thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I had to cook the polenta a little longer to get the consistency that I wanted but it was "lick you plate clean" good.

This turned out great.      Great presentation.  Great combination of flavors with the mildness of the polenta and the sweet spiciness of the sauce.  A great romantic dinner for me and my girlfriend.

My husband loved this.  I found the sauce a little too sweet.  I may try a different sauce next time.

I made this for my "foodie" friends, and it was a great hit!  The tomato sauce was even better the next night when I heated up the leftover polenta and sauce.

This is a good alternative to pasta. I'm giving it three stars because there was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't spectacular either.

This is a good recipe and has been a favorite of ours for a while.  It comes from Didi Emmons's cookbook "Vegetarian Planet."  If you like this recipe you should buy the book, there's a lot of good recipes in it.

I didn't have mushrooms, red pepper flakes or sherry.  So I substituted the 1/2t pepper flakes for 1/2t cayenne pepper and the 1/4c sherry for 1/4c white balsamic vinegar.  I added an extra 1/2t oregano and omitted the green onions.
It turned out delicious!!

Delicious!!  I was attempting to recreate a dish we had at a restaurant, and this was very close.  I followed the suggestion of using fresh tomatoes, which I quartered and put in the food processor for a several pulses until it was the consistency of stewed tomatoes.  I also added chopped red peppers and replaced the sherry with 3T of balsamic vinegar.  This will be my "go to" dish when friends come over for dinner on the deck in the summer!

Never made polenta before, but this came out like cornmeal soup.

Very tasty and more substantial that traditional polenta. I left out the mushroom and the cheese and added some sauted zucchini to the sauce instead. It was quite good.

This was my first time to make or eat polenta.  The tomato sauce was delicious but the polenta was quite bland.
