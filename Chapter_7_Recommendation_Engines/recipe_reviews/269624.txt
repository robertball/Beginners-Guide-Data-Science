This recipe is very good as is. I was afraid of making it but I am glad I took the plunge. I was pleased with the results. At the moment, I had instant yeast and it came out perfect. I mixed the ingredients in a stand mixer following the instructions by making the well in the center and sprinkling the salt at the edges. This is important so the salt does not kill the yeast. I think it is very similar to homemade Challah. I will make it again however will definitely add sugar to my taste and possibly a bit more eggs to give it a bit richer egg flavor.

I must have made a big mistake somewhere.  Came out hard as a brick bat and not tasty at all.  The difference between the video and actual recipe was very confusing for someone who doesn't bake bread.

DO NOT PUT EGG INTO THE DOUGH!! It will dry out the bread. I am Swiss and have made this bread many times. My father was a baker in Switzerland and NEVER used egg.
