This turned out great! I changed a few things though: I could not for the life of me find pearl onions at my grocery store so I had to used regular--it's a shame because pearl onions would be lovely with this! I added paprika a few bay leaves used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and fresh mushrooms. I baked it in a Dutch oven and it actually was perfectly cooked in about 2-2 1/2 hours. 3 hours and it was a bit overdone. Still delicious and easy though! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm on a fairly strict Paleo diet right now and came looking for something with meat vegetables and sweet potatoes (one of the few carbs I'm eating). I found this and made a double batch of it to prep for the week. It is absolutely perfect! I added a lot more celery and carrots to fit the amounts I need for each meal. I used a couple of beef roasts carefully trimming around the fat to get nice pieces. With a double batch I baked it for about 5 hours. The beef is perfectly tender as are the vegetables. The sweet potatoes are just starting to lose their form exactly the way I like them. I will be making this often!
