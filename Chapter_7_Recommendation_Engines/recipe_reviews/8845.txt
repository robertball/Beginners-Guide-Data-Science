I have made this recipe several times now and my husband and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  After the first time, I made some changes and fine tuned it with much success.  I did the following: 1)I sauted the onions at medium heat, it takes too long on low heat and they don't soften enough. 2)I covered the chicken/onion mixture with only a drizzle of balsamic and stock, and prepare the sauce while it bakes(is quicker that way) 3)I simmered the sauce until it had reduced by half, then I added 2 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp dijon mustard to thicken.  Used a whisk to combine them, and then poured over chicken and baked 5 more minutes.  Also, it is great with pork chops as well, and the sauce marries nicely with baked asparagus too! Thanks for sharing!

WONDERFUL!!! What a hit! I changed just a few things just like in someone before post. I used boneless skinless chicken breast just because we prefer these. I made recipe as it said until you put it in the oven. I put the chicken in a oven dish, added HALF the stock and just a drizzle of the Balsamic, covered and put in oven. I put the remaining stock and 1/2 cup of Balsamic in a pan on stove. I boiled until it reduced by half. I then added 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of spicy mustard. You probably could use a dijon like someone else had suggested, its just what i had on hand. I mixed that to thicken it a bit, poured it over the chicken, and let it cook for the remaining 10 minutes. This is a "make'er again", for sure!! Thank you.

I was looking for an onion/balsamic vinegar/chicken dish and found this one to be closest to what my taste buds were looking for.  Although I did change it up a little bit.  I used chicken breasts sliced into medallions, which I seasoned w/ S&P and coated in flour.  I caramelized the onions in one pan and sauteed the chicken in another.  Once the onions were done I added the liquids and brought it up to a simmer and added the cooked chicken.  Then I simmered everything for 20 - 30 minutes to allow the sauce to reduce.  I left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any and my children probably wouldn't eat them.  Next time I will add them for flavor and just remove the tomatoes from my children's servings.  A final thought, use REALLY GOOD vinegar for best results.  I would give it 5 stars but I felt I altered the recipe too much to do so.

This was delicious. Some parts of the recipe did not work out exactly as the recipe explained. For example the chicken took much longer to cook then 20 minutes and the balsamic vinegar/chicken stock mixture never really thickened for me. I added the sundried tomatoes to the balsamic vinegar mixture and they were soft by the time the dish was done. Thank you for a delicious recipe!!

This was very tasty. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and I cut the onions into larger chunks. The sauce helped to keep the chicken moist while it cooked. I used the extra broth mixture to make couscous as a side dish and it was unbelievably good!  Good low carb meal too.

3 words..Oh My God! This recipe is fabulous. The onions and garlic take over the place, but the balsamic vinegar mellows the flavour. Used chicken breast instead of thighs and they were tender and juicy. Two thumbs up!

This was great.  My Husband loved this recipe. 
I made a few modifications.  I added mushrooms at the same time as the garlic. Used chicken breasts instead of leq guarters. The breasts were tender and extremely flavorful.
I also used sun-dried tomatoes with basil in them and added the tomatoes to the chicken broth and vinegar. 
Thank you for the great recipe.  I will be making this again.

This dish was very good, a borderline 5. I also substituted chicken breast. Good flavor and texture. Added sliced mushrooms and saute'd them with the garlic. Sprinkled top with some green onion tops and some Parmasaen cheese. Served over egg noodles, to entice the little ones to try it. A little time consuming but still easy to do. Thanks for the recipe. I am sure we'll use it a bunch.

This recipe sounds good from start to finish, and while it isn't a "quick" meal, it isn't incredibly time-consuming, either.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts sliced in 1-inch strips instead of leg quarters, and they turned out great.  My husband isn't a "leg man"!
Anyway, the next time, I'll omit the sun-dried tomato, as they remained leathery, even after simmering a while with the onion mixture.
My 11-month old enjoyed the chicken, but my 3 1/2-year old was repulsed by the smell of the simmering Balsamic vinegar and wouldn't try the dish!

Wow, the husband loved this one!  Be patient with the stock and vinegar mixture, it takes a while for it to thicken up.  Also, I needed to cook the chicken a lot longer, it just didn't seem done in 20 minutes.

I did not have sun-dried tomatoes . so i drained a can of diced tomatoes. Boy what a wonderful taste this is truly a keeper and we will be making this one often. I had to leave while this was in the oven so i turned it down to 275 and was gone longer then i had hoped. but i tell you it was moist n tender what a wonderful flavor. Thank you for sharing. 8)

excellent. Loved this recipe. I added broccoli as suggested just before putting in the oven. I used the same pan for everything without removing the chicken and onion mixture. Served it with roasted potatoes and cooked it for an hour. The chicken fell off the bone. mmm!

SO GOOD! I only changed one thing. Living in a rural small town I just didn't want to spend $4.00 on a tiny jar of sun dried tomatoes, so I used stewed tomatoes instead and cooked them in the oven along with... Excellent!

This was an awesome recipe.  I had leftover sundried tomatoes in olive oil and herbs, so I omitted the salt and pepper.  My sauce wouldn't thicken so I just kept reducing to about 1/3 the original amount.  When transferred to the oven, it did thicken beautifully.  I served it with boneless breasts.  Will definitely add it to my regular chicken menu rotation.

yummo! i had a whole chicken creeping on its expiration date so i used that instead. i seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and browned it on both sides (skin-side down first). i removed the chicken into a pan and then deglazed the pan with the balsamic and the stock, added the onions and garlic, and simmered the whole mixture for 10-15 minutes. i added the sun-dried tomatoes to the mix and poured it over the chicken, foiled the pan, and popped the whole thing into the oven for 25 minutes. served it with rice - and it was great! thanks! :)

This was very good.  Next time I will use slightly less vinegar and a bit more olive oil.  I think this would also be a great marinade for baked chicken.

This was sooo good! I made 50% more sauce and served it over penne pasta. I also used boneless skinless chicken and added 2 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp spicy sweet mustard to the sauce right before pouring it over the chicken. def will be making this again.

Have made this recipe several times, with great success.  It's very flavorful, so watch out if you don't like strong flavors: we thought it was perfect! Two modifications (I love to experiment): used sundried tomatoes that were in a jar w/olive oil & spices so may have altered the flavor some. Then cut the meat in medallions & cooked in the pan with the sauce for about 15-20 on the stovetop. Still juicy & flavorful. Also made a full batch of the 'sauce' for only 1 lb. of chicken. Next time will probably reduce it, as I ended up tossing the extra.

It was good, but the sauce didn't really thicken until after the left-overs were refrigerated. It also took a while to caramlize the onions. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but for as long as it took, I expected it to be a little better. I will probably make it again, but am more prepared for the prep & wait time.

We truly enjoyed this recipe.  The flavors merry so well together!  Think I might try this atop of rice next time instead of noodles though.  Did add the touch of dijon as others recommended and thought it was a good addition as well as half the amount of onion.  Definitely found a place in my recipe drawer!

You and many, many, many thousands of other cooks have "invented" this recipe.  To all out there who haven't made this recipe yet, it's REALLY hard to make this taste bad, so experiment with your spice rack and impress your lover, kids, family.  Also, one note...the longer you cook it, the better.

This was very good.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I can't remember having or cooking with basalmic before.  It was a nice change of flavor.  Although mine looked nothing like the picture, and it never thickened up but I will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing it wiht us. - Update, Balsamic quickly became my new fav. ingredient after this recipe.  I made this dish again tonight and I decided to just cook it all in the pan on the stove top even though my pan could have gone from stove to oven, but not the lid.  So I was a tad lazy, but it still tasted great :-)  It wasn't really looking all that great, but as the chicken was finishing up and the juice was reducing down, it turned out looking great.  Probably will make it that way again.  Oh, and I never have sun-dried tomatoes either.

My husband and I raved about this meal for days!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and added mushrooms.  I also added a few tablespoons of heavy cream to the balsamic reduction to thicken up the sauce.  Served over angel hair pasta - sooooo good!

This is so good. Also, it is an easy dish to cook.Don't let the balsamic vinegar scare you. This chicken had so much flavor. I did add artichoke hearts and mushrooms but other than that I cooked the recipe exactly as  it is written. It really was very yummy. I will absolutely be making this again.

To solve the thickening issue, roll the chicken in seasoned flour (salt and pepper), I used chicken breast, cooked in a little olive oil until browned. Remove the chicken and then soften the vegetables, I used green and red pepper as well about 2 tsp garlic, minced.  After the vegetables are translucent add the stock and the vinegar (I cut the vinegar in half).  I just simmered on the stove top about 15 to 20 minutes.  The sauce thickened no problems. Good idea just some fine tuning for me.

I really loved this! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and the chicken was so tender. It just fell apart in your mouth. I thought at first the balsamic may be a bit too heavy but it was great. The caramelized onions and sun dried tomatoes made such a great combination with the balsamic sauce. I am definitely making this again!!

It was really good. After reading other reviews we cut back on chicken broth, did half balsamic vinegar and half red. The sundried tomatoes weren't the greatest choice but it was still good.

Though we love everything in this recipe and had high hopes, it really fell flat.  The chicken was so bland.  I actually double checked the recipe after making this, because it seemed as though I must have missed something...but I didn't.  It smelled great but needed lots of garlic salt to make it edible.  Not a recipe we plan on trying again.

This turned out ok in the end, but I really had to change the recipe to make it edible.  I love balsamic vinegar, but there was simply WAY too much of it in here.  It was too overpowering, but I didn't want to waste everything, so I ended up using 3 1/2 cups of broth and adding a small can of petite diced tomatoes to help cut the taste, and using some cornstarch to thicken it.  Then since I had so much sauce I threw in some sliced mushrooms, diced up the chicken and served it over pasta like a goulash.  That went over really well.  My husband actually asked me to make it again but with beef next time.  So the meal was a success, but I can only give the recipe 2 stars because I had to radically change it in order for us to be able to eat it.  If I try to make it again (not as a goulash) I will cut the vinegar at least in half, if not more.

I used breast instead of leg and roasted red peppers instead of sun dried tomatoes as my Husband doesn't like them. The chicken was very tender & the sauce thickned up when I took the cover off for the last 15mins in the oven. It would probably be even better with the tomatoes as they would add more of a sweetness.

Although the recipe sounded good in theory, neither my hubby or I liked the flavor. Took a really long time to make because of the sauce reduction, which never really thickened. Also increased baking time to 30 minutes for chicken tenders to cook through. The balsamic vinegar was VERY overpowering. We couldn't even eat the meal. Will not make again. Sorry.

This is a darn good recipe. I took a slight deviation from this and served it over a bed of cooked spinach (a little garlic and butter on them until the leaves wilt makes them great) and also added some four cheese ravioli. I'd be careful about boiling off all of the chicken stock / vinegar, however. The mixture doesn't get quite thick like you'd expect after reading the description, so you'll have to keep an eye on it. I added about 1TBSP butter to this to smooth out the flavor a bit and it worked great. Also, consider adding some stir fried mushrooms as part of the mix. During the bake, all of these flavors come together for a truly + dish!

This was just okay for me, but my husband loved it.  My only changes were to use 2 large breasts cut into strips, to do the whole thing in an oven-safe skillet so I didn't have to transfer to a casserole, and then to thicken the sauce a bit with cornstarch.  I served over pasta.  I thought the vinegar was overwhelming, but I might try again with less.

This was fantastic.  I used chicken breasts instead of the legs and only 1 cup of chicken broth.  I let the chicken marinade in the broth and vinegar and the chicken came out so moist you could cut it with a fork.  I am not sure what the person meant saying the sauce would thicken.  It doesn't and wouldn't there is no thickening agent.  None the less it was good.

I loved the sauce even though it didn't thicken for me.  The chicken on the other hand took much longer to cook and really didn't have a lot of flavor.  Next time I'll use boneless, skinless breasts and maybe even cut it up like one of the other users did.

Everyone chowed down on this recipe! I will definitely be adding this to one of my favorites. I did not change it an anyway in terms of ingredients, but my method was a bit different. After sauteing the onions and garlic, I removed them from the pot. I figured to try and brown the chicken along with the onion and garlic would result in the vegetables being burned. I reintroduced those two ingredients when I combined the chicken stock and vinegar. I also added the sun-dried tomatoes at this time because it seemed to make more sense to add them to the sauce, then pour over the chicken. It was great!

Just made this for the first time and we loved it.  I used the suggestions of adding mustard and butter after reducing the sauce.  I cut the onions in half and then thinly sliced rather than chopping them.  Used chicken breasts and thighs.  For those who think the amount of liquid should be cut in half, I wonder if their sauces reduced properly.  This website has good articles on how to reduce sauces and caramelize onions.  Love allrecipes.com!

Oddly enough, the day I read this recipe I too was wondering what to make with the legs & thighs that I thawed out! And i had all of these ingredients except the tomatoes and balsamic vinegar, but I had a whole bottle of red wine vinegar. It came out wonderful. It's perfect for a quick weeknight meal!

The idea and recipe was great. I went from the reviews and changed it up a bit. I used boneless chkn thighs, seasoned them w/salt and pepper and let them sit while I preapared everything else. I sauteed the onions, garlic, and mushrooms until semi-soft. Remove from the pan and began frying the chkn on both sides until a bit fried. Put cooked chkn in baking dish, topped it with fresh tomatos and sauteed mix. Then I poured the sauce over that. I baked mine at 350 for 30min. I also added brown sugar to the sauce and cornstarch to thicken it. It came out great.

I have to say, I did this dish according to the original instructions, unlike most of the other cooks, and it was not spectacular by any means. It tasted like plain baked chicken... maybe it would've tasted better if I put spaghetti sauce on it.

Overall this recipe was ok. It did make the chicken fall off the bone tender though. Fairly easy to make just a bit time consuming browning the chicken and reducing the sauce. My sauce also didnt thicken up as the recipe stated next time I would use a thickening agent. It was also a bit bitter or vinagary for me. after tasting it I ened up adding some brown sugar to the sauce and that gave it just the bit of sweetness that I felt it needed. With those changes I give it 4 stars.

Oh my God, this is delicious!  My parents loved this. I did add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce but it didn't really thicken.  I also just added more like a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. I do have to agree with other reviewers -- this makes A LOT of sauce.  I used 10 chicken thighs and the sauce was already half-bathing the chicken.  Still tasted delicious though, and kept the chicken moist. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I used the chicken quarters instead of breast.  Next time I will us the chicken breast.  Definetly needs to cook on medium.  I cooked it too high and burned the onions.  I will try this again though, but with chicken breast.

This recipe is amazing. We were trying to figure out if we wanted pasta or rice to accompany this, but after making it the first time slices of french bread are the way to go. It is perfect for soaking up all the left over deliciousness left over.
The leftovers were good, just be aware that the longer the sun-dried tomatoes sit the stronger the flavor becomes.
We will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe was really good. I had to substitute red peppers for the sun dried tomatoes but other wise that is the only change I made. The sauce never really thickened but it didn't matter it was so good. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay. The chicken was juicy but no very flavorful. I ended up eating the onions from the sauce and no very much chicken. I enjoyed the sauce very much as did my husband, so I may have to find a way to use it in other recipes.

Quite good combo of flavors. I also added some dijon mustard to the sauce prior to adding to the chicken, but it still didn't thicken that much. I was worried that the balsamic would be overpowering, but it wasn't. I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil.

Just ok - I was looking for a South Beach (phase 1) friendly meal, and thought I'd give this a try.  It needs something to round out the flavors.  Also, 1/2 c balsamic vinegar was too much, and I found the sauce a bit acidic.  I'd like to try again by reducing the balsamic to 1/4 c and adding some spices...maybe rosemary?  Thyme?

This was great.  I might cut back the balsamic next time.  My husband LOVED this meal!  Will make again. I served with Zucchini soup and Mushroom rice.  YUM!

This was delicious. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I substituted dried cherries and it worked like a charm. FYI: The chicken took a little longer in the oven than directed and I also increaded the heat on the onions when they were carmelizing because it was going slowly on low. Would definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This was ok, nothing special.  It really needs something to brighten it, maybe lemon juice and rosemary?  I followed the directions and never got the sauce to thicken, so I added butter and dijon.  But the sauce still didn't thicken much.  In all fairness, I'd doubled the recipe.  Even accounting for the extra ingredients, the bake time was way off.  With 4 chicken quarters, my bake time was ~45 minutes.  We served over rice; noodles would be ok too.

Used skinless breasts and it turned out excellent. A very nice flavour and the sun dried tomatoes are a nice touch and yet another interesting addition to this. Thanks for the Recipe !

WOW!  What a great recipe!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead and it came out just as good.  I was so glad I had all of the ingredients on hand!  Definately a make-again one!

Very yummy. Added 1 tsp of dijon and 2 tsp of brown sugar to sauce. Added some mushrooms in as well before baking in oven. Thickened at the end with a Tbsp of flour. Very very yummy!

I did as suggested by others, put a drizzle of balsamic and chicken broth over the chicken, baked it and reduced the sauce on the stove.  Then poured it on top when chicken was done and cooked it another 5 minutes - fabulous~

At first the sauce wouldn't thicken, then it turned into tar. I followed the recipe exactly except I used chicken breasts. Super bland. I would have added at least SOME herbs had I known! Oh and the smell was awful. I live in an apartment and the entire floor stunk! You could smell it all the way to the elevators and I'm in the back. I've made balsamic reductions before, but for some reason this one smelled uber bad. I'm giving it two stars because after it wasn't thickening at all, I accidentally thickened it too much and well, it came out like tar. It's been really hard scraping it off of my utensils. Anyway, if I ever make something like this again I would add some fresh herbs, or dry herbs, or any herbs! Just something to give it some oomph!

WOW!  What a great recipe!  DELICIOUS!  I did make a few changes though- used chicken breasts and just pan fried them.  Removed the chicken and used the pan to combine garlic, balsamic, chicken stock, a little white wine and Stone Kitchen Balsamic Onions!  WOW!  Then poured over the chicken.  I really think the premade balsamic onions were out of this world...

I had some left-over sun dried tomatoes in the fridge and didn't want to do a pasta dish so decided to cook this. I read the reviews beforehand and I'm glad I did. The balsamic vinegar would have been overwhelming if I followed the original recipe.   I used 4 chicken breasts, cut it to strips, sprinkled with garlic salt and let it marinate in the fridge for 2-3 hours. Then I browned the onions, garlic and chicken in the pan and transferred them to baking dish. I used 1c chicken broth, 1/4c red wine and 1/4c balsamic vinegar. The sauce didn't thicken for me so I also used some cornstarch to help it along. Transferred to baking dish and baked for 20 mins. Hubby and I loved it. I would probably skip the baking part next time and just let it simmer on the stove.  Given that there's too much modification to the original recipe, I'm only giving this 2 stars. It would have been un-eatable as written. Good idea though.

This recipe was way to strong for my taste. The balsamic colored the whole dish black and was unappetizing. I didn't taste the sun dried tomatoes at all, either. It also took a lot of time to prepare.

delicious! I served with baked potatoes, and used some of the remaining juice as gravy... after squashing the potatoes on my plate, it tasted as if I'd made a German Potato Salad!! Will certainly make again -- although I think I'll add some additional vegetables to go with it, and/or serve with a salad.

Nice balance of flavors but be sure to use a good quality balsamic vinegar, otherwise I'm sure it will taste vinegarly. I actually had enough sauce for 4 quarters.

I gave this two stars because the sauce was just OK by itself - it was a little too sour with the vinegar.  Served over pasta, it was not very good.  It was like eating vingar flavored gravy over noodles.  I probably won't make it again.

This recipe was fantastic. I got many compliments from family members. I made it with white rice and it went well with it. However, I stirred onion and garlic together for 5 minutes and then added chops of chicken to it till the chicken was brown on all sides. I also used chicken breast and it tasted excellent. I am going to cook this later for sure.

I didn't care for this dish at all.Based on other reviewers comments, I tried using chicken breasts instead of leg quarters but, we found the sauce too overpowering and not at all tasty. You really have to love Balsamic Vinegar if you use this recipe -- I don't think I would give this recipe a second try either.

The chicken was very tender but the flavor was a bit too sweet for my liking. I had to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce because it was taking too long. Might try again, the sauce seems like it could be pretty good with a few modifications.

Loved this one so much, my boyfriend and I had it 2 nights in a row.  We didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I substituted garlic vinegar and it was yummy.  Also, neither one of is fond of sun dried tomatoes so we left that out.  It was still fabulous!

I wanted to use up the rest of our sun dried tomatoes but my husband loved the dish so much that now I'll have to keep buying the tomatoes! I used chicken tenders and, after sauteeing,  simmered them in the sauce rather than baking in the oven. Because I used 5 tenders, there was just the right amount of sauce. We froze the leftovers and reheated in the microwave - delish on the night we cooked it and on leftover night.

This recipe is a winner for my family. Very fast and easy to make, we loved the flavor. The only changes I made were to use 2 large chicken breasts, 4 shallots (out of onion),reduced the balsamic to 1/3 cup (my balsamic is strong), and added 1 tbs of butter to the stock and balsamic mixture. I sampled the sauce before adding it to the chicken, soooo good! I didn't expect the sauce to thicken, I let it cook until it reduced to about half. There is a lot of sauce but the more the better! I will make this again and again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was pretty good but for as much balsamic that was in there, I was suprised it didn't have a ton of flavor. I think it needed to go over mashed potatoes to catch all the flavor. One note - it doesn't say how long this recipe takes - the onions take a very long time to caramelize and the sauce doesn't ever really thicken. I wasn't sure how long I was supposed to let it simmer before it thickened and it was evaporating fast so I gave up after about 10 minutes. I also forgot to cover the dish before it went in the oven so I'll need to try this again - maybe I'll add mushrooms next time. Thanks for an interesting recipe!

This was spectacularly good. And here's the thing: instead of using chicken thighs, I used a cut-up, whole roasted chicken from the store, since that's what I had. After making the sauce (and I used beef stock, instead of chicken, because that's what I had), the only thing I changed was to cook the whole dish at a low temperature, covered, for about an hour, just so that the chicken could heat up and the flavors could combine. I'm not a great fan of sun-dried tomatoes, but I definitely encourage you to use them, since they added a great depth of flavor to the dish. I served it with the ravioli on the side, along with some winter vegetables. Everyone absolutely loved it, and it was a great, easy solution to a last minute dinner.

Pretty good, but the basalmic flavor is strong. I used vegetable stock (b/c that is what I had). I also used chicken breast instead of the legs to decrease the fat content. Other short cuts included minced garlic instead of cloves. Lastly, I sauteed some spinach into it at the end (so it doesn't burn). I served this over bow-tie pasta. It is a lot of acid with the vinegar, and sundried tomato. I added some parmesan cheese to help cut all the acid as it cooked.

This was really good, but I had to alter it a bit and I would change a few things for the future. I'm only giving this a 4 because some things didn't work as expected. I changed the recipe serving to 4 and used boneless chicken breasts instead. I sauteed the onions on medium, not on low as suggested because it was taking too much time. When it called for adding garlic I added 4 sliced fresh mushrooms, too. I tried thickening the sauce as stated, but it wasn't working. Therefore I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I found that the amount of sun-dried tomatoes made the sauce a bit too sweet for me so in the future I would maybe use 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. The amount of sauce was a lot so in the future I would probably make this and put it over white rice. Otherwise cutting the sauce to half would probably work too. Overall it was really good!

Very good recipe. My husband loved it. As with others I used boneless skinless chicken breast because that is what I had on hand. I also replaced the sundried tomatoes with oven roasted tomatoes & garlic, fresh from my garden.  Yummy!

Easy to make. Not time consuming at all. I added extra garlic. continually basted the chicken, didn't have sun dried tomatoes so they were left out. Still tasted great

As written, this recipe is pretty good, although it does take forever. I've started using chicken breasts pounded thin and just finishing them on the stove instead of putting them in the oven. I brown the chicken, remove it from the pan, make the sauce and let that cook down and then add the chicken back to the pan. I find the chicken tastes better this way and it doesn't take nearly as long, so I can make it on a work night. Another good idea is to add some sliced mushrooms the same time you add the garlic.

Too much vinegar flavor. It's possible that I did not cook the sauce enough, though. I served it with potato dumplings and green beans. Added mushrooms, which tasted great.

It was just OK. I had bought some lovely looking sun dried tomatoes at the market and was looking for what to make with them... The sundried tomatoes were really overpowering in this. The chicken was good, and my sauce did not thinken either- but it was good with pasta.  My husband described it as "alright." He said the chicken was good, but the tomatoes were too much. Im glad I tried it but I wont make it again.

The first time I made this it was great- second time, not so much. The juice was really runny, so I'm not sure what happened. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, so maybe that was the problem. Other than that, great recipe! I love the sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar!

I wanted to make something different and I saw this recipe and thought my family would like it. My daughter likes balsamic dressing. I used boneless chicken which was fine but I always sesaon chicken first even if it doesn't tell you to in a recipe. It helps the sauce stick to the chicken.  I only had sun dried tomatoe paste so I only put in a big tablespoon. I didn't know how it was going to taste. At first when I tasted it it had a very strong balsamic taste so I added a tiny dash of sugar. After if cooked in the oven it was fine. I would make.

I was going to give it 3 stars because it didn't turn out as I hoped but my husband really liked the flavour so I am giving it a 4, and will try it again to improve upon this rating. Took a long time because of the time taken to try to reduce the sauce and it was still runny after 20 minutes. Took 30 minutes to cook the chicken (used boneless thighs). It was swimming in juice. I will try again but try to thicken the sauce and give myself more time to prepare this dish. I substituted yellow pepper and black olives for the sundried tomatos which I didn't have. My husband really liked the additions. This dish has great potential, just needs a little tweeking for the sauce thickening. Not too vinegary at all, just mild tasting. I really love balsamic vinegar. That is probably why I am a bit disappointed in the thin-ness of the sauce. I wanted it to stick more.

I was really disappointed with this dish. I only changed the leg quarters to breasts, but followed all other directions exactly. It was way to much of a time investment for what I felt was an just an okay dish.  My kids complained about the pungent smell of the balsamic and my son said that onion taste was overpowering. I love both balsamic and onions; I think this would be better suited sliced on top of greens rather than stand alone entree. I will not make this again, it just didn't fit our tastes.

I really enjoyed this and so did my boyfriend. I used thin chicken breasts and added a little dry mustard and some Italian spices. Reducing and baking the vinegar mixture makes it musky and creamy rather than biting the tongue. Instead of sun-dried tomatoes, I cut cherry tomatoes in half and stirred them in for 2 minutes while the onions were still on the grille... definitely a "make again"!

Very yummy dinner. I am teaching my husband to cook for the family since I am having our second child soon and he will need to take over some of the duties of the house. So pretty much he took over cooking this dish. It turned out great. We had to bake longer than 20 mins more like 35 mins. We used chicken breasts but pretty much stuck to the recipe. Ill add to my dinner main dishes. Thanks!

Changed to 2 bone-in chicken breasts, and 1 can drained diced tomatoes, since I didn't have any sun-dried on hand.  This was really good.

This was very tasty and easy however, the sauce never thickened even after following some of the other peoples suggestions and adding the mustard and butter. I will try this again but next time add some flour so that the sauce will thicken. I also suggest caramelizing the onions on medium heat rather than low that will take way too long.

I made this exactly as written (except using 3 breasts instead of legs) and it tastes very good as is!  My sauce only thickened slightly before I ran out of time and had to put it in the oven, it still tasted wonderful over white rice, and the chicken came out flavorful too.  I will make this again and next time I may cut back on the sauce including onion and sun dried tomatoes. I had a ton left over and ended up throwing it out.  That should shorten the thickening time too.

I loved this recipe, although I doubled everything for the sauce and had about 9 leg quarters.  The sauce didn't thicken, but it was wonderful.  I added quite a bit of fresh ground pepper and cooked it for 30-45 minutes.

It was okay. The sauce didn't thicken without adding cornstarch. It took about 1/2 hour for the chicken to cook.  It was moist but didn't soak up the sauce flavor. Flavor was just average, even though I added the butter, mustard and threw in some mushrooms. I ended up with about 2 cups of sauce left over!

I never measure anything so I eyeballed the recipe and used breasts instead of legs. My husband loved it. I think next time I will add basil as another reviewer suggested. The chicken was really moist and the sauce was delish!

A little to strong with the onions for me. Next time I will just slice the onions so I can take then out after the meal cooks as well as use less onions.

This is an excellent chicken dish.  i did however substitute with boneless breast and diced tomato's.  it was quite delicious.  i used the left over chicken from this recipe in my homemade chicken noodle soup and it added a wonderful flavor to the soup.

Excellent taste.  Coats the chicken really well.  I thought the finished gravy was a little thin.  That would be the only complaint I have for this entire recipe.  Otherwise excellent all the way around.

I just made this for dinner tonight and thought is was pretty darn tasty...a tad bit too sweet, but I will definately make it again! I dipped the chicken breasts in a mix of flour, pepper and salt before cooking them. I also sauteed the onions and garlic in a different pan from the chicken, but once the chicken had browned, I added them to that pan and started making the sauce. I took the advcice from another review and added the butter and dijon mustard! Very smart because it cuts some of the sweetness. I also added another tsp of pepper. Overall it's a good recipe!

My family REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  I'm definitely going to make it again.  Very juicy chicken.  The only change I made to this recipe is I used enough chicken to feed 4 people.  I didn't have to increase any of the ingredients either.

This was very good, but the sauce never thickened for me. I followed it exactly as it was written. It still tasted excellent, it was just drowning in the liquid. I'd make it again, just use a lot less of the stock and the vinegar.

Very nice flavour.  I used sundried tomatoes marinated in olive oil chopped relatively finely and they were soft enough after the 15 min in the oven.  I did find that the liquid reduced but did not really thicken, so make sure you have lots of rice to sop it up.  The more I make this dish, the more I like it!  Thanks!

I cooked this recipe along with butternut squash risotto and asparagus.  We had company and there were no leftovers even though I made plenty of extra.  It was delicious.  I used a whole chicken that I cut into parts.  This is definitely a recipe I will repeat.

This is really delicious, I was hesitant at first because I didn't think it would have enough flavor.  I was so pleased with this--it is very tasty and very easy to make.  I served it over rice---truly yummy.  It's definately a keeper.

Sounded questionable, but really was excellent!!  Don't skimp out on the onions or sun-dried tomatoes!

This recipe turned out very well.  I followed the suggestions of the person who said to cook the chicken and make the sauce while it's cooking and it turned out very well.  I also made a few other changes due to lack of ingredients: 1. I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar, so I did about 1/4c. balsamic and 1/4c. apple cider vinegar.  It turned out fine.  2. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so I used drained diced tomatoes.  I really like this addition.  It adds something with a little more substance, especially when you serve it over pasta.  A great recipe!

Very good!  Definitely takes some time to make because of browning the chicken and then making a reduction sauce.  I also had to cook the chicken for about 45min in the oven since it wasn't cooked through in the amount of time given.  

But this was overall the best recipe I've ever had for bone-in dark meat chicken...which I normally don't like.  Yet this was wonderfully moist and flavorful!  I served over bowtie pasta and we all gobbled it up!

Very good.  We used regular chicken breasts instead but it was perfect.  Maybe less sauce next time.  A little over half what we had this time would be fine.  Very rich in flavor.

We had mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli on the side.  Great sides.  Warm and hearty meal. :)

This was delicious!  I would give it 5 stars, but I changed a few things.  I didn't have stock on hand so I used broth.  And I added rosemary to the onion and garlic before I put the chicken in the skillet, I did this to tie the flavors into the roasted new potatoes that I made to go with it.

Ok I made this one tonight and Oh my God what a hit....I did not have enough balsamic vinegar, only about 1/4 cup so I added white white to make up the difference....this was so good..my guests were raving, the liquid was used to wet the rice when I served it and how tasty it was.  I will absolutely make this again

VERY VERY GOOD. I did have to change one thing. I used 1 1/2 cups chicken gravy instead of chicken stock because I did not have stock or broth on hand. This was a fantastic meal. My husband loved it.
Thank You

Wow! This is the first review I was compelled to write! This was absolutely delicious!!! This is definately one of the best dishes I've ever made- the sauce is to die for! My only change was that I used chicken breast, I should have pounded it out, it was a little thick and got a little tough..next time I will definately use a thinner cut. I served this over wild mushroom couscous, and poured the sauce over it...I wish I took a picture. Again, DELICIOUS!! Thank you!

This turned out pretty okay. I think it would have been better to season the chicken independently, and then reduce the amount of the chicken broth/balsamic mixture. I ended up with quite a bit of leftover sauce when I made it for a serving size of 2.  The only changes I made tot he recipe were: I added 2 tbsp of butter, and 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard along with the dried tomatoes to the chicken broth/balsamic mixture, and simmered it for about 15 minutes. It does not thicken, it is a loose sauce. I also baked the chicken for 25 minutes, then I removed the cover,and changed the oven over to broil for 5 minutes, turning the chicken only once while broiling.  I would try certainly try it again. If you like the taste of tomatoes, the dried tomatoes cooked into the broth give it a really nice smoky taste. Thanks for the great recipe idea.

This was pretty good.  It had a nice flavor that I enjoyed, it just wasn't my favorite.  It did take a little time to make and it was a little too salty, despite using low-sodium broth.  I thickened the sauce on the stovetop before pouring it over the chicken.  I baked it a little longer than 30 minutes.  I baked this in a 7x11 pan and used 2 chicken breasts.  The chicken was extremely tender!  Served with Garlic Roasted Cauliflower and brown/wild rice.

I used 4 chicken drumsticks for this recipe (all that I had on hand).  I  also used some grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried and everything came out well.  I would just tweak it for whatever you have in the pantry that you need to get rid of (I also added Kalamata Olives).  I might make this again for company.

the cooking time was way off!  it should be more like 45 min at 375 degrees.  i served it over brown rice.  my  1 & 3 year olds loved it!  i was too frustated about making sure the meat was cooked enough to enjoy.  i may try again.

Sorry, this recipe didn't even get cooked to point of eating. I scaled the recipe down to two & it seemed to be way off, so maybe that was the problem. It ended up calling for way too much chicken broth & too much balsamic vinegar. I have to order something for dinner now. Again, this may have been my fault but it wasn't going well in cooking process. Sorry, won't make again.

Very good and classy! I added a tbsp of cornstarch as the recipe was unclear on how the sauce should thicken. Added maple syrup as well, to balance the strong vinegar taste. Don't rate it 5 stars because it's quite time-consuming. Rather for a casual occasion than for a weeknight fix!

I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I just used a can of roasted tomatoes and added honey to offset the sour of the vinegar that I had. The sauce took a very long time to thicken and after 45 minutes just stopped because I still had to bake the chicken for 45 minutes. I thought this would be somewhat quick but this recipe took a long time!! Overall it was

I enjoy this flavorful meal.  I serve it over rice.  I also use diced tomatoes as when I shopped for it the first time I couldn't find the sun dried tomatoes so I improvised, and it works well either way.  Glad I found this recipe on my go-to recipe site!

We really liked the flavors in this....Though it will depend on the quality of balsamic vinegar you use.  Hubby liked it and commented it is "rich".  It is but tasty!  Thanks for the recipe. I will make again with chicken thighs.

Used wine vinegar instead of balsamic, to placate my children. Also left out the sun-dried tomatoes. A most worthy use of my garden-grown onions!

Followed the recipe as written and thought were results were just okay. The instructions say to caramelize the onions, then briefly saute the garlic, then add the chicken pieces to the same pan to brown, but this resulted  in the aromatics overcooking. The chicken did come out very tender but the flavor was nothing special. Overall this recipe was more trouble than it was worth.

This was incredibly easy....I had my 23 year old son do it while I watched. The sun-dried tomatoes made this especially savory. The chicken was moist & tasty. I would make this again.

Amazing! Great for a quick fix meal with a couple of changes.  I substituted Whole bone-in chicken breasts mostly for presentation. Like previous posts, I added some of the sauce and let the chicken cook while reducing the rest of the sauce in the saucepan to save time. I skipped the mustard recommendation. Once plated, I sprinkled with fresh chopped basil which was a natural with the tomatoes, garlic and balsamic vinegar, and served it with buttered fettucini and steamed broccoli.  MMMM  we will be having this again!

I used 4 chicken quarters instead of two, but kept the rest the same, and there was still a lot of sauce. The balsamic vinegar and the tomatoes made a really great flavor combination. I added the tomatoes to the stock reduction right after deglazing the pan (before it had reduced) to make sure that they got nice and soft. Really good recipe!

So good! Added the tomatoes while the chicken was cooking to soften a bit and added a little lemon juice and Dijon mustard to the sauce.

Delicious!  Will most definitely be making this again - hubby LOVED it!  Used six skinless chicken thighs, as we prefer dark meat.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, so substituted a drained can of petite diced tomatoes (substituted the drained juice for some of the broth).  Also, I doubled the onions, because we love onions!  Others have suggested mushrooms, which I think would be delicious, but didn't add them, as DH doesn't like them.  Used a little corn starch to help with the thickening process of the balsamic-broth mixture.  Lengthened the cooking time to 1 hour, as my chicken was only halfway thawed, and it came out fall-off-the-bone tender, and really juicy.  Served over jasmine rice - FABULOUS!   A definite keeper!

Needed a little tweaking but overall tasty. Added some bouillon made a few other changes as per previous reviews. I will make it again. Added a Tbsp butter and Dijon mustard to sauce after having poured half the sauce over chicken to bake.

This took a little longer to prepare than I thought due to caramelizing the onion, but it was well worth the wait. Nice, slightly tangy flavor.

This recipe was fabulous!! I served it over plain white rice, which absorbed the flavors of the sauce beautifully! Will definitely make this again!!

Tasty. Increased this to six servings. Divided the stock and vinegar in half and cooked the chicken in some, and used the rest to make a the sauce on the stove-top.

I didnt realize this was going to be so time consuming.. not hours but longer than I expected.  I cooked for the firehouse and used boneless skinless chicken breast, and had some leftover sweet red peppers that i used in place of the tomatoes.  The stock/vinegar mixture never did thicken for me, and it was boiling/simmering for quite a long time.  I had pounded the chicken breasts flat, which cut down on the baking time but I thinnk this would take much longer with thicker chicken.  The sauce was very good to soak up with bread, but the chicken itself was actually pretty bland, it didnt seem to absorb any of the flavor of the vinegar or onion.  I will try this again when I have more time to baby it, because i love vinegar :)

I just made this for the first time because of the favourable reviews and served it along with Sarah's Rice Pilaf on this site. Both were delicious! Chicken was moist and flavourful. I just threw whole garlic cloves into the onion mixture instead of mincing them, which can turn them bitter when cooked for a long time. When they roast in the oven, they become sweet and tender. Both recipes are definite keepers!

Lots and lots of flavor, although my sauce did not really reduce.  I think I would reduce the amount of chicken stock to 1 cup next time.  Chicken was very tender.  I served with Cilantro-Garlic potatoes (also on allrecipes.com) and roasted fresh asparagus for a colorful and tasty Sunday dinner.

I can't understand how this recipe was rated so highly. My conclusion is that people who rate it highly only try this recipe if they already love balsamic vinegar so much that they are looking for ways to use it in everything they cook. Although I decreased the amount of vinegar by almost half, it still overpowered the sauce but not in a good earthy way I was hoping it would. The broth only watered down the bitter balsamic flavor and it did not create anything remotely close to what was described, nor did it give the chicken any flavor. I cut into a piece and tasted it before serving and it tasted like it had been poached in water. I ended up saving the dinner by adding 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard, 4 tablespoons raw honey (the solid kind), and some curry powder. The original result was not good and will surely never be tried again. Next time before I start cooking a new recipe I will definitely read the most recent reviews, not just the 'most helpful' that show up under the recipe.
