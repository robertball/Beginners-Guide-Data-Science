I made this exactly as the recipie called for and it was - just OK - it seemed to lack any convincing flavor of anything in particular - there was no evidence of clams unless you happened to get one in your  spoon - my overall impression was - too bland - so, toward the end of the 20 minute simmer I added a bay leaf and, a dash of celery salt, and a dash of basil - that helped some - if I make it again, I think I'll start with something like bacon drippings instead of plain butter

I am always trying out different clam chowder recipes.  Although none are as good as my mothers!  This one is a keeper.  I have served it now a few times and always get raves.  I do add just a hint of sherry occasionally and always top the bowl of with a small pat of butter and a sprinkle of paprika.

Excellent recipe. The only thing I do differently is to cook a few strips of diced bacon along with the onion and celery and reduce the butter slightly to compensate for the added fat.. I have used regular milk or half and half cream instead of evaporated milk also.

Very nice for sure!  I did some mods that you may like.  Changes are:  3 cans of clams, 3 potatoes, 2/3 teaspoon thyme, 2/3 cup flour, 3-5 cloves of garlic, 1 Stock of Leek.  Make the roux as stated THEN add in the Leek and go from there.  Make sure you add your extra water slow as if you over do it, yuck.....water soup!   Have fun and enjoy.

This is my very favorite homemade clam chowder recipe.  I make this now rather than buy it or eat it out.  I add a lot more seasonings - especially garlic powder and I add dill, celery salt, and garlic salt for a really good taste.

This was sooooooooo good!  Since several of the reviews suggested adding more clams, I added a 3rd can of  chopped, rather than minced clams, along with a little garlic powder and a wee bit of dill. It was terrific.  Definitely a keeper!

This was so good. It was very creamy and smooth. I think I ended up adding 2 cups of water (the recipe doesn't tell you a certain amount). I'll definately make this again.

What a wonderfully delicious and filling chowder.  We loved it, in fact I served it to a large family gathering and everyone loved it.  I did add three ingredients to it that I felt would give it a little more flavor - 1 tsp. crushed garlic and 1/2 tsp. basil & 1/2 tsp. cilantro.

This is one of the best recipes.  I love that it's made with evaporated milk rather than cream because it's still as creamy of a soup, but I can buy skim evaporated milk to save some fat and calories.  And it's mostly ingredients that I can keep in the pantry for a day when I'm craving clam chowder.  I should note that I do substitute the water for chicken broth to add a bit more flavour, use three cans of clams instead of two, and double the potatoes (I like it thick and chunky).  Sometimes I also add corn.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing :)

This is a really good base recipe that lends itself well to addition. The second time I made it, I used two slices of fatty bacon and 1/4 cup butter because I like bacon, and I added another potato out of preference, and 1/2 cup of white wine.

The first time I made my husband (from the east coast) clam chowder, he informed me that 'real' clam chowder doesn't have bacon in it.  I've been on a search for 'real' clam chowder ever since.  At last, I've found it.  I made this chowder just the way it was written, and I wouldn't change a thing.   The consistency is perfect and the subtle flavours are spot on.  Thanks for the post.

Wonderful it has a lovely cream. I recommend to make it with real milk and cream (about 1 cup of milk, and 1/2 cup of cream). I also must warn you not to try adding too much clams, I added 4 ounces to many and my sister complained that its was too fishy.

This is a fantastic basic chowder recipe.  I added chopped bacon, paprika and used a lot of whole baby clams.  I also used more spices than what's called for and it was very tasty....Yummy.

DELICIOUS***  beware, you'll want to eat a gallon of it!   I cut a bit of fat by using 2 Tbsp butter, made roux with 1/4 cup of flour, then added half of a bottle of clam juice to the other 1/4 cup of flour, blending it well before adding it to the pan.  I then added the rest of the bottle of clam juice with the reserved juice from the clam cans, then the water.   I also used fat-free evaporated milk and added 1/2 cup of thinly sliced baby carrots.   Big-time keeper!

this was very good. i added some garlic, carrots, dill, and a few dashes of hot sauce and cajun spice to give it a few more levels of flavor. to me this had the perfect consistency and you can spice it up to your liking. i used 2/3 c nonfat dry milk with 3/4 c water as a sub for the evaporated milk. it worked great. i added exactly 2 c of water and 2 tsp clam base for the added clam flavor.  was very good w/ Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread

I salute you!  My cupboard was particularly bare when I needed a base recipe for clam chowder.  I had canned clams, and always have evaporated milk on hand.

This is a great recipe.  I served it with hearty garlic bread, and we were happy campers.  Thank you!

Awesome clam chowder! Thick and creamy and delicious. I used whole baby clams instead of minced and served it with lightly toasted, thick slices of garlic bread (we ALWAYS have garlic bread with soup/chowder/stew). Thanks Gail!

Amazing! I just would have cooked the veggetables a little longer so they were a little less crispy...for some reason the tender crisp  worked though...but I still think it would have tasted a little better softer. Also, I added the recommended amount of liquid, but since my husband and I like our chowder uber thick we ended up adding more flour to get it back to the level of thickness we like. So I guess depending on how thick you like it, Id play it by ear.

Really great recipe, but it needs more flavor.  I added some garlic powder, and I think next time I make it I will add some garlic with the onions and celery.  I only used 2 cans of clams and I will add a third one next time I make it.

This is a very good basic, classic clam chowder recipe. I added chopped bacon, but otherwise used the recipe as is. Loved the addition of thyme - don't skip it!

I added bay leaf, bacon, and some extra seasonings and it was great - the bacon didn't add much to it so wouldn't use bacon next time, unless it was as a topping, which would have been super yummy :) This was very thick and creamy, would make it again.

Great soup! I added bacon and used less butter, but it just didn't quite taste like clam chowder. Next time I will probably add clam juice instead of the water or another can of clams. . . It did taste wonderful though!

This clam chowder was exceptional!  With a little minced garlic and a bit of parsley my family enjoyed this immensely.  Was glad to see it is Military Style, as we also know a Military chef who made this.

This was a fabulous recipe, I added one can of chopped clams, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  My husband who 'hates' clams LOVED this, and even had it for lunch the next day!  Thank you.

Excellent. This clam chowder was sooo good. I added a few extras to it though. Some garlic powder, a bay leaf and I didn't have celery so I used celery seed. Very yummy

This is an easy recipe with great, basic ingredients.  I like that there are only two cans of clams because I like my soup less fishy. I used fat free half and half instead of evaporated milk, and added a little bit of bacon pieces.  I agree with another reviewer that said the water ends up being around 2 cups.  The only reason I gave this recipe a lower rating is because of the thyme.  I only added half of the called for amount and the thyme still over powered the soup.  I would leave out the thyme completely on the next batch.  I would say without the thyme this would be a five star recipe. So easy and so good!

This was a great recipie.  I used the suggestion of adding the bacon and substituted a combination of 1/2& 1/2 cream and milk instead of the evaporated milk suggested. The soup was a big hit.  I would add some garlic or other flavourings besides salt and pepper in it next time I made it to give it a little bit more flavouring.

This was wonderful, it was so thick and creamy. I cooked 4 bacon strips, and then sauteed the onion (didn't have any celery) in the bacon fat. I did add a little bit of olive oil to help make the roux. I used 3 cans of clams and an extra potato to make the chowder hearty. I also sprinkled in some garlic powder. I can't wait for lunch so I can eat the rest of this chowder.

This is a very tasty, easy recipe.  I have made it several times and it always turns out great.  Have been guilty of adding extra clams, though.  Give it a try.  I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do!

This is GREAT clam chowder!  I was out of thyme, so substitued a little basil.  Also added 1/2 teaspoon each of dill weed and garlic powder.  Yum!!  I see no reason to ever buy canned clam chowder again - this is just as easy to make, and tastes much better!

Good recipe! 4 out of 5 people in our house loved this; 15yo son wouldn't even try it, thinks clams are slimy and gross.  I used leftover boiled potatoes that I mashed slightly with potato masher before adding clams when rest of soup had heated up.  I used previous reviewers ideas of using Old Bay Seasoning and Basil, as well as a small bottle of Clam Juice and 3 cans of minced clams.   Served it with Pecan Sticky Buns by Stefanie Sellars.  Wonderful, hearty meal.  Thanks Gail.

If used as a camp-style recipe, the boxed log-life milk tastes closer to fresh milk and is just as easy.  Long-life milk (not a trade name) is available in skim, 1%, 2%, and whole. Also, for slightly more clam flavor, use 1 or more bottles of clam juice instead of water.

I think this is a perfect chowder that avoids the heavy creams and comes really close to the thickness that you might desire.I fooled my daughter hwen she came on college break looking for that thick/rich "out to dinner taste"

I like the simplicity of the recipe. I do think if needs more flavor. I sprinkle some basil and also added garlic powder. If one used fish stock instead of water, that can also make the soup more fishy. I do nuke the pot

Tried it because the list of ingredients was stuff I normally have on hand.  All I needed was canned clams.  It made a thick, substantial clam chowder.  Perhaps the seasoning could be turned  up a bit (bacon bits? more onion???) But  I'm pleased enough with this basic recipe that I will definitely make it again and perhaps tweak the seasoning.

Really easy and delicious! I used three cans of clams, a bottle of clam juice (in place of water), extra potatoes, and three cans of milk, as I have a bunch to feed. Also dill weed in place of thyme. A hit!

Pre-baked potatoes before peeling and cubing (prefer flavor), increased to 4 potatoes.  Increased to 1-1/2 t dry thyme leaves, minced.  No salt.  Substituted 1.5 pints half and half and 1 pint heavy cream for water and the evaporated milk.  Increased to 3 (6.5oz) cans of minced clams.  Added 4 slices bacon, cut in .25"x1" strips, fried and drained.    Makes about 12 servings.

Ok my prior post isnt here so here we go again.  I doubled the recipe and used clam juice for the water since I had some and tried whole wheat flour.  It was pasty tasting at first but added more milk and it was fine.  Used some of the reviewers spices and a sweet onion. Wished I had a yellow onion on hand as that sweet onion gave the chowder a sweet flavor I would rather not have.  Will def. Make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy to make and I wouldn't change a thing.  Note that you will also need cold water handy (not on ingredient list), and just add enough to your desired consistency.  I made it for a group and everyone wanted seconds.  I used about 3/4 cup water to this recipe, and my soup came out much thicker than the photo of the soup in the brown bowl (as of 1/02/14).

Some of my friends & I put together a meal for lunch each day at work.We use slow-cookers,electric skillets,grills,etc. to cook with.This chowder works great for us as we can make it ahead & warm it in time for lunch,saving time,money & eating healthier,too.As it is for 10-16 people,I added some extra potatoes & such,but it fit the need very nicely.
