NOTE: There should only be the juice of 1 orange, plus the zest of same orange. I'm going to try and change it.
Also, I have updated this recipe to use the new Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock from concentrate--it's amazing! Much better than tinned chicken broth. Another variation I tried out yesterday was to fry up a bit of panchetta or bacon, and then cook the onion in the rendered fat instead of the butter. Then top each bowl with a little bit of the panchetta/bacon. It adds depth to the flavor and makes it positively delectable!

Serve this soup with a dollop of sour cream or a drizzle of creme fraiche and a couple of croutons, or a side of garlic bread. Enjoy! :)

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  
Changes I made:  I roasted the cubes of squash under the broiler, about 10 min, turning halfway through.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the butter/onion mixture.  And, I didn't have an orange, so I subbed in o.j. and no sour cream so I substituted plain Greek yogurt.
Will make again!  (found 2 lbs peeled, cubed butternut squash at Costco = super easy!)

Outstanding recipe! I roasted my squash first in the oven.I sliced them lengthwise, brushed them with olive oil and salt, and placed them flesh-side down at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. I hate peeling squash, saves a lot of labor if you have the time for them to bake. Just scoop out the baked squash into the pot! Delicious!

Very yummy. Only used juice of one orange as recipe calls for, didn't have sour cream so used cream cheese instead and had to all just a little bit of curry and cayenne. It was awesome and I will be making this again. Thank you

Oh, this is such a wonderful butternut recipe. Not only is it simple and quick to make the taste is divine!
The orange is the right amount of flavor, and the color is amazing. Just add a little chopped parsley and the presentation of this soup is a winner.

Nice summer soup recipe. I added a clove of garlic with the onion and used only one orange for zest and juice.  Also added about 1/4 cup of cream and then garnished with the sour cream making a design and a parsley garnish.

way too much orange juice unless the recipe is incorrect.  The juice of four oranges is over powering.

Used frozen butternut squash that was already cubed.   Also a dash of cream instead of sour cream.   I added some sage and ginger but powdered and some salt and pepper.   Was great.

I think I prefer the more savory side of butternut squash recipes. I ended up adding thyme, black pepper, ginger and curry to counterbalance the orange.    And I only used half an orange!

Yum - used a bit less butter and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream at the end so it was a little more lo-cal. Delicious. The pot was gone in no time! Costco's peeled and cubed squash make this so easy! Update: I had a little too much squash last time I made this and not quite enough broth so I added about a half cup of white wine. Also a few shakes of ground ginger and cayenne. I also just use about a cup of OJ instead of juicing and zesting an actual orange.

Made with cream cheese, cinnamon and nutmeg. Topped with a swirl of cream. It tastes too good to be squash soup.

Really nice soup, made it so easy with packaged butternut squash cubes.  I used cream cheese in place of sour cream, and used 1 orange zest + juice as recommended, it had a nice hint of orange but not overpowering.

This is an excellent soup, very creamy in texture and flavorful.  It comes as a nice neutral base, strictly tasting of squash, so you would have to spice it up if you are looking for something a little extra.  I like it exactly as written... and it creates a beautiful presentation as well.  This is very easy to make and, for those who hate the work of cutting and cubing the squash, most grocery stores sell it already done and then the recipe goes much more quickly. This is a favorite on my list and I will make it again and again!

I used boxed butternut squash soup which worked just as well.  However I will cut the orange amount in half next time as it overpowered the squash flavor.

I like this recipe because it is not overly sweet and the sour cream gives it a nice tanginess. I roasted the squash first because it's easier to deal with. I shortened the simmer time since the squash was already cooked.

This soup is wonderful.  I roasted my squash in the oven its so much easier. I added a can of coconut milk as one reviewer did.  I love coconut milk. This recipe is so easy.  I will make this again with a bigger squash.

I was surprised by how good this was given it was so simple. Yes ONE orange. You could also substitute greek yogurt, soy yogurt, goat kefir etc. to add creaminess instead of sour cream. It was very tasty!
