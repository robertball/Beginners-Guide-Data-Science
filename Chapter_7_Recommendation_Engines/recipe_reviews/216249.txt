For a "doctoring" of store-bought sauce, this is as good as they come.  Actually used a jar of Basil & Garlic Sauce by Barilla, but I'm sure it had the same general effect.  Instead of fresh basil leaves, used the basil "cubes" from the freezer section of Trader Joes.  Are those not the best invention EVER?!?  Give this one a try.  I don't think you'll be disappointed in a "quick version" of a classic.

Because I didn't have any Prego Veggie Smart sauce, I used what I had - Bertolli Portobello Mushroom with Merlot.  It tasted amazing!!! My husband usually doesn't voice an opinion, he just eats. He had two full helpings and told me how good it was. I will definitely make this again.
