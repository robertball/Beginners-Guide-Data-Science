10.23.18 I followed this recipe to the letter, and there’s one thing that I will change. There’s a lot of fat that cooks out of the ground beef that IMO needs to be drained.  The recipe doesn’t tell you to do that, but I usually do, but didn’t today. If you brown the fresh tomatoes with the meat, if you drain it, you’re losing all of that sweet juice from the tomatoes. And although the final product was very good, it was greasy. So in the future, I will brown the meat, drain the fat, and then add tomatoes along with the remaining ingredients to simmer. On the positive side, this had very different flavors which we thoroughly enjoyed, and I definitely will make it again.

This recipe was amazing and a quick meal for the family. I used one can of diced tomatoes since I didn’t have fresh ones and I used frozen peas instead of canned peas because I don’t like the texture of canned peas. I will definitely make this again.

The general methodology is an authentic one, although most would likely use garlic and ginger instead of the curry powder. The process of cooking onion first and then the rest of spices with the meat, until it has a cooked smell and the oil separates from the meat mixture, is important and has a name ( bhoonna). This can take 10-15 minutes during which the pot has to be stirred intermittently. Oil should be removed after this process to allow for proper fragrance and flavor of the dish. Because the oil separates, the spices are not lost.

Pretty tasty for an easy weeknight meal. I substituted shredded carrots for the peas, cooked them with the onion at the start. Added 1 cup of water at the end to make it more saucy. I would say the amount of seasonings are spot on. We ate it with Basmati and cauliflower Rice to cut back on the carbs.

The recipe was an easy make and although I am not use to using curry, I must say the flavor is vibrant and strong. The prepared dish was a very good quick and easy meal. I will be making it more often in the future.

This was the perfect dish to make on a week night! The only substitution I made was replacing the canned peas with canned french cut green beans and 1/2 cup of shredded carrots. I didn't drain the ground beef,as I didn't find it greasy at all after reading comments made by other reviewers.  We ate this with orgainic white rice,and sauteed zucchini to cut back on carbs.  Definitely will make this again.

This was quite good. I used canned diced tomatoes and frozen peas. I didn't think it had enough sauce so added some water. It was still fairly dry. The moisture was quickly absorbed by the rice. I think it would benefit from the addition of yogurt or sour cream. All in all, it had a nice curry flavor and a fair amount of spice. Will likely make it again.

My family loves this recipe. Make sure to use the correct curry powder though. The yellow turmeric curry in the spice section. Not the curry from the Asian isle/store.

This recipe turned out great! Four out of five loved it in my family, so that’s a win. We prefer ground turkey to beef so I used that instead, and I did leave out the cayenne, and thought it was spicy enough. I will make this again soon considering how easy and inexpensive it was.

I used Gardein crumbles instead of beef and it worked well! I added a little water to make sure it didn't dry out too much. The spice mixture really makes the dish special. The peas ad a touch of sweetness to the final dish.

I hope that the taste isn't dramatically different without cayenne pepper, thats the only thing I left out. otherwise this recipe is delish. 4 year old and 1 year old ate it all up!

Honestly really happy with this dish, but it is missing something. I'm going to play around with it, try a tbsp of garam masala (spice recipe available on this site as well) and simmer the beef in some beef broth to kick up the flavor, because it tastes just a tad bland. But for a beef curry (I'm a chicken curry person), I was quite happy with it! Would happily eat the recipe as is any day!

Very good, but quite spicy. If you're not a person who likes lots of spice, I would omit the cayenne. I did use a whole 15 oz can of peas, drained.

This is a great weeknight recipe although,  I did make a couple changes. I did drain the beef/onion mixture before adding the tomatoes which I changed to a can of diced since that's what I had on hand. As far as the peas, instead of adding the liquid from the can (yuck) I used the same amount of low sodium beef broth. Served with basmati rice and some lightly broiled naanand it was fantastic! A keeper for sure!

This was a big hit with my family.  I added 3 small shredded carrots and 1/2 red bell pepper in with the onion to add a little more nutrition.  I also used 97% lean ground beef based on the comments from other reviewers about too much fat.  I also used frozen peas and served it on cauliflower rice to cut back on carbs.  Delicious and I will definitely be making this again.

My family really liked this recipe. I used ground turkey, which we prefer to ground beef. I used the liquid from the chick peas because the recipe said to simmer the mixture, but after draining off the fat from the meat, the mixture was dry. I also added a little chicken broth.i served this with basmati rice. The only other change I would make is to double the recipe since we enjoyed it so much!

The cook times are glaringly inaccurate and the finished product just tastes like fat and peas. Yuck! Needs way more spice.

This was fantastic and the whole family loved it !  It would have been a mistake to use smoked paprika (the only paprika I had) so i increased the chili powder.  Used canned, crushed tomatoes instead of fresh and omitted the oil so I didn't have to drain the meat.  So yummy!  Eating leftovers now.

I added the onions along with garlic when I cooked the meat in a skillet. When cooked  transferred it to a sauce pan, leaving the fat behind, added two cans of diced tomatoes along with the spices. Ten minutes before serving added two cups of frozen peas. Easy and good tasting meal.

This came out great!! The only change I made was using 4 TBS olive oil instead of 6. I also used a can of diced tomatoes undrained - I did drain the can of peas. I would absolutely make this again.

The only change was to add a full tsp of chili powder because I simply made a mistake.  So I decided not to add the cayenne.  We thought it was great.  Not too spicy and still with a good flavor.  Oh, and I also used one can of diced tomatoes instead of cutting up fresh ones - bur other reviewers had done that.  Will definitely make it again.

Great and quick dish. I would follow the previous posters in cooking the beef first and draining it. Otherwise, awesome and spicy!

Love this dish.  Easy hamburger curry. In my opinion it needs a dash of cinnamon, tumeric and ginger to amp up the flavor instead of chili or cayenne.  Also, I use frozen peas. Sometimes I use canned tomatoes. Sometimes I add a diced potato and simmer til soft.

I took other reviews advice and cooked the onions and meat first. Then drained off the access grease from the meat. Added all the other ingredients as the recipe mentioned. I found that the tomato’s when broken down where extremely juicy. So when it came time to add the can peas. (I did drain most of the juice from the can before adding. With that being said, I served it on a mound of white rice, this dish was wonderful and flavourful. My wife and kids loved it.

This is fantastic! Definitely drain the grease from the hamburger before adding tomatoes. I tend to not measure spices so I’m sure my hand was a little heavy, but I like spicy! I just put a spoonful of sour cream on top to cool it down a bit. I served it with fry bread, which is just a simple flour, baking powder, salt and water dough which is kneaded and rested before rolling out and cutting into triangles then frying in a skillet of about 2 inches of hot oil. It puffs up so when you bite a hole in it you can fill it with the curry. Boy is it delicious!

Everyone like it but you are going to have to drain the hamburger.  I did not because I realized it too late and would have lost the flavor of the tomatoes.    Otherwise very tasty over Basmati rice.
