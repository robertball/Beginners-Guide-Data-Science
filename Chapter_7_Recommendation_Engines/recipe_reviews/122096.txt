These cookies worked out nice. A few pieces of advice. When using berries(frozen or fresh) toss in a bit of flour before adding them, it will minimize the bleeding of the blue color into the whole cookie. Also just gently stir them in w/ a wooden spoon. This will also help from spreading too much color. To answer one reviewer, if you would like to incorporate flax into your cookies ground flax makes an excellent egg substitute. I use it almost exclusively in cookies and muffins. Just add 1 tablespoon ground fax to 3 tablespoons water (this is equal to 1 egg) let sit about 5 min. and vola! perfect egg substitute and healthy cookies! Oh, whole wheat flour works great in these cookies.

Excellent cookies. Thanks for the twist on an old favorite.  I will look for smaller blueberries next timem, mine were too big and enabled the cookies to fall apart a bit.

I gave these four stars because the basic recipe produced a very good cookie - it set up nicely and had a great, soft texture.  I used frozen blueberries, and the juice of course turned the cookies blue, which I was expecting, but they also made it quite difficult to keep the cookies together - they kept falling apart while forming them.  But I loved the combination of flavors, and think I will try these again with dried blueberries instead to prevent the juice from running and help keep them together.

The dough was very easy to work with but the blueberries didn't really cook down enough for my liking (or most of my family's liking).  I think I might use the dough and make thumbprint cookies with it and fill it with strawberry jam.

I thought these were fantastic, and my husband loved them too! They didn't last too long - made me wish I would have bought more blueberries when they were on sale so I could make more! I threw some dried cranberries in, which added a nice slightly chewy contrast to the soft juicy blueberries. I forgot to add the cinnamon, but they were still great.

These cookies are delicious! I used a mix of light and dark brown sugar (what I had on hand) and fresh blueberries and they turned out perfectly.  I also baked them on parchment, which I'd highly recommend because the cookies are so moist they can spread a little too much on a straight baking sheet. I also (2nd time) rolled the blueberries in flour as another reviewer suggested before putting them in the batter, which I think really helped them stay together. Definitely make these cookies - everyone will thank you!

These were wonderful cookies!  My husband even liked them!  I added WAY to many blueberries, which made them not hold together well, but were fantastic! I also used white whole wheat flour and some cocoa. Going to try adding some flax seed this time...

Good flavor, but mine were overly moist and literally falling apart.  I think this is because I only had old-fashioned oats to use.  If I made this again, I would either use quick or double the amount for old-fashioned oats.

Delicious!  I usually hate blueberries, but my boyfriend loves them, so I gave this recipe a shot.  the flavors blend together perfectly, and the blueberries really soften up when baked.  I used fresh blueberries and tossed them with a little flour and didn't have any trouble at all with them bleeding throughout the cookies.

These were very good. I used fresh blueberries, dark brown sugar, 1/2 white/1/2 whole wheat flour, other than that made the recipe as written. My only complaint is that they are a little salty. Next time I would reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp.

I love bluberries, and these were pretty tasty. I actually liked the cookie dough better than the cookie itself though. I love the way the cool fresh blueberried popped in my mouth surrounded by the sweet gooeyness.

Straight out of the oven, these are the best cookies you will ever taste!  I used a scant half cup of canola oil instead of butter and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  They were still a little sweet for me (I usually cut the sugar in half when I cook), but the texture is PERFECT.  I used freshly picked blueberries from a nearby farm.  I might have to go pick more so that I can make these again!

I had no oats but a box of blueberry oatmeal - so I used that instead (and omitted the whole blueberries) it was scrumptious! Even my blueberry leery hubby loved them :)

I couldn't stop eating these delicious cookies.  I did add a little cinnamon.  They were moist and full of blueberry flavor. I had to pack the dough with the blueberries and was worried they weren't going to cook well, but, not a problem at all.  They cooked perfectly.  My husband raved about them.  It's going to be the first thing I think about when I have blueberries.

Yum! I made the recipe as written, and it yielded 2 1/2 dozen 3 inch cookies. Great way to bake with fresh blueberries.  The cookie base is very tasty itself. It bakes up moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. You could add nuts, raisins, cranberries, chocolate chips, coconut, etc. and my bet is any additions would be fabulous.

I made these today with the thicker old-fashioned oats (rather than quick-cooking, since that's what I had) EggBeaters, dark brown sugar and dried blueberries.  My substitutions meant a few minutes longer baking time, but  they came out great and I will put this in my cookie file.  Thanks to Elaine for submitting!

I added about a fourth a cup extra blueberries, just because there didn't seem to be enough for my liking.  Just make sure you grease the cookie sheets, I forgot for the first two batches and the berries stuck.  Very, very tasty cookies!

Easy and fun to make.  I used dried berries as I had them but I forgot the cinnamon; still excellent.  Shared them with a neighbour who immediately asked for the recipe.  I had no problems with the berries sinking or burning, perhaps because they were dried?  I can't wait to make them again with the cinnamon!

Made these, and loved them!  The only thing I would have done different is put the blueberries on top of the cookie dough after putting the dough on the pan.  The berries that were on the bottom of the cookies made those cookies a little mushy, and a few berries stuck to the pan.

These were fine.  They were hard to keep together, but that is just the nature of adding blueberries to cookies.  I baked mine for 14 minutes and wish I had baked longer (and my oven normally does not require that).  They were still quite moist--almost too much so.  But, good flavor, which is what matters!

Delish, loved these, moist on the inside, I love fruit in what I cook sometimes, it's a lot like a muffin.  You can never go wrong with cinnamon.

So yummy!! I added a few more spices to mine, but I am sure they would still be delicious as is.

These were the twist I was looking for and stayed moist and delicious for as long as they were around.  (And they only lasted that long because I made so many of them!)  Awesome, thanks.

Yum! Had some extra blueberries to use up and this was great. A nice sweet cookie with the brown sugar. Planning to serve with vanilla ice cream for a perfect summer dessert.

These were very good.  I love oatmeal cookies!  I do prefer them with rolled oats though.  The blueberries gave the cookies a nice tart bite!

This is a fantastic recipe! The best cookies in town are from Subway. After eating these all my friends agreed that these are hands down better than Subway cookies. I used the same dough recipe but added chocolate chips - amazing! Will eat over and over again : )

DELICIOUS!  I used my stand mixer and tossed in the fresh bluberries at the end to break them up just a little... also added some white baking chips and they were *perfect* I thought they were pleasingly different from any other cookies I have ever made! Loved them!

I added a half cup of milk.  If you don't, I think it'll be too dry and cause the blueberries to be smashed up.  Some other reviewers mentioned they were crumbly which will help with that.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe but wanted to make a different type of cookie from your standard chocolate chip.  It is wonderful!  Chewy and an awesome flavor!!  I made the recipe as is...using butter, old fashioned rolled oats, and fresh blueberries.  Was asked for the recipe by several people.  A hit!

Great recipe! I also added a cup of good-quality chopped white chocolate in while mixing the dough! Now I have to make these cookies every weekend!

Wow! These really are awesome cookies! The cookie part is the best oatmeal cookie I've ever made (maybe that I've ever had!) and the blueberries were such a great flavor combination. My only changes were using 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 regular flour, and I used egg beaters, as I always do (even in baking).  I used fresh blueberries in season now but will try year-round with frozen because they are so good. I really love oatmeal cookies and these may be my new favorite recipe!  I highly recommend even using the dough with raisins if you prefer. Yum!!

My husband loved these!! I am an organic eater and I made these with all organic ingredients and they were awesome! Instead of butter I used coconut oil which worked great but I did have to add about a half cup more flour to even it out a little. I used whole grain flour and it worked great also. These are a keeper cause my husband gobbles these up faster than I can make another batch!

Like an oatmeal raisin cookie - only with blueberries.  I used fresh blueberries I purchased earlier that were frozen.  I had a very hard time mixing the frozen blueberries with the batter.  Not sure why - but be sure to use small blueberries otherwise your cookies will be too large and take forever to cook.  Good recipe - however I doubt I will make these again.

Very good. Hubby liked the cinnamon with the blueberries. This makes a really small batch, so they disappeared quickly. Normally I prefer lemon flavor with blueberries, but this was a nice alternative.

I thought this recipe was fantastic, and it was easy for someone like me who won't spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  They were a little too soft, so I think I might add some nuts next time.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to help the cookies stay together a little more?  Will cooking them longer do the trick?  I am just starting out as a cook you see.... :-)

The taste of these cookies is wonderful!  They are definitely a nice fall recipe.  The only thing I didn't like about them was the texture.  They are kind of flimsy and sticky, but still delicious!  I'll definitely make them again.  Plus, if you make them with light margarine they are only 115 calories a piece!

This recipe was a hit.  The aroma produced while baking attracted a crowd in the kitchen.  Everyone raved. Next time, I will add more cinnamon and, perhaps, chopped walnuts for texture and flavor.
