i made this for dinner it was very tasty, i made a few modifications, no sliced mushrooms or carrots ( didn't have any one hand) I also added a can of dark red kidney beans, also i did NOT add the sugar, i don't do added sugar, but since I'm into spicy food i added crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne, paprika, and chili powder.... some of the reviews said it was bland (i fixed that issue :)

My super picky 2 year old finished his plate and was on my lap eating mine :)

Delicious. A good sized casserole with a lot of flavor. I only cooked the beef mixture about 20 minutes(instead of 45)and baked the entire dish for 30 min. I used whole wheat pasta, added a little liquid to the soup, used fresh mushrooms and was generous with the cheese on top. This recipe is a keeper.

I was pleasantly surprised on how good this casserole was! It had great flavors. I added half of the shredded cheese on top of the mushroom soup. I also baked half the time then added the other cheese on top.I will defiantly make this again!

I asked my husband and first he said "mmhm" between bites..I asked for an actual review so he said "a courageous blend of tuna casserole and taco salad. It explodes with flavor upon entering the chasms of your tastebuds. This recipe delivers!" Hahaha as a newlyish wed and a beginner in the kitchen I think I'll keep this one!!

This recipe was simple and tasty. I used every ingredient except the carrots. I wish I made
more than 6 servings at the time, because everyone was going back for more.  I will etch this
in my batch of recipes to make on those hectic days.

I made this for the first time tonight, and it was a hit with our family. I used elbow macaroni instead of bowtie pasta, added butter to the pasta as another reviewer mentioned, and reduced the cooking time to 20 mins for the meat, and baked for 30 minutes (pressed for time). Very flavorful and filling.

1 family member loved it, 1 said OK, 1 ate it but would not request it again.  Not enough flavor, considering using Rotel tomatoes instead of plain diced next time and adding cheese midway through the baking as the cheddar when cooked that long gets tough.

Large mild casserole. I added a small amount of milk to the cream of mushroom soup. I only simmered the beef mixture for about 20 -25 mins. A very versatile dish which is kid friendly.

I made it according to the directions and wouldn't change a thing. It's perfect the way it is...and didn't last long in my house. It has just the right combination of sweet and savory.

It was very easy to make, and pretty inexpensive which I appreciate. I did find that the cooking time was a lot less then in the directions, which was even better. I used a little more of the diced tomatoes then the recipe called for and put about two tablespoons of butter over the hot noodles before putting in the oven which I think made it more moist. I also added extra brown sugar and soy sauce to the meat which I've found compliments worcestershire sauce. Yum.

So the current "most helpful review" didn't make this recipe at all.   It was all changed up.  I loved it AS WRITTEN and so did my family.   We will make this again!

Tried this with what I had in my kitchen at the time, no mushrooms or peppers, stewed instead of diced, more tomato sauce than asked because I didn't want to have just a half can left over. probably sat 30 minutes on the stove and 30 minutes in the oven and it came out great.  I'm always looking for alternatives for ground beef and this was so delicious. I think the cinnamon and Worchester sauce was key!

I try to make recipes as directed the first time, but I didn't have regular diced tomatoes, so I used Rotel, which turned out to be a good idea. I also didn't cook the veggies for 45 minutes; it was more like 20 minutes and the casserole tasted fine. My final change was to bake it for 30 minutes. To do it again, I'd leave the cheese off until the final 15 minutes. My husband and daughter loved it, so I will be making it again, but instead of spooning the soup on the pasta, I will mix the soup into the veggies for the last few minutes of cooking.

My husband and I both really loved this, even after I made a few changes to make it healthy and lower in fat. I used whole wheat egg noodles, low fat cream of mushroom, 93% beef, 2% cheese, which I too, like others did, layered. I also did alittle extra brown sugar, couple shakes of cayenne and soy sauce. It was awesome, will definitely be making again!

Good, basic recipe.  I took the advise of another reviewer, and added 1/2 the cheese over the soup and noodle layer, and half on top the last 15 minutes of cooking. This worked great. The other change I made was to sauté the vegetables while the hamburger was draining in the colander, then add it back in before the liquid. My family liked the casserole. I will serve it again. Thank you!

Wow! Amazing. Only omitted mushrooms as hubby doesn’t like them. Did use cream of mushroom soup though. Used penne pasta. I made meat mixture ahead, so that I only had to cook noodles after work. I’ll bet the meat mixture would freeze well. Wish I had only used half as this made a TON. I could have frozen the other half for later.  Crowd pleaser for sure!

I admit I made some tweaks to the original recipe. I put 2 tbsp. butter in a pan and sauteed onions, mushrooms, garlic, bell pepper, and carrots on low while ground beef cooked. To ground beef I added Bold Tony Chacheries, chili powder, ground cumin, ground cilantro, and ground black pepper. To cream of mushroom soup I added a little milk. Everything else was basically the same. I really liked it, and my husband (the real cook) said it was good. I call it a win!

I made this today. My husband and I really enjoyed this. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce. I'm not sure if that affected the flavor much but it was delish. I'll be making this again.

Only had 1 pound of hamburger so cut tomato sauce in half, otherwise made to recipe.  Excellent! Boys wanted a little spicier so will put some habanero or pepperjack cheese next time.  It was perfect for me.

I made this with 2 lbs of hamburger and I doubled the cheese. In addition, I used cream of celery soup and simply mixed it with the pasta instead of pouring it on top. 

When I try something new, I normally ask my fiancé to rate it on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best. He normally doesn’t rate anything higher than a 7, but he gave this casserole a 10!

This recipe was a quick, easy meal. I didn't have any condensed soup so I made my own and it worked out fine. It was nice to use a lot of pantry ingredients and my kids loved it.

Okay I made quite a few changes based on other reviews.  Used what I had on hand, 1 1/2 lb ground beef, Frozen mixed vegis (Carrots, peas, corn and grean beans) mushrooms, 20 ounces of diced tomatoes and a couple table spoons of tomoto paste and combo of spices (Garlic powder, Onion Salt, Pepper, Red Pepper flakes, Chili Powder, Smoked Paprika cooked iwth the meat) , and just a cup or so of pasta with Cream of mushroom soup to keep the carbs down. Didn't really measure spices, but enough for a pretty good kick.  The contrast of the spices and the sweet vegis made a nice flavor combo.   My husband loved it, and so did I.

I'll make it again and I used rotini noodles cause that's what I had:) Worked out great! My suggestion is to make the noodles when you start the recipe cause I didn't and it took the water a while to boil then the noodles the time to cook so it slowed the time down. Then I only cooked the dish for 30 minutes not 45. Enjoy!

Great dish for a family of five to share, but I'd add some more spices to it next time (to suit our tastes)!  I'm confident that some cumin, cilantro, more garlic, and all seasoning would do the trick to kick it up to a five-star rating!

Delicious. Because I didn't have all listed ingredients I substituted the following: leftover spaghetti sauce, celery and rice. Also added crispy onions on top.

This was a really good comfort food for the colder weather. My whole family loved it. I used Mostaccioli noodles instead of bow-tie only because of personal preference and added a tad more fresh garlic but that's it. Thanks for sharing!!

Actually, this was really yummy! I used a large thing of cream of mushroom because that’s what I had, so I put some in the meat mix and on top of the noodles. I didn’t have carrots or canned mushrooms-used fresh mushrooms and an extra thing of tomato sauce and some water to the meat sauce along with onion and garlic powder. Really really good. I will make this again.

Good! Creamy. I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and more Worcestershire sauce- and gluten free elbow macaroni. Added basil and oregano and smoked paprika.  Also only cooked the meat mixture 20 minutes and of added the cream of celery to the meat mixture.

This came out really delicious!!!  I  added scallions to the meat mixture and topped with more scallions on top of the cheese.  I also added a cheesy layer with Mexican blend cheese on top of the cream of mushroom layer.  The next time I make this think I'll sprinkle some  crumbled bacon on the top.  This is definitely a keeper! :)

Very tasty and easy!  I had to modify a bit for dietary restrictions and what I had on hand. I usually prefer cream of celery soup with casseroles like this. Mushroom is over bearing to me, even though I love mushrooms. So I swapped that out. I didn’t have carrots but had some coleslaw mix that had shredded carrots and it worked great. Yellow instead of green pepper. I was surprised how great it was!  Definitely will make again!

The recipe as written needed tweeking as recommended by other reviewers,( sorry to offend  some recipe reviewers purists).I skipped the cream of @#! soup because I abhor the stuff,and sauteed sliced fresh mushroom with a tablespoon of butter,some onion powder and one clove of chopped garlic and a splash of heavy cream,( my version of cream of mushroom :) Left out brown sugar,as added sugar to a meat dish is not necessary.I then added whole wheat penn pasta to a portion for my hubbs, and used zuchinni noodles in mine,( watching carbs). I also used grated carrot and reduced that from 1/4 cup to 1/8 cup. I mixed the portions separate and added extra cheese and baked until the cheese was bubbling. I think I may add more spice,as I felt it was a tad bland for our tastes even with the changes I made.

I made it, sort of. Converted to Keto, cooked cabbage instead of pasta, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, instead of tomato sauce for one (didn't have it), used venison/pork sausage, fresh mushrooms, melted cream cheese instead of cream of whatever so it was, cooked at higher temperature, added sriracha sauce for zip. Sorry, that's the way I do it. I use what I have. Tasted great.

Easy and tasty, didn’t precook my pasta or the sauce just the ground beef. Mixed everything together and cooked it! The extra liquid you would have reduced down just absorbed in to the pasta to cook it.... much faster and easier that way

Loved his recipe!! Spiced it up a little with Cajun seasoning, chile powder, and cayenne.  I used finely chopped zucchini instead of mushrooms(not a fan) and it was great!! I think the original would have been good too, just depends on your taste!

didn't use the green pepper, sugar or pasta.  instead used quinoa, shredded sweet potatoes and fresh spinach.  it all worked really well.  very tasty and with the quinoa, nice and light.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using veggie crumbles instead of ground beef & whole wheat pasta instead of regular. Will definitely make this again.

I followed the directions and the only changes  I made were less cooking initially and to layer the cheese as other reviewers suggested.  I checked the flavour before I put it in the oven and it was very bland so I added some Old Bay which can zip up the flavour on nearly anything with the tomatoes.  I baked it for the 45min but it was still disappointing for the amount of pots and pans, work and time it required.  I could give it 3 stars but, for the work involved, it's not equal to an average score.

I substituted 2 part bison and 2 part venison and cut the cheddar cheese in half, and used whole wheat noodles to make this a little heart smart for my heart patient husband. I know the recipe is 6 portions, but my husband will kill it off in 3!

This turned out better than I expected!  I used diced tomatoes with chilies instead of placed tomatoes and did not add any mushrooms.  Good flavor with a hint of kick, will make again.

DH rated it a 2.5 I gave it a 3 because it was ok. I think it's just a matter of taste for us. In his words..."It wasn't anything special." 

The only modification I made was that I didn't put any mushrooms in it. We don't care for mushrooms a whole lot. I used the soup of course but didn't add mushrooms to the meat mixture.

This recipe was all right. A lot of work for the return. I made the following alterations: added the hamburger/sauce and vegetables to a pot and simmered them to cut out the frying step. Recipie was a little on the sweet side. Fiance says "more hamburger". I wouldn't do this recipe again.

Not bad, but not great. The cream of mushroom soup was bizarre over the pasta.
The texture was fine, but I added extra flavor with additional hot spices, plus I used fresh mushrooms.

I was pleasantly surprised on how this turned out. I did use Rotel tomatoes and fresh mushroom. I am glad I did not add extra seasoning this was great just by adding the Rotel. My family enjoyed it and I will be making this again!

I would add a little more tomato sauce and a little milk to the mushroom soup.  I added cayenne pepper to give a little kick.  Overall, a pretty decent casserole!

Hmmm. Well.. mine turned into a Penne with Red Sauce, Albeit, a good red sauce with all the good veggies in it.. I followed others advice and put melted butter into the noodles instead of soup to keep them moist in the oven, and also per other advice added an Italian cheese blend instead of cheddar. 
It is good, but for the time it took to prepare could have made many other home made pasta dishes.. on a positive note ,I had set out to make something with ingredients on hand that was good.. and this fit the bill. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I thought it was very good....I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up for my family, but would not recommend that if serving to small children!  Everyone should taste and add salt, pepper, and other spices as they like...it's a very versatile recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing with us!!!

I made it for dinner tonight and it had a lot of flavor.  It was just a little hot for our taste, but next time I will cut the Worcestershire sauce in half.  Plus, I read the reviews and decided to just tweak it a bit.  I added 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning and I also added 1/2 can of water to the soup and mixed the soup with the noodles before putting them in the baking dish.  We will have this again.

Excellent casserole (or as they say in Wisconsin, "Hot Dish").  I used ground venison and fresh mushrooms, which were the only changes I made.  I think the key step is #2 when you add the onions and other ingredients to get all the flavors blended.  I added the fresh mushrooms at this point.  Definitely will be making again, and again!

I liked this recipe quite a lot, although I feel like it's a long process for something that isn't quite as flavourful as I would have liked. It also came out a bit watery when I made it

Tasted a bit like hamburger helper.  I would use mozzarella cheese next time. Cheddar, with pasta and tom sauce didnt work for us. Enjoyed trying it. Thanks CW1113

This is very tasty and easy to make.  I was really in a hurry to go run a Boy Scout meeting, so I used canned sliced carrots instead.  This is a keeper!
