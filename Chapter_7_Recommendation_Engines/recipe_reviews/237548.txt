We are well into our kitchen/bathroom/laundry room remodel and not only am I missing home-cooked food, I am missing the experience of cooking and baking in general.  We have returned to Naples and further traveling after a very brief "pit-stop" home, just long enough to check on things and to gather up some rhubarb from my yard to pack in my suitcase.  If I can't be home for all the benefits of spring, at least I can take some with me!  While this rhubarb bread recipe is a fairly standard one, I'm happy to be the first to review it and  report that it does not diminish the fact that they (I baked this as muffins) delivered all I hoped they would.  It is a great recipe.  They are flavorful, moist, with just the right amount of rhubarb and spice and no distracting or "creative" add-ins.  The topping is generous, stays put on the muffin and is delightfully crispy-crunchy.  Mostly, they were the little taste of good, home baking Hubs and I have been missing.  (One recipe produced 16 standard sized muffins.  Bake at 350 degrees, about 25 minutes)

The first time I followed the instructions and it was ok but I cut the rhubarb into pieces that were too small so they practically dissolved when cooked.  The second time I not only increased the size of the pieces but I increased the amount to two cups.  Much, much better.  The third time - I rocked it by adding somewhere between 3/4 and a cup of chopped walnuts.   Awesome!

I want to start off by saying that these were yummy and my boys (ages 6 and below) loved them. The next time around I am going to skip the topping all together and incorporate the cinnamon in with the batter and cut the sugar down a bit as well. I guess it all depends on your preference and we like to try and keep the sugar down in this house so if you're the same way, try to cut down in the sugar and you should love these!

This is so delicious! First of all, I absolutely hate rhubarb but after using this recipe, I've definitely found a use for it! I made this recipe exactly as it is written, but next time I'm going to add at least 1/2 cup more rhubarb. It's perfectly fine as is, but I think that that extra little bit of rhubarb could make it even better. The crumble is a nice added touch, though I personally find it a little too sweet, that's a matter of personal preference however. Everybody loves is and even though I made it about an hour ago, half of it's already gone and my family is demanding I make a second one. The only discrepancy I found in this recipe was the fact that it said to bake it for 1 hour. I had to bake mine for about an hour and 20 minutes for it to actually come together. It is still surprisingly moist considering the length of time that it baked for.

I altered slightly to suit our tastes, I halved the sugar and oil, added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1 cup each whole wheat flour, ap flour and oatmeal, for leavening 2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda, used 2 cups rhubarb and dusted the tops of the muffins with cinnamon sugar. Baked at 375 for 22 minutes, made 15 muffins, very tasty!

Had some extra rhubarb and tried this out and it was delicious! I made muffins instead of bread and cut the baking time down to 20-25 minutes. I agree with others though that some more rhubarb would have been great too.

I wanted to freeze some of these so I made muffins and baked them for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  This recipe makes delicious muffins/bread!  The ones that came out of the freezer defrosted perfectly at room temperature and were as tasty as when they were first made.  Also, when I made these, I ran out of white flour and had to use mostly whole wheat and it worked well for me.

This is my go to rhubarb recipe! I cut the sugar back to one cup and do 1/3 cup applesauce 1/3 cup oil and increase rhubarb to 2 cups. I will often make a crumbley struesel topping to go on top. I already have to triple the recipe so I can freeze some and five some away!

Very disappointed.  I followed the directions to a "T", measured my loaf pan, checked off the ingredients - the bread overflowed the pan and what a mess to clean up.  Maybe should be using two loaf pans?  Or a 9x9 or 8x8?  

A heck of a lot of sugar went to waste on this - it was totally useless in the entirety.

I added about 1/3 cup more of rhubarb.  Instead of the loaf, I made 9 jumbo muffins.  I reduced the baking time to 25 minutes.  They were excellent!  The leftovers stayed moist for several days after baking.

I made the muffin version using half the sugar listed in the topping.  Wonderful. A larger dice on rhubarb is highly recommended.  Mine needed 30 minutes or so to bake throughout.  Moist muffin! A must to try.

I actually made three of these loaves and used them as a gift.  I followed the recipe exactly.  What I found out was that it makes too much batter for a regular 5x9 inch loaf pan.  I could have had four loaves out of a recipe for three.  The other thing I found out was it takes an hour and a half to get them done.  The recipe says about an hour.  A loaf would not be done in one hour.  And last but not least,  we didn't think there was much of a rhubarb taste.

It was good. I added less sugar and more rhubarb. It was like a bread pudding in the consistency, added ice cream and warmed it up again on day two. Yummy!

Everybody loved it!  Moist, with a nice balance of sweet and tart which you expect with a good rhubarb recipe. The only thing I found a little off-putting was the gooeyness of the cooked rhubarb, so next time I will be dicing them a little finer!

Sweet and delicious! Made magazine version,  slightly altered. 1 1/4c br. sugar called for was plenty, may cut to 1c. Maybe my fault for using 2 c rhubarb and subbing 2% milk + 1Tbsp vinegar for buttermilk, but baked 1hr20+min and still a little gooey inside - decrease moisture or increase time. Mag put 1 tsp cinn and 1/2 tsp ground ginger in the bread - excellent for me. Instead of streusel topping, I just sprinkled a bit more brown sugar on top before baking. Think I'll have another slice...

This is by far my favorite rhubarb recipe.  It is easy to make and comes out moist and tasty.  I used 2 cups rhubarb and split the recipe between 3 mini bread pans, baking it for 30 minutes.  Spray the pans well, and use care in removing the loaves from the pans.  Enough to share with neighbors and friends!

I had 3 1/2 cups rhubarb so I threw it all in.  I didn't need as much moisture with all that rhubarb, so I used 1/3 cup coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. In the end, I have 1 loaf and 6 muffins. Delish!

A nice way to use Rhubarb and amazing muffins/bread. I did take advantage of one review that made healthy changes, eliminating the oil, adding oats & whole wheat flour was a real nice option. Next time I will reduce the sugar as she recommended. The recipe is very moist & didn't need the oil in my opinion. Batch was much bigger than stated, made 18 muffins & a small loaf pan of bread.

It's ok. The dough was super thick. Once baked the bread is very thick and not very moist. It tastes ok, but would I make it again? No.

Super easy and super delicious. Like some others have said, the topping is a little sweet for my taste so I cut down on the sugar there, and it takes more than an hour to bake, at least for me. It seems best at an hour fifteen minutes baking time.

Flavor was good but rhubarb was very stringy. I may try again, cooking the rhubarb before using in recipe

Made this mostly as written and it is a new all-time favorite! I did add 2 full cups of rhubarb cut in about 1" pieces as suggested in one of the reviews and couldn't be happier with results. Found it made 12 large muffins and 1 small loaf. Don't put off trying this recipe even if you don't like rhubarb! It is definitely a keeper. We liked the texture of the muffin so much that I plan to try substituting different fruits as well.

Finally made the rhubarb bread and loved it. Will definitely make again.  Used 2cups of rhubarb. Seemed like a lot batter for 1 loaf. I made a dozen muffins and a loaf (3x5) of bread.

I grew up eating rhubarb straight from the rhubarb patch. And I got in trouble for doing it when I didn't leave enough for Mom to make strawberry rhubarb pie, preserves, etc.  One thing she never made was rhubarb bread.  I've made this four times (a loaf is in the oven now), and my hubby and I both love it .  I make it as written--if it's already great, why mess with it?

So easy to make and great taste. I used yogurt instead of buttermilk as I didn't have buttermilk on hand. It turned out cake like... light texture and very addictive!!! Nice blend of sweet and sour! Would've added a picture but it didn't last long enough to take one!

Very tasty recipe. I have made it a couple times.  I use plain, unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil. Much healthier and doesn't alter the flavor. They were very moist.

I use some rhubarb that I had in the freezer so, when I made the bread it wasn't as Snappy as it probably would have been with fresh rhubarb. But the topping  across on the top was to die for. It was great.

My mother has a big huge rhubarb plant and I don't like to make pie, so was happy to get this recipe. A lot of the other reviewers said to increase the rhubarb - I decreased everything else as my standard muffin recipe has 2 C of flour. I decreased the milk to 4 oz and the sugar to one cup. I didn't make the topping, and put 1 t pumpkin pie spice in with the flour. Cooked at 375 degrees for 18 minutes, which was perfect. Made 13 muffins. I will make this again. Next time I will probably add 1 C of chopped strawberries, a little lemon juice, and no milk.

After reading a lot of reviews I added more rhubarb.   When I took the bread out of the pan, it fell apart and the cinnamon top fell off the top.  All that said, it tasted good.  I think it would be better as muffins.

Made as written--flavor was just okay.  Not much of a Rhubarb taste.  Took about an hour and 20 minutes to bake.  Will probably try and make it again but up the amount of Rhubarb.  Thanks for sharing...

I made the rhubarb bread. It took way more than an hour to bake, burning the topping. It also rose and overflowed the pan. I measured and followed  the directions.

I would try again putting two recipes in three pans.

I doubled the recipe as well as the amount of rhubarb.  The other reviews were correct, there was enough sugar already in the mix to accommodate the extra fruit. I will surely make these again!

Delish! Followed the recipe this time except to increase the amount of rhubarb (based on the reviews). Moist and sweet. A little whipped topping just because. Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will add some nuts and maybe try a cream cheese drizzle on the top. The neighbors like it, too.

I made precisely as written.  I used a 9x5 Pyrex loaf dish.  This would not set in middle, and it did the lava flow thing all over my oven. Ended up taking it out of loaf with baked and unbaked dough, mixed it and put in larger dish. Had to clean out the oven before final bake. What did I do wrong????

Thank you so much for the recipe for the Rhubarb Bread.  I love Rhubarb and as soon as I can find fresh Rubarb I will make it.  If I can’t  find fresh rhubarb I will use frozen and hope it comes out 
the same.

Everyone who tried this asked for the recipe.  I used less brown sugar, probably 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. The rhubarb was almost sweet as it was young and tender.

Very nice bread.  As some others have said, I  also increased the amount of rhubarb and I had to bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Nice taste and sweet but balances he tart taste of the rhubarb.

I did add 2 cups rhubarb cut up in bigger pieces, less sugar.  Made them into muffins.  
We ate them fresh, and wasn't to sure what I thought, needed more flavor, but on second day they were so moist and had a nice flavor.  
I find they keep well in fridge.

I had some problems with this recipe. It took a lot longer to bake (though granted I used 2 cups of rhubarb so that might very well have been the culprit). After one hour it hadn't set at all yet. I covered it with aluminum foil at some point to keep the top from burning and left it in the oven for close to TWO hours! I really thought it might not turn out. But in the end it did and was still very moist (in a good way). But also the rhubarb kind of sank to the bottom, so only the bottom half of each slice really had rhubarb in it. Oh and I agree with some of the other reviews that it could have done with less sugar. It was really more like a cake. Seemed too sugary sweet for a breakfast food which was what I was going for.

Tasty and easy to make.  Not sure of the advantage of mixing dry ingredients separately as I thought  it would add unnecessary mixing to batter, which you wouldn't usually want with a loaf or muffins.   Fairly sweet topping but goes with tart rhubarb.  Made 1 doz med muffins (about 25 min baking time)and small loaf.

I read all the feedback, and added the extra rhubarb.  I doubled the recipe and I used 3 smaller loaf pans (4 x 8) baked for 1 hr 20 min.  Came out moist and delicious.  Only change I would make next time is less topping.  I'm going to try it as a cake next. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was really good as is.  I cut back on the sugar ONLY because neither of us like a real sweet bread/muffin.  When I make this again, I'm going to omit the topping and use the amount of sugar in the recipe to see if the topping added that much sweetness.  both hubby and I thought it was fine with 1 Cup of brown sugar in the mix and the sugar topping.   Thank you for a very good rhubarb recipe.

I used 2 cups of rhubarb and had to bake about 1 hour and 20 minutes before it was done.  Very delicious and will definitely make again!
