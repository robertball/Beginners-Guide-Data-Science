Yummy, I changed the pimentos to Italian style tomatoes, and also used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup used the higher temp to cook for faster service. Took it to work everyone raved and were impressed with its simplicity.

It was very good so I shared it with my in-laws.  My mother-in-law baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes with foil on the top of it so it would be done faster.  It still turned out great!

Very Tasty! How I made it: Boiled the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces.  Then cooked the angel hair pasta in the chicken broth.  Cooked 1/2 onion, 1/2 green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic in butter.  Mixed the chicken, noodles, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom into the veggies.   Covered with parmesan and cheddar cheese.  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes covered, uncovered for 5.  My husband and toddler loved it!

This was very good, although I am use to alittle more spice.  I added a table spoon chili powder and a tsp garlic salt.  I wanted the green peppers to be alittle more done, so next time I make this, I am going to add half a onion and a half a cup of celery, chop them up and saute in butter before adding to the dish.  My oldest child loved it, and she is picky.  So I will defiantly cook this again.

THis was DELICIOUS!! I did saute 1/2 white onion, the bell pepper and some minced garlic in extra virgin olive oil before I added it to the spaghetti.  I used a large 13oz box of whole wheat spaghetti. Also, I added 1/4 of bread crumbs and added some more shredded cheese to the top of the spaghetti once it was all mixed together and sitting nicely in the casserole dish before I baked. I baked covered with foil at 350 for 25 minutes and uncovered for 5 minutes more. Definitely a member of the clean plate club! My little girls and husband loved it! I will make this again and again!

Chicken Spaghetti is Cajun-inspired.  Try adding some Cajun seasoning if you want a little kick.

Very good! I used low-fat Mozzarella cheese instead and it was great. Be sure to cover the casserole dish.

I make this in large quantities for buffets and teacher luncheons. But I add Rotel (tomatoes and green chilies) to mine. People always ask for the recipe.

This was good, but a little dry.  I'm giving it  4 stars as it is, but with a few changes it could be a 5 star dish.  I would use more soup or I would have diluted the soup with some milk.  Also, I would cover it with foil and cook it at 350 for 30 min instead of the longer time.  This was still very good and I will definately make it again.

THIS RECEIPE TURNED OUT GREAT.  I MADE A LITTLE ADJUSTMENT.  I BOILED THE CHICKEN BREAST, REMOVED THE CHEKEN BREAST FOR THE BROTH(SEASON WITH GREEN ONION,BELL PEPPER,GARLIC POWDER, SALT, AND RED PEPPER).  THEN I COOKED THE SPAGETTI IN THE CHICKEN BROTH.  THIS REALLY KEPT THE FLAVOR IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE DISH. ON THE SIDE GARLIC BREAD AND RED ROOSTER COCKTAILS. MY HUSBAND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE MEAL.  IF YOU WANT THIS TO BE ROMANTIC SET TABLE AND ADD CANDLES.  THIS MAKES A FAST, EASY ROMANTIC DINNER.

This turned out really good. However, I made a few changes. I used Italian style tomatoes and marinated the chicken breast in Italian dressing for about 6 hours, then simmered it in the juice from the tomatoes. I added the tomatoes and onions to the chicken breast a few minutes before it finished cooking. Instead of mixing everything together, I mixed the noodles and cheese with some butter. Then I added the chicken breast mixture. While mixing those items together I simmered only a half can of mushroom soup (only cooking for two) in the same skillet I cooked the chicken breast in, and then mixed it to everything else. Last, I sprinkled some mild cheddar cheese with a few small strips of string mozzarella cheese over the top and baked it covered for about 15-20 minutes.

Used this recipe as a starter.  Used a can of mild rotel instead of pimentos.  Added a cup each of finely diced celery and onion.

My family loves this dish. I did tweak it a little by using half a bell pepper and half of an onion. I sauteed that in butter, then added uncooked chicken which I seasoned with Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper. I followed the recipe on everything else except for adding milk to the casserole for more creaminess and baking the dish at a higher temp for a shorter amount of time.

Thia was great! I fixed with a few of the same changes as "MomTo3Gals". !! (sauted 1/2 white onion, the bell pepper and some minced garlic in extra virgin olive oil before I added it to the spaghetti. I used a large 13oz box of whole wheat spaghetti and added some more shredded cheese to the top of the spaghetti once it was all mixed together and sitting nicely in the casserole dish or 13x9 pan before I baked. I baked covered with foil at 350 for 25 minutes and uncovered for 5 minutes more.)   It was a huge hit with company we had over! Thank you Kimber and Momt03girls!

I really like this recipe. I omit the bell pepper as I cannot stand them.  However, instead of the pimento/bell pepper combo, I use roasted red peppers--delish. Also, I boil the spaghetti in one can of chicken stock plus enough water to fill the pasta pot.  This really makes a difference in this recipe.  Finally, I do not like processed cheese, so I use shredded sharp cheddar, which also adds more flavor.

This was delicious! My toddler is so hard to please, and he loved it! However there are some things I did differently. First, I sautee'd the bell peppers in a little bit of butter until they were soft. I also used velveeta shredded cheese, and diluted the cream of mushroom soup with a little more than 1/4 of a can of milk. It was too dry without it. I also baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then put shredded cheese on top and baked it uncovered for 5 minutes. It came out great!

Very simple "comfort food."  The sauce can be adjusted to meet your needs and likes.  Next time I will add garlic or at least garlic mushroom soup, and maybe some green chiles.  Very good for a fast meal.  I baked it at 350° for 30 minutes.

Oooooo baby! This is good~ We did add 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 1/2 cup of celery with the green peppers AND added a bit of milk with the soup. Also we added some crushed red pepper for some extra kick,otherwise it would have been a bit bland. Yummy! Definitely a keeper!

Nice & easy meal I turn to as I usually have most ingredients on hand (I recently discovered pimentos and love adding them to dishes now).  Once I even went an easy route and used frozen chicken nuggets as that's what I had on hand.  I also use shredded sharp cheddar or monterey jack cheeses because that's what is usually in the fridge.  The pimentos and peppers give a nice flavor.  Sometimes I kick it up a notch with some taco seasoning or chili powder.  I often throw in whatever veggies I have on hand like onion, mushrooms, carrots, whatever.  A can of mushrooms is a quick easy way to bulk up the dish.

I didn't have pimento peppers so I used chopped garlic tomatoes instead.  Gave it a very nice flavor.  I also baked it at 350 covered with foil for 30 min, uncovered for 5.  Great meal!

I wanted a little more "kick" so added rotel, minced garlic, and fresh parsley.  Yummy!

family loved it although though it was a little bland myself. added chili paste the second time, gave it a bit more of a kick, but not too hot for the kids as was mellowed down by the cream of mushroom. overall a good recipe

The only reason I am giving this review only 4 stars is the fact it is a bit bland.  My family did like it a lot and I will be making it again.

This was very good! I cooked everything in a 12 in skillet on stove top. Fried chicken and veggies in olive oil. Added mushrooms. I didn't have velveeta so I used about 8 slices Kraft American cheese. I also added some cajun seasoning and tossed it with pasta when it was done. The only thing I would do different is maybe add a little less cheese or a different kind of cheese because between the soup and the cheese together it made it a bit salty. Nice recipe though and east and fast to make. Thanks!

My family and I devoured this dish! I took some advice of some of the others and added about 1/4 cup of milk, I think next time I am going to add a little more. I also added about 2 cups of cheese and cooked it at 350 degrees instead of the 250. It was done in half the time. My 3 and 4 year old loved it as well. I will definitely be making this dish again!! Thanks

This is good. I lived in the South for a few years and you could practically tell what street you were on by the way the chicken spaghetti tasted. This needs a little something. Next time I'll toss in some sliced green and black olives and add a dash of Tony C's, but please give this recipe a try- it's very comforting, filling, and good! I'll definitely make it again.

Very good; I omitted the cheese to make it healthier and just sprinkled some parmesan when I ate it.  Through in mushrooms and tomatoes too; you can really add anything in this.

I just made this dish tonight and it was really great. I did add some more soup, because I like it more on the juicy side. This will definitely be a dish I will make more of in the future. One tip some of the others have suggested is to sauté the veggies in butter first, because they could have been softer. For my first time making this, I was tasty (oh, and I'm not a cook...yet).

This was EXCEPTIONAL!!! My requirements were: Something FAST...Something that could be converted to vegetarian...Something that had flavor...Something down home that everyone would like...And lastly, something I didn't feel guilty serving as leftovers the next day. To make this into a vegetarian dish, (I am a vegetarian, and two of my guests are also vegetarians, however the other two are not). I was able to divide this into two smaller casseroles, using Quorn chicken alternative for one, and regular chicken for the other. Very simple and delicious. I served it the first day of our vacation with a roasted vegetable melange of carrots, zucchini, onion and red pepper. The next day, I had less left over than I expected, so for our lunch, I boiled up more spaghetti, and just added an extra half-can of soup to stretch it to serve three people. It was just as good as the first meal!

I made this today for 60 people. Stayed on recipe with the exception of I added half and half for a little more creaminess. Sometimes I dont always have all ingredient so improvise a little. This was a big hit and will go into my arsenal of great reacipes!

This is similar to my in-laws’ recipe. We added 1/2 a diced onion and some finely chopped celery. Along with paprika and a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained). We didn’t have any spaghetti so we used egg noodles instead. Love it!

Loved it! I didn’t use pimentos but added grilled onion, celery and red pepper. I also used light shredded Tex Mex cheese as opposed to the processed cheese. Will definitely make this again!

My husband and I made this recipe last night. We added some water (maybe a 1/4 c) and another half can of cream of mushroom because other reviewers said the recipe was too dry otherwise. I think the American cheese was too much. This dish was too creamy; I never thought I'd say that! lol I think halfing the American cheese would be best and maybe adding another full can of cream of mushroom with some water. The flavor was good but just unbelievably creamy (in a bad way!). it was almost like eating flavorful paste with chicken. We covered the dish and baked it for 40 mins at 350°. I'd probably try this recipe again but with more tweaking.

Flavor was good although I had to add some Tony's seasoning. But mine turned out dry. I was disappointed. Next time I will cook it on the stove instead of the oven and probably use Alfredo sauce so it will be moist.

This is my first time ever making chicken spaghetti and it tastes delicious!  The only things I did different was omitted the pimentos and bell pepper (not a fan of either) and added 1/4 cup milk because it was a little thick while mixing all the ingredients together. Very good! I’ll definitely be making it again!

I sauté the peppers in butter first and made this with shredded mozzarella instead and it came out absolutely delicious! The guys will like this one too. This is my new favorite pasta dish!

So I cooked a chicken in the crockpot with onion, bell pepper, garlic & onion yesterday with intention to make chicken n dumplings when we got home. Since it was so late I put it in the fridge. Today I found this recipe and I shredded the chicken, mixed it with a can of mushroom soup, rotel, and shredded Mexican cheese. Cooked the spaghetti with the liquid poured out from crockpot with all the veggies. After straining spaghetti mixed it and all the goodness with chicken mixture.  I’m cooking it slow because now I have time. If not I would have cooked it for 30 minuets at 350.

I used mild cheddar instead of american cheese, I also made the sauce in the crock pot using frozen chicken breasts and adding some sour cream and the cheese at the end. No bell pepper in mine. this is probably one of my husband's favorite dishes!

This is a recipe that can be altered to what you have around your house. I used fresh Roma Tomatoes rather than pimento peppers. Also, what ever color bell peppers you have around your house will work too, I used yellow and red. I did try to speed up the cooking process to 350 for 30 min and it's just not enough, I had to bake for longer. Also, I think whatever cheese you have lying around your house would work just fine, I used Colby Jack. This recipe was a perfect guideline for a simple to cook dinner.

Very yummy, easily modified recipe! This is the first time I've made Chicken Spaghetti; I will definitely be putting it into the rotation! My photo looks a little different because I didn't have any spaghetti on hand. I used some egg noodles and it turned out great! I also used diced tomatoes with green chilis and cut up a few pepperonis for a nice kick.

I will definitely make it again.  My kids do not like pimentos so I didn't use them nor the peppers.  I used angel hair pasta and added garlic, salt and pepper.  Will use the garlic mushroom soap next time for more flavor.

I grew up eating chicken spaghetti and now I see why mom made it so much. It's is quick and easy to put together. It's filling and very kid friendly (what kid doesn't like spaghetti and cheese!). And the leftovers reheat nicely. The only addition I made was to add a small can of mushrooms and about 1/2 a cup of milk. It's a hit every time I make it!

This dish was amazing, I tweaked it alil being I was using left over bbq chicken breast and as you can imagine I almost worried how it would pair. Well I used less pimentos and made up the difference with tomatoes with chiles.Substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom, And added bacon.. Mind Blown, The dish had a delightful kick and pulled together beautifully! def throwing this in the recipe box!!

This was so simple and easy. My family isn't the biggest fan of pimento or bell peppers, so I substituted those with mushrooms, and I'm going to try throwing some artichoke hearts in it next time to add a little bit more flavor. An overall hit though. This is probably going to be a staple around here!

I suggest breaking your spaghetti in half before cooking makes it s lot easer to stir everything together

This recipe is so delicious and easy to make. The pimentos are the key ingredient to this dish, really makes it stand out from other chicken spagetti's.  There is really no need to add anything to it than what it calls for. Not even salt and pepper! Its good just the way it is. I just seasoned the chicken breasts with chicken seasoning, little bit of garlic salt, and salt and pepper then cooked it in butter. I will defiantly be making this aagin!

My kids ate it. I felt like it was a little dry. Not bad, maybe tweak it a bit if you want it creamier with more flavor. I added some sautéed garlic and onion, and some extra seasoning. If I make it again, I will add some cream or another can of soup.

I made this recipe to the T and it was really bland for me. I am going to give it another shot and try adding more soup mix and a few spices.

A favorite at our house! Kids and adults love it.  I do add a little bit of onion for more flavor (chopped finely - the kids don't notice).  Makes lots.  I freeze some and have some for leftovers.
