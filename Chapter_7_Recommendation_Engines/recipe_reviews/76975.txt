A fantastic recipe we've made the last few holiday seasons. It's very unusual, and tastes fabulous, way lighter than eggnogg. I cut the alcohol a bit to make it less strong.

We made this last year for Christmas Day and LOVED it.  Its fabulous.  We like eggnog but can't handle the raw eggs.  This was a perfect substitute.  I just found it again so I can make it this year and I will be filing this recipe away in my recipe box this time.  Its a keeper!

Great option to Egg Nog. My Husband really liked it. We didn't freeze. It tastes good refrigerated, didn't last long enough to worry about milk spoiling. Will try a batch from freezer next to see if it makes a difference. ***UPDATE I have made it several times. It has only lasted long enough to freeze once. It is great frozen or refrigerated.Everyone loves this. I plan to freeze and serve for dessert for our next dinner party.

I make this with a few variations.  I use bourbon instead of the whiskey and rum, and I use powdered sugar so its not grainy!!  The nutmeg is what makes it delicious!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! My mother in law and I drank several of these christmas. It tastes like ice cream. I added a little more milk to make it a full gallon of liquid and used spiced rum to give it more flavor, I froze it and then placed in the fridge to thaw (the more milk you add the more it will freeze solid). I had to make another just to make sure we had enough for every one else to try. I was told I have to make this at every function from now on. Thanks for the recipe and this is a new family favorite!

I like so many of Pam's recipes that I had to try this one and it is a 5 star hit. Taste like eggnog but much much lighter which I like and reminds me too of a Brandy Alexander but again lighter. I had a "gold" colored rum so I used half brown sugar and half white and it was excellant. Also used 2% milk. It doesn't freeze solid in the freezer but does get "crystals" from the milk that melt soon after pouring which too is great because it keeps this drink nice and cold. Rum and brandy can be adjusted to taste but I thought it was enough. Will be making this again.

This was such a hit.  Tasted like a grown up milk shake.  I added cinnamon and it turned out great. Will make all year.

I made this the first time using another reviewer's suggestion of substituting spiced rum and it was delicious!  I also used 3/4 of a gallon of milk because others commented that it was too strong in the original recipe.  The drink was great, but the next time I had the idea to add some chocolate syrup to make it a chocolate "milkshake" and that hit it out of the park!  I will be making it that way from now on.

Tasted mostly like a glass of milk. I myself could not taste alcohol at all but a guest said it was strong...either I'm an alcoholic or she's a lightweight! Really didn't find it that strong though. I happened to be drinking a glass when we started a drinking game, and I got through two glasses during the deck, and didn't feel tipsy at all. I might go a full cup of brandy next time. Interesting recipe though, thanks!

I made this for women's poker night and it was a hit.  It tasted so good!  I made it 10 hours ahead and placed it in the freezer in a wide mouth pitcher.  Right before I served it I ploped it into the blender for a second or two so that it was nice and smooth.  This is different and delicious.

I didn't care for this, but I think maybe I don't like brandy.  I'll try it again with just the rum.

This was interesting, different not bad though.  But like another reviewer said, to me it did taste pretty much like your drinking a glass of milk, but with a kick to it.  But a couple of friends that donâ€™t like eggnog did say they liked this, so as an alternative to eggnog this works just fine.  Thanks for sharing.

I've had this recipe for years and love to make it at Christmas! If it is really frozen (I've had it get pretty hard), I will stir in more milk to get a slushy drink to serve. Fabulous recipe!

Excellent recipe!  It's sweet, with a kick, but not cloying like eggnog. It's one of our favorite holiday treats!

A huge hit at our party.  Frozen and then a brief blend is good.  Might up the alcohol a bit and add a  touch of vanilla ice cream before the blend step next time.

First time making eggnog.  Not too tricky and the taste was very nice.  Great reviews form guests who repeated many times "and I don't even like eggnog - but this is really good".

After the first sip I thought it needed something. So I sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on top and voila, I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Dissolve the sugar in the MILK.  Sugar doesn't dissolve in alcohol very well.  Other than that note, I've made this every year since the recipe appeared in Parade, and have brought it to every Christmas and New Year's party I've been to for probably a decade.  I buy rum by the handle now.  (Sailor Jerry's - more bang for the buck!)

Not as good as I hoped. Looks a little like melted curtled ice cream.  The flavor is decent.

I made this recipe for Christmas and everyone loved it. I liked it better than eggnog as it doesn't use raw eggs. Everyone went home with this recipe and I have made it many times (even after Christmas).

what a waste of milk!   too much alcohol flavor and it didn't stay slushy for, it had to be scraped
