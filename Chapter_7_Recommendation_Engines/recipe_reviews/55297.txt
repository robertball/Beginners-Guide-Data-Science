This is very rich and yummy, but it seemed to be a little greasy.  I will probably use less butter next time.

The taste of this recipe was OUTSTANDING. I'm a big chocolate & peanut butter fan and needed a quick dessert for a dinner at a friend's house. I used the Hershey's chocolate Ready Crust crust, blended the ingredients and popped the pie into the oven. I baked for 55 minutes at 350, but the middle was incredibly doughy still. Next time, I'll bake for longer at a slightly lower temperature to try to cook the middle through. We enjoyed this with vanilla bean ice cream -- and got raves for the taste. It's a rich recipe -- the doughiness could have attributed this as well. I'd recommend it -- I bet it'd be a kid favorite (the two-year old at our party slowly ate his slice -- every last crumb!)

I thought this recipe was excellent and very easy too. If anyone wants to make a fast pie this would be the one.

Very, very sweet!  Like cheesecake, it is best served in thin slices.  :)  I'm considering making it again without the crust, using an 11 x 7 brownie pan to create a bar cookie.

This is so sweet so a little piece goes a long way.  I wasnt sure if they sold peanut butter/chocolate chips all in one bag so i bought one of each and just used half. The outcome was delicious but very very rich. I will make this again.

Very easy, fast, and rich!  Would be great with vanilla ice cream.  I followed the directions exactly and had no trouble with it.
