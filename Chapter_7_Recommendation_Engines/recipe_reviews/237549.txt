3 1/2 stars is probably closer to the true rating.  I made these as the recipe stated except with GF flour since we avoid wheat.  My husband said they reminded him of mushy peas, which he loves, but we both think they would be better with sauteed onions and garlic added to the mixture.  And I think I could cut back on the flour next time a bit.  Still, it's a great idea, and I'll make again with some additions to suit our tastes.  Don't skip the freshly grated parmesan...in fact I would add even more next time.

These beauties were a new way for us  to eat our peas.  However, I added 1/2 c.  finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the batter also before frying. I will also suggest that you make the patties as small as possible this makes the frying much easier, and the taste a whole lot better. Lastly, I deep-fried them in canola oil. They were divine!!!!  My son wants them all the time with his pork chops!

These were great!! I highly recommend adding some flavor to these - I did 1/2 tsp garlic and onion powder and next time would add some finely diced red onion. I also added some breadcrumbs because they were very mushy and would not bind. So added breadcrumbs to the mixture and dredged the patties in crumbs before frying. My kids weren't crazy about these, but who cares - I loved them!
