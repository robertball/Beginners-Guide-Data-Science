This was FABULOUS!  I made some slight variations but didn't change too much:   I thought it would make a better stew than a soup, so I only used 1 - 1/2 cups of chicken broth rather than 3 cups.  Also, I used bok choy instead of broccoli.  I love broccoli but it has such a strong flavor on its own and I thought this recipe could use something more subtle.

Very good.  I slow roasted the pork in the oven before adding to the soup to develop the flavor.  I omitted the flour and used green beans instead of broccoli.  Will make again on a cold winter day.

My husband, daughter and I absolutely loved this recipe! I was looking for something to use 2 extra pork chops we had (we are sort of dieting and trying to cut back on how much meat we eat) and this recipe was perfect exactly what I was looking for! Thanks so much for sharing it:)

Fantastic!  I usually make "Ultimate Spicy Spud Soup" from this site when I'm feeling overwintered.  but I was sick of it and I had broccoli and decided to try this.  It is really great.  The taste is soup (very celery tasting, which I like.) But the texture is stew so I added more water. Changes:  More spices, cause I like that.  Also threw in some green beans and pretty much any leftover veggie I had.  Also, I used all chicken stock and only used water to bring it to a consistency I liked. Good as is though.  It's going into rotation.

So GOOD! I wish I had made a double batch. I did use 4 pork chops instead of 2 (they were kind of thin cut) I also doubled the broccoli and halved the potato. 
EDIT: I have made this soup many times now so I wanted to add to my review. I now use the full amount of potato but have increased the chicken stock and water by 1 cup each. I start with the called-for amount of each spice then add according to taste after the first boil. Celery salt makes a good addition. I still double the broccoli but I hold half of it out and right before I serve the soup I flash-steam it for about 2-3 minutes in the microwave then add it to the soup. That bright green of the broccoli makes the soup look extra appetizing.

The whole family loved this. I saved a step by pan frying some thin chops and placing everything together to simmer for an hour. I also added some mushrooms for texture. Lovely!

Love the soup. It's a little salty though. I'll probably either cut back the salt or make sure to get low sodium chicken broth. I browned two Costco center cut pork chops cut into pieces in some olive oil and a clove of chopped garlic. Then, I added the rest of the ingredients as suggested. After around 45 minutes I put the veggies in. I didn't use the flour either. I usually like a thicker texture, but it was great without it this time. Oh, I didn't use broccoli, didn't have any.

I used the crock pot. So I put the spices (all but used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of onions) and boneless, defatted pork chops in the crock with 5 cups of chicken broth until the meat was fork tender. (3 hrs on high) Then I pulled the pork out and shredded it a bit with a forks. I reserved the broth and added the flour, as the recipe called. Chopped all veggies as called for, then added the rewhisked broth and flour when it got bubbly. All in all it took about 5 hours in the crock pot. Everyone was salivating the entire time it was cooking. Excellent recipe!

I thought it was great! I added a few spices to mine like greek seasoning & hot pepper.  Before serving I added fetta cheese and sour cream instead of making the rou! It was great!

THIS SOUP IS EXCELLENT. I would have made it exactly as I had almost all the ingredients. I used what I had. I didn't have broccoli. soy sauce or potato, so I used left over asparagus, a can of Progresso French Onion Soup as a base (the salt) and elbow macaroni. Everyone raved over it. I'll make this again. It is an inexpensive, filling, tasty meal using only 2 chops!!  ....what could be better??

this was a tasty, hearty soup..I made a few changes that I wanted to share.  I replaced oregano with thyme (i don't care for oregano) I also added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, increased the broth to 3 cups (because I used a large can) 2cups of water  I didn't use broccoli or onion (didn't have any) but added a can of cream of celery soup ...before serving I used a potato masher and mashed some of the potatoes and it really thickened up nicely.. enjoy!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I had 2 bone-in pork chops and wondered what to do with them.  Good thing they were huge Iowa chops because my 5 year old went to town on the meat as I was chopping it.  It was so flavorful after cooking in the broth.  I skipped the broccoli...sorry....just couldn't see how that would go together but I'll make this again and again sans broccoli.

Very good soup. To make it easier, I just cut the pork chops up into very small pieces before boiling it. This way takes much less time. Yum!!!

Found it to be quite salty, next time I will omit the salt and use broth with less sodium in it as well, but otherwise a very delicious hearty soup!

I love this recipe! I did add garlic as did island girl.  I didn't have soy so put worchestershire in. I will add that, because I take my lunch to work, I froze this in small batches.  No change to the quality and everyone in the cafeteria loved the fragrance!!  Thank you!

I have nothing but high praises for this delicious soup. It would have been perfect just the way it was presented, and the only reason I made any changes at all was because I used what I had on hand without having to make a trip to the store. I had a bag of stew vegetables and three boneless pork chops that needed to be cooked. I put those in to Allrecipes' search engine, and VOILA! No broccoli in the fridge, but extra celery and some minced garlic. I also cut the meat in advance and browned it in my Dutch oven, just to avoid extra dishes. But, that's really about all I did differently. This soup turned out amazing. And, it made the whole house smell so good while it was cooking, my mouth was literally watering as I ladled in my first bowl! It's definitely a keeper, and one I'll fix again to share with friends and family.

This was pretty good.  It looks and smells delicious, but it was a little too spicy for me.  Not over the top, just too much for my taste.  I ended up adding another cup each of water and broth and that did the trick.  The only thing I didn't add was broccoli because I didn't have any.  I will definitely make it again but with the added liquids.

This was really tasty...I didn't have potatoes but input everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 5 hours (pork chops were already cooked).  I think the main idea is that it's a great recipe to customize to your liking.

Another great way to re-purpose leftover pork chops.  Used 2 boneless cooked pork chops.  Did not have broccoli on hand, and used fresh green beans.  Just sautéed the veggies a little, then added broth, spices and pork to the pot.  Let it simmer till veggies & potatoes were tender - about 1 hour.  Did not add flour and only used 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.  Used low sodium chicken broth and added more of the spices (our taste).  Turned out wonderful!  Will put this on the soup rotation.

Oh my word, sooooo good!  I loved how spicy it was too.  I didn't want to have to cook at night, so I threw everything into the slow cooker on low for about six hours, replaced broccoli with fresh green beans, and we all loved it.

My daughter and hubby loved the flavor. Next time I will add less chicken broth as it was a bit too salty for my liking.

great simple and easy to make recipe. had some extra pork and wasn't sure how to use it and this recipe worked out great. i used about a 1/3rd less chicken broth which ended up in more of a stew consistency and i really enjoyed it. i also used zucchini instead of broccoli since that is what i had on hand.

Great soup! I used leftover pork bones and fatty skin as well as a chicken carcass, which made a rich broth.  I lacked broccoli, so just omitted it. Added whole unpeeled small red potatoes instead of chopped large white potatoes. This was a most excellent soup, and improves overnight. Highly recommend this recipe for using leftover meat bits that will yield a multi-layered flavor palate!

Tried this last night and loved it. I left out the oregano (simply missed it in the list) and doubled the veggies, spices and liquid.  Even better today!  I cut my potatoes in bigger chunks so they wouldn't cook to mush. I used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. Will definitely make again!

I surprised myself with this recipe.  The seasonings were not those I am use to but I did it exactly as written and was very surprised at how tasty it was and how much I enjoyed it!  I love to make soups with extra things in the freezer etc to take for my lunches and this was perfect.   Will definitely make this again...

Honestly, I was hesitant about making this soup because of all the spices and soy sauce. Turned out very good! I sauteed the onion and celery in some oil and added fresh garlic. Also left out the broccoli as I know broccoli gives off a strong flavor in soup.

Really tasty soup!   I went a bit heavier on the garlic powder, chili powder & paprika.   Used potato flakes as a thickener instead of flour.  Great recipe!

Good recipe for cold winter days.  Only changes I made were to use frozen green beans instead of broccoli and I didn't thicken it with flour.  Served it with baking powder biscuits.  Yum!!  Will definitely make again.

I agree that you could omit the salt.  I made a very quick version by using leftover pulled pork from a crock pot recipe.  I just threw everything in together and cut the carrot thinly and used leftover baked potato.  I also omitted the broccoli and added a bunch of torn kale leaves in the last 5 minutes.  I brought the mixture to a boil and then simmered for abut 45 minutes.

Love this soup!!! I didn’t add the flour. I also didn’t have pork chops, I had pork loin chunks and just used those. Very easy recipe to follow!! You can really make it your own!! It’s a good base.

Great soup! I used leftovers from Pork Picnic Pot Roast on this site. I cooked the broccoli in the broth  from the pot roast and added in the spices and one can of chicken broth and one can of corn and the leftover potatoes, carrots, and celery. I mixed the flour with about a half a cup of water  and added it  but that was the only extra water I added. It turned out great!

This combination of flavors in the broth is excellent...a bit on the spicy hot side but not overly so.  I found that the veggies were ready within about 25 minutes rather than an hour and used my leftover previously cooked pork chops (cut into bite sized pieces for the soup) which I added when I started the veggies, making this a very quick soup to make.  I used 4 tsp cornstarch in place of the 1/4 cup flour in order to lower the carbs a bit and added leftover green beans after the other veggies had cooked. From start to finish, including prep time, this soup was ready in about an hour.  Definitely a great way to use leftover pork!

This was very good, I made it twice. I did have to double up on all the spices though. First time around I overboiled the pork and had to add more water. But it turned out awesome. Next time, not so much - all the adjustments I made the first time were perfect, the second time I followed the recipe, and liked my adjustments better. Enjoy!

I made this tonight after searching for something to make with pork chops and broccoli. I followed the recipe except I did not add the flour for I was satisfied with the consistency. I did up the amounts of seasoning because I thought it was bland. I did not have celery, so that and the flour is the only thing that I did not use. Great recipe. Good base to add too.

I really liked the flavor but added cumin to put more "chili" flavor,added a little majoram, added celery seed ! Mushrooms would be good also!

So good. I left the fat on the pork, did about 2 cups broccoli and 2 patatoes and followed the remainder of recipe. Very tasty.

Delicious! My husband is on his 3rd bowl as I type! I used leftover porketta and added cabbage. I’ll definitely make this again!

Another one of my favorite finds on this site. It's so simple, but so yummy. We make this pretty regularly because even the kids like it.

My husband smoke/grilled a large pork butt and we had leftovers so I didn't use pork chops.  I added already cooked pork, all the ingredients (I didn't have celery and I chopped up some small red and white potatoes) and a can of chopped green chilies into my Instant Pot.  I set it to high pressure for 10 minutes with a 10 minute slow release. I stirred in 2-3 handfuls of mixed greens when I removed the lid to boost the nutritional value.  Dinner in less than 30 minutes! 

Note to self: Since I had to use Better Than Bouillon (we were out of homemade chicken stock)  and the pork was already seasoned, I should have left out the added salt as it is just a tad too salty.

I'm always looking for unusual soup recipes. This one is awesome. The only thing you should watch for is the amount of salt you use. Try low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth then taste before adding salt.

Great idea! I tweaked it to make it a bit more "ramen". I added powdered ginger, more soy squad and more liquids. I also substituted potatoes for rice vermicelli and added broccoli at the very end.

Great base for changing it up! I used 3 large leftover bone-in porkchops. I omitted the broccoli, but added 2 large handfuls of fresh spinach, approx. 16 oz chopped tomatoes with juice and a 16 oz can of white beans. Lots of flavor and a huge hit!

Followed recipe, used low-sodium boullion and just a touch of salt - felt this was too salty overall.  Flavor was good - I added in mushrooms and potatoes.  It was good, not my favorite soup recipe from this web site.

Hubby loved it.  Of course I didn't have exact seasonings but used Italian seasoning in place of oregano and I didn't have a bay leaf.  Still delicious.

I loved this soup! I made it quite a bit bigger. I keep my pork chop bones in the freezer and then make a batch of stock when I have a bunch and freeze the stock so I used that. I skipped the broccoli too (I'm not a fan of broccoli in soup). I cut up some boneless chops I got really cheap and fried that with all the spices, then added the veggies once the meat was cooked. I find frying everything before adding stock adds a lot of flavor to soups/stews. I skipped the flour. Thanks for a great recipe!

I marinated the pork in crushed pineapple chunks and olive oil with spices before pouring all of it into the pot for the first hour. The pineapple chunks were removed after 1 hour. 
I did not use chicken broth or soy sauce or flour for health reasons. 
I added spinach during the second hour. 
The pork was sliced thin and it was very soft. Pepper and chili couldn't be tasted at all. I will try to make the soup hotter next time.

Used chicken instead of pork.  Added a few more veggies to bulk it up.  But the flavor and texture was wonderful. Will make again.

Delicious! I had made a Pork Roast so I already had left over pork and a small amount of stock; however, I used all of the listed ingredients except for the Broccoli. I felt it was not needed and did not go with the flavor profile. If you are Gluten Free I think the soup would be just as good as a broth based soup ie No Flour. I will make it again!

I made this today. I substituted beef broth for the chicken, left out the celery(didn't have any), and added a little frozen chopped spinach. You could really use almost any vegetable. I love the slightly Asian flavor the broth and the soy sauce brought, like pork stir fry in a soup. The thickness makes it stew-like. I served it with crusty yeast rolls. It will definitely be in my winter rotation.

I didn't have any broccoli in hand so I added some corn instead. Also, didn't have chicken broth, ended up adding beef broth. Still, this was soooo good! My husbsnd is really picky when it comes to soups, and he loved - even took it work for his next day lunch. This one is worth saving in my recipe box. Delicious!

Omgosh!! Looking for a new way to fix chops, I found this recipe and it is sooo tasty and hearty too!  I added more veggies, things I had in the fridge, mushrooms!  If you're a fan, ADD THEM!  some frozen corn and green beans, I added garlic as well, but of course lol,  it's an easy one pot meal that's perfect for a chilly day!  I added hot sauce too my personal bowl,  I can't wait to make this again! Also  didn't add broccoli and forgot the soy sauce...

I made this recipe for the hubby tonight and I can tell that it will be in heavy rotation this winter. I didn't change much, just added green beans and more celery than the recipe originally stated. It makes for a good, hearty winter meal.

It was delicious with these changes.  I made a large batch to freeze, so did not use potatoes (don't freeze well).  I substituted white beans instead.  I tripled the meat and doubled everything else.  I cut the pork chops into bite size pieces, then browned them in some olive oil.  I set the meat aside and then then I sautéed some mushrooms, then lightly sautéed the rest of the veggies (except the broccoli).  I then removed most of the veggies so I could deglaze the pan with low sodium chicken broth.  Replaced the water with low sodium chicken broth, and used low sodium soy sauce.  Added everything back to the pot and let simmer for an hour.  I skipped the flour, it was thick enough without it. I hate mushy broccoli so I added it at the end and let it simmer for another 10 minutes. Everyone loved it!

I seasoned the chops, browned in a skillet, cut back on salt,eliminated the potato and added some diced tomatoes with jalapeno!That made a difference.Very tasty!

My nephew and I love, love this soup. I always make it the morning after we have pork chops so I can use up the leftover pork. It's just so good!

Great recipe! I've been looking for a way to use pork chops in a soup and this is fabulous!  I cut the actual spices (paprika & chili powder) in half since hubby isn't a fan of spice, but other than that, I follow the recipe pretty exactly.  I also pan fry the pork chops to cut the cooking time in half.  One day when I have more time I'll actually try the boiling for 1 hour method of cooking!

Okay, so the only meat I had defrosted was pork chops and everyone in the house woke up sick but me and the wasn't one can of soup in site who knew pork chops could make a comforting soup.... I remixed it with gumbo veggies and a can of tomatoes and chilies for a kick  of course and just used this for the basics  and sprinkled a dash of cin. & sugar to curve the acid and .... booyah the flavors just transition thru and the finish is full....ummmm LOVED IT!!!!

I made this for dinner one night, it was good, but was a bit on the spicy side. Also, it really should be called pork chop stew, wasn't really soup, too thick. I will make it again, just will tone down the spices that are added.
