So, I love beer.  I love beer so much we plan cross country vacations around trying new beer.  I like whiskey, too.  Whiskey + beer can't be awful, right?  Um, it kind of is.  EXCEPT, I made myself try a few more sips to be sure it was as gross as I thought.  At that point, between the beer (I used a good pale ale) and the whiskey the alcohol kicked it and I couldn't decide if I hated it or not.  I'd planned to dump it, but I ended up finishing it.  Cheers

It's a decent drink... a sweet variant on a whiskey-bomb.  However, the name has been used for a very long time to refer to a shot containing equal parts Jaeger and Peach Schnapps.
