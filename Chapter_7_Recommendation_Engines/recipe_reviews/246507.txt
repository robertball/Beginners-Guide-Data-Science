I swapped a few veggies for this recipe. I didn't use bok choy, instead included zucchini & mushrooms. The recipe came out great and will be making it more often.

Added lots more veggies, and cubed grilled chicken with lemon pepper into the mix.  3 types mushroom,  and 3 types of onions. shallots, fresh spinach, bok choy, bean sprouts, ramen noodles, carrots, celery, and fresh basil. It was so flavorful that my grandsons (16, 15 and 13 yrs) didn't say anything about so many veggies being in the stew.
