I will make it again.  I substituted curry for the hot peppers as I have an issue with spicy food.

I made these for #NationalTacoDay, and they were delicious, especially for being "light." A few notes: first, since the veggies and chicken are not cooked in oil, it can get a little dry. The like juice at the end is important, and I also recommend serving with a little low fat sour cream. Second, I am a salt lover, so I also added a little seasoning salt to the chicken seasoning blend. Otherwise, this recipe makes a good amount of the chicken and veggies, which results in leftovers for breakfast tacos or a salad topping the next day!

We pretty much kept the recipe the exact same and loved it! We thought they were really tasty.  It was a decent amount of work, but made for really good leftovers as well! Thanks for sharing!

I boiled the chicken to make it even healthier, in my mind at least, and it was fantastic. I would make it again.

My husband and I really liked this recipe and will make it again!
We did find it really spicy with the jalapeno peppers, I would cut back on that next time.  Also I did add some butter to my veges since they do get dry.

Not a big chicken taco fan but these are amazing. I forgot the jalapenos when cooking the veggies so threw them in with the chicken which gave the chicken a good flavor.

There was to much like in it. Cut it in half and only use one instead of 2 and it may be better

This was a hit last night with the family.  The fresh lime definitely sets it off.    I added some Mango to the veg mix and it was great.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
