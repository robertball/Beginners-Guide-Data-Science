I loved this recipe, it was easy to make and my husband loved it! I'm the Philly Cheese Steak eater... but I'm glad I was able to convert him! Now there will be many more Philly nights.

I added green peppers too and did everything else the same.  Great.  Oh and other person who commented, it didn't taste Asian because it's a PHILLY Cheese Steak.  Riiiiggghhhttt.

the sandwich was so flavorful and moist the only changes that I made was adding peppers to it and using provolone cheese. Because I like peppers on my cheese steak and that was only kind of cheese that I had

Delicious!  I didn't have teriyaki sauce and used sweet & sour sauce instead -- came out just as good.  Also added green peppers and used Swiss or Provlone cheese and melted it under the broiler for a couple minutes.

It was just OK using cheese spread and Teriyaki sauce, but it was great when I left out the teriyaki sauce and cheese spread, then I added sliced peppers with the onions added the steak slices to the pan and cook until the steak was done. Put the steak, onion and peppers on a roll and top with American cheese for me and Swiss  cheese for my wife.  Just put S&P on the steak to taste, put it under the broiler to melt the cheese a little( Don't melt the cheese in the pan with the steak, onions and peppers.) Now it gets five stars.
 If you truly want a  Philly Cheese Steak don't use Steak-Umms or cheese spread  really.

I changed a number of the particulars here (used frozen Steak-Umms meat, used a brick of neufchatel instead of the cheese spread) but otherwise kept it the same. Very tasty! Only thing I'd change in the future is, if using Steak-Umms in the future, drain the pan before adding the Steak-Umms meat. I'm sure that step isn't necessary if you follow the recipe as written though, as it's the frozen water from the substitution I made that I'm speaking of :) This didn't taste particularly Asian even with the teriyaki sauce, but it did taste good! Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good! I made them as written (except my jar of cheese was larger than 8 oz. and I used more than I should've, lol), but next time, I think I'll go w/ the other reviewers and add some green pepper in there too. Oh, also, I served these on toasted buns...YUM! All in all, an easy and tasty sandwich that I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't do the teriyaki sauce I cooked the steak in worcestershire sauce and kens zesty Italian sauce. I used provolone cheese slices for the cheese too. But very delicious. I cooked both the onions and peppers and steak on medium high heat. I toast the hoagie rolls too (or sub rolls).

It tried this recipe and it was really good. I did do my own twist on it tho. I used kikkoman soy sauce since I didn't have the teriyaki sauce and sauteed my onions with that and pepper, bold and spicy seasoning, and garlic powder. And added the steak slices and simmer it all together.  Then I add my cheeses which was queso blanco, shredded Mexican blend, and shredded mozzarella cheese. Mixed together while hot. Then add Mayo on the sides of hoagie bread, placed the meat with cheese and top off with ketachup, and southwestern ranch. Also did this same recipe with left over baked chicken shredded up. Came out so good!

This was supper easy. I got a pack of stir fry meat at the grocery store, cut those in half then cooked as stated minus the onion. In another pan fried up the onion and added peppers for those who eat them here. My oldest deemed it "The most awesome supper ever" lol. Definitely will make again sometime.

I added green peppers, and otherwise kept it to the exact recipe... I didn't really like it. Something about the processed cheese flavor. It was too salty and too fake for me, and that kind of ruined the entire sandwich. My fiance thought it was okay, and when I heated up leftovers, it wasn't so bad as I had remembered it the day before, but still, I won't make it again the way it's written. What I probably will do, though, is to try this recipe again with swiss or some other similar cheese.

simple, straight forward. 

I would tweak and add some mushrooms and a little more meat but I feel like that's self preference. it's a simple recipe and is quick to dish out.

No I didn't make any changes, and it was quite yummy. Yes I will make it over and over again.  The next time I'll make a dipping sauce, I like mixing things up.

This is not how a the original Philly cheese steaks are made. We call the Asian steaks. The orginial Philly cheese steaks are with onions, American cheese, steak and a roll. Pizza steaks has sauce, mozzarella cheese, onions and mushrooms, green papers if you want. The cheese steak hoagie is with mayo on the roll, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, depends if you want the onions raw or cooked. Mushroom steak has steak, onions, mushrooms, with Swiss cheese. Some people put hot peppers, sweet peppers, ketchup or mustard. If you put the roll in the oven after it is made for a minute or two, then it is a cheese steak grinder. We have been eating these decades before the Asian steaks came along. I tried it once, didn't like the taste. I don't really too many people eat them here other then the Asians.

Im only giving it 3 because, well; Im sure its a good recipe.. it is steak after all, but I come to this site to learn how long to cook something and on what level heat. This person, like so many others; I guess assumes people know what the timing and temp should be, but if we did why would we come to a cooking site right ?? :)

Simple and to the point, I used thinly sliced steak and the onions and teriyaki sauce as recommended in the recipe. I did add peppers (red and yellow) as well and, when I realized that the only cheese spread was spicy Queso, I decided to use provolone slices instead, covered the pan and melted it onto the steak. The whole family loved it. Will make again soon!
