2.18.19  This really does taste like coleslaw, so those brussels sprouts haters out there will never know that theyâ€™re in there.  I love the little punch of sweetness and texture you get from the dried cranberries, only wish the slaw had a little better eye appeal (just a personal comment that may not be an issue to anybody else).  But putting that comment aside, it really tasted pretty good.  Seemed like an awful lot of mayo and salad dressing, so I did cut that back a little, as well as cutting back the oil a bit, too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Question.." creamy salad dressing such as Miracle Whip"  I've always thought Miracle Whip is the same thing as mayonnaise but this recipe calls for both.   Is there another "creamy salad dressing" that can be used instead of Miracle Whip?
