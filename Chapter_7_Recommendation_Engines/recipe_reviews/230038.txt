So delicious. Using sweetened coconut is key in this recipe as it adds just enough sweetness when combined with the fruit to offset the sour cream. The longer this sits, the better it gets.......if you can let it sit long enough.

I read the one negative review and knew immediately a few finer points were needed when putting this recipe together. First, if you do not have 24 hours to let your salad sit over night in the refrigerator than don't make the salad.  Be sure to drain your canned fruit well. I also use much less sour cream than is called for, in fact, I use just enough sour cream to coat all the ingredients, cover, then chil overnight!  Love it!

This is a wonderful salad. I grew up with this salad on holidays. Mom called it her 24 hr. salad. The only thing she did different is add a can of fruit cocktail to the mix. I did not like sour cream, I never knew it was in there til I was older, lol. Also, there was never any leftovers.

My mom has made this same recipe for years and it is a family favorite!  Very easy to make and since it must be made ahead, it is great to take places.

I can't believe this is reviewed as 5 stars!  This is my first review and it is because I want to save people from wasting their time with this terrible recipe.  My mother tried to make this and our family decided that she must have read the recipe wrong--much to our disappointment, we realized it was really that bad!  Don't waste your time...find a new fruit salad recipe!!

Oh. My. Goodness. My mom has made this for years, however, our 5 cup salad actually has six cups...the five listed above in addition to 1 CUP OF CHOPPED PECANS. H-E-A-V-E-N-L-Y. It's the only thing that could improve the above recipe. BE SURE YOUR FRUIT IS DRAINED REALLY WELL!

I've used this recipe for years, passed to me from my mother. I add nuts to mine. The key to this recipe, though, is letting it sit overnight in the fridge. The flavors blend together, and the marshmallow softens...yummy! This will be on my Thanksgiving table.

My mom always made this to take to pot lucks and picnics - fabulous blast from the past!  I used crushed pinapple (only because that is what I had on hand) and it still turned out awesome.  I added some chopped walnuts for a little nutty crunch :)

I've made this for years, my mother-in-law's exact recipe, handed down, and we continue to make it for all occasions.  I added pecans and it is even better.  (My mother always decorated hers with cherries)

A universal favourite from the '50's.  Varients have come out, replacing the sour cream with yoghurt, the oranges with maraschino's,  addition of nuts, etc, but bare bones, as submitted is certainly a  five star for us old guys, that remember our youth so clearly!

First had this in 1982 when visiting Okla.

It's been a favourite ever since.
There's never any left when we 'dish it up'.
We have to put a bit to one side so that we 
don't miss out.  :-)

The coconut threw me off. I think a cup is too much; toasting a handful and using as a topping would have been better IMHO. Everything else was yummy, but the coconut was too chewy and just too much. Thanks for the recipe though! I used colored marshmallows to give it a spring feeling.

I had made this for years when my children were young.  Years later, I made it again!  Nostalgic and yummy!  I used a larger can of crushed pineapple drained and added an additional cup of mini marshmallows!

Love this salad...I do make mine a bit differently instead of 1 cup sour cream I do 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup cool whip, add in maraschino cherries, cut in half just a few for color and BAM delicious!!!

A most beloved fruit salad in our family for three generations. My mom sometimes would add green grapes (sliced in half), making it 6-cup salad.

I love this recipe. I absolutely agree that you have to have at least 4 hours to let the ingredients come together.  The only thing I do differently is I add some maraschino cherries to give it some added color.

I love this recipe, took it to a potluck and it was completely gone. The only change I made was to add some crasens I had left over from Christmas baking.  Beautiful and yummy.

What a blast from the past! I love ambrosia and decided to make this for dessert using reduced fat sour cream and fruit packed in their own juices. Delicious!

I clean a pomegranate as they're in season this time of year & add some seeds mixed into the salad, it gives it an extra bit of color when i sprinkle more seeds on top.

Yummy! Definitely need to make in advance. Much better when you let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. I added pecans (1 cup) and a little less sour cream. So delicious. As stated prior, be sure to drain the fruit well. So good with the pecans added!

We have been making this salad for as long as I can remember. We add cut up banana pieces, use crushed pineapple instead of chunk pineapple and omit the coconut.  You have to make it 24 hours before you eat it to allow flavors to meld.  So delicious!!  Easy - peasy.

Our family has bee making this for the holidays for over 60 years.  I must say, make sure you use the regular mini marshmallows,  not the colored ones.  Once my mom thought the colored ones would be pretty for Easter, not realizing they were actually flavored.  Yuck! Never tried that again!

Yes, Will make  again.  You can always substitute different fruits if you desire.  If using bananas  soak the slices in lemon juice to prevent browning of bananas.

Grew up with this at holidays! Key is to really drain fruit (we let sit in colander in fridge overnight). And, assemble at least 24 hours before serving (let's the marshmallows sweeten the sour cream). Also, we add maraschino cherries for color.

So easy I packed the ingredients, a bowl, a spoon, and a can opener and made it in a motel the morning of a family reunion.  It had barely 5 hours to chill, but it was great and turned out to be my father-in-law's favorite dish at the reunion out of literally hundreds of dishes and that was before he knew I made it!

I drained the fruit in a strainer over a bowl for a couple of hours before I mixed this together.
 I recommend refrigerating OVERNIGHT for best flavor. 
We make this recipe every single year for Thanksgiving and we love it. We really look forward to it. Take the time for the extra steps I've outlined!

I have made this salad for many years. I chop marachino cherries and sprinkle on the top for added color. This is a delicious recipe. I am not very fond of marshmallows but i love them in this salad. You do have to let it sit for a minimum of 5 hours or it will not sweeten up. I very rarely have any left over but when I do, I can tell you it is always better the next day. I have never measured the ingredients,  just eyeball it all. It is a taste preference. I use extra marshmallows.

We have this on Thanksgiving every year and my mom called it 24 hour salad because she always made it the day before so flavors would marry. Sometimes she put Marachino cherries on top for color. She used coconut can to measure all ingredients equal portions and it was perfect every time.

This is a favorite of our family's, a loved recipe from my grandmother who introduced it to the family.  It is so easy to make, just dump everything together (making sure you drain the fruit).  I like to add color to it now and then and add maraschino cherries to it but rinse them off first so the color doesn't bleed and turn everything pink.  Still it is just my additional ingredient, not necessary.  The secret is to let it set at least overnight to let the flavors blend.
