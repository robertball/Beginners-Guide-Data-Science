This is a wonderful recipe!  My family has been making it for over 10 years now, but we called it "Pepperoni Pizza Macaroni."  We also use "hot" Italian sausage which make the dish more spicy.  Yum!

We used turkey Italian hot sausage and turkey pepperoni to cut down on the fat and calories. Great tasting recipe that everyone loved!

This was an awesome recipe! I pretty much followed the recipe but omitted the mushrooms and the olives because my roommate doesn't like either. I also added extra Italian seasoning and about 2 more cups of cheese. I mixed in one cup of mozzarella prior to baking and topped with 1 cup Italian blend, 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup cheddar. I will definitely make this again!

I made this just as written except that I doubled the onion and left out the mushrooms.

This was quite tasty! I did have to make some adjustments according to what I had on hand...I used spaghetti, added some chopped green pepper, used a jar of spaghetti sauce and did not use the milk. I used hot italian sausage, and that went very well in this. My little guy really, really loved it. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Amzingly simple and delisious! My picky 3 year old loved it too! It is a keeper! Those who like a lot of cheese can add more(my husband is a cheese lover).

This is a great dish! Trying to be a bit on the healthy side, I used turkey pepperoni, turkey italian sausage, and wheat noodles. It was very tasty and needed no added spices. This dish along with a spinach salad and wheat garlic bread made a perfect Sunday dinner!

This was good and really easy to make. I thought the milk took away from pizza flavor, but it was still really good. I didn't use ground beef but I added some diced up salami. I miked the salami and pepperoni on a paper towel lined plate for a mintue to get some of the grease out. I didn't use the two lbs of pasta only about one lb and I mixed a couple different kinds together, I only used the 8oz can of tomato sauce and about 1/4 cup leftover jarred pasta sauce. Kept everything else the same. I would make this again, thanks!

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a hit.  I use Hot pork Sausage to give it a little spice.  The only issue I have with this is that it's a little time consumming in perparing but it's WEEEELLLL worth the time spent.  It's awesome and I never have leftovers.

The most quiet, enjoyable dinner in a long time.  Kids ate it all and told me how delicious it was!  So happy to find something the kids will actually eat and enjoy!

I made this for dinner one night.  It was really good however each member of my family has something in here that they don't like.  Next time I will customize each section to each persons liking :-)  But let me just say that this was even better the second day.  This is another keeper for my family.

I was stuck in a rut and wanted something different, now this will be another dish that is added to our 'ususals'! I did it the easy way and bought spaghetti sauce that had peppers and mushrooms, then just mixed it with the pizza sauce along with the other ingredients.  I didnt mix in the olives just sprinkled them on top over half before I put the cheese on so those who don't like olives wouldn't have to pick them out.  To top it off I used a 5 cheese Italian blend. AWESOME!

Both of my children really really enjoyed this meal which is surprising because they're wicked picky eaters...will definitely make it again
