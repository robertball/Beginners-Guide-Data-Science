Great simple rice recipe. Wife loved it. I add a little extra salt because thatâ€™s how I roll. I will make this again soon.

I made a few changes. I used aminos rather than soy and when I ran low on that we used sesame oil.

I added sweet corn and spinach to make it more colorful. Also I had used paprika to give it a spicy texture since my family doesn't like bland food. It turned out wonderful and everyone loved it! Will definitely make it more often.

Used leeks (had to use them up) was still fantastic. Will be a staple in my kitchen. Also makes excellent fried rice with leftovers!

Pretty bland. I'd double everything but the rice if I were to make this again.
