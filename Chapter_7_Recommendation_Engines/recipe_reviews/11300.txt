excellent taste.   most came off sheet without issue.  I think the humidity plays a large factor in success with these cookies.

These are very sweet!  I had trouble with the merangue forming stiff peaks but they still baked up in a nice form.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I don't suggest these. They came out as a huge gooey mess, and impossible to get off the pan, even though I sprayed it. I was excited to see how these turned out because of the reviews, but they were just a mess. Don't try.
