I used different colored peppers and didn't measure the ingredients exactly and I thought it was great! I used brown rice, extra garlic, and cooked it for a total of 1.5 hours. Great flavor, I will be making again!!!

This is a great recipe. I used ground turkey and italian turkey sausage instead of beef. The turkey is lower in fat which offsets the addtional cheese that I add.

Made these last night for dinner changed a few things. I let the rice simmer in beef broth, sautéed  the onions,garlic added carrots and celery with Montreal spice.I also sauté the beef prior to stuffing the peppers.  Mixed everything together adding grated cheese and breadcrumbs. The stuffing was amazing! Stuff peppers and bake in oven at 350 for 45 min.          Also found a zucchini in the fridge. Very delicious!!!! A must try very easy and quick

Although I made a few minor changes I must say that these are the best ever!! I didn't have chunky tomato sauce so just used canned chopped tomatoes and added tomato sauce to get the correct amount. I used shredded pepper jack instead of parmesean. Biggest change was to use my Dutch oven instead of wasting parchment paper and foil. Still followed the temperature and time and they came out perfect! Thanks!!

Our favorite stuffed pepper recipe! We only needed 3 medium sized peppers for our family, so I adjusted to 1 lb. of beef and 1 cup of rice. Still only used half the stuffing mix. I made 4 large meat balls with the remaining, boiled them in beef broth, then drained and put in the fridge. I also saved remaining pan drippings. Two days later, I skimmed fat off the pan drippings, poured it over the meatballs, and heated in covered dish in the oven. Served on egg noodles (tossed with butter & basil after cooking). Yummy again. Will add a little pork sausage next time, as suggested.

The whole family really enjoyed this one.add a few alterations though. I did not put the tops back on and replaced one lb of the hamburger with a lb of hot breakfast sausage. I also put mozzarella and parmesan cheese in the stuffing mix. Then I sprinkled pepperjack cheese on top during the last 10 min in the oven.

Update: I have made this soooo many times now. My family loves it, and I generally make this, due to the color variations, for Christmas Eve every year. I wish I could find a way to thicken the sauce, but it's just the way it goes; expect a brothier sauce with some fat from the beef. However, this my go-to and only stuffed pepper recipe. Thanks again, years later. / Had leftover jasmine rice and have been wanting to make stuffed peppers for a while. I never used a recipe before for stuffed peppers, but this is going in the book. I love everything about it. I scaled to 4 servings, and for the "chunky tomato sauce", combined 8oz. can of tomato sauce and a 15 oz. can of drained, diced tomatoes. Also used ground sirloin, and red peppers. Followed the directions. Easy to put together and baked it for 90 minutes. All I can say is delicious!!! Have passed on the recipe to my siblings before even finishing my dinner. THANKS!

It may just be a difference in preference, but these weren't our favorite stuffed bell peppers.  Stuffing with raw meat and baking yielded drier meat that was sort of caked together, rather than the crumbly, saucy peppers that we were hoping for. Flavor was pretty good, although I might use 1/2 of the garlic this recipe calls for if I were to make it again.

I made this today for lunch and it was a BIG hit. I actually assembled it yesterday afternoon and refrigerated it overnight. I made it as written except for slightly less salt. It was excellent! In the past I have made these where you blanch the peppers first and brown the ground beef. I thought this was so much easier, even though it does take longer in the oven.  The garlic and parmesan cheese gave the dish a wonderful flavor. I'm looking forward to making with half sausage, half ground beef next time. The only thing was that I had to cook it longer than the recipe states. My peppers were large and I have a gas oven which always tends to take longer. I even bumped the temperature up a bit for the first half hour, but it still took just shy of two hours. Thanks for the recipe!

This is undoubtedly the best pepper recipe I've ever eaten. I added a little Italian sausage to the burger and also some herbes de provence to both the sauce and the meat. Wonderful!

I make stuffed bell peppers all the time, but I have never thought to flatten the bottoms or poke holes so the juiced drain. So smart! I am also going to try putting the peppers on a raised cooking sheet so the peppers don't swim in juice the whole time.

I highly recommend putting aluminum foil down as well to help with cleanup. These tasty buggers make a mess.

OMG. Absolutely loved this recipe. Best stuffed pepper's I've ever treated my mouth to. Next time, I've going to try and layer the meat/rice mixture with either Ricotta or Cottage cheese(whichever I have, will drain cottage cheese). This recipe really is amazing, though it did take a bit longer than I imagined to do the prep work. Well worth it though. I used ground turkey to make mine.

I mostly used this recipe as a guide and then, as I usually do, doctored it up accordingly.  Instead of hamburger, I used Italian sausage. I precooked everything so bake time was quicker. I use marinara, chop up the tops and add them to the mix and, because the mix is already hot, bake time is only about 45 min.

This was delicious! I used meatloaf mix (pork, beef, veal) instead of ground beef and regular not chunky tomato sauce. I also found that we liked it much better with red, yellow, orange peppers vs. the green!

Great basic recipe! I made it acc to Chef john's instructions and they came out perfectly! I used 1lb ground beef and 1/2lb sweet Italian sausage. To the meat I added extra garlic, shredded carrots, herbs de provence, and a little sauteed onion along with Chef John's ingredients. I finished off some jarred spaghetti sauce and also used crushed tomatoes. As suggested by another reviewer, I cooked brown rice in the beef stock with a bay leaf and a clove of garlic. When adding the meat mixture to the peppers, I added a little of the tomato sauce half way, then more meat, then topped with more sauce and the lids. I will line the baking sheet with foil next time. My entire family loved it! Thanks, Chef John!!

I have to confess, I don't like peppers!  But, I ate two of these!  I used beef and venison, brown rice and a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce and dried parsley since I didn't have fresh.   Otherwise I tried to follow the recipe pretty exactly.   It was very good and was done in an hour and a half.  I will be making this again, but not in a 9x13 pan...it's just too big.  I'm going to use a taller casserole dish next time.  I had about a cup and a half of meat mixture left over and made six little meatloafs in a muffin pan with that.  It's very, very good!

really great recipe.  I used  ground sirloin and  italian sausage.   I was out of worcestchire sauce so i used teriyaki sauce in its place.  I also used two bags  of Steam Fresh Birdseye  Southwestern style rice (microwaveable) which saved some time. I used two bags to cut down on the meat and plus we love rice. This was a great recipe that i topped off with a slice of provolone under the broiler for a few minutes ( to brown).  This was easier to prepare than my usual recipe.

This is a very simple all in one meal to prepare and easy cleanup. The sauce, although quite basic, had a nice flavor and went well with the peppers. The filling was practically a meatball in consistency after baking which I liked, but my wife said she would prefer more rice and less meat.  I wanted to follow as written so didn't read others' tips and overall this makes a nice dinner, especially with hot sauce. Next time I will likely add some additional seasoning and possible use yellow rice to enhance things a bit. Keep helpin me look good Chef John!

This recipe reminded me so much of my momma’s stuffed bell peppers when I was growing up! I love how flavorful Chef John made it with the added red flakes! Perfect! I did notice that the video says 1/2 cup of beef broth but the recipe says 1 cup. I think 1/2 cup should be used in order to have a little thicker sauce! Honestly, this is a must try recipe because it is spot on! Love this and thanks Chef John!!

I always loved my mom's stuffed peppers growing up which was basically meatloaf, stuffed in raw green peppers. When I got older and looked up the recipe, I saw it had rice, the meat was sauteed and peppers blanched first. I just went back to my Mom's way. But this recipe is my Mom's on steroids. I added 1 egg and a little bread crumbs to the meat mixture and used Italian diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce. It was delicious! The sauce is so good; helps keep everything moist. He's right, the cookie sheet makes it take longer but found it cooked evenly. I like the suggested way to cut the peppers and using the lid. You can get alot more meat in there. I made 4 and heaped them high like an ice cream cone. This will now be my go to recipe.

Made this last night and it was delicious! I did use green peppers instead of red and I switched out the rice and used Farro in its place. Next time I'll also add more onion since we all love the taste.. Also, since I went a little over on the quantity of meat, I rolled the remaining meat mixture into tiny meatballs and put them in the sauce in between the stuffed peppers.

I used red bell peppers, Italian sausage instead of ground beef and quinoa in stead of rice (diabetic household) and used very little salt..  Used mozerella cheese cause that's what Ihad on hand.  I made 3 for me and 3 for my husband who likes a more spicy flavor.  In his I added Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy Seasoning and a pinch of habanero. They were delicious and we will definitely make them again.  My husband who is a Picky Eater and was quite hesitant about trying this, loved his. They re-warm up very well in the microwave.

I microwaved the peppers for about 7 to 10 min, in order to soften them, also precooked the sauce on stove. I was running late on time, yes I'll  cook this again.

Came out great, even my two year old was  eating the peppers! I only used a pound of ground turkey, and I added all the reserve tomato sauce to the meat mixture. After stuffing, I used the sauce from the pan to garnish the tops. And I used curly parsley, it was amazing. I did follow the recommendation to put a cookie sheet under the dish. I think this helped keep them moist, and the bells slightly crisp. I used orange bells.

Had lots of left over rice so added it to browned up ground beef, onion, jalapeno and our seasoning preferences.  I cut our peppers lengthwise ( personal)  and baked with some seasoned diced tomato, about 45 min.  Very nice, easy dish.  Would love to try with Italian sausage.

First time having stuffed peppers. Used this recipe. Turned out awesome.  I loved the heat from pepper flakes.  Used  Rinaldi spag sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. Will definitely make again.

Great dish, but takes much longer to cook.  We now cook the ground beef about 50% prior to placing in peppers, as you still need enough time to soften the peppers.

I precooked the meat. That felt safer. I love the Italian flair. Next time I will do half Italian sausage. I also added shredded cheese to the top after the spoons full of tomato sauce. I think it needs more sauce in the peppers.

Was in a pinch for time, so wanted to cook everything first.  Here were my changes:
-Just sliced the tops off 5 peppers (no other messing with them), and roasted them 15 min @ 425 by themselves right on the oven rack (needed double this or increased heat)
-Cooked the 1/2 finely cut onion and tbsp garlic in a pan, added half to the sauce at the bottom of the baking dish, left half in the pan.
-Added sweet italian flavored ground chicken to the pan, added ~ 1T of it. seasoning and cooked until done.
I followed the rest of the recipe & these turned out fabulously.  Next time I'll use a little more sauce in the meat mixture, which is how my mom used to make them.  My husband and I both said "keep!" to this recipe.  I'll make these again!

I used 1 cup mozzeralla and 1/2 parmesan. I also substituted the parsley for oregano, thyme, and basil. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth because...well...oops. I added in spinach and mushrooms. I used Prego three cheese tomato sauce.

Loved this recipe!  Brought back memories of Mom making stuffed peppers when we had an abundance of bell peppers in the garden. I made this recipe gluten-free and dairy free because of food allergies in the family.  Wonderful and easy to make.

Next time I make rice, I will make enough extra to have a head start on this recipe.

I made this recipe and substituted turkey instead of beef and it was a major hit! Even my meat and potato husband tried some of the bell pepper. That says a ton!

I've made this keeping to the exact ingredients and it's a winner. However, tonight I made it again but noticed I didn't have enough ground beef so, I took some cooked pork chorizo I had in the freezer to make up for the ground beef. 
It was five stars before...but with the chorizo it's six stars.

First time making stuffed bell peppers I wish I can upload my picture it was pretty good I think if I would have let the bell peppers cook a little bit more longer it wouldn't be so hard but yet soft and some places the ingredient was definitely easy to make with the hamburger seasoning and cook rice and onions I'll definitely try it a different way but overall it was okay.

Each year I end up with an excess of bell peppers from my garden at the end of the summer & decided to try this recipe. Omg, so delicious. I did a few things differently.  I cooked the onions with the ground beef before adding remaining ingredients & stuffing the peppers, and I used about 2 cups of roughly chopped fresh tomatoes mixed with a 15oz can of tomato sauce. And, I mixed the broth with the tomatoes and then poured it over the peppers before baking them, rather then pouring them individually into the bottom of baking dishes.  This is now my “go to” stuffed pepper recipe!!

I did not use a pan underneath and I used a glass baking dish so it only took 1 hour with the foil and then it was done. I also used pepper jack cheese instead and I thought it added a nice spicy flavor to the recipe

Great recipe! Stuffed Bell Peppers are my dad’s favorite. I make mine similar, but I add a can of chopped tomatoes, a can of tomato sauce, and chopped zucchini to the mixture! I skip the cheese, and add a dash of tomato paste on top before I bake. I’m telling you, it is amazing, and there’s never leftovers in my house!

My family loved it! I made extra rice & served them over rice w some of the sauce they were cooked in over the top w Parmesan cheese. I used grated Parmesan bc that’s what I had. Very true to directions & can improvise as needed! I have enough stuffing for 3 large meatballs to place in pan for my son.

My mom made stuffed peppers, tomatoes, onions and zucchini.  She's getting to the point where she forgets what she uses for the ingredients.  Man, this is BETTER than my mom's recipe!  I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground sausage.  I had Romano cheese on hand, too.  Typically, I would just eat the stuffing and not eat the outer veggie unless it was the zucchini.  This time, I used red and yellow peppers since they're more palatable to me.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe.  This is definitely a keeper!

Chef John, you have yet to let me down! 
Your recipes are on point and the instructions are so easy to follow.
Perfect recipe exactly as is!!  I doubled the recipe and froze half of the stuffed peppers with the sauce in a separate freezer bag.  My family LOVED it so much the first night, they decided to pull the frozen ones out to thaw for the next day :)  The frozen tasted just as good as the freshly made...will definitely make another double batch soon!

I think the beef broth mixed with the tomato sauce in the pan is the key!

I'm in the process of making this now but in the video you say to use 1/2 a cup of broth but the recipe says 1 cup. You said put 2 1/2 cups of tomato sauce in the pan but then we need more to put on top of the peppers and the same with the parsley. I'm just a little confused but hopefully it turns out good...

This dish turned out delicious! A big winner w the family. Since we are lactose intolerant  I took a chance and left out the cheese and it was still great!!! I did cook it a little longer at 1.5 hours and I’m glad I did. The peppers were perfect ... slightly firm... 1 hour would have left them a bit undercooked.  The meat was cooked perfectly!

It was delicious. The only change I made was that I stuffed hatch peppers instead of bell peppers. They’re in season for such a short time that this was a great way of enjoying this excellent delicacy.

I love this simple recipe, I've been making them for about 4 years, it's a hit! I made them today using bison meat, my new obsession lol. Your family will love this recipe, I haven't strayed from the the technique or the basic ingredients too much and they always come out delicious.

The only changes I made is the rice was not leftovers. In the family it's typical to have leftover rice, so I decided to give it a try. It came out awesome and I will definitely give it another try with our leftover fried rice instead. Thanks!

This was a good recipe but I didn't have the right stuff....I had Minute Brown Rice that I didn't cook...I didn't brown the ground chuck, I cut the onions very small and didn't soften them....cooked the dish hour covered and a half hour uncovered....I also added a can of Italian tomatoes 1/2 in making meat and rice stuffing and half with the tomato sauce, I only had a 8 ounce can.it turned out great and was moist and rice was done very flavorful...Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I added an egg and some pasta sauce to the pepper mix. Didn't use Parmesan cheese, I used a cheddar mix. Also topped the peppers with cheese for the last half hour. Otherwise this is a keeper!

I love stuffed peppers.  I made one addition and added 1/2 c corn based on another review of being dry. I had read where vegies are good to keep meatloaf's moist so there ya go. Baked in a covered dutch oven because I had no foil on hand. Turned out great. Will make again and again.

Wow! So very tasty. I used Campbell's tomato soup and doubled the amount to use in the mix, otherwise kind of dry.  I used 50/50 hamburger and pork sausage and 1 egg. This is  by far the best peppers and will make many time more. Enjoy!!

My go-to recipe for stuffed peppers!  I used to make them a certain way for 10 years, but this is the way I make them from now on.  I absolutely love the onion and tomato sauce these peppers cook in.  It is so good spooned over the peppers, and a lot of times I have leftover sauce that I can re-use in other recipes, or enjoy in a bloody mary.  This is a classic, simple, comforting dish that everyone will love.  I can't wait for Fall/Winter to roll in so I can start using my oven again!!

This will definitely be a recipe we use often. Made it exactly as directed with one small Edition mozzarella. I'm sure would have been just as good without it. GREAT RECIPE!!! We  have a large family so I doubled up on recipe with leftover meat made meatballs was excellent no leftovers.

These were wonderful.  I didn't have the fresh parmesan so I used cheddar and some parmesan from a shaker.  Instead of tomato sauce I used crushed tomatoes. The peppers were wonderful!  My friend made them and loved them too.  Definitely worth the time and effort.

This is a great recipe!....although I changed a few details. I did not use tomato sauce, my husband hates it. Instead I put about 1/3 of a tomato, diced, in the pan. I also opted out of beef broth and simply used water instead, only because I didn't realize I had no beef boullion. I put half the onion in the meat mixture and half with the tomatoes and water in the bottom of the pan. It was a huge hit with my family!!!

I normally mix all ingredients and spoon into the peppers.  I was skeptical about putting the moisture ingredients into the dish and only poking holes in the skins of the peppers for moisture exchange... I even baked on convection, which should have made the dish very moist.   My suspicions are confirmed.  The peppers and stuffing were dry and rather tasteless, even after spooning some of the sauce over them.  I'm going back to my old recipe.  At least it has some taste.

I followed all the instructions but I felt the peppers were not as juicy as I expected them to be, the meat was more of a hard ball in the middle. The taste of the filling was good. I will try them again but this time i think i will cook the beef separately.

I made this last night for dinner. Hubby and I really enjoyed it, we switched the serving size down to four so there would be leftovers to take to lunch. Really glad we did that. Only thing I would change is the amount of sauce, I would prefer there to be more sauce and thicker.

Really easy recipe. I didn't put the tops back on. And next time I'll season the meat a little heavier. Highly recommended this though. Even my daughter (who hates bell peppers) liked it.

I think this is one of the best Beef and Rice Stuffed Pepper recipes I've ever made. The beef is very flavorful and the sauce is delicious. I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound mild pork sausage. I used both sweet red and green peppers that were quite large.

Just made this, very good. Keeper recipe, will make again. I did as another person did, used one can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Did bake for 2 hours though. I used red and orange peppers, just like the flavor of those peppers better.

Made it essentially by the given recipe but took a few shortcuts: used dried onionbits in the sauce and the same tomato sauce in the meat as in the pan- not a chunky one. Of course I had to sprinkle more grated cheese on top towards the end. Everyone loved it from the 1 yr old to the 70 yr old! Will be making this again.

I grew a lot of bell peppers and have been searching for a recipe and came across this one.  It reminds me of my grandmothers so thought I would try it.  :)   I changed a few things,  I had just made homemade salsa (pico) so I used this along with 1 cup of canned tomato sauce.    I did not use the parsley but had cilantro in the salsa.  Really liked this and will do it again.

Double batch for lunches and freezing. Very good but second batch turned out better. Additional parsmesan and a little mozzarella as well as diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  My new favorite stuffed pepper recipe. Also added quite a bit more garlic. Personal taste. Excellent. Much easier than par-boiling peppers like my old recipe called for. The parsley was a different twist too.

I made this for dinner tonight and it is an excellent recipe-- very close to my mom's!
I made it with red peppers because we're not fond of green. I didn't change the recipe at all. I already got a request to make this again!

Even my kids love these peppers! I used ground chicken, instead of beef.  I used some dried parsley instead of fresh. Will do less salt next time.

Loved this dish!

 The only changes I made is - I added fresh Basil to the mix and topped the peppers with a slice of melted cheese when they were done.
