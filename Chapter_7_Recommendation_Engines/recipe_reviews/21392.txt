My 3yo ate this.  That by far is an accomplishment!!!!  I did take the advice of others.  I cut the chx broth to 3 cans.  did not have roma tomatoes so i used 2 cans of diced plus about a cup of crushed tomatoes. i also added crabmeat, i would not recommend wasting money on lump meat, in the end its not lump anymore.  i did not add the shrimp with the other meats (for 20mins due complaints of them being rubbery).  I waited until it was done, turned the pot off, then added the shrimp, stirring occasionally.  they were done and perfect in about 10-15mins. this also served as my cooling time.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!!  oh yeah if don't have sweet onions on hand use reg onions and 1 1/2 teaspoons of white sugar.

This was my second try with this recipe and my third try at gumbo. My first attempt was when I was wooing my wife and I went a bit overboard with the seafood (about a $60 pot of Gumbo). The first time I tried this recipe it came out great and my wife and I both loved it. Just made it for the third time and it is the best yet. As I have been told Gumbo is all about the roux. My first tries I  was paranoid about burning it so I proceeded before the roux was ready. This time I used medium/low heat and took my time. It took about 35 minutes, but it was well worth it. Roux should be a nice medium brown (at least a little darker than peanut butter). A good roux has a delicious nutty aroma and will make a good recipe phenomenal. Thank you so much for the recipe and the comments!

Glad you all like the recipe. Been a few years since I worked on this one.  Try adding some oysters and lump crab meat.  You will love it.  The recipe is only soupy until you add it with rice.  Shred a Cooked Chicken instead of using Raw for better texture.  Also, I add roasted & peeled Poblano peppers now and I also use a bock beer for depth of flavor.  Won Gumbo Cookoff May 2012 with this recipe!!!!

Hot Diggity Dog! THIS IS AWESOME! If your in the mood for some foot stomping, "toe-curling" gumbo - this is the recipe to try! Even if you've never had gumbo before - this would be a great recipe to convert you! Per others, I reduced the broth to 5 cups, increased the chicken and used "smoked cajun sausage" (and more of it). Also, I drained a can of tomatoes instead of chopping the roma's and used a green bell pepper instead of the red chile peppers. Thick, hearty, spicy (but not hot) and great over rice. Makes a ton but it we can't wait for the leftovers! Thanks so much Jason and Lupe! This recipe deserves nothing less than five stars!!!

This was very good.  Once my roux browned I transfered to my slow cooker and continued with the remaining ingredients. I only used slightly more than 2 quarts of bouillon, was perfect and do believe 3 quarts would have been way too much broth.  I used all bouillon and no broth actually.  The 'Better Than Bouillon' brand of chicken bouillon is the best I have found.  Used 1/8 cup of McCormick' Cajun and 1/8 cup to Tony's Creole, one dried red chili pepper and one green chili pepper seeded and vein removed, then minced.  I also added okra.  What works best for me is to sautee the okra in olive oil until it is no longer 'sticky', this method takes the 'slim' out before adding to the gumbo.  I only cooked the shrimp 10 minutes after turning my cooker off and it was perfect.

This is the best thing I cook!  I love it.  It is soooo flavorful and has quite a kick.  I am new to cooking and this is a challenging recipe, but I have made it more than any other recipe I have because it is so worth it.  It makes a lot so I freeze half and I think it is even better reheated.

I have made some changes to the recipe too: 
I cut back on the broth, omitted the sausage (health reasons), omitted the shrimp, doubled the chicken.  I didn't find that the shrimp was worth the effort since the chicken is so good in it anyway.  I add the entire can of tomatoes with peppers.  Double the celery.  Also, I don't fry up the chicken, I just let it cook right in the soup.  It's much easier that way.  

I never reviewed a recipe before, but I like this one so much I made an exception.

made this a  day ahead so the flavors could marinate. It has a  kick to it and turned out pretty good . shared it with family and friends. Also took the  shells from the shrimp and baked them at 375 until golden brown and add them to the beer and chicken broth and cooked for 1-2 hours add alot of  flavor to the broth. good use for the shrimp shells nothing goes to waste this way.

I picked this based off all the reviews.  First time I tried making  gumbo and I was very impressed.  A little vague on what kind of cajun spice to use there are so many to choose from.  I used Tonys Creole...a bit high in sodium.  All in all this gumbo rocked everyone was pleased.  I added Okra to it which I was surprised not to see in the ingredients.  I used Tecate Beer I wondered if what beer really mattered.  This one is a keeper! The only downside is prep time I hope your good with a knife watch dem fingers!

I reviewed several of the gumbo receipes on this site, and I followed this one more than the others.  However, I chose to do the roux with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour.  It cooked beautifully, darkened nicely and wasn't oily.  I also used Andouille sausage (it's a must). 6 cups of chicken broth(low sodium) was plenty. You don't need to cook the chicken separately, I simply added it with vegetables and it cooked fine. I used 4 cloves of garlic, added a red bell pepper and one chopped jalapeno pepper, along with the other vegetables. I used 1/4 cup of Cajun seasoning, 2
tsps of red pepper sauce, and a 
tablespoon of file powder at the end (a must). My husband went nuts over it (we like spice), served it over white rice.

From a deep South LA girl:  Really tasty recipe, but needed one big revision, in my opinion.  Made as is, this recipe is way hotter than many of us even in S LA like it!  Contrary to popular opinion, Cajun food is supposed to be spicy as in flavorful with lots of seasoning, not so hot you can't eat it.  Most Mexican food we eat is way hotter than our good Cajun food.  That being said, as we eat it is still way too hot for most Yankees.

Anyway, it is better without the 2 TBSP fresh chilis and I prefer only 1 - 2 TBSP of Tony's Creole -- each seasoning is different, but 1/4 cup of Tony's would be so salty we'd gag eating it, and we like things pretty salty compared to most.

Having always made my roux with butter rather than olive oil, which is our traditional way, I was interested to try the oil.  It turned out very well, good for those people who believe butter is bad for you.  Not being a believer in that theory (since most of my family lived to 100 or so eating tons of butter and animal fats their whole lives), I will probably use butter most of the time.

I also use chicken thighs rather than breasts.  Don't put the garlic in the roux as that burns too easily.  Sautee veggies first.  Add 1 cup Okra last 10 min.  Not liking overcooked shrimp, I sautee them separately in garlic-infused butter (2 TBSP) w/ bit of salt and pepper for 3 minutes.  Also, put in 1/2 lb sausage for flavor, but serve another 1 lb fried sausage with the cooked shrimp on top of ea serving. Then, YUM!

Chicken breast is too dry (use thighs and boil them in water to make your own chicken broth - the skins, fat and bones give it a better flavor), use anduoille sausage, start with a good roux and this recipe would be passable.  Keep this in Texas - it ain't cajun!!

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! This is the first dish I made for some new found friends that are serious about their food! I am glad to report that they went back for seconds, and then thirds!! Not a drop left!! 

I also doubled the chicken, and might even go so far as to double the sausage and shrimp next time... a permanent recipe in our household! YUM!!

This was really good, but it was too salty.  I used Zatarain's creole seasoning which I will use less of next time or add more water.  I would definitely use a better sausage than pork links next time.  I would suggest andouille.  It makes a whole lot, so I may half the recipe next time.  My freezer is overloaded with leftovers!

Num, num! This recipe was the first time I have ever tried gumbo or Cajun food. I made it twice because a friend of mine who lived in Louisiana for a while asked me to make her some more :) The main change I made the second time was less oil in the roux - I cut it to 1/2 cup. The flavor was as good or better and I didn't have to skim a ton of oil off the top. I had to use dried red chiles, but it still tasted great!

Wow. This gumbo was very, very good! *said while eating leftover gumbo FOR BREAKFAST*    A couple of notes:    I substituted the Roma tomatoes for an extra can of diced.    My andouille sausage was raw so I removed the meat from the casings and browned in the olive oil as directed for the chicken.     Conversely, my chicken was rotisserie, so I didn't throw that in with the sausage until the last minute - just enough time for it to sink in some flavor before draining.    My beer was Modelo Especial and that was a fine choice. I'm not sure any mainstream beers - American or Mexican - would be anything less than what you'd expect. No complaints there.    I added frozen okra - mostly because I like it fine and I happened to have it on hand. I think it added not only some color, but also a nice balance texture-wise. Okra is a personal call though.    I skipped the parsley - no fresh to be found at the store and my dried was about 6 years old. It went straight to the trash. And I can honestly say that I my unsophisticated palate did not miss it one bit.    While others have mentioned the end result being too soupy and suggesting less broth, I have to say, I didn't mind the 3 quarts called for. And judging from my breakfast, it continues to thicken even once cooled.    Be warned though - the recipe says it yields 10 servings. More like 15-20, depending on how big the servings are.

I think i have spoiled my guests with too many good recipes...now i just get "that was good, it always is"....i made this gumbo last night to let the flavors 'get happy' over 24 hrs...served it tonight and people were literally slurping the juices off their plate....everyone said it was the best dish i have ever made! left out shrimp and doubled chicken and sausage...and it could have even used a little more meat than that (but we're big meat eaters)...used Hillshire Farms hot smoked sausage and it worked very well.  **Update 11/12/08**  My friends are still talking about this dish on a regular basis, begging me to make again.  Served it to my family recently and all said "restaurant quality".  Its a lot of work, but its so worth it when everyone makes such a big deal!! :) :)

Lupe and Jason, A++++ on your gumbo!!! I darn near followed it to a tee, but had to make a few changes based on what I had and bc I wanted it to be my own. Used 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 c olive/canola oil blend and the 1 c flour. Roux seemed thin, only cause i'm used to gravy. It does take 30-35 minutes (of constant stir/mixing) to get browned enough. Roux is key. Used a whole lb of Andouille sausage, shredded the breast meat of a cooked chicken and 2, yes 2 pounds of shrimp (51-60 ct) Shrimp went in at the end of cooking.Also, used Margeret Holmes Tomatoes and Okra (2 cans). Served with rice and a glass of wine, didn't have any Zydeco music.... maybe for breakfast.? So good!!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!

I accidentally bought "fire roasted" tomatoes and green chilis; the end result was wonderful.  Also, because this will be used for lunches for a whole week (and shrimp does not keep more than a couple of days), I cooked the shrimp inside a fry basket suspended in the cooking gumbo until they just curled and took them out and froze them; they will be added, straight from the freezor, a few at a time as lunch is packed.

I reduced the chicken broth to 2 cups and used boneless pork instead of chicken. This is a great gumbo!

We loved this!  But, I did change a couple of things......yes, I'm one of those people!  Instead of olive oil, I used a stick of butter and bacon drippings to make the roux.  It took a good 40+ minutes of constantly stirring to get it that perfect dark brown color.  Also, I simmered chicken thighs in the broth, bone-in, skin on & removed both upon serving. It just wouldn't be southern cooking without the fat!  I only used 2 TBSP. of cajun seasoning as the type I have on hand is way too salty.  For the sausage I used anduoille and didn't add the shrimp until the very end after it was taken off the burner, otherwise followed this recipe.  It was a perfect blend of spiciness with smokiness. And of course, served it with rice which helped tone the heat down a little.

This is the best recipe ever!!!! I have to give the recipe out to guests whenever I serve. Just a few changes.  WOW--1/4 Cajun seasoning is a bit much for me. I cut back to1/2 this amount.  I also leave off the 2 TBSP fresh red chile peppers.  If your guests need some heat...give them the Toncy Chachere's Creole Seasoning... let them heat it up!  I add about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of okra. What is gumbo without the okra!!  The secret really is in the roux.  While it is a pain, you need to stir the olive oil and flour for a good 30-45 minutes to get a dark brown roux.  That makes it the best of best!  Yum, yum.....I just ate some and my mouth is watering again!!!!!  Serve over rice and with some sourdough bread.  Make you slap your ...well somebody!

The flavor of this was excellent! However, it was quite oily. And there was quite a lot of liquid compared to the meat and vegetables. I'll make this again with a few changes: Most likely I'll use less chicken broth and more flour. I'll add more meat and double the vegetables. I added okra this time, but not enough. It needs atleast 2 cups. And the seasoning could be cut down a little.
Still very good flavor though. For the beer I used Coors Light.

Yee haw!  Not for the fainthearted.  I made a big pot for a Superbowl party and it went down to the last ladle or two.  People raved about it, but I heard a few people proclaiming about how spicy it was.  Modifications:  5 cups chicken broth instead of 3 quarts, used not quite a pound of chicken, sprinkled cajun seasoning over chicken while cooking to add flavor, used Aidell's andouille sausage, and next time, I will only add shrimp until about last 5 minutes or so of cooking.  The only cajun seasoning at my grocery store was "Cajun's choice creole seasoning."  Worked well.  Definite keeper, crowd pleaser for those who like heat.

I have to admit - I was skeptical about this recipe.  I am used to adding my onions and other veggies directly to my roux and cooking them down a bit before adding liquid.  I was afraid that, with this recipe, the onions would still be crunchy when it was time to eat - but this did not happen.  I followed the recipe exactly as given (except I used only 1/2 bunch parsley).  The only reason I gave this recipe a 4 star instead of 5 is because the 'gravy' was a bit thin for our taste.  But this gumbo certainly did pass the 'taste test' for our Louisiana family!

My husband, born and raised in Louisiana, and I agree that this isn't really gumbo.  I followed all directions closely, but I ended up with a soup-like something.  It just wasn't very good.

This was good, but to me and my family, it just didn't seem like a REAL gumbo. And it was quite salty. I think I'll just keep looking for that down home gumbo I'm used to. But if I ever make this again, I will definitely half the recipe, as this could have served closer to 20 people than 10. And will try to add my own flair into it to improve upon it. Just okay for us.

This is a winner every time!  Even my 3 year old loves this gumbo!  The only change we make is omitting the diced pepper and using less broth.

This is one of about 3 recipes that I will actually make over and over again! The first time I made it, we had a first-time dinner guest, and he actually asked to take some home with him!!! I follow ingredients to the letter, however, after the meat browning and making the roux, I dump everything in the crockpot on high for about 4 hours (I add the shrimp in the last 20 minutes). It is perfect. It is very, VERY spicy though due to the temp of the cajun seasoning I used. Everyone eating loves spicy food so it was just perfect for us. This really is a five star recipe and I highly recommend it!

I had been using the same gumbo recipe for over 20 years when I came across this recipe. I decided to make it based solely on the number of positive reviews it has received. Well it is now my new gumbo recipe. This was wonderful.....the taste is outstanding. It does require a bit of prep time. After reading many of the reviews I decided to stay with the amount of broth in the recipe. So glad I did. Many stated it was runny, but luckily I didn't encounter that issue. Most likely because I increased the amount of both meats and the shrimp. We are serious carnivores! And since my sweetie was born and raised in Louisiana I had to add okra and 2 tablespoons of file ( can't imagine making gumbo without it). Since the file also acts as a thickening agent the consistency was perfect.  I also didn't encounter the issue others mentioned of it being oily. The roux came out a beautiful brown color. I used a can of Stella Artois beer, and Slap Your Mama Cajun seasoning. I did not use the total amount of seasoning, simply because the broth, meat and sausage also added flavor. I believe it would have been too salty. The man from Louisiana said it was one of the best gumbo's he has ever  had! Thank you for sharing!

This stuff was AMAZING!  I used andouille sausage, cut the broth in half, doubled the meat and substituted okra for celery, great stuff!!  If i had followed the recipe i think it would've been way to liquidy, even with the broth cut in half this recipe makes a ton of gumbo

I thought this recipe was really good. I threw in some chipotles. Delicious! My hubbie didn't like it though. I added a lot more meat and veggies to recipe. And, I split the recipe in half and still had to use a large pot!

It's SO good!  But we also found that there wasn't enough meat, so the second time we cooked, we added twice as much shrimp and more sausage.  Perfect!  thinnking about adding okra next time to:)

I loved this recipe and so did the family! I think its the sort of meal you could throw in whatever else is in your store cupboard - I had an elderly zucchini which I sliced and added. This will be a favourite and I've sent it to friends too!

This was a little salty for me, but the men in my family loved it.  if you read the other reviews and use less broth then consider cutting back on cajun seasoning. Also, less celery.

I enjoyed making Boudreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo. The only thing more enjoyable then making this gumbo is eatting it. I left out the red peper in attempt to keep the gumbo mild, to no avail. I also took the advse if others and cut down the amount of chicken brooth to about half. Non the less the receipt is a keeper. Many thanks for posting it.

I chose to make this gumbo first and read the recipe second.  If I had read that the roux was made with olive oil I don't think I would've made it, but decided to go with it as per recipe.  The roux seemed to just deep-fry my flour until brown, and only tightened up after the broth was added.  And a whole cup of olive oil??  No thanks.  I cut the flour and oil in half, especially since I of course cut the broth to 3 cans.  It was okay, but I wasn't impressed.

This was an outstanding dish! I think what really put this over the top was using Joclyn's Creole Seasoning Blend from here. Followed another user's suggestion, and after making the roux, I put everything in the crockpot (2 can chick broth, 1 Stella Artois, 1/2 turkey smoked sausage, diced green pepper, and everything else as written in the recipe) and left it in there all day on low, til 10 min. prior to serving, at which point, I tossed in a handful of frozen shrimp. Kept the heat to a minimum by skipping the tomatoes canned w/ peppers (toddler tastebuds in the house), but for all intents and purposes, followed the recipe, and ohhhhmygod, this will replace any and all Gumbo recipes that will cross my kitchen again.

This gumbo is wonderful! I changed it up slightly in order to use what I had in my kitchen, but I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible. I didn't have 3Qt. of broth, but I did have a 28 oz. box of chicken stock, a can of chicken broth, and a Knorr chicken bullion cube which I dissolved in 2 C hot water. I also didn't have all the peppers so I just diced a whole green pepper, and added that with the onions and celery. I also added about 5 oz of lump crab meat with the shrimp just 10 mins before I took the pot off of the stove and the shrimp weren't rubbery at all. I followed others reviews and really took my time with the roux. I think that makes a huge difference. I let mine get just a bit darker than peanut butter and it smelled nice and nutty. It took about 15 mins. over medium heat. I actually had to get another bottle of beer cause I drank half of the one I had planned to use in the gumbo. But it cooled me off while I was stirring the roux and gave me something to do while I was waiting. :) I also added about 2 dashes of cayenne pepper at the end since it didn't have much heat. My 3 year old son even ate a bowl! That's how I gauge my cooking. It was absolutely delicious!!! I will make this recipe for friends and family. Thanks for the great gumbo recipe!!!

This is an outstanding recipe! As others have stated, it's all about the roux. The darker the roux, the more intense the flavor. I get mine almost black, whisking CONSTANTLY to avoid burning. Be extra careful not to splash it as it could cause a serious burn (I've done this!). I also used andouille sausage, which I cooked in the oven with the chicken, and Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. Serve with Grandma's Buttermilk Cornbread, also on this site, for an exquisite Cajun meal. Yummy!

Knee slappin' good!!  I lost my gumbo recipe that I got when I lived in New Orleans... so I was worried I would never find one that was as good.  This recipe came very close and was wonderful.  I didn't use pork and added lots of chicken, shirmp and orka.  Yum

Awesome! I have never made gumbo, but this was easy and good.  I kept it on medium in the crockpot for a few hours and the flavor really intensified in just those few hours.  I may cut back on the cajun seasoning next time -- a bit too salty or maybe try a low sodium sausage.

This was great!  A word of caution, though:  check the ingredint list on your cajun seasoning before making this.  The first time we made it, we used cajun seasoning that was almost pure salt - it ruined our gumbo.  But the second time we used a better brand and it came out PERFECT!  I'm making it again tonight!

This was the first gumbo I've ever made or eaten, and I'm pleased to say, I liked it a lot!  While it was a bit labor intensive, it made a terrific Fat Tuesday dinner.  Couldn't find the chile peppers and used andouille (sp?) sausage, but it had plenty of kick.  Next time, I'll use more meat and less chicken broth if I cook rice separatly.  But with all the liquid I think it might work fine with the rice cooked right in with the gumbo.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I boiled the chicken so it would be easy to shred.  I used about 3 cups chicken, 1 1/2 lbs shrimp, and almost 1 lb of anduille sausage.  I only used 3 (14 oz) can chicken broth.  and 1 chopped red chili.   For spices I used 1/8 cup OlD Bay and 1/8 cup Tony's creole spices.

This is an excellent recipe, but I have these suggestions. 1) Reduce the chicken broth to 2.5 quarts. 2) Use 1 (14 oz) can of drained diced tomatoes plus 1 (28 oz) can of crushed tomatoes instead of the fresh roma tomatoes. 3) Use 1 lb of chicken, 1.5 lb of medium shrimp, & 1 pkg of Andouille sausage. 4) When you add the meat to the broth mixture, also add 1.5 cups of uncooked white rice.

Very enjoyable and a little different twist from most gumbo's. I did a couple of things differently. First, the roux seemed thin, so I added another 1/4 c of flour. I increased the chicken to 1 pound and boiled it lightly in water w/ cajun seasoning and a bay leaf so I could use the stock from that. I took it out before it was completely done, diced it, and then browned it with the sausage. I also used a full pound of sausage too. Otherwise I don't think it would have had enough meat in it. It was very creamy and had lots of flavor. I also added just a little file` to it. This is a very good recipe.

I don't think this tastes anything like traditional gumbo. It's more like gumbo soup (it's very thin). I personally didn't like it much (too spicy for my sensitive tastes) but I'm giving it four stars b/c my family LOVED it. I will make it again, but next time I'll decrease the amount of broth, leave out the chile peppers, and omit the beer. I thought the beer gave it a peculiar taste.

Superb recipe! I have made this several times and get rave reviews always.  Didn't have tomatoes with chilis so I just subbed regular diced tomatoes. Added some additional cayenne and cajun seasonings because I like it spicy.  Used Emeril's Kicked Up Smoked Sausage that I purchased at Sams Club. Very, very good recipe. I always use frozen veggies in order to reduce the prep time. Try this one.

Great flavor, very yummy. Next time I make it though, I will use less liquid and more chicken and shrimp. I had to use 2 pots to accomodate all the liquid. I had enough leftover to freeze for another night.

This recipe is awesome! I use Shiner Bock beer.
Chicken is thrown in a crock pot frozen, then shredded after 8 hours-it works perfectly. I use much less chicken broth with my gumbo though. My in-laws from the north love this. It's one of my wife's favorite meals now.

This came out really good but I tell you we didn't add the red chile nor cayenne pepper in our house made cajun seasoning and it was plenty spicy from the Rotel tomato and chili and I used the mild one.  We are not faint spice eaters either but any hotter wouldn't have made this enjoyable.  I added okra as well as others had recommended.  Will be making again definitely.

Being an Ohio native and never having gumbo in my life I thought I would try this. Never having gumbo I wouldn't know if I had it right or not. I followed this recipe to a tee and then took some to my brother in law who grew up in Louisiana (LSU Grad) and has eaten it his entire life. All he told me was I had better keep this recipe because it was one of the best gumbos he has ever tasted, followed up by a quick "sorry ma and grandma". I would suggest this one to anyone looking for a gumbo recipe. This has made me a true gumbo lover !!!

I made some adjustments to the recipe based on comments and I LOVED the end result!!  I used 3 cans (43.5 oz) chicken stock, used a package of 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (1 inch cubed), and replaced the shrimp with an extra 4 oz of sausage since my roommate and I don't care for shrimp, (I used 12 oz of andouille sausage, which you can get at most super markets). I have a "World Market" store near me and I used 2 5-inch fresh, red chili peppers.  Those gave this more than a kick, but not too much.  I like spice for flavor, but not for sport.  Maybe use 1 or 1.5 if you're not into your mouth tingling (but not burning) throughout the meal.

I'll be making this long into the future!!!

I was feeling lazy so I used precooked frozen Tyson cubed chicken to cut down some of the cooking time. I also omitted the red chile peppers to cut some of the heat for my kids. I increased the meat all around to keep the husband happy. Great flavor still a little spicy for my kids even though they were the one begging me to make it thanks to watching the princess and the frog. Served over rice with cornbread and a gallon of milk LOL. I will make this again!

Next time I'm going to decrease the liquid by half. Once you mix in the rice, it's nice & thick. But without the rice it's pretty soupy. Plus it would be nice if the proportion of liquid to ingredients was a little more balanced. I used andouille sausage & added crab. I think I will also look through some of the other reviews & see if anyone did thier own take on the roux. This one made for a very oily gumbo, albeit very delicious! Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Meh. This certainly wasn't "toe curlin" good, but it made for a decent meal nonetheless. While this tasted fine, the consistency was WAY off! Gumbo should be thick, not soupy! I considered cutting back the amount of liquid as many reviewers suggested, but after reading Lupe's comments, I didn't. Yes, if serving over rice, some of the liquid WILL be absorbed, but only SOME of it. Even after filling our bowls with a heaping mound of rice, it felt as if we were eating mildly spiced soup. If I make this again, I'll DEFINITELY cut the liquid back and add a LOT more spice. Having said this, I did make one substitution which likely led to my gumbo being mild. After searching TWO grocery stores (including a specialty one that usually carries a wide variety of produce), I ended up with a poblano chile that I ended up roasting as Lupe suggested in his review. I SHOULD HAVE gone with my gut and purchased a jalapeno instead (the poblano was VERY mild).... My final change was to add a couple small cans of lump crab meat to my gumbo (I was a tad short on shrimp), but I don't think it was worth the extra expense. NOTE: DO NOT cook your shrimp for 20 minutes!! Add them the last 5 minutes or so (this will keep your shrimp from overcooking). Served with cornbread, macaroni salad and the rest of the Shiner Bock beer that went into our gumbo. :) Maybe this will become your go-to recipe, but I'm gonna remain loyal to YoYo. Her gumbo is the best I've tried on here so far. Thanks anyways, Lupe! :-)

I have used this recipe several times, and been very satisfied with the results! I must confess that I have made a lot of alterations, but the recipe is very forgiving. I use more chopped vegetables than the recipe calls for, and substitute Andouille sausage (Amy's has a tasty chicken Andouille sausage that I like).  Shrimp may be omitted for those who don't like them. I found 1/4 cup Cajun seasoning WAY too salty, so start with about a tablespoon and add more to taste. I found that this recipe omits two super-important ingredients (in my opinion): okra (I use about 1-2 cups frozen) and gumbo file powder (ground sassafrass leaves).  Gumbo file gives it a special flavor that is very distinct, and also acts as a thickener, very traditional in a Creole gumbo. Overall, this is a delicious and reliable recipe that you can easily make your own.

Let me start by saying, this was my first time having  and making gumbo. I did not really know what to expect, so I just followed the recipe exactly. My advice; toss out the directions for the Roux and do some research if you are like me and have not made one before. From my understanding you need to heat the oil FIRST, then add the flour, stirring constantly until reaching the desired color. Another thing that is lacking is what shade of brown, a Roux can be anything from a light brown to almost black. 

I would also double the sausage, chicken and shrimp.

That said, it was actually tasty, though I am fairly certain that my roux was done wrong.

I eat the chicken and sausage gumbo soup from Campbell's and was so excited to make the real thing. I made it exactly as the recipes specified (minus the shrimp) and I did not care for itl. WAY WAY too much oil and too much creole seasoning. I ended up draining all the liquid from it and serving it over rice to kill some of the overpowering taste of it.

I read the reviews before I started this recipe & here are my thoughts: This is VERY tasty gumbo. This will be my standby recipe. I followed the recipe as written and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it needs more meat. I read several of the reviews that said it was too thin, but gumbo is supposed to be a soup, not a gravy or a topping. After the batch was done, I added oysters, crabmeat & doubled the shrimp. Much better! Next time I make it, I will also add okra. BTW: Making Roux isn't hard, but to make it correctly, it is time consuming.
 
If you are wondering how to serve gumbo or with what to serve it (I did), Here is what I found online:
The most traditional way to eat it is to pour the soup over a scoop of cooked white rice & top w/ File’ (Google it for details) Then serve with French bread or cornbread, potato salad and/or a fresh salad. Good luck!

This was very good.  I cooked my roux for almost an hour.  The results were beautiful.   Followed the recipe pretty closely resulting in a very flavorful, relatively mild gumbo.   Was perfect for the family, I added some tabasco to boost mine a but.

OMG, this is yum. Really not that hard to make, I did mine in the slowcooker and added the shrimp about 20 mins. before we ate. It starts off mild, and slowly you feel the heat of the chilis and spices! Im adding to my review, after reading another one......roux...read it!!! Butter...Oil...Lard......the outcome is the same, to bind! The one roux is not the same as the other, the darker the nuttier....tastes differ No matta hoe its all in the roux!

DELICIOUS! Didn't add beer b/c I didn't feel like going to the gas station to buy one can as we're not beer drinkers. Made a few small changes: 2 prts broth instead of 3, 4 celery stocks instead of 6, left ou tthe Roma tomatoes and used 2 cans Rotel instead, probably added a little more Cajun seasoning also. We like it spicy, and this definitely was! It makes A LOT too! Had enough for 4 people with everyone having seconds, leftovers to send home, leftovers for the two of us to eat the next day, and then some to freeze. Served over brown rice with a sweet yellow cornbread to compliment the spicy, great combination! Next time I think I'll use a shrimp stock though instead of chicken broth.

Wooo Weeee!!! This was amazing!!! I've never made gumbo before so I was a little nervous about the roux, but it came out so beautifully!  Per everyone else suggestions I cut back on the broth andy added only 6 cups of the chicken broth.  My fiance is a big baby when it comes to spice and he did think this was WAY too spicy.  Perfect for me though.  So next time I make it I will cut back on the red chili and cajun seasoning.  I served over brown rice. Mmm Mmmm Good!

This was absolutely wonderful!!!  I think it's imperative that you use a good quality beer if you're going to make this recipe.  I used Yuenglings Black & Tan beer.  I had NO problem w/ the taste.  I used an even split of Emerils Bayou Blast & Essence.  I also added in some sliced okra to the gumbo.  This was absolutely delicious, and I will be making it again and again.  I didn't see the point of waiting to re-add the chicken & sausage, so after the roux (the oil & butter) had been blended, I added the chicken & sausage back to the pot.  It was really great!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!

While this recipe was delicious, it was not the traditional gumbo I was hoping for. It came out more like a soup. Also, I doubled the amount of shrimp and sausage used and I am glad I did.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a dark stout and the flavor was amazing!  It was very spicy, but I personally love that.  It made a huge batch, so we ate off of it for a couple of days, but the flavor just kept getting better each day.

Thanks for a great recipe.  Living in west Texas, shrimp is too expensive here so just added more sausage and chicken.  I also added okra and a jalapeno.  Also, I wilted all my veggies before adding them to the roux mixture.  Very comforting food.

GREAT Gumbo!  I added a package of frozen seafood mix (shrimp, muscles, baby squid, etc) to the gumbo instead of just the shrimp.  I also used dark beer (Guiness).  Definitely a keeper!!

A flavor explosion in your mouth! I've never had the pleasure of tasting gumbo before; little did I know how delicious and gourmet it is. I made this recipe for my father and I...he loved it. He probably served himself 4-5 bowls. Now we did things a little differently, we omitted the shrimp, played with the portions a little, added okra and one red bell pepper. We ended up taking the pork sausage out of the casing though I wish  we'd left them in and just sliced the sausage (to hold flavor). I absolutely will make this again. This recipe is so versatile you can add or omit practically anything. The second time I made this gumbo, I omitted the red chiles. The flavor reallys comes from the beer and the seasonings! W-O-W!

My husband and I both agreed that this was one of the best things I'd ever made. Since it was just the two of us eating it, I halved the ingredients. Since I don't eat pork, I left it out and just increased the chicken. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used 1.5 (14.5 oz) cans of petite diced tomatoes and still did the full 10 oz. can of tomatoes with chiles. Since the store did not have any fresh red chiles, I added 2 tbsp of chili powder to the mix. I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun, and even though I know that's a crime in certain circles, it was really tasty. For the beer, I used Guinness, and I think that really made a difference. Go for the quality! I reduced the broth to 5 cups (used 4 cups chicken, 1 veggie), and when I added the chicken and shrimp, I added a cup of white rice. Delicious then, and delicious the next day for lunch. MAKE THIS AND LOVE IT.

It was my first time ever trying to cook a gumbo - my mom was so impressed I was taking it on!  :)  But it was easy.  I did have a minor meltdown when I threw the shrimp in and then decided that since all the other meat wasn't raw, the shrimp probably shouldn't have been raw either.  Then I thought about all the seafood I've cooked before and knew that the shrimp WAS supposed to be raw, and everything turned out beautifully in the end.  I did follow fellow reviewers' advice and bump up the meat while cutting back on the liquid.  I didn't include the beer at all bc the kids would have been upset if they thought they were eating alcohol (they're young and quite sweet like that).  But especially with andouille sausage, this gumbo can get quite spicy.  It was a great first gumbo!  (And will be a great second since I made enough to freeze!)

I wish I could add more stars!  We did change it up a bit, due to dietary preferences in my family... left out onion and celery and used celery seeds, used sweet italian turkey sausage instead of regular pork, and added jumbo shrimp.  It does have a lot of liquid, so we served it with cornbread to soak it all up!  I will probably leave out the chicken next time and double the rest of the meat.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

This gumbo has become a tailgate staple in the cold weather.  Can be prepared a day before adding to the flavor and reheat at game time.  Used low sodium chicken stock and have always used kielbasa for the sausage.  Have also added extra shrimp and kicked up the seasoning a notch.
Served over rice or just by itself.  The preparation time is worth-I agree-keep a bandaid handy/and/or a helper.

Incredible!  I can't believe I made Gumbo and it tasted this good.  I didn't have Cajun spices, so I used Old Bay and added a tsp of Cayenne pepper - I also double the chicken and I replaced the celery with zuchinni - it was wonderful!!

This tasted really good but had too much liquid...I will definately cut back next time. And as other people suggested, use more chicken and/or shrimp.

The first thing everyone should understand that true gumbo NEVER EVER has any type of tomatoes as an ingredient. Don't do it, don't even think about doing it.

I've made this a handful of times and I've found that making a darker roux really improves the flavor. I start the roux over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. After 5 minutes, reduce to medium heat and stir constantly until a milk chocolate color is achieved. Once the roux is the color of milk chocolate, add the celery, onions, and garlic directly to the roux and cook until transparent. The roux will splatter and become much darker when the vegetables are added, but this is normal. Once the veggies are transparent, add all other ingredients except the meat and proceed per the original instructions.

My family thought this was great.  To be honest, this was a lot of work! I pre-chopped  veggies and it was still a lot of work and took over 2 hours from start to finish.  Over.  Anyway, it was delicious!  I'd never made Gumbo before and seriously, the family loved it.  I did make a few changes based on other reviews as follows - I used 6 cups of broth which was about 1 1/2 qts...then I used a Guinness for my beer - yum - I used a jalepeno instead of the red chile because that's what I had...as well...and no one ever mentions this but...I used a gluten-free baking "flour", 1/2 cup only (King Arthur is best!) and a 1/2 cup butter for the roux and it turned out just fine - and added an orange bell pepper.  I used Andouille sausage as well and about a pound of shredded chicken thighs not breasts.  I added the shrimp at the end and let it cook inside the Gumbo.  Great flavor all around.  And since I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun but still wanted more heat, I added a few shakes of both hot and sweet paprika, onion powder and cayenne.  Seriously, the family loved it.  OH, and I did use the 4 fresh Romas...if you do that, it's plenty of tomato.  This was DELISH!

First made this gumbo about 3 years ago and have used this recipe since! I add way more chicken and andouille sausage than what the recipe calls for because I do not add shrimp. For the beer I use Killian's Irish Red. My Louisiana born spouse told me that this is better than her grandma's! We haven't told her that! ;)

Yesssss.. This stuff is awesome! I made it with just chicken and sausage (beer brat) to appease a non-seafood lover. Was still very, very good. Used Tony Chachere's Bold Creole Seasoning, which made it super spicy in a good way.  Also used Tecate for the beer, and it worked. Could see this being really good with okra and crab meat. Next time! Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious! I normally am not a fan of gumbo because it can be really salty or the flavors just aren't right... But this was amazing. I decide to make this to surprise my bf because he loves Cajun/Creole food and I think I aced it!

I did tweak this recipe a little bit, as suggested by others I add the shrimp at the end and reduce the amount of liquids. It was my first time making a roux and with much research I did it perfectly… although it does seem thin, one it's added to rice it's perfect (+ a little file, too)! I swapped the canned chile peppers for green bell peppers and diced a de-seed jalapeño, and roma tomatoes for canned diced tomatoes. Also add andouille sausages :)

I've made this many times and everytime it gets better! A good thing to remember, the darker your roux the better it will taste. It should look like a dark peanut butter color. I always add crab meat to mine which makes it to die for. I also add a bay leaf for extra flavor also. When you go to the store look for Webers N'Orleans Cajun Seasoning, trust me it will make your Gumbo DELICIOUS.

Wow, so good! I've never had gumbo before and I'm a believer. I wasn't sure what was meant by "red chile peppers" so I used a single (green) Serrano pepper in my half-recipe and it was a bit TOO spicy! Next time I'll leave out some of the seeds.

WOW this is a fantastic recipe!!  The only modifications we made were to add a can of tomato paste and some cooked rice at the very end.  The flavor is amazing!!  My husband asked for double the amount of sausage and chicken next time - but I think it's great as-is.  We will definitely make this again - and have it in our rotation of favorite recipes.  Thank you for sharing!!

Delicious. But. I made a few adjustments of my own like others reviewers suggested, and some of my own. I didn't add a sweet onion, just a regular yellow onion. Used 6 cups of broth and it was MORE than enough, and used low sodium. Skipped the red peppers, roasted two jalapenos and threw them in whole to the pot. Simmered the whole pot for 4-5 hours. Added about 1.5 pounds of a rotisserie chicken, .5 pounds of sausage(I found the sausage pointless) and 2 pounds of shrimp. Only added about a 1/4 cup parsley. The key is in the roux. I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup flour, DELICIOUS. I also think letting it simmer all day(minus the shrimp) made a huge difference. Mine was quite spicy just the way I like it. Added in the shrimp with about an hour left, let them simmer with everything else, and they came out perfectly cooked. Will definitely make this again. Although this does make A LOT!!!

Took others suggestion and cut back the chicken broth to 2 qts, although it was plenty thin even then. Think next time I'll make more roux to thicken it more. I left out the red chile peppers because it was hot enough without it. I love gumbo but the heat does get to me. It's very good though! The local restaurant wants $8 for a bowl. I made the entire soup for what it cost for 2 bowls!

amazing.  but take time with the roux.  and make sure not to stir with a plastic spoon or spatula... because you'll be stirring for a while and parts of the plastic may melt off into the roux.  (not that that happened to us and we had to start over or anything...)

Really good.  I only used 2 quarts of chicken stock (my pot was too small), and kept all the other ingredient amounts the same, and it turned out great.  I will make this again for sure.

Holy Smokes! This was fantastic!

My boyfriend refuses to eat sausage, but even he nom'd this stuff down. A word to the wise, though -- if you choose to add your own spices (like I did, and like many do), watch it with the cayenne. I may have OD'd on it. While it did not render this fabulous gumbo inedible, it definitely packed a wallop.

This is SO GOOD. I changed it to a pescetarian version, so I used tofurky sun-dried tomato sausages in place of the pork sausage, and I used salted vegetarian bullion in place of the chicken broth. I also used habanero powder in place of the chile peppers, and used half of the cajun seasoning that the recipe calls for. I also obviously didn't use chicken. Oh, and I used dos equis as my beer. The result was a DELICIOUS spicy, very well-rounded gumbo. It was a bit on the soupy side, which I like, but if you want a thicker soup I would maybe use 2 quarts of broth instead of 3. Can't recommend this recipe more!

Followed the recipe exactly and found what others said.  Too soupy and had to add more meat. Gumbo was just ok.  Lots of work and not sure if the outcome was worth it.

Oh my goodness..this was fantastic! My boys ate 2 bowls each!! This is a recipe which will be made again and again in my house. The only difference is next time, I will double the meats (chicken breast and andouille sausage). I did cut the chicken broth down to 2 qts and 1 beer so mine was a bit thicker. Also, like another one of the reviewers, I will bump it up with yellow, red and orange peppers, plus frozen okra.

This was very good!  I did think it was a little liquidy for my taste (a liquid stewp consistency)...for total amt of liquid (beer+broth) I would decr amt of broth by 1 1/2-2c, keep 2 beers (amber is best) as part of total. Add Tony C. seasoning during roux making part.  Can put liquids in crock on low all day THEN add meats + I added Okra (1-2 cups), can of lump crabmeat at end too. BTW- tradit. served over a lump of rice .

Yummy! I increased the meat and decreased the chicken broth for a heartier gumbo. I have 2 kids, so I used only the tomatoes with green chiles and omitted the red ones, and it was plenty spicy still. I spent all afternoon cooking, but it was worth it!

Excellent gumbo recipe. I made this weeks ago but didn't have any cajun seasoning or red pepper, but the 1/4 cajun seasoning and the pepper really spices this up and makes it delicious instead of just good. I made the roux a dark brown and let the cajun seasoning heat up with the roux. I also used half a cup of olive oil and added some butter to make the roux. I know, it's annoying when people make changes in the recipe, but this recipe is good just as it is or gives you some wiggle room to change things up a bit and make it your own.

Absolutely delicious. I'd serve it to anyone as an impressive, and flavorful dish. 
I used the canned tomatoes with habanero peppers, so I forwent the fresh red chilies. I added brown rice (per rice box serving instructions), substituted turkey sausage, and used one Shock Top beer. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it...THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT!

This recipe had WONDERFUL flavor!  I wish I had seen the other reviews about adding more meat or not adding so much liquid.  I had too much liquid at the end but I can add some noodles to it for a flavorful noodle soup.

Great recipe, though I made some changes.  Substitutions:  I used both chicken breast and chicken thighs.  The pork sausage I used was Andouille.  I added 1 pound of okra.  Cooking: Instead of waiting to add the meat (for the last 20 min), I added it in with the vegetables.  Though, I added shrimp at the end and cooked until they were nice and pink.  Loved, loved, loved this recipe -- even my picky spicy avoiding kids enjoyed it!

This was really good and my guests loved it. I ended up doing only 2 quarts of chicken broth, used doubled the meat amts and used Sam Adams Boston Lager. Served over Jasmine rice. Nice amount of heat but not overpowering. Will make again!

I've never made gumbo before, but have had it before and knew what I was looking for. This had okay flavor, but was in my and my boyfriends humble opinion, was lacking in chunky vegetables/proteins and reminded me too much of chili. We ended up adding in 2lbs of shrimp and 8 sliced andouille sausages to make it a bit heartier and served 6 people with plenty of leftovers. Next time I will try another, though..

DELICIOUS!  To make it even tastier, add the vegetables in right after you finish the roux.  Also, add 2 cups of chicken instead of just 1, and 1 pound of sausage links instead of 1/2 pound.  Otherwise, cut down the broth to about 2 quarts instead of 3.  Very yummy!

My husband hates okra, so I was thrilled to find a gumbo recipe without it.  I made it exactly as stated and it was fantastic- husband and toddler loved it, and there's enough to freeze for several meals.  Only problem I ran into was when I threw the garlic in, the roux was so hot that it burnt the garlic a bit and added a bitter undertone.  Will add garlic after the broth next time, but otherwise it was great!

This is delicious! The only changes we made were omitting the celery (just because we don't like it) and we added the shrimp while the gumbo was cooling for about 15 minutes so as not to overcook it, as another reviewer suggested. Be careful not to burn the roux! We served it with jasmine rice, which was a perfect compliment. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really yummy.  I was terrified of the 1 cup of olive oil but followed the recipe as directed (mostly).  It turned out great!  Mine could have been spicier but it was more versitile to just serve with hot sauce on the side.  Next time I'm going to cook the veggies a bit first so that they are a little softer.

Very tasty indeed.  Used creole seasoning instead of Cajun and added crabmeat but the crab didn't add anything to the flavor except to maybe thicken it a bit.  As for the roux, I heated the oil then added a little oil to flour till all flour in bowl was moist.    Added roux back to pot with garlic.  Meanwhile in  large pot where chicken/sausage was cooked added beer & broth to loosen juices on bottom of pot, then added roux.  I also lessened amount of red pepper to a little over 1tbl.  Will make this again for sure!

This was my first time making gumbo and it was delicious! Next time, I may cut down just a bit on the cajun seasoning as it was too spicy for my boyfriend...but I thought it was absolutely perfect!  This recipe makes ALOT of gumbo- but it freezes well!

GREAT!  Despite some suggestions to use less water, I did not.  However, when added with a little rice (slightly undercooked), the consistency was perfect!  I didn't realize it would yield so much though.  My gf and I have been eating this for a week, and I am going to still have to freeze half.

Hubby loved it-too spicy for me though. Used 3 cans chicken broth, green pepper instead of chili pepper, and used just shy of 1/4 cup Cajun seasoning. Used a splash of Tabasco and a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  Will not use cayenne and Tabasco next time.  Used more chicken and more sausage than called for, but need to Double shrimp.   Was very good overall if u like it hot.

Made this two days ago. Hubby and sons (even the one who doesn't like spicy stuff) loved it. Did make more broth than necessary. But no worries. We'll freeze what we don't use. Interesting how the parsley adds a bit of the okra flavor/feel w/o the slime. Thanks for sharing.

I thought the flavor of this Gumbo was very good! However, there way too much broth in it. If I make it again, I would probably use half the amount of broth. For leftovers, I ended up draining it into a colander and catching the juice in a bowl. I got the good stuff out of the colander then just added some of the juice back.

This was FANTASTIC!  It was my first attempt at making gumbo and it turned out wonderful!  You can find recipes for the cajun spice mix on this site.  I made this to take to a couple that just had a baby and served it with rice and sweet corn cakes.  They RAVED over it!  Will definitely make again.

Very good. We will probably use a little less oil next time. We may have not measured accurately enough, but it seemed a little too oily.

Made this for my born and raised cajun husband and he loved it. I made a few changes like adding more file and using andouille sausage instead of regular pork sausage. I also added some shrimp close to the end of the boil. It was great served separately over rice.

This was...OK for me. It is a good, basic gumbo recipe but for me I made alot of modifications. I've never put tomatoes in my gumbo and I didn't like it with them. Made it taste too much like a stew instead of a gumbo. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs and I used way more than 1 cup. I also added king crab legs and crab meat. In addition I used chicken STOCK instead of broth. I did find a lower sodium Cajun seasoning which worked well. I added more cayenne and hot sauce for heat. I cooked my roux to a peanut butter color and then I added the celery, onion and peppers to that and cooked it a bit darker. I used Red Stripe for the beer  but I don't think it matters which beer you use. I added the seafood at the very end of cooking time. PLUS, if you aren't using okra you MUST use file` powder. Add this to individual servings, as gumbo should never be cooked once file` has been added. I simply put it on the table and let folks add it themselves. Overall OK, but I wouldn't use this recipe again.

I have not found anything yet to compare with this recipe!! Even better the next day. All the flavors melt together so well. Unless someone makes a better gumbo and offers it to try I will never use another recipe. Which I will find very hard to surpass this one.

All I can say is my husband LOVED this. He probably ate it 4 days in a row and that is saying alot for him.   The only thing I would do differently is just use 2 huge big containers of broth (not sure the size of the boxes) and i add crab -- i use alot of meat. I also pre-cooked the chicken and sausage and added it all in the pot with 10 minutes left in cooking time. The shrimp will be perfect then! I've also made this with crawfish instead of shrimp and it's just as good too. My husband has me making this almost every two weeks right now as a late night snack. This is by far one of the best recipes out there. For the roux, it typically takes around 20 minutes. You want it to be the color or a little darker than peanut butter but make sure you don't burn it. If you burn it, start over otherwise you will ruin all the other hard work.

Made this last night and it was a big hit.  I only made a couple slight changes: I used extra chicken and andouille sausage but no shrimp.  Also I used two serrano chiles instead of the red and the spice/heat was perfect, but then again I like really spicy food.  I also added a touch of file powder. I cooked the roux for about 25 minutes to get a rich color(used peanut instead of olive oil because that's how I was taught)  Overall the flavor was perfect!

I made this for a Gumbo cookoff, and beat out 4 other cooks for first place with this recipe!    A few minor changes: I doubled the sausage; decreased the chicken broth to a little over 2 quarts; also boiled the shrimp shells in some of the chicken broth to add a little more of that flavor.  Used one red jalapeno, one red holland chili (WOW HOT!), one serrano, and one big fat anaheim chili.  I used Penzey's Cajun spice mix.    This was quite hot, but absolutely delicious!!

DO NOT ruin your gumbo by using 1/4 CUP of cajun seasoning (ie Tony Chachere's) it's all salt.  I even used half of the salt free blend and I'm trying to salvage it now.  1/4 Cup is a LOT of seasoning...start low and taste.  Oh, and I like salt, that's the funniest part.

I just finished using this recipe and it was wonderful. I did adjust the recipe for what I had on hand and I 1/2 the recipe and still have plenty after 5 servings of it. The only things that were changed was I added ground beef, used Portuguese sausage instead of pork links, I didn't use the celery, and added some extra cayenne pepper. It was a huge hit.

Out of this world, fantastic Gumbo from a New Orleans girl!  I also cut down on the olive oil/flour to 3/4 cup.  The roux takes about 35 minutes to get that nice golden brown color.  I simmered the veggies longer than 40 minutes...really takes longer for the flavors to blend.  Refrigerate overnight before serving for the flavor to really develop.  Left out the red peppers, would have been too spicy with it.  Also did about 6 cups of chicken broth and 8 oz Guiness beer.  Time consuming to make, but worth it!

Ok folks, ya gotta pretty near perfect recipe here, don't get scared.  Gumbo is like pasta salad, it's what you want to make of it.  This recipe is one of the best you can find, but like any recipe you can tweek it.  Now is not the time to find out if ya like shrimp or not.  Or if cooked Okra is the thing for you.  I made up a triple batch of this recipe for a Jimmy Buffett tailgate party and it came out great.  But ya gotta have an evening set aside to do it.  First off I used chicken thighs.  I washed them down and deboned and skinned them.  Keep all the bones and skins, that becomes your real chicken stock.  I'm gonna tell ya how I made it.  So if you can't think on your feet you need to read this a few times and figure out your own method, meathead.  After I deboned the thighs I put some olive oil in a deep pot and got it hot.  Then I tossed in about a cup each of celery, onion, and a 1/4 cup of parsely.  Added some kosher salt and pepper (don't ask me where ya buy kosher pepper)and some Cajun spice mix that is more spice than salt.  After the stuff sweats a bit I tossed in the skin, bones and other tidbits from the chicken and browned it well.  Once all this had cooked up until browned I added enough water to make the amount of broth called for.  In my case it was 36 cups of water.  Scale it to your own level, ok?    Now while this mess bubbles away get busy cuttin' the other green up and boil up some shrimp.  Use a good shrimp boil mix that comes in a bag that you can d

I just finished making this and all I have to say is WOW!  It is soooo good!  I also decreased the chicken broth to 46 oz.  I did not add shrimp.  Instead I put in 2lb chicken and 1lb sausage.  I think it could have used another lb of chicken.  Even still, it is the best gumbo I have ever eaten.

Oh my goodness, this gumbo is delicious!  I made this for my husband for his birthday, along with shrimp creole, and it was just perfect.  I recommend making it a day ahead, as it was even better the 2nd day.  This one's a keeper for sure!

I generally don't like to rate the recipes that I have used from this site, I have had some good ones and than some not so good ones,however, this was bad! I was Very disappointed in this recipe.  I made it for Christmas Eve and all anyone could taste was the beer. It comepletely took over the taste of the gumbo, it had a kick to it but that and the beer was all you could taste.  I doubled the recipe so I doubled the beer.  I had to toss out more than 3/4 of the gumbo.this was kinda costly).  I don't understand how others have rated this recipe so high, I have been cooking for over 50 years so I kinda know my way around a kitchen and this recipe was pretty bad.  I almost did not add the beer. I might try it again without the beer and than review it again. Sorry but this one is a no go for me.

Delicious! I added okra and red bell pepper. Only used 2 quarts of chicken broth. I used Tony Chacheres. Super spicey but that's how my husband and I like it! Topped it with gumbo filet and parsley and served over white rice. Five stars for sure!

The flavor was excellent. It had a good amount of spice without any burning sensation.  I only put 1 quart of chicken broth in, as I didn't  have enough room for more.  I used all home grown tomatoes, 2 red hot chili peppers, and 2 green peppers.

I am generally pretty versatile while I cook, so I had to give this a shot. My partner is from Louisiana and loves gumbo. I saw this and thought "she'll most definitely love it." It was a hit with her. One bite of it, and she instantly fell in love. The flavors all balance each other out and are most definitely a taste of the south. Most excellent!!!

I'm from New Orleans and now live in Atlanta GA. This gumbo reminds me of home. I did take the advice of some others and used 3/4 cup each flour and olive oil. When I made it previously as the recipe was written with 1 cup each flour/olive oil, it was way to greasy and I had to skim the excess oil, but not this time. so 4 stars due to the excess greasiness.

I'm on the SB diet, phase 2 and made half the recipe for our family of 3.  I used one 9 oz chicken breast, which I boiled and cut up, and fried some turkey sausage in 1/2 the amount of oil (OM brand).  Used the E cajun seasoning, R toms & peppers and bell pepper instead of chili.
Being from Savannah... threw the shrimp in the last 5 minutes as they get too GUMMY cooking for 20 minutes, ew.  Also threw in the chicken during the 40 cooking stage after adding vegs to roux.
After those 40 mins, added sausage... OH..also, to make the roux, I used whole wheat flour and cooked it for about 10 minutes (oil & flour), stirring constantly.  Nice aroma.  With the garlic, it smelled heavenly (I actually let the garlic brown in the roux process).  Great recipe!  Thanks for posting!

I married into a cajun family and they say this is the best gumbo they've ever had.  I don't add the okra ( a sin in some states, I know!) but it is a wonderful recipe that is better the next day.  Thanks so much!!!

VERY, VERY GOOD! I wanted spice and got it! This is the best recipe for gumbo that I have ever tried. I add a few pods of okra, what's gumbo without some okra? I made this on a warm summer day and it still hit the spot. Can't wait to try it in 20 degree weather!

A tasty dish!  I browned chicken thighs in olive oil, then added the sausage.  I drained the meat on paper towels, and deboned the chicken. I made the roux in the same pan, incorporating the drippings. After adding 2 1/2 quarts of stock and one Yuengling Lager, I added the veggies (including okra), chicken and sausage back to the pot to simmer.  About five minutes before serving, threw in the crab meat and shrimp, which was all it took to cook the shrimp perfectly. I probably won't wait until next Fat Tuesday to make this one again!

SPICY AND DELISCIOUS! I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe as did my other three dinner guests. My only "complaint" is that it is more watery than I like my gumbo to be, so I will probably use 2 quarts instead of three, but the recipe was excellent.

Knock my socks off good!  I wasn't sure how long to cook the roux.  The recipe said until brown & bubbly.  It never really turned brown, but I cooked for a long time...no worries though it turned out perfect!  I did cut down on the chicken stock though, per some other reviews.  Loved it!

Loved this!  It was just spicy enough!  You must add the shrimp uncooked so it soaks up the cajun flavoring.  This is a wonderful gumbo served over rice with some cornbread!!!

I've made this several times now. It is so great!! I use Stella Artois for my beer (1 for me, 1 for the gumbo).  I also use 2 qts Chicken Stock (stock is different than broth so buy a stock if you can).  I shred 1 store bought Cajun rotiesserie chicken and also brown sliced Beef Sausage.  Did not use shrimp.  Instead of the roma tomatoes & chilies, I just add another can of MILD rotel tomatoes.  Use Tony Chachere's Original Seasoning. 
I personally do not think this is spicy, so I serve w/ Garlic Tabasco. Oh yeah, and rice. Yum!!

I made this recipe for a group of about 10 people for a football game and everyone loved it!! I served it with rice and cornbread muffins. I also like some others who have tried this recipe used less chicken stock and I tried Emeril's kicked up sausage insted.

This gumbo was awesome!  I added some green pepper, extra spicy Cajun seasoning and some file to the individual servings.  I made a chicken the night before and used the broth and meat from that.  The heat was just right and my 13 month old gobbled it up. I will for sure make this again and again...great recipe!!!!

I used 2 lbs boneless chicken thighs, 1 lb kielbasa type sausage and 1 lb of pork sausage links that were tomato garlic flavored.  I did not like the texture of the latter sausages in my gumbo.  I also added 2 lbs frozen okra.  Flavor on first night tasted too much like the beer I added.  I'm not a fan of beer.  However, the next day, after the flavors melded.  Holy cow!  This was awesome!  Today my dh took for lunch and he was full of compliments about the flavor.  I will make again.  Next time with the meat as indicated.

Really great tasting-my family loved it but too spicey for the kids. I made it as it said and it does seem to have too much liquid. Next time I will cut broth in half and add rice to mixture at end to make it more to my liking.

When I prepared the ingredients for this soup, I was kinda skeptical.  Especially, using chicken breast,  it can be bland and rubbery.  However, once it started simmering, my skepticism quickly disappered.  
I bought the spicy andouille sausage because I was afraid to try turkey sausage.  The soup was so good, my family ate it within an hour.  All of the ingredients meld together to make a perfect soup.

Very good! I didn't use chicken and used less broth. My husband loved it as did I. I used smoked Andouille sausage which made it hot and spicy! Didn't have Roma tom. but I don't think it mattered. Can't wait for shrimp to go on sale so we can dine Cajun style again! Oh, great eaten with anadama bread.

This was an excellent recipe.  Made it for Superbowl.....and it was a huge hit.  We did add Minute Rice the last 5 minutes of cooking ( maybe about 2 1/2 cups) to absorb some of the extra liquid.  It tasted even better today!  We suggest giving it a try!

This dish is good & makes a lot!  I froze what my husband and I could not eat after the first week.  I did not use the amount of Cajun seasoning the recipe calls for.  I used about 1 tablespoon and it was plenty spicy. I used Morning Star Farms soy sausage links instead of real sausage and could not tell the difference!

Don't be put off by the list of ingredients, it doesn't take that long to put together and it is SO worth it.  My store was out of red chile peppers so I used jalepeno instead and it turned out great, maybe a 1 1/2 star spicy--perfect for my family.  I used Emeril's cajun andoille sausage and that was my favorite part!  I'm from Seattle and we don't have a lot of Gumbo up here so I didn't really know what to expect but everybody LOVED it.  This is definately going in my recipe box to make again.

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just thick enough for me.  One thing to note; at first I only used the Zatarain Cajun seasoning that comes in the little glass jar and it was very bland.  I tried adding salt but that didn't fix it.  So then I added Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and it made all the difference.  I got it when in New Orleans and forgot I had it.  This is time consuming but worth it.  Also, next time I will add 1/2 lb more each of the shrimp and chicken.

My family loved it!  However, I did make the following modifications:  Used 2 large cans of chicken broth (49oz), 2 cups shredded chicken breasts (boiled then sauteed with olive oil and sausage), and 1/4 cup of Worsteshire sauce.  The sauce turned out perfect...not too thick or too thin) and it tasted great!  Thank you for this recipe. It is definitely a keeper!

1/9/04 Just made this today, and boy is it good!
Followed other members advice and cut down on the chicken broth. Doubled the meats too.  Only used a half can of beer, and threw in a little red wine. Couldn't find red chiles , so I used 2 jalapeno peppers, it's spicey but not too much. Serve with some white rice, and or crusty bread, YUM YUM. Thanks for the recipe.

This was an AWESOME recipe!!!!! My entire family loved it!  I made minimal changes to the recipe, only substitutions for things I didn't have on hand--like I didn't have any celery on hand, so I tossed in some celery salt, I didn't have any beer, so I used white wine-- you get the idea. Anyway changes were out of necessity.  I did decrease the liquid it called for based on other reviews, but I think this would come down to personal preference. Again, an absolutely wonderful recipe!!!!!!!!!

I was fooled by all the positive reviews! First of all, there was way too much liquid! It was just a watery mess with an occasional morsel floating around. Secondly, beware the kind of cajun seasoning you use! There is such a huge quantity that it’s  all you taste! Unfortunately I used tony sacheres which is just a salt bomb. Good on baked fish, etc, but 1/4 cup is waaaay to much. Choose one that’s lighter on the salt and maybe it would be bearable? If you cut down the liquid significantly.

Have made this many times and it's always a hit!!!  I use Andoille sausage or Kikebasa instead of regular pork sausage and ad frozen okra right at the end. The secret is the roux!!!!  I add the peppers and onions with the chicken and sausage and keep some of them in the pot while making the roux. Serve with rice!!!

I have never been a huge gumbo fan but I was in the mood for something new and I decided on this recipe, and man am I happy I did! It's amazing.  I keep the juice and freeze it so I can make it 3 or more times. Just defrost and add new chicken, shrimp and sausage.  Absolutely perfect !!!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I cut the chicken broth to 80 oz and added 16 oz of water.  I used Zataran's creole seasoning- 3 tablespoons, and file powder, didn't measure, just added until it tasted right.  I used three whole jalapenos chopped fine, and I sauteed the vegetables in a little olive oil/butter and then added to the broth mixture.  For my roux, I used 1/2 cup olive oil and 1 stick of real butter, I think butter adds a depth to the flavor, but that is just a personal preference.  Served with rice and cornbread.  This is a keeper.  Next time I will add okra, I would have this time, but I didn't have any fresh or frozen.  It is kind of spicy, but we like it warm.

I never had gumbo before (maybe something from a can once upon a time) let alone made it.  I thought it was great. I added okra to mine for the heck of it. It worked out well I think. The only thing I will do differently is add more seafood.

I love this recipe. I've made it twice and I'm going to make it again this weekend. I do add a chopped green bell pepper and a few little chunks of okra. It is wonderful. Patience is the key to this dish. Get that roux nice and brown. It just adds more richness to the wonderful broth. Can't wait for tomorrow so I can make it and eat it. My husband is a huge fan of this dish.

Made this for a potluck at work. Got a TON of compliments! The spice level was specifically mentioned as being perfect. Right amount of spiciness with a kick. Definitely will be making this again. 

Some changes I made:
Whole wheat unbleached flour (3/4 cup),
Smoked cajun rub (1/4 cup).
Recipe didn't specified type of beer, but I used a German Lager (I think I might try an IPA to see if the taste changes next time).

Some changes I plan on making next time:
Reduce the amount of oil by roughly 1/4 to 1/2. The residue from the oil was pretty heavy, and left a thick layer on top (i.e. mixing it around and then dipping a spoon in it, there was a coat of oil around the entire spoon).

Yum yum yum! I used 3 cups of chicken broth, canned tomatoes, and didn't have chicken or shrimp so I added kielbasa. I should of sautéed the celery before adding.

We LOVED this!!! This was my first ever attempt to make gumbo... it tasted exactly like I wanted it to!!  Beautiful recipe.
I didn't have a red chili, so I used a fresh jalepeno. It was fine.  I used a couple of spoonfuls of bacon grease in my roux - FANTASTIC!
I didn't add the shrimp until the whole pot of gumbo was done.. then I dumped them in long enough to cook through then served it all over brown rice.  HOKEY FRIGHT I am now of the belief that I CAN COOK EXCELLENT GUMBO! lol  Thank you Lupe!!

So another commenter was right--it IS all about the roux.  I used 1/2 cup of butter (instead of oil) and 1/2 cup of flour on almost medium heat for about 10 minutes total to get the darker brown peanut butter color.  Also used Shiner Bock bear, 2.5 quarts of chicken broth, 2 chicken breasts, 3 chicken sausages, and 2 cups each of celery, onion, and carrot, as well as added in some zucchini.  To make it a more balanced meal, it needed the extra vegetables.  Be careful with adding the cajun/creole seasoning.  Start with less than 1/4 cup and add to your taste.  It would have been way too salty and spicy if I had added the full 1/2 cup.  The smell is phenomenal, and it tastes just as good!

If I could give 10 stars here, I would.  This recipe is AMAZING!  I have served it multiple times and everyone tells me that it is the best thing they have ever eaten.  I do go easy on the spice though...half McCormick & half Tony's.

I am prefacing this by saying I've never had gumbo before so this was my first time. It may have be that I just don't really care for gumbo...I thought the flavor was just ok. I definitely had to add tabasco sauce. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a giant pot of gumbo. Neither myself nor by husband really thought much of the dish so I'm not sure what to do with the leftovers that I've frozen.

It's a delicious dinner (and even better left-overs).  It freezes well, which makes up for the length to make it, and it has just the right level of heat.  I don't know how the original is 10 servings, I ended up with 13 cups after probably taking 2-3 for dinner.

2 things I have to say, though.  The total time, especially if you want a darker roux, is not 2 hours.  I did a medium brown roux, and I ended up taking 3 hours on this.

Also, I let it sit for 15 minutes after cooking, to let it thicken up.  That's when I threw in the shrimp.  They ended up perfectly cooked, rather than the rubbery comments that other people have given.

We LOVED this recipe! I made very minor tweaks - I cooked a small chicken and used the broth/chicken for the base. I also used Hillshire Farms turkey kielbasa instead of sausage links, and did not add shrimp because of shellfish allergies. Everything else was the same and it was outstanding.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!! I did a little revision to it, but other than that it came out fantastic! Instead of roma tomatoes used two cans of diced tomatoes, a can of crushed tomatoes. I also used the majority of a 48 oz box of chicken broth instead of 3 quarts. I cooked some okra separately and added it in when I added the chicken and sausage. Shrimp was put in the last 10 mins, so it wouldn't be rubbery. It turned out so good and we had plenty of leftovers!

This was my first time making gumbo and this turned out GREAT! I did change it a bit to halve the cajun seasoning (it was still plenty spicy), and omit the roma tomatoes. I used about 5 C. of chicken broth as others suggested. Next time I would use very low fat/low sodium broth to cut the salt. I also decided to add some diced red, orange and yellow peppers to give it more color - and sauteed the whole veggie mix separately to soften the sweet onion and peppers together before adding it to the roux. I used a dark beer and I think it added a particular flavor and nuttiness to the gumbo unlike any I've had elsewhere. The previous comment about working with the roux for as much as 30 minutes on medium/low (until it is a sort of peanut butter consistency and color) was a great tip - made all the difference - but you do have to stir the roux constantly. This definitely makes enough to feed 6 or even 8 people. Truly a recipe I will make again for a large crowd!

This is, by far, the best gumbo recipe on the planets!!  This is awesome fresh out of the pot, leftovers the next day, or even freezes well.  I always make a huge pot so I can freeze some for those days I am too busy to cook.  My family loves this, including the kids (I do omit the extra chili peppers but def leave the spicy Ro-Tel and a big palmful of Tony's), and I always get great compliments from anyone lucky enough to stop by when I am making it.  As most of us do, I tweaked this a little to meet my family's likes, as well as including some okra from our garden (grown specifically for gumbo!)  I've also used anything I have on hand including andouille sausage or even smoked sausage from Hillshire farm for great flavor.  I also toss the chicken with flour to be sure the "juice" is more "gravy-ish" when I make a giant pot.  We use med to large fresh or flash-frozen shrimp at the very end.  The small to med-small shrimp get lost in a big pot o' gumbo, plus will get rubbery too quick.  We've also tried Zatarain's, Louisiana Brand, and Tony Chachere's  creole seasoning and I think the Tony's wins - hands down!  
Thanks so much for the best Gumbo recipe on the planet!!!!!!!!!!!

Cut back on the broth and spices, also used sausage, shrimp and bell pepper. Put everything in the crock pot and let it cook on low all day. It was good but I didn't care for the taste of the green chili peppers, I will leave those out next time.

I swore I would follow the recipe exactly, right down to the cornbread and beer! But I felt that the amount of meat needed to be increased for all the  broth. I used a whole pack of chicken tenderloins (1 1/2 lbs) and 2 packs of Andouille sausages (2 lbs), kept shrimp at 1 lb. It was excellent but I do think that 3 qts of broth is still too much. The flavor was fabulous! I cheated and used boil in the bag rice - I was serving 10 people! This made a VERY large amount. I would say it serves 16 at least.  The key is the roux, stir for 30 minutes. You want it to be the color of peanut butter. Get your jar out and compare! Definitely worth the work! I would make this again!

This is a delicious recipe. It was my first time cooking and trying Gumbo and learning about Mardi Gras. I reduced celery and parsley by a 1/3. I used one 48oz can of low sodium chicken broth and it was plenty. I didn't use any hot chile peppers, because of family preferences. I will cook it again and look forward to the Mardi Gras tradition next year.

Wonderful! I do change it by using hot Italian sausage, chicken, scallops, shrimp, and crab meat and leave out red chile peppers. I also use almost 3/4 of salted cajun seasoning and the rest unsalted cajun seasoning. It is can get too salty. I serve with rice mixed in. Always get people asking for the recipe!

I used this as a template to make my own gumbo recipe and I will tell you it is one of the most popular recipes we make! Friends and neighbors ask often when we are making another batch. I substitute red fruit wine for the beer because I find it adds that perfect flavor to the broth. This recipe even as it is will be a winner at any table. I use Creole seasoning rather than Cajun, it is similar but with more variety of spices. I usually make a huge jar of the stuff to keep on hand as a meat rub or rice/soup seasoning. The time it takes to make this Gumbo is well worth it. My hats off to the author. 5 bright stars.

This is fabulous!  I used 2 quarts chicken broth, I think 3 would be too soupy.  I also used one 28 oz can of tomatoes instead of a small can + chopped tomatoes.  Truly Delicous!

super pleased with how this turned out.  i didn't follow it exactly, but close enough.  looked up a cajun seasoning recipe & did my own instead, super easy.  and used a frozen gumbo veggie mix with okra & corn in it.  only used the rotel type tomato mix & no other tomatoes or peppers.  was very pleased & will definitely make again.

I have NEVER made a gumbo, nevermind a roux before, and this turned out AMAZING!  I made this for my husband's Christmas party at work (he is the manager of a southern style restaurant in Georgia).  Evertone RAVED about it and at least 7 or 8 people took to-go bowls home.  One of the employees has a brother that lives in Louisiana and has tasted TONS of gumbo and he said this was the best he ever tasted.  He said the roux was fantastic (as one of the other reviewers wrote, it does take about 15-30 minutes and it should be slightly darker than peanut butter when ready).  I doubled the recipe, but used about 3 pounds of sausage and less shrimp.  I also substituted a large can of diced tomatoes for the roma tomatoes, green bell peppers for the red chile peppers, and regular yellow onion for the sweet onion.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that there was too much broth, so I used 6 or 7 cans of chicken broth and 2 bottles of beer (I was limited to the size of my cooking pot, as well!).  My only regret was that there was too much cajun seasoning for my taste (but my husband tells me I'm kind of a sissy when it comes to spicy foods!).  All in all, a VERY SUCCESSFUL recipe!  Would DEFINATELY make it again!

This is the best-and only-gumbo I have ever had. The roux was much easier to make than I thought it would be. I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and it worked just fine. Omitted the shrimp since I'm pregnant. Used 3/4 lb. ground breakfast sausage instead of links although my husband thought links would have been better. He also would have liked it with the shrimp. Couldn't find a red pepper so used jal. pepper instead. Also added about 2 T. green bell pepper chopped. Turned out great and served over rice. My 4 yo even loved it. I also used full amt. of broth and it was soupy, maybe too soupy for some.

OMG! Amazing. Boiled the shrimp tails into a stock & used with 2 cans chicken broth. Took a while to get the reaux dark enough but waited til it was just right. Added cut okra for texture & zest. My 1st attempt at gumbo but the BF raved. Definitely will make again.

I am going to give this 5 stars because to me it turned out great. I only used 8 cups of broth and added a can of clams with half the can juice, two bags of frozen okra and some extra suasage. The one thing I dod change because I as well started getting eary of the strong beer sm ell and the soupyness is to let it simmer longer about an hour longer, and while it simmered I threw a hand full of the shrimp tails in there because I don't have time to make the perfect seafood stock so this was the next best thing and I added a habanero pepper didn;t have any chili peppers. Over all I like I like I will make again! Advice to all ... don't quit trying to make it work cause something seems wrong just troubleshoot and make tweaks.

We love it! I've made it 3 times now and it keeps getting better and better! I usually take the shells from the shrimp and a cup or two of the broth and boil the shells to make a seafood stock to add to the chicken broth. Helps out the shellfish flavor!

Ok.. This was very easy to maek first of all... Second everyone I made it for loved it!! It made such a big pot.. I was the only one who didn't like it but its just not my type of thing to eat.. My mom said she didn't like gumbo she loved it.. My oldest son said he never had it.. He picked the shrimp out & ate like 5 bowls.. My brother also said he didn't like it & kept coming back for more.. EVERYONE loved it.. The reason I had looked up the recipe was because my fiance' had told me his friend FIWA made the best gumbo he had ever had so I wanted to try to beat him lol.. None the less my fiance' & FIWA tried it & liked it... My fiance's brother though said it was the best he had ever had.. I made it just like the recipe had said except for I added a can of oysters, a bag of okra I beleive it was 16oz. it was frozen, A can of clams, two small pouchs of frozen scallops, & I used cajun sausage My Fiance eats very spicy stuff like habeneros so I didnt think it would be spicy enough for him but I dont do hot very well at all. But I added about 3 tbsps of cayenne pepper & it still wasnt spicy to me.. Oh also I didnt have enough chicken broth so I used half chicken broth & half water for how much it called for..& instead of 2 tbsp of fresh chile peppers I used 2 whole ones diced.. & extra cajun seasoning & extra shrimp & sausage & chicken & extra garlic... Lol I guess I did make alot of changes but everyone loved it and it was very easy to make so I will probably make it again

This was my first attempt at gumbo and I am very pleased with the results.  While I thought the spiciness was spot on (I used 1.5 red chilies), my fiancée thought it was a little too spicy.  The flavor, texture and consistency were great and I was pleased with the yellowish color to the roux.  This recipe provides a great foundation to add whatever protein or vegetable you choose.    I made a couple of changes - I added oysters and used garlic paste in lieu of minced garlic.  I also used a little more flour since the roux looked pretty thin, but thickened up nicely when garlic and beer was added. I will definitely make this dish again.

Fantastic! (10 stars after my tinkering)  Born in Dallas, but now living up here in lovely South Carolina I miss good Texas BBQ, good Mexican food, and good Cajun Gumbo. I used Lupe's as my base recipe. I used onion, celery, red and green bell pepper, garlic, some fresh tomato, and a can of crushed tomatoes for the veggies. Used chic broth, used 2lbs shrimp, 3 chic breasts, and my major change was 5 sweet Italian sausage links cut up and pan fried instead of the smoked sausage - Please don't shoot me but I like the Italian sausage SO MUCH BETTER! I also added half a bag of frozen raw okra to the end when I put the shrimp in.  My husband stomped his feet and said I might as well slap him because it was so good!!! I was very proud of myself for taking the time to make a perfect roux, it does take about 35 min. I also used the Zatarains Creole seasoning. I will add the fresh parsley next time. Honestly I've been to Louisiana and had authentic Gumbo, and this is awesome. Our favorite meal. Thank You Lupe Boudreaux

This was incredible. One of the best things I ever made and I will be making this for a long time to come.   I did make a few changes. I added a little more chopped chicken than mentioned in the recipe; because I bought a 1 lb packet of chicken and I didn't want to freeze the rest. Also, I had only a smoked turkey sausage and I had 1 lb of it - I used the whole thing. For the roux, I used whole wheat flour, but since it is already brown in color, it is hard to decide when to stop. Keep stirring and pay attention to the roux. I kept tasting it periodically to make sure that it wasn't getting burned. My parents do not eat anything spicy. So I added about 2 tablespoons of cajun spicing rather than 1/4 cup. It turned out to be perfect. Finally, according to other comments here, I used only 4 cups of chicken broth and added the cooked shrimp to the gumbo at the very end (about 2-3 mins to spare).   Anyway, this was an amazing recipe and the only minor suggestion is that okra be added to the recipe as well - to complete the Gumbo.

I am sitting down to a bowl of this gumbo right now and it is nothing short of amazing! This was my first attempt at gumbo and I am pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but used canned whole roma tomatoes (which I diced) and let the veggies and spices simmer for about an hour and a half as opposed to 40 minutes. I wanted the celery to soften up a little more. There's no doubt...I will definitely be making this again!

A very easy and delicious gumbo recipe! The prep time did take some time, but it was definitely worth it in the end! I made the roux and then threw everything else into my slow cooker. I had to cut down the amount of broth to about 4-5 cups due to the size of my slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 2 hours and then low for 3-4 hours. I used green bell peppers instead of red chili peppers, and I also added in some sliced okra. I only used chicken breasts because that's all that I had on hand. There was still tons of spice/heat from the cajun seasoning, but it mainly ended up in the olive oil layer at the end. I skimmed the oil, and let everyone add however much oil they wanted to their bowl if they wanted a more spicy gumbo. I served it over a bed of rice and used French bread for dipping...soo yummy! Everyone loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again in the future, but I will try to use chicken thighs instead of breasts next time.

I made this yesterday...it turned out wonderful! I only used 1/3 cup of oil for 5 servings and about 5 cups of chicken broth...I made my own cajun seasoning from a recipe on Allrecipes...think it was Cajun Seasoning 1...I will definitely make this again..this was one of the best recipes i've tried and I've tried over 100 so far...

Wasn't as expected from the reviews. Tossed the pot away with the gumbo in it! Kidding about the pot but the recipe wasn't good to our taste buds.

And the oscar goes to the person who submitted this recipe!!!!  Holy jumpin crawfish was this awesome and so fun to make!  Not for the beginner I asure you.  Making the roux was a little scary.  I kept adjusting the heat afraid I was gonna burn it but it turned out perfect!  When you add the minced garlic it will scare you cuz it pops and sizzles but it's ok.. just keep stirring.  I don't like shrimp so I chopped up two lobster tails and added those during the last 10 mins of cooking. I didn't have a red pepper so I used crushed red pepper instead.  Whoo Wee!  what a bite.  Absolutely fab.  Serving it with white rice and french bread tonight.  PS. I double the chicken.. just didn't seem like one cup was enough.  Can wait to take this to a pot luck.

i won't make it again.  i was prepared to be wowed based on the ratings.  BUT.  yuck!  the beer flavor and aroma was too strong.  the whole thing is too oily and the chicken is tough (too much cooking).  finally, the overall flavor is just not that great.  a little spicy but boring.  not at all like the great gumbos you find in new orleans.  i'm still looking for the right recipe.  this isn't it.

Expensive to make but soo good to eat. This is another recepie that has my family licking their plates. The only thing I changed was adding a few serrano pepers. It gives it an extra zing. Delish!

This gumbo is amazing! I was feeding eight so I made 10 servings. I added 6 ounces of lump crab meat, cooked the chicken with 1/2 cup of sliced onion and mixed in 4 cups of cooked white rice 10 minutes before serving. Even my VERY picky 8-year-old ate every drop in her bowl. Thanks for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe the night I made it which we ate with some home made corny corn bread and rice.  However, the following day it seemed REALLY salty for some reason.  Not sure what happened, but if any one has any ideas please let me know....could it have been from the polska sausage I used?

The smell of beer threw me off but it was pretty good. I thought it was a bit spicy until I found out it had been spiked with lots of cayenne pepper behind my back. Thanks DH for the surprise.:) Overall I liked but would use maybe a little less beer. I added rice to thicken it up which made a perfect consistency. Thanks and will try again when hubby isn't home to assist.

Phenomenal Gumbo! we're stuck at home with a baby and unable to eat out. But this recipe was BETTER than a restaurant's version of gumbo. I am not a very great cook, but this recipe made me one. But, I used just about half of the chicken broth. Everything else, I followed to a 'T'. I cut the veggies like it said, made the roux for almost 20-30 minute to get that light caramel color. It was very spicy, but very delicious. You must try this!

We just done eating this for dinner.  It was soooooo good.  I have never been to Louisiana but my husband spent a couple of years there while in the Navy.  He said that this tastes like the authentic gumbo that he got in New Orleans.  It is  a keeper!  I did make a couple tiny adjustments.  We really like food with kick so I used 1-1/2 the amount of cajun seasoning and added 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  We all loved it!!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

Crazy about this recipe, made it for our dinner on the grounds for my local church and received rave reviews! Next time, I will take note of  using too much chicken stock since it can make the gumbo too salty. Thanks for the recipe.

OMG - absolutely bulet-proof recipe! I was first-timer in gumbo making, it came out so beautifully.
You can add more vegetables, prawns or chicken broth to adjust the  desired thickness and flavour. 
Have to admit, needed to triple the amount of cajun spices for extra "kick". Green fresh prawns are better, but tried with frozen ones, not too bad either.

If you do not try this recipe - you will miss a lot...

This is the absolute best gumbo I've ever made. I cut back a  bit on the chilies and the water for personal preference, but the flavor was phenomenal.

Awesome!  I've made this gumbo three time now, and it's always a hit!  I let the roux darken for about 30-35 minutes before adding the garlic.  My friends and I love SPICY food, and this gumbo definitely has a kick with the Cajun spices.  Great!

Excellent flavor!  I made a few changes, however - I used 1/8 cup of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning rather than 1/4 cup, and used 3 cubes of chicken flavore bouillon with 5 cups of water.  I also added one green chopped pepper rather then the red pepper and added one chopped leek.  Highly reccomend.

Whoooeee !! This was amazing after a few minor tweeks. Used 2 Qts stock, switched out the red chilies for green pepper. added some okra (its not gumbo w/o okra) cut the cajun seasoning down just a bit so the kids would still eat it, served it over rice. Definatly will Add more chicken and sausage next time. Makes a very nice size pot we ate on this for 3 days. Now thats sum good eatin!

Great recipe, even without okra (almost impossible to find up here in the Northeast).  The key to this is the roux - it takes about 15 minutes of stirring to get it the right caramel color.  If it burns, you have to throw it out!  Also, this roux can be made with less oil and flour - 3/4 of each is much better - less greasy but still very tasty.

Wow this was great I even was missing several things and had to sub.  I was looking for something to use my leftovers from the week.  I can’t wait to make this with everything I will tell my substitutions for those who are in the mood for gumbo but didn’t have everything.  
I doubled the chicken then I boiled chicken and sausage with all the left over chopping from the veges to make broth.  The leek tops help a lot.  I had no celery =( so I added some celery salt and a vege Bouillon cube.  I used one large can diced tomatoes and all the peppers in the house a variety of medium and hot peppers.  I was short on Cajun seasoning so I added file powder.  I also used the medium sized shrimp.  Mine was soupy I could almost but some orzo pasta and make Cajun soup.  I used Gluten Free flour mixture may not work as good.   No chili peppers and dried red pepper flakes that I grew and dried.
The only thing I will do next time I like mine thicker I will only with 2 quarts of broth.  As this makes a lot have some freezing containers ready.

Spicy and scrumptious! This was a huge hit (huge in many senses-- we have a lot of leftovers! This recipe makes a ton). The only change I made was that I used half the amount of shrimp and added 1/2 lb of small scallops, which worked quite well. SERIOUSLY YUMMY recipe!

My husband and I made this together - he worked on the roux which came out perfect for our first time, I used a cajun spiced sausage and removed casing, it re-heated great - my son liked it even better the next day - made a lot and will freeze some for a quick meal when temps get colder

This is EXCELLENT gumbo, and was a hit for our party.  I added more sausage and shrimp than what the recipe called for and will add even more the next time we make this -- perhaps double.  We had quite a bit of stock leftover relative to the amount of veggies and meats. This is a keeper!

Great recipe.  If you're making gumbo, you need to at least add okra.  I also put in crab meat like everyone else.  I also halved the olive oil and it tasted the same.  Very easy to make too!

I made this for some friends for Mardi Gras night last weekend.  It was easy to make (I doubled the recipe, but used the original amount of Cajun Spice).  It was such a big hit, that my friends all took some home, and asked for the recipe!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  I served it with dirty rice (just the packaged kind), and when I was putting away the leftovers that I got to keep, I added the rice to it and it was fantastic!

Oh my goodness that was good!!!  Just made this tonight.  And it is yummy!  Made a few changes based on the other reviews:  I used 5 cups of broth at first but it was too thick so I added another cup, I also used butter instead of olive oil to make the roux, which may count for the extreme thickness, not sure.  I didn't use chicken but added more sausage, crab and ocra. also I used a can of tomatoes instead of the roma ones. Even with all the changes it turned out great! I will definitely will make this again for sure!!

INCREDIBLE!  I have been making this for a couple of years and someone always asks for the recipe. This time I used Rotel and Andoulle sausage...I'm waiting for the rice to cook right now, and have already had a bowl of gumbo without it.
02/04/12 Update:   I've made this many times and have started adding okra (personal taste).  I always get requests from friends for me to make it.  Heaven forbid if I make it and neglect to save them some!  I have burned the rue a time or two over the years and had to start over...just remember to cook it slowly and constantly stir it, a good rue makes all the difference!

This gumbo recipe was excellent.  I made several modifications to make it a gluten free recipe and it didn't change the flavor at all, which does not always happen when cooking wheat-free.  I also boiled the chicken first, and added some of the chicken broth, in addition to one bottle of Ramapo Valley GF beer.  I used a 4-bean flour cup of flour and again, the grainy texture of those flours only enhanced the roux.  This recipe makes more than 10 servings, but you'll wnat to eat this time and time again throughout the week.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A bit labor intensive but very tasty. It was a bit soupier than I expected so I added some more canned chopped tomatoes and some okra. I thought the seasoning was perfect, enough to make your nose run but not too hot. I'll make this again!

Overall it was a good tasting recipe.  I expected it to be thicker than it was.  The ingredients ended up costing me more than I'm willing to spend on gumbo no matter how good it is.  Also, it seemed like it was missing something; like maybe some chicken bullion cubes would have helped.  I probably won't make it again to figure it out though.

This was incredibly good. And extremely easy to make. I've made many different gumbo recipes but this was by far the fastest and easiest of them all. On top of that it was delicious. I know it's good when my son goes back for thirds and my daughter gets seconds. She doesnt like a lot of heat and she called this one "perfect" on the heat scale.  I agree that it would be even better with crab and oysters added to the mix. GREAT recipe. Thank you very much.

Wow.  Very yummy.  We used Eye of the Hawk beer (found at Trader Joe's) and 1/2 Tony's Creole, 1/2 Old Bay.  Next time, we'll add oysters and scallops -- definately called for more of a seafood kick.  Absolutely superb -- thanks for sharing. =)

Having never cooked gumbo before I choose this recipe by the amount of reviews it had and I am glad I did! This was a very good recipe that can serve my small army and have leftovers to freeze. Was wonderful and very tasty thank you so much.

Very good!  Being from New Orleans I wanted to find a really good gumbo recipe for a party I was throwing. People know their gumbo down here.  This one was a big hit.  I was asked to e-mail this recipe to most of them.  Will make again.

This recipe was impressive. But if you want some real gumbo try the chicken andouille gumbo posted on this website. It is full of flavors and spice.

I've lived in south Louisiana all of my life and this is the best recipe for gumbo 
I have ever found. I didn't have chile peppers both times I've made it and it still turned out great. When and if it gets cold enough down here I'll definitly be making again.

Very good recipe.  I've never made gumbo before, but it wasn't as hard as I thought...  just time consuming.  I made a few little modifications due to lack of ingredients.  I used sweet italian sausage.  I also forgot to buy any red chiles, but with a 1/4 cup of Old Bay it had enough kick for me!  Also used leftover chicken from the night before.  Reheats very well!

This was the first time I had ever made gumbo, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out outstanding. I was a little skeptical of the ingredients--the beer especially--but I went ahead and added it. I did, however, take a few creative liberties: I skipped the sausage altogether and added crab meat instead. I also added okra and a small can of mushrooms. Per the advice of others who have made this, I lowered the amount of stock I used. I also sprinkled in a bit of cayenne and old bay seasoning. When I cooked the chicken, I sprinkled some cajun seasoning on it. I think that's it. Oh, and I also added file at the end. This was absolutely delicious!!!

After reading all the wonderful reviews on this recipe I decided to try it.  Unfortunately it didn't turn out at all. . . I ended up throwing most of it away.  I can't figure out what I did wrong; maybe I just don't know how gumbo is supposed to taste.  Perhaps I'll try again someday.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  We used things left over from a party: frozen cocktail shrimp, lil' smokies, beer, green peppers.  I used about 1-2 Tbl of cajun seasoning but also added a/2 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp thyme, and a dash of paprika.  Its best served with rice.

As per the invaluable opinions on this recipe I read, I did cut the broth down, used 1 1/2 lbs chicken, 1 lb each Andouille and shrimp, used broth I made from the chicken cooking liquid (add a carrot, celery, onion and bay leaf), and added okra.  Used Gumbo File' that took me 3 markets to find, my husband thinks that this was all the recipe needed (It should be stirred with a little cold water first, like corn starch).  This was a great recipe, I loved it more than that served by our Cajun local restaurant, Bon Temps!!!!

Wow.  What a great recipe.  My father's a cajun, and I've never had better.  I made the recipe as is (although I don't know how much broth I used, since I did it by watching the consistency).  One thing I did do that I believe made a difference in the tastiness is that I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I boiled the thighs in a big pot for about 45 minutes, and then I used the water I boiled them in plus a little salt as the broth.  I didn't use shrimp (too expensive!), and I substituted turkey kielbasa for the sausage.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Excellent recipe. I used andoulle sausage, extra chicken and the 1# of shrimp.  Served it with rice in a cup on the side with the Real N'awlins Muffuletta sandwich.  Great combo.  Everyone loved the gumbo.

STOP READING!  you have found your new favorite gumbo recipe! Our grocery store had serrano peppers instead of chili peppers...three of those little devils made this dish an aerobic workout!  Because of the reviews we did cut down on the broth by 32 oz...either way it would have been fabulous!  Also used turkey sausage...ENJOY!

I have been searching for a good gumbo recipe for months and here it is!!!! Just a few suggestions, cut back to 2 quarts broth, add more chicken & shrimp, add two cups of white rice while it simmers (this will thicken it up)and 1 can of diced tomoatoes with basil,garlic,oregano...without that last can of tomoatoes it seemed like it was missing something but that was the perfect cure that hit the spot to make it a litte sweeter. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Very Good! Hubby loved it. The roux didn't darken as it should, but the flavor was still there. I substituted smoked turkey kielbasa for the pork sausage and also added file and crushed red peppers. I also increased the cajun seasoning to 1/2 cup. We like it hot!! becasue the sauce seemed to be a tad runny I also added 2.5 cups cooked rice after it was done simmering. Thickened up to perfection! Served cornbread on the side.
Awesome recipe!!! A Keeper!!!

I have made this recipe twice, both times to rave reviews. Both times I've made it a little differently, but the spices and variety of ingredients are what I think make this dish. I cut the liquid back to about 1.5-2 quarts so that it comes out a little thicker and more suitable to be served on rice. I also didn't have "cajun seasoning" on hand so I made my own with a mix of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and paprika. My husband asks for it all the time now. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful flavor and easy to fix! I didn't have the roma tomatoes or the celery, so I substituted a can of stewed tomatoes that contained celery. I also omitted the chicken, as my husband is not fond of it, and increased sausage to 1 lb. Instead of serving rice on the side I added 3 cups instant rice after adding the meat and then covered and cooked for 5 minutes. Also, I used Tony's creole seasoning and only added about 1/8 cup instead of 1/4, and I did not add the fresh red chile peppers. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used andouille sausage and increased  the shrimp.  There was too much liquid also.  I reduced the chicken broth and substituted some spicy V 8 juice. A tasty dish!

Very good!! I highly recommend this gumbo. I had never made gumbo before and this was perfect, with great flavor. The only thing I did different was simmer the chicken and sausage in the broth and veggies for the 40 minutes (I did that by mistake, but it didn't affect the gumbo at all).

This was fantastic!!  I did what others suggested and cut back on the broth.  I didn't have shrimp so I through in some cod.  A friend suggested that I make the roux in the oven.  No stirring though it may take a little longer.  I'll try that next time.

This was my first attempt at gumbo and I found this recipe easy and fun to make! I used butter to make my roux and did not put chicken in it. I used andouille sausage and fresh shrimp and it was enough. I also used yellow rice and left out the red chili flakes to keep the heat down. My very picky 14 year old ate it for dinner and took it to school for lunch.

I made this for some friends and it was a HUGE hit.  Following suggestions of others, I reduced broth amount to two quarts and one can.  I also omitted the chopped peppers since I was serving it to others, and used only approximately 3 TBSP of Cajun seasoning, tasting as I added a bit at a time.  I also sauteed the shrimp separately in a little garlic-infused olive oil and let people add their own to the gumbo.  Add some nice French bread and bring in some beignets and you have a perfect meal!

Used andouille sausage, chicken thighs instead of breasts, and added half a cup of brown rice at the end to soak up a little of the liquid. Might add okra next time.

My family enjoyed this recipe! I did leave out the hot peppers, because it would have been a little too hot. During the last 20 minutes of cooking, I added the chicken and sausage for 10 of the 20 minutes.  I then added the shrimp, (which were a little smaller) 10 minutes before completion.  I will definitely make this recipe again! It was awesome. Thank you for sharing.

We frequently visit NOLA and this tasted just like the gumbo at Morning Call. We’ll definitely try this one again and again!

I did not care for this recipel. I assume I did NOT make the roux well. I stirred it a long time and let it get brown and bubbly. I will not make it again unless someone coaches me through the roux.

The roux was much easier than the traditional one I make and it was delicious!  Sub'd chicken tenders instead of breasts but you didn't notice.  Great recipe!

This was an amazing dish! My husband went back for seconds and then for thirds when my back was turned. The flavours were wonderful. I also added crab as the reviewer came back and noted and it was a really nice addition. This is a great party dish. Thank you.

Added more chicken and sausage as others had suggested.  This was SO good!! Velvety and only somewhat spicy.  I could handle it and usually I am a wimp.  Will definitely make again, for guests!

This recipe was delicious... I’m a little bit particular about very spicy, so I didn’t add the fresh red chili peppers. For me it was still spicy. “This recipe was very good, and will try it again.”

Made this as directed. Awesome flavor. A hint of Cajun, but not to spicy. Family really loved it. Next time I will use more meat and a little lest fluid. Went well with rice and honey cornbread.

I did not add the fresh chile peppers, but added some fresh red bell peppers , diced and it was the perfect heat. It was even better the next day.  Would definitely make it again and add the pork sausage already cooked for less fat.

I just made this for dinner and my family loved it! I will make it again, however, this recipe made so much that we will have several meals from it. I made one important change. I could not bring myself to put a full cup of olive oil in it. The fat! The calories! So I made my roux with a quarter cup of olive oil and a quarter cup of flour. After browning the roux, I shook a half cup of flour with two cups of water and added it to the roux. Still had all the flavor and thickening action.  Superb!

I really liked this recipe.  I had not prepared a roux before and found it to be very time consuming. I did make the mistake of adding the garlic a little too early and it bubbled up and did slightly burn-did not effect the take though. I reduced the seasoning in half to reduce the salt and I liked that flavor.  Also, I added more sausage and only added shrimp immediately before service to not over cook.

This was delicious!  A nice Mardi Gras dinner, my husband and I loved it!  Since my husband likes super spicy and I like mild spicy, I used poblano peppers with some smoked paprika and some chipotle peppers.  Bought some red chile peppers in a tube (produce section) for my husband to add to his bowl. Served it with garlic rice and cornbread.   So yummy!

One of the key things pointed out is to cook all the meat and seafood first.  It really keeps all the flavors intact and makes a big difference in the final outcome.  Great recipe.  Don't forget to add the File Gumbo powder right at the end!

I've been using variations of this recipe for years and my family requests it every year. I make an extra turkey at Thanksgiving, and use it instead of chicken. Based on tips from other reviews, and my own personal preference I add/change the following:
Use leftover Turkey
Use Andouille Sausage
Don't use Chicken Stock - make my own flavorful shrimp stock. After I peel the shrimp I bake the shells (optional) and let them steep for an hour or so in several quarts of water - makes a wonderful shrimp stock and adds more depth to the recipe.
Use fire roasted tomatoes, along with the previously mentioned tips of adding roasted poblanos and okra that's been seared so it's not gummy. Also needs to be finished with some file'! Great recipe and a family favorite! Thanks!

This was really good!! The roux was hard to make in an electric skillet. We stirred it for at least 45 minutes and couldn't get it to turn any darker than peanut butter color.  I used the skillet because I didn't have a large enough sauce pan. It makes a lot if you follow the recipe as written. I added the file powder at the end as suggested by other reviewers.  I added a few shakes of tobasco sauce which gave it a heat that didn't burn your mouth up.  We ate it for 3 meals; once with saltines, once with crispy garlic bread, and then with rotini pasta.  I will definitely make this again!! The recipe is easy enough to memorize.

Great recipe! I didn’t have broth so instead, I used 3 packets of sazon seasoning. Instead of pork I used chicken sausage. Made my own Cajun seasoning with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, red pepper flakes. Everyone loved it! My family’s new favorite recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  I followed the recipe as directed with the only change being I used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs instead of breast meat.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This gumbo is fantastic!  The time it takes to make the roux is well worth the flavor at the end.  My husband loves it and I have made it over and over.

I replaced the chili peppers with bell peppers to cut some heat out and I also used Kielbasa in place of the sausage and I added shredded pork. I'm not a fan of chunks of tomatoes, onion or peppers; so I blended them to make a sauce and used that. But all in all this was a great starting point for me. We all loved it and will definitely make it again.

I made this tonight and it was very good! My pickiest eater loved it! (I didn't tell her there was shrimp in it :P) I couldn't find chiles at the store so I used a jalapeño instead, husband likes it spicy anyway. It was still bearable for the rest of us, too, including said picky eater. I used a can of crab meat also, as recommended by several reviewers. This went very well over rice! I only used 2 1/2 quarts of broth instead of 3 and it was quite liquid-y but not too much. Use less if you want it less soupy, but the rice soaks it up nicely. Yum!

love this recipe!  so happy!  i followed the recipe EXCEPT: i used 2 containers of chicken stock not 3,  i skipped the roma tomatoes and just used 2 cans of the tomatoes instead.  i skipped the red chili peppers and fresh parsley and used a little dried parsley instead.  i used a little less cajun and added a little bit of creole seasoning.  it was great!  the only thing i should have done is stirred and made the roux for longer.  i had no idea and after 20 minutes starting adding ingredients.  apparently you should do this for maybe 40 minutes until it gets dark.  not a big deal it was still really good and made so much.

I made this for Mardi Gras for some friends.   I didn't have a beer so I used a dry white wine instead.  I poached bone in chicken breasts and made my own chicken broth.  The chicken wasn't as dry as boneless breasts can sometimes be.   All positive comments from my "foodie" friends.   I will definitely make this again.  This time using the beer.

Very very  good! I used andouille sausage but followed the recipe otherwise. It was not as spicy as I would have liked. Next time I will use hotter chili peppers.  We liked it over white rice. Also, this is one of those dishes that gets better with age as the ingredients meld together. Consider making it ahead of time and eating when the flavor profile is at it's best!

I made this Saturday night and it was fabulous!  However, I did make some substitutions.  I used turkey polish (instead of pork), fresh tomatoes (no canned), 2 cans of chicken broth, 4 cups of water (no beer), green peppers instead of red chillies and file' seasoning instead of cajun seasoning.  Definitely a winner!

This is a real true to life Louisiana gumbo recipe. I made it precisely per the recipe for a large gathering. However this would be easily adaptable to chicken or rabbit or more and different seafood. Though I like spicy, this is not overly so. People who might be less adventurous can surely enjoy this recipe. Those that prefer things a little warmer would be well served to have their favorite hot sauce nearby. I will definitely cook this again.

Made this yesterday. As advertised delicious! Made the following changes. Grocery store had no red Chiles. Used two Serrano chiles and about 1/8 cup cayenne powder. Was a little surprised at the lack of veggies so I diced a half yellow bell pepper, dumped in an entire can of green beans and diced 5. I could barely find Parsley in any form after Christmas so I used dried. Didn't really measure it out but prob about a 1/8 cup also. Keep in mind this was VERY spicy! Not for the weak. Used jasmine rice and just poured the gumbo over the cooked rice. It's amazing!

I cup back on the oil to approximately 3/4 cup.  The roux was not affected at all.  I also add frozen okra.   Love this recipe.

Great recipe! Lots of work in mess but very good love it!

I used about 1.5 lb of chicken breast tenderloins and they cooked up perfectly.

Very good!  Only change I would make is to first soften the onion/garlic/celery before making the roux.  The only way I know how to make a roux is with butter, so subbed butter for the olive oil, and also added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  Must note that this made a HUGE amount of gumbo, definitely need a big appetite for this one.  Would make it again!

I have made this recipe twice and am about to make it again.  I add okra and more peppers.  I also add cooked shrimp right at the end.   We really love it.

I did not care for it much at all. It may be me, but I don't think so. I suggest cutting it in half so at least you minimize your disappointment. I will NOT make it again nor do I recommend.

Second time making this and it gets better the second day!  I like to add some Slap Your Mama for an extra kick. Love that this recipe doesn't include okra as well and is thick without them. If you haven't tried this recipe, it's really as good as everyone has reviewed.

Delicious. It takes a while but is well worth it! I did what some of the others on here recommended and cut it down to 3 cans of chicken broth. I also recommend less than 2 tablespoons of red chile. I might try 1 to 1.5 tablespoons next time. My roux consisted of 3/4 cups of olive oil, 1/4 cups of butter, and 1 cup of flour. I cooked/stirred for 35-40 mins. Afterwards, I transferred it over to a slow cooker holding the rest of the ingredients. I also added okra. The taste the next morning was much better than the initial taste the night before.

Very delicious for the cold nights! Based on the reviews I decided to cut the recipe in half. I made a big boo boo by not halving the beer so I tried to boil it longer to get rid of the beer taste.

This was really tasty and the meat can be adjusted to your own likings. I used spicy med. sausage cooked up in the pot first. Removed and drained. Then used 3 pepper smoked sausage, 3 chicken breast and a lb. of shrimp. I wasn't sure what kind of red pepper to use so I think mine might of been extra hot as the gumbo had quite a kick to it but that could of also been the meat products I used. I marinated the shrimp after peeling in some of the Cajun spice used from the 1/4 cup measurement. I also added some green beans as I'm not a fan of slimy okra. The liquid was too much and I left out 2 cups. Even over rice I have way more liquid than I need. Will probably end up throwing it out after the rest is eaten. I will probably leave out the last quart next time. I think more can always be added at the end if too thick. I used a combination of chicken broth and stock. This was even better the next day so I recommend making it the day before needing it.

This was ok!  My husband liked it.  I left the shrimp out because he doesn't like chicken and shrimp together.  I thought it had to much grease in it.  After reading reviews I used butter instead of olive oil so that may be why.  I also felt that it had to much broth.  I ended up draining a lot of it off before putting the leftovers away.    Will make it again for husband using less broth and using olive oil.  Just not my thing!

I made this for a sit down murder mystery dinner party for 40 people in a very large pot.  I simmered everything BUT the seafood for a day then let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning before the party, I added LOTS of seafood, more sausage, and okra, simmered a bit more, then hour before party I added FAR more shrimp from the gulf, frozen and cooked .  We had nothing left of this gumbo :-)

So the only thing I would add is to add fAR more shrimp, oysters, and sliced sausages.

Great recipe! The family LOVED it! I'm not a foodie, so I can't say if this is "authentic" gumbo, but it's delicious nonetheless! The ONLY change I made was that I used smoked turkey sausage.

Excellent gumbo! I absolutely loved this soup. I used only 2 quarts of chicken broth and it was more than enough. I also threw in a tomato bouillon cube. The end result was marvelous!

Great recipe!  Subbed chicken breasts with boneless chicken thighs. Added frozen okra and finished with gumbo file.  Reduced the amount of cajun seasoning to 2 TBS (because of the salt) but added some hot sauce for heat.  Also cooked some white rice and added it to the gumbo.

Excellent! Produced groans of happiness from hubby. Used less chicken broth & more crushed tomatoes, canned green chiles instead of fresh, and less Cajun seasoning. It makes a BIG pot... 10 servings? That must be based on feeding 10 hungry linebackers- ? Lots of leftovers, but looking forward to enjoying more! *Cajun seasoning we used (Dinosaur BBQ Cajun Foreplay) was very salty, so reducing the amount, using about 2/3 of the 1/4 cup called for, was a good decision. Turned out just right! MmmmMmmMmm!!

This was really good but really spicy.  I pretty much followed the recipe with just a few changes.  For the chicken I used 2 cups of a  cooked roasted chicken from the store (it was great and saved time).  For the sausage I used an Andouille Sausage (cajun - delicious)and increased quanity to 16oz.  Increased quanity of shrimp to 2 pounds.  Decreased chicken broth to 72oz.  The recipe calls for "red fresh chile peppers" which is redundant.  Chile is spanish for pepper so I used a red jalapeno pepper.  The end product was VERY spicy so next time I will probably tone down the heat so its more acceptable to more people.  One thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the recipe did not call for white rice and so I forgot it.  Everybody knows you have to have white rice with gumbo.  I wont forget next time

I rarely have time to cook anything that takes more than 45 min, but this was so worth it! It was so delicious with just the right amount of kick. I followed the recipe exactly and I got so many compliments on the flavor. It made enough to freeze for later enjoyment. Will make again for sure!

Great recipe! Must add the rice though.  I used smoked Turkey sausage and Central Waters Mud Puppy Porter.  Delicious!

Great flavor!  Only thing different I did was went heavy on Cajun seasoning for extra added zing.

LOVE this recipe.  Now we are vegetarians who do eat seafood.  so I adjust it..using the fake chicken...and the fake brats for the meat part.  I add the shrimp just before we served it..a few minutes is all it needs to cook.  I use a good strong beer..like beck or guiness.  Oh I have made this several times..making it again tomorrow night for guests..and yes yes yes..this is the BEST.  I just got back from NOLA our favorite city in the USA and this recipe rivals all that we saw there (not many vegetarian versions I must admit ha ha)

I never thought I could make "real" gumbo.  WOW, it was awesome.  I will have to say that I think the trick is in the roux. I browned mine till dark brown almost ashy using the sausage drippings also.  I used an extra can  of broth and added okra and corn.  After bringing all to a boil I threw it into my crockpot minus the shrimp.  The last hour of cooking I added in some of the rice to soak up some flavor and oil.  Before serving I did the shrimp in the skillet and then served by adding rice to bowl, then soup and topped with 5-6 of the shrimp.  I had a lot left over so I froze and will do the same when reheating....making shrimp fresh and adding it last.
I will have to say that the beer did enhance the flavour I used Fosters. I cut up fresh jalapenos and chillies to serve on the side for those that wanted more heat.  Served with Sweet Jalapeno cornbread!  YUMMMMM

Delicious, but very labor intensive!  I also wasn't prepared for how much it made.  My normal spaghetti pot was overflowing.  Next time, I'll buy a bigger pot! :)

I precooked 2 chicken breasts in slow cooker then shredded, used 30oz of smoked sausage, 3 cans low sodium chicken broth, 1 can busch, 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can crushed tomatoes, green chiles, red bell pepper, celery, onion, parsley, a lot of seasonings that I like.  I followed directions for the roux, and served over brown rice. Thank you for the recipe idea!!

yes, you read that right, 1 C olive oil/1 C flour. It was fantastic, take the time to brown the roux at least as dark as peanut butter. I used an oktoberfest beer; and 3 qts stock would be WAAAY too much fluid. I used about 1 qt stock, but just add a cup or two at a time until it's a little bit too thick. When you add the veggies.....and then the shrimp 10 min before serving, it will thin a bit more, or you can always add a bit more stock to bring it to the thickness you like. Top with red pepper flakes and serve over rice,rave, rave, rave........what unbelievable flavor the beer adds!!!!!

Very Good but picked out the Shrimp. They got way to rubbery for me when cooking. I would make this again and leave the shrimp to the very very end.  Also save some of the spices to rub on them while they hang out an wait to be cooked so they can soak up some flavor to.

My husband and my kids love this recipe. The reviews and suggestions from others helped greatly.  I cheat a few things on this recipe.  I skip the chicken and increase the shrimp and sausage.  I only use 3-4 cans of chicken broth-this made the gumbo a perfect consistency for us.  I also used "cocktail" shrimp and only added it in the last 5 minutes to heat.  I chose already cooked sausage, such as Hillshire Farm.  These small changes cut down on the prep time and the gumbo is still AMAZING, my husband gives it rave reviews. It makes a large batch, but for my family that's a bonus-we'll have plenty for a second meal that's just as tasty but no work time for me!!

This is really good. I used a jalapeno instead of chili pepper, because store didn't have. Added frozen okra as other suggested and thought it was a nice addition. Will definitely make again.

This is an easy quality gumbo.  I like my gumbo with a little kick and this did not have much to speak of.  If you would like a little extra add a tbsp of red pepper flakes.  If you would like a little more, also add a tsp of white and a tsp of red pepper.

This was without doubt the best gumbo I've ever had. I have tried many styles of gumbo both homemade and at great restaurants and this beat them hands down.  I had people who don't like shrimp and don't like spicy food getting second and third helpings. I've never cooked a gumbo before so all the credit goes to this great recipe. 

Two notes: I didn't use the full amount of cayenne called for and it was still pretty spicy so you may want to half it or even less if you like mild food. At least do it to taste. And I added another 1/2 bottle of beer which cut down a bit on the sweetness of the canned tomatoes and made for a richer taste.

Definitely a show stopper and can't wait to use it at my next dinner party!

I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh plums, it cooks down so you can't tell if they're fresh or not. I also used rotel brand and bud light. I'm from Louisiana and this gumbo recipe is AWESOME just as good as recipes with 3 hour rouxs. A+++ and my diner guests agreed!

Absolute best! I fix this as often as I can when the weather has cooled off and sometimes in the summer too. I've made it so much that I no longer need the recipe it. :) Always tastes just a little bit different every time I make, but it is ALWAYS delish!! I could eat my weight in it!

This recipe makes a lot of soup! I use old large yogurt containers to freeze it, which is the perfect size for my boyfriend and I for dinner. We get a good sized dinner out of it, and then about four more dinners. I buy the cheap $5 bag of precooked shrimp at Walmart and add it right before serving. I also use turkey sausage. My boyfriend LOVES this soup so I make it about once a month. To save on time I chop the vegetables while making the rue (you have to stir between each vegetable, but you save time!)

This was really tasty!  I don't like okra so this was a perfect gumbo recipe for me.  Also, I've never made gumbo before and got great results!  Will make again... and buy peeled/deveined shrimp next time.

Although I did not follow the directions exactly due to our taste, I'm sure the original is very good as my biggest changes were in the meats. This was a last minute thing and I only had chicken and crab, which I used. I followed someone else's advice and threw the chicken in to cook in the soup without any precooking. I would probably not do that again as that made the chicken tougher. I also used cherry tomatoes, ground red pepper, some corn, and rice. It was very good. My husband even liked it and he is not a soup person. He said he would have liked the original recipe more. I made a half batch we ate some and I froze three quart bags. UPDATE*** I thawed a quart bag of this and bought some shrimp to add. It was a huge hit and I was praised repeatedly for it. I also made some garlic bread to dip in it and I was told it hit the spot.

This Gumbo was so good it made me wanna slap my grandmama!  added  some fish chunks. used fish stock instead of chicken.  Added a bit more of the cajun spice.  this recipe is delicious!  I never liked gumbo before, but I always just made the "Mix" kind.  to taste THIS gumbo was a revelation!  I love it now.  Thanks!

This was good. It was a little tricky finding some of the ingredients in England, but even with a knocked together gumbo spice mix, this was a hearty, spicy soup.

Made this gumbo just like the recipe with the exception - left out the beer and added a little gumbo file - and my family kept asking for it for every meal, including breakfast, until it ran out. They still talk about it. This gumbo recipe is the one! I made sure that I cooked the roux until it was nice and dark and nutty smelling. Love that it uses olive oil instead of another fat option.

We are huge fans of gumbo and make it 3 or 4 times a month.  How I've never ran across this recipe is shocking to me - but made it last night for the first time and it rocks!  Our favorite by far!   Did not have red chile peppers so I used a good tablespoon of red pepper flakes and my "bunch" of fresh parsley from the store was huge and I was worried it'd be too much so I chopped up a heaping cup and that was perfect.  Our guests raved and my dh and I couldn't be happier with our new favorite gumbo - affectionally called Stomp Gumbo in our house.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was great!!! Of course I tweaked slighty. Browned flour in hot oven for 30 mins b4 making the roux. Grilled some Jala's and added them, as I couldn't find fresh red chilis. Used cajun andouille sausage. Squeezed fresh lemon in at end. Served w broiled sourdough bread. I accidentally used a hefeweizen beer and counteracted the bitter flavor by adding organic sugar. YUM!!!!!!!!

Excellent flavor! I cut the olive oil and flour to 3/4 cup. I only added 2 quarts of chicken stock and 1 quart of V8 juice. I added roasted garlic.

I made this last night for a Mardi Gras party and it was a big hit!  After making the roux (it did look like peanut butter!  Used 3/4 cup each flour and oil), I put everything in a crock pot and left it alone.  Used 2 quarts chicken broth - boiled some on the stove with the shrimp shells as suggested.  Used andoullie sausage and 3 large chicken breasts which I let cook with the liquid and shredded right before serving.  Didn't have roma so I used a 2nd can of diced tom with green chilis, drained.  Added 1/2 tsp file to thicken gumbo hour before serving.  Added 1/2 bag frozen okra and the shrimp half hour before serving.  Used 1/8 cajun seasoning cuz I'm a sissy.  Will definitely make again!  Very good!  Thanks so much and thanks to everyone who rates the recipe - helped a lot!

This will be helpful for Aussies:-)  I use Chorizo for the sausage, Aussie beer (coopers), and I made up my own cajun spice.  Because I'm also gluten intolerant I use White Wings Gluten free Plain Flour and It works just as well as normal flour:)  We like to add some okra as well.

Fantastic recipe!  Made this for New Years Day 2010 and was a big hit with our family and our guests.  Did not have a red chili on hand, used a Serrano pepper instead ... Bam!  Definitely kicked it up a bit.  Also used some organic andouille in place of the sausage links, and a touch of old bay, on top of the cajun seasoning.   Served over rice.. yum yum!  Beer in the pot and served at the table was Heihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel, a great malty beer for Gumbo.

i followed the recipe. but added some canned crab, canned oysters (i sujest cutting them up because they have good flavour but are mushy in texture.) i also added some diced mushrooms. i doubled the roux (don't remember how its spelled) and make sure you make it dark. be careful not to burn it. once it gets as dark as peanut butter, just turn it down a little and let it cook longer. keep stiring.

WOW!! I lost my favorite gumbo recipe and decided to give this one a try. YUM! I doubled the chicken and sausage, used canned diced tomatoes in place of roma, substituted some green chiles and jalapenos for the red chiles (could not find any!), and added two small bags of frozen okra. Served it over rice- amazing!! It made so much that we have eaten it for a couple of days and I froze a large container for a quick weeknight meal!! Thanks!

I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and added just a bit more broth and seasoning so that I could add the rice to the pot instead of serving the gumbo over the rice. This was an excellent recipe! I was looking for a gumbo with no oakra and minimal tomato for hubbys sake and this was PERFECT! Easy too!!

We love this recipe! We made a few changes: Used Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and used a green bell pepper instead of the red pepper. It was still spicy but even I loved it and I'm allergic to pepper so I haven't exactly developed a palate for spicy foods over the years. We will definitely make this again. Don't forget the rice (we used long grain wild rice) and lots of cornbread (About 3 boxes)

My guests raved about this one & wanted to take the recipe home with them! I made a few changes: only used 2 quarts of chicken broth, skipped the beer, and only added 1/2 cup of chopped parsley (I made these changes b/c I did a poor job shopping & didn't have everything I needed!). It came out wonderful, and the leftovers the next day were even better. We served it over rice and used French bread slices to sop up all the awesome juices/sauce. Warning ... it's spicy (not too much so, but probably too much for some folks). Skipping the red pepper would probably make it more platable for those who like things milder. Great recipe!

Excellent! - I joined allrecipes.com just to review this one.  I add okra to mine and the meat/fish is different everytime I make it. I dont always have shrimp on hand but all chicken or all sausage is great too!  You can't go wrong with this recipe to serve a party crowd or house guests. I also cut back the olive oil for the rue to 3/4 cup when making 10 servings.  It is definitely worth the time to make.

Amazing gumbo! Tastes and looks just like what I ate in New Orleans recently. Used 6 cups broth, no beer and substituted 1 can diced tomatoes for the fresh romas. Also added shrimp in only in the last 5 minutes of cooking to keep them from being overdone. Definitely making again soon!

Great recipe - have made this twice and here's what I found: I used half the broth (1.5 quarts) and did not use beer.  I also used half of the flour/oil for the roux BUT I kept the amounts the same for the rest of the ingredients.  This made the gumbo less soupy which is what I prefer.  I did not use the red pepper, instead I used paprika.  This had the perfect amount of spice...I think the red pepper would have been too much.

this is an awesome recipe.  a few changes.  i used chicken thighs and brown them with some of the cajun seasoning.  then i cut it up into bite size pieces.  i browned the sausage with the chicken and cut them bite size too.  i used cajun stewed tomatoes and cut bite size as well, and let out the fresh tomato. also, when the roux was very chocolatey brown i added the garlic, celery, and onion. i substituted green bell pepper for the red chile.  then i added the chicken broth which i had pre heated. let all the rest the same...oh maybe a little less cajun seasoning because it was a litte salty.

Seriously, the BEST gumbo ever.  Worth all the lovin' care necessary for chopping and stirring! I used 1 lb. turkey polska kielbasa, 1 lb. talapia, and 1 lb. shrimp (no chicken) and added then in that order after the 40 minutes of simmering-no need to use two pans.  Used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic instead of the tomatoes with chiles.  And for the peppers, I used 3 serranos (minced), 1 larged red bell pepper and 1 pablano pepper (chopped), and through in a whole habanero, which I removed when the cooking was finished. I used creole seasoning instead of cajun and added a capful of lemon juice and three smashed cloves of garlic.  Made the rue with 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola.  Very small tweakings, based largely on what I had on hand.  THIS IS FANTASTIC GUMBO!

The real secret to making this, is to crank up some Cajun tunes, sharpen your knives and get out the iron cookware. I had a ball doing this on this rainy day!! I've always hated gumbo because of the okra factor, so I was thrilled to find this recipe. Loved making the roux, it was just fun to cook something that is more or less an art form. (The article about it on this website was a huge help!) Only place I deviated was the shrimp, and only because this was my first attempt and if I botched it, I didn't want to be out chicken, sausage AND shrimp. Next time there will be shrimp, and there WILL be a next time. And it will be a side dish at our shrimp boil party this summer.

Even the people in my life that don't like spicy food, couldn't stop eating this dish.  I did as other people suggested and reduced the chicken broth a bit, and I also didn't add the shrimp since we have people allergic to shellfish, but it was AMAZING. And I had enough to keep eating it for days.  By far my favorite recipe to date.

This was very good. I made the mistake of adding cooked okra to the finished gumbo. This wasn't in the recipe, but I like okra, and thought it would be good. Unfortunately, it made the gumbo way too thick. I had to use some chicken broth to thin it out some, and then it was fine. I will definitely make this again.

Great flavor from a very straight forward receipe.  I had no trouble following any of the directions and it came out great.  The only change I made was using cajun sausage instead of breakfast.  The meat is all added at the end so it would be very easy to add whatever kind you wanted.  Great receipe!

Good but spicy. My 4 year old still ate it (pretty impressive)! I made some additions/subtractions based on other reviews. I replaced the beer w/ beef broth and left out the red chiles. Used mild Rotel for the tomatoes w/ chiles. Made my own cajun seasoning w/o salt given the complaints by others about saltiness. Doubled the chicken and andouille sausage and left out the shrimp. Only used 2/3 of the called for amount of chicken broth (still soupy so I'll use even less next time...) All in all - a good gumbo!

This gumbo is so good -- I must admit that I've been eating it for breakfast as well as for lunch and dinner since I made it.  I made one substitution: cajun sausage for the pork links.  I ended up using only 1/4 of the roux the recipe calls for, which makes the soup slightly thickened with a lot of flavor. Good news is the gumbo is delicious and I have roux leftover for the next batch.

This gumbo was soupier than my husband likes, next time I will try a little more flour in the roux. I doubled the meat and added a ham bone out of the freezer while simmering.  I used ½ Essence of Emeril & ½ Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. I also added 2 jalapenos…my husband still wanted hotter; I thought it was just right. I will make this again...great recipe!!!

Time intensive, but worth it. I cut back on the chicken broth and it ended up being the perfect consistency. Love the cajun seasoning, perhaps 1/4 cup still wasn't enough?!

I made this for the my co-workers and everyone thought it was great. I received so many compliments on the taste. I picked up fresh ingredients at our local market, which really gave it a great taste. This was the first time I made gumbo, but I can see myself making it again!

Loved this!  It was the best gumbo I've ever had.  Increased the shrimp, chicken, and sausage amounts like the others and also reduced the chicken broth.  Yummy!  My husband has requested this for his next poker night!

I am a stranger to the whole gumbo scene so I made this recipe exactly as written for home and work for "Fat Tuesday". It was one of the best soup recipes I have ever had. So flavorful. Everything that was added helped to create a flavorful masterpiece. I thought that the recipe was a bit watery, but I read that it should be served with rice. When I mixed them together, it was prefect. I have made a lot of different types of soups and stews but this one is definitely one of the best. Everyone at work asked for the recipe as well. I might try adding more seafood next time as the recipe owner suggested in another review, but I have to say it is just fine the way that it is.

Fed a crowd!  I made this for a New Year's Day party & it was a hit!  Rich, flavorful, & hearty.  I made the roux with vegetable oil instead of Olive Oil.  I wasn't sure Olive Oil would work...I made some substitutions per other reviewers...bell pepper for chile peppers, one can tomatoes for fresh Roma tomatoes, and Chappel Hill smoked sausage.  I also served with traditional Gumbo File after it was finished cooking.  I reduced the liquid as well. I did approximately 1 1/2 times the recipe & used about 6 cups broth plus one 12 oz dark beer.  Wow!  I'll definitely make this again!

This gumbo did not taste the way I expected, so initially I was a little disappointed. But the more I ate (and there was a lot to eat), I began to appreciate the rich hearty flavor. Great comfort food. And the pepper gave it a really nice kick. If I make it again, however, I may try it without the beer and use a seafood stock instead.

This recipe is awesome and I have had to share it with the girls I work with.  I had gumbo made by a Cajun friend of mine and it could not compare.  I leave out okra too (slimy... yuck) and due to sheer laziness use crushed red pepper in much less proportions instead of fresh red chile pepper and it comes out just fine... but be careful or it will be too spicy!  Great recipe!!!

Maybe I did something wrong, but this Gumbo was almost nuclear in terms of heat--  be careful adding the 1/4 cup.  I like hot foods, but this was a bit much.  I used Emeril's creole seasoning.  The roux was nice, overall the sauce looked great, but I should have cut down on the spice.  Still give it 4 stars because I think a Spicy Gumbo lover would have thought this was the bomb.

My family loved this, however it was a bit too spicey for me, but I still enjoyed the flavors. I used 2 quarts of chicken broth as recommended by other reviewers and I think the amount was just right. And I added some okra.

I had never tasted Gumbo, so I had no idea how this recipe "should" taste. 
That said, this recipe produced something quite delicious! It was a little bit salty, I think next time I will use less cajun seasoning, but it was still really, really good. 
THank you, thank you, thank you!

We live in an ethnic neighborhood, so Cajun seasoning is hard to come by. However, we had the right ingredients for the "Cajun Seasoning in a Jar" which was a beautiful blend of flavors for this gumbo. The gumbo thickened well, had the right amount of vegetables and meat, and  if you don't mind the chopping, fun to cook.

Great recipe.  Made it exactly as it says. But I would scale back on the celery.  Use 4 stalks instead of 6.

This is an excellent recipe, flavorful and spicy without setting your mouth on fire.  I don't like too hot, just full of flavor. This does it.  I only have one problem, doesn't call for okra. I added that myself. :)

Fabulous!! A Super Bowl party hit - thanks for the great recipe.  I added okra and crab meat, otherwise followed the recipe.  I have not made gumbo so I was not sure if I was supposed to skim the fat off the top or not?  I did and it was still great.  Thanks.

I sort of made this my own, I added 1 1/2 C of okra, lots of crab, 2lbs of shrimp about 70oz of chix broth, 4 buillion cubes, 1 green bell pepper and tons of spices.  Very good!  We served over rice

I really enjoyed the gumbo, but have concerns about when to add the shrimp. I added about 20 minutes before cooking, and still they came out rubbery. The beer was excellent, but I needed some more spice. But my guests thought it was the perfect heat. I'm just a glutton for pain.

This is a great dish. I love spicy food, but my wife and kids aren't too tolerant of the heat so I modified for them, and it will still great. I recommend it to anyone.

Like some of the others who posted reviews, I have never made gumbo.  I am thinking that this recipe is very forgiving because I am not certain that I used the correct amount of chicken broth and I didn't have the right amount of cajun seasoning so I used some Old Bay.  I also added some crabmeat and oysters and extra tomatoes (diced, from a can) and it was soooo wonderful.  Delicious.  Perfection.  This goes in the permanent file!

I liked this about four stars worth but I'm giving it five because I took it to a party where it got rave reviews.  I made it just a little too spicy for me.

I cooked the roux for over an hour before it got a nice dark brown.  Patience is key.  Also, I made changes based on what I had on hand...no shrimp, extra chicken, some leftover ham, those little smoked sausage wienies and crushed red pepper instead of fresh.  It is a wonderful recipe for using what is available!

Having grown up in the south along the Gulf coast, I have had many different gumbos, but this is the best I have ever had.  It's very tasty, filling and great for a large group.

Time consuming, but delicious! Quite spicy. I added the shrimp too soon and they shrunk and got too chewy but it was otherwise great.

Absolutely incredible. This was just packed with flavour. I omitted the shrimp (hubby hates it) and added about 3 cups of tiny bay scallops. I also used chopped boneless thighs instead of breasts, and all canned tomatoes. We're going camping in 2 days and I'm going to make this over the campfire with the fish we catch. It's that easy.

This was the first time I've made a gumbo and I was very happy with the result.  The flavors blended beautifully. As suggested by other reviewers, I did reduce the broth.  A wonderful meal for mid-winter in Maine!

This is totally awesome!!!!!
The grocery store didn't have the sausage so I used hot and spicy kielbasa. Served over rice this was delicious. Next time I wont use quite as much cajun seasoning as it was a little spicy. I also used about 18 oz. of miller lite beer.

This was great and pleasantly spicy. I made gumbo ahead in crock pot, up to adding shrimp and then refrigerated. Used Emeril's Kicked Up Sausage instead of pork sausage links; also reduced the amount of broth to 3 (14 oz.) cans.  Might add okra next time. Evrne liked it; good dish for a crowd.

What can I say?  It was like being back near Cajun country again!  I will never have to settle for a box mix gumbo again.  The only suggestion I can make is to boil the chicken so its a little more "shreddy".

Worth the effort! I've made this several times, adding okra and rice on occasion. I've substitued canned tomatoes when I didn't have fresh. No change. If you're adding rice, reduce the flour some so you don't end up with a solid mass.

It may not be a "true" gumbo but it is really wonderful and we have enjoyed it many times

It was spicy and delicious, but a little watery. I would probably cut the chicken broth down to 2 quarts and add a little more meat/shrimp. It also took a lot longer to cook than stated. I think it's a good base for people who can't ever follow a recipe word for word like me.

I just made this delicious gumbo for 35 people-  it was a huge success!  I did however leave out the sausage and add more chicken and more shrimp.  This recipe is easy and worth every minute of prep. and cook time!  Thanks!

This was really good. I took the advice of others and cut down some on the broth. After cooking for over an hour the celery & onions still weren't done so will precook in microwave the next time. I added okra (which is a requirement for gumbo) and more chicken, used 13 oz. Cajun style Andouilles sausage & 2 lb. shrimp. Will definitely make again!

Made this yesterday for a friends birthday and everyone couldn't get enough of it.  The only thing I changed was I cut the chicken broth back to two qts.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Just delicious! I added a 10 oz. box okra, 1/4 C Worcestershire sauce, extra shrimp. At end of cooking time, added about 1/2 C minute rice because it was a little thinner than we like. You could customize this to suit yourself. A real warmer-upper on a cold winter night!
