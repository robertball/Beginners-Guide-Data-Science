I made this two weekends in a row, it's very good.  The only thing I changed was I added barbecue mesquite seasoning and five spice powder and cooked it over coals with mesquite wood.  But he's correct, if you have the salt, sugar and the vinegar (I used rice wine vinegar), then you can add any seasonings that you want.
