The burgers were ok, but I think the tomato paste was to much for me. I might try them without the paste next time.

These burgers were fantastic!!  I served them at a BBQ I was having and everyone raved about them.  I used jalapeños in the jar and a little more garlic than the recipe called for and they turned out sooo good.  Definitely will be making them again.

I really liked this recipe. It is easy to make and tasted really good.  I would have like a little more spice and so will put in more jalapeno peppers and maybe add some chillies but will def make again.  Thanks

I loved the flavors of the burgers.  I topped them with cheddar cheese which took away a little from the flavor but they were still a big hit!

We make these all the time...but a variation.  The way I make them is hamburger (the higher fat content beef grills best, but we use a lean, organic beef), habanero chiles, diced white onion, cilantro, and ground sea salt.

I do it all to sight/taste...we like a lot of heat, and lots of cilantro and onion.

We love these burgers...I came up with our variation based on the "Mexicali Burgers" at Burgers and Beer in Yuma, AZ.  We serve them on buns brushed with a little butter or mayonnaise and then grilled.

Yum.  I did change this a some.  I used ground turkey instead of ground meat.  I left out the cilantro.  4 tablespoon of any seasoning seemed like way too much for me.  I used 1 tablespoon of greek seasoning.  I think even if I used Cajun seasoning I still would have only used 1 tablespoon.  This was great for a low cal hamburger.  If you use jalapenos from a jar you need to use less. Jarred jalapenos have the seeds mixed in which causes the fire reviewers are discribing.  If you use fresh and seed them you could eat as many as you want. Thanks Melissa P

We enjoyed these very much.  I cut back on the jalapeño pepper (I used the kind from a jar) and the cajun seasoning by about half and still found it had quite a kick.  I can't imagine it full strength!  My mouth was on fire.

I made a few substitutions for what we had on hand, and really enjoyed these burgers.  I substituted 2 serrano chilis for the jalapenos and did not have any cajun seasoning so left that out.  Also left out the tomato paste. I added pepper to the mix before making the burgers, and salted them after they were cooked.  Had no problems with the burgers not staying together.  My husband cooked them in the cast iron skillet starting with a little butter in the pan.  We ate them without buns, no condiments, and just  a little salt, with jalapeno flavored dill pickle spears on the side.  Very tasty.

These were good and moist, but did not have the spicy flavor I expected. They also fell apart easily while grilling.

My husband liked it and I did too. We had it all doctored up with the standard buns, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and ketchup. Boy it was good. But....... Here we go... I tried a piece of the hamburger by itself and was not impressed at all.

I didn't think that these had a whole lot of flavor compared to regular burgers.  Maybe it was because I scrapped the jalapeno seeds out, which is where the heat is.

This was so simple to make and it was DELICIOUS! i am a college student living on my own and I cannot cook at all. but this has many simple ingredients and i only spent around $5. I used regular sandwich bread because that was all i had in my apartment. Great recipe! I also added onion to the meat. I will definitely be doing this again for myself and family to impress them!

I just tried this recipe with modifications and it came out great. I increased the amount of garlic and left out the cilantro. I used fresh garlic and fresh home grown jalepenos. The tomato paste didn't sound appetizing so I used 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce instead. I used a recipe for Cajun spice mix submitted by Bobbie Jean  on allrecipes. I topped it all off with a slice of swiss cheese. I will definitely make this again.

These hamburgers were awesome!! My husband said they were the best he’s ever had!!! I didn’t have any tomato paste so I used a some ketchup, and I roasted the jalapeños in my oven then let them cool before putting them in the ground beef.

Really good flavour. Tomato paste and jalapeños give a good taste, but the burgers seemed to call apart easily on the BBQ. Next time I make these, I'll try adding some egg in hopes of it staying together easier.

Made the exactly as called for in the recipe and loved them.  You definitely have to like jalapenos to enjoy this recipe.  They are very good with a slice of cheese too!
