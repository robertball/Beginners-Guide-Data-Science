I've been making this recipe for years. I do not add the soup but I do add taco seasoning to the meat while cooking. Served at Christmas party and everyone loved it.

**Firt of all the mushroom soup is used so the cheese dip stays creamy and doesn't clump!** I didn't give this 5 stars because the ground up beef doesn't add any flavor. I use Owens sausage, sometimes I use hot and sometimes I use maple flavor sausage. Sounds funny but it really adds a great flavor. I brown up the sausage like the ground beef. Takes a little effort but worth it. Also I suggest using salf free chips or reduced salt because I think regular chips and the dip make it way too salty.

Though this recipe does sound good, I do have a recipe that is simular to this...  Since I am not crazy about mushrooms, and my stomach can only handle not too spicy things (lucky me, lol), I had a friend years ago that had giving me a simular recipe to this, but she put in a can of tomato soup, the hamburger, and velveta cheese...  Though, because of the cheese, and the chips, this can sometimes it can be a little salty.  Overall, depending if you like mushroom soup, you could probable try just about any kind of soup for this recipe... very tasty,

I've been making this recipe for years without the soup.  I also use shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese and it still turns out great.  I usually brown the ground beef in a skillet, drain and then add the other ingredients until the cheese melts then I transfer to a crockpot to keep warm.  It is always a big hit.

This is the base for a recipe I got quite awhile ago from a crockpot recipe book.   A few extras:  1/4 cu butter  2 Tbsp chili powder  1 can of beans 1/4 cu of corn  People love this recipe, and I've given it out quite a few times. Flavors work just as well if you

My family has been making this for years and everybody loves it! It is always a hit at parties. Quick, easy, and creamy cheese dip. Keeps well in a crock pot during a party.

Awssssssssooome!! I made this to day for the super bowl game party. I didn't use the soup; I used 1 cup of mild salsa and 1 cup of medium salsa to give it a little kick. I just couldn't let it alone it was so good. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing with =) =)

This was such a BIG HIT that I've made it over and over again.   I used Ground Chicken because I do not eat Beef and everyone ate it up regardless. It's becoming my favourite recipe for appetizer. Thanks for sharing. Toni from Maberly Ontario

This recipe was a hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe and there were no leftovers.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I added 1 TBL chili powder, 1 can black beans, 1 cup corn, and substituted spicy sausage for ground beef.  I will be making it again and again.  It's very quick and easy, and tastes great, too!
