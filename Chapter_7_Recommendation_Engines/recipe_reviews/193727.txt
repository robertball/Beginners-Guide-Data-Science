This is the only casserole I will eat or make.  I love it just as it is or after adding shredded cheddar cheese, sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms, and/or celery.

I'd like to start out by saying that I prefer this recipe over Campbell's version on this site. Although I'm only rating this a four, it's definitely my favorite green bean casserole and I'd rate it a 4.5 if that rating was available! I think next time I might splurge on half and half instead of milk since the milk really diluted the flavor of the sauce so that might make it a five star recipe! I added sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions to this recipe and used a certain brand of green beans that seems to produce the highest quality frozen vegetables!

I love making this. I'm not a huge green bean fan, at least not frozen they always seem a little tough or rubbery on the outside after cooking so I use canned french cut green beans, my kids will only eat it this way and so will I. This is a staple at our holiday table.

The reviewer that called this classic, is absolutely right. I was looking for a good side dish for some grilled pork chops, and this fit the bill. I had to make one substitution; I only had enough French Fried Onions for the topping, so I added an envelope of onion soup mix and it did the trick. My wife said it was just a little too salty, but she still thought it was good. A half envelope of the soup mix would be just about right. It really adds some zip to the recipe. As others have noted, I too prefer canned green beans to frozen. I do not like the texture of frozen green beans in this casserole.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I think my husband enjoyed it even more with the french fried onions mixed in and sprinkled on top.  He loves french fried onions.  It was a break from the green bean casseroles that are usually made with sour cream.  He does not like sour cream.  I made it exactly as directed and it turned out really good!

when isn't green bean casserole good? what i love about this is that it's so flavorful on it's own that you don't even need to add salt and pepper. i could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. i just used canned green beans (no salt added) and i actually prefer that over fresh ones.

This was delicious!  I was craving green bean casserole and this hit the spot!  My recommendations: buy the large can of onion strings and add 1 C to the mix and then the rest on the top (when there is only 5 mintues left to bake), use 2 cans of drained green beans and ONLY 1/3 C of milk (if I would have used more than that it would have been very, VERY soupy).  Also, I used fat free mushroom soup and it was perfect! Can't wait to make this again!

Great casserole, made this last week for friends because it had been many years since we all had French's Green Bean Casserole. It was the highlight of the meal. It is a classic! Yummy too!

I've made some good bean Casseroles the last few holidays, with bacon, cheese, extra sauce...  BUT this Easter I figured, well I guess this time I'll do the old fashioned original recipe.  My brother(19) said it was the best he's ever had, and he's just not that type.  My mom just said "Your Magic."  Thanks!
