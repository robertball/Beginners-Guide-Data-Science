For the reviewers that had difficulty I need to edit this recipe to say that the butter should be MELTED and "brushed" into the muffin tins, didnt realize I forgot that part until now! That COULD be one reason, also I would say you need to cook longer so they dont fall, that is when I have my biggest issues...we recently moved and our new oven cooks much slower than our previous house so when I make these I have to cook them longer than usual. Good luck! And I only use white flour for these, not sure if you are using a different type?

This is the best and easy recipe ever.  I followed all the directions and these popovers came out just right, nice and crispy on the outside, fully cooked and soft on the inside.  These were better than any restaurant popovers we ever tried, and we tried lots of them.  Do make sure you butter the inside of the muffin tins with the melted butter.  Highly recommend this recipe!!!

I've never tried a better popover recipe.  They rise up like little chef's hats.  They are crunchy on the outside and smooth on the inside.  Easy to make, too!  This is now my standard recipe for popovers!

2 eggs are sufficient.  Also, bake for 15 minutes in a hot oven (475 degrees), then lower oven to 350 degrees for 20 minutes.
Popovers remain crispy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside, and do not collapse.  Using a popover pan is important.

I tried these all though easy they do not keep there puffed shape they fall quickly but they are soft & good I cooked for 40 min to get golden color there more like a soft bisquits & good with cinnamon honey butter. But for a pop over I wouldn't do again I like them to stay puffed & crunchy on outside & soft inside..theses ones are just soft.

Not sure how my result is so radically different than the other 6 reviewers, but boy was it!  Dense, didn't rise so much as a centimeter, and were VERY eggy- like spoon bread! :(  

I am a very careful measurer, and am very attentive to temperature and all baking aspects.  Maybe I literally "babied" these to much...  I will give these another try, and maybe not be so "A.R." about every part of the process.  

If anyone sees what I did wrong- PLEASE let me know!!  I'd love to have your experience as my own!

This is my first time making popovers. While they did fall (no, I didn't open the oven door), they still tasted like the ones I've eaten elsewhere. I made some strawberry butter for them and enjoyed them for breakfast.

This was my first time making popovers... and eating one for that matter. The recipe came together very easily. My popovers did fall, not sure why. It had an eggy taste to it but it wasn't overpowering.

To keep them from falling... Eggs and milk need to be at room temperature .  No!!! Eggs and milk will Not spoil. 
And... Add butter to your egg and milk mixture.. Spray your warm muffin tin with non stick spray... Do not use butter spray... It's gross and full of artificial fat and stuff

I make popover  all the time.  The secret to both rise and stability is heat!  Increase the oven temp to 450Â° F.   This means putting the buttered (empty ) pan in the preheated oven for just a few minutes (until the butter starts to smoke) and reducing the cooking time to 15 - 20 minutes.  The popovers are done when they're golden brown.

Could the issue of popovers falling be due to not using a popover pan vs  reg muffin? I'm going to make  these today, we'll see. I rated it because otherwise I could not post my question....
