I have made this dish lots of times and my family loves it.  A key ingredient that is not listed is Lawry's Seasoned Pepper.(I use it instead of regular peppper) If you use it, I promise you will never go back to regular black pepper, I can hardly cook anything without it!  Instead of chopping an onion I use a very large yellow sweet onion which I cut in thin strips.  I cook it first for several minutes then add other ingredients.  I have been buying the sausage that comes without any casing.  I cut into very small pieces.  I also use olive oil instead of butter.

I pretty much made this according to the recipe.  Just browned the sausage a little more (because we like it like that) and skipped the msg. The family said to put this into heavy rotation because they loved it. This was quick and easy so dinner was ready in a snap.

This was a simple, but very delicious dish, even without of the MSG.

I served it with rice and it made a complete meal.  Great for a busy weeknight!

This is a good recipe,
For THOSE who won't or don't use MSG, the best part of being a versatile cook is to add to, or eliminate certain ingredients and make it your own.
We all have different tastes, so you diversify to your liking.
A great chef, Nick Stellino taught me that in his recipes and books.  
His motto,  Make it according to the recipe the first time, then make it the way you like it......
Take out the MSG, add the Seasoned salt, some garlic, and go for the gusto.
Gook basic recipe, for a simple dish.  Thanks

the first time I made it I took it to work for a potluck social.  I put it in a crock pot to cook, i put the smoked sausage, peppers, and onions and butter in the cook on low for 2 hours then added the corn.  The smell coming out of my office had everyone commenting when they came in our hallway. It was one of the first to go, didn't add the MSG (it gives me a headache) and I used turkey smoked sausage.  It was wonderful.

I took this dish to a BBQ and everyone really loved it!  I started by adding very small diced sweet potatos, sauteing them until tender, then adding the other ingredients.  I also added about a teaspoon of poultry seasining and a tablespoon of dried thyme.  I cut my sausage very thinly and halved, as I was serving this as a side.  Very delicious and different.  Thanks for a great recipe, Dennis!

This was incredible.  I tossed it with Ramen noodles (chicken flavor) and my family LOVED it.  Cheap, easy and yummy.  It doesn't get much better than that!

This was very good.  I gave 4 stars as I think that I will improve on it next time.  I got the idea of morphing it into a deconstructed shrimp boil.  Next time will add some shrimp and a can of drained diced tomatoes.  Perhaps with a little chicken broth and old bay and crusty bread for dipping into the juices.  Great recipe to get you started customizing!

Making this recipe now. But substituting olive oil for butter and no MSG to make it healthier.  I use turkey smoked sausage as well.  Making with corn cut off the cob would be even better. Will do this in the summer when fresh corn comes in!

This was ok as written, but I think that many of the seasonings are overkill.  I did not have green or red bell peppers, so I used orange bell pepper and zucchini because I had that on hand.  I used one clove of garlic in place of the garlic powder and did not add the onion powder, since this already had fresh onion in it.  I omitted the MSG.  I doubled the black pepper.  I served this over white rice.  Next time, I will try it with the red and green pepper, omit the seasoning salt, replace the garlic powder with fresh garlic, omit the onion powder and MSG and use 1/2 t. of black pepper.

This is a very good and very easy to make meal... The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I don't use MSG to flavor food. I'm am terribly allergic to MSG. So, I had to slightly increase the the amount of natural season salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. To add a little more flavor I used a pepper blend instead of black pepper. One thing I'll pass along however. The next time I make this dish I'm going to brown the sausage pieces by themselves not with the peppers and onions. All of the moisture in the peppers and onions prevented the sausage from browning (I think the crunchy texture of the fried sausage will add to the flavor and texture of the dish). Finally, The recipe calls for cooking the sausage and onions and peppers until hot 1 to 2 minutes. It took about 8 or 9 minutes to get them hot in my wok. I've added this to my recipe box and it is definitely a keeper.

I have to admit, after it was done in the skillet, I didn't think I'd like it. But it's really tasty! I followed the recipe exactly (including the Accent) except for leaving the onion powder out, because I didn't have it, but I don't think it's necessary at all.  I did cook the onion and peppers longer than called for, mostly because I underestimated the amount of time cutting would take.  I served it over rice.  This is a really good recipe as-is!

We really loved this. I was skeptical veggies and lean meat (I did sub some chicken sausage I had on hand) with just a couple tbsp butter could be this satisfying (without say, bacon or a rich sauce). I ended up just seasoning with the seasoning salt for us. I think this would be well-suited to any precooked meat, say leftover grilled chicken or steak or chopped up rotisserie chicken. I will for sure make this quick, healthy, flexible meal again - thanks so much for sharing!

This is the night before our monthly shopping trip (I'm a stocker) and I have three teenage boys to feed. I had one pack of smokes sausage, peas, and beans. Thank you, Allrecipes for saving the day! Again!
I didn't have an onion so I used dried and added it to the butter right off. I also cut the amount of pepper for my picky eater. So just butter, minced garlic, and half a pepper. Threw in the sausage and browned it. Then added the frozen corn. Threw on a healthy bit of Zatarans Creole seasoning (which is like season salt kicked up a few notches) and let the corn get done. So let's see....$2 sausage from ALDI. Maybe $3 in corn. Plus seasoning. Quick and yummy. Jackpot!!!!

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious!!! I made it in under 30 minutes.  I did brown my turkey saugage 1st to and then added the veggies.  I also added canned diced tomatoes to make it more savory and seassoned to taste (omitting the msg).  I also added ~1 tbsp of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoe based.  Delicious!!!!

This was a fabulouse and fast dish!  The only changes I made were omitting the seasoned salt,  msg and red peppers.  I substituted the garlic powder with real minced garlic and sprinkled the mixture with salt, pepper and dried parsley and served it with southern fried potatoes.  YUM YUM YUM!!  I will make this again.

This is a great recipe for busy families. I changed this just a bit - like most, I omitted the MSG. I substituted turkey sausage and browned that first before adding the peppers and onions. I decided to get the rice cooker out and put the sausage mixture over rice. Unfortunately, that made it kind of bland for me. My DH loves spicy dishes so he added hot sauce and was happy. I am not that spicy, so I microwaved some Monterey cheese over everything and it was great. Perhaps next time I'll add a bit more spice to it, but I'm definitely going to make this again!!

I have made this dish or a variation of this dish 2 times now. The first time I followed the recipe pretty closely - just left out the MSG.  The 2nd time, I added LOTS of paprika, seasoning salt, and cayenne pepper. These spices made it super yummy! We also use turkey smoked sausage-fewer calories and you can't taste the difference with all the spicy flavor.

I agree with most of the other reviewers here.  Fresh garlic is good, serve over rice or noodles if its the main dish.  MSG... I've made it with and without and it is MUCH better with.  Don't get caught up in the old wive's tales about it, there is ZERO scientific evidence that there is anything wrong with it or that people have sensitivities (people react equally to the placebo when they 'think' they've had MSG) and in many cases it is a much healthier alternative to regular table salt.

Good, but nothing spectacular. I don't think you will be disappointed if you make it, but I don't know if I will make it again...I just feel that there are other dishes that I'd rather eat, if that makes sense. Again, it was not bad at all, it is weird to say because it was "satisfying" but just didn't have anything special about it.

I used a slow cooker with this.  Cooked all except corn for 2hrs 45 minutes, then added corn.  I prepared a box of spanish rice and threw that in about 3hrs in, and served after 3hrs 30 minutes time, and was a hit at the house.  Served with a side of biscuits.  Gunna bake corn bread to go with it next time.

3.5 stars.  Very colorful. But just ok. I would make again if I'm pinched for time and need to throw something quick together out of the freezer. For family only. I'd never serve this to company. I found the butter made it to greasy. If I make again i'll use olive oil and up the spices a bit more.  It's certainly an inexpensive meal to make if you have a family to feed................I made this again with light changes. The biggest, left out the butter, and used cooking spray. I added garlic, zucchini, double seasoning salt, plus a few drops of liquid smoke.  I also used turkey sausage.  We enjoyed it much more without grease from butter. Very good base recipe.

Very good. I did use EVOO instead of butter as someone recommended and also used turkey smoked sausage. Served it over brown rice, YUMMY! Will be making this one again.

this recipe sounds great, and I will try it, but I would encourage readers not to include the MSG, as so many people (including myself) are extremely sensitive to MSG and as far as I can see, MSG has no use in this recipe, nor in most.

I loved this and it really only took 20 minutes to throw together.  I followed the recipe just as is except added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Even my 5yo and 2yo kids loved it.  This is going in our monthly rotation for sure.

Fantastic recipe.  Very easy, but delicious.  Just a few alterations, since have allergies to MSG, omitted it and instead used Garlic salt and red pepper flakes.   Cut down on the amount of frozen corn as well & used only 3/4 of a bag and used Olive Oil instead of butter.  

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe with us.

I did change this a bit, but it was SO good!  I started out by panfrying cubed potatoes in a bit of olive oil and butter, as though starting homefries.  I added the onion & peppers, and some minced garlic (used the bottled kind that I reconstituted with water before adding), fried a bit more, and then covered the pan to let the potatoes soften (probably at least 10 minutes if not more) before adding the sliced sausage.  Once the sausauge was a bit browned, I threw about half a bag of frozen supersweet corn in - I cut down because we had the potatoes as well.  Gave it the last 7 minutes still covered to cook the corn, added ground pepper and seasoned salt.  My husband is taking the leftovers for lunch tomorrow and said he really liked it.  As I'm still in the habit of cooking for 4, even though oldest daughter has gone off to college, I used 2 smoked sausage links (2 lbs.), so it was way too much for the 3 of us.

AMAZING!! This will be on a permanent rotation in my household. You MUST try this over savory grits. Boil the grits in chicken broth instead of water and top with the corn sausage mixture. My husband and I could not get enough. Instead of MSG I used half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of sugar. Used andouille chicken sausage for a little kick. Can not rave about this meal enough.

Really good! the corn adds a nice sweetness to the dish.  I hate to be "that guy" that posts reviews but then say I changed it... but I do add a little (tsp. to tbsp.) crushed red pepper for a little spice, and definitely omit the MSG. I also add a little soy sauce and water whisked with a little corn starch for a little bit of sauce. We usually serve over rice, also have done it over noodles. The whole family loves it, great base recipe, definitely in the dinner rotation! Thanks for the recipe :)

I just made this, with minor modification, and loved it. I didn't have any bell pepper, so left that out. No MSG either. Also, I got the sausage browned before adding the other ingredients. Surprised how yummy this was! I will make it again for sure. So simple, but a great dish!

I had all the ingredients so threw this together.  It was very good.  I did not use the MSG as that is a no-no in our house.  I only used an orange pepper as that is what I had. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cajun seasoning and it was perfect.

This was a surprisingly good recipe!  I needed something simple and fast for dinner tonight and I had all the ingredients on hand for this dish, so I thought I'd try it.  I have to admit, as I was making it, it didn't seem like a dish I would like... but I was wrong, it was very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly (minus the MSG).  This would go really well with some onion-roasted diced potatoes, which I plan to try next time I make this!  Sadly, my two (somewhat picky) little girls were not fans of this recipe so I won't make it as often as I'd like, but this is definitely a keeper - hopefully they will learn to like it!

My whole family liked this recipe.  I dont care for fresh peppers, but I had a can of corn w/ diced peppers which worked really well.  I did forget the accent but I dont think its good for us anyway ? and still loved the recipe. We liked it with chicken flavor rice (all I had).

You have an excellent recipe.  However, I made a few personal changes.  I roasted my corn in their husks that were also soaked in salt water and just before grilling coated the corn with an infused butter that had freshly ground garlic (use a lemon zester tool) and salt and pepper...  I also omitted the MSG...there is no reason to even think that this recipe needs enhancement....

I didn' think I would like this, but it was very good. Made to the directions. Too Too much season salt. I would salt to taste. Nice combination of spices. Will make again and leave out the season salt. I also used MSG

This was quick and easy and very yummy. My fiance and I both just raved on it. I'll definitely make this a regular dish. I did not used the MSG nor the seasoned salt, but used regular salt instead along with a 1/2 teaspoon of cilantro. Very yummy.

Huge hit!  I used Emeril's Cajun seasoning and no seasoned salt or msg.  Didn't have enough corn and I think that was a really yummy part of it, so we'll make sure there's enough of that next time.  Even the toddlers ate it!

This is one of those great comfort food recipe's...use your meat of choice and seasonings to match...the corn and peppers just make it extra tasty...and butter is right up there with baseball and applepie :)

This was a good, quick meal.  I did have to make a few changes based on what I had on hand: smoked turkey sausage, 2 green bell peppers and no MSG.  This did seem to be missing something, though I can't put my finger on what exactly.  Still, I'd make this again when I need a quick meal.

I love this. I grew up with this. we added diced potatoes and sometimes served it in a pie crust or stuffed in a pig stomach and baked. I don't see the need for the MSG as you add seasoned salt and the smoked sausage is also flavorful.

This was really good!  The only changes I made was to leave out the MSG, and use olive oil instead of butter.  It was a little salty, so next time I think I'll reduce the seasoned salt.  My family gobbled it up!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but must admit, we loved it. I used canned corn and ommitted the msg. I also followed another users advice and added Lawrey's Seasoned Pepper. I will definitly be making this again.

Very good for being so easy. I use red and orange pepper (instead of green) and added a splash of worchestershire instead of msg. Had a good flavor and even the kids ate it up.

Very good for such an easy, quick, and inexpensive dinner.  I served it with some Ore Ida french fries on the side and it was a very filling meal.  I think it cost about $5 to prepare the recipe if you have the spices on hand (and they are common ones).

This was a pretty good recipe. Used low fat sausage and added seasoned pepper.  Next time I make this I am going to try to add some rice to try to make it more of a filling meal rather than a side dish.  Must try this recipe, very quick and easy.

Good recipe. I just leave out the MSG. No reason not to make it because the recipe calls for it. A person can always leave out any ingredient they don't care to use or are allergic, too.

Delicious. My husband said it’s a keeper.  I used kielbasa rather than smoked sausage.  Easy weeknight meal.

I made this exactly as indicated, INCLUDING the dreaded MSG (Goya Sazon)...it is excellent; and a great use of standard ingredients.  As others have mentioned, it may have a bit to much watery liquid below its surface, just asking for straining the whole thing.  Instead, I stirred-in a couple dollops of sour cream and a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese at end of cooking, which really pulled the whole thing together, both in body/texture and flavor (just my preference..stands on its own without the adds!)

I made this recipe as stated, except I left out the MSG.  I loved it, and so did my husband and three kids (ages 10, 7, & 6)!  It might be a little bit bland for some people, but it was perfect for kids who don't like their food really spicy.  It was quick and easy as well!  Will definitely make again!

Very flavorful and easy! I left out the MSG, for personal preference. The sweetness of the corn is a great counter to the peppers. Will definitely make this again!

Just whipped it up exactly as written but omitting the MSG in my opinion its not a good ingredient health-wise for any recipe. This recipe is simple and contains ingredients most of us seasoned cooks have as staples. It's Yummy & I know my husband will love it as his Superbowl Supper! Thanks for contributing this I would have never thought to put corn into this recipe but it adds a lot to it as far as texture and flavor...I believe the starchiness of the corn helps to thicken up the small amount of glaze you get on this finished dish.

Easy dinner. Add a little bit of red pepper flakes for extra flavor. Try with some gourmet sausage to change it up.

This turned out more tasty than I thought it would be. Like some others, I didn't have all the exact ingredients but close enough. I fried the sausage 1st then added the veggies and seasonings. I will make this again, thank you!

Made as written. Thought it was just OK, definitely ends up with too much liquid. Would need to simmer & reduce it down a bit more to make it less "wet."

Made this pretty much as written. Used EVOO instead of butter because we were out. Used a touch of Adobo seasoned salt. Didn't use MSG. Served over rice. It was excellent. Great flavors, loved the smoked sausage. Aside from the chopping, it comes together pretty quickly. I cooked it a bit longer to make sure the vegetables weren't crunchy. Recommend!!!!

I didn’t have a green pepper, so I used red and orange and I didn’t use MSG.  It was good, but not so good that it will stick in my mind to make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of substituting an equal part of Mrs. Dash Salt-Free mix instead of the MSG.  I also used a frozen onion and pepper blend, as I was needing to do freezer clean out and found this recipe by entering the ingredients I needed to use up.  (A very hand feature of AllRecipes, by the way.)

It was delicious!  So easy from start to finish and so much flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

I Yummy!  I used mild Italian sausage and browned it first, left out the MSG and green pepper (I'm not a fan :) ), and used light olive oil instead of butter.  Served over roasted potatoes.  It was very filling, but delicious!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I always use sausage that is half pork and beef, which adds a very good meaty flavor. I doubled the seasoning salt and garlic, because that's the way we like it. Easy, peasy...Good weeknight meal.

Another recipe found by ingredients to clean out the veggie drawer.  After reading the other reviews I added diced tomatoes.  I liked the idea of serving over rice so I wanted a bit more liquid.  I started with half a cup of beef broth in the pan.  I added a couple tbs of flour to another half cup of broth and added near the end of cooking.  For spices I used cayenne, smoked paprika, sea salt, red pepper, and a mixed pepper blend.  I left out the garlic by accident.  It will go in next time.  Hubby suggested trading the sea salt for some diced jalapeños.  This recipe is a keeper.  I always read the reviews so rarely follow the original recipe to the letter.  Even so, this turned out perfect and gets five stars.

Made this tonight.  We were out of frozen corn so I used canned corn, drained.  Used all green pepper, out of red.  At the suggestion of a few other reviews, I omitted the onion powder, and added diced potatoes.  The family loved it, great flavor.  Definitely in the rotation.

I made this tonight for the first time. I had some summer sausage and was so tired of beans! I searched on the Dinner Spinner for a recipe for the sausage and saw this one right away. I could not believe how easy it was to make. My husband had THREE HUGE helpings. He even passed on the chocolate cake because he was so full.

I love this stuff! It's good plain but I dress it up sometimes too. I add tater tots (already browned). Then put it on a plate or a tortilla, add cheese, an egg and salsa.  YUM!

This is a great dish. I've made it several times and my family loves it. But, I have never used the seasonings as they are all  variations of salt. The sausage  has more than enough salt.  Instead I sauté a couple of cloves of real garlic with the butter and then add  the  vegetable and sausage.  The garlic and the natural flavors make this an amazingly flavorful meal without all of the salt.

I was looking for something to do with sausage and I m so glad I found this recipe. It is so simple and easy and delicious. I did put it over rice.  I added about 1/8 tsp of liquid smoke to it when it was close to being done . Other than that I followed the recipe. This recipe could win in a contest.

One night on a busy week I went looking for a one pan meal to make and this was a winner! I added 3 chopped potatoes that I fried in olive oil.
 I used a bag of frozen roasted red,green,yellow peppers with onion.
I love it that there was only one pan to wash afterwards.  Very delicious!

This is my new favorite meal! I wanted something easy, quick & hearty for a busy weeknight. The peppers & corn were so tender & sweet and paired beautifully with the smoked sausage. Next time I will make a double batch for lunch leftovers. Hubby loved it & said make this again!

I have made this many times as written (well, w/o the msg) and it was great. Then lately I got a bit sassy w/ it and used part andouille sausage and part smoked sausage and added cajun seasoning as well. Yum. Gave it a bit of a kick. Last night, I made it ahead of time, put in crock pot on warm and went to son's bb game. Worked out well. Had more liquid than usual, but just dipped w/slotted spoon and it tasted the same. This is a great quick prep meal w/ ingredients that I always have in freezer.

I was called upon to make a side dish on short notice.  This recipe did the trick!!  Everyone loved it and there was not a drop left.  My niece even insisted on the recipe.  

I made a few changes:
Used spicy smoked beef sausage;
Omitted MSG, garlic and onion powder, used instead Lawry seasoned salt, Adobo light and black pepper;
Added yellow peppers.

I browned the sausage first, then added the veggies.

I'm already tasked with making this next month for the family gathering. Thanks for this recipe!

This was delicious! I used Creole seasoning instead of seasoned salt and MSG, and I added two diced potatoes, which I browned first, before adding the other ingredients. The family loved it and the kitchen smelled wonderful!

Started with 5 small cubed potatoes in the butter, then added the other ingredients. Everyone liked it a lot!.

Very good, quick and easy.  We did not add Accent but followed the recipe exactly.  I did think it was a little too salty (and I like salt) so next time will cut down or omit it.

It was tasty but salty and sooo greasy. Other than flavor I dont think you need the butter. The sausage has enough grease to cook the onion and bell pepper.

Excellent!  The smoked sausage really flavors the veggies!  I might be tempted to skip the corn but it was good too.  I made the "mistake" of cooking the onion and peppers first as that's what I normally do with this kind of dish.  Will not do that next time.  With the added corn and being covered, the onions and peppers were too soft for our liking.  :-)

Very good! Quick and easy, I served over white rice. I did not have a green pepper so I substituted with a yellow pepper. I will make with green pepper next time, still may use yellow. I did not use MSG, however, I did have Accent on hand so I used that. FABULOUS, will make again!

Yum!  Very colorful and the corn is a nice substitution in place of pasta.  Flavor was nice, not too bold.  Likely good in tortilla shells as well.

This is a nice recipe. I served it over white rice, and everyone liked it. I only used 1 T butter, and that was plenty. I don't use MSG, and I left out the onion powder since it had plenty of onion in it. Some red pepper flakes or hot sauce would have given it some added flavor. Thanks for a good alternative to our usual sausage, onions, peppers and potatoes.

Used mild Italian sausage (cooked first).  Came out super yummy.  Even as I finished my plate and was very full I couldn't stop thinking about having more for leftovers the next day.  Can't wait to make this again.

Pretty darn good. Cheap to make and quick. I did not use MSG but added some cajun powder (1 tsp)to add some attitude to it. Used 2 fresh cloves of garlic minced. Turned out very good. I will make this again.

I made this last night. The only changes I made were to add different spices to my taste (more garlic, more pepper, a little cayenne, some perfect pinch vegetable (about 1/2 tsp). I did not use the msg (don't have any) or the onion salt. I also added 1.5 cups of cooked rice instead of serving over something. It was definitely different and very yummy! Thank you for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I tried it as written the first time minus the MSG. Made it again with a southwestern flair while camping.Added cumin,jalapeno and grilled some smoked sausage on the grill. Also added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Really Awesome!!!

I made this with potatoes and Knorr chicken seasoning just like another reviewers said.  My family loved it!  They are asking for more.  The only thing I did not add was msg.  There's no need for it. I did not used onion and garlic powder because I used fresh ones.  I used 3 cloves and only half of onion.  I used olive oil instead of butter. Thank you!

This recipe is great. I made this for my roommates and even the one that hates peppers ate it and enjoyed it. The only alteration I had to make was to take out the MSG (as I am sensitive to it). I made rice with it and was surprised to see that the entire batch was gone within an hour

This is a fabulous recipe.  Everyone in my family, from my MUST-HAVE-MEAT husband to my 18-month-old love it.  I've made it twice in the last two weeks.  I like to cook the sausage separately so I can get it crispy and browned, and I cook the veggies longer so they're soft and sweet.  I don't use MSG.  I avoid that stuff in already made foods - no way am I adding it to a recipe.

DELICIOUS! Used olive oil instead of butter, no msg or onion powder and it turned out wonderful. Served over rice cooked with beef buillon. My 19 month old loved it and ate it all! Thank you for sharing; I will definitely be making this again. :o)

This is a great 'grub' meal. Everytime I make it, my family ooohs and ahhs. I always skip the MSG - it's oplenty seasoned without it. For an even lower cal version I use turkey smoked sausage.

Quick and simple.  I made this for lunch because I was in the mood for smoked turkey sausage.  I put it over leftover mashed potatos for a weekend lunch and the family loved it.

just okay . . . nothing special about this, but it does make a quick (ready in less than 30 minutes) weeknight meal.

Simple, quick recipe. My local store was out of red peppers, so we just used 2 green instead. I also subbed turkey smoked sausage. I think we will add more veggies next time and serve with cornbread.

Quick and simple yet good.  Used turkey sausage, left out MSG.  Loved that I didn't feel stuffed after eating it.

This dish was absolutely wonderful. I prepared it without the MSG, and added a mixture of fresh ground herbs. My entire family enjoyed it. I'm going to make it for my mom also. Very colorful.

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: I added a clove of minced garlic along with the powdered garlic (can't get enough garlic!); omitted the onion powder because I used a large chopped onion; omitted the MSG-- I don't use it, and used smoked chicken sausage because it was what I had in the freezer.  Very tasty and colorful and the minced red and green peppers were the size of the corn kernels, so it was visually very appealing.   Next time I will use olive oil and will cook the onions and peppers a bit longer to get some caramelization.   Not really sure why the recipe is called "Fried Corn", what with all the other ingredients.

This was really good! The only thing I did different was I added a small fresh chopped tomato from the garden and left out the MSG. My husband wasn't real fond of it but I really liked it. I'll definitely make it again. Its easy and fast.

this was very tasty.  I made as specified except omitting the MSG.  I added some sauteed mushrooms which only added to the flavor of the original recipe.

I wanted the corn to be the focal point of this dish because I want to use it as a side dish. So,  I used 3 12-ounce bags of frozen sweet corn, I did not increase the green or red peppers and I only used 8-ounces of smoked beef sausage, diced. I like the taste and it looks really pretty with the yellow, green and red. Quick, simple and delicious.

We really enjoyed this recipe - very easy & very tasty!  I added some chopped garlic with the veggies and cooked it all for awhile before adding the sausage.  I used a cast iron skillet & cooked it all for longer than called for so the vegetables carmelized a bit.  I also omitted the MSG.

Very tasty! Made it with yellow & red bell peppers - left the onions in bigger pieces, too. Left out the MSG. Will make again!

Very good.  I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top of the finished dish while still inside the pan, replaced the lid, and let the cheese melt. Served on top of white rice. Good, simple and quick.
