Absolutely Awesome - this stuff is so good and so chocolatey! The peppermint extract is the key here. To really get our tastebuds into over drive I topped it off with whipped cream and peppermint patties that I broke up into pieces and drizzled a little extra chocolate syrup over it.

I have tried and disliked most shakes... but this one was definitely a keeper I'll want again and again!  Just a tiny drop of mint extract is all it needed.  I used my VitaMix to blend it.  AWESOME!

For all you chocolate lovers out there, use chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla.  Its so much better.

I really liked it, but you have to be very careful with how many drops you put in of peppermint extract. I put in too much the first time, and ruined the taste of the milkshake. I recommend adding 2 drops! But other then that, I really liked it !

Yummy, yummy!  I've made this several times now, and its always a treat. My husband and 2 year-old love it too, although my husband would prefer I used chocolate ice cream. I use fat-free vanilla frozen yogurt to save a few calories and it works perfectly (and it's generally what I have on hand). I use a few drops of peppermint extract, but a little extract goes a long way! Overall, a very creamy, refreshing milkshake!

I had a tough time deciding on the score for this.  I'll admit I'm not a chocolate "freak."  However, I do generally love MINT chocolate.  I don't like chocolate ice cream because, well, it tastes *nothing* like real chocolate.  (I'd rather put syrup on vanilla ice cream.)  So this seemed like the thing cause it has mint and uses syrup instead of chocolate ice cream.  It was good, but it didn't really quite hit the spot the way I expected.  Maybe cause it's peppermint instead of just mint??

Can you actually have anything bad to say about a milkshake? What's not to like?! My kids just loved this one, but their favorite treat is a mint oreo blizzard, so I knew they would like this. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very very good. I needed to make an essay about "how to make a....". I love milkshakes so I picked it. I was looking for a good looking recipe and this was it. After I finished the essay, I made the milkshake. It was the best tasting milkshake I've ever tasted! I have a party coming up in a few weeks. I' planning to serve this delicious, good looking milkshake. For anyone who is looking for advise: If you don't love chocolate just don't put it in. You could  just put some syrup on top of it when your done, like the picture. It tastes just as good. THIS IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!

Soooo good! Perfect blend of choclateyness, mintyness, and all around awesomeness! I didn't actually measure anything so it was pure luck! I added a small handful of chocolate chips and that added the extra bit! LOVE this recipe!

We felt it turned out to be a waste of perfectly good ice cream.  We were anticipating something closer to an Andes mint type  flavor, and ended up getting just a super chocolatey rich drink. Disappointing.

This shake was fantastic! I did make just one serving instead of the two and just whisked the ingredients. It came together smoothly. I froze it and it stayed soft but hard enough to scoop into a cone the next day. I used Breyer's homemade vanilla ice cream flavor and measured the peppermint extract into the cap first as a little goes a long way with extracts. I probably only used 1/2 the extract suggested. The flavor reminded me so much of the flavored coffee drinks around the Christmas season or a chocolate version of a shamrock shake, delicious.

This was an amazing milkshake! It is absolutely perfect! One thing that might bother you, however, is the amount of peppermint extract. You have to watch how much you put in, otherwise it will get too peppermint-y.

Yummy good!  Used chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla and kept everything else the same.  Just as good as the famous shamrock shakes.

This was excellent! I did use chocolate ice cream because that's what I had, but it just made it extra chocolatey, and that's a good thing! I will be making these again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Can't go wrong with this, it totally hits the spot. I might try for a "grown up" shake and use peppermint schnapps next time I have some.

This was nothing special to me because I really don't care for the fatless sugary flavor of chocolate syrup. Something about pep extract (pure) doesn't lend a hearty mint flavor either.

I made this for dessert on Mother's Day for my mom and it was EXCELLENT!!!! I would give it more stars if I could. I never knew making a milkshake was so easy! The only change I made was that I used chocolate ice cream...it is neccessary for chocolate lovers like my mom and I. :)

This is the most basic recipe for a chocolate shake that I could find on this site. I just wanted ice cream, milk and syrup, but needed the right proportions. This one is perfect. No extra bits or powders required!

Tried it, just as is stated.  My blender is small, so it took a bit to blend it, but the mint extract really does well here.  Was delicious, thanks for the idea!

I tried this tonight, but I added a teaspoon and a half of instant espresso. I meant to only drink half and store the rest for tomorrow, but it was so good, I had to drink it all. LOL. You can consider this a liquid dessert, it's that good.

I did not expect much from this.  I think it's excellent--better than I thought it would be.  I've had a hard time making milk shakes at home because they are usually too runny.  I followed the measurements exactly and it turned out great.  This was ice cream shop taste.  I used Bryer's all natural vanilla  ice cream and Hershey's syrup and pure peppermint extract.  I also made some minus the peppermint extract but plus coconut extract.  I much preferred the mint.  There is something very yummy and subtle about using vanilla ice cream and adding syrup to make it chocolate.  I recommend at least trying it that way even if you try it sometime with chocolate ice cream, too.  BEWARE:  my 3 and 5 year old took a few sips and then asked for "regular ice cream in a bowl"  --with chocolate syrup on top, of course!

Got mint extract when I went to the store by mistake but still turned out fabulous. Also used the store brand premium brand vanilla ice cream (the stuff that come in the 1 pint sizes).

This recipe truly is the best. I loved it. Yy kids also loved it. The only thing I have to say is that it is hard to do just a drop of the mint extract, and too much is overpowering. I also wonder if I bought the wrong extract. The bottle said peppermint and speramint. I think I should have bought only peppermint extract. The speramint flavor was a little strange to me in the milkshake.

I was really looking forward to doing this but I didn't like it very much.It was too sweet and there was no taste of the peppermint extract.However it looked really pretty with whipped cream and grated chocolate on top.

Outstanding - with and without the mint. Also outstanding with either chocolate or vanilla ice cream. My 10-year-old daughter to make these milkshakes for each of us.

To make it even better, add a bit more peppermint extract, 4 to 5 more drops, and garnish with a KitKat!

I had to compensate a bit for too much peppermint, but it actually turned out quite well. I'm definitely going to try it again!

Very good, but not enough milk to call it a milkshake imo.  A big blob of ice cream that needed to melt. Tasty though.

Instead of 4 scoops, I put 6 scoops to make it think. But i didn't use big scoops/ normal sized ones are good. and the make it a bit healthier, I used chocolate ice cream. This eliminates the need for the sauce, and I find most vanille ice cream have more fate than chocolate. i also found that adding 1/4 a cup of oreos taste really good! of course, you can add more oreos if you want. Be warned that if you put TOO MUCH oroes, it will taste too sweet. i also took away the mint flavoring.

This was an excellent recipe. I've made it three times - once as it is and twice I added chocolate mint oreos for some added texture. About 5 of them is just right.

This also works well with mint chocolate chip ice cream.  Just add the milk and blend.  Top with whipped cream!  Yummy!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe and was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't very thick, and only made about 10 ounces.  The second time, I doubled the amount of ice cream and it came out much better.  It was much thicker, but it still wasn't enough for 2 adults.
