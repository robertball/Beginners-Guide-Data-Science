This is really good. I was a bit worried about making a slow cooking french dish in 45 minutes but the flavors were very good and it was easy enough for a week night.

WOW! TRES BIEN! I made this with things I had on hand: 3 chicken breasts (1.65pd) cubed vs. thighs, 10oz Little Smokies vs. kielbasa, 1/2 cup of prepared bread crumbs (skipped making them), 2T olive oil vs. 1t, onion as stated, pre-cut carrot chips vs. diced carrots, 1cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup dry white wine, thyme leaves as stated, 2 bay leaves vs. 1, cannellini beans as stated, parsley as stated, and salt. I had to use 1T olive oil to brown the bread crumbs because they kept soaking up the oil, but they finally toasted nicely. I then used 1T oil to brown the chicken and smokies. Sauted onion and carrots in leftover meat juices and transferred all to stock pot along with the rest of the ingredients. Before serving I added 1t cornstarch mixed in tiny bit of water to thicken broth before serving, and added the parsley to the broth. I also topped with a very tiny sprinkle of white cheese before serving, along with the toasted bread crumbs. THIS IS FANTASTIC! Thanks for the post - this will be a favorite for a long time! Oui!

This recipe is SO great!  It's much easier than the traditional way of making French cassoulet, and it is so flavorful. The man who invented this recipe and submitted it to Sunset Magazine is a personal friend of mine, and he goes regularly to France to take cooking classes. Nice job, Russ!!

Yum yum yum.  That's all there really is to say!  I had to substitute regular keilbasa, as the turkey had MSG in it.  Hubby licked the plate.

We thought this was excellent, and so easy to prepare!  I substitued chicken breasts for the thighs, and fresh rosemary for the bay leaf (didn't have one).  I also used dried thyme.  I halved it since there's only two of us and next time I will make more.  Great with a loaf of crusty french bread and good, soft french cheese and wine!

My husband really liked this.  I loved the french bread crumbs, I left them big like croutons rather than blending them.  Mine turned out like a stew, had expected more of a casserole, but that was okay.

This was very good.  I made this last night, and everyone liked it.  Since we had swim practice, I cut up and cooked the chicken, sausage, onions and carrots, and then put them in the fridge so the dish could be finished when we got home.  It worked out very well - we were eating within 30 min. of getting home.  I will definately make this again.
