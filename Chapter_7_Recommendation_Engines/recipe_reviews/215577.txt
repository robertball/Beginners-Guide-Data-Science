Wonderful!  I was looking for a good recipe for either sherbet or *(preferrably) ice cream involving mint and watermelon!  Hooray!  This is very thought-out and mistake-proof!  Thank-you so much!  :D

It tastes ok. I personally don't care for the combination of mint and watermelon taste, but when I made it, it came out almost icey after being frozen. It wasn't so much of hit either with my father who is a watermelon fanatic. However, I may have made it wrong, but it was fun to see it come out red and to put in chocolate chips to make it look further like watermelon.

Watermelon and mint - two of my favorite things together in this refreshing, unique recipe. I love the fact that this ice cream is naturally infused with mint - to smell it was heavenly; I'll definitely use that technique for future mint ice creams. And because I believe chocolate makes everything better, I added in some mini morsels toward the end. Next time I'll use full-sized chips. Yum. Don't do like I did and use half and half in order to save a few calories; it was a little icy. Next time, I'll definitely go with the full on cream. Also, I think I overfilled my machine. The next day when I was making the leftover mix, that batch was much creamier.

Hope you love fresh mint!!! I personally put the whole mixture together in the fridge for about one and a half hours. It first tastes LIKE watermelon then mint.

I have made this two times...for us it was much better without the mint.  I liked it the first time but the mint was just a strange background taste.  Maybe I just don't care for fresh mint?  The recipe is a definite keeper though.  I took it to a church function and it was a hit.
