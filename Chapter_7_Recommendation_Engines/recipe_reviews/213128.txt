This is just like my Italian grandmother's recipe. The only difference is to add a dash of nutmeg, and use 2 more eggs and omit the olive oil. She also used fresh garlic and a half an onion. It's a Christmas day tradition!

This was very good. I used the larger holes on my grinder but think I'll go for the finer texture next time. I only filled enough ravioli for one meal (it was getting late) and I barely made a dent in the filling; I should have enough ravioli to freeze for several meals. Instead of garlic salt, I used fresh garlic (and salt); I also used a handful of chopped fresh parsley instead of dried. I made it with the Fresh Semolina and Egg Pasta dough recipe and served it with a vodka tomato cream sauce.

Filling is a good base to start with. I was however only able to get about 30 raviloi not 150. And I also use fresh garlic and onion. I cooked them with the ground beef. I also added some Italian seasoning.

For the last 6 months, I have been craving the Raviolis, I always ate as a child.  I had no idea how to make them.  I bought every frozen brand I could find and tried them all, but none was even close to my memories.  I tried making from scratch, but the texture was all wrong, and my dough was so thick it was disgusting!  Then my son gave me a pasta roller yesterday for Christmas, so I went online to find raviloi recipes that were made of beef and had a smoother texture.  I FOUND IT with this one!    I made a very small batch to start out and used the accompany pasta dough recipe.  They tasted just like I remembered!  I made another batch after that.  I did use some sausage as a few others recommended and the olive oil.  I am freezing most of them so I can eat them whenever I want with my fresh canned Marianna Sauce that tasted like my childhood.  That took some trail and error, but now with my sauce readily available and this recipe, I can relive one of my favorite meals as a child.  I was so excited to rate this recipe that I became a supporting member tonight. to whomever submitted this recipe, you have my deepest thanks, (but not the few lbs, I will probably gain from eating so many of them!)

Wow! This was fantastic. I have to give a caveat though. I used sausage instead of beef. Just a regular old tube of mild breakfast sausage. The recipe was perfectly sized for one recipe of pasta dough in my ravioli maker. The flavors and consistency were divine. I think I will make about 1000 of these next time and freeze them so I can eat them whenever I want. SOOOOOO GOOOOOD.

This was pretty good. put in stuffed shells and topped with homemade tomato basil sauce and mozzarella cheese. Made enough filling to do two full meals, froze the second one for another time.

Made a large batch of  this today. After reading the reviews, I too added fresh garlic, nutmeg and 1/2 a chopped onion (which was browned with the ground beef), and fresh chopped parsley.  Dough made in food processor and then run through pasta machine and put on ravioli frame. Once made, I laid them out on a cookie sheet and placed into freezer until partially frozen.  Then put into a gallon sized zip lock bag.  Served up with a Garlic Alfredo and Mushroom sauce.  Excellent!

This was delicious!  I sauteed some onions and used fresh garlic rather than garlic salt.  Yum - this will be a favorite!  We served with Spicy Vodka Sauce

I did a trial run for lunch and all I can say is WOW! This filling is so flavorful by itself the raviolis didn’t even need sauce. I followed the recipe exact, the only change was that I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs since I don’t have plain on hand. This is a really solid recipe that yields flavorful and light ravioli. Next time I will maybe add some onions as well. Thanks!

Improved recipe at the end.  Draining off the beef fat results in a dry, crumbly filling after cooking the ravioli, only drain half (if using 80% grass fed, or just use 90% lean).  Overall bland, badly needs ricotta or some other creamy cheese.  My Improved Recipe:  Add 3/4 cup skim or whole ricotta.  Halve-chop spinach and remove stems, leave at 1 1/2 cup (or up it to 2 cups if you don't process the spinach).

Thanks for posting! I have made this several times now omitting the bread crumbs and adding sautéed garlic and onion. As another person mentioned, adding a small pinch of nutmeg gives it a boost also.

Awesome recipe!  I used lamb instead of ground beef and my fiance can't get enough of them. 
I did sweat some onion before browning the meat and used my blender as i don't have a food processor,
I would recommend chopping up your fresh spinach though before cooking to make it easier on your food processor or blender. haha.

Used wonton wrappers for the pasta to speed things up. Added fresh minced onion and garlic when browning beef. Cooked  at a slow boil for 4 minutes then into a tomato sauce to stay hot while cooking the rest. Loved the results! Putting the meat mixture in the food processor worked very well. Do not over process or it will be pasty.
