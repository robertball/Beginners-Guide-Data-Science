Delicious!!  I made a few changes.  I also greased the pan and dusted it with cinnamon instead of flour.  Instead of using chunky applesauce, I put in 1 Granny Smith apple (peeled and chopped) and 1/2 cup of cinnamon flavored applesauce.  I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teas. clove and put 1 1/2 packets of the oatmeal in the mix.  Finally, I mixed 1/8 cup packed brown sugar with 1 teas. melted butter, 1 teas. flour and the remaining half a packet of oatmeal and sprinkled this on top.  SO YUMMY!!!

I made this recipe today, but with a few adjustments.

Whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.

1 cup no-sugar-added applesauce PLUS 1 cup chopped fresh apple.

I added 1.5 packets of oatmeal to the mix, and reserved 0.5 for the topping.  

Also, I only cooked the bread about 45 minutes, not 60.

Thank you Monique for sharing this wonderful recipe!  The only changes I made were to add one apple, peeled and chopped. I also put 1 1/2 packets of oatmeal in the recipe and sprinkled 1/2 packet on top.  I won FIRST PLACE at our county fair with this recipe!

This was very good.  I added raisins and they were a nice complement.  Definitely make a streusel topping with 1/2 packet oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter.  That's the best part!

Easy to make, and very good, with a nice apple taste.  As other reviewers have said, not much of the oatmeal packet sprinkled on tip actually sticks to the bread.  I patted the topping into the batter, but still, much of it fell off.  I don't think it had much effect on the taste, however.  Mine didn't require a full hour of baking, and even at about 50 minutes, the apple pieces on the top were beginning to brown too much.

These make very good muffins!  (baked at 400 for 15-17 mins) I made a few changes; didn't have apple cinnamon oatmeal, so I used quick oats and 2 tsp apple juice concentrate, added a shredded apple and used 1 cup white whole wheat & 1/2 cup white.  Next time I will add more cinnamon.  Just had one warm from the oven.  Yum!

This bread was AMAZING! It has just the right amount of sweetness, and is moist. I also  added a chopped apple and a box of raisins, and it was great. Good idea for a quick  breakfast with coffee or even a late night snack. ***UPDATE**! ok I made this again, this time i used 1/2 cup of old fashion oats instead of instant oatmeal .Then dusted the pan with sugar and cinnamon, and added melted butter, sugar and cinnamon To the top and it was GREAT!

Super easy and good too!  I added a chopped up apple, used half whole wheat flour and a bit less on the sugar.  Turned out great!

A very good staple for making a healthy breakfast.  I subbed 1/2 c. of baking Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar and 1/2 c. of flax seed for 1/2 c. of the flour.  I also used sugar free applesauce and lower sugar apple cinnamon oatmeal.  I made muffins with the batter instead of the loaf - 19 minutes at 375 degrees.  My husband has already eaten two since they came out of the oven 20 minutes ago. I will absolutely be making these again!

Wow, I made this on a Sat morning to change up breakfast and it was absolutely delicious.  My 8 & 2 yr old ate half the loaf and they are very picky boys.  However I did change it a little.  I didn't have apple cinnamon oatmeal I just had plain Quaker oats so I just took about 1/2 cup and mixed it with a tsp of butter and about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and sugar.  I also didn't have baking soda so I substituted 2 tsp of baking powder.  I used a can of unsweetened applesauce and added a chopped grannysmith apple.  I also dusted the pan with cinnamon and sugar before I put in the mixture.  I baked it for 55 minutes and when cooled I dusted with confectioners sugar.  I was sooooo delicious and both my husband and children loved it and I will make it again:)

I liked it. Didn't love it. A nice bread for breakfast, but wasn't as "desserty" as I was looking for ....I made several changes as I wanted it very moist, but it was still kind of dry. I added 2 cups of cinnamon applesauce, and used quick cooking oats instead of instant. I made an oatmeal/butter/flour brown sugar mixture for the top...and the big change was that I added 2 cups of cinnamon chips to it....was still a tad dry, but yummy all the same.

This was a very fun recipe to make, and was really very simple. This really goes well with Tea of any kind. Using fresh apples gives it a fresh taste to it. I would recommend using real apples, and not packaged applesauce.

This was really tasty! I made a few changes after reading other reviews. I used regular applesauce and added one apple shredded. I added the sugar to the shredded apple and let it soak for a bit to pull out all the juices. I put one and a half packets of the oatmeal in the batter and mixed the remaing half with butter, brown sugar, and a little flour for the topping. It has a very good apple flavor. Will make again!

Wow is all I can say!! This bread is so moist and delicious! Dont skip the oatmeal on top it really gives a good flavor and texture.   I only had peach oatmeal so I used that instead of the apple cinnamon oatmeal. I did not have chunky applesauce so I used a cup of regular no sugar added applesauce and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. I also did as others suggested and used 1 1/2 packets of the oatmeal in the batter and 1/2 packet on top. I floured the loaf pan with flour and cinnamon mixed together. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp salt.   This was incredibly easy and my 2 year old cannot get it in her mouth fast enough, hehe. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I made at least half a dozen loaves of this at Christmastime.  It's delicious and makes the house smell so-o-o good while it's baking!   Of course, I made a few modifications: Instead of using chunky applesauce, use 1 apple (peeled & GRATED) and 1cup of cinnamon flavored applesauce. Add 1/2+ teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon clove and put 1 1/2 packets of the oatmeal in the mix. (BTW, you can mix ingredients in ANY order!)    For TOPPING (instead of just sprinkling one pouch of oatmeal on top): mix 1 T. melted butter with 1/8 cup packed brown sugar, 1 teaspoon flour and the remaining half a packet of oatmeal and spread this on top BEFORE baking.  Bake for 45minutes! Cover with kitchen towel to cool.     Oh my!  That's good!

This is very tasty!  I made a few changes, based on what I had on hand and what my kids will eat.  I used no-sugar-added non-chunky applesauce, 1/2c light brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar, and put both packets of oatmeal into the batter.

This one surprised me. Inexpensive to make and really delicious. I used store-brand oatmeal packets. Very moist, great apple flavor, and the fact that chunky applesauce was the primary moisture instead of butter made me feel less guilty about eating it. I followed other's advice and added 1 1/2 packets of the oatmeal to the bread. It seemed like 1/2 pack was more than enough to cover the top, and I can understand how for some the topping might have gotten burned. Check your oven temp and check the bread for doneness 5 - 10 minutes before the recipe states. It may be ready and you're getting a wet tester (toothpick) because you tested through an apple chunk in the batter, instead of the cake. Delicious, cheap, easy.

Delicious!!! I didn't have apple sauce and just peeled and chopped an apple, to which I added some apple-cinnamon butter, and only used one packet of oatmeal.  It's soft and moist and delicious!

Awesome bread! I was looking for something different, easy and delicious and this was definitely it. I did add one fresh peeled and chopped granny smith apple, which is a must. The bread would have been too plain without it. I also dusted the pan with cinnamon versus flour.

I just made this bread today!  I am far from a good cook though I do enjoy making breads.  This was EXCELLENT! With so many apples from apple picking instead of using applesauce I used a HUGE granny smith and diced it up.  I als used a half cup of sour cream. I also added just a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Instead of apple cinn. oatmeal I only had cinnimon raisin.  It worked just as well.  I took others advice and used 1.5  packets in the mix and half packet on top. It looked so pretty when I pulled it out of the oven!  Hubby and I just tried an end piece and it was yummy and even moist!  I can't wait to get to the middle!  TWO thumbs up!!!!

This bread has good flavor but came out very dense and chewy.  I didn't like the texture and I hoped it would be lighter.  I didn't over mix the batter and folded the flour and oatmeal in by hand.  It has great flavor but needs a little more lift.

I just made this. I had some oatmeal and some apple sauce just lying around and it turned out great! The recipe is very easy to follow. I agree with some other reviewers that the oatmeal at the top falls off. I used Maple & Brown Sugar Oatmeal on top. Maybe next time I'll mix it with a little bit of butter for a crispy crust on top. Also, I was out of apple cinnamon oatmeal so I used cinnamon spice and half of a Granny Smith apple. Wow. I'm going in for another slice now.

Awesome! I did the recipe the exact way...mine was done in about 50 minutes. If you want it for a dessert type, cream cheese icing for spread tasted amazing with this. Would highly recommend!

If it wasn't for the crust topping, this bread would be very bland.  As others suggested, I would cut up an apple next time for some needed flavor.

This recipe is great! I made it many times and it has never failed! I first made this when I was given lots of freshly picked apples. Because I had so many apples, I made my own applesauce, and I also chopped an apple and added it to the batter. Also, I saw that many people had trouble having the oatmeal stick to the top of the bread. I didn't have trouble with that at all. I saved half a packet for the top of the bread instead of the whole packet, and I sprinkled it on top after the bread was in the oven for a few minutes.

Although others liked it all right, I couldn't get over the fact that it tasted like eating instant oatmeal from the packet without cooking it.

Very good flavor.  Substituted light margarine for the butter and 1/2 the sugar with splenda and it worked great.  Easy to make.

I made this in the morning before work to take to co-workers.  It is easy, inexpensive and oh so tasty.  I highly recommend.  I used the store brand oatmeal packets.  Took advise of others and used 1 1/2 packets in batter and 1/2 packet on top. I sprinkled with some cinnamon/sugar before topping with oatmeal.  I agree with others to check the bread 5 to 10 minutes before suggested cooking time ends for doneness.  I didn't and wish I would have.  It was still delicious just more done on the bottom and sides than I like.  However was still moist & delicious.  Received many compliments.  Thanks for posting such a tasty, easy bread recipe.  Oh yeah, I doubled and it worked out just fine.

Good. I used my own homemade applesauce and half whole wheat/half white flours. My kids had two pieces each this morning with eggs and bacon and asked for more! I found it a little too sweet. I might cut back the sugar next time I make it. I think this would be perfect to make for my son's class for daily snacks. I bet this would be even better the next day.

Yummmy!  I also did as other reviewers and used 1 1/2 packets in the bread and made a crumb topping with the other 1/2. I also added some chopped apples to the applesauce since I didn't have chunky applesause.

I thought the bread was dry.  Flavor was pretty good.  It tastes much better (not as dry) if you eat it warm and with butter on it.  I made it just as the recipe called for except I couldn't find chunky applesauce so I used a little over 3/4 c. applesauce and added about 1/2 cup of chopped canned apples.  I may try it again with more applesauce and not bake it for the whole hour. Baking at an hour didn't make it burnt but maybe that added to the dryness.

Great bread!  I also added one diced Granny Smith apple after I mixed everything together.  In the mix I followed other reviewers and put 1 1/2 packets apple/cinnamon oatmeal, and then for the top I mixed 1/8 cup packed brown sugar with 1 teas. melted butter, 1 teas. flour and the remaining half a packet of oatmeal and sprinkled this on top per other reviewers.  I baked the full 60 min, and it was moist and full of flavor.  I thought it was a tad sweet even, but the rest of the family all said 5 stars!  Thank you for this recipe!

I followed the previous advice to add 1 apple, sliced, and 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce.  And also the 1/8 cup brown sugar/1tsp flour/1tsp butter/ 1/2 packet oatmeal for the topping.  Even for a cooking newbie like myself this turned out spectacular.  It is very moist and flavorful.  I'll be making it many more times.

Delicious! Followed suggestions of other readers - used 1 1/2 packs oatmeal in bread and 1/2 on top. Also added a topping that another reader gave in her review. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and used cinnamon applesauce. Have already been asked for the recipe!

The one good thing about this recipe was that it was very easy to make, and it makes a nice thing to have around to snack on.  But I like a bread like this to be really spicy, and despite using Cinnamon & Spice oatmeal it just didn't seem that spicy to me.  I think some clove and nutmeg would be good.  I too put less of the oatmeal mix on top, more like about 2/3 a pack.

I loved this bread.  It was quick and easy to make.  I also made it a little sweeter by greasing the pan and coating it with cinnamon-sugar instead of flour.  Yummy.  Thanks for the great new bread to go with my coffee.

Very nice taste, easy to make, smelled great!  Just a side note, though: a lot of the oatmeal falls off the top after baking and is useless.  Next time, I'll only sprinkle on 1/2 of the packet and mix the rest in with the bread.

It came out perfectly!  I would only change the amount of oatmeal that is placed on top to 1/2 the packet of oatmeal. (Other reviewers have said this as well.)

My husband, daughter and I really liked this recipe with the following changes:
1) I doubled it the second time I made it so we could freeze the extras 
2) I used canola oil and "country crock" to reduce the dairy for my dairy-sensitive husband
2) added almond milk to liquids to increase moisture
3) used half whole wheat flour
4) reduced sugar by about 1/4 - could have used less - used part BROWN SUGAR!
5) Used already cooked oatmeal with apples that I had made for breakfast earlier in the week. I make extra on purpose so I have it for this bread. 
6) I put some of the batter in muffin tins for easy storage and eating later. 

Bake. Eat. YUM!!

Quick and simple recipe. Didn't have all the ingredients listed so here are my tweaks to the recipe:
-Regular applesauce instead of chunky, and added a whole semi-finely chopped apple
-Rolled (quick) oats instead of instant oatmeal packets. 2 tbsp in the batter and 2 on top.
-Extra cinnamon in the batter and on top of the loaf (to make up for the instant oatmeal packets)
-A dash of nutmeg
-I used whole wheat flour so I added a little honey and agave for extra moisture, and used a little less sugar to avoid it being overly sweet

Great to see a recipe incorporating instant oatmeal into baking.  I was getting very tired of the same old oatmeal breakfast.  I followed the recipe except I reduced the sugar into half and added some blueberry and walnut.  Also, I had to add about 1/2 cup of soymilk because the batter was rather a hard dough.  
It came out perfect and it was great for breakfast with a cup of coffee.

Very good as written! The bread was sweet, moist, tender and just a litte bit dense. I was going to a friends house yesterday for coffee, so I needed a quick, easy recipe to put together and bake while getting ready and doing other "house stuff". This was perfect, and easy! I did add the 1/8c. brown sugar, 1t butter, 1t flour to the topping as suggested by another reviewer - that was a nice and pretty touch. My friend loved the bread!

Super yummy! I dusted the pan with cinnamon as well as sugar. I found the 2nd pk of oatmeal on top was too much. most of it fell off when i took the loaf out of the pan. I also baked ine for about 70mins. It was very tasty and moist!

I made this bread exactly as stated, and  I got rave reviews. It was not overly sweet or too plain tasting. I do reccomend checking on it after 40 minutes, because many people have stated that it does not take the whole 60 minutes to cook. Mine, personally took 50 minutes.

Great flavor but dry. Cooking time was much shorter but that is ok as long as you check on it to make sure it isn't overcooked.

Great! Added 1/2c. diced pears. Everyone couldn't believe this was from scratch and not bought from the store! Really excellent recipe!

VERY GOOD!  I used a splenda/sugar mixture (the kind they sell in the baking aisle) instead of regular sugar, 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup wheat, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light instead of butter, and (like other reviewers) I used 1.5 packets of oatmeal in the mix and 1/2 a packet on top (it would just fall off if you had any more anyway).  Great recipe! I feel like it could be a little more moist so I might add a little more applesauce next time and see what happens.

This was really delicous.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  Next time I think I will try adding the chunky applesauce at the end of the recipe so that there will be more pieces of apple in the bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thank you Monique! This is great. Minor changes I made - added 1 cup chopped apples (Macintosh), 1/4 cup raisins, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. This will be made again and again and again...

Wonderful! doubled everything to make two loaves. Added 1 granny smith apple plus a smaller one. Only took 45 mins to bake. Next time I'll add a pinch  of salt to batter, it seemed to be missing this element. Excellent. Thank you!

What a great way to use up all of those packets of oatmeal that no one eats!  I love this recipe not only for its simplicity, but also for its flexibility - you could easily substitute different fruit purees (like pumpkin) and different flavors of oatmeal for a new taste.  This is a keeper!

LOVED it! So easy, moist, and fluffy! Great flavor. I used the trick of putting 1.5 packets of oatmeal into the bread, and .5 packets on top. Most of it stayed on, and the crumble like topping was delicious!

I made this for my coworkers and the entire loaf was gone before my pc was fully booted! Everyone asked for the recipe. This was SO moist and yummy! I also followed the suggestion to add 1 1/2 packs of oatmeal to the batter and 1/2 on top.

Great recipe! It was quick and easy, with great results. The bread is nice and moist, sweet but not too sweet. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it's great as is. The second time, though, I made a change that I thought worked great. I added a handful of regular oats to the batter. The first time I made the bread I thought the bread didn't have quite enough oats.

This was a great, easy, and delicious bread. The sprinkle of oatmeal on the top of the bread made it look so professional and pretty. I also only used half of the packet of oatmeal for the topping and that worked great. The bread was moist, and I added about a cup of chopped apples which it made it even better.

I just finished making this bread and my whole house smells great!  It is moist, yet still light.  I didn't have apple cinnamon oatmeal so I used plain instant oatmeal.  I added some extra cinnamon and brown sugar to compensate.  I also added a chopped up apple as advised.  I did make a topping with plain oats, brown sugar and butter.  Excellent!

Very good.  Really liked the packet of oatmeal as streusel on top:  good, and without the tedium of cutting cold butter into flour!  I didn't have chunky applesauce, so next time I will be sure to use that.  I think it will be even better with chunks of apple.  Using fresh apples is probably an even better idea.

I thought this was great. I followed suggestions and only added a light dusting of the oatmeal on top of the loaf, adding the rest in the batter-- smells wonderful, tastes great. I have also made this using whole wheat flour for half of the flour, it made a denser bread, but was still excellent.

Snowed in for the day and wanted to make a bread with ingredients I had on hand and this is what I found.  YUMMY! Followed the directions exactly as written and it came out perfect.  Will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful cinnamon bread. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and included a green apple cut in small cubes. Also, instead of white sugar I used brown sugar. I did not have instant apple cinnamon oatmeal and instead I added 1 1/2 packet of cinnamon spice oatmeal. Finally, I baked it only for 45 minutes. It looked beautiful when I got it out of the oven and cooked well through. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a BIG hit at our house! I did substitute maple and brown sugar oatmeal packets (it was all I had in the cupboard) and it was delicious. I made two smaller loaves out of one recipe and at 40 minutes, they were perfect. I also added one teaspoon of ground allspice. It smells like fall! So hard not to cut into it when it was piping hot. The kids loved it, even when I made a whole wheat version. I will make this again.

I just made this bread and it is currently in the oven.  I took advice from one review using cinnamon instead of flour to coat the greased pan.  I added a pinch of salt and a pinch of nutmeg.  I made my own applesauce so we shall see how his bread turns out...45 minutes of baking to go!  Easy to make.

WOW!!!!!!! I have made this bread multiple times, and it is AWESOME! I make it with whole wheat flour, sub. apple sauce for oil, only add 1/2 cup of sugar, and add one LARGE (about 1 and 1/2 cup) granny smith apple and it is one of the best breads I've ever had! Probably the best "healthy" bread! I make it every week now!

Great, great recipe. Tons of flavor, easy to prepare. The instant apple cinnamon oatmeal packet was a nice ingredient. I did follow recommendations from other raters and chopped a granny smith apple to the mix for a fresh, true flavor, added nutmeg and cloves for a more spicer taste. Prepared a streusel for the top. Thanks for the recipe and recommendations.

To be honest, I was kind of disappointed. I read the reviews and was expecting this to be amazing, but it wasn't. It was good, but not as good as everyone raved about. I love apple bread, and this just didn't do it for me.

This is a delicious breakfast bread.  My house smelled amazing while it was baking.  I also dusted the pan with flour and cinnamon and only reserved 1/2 packet of oatmeal for the top, as other reviewers suggested.  My kids want me to make this often.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very nice and moist. I used 1 pkt of oatmeal, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 unbleached flour, added 1 small cortland apple and 1/4 cup golden raisins. I did a streusel topping, baked for 45 minutes. This is a keeper, thank you!

Awesome basic recipe ! You can totally change up the ingredients and come up with any kind of bread you want.  I didn't have applesauce so I used canned pumpkin. used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and changed instant apple oatmeal to cinnamon and spice. The bread was soooo good !

This quick bread is delicious, fast, easy and uses minimal ingredients. I made the following mods and it turned out perfect: Used half regular flour and half cake flour and because my son has a dairy allergy I subbed butter flavored shortening plus 2T water for the butter. Keep a close eye on yours as it bakes, mine only took 45 minutes, would have been overdone after that. Also, I added both packets of oatmeal to the batter rather than using some as a topping.

I made this bread for the first time this morning and made a few little changes with great success.  I read previous reviews and took the advice of one and added a couple of my own little tweaks as well.  I used 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce and one whole, peeled and chopped apple, I sprayed butter flavored Pam on the inside of the pan and rather than coating with flour, used cinnamon, I used 1 and 1/2 packages of oatmeal in the mix and topped it with the remaining half.   I used wheat flour in place of all-purpose and added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and one small, snack-sized box of raisins.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - it was a hit!

Very good recipe! Very moist and very tasty.  I basically followed it as is.  The only thing I changed is that I took some suggestions and dusted the pan with cinnamon along with the flour.  And I used regular apple sauce (the amount) and added one apple peeled and chopped in small pieces.  In the future I think I will add 1.5 pkgs of the oatmeal to the batter and use only 0.5 pkgs for the topping.  I found it to be a little much on top, it kept falling off and made more of a mess

This is pretty good.  I only did a few things differently.  Never heard of chunky applesauce, so I just used smooth.  Added more cinnamon.  Used one package of oatmeal (half in batter, half on top).  Used King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  And added sliced almonds to the top.  The edges did start to brown a little too much towards the end without being fully done in the middle.  Didn't take away from the taste on the inside, though.  Overall, pretty good.

It is not bad but seems to be missing something.  I usually like my breads on the spicy side so next time I'll add some spices to it.

The house smelled REALLY good while this bread was baking, and it looked very nice/professional coming out of the oven.  However, I found it a bit dry and bland. =| Not sure if I did anything wrong; I double-checked the ingredients and I don't think I omitted anything.

Easy and yummy!  Could not find chunky applesauce so I chopped up a granny smith apple and added it to regular applesauce.  Next time I will make muffins.

This bread is my absolute favorite! It is so easy and delicious. Just like other reviewers, I will only put it in the oven for 45 minutes and I will put about 1.5 packets into the mix. Wonderful recipe!!

We over all liked it, i guess I just wanted it to be a little more oatmealy. I changed a couple things, whole wheat flour, cinnamon apple sauce, fresh apple chopped,chopped up pecans for some crunch, and took a strudel topping from a previous review. Next time Im going to use original oatmeal and add more in and on top.

made a few changes to make it even healthier; used a high fiber package of cinnamon oatmeal (only 1), added 1 chopped up apple, used 1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup white flour and used 1/4 cup light I can't believe its not butter.

This is a great bread recipe. I LOVE the apple sauce and oatmeal. It's a bread you don't have to feel guilty eating. Very nutritious. I made a few adjustments to fit what I already had at home: 1) I made my own apple sauce with some bruised apples I had in the fridge, refer to "Delicious Apple Sauce" on this website. 2) I added one cup of old fashioned oatmeal, as I didn't have instant oatmeal. I also left out the oatmeal on the top. 3) Because my apple sauce already had brown sugar and cinnamon in it, I put a little less than a cup of white sugar in this batter, and only did a few shakes of cinnamon. Next time I will only cook it 40-45 minutes, as it turned out a little dry and over cooked at only 50 minutes. I made it 3 days ago, and it is still delicious. Will make again with the adjusted cooking time. Enjoy!

This bread was awesome. I used 1 pkt of maple & brown sugar instant oatmeal, which is all I had on hand. I also added approx. 1 C of chopped apple as we don't use chunky applesauce. I baked in a bundt cake pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Will ABSOLUTELY make again and again!

It was a great recipe. I don't know why it called for oatmeal in the batter,did not taste any inside,and it could have been less on top and I also didn't have chunky applesauce but used regular,came out fine.
**UPDATE** I have made this again and I seem to have better reviews about it, I  didn't cook it as long, I used a different type of applesauce,just had strawberry/banana kind, used it and didn't put oatmeal on the outside. It does seem to be better!

This was good! I used my own homemade applesauce which is made from ginger gold apples. Also the Costco size box of oatmeal that we have did not have any apple cinnamon packets left (since that is the kids favorite) after I had already assembled the rest of the ingrediants for this so I forged ahead and used 2 packets of the cinnamon roll flavor. Thanks for sharing. This is a great treat that got included in my sons back to school lunch!

My family loves this recipe.  I make my own applesauce, and I often make too much to eat within a week (it's recommended shelf-life).  This bread is great for using up that last little bit.  Delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe! I used nearly 2 oatmeal packets inside the batter and added a dash of cloves. I also used 1/2 c. splenda and 1/2 c. sugar. Then I added 4 egg whites in place of 2 whole eggs. I don't usually change up recipes to make them healthier, but it was fabulous with them. The remainder of the ingredients I followed as directed. I made them into muffins baking them at 350 for 16 minutes. The smell is heavenly and the taste is even better! Thanks for a super easy and delicious recipe!

Love it! I made the recipe without any alterations, and it was moist and flavorful. Everyone at home and at work loved it! The only thing I might do differently next time is to use 1 1/2 packets in the bread, and half a pkg. on the top, and I would press the dried apple bits down into the top, as the ones that were exposed were a bit burnt. This recipe is very easy to make-- a definite keeper!

This is by far the best bread-like recipe I have ever made! I barely get it out of the over before it gets all eaten! Don't change ANYTHING; I have made it over a dozen times and have stored it in my personal recipe book to use for many years to come! Thanx so much!

This is a wonderful sweet, chewy apple bread.  My whole extended framily loves it and some even asked me to make it for them as a christmas gift.  The only thing I did differently was adding about 1/2 cup of chopped dried apples (that I make every year after apple picking).  The dried apples reconstitue while the bread is baking and add a rally nice concentrated apple flavor to each bite!

I made this just like the recipe says and it turned out dry and not too sweet. I think it is a good base for a potentially good recipe. Next time I will add 4oz sour cream and maybe another 1/2 cup of sugar. I also had to pick the burnt apples off the top maybe my oven was too hot so I don't want to give it too low of rating. Sour cream by the way, it a great way to moisten any bread or cake recipe.

Great recipe!  I've made this a few times.  Definitely use the chunky apple sauce.  I also used eggs whites to make it a bit healthier with no side effects.  Like the others, I added 1 and 1/2 packets of oatmeal to the loaf and used the other 1/2 packet to top the loaf.  I also made muffins out of this recipe which turned out great and cut the baking time in half.

This was super easy to make.  The only change I made was to add 1 peeled and chopped apple into the mix.  Next time I will take the advice of others and mix 1 1/2 pkg. of the oatmeal into the mix and only top with 1/2 pkg.  I ended up shaking the extra oatmeal off the top anyway.  The inside of the bread was moist, but the outside was a little over done.  Next time I will trim the baking time a little.

I did as others suggested and used fresh chopped apple, and used just a little of the apple sauce. I baked in four little loaf pans, and it turned out wonderful. I did use a whole packet of oatmeal in the batter, and another whole packet on top, but I think by speading the batter among the four small loaf pans I needed to use the whole 2nd packet of oatmeal.

This bread is so yummy!  It's nice and moist and has a very good apple flavor.  The only change I made was to just use 1/2 a packet of the oatmeal on the top.

I made a half batch to see how the bread would turn out.  I loved it and so did my 3 year old and nieghbors.  It's a great breakfast you can feel good about serving.  I cut up fresh peeled apples and put them in.

This was good.  I used both pkgs of oatmeal in the bread as I knew my son wouldn't eat it if sprinkled on top.  I didn't find it had much flavor though, probably won't make again.

This is a delicious recipe!  I added 1 cup of cinnamon chips and also went to the "trouble" of cutting in 1 T of butter for the streusel topping.  It was delicious - this is a keeper!

This is a big hit with my family (my mother demanded I make more). I've tried with a whole package of oatmeal on top and a half package, and I think just a half package stays on better. Good with cream cheese.

This bread turned out great!  I made a few adjustments based on the notes of others. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. All whole wheat flower. I added almond extract and sliced almonds instead of vanilla and walnuts. I threw in a bit of coconut, 1/2 cup of oats, and a few shakes of poppy seeds. It’s delicious!

So Good!  You really taste the oatmeal and the cinnamon and the apple doesn't get lost at all.  I didn't have chunky applesauce so I grated one apple and mixed with 1/2 c regular sauce and I only kept back 1/2 packet of oatmeal for the topping which I mixed with a bit of butter and sugar.

This stuff is delicious! Very easy to make and tastes amazing; the only downside is that I have to fight my roommates off of it. Perfect for an indulgent weekend breakfast and even better than pancakes or waffles.

I left out the oatmeal because I wanted a smoother bread, but it was very good.  I might recommend baking it for just a few minutes less, though.  I did mine for the whole hour and it was a little too crispy around the edges.  I'll probably do 50-55 minutes next time.

Absolutely delicious and makes the kitchen smell so nice when it's baking! I used about 3/4 a cup of sugar instead of the full cup, and added one peeled and thinly chopped Apple. This was really yummy; I highly recommend!

I used unsweetened quick oats and unsweetened applesauce vs. sweetened/oatmeal packets.  I will add another 1/4 cup sugar. (a bit bland)
I also added chopped pumkin seeds and 1 cup craisins.  I will also add another 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon next time. 
Tried to make this a bit more healthy!

This was good, but waay too sweet for my personal tastes, even though I used Splenda.  It was more cake-like than bread-like.  I thought the two packets of oatmeal were overkill and a bit too sickeningly sweet and fake.  Next time, I'd cut them in half - as well as the sugar, and use whole wheat flour.  If you like super sweet quick bread, though, this tasted great. :-)

Really yummy sweet bread that goes awesome with coffee or tea!  I substituted white sugar for raw sugar, all-purpose for wheat flour, and egg whites for the eggs. It made the bread ridiculously heavy but still yummy!

This is probably the BEST quick bread I've ever made! I, like the other reviews, added 1.5 packets of oatmeal to the batter and used the other half pack for the topping. I've made it a few times now - using only the oatmeal as a topping and also making a streusel topping with the oatmeal, cinnamon, brown sugar and butter. My roommates and friends request this bread often!

Not impressed at all. Texture was good, but  I don't think the instant oatmeal was such a great idea. Gave it a strange flavor rather than a nice fresh apple taste.

I made this to go with mulled cidar at our Halloween Party.  I spiced it in half the long way and then into 12 slices.  No lie, it was gone into little mouths in under 5 min.  It was there and then it wasn't!  Spooky!  I've made it twice since.  It's a keeper!

This was good.  I skipped the applesauce and diced two Macintosh apples instead. Next time I'll follow other reviewer's suggestions and use only 1/2 packet of the oatmeal on the top.

Guess I should have read the reviews first. I made this exactly as written and didn't like it much. A whole pack of oatmeal on top is way too much. The top was powdery, salty and the apple bits got way too brown. I may try this again following some of the other review suggestions. This could be a really great recipe if the topping was fixed.

It was ok. Not crazy about the texture or the flavor the oatmeal gave it. It may be better if just plain oatmeal was used.

Bland and boring.  I was disappointed the bread lacked flavor all together.  I followed a recommendation and made the topping with brown sugar, but that was the only flavor and not enough to give the bread any taste.

Delicious, easy and economical. I love that there is so little butter/oil in the recipe. And it is a creative way to use instant oatmeal. I put 2 packets in the batter and skipped the one on top because if my husband saw oatmeal on it he might think it was "healthy" and be put off. But it turned out great with that slight change.

Loved it!  Took it to a brunch this morning and was already asked for the recipe.  I made it with 1 C all purpose flour and 1/2 C wheat flour and then made some changes others had said: added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves, used 1 1/2 packets of the oatmeal in the mix and used the last 1/2 packet to make the struesel topping which was fantastic.  I also added 1 1/2 small granny smith apples diced.  It was so moist and the streusel topping just made it great (although some of the topping did fall off when I took the loaf out of the pan, there was still plenty left to make it delicious).  This will definitely go in my recipe box and be used often.

This bread is awesome.  I actually made some pearsauce and put it in instead of the applesauce but it was great.  We ate it warm right out of the oven.  Yum!

Delicious! I made a few changes-- didn't have chunky apple sauce so used the regular kind. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter. Like others suggested I used one and a half packets of oatmeal for the bread and I combined the remaining oatmeal with butter, cinnamon, sugar, and flour to make a streusel topping. I only baked the bread for 50 mins. Smelled great in the oven!

My six year old said "Something smells good in the kitchen!" and then my husband came home and said "That smells great!".  Believe me, it tastes just as good!  Only thing I did was add a diced apple.  It was fantastic.  My one year old enjoyed it as well.  And then his little cheeks smelled like apple cinnamon.  A keeper for sure!

Really good! I made a couple changes though. I added one grated apple, 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats, and instead of 1 and a half cups of flour, I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. It does make the whole house smell great when it's baking!!

Awesome recipe, I loved it! Very light flavor, I love the sweetness of the apple sauce, and then there's a nice hint of cinnamon wafting throughout.  The only problem I had was my loaf pan was a little small, so as the bread rose, the edges of the crust got overdone :( But the center is great! I didn't have chunky applesauce either which didn't matter too much, but I think in the future I'll add a little more applesauce to make it a little more moist. It wasn't dry, I just like my breads like this to be really moist. I can't wait to have a slice of this with my morning coffee tomorrow!

Yummy and easy. I added one chopped apple and handful raisins to the dough. I used cinnamon applesauce (all I had), decreased cinnamon to 1 tsp  and used sugar to dust the pan instead of flour. I put 1 1/2 packet of oatmeal to the dough and used other 1/2 packet of oatmeal on top and sprinkled about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar. Next time I might spice it up even more with nutmeg.

The only change I made was adding a can of cooked spiced apples, drain off the excess liquid. I made small individual loaves to give away to friends. Everyone loved this bread. I wasn't that impressed though.

I made this for my parents this weekend, and they loved it! Very moist, and tender. I did make a few changes, I used plain apple cinnamon applesauce (1 cup) and used 1 apple shredded in it. And as others suggested used 1.5 packets of oatmeal in the bread and 1/2 on top with some cinnamon and sugar. Turned out wonderful! Thanks.

I would say for a lower fat recipe - this is great!!  My kids loved it - and anything on the semi-healthy side that I can get them to eat is GREAT!  I'll be making it again - and maybe trying a different type of oatmeal in it!

This was a great recipe!  I took it to a playdate, and the toddlers and moms loved it.  I did add in one chopped up apple, and put 1.5 packets of oatmeal in the batter, then used the last 1/2 packet with the struesel topping others suggested below.  I plan to make this again soon!

This bread is delicious! My husband refers to it as "fall in a loaf". I followed the recipe exactly, except next time, I might use an 8x5 loaf pan so it will rise more. I used the whole packet of oatmeal on top but I found the loaf a little messy to cut because a lot of it fell off. Wonderful taste & texture, though!

I made this recipe as is, except I didn't use a whole packet for the topping. This bread is perfect for light snacking, or for breakfast with coffee. I like that it's not so spicey, keeps it light, I think; but should you want it spicier, it would be easy to adjust. Plus, it smells wonderful, and looks very pretty on a fancy plate.

In the alternate version, I used two packets of cinnamon spice oatmeal, one cup of mashed banana instead of applesauce, and replaced the 1 tsp cinnamon with 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It came out great!  Quick and easy, thanks for this recipe!

Instead of just using applesauce, I chopped up an apple and used that in the batter with a spoonful or two of cinnamon apple applesauce for moisture.  I didn't have the apple cinnamon oatmeal.  So I used that special woman's oatmeal in the golden brown sugar flavor.  I put one and a half packets into the bread and only saved a half of a packet for the top.  I also threw a 1/4 cup of raisins into the bread.  Accidently left out the cinnamon until it was too late.  So before it had finished baking, I dusted cinnamon all over the top of the bread.  Best bread I've eaten in a very long time, I highly recommend using a real apple in the batter though.  That's the best tasting part of it.

yummy! leaving off the topping does not affect the taste of the bread and reduces mess. instead of the applesauce, i chop one large granny smith apple and use just a few spoonfuls of applesauce for moisture.

This recipe tastes better than it sounds. I added walnuts to the batter. A whole package of instant oatmeal is much too much to put on the top of the loaf. Try it! It makes up fast.
