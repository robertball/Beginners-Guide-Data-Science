I made this two days in a row; first day flat, second day magic!
Here were my changes: 
Both days: 1 tsp vanilla instead of nutmeg
Second day: I warmed the eggs in a glasso of hot water before using, microwaved the milk for about 20 seconds. Also I made sure the pan was real hot when I put it in(I used a 9inch round cake pan). Also, I added about 5 minutes cooking time at the end, temp turned down to 350. 
Other than these temperature adjustments, all ingredients were the same, and the second day it turned out so much fluffier. Coming out of the pan- such a difference. Hopefully this helps others like me who don't get the rise they are looking for.

This recipe is kind of complicated and can easily be simplified... Skip the skillet business and use a 9x13 baking dish. Heat your oven to 425 F degrees. Chop 1/3 cup butter up into your baking dish and let melt in your preheated oven. Once all of the butter has melted, take baking dish out and pour in batter, DO NOT STIR OR MIX just let it be. Bake for 20-25 minutes and voila!

Take out the nutmeg and this recipe is IDENTICAL to the "Puffy Oven Pancake" recipe in the Betty Crocker cookbook - every last measurement is the same. That aside, I love these! My favorite way to make this is to peel and slice an apple, and spread the slices out on the bottom of the pan (I use a 9" pyrex pie pan, melt the butter in it in the oven). Sprinkle the apple slices with a little cinnamon and nutmeg, then pour in the batter. After it's done baking, flip it out on a plate and serve. YUM! Oh, sidenote - bake it more like 1/2 hour at 400 and it won't be so custard-y, more like a cross between eggs and a pancake.

This is critical!  If anyone is having trouble getting this to raise like the reviews say it will - make sure you are not using the convection option on your oven!  I can't tell you how many times I tried this recipe -and others - only to have it turn out like a regular pancake.  Then I saw this hint on another website, tried it again and it worked perfectly!  So be aware - NOT FOR CONVECTION !

I think what helps to make this recipe "light and fluffy" is to make sure your eggs are at room temperature.  I have tried various recipes and the ones that call for room temp eggs turn out much better.

Wow, this recipe was SO good!  Very impressive the way it looks when its done, too!  I warmed the milk for 20 sec. in the microwave, and the eggs in a glass of hot tap water for about 2-3 minutes. I added about 1/4 tsp. vanilla, and still used a dash of nutmeg.  I baked this in a non-stick oven safe pan (calphalon) and it turned out beautifully! My daughter liked hers with maple syrup, I liked mine with just butter and powdered sugar.  For my husband, I sauteed some apple slices in a pan with butter, cinnamon, and a bit of brown sugar; then added apple juice and a bit of cornstarch and simmered until thick (a suggestion from another review).  This was a great topping too!! I will definitely make these many times again!

Yum, this recipe is so fun!  This may sound gross, but if you're looking to make a non-sweet snack, you can omit the nutmeg and top this with cheese/salami/mushrooms/etc to make sort of an eggy pizza.  Sounds weird, but is actually very yummy.

I made this tonite!  It was so great.  I added a spoonful of sugar and a splash of vanilla to the mix before baking.  It rose beautifully and took exactly the amount of time the recipe states.  I topped it with plenty of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Perfect.  I baked this in a glass Pyrex pie plate.  Heated it in the oven in advance and melted the butter, etc.  Everything turned out absolutely perfectly.  I will totally make this again and again.

This is identical to my great aunt's recipe, except she sprinkled the nutmeg on top.  easily adjustable for how many people you have.  It is also easier to put in a blender than to whisk by hand.

This is a great recipe, I had this at a restaurant and just had to make it at home, I was spending a lot going out just for this yummy dish! First time I made it, it was disgusting!! Second time I made it, it tasted just like the restaurant dish and I was very pleased and unlike reviewers complaining about the skillet, I used a non cast iron skillet and it came out amazing, skillets are OK! What I would recommend however, is going with the reviewers suggestions of placing the eggs in hot water for 2-3 minutes and warming the milk for about 20 seconds. I think this really helped it come together the second time I made it. I added a pinch of cinnamon and still used a pinch of nutmeg and vanilla. I would highly recommend using 3 eggs instead of 2 so it won't taste so floury and bake 20-25 minutes, not 12. It tasted just like the restaurant dish and I was amazed, it even baked just as it should. I like mines without the syrup or fruit and I dust it with powdered sugar and top it with fresh lemon juice. I was very impressed at how easy it was to make and I was going to give up after my second try and leave it for the pros. I'm an amateur cook and this tasted just like the professionals. Happy cooking!! Hope this review helps and it's just as satisfying for you and your family as it was for me, I'll be making this regularly and I'm gonna awe my amazing boyfriend with this dish. Enjoy!!!!!

I tried to make this into a healthy recipe by substituting soy flour for the white flour, egg substitutes for the eggs, and soy milk for the regular milk. I had no idea what it was suppossed to look or taste like, as I have never even heard of them before. It turned out like a flat 1 in. pancake that tastes pretty gross...I was disappointed, so I decided to make the "real version." Well I stuck it in the oven and WAS very surprised to see the result. The sides rose beautifully- and it seemed magical. :) It was pretty good, not wonderful tasting. But the effect is incredible. And the household gobbled it up quite quickly. I like butter and powdered sugar myself.

I read all reviews and this is what I did. 3 eggs, 2/3 C butter, milk, and flour, tsp vanilla, pinch salt. I put a 12" Calphalon pan in oven while preheating to 425, with butter in the pan. When preheated the butter was browning. I added a sliced apple and sprinkled cinnamon on it, then dumped in the batter on top, and baked it for a scant 20 minutes. It slid right out of the pan. I served it with sugar-free maple syrup and it was delicious! What a treat, and sugar free!

I have done this one for years but I use 2ea 6” Pyrex bowls or 6” soufflé dishes and split the recipe between them. Otherwise everything is the same. I bake at 400 for about 15 minutes or until the sides have risen and browned on the top edges. I then fill the resulting little bowls with vanilla yogurt, fresh fruit, and real maple syrup. Then top it all off with toasted wheat germ, delicious and healthy.

Yuck- these did NOT turn out well.  I consider myself pretty proficient at cooking and baking as I used to be a professional pastry chef.  I don't know if it is the specific recipe or just the whole concept, but these were heavy and fairly flavorless.  I hate giving recipes less-than-enthusiastic reviews, but I tried this twice just to see if I had made some sort of error.  Both turned out flat and heavy and my toddler wouldn't even it it loaded with sweet stuff on top.  I added baking powder to the second batch and beat the eggs in my Kitchenaid, but even that didn't make this even in the same zip code as light....

Yum!  The first time I made these I followed the exact recipe and they were a little bland.  Last night I made the batter again and added a few spoonfuls of splenda, some cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and vanilla.  This morning I put a muffin pan in the oven and made individual servings (which worked perfect for the kids) then filled them with Sauteed Apples from this site and sifted some powdered sugar over them.  They were so good!  A dollop of whipped cream would have been delicious!  Fun recipe that looks impressive for very little work!

I've been making this for years. also called german pancakes. The weathre is a huge factor in the fluffiness, on beautiful sunny days with minimal humidity they turn out so big and bubbley and fluffy. Muggy days, flat. Doesnt depend on the ingreadients.

When you just have to have something quick for dinner, and don't have time for a run to the store, this fits the bill. With regular pantry items, you can create this really wonderful and tasty old fashioned breakfast treat and have it on the table from start to finish in under 25 minutes. I just put everything into my blender and  poured into the hot pan. A very smooth batter with no lumps. Great way to get eggs into one of my kids that doesn't ordinarily eat them also.

This was fabulous!!  I made it exactly as directed.. no additions of any kind.  I'm going to make it a favorite.  One note.. if the cooking time is up and it hasn't risen fully, leave it in a few more minutes, watching carefully.  It will puff beautifully!

For better batter with NO LUMPS... add the egg mixture to the flour it's much, much easier to get a smooth batter. It's the same technique you use when making a white gravy. Just add enough liquid to the flour so that it forms a soft paste, then continue adding the egg mixture a little at a time, stirring constantly until all the liquid has been incorporated. Voila! No lumps! These taste just like the Dutch Baby pancakes served at a popular breakfast place we go. I top mine with lemon juice and powdered sugar. I also used freshly ground whole wheat flour, and vanilla instead of nutmeg. You would NEVER guess these were whole wheat, they're so light and fluffy!

This is really good.  I made one with nutmeg and one with vanilla.  We liked the vanilla one better.  I took others suggestions and warmed the eggs and milk before mixing together.  I used a 9" round cake pan and baked it in the toaster oven.   Thanks for sharing Barbara!

There is a trick most folks don't know.
For a feather light high rise dutch baby,
use nonfat or lowfat milk.The heavy fat hinders
rise. ;)

Preheated oven to 400. In a glass measuring cup, set the eggs in warm water for 5 minutes. Put milk in a mug and heated for 10 seconds, added a splash of vanilla and the salt. Set a glass pie plate in the oven with 2 T. butter. In a medium bowl, whisked the flour.  Emptied the water out of the glass measuring cup and whisked the eggs by rolling the whisk between my hands until light and somewhat fluffy.  Poured the milk into the eggs and mixed.  Slowly poured the milk/egg mixture into the flour while mixing with the whisk to avoid lumps.  Poured it all back into the glass measuring cup. Poured the mixture into the pie plate and slid back into the oven. 18 minutes later .... perfect!

We love Dutch Babies!  The trick is to use a cast iron pan, make sure to pre-heat the oven (and then some) with the pan in it, and don't open the oven when it's cooking or it'll fall flat - just turn on the oven light and watch that way.  We also add 1 tsp. vanilla to the mix.  Yum!!

I made 3 of these for our New Year's brunch, the first as written and the others with revisions.  As written I would only give this 4 stars.  My revisions were to use my earthenware pie plates, slice an apple in the melted butter and lightly sprinkle that with cinnamon sugar mix.  These I started at 450, reduced to 425 just until they started to puff, then reduced again to 350 and baked for 30 more minutes.  There was no egginess and the apple mixture added texture and flavor.  Thank you, Barbara for pointing me in the right direction.

I have made these before but never taken the time to review. These are so good. I've never had trouble with them rising. This time I used my cast iron skillet, and warmed eggs and milk. It did get fluffier than in the past. I also added vanilla just because I love it. The thing to remember is they will deflate some when you cut into them and be more pancake like in places still so good! I topped with homemade apple butter and powedered sugar.

Made this for breakfast today...........wonderful!  Made it in a 9" round cake pan, next time I will spray the pan because it stuck a little to the bottom.Cooked in my advantium microwave/oven combo at 400 for around 15 minutes, then turned down to 325 due to the top getting too brown. Total time was around 20 minutes.   I also melted the butter in the pan while mixing up this dish, and added sliced apples and a touch of cinnamon sugar.  Definitely a keeper!

I love these things!  I call it German Pancakes though, and I've never put the nutmeg in.  I've tried this recipe using half whole-wheat pastry flour and it still tasted great.  I like to sprinkle lemon juice over the powdered sugar.  I use a glass pie pan to make this instead of a skillet.

Delicious and fun! Baked in a Pyrex pie plate and melted the butter in the pan while the oven was preheating. The butter turned brown, but did not affect the flavor. As per another reviewer, I warmed up the eggs for a few minutes in warm water and warmed the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds. I also added 1tsp of vanilla instead of nutmeg. Wow - the result was fantastic. I made it twice and it puffed up beautifully. It was delicious with a rich buttery flavor. We put powdered sugar on one and Nutella on the other. Yummy!

Very tasty- I added a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  It puffed up nice and high around the edges and was like custard in the middle.  We ate with jelly and some powdered sugar.  I really liked that this recipe was for 2... Cute!  I may try in a muffin tin next time to have small individual servings.

This is good and easy.  I liked the tiny bit of nutmeg but my husband didn't.  He prefers the Volcano Pancake from this website which is very similar (slightly higher proportion of eggs to milk and flour and no nutmeg) so I'll keep making that in the future, just made this one to try something different!

SOOO good!  I add fresh grated nutmeg when I have it for more flavor.  Also, I make it with Bobs Red Mill baking mix for my sister who needs it Gluten Free.  Turns out great.  No one knows it's GF.

I've been making these "big pancakes" for years, since my kids (now 41 and 37 years old) were little ones. I usually sprinkle them with fresh lemon juice when I take them out of the oven and then spread homemade strawberry or homemade raspberry jam on them and lastly sprinkle with confectioner's sugar. Yum-m-m-m-m! (orange marmalade is also tasty on them).

I made 2 of these... The first time I followed suggestions and put sliced peeled apples in e bottom of a 9x13pan sprinkled with cinnamon then placed 2-3 tablespoons butter in the pan. I put the pan in the oven at 425 while I made the batter. I substituted 1 tsp vanilla instead of nutmeg. Once the butter was melted I poured the batter in and baked for 20 minutes. Looooooved it!  The second batch I put the butter in a glass pie pan and let it melt in the oven. I made the batter then poured it in the glass pan and baked for 20 minutes.  So good! It was delicious either way! I will be making these again soon

Delicious! I made mine in a pyrex pie plate ( I didn't have a big enough iron skillet). My butter burned a bit as it warmed up in the oven, but didn't make a difference in the taste, I may wait to put the butter in next time. But thanks! I topped mine with butter powdered sugar and a squeeze of lemon and it was just perfect! Thanks so much!!

I make it all the time on weekends and I just love the light texture.  However, when I went home for Christmas (in the US) and made it for my parents, it was a completely different thing.  I guess the flour in the US has more gluten in it than flour in Japan.  Anyway, I like the Japanese version better, because the US version didn't rise and tasted pretty much like a giant pancake.

This is identical to a recipe I had years ago, but lost.  Thanks for posting it!  I love to fill the center of these with fruit.  Strawberries, peaches, or blueberries are good in the summer, and warm cinnamon apples in the winter.

This recipe is NOT complicated.. Use the iron pan, it's worth it.  Follow the directions, and they turn out perfect.  Just remember, if you are increasing the recipe, the butter does not need to be increased as it's just for keeping your Dutch Babies from sticking to the pan.

Made this using the tips about warming the eggs and milk first and it turned out just like the picture.  I made two, one in a glass pie pan and a second in a round cake pan, but baked them separately.  Both pan versions turned out equally well.  Served with a lemon wedge and powered sugar.  Yum!

Since my toddler is very picky, I decided to have her 'help' me cook.  I chose this recipe because I remembered being fond of it as a child, plus it was easy for her to pour all the pre-measured ingredients into the bowl.  She was fascinated with the "fluff" and ate it up!  Hooray!

Wow! These were amazing! I've made them twice so far-- the first time it puffed up beautifully, but the second time it didn't. However, both times the result was DELICIOUS!!! I have a gluten-free friend staying and am going to try and make this with gluten free flour... hope it goes well!

Once I found this recipe I have made it nearly every day of the week. It's healthy and versatile enough for my picky toddlers before preschool. I top with fresh fruit, yogurt and granola. And, I know they won't be hungry.  Only thing I do is double the recipe. It probably makes for a more solid pancake...but delish. I've made in the oven with apples, cinnamon and sugar I've sauteed but I just love the eggyness when done alone.

Fantastic! My toddler twin boys couldn't eat these fast enough! I've made several variations of this and this recipe is the one we like the best. We added powered sugar and lemon-LOVED it! Thank you! I don't have a cast iron skillet (well, I do but it's still in the box), so I just used a regular cermamic baking dish and it came out great.

This was great!   I baked it in a 9" pie plate.  I increased the butter to 1/2 a stick and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to it.  I didn't have nutmeg so I used 1 tsp of vanilla.  I love this recipe because it is so easy!!

I made these exactly as written, but didn't have a cast iron pan so used a 10" pie plate.  These were good...easy to make.  Tasted like a cross between a pancake a crepe.  I did warm up the milk for 30 sec in microwave and warmed eggs in hot water for 1 min.  It fluffed up beautifully in the oven.  I baked it for 12 min.  Easier to make than pancakes, but one would have to do this a few times for a crowd.

These pancakes are so close to my husbands grandmother who passed away. Not eggy at all. It's also similar as "Big Germans" by JEANIE BEAN, the only difference is the yield amount. I may also use an 8x8 baking pan if not using a cast iron;425 degree and baked it for 10-13 minutes until slightly brown and crispy. For the topping, I drizzled it with lemon icing (AR recipe by Carol) or Buttemilk syrup (another AR recipe), which by the way both were soooo good. And for those who had a problem with the sides browning first than the middle, try covering the sides with a foil and leave a 6x6 opening if using a 8x8 pan or loosely cover it with foil.

I ordered these at the Original Pancake house and these taste just as good.  Make sure your baking pan is hot, eggs are at room temperature and these will be basically no-fail. I omitted the nutmeg (didn't have it) and added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp sugar.

Reminds me of childhood.  My mother used to make this for special occasions. We always served them with powdered sugar and squeezed lemon on top. That was it.   She would mix these up in the blender. They were super light and fluffy. So when I followed this recipe, I used my blender instead of beating it.  Also it is very important to melt butter in the pan in the oven before pouring the dutch baby in.

PLUMS! Made this on a chilly fall day up in the mountains...great breakfast! Used the tips by reviewer gooddealmeg"-- piping hot pan, eggs & milk warmed. I baked 18min at 425. Perfect rise in oven, wonderful texture to eat. I lined the bottom of my buttered skillet with (firm) PLUM slices sprinkled with cinnamon and coarse sugar. A HIT! Top with powdered sugar and a small dollop of whipped heavy cream.

This recipe is great, quick and easy. I added bananas with a little brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the butter before I poured the batter in--tastie! I also added a little vanilla to the batter as was suggested by some reviewers. I'm going to try apples next time.

I just HAD to try them, the name is so cute!! 
My dutch boyfriend laughed when he heard the name, then said it tasted kinda like "eierkoeken" (which litterally means 'egg cakes') when he tasted it. It's fun to make and to eat!! Since I love it fluffy n sweet, the second time I made it I used a mixer to mix the eggs and added about 3-4 tablespoons of sugar n vanilla. It turned out so soft n fluffy for something so simple!!

I've made this several times and it always is a hit.  Changes: I used 3 eggs and 3/4 c flour and vanilla. I use my cast iron pan. The tip for rising that works for me is allowing the eggs and milk to be close to room temperature.

Very good and custardy.   I did as others suggested and started with room temperature eggs and milk.  Next time I might add apples on the bottom with cinnamon and sugar so when it's flipped out it looks pretty and has some additional layers of flavor.  I also used vanilla and no nutmeg.

I like that this is really easy to put together, but to me the taste of it is nothing to write home about. It's not like a pancake, but not like a bread, and hard to make into a sweet treat (which is what I wanted). I put cinnamon and sugar on mine. I probably won't make it again.

I have loved these since I was little - they're so delicious with fresh lemon and powdered sugar! I doubled the recipe, but still used a 10" pan, because I liked the idea of it being more dense. It still rose great, and was the perfect texture. I just had to cook it for about 16 minutes instead of 12. I also added a tbsp of granulated sugar and a tbsp of vanilla extract to the batter. Made for a yummy breakfast for me and my little boy this morning!

I made an apple pie filling to go inside.  Like others, I warmed up the eggs and milk before putting the batter together.  I don't know if it made a difference, but my dutch baby turned out amazing!  It was soooo easy.  I'll definitely be making this again and again and again and . . . well, you get the idea.

I've never had this type of pancake before so I didn't really know what to expect.  I read some of the reviews while it was baking and was afraid I might not like it but I did!  I loved it actually!  It was eggy so it reminds me of french toast.  My five year old son loved it too and even asked for seconds.  The only changes I made were using a glass pie plate (since I don't own a cast iron skillet), adding a dash of vanilla extract and maybe a couple of teaspoons of sugar to it (I didn't measure).  We put maple sugar over the top since we didn't have confectioners sugar.

Very good recipe. You can also pour the batter into aluminum pie plates. This way you still have to preheat the oven, but you don't have to pre-heat the plates. They'll conduct the heat just fine. Then I added chopped fruit and mixed fresh berries as a topping. Mmmm. Good for a special brunch. You can also squeeze half a lemon over it along with some brown sugar and cinnamon.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet.  I make these for dinner when I'm too lazy to do anything special.  It fools hubby every time because he thinks this is a super special meal!  This recipe is absolutely perfect and ridiculously easy.  We like ours nice and thin so I do them in an 8x11 pan.

Very yummy. This recipe was a hit. I do make it a bit bigger. 3 eggs, 2/3 cp milk, 2/3 cp flour - ect. I add vanilla and cinnamon and I bake for 22 min at 450. I also use evaporated milk since we never keep milk in the house.

These are a fun treat! to add a little fluff and texture, I whip the egg whites seperately and then fold them into the batter. We make these pancakes on special occasion mornings and top with agave nectar, home made buttermilk syrup or maple syrup...just cannot be beat!

These lack flavor in my opinion but you can add topping to them. I added sy rup and nutella. I will make these again. They are easy to make and use less counter space by cooking in the oven which I appreciate in my small kitchen.

It was fine. I think my skillet may be larger than 10 inches. I had too much butter (had to toss some while I was coating the pan) and after it was all said and done, the center of my Dutch baby was really thin, almost crisp (which, judging from the pictures, is not supposed to happen). I can't give it 5 stars (we did eat the whole thing) but I can't give it less than 4 either (hey, we did eat the whole thing!) because I cooked it and let it cool & refrigerated it for a few hours before reheating it in the microwave in slices to eat. That surely changes the intended method of consuming the recipe, so I can't knock it. I'll give it another shot with more servings and less wait between when it's done and when I eat it. For the technically minded: I got a great rise out of it using cold eggs. Your pan must be HOT. If you aren't using a cast iron skillet you may not be getting the thing hot enough. Go all out, use the cast iron skillet (miserable heavy things but worth the effort) or a metal cake pan. When you add the butter IT MUST SIZZLE or the pan is NOT HOT ENOUGH. And don't sit around with the hot pan out of the oven either. Butter it, batter it, put it right back in the oven, or it's going to get too cold too fast and your oven pancake will not rise. I served ours with sliced bananas and strawberry preserves on top instead of powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe, and I will make it again and revise this review if I find it 5-star then :)

I make these all the time.  They are so easy, so good and you can top them with whatever you want-----powdered sugar, syrup, fruit compote. I use 2 pie plates instead of a skillet.  Just so you know, each pie plate serves one in my house.  :) I skip the butter and use spray oil in my pie plates. Works like a charm.

Fun recipe!  Followed another reviewers advice and "warmed" my eggs and milk and then followed the recipe.  Takes a bit of time, but tasty result.

I agree that a little sugar and vanilla would add a little something to this recipe. I used to work at a restaraunt in Las Vegas called the Keuken Dutch. They served these 3 ways. Plain with powdered sugar and lemons, cinimon apple, and bacon spread with applesauce. When they came out of the oven we would literally have to run to the table yelling "Keuken out!!! Here comes your Keuken!!!" so it would get there before it went flat. What fun!!

I'm rating this a 5 for the delicious flavor. Like other reviewers, i substituted a little bit of cinammon for the nutmeg, and i also added about half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I have never had a dutch baby (are these truly Dutch? i grew up in a VERY PA dutch town and never had them - delicious!) and i was looking for a recipe that used only basic ingredients since i am abroad and it is hard to find alot of the baking ingredients we use in the states. This was unique and delicious. I made the "cinammon syrup" from this site to top the dutch babies (along with powdered sugar) and they tasted amazing. Will make again - thanks!

Very good. I made two of them, one with strawberries and the other with apples, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Next time I'll have to use less eggs.

I love this recipe! My mother used to make it for me as a kid. I kept trying to make it for days, trying all the techniques discussed in other reviews... eggs in hot water, warmed milk, still FLAT! Suddenly, I realized, the flour in my pantry has been there for a LONG time. Being a beginner cook, I decided to try new flour, that did the trick! Puffy and fabulous!
I like mine served with a little butter and warm honey. I also prefer a sprinkling of cinnamon with the nutmeg and a splash of vanilla extract in the batter recipe.
So easy and so good!

I first made these when I was in an 8th grade cooking class.  And believe me this is a wonderful dish.  I haven't thought about making these in years.  I saw the recipe and it looked like the one I learned  so thought about giving it a try.  It turned out great and had the same great taste I remember.  I went with the powdered sugar.  Sometimes we use a little maple syrup or jelly or jam.  These are wonderful.

I've made this many times and I think the best way to bake the pancake is in a cast-iron pan; even though a glass dish works, my babies didn't get as big and fluffy in them. I also prefer to double the eggs and blend everything quickly in a processor/blender.

these are definitely a keeper!  It took about 16 minutes to cook but lovely---just like English yorkshire pudding in a puffy pancake form.  We spinkled with icing sugar and cinnamon sugar---YUM!!  Oh yes--I ahve "discovered: Pam  high heat professional---WHAT A DIFFERENCE   You don't need to add ANY butter (real calorie saver)--or at least just BRUSH your pan if you want the taste.  the high heat Pam makes these things--AND my Yorkshire puddings REALLY rise----at last   PERFECTION!!!

I have used this same recipe for over 20 years.   But... with a few adjustments,  always with success.   
First,  take the butter and put it in the skillet and stick that in the oven to heat up as the oven preheats.  Mix the pancake together quickly,  as the butter will melt and start to scorch if you get distracted by the newspaper,  or making another pot of coffee!    I throw the rest of the ingredients in the blender and just whip them up in a flash.  As soon as the butter is melted and starting to turn brown in the skillet,  Pull it out and pour in the mixture.  It will start to set up right away,  pop it back in the oven.     While it's cooking I saute some apple slices in a little butter and cinnamon on the stove top.  They taste great spooned over the top of the pancake.    
This is such a hit that one pancake really only serves 3... So if I have company,  I double the recipe. And cook them in glass pie plates.  YUM

Great recipe.  This turned out puffy & yummy.  I took a hint from the sponge cake recipes, I used a blender to fluff the eggs before adding the rest of the batter ingredients into the blender.  This helped the rise quite a bit in the oven and saved a lot of time.

I made this baby for for my special someone on Valentines' Day weekend. I don't have cast iron skilet, so I used 8" round baking pan instead. It turned out beautifully! For the final touch, I topped it w/ strawberries sweetened with sugar, dusted some powdered sugar, and sprinkled toasted almonds. It look really elegant and like something you took much time to prepare. We totally gobbled it up in no time. Will definately make it again!!

I've never had this before, and I LOVED it!  It gets puffy and slightly crispy around the outside while staying soft and custardy in the middle.  I skipped the powdered sugar and topped mine with sliced apple, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I can't wait to make this again.

My Grandmother called this Auf Lauf... This recipe is great!  I (like my Grannie) put the cast iron skillet in the hot 425 degrees preheated oven with the butter. Wait until the butter melts and wait another minute or 2.  It turns into browned butter. Yum.  Open the oven just long enough to pour the batter into the skillet.  Close the oven and bake until browned about 12-15 minutes.  *Important:  Start with eggs and milk that are room temperature to lukewarm.  It puffs better!

I made this pancake for the first time today.  Had all of my ingredients at room temperature which I think contributed to the success of this recipe.
As someone else mentioned I added vanilla in lieu of the nutmeg and served it with scalloped apples.
I did use the cast iron skillet and it came out perfectly, not to mention, delicious!  this not a sweet pancake until you either dust it w/sugar or serve with some kind of fruit or syrup.
This is definitely a repeat recipe.  Loved it.

Doubled the recipe, swapped the nutmeg for 1 tsp vanilla, and baked in a 12 inch cast iron skillet for about 20 minutes. Turned out beautiful and delicious just as I had hoped! Will be making again- the family including 2 picky kids loved it!!

Great recipe!  I would recommend preheating the pan.  My Dad found Dutch Babies in Sunset Magazine in the 70s and would make it every Easter Sunday... we weren't religious but we appreciated that it would rise.

do you want this to "rise high"?, they make sure eggs& milk are ROOM temperature.And..use bread flour, not AP,not cake, BREAD flour then this will become the spectacular dish you're wishing for (do not use convection on your oven either) add warm maple syrup, or an apple,brown sugar, pecan topping with a shake of powdered sugar..perfection

Good recipe, I never cook but since my wife is a superb cook thank goodness I don't have to. She just got the new IPad 3 and wanted to try the IPad, the recipe and me out all at the same time we went for an old favorite of ours----the Dutch baby pancake. We modified your recipe by the following substitutions:
     A teaspoon of vanilla for the nutmeg
     A 1/2 cup of buttermilk instead of milk

Net result was very tasty but we didn't get the big rise like the ones they serve at the Original Pancake House (not IHOP). We think our Kitchen Aide oven is on the weak side so for the last 5 min. we boosted the heat to 450.

my husbands grandmother used to make these under a different name for him all the time. I was very excited when I found the recipe, I used some of the other reviewers suggestions - they came out fluffy but flattened a bit once out of the pan. they still tasted great and my husband was so happy!

This is so good! I like mine with just powdered sugar, but I've also topped with a strawberry sauce which was awesome too. I have made this several times and used room temp eggs and milk. Once I was out of butter and used olive oil instead and it worked but it wasn't near as tasty!

I have made this recipe for my kids every Sunday morning for the past 20 years. The way I make it is:

2 eggs 
1/2 cup flour 
1/2 milk 
1 tsp suger 

Whip in blender.

Melt 2 TBS butter in each of two 9" pie plates in oven as it warms to 400 degrees. Once the butter starts to brown, take pie plates out and swirl butter around the sides. 

Evenly divide batter between the two pans and bake @ 400 degress until dark gold and crispy on edges and very puffy. 

This way you have two seperate, individual servings.

Top with canned cherry pie filling and powdered suger.

Always a hit!

So delicious and easy to make!! These taste just like the ones my mom used to make but with easier instructions.  If you don't have a cast iron skillet, a pie dish works great. The only things I change are preheating to 425 with the skillet in the oven (still turns out great without the original 475 temp), and I add a few drops of vanilla.

Made this for brunch today.  It was delicious.  I mixed it in the blender.  Also, instead of topping with powdered sugar, I cooked mixed berries with sugar and cornstarch (to thicken) and put on top.  Yum-O!  The only trouble I had was I cut it right when it came out of the oven, and it fell completely flat.  Maybe I should have waited a few minutes??  Tasted fabulous though either way!

Just made these and they were an instant hit! I did make a few changes: used a dutch oven instead of a skillet (bit of a warning: the center takes longer to cook this way); I'd run out of butter, so I used vegetable oil to grease the pan; lined the bottom of the pan with two granny smith apples, thinly sliced and tossed with 1 tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg (I subbed the nutmeg in the recipe with 1 tsp vanilla), and 1/8 cup of sugar, then poured the batter on top. It came out fluffy and beautiful on my first try, so I'm very impressed. Besides, my bf (who never eats breakfast) had two slices, right when he woke up! That alone makes this recipe worth it.

The secret to success is indeed warmed milk and warmed eggs. Like the other reviewer , I zapped the milk for 30 seconds in the microwave while I let the eggs warm in hot tap water. I have used duck and goose eggs with this recipe for even more spectacular results! I could see using this as a "crust" for spinach or asparagus and cheese and I have rhubarb that I am going to compote and use as filling.Thank you for the recipe.

Followed all of 'gooddealmeg's suggestions and they were great.  It's so exciting to watch these puff up.  They are filling, and I have mini cast iron skillets, so I make one per person in each.  I usually add in 1/4 - 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of the nutmeg (personal preference and what I have at home), and love to serve this with 2 spoonfuls of jam and a spoonful of water, microwaved to make a sauce. My other favorite thing to do when apples are in season is to dice an apple, sprinkle with cinnamon and a few squirts of maple syrup and to microwave for a minute, stir, microwave for another minute then throw on top of the baked Dutch baby.

I took the advice of others for a few mods.  Added a splash of vanilla.  Put peeled apple slices sprinkled with sugar and brown sugar on the bottom of the pan.  Baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  Yum - a new favorite!  Be sure to whip those eggs into an absolute fluffy cloud for best results.

I'd give this more stars, but mine always "deflates" right after I take it out of the oven.  Could be because I use a glass pie pan instead of a cast iron skillet.  Still, it tastes good and no one complains about it being flat.

I made this recipe and it turned out just like I remembered it from years ago.  I did just a couple things different - Mixed my dry ingredients together, beat eggs slightly and then added the milk.  I added the flour and whisked it together with a gravy whisker but it probably could be done in a blender.  I heated my skillet up - melted the butter and coated the sides.  I kept my skillet on the heat and let the mixture start bubbling and then put it in the oven - This worked perfectly! yumm

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was completely flat.  Next time, I will try to warm up the ingredients to see if it will fluff up properly.  Other than that, it tasted good. :)

We usually get this at a local pancake restaurant & its one of my kids' favorites. Tried this at home & they loved it even more! I doubled it but still only used 2T butter, which was more than enough & cooked for 20 mins instead of 12 which was perfect. Served with the powdered sugar and apricot jam with strawberries--yum! and so much easier than doing individual popovers, my usual "special" breakfast. Great recipe!

Hmmm...Not sure what to make of this. It wasn't what I expected it to be like which was more of a fluffy pastry like sort of dish, but its not bad! Dense and custurdy like center....light and and bread like outter edges. Kind of bland so you really need to add the sugar.  Next time I make this I will for sure dice up a few apples and saute them with cinnamin and sugar and put them in the bottom of the dish before poring in mixture to bake. I think that will make a nice addition to this.

Never had these but they were delicious, reminded me of crepes my Grandma used to make.  The recipe wasn't enough for 4 so I'll have to double it next time.  I used a glass bakeware pan and added a bit of almond extract mmmmmm.

This sounds like what I grew up on as what we called Hoe Cakes - thick pancake batter similar to cornbread batter - cooked in an iron skillet on top of the stove resulting in a 2-3" cake - but served with maple syrup and butter.   Loved that Great Southern Food!  But, unfortunately can't do it any longer!

This recipie was very good.  I made it a little differently.  I added a couple to tablespoons of sweetner and used the vanilla idea rather than nutmeg.  I also increased the recipe, which was very easy since it's just 1/4 c per egg.  I split the batter into two of the 6" corning dishes.  Then I had some frozen berries, so I put them in a blender with 1/4 c. sweetner and made a puree to top the babies with.  These were really very good.  My husband wanted more but assumed they were a lot of work so told me not to bother.  I told him nothing was too good for him, and made him some more.  Now I have brownie points accumulated.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

Made this for brunch for my husband and I. Followed ingredients exactly (maybe a pinch more nutmeg and no confectioner's sugar) and baked in in a pre-heated baking sheet instead of a cast-iron skillet. I followed other reviewers' recommendations about warming up the eggs and milk to room temp (soaked eggs in warm water for 2 mins, and warmed up milk in microwave to room temp). My husband loved it and only complained about me not making more! lol. We both ate it with a little feta and plain yogurt for a savory flavor and i added a little maple syrup. Will definitely make again in a larger batch; this was a little slim for 2 servings.

I decided to make dutch babies for the first time and this recipe was perfect!  I did add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp vanilla to the batter per other reviewers, but I don't think it's necessary now that we've tried it.  Topped the individual slices with apple cinnamon syrup and we loved it!  The crispy and buttery edges were the BEST!  Hubster wants to try it with savory toppings next time, so we're looking forward to that!  Thank you for this great recipe!  It's a keeper!  :)

I'm giving this recipe 4 starts for the following reasons:  i followed the recipe exactly and it did puff up as it was supposed to (so that was good), i did like the 'eggy' texture, but there really wasn't anything special about this recipe...it didn't really have much flavour. It rose, but by the time I stick my fork in it had already fallen and I was left with a droopy, unexciting, mediocre pancake. They do taste very good when drenched in syrup or some sort of dressing...but that is just because the dressing tastes so good, not necessarily this recipe. I probably won't make these again, but i won't discourage others from trying it...i am glad that i did.

Truly a great recipe -- one I inherited from my grandmother. I generally serve with some sauteed apples (with butter, nutmeg, dash of orange juice and brown sugar), sometimes just a little pure maple syrup.  So simple to prepare, but with MAJOR "tah-dah!" value!  Enjoy!

Fantastic! I didn't have any nutmeg on hand so I added a good dash of allspice and ground cloves, a pinch of cinnamon, and the 1 tsp. vanilla suggested in another review. With a good heaping of powdered sugar on top, the taste is wonderful and subtle! I didn't get it to rise very much, although I followed the advice to get the eggs and milk to room temperature, but I will be experimenting in the future...

Perhaps it's just me. This is the first time I have made "Dutch Babies" and, honestly, I have never tried them before. How are they really supposed to look and taste. I read all sorts of descriptions, but different people describe them differently. Anyhow, I followed the directions making no changes whatsoever, and, in the end, it tasted just like an egg custard pie without the crust. I'm not sure if they are really supposed to taste and look that way or not. The one I made was fluffy and pretty when it came out of the oven, but by the time I had sprinkled powdered sugar on it, it had collapsed. Anyhow, I didn't see anything too special about the finished product. I won't say it was good or bad. Consider my opinion relatively "neutral" --no strong feelings in either direction. By all means -- try it at least once and then you will know whether or not it is your "cup of tea"

This is somewhere between an ommelette, a pancake and a Yorkshire pudding....tastes very good.  My husband just ate his kina quickly and announced when he was finished that we could have those again!  Made as written, but used a cake pan instead of a skillet as none of my skillets are oven friendly.  Served with baked apples.

This was great and my kids LOVED it. I doubled the recipe (except the butter - 2 T was more than enough) and made it in a 9 x 13 pan. I slightly warmed the eggs and milk together and melted the butter in the oven. Also used 1 tsp vanilla instead of nutmeg.

I am obsessed with these!  I get up extra early just so I don't have to share.  I follow the recipe exactly, and use the other reviewer's suggestion to warm the milk and egg.  I put the eggs in a cup of hot tap water, and microwave the milk for 20 seconds.  I use an 8 inch non-stick fry pan (all-clad) and it puffs right up.  Don't forget to turn your oven down or you will over cook the poor thing!

These are easy and tasty!  I found that the edges were a bit puffy/crunchy, and the middle had the texture of a crepe. I halved the recipe for a smaller cast iron skillet and it worked out just fine.

Very good basic recipe. I used whole wheat flour, and didn't dust with confectioners sugar. Instead, I mixed 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, 1 tablespoon of corn starch and two tablespoons of honey and simmered for 15 minutes as a topping. Very good!

This recipe has become a family tradition on Christmas mornings, lazy Saturday mornings, or a special treat for guests.   It comes out different each time -- custard in the middle and pastry-like on the edges --more one way or the other each time.   

This MUST be paired with the right topping.  We love it topped with Orange Sauce for Crepes recipe, but have also tried an apple-maple-sausage topping as well.  The rasperry jam and lemon squeeze combo sounds good too.  Powdered sugar is a great finish; put the powdered sugar in a small strainer to serve easily.

I also use glass baking dishes rather than iron skillets.  Doubling the recipe is fine.  You can split into two pans, or make it in one large pan, in which case it doesn't rise as much on the edges.  Experiment and enjoy!

This is my second review of this recipe.  I make it in my grandmothers iron skillet. My grandchildren request it every time they visit. It rises like a souffle but does fall when you take it out of the oven.  I bake it at 425 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes and it is a delight to eat. We still dust it with powdered sugar and put homemade blueberry syrup (with lots of berries) on it occasionally. It is yummy. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was okay, but not outstanding. Mine looked nothing like the photo - the 'pancake' bubbled up rather scarily in the skillet. We had it with banana that I sliced, then warmed through in a pan with butter and brown sugar. I probably won't make this again - too much effort for mediocre results.

So easy and very few ingredients. I added vanilla and cinnamon, baked for 20 min in a baking pan and it came out so custardy delicious. Sorta reminded me of a bread pudding. Im adding this to my breakfast menu.

I have made three times and each time they are a huge hit. Today, on Christmas day, I thought they would be a perfect treat for our holiday breakfast. I read the reviews and decided to try an experiment. I heated the eggs and the milk as one reviewer suggested and made two separate batches, one in my traditional 10 inch iron pan and the other in the 9 inch cake pan that a reviewer had suggested. As you can see from the picture, the iron frying pan version turned out much more beautiful and pouffy (even tho it had started to fall when I snapped the photo). I also used nutmeg for the one and vanilla for the other as a reviewer had suggested. Hands down, we liked the savory aspect of the nutmeg version over the vanilla version.

quick, easy and so good! I made this and drizzled warm nutella on w chopped pecans and sliced bananas. Very simple dessert with so many options. For anyone who is too intimidated to make crepes this would be perfect, as it was for me!!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly EXCEPT I added a spoonful of sugar as suggested in one of the many reviews, and I sprinkled it with white sugar instead of icing sugar because I have a handy sugar shaker.  I used a pyrex pie plate.  We tried it with and without maple syrup.  It was delicious.    Next time I will leave out the sugar for a more savoury approach.  Definitely will make again.

This was a great recipie, I loved it. The only changes I made was I gave it 5 extra minutes in the oven, and for the last 2:30secs I flipped it around in the oven so it would cook evenly. The changes I didn’t make that I wish I did is only using 1 tbsp of butter, as 2 tbsps was way to much, and using nonstick cooking spray, as it is hard to get out of the skillet. This is a delicious recipe over all, and I would definitely recommend it, and make it again.

I've made this many times and have perfected it. A few key things: eggs at room temperature, a few hours will do it. Milk can be microwaved 15-20 seconds or pour it when you pull out the eggs. Best with sliced apples, sauté'd with butter and cinnamon before pouring in batter. Blueberries also work but don't precook, just toss in the bottom before batter.  I use a blender to combine all ingredients and also use vanilla as someone suggested. With a hot pan, 25 minutes at 425 deg. seems to work well. These remind us of a Dutch themed restaurant we used to go to 25 years ago called the Pannekoeken Huis. Very yummy!

I used to make theses all the time in 80s, but we called them "Baked German Pancakes".  Love the nutmeg in this recipe.  I also like to squeeze some fresh lemon over the powdered sugar...it gives it a great flavor that helps cut the sweetness.  Thanks for reintroducing them to me.

I see a lot of changes to the recipe and it makes me wonder. I stir in the milk and the eggs. Then I add the flour a little at a time. I add the salt, nutmeg and stir it all together. I take the heated skillet from the oven put the butter in and smear it all over the pan. Then our in the batter, back in the oven for 13 minutes. Perfect. I've made it in northern Minnesota at our family cabin, at my daughters in St Louis Park, MN and in Florida at our home. Works the same everywhere. My only problem is the oven temperature consistency. But I can always adjust to make it perfect. Thanks for the wonderful, easy recipe.

I made the Chef John recipe before coming across this one, I like this recipe a lot more. To begin, I always bring the eggs and milk to room temperature. I put the eggs in a cup of warm water and set the milk on top of the oven. I also add ground vanilla bean to the flour, which adds a nice touch. When I take it out of the oven, I sprinkle some lemon juice on top (this is from the Chef John recipe) and a little powdered sugar. It comes out aaamazing  every time.

For toppings: Maple syrup, any jams, whipped cream. 
For quick homemade whipped cream, I chill a mixing bowl and whisk or beaters in the freezer for 10 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons powdered sugar to 1 cup of heaving whipping cream and whipped till it has stiff peaks.  Last time I made this, I added ground vanilla bean too. Best.whipped.cream.ever.

Sometimes I'll make a strawberry glaze. Cut up 2 cups of strawberries, add 1/4 cup sugar,  1.5 tsp cornstarch and 1/8 cup cold water in a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir till it boils and is clear. Remove from heat and stir 1/3 tablespoon butter and 2/3 teaspoon lemon juice.

One hint that may help if this is not turning out as pictured- let the batter rest 15-20 minutes before baking.

Oh my goodness!  This was sooo good. Got the recipe by email and made it this morning. I didn't change any thing, used eggs right from the fridge, forgot to sift the flour and used 3 tbsp butter only because that's the portion size I had.   No syrup. Very easy and delicious.  My husband loved it, too. Will most definitely make it again.

I've made this over a dozen times now and it's come out perfectly every time except once (when it didn't rise).  Don't skip the cast iron skillet- it's just not the same made in any other dish! 
Five stars for both taste and ease of making it. I followed the recipe exactly, including using cold milk and eggs right out of the fridge, and it was very easy, very tasty and made a beautiful presentation.  I was not sure about the powdered sugar and lemon serving suggestion, but it works. My 3  y.o. put maple syrup on his. I had no trouble with it rising on this clear, dry day.

I followed the suggestion of a few and warmed up my eggs and milk before starting the recipe, as well as adding a dash of vanilla. I also lowered the heat to 350 and cooked in a cast iron pan for 17 minutes. 

Next time I will use a finer ground of salt as I kept biting into pockets of Kosher salt which was a bit gritty. I can't imagine sharing this with another person as I gobbled this entire recipe up by myself!! It puffed up magically and was SO delicious. It tasted like crepes, and I dusted the  out of it with powdered sugar. 

Will have to stock up on lemons next time so that I can eat it the way it's "normally" served, but I found this recipe spot on!

I have always been using this recipe for the longest time. I think this recipe is great and I rarely get results of the oven pancake being so flat. I tend to add a bit of sugar and vanilla extract to it just to make it sweet for breakfast. It seems that almost anyone can get great results from this recipe.

This recipe is the best, I substitute cinnamon for the nutmeg but otherwise I make it exactly as it says. It is easy, impressive looking a so good. I use maple syrup and butter like a traditional pancake. I have found you get the best puffiness using the whisk on my hand stick blender.

Delicious. Crispy edges. Soft and fluffy center.  Made some adjustments as suggested by some of the top reviews.  1) Room temp eggs and milk. Soaked eggs in hot tap water for 2-3 minutes. Microwaved milk for 20 seconds. 2) added 1 tsp of vanilla instead of nutmeg.  3) baked at 400 for 20 mins.

This is a great recipe! My take is to beat the eggs and mix them into the flour. Then slowly add the milk/water mix. Before I start, I let ALL the ingredients warm to room temperature. No one has ever gotten sick off Dutch Babies... and, if they did, Fox News would be all over it. The batter is a lot like Yorkshire Pud... don't bother it AT ALL while in the oven. 

The only other thing I do is to heat the skillet on high heat on the stove, add the batter (on the stove) for 1 minute, then transfer to a super hot oven. The recipe says 375 degrees F. But, I've learned that it depends on your oven. 

I see a review stating vanilla, which I may plan tomorrow... this is a huge breakfast deal in my extended family.

Mine turned out great! I didn't have a cast iron pan, but I use a glass pie pan. I didn't even use syrup,  I used a little extra powder sugar, and lemon! So great next time I think I might double the recipe and make two!

Very important tip: Don't use the convection setting as the pancake will not rise as much.  My Dutch Baby came out just perfect using this recipe.   I used a 10" glass pie pan instead of a cast iron skillet and it worked just fine. This was my favorite, but I just tried another recipe, (Chef John's Dutch Babies), with 3 eggs, 2/3 cup of milk, and 1/2 cup of flour and that was lighter and rose higher. At 425 degrees, it was done in 12-13 minutes, (using either recipe).

Well this was a pleasant surprise.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 12 inch cast iron skillet.  Used cold milk and cold eggs.  The pancake puffed up beautifully.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

The best thing about this recipe is the deliciousness and simplicity of it. I find that this is perfect for cold mornings and it comes out perfect every time! I think if it is slightly less browned around the rim of the "baby" that it reached its peak. I enjoy this with lemon and powdered sugar, and sometimes with maple syrup.

So far, room temperature eggs and vanilla instead of nutmeg have been the best alterations to make it fluffier and tastier. Also, The simplified version of simply preheating a 9x13 baking dish, then melting the butter directly in it, then simply adding the batter and baking has worked just fine (it's supposed to be a quick and easy dish) and saved a lot of time and dirty dishes.

HOWEVER, a tasty addition I learned in class was sprinkling a bit of lemon/lime juice along with the powdered sugar. DELIICIOUS.

So Good! I never had a Dutch Baby and wanted to try one and picked this recipe. Very good and so easy to make. It's light and somewhat custardy and just absolutely delicious. Great Grandmother knew what she was doing and I'm happy you shared her recipe!

This was simple and beautiful. I added apples, and so I sautéed them in butter with a little raw cane sugar,and cinnamon, as well as a pinch of cardamon,salt and nutmeg. I made the batter as suggested and poured it over the apples and stuck it in the oven. It was gorgeous and delicious. I didn't have to heat the cast iron becuase the apples were cooked on the stove in it already. I see no need to have eggs at room temp, I've made lots of these dutch babies, and fresh eggs is what you should use if possible. That is what makes a difference.

I see these on menus every so often and never get them b/c they seemed so much more marked up than even regular pancakes.  Since I was craving something to go with my maple syrup and the ingredient list for dutch babies was shorter than for pancakes, I gave it a go.  First though, I read a bunch of the reviews, and it appears that the moon and stars have to line up correctly for these to turn out right.  So I figure I'd just give it a go...I halved the recipe, heated up the milk for 20 secs and threw the egg in there to warm up while I prepped the rest.  No measuring, no expectations....figured the dogs would get a late night snack if nothing else.  I followed the directions with the oven temp, but I used muffin tins, and it worked out...perfectly.  If it's of any interest, it's freezing outside and I assume humid, b/c it's always humid in these parts.  Texture is as many described...sort of custardy...like the inside of a french toast?  Flavor is very neutral.  I'm glad that I was able to make these, so now I won't queue up for 45 min at those fancy brunch places.

I use three eggs total and a tablespoon of sugar for this recipe.  No nutmeg.  Bake in an 8 x 8 inch pan.  400 degrees for eight minutes and 325 degrees for three minutes.  My kids used to call these "giant pancakes" when they were little!  I call them delicious!

I used an 8x8 pan, and the butter was WAY too much. Even though the pastry puffed up (I whisked the eggs a lot before I baked it), when it sank back down, some parts were super dense and moist on the bottom because of the butter. And I have to say, with the powdered sugar, it tastes like fair food, in particular, funnel cake (the ingredients are almost identical). I think the fact that the recipe uses so much butter gives it that fried food taste. I wouldn't really call this a breakfast food; it's more of a light dessert. Of course, I guess that's how most American breakfasts are these days. :)

These were yummy!  I subbed oat flour (oats in my food processor) for the wheat flour because my son is allergic to wheat.  They didn't puff in the oven, but I think the end result was the same.  Dusted with powdered sugar & drizzled with syrup.  Really nice to be able to make something wheat free like this that the whole family enjoys.

Waaaay easy and delicious!  Just made it this morning for a late breakfast.  Used a 13x9 baking dish.  Perfection!  Served with powdered sugar and warm maple syrup for dipping.  Thanks for sharing.

I make these in muffin tins. I make half of them sweet and the other half savory. Super easy and everyone loves them!  For sweet I add apples or jam in the centers after cooked. For savory I've used garlic, basil, cheeses, diced ham. Many different combos for savory. Breakfast or dinner always a hit!

Adjusted the recipe due to other reviews.  I added one extra egg and also an extra tablespoon of butter per pan.  Neither adjustment was necessary.  The recipe is perfect as it is for use with a cast iron skillet that is properly seasoned.  If you are using anything other than a seasoned cast iron skillet then I suppose the extra butter to float the batter in would be necessary.  The extra egg simply made the "fluff" higher than necessary.  Will make again and again.

It came out perfectly soft but crispy around the edges. These things are a delight to eat. I think dusting with powdered sugar and squeezing fresh lemon juice it perfect for dessert or breakfast. Definately recommend.

I think this needs a little tweaking to suit my tastes. It is a little bland so I think it needs a tad of vanilla, and maybe some brown sugar in the batter before it gets cooked. Give it a little more depth of flavor. Warming the eggs worked great and it turned out good with powdered sugar and lemon juice on top. I will make it again with the above changes.

Just made this - added a splash of vanilla and a sliced apple in the pan before I cooked it. SOOOOO good! And super easy. This is a new breakfast favorite due to the few ingredients and super easy process. LOVE love it.

VERY EASY to make...

I teach middle school kiddos and this was SIMPLE. The butter part however, needs to be UPDATED. ONLY ADD ENOUGH to grease your bottom pan so that it doesn't stick. 2tb is WAY to much. Melt JUST ENOUGH so that your pan is buttered.

Fun and easy for the whole family!

My husband has made these for years. He wasn't home and I wanted to make it for the kids. I just needed the measurements. He's always put all the ingredients in the blender and just gave it a good 30 seconds to get really fluffy before it goes in the oven. That's what I did and it came out just perfect. :) I doubled the recipe with no problem at all and we use a dutch oven. I have also done these in cupcake pans for individual Dutch Baby's for company or when ALL the kids are home and that works too. :) This recipe is a staple.
If its not rising super high, its not done yet. It gets really puffy at the end, so be patient. :)

These are delicious. I made as directed but added a splash of vanilla. I had the eggs and milk at room temp. It really was a thing of beauty. I wish we had taken a picture. It was much like a crepe that was crispy at the edges. Will make these again and again.

I don't like nutmeg so I took it out and also cut the butter back to just 1 Tablespoon.  I cut up some strawberries and put them on top after baking.  Delicious!  I've also made it will one cup of freshly washed blueberries added to the batter before baking!

This was great, turned out perfectly. I did use a glass pie pan instead of cast iron skillet and it worked well - same temp instructions, etc. I also accidentally doubled the flour, so had to double the recipe and there were no ill effects :) 
Oh, also brought the first round of ingredients to room temp (but not the second set, in my disappointment at my measuring snafu)
This was lighter than other dutch baby recipes I've tried - sometimes there will be a thicker, eggy bottom, but this was delishiously thin with the puffed up sides fluffy/airy. Thanks for the recipe.

This dutch baby is very good.  You can add anything to it to make it better but it is already awesome. We added fresh whipping cream and maple syrup on top.  This is the best recipe our whole family has ever tasted we will make this weekly.

This was an easy breakfast dish to put together but for some reason I didn't get the volume I had hoped for.  The flavor was OK but the toppings are what made it for us.

I've made two batches of this. The first batch I made exactly as directed, but added 1 teaspoon vanilla. It ended up thin and somewhat crunchy, nothing like the Dutch Babies my mom used to make. The second batch, I added a third egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla -- and it turned out perfect. If your eggs are on the smaller side, use a third egg! Mine baked perfect in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes!

It puffed up and looked great, but before I even pulled it out of the oven, it flatened out.   It tasted good, but it wasnt anything special.  I wont make it again.

I took some tips from gooddealmeg and used a 9” pan.  Omitted nutmeg, I love nutmeg but not in this type of recipe.  I used vanilla but honestly, at one teaspoon, it was too much for my taste and will cut it down to ½ teas today.  I also warmed the eggs under temped water, warmed the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds and preheated the pan in the oven.  

My oven tends to run a little hot so I kept a very close eye on it and it was done in 10 minutes baked at 475.  Perhaps a little too well done though not burned, it was on the edge of being burned.  Will make this again today. 

The only reason I rate four stars is due to changing the original recipe.  Otherwise it is a five star recipe as far as taste and easy preparation goes.

Fast and easy, these make a wonderful addition to the weekend breakfast lineup.  Tired of the usual pancake/oatmeal/egg/waffle/french toast rotation?  Try this.  It takes only minutes to make, tastes incredible topped with macerated fresh berries, and some homemade whipped cream!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a heavy-gague, high-sided, 10-inch round cake pan.  I used bacon grease instead of oil.  Soooooooo awesome!

This recipe has it all:  simplicity & taste.  Really, all you need is the 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup flour, and butter to stop it from sticking and the rest is to taste.  Try it with cinnamon sugar & maple syrup.

I made this recipe exactly as is (cast iron) and it came out perfect! I don't see how this recipe is complicated at all and even more, I don't see how using a 9x13 baking dish simplifies this dish any more than it already is. It was quick and simple and my kids were sent to school with a fully belly!  Thanks for this recipe! :)

Oh my goodness!  These have to be about the easiest thing I have ever made...and they are so good!  I prepared them exactly like the recipe stated.  My husband and I just love them.  We like them just plain with powdered sugar sprinkled over the top or topped with fresh fruit.  I have given this recipe to several people.

I have never had a Dutch Baby before, so I am rating this on taste and ease, and it definately deserves a 5 star for that.  Don't know if it is an authentic Dutch Baby, but it is a VERY delish breakfast dish.   And it is super easy.   I do not own a cast iron skillet, so I used a glass deep dish pie plate and it puffed up beautifully.   My only other change was to follow some other reviewers and put the butter in the dish in the oven while it was heating.   But don't put it in right away, it will get too dark.  Great recipe!

I was VERY disapointed in this recipe. I tried several of the tips suggested by other reviewers (warming the eggs and milk) but they came out very eggy tasting and quite dense. I don't think I'll be making these again!

OK, even though I altered this a bit I'm giving it 5*s cause it's so delicious!!!  I did add 2tb powdered sugar and a 1tb of lemon juice to the batter.  I did it in a Dutch Oven b/c that's the only cast iron I have and even though it stuck to the bottom a bit, even with all the butter somehow, it tasted SO GOOD that it didn't matter that it was a little bit mangled.  The crispy buttery edges were THE BEST!!!  Used fresh grated nutmeg and really good quality organic butter that tastes SO BUTTERY and I think that truly MADE this so superior.  Only needed maple syrup, and not much at that because it was so flavorful on its own!  Made with Swedish Pancakes for a Pancake-O-Rama and these were the favorite =)  Will make TIME AND TIME again!!!

I have had this recipe saved for a while and just made it. My husband is a pancake and crepe fan but I am not. However, I love these because they are a cross between the two. They are light and fluffy and are wonderful either paired with savory or sweet fillings. I personally recommend trying it with vanilla pudding with unsweetened strawberries and semi swee mini chocolate chips lightly sprinkled. This works as a breakfast,dessert or snack item it is so versatile. Good for times when time is limited.

I rated this recipe only 3 stars because without adding stuff to it, like cinnamon, vanilla, maple syrup or white sugar, it's a little bland.  I made two seperate batches.  The first one I made per recipe and it wasn't all I was hoping for (my boys didn't like it).  I felt like it was missing a little something.  The second batch I added vanilla and cinnamon and a teaspoon or so of sugar and topped with maple syrup and that helped.  Next time I'm going to try the lemon and sugar thing, maybe that's the key.  It is like a thin custard in the center.  It was very pretty, the recipe just needs a little adjusting.

looks so special, but SO easy to make. Our local restaurant charges $9 for a dutch baby, but this cost less than $1 to make. Still cant believe how wonderful and tasty this turned out. Making it again tomorrow morning to try more toppings.

These are wonderful!  We have a restaurant in town that serves these with a wide variety of toppings, including something similar to chicken ala king or a pot pie.  So I use this recipe and do the same.  So versatile for sweet or savory.  A unique dessert for a dinner party, who would expect a "pancake".   Since I do not care for nutmeg, if I am making this for a desert, I substitute a touch of cinnamon or vanilla.  For savory I normally do not add any flavoring, but if the meat and veggies going on top are mild, I have occasionally used a touch of lemon extract.  So easy to change around and make it your own. THANK YOU!!!

I had never heard of these until two days ago.  I lowered the heat to 400 and baked them for 20 mins - to avoid the eggy flavor some mentioned.  They were dreamy.  Also - I made a sauce for them that a friend recommended - 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar - cooked on stove until sugars melt.  Yummmy.

I made these for my sisters-in-law and it was a big hit.  My only complaint is that even though they puffed up nicely, they fell flat by the time I put it on a plate on the table. Maybe a little eggier than I thought it would be.   We made it with thinly sliced apples, which was a nice touch.

Very tasty (I used vanilla instead of nutmeg and I think that helped add some flavor) and very pretty. Would be delicious served with strawberries and whipped cream which is what I plan to do next time.

The only change I made was adding cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and it turned out great! I think a cast iron pan is great for this.  This is a great quick, fun treat.

So happy to find this recipe - I had it over 30 years ago - after it came out of the oven I squeezed a lemon on it and then sprinkled with powdered sugar - served with fruit on top! Wow it is very impressive.

This is such an easy recipe. I made sure everything was at room temperature before I started, and I also cut up an apple and lined the bottom of the pan with it. They wound up floating in the batter and I was worried that they would affect the way it would raise, but it still raised beautifully. The maple syrup really makes this a pancake. I highly recommend adding some fruit to it so it isn't bland. Thanks for the recipe!

These were fantastic!!!!  I made them exactly as directed, but did add a teaspoon of vanilla and warmed the eggs and milk, as suggested.  They look and taste great.  Definitely will make them often.  Thanks Barbara! Wanted to add an additional comment.  I have made these many times and they are always great.  One thing I now do to save a few calories, is I use Pam Professional High Heat spray, instead of butter,  and to me, they are just as good.

Amazing!!  I too added about a half tsp of sugar and a splash of vanilla, and baked in a glass pyrex pie plate.  I took others advice and made sure my milk and eggs were at room temp. It came out great the very first time.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks so much for the post!

So yummy!!! This is one of my favorite breakfast options.  I eat it with fresh berries of canned peaches.    If you're having a hard time getting it to rise try beatting the eggs more and heating the pan on the stove.

Very good. Addded 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to up the flavor. I'll add cinnamon next time, and lower the amount of nutmeg.

This was very good. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass pie plate. Not much flavor as is, so next time I'm going to follow other suggestions and add apples and spices. Great versatile recipe!

Very good! I doubled and used one cast iron pan and one calphalon pan - we could look at one all pretty on the table while eating the other. (and then eat the second one, too)

The nutmeg flavor reminds me of custard.  I used whole wheat flour instead of the regular flour.  This was very good!

This is much better than the recipe I used yesterday.  The other was way too eggy (it called for twice the amount of eggs but same amt of flour and milk). I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a little vanilla, plus made sure the eggs were room temp and then beat them real good with the stand mixer. I don't know if two tbsp of butter is necessary, but that's just my opinion. I didn't have any powder sugar so I sprinkled with brown sugar, blueberries and honey. I will definitely make this again and again and again!

This was really good.I didnt cook mine quite long enough, but I liked it anyway. Heat the pan first alone with no butter, get it smokin hot the hotter the better it makes it rise. I sprinkled lemon and powdered sugar to finish it off.Didnt need any more butter. This is the same as Yorkshire pudding which you would use meat drippings from prime rib instead of butter.It was your bread with your meal.I love that stuff.

These were great.  I had a recipe from a 1947 cook book that was similar but took 8 eggs to make one huge one.  This was the perfect size for two.  Loves it with butter, lemon and powdered sugar.

I've never heard of these before, but I had the ingredients on hand, and thought I'd give it a shot.  My son and I ate it for dessert with just a little powdered sugar.  I did 1 tsp. of vanilla in lieu of nutmeg, and otherwise followed the recipe with good results.  Thanks!  These were custardy/eggy which I like, and not too heavy!

I remember this from a slumber party when I was a kid....made it for my family today and it was awesome!  I tripled the recipe and used a 9.5x13 pan. I poured homemade blueberry filling (sugar, water, cinnamon, blueberries & corn starch to thicken)and maple syrup in the middle before serving.  Top with powdered sugar and you have heaven on a plate!

Yum!  I've made this twice and both times the Dutch baby came out perfectly!  

I am in college and don't have a skillet.  Instead I used a 9" pyrex pie plate, and increased the baking time to 15 minutes.

In 8 years, my husband has only requested that I make something again three times . . . and this was one of them!  I thought they were a bit dense, but that may be because I used evaporated milk rather than regular.  Pretty good though!

I'd never had a 'Dutch Baby' before and I found the recipe while reading someone's reviews. :) But it was a simple dessert. I melted the butter in a glass pie plate, twisted the plate around so it was all coated with butter, added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, and mixed well until it was combined. I added a sliced banana, mixed it so the slices were coated, and then poured the batter overtop. I baked it at 400 for 20 or 25 minutes. It was flatter than an omelet, but it tasted pretty good. If you aren't going to flip and eat it right away and it gets all stuck to the plate, don't fight it: just put it back in a warm oven for a few minutes and it will loosen right up, you can then flip it onto a plate. :) Thanks, Barbara! It was waaay flat but tasty!

I'm very confused by this recipe. I consider myself to be a good baker but contrary to many of the other people's results, my pancake was dense and tasted eggy. I also think it needs more than a pinch of salt, and a little sugar wouldn't hurt.

This has become a Saturday tradition in our home!  I took the advise of other reviews and cooked for 1/2 hour at 400, and cook in a glass pie plate,.  melt butter in bottom and place thin apple slices in bottom, sprinkle with cinnamon and pour batter on top.  When finished dump over, and be sure to use maple syrup, lemon, and conf sugar to give it more YUMMY taste!~

I grew up having Swedish Pancakes on Christmas day.  My mom's version was basically a crepe filled with ligonberries.  I found a recipe similar to this years ago and lost it. The flavor and consistentcy of the pancake were more to my liking of the crepes my mother made.  I top ours with raspbery jam, a lemon squeeze and need the white fluff of confectioner's sugar.  All my taste buds jump at the "old flavors" of my mothers, but within our current budget and availability.

A very easy and rewarding recipe, suitable for even beginners.  Unfortunately I didn't have powdered sugar, so I topped it with some brown sugar and lemon juice, which was fine, but I know it will be much better with the powdered sugar.  Into the recipe box this goes.

Yummy! Great with just powdered sugar in the middle or you can add fruit like sauteeed apples or try bacon or sausage. Very versatile!

I made this after trying them at the Original Pancake House in Dallas TX. I thought they were great. I added vanilla and they MUST be served very hot with butter melted inside and fresh lemon wedges squeezed over them and then sprinkle with powdered sugar. They are not ment to be the flavor, they are similar to crepes in flavor and make a good holder!!

I cut down the recipe to serve just 1 but forgot to use a smaller pan. It was a disaster. The prep is so quick that I decided to try it again. I used a bread baking ceramic bowl(the size of a regular soup bowl). It came out perfect! I added a little lemon juice and powdered sugar. I will definitely make this again.

I don't like these "pancakes". They are very thin. One of the (few) positives about it is that it's very easy to make... But the baking part is a little strange. I don't know what's so filling about them, maybe if you like the recipe, you might eat the whole batch, THEN it would be filling... They don't have much of a taste to them, it's like you're eating nothing. Definitely wouldn't recommend them, and if you make them, don't expect much.

My family loves this recipe.  It puffs up to amazing heights.  I omit the nutmeg, and I add cinnamon.  I usually double the recipe, and use two 9 in round cake pans, and it works just fine.  Today I used muffin tins to make mini dutch babies.  The trick for the recipe to rise well is to have the oven and the pan piping hot.

Very interesting result. I put the mixture into the oven. When it expanded instead of bubbling up nicely it expanded out hitting the edges of the pan and shooting straight up forming an 8 inch tall hollow cylidrical form with bubbling butter and dough in the middle, I pulled it out, when the top edges of the cylider started to brown too much, and I wrapped in it tin foil. I am about to see how it turned out....it's looking good, little bit longer..The result is.. a little bland, I would put a little sugar in the mix or coconut, lemon, something... I am going to try putting some baked apple in the mix next. Nice base recipe, I prefer a little more complexity.
I would never have thought that this would rise without a leavener. Good trick, opens a whole new realm of puffy golden foods.

I had never had these but my husband has talked about them for years. WOW, these are delicious and so easy to make. I thin sliced Pink Lady apples and drizzled some bourbon aged syrup on them and dusted with powdered sugar... OUT OF THIS WORLD. Guess the husband was right. Shhh don't tell.

I made this for breakfast today and every one loved it ( well not my little brother but he is really REALLY picky )  it does need to cook longer or at a higher heat tho  but that's not a big deal  I cooked it in a 9 x 13  pan  i added cinnamon  and nutmeg  and so it would be more fluffy i beat the egg whites  first and then added the yolks it came out really fluffy my sister though it was a pillow lol   we will be making  this again soon!

I added 1Tbls brown sugar, a dash of vanilla, and more salt (for the regular serving).   I usually increase the recipe to 10 eggs and in doing so I add 1/4C brown sugar, 1.5tsp salt, 3tsp vanilla.  A perfect way for us to use up extra eggs from our chickens.

My photo below will AMAZE YOU!  BUT -  I had made 1-1/2 times the recipe due to 3 big eaters - and should have used MUCH larger (9x12?) pan.  HOWEVER, the guys LOVED IT and wanted more!

It was delicious,  my granddaughter liked it so much, she took the rest home with her. I made a blueberry and  lavender one, it was light and fluffy,  I also poured the maple syrup on top of it in the pan while it was still hot.

Substituted vanilla for the nutmeg and after reading other reviews I also made sure that the milk & eggs were room temperature before mixing

The recipe is okay but the temperature is not. 475° is way too high even cutting it down to 425 is higher than it needs to be. Set your oven to  375° is all you need for any dutch baby recipe. I imagine a lot of folks will end up ruining their Dutch babies with this high temperatures as listed

I don't normally write reviews, but I'm just about to make this recipe again and as I was typing into google "dutch babies II recipe" I was reflecting both on the importance of the "II" to get this particular recipe, as well as how long I've used it. 

I had dutch babies at a friends house in like, elementary school or middle school. I thought they were great, so I wanted to make them at home. At the time, this was the highest- and most-rated recipe, so I used it. I'd say it's my favorite, but I've never followed another recipe because it was so good the first time. I followed the directions (super easy) and it came out perfect, no adjustments necessary. 

I eat it with powdered sugar (probably not as much powdered sugar as the recipe calls for--I go by what it looks like and haven't measured the amounts), maple syrup, and lemon juice as suggested by the author. One note is that I have never followed the suggested serving size: at least double if not triple the servings per person :)

I used 3 eggs and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp brown sugar.  Heated butter in pan and added thinly sliced apple from 2 apples and sauted them in the butter until they were sizzling.  I then poured the egg mixture over and cooked in oven at 400 for 20 minutes.

I found that whipping the eggs and sifting the flour gave me the results I was looking for- I added just a drop of vanilla and cooked it for about a minute or two longer.

I’ve made these so many times I have the recipe memorized.  I don’t change a thing.  My daughter loves watching it puff up in the oven.  So yummy with all sorts of toppings!  I use my 10” cast iron skillet and always make sure my eggs and milk are at room temp.

Had to read the reviews closely to find the perfect tweaks: an extra 1/8 cup flour, and a huge dash of baking soda.
I found it rose the highest in an oval glass oven dish...the square / rectangle ones don't let it puff up as much.

I make this all the time. So delicious and easy. I serve it with two wedges (1/4) of lemon per half of the Dutch Baby. Squeeze lemon juice over each serving just before eating. Nothing else is needed. My husband loves it served with a couple pieces of bacon!

I added a little cinnamon too because I really like those spices. It was delicious. I also add an apple, cinnamon, and brown sugar compote or sometimes just a little lemon and powdered sugar does the trick. I love this recipe because it's easy and fast. Thank you!

This was easy and delicious. One batch is NOT enough for my family of four(two boys:). Clean up is easy when baked in the 10 inch cast iron skillet. Next time I will make two batches. Thank you for the recipe!!!

My family liked these. I made these exactly as written, while in the oven this puffed up very nicely then as it sat on the counter waiting to be served it fell and was paper thin. The center seemed uncooked? Not sure what these should look or taste like I think mine needed a few more minutes baking.  Definitely worth making again because they came together easy and despite a cooking error they were still good.

I made one batch for me and my husband and immediately made another one, it was so good. We finished both back to back, lol. I made it according to the recipe then added fresh creamed cranberry sauce and a good dollop of ice-cream. My husband claimed the next day it had nipped his on-coming cold in the bud.

I went and bought a 10-inch cast iron skillet just so I  could make this. It turned out great the first time. The video says to warm the eggs and milk to room temperature, but the printed recipe doesn't. Make sure you do this or it won't puff.  You can also make savory ones, like herb, ham and cheese. Just Google "savory Dutch Babies" and you'll get over a million hits.

Per other reviewers' recommendation, we made sure all ingredients were room temperature before proceeding. We left out nutmeg since we aren't big fans of it. We also substituted gluten-free flour for the regular flour (1:1) and used a glass 8"x8" baking pan instead of the cast iron pan, and it turned out great!

This is a great basic recipe! I’ve been making these for years but I don’t use the skillet I make mine in a 9 x 13 glass pan and I bake it at 425 and I sprinkle lemon juice powdered sugar and raspberry preserves on mine when it’s done. It’s good stuff!

Just made it for my wife for breakfast. I didn't have any nutmeg, so substituted pumpkin pie spice. No fresh fruit, so added strawberry preserves. She stated "off the chain good", "the bomb" !  It does taste very good! Thank you!

Family dinner - I made it savory by adding italian seasoning to the pancake. Mixed in blender. Turned out great as a pizza crust! Just added pizza topping and put under broiler couple min to finish. Kids didn't love the texture but said tasted good anyway.

This was horrible. Bland and rubbery. For someone to like this they must not have taste buds. Even with whipped topping and fruit couldn’t eat it.

Wow! So good and so easy to make. I made it exactly as written except I added a pinch of cinnamon instead of the nutmeg. I served it with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  Whole family loved it. I may try going savory next time and sprinkle cheese and herbs . Yummy!

The only variation is I mix lemon juice with the piwWWhat dered sugar

Made it today and came out delicious! Simple ingredients and fairly easy instructions. A pre-bought lemon curd or baked apples would pair well with this.

I did it exactly like it said and it came out perfectly! I used a GF flour mix and it was delicious. I'm 13 weeks pregnant and this is the only thing I've been able to stomach in the mornings. By far my favorite recipe this month!

This came out perfect! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and warmed the eggs and milk. I also subbed vanilla for the nutmeg. Mine baked up perfectly fluffy and light. Best one I've ever made. It wasn't eggy or dense. I serve mine with butter, lemon juice, and powdered sugar. It was amazing!

Loved this! Fun to make, and so tasty served warm with a drizzle of maple syrup. I did warm the milk slightly in the microwave, and placed the eggs in a glass of warm water to remove the chill, as recommended by others. It was beautifully puffed up immediately upon removing from the oven. Wish I could have gotten my picture before it fell - it was gorgeous!

I've successfully made Dutch Baby pancakes many times in the past and decided to try a new recipe this go around.  It did not turn out well, resembling something more like a flat cornbread.  The instructions are simple enough, I even used room temp eggs as some recommended but the results were disappointing.

Instead of using nutmeg, I had added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract which I feel like gave a better taste! This recipe is perfect and makes a lovely snack for any time of the day! I didn't use powered sugar, instead I sprinkled cane sugar on top with a dash of lemon on top of Dutch Baby:)))

Warmed the eggs and milk to room temperature, and made two to share with my wife. The first one with nutmeg, as the recipe called for, and the second with 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. We both ate half of the nutmeg and I ate the vanilla one as well. I want to play with this to make smaller ones that fit in a muffin tin that I can fill. Delicious!

I made this as a treat for my birthday, but I think it will be making it many more times in the future! It was delicious! Mine turned out a bit flat - kind of like a slightly puffy crepe - but I didn't realize it was supposed to be fluffy and thought it was great anyway. I'll probably try a few of the suggestions in the reviews next time and see if I get a different result. I ate it with a little powdered sugar and some maple syrup, but I think it would be amazing with fruit or berries.

Make sure you have the pan HOT HOT!  I used Iron Skillet. No need to sift flour.  I used  vanilla & less butter!  Puffed up nicely! Once  done I turned it upside down on a plate and added  fried  apples with cinnomon sugar.
Yum

Perfect!  Used 2 eggs, warmed in water to room temp. 1/2c skim milk heated 20 seconds in microwave, 1 1/2t vanilla, 1/2c flour, pinch salt. Whisked by hand.  Preheated oven to 475 with cast iron pan in it. Removed pan. Reduced heat to 425. Added 2T butter to pan. Poured mixture in. Baked 12 minutes. Used lots of powdered sugar and a sprinkle of lemon juice. Might add a touch of Splenda or sugar to batter next time (I like sweet). Tasted like crepe/French toast/pancake. Great served with fruit.

Awesome! Followed reviewers recommendations and subbed vanilla for nutmeg and baked 425 for about 18-20 mins. 1/3c butter was too much though so next time will only use about 3-4T. Kids loved it!

I'm single and this recipe is perfect for two breakfasts. I add sliced apples which makes it really flavorful. The recipe is easily adapted to gluten free by simply substituting regular flour with gluten free flour.

I made it sweeter, by adding vanilla (dash), cinnamon (pinch), and 1-2tbs sugar (I eyeballed it).  I topped with sliced bananas and a light sprinkling of cinnamon/sugar.  Not that sweet, and most everyone enjoyed it.  Will be good to try with other toppings, or as a savory dish.  Will try again!

First dutch baby I've every made, honestly. Read a lot of the high/low comments and most helpful suggestions. Used vanilla and a tiny bit of nutmeg. Mine was thinner in the center, although the edges puffed up beautifully and had a lovely eating texture, but the center portion didn't quite live up to expectations and was almost crepe-thin. Kids liked the aroma, flavor, and texture of the edges so I might make it again to confirm if results were a fluke.

Made this for the first time and they turned out fantastic.  Added some thin sliced apple pieces to the bottom of the cast iron skillet sprinkled with cinnamon.   Added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to the recipe and used vanilla extract instead of nutmeg.  These plumped up after baking for 12 minutes at 400 and tasted so good.  My wife and Mother in law loved these... scored big points.

I've never had this before and I really only make breakfast on weekends and help with the cookie baking during the holidays, with an occasional dinner when wife is busy. That's the extent of my experience in the kitchen so I always follow the recipe to the letter on my first attempt. I'd seen the recipe on social media, saw a neighbor made it so I decided to try it. Its delicious! It wasn't fluffy but that's likely due to skillsmanship (or lack thereof). I've baked enough to know to use room temperature eggs and not use cooooold milk, but I'm always fearful of incurring wrath for mishandling the wife's precious iron skillet so ....(I didn't get in trouble....yet). Having said that, I will definitely make it many more times, try Somme if the other tweaks and am sure I'll learn to get it puffy. Puffy or not, its down right tolerable! It strikes me, though, it would be great with some savories, kinda like crepes are. Looking forward to that adventure. Thanks for the recipe!

This was super easy to make and delicious! I used room temperature eggs and milk and swapped vanilla for nutmeg. 

I made it savory by topping it with grilled chorizo, onions and potato and then added a drizzle of real maple syrup. This made a wonderful Sunday brunch.

Perfect, easy, and no need for clarified butter. Add some fresh squeezed lemon to bring it to the next level!

It's apple season in Northern California so I added thinly sliced apples to the top and dusted with freshly grated nutmeg. My step mother made these for us growing up and now I make them for my kids. So good!

After reading all of the reviews I was feeling a little intimidated by what some called a very easy recipe.  I decided to follow the recipe exactly as written making sure both my eggs and milk were at room temperature. I even used an iron skillet as the recipe suggests. The results were perfect!! Don't feel intimidated or feel you need any elaborate adjustments. The recipe works as is! Give it a try!

Made this today following the recipe almost exactly - I substituted a little cinnamon for the nutmeg.  I didn't warm the milk or the eggs and I used my 10" cast iron skillet.  This takes no time at all to mix and there is no muss or fuss.  People will think you did something really fancy.  It puffed up and browned to perfection, and it slid right out of the skillet.  I did bake it for about 20 minutes, not 12. Had a friend stop by this morning right after I pulled it out of the oven. She and I both LOVED it!  Sprinkled a little powdered sugar and sliced some strawberries on top. This is definitely not sweet as there's no sugar in the batter, but there's enough sweetness from the powdered sugar or syrup you might use. Will DEFINITELY make this again.  Next time I'll experiment a little with some cocoa perhaps. I can see this for a dessert with whipped cream and fruit. Yummmmmm.

I like the version made by the Original Pancake House in Anaheim. These did not have that gooey behaviour or end up as thin as theirs. I will keep looking for the recipe that makes a perfect Dutch Baby

I have made this recipe several times--all very good, quick, and easy. However, I used a 13x9 baking dish & 1/3 c. butter instead of cast iron skillet. Much easier and just as good!,

Simple and delicious. I recommend a couple of mods:

-  No need to preheat the pan in the oven, stovetop will work just fine. Pour the batter, then put the pan in the oven.
- Separate the eggs and whisk the whites to a froth before mixing everything. That's the simple magic to getting a great texture.

This was delicious! I will definitely make it again. Here is what changed... Nothing. I made it exactly as the recipe said, I didn't even warm the eggs or the milk, I also don't have a convection oven. It puffed up beautifully.

This is pretty much a no-fail recipe!  One key is to use room temperature eggs, as other reviewers have noted.  A really hot pan - preheated in the oven as instructed in the recipe - is necessary, too.  Dandyk1997 is way off on her criticisms, or perhaps isn't familiar with how Dutch Pancakes are supposed to turn out.  Only thing I'd say is that this wasn't two servings in my house - I definitely didn't want to share!

Thought these were wonderful. I did make some changes however.  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  I omitted the confectioners sugar and served them with fresh blueberries and maple syrup.  YUM!

These were very good. I used coconut oil instead of butter and vanilla almond milk instead of milk.  I found that a glass pie dish worked the best for shape and non-stick-ness.  I also found that I could bake two at a time to save time as I am feeding two hungry teen boys.  These were simple and authentic.  I liked them and so did my family.

I made this in my cast iron skillet this past weekend and it was great!  My husband really loved it and it was surprisingly filling.  In the future though I'm going to add fruit to it, perhaps bake the skillet cake over a layer of fruit?  This is a nice recipe to have fun with.  Thanks for posting it!

Made this for a Sunday breakfast. It was a hit for everyone. I'll comment that the pancake is very light. So if you don't like the thickness & density of a pancake, this is perfect. It was great with a lil syrup. Next time I'm going to make a fruit topping. Also, the 1 skillet goes by fast! May want to make doubles if you are feeding a bunch. We are a family of 6 if that helps.

I know it's good, this is the same recipe for Yorkshire Pudding in the UK sometimes served before the meat course with "gravy" (a sauce made with the meat juices) or cooked in muffin tins to serve with the meat course or served at the end of the meal as the sweet course with any topping you like I prefer Maple syrup.

This dish is kind of a cross between Swedish pancakes and popovers. Very good and simple. I used 1 tsp of vanilla instead of the nutmeg. Next time I will try 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a shake of cinnamon.

I've been making these for years.  I skip the nutmeg and sauté apple slices in some butter and sugar.  Arrange them over the batter and continue with the recipe as written.  Delicious!  Also, have all ingredients at room temperature before you begin, and definitely use a blender.

I made this and it was good, but not mind-blowing. I warmed the eggs and milk a little per others' reviews and suggestions, and it was easy enough and puffed up nicely.  I liked the way I didn't have to babysit pancakes, but I think it would be better with some fruit compote on it, or cooked with apples as another reviewer suggested.

Been making these for years. They can even be made in a 9" cake pan (this helps if you're  making 2 of them.) Add 2 Tb. Sugar.  Just throw all ingedients in a blender  (I use my Ninja), I usually use my enamel coated cast iron when making just one. I always add vanilla and lemon zest. MAKE SURE EGGS AND MILK ARE ROOM TEMP AND SKILLET IS HOT!  Throw some blueberries in the batter or peaches right before putting in oven for a great variation. Serve with lemon wedges & powdered sugar.

I like this sized recipe for making a single serving!  They are too good to share..  I am never as careful to mix in the flour and milk as gently as you do - I do whisk the eggs  add the milk and then the flour and I use vanilla as well as nutmeg - if I remember and If I am making desert babies.  I cook 4 at a time in Pyrex glass dishes on two shelves in the oven with well butter bottoms (or spray -) so we can all eat at the same time..  425  for 12 min or so ( watch them they will grow and edges brown and they are done)   butter is better flavor but if your watching your fat counts spray works if you keep it off the sides.  They must be coated on the bottom only.  if you coat the sides they do not climb as nicely.  I have made it as the base for many fruit toppings but I like it best with lemon juice (fresh squeezed) and powdered sugar.  after writing this  I am hungry for them but alas it will have to wait till AM as we have dinner already in the oven. PS Babies are great cold and rolled up like a jelly roll or just butter lightly,  cut to pieces and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon and warmed in an oven.- yummmm   don't over work the mixing my grand-kids  have made this since they were old enough to know how to use a pot holder - very few totally flat ones and usually they buttered the glass sides.  so Enjoy Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner works all the time..  This comes from a family  Polish family recipe and I was glad to see that someone else passed it on also.. to go

WOWEE, this is great. I did warm the eggs and milk. Cooking took about 10 minutes more but all ovens very. Can't wait to make it again. I used real maple syrup. Next time the powdered sugar. Loved this!

I've used this nearly identical recipe for years, but not as a "sweet treat."  Instead, I make a white sauce and add chopped ham, onion, and broccoli, which can be spooned into the center of the puff just before serving.  Recently I've cut the puff into individual servings, then topped with the creamy mixture.  That way the puff can be reheated for leftovers, or used for a dessert as this recipe suggests--sprinkled with powdered sugar.

Made it. They're great. Just ok with sugar, syrup, etc. Next time I make them, I'm going to add a pinch of sage, marjoram or thyme, then saute some diced onions and green chilis to add after cooking, because I think these would be great as savory instead of sweet. I warmed the eggs and milk before mixing.  This reminds me of the  British version, which Is served with beef.

This recipe has been a favorite of my husband for years.  I do add about 1/2 cup of whatever canned pie filling I have on hand and it is truly a special treat.   My grandkids love it as well and think they are getting a very special treat when we make this for breakfast when they stay over.

Made this several times in Pyrex pie plate in toaster oven, and perfect each time. When done, I spread jam in the bottom, top with banana slices and some whipped cream, crazy good! Going to try one reviewers idea to cook in individual serving dishes.

I was so excited to make this for my family this Christmas, but I was so disappointed. Although the flavor was there, the pancakes were heavy and not airy enough. I'm going to add a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder on the next go around and I'll let everyone know how they turn out.

I have been making this recipe for years, but have never reviewed it. I've done it several different ways, but here's what works for me. I use a glass pie plate. I don't worry about getting anything room temp before I start, and I don't use nutmeg. The first batch never rises as well as the next ones (Hey, just like regular pancakes, right?), but it still tastes good. I get the next batch of batter ready while the first one is baking. When it's done, I transfer it to a plate (I sometimes have to use a metal spatula to scrape the pan a bit before I transfer it. Then I put the next two tbsp butter in the pan, and put it back into the oven for a minute or so. This melts the butter and gets the pan back up to temp, then I pour the batter in the pan (while it's in the oven) and start on the next batch.  NEXT TIME, I will do two pie plates at the same time so I don't have to do four different batches for each person in my family. My kids don't really care if they rise high, so they get the first batch! I've also used a non-stick ovenproof skillet, but you can only do one at a time.

I read the comments before making these and began with room temperature eggs and used vanilla in the recipe. This worked wonderfully for me.
We topped with butter, raspberries and confectioners/powdered sugar.
A real hit.
I did note the comment by the person that claimed, "I used to be a professional pastry chef". 
Anybody that is a pro would know that over beating or using a Kitchen Aid would know that overworking flour encourages gluten to form and is the last thing you want to do when making light flaky or tender pastries, it will turn pancakes rubbery. This is apparent to the least educated baker.
Sorry to be so direct but people here need real solutions and that was so far off base by a "pro".
Never overworked a light batter or dough, unless you are trying for a thick crust bread dough, etc.

Soooo easy and delicious just follow the recipe, do not try to substitute any other kind of pan for the cast iron and don't put the butter in the pan until you are ready to pour in the batter. I let the pan heat while the oven came up to 425, at 475 the butter will want to burn. The Baby comes out perfect every time!  Please note that the puff deflates very rapidly this is a variety of pancake, not a soufflé.

Great base recipe for making sweet, and/or savory Dutch Babies. When I made the sweet version, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, a home-made dessert blend of spices with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, ginger, & cardamom and topped with warm maple syrup. I followed the suggestions of using room temp eggs & milk and it puffed up just fine then deflated to a light, eggy pancake.  Next up...savory style!

I messed this recipe up thinking that you had to make it in two pans, oops! Now I know that the batter all goes into ONE pan, which I used a round cake pan because I was too lazy to get the cast iron skillet. The bottoms ended up crispy and the taste was still the same. Topped it with butter, powdered sugar, lemon and syrup (ALL OF THE TOPPINGS!!).

Impressive.  Also delicious. Easy too.   It's like a big flat sugary popover.  I warmed the eggs in hot water and microwaved the milk a little to bring both up to room temp.

Made it, altered it. Trying adding 1/4tsp vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon, and a 1/2tsp of lemon juice. My boys loved it dusted with powdered sugar and blueberry pancake syrup.

good, but they are just a sweet yorkshire pudding made for breakfast. same ingredients, l love putting strawberry jam on mine. As l little bit of lemon jest on or in batter is refreshing. Heating pan is the key and get batter in asap. Also batter should be room temp for about an hour for it to rise good.

I love this recipe and the texture you get from cast iron is a difference I love, sure you still get a dutch baby but not like Nana made. There are many ways we can make cooking easier like the microwave.. Hush I said it.. But who's going to say food prepared like that is wonderful.. Not me.. OK off soap box. Point is forego the steps and it makes it worth while. Wonderful .. Thanks for recipe..

I also made a couple of changes. I started at 400 for ten minutes then reduced the heat to 350 for the next ten minutes. Made two batches the first day, and incredible! We used one large cast iron, and another small one because that is what I had available. The big one came out thin and fluffy and the small one came out slightly more eggy. Thin one went with lemon, blackberries, and sugar. Thicker one with roasted eggplant, sauteed mushrooms, and goat cheese. WOW. That was amazing.

1- make sure you preheat your oven in time - 475 degrees takes a long time to heat up; 2- when you pour the batter in the pan, using a potholder pick up the skillet and swirl it around the edges. If you don't do this you'll get a flat, puffy pancake and will miss the whole crispy, fluffy thing; 3 - I've seen this recipe with a squeeze of lemon in the batter (and even on top before the confectioners sugar) and it makes a lovely difference

I thought this was easy and delicious. Mine was crispy-edged and puffy all over. These pancakes do go down after a few minutes, it's just the way Dutch Babies are. I agree with others that it is good to warm your eggs by sitting them in a bowl of hot water, and heating the milk slightly. I made this just this morning, and thank goodness no one was home, so I didn't have to share!

I tried this recipe today and chose it over a similar recipe by Chef John...mainly because it seemed easier to prepare.  It was easy and tasted just like the Dutch Babies I have had in the past.  I didn't realize how much like a crepe they were...no wonder I love it!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  You just need a 10" or 12" iron skillet to prepare it per the recipe.  Now that I know how easy it is to make the Dutch Baby will become a regular breakfast item in our home!

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe for a 12" cast iron pan and added a touch of pure vanilla extract as suggested by others, along with freshly grated nutmeg; served with real maple syrup, confectioners sugar, and jams.  It looked ugly as sin but tasted wonderful.  A warning though, it takes a LONG time to heat the cast iron pan in the oven to 475 so be sure to plan for that.  We had this for Christmas morning breakfast.

To be perfectly honest, this is one of my favorite recipes to make.  Definitely a change from the regular pancake sort of thing.  We serve this with maple syrup and some bacon on the side.  Marvelous!  If you have kids, gather them around the oven door window for some fun as this Dutch baby changes from one interesting form to another.  (In fact, any men in the house will enjoy the show just as much!)  Thanks, Barbara, for sharing your great-grandmother's recipe with all of us.  My family has thoroughly enjoyed it many, many times since we first came across your recipe.  Excellent recipe to keep and to share!

I made it exactly as written except I used a regular non-stick skillet instead of cast iron. Turned out 'delish!' according to the people who ate them.

The first time I tried this recipe, I ended up with a pretty uneven "lift" puffing only one side of my skillet. It was still tasty, but having made it three times now I have finally mastered it. First, I use my handheld electric mixer and make sure my eggs are extra fluffy. I was nervous to over-beat the mixture but I went for it and once everything was added I made sure it was still getting fluffy. I used to use my hand whisk and didn't get the same results. I do pull out the hand whisk after I add the flour but I'm pretty sure I could get away with using the mixer on low even at that stage. I find the vanilla suggested by other reviewers to be kind of perfect in this (you can really taste it!) and a bit of sugar in the batter -- a teaspoon is fine -- really gets it nice and golden. Oh, and tons of powdered sugar to serve! :D

Add a teaspoon of vanilla and this recipe is perfectly flavored, but it HAS to be doubled and baked a little longer. Then you get the creamy eggy pancake center and the crispy, browned, spectacularly puffed edges. Delicious and one of our favorites!!

We really enjoyed the the Dutch Babies..... They kind of taste like Yorkshire Puddings.

I baked them in 2 6" cast iron fry pans.... they turned out really well....next time I would put more flavouring in.... like vanilla, more nutmeg, lemon zest.... and some cinnamon. 

I think they would work with some savory spices like rosemary, garlic,parsley,or chives mixed in the batter.... then fill the bowl with chicken or beef stew.

YUM! I grew up with Walker Bros. Original Pancake House in IL, and this is just like theirs. I bake a single in a cast iron, and today I doubled and put it in a 9x13 and it was perfect. As others said, use warm eggs, milk, and a HOT pan. I use a fraction of the butter (just enough to wet the pan); I dislike puddles of butter at the bottom. Powdered sugar + generous lemon juice, and it's heaven!

Fantastic!! I'm not a baker so I was a little hesitant in even trying but it worked great!! Yes, take the advice of others and make sure your eggs and milk are room temp, that makes a huge difference. It's easy and nummy!! Don't go another weekend without giving these dutch babies a fair shake!!

I make these often and we all love them.  Although, I usually don't add the nutmeg as it is a strong spice to me.  I let the batter rest for a half hour also.  MMMMMMMM yummy

An easy recipe for delicious pancakes - for when you do not want to mess with Kaiserschmarrn but want to get something similar. To get them rise, make sure: the oven and the pan are hot enough, there is enough batter to cover the pan, the oven is operating in plain double-sided heating mode.

I MADE IT A MINUTE AGO,LOVED THE FLAVOR. I DID ADD A THINLY SLICED APPLE WITH CINNAMON, VANILLA, AND NUTMEG. BUT, OTHER THAN THOSE ADDITIONS MADE IT LIKE THE RECIPE. YES, IT DID DEFLATE AFTER I GOT IT OUT OF THE OVEN, BUT WHO CARES! THE FLAVOR IS WHAT REALLY COUNTS!!!

Worked like a gorgeous charm for me. I topped mine with local raw honey and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Yummy! The trick is to be sure you've preheated your oven to the 475F, melt your butter in the pan in the oven and, as soon as it's melted, pour in the batter. Close the oven, turn down the temperature to 425F and voila!

I made these for the very first time today, they were quick, very easy and really good. It turned out exactly the way it looked and tasted great, even my kids liked it! The best part is, you could have this all the time and each time add something different to it. I will continue to make this, thank you for sharing.

It went really well. It was my first time to make dutch baby and turned out amazing. I didn't have nutmeg so I skiped it and I didn't have sugar powder so I just put some sugar into the batter and it was totally fine.

I absolutely loved this oven pancake!  It took me all of 5 minutes to devour it.  As other reviewers have said its extremely important to have the eggs and milk at room temperature for lift.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to it as others suggested (I don't like nutmeg), and as I do for any yorkshire pudding type oven batter I let it rest for 1 hour before using it, it needs to settle for at least 20 minutes prior to baking for the best rise.  My cast iron skillet was slightly too small so it expanded up and out a bit, and I just warmed it up in the oven at 220 degrees celsius and threw the butter into it then the batter.  I didn't want to take it out as you lose all of the heat you got into it, and I couldn't be bothered turning my oven up to 245 degrees just to drop it back down, I can't say it did it any harm as it still cooked in less than 12 minutes.

Amazing recipe!! Works perfectly every time. My diet went out the window ever since I found this recipe and wouldn't want it any other way. I like to switch the nutmeg for 1 tbs. of brown sugar and I smother the finished product with powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice.

This was just OK for me. I've made other Dutch Babies that were really great as a stand alone item, this one relied too heavily on the baked apples I paired with it to have any flavor.  Not bad, but not great.  It did puff up nicely and had a good texture though.

This recipe is amazing.  The pancake is light and fluffy, and it is delicious with a squeeze of lemon and lots of powdered sugar.  I followed the recipe except that I used cinnamon in place of the nutmeg and added a touch of almond extract.

I used whole wheat flour, which means it won't rise as well (heavier, denser flour), but I added two more eggs to the second batch, and it did rise very well, even with the whole wheat flour.  Also, instead of cream or milk and the spices, I used egg nog - absolutely delicious!

Baked this yummy dutch baby this morning for my grandkid's. They loved it and wanted more so I baked another! I made sure to butter up the sides of the skillet really well and it was lightly crispy on the edges and buttery. Oh..I added a pinch of cinnamon instead of the nutmeg.

Good Breakfast recipe! 

All the Ladies in the house (mom and 3 girls) like without the sugar and lemon dusting. We like it with cream cheese and homemade jellies!

This recipe worked great for me in my well-seasoned cast iron skillet. I took it out a minute early so it didn't brown too much. I substituted vanilla for the nutmeg and topped with lemon and powdered sugar. Easy and delicious.

This is a great recipe that I have continued to use now for a couple of years.  I love that it uses the cast iron skillet as this is the most healthy.  I have substituted almond milk for the cow's milk and they still turn out perfect everytime.  A+.

I love these! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. I liked it, but decided to personalize it a bit. I now make it with vanilla instead of nutmeg, and I use an additional egg. I adore this for a late night snack.

FABULOUS!! Don't know why it rises differently each time, maybe difference in eggs/milk I buy on different days? Anyway, I don't wait for a shape! Just put LOTS of powdered sugar on it, and vanish it does! LOVE IT!

I'm not sure what the problem was.  I followed the directions exactly but found it was way too much butter.  It came out greasy and it was so bland...even with the confectioners sugar and some lemon.  Will have to tinker with it, I guess.  We get these every time we go to the pancake house and theirs seem much sweeter.  Maybe add some sugar to the batter?

I've made these tons of times over the last 7 or 8 years, and they turn out perfectly every single time as long as the eggs are at approximately room temperature.  Otherwise, there's no need to change the recipe at all, unless you'd like to add some spice or seasoning on the front end rather than when they are done. But as a base recipe, this one is fantastic.

Taste food.  They apparently are supposed to fall flat after removing from the oven, I thought I was doing something wrong! Not sure what to call them though, kids look at me funny when I ask them if they want to try a dutch baby!

I agree with Jess on this one. First of all, I had never heard of these and decided to try. These were very bland to me. I am not sure if they are supposed taste this way or not. The only way I could rate this higher is to add more ingredients/flavor to the mix as so many stated they have done.

Perfect!  I love making these for my kids and they love to watch them blow up! I also add a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of sugar to give it a kick! They like to spread jam on them and roll them up too!

Perfect directions..... follow it to a T and you cant go wrong..... I use about 2 tbs lemon juice on mine when it comes out of the oven, then I sprinkle on a good bit of powdered sugar.  This recipe is very close to the one from The Original Pancake House.  OPH uses lemon juice and powdered sugar as well.  I also spread on a little more butter too when it comes out of the oven.  The texture is eggy, not fluffy like a pancake.  That is how it is meant to be.  YUMMMMY

I really liked this!!! Plus it was pretty fast and easy which is always great :) I did sub evaporated milk for the milk, just because I had an already opened can that I needed to use. I also added just a splash of vanilla. The hubs had his with some strawberry jelly and powdered sugar, but I really liked them with just powdered sugar...yum! :)

Incredibly good!  I thought I'd miss sugar in them, so I tried it both ways (as written w/o sugar and with sugar), and I definitely like the no sugar (recipe as written) version better.

I made this for breakfast this morning and followed the recipe to the letter.  It turned out perfectly - light and fluffy.  It was delicious and easy to make.  I will definately be making this again.  I added some cinnamon to the batter.  This would be good with baked cinnamon apples over top or any other kind of fruit.  Delicious, fun and easy recipe!

Added some cinnamon with the nutmeg; as well as some sliced apples on the bottom the pan after melting the butter and before adding the batter - served with warm maple syrup; this trully was very nice... and so much easier than pancakes...  Make sure to make a double batch (in two pans, not sure how it would come out at twice the thickness batter wise; haev to adjust the cooking temps/times accordingly.)  Try this!  Yum!

I made these twice in a day and quite enjoyed them! I made lots of changes though... I added about 1 t sugar, more nutmeg than was called for, and 1 t vanilla. I'd probably add about 1/2 t cinnamon next time (oh, there will be next times!). I didn't follow the posted directions at all. I followed the simpler directions another commentor posted, and it worked great. I baked them in pie plates for 17-20 min. each. Serve immediately because they fall fast! I served them with diced peaches, strawberries, blueberries, syrup and icing sugar. A light Sunday evening dinner! The family was very impressed.

These were interesting, but the texture was far too eggy for me. If you do make them, add 1 tsp. vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and 1-2 tsp. sugar.

To me this is one of those “grandma made” recipes that is good if you grew up with it and it reminds you of home and your childhood. It tasted like a flat rubbery thick crepe. I tried several variations by other reviewers (maple syrup, cinnamon, sugar, combination cinnamon/sugar, add splash of vanilla to batter, butter and warm honey, powdered sugar. Nothing really helped. I thought the honey was terrible on it.

Delicious my toddler and husband loved it! I added a drop or two of almond extract to the batter, Yum and used half the amount of butter called for, just enough to coat the pan. Can top with some syrup or fresh fruit!

FANTASTIC!  Made in a cast iron skillet and topped with lemon and maple syrup, which ended up being an excellent sweet/tart combination against the dutch baby.  This is also super easy...I just wish I could make more than 2 servings at once! :-)

I really like this recipe.  It is a cross between a crepe and a pancake.  It is fun to make as well.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as written.  I found it a bit bland, hence the 4 star rating.  I now make it with sugar and vanilla added.  With these additions, the recipe rates 5 stars.  I serve with maple syrup.  Just a note:  I followed another reviewer's tip to use a regular oven, not a convection oven.  This is so true.  Twice now I have forgotten to turn off the convection feature on my oven, and both those times, the pancake did not rise and was literally "flat as a pancake".

I was really excited when I came across this recipe. There is a local restaraunt that my boyfriend likes to go to for breakfast on the weekends just so he can have is Dutch Baby. He said that mine was just as excellent as theirs :-) I made this with the tspn of vanilla and the pinch of nutmeg and it turned out FANTASTIC.

These can also be cooked like pancakes on the griddle and then rolled.  I love these - they are also known as german pancakes.  If your SO has a problem with "textures" beware.  My hubby loved the taste but he does not like the texture - that is after fixing them twice.

I had never heard of Dutch Babies before!  Made this for my husband and he really loved it.  I added cinnamon and powdered vanilla to the mix, and then served with syrup on the side.  Do you know he ate the entire pan of this by himself?  That dedinitely rates 5 stars...he's kinda picky.

Made these for my husband and I for breakfast on last weekend. I haven't had them since I was a kid and saw this recipe/ Added a little cinnamon and vanilla. Served with sauteed apples. Nice, fluffy, light breakfast, great with a cup of coffee.

This tasty recipe turned out great. I also added vanilla and used cake flour. I think that made it lighter and fluffier.

The pancake was OK.  I made it just like the recipe called for, when I removed it from the oven it was nice and fluffy, but when I cut into it, it fell.  Flavor was good, but didn't like the texture.  I served it with fried apples and sausage.  Don't know if I will make it again.

This recipe is excellent as-is!    My mom used to make these every Easter morning for my brothers and me when we were living at home.  I've started the tradition with my son and he just loves them!  He often asks for his "Easter pancakes" all through the year.  My mom would sprinkle a little fresh lemon juice on them with the powdered sugar.  The lemon gives it such a fresh springy flavor!

Really nice! Looks great coming out of the oven, but there's no way to serve it in the skillet without burning down the dining room table. By the time you slide it out onto a platter and cut it, it's a lot less impressive. So invite everyone into the kitchen to view before serving. Tastes great - like a cross between a pancake and a popover.

Well...Although my husband and I thought theses were WAY TOO doughy, my kids LOVED them. Pure maple syrup for my son and powdered sugar for my daughter. They were interesting in texture. I didn't have a cast iron skillet, but followed other reviews...I won't give up on it..just need to figure it out!

This was so good.  I was worried that there was no sugar in the batter, but it was great.  I make apples to go on top and my husband and I were fighting over the last piece.  I think I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  I didi add some vanilla, and kept the nutmeg.  I will make this again and agian!

Delicious!  I actually doubled the amount of milk and flour and used 3 eggs because I wanted the pancake to be thicker and more custardy.  I also added 3 tbsp. of sugar and some vanilla to the batter.  Kept the butter amount the same.  I baked it for probably 12-15 minutes.  Turned out perfect.  This is very similar to a dutch apple pancake recipe I have.  Love it!

Ok, thought this was a little strange but LOVE LOVE LOVED the finished product. Mine did rise and ended up a little "custardy" in the the middle, but it was fantastic. We actually had it as an after dinner treat and just sprinkled a little powdered sugar and honey on it. YUM. Will make again and add fruit, etc. I think it might be good with the apples on the bottom as others have suggested. Oh the possibilities!

These were very good.  Excellent with powdered sugar and strawberries.  The baking isn't consistent though.  I have made them 3 times, sometimes they bubble up and other times lay flat.  Either way they taste the same but not as impressive looking.

Easy to make and delicious.  Some of us ate them with syrup and some with strawberries and powdered sugar.  My 5 year old likes blueberries so I threw a handful of frozen ones on top of her batter before putting it in the oven.  It turned out great.

Easy, easy! I love this dish because you can make it when you have guests. Blend it all together and pop it in the oven so you can spend time with your friends. Blah? No.  Serve it with your favorite fruit and maple syrup. What's not to love?

I love these.  My mom made them all the time for me when I was little and now that I have the recipe, I can make them for myself!  I prefer them with just powdered sugar, but my husband likes them with strawberries and whipped cream.  Great for breakfast or dinner!

My Baby made these for me when I was sick, and now I feel better, and love her for it. We liked them so much that she's making another batch now.

I made this on a small round pan instead of on a cast iron skillet, skipped the nutmeg and used a bit less butter.

Very good and easy.  My 3 year old loves pancakes.  This recipe is not pancakes but it is close and much easier to make.

Outstanding - we doubled the recipe and used a deep dish pizza pan.

This is really yummy. The first time I made this it was perfect, the second time however it was not as good, but that was not the recipe's fault I did something wrong. I will definitely try again though!

My mother in law made this for me this past holiday and it was great.  Her recipe was basically the same, only doubled, and she heated her butter in the pan in the oven.  Fabulous!!

I use this recipe every time I make Dutch Babies.  So few people have ever heard of these that I'm always impressing someone.  I like these best with a little lemon juice, powdered sugar sprinkled over it and fresh strawberries.
