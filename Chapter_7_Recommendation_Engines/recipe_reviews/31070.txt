This sauce had wonderful aroma and color.  I couldn't actually taste its affects on the ham though.  Next time I think I would use it on turkey, or remove some of the fat from the ham so it could soak in and add more flavor.

Absolutely loved it!  I made my cranberry sauce from scratch.  I basted the ham throughout, not just the last 30 min.  It was an absolute hit at the party I brought it to.  I will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this. I substituted chicken stock for the wine because I didn't want to open a bottle for a 1/3 of a cup. Worked out beautifully

This recipe was the first one I've posted a picture of on allrecipes, and with good reason. The glaze was a perfect accompaniment to my Christmas ham; it was tangy, sweet and paired really well with the saltiness of the meat. I grew up learning to put the cloves in after the ham was baked, so I did it that way, but instead of adding whole cloves to the sauce, I added about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of ground clove, with just a dash of nutmeg. I didn't have an orange so I substituted with about 1/2 cup of orange juice. Got rave reviews from friends and family that tried it. This was a real gem of a recipe find for me and I will be using it again this Christmas!

Made it for Christmas last year, with ham in a nesco roaster. Once the ham was heated, I cooled the whole works down and sliced the ham back into the liquid left from the roasting. Reheated the next day for dinner and it was fantastic! I made an extra batch to serve on the side warmed up. I'm thinking about using a dry red wine and glazing a whole tenderloin with it this year.
