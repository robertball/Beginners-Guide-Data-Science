A very easy and elegant appetizer - perfect for entertaining guests. You can get creative with the presentation if you like and it's always a hit.  This definitely is a fool proof appetizer....

I do believe the Italians got this right as this is traditionally a light summer meal that can be found on any table in the country!  Wonderful, easy and colorful presentation.  Served this as a starter to the Caprese Salad with Grilled Flank Steak also on AR and an Italian Chardonnay from Castello Monsanto which is one of the few Italian white wines that can stand up against prosciutto and hold it's own.  Thank you Sunflower for the submission!

This is one of my favorite appetizers! I just LOVE the combination of the sweetness of the cantaloupe and the saltiness of the prosciutto. This also works great with honeydew. So refreshing and delicious~YUM! :)

I hate to do this b/c the recipe is sound, but I made this as an app at a dinner party & it was hardely touched. Personally, I just didn't like the flavor of melon & prosciutto together, although I like them both on their own. I know some ppl love it, so maybe it was just me & my company. The texture was not very.pleasant either. Kinda slimy. My suggestion would be to.serve them seperately (the melon & prosciutto). Thank u anyway!

Fabulous recipe! Simple and basic. Use quality prosciutto and a good melon and you can not go wrong. (Quality prosciutto is not slimy as some reviews note a slimyness) Love the sweetness of the melon offset with the saltyness of the prosciutto. I made this for a picnic and x4 the recipe then used what little was leftover cut into smaller pieces on top of a bed a baby salad greens with a light balsamic vinegrette.

Can't go wrong.  Seems the silliest recipe ever, but this is a fantastic traditional summertime meal in Italy.  No doubt you will find this on every table in Italy from the North to the South.  The key is the quality of the prosciutto and the ripeness of the melon.  Serve as an antipasto or light meal with classic breadsticks from Turin (long, skinny and crunchy) and a light, dry white wine.  Picture attached!  Thanks for posting this "recipe".

Yes.  This has always been a popular 'starter' in Europe; Italy in particular, but also very popular at 'nice' restaurants in England.   I'm English, now living in Canada, and have eaten and served this for more years than I care to share! lol  Often powdered ginger, in a shaker, was/is provided, and this also made a very nice addition on occasion.  As a matter of fact, tomorrow evening we have friends coming for supper, staying overnight, and having breakfast before continuing their journey home.  I'm serving this as a light starter, followed by Chicken with Capers/Cream Sauce, Garlic Smashed Potatoes, French Green Beans and fresh Asparagus; no dessert, but double cream Brie with green grapes and fresh raspberries.  Some nice wine too of course! ;o} Brenda, Ontario, Canada

I love love love, Prosciutto & Cantaloupe. Tried it a few years ago on a Cruise from New York to Canada. And requested from the 1st night all the way to the last. I noticed, that one reviewer said, it was slimey and rated it poorly. My experience is if the combination is slimey, then not very good quality of fruit or meat. And possibly left the morsels out to long at room temperature. Suggestion would be to place them on a plate over a bed of ice to keep them cool. Because it shouldn't be slimey at all. However, this does not last very long with my 3 girls and myself. I find that one small package of prisciutto(that comes with 6 slices) and half of a large cantalope goes a long way. At least that's how it worked when I made the recipe. But tasty to say the least. The prosciutto is not salty at all and if you have a juicy ripen sweet melon, the pairing is great. Will make again, especially in the summer months when cantaloupe is at it's best.. TY

I just didn't like this recipe, although I know others I served it to did like it.  I know it's a popular Italian appetizer, so it's just my personal taste.  The proscuitto (sp?) had a weird texture, kind of slimy.

I have been doing Muskmelon and Italian Ham for years.  Glad to see it got the props it deserves.  Can't beat sweet and salty..

Those that said add a couple drops of balsamic vinegar really nailed it..

Never tried it with Honeydew always stuck with the Muskmelon.

My friend and I loved this combination.  She kept the handful of leftovers.  However, my husband doesn't like this melon.  Next time I may try making this with honeydew.

This was made for an appetizer for a shower this weekend. Only 3 out of 20+ pieces were even tried! I personally love the sweet salty combination, however, it is a bit expensive to use very high quality prosciutto and have a tray go to waste! I will probably never serve it to a party again!

I think the fact that I wasn't wild about this was more personal preference than an issue with the recipe itself.  I normally adore the combination of prosciutto and fruit but this just didn't do it for me at all.  My sister-in-law, on the other hand, who normally has tastes that are pretty much identical to mine, gobbled it up and kept raving about it the next day.  I wrapped the pieces of melon in prosciutto and then let it all chill together in the fridge and I definitely preferred it chilled versus when the melon was room temp as I was assembling it.  In the end I think most would love this, it just wasn't for me.

Have always been curious to try this, so I finally did!  We all liked it.  I think next time, I would cut the slices of proscuitto in half length wise as it seemed to be too much ham compared to the melon, but still delicious!

I would make it again, but with a ripe to very ripe cantaloupe. 
I loses much with a less than fully ripe melon.

Very nice and refreshing! however juices tend to accumulate if not eaten soon, very good though. I used a melon baller and stuck toothpicks through them to bring to a party
