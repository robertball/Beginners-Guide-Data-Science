My boyfriend and I love this, great with rice and veggies.

Tip: It only curdles if you put on too much sauce & you don't need that much crackers.  I just use a thin layer of bread crumbs.

I thought this was pretty good, but I will cut back on the worchestershire next time, as it was just a little too strong for me.  Also, I will cut back on the cooking time, as it seemed a little dry to me.  I think with a couple of adjustments, this will be a really good dish.

I thought this was decent.  After reading the other reviews I shortened the baking time to 40 minutes and it came out quite moist.  It was certainly better than boring chicken breast!

This recipe was just okay. It seemed very heavy and I even reduced the amount of cream. I think it was just a matter of personal taste perhaps.

I did not care for this recipe! The sour cream and worchestershire sauce curdled and I ended up throwing out the whole thing and getting take out.

This recipe works really great if you lower the cooking time to about 40-45 minutes in a smaller pan and add a can of cream of mushroom or even cream of chicken to the sauce. Also if you saute the crackers in a stick of butter before placing on top it adds oh so much more to the dish.

This was such an easy recipe!  It smelled wonderful as it cooked!  Everyone loved it, but I think I'll cut down on the worchershire and the cook time, next time... I love finding these simple, yummy dinners for my family!

3.5 stars. I made for my family. Cooked for 45-50 minutes and the chicken was pefectly done. I did take others advice and used french fried onions on the top and added a bit of cream cheese to the sauce and a bit of onion flakes to the sauce, as well. But it still seems to be missing something; we just didn't find it to be all that tasty. If I made it again, I might try adding less worcestire sauce and adding something else (I just don't know what).

The sauce curdled and was way too thick on top of the chicken.  The worcestershire sauce was too strong in flavor.  I won't be cooking this again!

This was a very easy dish to make which is why it got four stars! I did use a light sprinkle of bread crumbs instead of crackers. It is not something I would make all the time but because I have everything on hand it made for a great meal with rice and baked veggies.

This smelled heavenly, it made my mouth water the whole time it was cooking...but when I took a bite, I was sorely disappointed.  It was very bland.

Very yummy, though I did make a couple of additions. First, I thined out the sour cream with a little white wine. I also added some minced onion, and added the juice from a lemon. Served this over buttered egg noodles. Very tasty! :)

I enjoyed this dish.  It was easy to throw together and had good flavor.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers, and I baked it for about 20 minutes (I have a gas stove...some things tend to cook faster).  It browned perfectly and was incredibly tender!

Not very good.  It tasted like a bunch of guck on the chicken. (not much taste).
I agree that this "was simply something to eat"...

this was, as my husband and i say, "something to eat". i agree that 1 hr. is far too long to cook this and a 9x13 is too big a pan for it. the "sauce" is tasty although it breaks during cooking creating a curdled looking topping. it would be better created as a casserole with cut up chicken and cooked in a high dish instead of a flat one---will NOT be making again.

ok - but not enough sauce.  the 9x13 pan is too big (see other reviews) and luckily we did not add all the cracker crumbs (again due to other reviews).  The flavor was good, but, I am not sure I'd make it again.

This was OK, the flavour was alright on the chicken but the crackers were awful, way too much.  Also I cooked the chicken for about 45 to 50 minutes, 1 hour would be too long.

I really liked this recipe because it's quick and easy.  Next time I will leave out the cracker crumbs and also cook a little less than what the recipe calls for.  Overall - Very Good!

I used the tool to convert this recipe to serve 50 people for my mother's 60th birthday party.  It was so easy to make for a crowd! I was able to make it in a  electric roaster so I would be able to keep it warm.  I had so many comments on how great this dish was and even had some requests for the recipe!
