Unreal.  This is fantastic.  I wasnt too sure about this when I was reading the ingredients, but my husband loves anything with chilies and cheese.  Not only is it great, but its so easy.  Will make again and again.  McCormicks makes a great greek seasoning.

My family loves when I make this for dinner. So easy too. I let the chicken thaw out in the fridge in the italian dressing, and cook the sauce the night before. Than the night I want to make the dinner, throw the chicken in the oven, cook up some egg noddles, heat up the sauce and dinner is on. Leftovers are great the next day. Perfect everytime. I leave out the peppers because of the kids, and the dinner is still delicious.

This dish was very good, however, it was a bit too salty.  The next time I make it I will use unsalted butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  You can always add salt to taste, but you can't remove it once it has been added.  The Havarti is slightly salty as well, so this could have added to the problem.  Once these adjustments have been made, this will be perfect, and it's very easy to make as well.

This dish really surprised me.  I LOVED the unique flavor the Greek seasoning gave the chicken - you have to use it to get the full effect of this dish!  I "googled" for the recipe since I didn't have it in the pantry.  I used: salt, pepper, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, nutmeg, cinnamon and parsley flakes. Also doubled the sauce.  Fantastic and different!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This sure was a winner in our house! So easy to make. The Havarti cheese was so yummy on the chicken. Great combo of the mushrooms, White wine, and Worcestershire sauce. We didn't have the Greek seasoning and it still tasted good. We will be sure to have this again for dinner.

This recipe was pretty good. However, I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I only had chicken tenders - marinated them in italian dressing then grilled them. When I made the mushroom sauce I added onions - tripled the sauce (but only added 1 TBS of worchestershire. Used fresh garlic rather than the garlic salt. When I finished grilling the chicken I put them in the skillet and added the chili peppers and cheese then covered it for a minute. Served with wild rice and broccoli.  It was a nice and quick recipe - a little on the salty side though.

I really enjoyed this dish (although I did omit the chili peppers because I didn't have any on hand.). It had a really unique taste. A very fast, easy to prepare main course--I think this would really impress guests at a dinner party. I did find it a bit salty so next time I wouldn't add any additional salt and would use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also, this dish is quite rich so make sure you go with light side dishes.

This was a good dish. The Havarti cheese gave it a nice flavor. I used only 1 can of green chilies and that was enough for us on 4 chicken breasts.

I made this for a simple dinner party and my friends still rave over that night...For the mushroom sauce, I decided to briefly sautee the mushrooms in butter first, then added the remaining ingredients, but I also trippled the liquid and garlic salt amount to make more of a sauce, then served the ensemble over rice.  Thank you for this choice!!!

Very tasty.  Marinated the chicken in italian dressing.  Grilled it up with garlic salt.  Meanwhile cooked the mushrooms over the stove.  After the chicken was done added a slice of Havarti to melt.  Left out the chiles.  Very easy and great flavor.

Everytime I make this it turns out so good. I always make a little more of the mushroom mixture. If your a mushroom fan, make more! The peppers and such a great kick! Very good!

Very good!  I wasn't sure about this either but it turned out to be a very easy, tasty dish.  I would definitely double/triple the mushroom sauce next time because mine cooked down quite a bit.  I also threw in some shittake mushrooms for variety.  Very good!!

For a weeknight dinner, this was excellent.  The marinade (we added a bit of mayo to it) made the chicken succulent and moist while the sauce made my husband do his 'oomahhh' noise, which is his sign that it is delicious.  I actually doubled the sauce, because I just couldn't see how the amount suggested was going to be enough (our family is Danish -we love creamy sauces)  We ended up using Asti Champagne instead of white wine which we were out of. This champagne is quite sweet so I am unsure how that affected the end result.  Again, being Danish, havarti was DEFINATELY a huge draw, but I did not include any dill or the dill flavoured variety -it just seemed like too many tastes.  Didn't get a chance to pass the Wolseley test ( Wolseley is our much loved Black Lab) as there was none left over for him to try -much to his sorrow!

This is super easy and is Gluten-Free with Wishbone Italian Dressing and Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce.  I didn't have any white wine so I used a red that was laying around for the mushrooms and that turned out great, too!

This recipe is so simple and yummy! The one thing I would recommend, I personally always use Dofino Dill Havarti because it's noticeably creamier.

4.5  Everyone enjoyed this at dinner last night.  The kids wouldn't touch the sauteed mushrooms but hubby and I agreed that they really added nice flavor.  Served with Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes.

I agree that there were too many flavors happening here.  As much as I love Havarti, it just doesn't seem to work with Chicken.  I will stick with Swiss & Mushrooms when I am in the mood for somehthing similar.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it exactly as written.  Hubby called it restaurant quality.  The chiles and havarti are a fabulous accompaniment to the mushroom sauce.  I combined it with the Greek Salad III for a complete carb-free special dinner.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

We quite liked this.  The only change is that I used plain havarti rather than dill, just because it's what I had.  The flavors are really nice together.

What an interesting combination of flavors.  Our family loved it.  Very easy recipe and quick as well.  No chopping or extended prep.  The mushrooms were awesome, only added some ground black pepper and a tad more salt.  I will make these next time we have steak.  The dill havarti is the key though...it's that creamy cheese with the dill flavor that just seems to set everything off perfectly.  This is a keeper for us.  Thanks

I've made this recipe at least 20 times already, my husband and I LOVE it!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the chili's or the greek seasoning.  I added more dill to it and it's so FABULOUS!  I served this with baked potatoes almost every time and it's just wonderful.  Thank you for the submission!

Being a relatively new cook, I usually try to stay away from the "gourmet" meals, but this one turned out well. My husband suggested I make it for his parents when they come to visit! Served with rice. Very good, thanks!

I served this for my first real dinner party and everyone was crazy about it.  A wonderful savory dish that breathes new life into plain old chicken. I wanted to make my main dish something everyone would enjoy, and yet give them something they would remember. I omited the green chili pepper because of my picky husband.  I suggest using the Greek seasoning even though it lists it as optional.  Extremely good and definately will make again. Thank you!

This was SO good, I can't even tell you.  And easy easy easy.  I've made it about 5 times now.  For boyfriend, roommate and parents.  Every one loves it.  I did find you can make it without the wine if you have none on hand, if you can't find "Greek Seasoning" use 1 part good Greek dressing to 2 parts Italian dressing in the marinade and if you let the chicken marinade over night it's even better.  Lastly, these breast leftovers make a good sandwich the next day.

This chicken has the nicest blending of flavors and is really quite simple to prepare.  I omitted the salt and used garlic powder, rather than garlic salt for the mushroom sauce.  I also doubled the butter, wine, and Worchestershire.  Try this chicken.  You'll have it again and again.  My kids loved it, although my 6 year old did pick off the "green things."

Ehh this was ok. Kind of boring despite all the various things going on in this recipe. I did have to skip the optional Greek seasoning as I didn't have any, but I did add some seasonings (basil, oregano, onion powder) to the mushrooms because I had some seasoned olive oil mixture left from brushing on my smashed potatoes I made to go with this chicken (used the olive oil instead of the butter called for here). Perhaps it would be improved with longer marinating time, I only had about 35 minutes before I had to cook it. Maybe pan searing the chicken before baking too would improve it but I don't think this will be a repeat recipe for me. Thanks for sharing the recipe though.

This is the bomb, and should you manage to have any leftovers, extremely double pleasure. We used diced chile peppers (in a can) which gave it a milder flavor. The Havarti with Dill is what pulled an ordinary chicken dinner into a top-notch 'chef-at-home' delight. Will include often at my table.

An easy super tasty weeknight meal. My skeptical husband couldn't get enough. It is a little salty, so don't be tempted to add any to the chicken. Overall Delish!

Very good and easy....instead of greek seasoning sprinkled cumin, garlic, pepper, oregano, and paprika. Also ate over shredded cauliflower. Cook the same as rice in the microwave. My kids never noticed the difference. yummy

Excellent dish, my picky boyfriend even liked it!  I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the mushrooms, minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and reduced fat Italian dressing.  I didn't have Greek seasoning, but Italian seasoning worked out great.

Excellent recipe!! I did have to leave out the greek seasoning because I live in a small town in the panhandle of TX and can't get it here (and I didn't want to mix my own) I used Italian instead. I also added onions and fresh garlic to the mushroom sauce, just because I like onions and garlic. This is def. a keeper!!!

Wow, this was really good.  I used unsalted butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and it was plenty salty, so I would definitely agree with the other reviews on that.  I used the Greek seasoning (Cavender's) in the marinade and also sprinkled some on top before cooking the chicken.  I turned on the broiler for about five minutes after putting the cheese on top.  Kids and adults all thought it was great!

Amazingly rich and wonderful flavor. This dish tastes like it's been cooking all day. The recipe is perfect as is, but if you double the sauce, as I did, you might want to cut back on the Worcestershire. Using 2 tbs ended up making it too salty. Thanks BCWebb for sharing this recipe. It's a new favorite!

Made as written, and the BF called it "the best chicken I've ever had".  Now, I've heard that line before...but very infrequently at best.  Delish for cheese and chili pepper lovers alike!

Used plain Havarti and fresh garlic. I liked the dish overall. Chicken was moist and flavorful. Liked the chilis on top and the havarti... Mushrooms were ok. Might make it again some day.

Such a simple dish that really mixes things up at dinner.  I wasn't sure about the combination of ingredients but it really worked.  I ended up using Italian seasoning and plain havarti but it worked fine.  I also used fresh garlic with the mushroom sauce.  Really a big hit with the whole family and sooo easy!

Delectable dish, excellent recipe - unbelievable flavor combo with the delicious mix of green chiles and the Havarti dill cheese..  it's fabulous.  My hubby and kids loved it.  Even my daughter who doesn't like mushrooms devoured it, including the mushrooms.

Turned out awesome!  My modifications:  garlic powder instead of garlic salt, omitted the salt.  Couldn't find sliced Havarti cheese with dill so I bought regular sliced Havarti cheese and sprinkled dill over it.  I also doubled the ingredients for the sauce (except the mushrooms -- there were plenty).  My husband and I loved this recipe!

I loved it! I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I love havarti cheese so when I saw this recipe I knew it was for me. It was fantastic. I loved the mushrooms. The only thing I would change is that I used Mild chili peppers and I don't think they added enough spice. I think next time I would use medium peppers. Other than that it was fantastic!

Awesome!  Went perfectly over white rice.  I used only 1 can of chilies & used plain Havarti instead of dill.  I used white wine instead of white cooking wine.  And instead of the garlic salt, I used 2 cloves of garlic (minced) + some Kosher salt.  Next time I will double mushrooms & sauce because we just couldn't get enough of them!

My husband ooh'd and aah'd over this dish.  At first I thought it was too bland, and I even used minced garlic and seasoned the chicken with a heavy-handed Greek seasoning.  The green chilies just didn't have the oomph I was expecting.  But the more he said how good it was, the more I was liking the subtleness of the flavors.  Peppers that were too spicy would take away from the mellowness of the havarti and mushrooms.  "A keeper" he exclaimed!

This recipe is wonderful and I think that what I liked most about it was that it is different from a lot of chicken recipes.  I was great that it was fast too.  I did marinade the chicken for about 8 hours.  Maybe that is why there was so much flavor.  I was generous with the Greek seasoning.  I also used diced chili peppers.  It was a true delight and very unique.

This was deeeelicious.  My whole family loved it.  Instead of using 2 4oz cans of whole chiles I used 1 4oz can of diced chiles and it was fine.  Everything else I left the same.  Will def make again.

Made as instructed and honestly didn't see the point in the peppers. Didn't add any flavor to mine and what flavor it did add seemed to clash with the rest. Now, the mushrooms on the other hand, WOW!!!! Have used the mushroom part of the recipe to add to just about everything from steak to pasta. I don't really care for mushrooms, except the ones like this!

Wonderful exceptional flavor, especially in the mushrooms.  Everyone loved it.  The sauce wasn't very saucy, however, I had to keep adding more worstershire and wine to it while it cooked.  Would have been nice to have more of that sauce, too.  I'll try doubling next time.

This was very good all on it's own. I used chardonnay instead of cooking wine and served it with steamed veggies and vigo mix long grain and wild rice. ***I had a full chicken breast left over and lots of rice. For lunch the next day, i reheated the chicken and mushrooms together and toasted a tortilla on my stove top. A laid down a small bed of rice and toped it with slices of the chicken and spoonfuls of the mushroom sauce then wrapped it like a buritto.*** My husband and I adored it!! It was even better than the chicken on it's own!! I will definetly make this again!!! If you made this and remotely liked it, you MUST try it in a buritto like this!!

This was fantastic!  Instead of using store bought Italian dressing I made the Betty Crocker version from my cookbook and marinated the chicken in that.  We loved this dish - will make over & over again.  I served it over white rice w/chicken base, a little oregano, garlic & chopped onions on the side, it was a perfect compliment.

There was too much going on in this recipe.  Too many different flavor combinations.  I think maybe bacon would better compliment the chicken instead of the green chilis.  Although, my family said they enjoyed this recipe, I don't think I'll make it as stated again.

I dont think I will make this again.  I got great compliments at dinner, but I felt like there were just too many flavors going on.  The great taste of the havarti cheese was just wasted.  Chicken was very moist, just too busy.  Thanks anyway

It was ok but I'm not sure if the mushroom sauce compliments the rest of the flavors. It was just too many weird things going on. When I scraped off the mushrooms and sauce, it was pretty good but nothing spectacular.

I made this dish when my parents came to visit (though I omitted the chili peppers) and they absolutely RAVED. It truly is flavorful, hearty, and unique. I look forward to adding this to my "best loved" list.

What a great tasting dish!  I had to use dried dill weed, regular havarti and chopped green chilies, but the flavors still melded.  The mushrooms are FABULOUS!!  I will use the mushroom & sauce part of the recipe to top grilled steaks in the future because this was our favorite part!  Served with fresh green beans tossed in greek seasoning.

One of my all time favorite recipes. the mushrooms taste soooooooo good grilled this way, and along with the canned chiles it is so amazing. i used creamy itaian dressing, which turned out well. i have made this 3 times, and i only discovered the recipe a couple weeks ago.

I LOVED this recipe!  I did change it a bit but still, it was just delightful.  I couldn't find greek seasoning ANYWHERE but I did find a recipe that was repeated word for word on sever sites so I just made my own.  Don't know if that makes a difference or not but still, I can't complain.  Also, I left out the chili's because I was afraid they would overpower the dish but my sister insists that they give excellent flavor so next time I will give them a try.  Lastly, I pounded the chicken flat simply because that's my prefernce with boneless chicken breast.  An excellent recipe for chicken and a keeper in our household.  Would even make for a company dinner just to show off.  ;)

Great recipe! Made this for myself and my husband last night and we both just loved it. The only thing I would do differently (and most of you probably had the common sense to do this) would be to ask for four slices of Havarti at the deli, rather than four ounces. I ended up with only 3 slices of cheese, so just made 3 servings. Very delicious. thank you!

I made this last night for my sister's birthday and it was wonderful!  My grocery store was out of the whole green chilis, so I used the diced and just put about 1 to 2 tablespoons on top each breast before I put the cheese on.  I used the Greek seasoning too and it added good flavor.  I would definately make it again!

This was not a bad recipe but I don't think I'll put it on my regular rotation.  Havarti is not a thing I usually have around, so it's just as well.  This is definitely worth making once in awhile though.
A put it over rice and served roasted butternut squash on the side.

I loved this recipe. Made it as directed. I love spice and next time I would add a spicier green chile. A friend who tried the recipe said that the chilies and cheese would go nicely inside the chicken as well. Sort of like a cordon bleu!

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes... I've been cooking it for several years. I like to cook red potatos and steam asparagus as the sides.

This was alright & smelled incredible while cooking; however that was the italian dressing & I would use it again for marinating & baking chicken breasts.  As for the topper - it didn't WOW me.

Amazing meal!  I've made it several times now, and it has become one of my favorites off this website.  I usually double the sauce to spread over some rice as well.  Thanks!

This has become one of my favorite chicken dishes!  I've made it w/ and w/o the greek seasoning and it definitely  "makes" the dish WITH the seasoning.  I usually use regular white wine instead of the cooking wine and double the wine/mushroom sauce...YUMMY!  Even my husband who complains that i make chicken too often really liked this one :)

An unusual combination that I really wanted to like more than I did.  This is an updated review: This is just shy of working for us.  The chilies and mushrooms just don't work together, but w/out one or the other this would be a 5 star.

Eh. Just "eh". First off, I think that doing chicken breasts are difficult because they can be pretty bland. Yes, I used the cheese and chilis but I didn't think that they all blended well with the chicken. It still tasted like chicken...which is only OK.

So fast, so yummy, even better for leftovers the next day.  I am sometimes a lazy cook-  Usually only use a bottled italian dressing and the havarti.  Still tastes great!

My picky family loved this!  I marinated it in a creamy parmesan Italian dressing. I did not have the Greek seasoning.  I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt after reading the other reviews.  Other than that, I cooked it just as stated and it was very tasty with white rice and asparagus!

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  My husband and 3 year old liked it as well.  Between the green chili's and the havarti cheese, the flavor of this dish was wonderful.  I served it with stir fried asparagus and almond rice pilaf - delicious!  This one is a keeper.

I really liked the chicken, the mushrooms not so much, but I am not a big fan of Worschestire Sauce, though I do use it in my French Onion Soup. The Havarti was a great addition to the chicken.

I made this recipe exactly as listed with the exception of the chili peppers. I sauteed two chilies in olive oil. I served it with wild rice and baked asparagus. Extremely easy to make and excellent flavors that didn't require adding salt or other seasonings.

This was delicious.  I thought that the flavors melded lovely, nothing was overpowering. I marinated the chicken for the better part of the day in the italian dressing and greek seasoning, it made the chicken very tender and flavorful.  I wouldn't recommend marinating overnight, it might turn the chicken to mush. Oh, and one last thing, buy extra of the havarti with dill...it makes great grilled cheese sandwiches!

This turned out perfectly, well worth the effort.  Cooked in the convection oven and the chicken came out perfectly moist and a bit crispy.  We liked it just out of the oven even before I added the mushrooms, pepper & cheese.  This is perfect for a company "show-off" dinner.

I was running out of time for dinner last night when i made this. So I completely modified the cooking method. I actually marinated like it says, but instead of baking, I cooked in on a stove. Then added the green chiles, and shredded the havarti cheese, and let's just say WOW. This was the best meal all week my husband said. :-) Thanks for a GREAT recipe. I will be making this again and again.

This recipe is wonderful!  Instead of the canned chili peppers, I roated my own anaheim chili pepper and used that in its place.  To keep it low sodium I didn't use any worchester or garlic salt.  I used crushed garlic.  I left out the pepper for my hubby, he's not a fan, and he loved it even without the pepper.  Made it for guests and they were amazed, everyone always wants a copy of this one.  Thank you for submitting it!!

Havarti cheese is SOO good on this! It was a little complicated to make with the different things added at different times, but in the end it was tastey!

This was good; not as spicy as others thought, though.  Surprisingly, the green chili did nothing for the taste.  Mushrooms were good but, overall, not much pop to it.

Perfect!  The only thing I didn't do was the chili.  I don't like them so I just left it off.  Perfect.  The chicken was so juicy and tender.  My dinner group all loved it!

I just tried this tonight with my family. Very easy to make, and very very flavorful. there was quite a few different tastes in this one, but they blended together nicely. I used a ken's italian dressing w/aged romano. I added twice the amount of wine/worchestshire sauce, and garlic salt. I also added chopped onion with the mushrooms. I didn't use the greek seasoning perhaps that is what was overwhelming others.

Delicious! I made it just the way it said, with greek seasoning. I made 1 chicken breast with a chili and the other without--it's better with the chili. Some people said "there was too much going on," but I thought it was great.

We love this recipe!  This is now one of my favorites for chicken.  The mushrooms are what make it so tasty, and the Havarti is a mild but flavorful cheese. I recommend giving this one a try!

This was good.  I was not able to find dill havarti, so i just used plain.  I doubled the sauce, however I forgot to serve the mushrooms on the chicken. We ate them on the side.   I will make again.

I made this a few nights ago and can't stop thinking about how delicious it was.  My husband is picky and he liked it, too.  I couldn't find the Greek seasoning anywhere in my local grocery store, so I used a little Italian Medley instead.  Chicken was SO moist and very tasty!

This was a good recipe.  I omitted the chilis because I didn't think the falvors mixed well together.  I also used more Italian dressing and added the jucies to the mushrooms as I was cooking them.  It was a great meal and went great with rice.

This was good but I found it a little on the salty side.  I think I use too much Italian dressing...I will back off on that a little next time.  My husband loved it though.  He said it was like a gourmet meal.

this was pretty good. Im 6 months pregnant and my taste buds are off so I think I wouldve liked it more if I was tasting normal but my husband loved it. I roasted my own chili's instead of using canned. Thanks for the recipe

The first words out of my boyfriend's mouth were- and I quote- "This is outrageous!"  Thanks a lot, BCWEBB!  This is truly one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had!  I did without the chiles just fine, and also "googled" the recipe for the Greek seasoning- it really added a nice touch to the chicken.  Plus, make sure and get the Havarti WITH DILL, as mentioned.  It makes a noticable difference.  Thanks a lot!

VERY tasty. I marinated my chicken breasts over nite in 2 cups Italian Dressing / 1 cup Greek dressing (I found the Greek Dressing in Whole Foods.) I also pounded my chicken breasts.  I did not use chili peppers but this still had great flavor.

Tasty,I am not a mushroon lover and when I tasted these mushrooms I am amazed how good they were, this is the way all mushrooms will be cooked from now on in our house. Don't forget the canned green chili, I thought they would be too hot but the canned variety have no where near the heat that pickled or fresh do, and they really add a nice flavour to the chicken, the cheese melts very fast so don't take your eyes off of it.  Will make this again for sure.

This dish was okay.  I probably will make again at some point, but not anytime soon. It's not a recipe I would use regularly.  It was very easy to make, but not something my kids would eat. I would also recommend using one can of peppers and doubling the sauce.

After taking a bite, the first words out of my husbands mouth were 'this deserves five stars'.  He knows I live on this website!  This recipe is so easy, and after the marinade it takes no time to cook.  Thanks!

This dish was awesome! My while family loved it. I made several variations of adding or not adding the mushrooms and/or chiles. This is now added as one of our everyday meals. Thanks for the great recipe!

Both me and my husband loved this recipe!  I made it without greek seasoning and used white wine vinegar instead of cooking wine.  It was wonderful!

As a new bird from the nest, I merely typed the names of some vegetable in my refrigerator to find a corresponding recipe.  In the Worcestershire sauce, I sauteed mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and minced garlic.  This concoction made for a delectable cascade over the chicken.  Best of Luck... and Remember the wine.

This recipe is FABULOUS! My husband took one bite and said it tasted like something he would have at a fine restaurant.  My entire family loved this. The flavors went very well together.  I didn't change a thing except double the mushroom sauce because I had a full pound of mushrooms and we all agreed that the extra mushrooms were good.  My family loved the mushroom sauce so much we use it atop steak as well.  I couldn't imagine anyone not loving this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I loved this and he couldn't get enough! I put more green chiles on for a little more kick. Also, I would suggest putting a more havarti then they suggest.

This was truly awesome! Greek Seasoning? I just used Oregano and I left out the chiles. This has been put in first place in my favorites book! Thank you for a great chicken recipe that's quick and good enough for guests too!
