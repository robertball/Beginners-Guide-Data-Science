I made these biscuits for my husband, who goes to that famous seafood restaurant, even though he doesn't much care for seafood, just for the biscuits.  He's absolutely addicted to them.

He tried these tonight and said that he thought they were even better than the ones at the restaurant.  I did make some slight modifications based on earlier raters' suggestions and on his particular tastes.  I doubled the cheese and used the extra aged super sharp cheddar.  I mixed the garlic in with the Bisquik & cheese, and then I put parsley and more garlic in the butter and brushed it on both before and after baking.  The biscuits turned out *extremely* light, they almost felt like they were going to float right out of my mouth.

These really are "lighty, tasty little biscuits"! Not sure if they're just like the ones at Red Lobster, but they sure are good! Plus, they're easy to make which is a big plus. I added the garlic powder to the mix and added some dried parsley. Plus, I brushed them with garlic butter BEFORE and AFTER baking with I think makes a big difference.... If I make these again, I'd make them again that way. Perfect wtih soup or salad!

Review rating based on the following changes:  
I melted 1/4 cup butter, added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, dash of salt, and dried parsley flakes, and I used a sharp cheddar cheese.  This MAKES the biscuits SO much more like those at Red Lobster.

I absolutely loved the biscuits, at first I was skeptical because the ingredients and recipe seemed so simple, but they were great even my toddler loved them.  I didn't know what was meant by "buttermilk baking mix" and used Bisquick. As recommended by other reviews I increased the amount of cheese to 2/3 cup and added the garlic powder to the mix before baking.  Thank you Brenda for a delicious and simple recipe.

I am a Home Ec teacher, and use this recipe with my 7th graders.  They love it and always ask for copies of the recipe to take home!  The only modification:  I make smaller biscuits with the kids, they cook all the way through and tend not to burn (we get a dozen from the recipe).  Kudos to you Brenda - if a couple hundred kids can make this recipe successfully and enjoy the results, it has to be terrific!

Well, the bottoms of my biscuits keep burning before they are ready. Does anyone know why this happens? This recipe was good but I had higher expectations due to the rave revues. I am not sure I will  try it again. I did put the garlic powder in the batter first.

These really do taste like the ones at Red Lobster!  They will be a regular at my house from now on!  (By the way, I brushed the melted garlic butter on before AND after baking the biscuits.)  YUM!

I suppose it doesn't seem to make sense to rave about a recipe that starts with a baking mix and includes just a couple of other ingredients.  I guess maybe it doesn't count that I literally had these mixed up in seconds yet I can't praise them enough.  Nor does it make sense that Hubs pretty much turns his nose away from biscuits but loved these and told me so - three times. I agree - it doesn't make sense.  But these are excellent.  Light, fluffy, and reach-for-seconds delicious.

I had to practice a couple of times to get the baking temp and time just right for my tempramental oven (I call it Chernobyl), but once I hit upon the right combination, I was blown away with these tasty little jewels.  Now if I can just find Red Lobster's stuffed mushroom appetizer recipe, I'll be all set.

My first time making biscuits and these ended up being the most delicous I've ever tasted!!  Like other reviewers I added parsely to the garlic butter, and basted before and after baking.  So good!!

This recipe has the same ingredients as Red Lobster biscuits that I make. I do, however, use Jiffy brand baking mix. The Bisquick mix makes the biscuits very heavy. I also put some garlic salt into the mix. Make sure that you pack them down a little or the tops will burn.

These were so good. Funny story, our power went off when these were baking & I didn't know what to do, so I threw the cookie sheet into the grill & finished baking them there! It worked and they were fantastic. Try the new mix from Bisquick - Heart Smart. At least make them a bit healthier!

I tried this recipe hoping they would taste just like the restaurant ones, because I'm hopelessly addicted to them.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and they were good, but not perfect.  So the second time around, I tweaked it a little.      My first suggestion would be to add a little more garlic than recommended.  I stirred about a teaspoon and a half of garlic powder into the dry mix.  To give the butter mix a little more zip, I added a little extra garlic powder, about half a teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon and a half of dried parsley.      I also spooned a little bit of the butter mix over the biscuits before putting them in the oven, and then spooned the rest over the tops when they were done.  This time, they tasted exactly right!

Great addition or snack time indulgence! Used bisquick and nearly a cup of cheese, added a dash of onion powder to the mix and covered in butter before, half way, and when done. Half way basting was mostly to ensure the bottoms were not burning. I added real crushed garlic and freeze dried chives to the butter. Made 8 for me. Family wants more of these now!

These are good and easy!  Also, you can make these with water instead of milk and I think they are actually better because they're a bit lighter.

Except for adding about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to the dough, I made these exactly as written. My husband's first word after tasting one was, "Wow!" Must be on to something with these - thanks for a great recipe!

I used Bisquick for the mix. Used approximately 1 cup of the regularly shredded Kraft Sharp Cheddar Cheese (pre-shredded in the bag). Added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the mix. Melted the original 1/4 cup butter and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt and brushed on both before and after baking (I'd suggest adding a little bit of garlic salt at a time and keep taste-testing until it suites your salt tastebuds!)  I made 12 biscuits out of the original 10 serving recipe and put them on parchment paper to bake. I baked at 425 degrees for 11 minutes and they did not burn or stick. With these changes, I fell in love! Thanks for a great new recipe!!

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I did what a previous poster said, and doubled the garlic.  1/2 Tsp in the batter, 1/2 Tsp. in the butter.  I also upped the cheese to 1 C. and added dried parsley to the melted butter.  I didn't have buttermilk baking mix, so I used plain, and they were still delicious!  My husband ate them all up before dinner was even on the table!  I had to make a 2nd batch!

Hi there, I cooked these and LOVED them. My daughter even loved them. She said ("make more")
She never likes anything. These are so good and taste just like Red Lobster biscuits. Thank you!

They tasted quite delicious!  However, if you like them a little cheesier, you may want to add more cheese (maybe 2/3 cup instead of only 1/2 cup).  I also sprinkled some garlic powder into the dough before baking.

These came out great! We love "cheesy" around here, so I added a bit more cheese (1/4 cup of mozzarella). Very similar to the popular seafood restaurant, but IOO... even better!

I made these for a group in their teens and twenties. They loved it, but I thought it was a little boring. For me, it was just missing something. I used Bisquick.

My daughter says "just like (a popular seafood restaurant)"!  It made 6 huge biscuits (being lazy) and the 3 of us ate them ALL! I guess I'll double the recipe and make them smaller next time...

I made these early this morning before it got too hot. I used buttermilk instead of plain milk and I upped the garlic powder to a full teaspoon. I dropped the dough for these biscuits into greased baking sheets so they would be a little more uniform--that really was just a personal choice. These turned out very nice.

Tasted just like the Red Lobster biscuits after a few changes. I added the garlic power to the batter and doubled the cheese. I only used about 2 Tbs of butter for the top which was plenty. I added garlic powder and garlic salt to the butter and it was perfect. They need a little salt to make them taste like Red Lobsters. And I used Bisquick for the buttermilk baking mix. They are delicious!

These taste just like "those" biscuits! I didn't have buttermilk biscuit mix, just regular, so I just added a little lemon juice to my milk for a few minutes per a suggestion and it worked out excellent!  Also, I mixed them until they were just mixed and then no more mixing, they came out nice and tender...I ate 6 of them for dinner :)

A nice twist on the standard biscuits! These are wonderful when following the advice of some of the other reviewers. Our family would have found them to be a bit plain if I hadn't made these few, simple changes. As another reviewer mentioned, I added the garlic powder to the  mix (1/2 tsp.), as well as some chives (one tsp) and 2/3 cup of a shredded Mexican Cheese mix.  They are also fine, and less greasy without the mixture of butter and garlic after baking. Thank you for a new recipe that our family truly enjoyed, and will continue to utilize for years to come!

Quick Tasty biscuit.  I used "Easy Biscuit Mixture" from this website for the baking mix.  I used a small ice cream scoop to portion the batter which made about 18 biscuits.

I made these to go along with an Italian dish, so I used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  I also added some dried Italian seasonings to the butter mixture to top them off with!  These are so simple to whip up and everyone loves them!

Brenda says these are as good as Red Lobster's, but...she lied, they are better. I too added extra garlic to the batter and extra cheese and these were amazing. I had tried a recipie similar to these a long time ago and they were terrible.  I gave up, then came across this recipie. I was worried because Bisquick seems to be a dense baking mix, but these were light and fluffy. They were a huge hit with my family, and so easy to make. Thank you Brenda!!!

A bit dry on the outside, but the inside was fine--this is why it calls for the butter, I'm guessing. 

I used Reduced-Fat Bisquick and cut the butter to 3 TBSP. This was more than enough for the 18 biscuits I ended up with. (I rolled them into approx. 1.25" balls). 

Overall, very good results. You might try a bit of nutmeg to deepen the cheese and butter flavors.

Sweet, baby Jesus these were amazing! To say they were fantastic is an understatement... My family absolutely loved these. The first time I tried making them I must have read the ingredients wrong because I ended up with flat discs of still-yummy-goodness (though very crunchy). This batch was the absolute fluffiest concoction. I will take the advice of others next time and put the butter/garlic mixture on before and after. There's definitely enough in the original recipe to cover that, so making more of this is not necessary. I also used Bisquik as others did and this works just fine. Very simple and very fantastic!

Taste wise these were excellent.  They actually turned out heavier than I expected.  Not quite the same texture as our favorite sea food restaurant.

So easy and so, so good! I also added the garlic to the dough.  I was looking for something to accent dinner with things I already had on-hand and these turned out PERFECTLY.  I will be making these often, I'm sure!

I was taught never to beat quick breads; I tossed the ingredients with a fork until everything was evenly distributed. It made a soft-ish dough, so rather than drop the biscuits, I lightly pressed out  and cut the biscuits. Because of these, I can't in good conscience give 5 stars. The results were as advertized, light and tasty.  FYI: I started with homemade baking mix. In the future, I'll add whatever dried herbs suit the meal or my whims. Tomorrow I'll make potato soup and make these with herbes de Provence; can't  wait. Really glad I tried these; you should too.

The biscuits do expand when heated.  450 degrees is too much.  I used 425.  Double the cheese.  Add a little salt too.  Don't forget the dry parsley flakes.

Very good. I was able to make these even with slim pickins in the fridge and pantry. I, too, threw in some extra cheddar cheese. I used minced garlic in the batter as that's what I had. I added some parsley even before I read all the others' suggestions. I used reconstituted non-fat dry milk because that's what we had, and skipped the butter because that's one of the things we didn't have. This is an excellent breakfast for non-pay weeks, lol.

These were fast, easy and incredibly delicious! I noticed that several reviewers said they burned on the bottom so I moved my oven rack to the very top and they came out perfect, even after 12 minutes at 450.  I also added some garlic powder and extra cheese to batter and brushed the butter mixture on before baking, mmm good!

As written I would give 4 stars.  I added minced garlic, 1 cup of cheese, 1 Tbsp mayonnaise, and milk to dough.  I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt to butter.  They turned out moist and had wonderful flavor.  Also sprayed the pan with pam.  Didn't have any problems with getting them out of pan.  Thanks for the recipe.

These baked up nice but I will add more garlic and cheese to the batter next time.  And more garlic to the melted butter.  It just didn't have enough garlic/cheese flavor and I used sharp cheddar cheese.  Kept the leftover dough refrigerated and will make additions and try again!

Yeah, these are excellent. I added 1 tsp of garlic to the batter. I also added 1/2 tsp of parsley to the butter and garlic mixture. I used Bisquick for the baking mix. You can't go wrong with these. Real easy, delicious, and impressive.

YUMMY!  My family loved 'em!  I did cook them on 425 F and added 2/3 C cheese and garlic powder straight into the batter and a little additional in the melted butter too like others suggested!

These are very tender, fluffy biscuits.  I added the garlic powder to the biscuit mix and also added some to the butter at the end.  I used 2/3 c cheese and baked at 425 on convection for 8 minutes.  They baked perfectly but still could have used just a tad more garlic powder.

I just ate the first one they are delicious! I used Bisquick mix instead of buttermilk biscuit mix, a full cup of cheese, & I also added 1 teaspoon full of garlic powder to the mix. I will definitely be making these again.

Wow! These were truly excellent! Very light & tasty and easy to make! I used Heart Healthy Bisquick and added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to the mix before baking, as others suggested. Instead of butter, I used Smart Balance and added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder instead of 1/2 tsp. I will definitely be making these again!

I didn't think these were QUITE as light and melt-in-your-mouth as the restaurant ones, but they were still very, very good! And so easy too! As long as I keep a box of Bisquick on hand, I'll always have the ingredients to make these any time. They're a quick, tasty addition to any meal. I'm sure I'll be making them often.

Absolutely delicious! Although I don't like the taste of commercial biscuit baking mixes, so I used the Homemade Biscuit Mix recipe from this site. Made them for a group and received so many compliments! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

I found that they make it with cold water instead of milk. I don't know if that helps anyone.

I didn't have buttermilk baking mix so instead of using the plain milk that the recipe called for I made my own buttermilk by putting a tablespoon of lemon juice in a cup and pouring milk in the cup with the lemon juice to make 1 cup. Then I stirred and let sit for 5 minutes and added the 2/3 cup needed to the baking mix. I also doubled the cheese as others had suggested. I didn't have garlic powder either, only garlic salt, so I just added a little to melted butter and drizzled it on top of the buscuits before baking. I didn't add much garlic salt as I didn't want it to be too salty. I didn't add more butter after baking as I was bringing them somewhere and didn't want them to get soggy on top. They were very good.

These are so good! I'm always tempted to add more cheese because I love it but if you follow the recipe it makes them lighter I think. I also add parsley to the mix.  I always put waxed paper under the cooling rack and then brush with butter while they are cooling.  Then I stick the bottoms of the biscuits in the butter that dripped through as the finishing touch.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great as written. I doubled the cheese and added 3T of Johnny's dry garlic spread mix (Costco.) Brushed the top with butter and more garlic mix. I used my cookie scoop and got 12 biscuits. They packed quite a punch. Next time I'll cut the seasoning in half.

I have made these countless times and they always come out good.  My alterations this time made them even better.  I doubled the cheese (used sharp cheddar).  I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. onion powder to the dough.  I also added a couple of dashes of Old Bay (made a huge difference I think) and some parsley for color.  The garlic/butter mixture got some parsley for color too and I brushed it on both before and after baking.  TIP: Do not overmix!  The less you mix, the lighter they'll be!  Sooo Yummy!  Edited to add: This made 8 large biscuits for me.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for a little more cheese, and a little less butter)... and they turned out delicious! My batter ended up making 8 biscuits, they may have been a little bigger. Great appetizer for crab legs! Will definitely be making these again!

These are great. I add a dash of garlic powder to the baking mixture and since we love cheese, I add a little extra cheese as well!  Delicious!

I have to say I was skeptical about these tasting like the famous seafood restaurant but I'm so glad I was proven wrong. I had to pause after that first bite to take it all in..lol. My stepdaughter and husband agreed that these biscuits were amazing- and so inexpensive to make. A recipe like this could be dangerous to my waistline. Thanks so much for sharing =)

I too had trouble getting these to cook evenly.  The batter was very thick when made as stated in the recipe.  They turned out fine - but unfortunately, nothing special.  Would probably not make again.

Delicious.  I added the garlic powder to the dough and then used melted butter + 2 cloves minced garlic + teaspoon parsley to coat the tops before cooking.  The parsley adds color and the garlic is at just the right level.  I rolled them out and shaped cut out the biscuits instead of making them "drop" biscuits (for prettier presentation).  My mum loved them.

Fantastic and easy.  My 8yr grandson made these as a homeschool project.  He used a mini muffin pan and they came out as perfect little biscuits that he shared with his awed family.  I'll make the mini's myself and serve as hors d'ourves at my next party.

I tried to follow the recipe, but I didn't have cheddar.  The colby/mont.jack that I used was delish.  I tried several with garlic butter and just as many with only butter.  The biscuts w/o garlic were great for breakfast the next day.

I found this exact recipe on a copy cat site years ago, and I've been making these atleast once a month ever since. In my humble opinion, for 5 stars increase the garlic powder to a full tsp. and add a tsp each of onion powder and dried parsley flakes.  A touch of Old Bay can't hurt either. Also, using parchment paper is, for me, essential.

Really easy -- but I think a homemade dough would be worth the trouble.  The bisquick was a little too sweet for our tastes; almost seemed to clash with the garlic.  Added extra cheese and even with that, it pretty much disappeared into the mix and didn't leave a cheesy enough flavor.

I made these biscuits to accompany dinner, but they didn't even make it to the table.  They are as delicious as appetizers as they are as a complement to dinner.  I found that I do like more cheese than the recipe called for, but I'm crazy about cheese.  I also add a little parsley in the dry mix, it really looks so pretty.  I found that when I bake them at higher altitudes (I'm at 6,000 ft) they don't seem to be as light and fluffy as when I've baked them elsewhere, but the flavor was still there!  I hope to experiment with the recipe a bit to see if I can adjust to the altitude.  Either way I'm not worried about the flavor, they are delicious.

My biscuits burnt to the bottom of the pan while the tops were still soggy. We ended up throwing away the entire batch.

These were great!! i did exactly as the recipe stated except i realized half way through making it that i didnt have any milk so i just used plain water. I also added finely chopped onion, green pepper, jalapenos, and potatoes to the biscuit mix and then baked them. I served with a side of pizza sauce for dipping. They were FAB! didnt even last an hour!

WOW. THESE ARE THE BEST BISCUITS I'VE EVER MADE. I DIDN'T HAVE BUTTERMILK MIX SO I USE JIFFY BAKING MIX CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HAD ON HAND. I ADDED GARLIC POWDER AND FRESH MINCED GARLIC TO THE MIX AND TOOK THE ADVICE FROM OTHERS TO ADD MELTED GARLIC BUTTER BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THE OVEN. I TOOK IT A STEP FURTHER AND BRUSHED THEM HALF WAY THRU THE COOKING TIME AND THEN AGAIN WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE OVEN. MY BOYS LOVED THEM. THIS WILL BE A KEEPER IN MY FAMILY.

Great recipe - very easy and tasty! I followed some other suggestions and added more cheese and the garlic into the dough - (I did however used dry minced garlic instead of garlic powder). Also, I added about 1/4 cup of pre-grilled diced jalepeno peppers. YUM!!! My husband absolutely loves these biscuits.

My husband and I love to eat these as a snack. I normally half the recipe since it's just the 2 of us and these aren't good leftovers. I don't bother with brushing the melted butter and garlic on top either, I just mix the garlic powder into the biscuits. Yummy!

Doesn't taste like red lobsters biscuits, but they are alright, no matter how much cheese you use its still isnt as cheesy as reb lobsters, Im going to try the powdered cheese that comes with kfaft mac n cheese next time.

I doubled the cheese, added about two tablespoons melted butted and a shake of garlic powder to the batter, then mixed some salt and parsley in with the garlic butter for brushing on the top. When we were eating, I told my husband that I was trying to re-create the RL biscuits. He picked his up, took a bite, and said, "Maegan, these ARE the RL biscuits!" He then proceeded to eat almost the whole batch! One thing I would do for company is double the recipe... the original recipe made six big-ish biscuits... I think trying to stretch it into 12 would make them too small, and hey, just the two of us ate almost all six. I used the  Easy Biscuit Mixture from this site (I added Saco buttermilk mix to that) because I didn't have Bisquick. This recipe ROCKS and I will probably make it thousands more times.

Like others, I added extra cheese and garlic to the mixture.  I also didn't pay enought attention to the directions and added the melted butter to the dough before I baked them instead of brushing the butter on top after they baked.  They did turn out very moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

My only carb vice is bread and when I ran across this recipe, I couldn't resist. I too added a full cup of cheddar and additional garlic to the dough. Mixed some Italian seasonings with the butter. So good and thanks!

These biscuits are ugly as sin, but believe me, no one will care once they start chomping down on them! I followed others' suggestions here and increased the cheese, added  garlic powder to the dough, and added parsley to the melted butter. Sometimes I whip up more of the melted garlic butter and toss it with pasta to serve with the biscuits. Great recipe, and a definite keeper!

These truly are as good as the biscuits served at that certain seafood restaurant chain. Light and flaky, cheesy, savory bundles of bliss. The only thing I felt they needed was a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt added to the batter. I did not measure - just added to taste.

If these aren't the easiest things to make, I don't know what is!!  I added garlic powder to the batter and half again the amount of cheese (I love garlic and cheese!).  I served them with homemade beef stew.  My husband and I LOVED them!  No additional butter needed -- they stand alone!  He is now eating the rest of them for a late night snack.  I'll definitely be making more tomorrow.  They're great to make at the last minute because they only take 10 minutes to bake.  I love this recipe!

Scrumptious!  We used a parsley-garlic mixture and upped the cheese a bit, and the results were wonderful.  Given that the only thing I like at that certain seafood chain is these biscuits, now I never have to go there again!

WOW.  I'll admit I was sceptical - we love Red Lobster's biscuits.  These were TERRIFIC though!  I added more cheese than called for (lost track of what I was doing, probably used almost a cup!, I added garlic powder to the batter, and I brushed the biscuits with garlic butter before AND after baking.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Delish! I doubled the garlic powder... adding it both to the mix pre-baking and to the garlic butter.  I also added a little garlic salt to the garlic butter. (Too lazy to melt butter, so used a lower-fat faux butter spread.) Incredible. Loved by all..from 2 to 72.

I think you have to make sure not to put too much batter per biscuit or spread a little without packing. I couldn't cook mine long enough without burning the tops- the middle was a little pasty. But after nuking them later they tasted fabulous!

Very good biscuits. It is difficult to just eat one or two. They are a huge hit whenever I make them. One of my friends said that if there was only one food he could eat for the rest of his life, these biscuits would be it!

These were good...I had to use bisquick as I didn't have any buttermilk mix...but I still think that "seafood restaurant" makes the best.  Thanks for the recipe, though!!

I made these recently & boy they were as close to 'that popular seafood chains' biscuits as you can get. My husband was commenting on them days later. I also substituted Bisquick & everything turned great! This will definetly be in my regular rotation. Thanks!!

Really good biscuits! I also added the garlic powder into the mix.  I would definitely add more cheese next time.  They were a bit drier than the restaurant biscuits but GOOD!  :)

Oh my gosh these were SO good!  I used buttermilk biscuit mix instead of baking mix and just adjusted the wet ingredients to suit the consistency.  I got a ton of compliments on them and they will be in the regular rotation as well.  YAY!!

These biscuts came out great! I followed other's advice and added garlic powder to the dough and greased the baking sheet. We had them with American Chop Suey instead of regular garlic bread. I will make these again!

These cooked very unevenly at the recommended temperature.  They were burnt quickly & were still doughy in the middle.  I will keep trying to experiment with them though- I think eventually they'll be good.  I didn't have Bisquick so I used Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix, which worked surprisingly well!

I don't know what I did differently than everyone else, but I didn't like these.  They tasted very salty and stuck to the (non-stick) pan.

I have seen this recipe before and made these many times, but I add Italian seasoning to the butter.  These must be reheated in the oven for the best flavor.  I made them for Christmas Eve supper, and my daughter-in-law went absolutely crazy over them!!

I used gluten free baking mix and instead of regular milk, I used buttermilk, but added about 1/4 more since gluten free tends to absorb more moisture.  Very fluffy and slightly chewy = perfect biscuit that tasted like the real thing!

The only recipe that I’ve found that makes great gluten free biscuits! My wife can’t eat wheat so I have tried many different recipes to try and make a decent biscuit, this super simple recipe works.  The only thing that I change is I don’t use the garlic every time, sometimes I just want a basic biscuit. Oh, and I go slightly heavy on the cheese, because, cheese

Oh my biscuit goodness! Basted with the butter  mixture both before and after baking. These came out of the oven little golden perfections. Amazing taste and oh so easy to make. We loved these!

I follow the directions, the only change I made was that I doubled on the Cheese, butter and garlic powder.  The bisquits was excellent.

I FOLLOWED  the recipe to the letter .  The taste  was to flour. I  baked it well so it was not because of under baking.  Did baked many times before and this is the first time the baked goods has had this taste.   I would like to know if anyone else has had this problem

We enjoyed these and would make them again. However, I thought they were a bit dense, not the fluffy biscuits we usually make. I expected them to  be lighter because I changed the water to soured milk (lemon juice added to milk and allowed to sit until curdled) which usually has the effect of more rise and fluffiness. Otherwise, delicious.

I made these biscuits for our family.  I added parsley to the melted butter spread.  It was easy and faster than homemade
which was great because I was in a hurry, my kids liked them.
The taste was pretty good considering it was from a mix.

These taste great! Whenever I make them they go fast & there's usually a scuffle about the last one. However, you do need to keep an eye on them because they turn over from perfectly fluffy to hard & crunchy pretty fast. Great recipe & much better than the restaurant chain!

Much like Red Lobster, I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder for a more garlicky flavor..also put a pinch of chili powder in to add a bit of jazz-not really noticeable until the aftertaste.

Great with a saucy spaghetti

We liked these and I will be making them again.  I upped the cheese to 3/4 of a cup and threw the garlic powder in with the baking mixture.  I then melted the butter, added another 1/2 teaspoon of garlic power, 1/2 teaspoon of parsley and used that to brush on the biscuits before and after baking.

Not quite as fluffy as that "chain restaurant" but better flavor. Mine were a bit burnt on the bottom at the recommended minimum bake time so keep an eye on em. I WILL definitely make these again.

I used Bisquick as I didn't have any buttermilk mix and added a bit more cheese. Unfortunately, I used too much garlic powder so there was a strong garlic taste which was a bit of a turn off. Yes, they had a weird shape, but overall they tasted good.

I love this recipe. I do adjust it a little bit. Being a cheese lover, I use a little more cheese than this calls for. I also add parsley to the melted butter and brush it on both before and after baking.

EXCELLENT!  I read all the reviews and only tweaked this a bit.  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the dry mixture and increased the cheese to 1 cup. Oh, and I also added some parsley flakes to the butter/garlic mixture to brush on the biscuits. Gives it just a little more color!  Brushed the biscuits before and after baking and mine came out perfect and tasted amazing.  I didn't even need to butter them to eat; they were light and fluffy with just the perfect garlic flavor.  The recipe says "10 biscuits" but I ended up with 14 good size biscuits. This recipe will definitely be a keeper in my family!

This was nothing like the garlic-cheese biscuit I was looking for. I barely tasted the garlic or the cheese. I even took the advice of one review to double the garlic and cheese. Won't make again.

This recipe was awesome and so easy!  I used Bisquick mix (wasn't sure where to find buttermilk mix?).  The only things I did differently were add an additional 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the mix and some chives, and then used the garlic butter to coat before and after I cooked them (there was plenty to coat twice).  This recipe could not have been easier and was extremely delicious.

I have made these several times now and they are melt in your mouth delicious. I always add my own touches to any recipe and I rarely do the same thing twice, so I have added things each time I have made them. I put garlic salt or powder in the dough, not alot, but enough to flavor, I also add some parmesan cheese (not the powdery stuff), an italian seasoning mix of herbs is delicious as well and the last time I even added a bit of honey. But the biggest change I made was that I baked them in a mini muffin pan. I spray the pan and they come out easily. They are the perfect two bite size biscuits and ohhhh so yum!

I planned to make my own baking mix, only to discover my shortening had seen better days. So I substituted softened (not melted) butter for the shortening and, not wanting to add MORE butter to the recipe later, decided to just add the garlic powder to the dough and forego brushing them. They needed an extra two or three minutes in the oven, but they turned out light and delicious. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Wow these are deelish, fantastic flavor and texture!  I cannot wait to make these again!  I don't eat at chain restaurants like Red Lobster so I don't have anything to compare these to, but if there's a biscuit there that tastes like this, I'm very impressed!  Thank you Brenda for sharing your recipe! :)

These were okay. Little bland for my taste.  I'm not a big fan of baking mix  so probably will make from scratch next time.

I had biscuits like this at a friends house and had to make my own. I searched on here and this is pretty much the recipe my friend used. I use Bisquick, and I use water instead of milk. I add garlic to the dry mix. I also add dried parsley to the butter and garlic mixture, and I brush it on as soon as they come out of the oven. My family and I love them, I've made them many times and will continue making them.

These were just like Red Lobster. I followed reviewer suggestions: doubled the cheese, melted the butter and added garlic powder, also brushed on melted butter once they were done. Made with the Shrimp Scampi Bake by Kimber and was awesome.

the  key to the RL version of garlic cheese buns is the soy cheese.  Have you ever noticed that the buns at the restaurant aren-t melty?  Soy cheese won't melt.

Bisquick does not equal buttermilk complete baking mix!  They are both good in this recipe, but the buttermilk mix ones are much lighter and more addictive.  I used a WalMart brand of buttermilk mix for later batches.

1 cup cheese, mix the garlic into the biscuits

The amount of butter is a bit too much.  Just take the stick of butter you already have out for toast and take off pats with a fork to rub over the tops of the biscuits.

What a delicious treat!  My boyfriend doesn't stop eating these until the batch is gone.

I love these biscuits... so delicious! I brushed minced garlic instead of the garlic powder with the melted butter on the biscuits about a minute or 2 before I took them out of the oven and afterward also.  Plus I added a little minced garlic to the dough before I baked them for extra goodness.  Results= the butteriest and garlic infused biscuits I've ever had.  Plus it took me no time to prepare them.  This recipe is a great addition to anyone's mental cookbook!!

These are as good as the ones served at the popular restaurant, and super easy too!  I did add garlic to the batter in addition to adding it to the butter and I  also brushed them with the garlic/butter mixture before and after baking. Yummmmm!

I loved these, very tasty.  My 13 year old (who recently became a huge fan of the restaurant version) says they aren't as light and fluffy as the others, but he still likes them.  I must second (or...whatever number we're up to) the idea of brushing with garlic butter before baking as well as after.  I made two batches and the batch with the butter baked in was much better IMO.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  If you want them to taste like the seafood restaurant, be sure to brush garlic butter all over the biscuit and not just over the tops.  We loved these and will definitely be making them again.

Excellent Biscuits! Like others, I added the garlic powder to the rest of the biscuit ingredients before mixing and then also added a small amount to the melted butter. Brushed the butter on before baking and again after removing from the oven. I didn't mention that others on this site thought that they tasted like Red Lobster's famous biscuits but as soon as my son tasted one, that is exactly what he said. These will be added to our "favorite" file. Thank you for sharing!

Made them just like the recipe said. Turned out great. I used a sharp cheddar but wished the cheese was sharper. That's my fault for using cheap cheese though.

Light, fluffy, cheesy goodness. These sounded and looked great so i had to try them. Was not disappointed one bit. Made a batch of 10 and they just disappeared. Will absolutely be making these again as everyone loved them :-)

Yummy!.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe. I mixed and baked as per the recipe.  After brushing with margarine, I then sprinkled with garlic salt (rather than garlic powder). I placed the biscuits under a hot broiler until crunchy on top.  Very good!!!

Sooo yummy!  First thing that was complimented at the dinner table by everyone!  I didn't have sharp cheddar and I think that would have been what would have put these biscuits over the top!

I used a clove of crushed garlic because I did not have garlic powder.  These were a huge hit at dinner!!  Super easy to make too!

So tasty!  They really do taste like the ones you get at "that place".  The only thing I did differently from what was written was added a bit more cheese.  My family requested that I make this at least once a week from now on!

this recipe was great! i did use garlic in the mix and used extra cheese i read in one of the  reviews that the bottoms of the biscuits kept burning u can prevent this by putting a empty cookie sheet on the shelf below your biscuits to block some of the direct heat, that always works for me!

These were good, but I mixed in a teaspoon of garlic powder and a little bit of melted butter into the dough. Also added much more cheese and sprinkled the tops with dried parsley. They tasted amazing.

These were really good warm. I'm a butter fanatic, so I would suggest using a bit more. I did a couple coats of garlic butter and that worked nicely.

I've been making these for years, especially when I am making a pasta dish.  Although I have tweaked them a time or two, we prefer them made strictly according to the recipe.  Just our personal preference.  Easy and delicious.

We loved these biscuits.  They are easy and delicious.  I did 1/4c more cheese and used sharp chedder but will add even more the next time and put garlic into the mix.  I used Bisquick but am going to try Jiffy the next time then probably the recipe for mix on this website. I just love how easy they were to make and like others they all didn't make it to the table, too good to let alone.  Thank you for a great recipe.

We didn't think these were THAT similar to the biscuits from the "popular seafood chain." That being said, they were excellent in their own right, and this recipe will be kept and used frequently. To mix it up a bit, I will try different cheeses and herbs.

I made a little alteration to the recipe by adding a little dried parsley and garlic powder to the mix, then after they were cooked I only used about 2 tbsp. melted butter which was also mixed with parsley and garlic powder.  Very good!

I've made these with both the Bisquick and the Jiffy mixes and think I prefer them made with the Jiffy mix.  The Bisquick mix was a little too heavy.  Overall, pretty good biscuits, but still not as light and fluffy as "that seafood restraunt".

Simplify wonderful! I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used Gouda instead. I doubled the cheese and added garlic twice, when I mixed the ingredients and in the butter. I was a bit skeptical how it would turn out with the other cheese, but it was really good. My husband liked it!

These were o.k.  I did not really think they tasted like the seafood biscuits though - it is missing something - but I'm not sure what.  I also had trouble with the bottoms sticking to the pan.  Kids said they were good though.

I did it, I successfully baked something!  I did increase the cheese and added more cheese as was recommended by others.  I have NEVER backed anything that turned out. My son actually asked me to make more.

I've been cooking this recipe since I was 13 years old. It's a great, delicious side dish to many meals. I do make a couple of changes: I use 1 cup of cheese instead of 1/2 cup, and I also mix in 1 Tbsp of minced garlic.

This recipe could not be any easier or more delicious!  I am always grateful to find any recipe that is both quick and tasty, and this is certainly one of those recipes.  I will definitely be adding this as a regular in my kitchen.  I thought brushing the biscuits with butter and garlic powder provided plenty of garlic flavor, and the biscuits came out light and fluffy.  Sometimes biscuits can be too dense and too dry but these were perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Close to Red Lobster biscuits, but not exactly.  These do seem a little heavier, so I may try the Jiffy biscuit mix others suggest.  I added a pinch of salt to the topping as someone else suggested, and that did seem to improve them.

I made  a large batch of these to serve at the  jail. It was a very simple and quick bread to make. I froze the leftovers and used them a week later and they kept very well.

These were good biscuits! I would not call them exactly the same as the seafood restaurant ones but they were nice! I followed the recipe exactly. I did get lots of compliments on them!

I added a 1/2 tsp of garlic to the mixture before baking and used 1 cup of marble cheese, (as suggested by other reviewers), it turned out great! although I found I didn't need to use all the butter, I might halve that part next time. Will definitely be making this again

I think these biscuits are wonderful I love garlic I think I get that from my mom bless her heart. I love the biscuits you get at Red Lobster they are sooo yummy. When I make this recipe though I use the biscuit mix that has garlic and cheese already in the batter and add more mild or sharp cheddar cheese to the mixer. It adds a little more garlic flavor if you are a garlic nut like me. Make sure you use the the butter mixture over the top, it makes them so soft, moist and of course garlicky yum.

I made these last night and followed the recipe.  I would add more cheese and flatten the biscuits down next time to achieve a similar look to the chain restaurant.

These taste just like the biscuits from our favorite seafood restaraunt.  I used 2/3 cup of cheese and sprinkled parsley flakes on top after baking.

Very easy to make though I didn't measure anything.  Just added what I thought would be right.  My husband loved them.  Said they were better than the ones he eats at Red Lobster.  And so simple too. :D

These were better than expected because I don't usually like "biscuit mix" biscuits.  But I used fat-free Pioneer brand and they came out great except that the bottoms blackened before the cooking time was done (hate that).  Maybe a lower oven temperature and a couple more minutes would do the trick.  These were gone before dinner was even served!

Quick and easy but needs some spices or somthing. I doubled the cheese and added the garlic powder to the baking mix, but I think some Italian herbs or something more needs to be added. Maybe some fresh garlic.

So easy to make! I mixed garlic powder with the dough. I think they would be good with green onions as others suggested. I only used 2 Tbls of melted butter for the tops, and it still tasted great without the extra fat.

5 stars for flavor, but 4 for looks.  I used the buttermilk pancake mix I had on hand.  I used a cup of cheddar and added the garlic powder to the mix.  I still added garlic powder to the butter and also some parsley as others stated.  These flattened out a lot during cooking, but tasted AMAZING.  I couldn't keep the husband or daughter away from them!  Will most definitely make again, but maybe with a different mix.  Thanks!

These biscuits are absolutely divine! So simple and easy to make. I also used Bisquick, and a teeny bit more cheese as other reviewers suggested. I thought the dough might have been too sticky but they came out perfect. YUM YUM. Very good with Golden Potato Soup recipe also from this site.

THESE WERE SO SIMPLE.  I only needed about 4 or 5 biscuits, so i cut the recipe in half.  I used Hungry Jack Buttermilk pancake mix and half & half instead of milk, and added a little more milk because the biscuit mix seemed a little dry, along with a shredded mexican blend of cheese. THANK YOU SO MUCH!  TASTE BETTER THAN THE RED 'SEAFOOD' JOINT!  THANK YOU!

Made this for dinner  last night it was incredible. I just handed my husband his plate and when he asked what it was  I just told him take a bite and find out.  All it took was one bite and he said "Wow, it's the RL biscuits!" lol. Thank you for this great recipe, you've made this newlywed's life a little bit happier.

I made my own buttermilk biscuits and added the cheese and garlic powder to the recipe.  Yum!
 I must say, they stuck to my pan though.

My husband loves these.  Normally he would want to go to a well known restaurant for these but once I got the recipe for these little darlings, I just make them at home anytime he wants them.

I've been making this recipe for years and my family loves it.  The only thing I do different, after the butter and garlic powder has been brushed on the tops of each biscuit, is I add a small pinch of dill weed (from the box--not the fresh) on top of each biscuit.

YUMMY!!! Wonderful taste. They do taste a lot like Red Lobster's biscuts but next time I am going to add a little garlic powder to the dough to give it a little more garlic taste like Red Lobster!! Now, if only I can find their alfredo recipe!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!! I highly recommend :-)

Tasted very good -- it's been so long since I was at Red Lobster, I can't compare the two.  I didn't have Cheddar cheese, so I used a Colby / Jack blend. I used Bisquik as my base.  I might add more garlic next time.  Went well with my Cheese Manicotte.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, but my biscuits weren't light and flaky - they were dense and thick.  They weren't as good as the ones served at the popular seafood restaurant chain.  Thanks anyway!

I would give these more than five stars if I could!  Just as good or better than the famous seafood restaurants.  My whole family gobbled them up and my daughter said I should serve them with every meal.  A definite keeper!

WOW! These are absolutely delish! When I first served them my fiance took a small piece off to try one, and then moved the plate next to him to get a bigger bite. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it does stick to your ribs a little, but it's worth working with. Thanks!

Very, very good little biscuits.  Although I couldn't find buttermilk baking mix, Bisquick worked just fine. Be sure the garlic powder doesn't stay in the bottom of the bowl when brushing on the melted butter.  It adds so much to the flavor....

These are so incredibly easy to make and so delicious! My fiance ate 4 of them! I didn't have garlic salt so I just mixed a 1/2 tsp table salt w/ 1/2 tsp garlic powder and used a pinch to dust each biscuit. They were perfect and my sweetie said they tasted just like Red Lobster. These will make many appearances on our table in the future.
