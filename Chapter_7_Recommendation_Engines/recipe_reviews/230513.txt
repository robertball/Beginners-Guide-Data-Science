these couldn't be any easier to make with very little utensils and dishes to do after!  Great for a last minute treat for parties or holiday trays.  I made one batch as written.  They are very good, only take a few minutes in the refrigerator to harden up and slide right off the silpat-lined cookie sheet.  They have a subtle peanut butter flavor.  I made a second batch using milk chocolate chips, and added some coursely chopped butter pretzels to the mix with the other ingredients.  These were also great!  This is a very versatile recipe with endless combinations of chips or add-ons.  *I would suggest if you want a more peanut buttery flavor to the recipe as written, I'd use one cup white chocolate, and 1 cup pb butter chips.  Thanks for this great recipe.  They look really festive with the little jimmies and holiday sprinkles on top.

I am not crazy about peanut butter or white chocolate, but  for some reason combining them is wonderful.  My oven is broken this year, so I made all no bake treats to give away.  I ended up making 4 batches of these, because we kept eating them before I could give them away.
