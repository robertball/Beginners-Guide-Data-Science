I must say as far as refrigerator oatmeals go, this is a really good one. The all fruit preserves I used was all the sweetener I needed. I also subbed golden flax seed for the chia seeds.

I've made it several times and with different fruit and preserves. It was very tasty each time and a nice change from cooked oatmeal.

I used 1% milk and also added a  tblsp of both chopped pecans and ground flaxseed.  I didn't want to open a jar of raspberry preserves, so I just used what I had available, strawberry preserves. I'm not overly fond of raspberries (I used chopped frozen) because they can be a little tart and seedy. Any fruit would work here, and dried cranberries.
