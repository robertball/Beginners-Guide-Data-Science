I've made this exact recipe for years. It's always perfect and delicious. The original recipe was designed as a make ahead. That may explain why people had trouble with it not being firm enough. If you make the night before and refrigerate then bake in the morning, covered with foil,  for and hour, remove foil and bake another 15-20min,  it will be perfect

We loved it!   After reading reviews I added a tablespoon of biscuit mix so it would firm up better.  I learned this trick from a quiche recipe and it works great.  Will make again maybe adding onions and other veggies.  Would make for any meal not just breakfast.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Great for dinner!  Add diced tomatoes and onion for a nice alternative.  My husband loved it!

We really enjoyed this, though I did make some significant "tweaks".  I halved the recipe for an 8X8 pan, though I found I did still need to use the full amount of eggs/milk to cover the rest of the ingredients.  I added diced green pepper and onion, so they may have accounted for the need for more egg mixture.  I kept the spices the same as the full recipe and added about 1/8tsp white pepper.  While we did enjoy this, I think i'd prefer everything mixed together, using hash browned potatoes in place of the frozen prepared patties.  Regardless, a great jumping off point to customize to YOUR preference.  THANKS for the recipe!

Stop giving negative reviews b/c pictures seem to have extra ingredients. The creator of the recipe can't help it if people modify their recipe and submit the photo, guys. And the printing glitch isn't their fault, either. STOP.

I used roasted potatoes and ham left over from christmas dinner. It was a hit! My family loved it. I will make it again and maybe add broccoli.

I LOVE recipe.  I've been making it for at least 5 years.  It's always a huge hit.  I've made it with ham, turkey ham, and no meat at all (but I add a bunch of chopped spring onions.)  I really like using Coleman's mustard for the dry mustard.  It adds a great flavor.  I just made it again for Mother's Day brunch.  I couldn't find hash brown patties, so I used tater tots.  Even that was good.  This recipe is foolproof!

This was a good easy recipe. I used leftover ham from Christmas Eve. I had 8 eggs left so I used them all, instead of 7. Who wants one egg leftover! I also didn't have dry mustard so I added black pepper and some hot sauce. I also threw in a diced yellow pepper that I needed to use up. My 16 yr old son and I actually had this for dinner, and then I ate leftovers for breakfast the next few days. Very satisfying and yummy. I'm sure you could add other vegetables that you have in the fridge that need to be used up. Would probably even be good with swiss cheese instead of cheddar.

Made this for my son and fiancé.  Made have with bacon for my son who doesn't like ham and made the other half as written.  They LOVED it.  Going to be making this on Christmas for breakfast.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  Trying to get my son to eat breakfast is hard, so when he devoured this I knew I would be making this often. :)

Didn't have hash brown patties, so I used a bag of country style hash browns with peppers and onions in it,  was delicious.  Very easy to make.  Will definitely make again.

I keep reviewing this recipe and it never appears! This recipe needs work. I read the reviews and you need to pre-cook the has browns. I also added sautéed mushrooms, onions, carrots, and green onions for taste.

This was good, I did tweek it the second time, making as directed but I bought frozen shreeded hash browns and put in baking pan covering the bottom and up to sides, baked it first so it gets brown and cooked. Then poured the mixture in and cooked it.I think I like it cooked first this way, but it is an extra step. It's still good with uncooked patties so either way is good. I also like to do sausage, onion and cheddar and jack cheese to my sausage one. Sorry, I hate when people tweek their recipes on the recipe sites, and here I've done it! But hope it helps.

I made it and it turned out great! I used tater crowns on the bottom and pre-baked them for about 10min before I put the other ingredients on. I ended up frying some chicken sausage and putting that on along with the ham and it turned out really good. Make sure to season all the layers or it turns out bland. Also I only used 8 oz of cheese and it seemed to be enough. I am a big fan of cheese but 2 lbs seemed to be way too much. I made it for dinner and it made a great meal. I will definitely make again.

Prepared a day ahead, I made one with ham and one with crumbled bacon. Easy to assemble.  The next morning, I popped them in the oven and baked according to directions, then let them set about 10 minutes before cutting into them. Delicious, simple, my guests loved them, and I wasn't a slave to the stove. I'll definitely make this again, maybe adding some veggies next time.

I made it  with bacon instead of ham.  I added onions and green pepper.  I cooked the bacon, onions and green pepper in a frying pan before putting into the baking dish.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as stated.  It was excellent.  It held together nicely  to cut into pieces.  Everyone loved it.

This is great. My WHOLE family loved it, even my picky 4 year old. Will make again. Added mild green chiles 4.5 oz can. That was all I changed/added. It took mine almost 2 hrs to cook though. Still great!!

I make it in mini loaf pans for an individual grab and go in the morning and the oblong hashbrowns  fit  in pan perfectly. Bit bland for us so I add green onions , garlic and dash red pepper flakes, bake, cool, and then freeze for future use. In the morning, I put frozen mini loaf in toaster oven on warm setting for 30 minutes and it defrosts and warms up completely and can be eaten in hand without a fork. Perfect for school mornings on the go.

Very tasty and a great one dish meal to carry to a potluck brunch. I used 10 eggs and sautéed bell pepper and onion in with the meat. I used sausage, but I'll try it with ham next time. Everyone loved it!

I  make this without meat, as I don't care for meat at breakfast, and this recipe is so delish. I make it exactly as written, but without the ham. I put in chopped green pepper, chopped red onion and garlic, and thinly sliced roma tomatoes. With all the cheese it's  heavenly. I  also add the Tbs of baking mix as others suggested, so it firms up well. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe,  just love it.

Loved it! Every year I make an egg casserole for my husband and his son before they head out early morning to hunt; I wanted to try something different this year (I usually make the one that uses lots of bread and sausage). I had a bag of regular frozen hash browns on hand, so used those instead of going out and buying the kind the recipe calls for.  Otherwise didn't change a thing.  I put it together the night before since they leave the house at 6a.m., and put it in the oven early early morning.  I was worried that there were too many potatoes and the middle wouldn't be done, but it all cooked together nicely.  Didn't need to add Bisquick like others mentioned. Perhaps the only change I would make is to mix some of the cheese in with the potatoes (but that's more a result of using the bag of hash browns).  Next time I might saute the hash browns first just to see if there's a difference, but it was good as-is.

Super easy, especially if you prep your ingredients the day before. The use of frozen hash brown patties as the 'crust' works well, no soggy-ness!

This was perfect.  I did make it the day before as mentioned in a review and it came perfectly out of the pan.  I used just the loose frozen McCain hashbrowns as I had them and threw a little bit of bacon in with the ham.  Green onions when in too but that was just to make it pretty.  The casserole turned out amazing and was a big hit.  This will be made again and again.  I might use mushrooms with the ham the odd time just to change it up a bit.  Thank you!

my husband and son love it. My son said it tastes like potatoe skins.  He put Ranch dressing on them. So later I tried dinner I put the Ranch dressing on it I feel in love WILL MAKE AGAIN. I had added half of  a pound of bacon with the ham. NO NOT COOK THE HASHBROWN PATTIES!!! I WAS READING REVIEWS

I  made this today and it turned out great! I used Potatoes O'Brien, as suggested by another reviewer. The onions and peppers, really made the flavors pop! I only used three cups of cheese, which was plenty. This will be my new Christmas brunch casserole.  Next time I'll try it with sausage.

This is a good base recipe that is so easy to play with. Use whatever type of meat you like, bacon is our preference. Mushrooms, onions and spinach. Make it spicy with pepper jack and your favorite hot peppers. It's not just for breakfast either.

Loved this recipe.  Easy to make.  The only changes I made were to use a 32 oz bag of frozen southern style hash browns (which is what I had on hand) and I added some green onions.  After taking the foil off, I only needed to put it back in the oven for about 7-8 minutes.  I might try one extra egg and a little more milk next time but overall it was really good.

This is the first Breakfast casserole i cooked, it's perfect for me, and my friends love it. I use sausage, don't see any reason to try a different one.  I looked around, but this is easy and fits our tastes and out needs.

I made this for Christmas morning and everybody enjoyed it. The only thing I would do differently the next time would be to roast the hash browns in the oven first, before mixing them instead of just cooking them stovetop. They got mushy and I would have preferred some crunch.

Everyone loved this dish, for Christmas brunch. Definitely a new favorite. As with many other reviewers, I made a few minor changes, mostly quantities. They are as follows:

Used a generous 1 1/2 lbs Buyer's Best potato rounds from Winco. Added 2 eggs. Reduced cheese to 2 3/4 cup plus dotted the top with Costco smoked gouda. Reduced ham to approx 1/2 lb. Added 5 pieces cooked bacon, chopped. Used 1/2 cup dairy and 1/2 almond milk. Refrigerated overnight before cooking as directed. Thank you goalie girl.

Love this!  So easy!  Instead of the spices in recipe I added a packet of dry ranch mix to the egg milk mixture. I have another similar recipe that calls for that and it worked well with this. I also used ground country sausage instead of ham because that’s what I had. We all loved it. Thanks so much for sharing!

I added bacon, yellow pepper and asparagus. Used sharp cheddar and 4 blend Mexican cheese without jalapeños. Used the bacon grease to coat the pan. Sautéed the diced ham in butter, didn’t add extra salt. DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is awesome. You can easily make it gluten free with the right brand of potato patties. Sometimes I’ll add roasted broccoli or asparagus and serve it for dinner.

This morning casserole was PHENOMENAL !!!!  I decided to make this for Easter Brunch and was it a HIT !!!!  I made it the night before Easter and covered it with tinfoil and stored it in the refrigerator.  We substituted a package of bacon (in place of the ham) and followed the recipe exactly as indicated in this recipe !!  It was the BEST and I had nothing but rave reviews about it !!!  This is my new "go-to" for anytime guests come to stay with us !!!  Make it the night before they get here and we have an easy-peasy breakfast the next morning !!!  The hash brown patties are a brilliant  in that it makes it a one-meal complete dish !!!!  We threw a fruit salad and banana bread along with the casserole, and everyone loved my Easter brunch !!!!  Thanks for this recipe !!!

This was a hit with everyone in the family even those that don’t enjoy hash browns.  To be fair, I did not use hash brown patties.  I used frozen cubed potatoes (some people call them cottage fries).

I followed the recipe but I didn't have ham, so I used 1lb of fresh breakfast sausage from the deli, and of course, some bacon for my bacon loving family.  The kids had 2nds and maybe 3rds, and were fighting over who got the one leftover piece the next morning! A HIT!

I added a can of diced green chilis per someone's suggestion. I also used 12 eggs instead of 7... seven seemed so little for all those potatoes, ham and cheese. 12 eggs was good. I did add 1 T baking mix.  I think it would have been better with bacon or sausage instead of the ham, and sauteed onions instead of the chilis, but I needed something fast and easy since I was making a big dinner and all the other prep for Christmas. It did the job.

Loved this though I used about half as much cheese and a couple more eggs. It was actually taken to Easter breakfast at my church, and it was all gone when we started cleaning up.

Quick and easy, as advertised. Not sure why people feel the need to add biscuit mix, but the eggs WILL bake firm on their own. You just have to be patient and let them cook.

Very tasty.  Used lactose free milk and added just a bit of green onion and a couple of shakes of red pepper.  Was a hit with everyone.

It's not the prettiest thing but every time I put that first bite in my mouth, I get so happy. Rave reviews by everyone who eats it. Used pepper jack instead of cheddar and that worked great. I don't know what anyone else is saying, this recipe works exactly as written. The hash browns do NOT need to be pre-cooked. I feel a little bad that frozen hashed browns aren't that healthy for you, but oh well. #worthit

I will definitely make this again.  It was easy for a Saturday morning when I had the time for the 1 hour 15 minutes to bake.  Came out just perfect and was wonderful.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  I used about 3 cups of cheese instead of four to reduce the calories a bit.

I made it according to the recipe. I agree with some other reviewers that the hash browns should be cooked first. Onion, peppers, and mushrooms would also help.

I stayed pretty close to the recipe. Only change was as I used ham, I didn't add salt.  I DRAINED & placed on towel paper before I added 1/2 can DRAINED green chili's. Also sauteed green onions & mushrooms & seasoned with ACCENT.
I made it for a dinner breakfast. My husband loved it - -It was delicious. I plan on making it for a yearly neighborhood breakfast gathering.

I made this for 3 people and there was way too much.  I would make it is a square pan and there would still be left overs.

This recipe was a great hit in my home!

Made this for breakfast this morning for house guests & received great compliments. I subbed tater tots for the hash brown patties because that's what I had on hand. Also used 10 eggs & only about half a cup of milk. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will definitely make it again!!!

I only used half the cheese, but otherwise made it exactly as written. It was very easy to make and came to together quickly. I made it in the morning and left it in the fridge until I was ready to cook it for dinner.

Will make again but cook less than what it says and use less cheese. Hollandaise over it would be good. Kind of dry cooked at that length of time

Be careful not to use too many potatoes in the bottom. I might also try one additional egg next time - because there definitely will be a next time.

I used 1 cup of cheese and 1/2 lb of ham, and hash browns instead of patties.  Added 1/2 red bell pepper, 3 chopped green onions, 1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes.  Mixed it all together instead of layering and made it the night before.  It turned out great!  Not soggy, too much cheese or too salty from the ham.

This is an excellent go to recipe for lazy morning breakfast for the family.  I have tried variations of this casserole.  Add mozzarella cheese with the cheddar,  substitute cooked bacon instead of ham, even add some chopped vegetables.  All works well.  Great basic recipe.

I like to follow the recipe exactly the first time to try it then see if I want to make changes based on taste so I did and we all liked it. I found i wanted to convert to a light recipe since we are on weight watchers so next time I'll use an egg substitute .

Made it as directed and the potatoes came out raw.  Next time, I'll cook those first.  Even with crunchy potatoes, my husband liked it.

I made this lactose free with lactose free 3 cheese blend and almond milk. I also increased eggs to 10 and almond milk to 1 1/2 cups and so that it would be fluffier,  and adjusted spices accordingly, also added 2 green onions..  Cooked for same amount of time. It is wonderful... love that this is a gluten free option to quiche!

Didn't follow exactly due to availablity,  (I used bacon, and shredded hashbrowns, because that's what was on hand, and I added an extra egg for firmness) but otherwise fixed as directed--mine was done in 45 minutes, and was a big hit here. My husband liked it enough to post a picture of it. The mustard was a nice addition--thanks for a tasty, easy, and versatile recipe!

I made this and added green onions. I found it strange it wasn't in the recipe, when the picture shows something green in it. Didn't know if it was onions or bell peppers. I don't like bell peppers; so the onions were great m

I made it almost exactly as written. I cut the recipe in half, used regular hash browns and half-and-half milk since I wanted to use up both of those ingredients. I also replaced the egg substitute with regular eggs--1 egg = 1/4 c. egg substitute. I really liked the recipe but next time I'd add some peppers or onions. It was a little bland. It certainly was easy to make and would be easy to make ahead of time.

Made some changes: used 9 eggs to cover the potatoes. Next time I will not add the salt as I think there is enough from the ham and potatoes. I will make it again and think I will enjoy it more if it wasn't so salty.

This dish was amazing. I did add diced tomatoes and onions to it and also added about 1 tbsp of instant pancake mix to the eggs to thicken them up a bit. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday breakfast and he LOVED it! Very flavorful with the ham. :)

Everyone loved it.  Be sure to use a good quality ham, like Boar's Head.  Easy to chop and grate everything the night before, then just layer ingredients and bake in the morning.  Thanks for a great recipe!
