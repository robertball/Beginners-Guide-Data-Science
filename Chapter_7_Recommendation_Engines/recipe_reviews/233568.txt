I love the Crystal Light Mocktail flavors, but had yet to try the Mojito. I stumbled across this recipe and it sounded so good that I ran out right away and bought the drink mix. This is THE PERFECT summer drink. Very refreshing, very easy, what more could you want on a hot day?  This is now a staple in my house! Thanks for the recipe Tammy Jean!

Very refreshing. Not sweet but tart but much less than lemonade. I also love the smell of the cucumber before taking a sip.
