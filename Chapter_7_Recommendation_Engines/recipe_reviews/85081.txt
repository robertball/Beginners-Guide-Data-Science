This was an amazing recipe! I definitly reccomend buying fresh halibut. And use half fresh, half canned tomatoes, and never garlic powder! Just  crushed garlic.

good way to dress up even an inexpensive whiting fish and a cheap chardonnay.  Did not use powders, but the real deal; onion and garlic sauteed in a little EVOO.  Used nicoise olives and added some herbs de provence along with the others.  Sprinkled the fish w/Old Bay, S&P before baking.  Served over couscous.  Could easily sub capers for the olives, or slice up some fennel bulb to saute along with the onions/garlic for an additional mediterranean flavor.  Quick, easy, and tasty.

Absolutely fabulous, light and delicious. I made it for my husband and his cousin (who are not fish lovers) and they even had seconds. It reminds me of a seafood dish made at a local Italian restaurant but they don't have olives in it. The minor adjustment I made to the recipe was salt the sauce.

I used kalamata olives, which overpowered the dish for us.  Might be better with plain black olives (or no olives at all... after picking out the olives, the tomato sauce was delicious with the fish).

Delicious, Quick & Easy! I didn't have  olives handy, so I used 2 tablespoons of capers. Used Flounder for fish and had to cook 5-10 minutes longer. This recipe is definitely a keeper - served over mashed potatoes and my husband and I loved it. I'll have to try it with the next type of fish he catches.

I'm always on the lookout for recipies that remind me of the wonderful food of France, and this one surely does.  The sauce enhances the fish's delicate taste without overpowering.  Just be careful with your salt, as the olives add quite a bit themselves.

This recipe was pretty good.  Something different than what I am used to.  I've added it to my recipe box.  I used fresh garlic and sauteed it with the onions in the first part of the recipe.  I also added a pinch of sugar to the tomato sauce to cut the acidity.  I omitted the olives since I did not have any on hand, it turned out really good.  Thank you for the recipe I will use it again.

Ready in no time, healthy and yummy! My boyfriend, who is usually quite neutral to fish, loved this. A definite keeper but you need more seasoning (garlic is great to add flavour to the sauce).

I made this recipe using fresh halibut.  It was absolutely delicious.  Also had no canned tomato in the house so substituted fresh.

Really good, and easy, just a little prep. Then cook the fish later.

This recipe was pretty good, though not fantastic.  I rubbed some of the herbs into the halibut before baking it the first time (before adding S&P), and also added salt to the tomato sauce, as others did.  That helped spice up what could have been a very bland dish

Great recipe as is. Lately, just because I'm on a fresh everything kick, I use fresh herbs and have started using fresh tomatoes in this.

Nice, but to *really* put on the Provencal dog, use a thinly-sliced leek in place of the onion, and add a bit of orange zest too.

Great easy recipe. I try not to use anything out of a can so I use fresh tomatoes and simmer a little longer than recipe calls for. I've made this several times and my husband loves it.
