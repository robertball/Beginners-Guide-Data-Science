This is a really, really good basic recipe but it's definitely missing the necessary garlic; about 1 tablespoon minced.

For a truly traditional Doro Wat try adding 1/2 tsp each of fenugreek, cardamom and nutmeg and also clarify the butter (clarifying is really easy and you can make extra and freeze it for furure use). 

For those who like traditional spicy Ethiopian heat; double or triple the paprika and cayenne. 

One last important tip is to cut six shallow lengthwise slits in the eggs before placing them in the stew for heating so that they can soak up some of the awesome stew flavors ;-)

Good recipe, well recieved by the family. I substituted chicken thighs,  doubled the cayenne and paprika and added a jalape√±o (we like our food with a little kick.) Served as the base of a full Ethiopian meal, it was still being raved about at breakfast.

Very bland, will add more berbere, garlic, and salt to make it more palatable.
