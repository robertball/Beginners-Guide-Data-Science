Recipe definitely has potential, but needs a couple tweeks...  If I were to make again I would saute the celery before adding to stuffing and add more sausage as 4 oz is not enough for this huge pan of stuffing. My stuffing also needed 4 cups of stock or else it would have been too dry.  I did leave out cilantro because my family doesn't care for it.  It's worth trying though and overall I thought it was tasty.

This recipe is now on the permanent list for Thanksgiving dinners.  In addition to the butternut squash, I added summer squash and also water chestnuts for a little bit of crunch.  I left out the sausage... just a personal preference.  I also used some of the leftover juice from the turkey to moisten up the dish a bit.  This dish was probably our favorite on the table this year.  And it makes a lot - the leftovers are great!

I really liked the flavors and it was an excellent way to encourage the picky members of my family to eat their vegetables. Made with the 'Easy Mexican Fried Chicken' on this site.  Yum!
