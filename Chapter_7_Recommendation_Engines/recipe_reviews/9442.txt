The flavor of the filling is very good! I would recommend adding 1 Tbs. of either glucose or corn syrup to the unmelted chocolate and store in a seperate bowl. Heat the cream and butter as directed and pour it over the chocolate and zest. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes, then stir. Add the liquor last. Let the mixture sit in the fridge overnight... it will be more firm and have better orange flavor the next day. I would *not* recommend adding oil to the chocolate used for coating as it slows it from hardening. Also, do not be tempted to freeze the filling... the chocolate shell will crack if the filling is frozen!

A HUGE hit for Christmas! Definitely chill well between steps and I put the balls in the freezer for 30 minutes before dipping in the chocolate, which gave them a very professional look as the chocolate coating firmed up immediately. This one is perfect for a busy cook as the steps can take place over the course of a couple of days. Double the recipe because everyone will want them!

Very delicious and easy!  I made these to give as homemade Valentine's Day candy.  I would make the following recommendations to the recipe:  double the recipe, I ended up with 28 very small chocolates.  I would double the recipe and make larger balls.  I had trouble getting my filling to get firm enough.  Even after 2+ hours of chilling it wasn't firm enough to roll.  So I scooped out the size balls I wanted onto a lined cookie sheet, then placed them in the FREEZER for 30 minutes, then I rolled them into balls, and "froze" for another 15 minutes longer before rolling them in the cooled chocolate coating.

Contrary to what may have been written by others, this recipe is very good and not too difficult to complete.  The key is patience.  I followed the recipe exactly and these truffles came out very well.  But you must be sure to refrigerate the chocolate for at least 2 hours, then again after scooping and after rolling.  That makes a huge difference in the end result.  My only complaint was that I found the chocolates needed more sugar and a stronger flavor.  The liquier just couldn't compete with the strength of the semi-sweet chocolate.  ADDITIONAL NOTE:  You must keep these refrigerated.  If they get to room temperature the ganache melts.

I made these using grand marnier.  Instead of dipping in chocolate, I prefer my truffles rolled in cocoa, this worked fine.  These are excellent, distinct orange flavor, but not too much.  Melt in your mouth.

These were very good!  I have to say, though, that I missed the professional look of tempered chocolate.  I rolled half of them in pecans and the other half in cocoa.  Freezing the balls for thirty minutes before coating them in chocolate made them very easy to work with.  I just read in a magazine that, in order to avoid the foot that comes from coating with too much chocolate, pour some chocolate in your hand and roll the truffle in it.  You have more control than dipping in chocolate.  I doubled the recipe; the original recipe doesnâ€™t make many truffles.  Very nice and easy!

I could hardly believe it, but it worked:  I substituted organic coconut milk for the cream, and organic palm oil shortening for the butter.  Added two tablespoons of homemade vanilla extract (it's not as strong as store-bought) instead of the orange flavor:  and it all worked.  And my dairy-allergic and corn-allergic family can enjoy truffles! I am one happy momma.  Thank you, thank you for this forgiving and adaptable recipe!!  Now if I can just stop eating them myself...

Made these last night.  Oh My God Are They Good!!!  Had a bit of a hard time getting the filling to chill stiff enough.  But they turned out great.  I also made a batch with Kahlua and instant coffee and they were good as well.

This recipe is delicious. I made them for my mom because her favorite thing is orange and chocolate. Be patient with this recipe. Here are some things I did to alter it that work wonderfully:  1. Get the most use out of the orange you bought by zesting 1 teaspoon like the recipe calls for, and additionally peeling a little more than a dozen flakes with the peeler to use as decoration at the end. Instead of using liqueur, I used juice from the orange, reserving what's left for the decoration at the end as well.  2. Add at least an extra tablespoon of orange juice to the filling, maybe even 1 1/2 like I did. It makes them more orangey.  3. I added a little under 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the filling. It helps with the bitter flavor and makes it sweet.  4. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil for the chocolate coating, this works well.  5. After I dipped all the filling in chocolate, I re-heated the remaining chocolate and added 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and 2-3 tblspns of orange juice (I should have used the leftover juice, but I accidentally threw it out.) I dipped my fork in to the mixture once it was mixed smooth, and drizzled it over the top of the truffles. In the drizzle, on top of each one, I placed an orange zest flake set aside form the beginning.  They turned out magnificently.

WHAT A MESS!!!  In my opinion there is way too much liquid in this recipe.  I planned to make these for my husband for Valentine's Day.  I followed the recommendations submitted by other reviewers and chilled well/froze etc.  I understand that weather conditions etc. can play a big part in the success or failure of a recipe but I could tell from the very beginning that this was not going to work because there was too much liquid.  I had planned on a "love basket" and these were going to be the center piece... in a lovely container.  I actually made 2 batches, neither of which came out.  (You definately want to double this recipe unless you want VERY tiny little truffles).  I was desperate..... at this point my husband would be home in 1 hour and I was NOT going to the mall to pay way too much for the name brand chocolate.  I managed to find some more chocolate and started over.  I doubled the recipe.  I cut the butter and the cream in half.  I kept the liquor the same.  I followed the directions as usual up to this point where you "try to shape them into balls."  After all the ingredients were mixed I got out my large tub of powdered sugar and just started adding it.  I added and added and added until I came up with something that I could work with.  I shaped them into balls and then froze them for approx. 10 minutes.  I then dipped then in the chocolate.  

The recipe needs a lot of work but the taste if WONDERFUL.  My husband is somewhat particular and said immediately th

Loved this recipe, is really very tasty. I had problem with butter separation also, but not alot and I just scraped it off. I rolled mine in crushed pecans after the chocolate layer. I would reccomend letting the truffle sit in nuts awhile after rolling, alot of mine ended up with finger indents in because I tried to move them out of the nuts so quickly. I used a little ice cream scoop to make the filling balls, but should have shaped them after as some are little funny looking and not overly round. 
Tasty! and easy for a first time truffle maker.
Will try again with Baileys, Frangelico.

I didn't know what to expect, but I am very impressed. Anytime you work with chocolate, it can be messy, but I don't mind! I actually had a brand new bottle of orange extract and I decided to use that in place of liqueur and it worked perfectly. I dipped mine into tempered milk chocolate so I could take these to a dinner party. I love using tempered milk chocolate!

While I loved this recipe, they were very messy when left out. I had to keep them refrigerated at all times or they would be too messy to eat. I had them at my Christmas party and had to keep putting them in the fridge then back out again. 

Over the years I have used this as a based recipe for other flavors. I make the orange with orange juice. If I make raspberry I used Chambord and if I want mint I'll use peppermint extract but cut the amount in half.  Everyone is impressed by these. But as said, they do need to be kept refrigerated.

This recipe was very disappointing.  I followed the recipe exactly, and was not happy at all with the flavor of the filling; I didn't even bother going further by chilling.  Like other reviewers stated, the measurements of the ingredients are way off (i,e, how can 4 oz. of chocolate plus the other ingredients yield 24 truffles?)  On the contrary, I had a pot of chili simmering and added 2 tbl. of the chocolate filling to it, and it gave it an element of depth to the flavor.  All was not lost!

Took what seemed like forever for this to set and had a very runny consistancy even when set.  I used small scoop, tried using my hands, they just melted almost immeditately and I couldn't dip or roll them.  The upside was we melted the mixture back down and added a few cups of powdered sugar and poured into a 13x9 for FABULOUS FUDGE, was really good as a fudge.  Gave as gifts for Christmas!

Make sure you give yourself plenty of time! These were good but not as good as store bought and the ingredients cost more to buy than the store bought kind. Next time for the mess and the time it takes to make these, I think I'll go buy a box.

Well it isn't often I find a recipe I would never make again...but this one falls into that category. I found this quite tasteless. Yes the butter and the chocolate separated but stir as it cools and it will come together. I had to add orange extract to this to get flavor the liqueur didn't do it. It seemed something stopped this from firming ...perhaps the liqueur??? I didn't want to waste the ingredients so I added a pack of cream cheese and spooned the mixture in the center of muffin batter and they were fabulous. Sorry can't even give 1 star on taste alone, except this system forces you to give one. There are so many really delicious truffle recipes available, after all FLAVOR is vital.

Very tasty truffles!  A problem I had was gettimg the right consistency after chilling. They were a bit too runny when I tried to ball them, but after sittimng out covered on my counter for ~12 hours, they must have dried out a little and then were at the correct doughy texture.

Great and creamy, they melt in your mouth.  I used orange and raspberry flavoring (it is cheaper than liquor and as a student I am on a limited budget) and Kahula in another batch and they all turned out great!  I used milk chocolate in onw batch and dark chocolate in two others.  When I used the dark chocolate both times the butter seperated, so use milk chocolate (you really don't need dark anyway because these are strong).  Very easy to make (I thought truffles were hard to make) and total crowd pleasers.  During Christmas I am going to make them with peppermint schnapps-cannot wait!

I tried making these for Valentines day, and it was a huge hit! The only difference I made from this recipe was that I used Orange Juice instead of the liqueur. I even ran out of these (after making a double batch) midway through the day! If you make these, plan for an attack of the chocolate lovers! :)

these are so simple to make with few ingredients but taste so absolutely decadent!  so creamy and smooth, they melt in your mouth.  I made the first batch with special dark chocolate chips but found after I got it together that it was not sweet enough.  Since it makes a small batch and I am making these for holiday trays, I decided to make a second batch using semi-sweet and just mix the two batches.  This worked out well, a little sweeter but still with a good dark chocolate flavor to compliment the orange.  I used 1 tsp. pure orange extract per batch in place of liquor and it gave it a very nice orange flavor. Had no problems with separation, and stayed firm to roll and dip.  Just make sure your dipping chocolate is not too hot, it will melt the delicate truffle mixture.  thanks for this great recipe that is so versatile and tastes so gourmet!

I made these for my chocoholic friend. I had never made truffles before. I had one taste and almost fell to the floor! My friend said these were better than any chocolates she's ever had--that's including Godiva!!

I made these today and the flavor is incredible! I made half a batch and got nine narely 1/2-inch size truffles. I must have hot hands because they were melting like crazy. I used Grand Marnier. I rolled them in cocoa powder instead of coating with chocolate. I'm not sure a full batch would get 24 truffles.

With amendment this recipe is quite good, but the quantities in this recipe are way off.  I read all the reviews and proceeded with caution and with extra chocolate on hand.  I ended up adding double the amount of chocolate the recipe calls for.  By the time I was done adding little bits of chocolate after each time I let the mix cool, I was fed up, so I just rolled the truffles in cocoa, as is more traditional anyway.  The end result is a really nice truffle, but beware of the quantities given.

I am now the truffle queen thanks to this recipe!  These are awesome.  I substituted raspberry liquor for the orange flavoring and they were so good. I will definitely make them again.

These have great flavor, but a little hard for me to make.  The truffle mixture never really hardened, so it was a little difficult for me to make the balls.  They didn't look great, but we really enjoyed the flavor.  My kitchen was probably too warm, but I will try again!!

Yum! These are delish. I'm not sure what the problem some reviewers are having but after chilling in the fridge I had no problems scooping with a small cookie dough scoop, rolling smooth, and then freezing. I didn't have the liqueur so I used some fresh squeezed OJ along with the fresh zest. They are a bit messy but soo good. My only problem is the batch was really small =(( next time I will be sure and double so we have plenty of these little delights!

Yummy! Simply awesome! I also made some Raspberry truffles, where I subbed the orange liquer for raspberry, and subbed the zest for instant coffee granuals. I think those tasted even better than the orange truffles. I'm bias though 'cause I love raspberries! (I was even told by non-raspberry lovers that they were awesome, and even better than the orange.) Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a great simple recipe.  Tip: After I spoon out the granach, I refrigerate it until it is set up and then roll is with powdered sugar in my hands.  Keeps sticky chocolate mess to a minimum and doesn't affect the great granach texture.

These are fantastic! I made a ton to give to neighbors at Christmas and they are just awesome. I used different imitation flavors to make a bunch of different kinds. I melted white chocolate and added color to put on the top so we could tell which ones were which. Be prepared to get a little chocolatey when you make these though. I found the best thing to do is use the melon baller to scoop up the filling and then form it into better looking balls by hand. These are excellent

Truffles taste great.  When I chilled the filling, some of the butter rose to the top and hardened, was hard to mix back in before forming the balls.

Fantastic little Christmas presents!  Easy enough for beginners- just don't expect them to look too pretty. I stuck mine in mini muffin papers to compensate!

After making 3-4 dozens- my findings:
1. The serving size is way off! I could only get 12 out of the original

2. The "cores" need
A. Extra 2 oz of chocolate- helps compensate for  the loss of "transferring" bowl to wax paper

B. 3 tablespoons of liquor- helps the flavor come through the chocolate

C. 1 teaspoon of sugar to take the bitterness out of the chocolate and accentuate the flavor of the liquor.

3. Don't keep transferring- let the pot you boil the cream, chocolate+ butter go straight into the fridge after it cools down

4. Use your hands to shape like you would a cookie dough ball (yes it will get messy but will shape well)

LOVED IT!  I used triple sec and skipped over the orange zest in the second batch (for a smoother texture)..... Also: rinse your hands in ice cold water when shaping them, and set on a fresh waxed paper tray (it absorbs any extra water from your hands..... I rolled them in Hershey's Special Dark baking cocoa powder and they were a huge hit!  melt in your mouth smoother and creamier than lindt lindor truffles! I also used Callebaut MILK Chocolate (sold by the pound at whole foods) Put them in a candy box and mini paper cups (from a craft store) and nobody wil believ you made them yourself!
Good Luck and ENJOY!!!

AMAZING! If you're a chocoholic like I am, you will not be disapointed. Sadly I only managed to eat 2 from my first batch because my family snarfled them all up! I made 3 batches in one week: one for a party, one for dessert with my parents, and one just for me! every time they are made, it's a big hit. thank you very much for this delicious truffle recipe!

I am new at candy making, but found this pretty easy (yes, it's messy, but any time you work with melted chocolate, it's bound to be!)  Chilling well between steps definitely helps.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and got DELICIOUS results.  Brought these to a Holiday Cookie Exchange and got raves! (Quadrupled recipe) Topping with extra grated orange peel added an elegant touch!

This is great! Instead of rolling the I truffle and dipping it in chocolate, I put some chocolate in a candy mold and placed the truffle in. I also used Peppermint and Vanilla extract instead of Orange. They were delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe, the truffles melt in your mouth. I made these for my Sister's birthday with Chambord and orange liqueur and they were fantastic, she absolutely loved them. Next time im going to take another reviewer's suggestion and try Kahlua or maybe some Bailey's. yum!!

So I'm only 18 so I couldn't buy the orange liquer so I ended up using orange (and raspberry, I made two kinds) extract and they were terrible. It was so strong, it was like drinking whiskey, that super strong flavor.

DO NOT replace liquer with extract!!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly including timings the mixture did get a bit soft as I was rolling into balls think my hands were too warm. So I popped remaining mixture back in the fridge for 15 minutes and then started rolling again. I got twenty out of this using a melon baller. I'm going to make a double batch tomorrow for gifts. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my firt time making truffles and they were simply scrumptious. I doubled the recipes and came out wiht a good 40 balls. I removed 1 ounce of chocolate and added 2 tablespoons choclate syrup with 1/2 instant coffee powder. It is great with a blended coffee drink. Will definately make this again.

Made more like 16 truffles.  Very hard to shape.

Delicious though, and very rich - and adaptable with other liqueurs.  Will try with amaretto or hazelnut liqueur next.

This recipe was really great. I also made some with Chambord (black raspberry liqueur) and they were wonderful. The only problem I had was shaping them into round balls. some of them looked a little strange, but still tasted wonderful. Great recipe!!!

The texture of these is very nice.  However, the recipe makes only 9 "Lindt" sized balls.  Definitely double the recipe. I found the orange flavor with just the liqueur wasn't strong enough.  I added a half teaspoon of pure orange extract and that did the trick.  I will try these again.

Very tasty and smooth as I left out the zest.   Anyone have answer to why the butter rose to the top? I stirred well prior to chilling.   I scraped off the butter and continued with the procedure.

Protip:  Use semisweet chocolate chips.  Don't have a kitchen scale?  1 oz is 50 chocolate chips. 

 I made about 12 balls with this recipe and barely had enough chocolate to dip them in.  If you're making smaller balls than me, double the dipping chocolate.

If you don't want to use a double boiler, melt the dipping chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 10 seconds.

I made a second batch and dipped them in cocoa powder It was delicious, easier to do (not drippy like melted chocolate) and easier to form pretty balls.

These truffles were really good! I used primarily fresh squeezed orange juice for the orange flavor and then added a little spiced rum. Great combo!

For my first time making truffles this was a great recipe and very easy. I used the orange liquer and didn't have a problem putting in the freezer to firm up-which is necessary-also doesn't make the chocolate shell crack. "Flicked" melted white almond bark on top for decoration and to show the kids that Mommy can play with her food too! The filling flavor is great-didn't change a thing.

These were AMAZING!  So good.  I made them for my boyfriend & his favorite flavors are orange and key lime so I made half of each.  I took a reviewer's suggestion of making the filling mixture the night before and keeping in the fridge overnight.  It was REALLY stiff by then, but I was still able to get it into balls.  I would definitely double or triple the recipe if making for more than one person because mine only came out to 24 VERY small truffles.  Taste is delicious though!

Tasted great! Freeze the centre so you can roll the balls.

I was really disappointed with this. Maybe I chose the wrong chocolate or something, but I had to throw them out, no one would eat them because they were so bitter!

I've made hundreds of truffles in years past; I don't know what magic the other cooks here had, but following to a T..., the chocolate in no way shape or form was moldable without making a complete mess all over my hands, wasting and melting chocolate!!!!!!

Tastes great, but I had to cut it into chunks before the chocolate dip step & covered with chopped peanuts to give them a more "professional" look due to their lack of general "shape."

The flavor of these are excellent! So far, I've made 4 batches, with varying types of chocolate and I've come to the same conclusion as others-- don't use super-dark chocolate. It'll separate from the butter. I also had a few problems in my later batches with the truffles turning out dry, but I'm pretty sure it's my own error that I'll work out in my next batches.

Easy to make and the flavor is delicious, if you keep them cold.  I found that room temperature they aren't that great, however if you keep them in the refrigerator until you eat them the flavor is much better.  Keeping them in the freezer is the best!  I rated them a four instead of a five because I found the texture to be a bit off; you can't tell as much when they are cold, but as they reach room temperature the mouth feel isn't as good.

depite spilling the heavy cream on the stovetop and starting a small fire, despite accidentally doubling half the recipe and having to run to the store to restock, and despite my inability to shape them, these truffles turned out nearly perfect. I need to brush up a little before next time, but there will definately be many "next time"s.

substituting dark chocolate might not be the greatest idea, but if you're a true dark fan, give it a try. I think I used the wrong kind of orange liqueur and it might have clashed with the dark chocolate. like I said, "need to brush up".

MAKE THESE FOR THE CHOCOLATE-LOVER IN YOUR LIFE!! (even if it's just you)

Instead of semi-sweet chocolate, I used bittersweet, which is definitely my preference with orange flavor!  I used Triple-Sec for the liqueur and they came out great.  The did get very, very soft after being out for a while, but that's ok.  No use taking a bite, you just have to pop the whole thing!  I used a small cookie scoop to make slightly bigger truffles than the recipe called for, but I still got 16 truffles.  They were a hit.

These cookies are better than store bought or specialty shop bought. In fact, a friend who compares chocolate chip cookies to the meaning of life (or is it that reversed?) said these are the best she's had.

These chocolates are delicious and so easy to make! They've been a big hit with everyone. I took the advice of others and let my filling sit over night. It was actually so stiff the next day that I added more liqueur.

I did triple the recipe, and ended up with 50+ chocolates. I used one bag of chocolate chips for the filling and one for the coating. I think next time I make these I invest in a higher quality chocolate.
