We frequently go to PF Chang's just for the chicken lettuce wraps so I was gratified to hear my family say that this recipe (with these modifications) tastes BETTER than PF Chang's. Here's what I did: Mix 3/4 cup shredded mushrooms and 1 can drained chopped water chestnuts with the chicken before cooking. Cook them all together. Omit the cherries. Double the sauce ingredients (but omit the honey) and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste) to the sauce. Use the freshest, crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor.

This was WONDERFUL! My husband loved the ones at P.F. Changs so I found this recipe and made it with the changes recomended by Sherrybeat: Mix 3/4 cup shredded mushrooms and 1 can drained chopped water chestnuts with the chicken before cooking. Cook them all together. Omit the cherries. Double the sauce ingredients (but omit the honey) and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste) to the sauce. Use the freshest, crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor... 
Others recomended bib lettuce, but my husband prefered the crunch of the iceberg lettuce (I agree) so I'll go back to that next time. It didn't take that long to make (with a food processor) and was soooo good! Next time I'll try making the ginger lemonade with it.

This dish was wonderful!  I followed Kerry K's suggestions, with one exception, I added "cherry flavored" Craisins, instead of real cherries.  I thought to myself, "why omit the cherries, when this dish is called CHERRY CHICKEN WRAPS?".  The Cherry Craisins were so easy and quick to use, verses real cherries, and the frustration that goes with "pitting" them.  The result was yummy, and the presentation was awesome!  My husband and oldest daughter LOVED them, and want me to make them again.  Great summer dish, or anytime dish!
Thanks a lot for sharing this one! This will be a family favorite.

This is nice but SOOO much better a day or two later - perfect picnic food.  With more chopping than cooking, it's a good pick for a novice cook. 

Use soft flexible lettuce (butter lettuce is great) that won't tear as much - and whatever you do, stay away from iceberg.

I know I've already reviewed this recipe but I just had this again last night (had to wait a whole YEAR for cherries!) and it's still fabulous! In reading the other reviews I had to laugh - some have omitted the cherries! Why bother making chicken CHERRY lettuce wraps if you omit the cherries? Sorry - I really like cherries and this is the best meal I've had in a long time! Healthy, lots of flavor, simple, although somewhat time consuming with the pitting of the cherries. 
One note about the lettuce - make sure you buy a hearty lettuce. The red leaf was way too thin and flimsy to hold the bundle. I ended up just making a salad of it - which was fine too. I'd pick Romaine or Butter lettuce - something with a stiffer leaf. 
Thanks Barry for an awesome recipe!

We loved these! The reviewers who omitted the cherries missed out...they added great flavor, texture & juicyness to the mix. I cut the recipe in half, used frozen/thawed rotissirie chicken (sauteed it in the oil & ginger for a couple of minutes to infuse it w/ flavor), I used ginger-in-a-tube (I added extra) & I used finely minced red onion instead of the green onions. I decreased the carrots some & I used red leaf lettuce. Bibb lettuce might make it more convenient to eat but we both liked the slight crunch from the leaf lettuce. Even though I cut the recipe in half & decreased the carrots, I made the full recipe of sauce...I'm glad because I think it would have been too dry & not nearly as flavorful w/out it. I also made this up a couple of hours ahaed & kept it in the fridge...I think it needs time for the flavors to meld. I didn't take  a pic, thinking that there would be leftovers & I could do it the next day in natural light but we ate it all! LOL With a glass of white zin, this was perfect for a hot summer night...thanks Barry!

I'm not sure what I did wrong here but it just didn't come out that great or even.  It also took me FOREVER to make.  prep time of 15 minutes is pretty funny.  i guess you could buy everything pre-chopped, halved, minced, etc.  but buy then, wouldn't it just be cheaper to go to pf chang's?

This is wonderful!  I have used craisins or dried cherries (since fresh cherries aren't available too often where I live) and sunflower kernels instead of the almonds.  I also topped the wrap with shredded cabbage/carrot cole slaw mix.  This has become regular meal in our home.  Thanks!!

Refreshing and fun. Per others' suggestions, I added mushrooms and craisins.  I cooked it all in the crockpot (minus the green onion, carrots and craisins) to save cooking time.  Very delicious!

My family LOVED my version of this recipe. Basically the same thing just omit the cherries. Yes, I'm one of those. Sorry. We are not cherry fans. We go to a local place here called Pei Wei for lettuce wraps. These are so much better!! My family requested these for our New Years Day dinner. Oh - I was out of almonds so we use sunflower seeds (it's what I had)....and ....oh, water chestnuts added a nice a crunch. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's now one of our favorites.

This was excellent. I omitted the cherries and added chopped water chestnuts. It was just as good for left overs the next day. Watch out PF Changs!

The method is good. The sweet flavor is good. Needs some spice to balance the sweet....like some cayenne, or use chili oil.

Tastes fantastic.. Just wrap with more than one lettuce leaf because they tend to split when you bite into them.

Just made this and it tastes great. I did use fresh cherries, but not a whole pound, just a handful i had left in a bag. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again, but following some of the mods in other reviews. especially the water chestnuts.

Very yummy recipe. My hubby & I both loved it. Made it as a side to Vegetable Lo Mein.  Wished we had more lettuce in the house: we ran out 3/4 of the way through the chicken mix! The only thing I changed was what the other reviewer's suggested: no cherries & no honey. I also added an easy sauce that we dizzled on top: 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 tsps. fresh grated ginger, & 1 tbsp. rice vinegar. Delish!

I eat at Dave and Busters frequently, and I finally came across a recipe similar to their lettuce wraps. I had made this for my brother when he was in town. The lettuce wraps were wonderful. I had grated my carrots in the food processor, and I  had omited  the ginger, and the cherries. I also doubled the teriyaki sauce, so that the chicken was not dry. This is now a family favorite...

I love this recipe!  I make it almost exactly how it appears (yes, cherries and all!).  I like to make extra sauce, and mix all the ingredients together (after cooking ginger + chicken) and let it simmer with the sauce.  This is a huge hit at my house!  This is also a great recipe to use left over veggies.

I made this without the cherries, but not by choice.  They were astronomically expensive (a fun surprise at the checkout counter) so I opted out until they go on sale :)  I doubled the sauce, based on some other reviews, and it was quite tasty!  I had to use cashews instead of peanuts, because that's all I had, and peanut oil instead of canola.  Great dish that I WILL make again, probably when the price of cherries drops a bit.  Fairly quick and healthy dinner choice.  Paired it with some sesame broccoli and it was a hit.  Thanks!

I enjoyed these, but none of the other 3 people I made them for seemed to dig them (and ate very little of them).  I followed the recipe, though I did use already grilled/shredded meat and used dried cherries when I couldn't find fresh.  I'm looking forward to taking the leftovers for lunch.  THANKS for a unique recipe, barry!

I made a serving of four of this. Wow! Really delish! I almost skipped the cherries since I didn't have any on hand. It was worth the trip to the market. DON'T leave these out! I will make this again and again!

This recipe is extremely delicious! I made it WITH the cherries, and I have to say they REALLY make the dish. I let some of my friends try it, and they fell in love with it. I even got my friend who doesn't like cherries at all to eat it! I took another reviewers suggestion and added water chestnuts and mushrooms, and I added just a teensy bit more honey (about a tsp more) because I like it. But otherwise I left the recipe as it was. I will definitely be making this again; it's great for a busy college student!

I loved this, a perfect summer dish. The cherries add a juicy sweet texture and blended with the crunch of the almonds and the tenderness of the chicken plus the freshness of the lettuce, this is a must have in everyones recipe box. I put the sauce on the side for dipping and added jasmine rice in with the mix and it was divine! I forgot the green onions while shopping so I omitted it but still delicious! I also doubled the sauce because that seemed to go fast, healthy and delicious A+

These were decent, but are in need of major help IMHO (maybe more sauce???). With a few tweaks here and there, I do believe these could be MUCH better tho. I really like the concept, so I'm not throwing in the towel just yet. :) These are perfect for a hot summer meal - they're light, healthy and make use of the season's freshest produce. On that note, DO NOT skip the cherries. After all, the title of this recipe is "cherry" chicken lettuce wraps (duh...)! These are pretty dry as is. Fresh cherries add juciness. Without them, I can't imagine how dry my chicken mixture would have been. I pretty much followed Barry's directions to the letter except for a few (minor) changes. The idea of having large cherry chunks in my wraps didn't appeal to me, so I cut each half into quarters. I also chopped my chicken into tiny pieces after cooking it (again, personal preference). And, in an effort to speed prep (pitting cherries is VERY time consuming!), I purchased a package of matchstick carrots. These retained their crispy texture much better than shredded carrots would have. NOTE: Be sure to use a sturdy lettuce for your wraps. Romaine won't cut it. Try Boston or California Bibb (I used Boston Bibb lettuce). Served wtih a side of coconut ginger rice (Thai Town brand) and iced ginseng tea, this was an allright meal. My hubby didn't approve, but he isn't a fan of lettuce wraps (or fruit) anyways. Thanks for sharing, barry! :-)

Loved the ginger in this recipe.  The only reason I can think of to omit the cherries is if they are out of season.  There really do make the recipe delicious.

These are really good! I've fixed this dish a couple of times now and it's great and keeps well too for a brown bag lunch. If there is a secret to eating them though I sure would like to know as the lettuce is a bit fragile and after a bite you end up with pieces falling out all over and they are not easy to eat neatly. This dish was a little tart and a little tangy and just a hint of sweet from the cherries. I liked the crunch the almonds gave this too. I'm glad I used the cherries even though my son didn't care for them as they really went well and the flavor was great with the ginger and chicken. I used ginger paste. We sort of miss the bread though and had the urge to wrap this in a flatbread lettuce and all... Thanks, I had great fun trying something new and different from our normal.

These were a hit with the family and the other teenage boys our son had staying over.  I followed most of sherrybeat's recommendations. I also added a half chopped red onion into chicken/mushroom/water chestnut mix.  Doubled sauce (splitting half honey and half soy sauce) garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste).  Instead of chicken breasts, I used a rotissere chicken, shredded and chopped. This cut the prep time to almost nothing.

Very good recipe and WOW, healthy too.  I made the recipe as written - even the cherries since I had them on hand. The only thing that was confusing is the lettuce.  I went to the store and looked at Bibb lettuce as others had mentioned that variety and ended up getting Boston Green b/c it seemed like it would roll up easier.  Well, that didn't work well and the lettuce "tortilla" fell apart.  So now I see the benefit of getting lettuce that is shaped like a "cup".  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful!! PF Changs, look out! I omitted the cherries, increased the ginger to 1 1/2 tablespoons, and cut the oil in half. As others suggested, bibb lettuce is the way to go - but I would say double up - use two leaves per lettuce wrap so they don't fall apart. Thanks for the recipe!

My wife & I made this for a picnic at the Zoo.  We also had Ginger Lemonade and a nice bread.  I am still getting compliments for chosing this menu!
This is easy to prepare and fun to eat!
Look through some of the other reviews for variations on the recipe.
We'll have this again...soon!

These were very healthy and delicious.  Butter lettuce would have worked better.  I added extra garlic and cayenne pepper for more kick!  Leftovers kept well in refrigerator.

I took the advice of SHERRYBEAT because I am a great fan of P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps, and made the recipe as she outlined.  I was amazed at how incredible the results were.  My husband, also a fan, could barely contain himself!!!  This recipe will forever be a favorite!!!

These were OK, but I guess I'm too used to the PF Changs lettuce wraps.  I found them a little bland, even after adding some crushed red pepper.  Also took a long time to prepare, with all the chopping, etc...

delicious! - is as close as i can find to pf chang's lettuce wraps. i did leave out the cherries (personal preference). recommend using bibb lettuce, as it will roll up more easily. also, drain chicken mixture prior to placing in lettuce leaf, to avoid excessive dripping. wonderful!

I doubled the sauce and omitted the honey. I served it over mixed greens and added sliced avocado and french fried onions for crunch. It was excellent! Also, the chicken mixture gets better a day or two later!

This doesn't taste like PF Chang's chicken lettuce wraps, but it is good. I also added water chestnuts, used cherry flavored craisins instead of sweet cherries, and added a teaspoon of sugar to the recipe.

These were nice and fresh, but they were missing something. I made them according to the recipe, but then after tasting them added the juice of 1/2 a lime. That really tied all the flavors together. Also, the sauce didn't really stay on the chicken. Next time we will probably let the chicken sit in the sauce longer - maybe for an hour - before serving. But I love the cherries!

I was excited to try this, and I made it exactly according to the recipe but was very disappointed.  This did not taste anything like the lettuce wraps I have had in restaurants.  It was very bland.  My family ate very little.

These are AWESOME! I bought a rotisserie chicken and just used that instead of cooking chicken breasts. I also substituted cherry craisans instead of real cherries. I left out the ginger root and carrots as well and added some extra soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. I will be making these again!

Fantastic! - and so easy! I didn't have any cherries, so I threw in a handful of dried cranberries. The tart sweetness really adds something to the wraps. Make sure to drain the excess juice out of the chicken mixture before serving, or you'll have a drippy mess on your hands.

This was the best recipe for chicken luttuce wraps! I made this recipre two times, and both times it was a success!I was told by my mom that the second time was my best!First time I used mushrooms, and a jar of asian veggies , celery,had no water chestnuts, so added cheshews for a big cruch, and big ginger chucks. The second time I omitted the mushrooms , cut up the ginger smaller,(I thought the frist time the ginger was too strong) and added celery again. I did less of the veggie ingredience,had no chashews but this time had water chestnuts. I guess in this case, less is more.

I loved this, but made quite a few changes. I sauteed finely diced ginger, mushrooms, carrots, and green jalapeno in a bit of oil. I then seasoned finely diced chicken with salt, pepper, ground ginger, cayenne, and garlic powder. I removed the vegis, added a bit of oil & cooked the chicken. I threw the vegis back in and mixed in the sauce. My sauce mixture was 3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce, 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, a few dashes of chili oil, a few dashes of tabasco, and a pinch of sugar. Off the heat after everything was blended together I mixed in the green onions, a handful of chopped cilantro, and a handful of dried sweetened cranberries because that's all I had. I'm sure this recipe is perfect as is, but is was absolutely delicious the way I prepared it.

I love this recipe. It's simple and delicious. The lettuce I got (red leaf lettuce) wasn't long enough to wrap,  so I ended up putting the chicken on top of the lettuce without wrapping. I pitted the cherries with a pastry bag tip which made preparation so much easier.

I love sweet and salty combinations so this was perfect, especially on a sunny Spring day. I had carrots and waterchesnuts from a frozen stir fry mix in my freezer and added that, which worked out fine and the water chesnuts gave it a nice crunch. Also used dried cranberries, which I will be now adding more frequently to dishes now that I know how good this tasted.

Loved it!  Didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I added water chesnuts, used dried cherrys, and 1/4 cup Soy Vey Teriyaki which gave it great flavor, it would have been just fine without the fresh ginger and rice vinegar.

I didn't have cherries so I used craisins.

I can't wait to make them again.

I really didn't care for the smell of this meal at all, but the taste was pretty good.  I would prefer next time to use water chestnuts or something else over cherries however.  The only changes I made was leaving out  the onions (do not care them) and using a Honey Sake Teriyaki sauce rather than honey and teriyaki separately.  I also I added some corn starch powder for extra thickness.  I liked the dressing a lot and will be making some extra just to have on hand for salads.  I would infact, prefer this as a salad.  I used red lettuce, which did not hold up as a wrap.  But making a little less for the top of a salad would be great!!  I also threw in some baby corn (nuggets not spears) since I had some extra sauce.

Fairly time consuming recipe; lots of chopping of ingredients just takes time.  I used plums and walnuts instead of cherries and almonds.  

My wife absolutely loved the results -- left me a little underwhelmed.  Rating is based on her taste, not mine.

I think this is an awesome dish. Try using dried cherries since they are available year-round. Also, try putting the mix in pita bread instead of lettuce. The lettuce just falls apart and is very messy. This dish is delicious when served with white rice.

I tried this recipe, but wasn't really "wowed" by it. The whole lettuce wrap was bland tasting, perhaps it would taste better on a tortilla or some sort of bread. At any rate, I won't be making this again without doctoring it up first.

Updated once I can honestly review the recipe WITH cherries once they were in season: We didn't care for it!  Wierd. We liked them better the way I made them originally without the cherries. The dressing still ROCKS though!  Original review: Followed this recipe with the exception of not using any cherries since they aren't in season here yet. Once the dish was done it was actually quite bland, so added some sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds and some Asian garlic chili paste. It ended up tasting great. Will try this again with my changes + adding cherries once I can get them in a few weeks. So while the recipe wan't perfect for us as it is, I want to add that we enjoy the "dressing" part of this recipe - 1T oil, rice vinegar, teriyaki sauce, toasted almonds, honey, green onion. We eat it on coleslaw and salad. I keep a batch of it in the fridge all the time now!

I followed this recipe to the letter and to my surprise, it was pretty good. Normally I don't like fruit with meat, but you couldn't tell there were cherries in the mixture. My daughter and I ate our wrapped in tortillas and thought it tasted OK, my husband had the lettuce and thought it was pretty good. It tasted really good on crackers with a little Parmesan cheese.

Tried this recipe on my family who have never had lettuce wraps and they loved them.  I will definetly make again but to be honest, they were not as good as PF Changs.  It smelt wonderful while cooking but the flavor was too mild for me. Needs something extra. Overall still good!!!

My veggie hating husband raved about these.  I made all of the changes suggested by the other reviews.  I think that next time, a little less teriyaki and add the honey.  All in all a good recipe that added variety to our regular menu

Very good but changed the ingredients as suggested per sherrybeat's review.  Does taste like P.F. Changs, just not as dark.  Like the fact that all ingredients are healthy and fresh.

Love this recipe!!  I did what SHERRYBEAT did though and cut out the Cherries and I used butter lettuce leaves.  Definitely have to double up on the sauce.  Absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I followed the other reviewer’s suggestions and omitted the cherries and honey and I also added some extra veggies too (1 c mushrooms, 1/2 c celery, and garlic). I also used butter lettuce because I find it easier to handle than iceberg.  Very delicious, even my extra picky husband loved them and asked me to make them again.  Thank you!

This was amazing, totally worth the effort, I followed it to a T. My fridge was nearly empty and I used the ingredient search tool and this popped up- I was hesitant at first but what an amazing explosion of flavors. This will easily be added into my dinner rotation meal plan :)

Interesting flavors, and I loved the crunch of the carrot and almonds.  The sauce was really liquid-y, so I added a little bit of cornstarch to try and thicken it up.  I may not make again as lettuce wraps (kind of messy), but I think the combo could taste good as a salad.

SO DELICIOUS!! Even my pickiest eater came back for seconds! Easy to make and we love it! I have  found substituting dried cherries for the fresh very easy when they are not in season and no pitting is required! Also found an actual lettuce wrap lettuce in the pre-packaged section of the produce dept. which was a romaine/iceburg that  worked great and tasted wonderful!

Great recipe!  Husband gave raves!  Had to use the little packaged pickled ginger (had no fresh), used sesame oil and made the house smell great (instead of canola), and used hoisin sauce instead of teriyaki- maybe I will have all the right ingredients next time, but came out awesome!

Definitely use all the cherries called for. I cut back on the amount and regretted it. Dark sweet cherries aren't as sweet tasting as the typical red cherries we are probably thinking of. Use Boston lettuce leaves as anything else just rips and gets messy.

Loved this recipe, but had trouble keeping my lettuce from ripping and leaking.   Took a peeler to make carrot strips that I wrapped around the filled lettuce and held with a tooth pick.   This made great appetizers.

Very good!  I would definitely omit the honey. Don't need it bc of teriyaki sauce. Also. IMO it needs soy but we didn't have any )-:  used ground chicken and liked that a lot.  I will make this again with water chestnuts (didn't have any) - that's what happens when u let the husband do the shopping....

I have just made this, following the recipe exactly, except I doubled the sauce and I added 1 tablespoon of garlic to the Chicken when cooking (can't cook anything without garlic!). It was great! will definately do again. i live in Barbados so its sometimes difficult to get good lettuce, but used iceberg and worked well. Thanks!

I couldn't believe how delicious this was.  I kept double checking the recipe, I couldn't believe ginger was the only real spice added.  I had already torn up all my romaine so I just served the chicken on a bed of lettuce.  And I didn't have any fresh ginger so I used 1 tsp ground.  It turned out great, and my salad-hating fiance even loved it!

Excellent recipe! Big hit with everyone in my family. Thanks for sharing!

I used cherry craisins instead of cherries and added mushrooms to the chicken at the end of cooking. The flavor was incredible.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Just to add a little more, I squirted some lemon juice into the mixture and, instead of cherries, i used Craisins Original. We had it the next day as a mid-hike lunch on bread and it was just as good!

I loved it and made it just as the recipe shows, the cherries did take a while to pit and for me it was worth it but for the family, since they could take it or leave it I may try the dried cherries next time like many reviewers have suggested or just leave them out all together, it would be a fast easy meal without them.

These are really good, did use dried cherries. Used romaine, will probably make again sometime with different lettuce.

One of my family's favorite recipes! We have this at least once or twice a month - sometimes more! The kids love helping on this one - the 2 year old loves to pull the stems off the cherries while the 8 yr old shreds the carrots :)  We use Romaine lettuce since it creates more of a sturdy scoop to hold the mix without fear of it falling to pieces.  I also use Agave Nectar instead of honey, love the taste of Agave Nectar! I also have some people that don't eat chicken, so I made the mix, and before adding the chicken I put some aside and served that with shredded Salmon.  (Doing this though you'll have to make more of the cherry mixture.)  I didn't mix it with the fish before serving, that would make the fish soggy. Even our little 8 year old veggitarian who hates eating dinner LOVED this dish with the salmon.

This was one of the best recipes I have ever tried from this website! I followed other people's suggestions and left out the cherries. I also sauteed the chicken with a little soy sauce and terriyaki sauce before mixing everything together. Amazing! Thank you for this recipe!

WOW! These caught me completely off guard! I trying to use up lettuce, carrots and some chicken and thought it would be fun to try to make something similar to the P.F. Chang's Lettuce Wraps...and well..these are dang close!  I did only give 4 stars because I followed the advice of a previous poster and omitted/increased a few things.    I did not have cherries nor would I have made it with them.  I did double the vinegar and teriyaki sauce added about 1/2 tsp of Garlic Powder, chili flakes (suggested by previous poster) 1 tsp of veggie oil (I did not have canola) 4 chicken breasts boiled and cut into chuncks...considered shredding. Served in crispy lettuce cups.  Again...D'lish!!!  I was so surprised by the flavor and know that even with a few ingredients missing (green onions) it was still very tasty and not bland at all.

Great recipe!  I followed the modifications from SHERRYBEAT, and they turned out wonderful.  The only other change I made was to use ground chicken.  It's easy, and really did taste like PF Chang's!

I've made theis recipe twice and the whole family enjoyed it both times.  Even my 2 young (picky)children will eat the filling. It's good topped with crunchy noodles for a little extra something.  I do have to be in the mood as it takes quite a bit of prep work/time but is worth it.  The second time I made it, I pitted and split the cherries earlier in the day and just stuck them in the fridge until ready to use.

These are great.  I didn't add the cherries simply b/c I didn't have them on hand.  I will add them next time though.  I also made a dipping sauce out of soy sauce, water, lemon juice, garlic & ginger.  Hubby and I both liked them better dipping them in the sauce but they were still good without!  4/12/11 Finally made this w/ dried cherries and they are SO good.  The tartness of the cherries goes great w/ the saltiness of the sauce.  Mmmmm, definitely better than craisins!

I rated this recipe 4 stars b/c it was just lacking one thing. The sauce was great but the chicken itself was very plain. I followed sherryboat's instructions to a "T" except I marinated the chicken in teriyaki, soy sauce, chinese five spice, and the ginger. Then I browned the chicken (it should be whole not cut into chunks) in a pan and baked in the oven with the water chesnuts till done about 20 minutes. I sliced up the chicken and served in sauce on lettuce. This made the chicken very flavorful and I give my alterations 5 stars.

I made the mistake of adding teriyaki marinade instead of teriyaki sauce.  It didn't turn out very well.  I will try and make it again with the right sauce and I'm sure we'll like it much better.

We thought these were delish!  Pain to pit those fresh cherries, but worth it!  I added fresh minced garlic to the chicken/ginger saute.  Also added a bit of cilantro to the whole mix at the end.  Served with romaine lettuce fresh from our garden.  We loved the textures with the shredded carrots, the crunch of the toasted almonds, and the variety & range of flavors.  Very good recipe, Barry! Thank you so much!

These were great! The sauce was wonderful, and I'm really glad that I doubled it. I didn't have fresh ginger so I sprinkled ground ginger over the chicken while it was cooking along with a little bit of pepper and garlic salt. I also used dried cherries cause I'm too lazy to pit a pound of fresh cherries. I had some celery that needed to be used up so I added that and it gave a nice crunch in addition to the almonds. I can't wait to make these again.

This was fantastic!  My Husband even said "wow!  What made you think of this???"  Thats a huge complement!

I took other posters suggestions of adding water chest nuts.  I also used peanuts, rather than almonds.  I chopped the peanuts and water chest nuts in the food processor.  I used fresh cherries, cut them in quarters.  I also used sushi vinegar which is rice vinegar with sugar, among other things, so i eliminated the honey.

This was fantastic.  Loved it!  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was a good recipe. I had to use raisins b/c I had no cherries or craisins, but I'll make it again with dried cherries. The raisins are good, but make it more sweet. I bet the slight tartness of cherries would be even better. My kids, however, did not like it, but that's kids for you. We used iceberg lettuce. Bibb lettuce is my favorite for wraps but I didnt have it. But this is a keeper! I did have to make an extra batch of sauce to put on top of the mixture when serving. But that may be b/c I used slightly more chicken than the recipe called for. Regardless, making more sauce is a no brainer and it's nice to add it after you pile the chicken on to the lettuce leaf.

Great recipe -- even better as leftovers the next day.  We used canned cherries because fresh were out of season and it gave the chicken mixture a weird red tint (especially the leftovers).  Next time, we'll try craisins or dried cherries like others have suggested.

We just finished having this meal and it was absolutely awesome!  I reconstituted dried cherries (Added a little water to them and simmered for 15 minutes over medium heat - which was much easier than pitting cherries!) and we added red pepper flakes, but those were the only changes.  We ran out of lettuce and just ate it straight out of the bowl.  Wonderful recipe.  Thank you very much!

We thought these were just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly and in the end we found that we couldn't really taste the cherries.  On the plus side, this is a fairly healthy recipe and it was quick to put together.

I didn't read very far into the reviews, but I was suprised that no one mentioned how much carrot was in this recipe.  Every bite tasted like carrot to me and even though I enjoy a carrot or two, I don't want it to be the prodominant taste in a meal.  We didn't use the correct type of lettuce also, so it kept falling apart on the plate.  I doubt I'll make this again, but if I do...less carrot!!

Delicious!  Time consuming (pitting cherries, pre-cooking chicken, other prep) but a unique flavor that will make it all worthwhile.  Very, very good.

Mmmm, another yummy one! Much more convenient with a cherry pitter and food processor. Made the "dressing" as is and like it a lot. Needed to add some salt & pepper for my taste, and didnt have chicken breasts, so I deboned some thighs I had. Worth it! Thanks!

These were REALLY GOOD!  Very easy too.  Like many others, I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I cut the chicken into tiny bits (like PF Changs) and didn't use quite the amount of carrots and a little more green onion.  I had some frozen cherries that I had picked in the spring but added some dried cranberries too.  I liked the idea of Romaine, because of its ability to hold a lot without being wimpy.  Great recipe!

Very yummy.  Don't omit the cherries!  It's a bit more work, but well worth it I think for the texture and taste it adds.  I just grabbed some mixed nuts, almonds and cashews and chopped those up, it worked very well.  Also, I wish it had a bit more flavor, maybe the teriyaki sauce I used (Soy Vay, which is delicious) is a bit runny.  I think a bit of oyster sauce or hoisin sauce would do the trick to both thicken it up and add a bit more flavor.

Fabulous, Barry!  Thank you.  I must admit, though, that I spent more time reading the other reviews and trying to decide what to do than I did making it...LOL!  So many variations on the theme, and since I had never had a lettuce wrap I was really befuddled.  Well, at any rate, here is my 2 cents worth.
I did have to chuckle at the concept of omitting the cherries; however, I could not find any and liked the dried craisin concept.  So, with that in mind, I went a step further and used a dried fruit combo called "Very Berry".  My other modifications:  I marinated chix in soy and teriyaki for about 4 hours, drained, added garlic and waterchestnuts instead of almonds as some suggested while cooking, AND...after much agonizing over which lettuce, chose Romaine.
TASTY, TASTY, TASTY!  Thank you, again :)   *Oh, I also admit my prep time was considerable, but I think it will improve!*

i took this to a new years party & everyone asked for the recipe...which was kind of hard because i doctored it so much--I did take suggestions from other reviewers-- water chestnuts, soy sauce & fresh garlic-added TONS of garlic.I also added sesame oil to the peanut oil when i cooked the chicken. I also added a little oyster sauce & sugar to the sauce because i forgot the honey. Next time i think i would make it w/a dark/white meat combination (for more tenderness/flavor)& add some chopped celery or some other crunchy vegetable.  i also fried some rice noodles which i sprinkled over the top w/a little left over chopped onion. it looked great. thanks!

Very tasty. I made the sauce changes that were recommended as well as left out the cherries. Was yummy. The second time I made this, I added some sticky rice and cooked cabbage.  I have the rest of this for dinner tonight.. can't wait.

Good blend of flavors--not to salty and not to sweet.  Fairly easy to prepare.  Nice to have a warm chicken salad recipe.  I would recommend mixing in the lettuce rather than wrapping the mixture only for ease with the same taste.  Enjoy!!

Just an FYI... if you're pitting the cherries yourself, give this recipe way more than 15 minutes to prepare.  I actually halved the cherries, and it still seemed like too much.  Also cut the oil in half and added soy sauce and garlic powder, like others suggested.  I thought the recipe was okay, but my husband and in-laws loved it, so I've rated it four stars.  Thanks!

My husband loved this! Good leftovers for him while I travel during the week.  I marinated the chicken, ginger and chopped garlic in the AM. We substituted toasted pecans (vs. walnuts)and dried cranberries for the cherries. Also, added the suggested (chopped) mushrooms.  Spiced it up with Thai chili sauce and served with coconut rice.  Next time, we'll add toasted coconut to the wraps...or not (they are great as is).

Really tasty, although the filling kept falling out of the lettuce.  Next time I'll just mound the filling on top of the lettuce leaves.

I made this one night for a friend, and having never made lettuce wraps I was thrilled at how easy this recipe was. However cherries were not in season, so I couldnt find any.  Any suggestions on alternatives? I ended up just adding a bit more honey to keep that sweet flavor.

It's a keeper.  It's so hard to get cherries 9 months out of the year, when I made this in March (no cherries), I used regular craisens, 4.5 oz worth, that I proceeded to plump up (water to cover and 90 seconds in the microwave, then drained before added).  Out of pure cheapness I used napa cabbage for the lettuce ($1.50 vs. $4 for boston).  The cabbage worked, and I'd use it again, but I think the slightly milder tast of the boston would be better.

I rehydrated dried cherries (since cherries are not in season) and they were the best part of this recipe.  Always love a new way to do lettuce wraps!

Loved this item! As is the case often I used the recipe as just a base idea and modified with what I had on hand. Dried cherries, toasted cashews, bottled ginger teri sauce, red bell peppers for vegetables. Served it all on top of teriyaki shanghai noodles with iceberg on the side for wrapping. The cherries and the nuts really amped it up and it's a keeper that will be fun to play with. Thanks for posting.

Yum.  These were good.  I doubled the sauce amount and bought a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store.  How quick and easy!  Shredded the chicken, tossed into the roasted ginger.  (I used Sesame oil, found at our local Asian Grocery Store--you cannot beat the amazing prices there! And the ingredients are authentic).  I used green leaf lettuce and their size helped hold everything together.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe, and I make it often. I'm not the biggest ginger fan, so I substitute 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder for ginger root. I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a kick. I like to include a can of chopped, drained water chestnuts as well. This recipe, in my opinion, is always better the second day too.

I enjoyed this dish! As usual, I love the use of fresh ingredients. I thought the use of cherries was a great addition to the recipe. The only change I may make next time (as another reviewer has suggested) is to use sesame oil instead of canola oil as well as add some red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. Thanks!

This was very good- I omitted the carrot and used dried cherries plumped in a little chicken broth because the store didn't have any fresh this time of year. I think it worked out fine. I also toasted my own almonds in about 1 T of white sugar. Loved the sauce on these. Thanks for sharing!

I threw these ingredients in the crockpot because I knew it would be a busy day.  I added twice the vinegar and teriaki sauce.  I used dried cranberries because I didn't have any cherries.  Loved the red leaf lettuce with it. My husband and daughter loved the final product!  And it was SUPER easy.  I will definitely make it again and this time throw in some mushrooms.  I agree, this recipe would not be the same without the tanginess of the cranberries/cherries!  Don't leave 'em out!

We just recently ate at PF Chang's and the entire time we were eating the lettuce wraps, all we could think was how much we missed the cherries.  To be honest, we used swear by PFC!  But now we enjoy this recipe so much more!!  We made extra sauce and minced the chicken after it was cooked.  We prefered this vs. cubed chicken.  This is such a fresh and delicious dish!  We recommend this recipe to all our family!!

I loved the idea of making these but was hoping for a stronger taste.  I'm comparing them to an appetizer I had at 2 different restaurants, and those definitely had more zip to it.  I'm going to keep looking for another recipe, this just was just too bland for me.  I'm bummed since I went to the store just to get the ingredients I didn't have.  We don't like cherries so we omitted those.  I doubled the vinegar and teriyaki measurements too.

I am a single woman and unfortunately didn't have several ingredients that the recipe called for because I wouldn't use them in time.  However, I did cook with what I had and discovered that the recipe is versatile because it was still tasty.  I didn't have the cherries and I felt that the sweet flavor they would have provided would have made these excellent.  This is what I used to substitute:  white vinegar, ground ginger, red onion (I did cook the onion a bit with the chicken to soften a bit and so it could absorb some of the other flavors and not be as strong).  Also, instead of mixing everything in a bowl I just threw it in the pan while it was on medium heat and heated it for probably 30 seconds.  I also added minced garlic.  Tasty way to use my lettuce leaves.

This was an instant hit! Substituted:  Sushi ginger instead of fresh.  Can of sugar free bing cherries, which I rinsed all of the juice off (local store didn't have any fresh ones), used soy sauce instead of teriyaki and red wine rice vinegar instead of plain vinegar.  It hit the spot !

This is a family staple at my house. I did make a few changes. I use a lb of ground chicken instead of shredded..it's just easier. I double the sauce, but don't put oil in the sauce. Oh, and I use Lawrey's Terrikyaki/pineapple sauce marinade. It has more flavor than other terriyaki sauce I've use. I add a cup of minced mushrooms, a small can of waterchestnuts (chopped), and toasted almond slivers. I have yet to use cherries.  It's so delicious!!

I exchanged mango chucks for the cherries and used light Soy Sauce for a lighter taste.  I warpped the in Boston letttuce leaves and they were delicious!  I also had an asian chili sauce to add as desired.

I substituted the cherries with craisins and it worked out fine and I skipped the almonds since my kids don't like "nuts".  This was a very nice change in the menu for us.  Thanks for the recipe.

My mom just moved in with me and she is diabetic.  I made this for dinner, but excluded the teriyaki sauce, added 1 Tbsp of lower sodium soy sauce and only half the honey.  She loved it and her sugar levels are fine!  I will definitely make this again!

First time making chicken lettuce wraps and they came out delicious.  I didn't have vinegar or teriyaki sauce, so I used lemon juice and soy sauce instead.  I also put a dash of oyster sauce and sweet chili sauce.  I marinated the chicken breasts overnight and they came out divine.  I really enjoyed the hint of fresh ginger.  I also quickly sauteed the carrots in the chicken mixture (I still wanted the carrots to have a crunch).  I served the chicken with butter lettuce (which in my opinion, is the perfect lettuce for this dish as it holds in the chicken just perfectly) and topped the chicken with some crunchy bean sprouts.  I was trying to mimic those restaurants that serve these wraps with those small crunchy noodles on top.  The bean sprouts definitely added a great crunch and freshness to the wrap.  I was planning on serving this with a hot horseraddish sauce (thinned out) but the chicken was already very flavorful.  I can't wait to make this again!

I made this for a picnic and my friend thanked me about 5 or 6 times. Modifications:  To cook ginger root you peel the skin and then dice the inside.  I used my hands to pit the cherries (faster than a knife).  You just twist it to get the first half and then pry the other side off the pit. I used apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar.  I cooked the chicken in the oven before I cut it up and sauted it.  It is easier to cut cooked.  I toasted the almonds in the remaining ginger and oil.

Followed directions but doubled the sauce per others suggestions.  Used dried cherries but added snow pea pods.  This gave it very good flavor and crunch. Will definitely make again and cut back a little on the shredded carrots.  Also used butter/bibb lettuce.

My husband loved the taste of this recipe. However he hated the dripping lettuce wraps. Next time I'll either put it over shredded lettuce or thicken it a bit and put it over rice. I added water chestnuts, chopped garlic, red pepper flakes, and chopped mushrooms.

Great with chicken breast or ground chicken. Needs water chestnuts and thai chili sauce for that extra kick! We like it with iceberg lettuce the best.

Very nice and light, perfect for a quick summer dinner. I didn't follow the exact ingredient measurements, so I have no idea if the proportions are right on this recipe, but by eyeballing it, it definitely came out delicious.

The flavors blended nicely, especially with the cherries and roasted almonds. Next time I may use chicken leftovers and serve it more as a salad.

At first taste, I wasn't sure about the cherries in this combination, but it grew on me.  Hubby and kids picked them out and ate them separately.  I didn't make this as wraps, just put it on a bed of lettuce.  Like others, I added some cornstarch to the dressing mixture to thicken it.  I also only shredded 2 carrots--1 and a half cups would have been way too much for my taste.  Overall, a tasty salad.  Thanks for the idea!

I'm not sure why so many people are omitting the cherries from this recipe--that's what makes it stand out from regular old lettuce wraps. I omitted the green onion (I'm not a fan) and used homemade teriyaki, and since all I had on hand was pre-cut romaine, I wrapped chicken salad and lettuce up in some flatbread. Delicious! Next time I'll try adding water chestnuts, too.

Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but this was just "OK" for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using dried cherries in place of the dark sweet cherries.  It was just too sweet for my taste.  I might try it again using water chesnuts as the previous reviewer did.  That would reduce the sweetness.

It was delicious! I did change a couple of things though. I used a sweetened teriaki sauce and didn't put in the honey. Also, since we didn't really feel like pitting cherries, we used cherry flavored craisens. Regular craisens or dried cherries work well too. Served with couscous, cucumber salad and shredded carrots so guests could make their own mix!

WOW! This is definately one of our FAVORITES!!! I have made this several times, trying both the original version and the "non-cherry-PFChangs-like-version." Both are FABULOUS!!! I served this to a friend of mine who asked for the recipe, who then served it to her mother-in-law. I got a call from her mother-in-law a few days later, asking for the recipe. YUM!

Our dinner group tried is this item and loved it.  We had an asian theme dinner and the wrap was the hit of the party.

Dried cherries were used in place of the dark sweet cherries and it still tasted wonderful.

I tried this recipe out for 12 guests.  They really loved it.  It was delicious, the only thing I did not add was the onions because some of the guests do not eat onions.  It was still wonderful.

Fabulous!  Everyone at my party loved it.  I doubled the sauce and used Bibb Lettuce.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for something Low-carb, Low-fat, and low sodium, yet so delicious.

I really enjoyed this, but the kids did not. I followed the recipe exactly, right down to the part about the lettuce leaves. We substituted tortillas for a different taste. The cherries and almonds combined for an interesting combination of textures, and the dressing is simply delicious. Thanks!

This recipe is great. I omitted the honey, and used the cherry flavored raisins instead of cherries and it turned out perfect. Try adding chopped baby sweet corn to the mixture as well for extra crunch.

This was pretty good, but I had a hard time getting the Iceburg lettuce leaves unpeeled evenly.  I took the advice of a previous user and omitted the cherries and honey and doubled the sauce using garlic powder and red pepper flakes - yummy!  Very healthy!

A lot of work for a rather bland dish.  I served it to visiting friends and family and let's just say that nobody asked for seconds.

I added water chesnuts and garlic when I made this recipe.  I also now know why someone would want a cherry pitter.
The sauce needs to be a little thicker.  I did add some corn starch to the sauce mixture, but the cherries made more juice 
so I will add more corn starch next time I make this.  My 3 & 5 year olds loved this.  It is a keeper!
