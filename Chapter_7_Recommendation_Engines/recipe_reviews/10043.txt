Since I found it, this has become my family's favorite cookie recipe!  I like to add butterscotch chips instead of walnuts for those who don't like nuts in their cookies.  What wonderful cookies!

This is a stellar recipe for hachiya persimmon cookies! I'm bringing these to my family's Thanksgiving festivities, because they are an incredible hit with my neighbors (who I share in the bounty of my backyard persimmon tree) and with my co-workers. I followed the recipe to the "T" and my goodness it is by far the best persimmon cookie I've had since my Tia Maria made them for me as a kid growing up in Chile. Thanks again. 
PS: for those who don't like these too spicy, take the spices down to 1/4 TS, and the complaint about the "black specks" are due to the ground cloves. If you don't like the appearance of them, don't put that spice in, but the cookie will suffer their fantastic flavoring.

I have to give 5 stars based on hubby; I made these at his request, I had never had a persimmon cookie and probably won't try anymore. :) Not my flavor. But he RAVED about them. 3 of my 5 kids loved as well. I subbed pecans instead of walnuts and only put in 1/2 cup sugar. He's already brought home more persimmons to make some more and I only made last night. Thank you for a good recipe that I think is also healthy.

I used 3 ripe persimmons and the persimmon taste was still too subtle for me.  Next time, I will add more.  (Update - It might have been the persimmons I bought as I've just cut open one to eat and it was gritty in taste.  Also, all the cookies turned soft and black the next day but still tasted fine.)  I knocked the 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp as I find it an overpowering spice.  15 minutes left my first batch almost burnt! I had better results at 12-14 minutes.

This recipe is wonderful. I was out of raisins and used dried cranberries instead. I was also out of walnuts and used 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup oatmeal as a filler. I also didn't have ground cloves and threw in some ground ginger. Very yummy and great with a glass of apple juice!

My step-daughter HATES persimmons, but I couldn't keep these in the kitchen.  In an attempt to keep some in the kitchen I told her they were made with persimmons...she laughed and wouldn't believe me.  This was great.  I noticed some reviews say the cookies didn't have any taste, remember to use ripe mushy feeling persimmons.

Better than grandma's!  This recipe made 3 dozen 2 1/2" cookies with a cakelike/spongy center and slightly crispy edges.  Perfect!  The 2.5" cookies took about 13 minutes at 350 in my gas oven near sea level.  The 3" cookies took closer to 15 minutes.  I didn't have any walnuts, so I left them out.  Still, really yummy.  These cookies passed the "skeptical husband" taste test and made my whole house smell sooooo good.    I think I used the Fuyu variety of persimmons: still firm when ripe and shaped like a squat tomato (no point on the bottom).  I peeled them, diced them and pureed them well in a blender.  I will definitely make these again if I can get my hands on more persimmons!

These cookies were very good.  I used butterscotch chips instead of nuts, but my husband thought they were a little sweet.  I'll try walnuts next time.  The spices are perfect!

I rarely bake, RARELY, but got a hold of a couple of Persimmons and found this cookie recipe.  Read all the comments, and decided I could do this.  I have but one word for you:  WOW !!!  I am so pleased with myself, they are wonderful, tasty, and hubby gave it two thumbs up.  I will make these again, that is for sure.  I used a little tiny bit less than the 1/2 teaspoon spices, and reduced the baking time by one minute.  The spots in the cookies give them character, and are only the raisins peeking through.  I left pieces of pulp in the batter and they show nicely on the cookie, without burning.  See photo. Who knew a persimmon cookie could taste SO good.

As a vegan I'm always tweaking traditional recipes by substituting plant-based for animal-based ingredients.  For this one I substituted canola oil for the butter and about half a banana for the egg.  Also, I had an Indian blend spice on hand that consisted of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and anise that I used, adding extra cinnamon. The staff and volunteers at the spay/neuter clinic where I work raved about the cookies, including the omnivores.  They couldn't believe they were vegan!  Great basic recipe.

Love this recipe...I was looking everywhere for a recipe to use persimmons. My only changes, I substituted dried cranberries instead of raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also used the same basic recipe to make muffins and bread too. If you have a sweet tooth I'd suggest using chocolate chips as well. I'm pretty sure there is nothing you can do to mess up this recipe.

Great!  I add a little more persimmon pulp for a softer cookie.  I also have made this recipe a few times and have added stevia in place of sugar.

These cookies are so YUMMY!! I can't get enough of them. I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked them longer since I was using parchement paper. (Didn't want the added grease on baking pan) But other than that I did everything the recipe called for and they turned out fantastic. Can't wait to make them again.

I just encountered persimmons for the first time, I bought several and tried them by themselves but found them sort of bland. My dad told me that he grew up with a persimmon tree in his yard and his dad would bake persimmon cookies. I tried this recipe first and I will not try any others - this one is amazing!!! They just came out of the oven and I can't stop gobbling them up :) I didn't have any raisins or walnuts, but I did add 1/2 c. of chopped almonds and they turned out beautifully. 15 minutes might have been a bit long, perhaps 13-14 would be better.

Not really a cookie recipe. Mine turned out more like muffin-consistency. The persimmon flavor is so mild I would have never guessed it was in there.

A neighbor gave me a huge bag of persimmons and I had no idea how to use them...then my sister invited me to a cookie exchange...I used this recipe and they were a hit. I had to make 12 dozen and the recipe was easy to make. For my personal batch I used a little less spice but still tasted great.

the cloves overhwhelmed the cookies and there wasn't any persimmon flavor at all. i used more persimmon than called for specifically to get more flavor, but to no avail. maybe i did something wrong? like not pureeing enough? the finished cookie had black specks/chunks in it. i figured that was burned persimmon pieces or tannins from the persimmon. either way, it was too spicy. texture was ok, though. i only baked for 12 minutes cuz i thought that would prevent the black speckling. i might try to frost it or something to hide it and counter the too-strong cloves. i was looking forward to this cookie and was very disappointed. =o(

It was very delicious! I added my own little changes to the recipe but thats just second nature to me to make it my own! I followed everything above but substituted 1/4 cup sugar with brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and 1/4 tsp. allspice! I also removed the rasins and wallnuts since I didnt have any but I think the latter would make a good addition to them. These little fellas baked perfectly golden brown in about 12 minutes for me and they dont really rise or spread so you can easily fit 15 on a standard cooking sheet.  Enjoy!!

This recipe worked very well for me. It sure does need icing on them though to perk them up in my opinion. Otherwise, for me they would not be sweet enough. Also if you add an orange color icing they are pretty for the holidays.

These have a nice holiday taste, but are relatively low on flavor. I'm a fan of moist chewy cookies. These have a 'cakey' texture.

I made these cookies and had already put the baking soda in the persimmons before realizing I was out of flour! After returning from the store, the pulp had become slightly solid, and then I added the wet ingredients directly into that, instead of blending them first. I thought I had ruined the cookies, but they still were delicious! I just wish I had followed the recipe!

No nuts, and these are just like what my Great Grandma used to make. A great moist cake-like cookie.

A wonderful, moist cookie, one of our favorites! Same recipe as the one I’ve used for years, except ours calls for 1 cup of persimmon pulp. That’s usually 2-2 1/2 large (hachiya) persimmons. If you use 2 of the small type of persimmon (fuyu), you won’t have nearly enough pulp.

I've made this recipe a few times now and everyone in my family loves it! I have tweaked the recipe quite a bit though to make it more healthier. I used 4 persimmons, instead of 2 cups of flour, I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup almond flour, coconut oil instead of butter and coconut palm sugar in place of white sugar and lastly 2 eggs instead of 1 egg because I like the cake like consistency!! These turn out amazing each time (I bake them on parchment lined baking sheet) thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!

New holiday favorite! I altered the recipe by cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup this allowed for the natural sweetness and flavor of the persimmon to come through with the spices.

I love these cookies, but I like to switch the raisins for cranraisins. The tartness gives them a good contrast with the sweetness of the cookies. I have made it both ways and I get better reviews with the cranraisins.

I really liked these cookies, the spices reminded me of the islands.  I did use honey instead of sugar and whole wheat and oat flour instead of AP flour, they were excellent!  I will make them again!!

The persimmon/soda mixture turned into a jell after sitting for a few minutes. When I added all of the wet ingredients together the butter broke out into small balls.  The cookies,however, turned out fine. I cooked two trays at once and the 2nd tray flattened out too much.

Other than cutting back a bit on the sugar (we prefer a low sweetness level) made these according to the recipe using 1 cup persimmon pulp I had in the freezer.  Love the way these turned out and the spices are spot on.

Freeze the persimmons first and thaw on a plate on the counter, removing any accumulated water,  until you are ready to make. At my house this took half a day.  This was very similar to my mothers recipe except this one  added cloves. Super yummy difference!

Envision a warm home, twinkling Christmas lights, a cup of hot something or other, a log burning in the fireplace, the giggle of a happy toddler under the Christmas tree, and the warmth of a full heart...  What does that taste like?  These.  Seriously.  Make them and taste Christmas happiness in your mouth.  Just made them for the first time and they are a pure joy to eat.

Yummy! I had never seen a persimmon before a girlfriend from work gave me two. I plowed thru recipes trying to figure out what to do with them when I found this recipe for cookies. I pureed the Baking Soda with the Persimmons; substituted the Flour for Cake Flour; kept the measurements of spices, egg and butter the same; substituted the Walnuts with Pecans then dusted lightly with Baker's sugar! I live on the coast so I Convection-Baked for 20 minutes at 325º. The cookies came out beautifully, lightly golden with a candied crunch from the sugar, soft and spongy inside! I couldn't keep the boys out of them.

Made these when I had persimmons and no idea what to do with them - and these were wonderful! Brought some for a friend who wanted the recipe too! Perfect for fall (even though I had them in winter!) Used currants and walnuts which gave the cookies extra depth - they're great!!!!!

I use this recipe, but without the cloves.  I also use whole wheat flour and Splenda with great results.  I don't like persimmons, but with 2 trees, I had to do something.  I do freeze the pulp for later use.  Great recipe!

These are fantastic - flavorful and they stay soft even when well cooked. The orange icing adds a perfect sweetness and additional dimension. My husband is allergic to walnuts so I substituted with pecans.  Great!

Great base recipe! Used a gluten free flour mix, cut the sugar in half, added a dash of vanilla and 1/8 cup honey for a personal  twist.  So far, nothin but raving reviews. :)

This was my first time using persimmons in cookies.  Two weren't enough.  The taste didn't come through.  Also, I had no idea that when you mix baking soda with a fruit that the outcome would be gel.  I put these together too soon.  Should have been mixed just before mixing in with other ingredients.  I had to mash up so it would mix in.  I put in less sugar and replaced the raisins with dried cranberries.  Despite all of the mishaps--the cookie had good texture and size.  I managed to get 3 1/2 dozen.  Looking forward to making these again.

I would definitely make these again. I followed the recipe but added a mix of raw pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, chocolate chips and walnuts for a yummy mix. Some cookies spread out really far, others stayed in a perfect shape. 15 minutes in the oven, plus 3 minutes with the oven off for a bit more browning. They came out soft, sweet, and delicious!

I only had one problem, my cookies looked less like cookies and more like knots. If anybody knows what I did wrong can you help me out? 

Aside from that, they taste great.

Had a huge persimmon tree when I was a kid, Gramma and Mom would make the cookies, they didn't use a recipe but this one sounded like how the two of them would make those wonderful, memorable cookies, yes!  They did bring the comfort and memory of the cookies. So glad that my girl friend has a tree, and shared more than enough, to freeze and make more.

I made these cookies twice.  The second time around, they tasted  much better.  The key is to use very ripe persimmons.  The ones I used almost looked like it was bad.  I ripened them by placing them in a paper bag with a banana.  The cookies turned out great!

I used coconut oil instead of butter. I did not use any sugar. These cookies turned out very soft. I did not add sugar because I think the fruit itself is sweet enough. I think honey or maple syrup can be substituted for the sugar. In addition, I did not add any nuts nor raisins.

I added instead of 1 cup sugar,  I added 3/4 CUP of coconut sugar.   Because you already have enough sweetness from the persimmons.   Next time,  I will cut bk even more.
My oven took approx 16 minutes.  This recipe was so easy that I will make this a keeper in my house.

I didn't know what persimmon pulp was, so I boiled the persimmons and put them in the blender with some of the boiled water used. Made mush out of it and poured it into the mix. They came out good! Like another review, it wasn't creaming, until I added the persimmon stuff I made.

I have made persimmon cookies from a  recipe on this site before and LOVED them; however, this time i used this recipe and i found the cookies had a very floury and dry taste, that me nor my family was very fond of. I would definitely recommend the recipe called Persimmon Cookies III, which were much better.

I tried making Persimmon cookies a couple years ago, and although my son liked them, no one else really cared for them. But my Aunt gave me a bag of Persimmons so I thought I'd give it another shot. I found this recipe and read the reviews. I used Craisins instead of raisins and used walnuts from our tree and added chocolate chips. I tasted the dough and kept tasting! I never do that! The cookies were fantastic and my husband said they were the best cookies that I've ever made! I am freezing them for the Holidays, but I may have to make another batch because they may not make it to the freezer! As another reviewer mentioned, it makes a difference in using ripe persimmons and I used three. Perfection! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. It's a keeper! (PS, I too cut down the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon and that was just right!)

Used Fuyu persimmons instead of Hachiya, so maybe they weren't quite as sweet or flavorful as they could have been, but these still had a nice, Christmasy taste. Mine were on the cakey side, too.

Delicious! However a bit on the bread side. Could I have over mixed this? I also made a batch with raisins soaked in a cinnamon whiskey and walnuts! Yummy!

So yummy!! I used 3 persimmons only because mine weren't super juicy. Replaced spices with pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have all of the individual ones. I love these (especially with a cup of coffee), and my kids gave thumbs up too. Thanks!!!

I got persimmons in my Full Circle Farm box and didn't know what to do with them, so I made these cookies. I like the cookies because they are fall-ish (I guess the cinnamon and clove seasoning with the nuts), but I didn't get any persimmon taste. I used very mushy persimmons (I thought maybe they weren't useable, but read that this is the time to cook with them), but I still didn't get an persimmon-y flavor? I'm not sure what an extra, juicy persimmon would do to the consistency...?

Simple, delicious, and just the perfect amount of spice.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and they were finally chopped.  My fiance ended up eating 5, and he doesn't like persimmon cookies!  :-)  A must have recipe for traditional holiday recipes!

These cookies were okay.  I didn't have walnuts, but they still turned out alright.  They didn't look very pretty, and they weren't as sweet as I like.  However, my friends thought the spices and flavors went well together.
