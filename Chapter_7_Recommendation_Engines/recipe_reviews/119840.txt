Very good.  Spices can be upped.  FYI, my quiche did not appear to be done even after an extra 5 min, as the knife didn't come out clean, but I took it out  of the oven anyway & discovered when serving it was indeed done; the quiche just still appears wet when complete.  Had I not gone ahead and taken it out I would have overcooked it.

To avoid the "watery" filling, remember that zucchini contains a lot of water. I sliced my zucchini, put in in a colander (paper towel works well too) and lightly salted it. This leeches out the excess water and keeps the quiche thick. I hope this works for you too.  

Thanks for posting! I really enjoyed this!

Tasty and healthy. The curry gives it an interesting touch that I liked.  I substituted broccoli for the zuchini, and it turned out great.

Excellent. Everyone loved it. I added couple pinches more of the curry, and a quarter cup of shredded cheddar cheese.

I have made this quite a few times and it always tastes different because of my selection of vegetables - but always good! I consistently do not use curry and also, I have never been able to use 5 eggs. Any one else with this problem?? I use about 3 to 4 eggs in a 9 1/2" pie shell.

This was incredibly tasty!  The cinnamon gave it a nice, unexpected flavor.  I used an organic whole wheat pie crust.  Also, I made the following changes:  I didn't use curry, I added a sprinkling of mozzerella cheese, and I used cherry tomatoes instead of diced.  I also layered the zucchini in a circular pattern on top.  I will definitely make this again!

I used broccoli instead of zuccini too, and used fresh parmesan cheese (used 1/2 cup).  It was really good, great as leftovers too!  Even my husband liked it (with a bit of Tabasco on it).

This was very good, the curry powder gives it a great taste and a beautiful golden color.  I didn't use fresh veggies, I chose two 10 oz boxes of frozen steamed veggies and nuked them until almost done.  Added to the pie plate, poured the egg on, baked, and enjoyed!  

**I did cook my quiche for 45 mins and it still wasn't completely done in the middle.  Make sure you check it, may take an add'l 10 mins or so.

My husband said this was the best quiche he's ever had in his life, and even my kids ate it!  I increased the amt of curry to 1/2 tsp as suggested and added some bacon and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese.  I fit all 5 of the eggs without a problem.

Excellent! definitely a keeper. Added asparagus simply because I had them. Used 2 preformed 6inch pie crusts and the mixture was the perfect amount.

I made this quiche for a family brunch and everyone loved it! (well, the adults did, the kids opted for the bacon & cheese quiche!)  Now I am always asked to make it!  I use egg beaters instead of eggs and cannot tell the difference. I also substitute thawed frozen spinach for the zucchini and green pepper (make sure to squeeze the spinch out very well).  I've never added curry or cinnamon, and in my opinion, it doesn't need either.  Very good and very healthy!

I made this for my brother and some of his friends-- since people were saying it could make 2 quiches, I went ahead and planned for 2 by adding a little extra of all veggies and spices and 3 more eggs. Because of what I had on hand, I made my own pie crust, used red pepper instead of green, added asparagus and I forgot the Parmesan! lol! I also sweated the zucchini before I put it in. It was DELICIOUS!! It made 2 lovely quiches, and it was all gone :) This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent! I didn't have curry or zucchini, so I left those out. I added about 1-1 1/2 cups of chopped fresh spinach. I also added a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the top of the quiche in the last 15-20 minutes of cooking. I added more salt and pepper as reviewers suggested. Last, I didn't have a pre made crust on hand so I made one using the Pie Crust III recipe from this site (and didn't bake it before adding the fillings). It was awesome! It felt like such a healthy meal, too!

I've made this recipe several times with varying vegetable mixes and they all turned out great. Adding cheddar can add flavor too, but it's unnecessary. 

The only thing I would suggest for sure is switching the milk with heavy cream. It helps the egg and veggie mix hold together.

Very nice.  Took it to work and it was a hit with my coworkers.  I tossed in green beans and used different color peppers bc I had them.  Left out the onions but used onion powder.  I also used water instead of milk so a coworker of mine could eat it.  Baked perfectly in the suggested time frame, and obviously substitute ingredients work great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. Amazing. The spices add an interesting depth. Made over a thin mixture of biscuit mix (a little thicker than pancake) instead of a pie crust. Added some chopped garlic. It was phenomenal.

Made this using vegetables I had lying around the fridge such as broccolli and cheese.  You can very easily play around with this recipe to your liking.  Made the cheesy quiche crust recipe on this site to go with the quiche.

This is the best Quiche I have EVER tasted! It comes out perfect every time, it's truly amazing! I didn't have a problem putting the mix on the pastry shell. I think if you let the veggies cook and reduce a bit, adding the 5 eggs won't cause you to spill the mix.

Great base for any veggie quiche! I used this as a rough guide to how much stuff to put in my crust but ended up cutting too many vaggies (I just used a little of everything I had) and then needed to add an egg and 1 egg white extra to try and compensate and it worked out just fine! Used feta for cheese and bacobits for fun :) Topped each piece with some tapatio and sour cream. YUM!

I loved the idea of this recipe but not the amount of eggs required so i substituted 3/4 tofu for 3 eggs (1/4 tofu = 1 egg [smoothed in the blender with the milk or you can use a soft tofu]). The result was good, but not as good as the another quiche i made that was only made with tofu and veggies. I think the egg taste stuck out a bit more than i wanted. Overall i loved the results, but could have done without as many onions i suppose and you could up another veggie in favor of others. The tomatoes made it more liquidy than i expected even after removing the seeds and coring the tomatoes. i poured the liquid out about 3/4 of the way through baking as it was seeping over the top of the quiche and had no other liquid issues after that.  When i make this again i might just omit the eggs in favor of tofu, milder taste. I loved the curry and don't know what the cinnamon really did for it, but i added it anyway.

This really came out beautiful.  I didn't care for the taste as much.  I didn't have zucchini so used broccolli instead.  I think I'll try it again with the zucchini and maybe a different combo of spices.  Looked professional and held together very nicely when cut.

This was a great recipe! My Mom and I made a few changes. We used:  2 shallots instead of 1 1/2 c. onion.  We substituted: -Golden Cherry tomatoes instead of regular tomatos -Tatuma Squash (2) instead of zuchini. -Italian blend (asiago, Monterrey jack, parm, and mozzarella) of shredded cheese instead of just parmesan -A red pepper instead of a green one We Added: - ¼ tsp of nutmeg to the spices - 2 c. spinach chopped.  After sautéing the veggies, we drained the excess liquid  We also layered the ingredients: - 1/4 of the egg mixture into the bottom of the pan - then 1/2 of the veggie mix - then 1/2 of the spinach - then 1/2 of the cheese mixture Repeat with the remaining veggies, spinach and egg/cheese mixture. Our oven cooks hot so we baked at 325 degrees for 50 minutes.

I love this recipe so much. It's very versatile in terms of using different veggies, and I don't usually measure them-- I just throw in a little of this and that depending on what needs to get used.  I love the curry and cinnamon together in this dish, I feel like they bring all of the flavors of the veggies together.  I use the Easy Pie Crust (whole wheat) from this site and my family of somewhat picky eaters loves it!

This is great! The only things I did differently: left out mushrooms because I didn't have any, added minced garlic to the vegetable to saute and used cheddar cheese (probably more than 1/4 cup). My boyfriend and I both had seconds!

Excellent light quiche.  Used 4, not 5, eggs.  Added 1/4 cup Mozzarella to the Parmesan.  Served with salad and Beaujolais Nouveau.

Thanks to another reviewer, I knew I would have leftover egg/milk/cheese mixture, so instead of putting the vegetables in the pastry and pouring the egg mixture over the top, I waited for the vegetables to cool and then added the egg mixture to THEM before pouring what I could into the pastry. I was prepared with an extra small pan on the side that I had buttered and coated with breadcrumbs for the excess which I baked alongside the quiche. There was enough to fill two standard 9-inch shells, so I will probably try that next time. My shells weren't the DEEP dish type, so as long as you aren't using those you could get two quiches out of this.

Delicious! Used only 4 eggs b/c 5 seemed a little excessive. I didn't have a pie crust on hand but the quiche turned out perfect directly in the pan. Will make again.

So impressed with the flavors.  The curry and cinnamon are amazing, subtle yet flavorful. I added more spices (garlic salt, onion powder, paprika). Also added a bit of sour cream with the cheese for a richer flavor. Smelled so good, I went ahead and made one for the freezer! Really delicious!!

Omg!! This is absolutely amazing!!! My entire family scarfed it down telling me how good it is. I will definately make it again. I cooked down the veggies until the liquid was gone. I also added a little more curry and cinnamon. I can't express how delicious this is!!! Try it!! You'll love it too!!

This recipe was more like sauteed vegetable pie with very little "quiche" character. It tasted good...as long as I didn't think it was a quiche.

I made this using Eggbeaters due to a high cholesterol problem in the family, and the spices and veggie combined with the Eggbeaters was fantastic! (I did leave out the curry - no one in my family enjoys that flavor.) My little brother, who abhors any sort of vegetable, even asked for a second helping. I will definitely make this again - thank you for posting!

The cinnamon really took away from the flavorful veggies, which is why I only gave the quiche 3 stars. All in all though, it wasn't terrible. Will definitely make it again, minus the cinnamon.

I used whole milk (i find if you use skim milk the quiche turns out watery) and don't have curry powder so used about 3/4 tsp of mild curry paste and it was excellent. No left overs! Will definitely make it again.

Fantastic! I upped the curry powder to 1/2 tsp like many reviewers suggested. I also used canned artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms and upped the cheese to half a cup. Incredible. The whole house loved it! I've already been told I'll be making it again. :)

Fantastic! I subbed brocoli for zuke as I had some on hand. To reduce fat and calories I used Egg Beaters and skim milk. I was a little worried about subbing for whole eggs but it came out perfect.

This was tasty!  I loved the curry and cinnamon.  I will be making this again and again.  I did not have a green pepper so I doubled the zucchini and mushrooms. I like lots of veggies.  I did not have a problem with it being too watery, it was just perfect.  The key is to make sure you cook the veggies long enough to get rid of the extra liquid.

This was my first quiche I have ever attempted.  It surpassed all my expectations.  I used asparagus instead of zucchini because of all the other comments about zucchini making it too watery.  It tasted great - even my kids ate it!

This sounds a lot like the recipe I use. I use cayenne pepper instead of curry and omit the cinnamon. Also add 1 cup each of mozzerella and swiss with the 1/4 cup paremesan. Reduce eggs to 2. You can use broccoli instead of zuchinni. Also good with a whole wheat crust. Very cheesey and Yummy!

I was surprised at how many vegetables were in this quiche.  They nearly filled my shell!  It was delicious, and the curry powder really added to the flavor.  When you sautee the vegetables, I recommend starting with the vegetables that take longest to cook (like onions and bell peppers), and then add the tomatoes last because they break down so quickly.

Loved this recipe and got rave reviews. I too added a bit more curry and cinammon and cheddar cheese.  My only complaint was this recipe for me made enough to fill TWO pie crusts so next time I will use a deep dish b/c this did NOT fit into one. But it was delish!

Excluded curry and cinnamon, subbed orange pepper for green, added cayenne pepper, other than that, followed recipe exactly and it came out great! I doubled the recipe and made two quiches.  The flavor was delicious.  What a treat. I will be making this again!

Delicious!  I made this recipe lighter by making a potato crust (half cup of shredded onion, strained of liquid, plus quarter cup of flour, mixed with one & a half pounds shredded potato also drained of liquid and pressed into the pie plate - cook for 20 min @450, brush with olive oil and cook for another 15 until it turns a nice golden brown.  Then lower temp to 350 and add filling as per recipe except my was done in 25 minutes)  I omitted the green pepper and sauteed my vegetables in batches to allow them to cook properly.  I used one seeded Italian tomato and and added it as is without frying.  I also removed the yolks from two of the eggs and didn't add the curry or cinnamon to accommodate my finicky family.  Fantabulous!

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  Better than I thought it would be.  One thing I would do differently next time is use only 4 eggs instead of 5.  I did use 1 whole zucchini which was a little more than the required amount which did not alter the taste whatsoever.  This is an excellent recipe and I will make it many times to come.

Flavoring was excellent. However, I think there were too many onions. If I made it again I would use only 3/4 cup of onions and more green vegetables.

Love the flavor of the spices together, which I doubled (even the salt, by acccident). But why do my quiches always turn out flat? I want a big fluffy one.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  No issues with it being watery or being undercooked as others had.  I liked that this didn't use spinach, because it seems like almost every other quiche recipe does.  The cinnamon added a very nice flavor!  Only 2 small complaints - first, the recipe didn't specify how much to sautee the veggies.  I guessed and did it til they were totally soft and they turned out well.  Also I didn't get the whole lining the shell with foil thing.  When I took the foil off, it tore chunks of the shell, since it was quite soft and doughy after being in the oven for 5 minutes.  But those are minor complaints.  This one's a definite keeper!

Very flavorful.  I was short on veggies, so I substituted frozen chopped spinach for the zucchini and bell pepper.  I also added a bit of shredded cheddar that I was trying to get rid of.  With these modifications, the quiche was not watery at all after 35 minutes.  4 eggs fit just perfectly- 5 would have been too many.

This came out perfect and delicious! I used only onion, tomato, and zucchini for the vegetables, replaced the Parmesan with feta, and used 4 eggs instead of 5.  Easy to put together and came out great on the first try.  The curry/cinnamon combo is a winner.

Awesome recipe. I play around with the veggies each time I make it depending on what I have on hand. I don't add the cinnamon and I use cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. Definitely a keeper. There is never any left! Thanks.

The quiche was easy to make, but the taste was a bit blend and slightly watery. I found it had too many vegetables in relation to the egg mass which holds it together.

Quite delicious! I chopped up an equal amount of leftover ratatouille (recipe on this site) for the filling, omitted the curry (not a personal fan) and added crumbled bacon. The flavors work really well together and the cinnamon is definitely a nice touch. Also, I would recommend a deep-dish pie shell. This quiche could quite possibly be the loveliest way to use up all the zucchini your neighbor gives you every year.

I used almost double the veggie amount, upped the curry double and used the same amount of eggs. We used sliced portobello mushrooms, zuchinni, and brocooli in the quiche, then I added sliced tomatoes on top and sprinkled some feta. YUM. Will make again and again.

I tried the moroccan veggie tagine recipe on this site (didnt work out quite so well btw) and had a bunch of slightly spicy leftover veggies. i drained the liquid and used these for the filling, and it turned out superb! great way to use up leftover veggies, i ahd carrots, cauliflow and eggplant so whatever type of veg you use it seems to work out fine. this will become a regular dish for my family

Absolutely wonderfull! My sister-in-law is a vegetarian and we wanted to have a hearty dish for her at Christmas dinner so I made this quiche and added steamed asperagus to the top in a spoke pattern.  It turned out spectacular and my sister-in-law was not the only one to enjoy it!!

Delicious! Huge hit at my house. I agree that there is a little more liquid that settles on the top from the fresh vegetables and may make you think it's undercooked in the middle. It absorbs quickly once you take it out of the oven.

The quiche had very little flavor.  I added everything it said to for some reason, this quiche did not work out for me.  I'm used to making quiche with anything and having the flavor come through.

Unexpectedly and surprisingly delicious ! I used 4 eggs instead of 5,and it still turned out fine. I guess curry powder and cinnamon do magic on this dish. Would make this again. Great !

This was delicious!  I was skeptical about putting cinnamon in it but I did it anyway.  I used red peppers instead of green and also added some leeks.  I only used 4 eggs.  I think I will add more veggies next time and maybe a tad bit more curry powder.

Definitely one of my favorite recipes on this site.  I love the touch of curry, it is definitely what pushes this up to 5 stars. I pie shells I use are unable to accommodate all 5 eggs so I only use three.

Served this for a luncheon with the broccoli salad and it was a big hit. Used red peppers instead of green and it gave it good color.  Liked that it was not full of cheese- just a little parm.

This quiche was wonderful.  I served it with a field green salad dressed with balsalmic vinegrette, and my husband went back for more!
