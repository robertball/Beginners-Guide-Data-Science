This was good but I took it one step further. I put some heavy cream in a blender and whipped until fairly thick, then added the Irish cream & whiskey to it. Chilled for about an hour and had a nice adult milk shake with it! It was totally awesome! Try it both ways!

I made this for my husband and he really enjoyed it! I used the Homemade Irish Cream from this site and Jack Daniel's whiskey. He asked for another one, so I'd say that t's a good thing! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a favorite drink. I make it with 40 creek cream and 40 creek copper pot whiskey. Delicious!

Yes, the submitter is right, this IS wonderful - and very smooth! Since it it snowed all day and I shoveled, it was a soothing treat!
