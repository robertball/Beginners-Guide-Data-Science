I added 1/2 t of cinnamon to the flour (based on a previous review).  The flavor was perfect.  I had a hard time rolling out the dough - probably not cold enough.  Things got a little gooey, but they baked up fine.  Was surprised at how wide they spread out on the cookie sheet, so I adjusted the size for subsequent batches.  We get these at a bakery in Southern Ontario while on vacation.  Can't find them in NJ.  My homemade ones were just as delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Omg. These take me back to my parents bake shop.  Made them a week ago and they are gone!  Will be making more this week. Easy to make and so tasty.

I found this recipe easy to work with. I added vanilla to the dates and cookie dough. I cut out round 3.3 inch cookies. I used a cap from a juice carton to remove a circle from the center of half the cookies, then placed the date filling on the other cookies and placed the cookies with the donut hole  on top of the  cookie with the filling.

I'll make it again but with some small changes.  I think it would have a fuller flavour with a little cinnamon in the dough and some honey in the date mixture.
