I'm in the process of making these burgers now and just wanted to get something cleared up. Most everyone knows that the juiciest burgers come from ground beef that has a higher fat content. If you use lean beef, you're gonna get "meatloaf". 80% lean and 20% fat content is pretty much the standard. What percentage of fat do you use in your recipe? thanks, (they smell really good). I'm grilling them on a Foreman grill which are known for draining off the fat (and the moisture)from most meats.I'm waiting...waiting...
I'm amazed,I watched the juices flowing out of the burgers and into the tray and thought "here we go again...hot and  dry ground beef on a bun. For not the first time in my life, I was wrong.
A very pleasant juicy burger. I wonder which ingredient or combination thereof keeps the juices in? A definite keeper, thank you.

These burgers are meatballs or meatloaf in burger shape and grilled. If a tasty, juicy burger is what you're looking for, try this:  Add 1 tbs of Olive Oil to one pound of ground beef (I use chuck). Then add 1 tbs Worcestershire, 1 tsp each of garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper to taste. Mix well. Add or subtract any spices you like, but make sure you use 1 tbs each of Olive Oil & Worcestershire per pound of ground beef and you will have the tastiest, juiciest burgers you've ever had!

Excellent!!  So good!  I prepared them the same way I make my meatballs....soak the bread in the milk until it is soggy (about 5 min) add add to ground beef, and use only the YOLK of the egg (the whites only add water-- the yolk has the protein to help 'glue' it all together).  Wonderful...thanks for sharing!

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who don't like bread crumbs in their burgers, I find that the store bought bread crumbs change the taste and texture of the burgers and not for the better.  To get around this problem I use 1 to 1 1/2 slice of bread for every pound of meat and drizzle the bread with just enough milk to get it moist, I think its about 2 tbsp of milk.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same and the burgers turned out really moist and had good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making burgers like this for years, minus the cayenne.  Sometimes I add a 1/4 cup of minced onion to the mix.  I've even found that I can mix these up, shape into patties, and freeze them raw just like this, on a cookie sheet.  When they're frozen solid, I toss 'em in a ziplog bag and keep them in the freezer for up to six months.  When I want a burger on a rainy day, a wintry day, or just one at a time, I mist a frying pan with cooking spray and cook about 7 minutes per side.  They come out just as good as when they're freshly made!

I made these yesterday for a barbeque that we had, every single guest told me how great the hamburgers were. I used 3 lbs of ground beef and adjusted the recipe accordingly also had to use seasoned bread crumbs because thats what I had on hand. Definely a keeper! Thanks :)

This recipe was quite good and juicy.  I tried this for the first time on my in-laws and they loved the burgers.  I used garlic powder instead of minced gloves and sauted onions for some extra flavor and the taste was wonderful.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe came out GREAT!  I actually cooked them on my George Forman Grill because it's still too cold to cook outside.  The only thing is that they came out kind of smaller than I expected so maybe I'll add more ground beef next time.  It was a hit in my house!  Thanks!

The secret to a juicy juicy burger is locking the juices in.  That means heating the pan or grill to high and dropping a room temp raw burger into the pan or onto the grill to get a crust on the burger as quickly as possible.  Cook for 4 min each side for med rare, 4-1/2 to 5 min for med, etc.  If you want to get it juicier you can use such things as butter, cheeses, milk, cream, etc.   Season as you please.  I love garlic, rosemary, minced onion, salt, fresh ground black pepper and butter in my burgers but I love playing with all kinds of ingredients.

These are definitely very juicy, and we have made them twice.  I will keep this recipe for now...I am always on the lookout for a better burger recipe.  These burgers do not knock your socks off taste-wise but they do beat a plain burger.  Next time I plan to increase the worcestershire sauce for more flavor.

Awesome! These really were juicy!! I read where everyone complained they lacked flavor. I added some Grill Mates Hamburger Seasoning to ours and flavor wasn't even an issue. For those that complain about too much leftover evaporated milk, just freeze the rest in an ice cube tray. When frozen, pop them all in a ziplock bag for later use. Each is about a TBSP.

Wow, these burgers were VERY juicy, even though I used very low fat meat (96/4).  Everyone liked them, and my son said they remind him of meatloaf.  Will make again.

These were so delicious.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I crushed seasoned Kashi whole wheat crackers instead.  I also used only the egg yolk as many other reviewers did.  I don't know if it made a difference, really.  Also, I added SALT!  I don't know if it was left out of the recipe on purpose, but I couldn't imagine making a hamburger without salt!  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.  The end result was super-juicy and extremely tasty.  I'll be making these again!  Note: make sure that your garlic is chopped finely enough!  I got a chunk of it in my burger - made it a little strong.  PS. - they were not meatloaf-y at ALL!  I despise meatloaf!

I have to say that I am a skeptic about hamburger recipes. I have had the belief that a hamburger is a hamburger. Well, I was wrong! This is a great base for a hamburger! Very juicy! I used fresh bread crumbs,egg yolk, worchestershire, 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke and I grated about 3/4 of a large onion,evaporated milk, salt, pepper, garlic powder....yumm, yumm. It was great. I would have never thought these simple additions would make such a great hamburger. I even used my indoor grill. Just don't use the extra lean ground beef. That always makes a dry burger.

I love these burgers!  I have been making them all summer & everyone always compliments me on how juicey they are!  I use milk and I add a TBSP of Emeril's Burger Bam Seasoning.  To switch it up I've added sauteed onions to a batch & diced up jalepenos to another batch.  I double the recipe then wrap each burger in press & seal then put them in a freezer bag.  Whenever we feel like having a burger, they are ready to go right from the freezer!  I am so happy I didn't have to spend the money for a box of burgers that turn into hockey pucks on the grill.  These are juicey every time! :-)

I tried this in spite of the "tastes like meatloaf" reviews and my thinking "looks like a meatloaf recipe."  My husband thought it sounded great, and said he didn't get the difference between meatloaf and hamburgers other than the shape.

I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes like meatloaf - and even my husband had an AH HA moment when he tasted these. 

It's not so much the seasoning - but the consistency. Yes these are tender and moist. But to me, "juicy" in a hamburger comes from beef fat and (sorry to be indelicate) but beef blood - that's what juicy is. 

The milk, egg and bread crumbs make this soft and moist - but NOT JUICY. 

Finally having to work the ingredients into the meat immediately means you're working the meat more than I think is called for in a good hamburger.  You're actually toughening the meat up by mixing the ingredients in and yes, the ingredients soften it up - but why not just not work the meat that much and let the natural juiciness come out?

I'd rather put in minimal ingredients, work the meat minimally (break off a chunk and lightly shape it) and then add seasonings during or after grilling - that's natural juiciness.

This recipe greatly improved our hamburgers.  They are now very juicy and delectable.  I was a little apprehensive about trying these because of the "meatloaf on a bun" review.  I didn't find these to be meatloaf-like at all!  The recipe  could possibly use some of your favorite spices, but you will be surprised how the few ingredients in this recipe can turn your ground beef into your new favorite, juicy burgers!

This is the way I have made them for  quite awhile and the burgers are always juicey and delicious.  I do one thing differently, instead of bread crumb I use uncooked oats.

This is a great recipe, made this twice now.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was so juicy (except used regular organic milk).  Second time made it with reg milk again, and instead of breadcrumbs, used quick oats (healthy stuff), added some garlic powder and a dash of black pepper.  YUM.  My 4 yr old ate it both times, and hubby loves it too, it's a keeper.  Next time I'll try to make it with ground turkey instead of beef.  Tasty.  **UPDATE**  Been making this recipe since I found it on the web.  Hubby prefers this way instead of buying frozen patties.  I just buy a bulk of grd beef (mix in a little turkey) and make a bunch of homemade patties to freeze. He loves them this way. **UPDATE 12/3/08** It's better when you use fresh garlic cloves instead of the jarred ones.  Hubby did notice the difference.  I finely ground the oatmeal to resemble bread crumbs.  Last time I didn't, DH noticed that it was "healthy".  Oops. So now he doesn't know and we're all eating a bit healthier.

Fantastic!  Had only 1lb burger so I used whole egg instead of 3/4 (what!).  Wasn't sure I cooked it right because I NEVER had a burger that tasted like this.  It totally melted in my mouth.  What have I been missing all these years.  Didn't know hamburger could taste this good.

Very good burger! Made these for a family cook out recently and everyone really enjoyed them. I used regular milk instead of evaporated but otherwise followed ingredients/instructions.

Followed thie recipe pretty closely, I omitted the garlic and cayenne pepper, just doesn't go in a burger for me.From the reviews of it being bland I added a shake or two of Old Bay seasoning and a shake of Braggs  seasonings. WOW! First of all after I threw them on the grill and let the first side cook for about 5 minutes I opened the lid and there was a pool of juice on the burger. Yum! Finished them off, threw on some cheese and some grilled onions and this turned out to be ONE OF THE MOST FLAVORFUL BURGERS I'VE EVER HAD! Go Figure! Thanks for the recipe.

In my opinion, this is a recipe for grilled meatloaf patties.  They're delicious

I seriously doubt that I will make these burgers again.  It was basically a meatloaf sandwich.

The bread crumbs in this recipe threw the taste of a true burger off for me. In fact, this recipe was more true to a meatloaf.  They weren't bad by any means, but not especially outstanding either.  The search for the perfect burger continues!  Thank you Jane for the submission.

These were juicy burgers, but none of us liked the texture or the flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but felt it tasted more like a meatball than a burger.  I think it was the egg, bread crumbs and fresh garlic that made it taste so much like a meatball.  I will use my regular recipe for burgers in the future... just ground meat formed into patties and sprinkled with salt and pepper.

Ok, first off I used lean turkey meat and I followed the recommendations of others to use 1T Sour Cream and 2T regular milk instead of the Evaporated milk. Everything else was as written in recipe and WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!! Man, party in your mouth. THis is my new fave burger and I am not even a turkey burger lover. (I used turkey for the guests I was serving) Top this with a slice of Havarti or other white cheese and toast your buns on the grill. This is going in the forever box! Juicy, so juicy I did not think it would hold up well on the grill, but it did.  Cook turkey burgers slow, helps them stay moist. Turkey does not tolerate a hot fast sear like beef does. Mmmmmm I am still full and just talking about it makes my mouth water for leftovers tomorrow. Thanks for the simple yet surprisingly yummy recipe. *Does not taste like meatloaf at all, in my opinion.

OK, first I will apologize as I did Not make it as is, but made some changes based on other reviews, that being used 2 slices of bread with crusts cut off and 2 egg yolks, 2 TB olive oil, 3-4 TB milk (I didn't use evaporated based on other reviews thought it would be fine), and 2 TB barbecue sauce. Used 2 TB Worcestershire. I did use 2 pounds of 90% lean beef, thus the reason I used the olive oil. Here was my only problem, I thought I was adding too much seasoning.Wrong! I was way too light on seasonings. I will definitely add minced or grated or finely chopped onion next time. Will use 2 cloves of garlic, along with garlic powder, onion powder, season salt, salt and pepper. What I will say about the result I got is that they were WAY better than the hockey pucks that generally come off the grill. My husband just said "whoa" as a slew of juice came out of his 2nd burger! I may increase olive oil or milk next time. All I know is that this is definitely worth trying, adjust to your taste, season at will and enjoy. The 2 pounds made 6 large 3/4 inch thick burgers that completely filled the buttered toasted buns. I put in my indentation (thank you), and cooked them for 4 minutes each side, then added cheese, covered with foil, counted to 30 and turned off the heat and removed them to rest while I toasted the buns. Burgers generally have been a turn off for me as I have a real problem with stomach aches from dry meats, esp. beef. I actually look forward to our next try.

Too much 'filler' for our taste.  We didn't care for the flavor/texture the bread crumbs and eggs gave the burgers.  For supper juicy burgers without compromising the texture, try grating some onion into the ground beef and adding a few splashes of V8.

Pretty good "no frills" burger! My hubs is always joking with me because I never want plain burgers (I like interesting ones...). Although not 100% "plain," these were a happy compromise we could both agree on. And while not the juciest burger I've ever had, these were quite moist nonetheless. I think I'll continue my search for the perfect burger, but in the meantime, this will do. Served on seeded kaiser rolls, topped with applewood smoked bacon, Tilamook cheddar, lettuce, tomato, sweet onion & katsup / mustard. Kettle chips and root beer floats completed our fun meal! Thanks for sharing, Jane! :-)

as suggested by other reviewers, I used bread slices soaked in milk. I used 1 lb ground beef, 2 slices bread. Turned out great. I added onion. I sauted the onion first on a pan until slightly charred then mix it with the other ingredients. Just personal preference with the onion. Used it on slider buns and made patties smaller. Hubby, 5 and 7 yr old boys liked it. Made it 2 weeks ago, will be making it again later today.

These burgers were delicious!!! Made them for dinner and my entire family was complimenting me for great hamburgers.  Followed recipe as is just added some garlic salt too.  I was a bit skeptical about using evaporated milk but glad I did.  Something about all the ingredients together makes the best  burgers ever.  Making again tomorrow(per family's request) LOL

i love this recipe. i altered it a little bit by using regular milk, and seasoned bread crumbs. truthfully, i think its the milk that makes the hamburger so juicy. after i grilled these hamburgers on my charcoal grill, i thought they looked a little dry from the smoking and maybe a little over done. but they were so juicy that my girlfriend didn't think they were done. so i turned on the light, and showed her the middle of the burgers, and they were not even pink! they were fully cooked, and as juicy and a medium hamburger! i also used a few of my own spices to make it a little bit more bold. NOTE:Switch the amount of milk and Worcestershire...3TBS Worcestershire, 2 TBS of milk...

I don't care for "meatloaf" add-ins to my burgers.  I agree with CookinLovin: "These burgers are meatballs or meatloaf in burger shape and grilled. If a tasty, juicy burger is what you're looking for, try this: Add 1 tbs of Olive Oil to one pound of ground beef (I use chuck). Then add 1 tbs Worcestershire, 1 tsp each of garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper to taste. Mix well. Add or subtract any spices you like, but make sure you use 1 tbs each of Olive Oil & Worcestershire per pound of ground beef and you will have the tastiest, juiciest burgers you've ever had!"
Instead of garlic & onion powders, though, I use fresh grated using my zester/rasper; since the add-ins keep great moisture in the meat, I usually use a tad less Worcestershire, as I don't want "wooster sauce" to be the dominant flavor.  YUM!

I prepped these burgers and then headed to the lake for a few hours when I came back hubby had grilled these up and said "Those were great burgers and really Juicy" LOL so I guess they passed the test. Even my cold burger was still juicy. Great recipe! I used 3 lbs ground beef, 2 egg yolks, 3 handfuls of Italian bread crumbs, 1/4 c milk,3 T Worcestershire, 3 cloves garlic 1 T onion powder. They were just the burger I was hoping for.

These are really tasty and juicy!  I've made these many times now. This is my go-to recipe for hamburgers.  I have substituted whole milk for the evaporated milk and have not really noticed a difference in how they turn out.

These were really good - I cut the recipe down to 4 burgers but still used the full egg. Very juicy and moist. Hubby liked them even after putting up a fuss about "changing regular burgers" :)

I served this for my daughter's first birthday.  Her aunt, (my sister) was there and said "that burger is sooooo good!"  It was very juicy and full of flavour; not at all like "meatloaf" like other reviewers have said. I did not do anything to stray from the recipe other than eyeballing the worcheshire meaasurement because I was too lazy to get a measuring spoon.  Besides, we like worcheshire sauce.... so... I might have added more.  I was concerned that one of the batches I made would fall apart because it seemed so "wet" when I made the patties.  However, it held together fine.  I did put the burgers into the fridge for 14 hours before grilling... (I made the patties in advance to save time the next day... it wasn't done intentially to enhance anything).

These were indeed very juicy.  I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  I had no problem with them falling apart (as I usually do with other burgers).  I was a little afraid they would taste 'meatloafy' since they had breadcrumbs in them, but they didn't.  A nice flavor of a good ole' american hamburger.  Nothing fancy, just pure goodness!

These burgers definitely are THE moistest, juiciest I have ever made (must be the evaporated milk?). My grill tends to quickly turn everything to a hockey puck, so I needed something up to the challenge, and these delivered. 

Based on feedback from other testers, I did make some changes - for 4lbs of beef, I added about 1/3 cup of FRESH bread crumbs (food processed a stale hamburger bun), 2 egg yolks only, 2 TBS dried parsley flakes for color (fresh too pungent), and about 3/4 cup of finely minced onion for extra moisture. They got rave reviews at my labor day bbq and were not at all meatloaf-y! 

Only other change I will make next time is to really amp up the seasonings. They somehow get lost in this recipe.

This recipe is awesome but with these changes: paprika instead of cayenne and some garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder. Italian bread crumbs. regular whole milk instead of condensed. With this, the burgers were awesome!!! We couldn't wait for them to get done... they smelled so good and tasted even better!

I made these burgers with the original recipe the first time and they were good, but needed salt. The second time I made them I cut the recipe in half, omitted the cayenne (not everyone wanted it),added 1/2 tsp of salt, shook in some garlic powder, and added liquid hickory smoke. I also used real bread crumbs that I keep in the freezer.( I food process heals of bread and toss in freezer. These are great for burgers and meatloaf. Keeps the meat moist, unlike dry breadcrumbs!) I used lean ground beef, so I added a little canola oil when mixing the beef. I also used skim milk. I give the original recipe (that I did try because I don't believe in rating a recipe if you don't use the original submitted recipe) 4 stars. Good base recipe, but as with all recipes, we can adjust to our own taste :)

Although I tweaked the recipe a little as far as seasoning, I followed the recipe. The burgers were juicy...unfortunately it is a little meatloafy and I did not care for the mushy texture.

I made this tonight and it was pretty good!  I didn't use as much as much breadcrumb as the recipe called for...only 1/2 a cup.  I was worried about some of the complaints of the "meatloaf" texture.  Everything else stayed the same tho.  Maybe an extra pinch of salt.

To add it up a notch try using one slice of white bread, with crust removed, and bread diced into 1/2" cubes.  This is good for 11/2lbs of meat.  Add 2Tbs of reg.milk, mash together. It forms a paste, the add S&P, a crushed clove of garlic, (use garlic press),and add 2 Tsp A-1 sauce.  Mix it up, works best if you use your hands and evenly mix in the bread paste mixture.  Divide into fourths, shape, press and flatten burgers with your hands.  Place on tray and then make a divet in the centre of each burger.  This stops the burger from puffing up during grilling.  Cook 4 mins on each side.  If you add a slice of cheese, in the last minute of cooking, place the cheese on top of the pattie, and use a foil pie tin or something like that to cover the pattie.  Cook for a minute and the cheese will be bubbly and slightly golden. Always preheat/toast a nice soft bun and you'll see how juicy and tasty this turns out to be.  Add your own fixings. It's so yummy!

These burgers are really great.  I own a restaurant and made these burgers to sell. These burgers are selling like hot cakes, my customers comment on how much they love my new hamburgers.  I do them many different ways, quarter pounders, stuffed half pounders, also use sliced smoked back bacon on them.  Word has gotten around, can't believe how my sales have grown because of these burgers.  Thank You

These were tender, juicy and flovorful. I only had 1 lb of ground chuck and We didn't have bread crumbs and evaporated milk, so I soaked 1 slice of bread in milk until soggy, mushed it up with a fork, and used that. We added some steak seasoning like we usually put on steaks. Cooked on george foreman grill. Made 4 burgers with excellent flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This was actually really easy and really good.  I cut the recipe in half, but I still used the whole egg.  It was easy to make, and really fun to eat.  I also didn't used cayenne pepper, I used Pappy's seasoning, and it was still awesome.

very juicy, but also quite bland.  Next time we make them we'll add more seasoning to it.

These were pretty good. I always make the recipe exactly as written before adding a review so that it will reflect the actual recipe. Having said that... I didn't find them all that juicy. The burgers I usually make are much juicier than this, but the flavour was pretty good. I think there was far too much garlic. Once clove would have been plenty. Next time I would omit the breadcrumbs to make them juicier and go light on the garlic.

I fix my burgers like this.  But I use the Italian bread crumbs and they come out moist and absolutely delicious!  I gave the recipe 5 stars, but I'd have to change it to 4-1/2 with plain bread crumbs.

I made a huge batch of these due to having lots of ground beef.  I also used 2% milk and it worked well.  I had enough left over and made a meatloaf which was also delicious.  The meat holds together well - especially if you pack it down hard.  This has become my primary burger recipe.

Excellent! My boyfriend (who is very picky and knows good food) said it was the best burger he's tasted. I used Aberdeen Angus beef which helped as well.

with a little over 3 pounds of ground beef, I added a cup of bread crumbs. I also used regular milk and about a quarter cup of oil plus chopped onions and cilantro, salt and pepper. IT WAS BANGIN.

Pretty good. I use 1lb ground beef, 1 egg, 1/4c and 2 tbl dry bread crumbs, 1/8 t cayenne, 1 garlic, (all of that the same as reducing the recipe for 4 servings) but, I change the rest to 1 tbl reg milk, 1 1/2 tea worcestershire sauce, and 1 tbl hickory bbq sauce.  The first time I made the recipe as written and it was just too much worcestershire sauce for my taste. Took some of the second batch of burgers with the changes to my husbands golf buddies and they raved saying best they ever had!! Thanks!!

I didn't use the cayenne, worcestershire sauce. I used regular milk instead of evaporated.  They were very good!  I used seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and McCormick grill mates- Montreal steak seasoning.

I used 80% lean, 20% fat ground beef and it came out perfect. The first time I tried this recipe, I used 93% lean, 7% fat and it came out like meatloafy texture. A piece of bread soaked in a few drops of milk instead of dry bread crumbs. Squeeze the bread gently to get rid of excessive milk (regular milk is perfectly fine) before you put it in the meat mixture. I also added a tiny pinch of garlic powder and grated half of an onion. Onion powder would work too I suppose. I just think the juice from onion gives more flavor. Cooked it on a skillet for about 5-6 minutes on each side. So heavenly juicy. I will never look for another hamburger recipe. Thank you Jane!

Fantastic!!!!!!  Follow meat recipe just as written. We use Buffalo burger when we make  burgers. While on the barbeque, we topped the burger with slices of Horseradish Cheddar cheese and red onion and heated until cheese melted. At the same time spread butter on bun and toast the bun on the barbeque.  This is an easy fantastic recipe!!!! 3rd time making this recipe and WOW it is always a hit!!!!!!!

This was very definitely moist and juicy but the flavor was off.  I think I'll reduce the bread crumbs next time or try crackers instead, the breadcrumb taste is over powering the ground beef.  Recipe worth keeping but needs some tinkering with.

I made these last night and they were delicious! I used 1 lb deer burger and 1 lb 80% ground beef (bec. that is what I had on hand). I added only the egg yolk as another reviewer mentioned and a slice and a half of torn up stale bread. They turned out perfect. I added just a sprinkling of salt and pepper to each patty before putting them on the grill. Will definitely make these again!

The burgers fell apart, had to nearly burn them just to be able to turn them on the grill. The taste was OK. Not worth the frustration of having the burgers fall apart.

We really like the flavor of these burgers, the only thing I have found with them is they fall apart during cooking.  I think when I make again I will add an extra egg.

I absolutely did not like this recipe. It had such a weird taste, perhaps from the evaporated milk. My husband and my father weren't impressed either.

I just made this for dinner tonight using one pound of beef so i cut everything else in half. It was juicy, hearty and filling. My boyfriend who never gets excited about anything I make loved this. I used ritz crackers cause i was out of bread. I had roasted garlic cloves in a jar so I used 2 of thoose. I used 3 reviewers suggestions. 
1) Dont have evaporated milk  then substitute w/ 1tblsp sour cream & 2 tblsp milk per 2 pounds beef. 
2) make thin patties and place cheese in middle and seal on edges (mmm i used velveeta dont press down hard on burgers or chz will come out).
3)Last but not least only use the yolk of the egg because the whites will just add water. My burgers had perfect texture.
I cooked theese on low heat on the stove covering occasionaly and only flipping twice. I always use butter and a touch of garlic butter and toast buns on stove top. Great recipe. Ill never make a plain burger again.

Pretty good and tasty burgers!  They really were moist on the inside.  I omitted the cayenne pepper (much too spicy for me) and it was kind of bland.  Next time I'll add some seasoning to it before I cook them in place of the cayenne.

I made these the other day and didn't alter the recipe in any way.  The burgers came out great!  I made .5lb burgers and cooked them on a Foreman grill.  After I formed the burgers I pressed my finger through the center so they didn't turn into balls when cooking.  The burgers I didn't use I froze for another time.  I will continue to use this recipe in the future.  They were juicy and delicious!

I am currently shoving my face with the burgers.  THEY ARE SO GOOD OH MY GOODNESS.  haha.
I'm a college student, living on my own- so this easy, simple recipe was absolutely perfect!
I rarely ever give recipes feedback, but I actually joined this website,  just to review them. I did make two changes though- I used regular milk (instead of evaporated milk- because I forgot to get it at the grocery store) and I added a full onion to the meat mixture.  
This recipe is so incredible! I'll definitely be making it again!

"Juiciest Grilled MEATLOAF PATTIES Ever". As hamburgers, the flavor was off. They were juicy, but they tasted more like meatloaf than hamburgers. They were good in their own right and would make a great meatloaf.

This recipe is brilliant! Just like few of the commenters I used 3 slices of bread. But instead of soaking them in milk, I buzzed them up in my food processor for 5 seconds. Another thing I did, just like a few others, I used just the egg yolk and not an entire egg. Egg white really does add water to the meat, which in turn can cause the "meatloaf effect". However, a very important note is that the recipe calls for no salt. As most chefs know, adding salt to the meat during mixing all the ingredients can prove to be disastrous, as salt soaks up moisture. Therefore, right before placing the patties on the grill, I generously seasoned both the sides of each patty with salt and pepper. In result, they turned out perfectly seasoned, and insanely juicy! This is not "one-of-the", this recipe IS the best burger I have ever made!

Very tasty, even with 93% grass-fed ground sirloin and almond milk instead of evaporated milk.  Easy to make. I will definitely make again.

Went with some reviewer suggestions, and these turned out fantastic! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used whole, and I tore the flesh out of some day-old French bread instead of the bread crumbs. Got the bread soggy, but not sopping, and added 1tbs Worchester and 1tbs olive oil per lb of meat. I also used yolks only. here in sunny san diego we have a burger truck that sells burgers with the cheese stuffed inside, and they are TO DIE FOR, so I made food-truck-inspired super-thin patties and stuck 1/3 slick of cheddar in between 2 patties and mushed the sides together. Served with fresh veggies on toasted buns. AMAZING!!!

I didn't have bread crumbs or evaporated milk so I used ritz crackers , 2% milk and a spoonful of nonfat plain yogurt.  These were perfect.

Delicious!!! Very moist. My husband said best burgers ever! I did add 2Tbsp dehydrated onion to the mix, and used crushed up saltines in place of bread crumbs, as I didn't have any on hand.

I have made a lot of hamburgers over the years and have never used a recipe.  I saw this one and thought I would give it a try.  Well let me tell you, it was the most juiciest delicious burger I have had in a long time.  I did make a few changes for lack of ingredients.  I used 2% milk instead of evaporated milk (that is what I had) and I left out the cayenne pepper and just sprinkled black pepper on after grilling.  I made extra and froze them into patties, so next time I just have to pop them out of the freezer.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These burgers were okay... they were juicy, but over all the flavor was just okay. Nothing to brag about. I thought the patties tasted a little fluffy I guess, maybe as a result of the breadcrumbs? I'm going to look for another recipe for next time.

Outstanding recipe!  Best burger recipe I've found.  I had to substitute regular milk for evaporated and was concerned that I had only lean ground beef but they were really, really good - juicy and flavourful and not overwhelmed by spice.  They tasted like real burgers.  Highly recommend!

I hate to write a bad review, but I do have to say, I did not like this at all. Not sure what happened or perhaps I did something wrong. I used regular milk like other reviewers and since I didn't have cayenne pepper, I decided to brush some hot sauce on the burgers while grilling. These came out rather dry and tasteless. I used 85/15 ground beef thinking that would make for juicier burgers, but this was simply dry and bland. I normally use 93/7 beef with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce, and those turn out much more tasty and juicy than this recipe did. I'll keep searching for different recipes, as I will probably not be making this again.

Was very skeptical reading this but loved the reviews so decided to give it a try.  I too used 1 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce and 1 Tbs. Soy Sauce.  Used flavored panko bread crumbs.  DIdn't have any evaporated milk so substituted fat free half and half.   Didn't baste at all with barbeque sauce but sauteed some mushrooms and onions and served these on top.  This was unbelievable.  I've been making hamburgers for a lot of years and have never had them come out as flavorful or as juicy as this.  Felt like this was a "special" dinner rather than a quick weeknight meal...that's how good they were.  Thank you so much for such a great recipe.

I made these last night and everyone loved them.  They're moist rather than juicy & I think it's the evaporated milk that helps.  It was difficult cooking them, but they didn't fall apart.  (also, they looked a little charred, but turned out fine)  The burgers had plenty of flavor & I would make again.  P.S.  these burgers taste similar to a recipe I had while on the Atkins diet.

Made a double batch and followed the recipe exactly and had rave reviews from everyone that had one.  Used 85/15 ground round.  Very easy recipe and very tasty burgers. I will definitely be using this one again!

***Gluten free/Casein free modifications*** One of my children is on the gfcf diet, so I adapt all receipes for family meals to be gfcf (and truth be told, most of the receipes taste better that way). 1. Substitute Mimic Creme, unsweetened, for the evaporated milk. 2. Substitute Braggs Liquid Animos for the Worcestershire sauce. 3. Substitute any gfcf breadcrumbs for the gluten filled ones! If I use a baking/frying coating, I just use about 1/4 cup of it.  My family LOVES these burgers.  They are full of flavor, smell wonderful while cooking, and are very moist.  They also make wonderful leftovers and are just as tasty the next day.  It's not often that I find a hamburger that tastes good also when reheated.  This receipe ROCKS in our house!

FANTASTIC recipe for burgers!  I didn't have the evaporated milk, so I used Miracle Whip and I added 2 Tbs of Grillmates hamburger seasoning.  I broiled them and they were GREAT!  I've already shared this recipe with all my friends...it will become a "standard" in our home! Thank you!

The burgers were good, but I only give them a 3 because they taste too much like meatballs or meatloaf.  If I want a burger I want it to taste like a burger.

My boyfriend described these as "killer hamburgers" and I would have to agree.  Flavorful and juicy... all around delicious.  And easy too!  Mmm Mmm Good.

These are the absolute best hamburgers you'll ever eat, and they're so moist!  They are even better if you butter the top bun and put mustard on the bottom.  Then put them on the grill to toast them.  They really are great!

This is a great recipe.  I used only the egg yolk as opposed to the whole egg and soaked bread in milk instead of using bread crumbs (per the suggestion of another reviewer).  At our family Memorial Day picnic, everyone wanted burgers & fearing we would not have enough buns, I ate mine plain with no bun ... delicious.

Made very good and juicy burgers but not a new approach.I sprinkled a few drops of liquid smoke on top of each burger before barbecueing,added a little hot sauce to the mixed hamburger, and cut back on the worcestershire sauce. I love juicy hamburgers!!

I was very pleasantly surprised, these burgers were delicious and juicy!  I had to triple the recipe as I was feeding a lot of ppl. I also read several reviews and got some really good tips! Such as 1) bread soaked in whole milk. Not dried breadcrumbs and not evaporated milk. 1/2 slice for every lb of meat and 2 Tbps milk on each slice. 2) 1:1 olive oil to Worcestershire sauce, and 3) no whites, just the yoke.  Everyone loved them and they smelled soooo good.

I had all the ingredients except the worcheshire sauce, I mixed all the ingredients together except the meat and added a little bit more evaporated milk.  I used store bought breath crumbs with Italian herbs and they did good with this recepie. I mixed all the ingredients throughly. Then I added them to the meat and mixed them with my hands to get it all over the meat. I made my patties 3/4 of an inch thick. I have a gas range, so I don't know if the time varies. But mines were well done, in super fast like 3 mins each side.So you have to watch out for that.

If you like meatloaf and want a burger to taste like that, this is the right recipe.  But there is a difference between a juicy burger and a moist burger.  A burger should not really be mushy and this one is.  I could not finish it.

I tried this for the first time today 4/1/14 (I know it's April fools day) because I was in the mood for Hamburgers.  I'm glad that I did! I did try some tips from others about the Olive Oil and using regular milk.  I didn't have regular bread crumbs but I did have Kikkoman Panko bread crumbs and used those instead.  Wow no tasteless dried out hamburgers!  I may decrease the milk more because of the Olive Oil or leave it out all together. Will be adding this to my recipe box and the only other tip I would suggest is making sure you make the middle of your hamburgers lower than the edges so you don't have raw middles as the middle of your hamburger always "plumps up" while it cooks and the hamburger will cook more evenly.

I tried this with a food processed wholewheat bread slice as another reviewer suggested instead of shop bought breadcrumbs and the three of us were delighted how scrummy they tasted, and so moist. Ignore the negative reviews, try it yourself, cook it over a hot grill as suggested 5 mins on each side and make your own mind up.  We're not going to freeze the remaining burgers but have them tomorrow instead and I rarely eat them!

It was nice and it was moist, but it didn't have any real flavor and I added onion,  doubled the worcestershire and the cayenne. I used Italian bread crumbs and I wish I hadn't because it left me with the impression of meatloaf.  I think if I had gone with the plain bread I wouldn't have been reminded of meatloaf.  I would recommend this to someone who isn't used to highly flavored spicy foods.  I will use this one again, but I'm going to have to play with it because I need more flavor.

I wanted to make my own juicy hamburger patties and found this recipe. I followed "GAELYN"s advice so used the bread instead of bread crumbs. They were so juicy and tasty as it described. One thing I would like to change it is I will put a bit more of Worcestershire sauce just to give a bit more flavor. My friends and family love it and all asked for the recipe.

Best. Burgers. EVER. I give it four stars because I made the same adjustments everyone else did while cutting it in half: used half a slice of toasted bread instead of breadcrumbs, soaked in regular skim milk, twice the Worcestershire and used a whole egg yolk. It tasted absolutely nothing like meatloaf and entirely like a hamburger and everyone loved it. I think the added ingredients really helped since I used 27% fat ground beef that rendered out into the grill pretty badly. Without the ingredients, I think too much moisture would have been lost to the charcoals. The bread helped the patties stay together and hold in moisture.

Love these hamburgers and will make them again sometime in the future. I only did one thing different and used regular milk instead of the evaporated kind. The flavor is wonderful and I liked the texture. I think next time I am gonna add some chopped onion and jalapenos in the meat mixture.

These were delish! I did tweak it just a bit. Instead of bread crumbs I used 2 pieces of bread. I even had some mix leftover so I made patties and froze them. When I cooked the frozen burgers later they still tasted wonderful. I don't think I will be buying frozen hamburger patties again!

My wife says these are possibly the best burgers she's ever had! I replaced the milk, Worcestershire and cayenne pepper with 1/4 cup of our favourite barbecue sauce (President's Choice Smokin' Habanero). I also added a tablespoon of dried minced onion, though next time I'd probably use fresh onion. Moist and flavourful - spectacular!

I didn't like the flavor at all. I honestly think that by sprinkling worcestershire over a hamburger while it is cooking will give you the same flavor, maybe better.

We had this tonight and I won't say it was bad, but it was not great.  The flavor was okay, but the texture of this is practically meatloaf.  It's mushy with too many bread crumbs.

I have a hard time getting my kids to eat hamburgers and I tried this recipe and my oldest was the first one done with the whole cheeseburger. I don't know what it is, but the combination of the ingredients works. I do use bread soaked in milk though. I always feel like bread crumbs and crackers tend to dry things out and I was afraid of that happening again.

Cooked these for a little Sunday night grilling.  They were good, I think I would add a little more spice to them...little extra garlic, little extra hot sauce

AMAZING burgers! Indeed the juiciest we ever had. I usually doctor recipes but I went exactly with this one. The burgers were crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Perfect for my father who loves his burgers well done but has trouble chewing. Will be using this recipe again!

I did not use the egg, not sure why there is evaporated milk in it, and why I needed to open a can to get out two tablespoons seems like a waste to me. I used whole milk and thought it was good and moist. To get more flavor I added some "better than bullion" beef base. my version I would give 5 stars.

These were very good.  I put in a little less of the bread crumbs and I used regular milk.  I also didn't put in the egg white like others suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

The only burgers my husband can't destroy on the BBQ. They are still moist and juicy when "well done". I halved the breadcrumbs and they were perfect. I imagine they would be quite "meatloafy" if you used the full amount. I also used regular milk. Worked out great!

Delicious!  Based on reading reviews, I used one egg yolk instead of a whole egg and I used a piece of bread (wheat) instead of the bread crumbs.  Rave reviews from my husband and inlaws.  The 2 yr old and 10 month old ate theirs very well too.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I rarely make burgers b/c they always turn out like crud.  Not these though!  They were perfect.  Very juicy and flavorful.  I used half and half instead of evaporated milk b/c that's what I had.

This was a great recipe.  I made mine in the George Forman grill and it came out juicy and delish.  I did change some things.  I added liquid smoke and I used the bread soak in milk and crumble method in place of the evap. milk and bread crumbs.  Will def. make this again. : )

Very good!!!  Instead of 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce...I did 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp soya sauce.  I grilled the burgers on the bbq flipping every three minutes for a total of 9 minutes...brushed both sides with bbq sauce...set them on the top rack placed sauted mushrooms and onions on top of them then a slice of swiss cheese.  Turned the heat down to the lowest setting for about a minute (till the cheese melts to hold the mushrooms/onions on), meanwhile in the house I had all the toppings ready (bacon, sliced dill pickles, tomatoes)!!  They were so good...and very filling...hubby couldn't finish his second one!  Great recipe!!!

These hamburgers were very juicy and were great. The only thing i would change is maybe a little more spices next time. We tend to like our burgers with taste and these really didn't have much. They were juicy but just didn't have much flavor.

We made this last night for a dinner party for some high quality beef and everyone raved about how juicy the burgers were.  I would definitely recommend for lean, high quality meat - I did use just the regular 8 serving recipe for 3 lbs of meat and it was plenty.

Excellent simple recipe overall.  Takes no time at all.  One person said that it didn't knock their socks off.  I think you can afford to either increase the Worcestershire sauce, or toss in some herbs or dried mustard.  I prepared this with a blend of Oregano, Tarragon and Marjoram.  The overall affect of the bread crumbs and egg, which I would have only tried in meatloaf, gave it a nice texture when cooked and did keep it juicy.

Made these for a cookout and everyone loved them!  I used panko and soaked it in the evaporated milk before mixing it in.  I also used 2 yolks instead of one egg.  Worked great!  They held together and had a good taste.

This WAS the juiciest hamburger ever.  It tasted AMAZING the first time I made them- I didn't have any dry bread crumbs so I crumbled in some sliced wheat bread.  The second time I made them, I used dry bread crumbs and they were not the juiciest or most delicious =(.  I definitely recommend not using dry bread crumbs for these.

These smelled so good, but when we ate them they just were no good. Maybe I did some thing wrong, but they were just not good.

I had 2 lbs. of ground beef to do burgers AND this recipe for guests who had to cancel at the last minute. I made only 2 burgers for hubby and me and with the remaining meat I made meatballs and baked them til done. Carmelized some onion, added green peppers and mushrooms, saute'd and spooned into buns and topped with my homemade marinara sauce for one of the best meatball subs I think we've ever had.  THIS is a keeper.  I cubed the bread crumbs, added the evap. milk and mashed with a fork before adding to meat with remaining ingredients. A real two-fer!  Excellent burgers AND meatballs. Thank you!

Absolutely the best hamburger recipe our family has tried.  My ten-year-old son won't eat hamburgers at restaurants anymore because these are so much better.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Made these last night using a George Forman grill, they were very juicy.  However, I felt they needed some type of salt added.

Tastes juicy and received rave reviews, but I found it to be very bland. I'll make again, however, I'll be sure to include a tablespoon of oregano & basil and a teaspoon of salt & pepper to add some needed flavor.

Wonderful and simple!  I made changes based on what I had...1 tsp of jar garlic as I didn' have fresh, chili powder instead of cayenne, normal milk instead of evaporated, and I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon and some basil for an extra kick.  The base recipe is wonderful, I smothered them in marbled cheddar and we loved them!  Thanks!

I am just getting back into cooking..this was my first choice.  I made this tonight using the egg yolk, A1 Bold /Spicy steak sauce and George. MM loved the flavor--said was the most tender and juiciest burger he had ever had.  I had mine without the bun, burger veges only...fantastic. Will make this recipe whenever a burger mood hits us again.

My family loves this burger!  The only change I make is not using Worchesdter Sause and instead use a Teriyaki sauce. Our family likes that taste better.  This is easy to make and does make juicy burgers, even with 85% lean meat.  Go for it...you won't regret this recipe.

These were very good.  They really were nice and moist and I liked the spices just the way they are, but it would be easy to change it up, according to your tastes.  Yum!

I made exactly as stated.  They were very good, juicy and stayed together well. Next time I think I may cut down the bread crumbs the texture kind of reminded me of the school hamburgers where they extended the meat with bread.  Loved the worcestershire and cayenne pepper, great additions.

Delicious burgers! I rarely cook on the grill but this summer have been getting better at it.  Usually my burgers are kind of dry and fall apart, not these.  They were flavorful and very easy to cook. I halved the recipe, used just the egg yolk and used 1 lb ground beef and 1 tbs of cream.

My recipe is very similar to this one. I use saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs and regular milk. You can also add chopped onions and peppers. When burgers are almost done, I drizzle worcestershire sauce in pan and brown slightly. I have tried several hamburger recipes on this sight and found that my original recipe is the best. They are very flavorable and moist. They also stay moist warmed up in the microwave.

Not at all like a meatloaf.  I loved it, I used an egg yolk only, and added some steakhouse seasonings.  I also added paprika, and a dash of hot sauce.  Very good and juicy burger thanks!

These are awesome. With the exception of doubling it, I followed the recipe exactly. Very juicy and delicious. A great go-to recipe for a basic burger that you can spice up to your specific taste. Next time might add a touch more of the milk.

I have never like a hamburger that had bread crumbs in it. Though this recipe had such high ranking I decided to try it. I have to say this is the best tasting one i tried. However it still taste like a meatloaf. I did use a high content hamburger so that wasnt the problem as stated in previous reviews. Howver it is very juicy and something I have found out. The first one i did cook i over cook it becuase it cooks a lot faster than a normal hamburger. however it was still juicy. the other 3 i made i made perfect and really was juicy.

However it was still a meatloaf burger. I really not fond of these style of hamburgers but cant give a terrible rating anyhow. So I will give it a 3 star.

If you like this style of burger, I feel you will think this is a 5 star burger.

Great! Very moist and flavorful. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I just used regular milk. I also didn't have garlic, so I used diced onion.

I defintely prefer a meatier version of hamburgers, without bread crumbs.  Or so I learned after trying these.  I completely agree with other reviewers meatloaf consistency comments.  The mixture is not exactly the consistency of meatloaf, but doesn't provide the meaty texture I appreciate with my burgers.  The taste was different, for a change of pace.

Yum!!  My husband does not have much luck with hamburgers.  We made these with ground chuck and got 8 beautiful burgers!!  If I were to make them with plain old ground beef, I would probably make 6 burgers because they would shrink.  We made them with regular milk and a few more bread crumbs and they were great!  I think we have learned to really work your meat and it will stay together better than working it less.  Thanks!!

I think this is a good start to a hamburger recipe but it definitely needs some more added to it. I added some hot peppers, salt, and some hot spice mix to them. I will make these again.

These hamburgers were soooooo good. My 8 year old daughter even said "Wow these are juicy" and didn't even know they were "supposed" to be. I changed a few things but that is cause I'm constantly adding different spices. I used regular milk cause it is all I had. I also used the simply tasteful garlic instead of the cloves. I added pepper, garlic powder, and seasoning salt for flavor. They were great and I will definately make these again!

They certainly are juicy, but could use a bit more flavor. Next time I am adding some onion soup mix.

We made them for my daughters 2nd birthday - and they were great. I added a package of dry onion soup mix and I think that may have added to the flavour. They were very juicy and good! Thanks

I made these burgers for my family and everyone loved them.  I then passed the recipe to more family and I got the same reaction.  Thanks for the greatest burgers in the world. Thats what I was told so I pass it on to you. Thanks

Just as the name suggests, very juicy burger.  I bumped up the spices and added minced onion for more flavor.  My 12-year-old daughter, an italian meatball fanatic and a very picky meat eater, said that they tasted like the meatballs I make; needless to say I will be making these lots!  Thanks for sharing !!

Made 32 burgers today using this recipe and 6.5 lbs of lean hamburger.  Only thing I added was 2 pkgs of Lipton Onion soup mix.  I had to use 1% milk instead of evaporated as that was all I had, and I used Italian flavoured bread crumbs.  The burgers were scrumptious!  Will definitely save for future use.

Delicious! Very tender. We made them on the grill for the 4th of July and if you’re careful they turn out great, just be gentle with the tongs! Great with Gouda :)

After reading all the tips, I cut the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup, used only the egg yolk, and added 1 T of olive oil.

I agree with others - with all the filling the burger does come out light and juicy - just not.....burgery.  It really lost the beef flavor.  Not that it wasn't tasty - it just didn't taste like a burger.  I would cut the filling in half and try it again.

FYI to make it gluten free use GF oatmeal - works great!

I made these according to the recipe and, although the burgers looked good and were juicy, I did not like the taste. Another reviewer described these as meatloaf or meatballs in hamburger form, and that's about right. The bread crumbs really change the texture. I won't be making these again.

Too light. Add additional steak seasoning. Keep grill at 350-450. Apply cheese on top of meat before removing from grill.

Perfect recipe! I decided to try this and turned out perfect, and it was so easy! This will be my official hamburger recipe from now on, my family loved it, thanks! Just a note: I used black pepper and 2% milk since that was what I had on hand, delicious and juicy!

I used lean meat and it still turned out juicy. Used heavy cream to moisten the bread and also used just the yolk.

This recipe turned out great! I made my own bread crumbs. I made 1 1/2 of the recipe (12 patties) and cut the crust off of 2 slices of wheat bread. I cut them into small pieces and roasted them, stirring frequently, in the oven.

This is the BEST hamburger I've ever had.  Took an advise of another reviewer and replaced the bread crumbs , with 2 sliced of bread soaked in lactose free milk, added minced dried onions.  Served it with caramelized onions!  This is a keeper in my recipe book!

Thank you Jane for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

I pretty much followed the instruction of this recipe

 
Here are the ingredients I used: 
•	 2 pounds ground beef 
•	 1 egg, 
•	 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 
•	 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
•	 1 teaspoon black pepper 
•	 2 cloves garlic, minced 
•	1/2 minced onion

In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, black pepper, minced onion, and minced garlic with my hands. Divide the mixture into 8 servings
Then I put the mixture in the freezer for about 2 hours until it is frozen
And then preheat grill for high heat.
Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill patties 5 minutes per side, or until well done.

I tried a few ways to cook it: 
	Grill, 
	Cook it in the pan,
	Bake it with oven,
However, the patty turned out to be real juicy, but real mushy.  All I am trying to do is to make the hamburger like Harvey’s, juicy and chewy, McDonald’s is chewy, but it is way to dry. Hopefully someone here can give me some hints, so my hamburger will be juicy and chewy like Harvey’s. I would really appreciate it. My Email: chenghaiping@hotmail.com

A house full of folks agreed these lacked flavor and had the consistency of blended corned beef hash. They fell apart on the grill because of the bread crumbs. Keep it simple folks...1 egg per pound of meat and plenty of steak rub (like Montreal by GrillMates). I only tried this because I was looking for something new and different. Swing and miss!

I made these tonight, using my George Foreman grill. 
While I don't agree with reviewers who say these burgers TASTE like meatloaf, I do agree that they FEEL like meatloaf when you're eating them; you don't get that hearty, ground-beef chewiness that you have with a more traditional burger made without bread/bread crumbs. 
These patties cook up very juicy, it's true, but they are also very smooth, for lack of a better word. Certainly there is goodness, especially if you bump up the seasoning to fit your tastes, but definitely not chewiness (I would not call them mushy, though). 
With all that said, my nearly-8-year-old daughter scarfed hers down and declared it was the best burger she's ever eaten, and she asked even before she finished when I was going to make them again. I personally enjoyed the taste, but I would have liked more of a meaty chew. That's just what I expect from a burger. Hubby also commented on the meatloaf-like texture, but had no problems with the taste, and the texture didn't stop him from eating two. 
Overall, it's a successful new recipe for us, and I'll make it again. Perhaps I'll scale back the bread/bread crumbs a bit and see if it makes a difference in the texture.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I did differently was using cream instead of evaporated milk. And I
 added a bit of salt and pepper. Wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe but I substituted oatmeal soaked in milk for the breadcrumbs (chef Micheal Smith's meatloaf recipe) plus a nice thick slice of peameal bacon topped with cheddar and red onion.I also put a couple spoon fulls of Willies chilli sauce in with the burger mix for more moisture

Absolutely delicious!  The key is 80/20 ground beef or yes, you'll get meatloaf.  We have made with both evaporated and regular milk, and didn't notice a difference.  Freezes well (raw, with wax paper in between layers).  My go-to burger recipe!

I made these burgers last night.  I am married to the grumpiest man in the world; he never tells me anything about what I've cooked.  He said they were juicy and good.  Imagine that!  I'd rate it at least a 5-star+.  I didn't have access to a grill so I pan fried them on medium-low heat and they were still awesome!  Thank you for sharing.  MsWyla

I add dry onion soup mix in addition to the bread crumbs and Worcestershire sauce.  It adds to keeping the burger together and a little more taste.  This is my go-to burger recipe now and my family likes it very much.

This recipe has saved my burger making at home. Even when you cook these "well" (we prefer them medium) they still taste delicious! The secret is the dried milk that keeps the juices until you bite in. My boyfriend is a picky burger eater and I'm impressed these passed!

Just got through making these and they were delicious! I used 80 / 20 hamburger meat and got rid of most of the egg white per another reviewers suggestion. (review said they would be less watery or something with mostly yolk) I had panko bread crumbs and used those - poured evaporated milk on them before mixing. Didn't use the cayenne because my three year old was eating. Will make again. YUM.

Remember not to mix the beef mixture for too long or the burgers will come out tougher then you'd like. Just mix with your hands until the ingredients are spread around. I left out the milk, and added a dash or two of oregano, fresh black pepper & powdered mustard. I sprinkled garlic salt on the outside of the patties. I did everything else the same. The burgers were amazing. I made enough to freeze a bunch and have later, and they are just as delicious. Best burgers I've ever made, and a house full of friends and family agree. I should have made more! We ran out super fast!

I just made this and thought it was really good. I took someone's advice and used slices of bread ripped up (as opposed to bread crumbs). I even used a mix of fat free milk and half and half. It's all I had. The one thing missing was more flavor. Next time I will add more seasoning to the mix. We did decide to top the burgers with bacon and cheese. It was a very good dinner!

Tried this recipe last night. My husband said it was the best burger (except on the grill) that I had ever made. The only thing I did different instead of evaporated milk, I used 2% milk and served on a onion bun.

I've made this recipe countless times for parties and everytime people rave at how flavorful and moist they are. They are not heavy and dense like a solid meat burger.   My kids like that there are no onions in them.  It's a no fail recipe! Thank you!

Solid hamburger recipe.  I made the following substitutions due to what I had:  adjusted recipe for 1 lb ground beef, used only 1/8 c. plain bread crumbs, no evaporated milk (didn't have any), used steak sauce (such as A1) instead of Worcestershire (didn't have any of that either), and kept other ingredients according to adjusted recipe.  Once I formed the mixture into patties, I seasoned each with black pepper and seasoning salt (such as Lawry's) on one side only. I would consider using seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain next time, just to see if that ups the flavor.  I will use this recipe again.

Pretty good burgers; to be fair, I changed up a bit and used Dales' Low Sodium Steak Seasoning. Note: Do not over mix with the breadcrumbs, burgers will be tough and do not cook more than about 5 min. on each side depending on size of the burgers of course. If you don't have breadcrumbs, just soak some bread in milk and use that.

This is our absolutely favorite recipe for hamburgers.  I do always leave out the cayenne, simply because my mom doesn't like it at all.
Depending on the day, I also take shredded cheddar and mix that in with the burgers. 

Either way, these are excellent!

Made these for a July 4th BBQ and everyone raved about them.  I am not a beef eater so I can't personally attest but my husband and his beef-loving friends couldn't get enough.  We used skim milk instead of evaporated milk (forgot to pick up evaporated milk) so we put in about 1.5X the amount and it worked out great.  This will definitely be our go-to burger recipe from now on.  Thanks!

I've been a member of allrecipes for years.  This is my first review.  I was craving a tasty and juicy hamburger, not the average burger.  I tried this recipe and WOW!  The best hamburger I ever cooked.  I did it on my George Foreman because I was starving and didn't want to wait on the charcoal.  I added some seasoned salt and it was perfect.  This is a KEEPER!  Thanks!

Very easy and juicy! The whole family loved it and they keep asking for me to make it again! 
The only addition I made is that I added some mustard, chopped onion, and dried parsley. Turned out great

REALLY good; I used half and half in place of the evap milk, since I had some opened; otherwise kept to the recipe. My son-in-law ate two and said they were the best hamburgers he's ever eaten!

This is an excellent recipe for burgers. I get frustrated trying to make a burger that isn't dried out. This is IT. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1% which is what I had on hand. If it was this good with milk I can't imagine how much better it would be with the evaporated milk. Make sure you try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I came across it & the boastful tag line made me want to make it.  I did not have the evaporated milk on hand so I used 2% instead and slowly simmers until it looked like it was just milk and I also did not have cayenne peppers so I used paprika.  It was simply delicious and just as the tag line boast....very juicy!!  I will always make my burgers like these.  My family enjoyed them.

These turned out great! My fiancee RAVED about them and he considers himself a burger conoussieur!  I did add sauteed mushrooms and onions underneath the cheese, but that was purely a personal preference (I also love pepper jack).  My fiancee and I love spicy, and I believe I used two tablespoons of cayenne pepper instead.  Thanks Jane for an awesome recipe!!!

Delicious!  Very moist and tasty, the only modification I made was out of necessity, I used granulated garlic because I didn't have any fresh garlic in the house.

Great recipe, eggs and milk work well to moisten the ground beef. This same principle works with meatballls.

These burgers are absolutely delicious, the only change I make is that I add dried chilli and garlic flakes instead of the cayenne pepper. ( I still add the minced garlic )

My fiance currently as I am typing this, is cooking these burgers and they are falling apart all into the grill.  Though they may taste good (not sure yet since we have not eaten them yet) they do not cook well on the grill.!!!!!  Good luck to anyone else

Made these last night.  100% hand down one of the best home made burgers I've had.  Didn't have any cayenne pepper to add, but will have some ready for next time.  Highly recommend.

Excellent burger - extremely juicy as recipe promises, and did not shrink on the grill as sometimes is the case.  I could only get lean hamburger when I went shopping and so I added 1/2 lb. of ground pork to the recipe.  You don't taste the prok but I think it did add to the overall flavour and juiceiness.  This will definitely be my go to burger recipe.

These were the best burgers we have ever had!  The only thing I changed is I mixed the evaporated milk with two slices of bread instead of bread crumbs for about five minutes. Great recipe!!

Fantastic! I threw these together today for a 4th of July BBQ. When I asked how they tasted, everyone said the same thing, JUICY! I only found seasoned bread crumbs at the store, added what the recipe asked for, and the taste and texture was great. Thanks for a great burger recipe.

Yum! Made these on the Foreman grill & used a tore up piece of bread, instead of bread crumbs because I didn't want them to taste like meatloaf. All the teens, even my picky son, loved them. If time permitted would have put bread in processor, or maybe use panko next time. Defintely live up to their name. Will use this recipe on 4th.

After 10 years of being married & trying to cook my husband a decent hamburger, finally I did it! I got a George Foreman Grill earlier in the year and that helped, but now I found the perfect recipe to go with it. I used regular milk instead of evaporated, but otherwise followed it exactly. It's also the first time my 4 & 6 yr. old would eat a hamburger...they won't even eat one from Mc'D's. Thanks for the perfect burger!!

These were tasty and juicy, but a little mushy in the middle. I added extra garlic (as I always do) and a little soy sauce.

We really liked these burgers, we don't like them well done but they ended up that way and were still tasty and juicy. Just a little heavy on the Worcestershire sauce for me.

Burgers tasted good on the grill and were SO juicy. I used fresh cayenne pepper as well as powdered. A keeper!

these are the best juiciest burgers ever! My 3 kids love them, the only change I make is use fresh bread and regular milk as I don't have the evaporated kind on hand, thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This recipe does make a very moist burger. I did change the worcestershire sauce to milk and added 3 Tabs. of real bacon bit with the bread crumbs. Either way, a very good burger.

These were very flavorful, however, I did not find  that they were real juicy. it may have been because I used the leanest ground beef. Still very good!

Delicious! Rather than bread crumbs, I soaked a slice of bread in milk (per every pound of meat) and used 2% milk.. So juicy, everybody was asking for my recipe!

Very good burgers. I got a big juicy drip on the front of my shirt on the first bite! We topped them with thick slices of sharp cheddar. Will definitely use again.

These are very moist.  I'd say moist rather than juicy.  I think there is a difference.  The texture is good, but they need to be seasoned up.  The taste is pretty bland.  I found if you refrigerate the mixture before pattying, they hold together fine.

I couldn't help but smile when I saw this recipe.  Other than the cayenne pepper, this is the way our dad made burgers when we were growing up...only there were so many of us, that his intention was to add 'filler' to extend the meat for enough burgers....it always turned out juicy and delicious....thanks for the fond memories and great recipe....

Very nice burgers.  Should have flattened mine out more.  Instead of breadcrumbs, (since it called for garlic) all I had was garllic Croutons. I used this instead of breadcrumbs.  Instead of cayenne pepper, I used Jamaican Jerk.  A little kick to them for 8 people I would use 1 1/4 Tablespoons of the Jerk.

I put in just enough bread crumbs so the patties wouldn't be too tacky to handle. I figure I get enough bread-products with the bun. My family didn't comment on these one way or another. Not sure they noticed. I think I'll just stick with 100% beef topped with garlic powder and crushed black pepercorns and save the hassle. Glad to give it a try tho Jane.

Superb burger.  I was amazed at how moist these were.  I cut the recipe in half for my husband and I.  I also used a bit of salsa to add a little more zip, turned out terrific.  This will be my only burger recipe from now on!

These burgers were a big hit with my husband :o).  He's a big hunter, so we used ground venison instead and halved the recipe for 1 lb of meat.  I didn't have evaporated milk on hand so I took the advice of other reviewers and used a tablespoon of regular milk instead.  Will definitely make again!!

Ecellent burgers. I had an 11 year old make them for me. I just had one and am thinking of seconds.  What to do with the other 11 ounces of evaporated milk now? I find something!

Got home frm work, lit up the grill (yes in Februrary) and made these burgers. Used regular milk, only used 2/3 cup garlic & herb bread crumbs, and didn't measure my cayenne pepper or garlic. Slapped those on the grill, fried some bacon, cooking down sliced onion rings in the drippings, and you know the rest. Really good. My daughter loved them but said next time I shoud add a little salt.  They were fine for me,  but hey, whatever you like. I do know this is my burger from now on.  Thank you.

These are unbelievable.  My fiance does not like anything remotely hot so I don't use the cayenne pepper, but otherwise I make them just as shown.  The same recipe makes amazing meatballs.

This hamburger is great... if you like meatloaf!  And luckily we do.  The only change I made was to sub. 2% for the milk--didn't want to waste a whole can.

Amazing!  I only used 1 pound of beef so I alterted everything because of that... To keep down on the fat I used skim milk instead of evaporated milk.  I used bold & spicy A1 sauce and Jack Daniels BBQ sauce as well.  I made them on my George Foreman grill and they were surprisingly juicy!

Used home-grown Highland beef for these and they were just missing a little something.  It is a good base recipe though as long as you add your own flavor.

This was surprisingly good! I did not use the bread crumbs because to me, bread crumbs = meatloaf!! I mixed it the ingredients first (using half and half), then added to 3 lbs ground chuck. I shaped into patties and let them rest for an hour before grilling. Grilled to a medium rare and they were perfect. Nice and juicy.

So delicious! I actually made these on the stove in a skillet and they still came out "fluffy" and delicious.  I just used a dash for regular milk because I didn't have anything else, but it worked out great.  I will make these again for sure.

I might have to try these again...they got such great reviews but I didn't care for them much. They tasted good, but I think maybe it was the texture of the meat, if that makes any sense?

I give this a 4 star rate. I loved it, but the bread crumbs gave it a weird texture. My husband usually eats 1 cheeseburger and he is through, not with this recipe. I will use it again the family loves it.

these were very juicy and really good. 
i added more minced garlic, 1/4 c. of finely copped red onion. i also used regular milk, and ground up oats instead of bread crumbs. 

pan fried.

would also taste great with a packet of ranch dressing powder mix.

This is good.  I actually like a more meaty taste, so I think I would lessen the bread crumbs, next time. I only did 1lb of meat.  It would make a good meatball.

This was very moist!! My DH said it was just like a restaurant hamburger. I did use the suggestion to add in oatmeal instead of bread crumbs everything else was as the recipe called for. Next time I will add more spices but my family is addicted to rich flavor. Will make again.

The burgers were good.  However, I didn’t have Worcestershire sauce and I used barbecue sauce.  I also substituted garlic for onions.  They were quite delicious.

This recipe is wonderful! Except I followed other readers and added sour cream and milk instead of evaporate milk and used oatmeal instead of bread crumb. I did not have cayenne pepper, so I used chipolte powder instead.  Fantastic!  So good this way I ate 2 burgers with tomatoes, onions, mustard, ketchup, mayo & cheddar cheese...The absolute best!  I ate 2 hamburgers!

Great recipe! The only thing I do different is stuff my patties with jalapenos and cheese. Just make 2 small patties and sandwich the cheese and jalapenos between the 2 thin patties, making a thick, stuffed burger. Make sure to seal the cheese in or it will drip out. Enjoy!

Good burgers.  Made them tonight.  I used whole milk because that was all i had on hand.  Also, i did not have bread crumbs so i crumbled my own bread.  I will use less milk next time b/c the burgers were a little mushy.  I added my own seasoning.  All in all, good burgers and tasted nothing like meatloaf.

Loved these!  I didn't have evap milk so I used 1T sour cream and 2T milk.  Also added a couple of drops of liquid smoke and used fresh bread crumbs.  I used 80/20 ground beef (really cheap stuff in the tube at WalMart) and these were some of the best burgers I have ever made.

As I type this my family & I are sitting here eating these wonderful hamburgers. they are moist easy and much much better than any fast food you could buy. I did change it a little bit by using sour cream instead of milk & bacon on top. It is wonderful. The sour cream gives it a great moistness. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I halved the recipe and add 1/2 lb. of fresh sage sausage, eliminated the hot sauce, subbed crushed french fried onion rings in the can for the bread crumbs.  These were moist and tasted good with a grilled bun, tomato, lettuce, thousand Island dressing and white american cheese.  Although not my favorite burger recipe from this site (turkey burger) I would make this again if needed.

These hamburgers are wonderful.  I did make a few changes:  I used 2 tsp. of McCormick Grillmate for Hamburgers instead of the cayenne pepper and I forgot to add in the garlic.  I used 80/20 ground beef.  I cooked the burgers until they were well done and they were very juicy.  I didn't feel that they were at all like meatloaf.  I made the burgers for Father's Day dinner and was asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

Tasty burger. BUT, it is too mushy. It holds together well enough to be cooked and bunned but there is nothing to chew on. It mushes right up in my mouth. I like my meat cooked medium but it needs a little structure when chewing to enjoy the flavors.

Very good, I didn't have evaporated milk so I just substituted regular milk. I did not add the cayenne pepper because I was afraid my mother and aunt would not like that flavor. The kids said that it was good.

Very delicious!  I will definitely be making my burgers this way from now on.  Only thing is the patty didn't stay together to well on the grill but I'm not sure if this is because of the meat I used.  Next time I'll try them on my George Foreman indoor grill.  Thanks OP!

These were in fact the juciest hamburgers ever! I had no problems, I only used 1 lb of ground round and 1/3 cup store bought progresso bread crumbs w/one egg and 1/2 the remaining ingredients and only made 3 thick patties. We couldn't even taste the crumbs and the burgers were so juicy we couldn't believe it! We have been so disappointed w/our burgers lately - never again!

Great burgers.I agree with the other reviewers about using supermarket-bought bread crumbs. They make the burger slightly crumbly. But the taste was superb anyhow. Will make again. Nx time I might try use fresh bread crumbs. Thanks again!

Just okay.  Tastes too much like meatloaf for me.  If I wanted meatloaf, I would have made a meatloaf.  I will probably try again, but tweak the recipe a little for a more meaty taste.

This was ok, but not great. I used regular milk instead of evaporated milk, egg yolk only, a little more bread crumbs and added different spices, but it seemed really bland to me. As one person stated it's missing a salt element. My husband didn't like it and said tasted bland. I think I'll keep looking.

I've never added the cayenne pepper but these burgers have been the star of the show at every cookout we've had!  I've received so many compliments on the flavor.  I also added the worcestershire sauce right into the meat instead of sprinkling. Thanks!

I soaked 2 slices of bread in the milk and only used the egg yolks as other reviewers suggested and the consistency was perfect.  The flavor was good, too, but a bit on the bland side.  It needs a "salty element".  Maybe seasoned salt or a dash of soy sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.

We cooked one burger just to taste and ended up packaging up the rest of the uncooked mixture to freeze and use as meatloaf.  Finally made just seasoned meat with green chili peppers added like we usually do for burgers.

This has become our favorite way to prepare burgers for the grill. And, I do recommend them for the grill.  They are, as the title suggests, very juicy and have a very tender texture.  I use an 80/20 burger for more flavor.  You may also reduce the amount of bread crumbs for a more meaty texture, but don't eliminate them.  You can easily jazz them up by adding whatever spices appeal to you.  I add a little bit of dill pickle relish to the mix.  The cayenne adds a nice zing.  My mother, a very picky eater, raves about these tender and juicy burgers.

My husband & I loved this!!!They were certainly big and juicy! I didn't add the milk cause I didn't have any but will next time.Mine were a little salty though,because I used Lawry's garlicsalt.But other than that they were the best juiciest burgers I've BBQ'd!

I scaled this recipe to make 9 servings. They weren't juicey at all, had the texture of meatloaf like other reviews said. The seasonings were very good, although I added 1 teas. of McCormick Broiled Steak Seasoning like I do to all my homemade burgers. This recipe does make very large burgers and my family did like them. I'll probably make this again, but will add more evaporated milk or less bread crumbs.

I had mixed reviews when I made these.  One of my friends would not even finish her burger, but a few other friends went back for seconds!  I thought they were all right, but I don't think I'll be making them again.

I made these the day before I served them, which probably wasn't the best idea because it was way too garlicky!  I think I prefer hamburgers without bread crumbs-tasted like meatloaf like other reviews said.  However, I like the idea of Cayenne pepper and Worchester.  My brother in law did ask for the recipe. Not my favorite.

Perfect juicy, meaty burgers! I halved the recipe and used Dales liquid seasoning instead of Worcester sauce and plain milk. Next time I will add some minced onion too. Thanks for this great recipe!

Boy, these came out super juicy! The whole family enjoyed them.
What I altered: I used 3 lbs of beef and I added a cup of chopped onions. I also added 1tsp of liquid smoke for extra flavor, 1 tsp of paprika instead of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp of garlic pepper salt. Also, the bread crumbs I used are Italian style.
What I got: 15 chunky, juicy, round and not flat patties

We LOVED this burger. I only had one lb ground beef, so I halved the recipe. I used the egg white instead of a whole egg, and I didn't have evaporated milk, so I just left it out. I grilled them on a cast iron skillet with raised grill features. The burgers stuck a little and tried to come apart, but they all made it out in one piece. Not sure if I just didn't have the skillet hot enough or if it was the difference in the egg or the milk. Still a winner though! My husband kept interrupting his chewing to tell me how great it was!! And my 15-year-old son loved it too!

Made these  and it was great! However I made some changes: 
- 1 package of Sason Goya (the little packet in the box)
- Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning
- Salt + pepper
- add less breadcrumbs

Pretty good burgers. To keep it wheat free, I substituted a mix of oatmeal and almond flour for the breadcrumbs. And since I had no other use for evaporated milk, I just used some thinned yogurt. 

It's important to get the grill really hot so they sizzle right off the bat. We cooked them about 4 minutes longer so they were cooked through.

Nice recipe! I get why some say it reminds them of meatloaf, but meatloaf has sage in it (at least my recipe does), so it doesn't exactly taste like meatloaf, just the texture a bit. But definitely a moist burger and a recipe I'll keep using. 
I used 1/2 cup of crumbs and soaked them in the milk and Worcestershire sauce before adding to the burger. I also added 2 tbsp of grated onion, a tbsp of steak spice, 1/4 tsp salt & same of pepper, and 2 tbsp of veg oil when I used low fat ground beef.

These burgers are pretty darn good.  The only change I made was roasted garlic bread crumbs instead of plain.  Don't smash down the burgers while grilling them, just cook, flip, cook, enjoy!

No changes, just mixed it, and then I let it sit a little bit to let the flavers meld. About 15 minutes, it was awesome and very juicy. I paired it with sweet potato fries.

I have made these about 3 times now and everyone I have served them to has loved them.  They are a little bit like meatloaf, but nobody seemed to mind.  I don't normally eat a whole lot of red meat but it was hard to resist grilling up these juicy hamburgers during the summer months.

If you don’t want it to end up tasting like meatloaf, add some garlic butter in the patties after you shape it into a ball. Indent the ball shape with your thumb to make a “hole,” then put a teaspoon of garlic butter in the middle. Reshape into a ball, then put into a ziplock bag and slowly shape into a patty.

This recipe makes a great classic burger, without being overly done up.  They turned out nice and tender with a nice flavor and held together well.  The only thing I did differently was doubled the garlic, added salt, pepper, and a sliced green onion.  I let the meat marinate together for around an hour before searing in a cast iron pan.  They tasted great!  Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful! I halved the recipe since I only had 1 lb of meat, and I had to substitute regular milk for the evaporated milk since I didn't have any. I followed one reviewer's advice and used just the egg yolk... otherwise followed the recipe exactly! I cooked them a little longer than 5 minutes per side since I'm pregnant and don't want to consume any raw meat in any form (medium well, etc.) These burgers were impressively tender and juicy! My husband LOVED these. Thanks for a simple yet delicious recipe.

I made a double batch. I only gave it 4 stars because it needs salt.  I formed the patties a day in advance and kept them in the refrigerator separated with waxed paper.  They cooked up nice and moist.

I use this recipe every time I cook burgers. I also add liquid smoke, use the 2 pieces of bread soaked in milk, use only the egg yolk, add 1 packet of Lipton onion soup mix, and I also add crumbled bacon and shredded cheddar to the patty mixture. Sprinkle with homemade burger seasoning (I use Red Robin copycat burger seasoning).

Was the best grilled hamburgers weve had in a long time.  My husband hasn't liked having burgers at all and I wanted to see
if this would help.  We both liked them and I will definetly make them again.

This is a good basic burger recipe, but it lacks flavor. So, I sautéed 1 cup of minced sweet onion with 1 tablespoon of fresh minced parsley. To the last 30 seconds of the mixture I added  1 teaspoon of minced fresh garlic.  Cayenne I usually reserve for my Mexican dishes, so I did not add it. My family absolutely loves these burgers. :)

The aroma while cooking was great but ended up tasting like meat loaf IMO.  I think I simply don't like the bread mixed in with the burger, it goes on the top and bottom. The only "tweak" I would make to this recipe would be to strip everything and just use the meat.  This is my first comment and I usually just move on if I don't like the recipe. I had to rate this one, didn't care for it at all.

I used regular milk, Panko breadcrumbs, Himalayan pink salt, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, parsley, & a dash of Cajun seasoning, besides all the recommended ingredients. My husband and I were very impressed by how great these burgers turned out. I will definitely make these again!!

I just made it for first time with the egg and bread crumbs along with my own seasonings. My burger fell apart but it was moist. I tend to add turkey sausage and pork to my meat though but did not have it this time.

i was hesitant about making this especially when i saw there was evaporated milk in the recipe, i have nothing against the milk i like to use it in my mash potatoes, but for a burger, i was skeptical, but it was delicious so soft and moist. The only thing i changed was the breadcrumb  i used Italian breadcrumb that was all i had, and maybe next time not so much cayenne pepper and i will add a little salt, overall my husband thought it was one of the best burgers he ever ate and he should know every where we go he orders a burger.

Meatloaf. Bread crumbs soak up all of the "juice" (aka grease), and that's what constitutes it's title. The bread crumbs made it rather mushy, and the ingredients didn't offer enough salt imo. I will say that half of the people thought very well of them.

The first time that I attempted the recepie I was blown away by how moist and juicy it was!!! I live in the Caribbean so we tend to throw in EVERY seasoning we can put our hands on so I knew  I added extra! BUT MY GOSH THE FLAVOR! But your adding of the milk and Worcestershire sauce was genius!

The second time around I added on finely grated Idaho potato to add to the beef as I didn't have enough and that brought the moisture levels up again and it was just awesome! Thanks for sharing!

I  went with a 73/27 meat mix and used melted butter instead of egg in the mixture, but these burgers came out amazing! No more dry patties. I also threw in some chopped onion and garlic. Thanks again!

Whether or not a hamburger is juicy depends solely on the fat content of the ground.  Followed the recipe exactly and the burgers were no more or less juicy than normally.  Also found the taste to be quite bland.  Definitely needed salt.

As a meat loaf, this recipe rocks, but we aren't making meatloaf! We are making hamburgers. I my family and I don't really like meatloaf sandwiches and were looking for a good hamburger recipe. Unfortunately, this is not it.  Don't get me wrong, the majority of people might think this to be the best thing ever, but not us :(

Great base, but needs more seasoning/flavor.  I omitted the cayenne and milk and added chopped onion, salt and pepper, ranch seasoning, mojito lime, panko bread crumbs (because that is what I had) a couple drops of liquid smoke and sour cream to the ingredients and these turned out AMAZING!  I did use ground pork instead of ground beef.  Even my boys who don't like onions gobbled these up.  Will keep the recipe and change it up to get different flavors, but it's a great base.

I didn't use garlic cloves. Added minced garlic, garlic powder, and old bay seasoning and used 73% lean ground beef. Turned out great, had a lot of flavor and lived up to its name of being juicy.

Add a dash of TABASCO sauce. That will not make it spicy, but it will make the flavors come together nicely.

I made these for a big Memorial Day BBQ and everyone raved about how delicious the burgers were and wanted to recipe. I don't eat burgers often, very rarely actually, but my family and I loved them as well. We enjoyed eating them as left overs for a couple days following. Highly recommend this recipe.

Great burgers! Huge hit with the family. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. My two 17 year old nephews ate three of them and went on about how they were the best burgers they ever ate. Winning!

Excellent recipe although I left out the Cayenne Pepper and added a little extra Worcestershire Sauce because I really like it otherwise followed the recipe and we loved the burgers.  Highly recommend if you like a juicy, not dry burger.  
I saved the recipe and I will use it again!

These are great!! I didn't have breadcrumbs so used 3/4C of ground oats. Still the moistest burgers I've ever made. And everyone loved them ... not one left over at the end of dinner!!

I used beef and pork mince in the ratio 80:20. Did not have evaporated milk so used buttermilk. Added a teaspoon of cumin, teaspoon of smoked paprika, a 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander  and about 2.5 cloves of minced garlic as I had made these before and felt it needed a taste boost. I have also made these with a slice of blue cheese in the middle of the burger. I grilled them over coals and was afraid they might dry out, but they really are juicy !

I used onion and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and left out the milk. These were delicious, especially made with grass fed organic beef and cooked in butter oil mix.

Great recipe. My family loved the burgers. They all commented on how delicious and JUICY they were. That was always my problem making burgs... too try. Not anymore. Wife says we have a winner. I also took a tip from another reviewer that said to add some olive oil. Paired the burgs with french fries - bought the frozen shoestrings, then fried them in a normal pan filled with half crisco vegetable shortening and half olive oil.  Cooked til golden brown, then salted with kosher flakes. I was a BIG hit!

I chose this recipe because it reminded me of how my mother used to make hamburgers. I made it just as the recipe reads and they were wonderful.  My husband even commented on how good they were. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Fantastic, juicy burger. Thanks for posting this recipe. I made one simple change. I absolutely hate evaporated milk, I used 2% milk. Also, I make my own bread TJ

I added some feta cheese and made a home made Swedish hamburger sauce, incredible!

All though i have to tell you one thing regarding your "tip" about foil. It´s entirely stupid that you are putting this up as an tip without adding that people have to choose a specific type of aluminum foil, there are the ones that can´t take to much heat and when it does it spreads toxic in to the food instead. 

People need to buy "BBQ aluminum foil" just sayin'

I added chopped onion and use garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic, halved the cayenne pepper and added some Cajun seasoning, my husband and son said they were the best homemade burgers they ever had. I served them Mexican style, with avocado, ham and cheese. I did not grill them outside but inside in an electric grill, I can't wait to make them in a "real" grill.

This is my first time making a hamburger patty so I followed the recipe accordingly but it tasted bland. I ended up searching for another hamburger recipe to fill up the missing flavor. I added another egg, 1 tsp garlic powder (even if I already added the 2 minced garlic clove), 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp pepper (because my husband doesn't like pepper). Luckily, the taste improved.

I, like many others, have been victim to absolutely dry and lifeless burgers. But this recipe, in tandem with the egg and 2 tbsp of milk, allowed me to make the juiciest burgers I'd made in my entire 27 years of life.

I can't give this recipe enough praise, because my burgers were seriously amazing. Though I did not use the seasoning in this recipe (I opted for a blend of Chili Powder, Smoked Paprika, and Beau Monde seasonings). I also cooked it on a regular ole frying pan (I have no grill nor skillet - still in the process of moving).

But ya.. this is hands-down the best burger recipe I think I could find on the internet.

Sorry, but this didn't do it for us.  The breadcrumbs made it more like meatloaf.  Not that meatloaf sandwiches are bad...but we were expecting juicy hamburgers.

I had the family over for burgers.  Everyone liked them even the young kids.  I made the recipe as per the instructions with the exception of no cayenne pepper and I used flaked garlic instead of buds.  The burgers were juicy and moist.  I will make them again for sure.

I loved how the burgers browned; they sort of had a bark on them.  I'm guessing it was due to the bread.  The burgers were not necessarily juicy but they were moist and tender.

However, the taste was v-e-r-y bland!  And, for the record, I went directly by the recipe.

This was tasty and juicy, but doesn't compare to my favorite burger recipe on this site - Chris' Bay Area Burger. To make it healthier, I used half beef and half turkey. 
I tried the trick another reviewer mentioned - mixing the breadcrumbs with the milk (I used soy) first - and it was a disaster. I ended up with clumps of breadcrumbs I needed to mash. Last time I'm doing that...

These were so simple and quick to make.  Here are my modifications.   I used 1.5lb of lean ground beef and .5 of regular ground pork.  Instead of evaporated milk, I used some leftover tzaziki I had.   I also grated an onion (stung the eyes) and doubled the garlic.    I didn't want to work the meat too much so I mixed all the ingredients together carefully.  Finally,  I made 6 patties instead of 8 and I put a thumbnail indent in each one.  I let the patties sit in the fridge for an hour before BBQing.

Wow, so much better than the frozen store bought burgers and more economical too.  I wish I had known that they were so easy to make from scratch.   My family loved them!

This is the second time making this recipe and it is great! I have tried it with 79/21 beef and 85/15 beef, both turned out great and juicy. Of course the higher fat one was a bit more juicey. I want to try this with turkey next (since I am a big turkey eater). I used A1 sauce rather than Worcester sauce (didn't have any) and 2% milk instead of evaporated (again all I had). Both times on the grill and this will be my main summer recipe. Thank you!

Best burger I've ever made. I made it exactly like the recipe (I always do the first time) and would add some seasoning next time, but it was very juicy.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. The family loved it. We threw mesquite wood chips into the grill and that also made these burgers taste that much better! I think this will now be my go to recipe for homemade burgers.

Wow! I wasn't expecting much when I made this recipe, but it was the best burger I have ever had! Highly recommend this recipe. I added a dash of onion flakes too. Delicious!

The recipe was good just a little bland. I made it as directed, which is what I always do every time I try a new recipe. Next time I will add some minced onion and some salt and pepper.

This made really great hamburgers. Juicy, tasty, and the burgers stayed together on the BBQ. Only change I made was to use garlic powder rather than actual garlic. We loved it.

I cut the bread crumbs back to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  Nice crunchy crust as a result...keeps the moisture in too.

I used Greek yogurt in place of the condensed milk for two reasons, 1. I'm cheap and I didn't want to open a can of condensed milk for 3 tbls.  and 2.  I'm a terrible cook and it seems like a good idea at the time, my reasoning was they are both off white in colour.  My 2yo toddler actually ate them and my 4 year old went so far as to gush, "better than McDonald's!"  so that's why it gets five stars.   My nearly eight year old son with his more refined pallet agreed but noted that while better than McDonald's, McDonald's patties are salted on the grill and felt that these could have used some seasoning salt.  I grilled them on a natural gas bbq.  Two other changes, one pound of beef, and 1 tsp of ground black pepper.

I used ground turkey and they were delicious. Not dry at all. I stuffed the patties with pepper jack cheese. Some kind of fell apart. Other than that they were delicious.

Followed recipe exactly. Not sure if I like the bread crumbs or not. They made the burger softer and mushier, but not sure if it was juicier. I think I will try again without them.

This hamburger is really awsome, it is juicy just like the recipe tells ya. Best hamburger I had for a long time !! I've replaced the garlick cloves into garlick powder. I added 1 tablespoon of onion powder and added feta cheese, crumbled, about 1 cup.

I make this recipe once a month. I use regular milk instead of evaporated milk and a bread slice instead of bread crumbs. I also dice half an onion and add it to the patties.

I used 1 pound extra lean ground beef instead of 2 and cream instead of condensed milk. I didn't want to open a can just for 3 tbsp., the rest would have gone to waste. They were easy to form and didn't fall apart while flipping. The patties were very tasty and the texture was fine.

I don't care what any of the other reviews say, these are the best burger patties I have ever made. Yes, they are meatloafy, but what do you expect after adding breadcrumbs? If you don't like the meatloafy-ness, add crumbed crackers, or no bread at all.  I searched for the juiciest burgers ever on google and found this recipe, and I was not disappointed. I mixed everything together and created patties for my boyfriend to grill. He added just a few wood chunks for that smokey flavor. Those burgers turned out phenomenally. Our friends loved them. We never share anything we cook, but we are excited to share these with our family at our next gathering. Thank you for sharing your awesome recipe!

I don't normally follow a recipe for burgers, but was looking to try something different with them. These were fantastic! I used regular milk, just because I didn't have any evaporated milk.

I used milk instead of evaporated milk but liked the suggestion of someone who said to freeze the rest of the milk--I hadn't thought of doing that and didn't want to open a can of milk for such a small amount.  Will try that next time. Thought these were tasty and will make them again.

We absolutely LOVE these burgers! Just had guests over yesterday and I quote, "This is the best burger I've ever had, in my life!" They are so juicy and have an amazing taste. The best part about these is that you can take one as a leftover to work and heat it up in the microwave...And it's just as juicy as the moment it came off the grill. The key in this recipe is the evaporated milk so don't skimp and follow the recipe. Love it!!!

These were really good!  Used the 80/20 meat and deleted the bread crumbs, as I don't like bread fillers in my burgers.  They turned out great, held together perfectly and were nice and juicy!!

THIS WAS AMAZING! I did leave out the cayenne and use regular milk since I did not have evaporated.  Also added 1/2 cup red quinoa because I wanted to try it, but I don't think that altered the recipe. I cooked them in the oven since it was too cold outside. So yummy  definitely will make my burgers like this from now on.

My family has been adding breadcrumbs and evaporated milk in our meatballs, meatloaves and burgers for several generations! But in our hamburger patties we have our own secret ingredients that people always say we have the best hamburgers ever tasted!  But its a family promise that we keep it in the family!  But I will tell you this add diced yellow onions, as well as your choice of spices to the raw hamburger then cook them!  Onion and/or tiny diced jalapeños really adds to it! Also add your barbecue sauces near the end of the cooking time if you do not like charred burgers!  I prefer my burgers with no barbecue sauce because of our family secret, but I learned I dislike burgers where the barbecue sauce is put on right at the beginning!  Also if you want a thicker barbecue sauce add corn starch to it and as it cooks it makes a thicker glaze on the burgers!   Good luck!

Huge hit, even with picky elementary aged kids.  I did substitute "Emeril's Original Essence" spice in for cayenne pepper (and garlic cloves because it contains garlic).  Can't do spicy with my kids and this spice is great for burgers, all the "right stuff".   For those interested, the spice contains salt, paprika, black pepper, granulated garlic and onion powder.  However, I can imagine this would have been 6 stars with the cayenne, more heat would have made it really special for those of us who like it!  The basic meat mixture was the real winner, kept the burgers moist, great texture.  Make sure you pack the meat hard, one of my patties felt apart on the grill because I didn't.

I am new to cooking and decided to try a different recipe than what my family usually uses for a staple of our trashy American diet - Hamburgers!

It was quite simple to prepare - we used regular 2% milk instead of evaporated - no problems. 

We like our burgers big so we made the regular 8 serving portions but simply divided it into 4 patties - again, no problems. 

Everyone loved the recipe and I managed, for the first time, to achieve an amateur chef's dream - everybody closed their eyes as they bit in and had an 'oh man' moment. 

You can't beat that!

These were awesome!  I actually used 2.78 lbs. of hamburger because that was what was in the package, and I also added about a tbsp. of onion powder and a tbsp. of chopped onion (the dehydrated kind).  I grilled them, and while grilling, season 1 side with Lawry's seasoned salt and Montreal Steak Seasoning, and the other just with the steak seasoning. Spread margarine on your buns and toast them on the grill, and I used some leftover bacon I fried in a skillet and sprinkled with fresh ground pepper. Build the burger with freshly chopped onion, and lettuce, and tomato if you like.  Melt whatever kind of cheese you like on the burgers.....juicy and lots of the garlic flavor......VERY delicious!

I have made this hamburger recipe several times in the last 3 to 4 years, and every time my husband and kids say it is the best burgers they have ever had! I usually omit the cayenne pepper, just because I don't like spicy food. Thank you for an easy and awesome recipe :)

I made these for a group of senior citizens - all very dear friends. The burgers were more digestible and juicy than plain hamburger. They all requested the same recipe for my next cookout! I did add some leftover dipping oil that had some wonderful herbs.

Really good hamburgers. I used veal/pork/beef combo. Since, I didn't have any evaporated milk, I just used milk instead. I added garlic powder and omitted the cayenne, since we have some spice weenies in my home. Husband couldn't stop raving about the flavour and juiciness of the burgers. This is my new go to hamburger recipe.

These burgers came out delicious!!  I only had heavy cream on hand, so I used that instead of the evaporated milk.  Also, I didn't want them to be spicy so I left out the cayenne pepper.  They came out moist and very flavorful.  Will definitely make again!

I cannot believe how amazing and juicy these came out!! They were a hit the first night I made 'em and I will never go back to buying the already made burger patties again! The only thing I did different was use the egg yolk only and didn't put that much Worcestershire sauce the second time because I didn't like the flavor it gave but other than that these are a must try!

Made it this weekend for our pool party for 14 people.  Marinated overnight in fridge.  These were delicious, I tripled the garlic and added some Belizean all spice.  These were AMAZING.  They were sooooo juicy.  Everyone raved about them.  This will be a keeper recipe for sure.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Added flavors overwhelmed the beef. Bread crumbs were still crunchy. Admittedly I made these in a frying pan on the stove instead of a grill but the grill would not have fixed all the issues.  Will not be making these again.

These were tender, not juicy. I'll make this again but adding some salt and papper.

I made these for my family last night and they were a hit and I will definitely make them again. I gave it four stars ONLY because it did come out a little "meatloafy" and I know that isn't for every one. But my family LOVED them!

They were moist. I left out the cayenne, as I'm not a fan. The worchestershire was a bit overpowering for my taste. Used garlic salt. Probably not enough because I didn't taste it. I think I will play around with it more because of the moist factor - probably from the egg, evaporated milk.

this was just meatloaf in burger form. Not what I was looking for. Taste was alright, but texture was not appetizing.

The key to a good burger is the quality of the meat and knowing how to grill.  I buy half of the meat from a farm raised steer.  Try it, you will never want to buy meat from a grocery store ever again.

WOW!  I have been making hamburgers wrong for a lot of years!  I usually just make the patties, season them and throw them on the grill.  Not anymore!  I will be using this recipe from now on.  I used 90% lean ground beef and these turned out AMAZING (we've had them twice now in the past 10 days and both times they turned out the same).  The only variation I made to the recipe was to sprinkle a little bit of Lowry's on the patties before I put them on the grill.  That's it.  This one is a keeper!

Waaaaay too much bread crumbs--even more than meatloaf!  It made the burger mushy and and inedible: all bread crumbs and no meat.

 I followed the exact recipe. 

It improved a lot, however, when I microwaved the burgers to dry out the mushy bread crumbs.

I tried this recipe and followed it to the letter.  I agree with one rater, who said they were moist, but not juicy.  They did remind my hubby of meatloaf.  You just can't improve on ground chuck or sirloin burgers cooked properly.

Great burgers!! I added a little onion powder as well as salt and pepper. Didn't have evaporated milk so I just used the skimmed milk I had in the refrig. Very juicy and yummy! I'll definitely make these burgers again!

BEST. BURGER. EVER.
The only thing I changed was using oatmeal ground
in the food processor.  Everyone flipped over these
burgers!

Made them following some suggestions on using sliced bread (how I make my meatballs too) and they still weren't "juicy". BUT...I used this recipe to make some "Juicy Lucy" burgers. This recipe worked GREAT for them!! These burgers are billed as the "juiciest" ever... they weren't...that's why only 3 stars. Sorry.

Good thing I tried the recipe out before my big cookout. My husband was so disappointed I made these he didnt even finish and ate a bowl of cereal instead. Adding the bread cumbs was the worst idea ever. I thought at 4.5 stars they would be a hit, DISSAPPOINTED

YES YES YES!  I loved this.  My husband usually makes a plain burger for me with nothing in it, because I don't like "grilled meatball shaped like a hamburger".  I found this recipe, it looked like it had enough 'stuff" in it to please his tastebuds, and not at all meatball like!  So now it really has become the GO TO hamburger recipe for us.  Everyone loves it.  Tasty and juicy.  YUP!  Thanks!

I just made these, they were so delicious! I had to improvise on the evaporated milk, since I didn't have any. I used heavy cream instead, and it worked perfectly! Also, I added half an onion (very finely chopped) for some extra flavor. Very good, I'll be making these again! :-)

These burgers were excellent!!!.. I used 2Tbsp of 1% milk + 1 Tbsp of sour cream instead of the evaporated milk as suggested by another reviewer. As well as garlic powder instead of the minced garlic. I also added a little bit of Montreal Steak spice.

I've always had a problem with the meat falling apart in the skillet.  Have used bread crumbs but with not much success.  Other reviewers' suggestions of bread and milk works just fine.  Otherwise this is a fine recipe.  Thank you.

Made these today for a family BBQ.  I was a bit nervous bz the recipe looked so easy - would it taste good.  Yes folks, they were delish!! Prob the best home made burgers I've had.  I added 2 moe tablespoons of condensed milk and sat n pepper.  I melted Kraft American cheese on top and served them on light buns.  For sauce I mixed ketchup and mayo.  Mustard on other side.  Yum yum

So I will give this 3 stars but will never make this again. Why? I will say that yes the burgers turned out very moist but the texture was sooo odd. The recipe did what it said but it's not for me.

There was nothing special about these burgers. The taste was very bland. I followed the recipe exactly.  I have made better burgers by throwing in a few different spices here and there. They were juicy -- but not the least bit flavourful.

I didn't cook this on the grill but instead cooked them in the skillet following the directions from Aaron's MIssouri Burger's recipe. I modified the recipe a bit based on available items. I used a Cajun spice instead of cayenne pepper. I also added a chopped Thai chili. We didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I used A-1 Steak Sauce. The bread crumbs came from whole grain bread and added 1 beaten egg. I substituted milk for evaporated milk. Then I toasted the buns in the oven at 350. I sliced onions and provided fresh lettuce leaves, along with the usual condiments, including mayo, mustard, and ketchup. We didn't have swiss cheese, so I topped each burger with a slice of pepper jack cheese (after I had removed them from the skillet). The timing was perfect for a well done burger (20 min. and I flipped them only once). They turned out like gourmet burgers. We usually go to Fuddruckers for those. If you need to cook at home and have hamburger meat you want to use up, use this recipe. I also used a hamburger press, so they were well formed and delicious.

These are some great burgers!  In a pinch, I have used regular milk (instead of evaporated) and used crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Great recipe to vary, I have added cheese, chopped chilies, black olives & the list goes on!

Just made these....Yum and moist.  I was suspicious that these would taste like meatloaf with the egg and the breadcrumbs, but the burgers were a hit with the family.   I made minor substitutions---Rice Crispy cereal in place of the crumbs and regular milk as we had those on hand.

These were great.  Hubby wasn't sure he liked the texture due to the bread crumbs, but my son thought that was the best part.  I wouldn't say they are 'juicy', though... 'moist', would be the word (the bread crumbs soak of the juices.)  All the kids devoured them.

Jucier than your average burger for sure, though I wasn't bowled over by the flavor. Has promise if you can figure out an ideal seasoning mix.

I think that if you like hamburgers that are more than just hamburger (or chuck), salt and pepper, this is a wonderful recipe, although I do think that adding your favorite seasonings can make it even better. I love homemade meatballs and meatloaf, I also like flavorful hamburgers. When I don't want my hamburgers to taste as if I just got them from a fast food restaurant, I like trying recipes like this. I love them all.

This is the best recipe i have found for my burgers. Been using it for 4 months! I always make this when i buy fresh ground beef, shape them and freeze them. Then when the hubby and i want something quick to eat, i just put them in the oven for 15min baked and another 10 min on broil high and flip them. Freaken delicious. I don't even tweak the recipe.

This was the best burger I have ever made.  Working the grill for years, making all kinds of great food with lots of compliments from my family and friends.  Saw this receipe and thought why not, never considered using condensed milk combined with all the other ingredients was the best.  After dinner, son said he couldn't wait until the next time I make these.  Thanks for a winner!

Gluten free variation: use quinoa flakes instead of bread crumbs. I used 1/3 cup for 1lb of ground beef. I also used regular milk, and added 1tbsp fennel seed. Very tasty!

Truely the juiciest (and flavorful) hamburgers!!!  I substituted 1/4 of the total amount of ground beef with 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage and added 1/8 tsp oregano and my family loved it!  Can't wait for another potluck cookout.

This really is the juiciest burger!  Very good on the BBQ, too.  I have never used bread crumbs in burgers before and now I will always use this recipe.  I used regular milk (all I had on hand) and plain store brand crumbs.  Great recipe!!!

Made as directed and added ~1/2 C chopped onion, and used regular milk vs canned milk.  Bread crumbs were seasoned - really good and juicy.

These are the best burgers EVER!!  They really are the juiciest!  The recipe is like any other ordinary hamburger recipe except the evaporated milk.  I think that is what sets this recipe apart from all other burgers.  Even I couldn't mess these up!  DEEEEEEEELISH!!!!

I made these when I had guests for dinner & really wasn't a fan.  I love meatloaf, so thought the texture wouldn't bother me, but I thought they were bland & really didn't care for the texture.  If I make this again, I will definitely alter things a bit.

Fantastic starter recipe! The burgers were not dry at all! Which is the basis of the recipe! I used bread and mild instead, like other suggested and added a few extra ingredients for taste because i heard it was a bit bland (didn't say tastiest hamburger just juiciest).

Since I'm vegetarian, I didn't eat these myself, but my meat eaters thought they were great and want me to make them again. Today I used a different recipe for burgers from this site and no one liked them, but one son said I should make these again instead. Mine held together fine and were moist. I used two slices of bread soaked in the milk and then mashed up like others suggested.

Just made these last weekend for my wife and I.  Nice and juicy with good flavor.  I left out the egg white, used a little more worcestershire sauce and substituted the break crumbs with wheat bread.  Will make them again especially now that BBQ season is here!

These were very good burgers.
While I was making them, someone had commented that the meat looked like Meatloaf (I used 85% lean beef).  But after tasting, their reaction quickly flipped to the opposite.  A great recipe - will definitely be using it again.  Really liked the red pepper

Very tasty and juicy without the bread crumbs!  I used regular milk, 80/20 beef, and stuffed the burgers with cheddar cheese.  Fried them on the cast iron pan.  A definite keeper.

Oh! My! Gosh!  This is the best burger EVER!  I hardly ever finish a whole burger but I did on this one!  Almost wanting seconds!  I added 1 tbls of dried jalapeño flakes and topped with sharp white cheddar!  I also used grass-feed ground beef and believe me, grass-feed makes a HUGE difference in taste!

Everyone loved these hamurgers! They really are the best we've ever made.I didn't have garlic but I added some chopped onion and cavender's seasoning to the meat.They turned out so juicy and they were just as good reheated the next day.This is the only recipe I'll use for burgers from now on.

Made these for the first time over Memorial Day weekend. Everyone loved them! I used 9 lbs. of 85/15 ground beef to serve 36 burgers. I followed the recipe, adding only a little onion powder to the mix. They came out very juicy with a good flavor to them.  Based on other reviewers concerns about "mushy" middles, I made sure my patties were not more than an inch thick, pushed a divot into each center before cooking, and the middles came out perfect.  Since these are mild in seasoning, I gave my guests lots of toppings to choose from - my "burger bar" was a hit: American or pepper jack cheese, sauteed onions and peppers, bacon, sliced avocado, lettuce, tomato, red onions, and pickles. Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making these again.

The hamburgers were juicy and this is probably a great recipe if you like your hamburgers well done.  My problem is that you cannnot taste the meat.  Since I like the flavor of medium rare hamburgers, I was disappointed and will not make this one again.

While definitely juicy, the consistency bordered on mushy, at least for us.  If I make again, I may omit the bread crumbs entirely.  Also, I found the patties to be not only mushy, but a little bland as well, so they could do with some sort of seasoning.

fantastic hamburgers! My first time grilling and these turned out amazing. super filling and super juicy. I mixed all the ingredients together and let that sit in the refrigerator for a few hours and then shaped and grilled them. I also used 1 tablespoon Worcestershire and 1 1/2 tablespoon soysauce. Also because I had 3 lbs instead of 2 I added 2 egg yolks. I added some black pepper in addition to the cayenne and I soaked a piece of bread in milk like some other users said. I basted just a little and added some cheese. Loved it! I will definitely be making some more soon.

Yum!  Easy and juicy.  I didn't have a grill, so I used the stove...  I'll have to work on my stove grilling skills...  But even so, they were delicious and juicy!

These were pretty good! Very moist and juicy, indeed. Could use a bit more flavor though.

Made them over the weekend and had some unexpected guests. They all raved about how amazing these burgers were. My hubby said they were the best he's ever had- Thanks for sharing.

Followed instructions and, although the burgers were juicy, the flavor was really bland. Definitely needed more spices to liven things up. Could only give 3 stars for lack of flavor. But thanks for the juiciness! Ended up with 3 leftover patties that we're going to brown to mix in with something else. Neither of us wants another hamburger.  :(

I was looking for a good homemade pattie recipe since the pre-made patties are getting so expensive. I made this one last night and couldn't be happier with it. I was completely shocked at how well they stayed together, especially once on the grill. They didn't fall apart at all! They tasted great. Just the right amount of seasoning. And the highlight of the night was when my husband (who is hard to please in the kitchen) told me to hang on to the recipe. That in itself says something!
The only thing I didn't like about it is using evaporated milk. I had to open a whole can and ended up throwing the rest of it away since I didn't have anything else to use it for.

These burgers were juicy, but that is it. They tasted as if I hadn't added any seasoning. I was expecting to be wowed by these burgers based on all of the rave reviews. Therefore, I was quite disappointed.

Awesome recipe.  Made it for about 20 people tonight.  I was a hero.  Everyone raved about these burgers.  Great flavor to them and the bread crumbs added a lot more texture to the meat.  Loved it.

Big hit last night for dinner. I will take the advice and just use the yolk next time.  Also a little less evaporated milk.  They tended to fall apart easily.  But the flavor was great!

Love this recipe. I used turkey meat instead of hamburger meat and it was very juicy! I did add extra garlic. Instead of the bread crumbs I used a slice of bread I drenched in 2% milk. This is a keeper! My boyfriend asks me to make the burgers now :)

This recipe was awesome.  I really enjoyed the flavours.  I changed it a little - I made patties and refrigerated them for 24 hours - garlic was awesome.  I also inserted a slice of jalepeno cheese into the centre of each pattie to give it extra flavour!!

Since stores only sold 1.75 to 1.8 pound pkgs of the 80/20 hamburger, I decreased the amount of bread crumbs, which were the Panko Parmesan, to 1/2 cup.  I then used the rest of the ingredients as normal and the burgers turned out awesome!!  I don't get the negative reviews on this recipe, as I take being asked for the recipe by the person who shared these with me as a compliment...  IOW - a double thumbs UP on this mix.

Great burger. I think it needs a bit more seasoning though. Maybe adding some green onions to the mix. I'll try some variations and report later. Thanks

Best burger recipe ever!!! I double the recipe.  I used 4Lb 20% fat ground beef, used four end slices of white bread (the ones that are usually thrown away, I save those in the freezer) instead of bread crumbs and drizzled the milk over each slices(didn't measure it) to soak them, little more than 1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, didn't add cayenne pepper b/c I dont have one, 2 eggs and 1 tablespoonful minced garlic.  I make my patty huge (~5 inches in diameter) and thick (~1/2 inch).  Grilled on my gas grill.  Once cooked, it shrinks to fit my bun!

I wouldn't go as far as calling these the juiciest burgers ever but they were mighty tasty!  They had such a great flavor that I will use this recipe again and again.  Perhaps next time I'll use a 70/30 mix when grilling these.  I used 80/20 and they were still on the dry side.  All in all though, great taste and definitely a crowd pleaser.

Good burgers but a bit too moist...like others wrote, they seemed to crumble somewhat.  I halved the recipe and used regular milk in place of evaporated milk.

Awesome burgers!! I made them with 80/20 ground beef, bread crumbs, 2% milk, and just the egg yolk as another user recommended.  I also upped the worcestshire sauce and instead of using cayenne pepper and garlic, I used a tuscan garlic seasoning as well as McCormick's hamburger seasoning.  They were sooooo good and extremely juicy!  I will never come close to understanding the people who are saying that they taste like meatloaf - not at all!  Thank you so much for the recipe!  They were as good as my mom used to make :c)

This hamburger recipe tasted more like meatloaf to me than hamburgers.  The taste was great but the consistence was not to my liking.  I won't be making this again.

ok  make sure you mix very well or you will have odd textures wonderful juicy bite, dry bite,and then a mushy bite. i will try these again but i need to do some tweeking. also suggest that after you form patties freeze them for twenty minutes and start them cooking them really fast to help them not fall apart. someone else had that problem

The recipe is definitely true to its name. Tender and juicy, but it does fall apart. I increased the crumbs and egg, but it didn't bind as well as I thought it would. It also lacked in flavour... I did use Italian-style bread crumbs, upped the cayenne, subbed garlic powder for the real deal. Maybe if I added additional Italian seasoning, increased the cayenne, and used fresh minced garlic that would give it the taste I was expecting. Also subbed 2% milk instead of the evaporated. i've since found a better burger recipe from Food2, a division of FN.

This recipe is fantastic! I made these for my boyfriend, and he is in LOVE with them. We first tried them about two weeks ago, and he has requested these three times since. I didn't change anything in the recipe, except for using regular milk, and minced garlic. THANKS JANE! These are DEF a regular in our household.

I used extremely low fat Ostrich meat and they still came out juicy enough to get the buns wet. I only changed the fresh garlic to granulated because I didn't have fresh, and added a full teaspoon of cayenne pepper, which I wish I hadn't, and used Eggbeaters instead of a real egg. Otherwise, followed exactly as written. Everyone loved the taste with the exception of the heat. I will make these again and again. Thanks!

Delicious! and very juicy.  Didn't have any Worcestershire sauce and forgot to add the cayenne pepper but it tasted perfect.  No pink in the middle yet still juicy and appetizing.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

These were very juicy burgers. I added 3 cloves garlic and followed everything else to a T. Next time though I will add a little more seasoning or maybe exta worchestershire with a little extra bread crumbs. With more of a kick these would be restaurant quality! Thanks

Definitley juicy!  Omitted bread crumbs all together (if you want your burgers more firm, you should definitly use bread crumbs).  Also added a splash of white wine vinegar and a tsp of salt for some oomph.  Love the cayanne.  Topped with pepper jack and bacon... very very good!!

The flavor of this hamburger is to die for!  It is so delicious, juicy and got rave reviews from the inlaws :)!!  I gave 4 stars because my husband hates making these on the grill- the patties tend to fall apart easily and he said it's a pain to cook.  However if you have the patience to deal with a softer patty then it's so worth it!

Just as promised... the juiciest burgers ever!  However, I did make some minor changes.  I used 2 and 1/2 pounds of 90/10 beef, Italian bread crumbs and doubled the milk for more moisture.  Being from the South, I also kicked up the cayenne to 1 tablespoon.  The burgers were then grilled indoors and basted with a smoky BBQ sauce for approximately 4 minutes on each side.   They were then placed in tight foil and baked for the next 20 minutes in a 300 degree oven while we waited on the oven fries.  I did this to seal in the flavors of the burgers, complete cooking and to keep them warm.  Increasing the milk and spices, instead of bread crumbs, provided more of a burger consistency and less "meatloaf."  The burgers were topped with Pepper Jack Cheese and served with a toasted bun.  YUM - glad we have leftovers!!!!  Thanks, Jane, for the recipe.

As a first time attempt at making hamburgers not purchased with a large drink and soggy fries, this recipe was a perfect choice. Not only was I able to play around with the recipe to suit my own palate, but using the George Foreman grill as mentioned by the previous reviewers was incredibly easy. Thank you for the great recipe, it will be one I will keep for a long time to come.

These were so great and very juicy! I have used both ground beef and ground turkey, it worked great for both! If you want something to add a little extra I put bacon bits in the meat when mixing together. The best burger recipe I have found. Husband and family loved it!!

Best burgers I've ever made. I used paprika instead of cayenne pepper and mile because I didn't have evap. milk but they turned out great. I will make them again for sure!

Excellent. I used turkey meat. I will use low fat milk next time.  I did not add cheese inside, but I did add a slice on the burger.

I think these burgers were awsome! I as well as some others omited the bread crumbs and added moist bread. I also added 3/4 cup sharp shredded chesse which gave it a nice cheesey flavor , very good I will be making these again !

Wow these were really good, and I hate meatloaf.  I made these for a party, and they were a big hit.  I was even asked to share the recipe.  I would make these again anytime.

These are truly incredibly juicy hamburgers! They reminded me of the way I make meatballs, as some other reviews said. I've made these several times and I thinks they're also good with some finely chopped shallots added to the meat mixture. It's also a way to made lean meat much more appealing in a burger.

I gave it a 3 star because the burger felled apart.  Other than that it was juicy but my daughter said it was chewy.  I will have to redo this again.

These burgers were a hit at our Labor Day cook out! Even my 7 year old nephew who is very picky liked them. My kids do not like onions or anything that resembles them, so instead of using garlic cloves I used garlic powder. I will definetly make these again.

These burgers were fantastic.  I served them (substituting regular milk for the evaporated) at a BBQ last night, and everyone wanted to know how I got them "to melt in your mouth."  I will use this recipe from now on.

Very good!  My husband lost track of time and ended up over-cooking them on the grill, the outside was crusty but the inside was still as juicy as can be!  I gave it 4 stars only because I plan on making again and adding a few more spices to kick the flavor up, but all and all, we really liked the recipe and the consistency (the only thing I subbed was half&half for the evaporated milk because I didn't have any one hand.

I made these burgers for my family and these burgers were so juicy and delicious! better than any burger joint I have been too. I added A-1 steak sauce and a little soysauce in place of whishirere sauce because I didnt have any on hand and dint add the evap. milk.  They still turned out great and added a little cheese on top! perfect!!!

(We cut the recipe in half since it was only four of us, and used regular milk instead, since we had no evaporated on hand)

These are the BEST burgers ever! Time & time again I come back to this recipe.  I have passed it on to my children who have passed it onto their friends.  The only thing I've ever changed is in using 3 tbsp half & half when out of evaporated milk - no difference in taste.  Again the BEST BURGERS ever!

I was amazed at how much tastier these were than my "regular" burgers! I do add a squirt of mustard and usually cook them in a skillet, rather than on the grill - they are still FANTASTIC!!!

I didn't care for these a lot.  They weren't so much juicy as mushy.  I didn't like the consistancy of the bread crumbs in the meat at all.  The flavor was good, but the mushiness didn't work for me.

Tried this months ago and got rave reviews on being tasty and juicy.  The leftovers were gobbled up the next day or two!  I'm grilling them again tonight for my family.

I enjoyed this version of hamburgers very much.  I only gave it a four because I changed up the recipe just a little - used oregano, garlic powder and onion powder, along with italian flavored breadcrumbs.  It helped make my ground chuck burgers very juicy rather than dry, as they usually are.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Awesome Burgers!! I bbq'd it for me and my Boyfriend (who is also a picky eater), we both agreed they were the best we've ever had. I  used the egg yolk instead of the whole egg, added a little bit of chili power for some kick, threw it on a bun w/ some cheese, onion and bbq sauce, and abra-cadabra you got an awesome hamburger!

great basic recipe. it leaves room for anyone to do their own spin of seasonings. i took the advise of some of the reviewers and used fresh bread crumbs. i'm glad i did.

Next time I will use beef with a higher fat content, and fresh bread crumbs. They came out a little "meatloaf-y" but I think it was the meat I used. They were still yummy!

I didn't feel like making burgers, so I made this into a meatloaf.  I thought it turned out really good.  Next time I'll make the hamburgers!

good burgers but it was a little too much bread with the crumbs and the bun.

We just made these camping and everyone loved them. My brother said "These are the juiciest hamburgers I've ever had. What are they called?" Wonderful.

It was good but not "outstanding".  If I usethis recipe again, I will double all of the ingredients except for the meat to give it some more flavor.  Also, I bet a diced whole jalapeno seeds and all would be GREAT in this...

This makes hamburgers really juicy, but mine kept falling apart on the grill. Next time I think I'll add more bread crumbs to help patties stay together.

We love this recipe! Regular hamburgers have taken a back seat to these great burgers! I've changed some of the seasonings for a different flair & each time they have been devoured with raves!

Tried the once and i thought they were pretty good. Does need more of a kick but they were juicy. Going to keep looking for the worlds best hamburger, but unitl then this will do with a few more ideas like the liquid smoke and other ideas.

These burgers turned out pretty good.  I broiled mine in the oven instead of grilling.  Next time I am going to grill them.  I think broiling them dried them out a bit.  Very good taste!
