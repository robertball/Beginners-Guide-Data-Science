I made this with Splenda. I don't have an ice cream maker so I buzzed this in my blender and froze this in a freezer container until it was solid, then reblended it and froze it again. Very good! My kids and I really liked this.

I made as directed and then thought to myself why not use "vanilla" yogurt instead of making plain yogurt vanilla. This was ok and good at the soft-serve consistency and had a very strong yogurt flavor (which is ok, it is yogurt) but this is nothing more than a block of hard frozen solid yogurt when allowed to ripen in the freezer (I did overnight) leaving me to wonder why I went through the process of using an ice cream maker.  I know to leave it sit out for a bit to soften but you get the same results if you place a container of yogurt in the freezer stiring it a few times before it freezes to a solid and serving before that frozen solid state.

Awesome! I thought it was delicious and very comparable to fro-yo served at restaurants.I also didn't have an ice cream maker so I just froze it in the freezer.   I made the recipe as it stated and I think next time I will use less sugar for a more tart flavor

I make mine with honey instead of sugar. You can't tell a difference in the taste, and it ends up with this beautiful, golden tint to it. You don't have to have an ice-cream maker. Just stir it up well and freeze overnight. I like to satisfy my sweet tooth with this easy, healthy treat! Yum!

I used 1/4 cup of light sugar (Dominos sugar and stevia mix).  Also added 2T of vodka to prevent freezing too hard. It came out nice and tart, almost as good as Trader Joe's plain frozen yogurt.  I used a Cuisinart ice cream maker, and it was ready much faster than regular ice cream.

Very good. I saw a review that said it froze too hard, but that cook also indicated using vanilla yogurt instead of vanilla extract. That's fine, but the point of adding vanilla extract is that because it's booze, it won't freeze rock hard.  I've also made this with Skyr and it's good and obviously, less sweet. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used frozen fruits, and there was no reason to add sugar, so I left it out.  Was great!

Ideal vanilla fro-yo.  Tastes exactly like you expect it should. Sweet enough yet not too sweet and perfect vanilla flavor.  Simple recipe is very easy to make with my Cuisinart ice cream maker and retained a nice soft consistency after many hours in the freezer.

I had some chocolate chip cookies that weren't up to my standards..I crushed them up fine in the food processor and added Greek vanilla yogurt, a drizzle of vodka and a little Truvia granular sweetener.
I was following instructions of other reviewers. I froze the mixture and then gave it a spin in the processor and refroze it.  Oh, Yummm!

Delicious and easy.  This is a game changer.  I made this using organic Greek yogurt from Costco.  This was so delicious and healthful that I will be making our frozen yogurt desserts home made from now on.

Yum! Easy and so good! I used homemade yogurt because the batch was huge so I wanted to use some up. We had to wait quite a while for it to thaw enough to be able to scoop and eat it though.

Super easy.  I make my own yogurt in the instant pot and then use that to make up this frozen yogurt.  The vanilla is great, but my favorite variation is to replace the vanilla with orange juice and a little zest (a couple of oranges worth, not just a tsp.).
