Excellent and so easy! We used, zuch, squash, red onion, mushrooms, red and orange bell peppers & asparagus. We put everything in a plastic bag as directed, but used a full tablespoon (instead of 3/4) of seasoned salt. We let the veggies marinate for about an hour before grilling. We put everything except the zuch & squash in a grill basket. The zuch & squash we put directly on the grill grate. Grilled for about 20 minutes total and this was delicious!

Omigosh, this was so good.  Used red onion, zucchini, red bell pepper, and some carrots fresh from the garden.  So simple; SO delicious!

Beautiful dish!!!! I loved the simplicity of this dish and the "wowing" presentation. Made a Wednesday night dinner very special. I also added fresh minced garlic and black pepper. I also eyeballed all of the seasonings. Went great with some grilled meats.

I prepared this yesterday as a side dish for our grilled steaks. I wasn't as impressed with it as I had hoped to be. It seemed as though it was a bit lacking in flavor. It certainly is pretty inpresentation and I will give this another shot with some added spices.

Excellent! I love Lawry's SeasonAll Salt  (don't buy anything else...it just won't compare) so I knew I'd like this but I figured it would need something-something. Nope! It was perfect. I used zuchinni, squash, red onions, & yellow bell peppers, cooked them in a grill basket (it'll help w/ flare-ups caused by the oil marinade) & I did marinate for about an hour first. Definite repeater!

We sprinkled just a little olive oil on the veggies and sprinkled a lot of Club House Vegetable Spice on zuchinni, green and red peppers, red onion, snow peas, asparagus and sliced mushrooms then cooked them in a grill basket.  We eat these at least once a week.  Leftovers are great in a pita the next day. We have even used the leftovers in scrambled eggs for a delicious healthy breakfast.

Delicious!! I used portobella chucks, zucchini chunks, and summer squash chunks and it was so yummy! I also added some parmesan cheese to the oil and seasoning salt. I was planning to use the grill basket but decided to just put them in a sealed aluminum foil pouch and toss them on the grill for about 15 minutes.  Afer they were done I made them into a sandwich with some jarlsberg cheese and tomato mayo on homemade focaccia...mmmmm!  Perfect! Like something served in a restaurant!

This was really delicious!  I added some garlic powder and parsley to the mix and it was even better.  Even my relatives who don't like squash ate it up!!

These turned out wonderful, used different fresh veggies, then mixed them all together and topped with a tad of butter.  Thanks for the post.

I used a little less oil, and everything turned out very good.  Tossed in some whole garlic cloves with the veggies for another kick of flavor.
