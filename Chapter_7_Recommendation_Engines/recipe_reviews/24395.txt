Sorry but my family will not go for this one! I anticipated a yummy dinner tonight and instead I have a crock pot full of tasteless mush---must order pizza now.

I too thouht this looked like a good recipie.  After reading the reviews I made a few changes.  First, I added pepper to the recipie.  Secondly, I cut down the amonut of flour to 1-1 1/2 tablespoons.  My soup was not mushy, I do think the pepper in the recipie added a lot of flavor.  I suggest you try this recipie with the alterations.  I'm guessing putting to much flour in the recipie makes it mushy after cooking all day.

I would recommend adding the milk and flour at the end of the cooking time instead of the beginning.  Mine floated to the top and then looked kind of gross when I tried to stir it back in.  Also, next time I will use half as much wild rice.  It soaked up all the liquid and I had to add more water.  I will also try adding carrot and celery next time.  I liked the subtle flavor and the way it made the whole house smell good.  All in all, this was a keeper.  I will be making it again, but with some modifications.

Flavorless, unless you like the taste of wallpaper paste, flour and water.  I added herbs and spices, but couldn't get that slow-cooked, flavor enhancing blend of flavors.  I even topped it with grated cheese but it wasn't a keeper. The remainder went down the disposal.

This soup is easily 5 stars with the alterations I've made. I followed the recipe as above, but cut the amount of flour in half and left the skins on the potatoes. From then on, I:
- put frozen chicken breasts in and diced them later.
- added a can of green beans
- added some garlic
- added sliced carrots
- added some frozen peas I had
- added parsley, rosemary, savory, salt, and pepper - all to taste.

After cooking for 6 hours it was ready to serve. It was delicious, 5 star material. Looking back, the only thing I might change would be to add the rice later on as it had all but turned to a mush. But on the other hand, it added to the overall thickness of the soup which I enjoyed. I think if you make the alterations as I have you'll find this soup to join your list of favorites!

This looked like an excellent recipe to me.  I love using my slow cooker for soups and I had some wonderful white meat to make it with.  HOWEVER, it was tasteless, and I did not like the consistency.  Sadly I ended up tossing the whole thing!  Sorry to have wasted the money and energy.  It was easy to make but not worth it!

I don't think the recipe needed flour; at the end of four hours, the flour had floated to the top.  I cooked the soup in the crock pot for four hours, and when I came back to it (someone else was around to stir) there was no broth, but that may be because our crock pot cooks a little hot.  I liked the milk and I think it would be better if there were carrots, celery, etc. and seasoning.

Very bland --  I could tell from the recipe it would be bland, and even added spices to make it less so, but to no avail.  I had the same problem as another reviewer with there not being enough liquid.  The rice expanded so much that I had to transfer half the soup to another crock pot, which was a big mess.  My step-daughter liked it, but it made so much (about a gallon), I don't think she's going to be able to eat it quickly enough and I expect I'll have to throw out half of it -- waste of good chicken breast, potatoes, and wild rice.  Won't make it again.

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but it was way too thick for my taste. I added a can of chicken broth at the end.  My husband and I just loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

I liked the diversity of this recipie. I made it in the crock pot.  I didn't cook the chicken ahead of time, but sitting in the crock pot all day, when I came home I had a delicious meal.  My family was impressed. Try it I bet your family will like it too!

This recipe did look very basic and possibly tasteless so I used "zataran's" new orleans stlye long grain and wild rice(instant flavor). I omitted the boillon but added a large pinch of garlic powder. I didn't use potatoes because my husaband is allergic and there is enough starch but I threw in some mushrooms. It was very, very good but not absoluotely incredible.

Very simple.  I did not add rice.  I just could not fathom potatoes and rice in the same dish.  Since I had potatoes I wanted to use up, potatoes it was.  I also did not not precook the chicken.  It went in raw and actually still a hint frozen.  I added the cream at the end and also the Wondra (in place of flour).  Tasted fine.  Not over the top, not bad.  Just a nice easy meal.

I hardly ever prepare a recipe exactly as suggested. This was no exception. It seemed like a rather bland recipe, so I added the same seasonings I would use for my Italian herb chicken. I would definitely decrease the amount of rice or increase the amount of water because what we ended up with was much more like stew or hotdish than soup. Other than that, my family thought it was okay... not great but okay.
