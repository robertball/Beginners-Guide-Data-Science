I didn't really care for this smoothie.  I found that the peanut butter taste was overwhelming.  Don't get me wrong, I love peanut butter.  But not in this smoothie. The only thing I liked about it was the beautiful purple color.

I loved this smoothie!
I added some oats and spinach to this recipe and it was amazing!

I would totally make this again.
