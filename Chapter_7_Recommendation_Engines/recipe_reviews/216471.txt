The original recipe had 2-3 Pinches of brown sugar, I edited the original recipe and contacted AllRecipes about editing this version since I cant seem to edit it myself.   Hope everyone enjoys it!

This recipe sounded wonderful to me, but I was disappointed.  The sliced orange imparted a rind flavor to the pineapple and meat, and the roast gave up a lot of liquid that diluted the flavors.  If I do this recipe again I willl have to peel the orange before slicing.

I had a bunch of friends from work.  We all work at night clubs in the city, so anything you can do with alcohol is, of course, a win.  This was delicious!  Easy to make, and makes you look like an amazing cook.  I coupled with spiced mashed potatoes.  I'm gonna add brown sugar next time and try it with a ham.

I felt challenged by all the bad reviews...I mostly followed the recipe, though I started by pan searing and seasoning with salt and pepper.  I peeled and sectioned the oranges and used a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I paired this with coconut basmati rice...it was a sweet dish.  All I was missing was a pina colada!

This got 4 stars from me, as I altered it a bit. I loved cooking w/ alcohol, and using spiced rum was a first for me, but I went with it - thinking rum drinks are sweet, and so I went for a sweet dish. I cooked the roast in a 6 quart crockpot for 6 hours w/ the liquid and brown sugar suggested. But I also added white onion, cubed raw sweet potatoes, chopped carrots, and the pineapple rings. It came out very nice and sweet, and the aroma was fantastic. I couldn't say I tasted the rum, but I think the combo came out very good. My 3 year old loved it, and I have plenty of leftovers for lunch/dinner this week!

Like others, I wanted 2 love this and it sounded delicious since I love pineapple and spiced rum. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I had hoped. I did exactly what the recipe said but the flavors of the pineapple, rum and sugar never really came through (and I poked the pork A LOT) and it just ended up tasting like just plain old pork. Some salt and pepper over it with rice made it edible but nothing special.

I thought thia recipe was very interesting. I read the other reviews and made some changes. I used fresh pineapple, peeled the orange and brined the roast  with a clove, spice based brine prior to the final cooking. It turned out moist, very flavorfull. Nice pineapple aftertaste. I will make this again. Thanks for a different take on boring pork roast.
