This is a great meal on a cool night. I will saute onions, carrots, celery, and potatoes next time and then let them boil together after adding the broth for quite awhile longer to make sure they all get tender. I also added fresh mushrooms and I highly recommend it. I felt they added a lot to the soup. Some frozen peas at the end was nice as well. Give it a try!

Just a great hearty soup.  Next time I will add more potato and onion.  I went a little heavy with the celery, I will cut that back a bit.  You really should try this one.

GREAT Soup, I serve it every Christmas Eve and we love it!  I use more potatoes and cheese like the other reviewer said and it helps to steam the veggies first.

Fantastic! used regular onion, sauteed onion,celery,carrots and potatoes all at once.. used 4 cups of cheese, added more garlic, and then pureed at the end. Even the kids loved it. good way to hide vegetables from them.

So darn good!  I incorporated a few suggestions from other reviewers & I bet either way this recipe is fantastic.  I did increase potatoes to about 4 or 5 (they were pretty small).  I used beer to just cover what potatoes the broth didn't.  I added an extra cup of cheese.  I sauteed the onions in olive oil for a bit & then added the carrots.  And the carrots... I tried using my new food processor to chop them & I somewhat shredded them by accident.  But it really worked for us!  My 5yr old had 3 1/2 good size bowls.  We all loved it!

Great recipe, but steam the vegetables first and throw in some cubed ham.  We used vidalia onions and sauteed the onions and celery before adding to the soup.  The cheese base is SUPER delicious - you MUST try this!

Delicious!  Unfortunately, I used generic store-bought shredded cheddar cheese and it caused lots of cheesy lumps (despite adding it very slowly).  Everything else about the dish was fantastic, though: be sure to get quality cheese.

Make it 5 star by replacing some of the broth with a can or bottle of beer of your preference.  Mince your carrots, celery & onion very small and skip the potatoes. The alcohol in the beer will boil off while the veggies are cooking.  Don't boil once you add the cheese.  Garnish each serving with some popcorn.  Yummy!!!  I don't like beer but I sure love this soup!

Tasty.  Easy to adjust calories if desired by switching out low-fat milk and/or cheese.

Very hearty and satisfying potato soup!!  Steamed the carrots and onions in the micro first (didn't have celery) before saut√©ing in margarine.  Added extra potato and cheese just because I had it.  Delicious!!!!

I'm the recipe's creator and over the years, this recipe has evolved.  I now make the rouxe beforehand and then heat.  I use Vidalia onions.  I steam my carrots and potatoes and then add to the soup once they're tender.  I only use Sargento Cheese, and more of it.

I did, I'm the one who came up with the original recipe and thanks to the taste tests on others, I will be reposting with the new changes which, btw, improve the soup by FAR.

This didn't do it for me either. It's just bland, and maybe I didn't make the roux thick enough, but I did add broccoli which seems to be the only good thing about it.
