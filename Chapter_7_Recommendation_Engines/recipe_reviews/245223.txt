I was looking for a new Christmas cookies and tried this --- it's a keeper. Used regular margarine. I ground some sea salt and added a pinch on top of each cookies as I pulled it out of the oven and the cookie was cooling on the sheet. Rather than topping with sea salt before baking. I'm debating whether to add a small drizzle of caramel topping on top but not really necessary.

There is something off about this recipe or maybe its because it is made with margarine....cookies did not spread. Only spread on last tray because I flattened them before putting them in the oven. Have made butter-based cookies with much better results. Still they taste quite nice

Amazing cookies. Try eating these directly out of the freezer game changer. We actually freeze all of them immediately after cooled even to have our first cookies later that day.
