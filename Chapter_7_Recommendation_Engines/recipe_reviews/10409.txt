Well these were certainly rich and delicious. The only problem I had was cutting them artfully. The toffee made them quite brittle and a real challenge to look nice. Out of curiosity, I researched other Millionaire Shortbread cookie recipes and all the others had a soft caramel layer instead of the brittle toffee. I will definitely try the more common recipe but I will keep this in my YUM box . Thanks for sharing!
