WOW!  These are great!  So easy and really delicious!  My family loved them!  Instead of 12 mini biscuits, I made 6 regular-sized ones (didn't have a mini pan), and they still turned out perfect.  Also, I lined the muffin tin with cupcake wrappers to save on clean-up and that worked great.  Very yummy and easy - I will definitely be making these again!!

These tasty little morsels are perfectly rich and decadant for a ladie's tea or lunch, next to a bowl of lobster bisque or a nice soup.  I didn't set out to make these light, but, what I had on hand was a stick of Lite Butter, and a container of fat free Greek Yogurt.  I used 1 cup of Baking Mix, 1/2 cup of Fat Free Greek Yogurt (for those of you who don't have it, it's just very thick yogurt with no flavors of any kind), and 1/4 cup of Lite Butter.    Every fibre of my soul told me NOT to melt the butter because all the TV chefs harp on "cold butter, cold butter" all the time, to make biscuits and scones light and fluffy. So, I just cut it in the baking mix until crumbly, and then added the yogurt and only combined until mixed. I rolled little balls in my hands and placed in the mini muffin tin. They rose up high, proud, and sizzled in butter (oy vey, none needed at the table!).  I can see making these with garlic butter and parsley, for a savory biscuit very much like thoe you get at a restaurant.

Oh. My. 
These are SO great! And so easy! Perfect for those short on time but want to bring something mouth-watering to the breakfast table. 
The sour cream and butter make these tasty morsels positively divine! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't feel there was anything "out of balance". 15 minutes was just the perfect amount of time for the mini muffin tin. 
Perhaps next time I'll use a lite sour cream or fat free yogurt and some sort of butter substitute, just to experiment with a "lighter" recipe.  
But for those who don't care about such trifling matters, trust me--stick to the recipe just the way it is.

Perfectly delicious! I was making sausage biscuits and gravy tonight when I realized I didn't have any biscuits. I looked on here and found this recipe. I too made 6 larger "muffin" biscuits. They were perfect with the sausage and gravy. We're having company tomorrow night and I'm going to add fresh basil and parmesan cheese to go with spaghetti. Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh yum!  These were so good.  They were very easy to make.  I added some grated parmesan cheese and italian herbs to the mix.  After they were baked, I brushed the tops with melted butter and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!!

I doubled recipe and made in a 12-count muffin pan. Very tasty, like a 'fluffy' shortbread cookie. Did not puff up hardly at all, so even in the bigger muffin pan there were cute little sized. Great with butter & jam, but not for breakfast sandwiches: too small and too crumbly, for that.

Awesome as is, don’t change anything. I’ve made these  too many times to count in both mini and regular size muffin pans and they always come out moist and soooooo yummy!!! My family requests these gems regularly and I love how quick and easy the recipe is. Using salted butter and regular sour cream turn out the best for us. Can be served with just about anything and we prefer over biscuits. THANKS FOR POSTING :-D

Okay, WOW! I was totally expecting these to be somewhat bland...but they were great! I was going to add some herbs, but decided to do what I normally do and stay true to the recipe the first time. I'm glad I did because they were great as is. Tender and a nice flavor! Thanks for the fabulous, EASY recipe!

Been making this recipe forever!  I always DOUBLE the recipe and add 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I bake for 12 minutes and they turn out great!  DELICIOUS with strawberry jam! I have served them as an appetizer or great with soups.  If you are lucky enough to have any leftovers, they can be refrigerated and microwaved for a few seconds!  A real crowd pleaser - very addictive!!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. The only issue I have with the recipe as printed is that there is no way this is 12 servings - nobody could possibly eat only one of these delicious morsels. Thanks very much!

Wow, it just doesn't get any easier than this...and tasty, too.  Cooked perfectly in 12 minutes.  So many options to vary the flavor by adding cheeses, bacon, herbs, etc.  This one is going into my Favorites folder.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these heart-healthy with Heart Smart Bisquick, light sour cream, and Smart Balance, and they were light, delicious, and fast. I am always amazed at how good a Bisquick biscuit tastes, but the sour cream made them so tender. My husband loved them and did not miss the calories.

Great, quick biscuits! Added a bit of garlic and onion powder, a touch of shredded cheese, and made 6 larger muffins instead of 12. So light and fluffy. Thank you for a keeper recipe!

These are quick and easy with a good flavor, and I usually like to use the exact ingredients when I first make a recipe but I didn't have any butter or margarine in the house, used it all yesterday making toffee.  I read another review that substituted half the butter with olive oil so I used all olive oil instead of the butter and they came out good, and a lot more heart healthy.  However, 425 is way too hot to bake these, stick with 350 or 375.

I've been making these for YEARS! The best baking mixes to use are the ones with flakes of shortening in them, and always make sure to melt the butter... I know, I know, for buttermilk biscuits you'd never do this, but in this recipe.. trust me. For something different, I add cheddar cheese, and old bay.

Three ingredients - delicious flavor with a nice texture.  I ended up with 18 mini muffins from this recipe.  I served these with 'Cheesy Ham Cups' and 'Country Style Fried Potatoes'.  I made these as written and they were delicious.

I wanted to make breakfast to freeze for school days but I was out of milk. This saved my day. It was fast, easy, and yummy! Before adding sour cream, I combined bisquick with cold butter using a large fork but not mixing it too thoroughly...used a cookie scooper.

Easy for sure.  These had a very light taste to them. I liked them plain w/o any butter or jam on them. I think for those who want you could easily punch up the flavor with some herbs or cheese.  I will make these again.

Super dry and tasteless. I'm sorry. I made a second batch and cooked for less time and those were less dry but still lacked much flavor.

I made these last night and boy are they good!  And yes, a snap to make!  Even though I did not have bisquick on hand. I used a simple substitution of 1 C flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 Tblspn crisco shortening.  The combination of melted butter, shortening and sour cream make these absolutely delectable!  My husband was convinced they had cheese in them and he loved them too!  I'll go to this recipe often!  Thanks for sharing!

SO good!  I don't usually make biscuits, but wanted something different at dinner so I gave these a try and they were great!  I made a batch of plain ones (using reduced fat bisquick) and then used the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning and 1/4 cup italian cheese blend for a fun twist -- both were awesome!

I used Belgian Waffle Mix instead of biscuit mix and they were deelish.  I am going to use this again with the specified mix and compare the results.

I love having an easy go-to biscuit recipe that uses three ingredients that I ALWAYS have on hand. These biscuits came out great! For savory dinner biscuits, I used 1T salted & 3T unsalted butter, added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning, and 1/4 cup italian 4 cheese blend shredded cheese to the mix. This makes 6 regular size muffins which is perfect for the two of us. Thank you for this recipe!  :)

They are so very cute and easy to make as well.  If you have a little leftover sour cream to use up before it expires, this is a great recipe because it is fast and the biscuits go with about anything. I like the mini muffins for small hands that need to pick them up.

Best eaten fresh out of the oven (after it cools a little). The biscuits were nothing to rave about, but it is simple and easy to make when you want biscuits.

These are great, and can be changed up by adding herbs, cheese, etc... or orange rind and topped with glaze.  Mine made 15 mini muffins. Quick and easy!  Thanks!

These little things are great. Perfect with a bowl of soup, chili or for a quick breakfast. Thank you for the recipe, Sara. My family loves them!! (A dab of honey after they're bakes...hmmmm. Just a thought.)

Mine came out a wee bit dry, but I was a little bit short on the sour cream so probably my fault. I added a homemade blend of Italian seasoning to this. Tasty little bites to serve with soup.

I don't know how to review these really, because I made a ton of additions.  I'm sure they'd be great on their own.  I added garlic, rosemary, parsley and oregano to the baking mix before cutting in the butter, and finely shredded cheddar cheese.   Made them for a church luncheon.  They were wonderful and everyone who tired them loved them.

These need 10 stars!! I had only a few minutes to make a bread, so I tried these for the fist time. I put a little parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil in. I got about 12 reg. size muffins out of 2 batches. Baked about 30 minutes. I will treasure this recipe!

I used reduced fat Bisquick, reduced fat butter (Can't Believe It's Not Butter), and fat free plain yogurt. They came out pretty good. I left the butter cold and cut it in because that is what makes a flaky biscuit. I doubled the recipe and cooked in a regular size muffin tin for 15 minutes. I added 1/4 Parmesan cheese (diced cheddar would be better), garlic powder and sage. I suggest a pinch of salt. Served with Ham and Bean Soup.

These were great.  I had to cook them on a lower temp 350 for about 35 minutes.  I thought they were a little sweeter then I would like.  So next time I would add a little salt.

This is by far the best biscuits I've had besides the ones you buy already made. You don't get any easier then this. You HAVE to try them. I didn't think they would taste as good as they do since they are soooo easy to make.

These were super easy to make and I did double the recipe and used normal cupcake pans and ended up with 10 biscuits.  They tasted pretty close to southern style biscuits although I found them a little on the salty side.  I'd suggest using unsalted butter if you're sensitive to salt.

I used reduced fat baking mix.  These were ok but I'm sure will be much better with the non reduced fat type.  These are quick and produce an amazing aroma in my kitchen.  Thank you for a great quick bread idea.

these came out so buttery and moist!  definitely not a "flaky" biscuit because the sour cream makes them very moist - almost a muffin sort of consistency.  i only had pancake mix so mine had a definite sweet flavor.  my family devoured these. this recipe made 8 mini muffins... filled mini muffin cups to top so that they'd have a nice muffin top to them!

Really easy, really good. I added about a 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning to a double batch. They were very well liked and I liked the small size.

I just made these, and they are amazing!!  I added a handful of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, so they'll go well with the corn chowder I made.  Rich and delicious, and so quick and easy! This will be my new go-to biscuit recipe.

Wow these were wonderful! I needed a last minute recipe to go with spaghetti. I found this and tried it. It is so simple and quick! My husband and my two little girls devoured them! I will be making these often! I didn't have a mini muffin pan so I made them as drop biscuits and spooned them out with my cookie dough scoop. I also sprinkled a little garlic powder in the dough.  They were so wonderful! I can't wait to make them again! Thanks for this recipe!

These were awesome and very quick. The great thing about them is that I didn't have any biscuit mix so I used pancake mix and they turned out great (probably a bit sweeter than ones made with a biscuit mix). I rolled the dough into balls and placed them in a muffin tin and recipie made 6 biscuits. I think that the next time I make these, I will try adding some cinnamon chips just for fun.  Thanks!

The quicker the easier the better! A great way to add a little flavor is to use those little containers of galic butter you get with pizza..sooo good!

This were so incredibley fast and had a nice taste to them.  I will make them again.  I am sure that cheese could be added easily to change these up, but they were nice as is:  good flavor and texture.  Oh, I found that they needed only 8 or 9 minutes to bake.

Oh my gosh, I love these! My four-year-old helped make them. I melted the margarine in the microwave and my daughter used a pastry brush to brush some of the melted margarine in the mini muffin cups. We mixed, we scooped (the most fun part, of course!) and 18 minutes later, we had delicious little morsels! Both of us love them, and Daddy said 'they're alright'... But he's not a big bread-eater, so we ignore his opinion on this. They took 25 minutes including baking time, so they'll definitely become a regular! Thanks so much for sharing, Sara!

o simple and so yummy!  Very tender biscuit with a nice crunch on top.  We brushed ours with melted garlic butter at service.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  It's a keeper!

These are so easy and so yummy.  Let them cool  slightly before serving. We usually only end up getting about 9 out the recipe instead of 12.

I would give it 10 stars if I could. Biscuits can't get any easier than this.  They were better than any biscuit I have ever eaten.  Will pass this on to everyone I know!

Used recipe as written, but added a bit of parsley for a savory biscuit. Made 5 reasonably sized drop biscuits, cooked for 15 mins.  Was extremely delicious! Melted in your mouth and didn't need any butter.

these are the best biscuits I have ever had and super easy to make but I did double the recipe and use a regular size muffin pan. These would be amazing with any meal especially fried chicken, YUM!

My kids thought these tasted a bit like Popeye's biscuits. They were certainly tender and buttery. To me they had a bit of a metallic aftertaste, but neither my husband or kids could taste it so it was probably just my taste buds since I'm used to making and eating stuff from scratch not a box.

Love These! Made Chicken Noodle Soup for dinner and realized while serving I didn't have rolls or biscuits to serve with it. Jumped on AR and found this recipe. They were easy, fast and tasted great. Recipe made exactly 18 minis and were done in 12 min. in my oven. Perfect. I will make these again. Thank you for sharing!

These turned out perfect. They were very yummy and were gone in a nick of time at my party last night. I liked the fact that they were bite size. It worked well with a bunch of people. Another thing I liked is that they were SO EASY to make!

Delicious and so easy!  I didn't even put them in muffin tins, I just dropped them onto a baking sheet and made biscuits and gravy. I woke up this morning with a biscuit and gravy craving but I had no milk. Most bisuit recipes need milk, the sour cream added the right touch and made them very light and delicious!

My husband and I came home from vacation and had no food.  We were looking for something quick to whip up and found this recipe on the internet.  It was a pleasant surprise.  They were so easy, and very good!  I didn't have a muffin pan, so I just dropped them onto the cookie sheet.  I think that slightly burned the bottom.  Either that, or I didn't need to cook them as long.  Even with the brown bottoms, they were still awesome!

This was great and so simple. I used the very small scoop and called it button biscuits. Everyone loved it. Next time though I'll add a small pinch of sea salt.

Delicious but rich and greasy.  My husband and I loved them, and are anxious to make different variations (with cheese, with different spices, etc.).

The easiest biscuits to make! I added a little bit of sugar to give it some sweetness. This is a really good basic recipe. Can add some garlic to make garlic biscuits, add cheddar to make cheddar biscuits.

This recipe is wonderful on all levels.  The biscuits are quick and easy, my kids can make them.  All 4 of my children and my husband request them often, especially when I make a new batch of jelly.  They are excellent.

OMGosh!  These are awesome.  I subbed 1/2 of the butter with olive oil.  I'm going to try replacing all of the butter with olive oil.  I used Heart Smart Bisquick as well.  I think I'd like to try try adding other herbs, too.  But, I'll have no problem devouring these just as they are.

I made a green chicken chile this past weekend and was looking for a quick biscuit recipe when I came across this one.  I happened to have all the ingredients in my fridge and boy am I happy that I did! I will absolutely make these again and again!!! My fiancee LOVED them and couldn't believe I whipped them up so quickly!

These are soooo yummy & super fast! Next time I will drizzle with a bit of melted butter and sprinkle lightly with garlic salt, I think they would taste somewhat like Red Lobster's biscuits.

So easy and yummy!  I don't have a mini muffin pan so I just made drop biscuits.  They were flaky and perfect for my biscuits and gravy.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper!!  I plan to add garlic and shredded cheddar next time for dinner biscuits.  This recipe has a ton of possibilities.

amazing!!  I used buttermilk just because I had it.  I also used a thyme/rosemary dry mix since I had no fresh thyme.

We did not even butter them they were so good.

I used fat free sour cream and substituted canola oil for the melted butter. You need to melt the butter anyway, so why not make it healthy! Very light and tastey. I'll definitely be making these again.

Really good simple biscuit recipe - I first made it as stated but now double it to make 12 regular muffins. These are my go to biscuits when I don't have time or want to roll out dough! You could add stuff I am sure and I will have fun with additions such as cheese, chives, bacon bits, and jalapenos. Great recipe!

These biscuits taste like your normal biscuit but they are SOOOO light and flaky!  My family loves them.  I've served them stew, sausage gravy and as a side for several other meals.

This was an easy enough recipe, but needed a boost in flavor.  They were a little too moist for a biscuit, at least to our liking.  I may try this recipe again and increase the biscuit mix a bit and put some garlic seasoning in it.

These were AWESOME!! I was looking for a fast and easy biscuit, and boy did these do the job. They were perfectly crusty on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside. LOVE THESE BISCUITS. I did double the recipe purely cuz I know that it wouldnt be enough for my family. They loved them!

I give these a 3 star with potential.  If you want a plain, simple biscuit, then make these.  They weren't bad, I was just hoping for more flavor and thought the sour cream would have done "something."  I will make these again but I'll add some garlic powder or Italian seasoning or cheese or something to perk them up.

These biscuits are *just ok*.  I gave them an extra star because they are easy and FAST.  I LITERALLY looked a recipe up last minute for dinner, as in, dinner was just about done and I thought "Hmm, we need biscuits ..." ya know?  I bet they would be really nice with some herbs and cheese in them though.

These are very tasty and so easy. I doubled the recipe and made them in a flower design muffin pan and they turned out so cute. Just thick enough to not fall apart when dumping them out of the pan and you can hold them in your hands to eat them. Thanks for sharing.
