3.1.19  Today I used fresh pineapple, pineapple juice, and Cabot® Greek Low Fat Vanilla Bean Yogurt (what I had on hand) for this smoothie.  I did add some of the optional ice because we like our smoothies with a thicker consistency.  This really is an excellent base for making a variety of fruit smoothies, and this combo this morning was delicious!  A repeat for sure.

I will definitely make this again! It’s a great start to your morning! :) A bit less yogurt would be nice though.

This is a great base for smoothies.  Also, if you use vanilla yogurt (which makes the flavors "pop") omit the honey.  Thank you LKB for sharing!!
