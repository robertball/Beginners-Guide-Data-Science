Yes, I substituted Curry Powder bc I couldn't find Garam Masala.  To the onion portion, I added celery, red pepper,  tomato,  shitaki and baby bella, and button mushrooms.
Yes, I will make this again! Loved it. My husband loved it too!

Made this exactly according to the recipe and it was AMAZING! Can't go wrong with a Chef John recipe; All of our favorites are thanks to his recipes. P.S. don't omit the lime, it really transforms the sauce.

Oh and if you're like me and your local grocery store doesn't have garam masala, you can make your own very easily. I keep a batch in a re-used spice container. It's much more convenient than making more every time I need it. 

This is the recipe I use:
 Easy Garam Masala.

My first attempt at Indian food and I followed  the recipe exactly and my son who is a “food critic” said it was top notch and very authentic tasting. I was surprised it turned out so well with so many different spices in it. Will definitely make again. I also made my own Garam masala from a recipe on this sight-easy garam masala-easy to make with ground spices. One tip-either use an immersion blender or a large blender when you do the cashew cream as I used my small cuisanart  and had water all over the place! I have yet to be disappointed in any Chef John recipe I have tried.

This was so incredibly tasty!   I am convinced I no longer need to go to a restaurant.  There is no point with Chef John's meals tasting so much better.  The changes I made was to use 1 cup of water to blend the cashews instead of 2 cups.  I like my sauce a bit thicker.   Thank you Chef John, this was a real winner!  Can't believe how easy it was to throw together!

Very Delicious.  I followed the directions except for the following:  I added red peppers, sjiitake & baby bella mushrooms and celery along with the onion.  My cashew milk didn't quite turn out.  [My first time using my new processor.  Most likely user error.]  I only used 1 cup of H2O with the cashews since some of the reviews said it took quite a while to thicken up.  I like my sauce thicker.  Next time I will use coconut milk and maybe add the cashews into the mix.  I don't know if that is authtic but I think it will be delicious.  I added the extra veggies and it turned out great.  I didn't increase the liquids, I may add a little extra next time.  Over all, it was very delicious.  I served it with Garlicky Turneric Jasmine Rice and the Garlic Naan (from allrecipes).

This was amazing!  First Indian dish I have ever attempted to make.  It was easy and so flavorful!  I did marinate the meat overnight and I think that helped seal in the flavor.   This one is a keeper.  Better than most Indian restaurants I have been too! Lime and cilantro brighten it up with flavor at the end..I agree with Chef John!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, letting the chicken marinate for 6 hours. The cashew and water method is genius! It took about 45 minutes for the sauce to thicken to my liking, but that made the chicken fall-apart tender. At the 45 minute mark, I squeezed the juice of 1/2 a lime and added the green onion and cilantro. I wouldn’t change anything. Another excellent recipe from Chef John! Update: I made this a second time but forgot I did not add the salt the first time and included it the second time. It was too salty so I recommend leaving out the salt altogether. In an effort to stretch the leftovers and reduce the salty flavor, I added broccoli florets the next night. So good that I will probably add broccoli  to start with next time.

Excellent blend of flavors, spices not overwhelming. Served with broccoli, good match. I don’t care for ginger so I use a sprinkling of powdered ginger.  If the spices are off for you, try cutting back on the ginger.

I liked it a lot. I cut the salt and cayenne in half (1 t kosher salt, 1/4 t cayenne). It also made a lot of sauce, even when serving with rice. I think it could take up to 3 pounds of chicken.

So delicious that even my finicky five year old requested a second helping! I had to add more cayenne to my plate because I love spicy heat. Otherwise, it’s great as is!! I’ll definitely make this again but I’ll try a prepared curry powder next time. My grocery store didn’t have garam masala so I had to find a quick recipe for it.  It worked out but I want to experiment with a curry powder I did find.

Amazing!!! I did modify the recipe slightly. Used half the ginger (used spice bottle instead of fresh).  Used half the green onions, cilantro, & lime at the end. This was so delicious.

Very flavorful.  I will cut down the lime juice next time, aside from that. Very good!  Paired with Chef John's Garluc Naan.

This was AMAZING. I made it exactly as written and will make it again. And again. I like the heat, but for my little kids, I'll cut the cayenne in half next time.

Turned out great! I made my own garam masala loosely following another allrecipes recipe and it made my cupboard smell Indian!  Very tasty and easy to make dairy free.  I had it for dinner and served it over salsa verde doritos for an Indian-mex fusion dish.  Then I had it over plain quinoa with vegan strawberry nice cream on the side for breakfast and that was also great!

Made this exactly as the recipe was written. It was incredibly good!! As with all Chef John's recipes, they are fantastic, and this one was no exception. Wasn't sure on the cashews and water, but it works. I will add more green onion the next time (my personal preference) The lime juice really sets this off. Thank you Chef John for another five star recipe.

This is delicious. I made as is except that I was short on the chicken thighs and added large pieces of potato. Very rich and creamy. I let my cook about 30 minutes.

So, I made a LOT of changes, but my main review is of the spice selection and the amounts. I think it's a little too spicy, but the flavor is really spectacular.
I made baked tofu and used coconut milk instead of the cashew cream, but still garnished with cashews and put cashews in the curry itself. As for the tofu, it would definitely be better with chicken. The spice amounts are too heavy for tofu and there's just too much of it. That was on me. I also added a green bell pepper to the onion and I think that was a good addition. Adds some more color to the dish. 
All in all, for what I did glean from trying this, 5/5 for the recipe, 4/5 for my execution, and I'll definitely be trying it again!
Oh and the lime juice is CRUCIAL. The citrus zing is so delicious here.
