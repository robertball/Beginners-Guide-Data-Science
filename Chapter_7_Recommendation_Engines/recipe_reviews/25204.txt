Instead of 2 pounds of ground beef, use 1-1/2 pounds, decrease the bread crumbs to 1 cup, the worcestershire to 1 teaspoon, and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes. Delicious!

This was really good. I didn't have any tomato paste so I used a cup of ketchup and it turned out fine. I also added bell peppers and about 3 cloves of minced garlic. YUMMY!!!! I think this is a really good base for anyone to work with.

My family really enjoyed this meatloaf and have already ask for it again!  To add moisture and flavor I added 1/4 cup of chili sauce, 1/2 tsp. dried parsley and basil.  I baked the meatloaf to a golden brown, without the tomato sauce on top .  The last 10 minutes of baking I topped with Al's BBQ sauce.

I really liked this recipe. It was very straight forward and a lot like I would expect homemade meatloaf to be like. I made two small changes when I made it. I added 1 clove of fresh, crushed garlic. Sautee the garlic and onion together until onion is translucent before mixing with other ingredients.

This meatloaf was delicious. I added a little more Worcestire sauce and seasoned the ground beef w/ garlic powder and seasoned salt.

We really enjoyed this. The meatloaf was tender and moist. I did a tablespoon of minced garlic, two tablespoons of parmesan, a pinch of oregano and a little pepper to the tomato sauce.

I thought this meatloaf was very bland at best.  My husband liked it so I gave it 3 stars, but I would not make it again, and I followed the recipe as it was written.

This is a pretty good meatloaf recipe... I added some tomato sauce to the actual meatloaf, which made it a bit less dry. Not as good as leftovers, which was surprising.

This recipe made my meatloaf tighten up and firm for me. Which was sort of a good thing since I cooked this recipe in 2 8" round cake pans. I drained and stacked them on top of each other to create a meat cake for my father's birthday. I didn't use the cheese only because we have picky eaters in my family. I "frosted" with garlic mashed potatoes and barbecue sauce. It was a huge hit taste and novelty wise.

I work at a small restaurant and used this recipe for my 'nightly special' tonight.  It fell apart a little during the baking process but the taste was fantastic!  Customers sent back rave reviews!  The only thing I did different was use a garlic/italian season in my breadcrumbs.  Thanks for the great recipe!

for anyone that hates meatloaf... try this recipe. It's great.  I added some hotsauce and garlic.  The kids loved it.  I cranked this recipe up a notch and turned it into a cake using mashed potatoes as the "icing". Check out the pics.

The best meatloaf recipe I've come across on this site.  I took advice of others and decresed the amount of ground beef to 1 1/2 lbs.  Decreased the bread crumbs to 1 cup, the worcestershire to 1 teaspoon, and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Bake for 1 hour 30 minutes.  End result is a perfectly moist and meaty meatloaf with a delicious tomato sauce topping.

I made this but cut all measurements in half as I was making it for only two people. I also used ketchup rather than tomato sauce and cooked until 160 degrees inside. It was moist and delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

I really liked this! It was easy and quick, and pretty tasty! Not sure if I used 2lbs of meat(I didn't measure, but I DO know it was more than 1lb)and didn't use the parmesan because I am allergic to dairy... I used 1 cup ketchup instead of tomato sauce and put about 1/3 of that in the meat, not on top of it. It turned out great! Usually my family doesn't particularily like meatloaf but they enjoyed this one!

This was a very good meatloaf.  Great texture and taste.  I actually made the meatloaf and put in a 9x13 baking pan.  Surrounded it with baby carrots, some sliced onion, and baby red potatoes cut and half.  Seasoned them with salt, pepper and some garlic.  Covered with aluminum foil and baked for an hour and ten minutes. (Until vegtables tender and meatloaf done.) Family loved it. Good comfort food on cold nights!

I have made meatloaf before, but this is one of the best recipes ive used. I made a few changes and added a few things. I took out the paramsean cheese and the tomato sauce, and I added about a teaspoon of oregano and sage. I also made my own BBQ sauce (store bought is good also) and I put a layer of it on he top of the meatloaf once it was in the pan. This was an amazing recipe and everyone loved it. (Some diced garlic also gives it a good kick).

I love this recipe it is so simple and delicious!  In my favorite variation, I use whole wheat bread crumbs and onion soup mix.  This is also great to slice, cool, wrap individually, and freeze.  It is very easy to thaw single servings for packing lunches.

just made this meatloaf for dinner and I did everything exactly except I put in a little bit of garlic. I used my homemade tomato sauce. It was THE best meatloaf I've ever had and my family agreed. We think its because of the tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Great base recipe. I did as another reviewer suggested, and sauteed the onion and a couple of cloves of garlic before adding it to the mixture.

My hubby recently used this recipe the first time he ever made meatloaf. It was better than ANY I (or my mom) ever made! Gosh, was was so good! He took 1/2 of the tomato sauce & mixed that into the recipe. (I am not a fan of the tomato stuff on top, but this didn't have a gob and it was good!) He used 1 lb lean beef and 1 lb ground pork. Plus he used more 'chester sauce- 2 T.   We are keeping this one and will be sharing the recipe!

I can almost swear to this recipe. When my family tasted it for the first time,they were absolutely blown away. It was very tasteful and moist. Even if u use ketchup intstead of tomato sauce, you will still get a good flavor from this one. This recipe is one for the books, that is, recipe book :D

This was my first attempt at making a meatloaf and this is a great starter recipe. I did a few different things, and it was wonderful. I put an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce INTO the meatloaf mix, then poured one on top at the end (this was all by mistake, but it really turned out awesome). I also shredded the onion and a few cloves of garlic into the mix as well. Instead of the egg I used an egg substitute and it all worked out fine.
Again, this is a wonderful starter recipe, you can really do a lot off this meatloaf base.

I loved this recipe, and more importantly so did my fiancee who's a very fussy eater.  I added half an envelope of French Onion Soup mix.

I followed the recipe exactly, but when I began to mix everything, I found it way too dry.  I had to add one extra egg and 1/3 cup or so of skim milk.  Otherwise, the taste was fine.  If I try this recipe again, I'll probably use a couple slices of white bread (torn in pieces) in place of the bread crumbs and would probably still add the skim milk for moisture.

Well, I didn't even do a great job making this, and my family still loved it!  I didn't get the onion diced finely enough, so it was in much larger pieces than I thought throughout.  I also misread the instructions and only added 1/2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce, rather than 1/2 tbs.  This was actually my first go at meatloaf and I flipped it out of the pan wrong, so that it landed upside down, so I was relieved to find that it quickly disappeared!  I've just gotta get the onion diced properly next time so that my four year old will eat it too.

This is a great basic meatloaf recipe. My whole family loves this meat loaf. The only thing I do different is I don't use the parmesan and I add a can of tomato sause to the meatloaf mixture as well as top it with tomato sause. Thanks for the great recipe.

usually use onion soup mix recipe but this turned out just as yummy. used 2 TB of Worcestershire sauce, sauteed onion and garlic before adding to meat mix. also added garlic powder, oregano, basil, extra salt and pepper. Very yummy, moist and savory.

WOW! This was the best meatloaf I've had in a while. I cut the recipe in half, based on the amount of ground beef I was using and made a few alterations. I added 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper along with the 1/2 cup chopped onion. Instead of 1 1/2 c bread crumbs, I used 3/4 cup oatmeal & 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs. Served with Sweet peas & Rice seasoned with Cilantro & parsley. This was a wonderful meal that will be repeated. 4 starts because of the changes I made.

This is a great "comfort food" meatloaf.  I didn't have a real onion so I used onion soup mix, and I made a few changes in order to "hide" some nutritional elements from my kids.  I made bread crumbs from whole wheat toast and I mixed in some carrots that I pulverized into tiny little bits with my slap chop (love that thing!).  It turned out great!

This is a great base meatloaf recipe.  You can leave it as is and it's great or you can add your own embellishments.  I added a cup of shredded carrots to boost the nutritional value.  My husband was so excited to see meatloaf when he got home from work because it makes the best sandwiches the second day!

This was very good but a little bland.  I even used crushed garlic parmesan crostini for the bread crumbs thinking they would lend more flavor but they did not.  I will probably make again but add some herbs and spices to make it more flavorful.  I also might add more tomato sauce because as the meatloaf cooks some of it slides off into the fat that is rendered.

This is a great basic recipe for meatloaf.  It's easy because it has things in it that I always have around the house.  I don't like measuring, so I eyeballed everything and it turned out great.  I poured some of the tomato sauce on top and sprinkled some more parmesan on top to make it pretty.

This was okay.....a little bland.  Followed the recipe almost exact, with the exception of sauteeing the onions with some garlic. It wasn't horrible, but certainly didn't stand out as the tastiest meatloaf we've ever had.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars. I picked out this recipe as my daughters name is Kimberly and I made it for her and my son in law.  They said it was the best they had ever tasted.  I made a slight change.  I used cream of tomato soup instead of the tomato sauce and added a bit of minced garlic.  This recipe is a keeper.

I am giving four starts because I didn't think it was great but I changed the recipe according to some reviews.  I think it would have been better if I had stuck with the original recipe. I don't think it would be fair to rate the recipe poorly since I changed it.  However, one problem I had was that the loaves stuck to the pan really bad.  I had to cut the loaves in half so I could get a spatula under them to turn them over without them falling apart.  I used tomato sauce as someone suggested, as well as Worcestershire sauce and parmesan cheese.  The tomato sauce was the big mistake, I just did not go with the flavor of the meat IMO.  I will try this again but will use tomato soup.

Very good meatloaf...I added two cloves of garlic.  My family (including little ones!) really liked it.  Will definitely make it again.

After reading other reviews I decided to start by adding only 1 cup instead of the entire 1 1/2 C. of bread crumbs.  I'm glad I didn't put any more because it definitely would have been too dry.  I didn't really care for the flavor but my husband and daugter thought it was good.  My daughter didn't even ask for the ketchup which she usually has to have on meatloaf.  I personally would rate it a 3 but because they liked it I'm giving it a 4.

It was way too dry.  Way too many bread crumbs.  I wanted a meatloaf that didn't fall apart but this is ridiculous!  It's a solid little sucker. Ha.

This was just okay. Nothing overwhelming about it. I added a little dry homemade ranch dressing mix, for a little more flavor. I served it with The Best Mashed Potatoes from this site.

Loved this! Already made it twice. Like others, I did 1 can cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom. Mine ended up more like a pot pie. I added potatoes, green peas, carrots, and celery. I also used only 1 can of the biscuits and put that in 90 mins before it was finished. Shared this with a friend who wondered a week later if it was too soon to make again. Delish!

I wasn't very fond of this recipe. The meatloaf was not fully coooked after an hour in the oven, so I put it in a little longer and it was really dry. It was very bland too. No taste to it except for the onions. I'd recommend another recipe for meatloaf.

Great recipe! Simple and tasty. I cut it down to a recipe for 2 people using only 700g of ground beef and 1 cup of breadcrumbs and a single egg. Came out great!

Great basic meatloaf, although you will need 2 pans to hold all of the mix.  I spiced up the sauce with garlic salt and basil, and it still was a little bland.  Overall, we liked it.

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan, but I had a couple of pounds of ground beef to play with and I found this recipe. What a very nice surprise, I found Kim's recipe very easy to follow and the loaf came out very good. I like bringing a sandwich to work now and then, and the leftovers made an exceptional cold  sandwich on a hardroll.

This is a really good receipe, but I also made some changes.  Instead of 2 lbs beef, I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb pork.  Also, I added 4 cloves fresh garlic,1 tsp dried basil and pepper and instead of tomato sauce, I topped it with A-1 Steak Sauce!  Excellent and moist!!

This is a perferct base recipe for meatloaf. Instead of parmesan cheese I use this white sharp cheddar, swiss, parm blend (you can find it at most groceries in the cheese section). I top it with my grandma's homemade catsup and it is fabulous!

Very quick and easy! I used ground turkey instead and it turned out great. I also suggest adding garlic powder, some fresh minced basil and oregano for additional flavor.

I've never tried making a meatloaf before, and let me tell you this is pretty much GREAT. It was moist, even though I used lean meat, and really easy. The tomatoe paste that was at the bottom of the pan looked black so I was afraid I burned it, but everything was on point. I should have made it bigger, everybody is gonna want some! =]

This was the first meatloaf I ever tried.  I used ground turkey instead of meat and so, as my husband says, can't really call it meatloaf.  It was good, but not diner quality by any means.  Would try it again with meat, but the turkey was pretty good.

This reminded me so much of my Nana's Meatloaf; I couldn't keep from picking at it all night long with the leftovers. Quick and easy to make, I used the Italian Bread Crumbs to ensure some seasoning. Cooked it 30-minutes longer than said because it did not look done, but the meatloaf was not dry. We also downsized it for 5 people, but I used the whole can of tomato sauce. Will serve many times again!

I'm picky about meatloaf, but I will be making this again (I don't think I've EVER said that about ANY meatloaf recipe).  I made the following changes:  1.5 lbs ground chuck (instead of 2 lbs); 1 cup dry bread crumbs (instead of 1.5 cups); 1 teaspoon Worcestershire (instead of 1 TBSP); added 1/4 teaspoon black pepper; added 1/3 cup milk; added 1 teaspoon salt; added 3 cloves minced garlic.  I also baked it 1.5 hours.  The whole family liked it (which is so unusual, as most of the time at least one person doesn't like what's for dinner).  It was also good warmed up as a leftover (although there wasn't much left).

I made this meatloaf the night before and then reheated it in the oven the next day. While it was still great, it took just as long or longer to warm it in the oven as it did to cook it. But other than that it is my new meatloaf recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe! It is quick and easy. I too use 1 cup of Ketchup and sprinkle the top with a just a little bit of italian seasonings and garli powder, just to give it a little zip. It is so moist, excellent 30 minute dinner choice!

I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I left it out. I also made the mistake of mixing the ketchup in with the ground beef. Amazingly, it still turned out delicious! I used my dad's trick of putting some bread down under the meat to absorb some of the oil, which helped a lot. I just threw that part out, and everyone enjoyed the meat loaf!

I like the texture/consistency of it.  However, this was a bland recipe (it would have been utterly bland had i not added salt and pepper - which the recipe does not call for - and also had i not topped it with ketchup insteat of just tomato sauce.  I could use this recipe for meat-to-eggs-to-bread crumb ratios then run trial and errors with different seasoning/spices and veggies for add-ins. I gave it 3 stars instead of 2, because 2 means 'disliked'.  i did not dislike it, but i did not like it (if that makes any sense).  So i give it 2 1/2 stars.  ***I hope this does not hurt the feelings of the person who gave the recipe.  i simply want to give an honest assessment for my personal review later***  That being said...thank you for the recipe.

I made this and followed the instructions to the letter.  I was expecting a bland outcome that I would be seasoning on the dinner plate, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was flavorful and juicy.  
I highly recommend this meatloaf.

Sorry I didn't like this at all, way too dry ( for my liking anyway ).
I know how careful we can all be with regards to fat intake but when it comes to a fairly moist meatloaf you do need some fat.
As in all meats it's the fat that imparts the flavour,
