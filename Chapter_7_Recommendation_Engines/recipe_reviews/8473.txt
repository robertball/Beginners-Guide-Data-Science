My family thought it was ok...it was VERY buttery...too buttery for me. I don't think I would ever use this recipe again.

Fantastic frosting.  I used a whole tub of cream cheese with the other ingredients and it tasted really creamy, went on the cake very smooth, will use again

I used this on a banana cake. I didn't have margarine so i went ahead and used butter. Really buttery and melted quickly at room temperature. But tasted great as a whole!

this was a decent frosting for my low fat carrot cake. i found it a little too margarine-y, especially the smell, but it tasted much better on the carrot cake then it did by itself.
