A definate winner, everyone loved it and said it was the best salad they had ever had.  Just watch how much you eat the fat content is HIGH

i sometimes use shredded carrots and broccoli. I also use green onions. This is my Aunt Mary's traditional holiday salad, you can't go wrong with this one. Put it in a trifle bowl, looks great.

This is my husband's favorite salad & I had not made it in years because I lost the recipe. Now it is in my cyber-file & ready for those hot summer nights. Thanks!

This was a nice salad and looked very pretty in the bowl. I think next time though I am going to add something to flavor the mayo a little bit.

This is great!  I used only 1/2 lb. bacon because I used turkey bacon (no extra fat to drain off, so you have more bacon).  As a time saver, I used a bag of ready-to-eat chopped Romaine lettuce.  I subtituted 1/2 cup sliced green onions instead of a regular one (for milder taste - just a personal preference), 1 chopped red bell pepper instead of peas (to give it color), no cheese (to lower the fat), and 3/4 cups reduced fat Ranch dressing insead of mayonnaise.  Layered with lettuce , cauliflower, red bell pepper, green onions, turkey bacon, and dressing.  It's key to let this sit overnight so that the flavors meld.  Thanks for the recipe!
