Finally! A veggie lasagna I like.  I added thawed and drained frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture (what is lasagna without spinach?), and I also followed other suggestions and added about 3/4 cup each of finally chopped carrot, broccoli, and zucchini.  It was great. This recipe has become my mainstay for veggie lasagna. Thanks!

I love the basic concept of this recipe, but did make a few changes.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, I loaded up on additional veggies such as chopped spinach as well as shredded zucchini, yellow squash, and carrots.  Instead of making one large tray, I divided into 10 small bread pans for individual portions and froze half of them for later quick meals.  L-o-v-e-d this....

This was excellent! I was VERY skeptical when I was making this because my family are total carnivores but honestly we didnt miss the meat at all. I read a lot of the reviews and made the following modifications: I used 1/2 a box of lasagna noodles. I reduced the mushrooms from 1 pound to 8 oz,in addition to the green bell pepper I added 1 large carrot shredded, and 1 medium sized zucchini chopped. I sauteed all of this & added 1.5 jars of spaghetti sauce (which I doctored up w/ season salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, sugar & fresh basil etc to taste.) I layered like this: sauce in the bottom of pan, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture -- which I added dry parseley to (approximately 1/2 tablespoon) and then I did a light layer of fresh chopped spinach and then the suace mixture and I repeated that. I topped mine w/ mozzarella instead of parmesan. It was really good. My changes SEEM like a lot but they are really small nuances that I added so my family would love.  They didnt even realize the amount of veggies they were eating. Everyone loved it. I made meatballs on the side for an extra but didnt even need them.

This is a decent base recipe, but the proportion of the ingredients I felt was way off. A whole package of lasagna was way too much. I used 12 noodles total. I also felt 2 jars of pasta sauce would have totally drowned this lasagna, and I am a huge sauce fan and tend to use more than others. 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 was more like it. It also lacked spice, and I added several spices to the veggies while cooking them (garlic salt, onion powder, onion salt, garlic salt, parsley). I also used different veggies since I hate mushrooms: 1 red pepper, 1 onion, 1 zucchini and 1 package of microwaved frozen chopped spinach. I'm always trying to lighten things up a bit so I used reduced fat (not fat free) cheeses and only used 1 egg and it was really good.

this was totally great. Added spinach, celery, zucchini, stewed Italian style tomatoes and a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce; with the extra liquid it was able to simmer longer so the flavor really developed. Everyone at dinner loved it.

I think the result of this recipe really depends on the spaghetti sauce. I made the mistake of using a generic brand sauce, which made this dish only average. Will use homemade or quality sauce next time!

This lasagna was delicious!  I am not usually impressed with vegetable lasagna, but this recipe had a great taste.  I left out the mushrooms, and reduced the amount of mozzarella because of cholesterol consciousness, and still the recipe was fantastic.  This recipe is just as tasty made in advance and baked for 1/2 the time and refrigerated for up to 3 hours; then cook the other 1/2 time just before you serve it.  I tried this so I could spend time with my company instead of being tied to the kitchen, and it worked well.

Very delish! And healthy. You can use just about any veggies you want. I used portabella mushroom, carrots, fresh baby spinach, red onion and bell pepper. I tossed all my veggies together in a bowl with some fresh parsley and minced garlic, then spread them out on a baking stone and roasted them in the over at 400 for 25-30 min. The veggies had a nice crisp still to them and not too mushy that way but it was enough to remove the moisture that can make your lasagna soupy, then I just layered the sauce, veggies without mixing them together. Oh I made my own tomato sauce and made it chunky with some diced tomatoes.

Excellent, very tasty.  I served it to my family and dinner guests.  Served with garlic bread and salad.
I used 1 package of frozen chopped spinach and 3 zucchini instead of the peepers and mushrooms.  It was a hit, but the children - some liked it and some didn't.  I followed other suggestions, added extra ricotta and used a larger pan.  Also used the no boil lasagne noodles.  I'll make this one again.
It made enough for more the next day.  (I learned the hard way that I should not pre-cook Zuccini before saute.)  Used extra sauce (I like Prego).

Excellent!  This recipe really does make what is likely the best vegetable lasagna I have ever had.    I think its success is due to two main things - first, the lasagna is not "healthy" - it is merely meat-free but retains the usual cheese and eggs.  Second, the method of cooking gives the veggies just the right texture. So many vegetable lasagna recipes have you include raw or almost raw vegetables in the baking dish.  The end result is undercooked vegetables and/or watery lasagna.  I love crisp vegetables in dishes like stir-fry, but they don't work in lasagna.  I have on more than one occasion followed a recipe and included raw veggies, only to have the water in the veggies cook out and prevent the lasagna from becoming a cohesive dish... instead, it falls apart.  This recipe instead includes a rich, hearty veggie-filled sauce, avoiding the usual problem.  I only modifed a couple things - I used whole grain noodles, and olive oil.  (I cook almost exclusively with olive oil.)  I also swapped out half the mushrooms for peeled, chopped eggplant.  I chopped the eggplant into small pieces - approximately 1/2 inch cubes, and tossed them with salt to draw out water before cooking them with the other veggies.  I think the eggplant MAKES the lasagna.  I also ended up using a lot less than one box of noodles - I never use a whole box.  This lasagna is not only great vegetable lasagna, but it would hold up against a meat lasagna as well!  Also - it makes AMAZING leftovers!

This veggie lasagna was delicious!  I served it along with my own meat filled lasagna for Christmas dinner.  Hearty Vegetable lasagna was the definite winner.  My brother-in-law who NEVER eats lasagna tried some and asked for the recipie!  I varied a little by adding chopped broccoli and shredded carrots.

This recipe is fanastic!  I made it for our Christmas party and guests raved about it!  Although not recommended for those watching their diets, this would have to be one of the best lasagnas I've ever made.  I substituted the green peppers for sauteed mushrooms and zucchini, as suggested by other reviewers.  This recipe will definately be a keeper in our household!

This was delicious! I did change it, but this is a good base.  I'm always trying to make things healthier, so this is what I did:

1. Used part skim mozzarella cheese
2. Replaced all of the ricotta with organic low-fat cottage cheese
3. Made my own homemade sauce (the jarred sauces have a lot of sugar) Sauce: 5 cans organic diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup fresh basil, 2 tablespoons fresh oregano,(can used dried herbs if you don't have fresh) 1 cup carrots, 1/2 cup dry white wine, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar)
4. Put 6 cloves of garlic instead of 3.

Good and will make it again! Next time I will add a little more veggies...maybe one zuchinni and another bell pepper. It was so good that between 6 adults we finished it off in one sitting!

Love, love, LOVE it! I followed the directions, except I added some diced zucchini and shredded carrot to the sauce (sauteed them with the rest of the veggies first). I also added a box of defrosted, thoroughly drained chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture. So yummy, and a GREAT way to get the kids (and grownups!) to eat their vegetables! :)

I made quite a bit more hearty with chopped carrots, chopped zucchini, more garlic, a whole large sweet onion, and chopped red pepper. This only needed one jar of spaghetti sauce--I used an organic brand. Because I'm on a budget, I used Trim cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I also took a tip from Pioneer Woman and used deli sliced mozzerella cheese instead of shredded which made it a snap to put together (TIP: This makes for a firmer lasagna, too.). This was a good meatless dinner for us to trim down the budget a bit (and our dinner guests that don't eat meat). We all enjoyed this. Next time, I would add a little more spice--like oregano and a little red pepper flake.

Yum! I used oven-ready lasagna noodles, so the prep was really quick and easy. I subbed spinach for the green peppers, and put a little salt & pepper in the cheese mixture, but those were my only changes. It was perfect--satisfying, saucy, and cheesy. I'll definitely make this again!

Loved it!  I have turned to a new process for the lasagna noodles:  lay hard noodles on sheet pan.  Pour boiling water over to soften.  Layer as usual.  Works every time.  I also like spinach (frozen pkg. thawed & drained) in with the ricotta mix.

I used olive oil, red pepper, carrots, broccoli & spinach in the veggie mix with italian seasoning, salt & pepper. Fresh basil, salt & pepper in the cheese mix and TJ's mix cheese instead of all moz. Also the TJ's organic marinara as sauce. A little wine in the sauce and baked it _____?

This was a great recipe to start with.  I added some spinach and used some really great locally made marinara sauce, so that definitely made a big difference.  Unfortunately though, the last time I bought mozzarella at the store, I bought the fat free kind by accident.  So when I ran out of the regular kind, halfway through the recipe, I had to use the fat free kind on the top and it was just disgusting.  Reduced-fat cheese is fine, but fat free cheese is absolutely horrid.  Avoid it at all costs, as it has the potential to ruin this and pretty much any other recipe.

I make this one every now and again and every time it's better than the last time. I do agree that the proportions are a bit off. I always end up with a lasagna and a half lol but it's always delicious so I absolutely can't complain about having extra.

I made a few alterations but used this as the general guide. I took a few ideas from other posters and this is what I changed. For the sauce: no bell pepper and no mushrooms, instead I used broccoli, zucchini and carrots (3/4 c each) . I also added 1/4c red wine and an extra tsp basil and parsley, and 1/4- 1/2 tsp salt (to make up for the extra veggies). I only use 1 and a half jars of sauce so it is a little thicker. I had used summer squash in the sauce but it was better without it in case you were thinking of trying summer squash. For the ricotta mixture: I added spinach (I use thawed frozen spinach), 1 TB dried parsley and I mixed the 1/2C Parm in with the ricotta. Also, I use whole wheat noodles and only 9 noodles per batch and there isn't any cheese/sauce left over so I don't know how/if people use more than 9 lasagna noodles. People have RAVED about this lasagna and it is even better the 2nd-3rd days, after the flavors have really blended. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

I cleaned out my refrigerator drawers full of veggies I needed to use by just throwing it all in here. I also used spinach which was fantastic. Every time this lasagna is different. Delicious:D

I've made this lasagna several times and it's absolutely wonderful.  Meat lovers wont really know the difference because it is so hearty.  I add whatever vegetables I have on hand… broccoli, zucchini, spinach, carrots, etc..  Also will add a splash of hot sauce or red pepper flakes for a little kick.

This was much better than I expected! I don't really like mushrooms, so I cut that back to 8 oz. So glad I did, because even 8 oz of sliced mushrooms is a lot! I added zucchini, spinach, and shredded carrot. I added some parsley and a touch of salt to the ricotta mix, which, by the way, is great! I will add mozzarella to my ricotta mix in any lasagna I make from now on. I love a cheesy lasagna! Great recipe, very versatile! p.s. toddlers ate it up...great way to hide some veggies. :)

This was really good! I didn't have all the veggies on hand, only mushrooms, but it was still excellent. I always skip the boiling noodles step when making lasagna, though, as the noodles cook in the oven because of the sauce that surrounds them. Saves some time!

I was quickly trying to find a veggie lasagna to make for my father who is vegatarian. I normally make meat lasagna and so I used most of the ingredients on here, except since I did not have ricotta cheese, I used a homemade substitute that I usually use anyway for my lasagna. I also did not have parmesan cheese :( The green peppers, mushrooms and cheese really made this great though! I hope to make it the full recipe next time. I love parmesan cheese.

Really good.  I made this for a dinner where only one person was a vegetarian, but everybody thought it was delicious.  Even my husband joked about giving up meat after that, and he's a real cave-man!

This was awesome! I have a farmers market right down the street from me, so I've added fresh spinach, broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, roasted onions and roasted red peppers. I'm a single individual, and I usually end up making way too much. So everyone at work loves how chunky it is and the roasted red peppers really add an extra zip to it.

This was a good basic lasagna recipe, but not a "hearty vegetable" recipe. You could easily add more veggies, or sub something in place of the mushrooms. I added spinach and it was delicious. In a 9 x 13 pan I was able to use a whole box of lasagna noodles unlike some of the other reviewers. I also felt that the 2 jars of sauce IS necessary especially if you plan to have any leftovers that will be reheated. I can't imagine using just one jar of sauce, it would be really dry.

I found the recipe to be off target.If you use a fairly large size saucepan the ingredients come up to almost the top making it difficult to stir as instructed. Also I found that the vegetables released water while cooking this way that needed to be drained. The next issue was the amount of tomato sauce to use. I would use 2/3 what they recommend. I found that the ratio of sauce to vegetables was off quite a bit. I used high quality thick sauce but  using 2 jars of sauce (23oz each) was way too much. I found myself using a slotted spoon to fish out some of the vegetables an I had about 8 ounces of tomato sauce left over. If you ever make regular lasagna the meat you add to the sauce makes the sauce really thick so when you are finished cooking and cooling you can slice the lasagna and it is solid enough to retain it shape. If your sauce it too watery it is going to get really messy and wind up being more like spaghetti on your plate than a slice of lasagna. Also the recipe states use 1/2 of everything for first layer and then states noodles, sauce, cheese, and parmesan. You cannot use half of the noodles, only about 3 or four over lapped. An do not use half the sauce if you used the recommended 2  23 oz jars or you will have soup and not lasagna. Thankfully I made adjustments as I went and it came out perfect. It was delicious but could have been a disaster due to a poorly written recipe.

Just ok, but definitely worth a second try. 
I read the reviews and made sure to use great sauce, and also added some chopped spinach and zucchini.  It was pretty bland.  I think the parmesan should be added to the ricotta, that may help.  Also, maybe some fresh parsley to the ricotta?  I'm a veggie lover and would really like to work this into a great recipe!

The sauce makes or breaks this dish! Please use either homemade or really high quality store-bought sauce. I used medium-quality sauce in my recipe and I could tell. I followed the recipe as directed, and although I thought the sauce was going to make the dish too runny, it didn't at all! So don't be afraid of using two jars of sauce. I also used the oven-ready lasagna noodles, which eliminated boiling them in a separate pot. Will definitely make again!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was fun to make and very good.  After we had finished eating I made a comment about it being vegetarian and my husband was surprised.  He had not missed the meat at all.

My daughter loved this, but I need more flavor. It might be what another reviewer suggested - the sauce will make or break the recipe - I will definitely try this recipe again, I will probably season the veggies and sauce before it goes into the oven. Great recipe though, very easy and goes a long way!

Very good, but I think you need to add more veggies to make this "hearty."  I added a zucchini to the vegetables listed in the original recipe.  Also, to save time, I used lasagna noodles that didn't need to be cooked beforehand.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful! I only used 2 cups of mozzarella because that's what I had on hand and just spread that amount on the top layer of the lasagna. I added zucchini, yellow squash and only had half a pound of mushrooms on hand. I made the sauce from this site, Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce, instead of using store-bought sauce and since that recipe uses onion, garlic and green pepper, it was a great match! Oh and I also only had half a container of ricotta cheese so I substituted the rest with extra cottage cheese. Yummy! I'll be making this again and again!

This is better than meat lasagna! My kids even love it! I mince the mushrooms and add shredded carrot to the sauce, then use the idea someone posted of putting spinach in the ricotta. It's fantastic! I am making it again tonight!

I loved this recipe!  I tasted amazing, like actual lasagna, as opposed to just vegetables and cheese.  I followed the recipe pretty much, though I did use red onion, a little red pepper along with the green bell pepper, and skim mozzarella.  Yummy!

This lasagna was fantastic.  I added some things -- I mixed sundried tomatoes and spinach in with the ricotta, and also layered in some thin zucchini slices (put in a dry pan beforehand to reduce water), and also layered fresh basil leaves in.  AMAZING.  Do listen to other reviewers and be careful to use a good sauce, preferably homemade.  The dish held together so well, too, hard to find in veggie lasagnas.  I made it for 'girls night' and they are still talking about it!

YUM!!! This recipe was wonderful. I must disclose i DO NOT COOK. I have little to no experience in cooking. My husband feeds me ;). However for his birthday i wanted to cook him his favorite dish, lasagna. This recipe was easy to follow, even for me. I did however use some recommendations in the comments (thanks btw to all the suggestions). I added spinach in the ricotta mix & added zucchini & shredded carrots. I did use Segernto? Italian 6 cheese blend instead of just mozzarella & Parmesan. Even I know you can't go wrong with adding more cheese, ever. LOL We had 4 dinner guests & they all seemed to love it. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! You made my first cooking experience delightful!

I've made this dish twice now, and both times I didn't change anything, I made it as directed.. It is a good, hearty lasagna.  I'm not sure who determined portion sizes, though.  I tried to make it into 12 servings, and they were just too small.  I'd say it makes about 9.

This was the bomb!! I didn't miss the meat AT ALL. Made my own sauce, crushed tomatoes in a can, olive oil, lots of garlic, an onion, 8oz of mushrooms, 2 zuchini, 2 small carrots, some spinach in the ricotta and mozerella cheese mixture and bam!! it was awesome, thanks so much. I added some spices to my liking.....It was so good. Will make this again, I don't mind not having the meat in it at all.

Thank you this was an excellent base for a tasty meal.  As others rec'd I added a mix of veggies I had: Spinach, 2 bell peppers (yellow and red), 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, 1/2 med eggplant.  Changed rep: doubled the garlic, 1 cup of fresh basil, used olive oil, 1/2 cup of fresh parsley, and lastly 1 1/2 cups of parmesan cheese on top. I was concerned about the sodium so I only used 1 jar of pasta sauce and added 1 box (pt I think) of cherry tomatoes cut in half and 1 small 100 natural tomato sauce can (5 oz). I grilled all my veggies separate (left the bell a bit peppers churchy) and layered them.

You can't go wrong with this - it's noodles, cheese and a ton of veggies! I added zucchini, celery, mixed frozen spinach with the ricotta; and used mozzarella. I also used a homemade arrabbiata sauce (from this site) instead of plain marinara for a flavorful kick. A great staple recipe!

This lasagna was probably the best I've ever made. The recipe was simple and all but the top layer being really crunchy, this was a really good recipe.

This was very, very good.  I did make a few small changes.  I used mushrooms, green pepper, zucchini and frozen spinach (thawed and drained).  I also added a little Italian seasoning to the veggies while cooking.  The flavor was wonderful, the only thing I would do different next time is to chop the veggies into smaller pieces, especially the mushrooms.

I've made this twice now for different friends and everyone loves it. Next time, I'm making one just for me!!  It's a huge hit with carnivores and vegetarians. I followed the advice from other reviewers and added carrots, celery, onions, garlic, yellow & green zucchini and orange & green peppers to the sauce. That's an excellent way to sneak in more veggies. Now I use that as my go to recipe for sauces. Also, I used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded and added spinach to the ricotta. Delicious!!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.  YUMMY!!

Very good recipe!!! I also added some more veggies (spinach and zuchinni) and it was delicious. I also used baby portobello mushrooms because I love their thickness.

Delicious- made a few changes due to reading the reviews. I used shredded zucchini and carrots instead of the green pepper and used 3/4 lb. mushrooms. I ended up using half as many lasagna noodles as the recipe calls for. Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Used 1 and 1/2 jars of pasta sauce.

I made this as directed,  except that I added 10 oz. of chopped, formerly frozen, spinach to the ricotta cheese.  I was asked to make this for a vegetarian who came to a New Years party.  I made it the night before I baked it.   The vegetarian raved about it, as did several others, and she said it was just as good the  next day.  I tasted it and I think it would be better with Italian sausage and ground beef in it, but I'm not a vegetarian.  I'll use this recipe with meat in it for my family, though, because it was good.  I used Ragu for the pasta sauce.

This was delicious - used combinations of advice from previous ratings: replaced green peppers with shredded and roasted (12-ish minutes at 375) carrots, zucchini and yellow squash which I added to the tomato sauce.  Increased mozarella, a little too much; if did it again would leave as is and increase the parmesan.  Used tomato sauce recipe from this website "Tomato and Basil Pasta Sauce". Could have used a little more sauce than this recipe yielded. Used 14.5" x 9" pan.  Overall, this was a winner and a big hit!

We had friends over for Christmas Eve and my traditional meal is lasagna.  However, since one of our friends is a vegetarian, I made this recipe instead of my tried and true.  It was delicious !!  Definately will make again.  The only thing I added was some sliced zucchini.  
I didn't miss the meat at all.  I had never used jarred sauce in my lasagna before, but it was good.  I think simmering it with the veggies makes it pretty good.  
The only thing I think I will do different next time is not so much pasta.  My regular recipe calls for only 8oz.  This seemed to be alot of noodle.  Maybe I will use about 3/4 of box.  I might experiment with more/different veggies, too, just to try it out.
All in all, though, a really good recipe and one I am glad I tried !

Absolute Success! Having just recently adopted a vegetarian lifestyle I've been experimenting with recipes. I have enjoyed most of them but my meat loving boyfriend usually ends a meal by saying,"It's pretty good but it'd be better with (insert any type of meat here)". Also a pretty big eater, he would usually not have more than one serving of any of my vegetarian dishes. UNTIL TONIGHT! He wouldn't let me take his plate from the table because he planned on having another serving. I dont think he has figured out that there is no meat in this recipe and I'm debating whether or not I'll tell him.

We all really liked this.  Even my five-year old ate it, even though I added a couple cups of spinach we had on hand! It is very filling and easy to make. We will keep this recipe.

All 13 of us loved this.  I added one 10 oz. package of spinach to the cheese mixture, omitted the mushrooms, and added sliced carrot, sliced zucchini, and chopped broccoli to the sauce.  I never cook lasagna noodles ahead of time, either, and they always turn out just fine.  Excellent recipe.

I just made this for dinner 2 nights ago. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I added was some vegetarian "ground beef" so that it woud have the meat texture for my other guests.  It was fantastic! Everyone loved it and I will be making it again soon!  Thank you for this fantastic animal friendly recipe!

A tasty alternative to meat lasagna.  The men eating this felt that although this was very good, meat lasagna is much better.  One thing I changed was to use just 8 oz of lasagna noodles...the 16 oz box had 20 noodles which is just too many for a 9x13 pan.

OMG! this recipe was a hit in my household.  I subsited red and yellow pepper instead of the green peppers. I also added olives and spiced up with a few jalapenos.  just a few didnt want to spicy (have children).  however you could not tell the jalapenos were there.  My husband went back for 3rds and my picky eater first started off by saying that it smelled like onions in the house, but once eaten she was Sold!  Great Dish

This was very tasty! My family was pleased. I also added spinach and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

this lasagna was awesome. i used a lot of vegetables, way more than it called for. grated carrot in, put some chopped zucchini in, a package of frozen spinach ( half i put in the ricotta cheese mixture). i was so so so happy with this. also used no boil pasta. so it stayed in the oven for about 1 hour, 45 covered with foil, 15 uncovered. serious delicous.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS. I was a bit wary at first, since I have never made lasagna w/o meat--but I was gladly suprised by the wonderful result. The only changes I made were that I added chopped zuchinni's (1), used mozzeralla where it stated parmesan, and added some fresh mozzeralla slices to the very top. Cheesey, wholesome--I will be making this time and time again!

We have a winner!  I've been trying different lasagna recipes over the years to find a good one to use for every occassion, and have finally found it.  I used a chunky garden style sauce to add to the veggie mix and have gotten rave reviews every time I serve this.  Thank you!

Really, really good lasagna!  I used 1.5 jars of Newmans Sockarooni sauce, only 8 ounces of mushrooms and added brocolli to the veggies. will definitely make this one again!

I love this recipe!  It has become my stapel lasagna recipe for over 6 years now.  I will sometimes add browned meat/hamburger to give a meaty version but everything else stays the same.  Even though we are not mushroom eaters we still eat them in this!  You can also try using the food processor to blend up the vegetables for those picky kid eaters.  Makes it more of a thick hearty sauce vs chunky sauce.

This is great! It is now my favorite lasagna. I added the extra vegetable as suggested by other reviewers and it was perfect, didn't miss the meat at all. Instead of the jarred sauce I used 2 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes and seasoned it like my regular pasta sauce. Also, I never cook my noodles first and they always cook perfectly in the oven. Why dirty another pan if you don't need to. I did cover the lasagna with foil, baked 45 minutes, uncovered and baked 15 minutes more to brown up the cheese. Thanks for the wonderful dish, I plan to make it often!

Mmmm. This was the best I have ever made. Cut the calories with out losing the flavor. Sub. 1/2 egg beaters for eggs and used 1 eggplant thinly sliced in place of the noodles, thus cutting the calories to 313 per serving. Also add 10 ounces of thaw and squeezed dry spinach mixed into the ricotta. Next time I may try zucchini in place of noodles.

I have tried at least 3 or 4 lasagne recipes and this beats them all hands down. Easy and very delicious. Highly recommend. I didn't have ricotta, so I used cottage cheese instead. I think I actually liked it better that way.

This was the best lasagna I have ever made!  I followed the directions for the most part, simply adding extra veggies (shredded carrots, zucchini, onion, spinach, and red bell pepper). I also made sure to season the sauce and ricotta mixture. Instead of using only mozzarella, I used shredded Monterey Jack too.  I needed to make more of the ricotta mixture and only used ten pieces of lasagna.  My husband thought it was a 4, but for a lasagna...I have to give it a 5!

Made this tonight, and my family loved it!  Added a sliced zucchini and a handful of shredded carrots to the sauteed veggies because I had them on hand.  Also took a shortcut with no boil noodles.  Otherwise, followed to the letter, and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

Just made this last night, read many reviews and then made some changes. It was a hit, 6 people thought it was awesome. In the past, I've learned to pre-saute my veggies so I dont end up with watery runny lasagna.  a bit of prep time, but worth it!  to the sauce I added 4 minced, cooked garlic cloves, add'l herbs, 1 lb chopped sautéed mushrooms.  also, chopped and sautéed lg onion and lg green pepper and put that in sauce.  separately I sautéed a lg container of spinach and set it aside, and sauted a green and yellow zucchini, thinly sliced, and set aside. to the cheese mixture I added some fresh grated pecorino-romano cheese and mixed all.  the layering doesn't matter so much but I did sauce, noodles, cheese mix, vegetable layer, sauce, noodles, cheese, bit more sauce and the final topping of mozzarella.  350 oven covered for 30 min, then uncovered for 20-25. no runny veggie lasagna. thanks for the base recipe.

This recipe was very cheesy and unhealthy, but it's so delicious you won't care! I used broccoli instead of mushrooms just to have a heartier veggie in there. I'm pretty new to "real" cooking and this was my first lasagna. I couldn't believe how well it turned out and how delicious and flavorful it was!

I was surprised with how this lasagna turned out. I made this with my sister for the first time since we were having my father over for supper and he is mostly vegetarian, but will eat meat if we serve him some. We thought we would try something new with all veggies for him but wanted to be sure it turned out well. This recipe seemed perfect for the occasion and was perfect! I added some fresh baby spinach to my layer with the Ricotta cheese mix and served it with a fresh baguette I got at the grocery store and a fresh, light home made salad! Everyone loved it even the kids! It was surprisingly filling and tasty!

My husband and I have recently taken meat out of our diet (no chicken, beef, pork, lamb...all that stuff) and I've been looking for meals that will satisfy and fill him up as he is having the most difficulty enjoying this meat free experience.  I stumbled across this recipe and since lasagne is his favorite and the reviews were so great, I gave it a try.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  I may have just added a few more spices to the sauce, but it was an absolute hit!! Even my 2 1/2 year old loved it!  My husband has already requested that I make it again.  I must also mention that I thought the recipe was a little skimpy on the ricotta so I'll use a little more next time.  I also used Barilla's no bake lasagne noodles which makes life soooo much easier.  
Next time, I think I will add more vegetables (carrots, spinach, brocolli..)!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

This was a great recipe. I too made a few changes. My family does not care for mushrooms so instead I pureed 2 cans of kidney beans and fresh spinach together to use as the "meat". I also added more veggies and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I left out the Parmesan ......just seemed like overkill to me. Needless to say, not one of them realized there was no meat and they actually liked it better than my normal lasagna! Thanks again!

I've made a couple of different veggie lasagnas and after the last one, I decided not to do lasagna without meat again.  the vegetarian ones were never half as good as the meat ones.  When I came across this recipe I wanted to give it one more try, because of all the good reviews. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  Something about the combination of these particular ingredients....YUM.  The only thing I change was using half the mushrooms, fresh basil, and yellow instead of green pepper.

Great simple lasagna dish! The only changes we made were to use fresh basil and add it to the ricotta and used an heirlom tomatoe (had to get rid of it) on the top under the cheese. All in all, great dish!

I loved this basic lagagna recipe! I did make a couple of my own changes - I added some additional veggies (just carrots, celery, red pepper) and I reduced the cheese (cut mozzarella in half, used 10 oz of ricotta) and it turned out wonderful! My husband and I very much enjoy meat and we found that the heartiness of the veggies in here were enough for us.

Excellent lasagna.  I added a package of spinach and used a combination of ricotta and cottage cheese.  Only 2 cups of shredded cheese needed!  My guests loved the lasagna and kept asking for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly but I thought it had too much a strong bell pepper taste. I think it would have been better with other vegetables in it (perhaps some squash, zucchini, or carrots). I also thought it was too much sauce and not enough vegetables which would have given it some bulk. It wasn't bad but I was expecting it to be better.

Very good lasagna recipe, but it seemed like there should be more veggies in the veggie lasagna, so I included a small chopped zucchini, spinach, and half of a red pepper. Instead of ricotta cheese, I used the cheese I made following the Farmers Cheese recipe on this site.  The lasagna was very delicious and satisfying!

Good start - but it was a lot better once I lightened it up a little. I cut the lasagna noodles, mozzarella and eggs in half. Used egg whites instead of whole eggs. I'm not a mushroom fan, so I swapped them for 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash, cut into coins. Delicious!

Wonderful!  I did add zucchini, kale, broccoli and I forgot to use the egg.  I used reduced fat mozzarella.  I used Barilla oven ready lasagna noodles.  It was great!  I used Prego Garlic and Herb sauce.

Tried this recipe to the letter after a new years goal of releasing meats aside from fish but still wanting to add variety to the menu. It was delicious it was a full meal I only added a light spinach salad on the side. It was awesome made a great serving amount "leftovers for later" ingredients and instructions are accurate. Thank You will be adding those the favorites

I would give this recipe a 4 1/2. I had alot of vegetables in the frig that may have gone bad if I did not used them up. I used broccoli, red bell pepper, white onion, spinach and mushrooms. It was a great combo of favors(roasted the vegetable first). It was enjoyed with and french bread. Followed the instructions just changed some of the ingredents. Thank you for the recipe

Simple, fast, excellent. Only change was I made 4 layers to use more noodles. Every person who tried this said it was the best vegetarian lasagna they ever had. This is a BIG statement coming from vegetarians. You will love it!

This was fantastic!  My teenage son wants to eat vegetarian and it has been hard finding food that everyone in my family likes.  This is a great meal.  Everyone liked it and it was really easy to make too.

Very good recipe base - you can add the additional vegetables that you like. The only downsides I found were that the recipe called for too much pasta to be made, and I did have to drain off excess liquid at the end of baking in the oven.

This is an incredible veggie lasagna. I also added chopped zucchini, shredded carrot and chopped broccoli to the sauce mix and used chopped spinach in the cheese mixture.  You just don't miss the meat with this dish. We had it two nights in a row so it reheats in the microwave very well and then I also had for my lunch on day 3.  Delicious lasagne, I highly recommend this recipe for your Meatless Mondays.

This was great!  As a meat lover, I wasn't so sure about it, but was pleasantly surprised.  However next time I might try adding a half pound of ground turkey along with a few other alterations such as making my own sauce and no boil noodles.

This was a good tasting dish, but I think it needed more vegetables.  Next time I will probably add some zucchini, eggplant and/or spinach.

As other reviewers said,the sauce makes a huge difference in the results. I added the spinach into the ricotta as suggested also. Overall it turned out alright, but I just felt it was a bit bland. Added oregano and more garlic, and that helped. I think next time I may use a richer marinara sauce to see if that helps with the flavor. Good base recipe though.

I made this for my parents and siblings today. Everyone loved it. Like a lot of other reviewers, I added carrots and zucchini. I used very high quality tomato sauce and I used normal ricotta cheese instead of part-skim. Other than that, I didn't change the recipe one bit. 

Thanks to the contributor for this recipe. It turned out perfectly.

This was amazing! Although, it did not come out like the picture, it tasted really good. I put it in for 25 minutes rather than the 40 minutes. I would highly recommend this hearty dinner!

I loved this recipe. I only made minor changes. I added 3/4 of broccoli and squash. I also seasoned the ricotta cheese mixture with about 2 tbsp of basil and a little grated parmesan cheese. It was very filling and tasty!

Very yummy! I did make a number of changes. I used 1 cup of onions instead of 3/4, and used 1 cup of red peppers instead of 3/4 cup of green. I also added 1/2 cup of zucchini and 1/2 cup of yellow squash to the sauce. The sauce itself I made from an old recipe. Lastly,  I used olive oil and added fresh spinach to the layers.

This was very tasty, even using sauce-in-a-jar (though this wasn't the cheap stuff, it's still not homemade). However, I get the idea that this was either intended to be made in two batches or the person writing it out had thrown stuff together without measuring (which is fine) and then guessed how much they used after the fact. One pound of lasagna is a LOT of lasagna, as is 56 oz of pasta sauce. The ricotta mixture in this proportion is not nearly enough, and I'm not entirely sure if drugs were involved in the instruction to layer the bottom of the pan with an extra cup of tomato sauce that wasn't called for in the ingredients list. Whether or not the author intended it to mean you make the first layer out of the sauce you just made or not, that's what I'm going to do in future. The extra tomato sauce just was too much liquid. As it was, my poor Pyrex pan was overflowing, and I still had half the lasagna noodles, to boot. Not a great thing to have left over. 

BUT, with a few adjustments -- mainly in the amount of pasta, ignoring that instruction to add tomato sauce out of nowhere, and upping the amount of ricotta mixture -- this is absolutely a good dish. 

For what it's worth, I also added a medium-sized zucchini to the vegetables. Added some great texture! Definitely added to the dinner rotation.

There wasn't enough ricotta mix from this recipe. Also, I'm a novice lasagna builder so the directions left me quite lost and with too much of some stuff and not enough of other stuff.

Love this recipe!!!!  The only change I made was to omit the peppers (hate them) and add spinach to the ricotta mixture.  My hubby, a picky italian, asked me when I was making this again.    I am planning on making this with a nice tossed salad for my next dinner party.  Thanks!!!!

Very tasty. I did, however, make several modifications based upon what I had on hand. 1. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Not a big change, but still a change. 2. Added 1 package of frozen spinach. 3. Added shredded carrots and zuchinni. 4. Loaded up on garlic because I love it. Fantastic basic veggie lasgana recipe. Great for Fridays in Lent!

Absolutely delicious! Big hit! I made my own sauce...got the recipe from this site. Spaghetti Sauce II by Melinda Connery. I also added extra vegetables...shredded zucchini and shredded carrot. Then I added a package of frozen chopped spinach (thawed & drained, of course) to the ricotta mixture. It was awesome! I'm actually having it for lunch right now...Yum! Thanks for a great recipe for someone who had no idea how to make a good lasagna! :)

Delicious!!! I actually only used nine lasagna noodles.  I added one zuccini chopped and only a 1.5 jars of sauce which was more than enough.  I also only only added one cup of cheese on top.  Looking forward to making this again.  Will add even more veggies next time!

I made this last night, omg (!!!) so yummy!!!  Even my guy, who is a "meat and potatoes" type of guy, scarfed it down.  I definitely agree with some modifications that others suggested: I added broccoli, carrots and frozen spinach and then a turn of the balsamic vinegar in the sauce.  Oh, I also substituted half of the ricotta for cottage cheese to take the fat content down a bit.  Absolutely amazing!

One of the best vegetable lasagna's to make.  I used extra bell pepper and mushrooms. All the flavors together made for a great dish.  Served at my book club and it was a hit.  Enjoyed leftovers the following day.

This is excellent.  My family loved it.  I used sundried tomatoes 1/4 c, zuccini, red pepper, and onions.  Also I soaked the no boil noodles in warm water for 5 min.  You need less than an 8 oz box of noodles.  Thanks for a very very good recipe. I might use less mozarella on the top next time.

This recipe wow'd our meat-eating neighbors.  I followed the recipe as is, except I drained the water from the mushroom, pepper, onion mix before I layered the fixings. Thanks for the super saucy lovely lasagne!  Our neighbors had thirds!!

This is the only lasagna I ever make anymore, it just blows all of the others out of the water.  I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like the way this tastes; pair it with a good loaf of homemade bread and it just wows a crowd.  I don't change a thing about this recipe, it's the best.

Made this for my daughter's sweet 16 party (daughter #2 is a vegetarian), and at least three guests approached me separately to say they usually don't like vegetable lasagna but "could they have the recipe?". I took others suggestions and added zucchini, diced tomatoes with chilies and other veggies, as well as extra cheese. (When isn't extra cheese better?) Lots of flavor and held together very well when sliced.

I'm a beginner and found this very easy to make. I made the following changes:

I used two 24 ounce jars of pasta sauce which was still enough. I also reduced the mushrooms by around 4 ounces and used sliced carrots and a few slices of zucchini in its place. I also used fresh lasagna pasta sheets so I didn't boil or soak them.

Not only did the lasagna taste good, but it looks like it's very easy to play around with.

Really good lasagna. I served it at my daughter's birthday party and my family loved it too. I used no boil noodles and since I was chopping all the veggies anyway, I made my own sauce with a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, italian spices, a little sugar and salt and pepper and minced garlic and olive oil. I did add some left over jarred I had in the fridge during the layering because I didn't know if I was going to have enough sauce. It came out great.

Simple and tasty. I added a box of frozen spinach (thawed), and a can of diced tomatoes, but did not cook the spinach with the sauce. I also did not pre-cook the lasagna noodles and instead baked for 1 hour at 325. This always cooks the noodles, no problem, but make sure you have a very very juicy sauce (use the juice in the canned tomatoes). 

I used an Italian seasoning mix instead of basil, as well as dried onions and garlic to taste (I like their flavor).

Awesome recipe. I love Lasagna but my Wife is more or less a veterinarian. So I never get to make lasagna... Until I found this recipe, I made it this evening and it was great. I really enjoyed it and more importantly, my Wife loved it.

Great recipe!  I substituted shredded zucchini for bell pepper (personal preference) and added frozen spinach (drained) to the ricotta.  I also used no boil lasagna noodles (I run the noodles under hot water for a few seconds before I put them in the pan).  I bake covered tightly with foil for about 50 minutes at 350 and then take the foil off to brown the cheese for 5-10 minutes.  Make sure you either tent the foil or use a non stick foil or the cheese will stick to the foil and pull off the lasagna.

I made a few changes to the recipe and the results were labled "Outstanding" by my husband.  As other reviewers suggested, I added a box of thawed, drained frozen spinach to my ricotta mixture.  For veggies, I used zucchini, yellow squash (both of which I cut into matchsticks) and julienned carrots, all of which I sauteed with some Italian seasoning.  I used my homemade sauce and a mixture of asiago, romano, parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, as well as 12 no-boil noodles.   As others had mentioned the flavor improves the next day, I assembled and baked my lasagna the night before and reheated for dinner the next day.   Thank you so much for sharing your recipe - it definitely inspired me!

So good.  I made a few changes too - half the mushrooms - and used portobello.  Added zucchini.  Used a yellow pepper and half a red pepper.  I added the parmesan to the cheese mixture and used lowfat cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I used two things of nicer sauce and had too much sauce for my dish.  Next time, would use 1.5 or use 1 and some water (like another recipe I have).  I layered like I do another lasagna recipe: Spread 1 cup sauce on bottom. Layer with 3 no-boil lasagna noodles, 1.5 cups of sauce, half of ricotta mix, spinach  (boiled and squeezed of water).  Repeat layering (without spinach) ending with sauce.  Then, I baked covered for 50 minutes, then added about a cup of mozzarella (instead of two) and cooked without the cover for 10 minutes.  It turned out great!

I loved this recipe!  I've been looking for a good veggie lasagna for awhile and this one is great!  My changes: added some spinach to the ricotta, left out the green pepper and added shredded carrot and zucchini instead.  Also, I used low-fat mozzarella and it still tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Simple and delicious.  I used the lasagna noodles that don't have to be pre-boiled to shorten prep time.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  The lasagna was moist and perfect, all of my guests loved it.

I thought this lasagna was very good and so did my husband.  I was looking for a recipe with an assortment of veggies, and couldn't find one so I used this one and added more.  I reduced the amount of mushrooms, onion, and peppers and added zucchini, carrots, frozen chopped spinach (which I layered on  top of the sauce in the layering).  I also added oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  As a personal preference  I used about 10 whole wheat lasagna noodles and it resulted in a very  hearty delicious meal.

This was good-- I actually made it ahead of time & left it in the fridge for a couple days & then cooked it at 350 'til it was bubbling & it was perfect-- everybody's right, there's WaY too many noodles, you only need 1/2.

This is one of the best veggie lasagnas I have ever had.  I did make a couple
of changes- I doubled the amount of the ricotta mixture and added some
some zucchini.  It was a hit for our vegetarian Thanksgiving and now I am 
making it again for a group during the Christmas holidays!

This recipes was delicious. Just the right amount of vegetable were added. I did find that it did not take as long to bake though. Five to eight minutes less would be fine.

It needs way more sauce and veggies and cheese, very dry upon reheating. Also very little veggies. Not hearty.

A super great dish.  I did tweak the recipe a little, but this is by my own tastes.  I roasted my choice of veggies - zucchini, baby egg plant, yellow squash, green-red-and yellow bell peppers, onion,  minced garlic and shredded carrots. I also used fresh baby spinach, which I cooked down with a little freshly grated nutmeg.  I chose spinach lasagna noodles and my own sauce.  The results were great and because I made three small pans (meat-loaf type pans), I was able to freeze two and have for future meals. A close friend was recuperating and I took one pan to her....her only complaint....she wanted to know if she needed to get sick again to have another pan!
Can't thank you enough for sharing this super great recipe!

This was very good!  I was a little skeptical of the ratio of veggies/sauce to cheese mixture, but the end result was good.  I still think I'd like a little more of the cheese mixture next time, though.  The veggie/sauce amount I ended up liking except for the fact that it overflowed the dish a little.  Fortunately I could tell that was going to be a problem so I placed a cookie sheet on the rack below the lasagne to catch the drips.

This was pretty good, and I"ll make it again with a few changes. First I took other reviewers advice and added zucchini and squash. I think both was a little too much, just one or the other would be good. Also I would halve the mushrooms because my pasta sauce already had some veggies in them. Between the mushrooms, the zucchini and the squash there was a little too much water added to this recipe. That is certainly my mistake. I think I might sauté them for a bit longer next time, until the onions are nicely caramelized before adding them to the sauce. Overall it was a good recipe, and the issues I had were due to some changes I made not the original recipe.

Loved the recipe as is and my girls even loved the mushrooms which they normally would pick  out. The lasagna stayed together perfectly as well. Will become a mainstay for us.

I loved this! I followed several suggestions and added: zucchini, carrots, broccoli and spices. It turned out great! I was thinking that next time I will try using breaded eggplant instead of the noodles. I also make my own sauce. My family really liked it too!

Really good.  I did make some changes to make it lighter, as my mom's on weight watchers.  The recipe as published is 12 points for a 1/12 serving - my version was 8 points for 1/12 serving.  Keep in mind that this would vary based on vegetables and tomato sauce used - and if you only use half the noodles, the points already go down.   I left out the mushrooms and instead used 2 huge zucchinis and a whole bag of frozen chopped spinach.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and used fat-free ricotta and part-skim mozzarella.   I also used only 2 cups of mozzarella - used most of it for the cheese mixture and saved a little to sprinkle on top.  We didn't miss it.  I also used barilla whole grain lasagna - and as someone who hates whole wheat pasta, I didn't notice any difference.  I should have taken the advice of other reviewers, as I only used half the noodles and the dish was nearly overflowing due to all the vegetables, with plenty of the sauce-vegetable mixture left over.  And we (4 people) ate less than half the dish.  The vegetables make it really filling.  Definitely plan to make again!

Everyone loves this lasagna! I made some changes though. I used one whole red bell pepper chopped instead of green plus one zucchini chopped. Also use a sweet onion and 1.5 jars of arrabiata sauce from trader joes. I add a half a cup of sugar to the sauce when it's cooking. To make it low calorie I use egg whites, fat free ricotta, low fat mozzarella and only 6 lasagna noodles. Delicious but pretty healthy!

My husband and son love this lasagna more than any meat lasagna I have made. A lot easier on the stomach. A great meal to make ahead of time to freeze.

This lasagna is wonderful. I've made some modifications on the original recipe which includes using a small eggplant, small zucchini and small summer squash. Adds a lot of flavor!

We loved it. I used the Barilla oven ready pasta which was easy and tasted great. I added fresh spinach, used  Giada De Laurentis marinara with artichoke sauce. So good  on a rainy day. It passed the good enough for company test!

I am not a vegetarian, but made this (untried) for guests that are.  I added two extra layers on top of the vegetable sauce- steamed sliced carrots and chopped spinach.  The complexity of the flavors made this lasagna superior to the meat version that I normally make.  I doubt I'll ever make regular lasagna again. Everyone gave it rave reviews.

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller lasagna for one of 8 dinner guests who is vegetarian.  The meat eaters sampled it and loved it too.  As per other suggestions I added some carrots.  I didn't have pasta sauce on hand.  I substituted a can of chopped tomatoes, some tomato sauce and Italian seasoning.

Even better on DAY 2!! My kids and husband both enjoyed this recipe. My 7-year old daughter exclaimed, "It takes just like regular lasagne!" It is satisfying, but healthier than using all that fatty beef and sausage we usually use. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out fantastic!

This was excellent! Added grated carrot and zucchini and some broccoli like a reviewer suggested. Also lessened the amount of pasta sauce like another reviewer suggested. For a vegetarian dish this was delicious.

So delish. Added carrots, zucchini, and broccoli and less than 3/4 the tomato sauce suggested.  This recipe was so much better the next day after all the flavors had a chance to meld. I will make it a day early next time.

OUTSTANDING!  We absolutely loved this recipe! I had a lot of peppers so probably doubled the recommended amount using half red and half green bell; added a bag of fresh spinach to the veggies in the simmer pot; also found that 1 and a half jars of sauce were more than enough. I made this in a regular lasagna pan and it worked out perfectly. Also, recipe directions weren't clear on this, but be sure to top the lasagna with a last layer of noodles, tiny bit of sauce, and then the rest of the mozzarella. This will be my go-to recipe for lasagna from now on!

Delicious! I loved loved loved this. However, I must admit that I made modifications based on other reviews. I also was inspired by the World's Best Lasagna recipe to modify the proportions. I replaced the green pepper with zucchini, and added grated carrots. I sauteed fresh spinach, drained it well and added it to the ricotta mixture with parsley. I also used only 12 lasagna noodles total, and 1.5 cups of sauce for the each layer. I had sauce left over, but I'll use it for pasta sauce!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, as it turned out better than I expected! It was very cheesy, and the mushrooms added enough substance that I didn't miss the meat. I was a little worried about using pasta sauce, but I chose a nice one (portobello mushroom) and it was great! My husband didn't know it was meatless until I told him (after he ate it!)

I agree with others that it was way too many noodles, but I had enough of everything that I made an additional 8x8 pan of lasagna with the remaining ingredients and threw it in the freezer. Bonus!

Every summer we start to crave this.  Once the zucchini and peppers in the garden are ready, it's lasagna time!  We LOVE this recipe.  I add a generous helping of zucchini and sometimes yellow squash cut in thin circles, then quartered. I also add more mozzarella to the ricotta mix and while layering sprinkle more mozzarella after the parmesan.  I don't want a huge thick layer of cheese on top. Just a sprinkle. Make sure to pick a spaghetti sauce you like by itself- no Hunts stuff or that would ruin it.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  We served this to 150 at a 5th grade banquet and received wonderful comments.  The only switch we made was using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, we sauted the veggies in real butter and used garlic powder instead of cloves.

This was fantastic! I added a zucchini to it for extra veggies. Also made it in 2 small "loaf" size to freeze half. Only ended up using half the noodles and had a bit too much of the ricotta mix but the flavor of it all is wonderful.

This lasagna is awesome! I did make a few changes....I used a diced zucchini instead of bell peppers, used portabella mushrooms, added 2 cups of chopped spinach, used fresh basil and I only used 1 jar of tomato sauce as I don't like lots of sauce. I also messed up and put all 4 cups of cheese in with the ricotta and egg mixture...so then I had to add some extra on top...it would be better without the mistake but was still great. I didn't add any seasoning and it was very flavorful! My husband who is a big meat eater loved it!

This was the first time I have ever made a vegetable lasagna that wasn't made with a white sauce.  I really enjoyed this lasagna and I didn't miss the meat at all.  I did make some changes to the recipe to fit my taste: used no-boil lasagna (you can also use regular lasagna-there is no need to boil it as long as you layer ANY lasagna with generous amounts of sauce). I added shredded carrots and added thawed very well drained frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta (I always use whole milk ricotta-better texture and flavor) mixture as well as a little bit of nutmeg (trust me on the nutmeg).  I cut all the veggies fairly large because I wanted the veggies to still have a tiny bit of crunch as well as to be visible in the sauce.  I made my own tomato sauce as well, which probably ended up to yield more than 2 jars, but that's ok-I like extra sauce and it also helps to cook the un-boiled pasta.  This is a good recipe with the changes I made, I think that even without changing it to my liking, it would still be great.  Will make again

Absolutely terrific.  Only made a couple changes, mostly to the vegetables used.  1) I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  2)  I skipped the mushrooms, substituted red pepper instead of green, and added a package of thawed chopped spinach, 3/4 C of chopped zucchini, and a couple handfuls of chopped baby carrots.  3)  I was making this for later in the week so I only cooked it for half the time suggested, then popped it back in the oven for 25 minutes when we were ready to try it.

Very hearty and filling, and super easy. I know it would have been awesome as is, but as my boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms I substituted in chopped zucchini and fresh spinach for that bit. I used a little bit more bell pepper, onion, and garlic than called for to bulk it up. I omitted the dried basil in favor of using garlic & herb pasta sauce, and used reduced fat mozzarella. Very tasty! Everyone loved it.

This is the first time I've ever made veggie lasagne but it was delicious! I did substitute the veggie oil with olive oil and the regular noodles with whole grain noodles for a healthier version. My hubby is a meat eater and he loved it!

I am beginning to experiment with vegetarian recipes and thought this would be a good first vegetable lasagna recipe.  I found the cheese mixture too little by half.  In the end, the tomato sauce dominated the flavor.  The next time, I will use fresh soup greens (a quarter celery root, trimmed leak, a couple of carrots, and parsley) in lieu of the mushrooms and green bell pepper.  It is hearty, though.

This recipe was AMAZING.....My husband loved it also. He talked about it for 2 days. The only thing I did differently was that I purchased "no boil" noodles. The pasta sauce cooks the noodles while they are in the oven.

One of the best lasagna recipes I've tried. I'm not a big fan of meat, so this was right up my alley. I used zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, peppers and onions. It was fantastic!. I've also had it with just mushrooms and spinach and it was just as good. Any veggies will do.

I made this according to directions, but with the addition of spinach as other reviewers mentioned. My family liked that this veggie lasagna recipe didn't seem overly "vegetable-y", with chunky, layered veggies. Sauteing and incorporating the vegetables as part of the sauce made it great. I wasn't sure about the green peppers, but they make for a really rich flavor without adding chunkiness.

Added approx 3C misc vegetables (zucchini, carrots) in addition to mushrooms, pepper and onion.  Also added parsley to the ricotta.  Made in advance and cooked the next day, took a little longer to cook and was a little to soupy but once it was hot all the way through it was perfect!

This lasagna is awesome! I halved the recipe as I'm only cooking for one and wanted to save the leftovers. I used spinach with the ricotta mixture; For veggies I used squash, asparagus, onions, garlic and mushrooms. I only ended up using 1/2 the package of lasagna noodles and a jar of sauce from Trader Joe's. So delicious!

What a good recipe.  Lots of vegetable chopping but very worth it.  I'll be making this again for sure.  I tallied up the calories if you use low fat cream cheese and low fat ricotta and it's only about 425 calories a serving which I think is pretty good for lasagna!

A lighter and quicker  dish than the normal meat sauce lasagna I usually make.  I upped the veggies adding sliced zucchini and a thawed package of chopped spinach.  I mixed the grated parmesan into cheese mixture and the added a layer of the grated mozzarella.  I used homemade marinara I had in the frezzer.  Will make again this summer with even more veggies.

I had a veggie tray left over from my kidz b-day party and took advice from other reviewers to add them in.  I took about a cup each of broc., cauliflower, carrots, green pepper and crushed them in the food processor.  I also added the layer of (food processor) fresh spinach.  I only had canned mushrooms and figured they would get too messy, next time I will use fresh and grind those up too.  Everything really fooled the kids, except the shrooms!  I received a lot of "Yums!"

This was decent but not great. I added a lot of zucchini and broccoli. Without those additions this would have been very bland. I felt like the ricotta mixture (which is what really makes Lasagna!) was missing something and didn't add much to the lasagna- and that's a shocking thing to hear coming from a WI girl like me. Overall this was good, but if I make it again I will try some additional tweaks.

I added zucchini to make it little heartier, and I replaced the green bell peppers with red as I prefer the taste.  The ratios worked really well.  I liked that it was nice and cheesy and not too runny.

I loved this!  It was easy to assemble and tasted great.  My husband (meat-eater) was a little skeptical, but it was hearty enough to satiate his appetite.  I added a packaged of thawed, spinach and a tomato to the sauce.  Next time I will experiment with different seasonings and extra veggies.

WOW!!!  This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  Even my daughter, who's a very picky eater, loved this!  Only change I made was I added more vegetables to this dish.  I added shredded carrots, chopped zucchini, broccoli, and added chopped spinach to the ricotta cheese mixture.  Thanks for sharing.....this veggie lasagna is definitely a keeper!!!!!

Very good recipe! I've made it several times now, both as written (so good!) and lower fat by cutting the mozzarella in 1/2 and using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, I also added tons of extra veggies to the sauce -- it was very good! This is my go-to veggie lasagne recipe from now on, thanks.

LOVED IT!!!!  I did use the spinach in the ricotta mixture like other viewers suggested.  Another thing that I did was to season my veggies with a little salt and pepper, otherwise I think the recipe would have been a little bland.  Thank you Sue.

This was pretty good, not the best I ever had, but my guests seemed to enjoy it, I made a huge pan and it got almost finished. I used ready bake noodles,left out the pepper,added fresh spinach to the ricotta and added broccoli and zucchini to the sauce. I did feel that there was a bit too much cheese on top.

This got rave reviews from my family.  I personally like it much better than lasagna with meat, and it's healthier, too.  I did make a few changes: I reduced the lasagna noodles by about half (3 layers of 3 noodles each), changed the layering a bit, reduced the mushrooms by half, and added some spinach and broccoli.  Be aware that it's a tight squeeze to get everything into a 9x13 pan.

This was fun to make and absolutely delicious!  Like some other reviewers, I added zucchini instead of broccoli, reduced the mushrooms (8 oz pack), and used olive oil instead of veg. oil. I also added fresh,chopped Swiss chard to the saute mixture (same texture as spinach).  I used non-fat or low-fat cheeses--only used ricotta and mozzerella--no parm. I also threw in sundried tomatoes in the first/bottom layer; these added great texture and flavor!  Only thing I'd do differently next time is reduce the garlic a little.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I will definitely make this one again!!

So so good. I didn't use mushrooms because we don't like them. Instead I used zucchini along with with extra peppers and onions. I also used the oven ready lasanga noodles because I wanted to make it easier on myself. Then I  baked  it according to the directions on the box of noodles. It was excellent. Absolutely a keeper

We really liked this!  I did sub the green pepper for sauteed zucchini due to a an over abundance of it and it's what I had on hand.  We will be asking this again soon, a great change from the usual meat lasagna.

This is a perfect recipe for a basic vegetable lasagna.  I didn't buy enough mozzarella, and it was okay with just the two cups.  Next time I will add zucchini and eggplant.

My husband and I were having friends over that are vegetarian. After searching through tons of recipes and reading almost all of the reviews for this one we opted to try this lasagna. It turned out great!! Here are the small tweaks we made... we used fresh noodles from Whole Foods, 'Amys' Organic Pasta Sauce, did fewer mushrroms but added zucchini and shredded carrots and did add the spinich as recommended to the cheese. My husband is not a huge vegie eater but said he would have this again!! But he wouldn't mind if I added a bit of sausage as well. :)

This was great my husband said mine blew his away. I also changed a few things from reading others. Added the fresh spinach to the ricotta & sauce yum, and I did put some saug. in the sauce along w/ red pepper & carrots. Basically tweeked it to my family liking.  Actually can't wait to make Lasagna again.  Wow who said that?

Very good veggie lasagna!  In addition to mushrooms I added sauted squash to the sauce.  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 pan.  Ended up doing three layers of noodle because I had so many even with halving it.

I added carrots, spinach to the ricotta, sliced zuccini and parmesean cheese like others suggested and it came out great. I used more sauce too. We have to hide veggies in food for my toddler and he loved this recipe. My hubby liked this too. This one is now in rotation.

This is a great no-meat lasagna! Of course, I had to tweak it for my families taste. I substituted chopped fresh string beans for the green bell pepper, added ch. zucinni, shredded carrots, can of sliced black olives, red pepper flakes and crumbled feta cheese. I used 2 jars of Classico Mushroom & Olive sauce. Everyone really liked it.

This lasagne is superb. I especially like the fact that it uses tomato sauce instead of white sauce. Must like mushrooms to enjoy this recipe. I used precooked lasagne noodles and it came out great.

Delish! I mixed quantities about a bit (basically threw everything in!) and it was still yum-tastic. Also, instead of green pepper I put in aubergine and carrots to make it a bit more substantial. Will definately be making again...

Absolutely fabulous! I used portobello mushrooms for a chunkier sauce, and whole wheat lasagna noodles. There wasn't enough tomato sauce in the original recipe than I had liked, so I added a bit more and it tasted great! This is something that I will definitely make again. Thanks!

This was pretty good except I think duet to all the sauce, it didn't come out too firm. However, after a night in the fridge and a microwave at work, it's better. The taste was overall very good! I added zuchinni and broccoli to the mix (cut down on the mushrooms, pepper and onions). I also forgot the parm. cheese in teh middle so i sprinkled it on the top. All in all 4 stars, and only because it was a little soupy. I'd suggest a little less sauce.

Abs. delicious. I'm not usually a fan of vegetarian food, but invited a vegetarian over for dinner so had to make do. ALL of my friends loved it-- cleaned their plates. And people even asked me for the recipe-- a first! Thanks so much for a delicious meal.

Excellent recipe!!! I added shredded carrots to the veggies and used no-bake noodles. I also recommend using Classico hearty vegetable sauce. It added even more veggies! Very yummy and easy too!

This recipe is wonderful. The flavor is absolutely sensational. The main change I made was to cut the recipe in half and prepare it in a 9 x 13 dish. It's sensational. I like to follow the recipe, then add whatever veggies I happen to have on hand: frozen spinach, fresh tomato, broccoli, whatever. I also add a litte parsley to the cheese mixture for an added burst of color and flavor. Too good! Thanks for sharing!

I was really hoping this would be better. It wasn't terrible, but we didn't really like it either. Strange and bland taste. I subbed zucchini for the mushrooms and omitted the Parmesan, but still... My husband says lasagna should have meat in it, anyway, so I think I'll keep looking for another lasagna recipe. Thanks anyway.

Absolutely awesome!! I made it a little more vegetable-y...adding mushrooms, spinach, zucchini, and yellow squash. Used one jar garden vegetable pasta sauce, one jar garlic cheese pasta sauce. Turned out perfect! This was my first time making lasagna--was hesitant to make because it's just me here...I ended up sharing with family and friend who LOVED it...eventhough it didn't have meat. Oh--used only one cup mozzarella cheese, one cup marble jack. YUMMM!!

this was an easy recipe, it was worth chopping up all of the ingredients, plus like others suggested i added carrots, brocolli, zuchinni, fresh spinach, and red and green bell peppers. it was very pleasing to the eye and mouth just add more cheese and sauce accordingly.

everything was great, except adding green pepper to it, which made the lasagna too crunchy. I tried it the second time with sauted zucchini and it was much smoother

Great recipe with tons of flavor.  I also added spiraled zucchini noodles, diced green/red/yellow peppers, ginger spice blend paste and sautéed kale.  My family loved it and the spectrum of colors was also appealing.  This is one of my go-to favorites!!!

One thing that appealed to me about this recipe was how many adaptations of it there were in the reviews. I used mushrooms, eggplant, onion and green pepper, and Barilla marinara sauce. My husband loved it, as did I. I used two bottles of sauce, as the recipe suggests and did not find it to be excessive.

Delicious!  I only tweaked it a bit.  As I don’t care for cooked green peppers, I omitted them.  I also added fresh spinach on top of the cheese layers.  I also grate fresh Parmesan for added flavor.  Buy the Parmesan by the brick.  You’ll never go back to the pregrated stuff on the shelf.

I served this as the main entree to my family for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was a HUGE hit! We have vegetarians and carnivores, and everyone loved it. 

As suggested by other reviewers, I added 1 16 oz bag of thawed and drained frozen spinach, and a hodge podge of other veggies (2 medium carrots chopped, broccoli tops chopped, 
1 red bell pepper chopped, 8 oz of mushrooms chopped, 2 zucchini chopped). 

I omitted the egg to the cheese mixture, and it was fine. I added 30 oz of pasta sauce, which seemed to be just right (not dry but not soupy at all). I was flummoxed as to why I have lots of cooked but unused lasagna noodles remaining unused, as I generously used noodles to fill a 9X13 pan.  All in all, this was a home run and one that will be seen in the post season many times! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Sue!

The recipe calls for 2(26 oz) of sauce.  The direction only calls for 2 cups,; which includes the vegetables.  It does not have much taste.

Proportions are pretty off. One jar of tomato sauce was enough. As for the lasagna pasta, I ended up only using 12 sheets rather than the whole box. 
The vegetables lack flavor. Needs salt and other seasoning like garlic salt, onion powder, etc. 

Also, in my opinion the recipe needed more ricotta cheese filling. I like cheesy things lol

If I make a meatless lasagna again I will layer sauteed mushrooms with cheese instead of incorporating them into the sauce and I will just mix a large tub of ricotta with seasoned parmesan cheese, instead of mixing it in with the mozzarella. I was really excited to try this but I was highly disappointed.

I served this to a room of meat-eaters and everyone loved it! I added shredded carrots, yellow squash and zucchini.Make sure to absorb the moisture from the extra vegetables so the lasagne doesn't end up soupy. I also reduced the sauce a little more. Perfect for a main dish!

I've never made a lasagna before but thought I would give this a try! My husband and I loved it! I used Bertoli organic jar sauces, for the veggies I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, zucchini , onions and added some spinach also. I did mix ricotta with moz. And a bag of mexican blend since I didn't buy enough mozzarella when I shopped for ingredients, turned out great! I also used oven ready lasagna noodles to save time! Excellent! Definitely a repeat recipe and really not a lot of prep except for chopping veggies.

If you don't have everything cut up it takes a little longer than expected. Hard to keep the dish layered when scooping out servings.

I loved this recipe! I used what I had on hand: squash, spinach, yellow onions, mushrooms, and shredded carrots. I forgot to add the yellow corn??. Outstanding dish, thanks Sue!

This was delicious! Next time I will cook half the box of lasagna noodles though since even with layering them in the dish I had at least half left over. I added broccoli as some others said they did in reviews and used Newmans Roasted Garlic and Peppers sauce. Definitely will make again!

I've made this recipe twice with some modifications.  I made an alfredo sauce and combined that with a marinara sauce to make a creamy tomato sauce.  I also used dried porcini mushrooms, along with some fresh baby portobello mushrooms.  I also added fresh basil, since I grow my own herbs and I almost always find fresh herbs to be superior to dried herbs.  This is a very versatile and delicious recipe.

This has been on my monthly recipe rotation for at least three years now. It's one of those recipes that I know will always impress guests and will always send my family back for third or fourth servings. You'll never miss the meat in lasagna with this recipe. Thank you for such a great recipe!

Made this for the first time last night and the whole family absolutely loved it! Took out the eggs, added a little extra mozza on top. Added roasted tomatoes to the first layer on top of the ricotta mix, added spinach and 3/4 the mushrooms, but added extra onion (1 whole white onion) and garlic (5 cloves), used 3 sweet peppers (red & yellow) in place of a bell pepper and also added spinach. Came out tasting amazing! Didn't LOOK amazing, but it tasted restaurant quality to us!

Good veggie lasagna...make sure you add Double the garlic AT LEAST than what is called for. Also, a teaspoon of salt to the sauce and fresh herbs really make the difference. Otherwise very good...

The words "vegetable lasagna" have also struck fear in my stomach, but this, this is amazing. I am no chef so it's not often I fix this, but we love it, and leftovers don't always make it to the next day. I halve the recipe since there are only two of us, and have experimented with different types of noodles, and have messed up the ingredients a couple of times...it is always delicious and not an ounce goes uneaten.

This turned out well, but a little watery. I added spinach & broccoli as well as more mushrooms. The flavor was great & the guest asked for left overs to take home. Can't get better than that, huh?

This is a solid veggie lasagna recipe and will be my go to base recipe from now on. I only made slight variations - 3 extra cloves of garlic and I added finely shredded carrots and zucchini to the ricotta/egg mixture and half a cup of red wine to the sauce. Large volume of mushrooms could be cut down if in need, but mushrooms really serve to give the dish a satisfying mouth-feel texture and helps to create volume where there is no meat. I used both shredded mozzarella and sliced. Next time I will add a jar of kalamata olives and keep experimenting with the dish - it's a great base recipe and will lend itself well to individual taste and experimentation.

It's OK - nothing amazing. It just tastes like any lasagna. I don't think I'd do it again because it's a lot of work for a not stunning result. Mine came out a little sweet, too. I'm guessing it may have been the sauce I used. Would have been improved maybe with a little red wine to cut the sweetness.

Great recipe, would highly recommend it.  I would also (like other commentors) add more vegetables next time like shredded carrots and zucchini and broccoli.  The tip to add a package of frozen - thawed and drained - spinach was great.

Amazingly good! I, like other reviewers, added other vegetables to the mix. I used zucchini, carrots, green peppers, mushrooms, onions and garlic and let simmer for about a half hour. I would highly recommend and it was super easy!!

This is my favorite lasagna recipe. I always use spread cream cheese on the noodles instead of mixing the ricotta and eggs; just let the cream cheese sit out till it's room temp before you spread it. The result is fantastic.

Ok, not like this recipe needs any more reviews, lol, but I figure i'll throw in mine anyways.  This recipe is FABULOUS!  Amazing!  Can't say enough good about it.  I used two different types of prego that I had in the pantry, one was a 6 cheese and the other italian sausage.  Both spaghetti sauces, which I was afraid would lend it too much of a "spaghetti" taste vs a lasagna taste, but NOPE, it was amazing.  I added thin sliced zucchini because of my garden abundance and that was a great touch.  Overall awesome recipe, we had dinner guests and they just wouldn't stop commenting about how awesome it was.  Thanks for the recipe, i'll definitely be making it again, probably sooner rather than later since i've still got most of the ingredients!

Love this recipe! This was the first time I made lasagna and decided to use the oven-ready lasagna noodles to cut down on prep time (make sure you bake it covered with aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes, then remove, top with cheese and bake for the last 10 minutes). Like most of the other reviewers, I subbed the mushrooms for squash. I also added a few extra flavors - oregano, red pepper flakes, a touch of white wine and onion powder. The consistency and taste was perfection - and neither of us missed the meat at all. This makes for awesome leftovers, too!

I just made this recipe and it is delicious! I was looking for a good veggie lasagna that didn't contain zucchini or squash since my family dislikes it. I made some slight variations on this recipe though, I added carrots to the sauce and when layering added a layer of fresh spinach. I agree it needed more spices and salt.. so next time going to add more italian spice blend and salt and maybe some extra garlic I love garlic. But definitely a good recipe to start with.

I use this recipe to trick my husband into eating vegetables. I loved it! It was perfect without adding or taking anything away. I did have to add some ground turkey for the hubbie. He loves his meat. I wouldn't have added it but I was a little worried he wouldn't even try it. Thank you for this recipe!

My husband and I are both vegetarians from childhood.  He liked this recipe but I don't think I've found my go-to recipe. I felt it was a little bland, not enough cheese mixture or flavor in general.  I used about half the recommended noodles and with that, it fit just fine.  Looked beautiful but was soupy when cut.  My biggest complaint about most vegetarian recipes is that they are bland, use weird ingredients or are complicated.  My non-veggie friends would not like or use this recipe.  Overall this wasn't bad but I'm still searching for my crowd-pleaser lasagna.

I made an off-shoot this recipe for a large gathering of people (doubled the recipe) and it was a very big hit - with people I didn't even know coming up to me to say how much they enjoyed it.  This recipe can be modified based on personal preference for different veggies.  I am not a fan of green bell peppers so I ommitted them and used a combination of mushrooms, broccoli,carrots,spinach and garlic for the filling.  I also made home-made marinara sauce which I think makes a big difference as well.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!  I used half the amount of mushrooms & added shaved carrots & celery.  Next time I will add spinach and zucchini in the summer. So good & easy to make....just a little extra time for prep.

Delicious. Added 2 carrots (peeled), spinach, 2 celery, 1 14oz. jar marinated artichoke hearts.  I used half the mushrooms, half package no-boil lasagna noodles, sprinkled Trader Joe's 21 season salute on top.

My niece asked me to make a vegetarian meal while she was visiting, and I tried this.  It was so good!  The non-vegetarians in my family didn't even miss the meat.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't use all of the lasagna noodles, though.  I probably could have gotten by with about half the box.  I would definitely make again.

This was great! I cut the recipe in half and used a tofu alternative to replace the ricotta and vegan parmesan due to my non dairy diet. I added carrots, zucchini, and red onion to the veggies and just used a store bought tomato sauce. Served with a salad and garlic bread. This was the first lasagna I've made and we loved it! Will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

This is delicious!  I have a very good friend who is a vegetarian.  I am not, my family is not, and neither is her husband.  Usually when she eats at someone's house she's left having to eat whatever side doesn't contain meat, but I love her too much for that.  I am always on the lookout for good meatless entrees and this is one of my new favorites.  Thanks!

Love this recipe. 
I had to make some changes, thanks to a very picky little eater in my home, so the only vegetables we put in were carrots, onions, mushrooms, and spinach. 
I also used an Italian mix of cheese instead of Mozzarella. 
First time he ate all his veggies without me begging him.

This was an absolutely wonderful recipe.  It came out well my first time.  I took some advice from others and added carrots and spinach since I already had them in the fridge.  I did not use any mushrooms.  I also used Prego Tomato Basil & Garlic Italian Sauce.  It was so wonderful!  My fiance' was pleasantly surprised!

Holy cow! I don't even like lasagna, but this is AMAZING! Even my young girls inhaled this and they won't eat vegetables (or anything I cook for that matter). This is perfect as is, but I'm going to try adding zucchini or eggplant next time.

Great basic recipe. I added zucchini, sliced sweet peppers (red, yellow, orange), and grape tomatoes to the sauce. I also used fresh basil instead of ground both in the sauce and on top of the first ricotta layer.

For some reason I just didn't think this recipe was all that great. Too much ricotta I think. I think it would have been better with cottage cheese. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and it was so-so.

Excellent-I subbed 'portions' of other veggies I had on hand to use up my leftovers, etc.  Also subbed some pesto for the basil.  It was very moist, and full of flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe, and helpful for me when cooking for my pescectarian boyfriend.  The only thing I would make sure to do is to cook it a bit longer than the 40 minutes as I love a crispy edge on my lasagna.  Overall, a great dish that my other half also seemed to enjoy!

Call me Garfield, because I loved this Lasagna! I only used half of the mushrooms and added spinach and zucchini. It reheats very well so you can eat lasagna whenever you want to. Also, do not be concerned if not all of the lasagna noodles are used.

Excellent! I forgot to add the basil, so I sprinkled some on top before adding the remaining mozzarella. I also made my own lasagna noodles - I didn't boil them prior to assembling; it was delicious. So much easier to make your own noodles!! Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this! Even our friend, a big, meat-loving man, said it was great! My husband was also hesitant about the no-meat thing and he loved it. I added a zucchini and some spinach and used fewer mushrooms because my kids don't love mushrooms. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This was amazing I did add slivered zucchini, chopped red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, and fresh basil. My family loved it and I purred some for my 8 month old and he loved it too. I am feeding 5 adults and it filled all of us up and we had some left over. Great dish.

Yum yum yum.  This recipe is officially fool-proof. First time making lasagna, I accidentally bought monterrey jack cheese, and it was STILL delicious. Threw in all kinds of veggies, used about half box of noodles, as most people did. Mmm mmm good.

I made this for a friend that requested veggie lasagna and she really liked it.  It was very easy to put together.  After reading some of the reviews, I made a few changes.  I used oven ready lasagna noodles, only 8 oz. of mushrooms, added one small chopped zucchini to the sauteed vegetables, and added a box of spinach to the ricotta mixture.  Sounds like big changes, but not really.  Good easy recipe!

I really liked this recipe! I also added different veggies. I added canned Italian Green Beans and cut the amount of mushrooms in half. I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles and a LOT more garlic. It made WAY too much for the recommended size pan but I froze a smaller one for later.

OMG! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was gone in 20 minutes! Soooo good! My only changes were that I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, used half the noodles and substituted 2 cups of mozzarella cheese with Italian Shredded cheese. Even my brother who is so picky - loved it! As my family ate it, they were asking when I was making it again. haha

This was my first time cooking lasagna and I was very impressed! I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and added spinach and 1 zucchini.  Also, I only used half the package of lasagna noodles and that was more than enough!

Yum! I looked at some of the suggestions and didn't really follow any of them. I like noodles, so I didn't think one package was too much. Although next time I think I will add more veggies...it's great the recipe is so versatile; you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand!

I made a healthier version that was a big success!  I used whole wheat noodles instead of regular, added 3/4 cups of chopped zucchini to the rest of the veggies, used only 1.5 cups of mozzarella in the cheese mixture and left out the parmesan all together.  Then I baked the lasagna in a 9x9 baking pan (had to trim the noodles) instead, so that 1 cup of mozzarella was enough to cover the top.  More nutrients, less saturated fat, but just as delicious!

So good!  My husband and all of our friends love this recipe and it is so easy.  I used two zuchinni's, 10 oz mushrooms and an onion.  I also used no boil noodles to cut down on time.  So easy and definitely a keeper for us.  I plan on making a large batch and will freeze family sized portions to pop in the oven.

I added roasted peppers, fresh spinach, shredded zucchini, fresh grated romano cheese, and emitted the mushrooms.   Absolutely delicious. Will use many, many times!

I thought this recipe was easy and fantastic. I did change a couple things though. Instead of peppers I used spinach and I used an alfredo sauce instead of tomato. I would definitely make this again.

This was truly hearty.  It was so filling that we had trouble finishing the whole pan before it went bad.  Very tasty, though.

SO DELICIOUS! I did, however take out the green peppers (not a fan) and add grated carrot, zucchini, italian stewed tomatoes and spinach! The more veggies the better! also simmered the  out of all the veggies and sauce. I had tons of sauce left over that was really great on pasta. Score! This was seriously gone in a couple of days.

Perfection.  I melted a few slices of provolone on the top layer for some extra tastiness.  I also made a separate dish for my husband with sweet Italian sausage.  We loved this so much, perfectly tasty!!!!

This was delicious! I added broccoli, zucchini, and red peppers. I also used a tomato alfredo sauce. My husband and 10 month old loved it and I will definitely be making it again.. maybe with less cheese next time, it was a little too cheesy.

Wow! This is fantastic! My family and I were anticipating an epic failure b/c it was a vegetarian lasagna after all, but we were all pleasantly surprised! I will definitely be making this again!   I gave it a 4, b/c the amount of cheese was waayyyy too much.

Like so many of the other reviewers, I chopped up and added more vegetables.  My family loved it so much they didn't even realize there wasn't any meat!  Excellent summer alternative!

I'd actually never made lasagna before, but I needed a meatless recipe to make for my family.  I left out the mushrooms because my sister isn't a fan, and I used 'oven-ready' noodles, minced garlic from a jar, and since I didn't realize I was out of dried Basil - I threw in a couple of blobs of Basil Pesto Sauce we happened to have in the fridge instead.  I also added a small handful of fresh spinach on top of each Ricotta layer.  I wasn't really sure how it would taste, seeing as it seemed I'd just basically made a "bell pepper" lasagna, but we all thought it was really great!

We found this recipe to just be average.  It seemed to be missing something. It was better the next day, but I'd like it to taste that good on the first day and get even better. I made the lasagna with no boil noodles - it may be why we didn't think it was so great.  I especially noticed on the next day that it was very, very dry. I will try again with regular noodles.

First time I ever made lasagna and it was AMAZING. I skipped the Parmesan and basil to save some money (used basil tomato sauce instead) and it still tasted awesome. Thanks!

This was SO good!  I followed the recipe almost to the letter (except I used red pepper instead of green and I forgot to add the basil - oops) and it came out perfectly.  I used  a Tomato and Garlic flavored pasta sauce.  All my guests enjoyed it and asked for seconds.  Thanks for this recipe!

OMG!! This was indeed the best lasagna I have ever made and eaten. I used zuccini and whole wheat noodles. It went on our camping trip and was spectacular the day after and even delicious cold for the ride home. My sweet vegetarian grand daughter kept asking for more so I was a winner with this one. Thanks everybody for the high raves, they are true!!

This was good.  I did add zucchini /summer squash to it and used 8oz no-bake noodles.  Baked it fully and then reheated it a day or two later for our company.  Next time I'll partially bake (20 min) it so it's fresher for reheating.  :)  Thanks again!

Traditional lasagna is one of my favorites, so I was hesitant to try out this recipe, but was serving dinner with few vegetarian guests. It was a hit! The meat is hardly missed.

This could be my favorite lasagna recipe, even better than a meat lasagna. I layered chopped baby spinach, the cheese, and my assorted veggies very thinly mixed with marinara, and then a marinara layer. The sauteed veggie mixture: broccoli, carrots, onion, 2 cloves garlic, 2 small zucchini, 1/2 green pepper. No mushrooms in this one, but soooo good.

Great recipe!  I added some low-fat cottage cheese and chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture.  I also added some zucchini slices to each layer.  Turned out beautifully:)

This was so good, and so simple! I love a recipe with fresh ingredients. Simmering the onions, pepper and mushrooms, I felt like a professional chef. My husband, who considers no meal complete without meat and who hates veggies, ate this for dinner.

Update: I reviewed this recipe I-dont-know-how-many months ago, and Im still making it! I add thawed frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta mixture; adding even more nutrition to this already veggie-packed dish. I also use no-boil lasagna noodles; cuts down on cooking time even further!

After reading many of the suggestions, I added more veggies to the recipe (carrots, yellow squash, zucchinis, and red, yellow, and orange bell peppers. I also added spinach to the cheese. It came out VERY tasty and my picky 2 year-old didn't even turn up his nose at it, which made it a SUCCESS! It tastes even better the 2nd day.

An exceptionaly rich and flavorful vegetable lasagna-bound to excite vegetarians' tastebuds and leave the meat-lover asking for seconds. The resulting dish is well worth the prep time.

One of the best lasagne I have ever had.
Came out really well with a delightful flavour added at the end with a little chilly flakes and oreganum.
Yumm..would like to try it again, may be without the egg this time.
Thanks a ton for the wonderful recipe.

My husband was not excited initially when I mentioned vegetable lasagna for dinner... I went for it and he loved it! I would suggest using fresh homemade noodles, like the ones found in Whole Foods refrigerated pasta section, as it really made a difference.

Made this last night and we thought it was great.  Of course like everyone else, I deviated a little.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I made the first vegi layer spinach and sliced squash.  Then the second vegi layer was green and red peppers, onions, and mushrooms (less than recommended).  Also on top of each vegi layer I put tomato sauce, basil, and then sprinkled on the mozzarella.  It turned out to be great.

My hubby & I both gave this 4.5 stars. It was a hit w/ our guests too! However, we tend to be on the lactose-intolerant side & I may try this w/tofu instead of ricotta. Also, I like my Italian food a bit spicy, so I think I will use red pepper flakes next time. Overall, came out very well-tasting & well-presenting, & it was easy to make.

This was a very good and basic recipe that you can tweak to your liking. In addition to the peppers and onions, I used portobello mushrooms and spinach. I also added some extra garlic, and used an italian spice mix. 

Next time I'll probably use more sauce, just for personal taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely fantastic.  I am on weight watchers, so I swamped out a few things.  I used wheat lasagna noodles, fat free cheeses and cooking spray, no oil.  This tasted delicious!!

This is wonderful.  You get your lasanga fix w/o the heavy feeling afterwards.  I used portabella mushrooms for a more meaty taste.  My entire family loved it.  I also added some sliced frozen zuke from last year's garden.  I made it nice and juicy.

I wish I had used only about 10 noodles, but it was still good-- just a little thick. I substituted cut carrots and broccoli for the mushrooms.  It's a keeper!

This recipe was just "ok".  I was a little disappointed as all other 5 star recipes on this recipe I've tried have been fabulous.  The texture of the lasagna was good and I did enjoy using the fresh Trader Joe's no-cook pasta.  It made it quick and easy to assemble!  I'll use them again.  However, even with good quality Trader Joe's pasta sauce and adding a layer of fresh spinach and some squash,  the flavor was just so-so.  I served it to a group and no one commended it, although they did compliment *all* the other foods!  My family of five rated it 2,3,3,3,4.  I think I'll try another one next time.  Thanks anyway.

There was no way possible I could have made this recipe and fit it all in one pan! I had to use two small casserole dishes.  I added some parmasan cheese to the top before baking. If I make this again, I'll add chopped zucchini and sour cream. I'd also like to try a version of it using spinach.  After being in the refrigerator for a day, the flavors meshed and this tasted much better.  Fresh out of the oven, I didn't think it had enough flavor.

I have probably made this a dozen times and it always turns out.  You can substitute pretty much any vegetable.  I have used things like carrots, spinach, zucchini, any color of pepper, and different mushroom varieties.

This is a great general guide for veggie lasagna.  I agree with previous reviewers that it's better to make your own sauce.  I just add crushed tomatoes with basil and a few spices.  I use uncooked whole wheat lasagna and add some extra sauce so that it doesn't turn out too dry.  Pretty much any combination of veggies works.

This is the best lasagna I have ever made. Even my meat and potatoes roommate loved it. Although I did tweak it a little, I used two different types of mushrooms, fire roasted red peppers, and added spinach and zucchini. I also used no need to boil lasagna, and used about half the cheese. This is so easy to make it's hard to mess up. Perfect for leftover vegetables

This recipe is excellent!  I did find though that the top browned more than I liked so would probably bake it covered for part of the cooking time next time I make this.  To take away from the browned appearance (which could be the oven I used) - I used some sliced mozarella on top and let that melt for a few minutes in the oven before serving.  Also looking through past reviews helped me to tweak the recipe slightly.  I used half the mushrooms, but did add a package of frozen spinach (thawed of course), about 4-5 oz. shredded carrots, and one small zuchini sliced thin.  Also instead of the 15 oz. ricotta I had a 22 (or was it 24) ounce ricotta that was used instead.  I would gladly make this recipe again and find it to be a healthier way to enjoy lasagna.  This dish went great with a spring mix salad. Another serving suggestion is to have some warm french bread with extra virgin olive oil for dipping the bread in.

I loved this recipe!  I added 1 tblspn black pepper, 1 extra tblspn garlic (minced fr jar), 1 extra tblspn basil, 1 tblspn oregano, and 4 serrano peppers diced tiny to the sauce to give extra flavor.  I also added a layer of cooked spinach (25 oz frozen) on top of the ricotta/mozz cheese layer. I limited the mushrooms to just 10oz since I'm not a mushroom fan. It was a big hit!  The cooking time & proportions are accurate.

Super recipe! I tweaked it a lot and I love the way it came out. I used lowfat cottage cheese in place of the ricotta and added 1/2 C of chopped zucchini, shredded carrot, broccoli, and spinach. I used olive oil in place of the veg oil and a red bell pepper in place of the green. The extra veggies led to a little extra sauce left over that I didn't use. I also used the lasagna noodles that you dont have to boil beforehand and they were very flavorful as they soaked up some of the sauce while baking. A healthy way to sneak in some of those good vegetables!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  My husband was hesitant about eating a dish without meat but he quickly changed his mind after a couple bites.  This is a nice alternative to the traditional meaty lasagna and you can swap whatever veggies you prefer to put in.  Definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe was delicous! I agree that there are to many noodles and I used about half of what it calls for. I also added Zucchini and Sundried Tomatoes to the saute for extra flavor.

Oh, this was super! I had a major lasagna craving and it really hit the spot. All I changed was the amount of noodles... I just don't see how you could possibly use that much! And I made 3 layers, so I could have used more of the ricotta mixture. All in all, it was a delicious, cheese-filled lasagna, with lots of yummy mushrooms. Everybody thought it was fantastic. It would be even better I think with cauliflower...

Very good dish! My husband and I don't eat red meat, so we were really excited to try this recipe. I'm glad I did. I think next time I'll add some fresh zucchini and squash. My husband loved it. This will become a regular in my house.

Have made this recipe several times for friends and family - everyone just loves it!!  Made a few adjustments by using a red bell pepper for additional color and then roasting it (wonderful flavor), added spinich, and added some balsamic vinegar to the sauce.  For a lower fat version, I substituted fat-free mozzerella - couldn't tell the difference.  Definately try this recipe!

The lasagna was very good, but the flavors weren't as intense as I would have liked.  We only used 8oz. of noodles, which was a good move because we still had one left over.  We will probably make it again, but with a bit more spice.

Very good!!!  I took a chance and made it for the first time for dinner guests.... it was a hit!!  I cut back on the onions and peppers a little and added spinach to the ricotta mixture.  I used my homemade sauce instead of  store bought and cut it back by half, it would have been way too much sauce.  Definitely make again!

This is a great veggie lasagna recipe. After reading other reviews, I decided to use 1.5 jars of sauce, less noodles, and I added zucchini. I think next time I will add spinach, as well. I also use sliced mozzarella cheese, which is a quick way to layer it on evenly.

We were having friends over for dinner on New Year’s Eve and I was making traditional lasagne but wanted to make another one for some variety.
I’m soooo glad I picked this recipe!!  I used ShopRite pasta sheets instead of boiling pasta noodles (they’re a little thinner and very tender when baked).  I also decided to add some shredded rotisserie chicken to this recipe (but it turned out so flavorful that it really wasn’t needed).
It was absolutely delicious, not dry at all.   
Even when reheated it was still moist.
My company said it was restaurant-worthy!!

I did make a couple changes. I added ground beef to the sauce, half a cup of water and only used 1 jar.  I chopped fresh spinach and added it to the ricotta cheese mixture. I also used ready to bake lasagna noodles.
My family absolutely loved this meal!

The instructions were confusing for a beginner. Do I mix the ricotta, eggs, and mozzarella in a different pan? When do I stop mixing it? Until it looks like a spread? It’s cooking now. Waiting to find out how it tastes

This was awesome. The video was helpful, too. I changed the vegetables and used my own sauce recipe. It was very tasty and will be my go-to for family gatherings (i.e. Thanksgiving for vegetarians) :)

I followed this as written. I wish I cut my mushrooms a little smaller so they came out softer. The slices I had were rather thick. I did have too many noodles. Only needed 12. Now that that's out of the way this was great! Just as good the next day if not better.

I added eggplant, yellow and green zucchini.
Also this recipe allowed me to make one to eat now and one to freeze for latter, had to double the ricotta cheese mixture for two but --- OHMY Goodness this is the BEST LASAGNA I have had in my life. I will never go back..EVER!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR RECIPE

This is a family favorite. I made mine using no-boil lasagna noodles. I didn't even need to simmer the sauce and vegetables before assembling the lasagna. It was super easy and turned out perfectly.

I think it's a good base but bland as-is, and leaving people missing meat.

I served to ten of my friends and received many compliments; however, I added salt to my serving and saw that a couple of my friends did also.  I will add salt to the sauce next time. I also added more mushrooms than the recipe called for.

Used my own sauce, roasted broccoli, red pepper diced and carrots chopped, added shredded zucchini, and mixed ricotta w/ spinach.  Family dinner and they all enjoyed it.  Definitely a hearty meal. Made one tray gluten free for my daughter.  Great family dinner! Modify veggies any way you like them.

Pretty good.  Added broccoli, celery, and used a red onion.  Also went with different flavored sauces for each jar of pasta sauce.

This was a very good recipe.  I made a few changes used red and yellow peppers instead of green, added carrots, broccoli and spinach and added cottage cheese to the ricotta.  It was very very tasty.  Everyone including my husband who does not like anything vegetable loved it.  Will keep in my to make again file.  Thanks for sharing.

Pleasing the whole family is hard. My boys loved this! One son loves cheese and not veggies. One loves veggies and not cheese. This was a nice compromise. I used Romano instead of parmesan. I will definitely make this again!!

I made this lasagne and my family loved it! They did not miss the meat ??. I did add extra veggies: Broccoli, Zucchini, Squash. I also added fresh sautéed spinach to the ricotta mixture. My family are picky eaters so I recommend this recipe to every household. I will try this again vegan and see how it’s cones out????

The best lasagna we’ve ever tasted! I make this so often now, and everyone loves it. It's perfect for people with dietary restrictions such as meat, onions, etc.; and the best part is that you can change it according to what you have in your fridge.

Absolutely loved this recipe. My 5 year old and 8 year old could not get enough! The only sub I made was to cut the mushrooms in half and replaced it with fresh spinach.  A new family favourite!

Added 2 medium zucchini and 2 diced carrots.  Delicious to the vegetarians in the family.  The non-vegetarians prefer lasagna with meat, but thought this recipe was okay.  So it depends on who you are serving.

This is my second time making this . I used a white jar sauce didn't notice it ask for the other. Also added spinach ( rinsed canned) what had on hand and cottage cheese ( hubby doesn't like ricotta).Last use Reg egg noodles (what I had). Anyway like this making this time w/red sauce and spinach. Don't like mushrooms.

Great structure that allows you to play around with the ingredients. Getting the sauce the right consistency is key; allow it to cool down before layering it on top of your cheese mix. Add jalapeño or anything you want! I threw in some chopped fresh basil to the sauce. Play around, have fun. It’s as much of an art as it is a science.

Loved it. The proportions were perfect. I added lots of salt to the veggies while cooking (I find this necessary for flavor) and I used two handfuls of spinach and fewer mushrooms instead of bell pepper which I can’t stand. Shared it with my roommate and she loved it too. Will definitely make it again.

Like many others stated..you NEED to add some seasoning. I added oregano and Italian seasoning. I added a tbsp of red wine to bring the flavor out. I used broccoli,  carrots, red/green peppers, and spinach.  Also, I used low-fat ricotta cheese and layered it with low-fat mozzarella. I used a jar and a half of the sauce. I think it came out yummy.

We loved this wonderful recipe...however the photo is a misrepresentation of the recipe as it clearly includes broccoli and does not have near the amount of spaghetti sauce. I would like to get the recipe for the lasagna in the photo too :-). The video appears to be spot on. Irregardless, I appreciate the time Sue took to create and share this delicious dish!

I've been looking for a lasagna with mushrooms and this is a great one! I used portobellos, red peppers instead of green, a  grated zucchini and grated carrot in the pan with the onions and garlic. Don't forget to add a good amount of Salt and Pepper--with all these veggies, it needs it. I also added frozen chopped spinach to the ricotta. I didn't use all the lasagna noodles (the pan was full to the top with 3 layers). This was moist and delicious.

As other viewers suggested, I added the spinach to the ricotta and I added zucchini, broccoli and carrots. It was delicious!

We made some slight modifications and served it at a Progressive Dinner with our neighbors.  Got lots of compliments!   I added 2 cups spinach (next time I will probably add 4) and I layered the veggies instead of mixing in the sauce.  It was delicious.

Such a good classic staple recipe! I change the veggie mixture up a little bit. I do broccoli, red onion, mushroom, and sliced eggplant. Otherwise the recipe is the same and it comes out great every time.

Haven't made it yet but it looks easy enough and also easy enough to add what ever your hearts desire to it. I was think zucchini and broccoli would be good. Sense I don't care for mushrooms though I'd probably saute' separately and only add them to the top so that I can easily remove them and still allow others who do like to have them. Just my thought for ideas.

Well, this was certainly a fun dish! My Girlfriend and I made this together. We had a blast! It came out so well, we have to make this again. We topped this with Ramano. It was perfect. This wil always be a go-to dish from now on.

I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, based on personal preference. That was the best lasagna I've ever had! Didn't miss the meat at all. I imagine you could use almost any vegetable combination and it would be good.

This is a wonderfully hearty recipe that my husband gives 2 thumbs up to.  I did not use nearly as many lasagna noodles and I used the oven ready kind which worked out great. I used all the vegetables called for in the recipe, but can see that many other vegetables could be added in.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I will likely never add meat to my lasagna ever again this was so good. I did make some slight changes. I added spinach and the vegetable medley to the ricotta mixture and instead of going the traditional route I laid out the noodles and added the mixture and then rolled them up placed them in rows of 3 smothered them with sauce and sprinkled them with cheese then baked

This was a wonderful meal and was made for company along with the meat version. Everyone enjoyed it! I added about 2-3 cups of steamed broccoli  o th sauce which made it mor meatier. I will definitely use this recipe again as a base to make again.

We all thought this was delicious. We made homemade sheets of pasta for the noodles and added chopped fresh spinach to the ricotta mixture - those were our only changes. We also used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe along with this - would definitely make it again and I rarely make the same thing twice. Yum!

This was actually a pretty easy recipe and it came out perfectly. My boyfriend raved about it for days. I added a few extra ingredients: shredded carrots, fresh spinach, zucchini, broccoli, a 1/2 cup more ricotta cheese and fresh basil instead of dried. Yummy!

Best veggie lasagna I have ever made!  I added some zuchinni and broccoli as well as some spinach and let it all simmer together in the sauce.   I did use less sauce, about 1.5 jars in total and it came out really good!

The ONLY changes I made were to omit the bell pepper and to use cottage cheese rather than Ricotta. I used Crimini mushrooms, which have great flavor. In the future, I will also try this with chopped spinach, as someone else suggested. This recipe is amazing!  Will be making this much more often in the future!!

Added spinach and tomatoes to make it heartier. Should have steamed and drained the spinach before adding as it added a LOT of liquid to the dish. Otherwise it was delicious!

My family enjoyed this meal!  I felt I needed to make sure that this recipe was flavorful so I made the following changes. I added thawed chopped spinach and garlic salt to the ricotta cheese mixture.  I used a basil garlic pasta sauce and added a little balsamic vinegar, garlic salt and oregano.  I also used a lot  more parmesan cheese than it called for.  I loved knowing we were eating a super healthy meal that tastes so good.

The perfect lasagna! I did make the following changes based on others reviews - 
Veggies - broccoli, carrots and zucchini plus I added a pack of frozen spinach to the ricotta mixture.
Spices - onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, rosemary, salt and pepper added to the veggies.
Only used 1/2 pack of lasagna noodles and 1 bottle of pasta sauce.

I didn't have a pound of mushrooms so I added some roasted broccoli. Also I substituted homemade buttermilk cheese for the ricotta.  My husband, who comes from an Italian meat-eating family, said it was the best lasagne he's ever had. I agreed with a happy smile for the saved cows and pigs!

It was really good! I added extra veggies (broccoli/shoestring carrots/cherry tomatoes) I made the mistake of using no boil noodles.... next time I will use regular noodles also I haven't pinned it down yet but it needs a little kick or zest I will be making this again :)

I was very  happy with the results.  I added zucchini to the sauce mixture to make up for having a smaller amount of green bell pepper. Also used oven-ready lasagna that worked fine.

I loved the concept of veggies in it. But as the other reviewer said I too used olive oil. I didn't have Ricotta Cheese with me so instead I used some sour cream & mayonnaise  with mixed cheese. Though I was scared the mixture will run through while cooking but was amazed to see the texture. I used some parsley flakes too in the sauce. All in all this was a great hit with my family. And yes I will definitely make it again!

Made this for 24 people and it was most talked about at the party. Added spinach and extra sauce on the side. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this dish for my granddaughter's birthday dinner because she is vegetarian.  Even my meat eating family members liked it.  I substituted cottage cheese because I'm not a fan of ricotta.  Didn't seem to affect the final result.  It was yummy!  I would make it again.

I had family over last night and one of my cousins is a vegetarian, so I made this recipe. I had read a lot of the reviews, so I too added a lot more veggies, and I also added spinach and roasted peppers to the ricotta mix. I also only needed one jar of sauce but this was a huge hit! Loved it!

Awesome recipe!!! I substituted zucchini instead of mushrooms and it came out superb! Don't forget to salt the zucchini and let drain for 10 minutes to extract the water or it will be soggy.  I also added fresh basil from my garden. Use only the best pasta sauce like reos or home made...don't skimp on this part! Will be making this again soon. Very easy.

Great vegetable lasagna, big hit with my husband and kids! I did take others advice ditched the bell pepper and threw in more vegetables. I added eggplant and spinach. There are five of us, three young kids so I baked half and froze the other half for another night!

We loved this recipe, I added fresh organic broccoli tips, fresh spinach, organic portabella mushrooms and used fat free ricotta cheese, light shredded mozerlla, Trader Joe's vodka sauce and no boil organic Lasagna. It was delicious! Love the taste of all the vegetables. Added crushed red pepper I picked up in Istanbul, Turkey for a kick.

Delish - but I didn't make it exactly the way it is written here.  Made alongside a meaty lasagna to serve my vegetarian guests and everyone else.  It was definitely good!  I read some reviews and decided to add some peeled carrot and baby spinach, and use fresh herbs and EVO.  I made sauce from scratch for both recipies and used that.  Also, I didn't cook the noodles before hand, just soaked them in very hot water for an hour while I was putting the rest of the dish together - it was nerve wracking to try that, but it baked up beautifully.  Made everything the night before and let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to bake it.

Like others said, I added broccoli, zucchini, spinach, and carrots. Also added chopped spinach to the egg and cheese mixture. Next time I will add black olives (maybe grilled chicken.)  Also I will cover the first 30 minutes of baking.

Good recipe but I made the following changes. I added zucchini, yellow squash, fresh tomatoes and some chopped fresh thyme, basil and oregano to the vegetable mixture. I added an extra egg as well. I also added fresh spinach between the layers. I used one  jar of sauce. I put half in the bottom of the pan ant the other half on top. I used ready cook noodles. It was delicious!

Loved it and so did the people I made it for...I read a lot of the comments and modified the recipe a little from many reviews. Used Barilla noodles so no cooking of the noodles and used prego spaghetti sauce to cut some corners. Sautéed all veggies in olive oil - mushrooms, zucchini, celery, carrots, onions. Also added spinach and roasted red peppers to the ricotta cheese mixture. I really feel the roasted red peppers gave the lasagna great taste! A favorite for sure!

Awesome! This became a quick family fave the first time I made it and it's now my go to recipe. I use a half package of green lasagna noodles, skip the basil and parmesan, then add fried up spinach to the ricotta mixture and broccoli + zucchini to the sauce. Serve with a big leafy salad and everyone is happy and sated.

I recently became a vegetarian and wanted to try new foods and I am so glad that I found this recipe. I honestly had some doubts with this recipe (I have not had the best experiences with online recipes) and I was blown away! So good and easy to make! I highly recommend using a high quality pasta sauce though. It makes a HUGE impact. I also recommend adding some zucchini and maybe some other veggies to the dish as well.  All in all, my entire family loved it and it's definitely worth a try!

Pretty easy dish to make and definitely one that fills. I broke away from the standard recipe a bit, by adding one jar of tomato sauce and one jar of marinara to give it some extra kick and it definitely helped.

It's a good dish.  Although you only need 1/2 a box (8oz) of noodles.  I used garlic powder instead of the cloves since I didn't have any.  Added zucchini and shredded carrots to the sauce and spinach to the ricotta. Using 2 jars of sauce was  too much, so next time I will cut it in half.  Also I will probably add some parsley and other spices next time as well.

THANK YOU. THIS IS THE FIRST VEG LASAGNE THAT WORKED FOR ME. I ADDED A FEW SQUIRTS OF HOT SAUCE AND ONE ZUCCHINI. I USED HOMEMADE PASTA SAUCE BUT THINK  A STORE BOUGHT GOOD QUALITY BRAND WOULD SUFFICE. THE EXTRA SPRINKLE OF PHARMESAN CHEESE MELTED ON TOP BEFORE SERVING DEFINITELY ADDED GOODNESS. I USED AN 11"X15" DISH AND USED 14 NOODLES. IF YOU USE A 13"X9" DISH, 12 NOODLES WOULD BE RIGHT.

Since my husband doesn't like ricotta cheese, I omitted it, and just used the 4 cups of cheese (that was plenty).  I added chopped carrots, zucchini, summer squash, spinach and drained diced tomatoes to the mix.  I only used 1 jar of sauce and even my "meat and potatoes" husband and son loved this.

I've made this lasagna a few times now, and we love it. I add a layer of sliced zucchini and I think next time I will also add spinach in the ricotta mixture, as others have advised.

A very good, basic lasagna.  I, following other reviews, replaced the green pepper with broccoli - I used 2 heads, cut into small florets.  I also added frozen cut spinach.  While sauteing the vegetables, I added some ground black pepper, crushed red pepper (about 1 tsp) and salt.  I also added salt to the ricotta.  When putting it together, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese and dried basil in between layers and then topped with mozzarella at the end.  In total, I used about 1.5 jars of store-bought spaghetti sauce (Tomato-Basil variety).  I loved the broccoli in this dish!

This was pretty good. It makes a lot. I think adding eggplant and/or zucchini would be a great idea, and if I make this again that's what I'll do.

I made this tonight for my vegetarian daughter, so i reduced the ingredients and made it in an aluminum bread loaf pan. I also added 1 sliced de-seeded jalapeno  because she loves her spice.  She really enjoyed it and I got 2 big slices out of it so i can freeze one and save myself some time this week from cooking for 1 vegetarian in a family of 4!

I used more mushrooms and started cooking them first, then added the remaining ingredients to saute without adding oil because of the liquid that expelled from the mushrooms.  I accidentally used more mozzarella than called for, but you can never go wrong with more mozzarella.  Very easy and straightforward recipes.

I followed someone else's suggestion to add carrots, broccoli and zucchini to the vegetable mix and add spinach to the cheese mixture and it was a massive hit!

Going to try this time with a vegetarian bolognese sauce (ground soy rounds) and I think it will add a new dimension.

Will now be a staple in my house!

This lasagna tastes great.  I was a little hesitant about making it because I like lasagna made with meat, however, this tastes great! You honestly cannot tell that it doesn't have meat in it!  I used 1/2 the amount of mushrooms, and a total of nine lasagna noodles (three layers)  I will make it again.

didn't miss the neat all! Huge hit with everyone at the party! I tripped the recipe. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. I used oven ready lasagna to negate the need to boil the pasta. I added zucchini and eggplant. (You could can add any veggies, squash, carrots, broccoli etc) I seasoned the veggies w fresh Italian herbs, salt, pepper and a generous helping of franks red hot sauce. I simply added the Parmesan cheese to the ricotta mix and season the ricotta mix with fresh Italian herbs, salt/pepper.

Like most people said,use fresh vegetables! I didn't use cottage cheese,used ricotta low fat instead and 16 ounces of fresh spinach. Didn't add brown sugar,followed the advice of most reviews and went with one can of tomato sauce,worked out fine. I did use baby Bella mushrooms, fresh. The only thing I did that was new for me was to use my chopper for the zucchini and onion-amazing! This dish has so many opportunities for variety,can't wait to experiment. Thank you to everyone who reviewed and to the original author. This was my first time to make lasagna and it rocked! And

I put in a pinch more of red pepper flakes for a kick. Yum! Only thing I found was that I had to cook my pasta longer than 10 minutes since it was to al dente for me.

The first time I made this, it lasted me a week (as it's just me eating it) because it was so good. I decided for my company's Christmas potluck months later I was going to make this-I made two 13x9 pans of it and only had about 4 pieces left! It was a major hit. Absolutely delicious. 

One thing I noticed-I never used the full lasagna noodle package. I always had about 4-6 noodles left over. I read a review on here about someone adding spinach to their ricotta which is definitely something I'm going to try when I make it this weekend!

I changed the ricotta cheese to mozzarella cheese in the kitchen that I work in feeding people unable to pay for food, and I made my own personal account so that I could save it so that I can have my own copy of the recipe for my family's holiday meal.

I made this for a vegetarian dish at a teacher luncheon and lots of them seemed to like it.  I added lightly sauted squash and zucchini and some basil and parsley.  I only used 1 1/2 jars of sauce.  I think I also added chopped fresh spinach (about 1 cup) as I layered with the sauce.  I've made it several times now and its a favorite veggie recipe.

This recipe is a staple... But I make it vegan. Just use puréed cauliflower mixed with basil, oregano, salt, pepper and garlic as the base for the filling :) my hubby (the carnivore) actually loves it!

This is the veggie lasagna recipe I have been searching for.  It was delicious and easy to assemble.  I added some homegrown zucchini and fresh basil before sautéing.  I simplified the recipe by using Trader Joes no boil lasagna noodles.

My fiancé loved this lasagna.  It is flavorful, filling, and delicious.  We didn't notice that it didn't have meat in it.  I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of powdered garlic and a Prego Roasted Garlic and Herb Sauce.  We are definitely going to make this again.  We plan on freezing it and trying that out.

Great recipe! Hearty, indeed! Like other reviewers I did add more veggies...spinach, fire roasted tomatoes, zucchini, black olives, red peppers. It made a HUGE pan, so making two smaller pans and freezing one might be a good idea.

The only thing I did differently was use whole wheat lasagna noodles.  It was fantastic!  I didn't miss the meat at all, and my picky, health-conscious daughter even loved it!  When I make it again (a definite) I'd like to try adding zucchini and spinach.  Delicious! Thank you!

First time making veggie lasagna and must say it turned out scrumptious  it's not overly cheesy which we loved, and the sauce is tasty, we didn't change the recipe except we used olive oil! Yummy recipe!

This was just wonderful and will be a new vegetarian staple for me. My boyfriend, who is a huge carnivore loved it and said you did not miss the meat at all.

As others suggested, I added chopped broccoli, zucchini, and 1 carrot to the veggie mix. I cut the mushrooms and only used about 1/3.

I only used 1.5 jars of pasta sauce, but made sure it was a good quality sauce (I used Rao).

I added a little bit of frozen/thawed spinach to the ricotta mix.

I added some salt, pepper, and oregano to the pasta sauce for more flavor. 

Finally, I used the no-boil pasta noodles. 

Thanks for an amazing recipe!

It was good. I rate the recipe as written with a 4.5. In my 9 x 13 glass dish I could only fit 12 noodles (3 noodles x 4 layers) I didnt have green pepper and not overly fond of them so I substituted spinach.  I loved the mushrooms and used a jar and a half of fresh mushroom prego. I used 12 oz fresh mozzarella, the ricotta and 5 oz of fresh parm. It was perfect for the 12 noodles and came out to 300 calories for 1/12th of the pan. I would make it again.

When my husband found out he was having veggie lasagna for dinner, he wasn't thrilled.  After tasting it, he said "this is delicious!" I followed some others advice, using more veggies like zucchini and yellow squash and also used home made marinara instead of jar pasta sauce.  Yummy!

A top notch veggie lasagna. Used one-half box of oven-ready lasagna noodles. Added more veggies, including fresh baby spinach, Italian parsley, and carrots. Drained off small amount of water from sautéed veggies before adding the pasta sauce which keeps the lasagna from being soupy. Based on reviewer’s comments, reduced pasta sauce to 1-1/2 jars but will likely use 2 jars suggested in recipe next time. Subbed basil paste for dried basil. Used part-skim mozzarella cheese, and reduced the amount on top to 1 cup which is sufficient. A definite make again recipe.

This was so good, everyone loved it! They started eating without me while I was cutting up some rosemary bread for a side. If you add fresh spinach to saute with the other veggies, it goes well.

this recipe sounds very good...saved it to try in the future.  But....didn't anyone else notice that the veggie layer was never mentioned in the instructions for putting the lasagna together??  I suppose you add the veggies in layers between the noodles/sauce and ricotta mixture.

I suggest replacing green pepper with Pablano or Jalapeno pepper.  I use a stalk of bok choy in my lasagna.  Black olives are a great addition, along with the use of olive oil.  The choice of spaghetti sauce makes an enormous difference, Classico having a good mushroom and black olive sauce.

This lasagna makes for a fabulous dining experience! My husband, who does not care for meatless dinners, loved it and had two giant pieces! Our guests all asked for the recipe!  (You know it's good when your company heads out the door with recipe in hand!!)
I added cooked spinach to the ricotta mix and added a carrot and small zuchinni to the the list of vegetables.  I made my own tomato sauce, so that made it really tasty.  A friend of ours is Italian and he says that lasagna is like building a sandwich.  You can add any combination of vegetables that you like.
Thanks to Sue!  This will be a family favourite!

Very tasty but I don't see how it qualifies as a vegetable lasagna when the only veggies are the onion and pepper. Whatever. I liked it and of my three picky kids, two ate it with no problems. Number three informed me tonight that she "doesn't like lasagna with cheese in it". The girl is going to drive me crazy. 

All in all, a good recipe worth keeping.

It was great.  I reduced the amount of mushrooms to about a quarter pound and added spinach instead.  I also reduced the amount of sauce to about 1.5 jars, based on what other reviewers said.

This is excellent.  I added additional vegetables, and sauteed some chicken to add for my non-veggie family members.

This was a great recipe and easy.  I didn't add mushrooms because allergic.  I did add Zucchini, Squash, and some spinach.  My guests were impressed.

I tried this recipe and found it to be to bland. I added more salt, garlic and frozen chopped spinach that I squeezed dry and of turned out way better.

Super YUMMY! I chose not use eggs in the cheese mixture. 
I also added carrots and celery and little bit of ketchup to the sauce:) 
I used oven ready pasta, which made the top layer of the pasta a little harder than I would have preferred. Next time I will stick to boil first:)

Excellent lasagna!  I left out the onions and added zucchini, carrots, and spinach.  I also stirred some chia seeds into the cheese - no one ever suspected they were getting a nutritional bonus.

This was okay, but not great. It was more work and took longer than I expected, and after all that it wasn't as good as the frozen veg. lasagna I buy.

Great recipe!!!  I reduced the mozz. cheese in half to lighten it up, and I didn't feel like I missed the extra cheese.  I will definetly add spinach to it next time I make it.

i absolutely love this recipe. i've made this recipe at least 20 times. as a vegetarian, its right up my alley, but everyone who's eaten it says its delicious. sometimes, adding a bit of hot italian sausage pacifies them, but i love it just the way it is. thank you so much for sharing it!!!

This was very good I did what some of the others on here suggested and added some black pepper, oregano, basil and red crushed pepper to the veggies.

Everyone loved it, my husband who is a big meat eater said he didnt miss the meat!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Its soo easy and soo tasty!  I followed the suggestion of another rater and added seasoned salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and basil to the vegetables.  I also used a bag of italian style vegetable blend that I found in the frozen section of the grocery store.   I've made this dish twice now, once for my roomate and another time for my sister and her husband.  Everyone totally loved it!!

A rather tastey recipe that all of my family (friends and roomates) loved.  I used more mozzarella cheese on top of the lasagna than suggested the second time around, and used a zucchini instead of mushrooms, which was very much to my liking. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is delicious!!  I just made it today for my brother's birthday and it was fantastic.  I didn't add the onions, garlic or bell peppers because I didn't have them, but it still turned out fantastic.  I also used fresh basil instead of dried and I used the no boil lasagna noodles.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  I only altered the instructions in the veggies I used ... substituting a bag of whole spinach leaves for half of the mushrooms, one onion, half a green pepper and half a red pepper.  Came out very moist, and held it's structure well.  My non-vegetarian boyfriend loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe gets rave reviews everytime I make it.  The only thing I do differently is add zucchini, yellow squash and broccoli to the mix so it is a true vegetable lasagna.

Quite mediocre taste-wise, yet complicated and time-concuming to make. Good for a party though.

Awesome! As mentioned by another reviewer, you really only need half the noodles...but then again, I added more vegies than called for such as carrots, fresh spinach, and lightly steamed chopped aparagus. I did not have fresh mushrooms but canned worked great. To save some calories, I didn't use quite all the cheese listed in the recipe. I also added some crushed fennel--delightful meal with bread sticks and salad!

The taste was really flavorable and lighter than most lasagna.  The prep time was more than 30 minutes- but well worth the effort!

The only reason I gave this 3 stars was because it calls for jarred pasta sauce.  I made it twice - once as written and the second time with crushed tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh garlic.  Much better if you make your own pasta sauce.  I also suggest adding any veggie you love - mushrooms is a good start.

I'm not a vegetarian, but just cooked this for my mom for dinner tonight and we both had 2nd helpings.. which never happens!!  It was light tasting, but filling, and totally pleasant all the way through!  This might very well be my new lasagna recipe :)   Yum!

This is the first time I ever made lasagna and it came out great! I made it healthy by using as many vegetables as possible! In addition to onion, mushrooms, and peppers, I also used broccoli, zucchini, and spinach; and also my own homemade marinara sauce. I also tried to keep the calories count down by using low fat cheeses and only using mozzarella cheese on top. It also freezes really well. I work nights so I froze the individual slices and it's a perfect dinner to bring along to work.

I made this yesterday for my girlfriend. Excellent!!! On the advice of a friend who has made this before, I added spinach, zucchini, and broccoli. The lasagna had a lot of flavor and held together nicely. My girlfriend had 3 helpings so it must have been good!

Amazing Recipe I seem to attract those really annoying people that only eat the non living and they all rave about this recipe. I tripled the garlic and used my homemade spagetti sauce I also used 2 kinds of mushrooms the regular kind (name?) and portabellos which gave it a very hearty flavor.

This veggie lasagna was a really great recipe - even the people who aren't crazy about veggies loved it!  I made it for a family dinner and everyone loved it.  I did make some small changes - I only used about half of the mushrooms (and bought pre-sliced) and substituted zucchini and spinach for the mushrooms.  I sliced the zucchini and added it to the sauce mixture (with about 5 minutes of cooking time left) and I put two layers of spinach on its own to the lasagna (bought frozen spinach).  I also used an orange pepper instead of the green pepper the recipe called for and I used the oven ready lasagna noodles.  It was a hit and I'd definitely recommend making it !  I will definitely be making this one again.

This was fantastic and I will never make a lasagna with meat again--this is so much better!  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and the second time I made it (for 4 guests who absolutely loved it) I added spinach.  A little cheddar cheese mixed in with the mozzarella is really good too.

Amazing!!! Made this 3 times with modifications each time. Doubled the veggies and cut back on cheese this time. Carrots make it nice and sweet. Have added zucchini, spinach, summer squash, carrots, peppers, onions, mushrooms...excellent!!

Sooooo good!  However, I made these changes and it came out even better: cut the noodles in half (i used pre cooked noodles to cut down the prep time), double the ricotta cheese and use all four cups mozzarella cheese in ricotta mixture (makes the sauce to cheese to noodle ratio more balanced), and finish with two cups chedder cheese on top!  A great and BIG lasagna, and really easy and quick prep work!  Good for leftovers....

I changed this recipe around a little bit and absolutely loved the result.  First of all, I added several stalks of chopped celery to the saute; I also added 32 oz. of frozen spinach and an extra 15 oz. can of tomato sauce.  To the ricotta mixture I added one more cup of mozerella and another egg.  And to each layer I sprinkled about 3/4 cup of extra mozerella (I had a lot of cheese I needed to use up...).  This made a lot of lasagna, but its so good it will get eaten up in no time! thanks!

Excellent!  i made it for a dinner party and it was devoured.  i bought the mushrooms pre-sliced so i could cut out that step and chopped the onion and green pepper that morning so it wasn't a rush at the last minute.  i served w/ "garlic parmesan olives" that are on this site and they went GREAT together.  everyone just kept eating.
