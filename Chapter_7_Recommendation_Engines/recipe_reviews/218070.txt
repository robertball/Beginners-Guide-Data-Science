Due to bad planning on my part, these stayed in my fridge for 48 hours before being grilled tonight.  YUMMY!!!  Hubby says it's the best pork chop he's had in a long time. Tender, juicy, tasty, extremely easy to put together, this is no brainer for my regular summer rotation.  Thanks for posting this keeper. Don't change a thing, it's perfect as is.

Easy, quick, and delicious.  The pork came out very juicy and flavorful. The only change I made was to add a little ginger.   A repeat recipe, for sure!

I was looking for a different way to fix pork chops on the grill and tried this recipe.  This is a definite 5 star!

These were very very good.  I have been making a variation of these for 3 decades using a marinade I got from the old Steak and Ale restaurants when I was a bartender there while in college.  That marinade consisted of the pineapple juice, sherry and soy sauce in a 3:2 ratio in the order listed.  I always added some ginger also, either 1 inch of grated fresh or 2 tsp. dried.  I also marinate the pineapple slices separately in another ziplock and grill the entire can of slices.  My family always wanted several slices of pineapple served on top of their grilled chicken breasts.  The real key is the time you marinate and I do that for at least 8 hours or overnight.  Makes the meat so juicy that way because the acid in the juice helps tenderize the meat. This also works well on a nice cut of steak, the old 'Kensington Club' on S&A's menu. Same marinade. Your brown sugar addition makes a nicer glaze as it carmelizes while grilling so you get 5 + stars!!  Wild rice and steamed broccoli or asparagus goes great along with a mixed greens salad.  Thank you for a great recipe with the addition of your spices and brown sugar. I did decrease the amount of brown sugar the second time I made this recipe because the sherry I have always added made it too sweet with the amount of brown sugar called for. I do like your recipe very much and I use it when I don't happen to have sherry on hand. Try it my way once and decrease the brown sugar by half along with adding the ginger. Thanks again.!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  It is super easy and very yummy.  I actually chose to bake it since my grill wasn't accessible and it came out great.  I baked it at 425 F for 15 min.  My husband said it was the best pork chop he's ever had.

I made these as directed and wow, are they ever good!!  They were made even better by the addition of a nice slice of sharp cheddar cheese on top after grilling; these were even more amazing that way and I will continue to make that addition when I make this recipe in the future.

I found this recipe when looking for something new to try on the grill. It looked interesting so I gave it a try. I was unsure of how much I would like it- the marinade doesn't smell very appealing. But the finished product is soooooo good! Definately adding this to my favorite meals for the grill!!!

These were so tasty.  My husband doesn't typically like pork chops like these.  I had a whole pork loin that I cut into slices that I used, so I could make them as thin or thick as I wanted.  I also only marinated for about 8 hours and the flavor was yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious recipe.  I only marinated for 3 hours and they came out perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly except I simmered the remaining marinade till it thickened and then poured it over the chops.  Can't wait to try this on chicken!

As our grill was out of order this weekend I resorted to broiling them in the oven. They turned out great! About 5-8 min per side, just like the recipe says to do on the grill. I caremelized the pineapple in a skillet on high with a little bit of butter and about two tablespoons of brown sugar. It was a hit. Definitely will use this one again.

This was a great sauce for chicken, I didn't have any pork chops just chicken breasts...so I pan fried the chicken in a little oil.  Then poured the sauce over the chicken pieces and popped the pan in the oven for about 45 minutes, delicious!!  served with white rice and corn kernels....The kids loved this dinner, very yummy.....

I have had this recipe forever.
I had this in Hamilton NZ 20 odd years ago and asked the chef for the recipe. This marinade was / is used for beef steaks. Does have ginger in it which gives it a more balanced flavour over all.

Delicious! A big hit!  I saved the marinade, boiled it to kill any bacteria from the raw pork, then added just a bit of corn starch to slighty thicken it. Put it on the table as a sauce if so desired.

Superb! I just joined today and wanted to find something wonderful to make tonight for my wife and family and these pork chops were the bomb! The only thing is I never pour used marinade over my cooked meat...sounds like trouble to me.

This is so delicious!  I've made this twice. The second time, due to a malfunctioning pop top, I ended up making the marinade with crushed pineapple juice.  A little of the crushed pineapple got into the marinade.  It made the pork chops much more tasty.  This is simple and definitely guest-worthy!

We really liked this meal. I served with cilantro lime rice, and broccoli. I used pineapple chunks, because that's what I had on hand. Next time, I would make double the marinade, and heat it up, using it as a sauce for dipping the pork chops in.

This was a very flavor filled meat.  The chops were tender and juicy.  And the pineapple flavoring added something special.  I don't own a grill so I used my George Foreman grill.  I think once I buy an actual grill it will be fantastic!

This marinade is great.  I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts as I didn't have pork. 
I used a suggestion from another reviewer and added fresh ginger.
 I browned the chicken after marinading, put pineapple on top and baked at 350 for about 20 mins.  Next time I will use pork, I am sure it will also be great.

Used boneless sirloin chops for this recipe. I did add in a bit of onion and garlic powder, and sesame seeds. The chops were juicy tender and the pineapple gives a wonderful tropical flavor. I served with wild rice with bell peppers, onions and more pineapple mixed in.... Hawaiian rice.

These did not go over well at my house, sorry.  Even my teenage daughter, who loves terriyaki flavoured dishes and is open minded to trying new things wouldn't eat more than a few bites.

I have the worse luck with pork chops. They always turn out dry but.......not these.  Followed the recipe as written and the pork chops turned out so tender.  Will do these again and soon!

I really liked this recipe.  I don't have a grill so I broiled the chops instead, and decided to make these into burgers topped with pineapple, onion and lettuce. I thought they were tender and good.  I plan to use this marinade for chicken burgers as well.

An excellent change-up for pork chops, at least for us because we usually eat them grilled or smoked with BBQ sauce, or breaded and fried.

This was delicious! Easy, no need to change a thing. I even accidentally put a bit of powdered ginger in, thinking it was an ingredient, but it still came out perfectly delicious. Warning: the marinade doesn't smell all that great initially! *If you want to use the marinade as a sauce, glaze or gravy, BE SURE to boil it for a few minutes to destroy any bacteria from the raw pork!* I made a yummy gravy by whisking about a tblsp of flour a little at a time until it was smooth, thickened and bubbly. Served the chops with slices of grilled pineapple rings, sauteed crispy shallots, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Different and delicious. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

I prepared this just like it said and it came out delicious! I was very surprised because it doesn't "look" that way at first. I bought the really thick pork chops and they came out extremely tender. I don't recommend marinating them longer than 24 hours, that's the only mistake I made. I left them in there longer (about a day and a half) and they started to get mushy from the marinade but that was my fault. I think next time I'll add teriyaki to it and definitely a little ginger but even if you prepare it exactly as the directions say, it is definitely good! Will definitely make again and it can't be any easier either!!!!

This was a keeper! The marinade is easy, and didn't need any exotic ingredients. I made it exactly as it was written, and it was a huge success. I will make this often. (even my fussy three year-old grandson loved it!)

I followed the recipe to a tee except that I used thin cut pork chops so I only marinated it for 8 hours and cooked it on an indoor grill pan. Turned out wonderfully - very tender and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!

I don't even typically like porkchops but these were amazing. The pineapple really make the meat juicy and sweet. Eating the pineapple with the pork was my preference, but my husband swore to eat them seperate because he thought the fruit made the meat overly complicated. This will be a staple in our house going forward. I've never wanted anything for left overs 3 days in a row like I wanted these! And I was so sad we had eaten them all in the first sitting. I'm going to go home and make more!

Made this tonight, although I prepared the marinade two nights ago. Put frozen pork chops into the marinade and didn't use it until today. Because we can't use real sugar, I used brown sugar substitute. It didn't matter. Grilled the chops on medium in my grill pan; then grilled the pineapple slices. Served it over a Pad Thai using fresh scallions and portabello mushrooms. YUM, YUM, YUM.

If there are better grilled chops out there, please don't tell me!! I'd be eating them all day, every day! This recipe rocked so hard! The chops were tender and sweet. They literally melt in your mouth. Wanna be the hit of your Memorial Day BBQ? Serve these chops! I doubled the recipe and took a few of the rings and chopped them up for the marinade. Ya... in fact, I might have to eat them again tonight!! Way to go!! Definite winner!!

Loved these.  I love the pineapple with the pork.  All the flavors when well together.  You have to be careful when you grill these due to the sugar in the marinade as they can burn if you don't watch over them.  I boiled the left over marinade and basted during grilling.  I will for sure make these again.  Next time I might add some asian chili sauce to give them a nice spicy kick.. which would go great with the sweet of the meat.

I used pork steaks instead of pork chops and they were great.  I did not place fruit on my husbands pork however he did have the pineapple juice in the sauce and loved it.  He hates fruit on his meat.

I marinated pork loin chops overnight and we really enjoyed them.  The grilled pineapple was particularly good.

These pork chops are absolutely amazing as is! I wouldn't change a thing and I will be making these again. My husband says it is now one his favorites. I served these with asparagus and squash & zucchini with onions for a light dinner. YUM!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the marinade ingredients because I had 5 thick pork chops.  They grilled nicely and the pineapple slices added a nice touch.

These were delicious! I've been searching for a good pork chop recipe for quite a while, and these were a big hit at the dinner table.  Very tender & juicy, and the marinade is delicious!  Don't know if I'll ever cook pork chops another way!

Made this with Chicken Breast, marinated over night. Grilled. Ooops, forget to grill the pineapple. Still turned out great.The family loved this. Made it with rice cooked in chicken stock and added some mixed vegetables for the last 5 minutes. Chopped up the chicken and made a kind of Rice Bowl meal. Easy and great meal. Thank you

I made these pork chops for my family and everyone loved them. Preparing the marinade was simple and quick. My son who has worked in the kitchen of a fine dining establishment said it worthy of their menu! That is the ultimate compliment. I would not change a thing.

these chops were a huge hit.  I just used pineapple juice instead of canned pineapples.  I think I will add honey to the marinade next time too.

Melt in your mouth goodness!  My husband is usually not a fan of pork chops, well he ate 2 1/2 of the 4 I made!!! My daughter even gobbled hers right up! Moist, flavorful and delicious. These were quick on the grill, done in about 10 minutes. Definately a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, and was disappointed. 
Looking back, however, a lot of the people who gave it 5 stars had added their own touches. I marinated them over night, but while they were very moist, they didn't seem to have enough of the marinade flavor. IF I made them again, I would marinate them longer than called for and maybe try adding some of the ingredients that others suggested, like ginger. One good thing, my son ate about 4 bites, and he usually won't even look at meat. When I commented about it, he said," this is better than you usually cook them." I think that was a compliment!

I use low sodium soy sauce and a little bit less soy than noted and think it is amazing. Fabulous with grilled asparagus.

One word - Awesome!!!! Chops must marinate overnight for the full effect of this simple marinade. Absolutely the best grilled pork chop recipe on the planet - IMO.

This didn't wow me but it was very easy to make.  I marinated the meat overnight.  I simmered and reduced the marinate to make it as the sauce for over 30 min but it was still watery.  I think it'll be better with a bit of tweaking.

I made a pineapple salsa to top the pork chops with and it was amazing!  Very healthy too.  I don't know if I would have liked the recipe as much without the salsa so that's why I gave it 4 stars. See my photo!

This is a great recipe, but a little too sweet (according to my hubby.)
Next time I will cut back on the pineapple juice, but will make again.

this is so easy and so delicious.  I have made it many times and everyone raves about it.  I don't throw out the marinade though, I boil it good then add some water and cornstarch to thicken and serve as a sauce with the chops and pineapple, yummy

I made a double batch (8 chops) and added 1/8 teaspoon of ground ginger (the same amount of black pepper I used). The standard US 20oz can of pineapple contains 10 rings and 2/3 cup juice; I used the fruit from one can and the juice from two cans for my double batch, and the flavor was perfect. Doubling the recipe probably didn't actually require doubling the marinade, but doing so made a good amount extra to baste with; I also basted the grilling pineapple, and that turned out great. UPDATE: I have since made this recipe with chicken and it was delicious. This time I made the original amount of marinade and it was plenty for 6 chicken breasts, cut into bite-size chunks. I threaded the meat onto skewers with pineapple chunks and sweet onion and grilled for 15-20 minutes. Delicious!

Love, love, love! The first time I made this I only let the chops soak about 6 hours( I didn't plan ahead, and just found the recipe that morning!), they were good. The second time I gave them a full 24 hours and what a world of difference! It went from good to excellent!! Try and give yourself at least 24 hours of soak time.

Very good marinade. It imparts a subtle sweet and salty flavor to the meat, and helps keep the pork juicy and moist. I thought I may have over cooked the chops, but they were not dry at all, though I should have flipped them sooner then I did. The grilled pineapple was okay, I did use canned as directed in recipe, but next time I will use fresh. I will also sprinkle it lightly with some brown sugar prior to grilling. Great recipe. I never have been able to grill pork chops without drying them out until now! Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe with the family and it is truly the best marindade recipe I've had for porkchops.  We all loved this; everyone said the porkchops were delicious.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  We can't wait to have this again.  It is so simple and so wonderful.

AWESOME!  I used 1" boneless chops and prepared the marinade as written, marinating overnight. I then put them on the grill, basting them with the marinade as they cooked.  I added the pineapple rings to the grill about five minutes before the chops were finished, turning them for grill marks and basting them with the marinade.  I served this with teriyaki pasta noodles and a light salad with crunchy chow mein noodles on top.  My son and husband LOVED this and asked me to add it to the meal rotation!  DEEEE-LISH!!

Wow, I was surprised at how much flavor was in the pork!  I ended up marinating my pork for a full day which may have enhanced the flavor but it was just so tender and juicy.  I grilled some small red potatoes as my side and would definitely recommend this recipe.  The only thing I might suggest is to cut the soy sauce back to 1/3 C.

Only had 2 hours to marinate, and very thin pork chops, marinade gave it a lot of flavor. My husband doesn’t prefer pork chops and ate it up completely. The grilled pineapple rings definitely complete the dish. When I made the marinade I realized I was out of soy sauce, so I substituted 3T Worcestershire + 1T water for the 1/4 C soy sauce (found this sub recommendation on google).

I was hoping to grill them, but the weather was against me that evening. I also has the chops in the marinade for about 40 hours.   I ended up cooking them in my 12" cast iron pan along with the pineapple rings. cooked them to 145° on medium heat so not to burn the sugar in the marinade. came out perfect!

Best pork chop I’ve made so far! Hubby loved it too. Don’t have a grill, so cooked 3/4” chops 7 min per side on range. Added 1/2 tsp ground ginger, a garlic clove, and a splash of spiced rum to the marinade.

I made this twice. The first time, as written but marinated for only 5-6 hours. It lacked flavor. Again, I only had 5-6 hours for a marinade so I replaced the garlic powder with 2 cloves minced, and about 1"x1 1/2" fresh ginger finely grated. This sped up the flavor process and made the pork crazy tender. It was a big hit with the husband and kids. I'll definitely make this again with the additions.

Made these tonight and my son said they were the best pork chops I had ever made.  Will definitely make these again!!  I only had a chance to marinade for 8 hours or so (threw it together in the morning) and they still came out great.  I only had pineapple chunks so added them to kabob skewers to cook.

5-8 minutes on medium heat was too long for the bone-in pork chops I used, so mine ended up really dry despite marinating for 24 hours. I would recommend 3-4 min per side unless your chop is thicker than normal.

I used this marinade on chunks of pork tenderloin I used for pork kabobs. Turned it great. Didn't have fresh pineapple so I substituted pineapple juice from a can instead.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've used, and it worked perfectly with thin-sliced chops! I didn't have enough pineapple juice, so I added some apple cider vinegar, to help tenderize the meat, make up for the missing juice, and continue the sweetness. And I only marinated them for 3 hours. But they came out tender, juicy, and sweet! Eating it with the grilled pineapple makes it even more juicy and tender. My husband and18-month-old son loved it! I served it with steamed cabbage and salmon croquettes. Yum!!

Agree with all the reviewers who said this was very tender.  I only marinated it for 4 hours so next time I will do the overnight thing and bet it will be even better!  Make sure you have a good pork chop to begin with and the rest is a breeze.

Fantastic!  I took the advise of one of the reviews above and added a 1 inch section of ginger, minced.  I also let them marinate for 48 hrs.  These are so simple and delicious its a no brainer!!

Very tasty. We will have this often. Thank you!  Second time.  Marinated for six hours and cooked on our stovetop grill pan. Carmelized perfectly and sauce was so reduced there was just enough to top the chops. Hubby raved!!!  Next time I'm thinking of doubling marinade and boiling down  for extra sauce for white rice.

Prepared this last night ( Feb 28th 2015 ) and it was delicious .. Followed the recipe to the letter, not adding or subtracting anything from what was written and it turned out great .. the only thing I did do was to marinate for about 4 hours instead of overnight. Served with quinoa and oven roasted brussel sprouts

This was fine.  My husband overcooked the chops because we had really thin pork chops.  Don't overcook them.

I used a bottle teriyaki sauce to marinade for 30 minutes, and broiled (on Lo setting) pork chops for 10 minutes on each side then 10 minutes with pineapple on top instead of grilling.

Quick, easy, and tasty (even my 3 year old loved it!).  Only had time to marinade for two hours but you could still taste the soy/pineapple flavor.  Served with quinoa and steamed green beans.  Will definitely make again.

I also wound up marinating these for 48 hours due to poor planning but wow! I'll be marinating them the same amount of time from here on out. These were delicious and everyone absolutely loved them. Excellent for summertime.

I first tried this because I was looking for something different to cook for the family. This was pretty darn good. The chops come out really tender and very flavorful. I have made this for get-togethers now and everyone always loves them. This is staying in the recipe box!

I made this for my two very picky teenagers.  They both loved it.  I was only aple to marinate it for 8 hours, and i cooked it on a stove top, but it was still delicious.  Kids liked taking a bite of pineapple with the pork chop.  Made it very tasty. No leftovers.

EXCELLENT!!  We loved the marinade flavor, as it was not too sweet like others we've tried.  I did keep the pineapple and grilled it, which add a wonderful accompaniment to the chops.  Will definitely be making this again!

Because im not a pork chop fan, but do try to cook them every so often for my husband i asked him to rate it, and he's giving it 4 stars, because he likes that porky flavour which these didnt have. 

For me on the other hand they were okay because of the lack of pork flavour.I didnt really change the recipe at all, but i didnt have canned pineapple only the real thing at home, so i used fresh cut pineapple rings, and also blended some of the pineapple down to add to the marinade. also didnt have garlic powder, just cloves of garlic, so i used 2 in the marinade as well.
I will most likely make this again if pork is on sale, and we havent had it for a while.

I do not really care for pork chops, so thought I would try it a different way.  This marinade brought taste to the meat and the BBQ was excellent.  I think that I now have a new take on pork chops.

Wonderful recipe!  When we tried to start the grill, it was out of gas so we used our Traeger smoker with hickory and oak chips.  Our pork chops were thick, so it took about an hour for them to be done. I added a thin slice of cheddar cheese (thanks to one of the comments) and put the fresh pineapple on top. The result was delicious!  This is an "invite the neighbors for a bbq" type of meal.  Wonderful!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was great!  I followed the recipe as is but neglected to brush additional marinate on the chops.  Next time I will make it with fresh pineapple and remember to brush the marinate on the chops while grilling.  I served it with brown rice and broccoli.  Very Good!

These were really good.  My husband liked them, too.  I just found the recipe this morning while looking for something diffferent to make for dinner, so I was only able to marinate them about 8 hours, but they were still good and tender.

I wasn't sure what I was going to do for dinner but I knew it would be pork chops.  I found this and tried it but didn't realize it needed to marinate overnight.  It still tasted good, though.  I didn't have any pineapple rings so I grilled pineapple chunks.  I also added crushed red pepper flakes and Chinese 5 spice to the mix.  I can't wait to try this again as a stir fry.  ^_^

Oh man was this good. I cooked it on the stovetop. It came out WONDERFUL. I just need to now figure out a good way to make/keep some sauce to serve on rice with it....

***We now have to eat differently for my husband's heart. I made this recipe with Salmon instead of Pork and it was FANTASTIC. It only had the slightest hint of salmon flavor and the meat was fantastic!! not super flakey and chewy like when I normally make Salmon. I Marinated it in a 9 by 13 baking dish and baked it in the juices with foil on top on 450 degrees until it was cooked through. (about 30 mins... it was a huge piece of salmon.) soo soo good. 

random side thought that has nothing to do with the recipe, if you're trying to change your diet, I'm finding the easiest way to eat good for your heart and still like how it tastes it to take your old favorite recipes and just replace the bad meats with good meats/beans. I'm finding steak recipes are fantastically replaced with black beans, pork for salmon, most ground beef you can replace with ground turkey or kidney beans pretty easy. it's making this whole lean eating thing so much easier! good luck!

Delightful indeed. I like the subtle sweetness of the marinade. Easy dish to put together and a good dinner for sure.

I too ended up marinating the chops for 48 hours (tyvm "Sunny" Florida... finally had enough time to grill them between showers!).  I also got that break in the weather about 4 hours before dinner time.  So, grilled the chops and pineapple when I could, and put them in the slowcooker on low until dinner time.  Very tender and flavorful!  Only thing I did different was use fresh pineapple... sliced it, and there wasn't much juice available for the marinade right away... sooo... I put 2 slices in the blender with the rest of the marinade ingredients.  Very good recipe!

My mom always made pork chops the same way. One day I exclaimed, "Let's try something new! What about pineapple?" and head to AllRecipes to find this. How DELICIOUS! The marinade was easy to prepare and grilling went splendidly. Highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make again!

I have made these before and my family gobbled them up! My problem is I forgot about the marinate time and am worried they wouldn't be as perfectly juicy as the first time I made if I try and only marinate for a couple of hours. I guess we will do Take out tonight but we are going to have a fantastic dinner tomorrow! Thanks for Sharing.

Made the recipe as stated and it was AMAZING!!  I have a charcoal grill and it is as super easy. My pork chops were thin and only took a couple of minutes per side. Next time I will purchase thicker cut chops. Will definitely make again!

I browned them in a pan and finished them in the oven.  For the marinade, I added only 1/2 of the soy sauce called for in the recipe. The whole family enjoyed them, even my pickiest eater who kept calling it "good beef".

Not quite to our taste.
We marinated for around 20 hours, following the recipe exactly outside of that exception. unfortunately the flavor that everyone talks about was missing for us. It was ok at best.

I actually used a fresh pineapple, so I may have been short on juice.   The chops were delicious and tender.  A little less sweetness probably would have been better .  Grilled pineapple is scrumptious.

I’ve made this a handful of times and they are always hit or miss... not sure if it’s the meat or the way it’s cooked or length of time left in marinade.  I’ve left it for 48 hours once and they were not good.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, except for the fact that I had to broil them instead of grill them.  The pork chops were tender and juicy, but you could hardly taste the marinade despite them marinating for over 24 hours.   The marinade needs a lot of work.  I don't think I'll make this again.

These are very moist and huge hit at our home (and my family is not a big chop loving group). I accidently discovered that if you let them marinade for 2 days they are even better! No changes made, as I do not like to change a recipe I have never tried until after I have had it the first time.

A good tasty marinade and a tasty dish all around. Pork chops need to be at leash 1/2” thick and not be over cooked. The pineapple is a great addition and the flavors all go together. This one is on my “make again” list.

Made it exactly as written, except I made the whole marinade recipe for 2 chops. I marinated the chops in half the marinade and reduced the other half to make a sauce to drizzle over the cooked chops. Yummy. Grilled pineapple has been a favorite since I was a child.

I found this recipe 3 hour before dinner so I only marinaded for 2.5 hrs. My family loved it, even my son who is a picky eater. Also, instead of throwing out the marinade, I made gravy with using 1 tbsp corn starch for my rue.

So glad I found this.  I don't like pork.  I'll eat it, grilled with TONS of bbq sauce.  I didn't need any additional sauce with this.  I boiled the marinade down and used that to brush on the country ribs, that I used in place of chops,  both front and back a couple of times during grilling.  This was freaking AMAZING.  I would do this again, with a pork tenderloin or actual pork chops.  Thank you for this recipe.

Easy and tasty! At our house we think pineapple pairs with pork as well as apple does. Plus pineapple juice has tenderizing properties that will turn any tough pork chop into a mouthwateringly-tender piece of meat. I only made one change to this recipe (and I typically change lots) and that was cutting the soy sauce in half  and adding 1/4 tsp of ground ginger in the marinade. We use organic soy sauce to avoid the gmo soybeans.

So I don't like any pork chops, I keep trying them and I just don't really care for them... until I tried this! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used chopped pineapple bc I already had it (so I did that part in the skillet--next time I'll for sure do grilled slices) I did save the marinade in a pot which I added flower to and made it into a gravy. It was okay,  next time I'll probably add more pineapple juice to the gravy mixture. Overall I'm very impressed. Thanks for something different, new and delicious!

The marinade was great.  The pork chops were very tasty.  Had the wild rice as a side and that was a solid choice.  Should have grilled the pineapple a little longer.  Definitely will have again.

This was great!  I made a few changes that suit our situation.  Change #1 I did not have pineapple rings but I had a lot of pineapple chunks.  Change #2 I need to control the amount of sodium I get daily so soy was out, but I make a soy substitution.  Change #4 We use a grill mat that keeps the grill clean.  Change #5 I cooked vegetables along with the leftover pineapple in a grill pan. Change # 6 I cooked the remaining marinade and pineapple juice, and added some corn  starch for a sauce. 
I think I got the essence of the recipe, but individualized it for our needs.

I've made this so many times.  An absolutely great marinade.  Instead of buying canned pineapple, I buy a fresh pineapple, cut of a piece about 1-1/2 inches thick, cut off skin, remove center, throw that and all other ingredients in a blender and voila, marinade.  If I think about it I add a small piece of ginger.  I make a bit more than the recipe calls for as it makes a fabulous sauce as well.  I just thicken it with a bit of corn starch.  I grill nice spears of fresh pineapple and baste with the sauce.  I have a friend who always asks if I'm making those pork chops.  I use nice fat bone-in chops and they grill beautifully.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

This was good!  I did as one reviewer suggested and marinated the pineapple in a separate bag.  This added extra zip to the fruit.  I used a sweeter BBQ sauce, next time I might try a smoky sauce to contradict the sweetness of the pineapple a little better.  Overall good recipe! Thanks for taking the time to share.

Made this for dinner tonight. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to use low sodium soy sauce as my father-in-law has dietary restrictions. I had some pineapple chunks in the cupboard so I took some of the marinade, sauteed the chunks, and added corn starch to thicken for a bit of "gravy". Will definitely make this again.

You can go wrong with pineapples; they go well with most savoury dishes put on the grill.  
Try it again and again !

The pork chop is really easy to make and to serve. The marinade is made from ingredients that  are found in every kitchen and although the actual cooking time is less than 20 minutes, the meat should marinate at least 4 hours; I marinated mine overnight so it could be served the filling day!  It was delicious and turned otherwise hum-drum pork chops into something special!

This was excellent !  I marinaded the Pork over night.  The subtle sweetness of the brown sugar/pineapple juice really works nicely.

I bought a N.Y. Strip cut Pork chop which was worth the extra $$ . I made NO changes and will definitely make it again.

The major plus of this meal is the minimum prep time.

This was so flavorful and delicious I must and will make it again. Taking the marinade and using it as a glaze to carmelize was great! I wouldn't change anything about this dish, maybe just double it for leftovers. Even my child loved this.

I use those packets of soy sauce I seem to get too much of from whenever I have ordered Chinese as they are more than enough to add for seasoning and they are pre-measured. I also up the garlic in the seasonings plus sprinkle a bit of turmeric and black pepper to the mix.

I didn't make this recipe but in reading the directions I see a potentially dangerous issue-marinating the chops overnight in the marinade and then using the CONTAMINATED marinade to baste the chops. If you are going to later use a marinade to baste foods the marinade needs to be separated-using part for marinating and then throw that marinade out. Use the other,  uncontaminated portion for basting

Delicious. Doubled recipe for 8 pork chops and added 2t of dried ginger. Chops were tender and juicy. Boiled marinade until reduced by half and basted the chops when I turned them.

I'm surprised how great this recipe turned out especially as I had never made pork chops before. 5 stars for ease of preparation and cooking, 5 for affordability of ingredients, and 4 stars for flavor but that's on my personal tastes. I terribly wish I had read the reviews before making because ginger is exactly what I felt this dish was missing! I had a ton of left over marinade and next time I will be simmering it or adding corn starch to make it into a gravy as others have done. The chops were juicy and appetizing but I love bold flavors and sauces and feel it could use a little more zing.

Excellent flavor and they could not be easier to make.  Used center-cut pork loin chops on the grill, turned out perfectly and very tender.  This recipe is proof that great flavor does not require a kitchen full of ingredients.

I thought the recipe would be fantastic and used wonderful boneless loin chops.

I did use low sodium soy sauce as I usually do.  I added ground sage and thyme, ample amounts.  And I have a sea salt/minced garlic grinder I use on everything as my husband likes a saltier flavor.

Marinated for approx 8 hrs.

Not sure where I went wrong but my husband nicely asked me to not make them again - no taste.

Since I did not taste them (I'm not a pork chop person), I am still giving it a 3 star.  I think if anything, lean to additional spices and perhaps a bit of Worcestershire.

I thought it was a GREAT recipe and looked delicious but he, as the critic, thought they tasted like "nothing".  The chops were grilled perfectly but taste was the issue.

We raved over this...and it was so easy!  We only marinated for an hour (we didn't decide to cook it until I got off work), but I bet it's better if marinated longer!

The only change I made is that I cooked them in a cast iron skillet with the raised lines.  I didn't cook them as long on each side because the skillet was so hot.  They turned out wonderful!  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty and easy to make. I only marinaded the chops for about 2 hours, then slow cooked them on the stove. They were excellent, can't wait to try them on the grill!

The longer you marinate the chops the better! One night we planed on making these and the next day decided were getting take out. The Pork Chops were in the fridge and the wife decided to freeze them and make them for another time. Well we defrosted them on the counter to make for dinner and wow what a difference when things marinate longer.

I've died and gone to pork heaven. So. Good. I added some ginger to the marinade. Simmered some extra marinade on the stove to reduce, and poured in into the holes in the middle of the pineapple rounds, and felt like an artist. Remember to save a little of the pineapple juice for your Mai Tai.

This was so easy and delicious. The kids loved it. It makes a lot of marinade so you could easily make 6 or 8 chops if you wanted. Will make again for sure.

Very tasty and moist! I was only able to marinade pork loin chops for a couple hours, but still very good. I reserved half the marinade and made a sauce to brush on the pork just after flipping, then put the pineapple on top, it was a hit!

Very easy to make. I always use fresh pineapple so I added a bit of simply orange with pineapple juice to compensate for the lack of pineapple juice from the can of pineapples. I used my indoor grill because it is freezing out. I can't wait to cook it on my charcoal grill.  My husband Loved this.

I did not read the whole recipe before I started this so I didn't have my chops in the sauce over night, more like an hourish. I also made a couple of small changes to the sauce and added a sprinkle of McCormick bacon molasses seasoning to the chops and they turned out AMAZING some of the best pork chops I've ever made/had. I'm so glad I found this recipe and I would definitely recomend it!

I've made these more than once and I'm never disappointed! I never seem to have pineapple juice, just a whole pineapple so I use the slices and juice I can get out of it. I've also used chicken for the same marinade and BOY were they wonderful. This is absolutely a go-to for my husband and I in the future.

I have no idea how much juice an 8 oz can is supposed to have since our cans are at least twice that size. I love meat with pineapple, so I used all the juice and followed the recipe as is for the rest. Personally, I still found the soy sauce overpowering. I'll try making this again but use just half the soy sauce.

I actually let mine marinate for about 24 hours and they came great. I did have to cook them longer but that could due to the thickness of the chops.

Made exactly like stated...grilled 9 minutes on each side...perfection.  Not a spec left.  I didn't have time to marinade for 24 hrs but I have a quick marinader so used that.  As good as they were with that, I can't imagine how great they would be after 24 hrs of marinating!

Made this, we don't have a grill but used my George foreman. Not the same flavor as a grill would have given obviously but still an excellent marinade. I'm tempted to try this again in my cast iron skillet...

This is an amazing recipe.  I however used a Teriyaki baste and glaze and added just a little lite soy sauce to it.  Added 1/4 tsp of ginger.  I also put lite Soy Sauce and just a little chili powder on the pineapple rings.   I marinated the porkchops and the pineapple rings for about 30 minutes.  When I put the pork on to grill I added the pineapple rings to the other marinade along with the chili powder and soy sauce, until they were ready to grill.  Cooked Asian veggies with them and it was so amazing.!

I loved the sweet in pork chops but if you don't like this combination, then don't try it. My husband doesn't like it but I enjoyed it very much.

I absolutely love this recipe and make it a few times a month. I marinate the pork all day or overnight whenever possible, and I don't like the idea of marinate cooking pork with juices that raw pork was sitting in, so I make extra marinade and keep it off to the side to baste the pork with as it cooks.

Best pork chops ever!!  The sauce is amazing.  Followed the directions as written except I marinated the chops an extra 24 hours due to poor planning.  Will make the marinade again for chicken and a pork tenderloin.  Thanks for sharing!

These pork chops turned out really tasty but I had thick cut pork chops and we all agreed that thinner cut would have been better.

I love grilled pineapple and thought this would be a good accompaniment but it was entirely too sweet for my taste. I tend to like my meat more on the salty and savory side.

I only marinated these about 8 hrs. I did use fresh pineapple and think I should have added more pineapple juice to the marinade. The pork chops were good especially along with a bite of pineapple but overall I didn't find the meat to be very juicy.

I only marinated the pork for about 10 minutes, but I  did use the flavor injector and shoot the chops full of marinade. The flavor was good, but a lot milder than I had anticipated. I  will make these again, but next time I  will plan ahead and marinate the full 24 hrs, and i will also reserve about 1/2 the marinade to reduce into a glaze, and see if we like them better that way.

I only marinated it for 5 hours. Very moist, but not as flavorful as I expected.  2nd chance, marinate overnight. I used a fresh pineapple and threw the rings in the bag by mistake. Update from 4 to 5 starts!  I used the juice from a 20 oz  can :), marinated 24 hours :), then forgot the pineapple rings in the fridge :(

This recipe was a hit with my son and boyfriend. My son absolutely detests pineapples, but he loved the flavor they added to the pork chops. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked these at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Perfection!

I didn't get to marinate my chops for long and I cooked them in a sauté pan instead of grilling them, but oh my gosh, they were still good! We put them on King's Hawaiian Buns with a little Duke's mayo and a slice of the pineapple. My tiny and finicky14 year old ate two huge sandwiches by herself. This is a keeper!

Delicious!  I did boil the left over marinade for 15 minutes.  Mixed 1tablespoon of cornstarch and 1tablespoon of water then added it ( as needed) to the boiled marinade to thicken.

This was a last minute recipe.  Since we don't have a grill i baked it in the oven.  Used a small can of crushed pineapple instead of the rings.  Baked the pineapple on the chops and turned the chops halfway thru.

Never made pork chops before. I try to stay away from breaded and fried which is the normal pork chop recipe. Our family gave us free pork chops so I had to find a good recipe. This recipe looked good and it turned out great. Easy prep. I added the frozen chops into the ziplock of mix and it thawed in the bag within 24 hours. Grilling took a bit longer than the recipe. I had never tried grilled pineapple both and it was delicious. I am glad we made enough for leftovers.

Excellent stuff.  Doesn't have to marinate overnight.  I do it for an hour or two sometimes and still comes out great.

I've made this recipe for the third time tonight, this time using bone in thin cut chops. Delicious. I really enjoy making chops this way, it helps keep them moist, and the flavor is quite nice! Fantastic summer meal!

I made this for my boyfriend and he could not stop raving about it.  He literally got down on his knees to tell me it was the best meal he ever ate. I told him next time he's on his knees he better have a ring in his hand. Lol. 
Sadly, that relationship ended but this recipe didn't. I altered a bit by using fresh pineapple. I cut it up and pureed some in the blender. Then I also used a few cloves of garlic that I put in the garlic press. Marinated it all together with big slices of pineapple. Only Marinated for a few hours then grilled the pork chops and the pineapple.  Delicious.  I served with corn on the cob that was roasted in the husk on the grill. Fabulous!

Easy and delicious. Better with some extra pineapple slices available and works quite well to cook the pineapple in the marinade. Used a little less soy sauce and more pineapple sauce than recipe stated based on personal preference.

These were delicious. I made them on the stove instead of the grill. Great recipes! I will make again. My fiancé, mother, and soon to be mother in law loved them. We had seasons asparagus and pasta salad as a side.

I did change a couple things... I used 1/2 teaspoon of a season salt I made (salt, pepper, garlic powder) since I couldn't find my garlic powder. Used 1/2 cup juice from draining crushed pineapple, the pulp was a nice touch, and only marinated for 20 min while rice was boiling. I sautéed sliced orange, yellow, and red bell pepper with a little brown sugar and oil in a pan and once done, set on separate plate and then seared the pork on both sides in pan till golden. I also mixed some crushed pineapple, brown sugar, soy and fresh grated black pepper for an extra topping. SO EASY AND AMAZING! Will never eat a different pork chop again!!!!

I was very disappointed!  The ingredients sounded good, but I didn't like the taste, perhaps too much soy sauce for me.  I would love to find a better recipe for a 
pineapple based pork recipe.

I used fresh pineapple, so I didn't have drained juice. Instead, I cut off a small section of pineapple and chopped finely for the marinade. I simmered the marinade while the chops cooked in order to kill any bacteria from the raw meat. The meat turned out very tender with a nice flavor, and we'd definitely make this recipe again.

Very delicious!  Made a separate marinade and used that for extra sauce to drizzle over the finished chops. Reduced and thickened the sauce on the stove with a little cornstarch.  Used fresh pineapple which was cut into rings and a separate can of pineapple juice was used for the marinade (1/4 cup for a single recipe).  Served with fried rice.  Works great with chicken breasts too.

I only had time to marinate these for 5 hours, but they still turned out great.  Very tasty and very simple.

I do the same thing with my chicken without the pineapple but I think
I may add the pineapple next time around. Makes a perfect Hawaiian dish. I also like to add a little juice from a squeezed lemon and lime (makes a great tenderizer). So yummy!

Added a little onion powder and paprika to the sauce. Also sprinkled the pork chops with pepper and ancho chile powder. Served with white and wild rice and grilled squash and zucchini...yum!

My wife never wants porkchops but we had everything to make this. She loved it. I used fresh pineapple so we used pineapple pop we had in the fridge for the kids. Instead of soy sauce I used tastefully simple bayou glaze. Even the kids loved it.

Very good. I baked mine instead of grilling because we don't have a grill. I followed another review's advise and baked on 425 for 15 minuets. The pork chops were big and had the bone in so they were slightly red by the bone. Probably another 5 minuets would've been perfect. I will make these again! Such an easy recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I missed that these needed to be marinated overnight and thought it only needed to marinate for 3 hours. Still came out wonderful. Definitely will make this again.

These were great.  I made them using precooked pork chops and cooked them for 4 minutes a side on the grill.  The pineapple was awesome, next time I'll cook two for each chop.

Oh this is yummy!  The marinade is fantastic!  I only marinated for about 5 hrs, not overnight, so to imagine the flavor if I would have gone the full amount of time!  Delicious, served with a rice pilaf.

Amazed at how simple this was and the flavor was divine.  Marinated over night and throughout the day; meat was melt-in-your-mouth.  Next time, will double the pineapple since we love it grilled.  This will become a regular on the menu.  Thanks!!

We really loved this recipe.  I only marinated 3 hours.  I added some grated ginger, kept the marinade and added some cornstarch/water to thicken it on the stove.  It made a wonderful thick marinade to brush on the chops while on the grill.  This is definitely an addition to our rotation.  Thank you!

Delicious! I too did not do this on a grill. Stove top: One side until browned, on high heat, other side until browned and then low heat (lowest one) to heat through. Perfect! moist and good!
I put some mango salsa on the side of this.

We have made this recipe twice now and have even made it for friends.  The pork chops come back so juicy, especially if they marinate over 24 hours.  We followed the recipe exactly.

Made this recipe tonight, without having marinated the pork chops very long at all. It was absolutely delicious and still had plenty of flavor. My husband and kids all devoured it! I didn't change anything. Very juicy. I used bone-in pork chops, not boneless. They were fairly thin, about 1/2" or a little more.

This was an amazing recipe!!
The only things I did different were, 
Choose the onions, add a tiny bit of ginger and I used two pineapple slices instead of one per chop.
Everyone enjoyed each bite of chop with a bite of pineapple.
I marinated it for about 6 hours.
The meat was very tender and moist (I also poked the chops prior to marinating.
This is something I will make again, 
I definitely am curious to see how it taste with a full 24 hour marinade.

I had a 20 oz can pineapple, but all other ingredients the same.  We liked.

Found this recipe in the winter and until a cool summer evening to fire up the grill for these. The grilled pineapple was the tastiest part.

This has to be the best pork chop recipe I have ever used! I refrigerated the chops for at least 24 hours and they were delicious! I used bone-in chops (about 1/2 inch thick) and cooked a few minutes longer on each side, just because bone-in takes a wee bit longer to cook. I didn't alter any ingredients but I also added some ginger, served with white rice and veggies. My husbands not normally a fan of such dishes but he loved it. Definitely going in my recipe box for future use.

I tried this recipe several times, add my regular herbs/seasoning, grill some onions, reserve extra marinade, and put over rice. I am definitely NOT the cook of the family. So when I made these pork chops at a cook out, everyone was shocked, they loved them, said it was the best pork chop they have ever had!

This is a great change of pace for pork chops. I used chopped garlic instead of powder, added 1 tbsp. kosher salt(for a true brining effect),1 tbsp. canola oil, and 1 tbsp. sesame seeds to marinade mix. Talk about moist, juicy flavorful chops. The grilled rings make the perfect visual and tasty finish to the dish. Thanks for a keeper!

This marinade was so quick to get together and the chops had a lot of flavor.   I added some sriracha to the marinade because I was afraid it would be too sweet for our taste.  They were very good and we liked the addition of the grilled pineapple.

Delicious! My husband doesn't often comment on my cooking but he gave a two thumbs up to this recipe and told me to make it again soon.
