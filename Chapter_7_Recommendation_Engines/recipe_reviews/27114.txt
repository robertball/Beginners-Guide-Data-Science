This has become one of my favorite shots...very yummy!  I used Frangelica and Absolut Citron...liked that combo best.

O.k. I have to admit I was skeptical about three ingredients making something tasty, but I have to admit this is one great party conversation starter.  I recommend using bakers super-fine sugar to dip the lemon slices in. This is awesome! Great for a grownup girls' get together.

I was very disappointed. The drink is sweet, cloyingly so. These did not taste like chocolate...to me--just sweet. I am glad I tried these before serving them to guests.

These are SO good. I've always ordered them at the bar but never knew how to make them. Now, I do.

Try it for yourself. You'll be taken aback. Be sure to buy GOOD liquor....otherwise you'll get inferior results!

These are large shots - but a treat just the same! I used a juicy lemon & the sugar started to dissolve & drip off the lemon too fast.

After a VERY rough week I made this. I just had to know if it tasted like chocolate cake. Even went to the liquor store to buy a tiny little bottle of frangelico. Dude. TOTALLY tastes like chocolate cake! I dont know why, I don't know how. It's like magic. Bite the lemon, lick the sugar, drink the shot. AMAZING.

If you want to try another version of this...this is my favorite shot drink and I've ordered it at many different places so I feel I'm up on all the versions. Try equal parts Frangelico and Vodka-forget the sugar and lemon!

I recommend taking the shot this way: 1. Coat the lemon wedge with white sugar, hold in hand 2. Drink the shot then immediately bite into the lemon -- the lemon will taste like a piece of chocolate cake!

This so good!   I made it with 3 Olives Citron Vodka and did a one to one ratio with the Frangelico and vodka.   You can also use limes for this shot too.

This is pretty good. Not as good as the bar's version, but that could just be my fault. I am eager to try it with citron vodka like other reviewers mentioned.

Hubby's working late so I'm at home alone, doing shots & cooking. Life is good! This did taste surprisingly like chocolate cake when you down it all together. I guess I've lost some of my coordination in my old age though (I kinda choked LOL) so I'll leave shots like this to the younger crowd.

I actually had this shot last summer and got the recipe from a neighbor.  This shot is awesome!  You wouldn't think the ingredients would taste like chocolate cake when all swallowed together, but it really does!!  Be sure NOT to swallow the lemon juice/sugar before you drink the shot, swallow everything together!! YUM!

Instructions say to combine 1 PART hazelnut liqueur to 1 PART vodka. In bar speak, that means equal parts. But the ingredients call for twice the amount of hazelnut liqueur. The instructions should read: combine 2 parts hazelnut liqueur to 1 part vodka.

This is an alright recipe for the shot, but I would make two modifications. 1. Use Stoli Vanilla. 2. Chill the shot.

as is, this drink is only so-so in my opinion. if you use equal parts (1 oz. each) of hazelnut liqueur (i strongly suggest using frangelico) & VANILLA flavored vodka you have yourself a wonderful shot that actually tastes just like chocolate cake. the lemon with sugar is a MUST with this shot, but i dont think it matters if you bite the lemon before or after the shot, ive done it both ways and the end result is always the same.

This is a great shot and is loved by all who taste it. We like it with citron vodka, but will try the vanilla vodka to see how that is. We always suck the lemon with sugar after the shot.

Good, and choclolate-y, but most of the taste comes from the frangelico. i would make this again though, if I already had all the ingredients.

This shot is awesome. I call it the birthday cake and give one complementary to guests who are celebrating their 21st. I like to use Stoli Vanil instead of Absolut for a little different flavor.
