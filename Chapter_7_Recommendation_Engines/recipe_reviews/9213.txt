This was a hit!  There was nary a piece left after the party.  I did take earlier reviewer's suggestion and doubled the nuts to 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  I can see where that made a difference.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks, Linda.

I absolutely loved this dip, both with celery and crackers.  The problem is that none of the pickier eaters in our group would even touch it.  The walnuts seemed to totally soften, so there was no 'crunch' - maybe pecans would work better.  Also, if you aren't crazy about the flavor of green olives, then go much lighter on them or sub. black olives, because it does get intense.  But wow - what a great dip!

This was a bit hit. We used fat free sour cream and the imitation cream cheese (starts with an "n") with 1/3 less fat, and we upped the amount of walnuts to 1/2 cup. Very tasty, and great on celery and crackers! Will make this again for parties.

This is better than the black-olive-only recipe I was familiar with as a child. The flavor bursts into your mouth. One suggestion - boost the walnut count a little.

My family wasn't crazy about this recipe and we all thought it lacked flavor.  It was easy and my daughters (12 & 9) had fun making it.  Next time, I will add more walnuts and maybe some garlic powder.

I had to give this high marks because I am not a stuffed celery lover but I had this limp celery that I wanted to use up and having a party to take something to... why not try it?  So I cut off the bottom of the wilted celery stalks and left them in water overnight. The result, fresh celery ideal for stuffing. I may have over-measured the olives and walnuts but the recipe came out great.  I liked it a lot.

A smart snack - a much healthier alternative than other, less smart, snacks I tend to grab.  Very tasty, non-boring way to get a fat fix without feeling deprived, because you've cut out the bad-for-you (but addictingly delicious) carbs.  I gave it a shot of hot sauce and, since I had them available, threw in some ripe black olives along with the green. Lots of flavor and lots of texture is what makes this so good.(I think adding some chopped, dried beef would really take this over the top!)

Great little spread.  Replaced Ranch bottle dressing for the sour cream and pecans for the walnuts.  Made it early in the day to allow flavors to blend.  Great on veg, crackers or as a sandwich spread!

Pretty good. The flavors all went together well and made a nice appetizer. This was great with Ritz crackers on the side too.I used pimento stuffed olives. I'd eat this again.

I've been making this for years. Sometime when I'm feeling crazy I'll leave out the walnuts and add red pepper flakes to give it a kick.This is also very good on bagels.

I would love to tell you this was delicious!  But I never got a chance to taste it.  E dry time I was near enough to try it, someone else was lathering up a celery and pulsing this dip on.  I will hav etc assume it tasted good because there was none left by the time the meal started.

I made it exactly how the recipe stated. I felt it lacked any real flavor. Was disappointed.
