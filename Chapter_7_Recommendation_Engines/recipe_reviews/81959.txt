This dish is a keeper and a definite comfort food. Don't let the fat content scare you off - it can easily be altered. I made it with reduced fat Ritz crackers, 98% fat free soup, light sour cream and half the butter and it still came out great! (but not low-fat)
I noticed that some reviewers thought this was somewhat lacking in flavor, so I sprinkled the chicken with basil, oregano and garlic powder and browned it before adding water and simmering it for about 15 minutes. I prepared the chicken the night before while making dinner so I could have cooked, chopped chicken all ready to go. 
As suggested by another reviewer, I stirred the chicken, soup and sour cream together in a bowl before putting it in the casserole dish.
Serve with bread and  some steamed veggies.

it won't be dry if you add 1 stick melted butter and 1/2 cup milk to the soup/sour cream mixture; it'll have more flavor is you use either a whole chicken or 3 or 4 chicken breasts with the bone and skin and put a bay leaf or two in while you're boiling your chicken; also add poppyseeds to the soup and sour cream mixture instead of to the crust.

This is an excellent dish and so easy to make. In my opinion, one teaspoon of poppy seeds hardly qualifies that ingredient to make it in the dish's title... so I used about 4 tablespoons! Simply wonderful.

I read several reviews before preparing this and took them all into consideration and this was the BEST Poppy Seed Chicken ever!  I browned the chicken before simmering it in chicken broth for 15 minutes which gave it tons of flavor.  I also sauteed onion and celery as a previous reviewer suggested and added it to the cream of chicken and sour cream mixture.  I added 2 tablespoons poppy seeds and combined the mixture and the chopped chicken.  The rest was as the recipe stated.  I poured it all in an 8x8 Pyrex, put the crumbs on top, sprinkled a bit more poppy seeds on the crumbs, and lastly drizzled melted butter over the top.  It was soooo rich, I don't see how anyone can claim there's no flavor! :)

I love this dish. I use 2 cups of sour cream (16 oz carton) instead of one for more sauce. I saute some chopped celery and onions in a little butter first, then mix everything together, pour it in a pan, and top with the cracker mixture. I like this with broccoli, wild rice, and dinner rolls. Reheats nice too.

I'd give it a 5, but I save that for the "OMG, is this fantastic or what?" recipes. It's really good. I have a 5 year old son that's practically a vegetarian, and HE ATE IT! I have a 4 year old that's a carnivore, of course she ate it. A 14 year old that can be picky @ times, and HE loved it. But here's the make or break it reviewer. The hubby, who basically likes hunks of beef and not much more. We tried this recipe when daddy was out of town on business, it made plenty, so we had it the next day. (Daddy was home by then). I can't believe Dad ate leftovers, casserole style chicken, and liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this- used Pacific foods condensed soup (all natural and much better than the alternative), light sour cream, and I cut the butter amount in half.  Still delish and very rich and SO GOOD!!  Served with steamed brown rice.

A mom from the PTA made this for us during parent-teacher conferences one year, and I loved it!  I just came across the recipe yesterday, so I made it last night.  I used fat-free condensed soup, low-fat sour cream and saltines instead of the Ritz crackers.  My changes affected the flavor quite a bit, but it was still good.  I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  My husband just mixed everything together in a bowl and ate it.

Love this! Long time family favorite. Instead of combining crackers, butter and poppy seeds in a seperate bowl, I've always crumbled the crackers in the sleeve and distributed them evenly over the whole dish, then put the poppy seeds on, and poured on the melted butter last. I prefer this method because I can assure it all is distributed evenly. I also sprinkle a few poppy seeds, along w/ salt and pepper, over the chicken before adding crackers. I uncover this the last five minutes of cooking to crisp up the cracker topping.

This was really good. I liked it the way it was and will definitely make again. Hubby liked it too but when I asked what would make him like it more he requested no ritz topping or poppy seeds and that I use cream of chicken with broccoli soup. Oh...and we had it over mashed potatoes - so yummy!

I make this recipe at home all the time and everyone loves it!  I serve it over rice.  Very comforting!  I also made this recipe for a ladies meeting at church.  Scaled it for 200 and it still came out perfect!  I got rave reviews from everyone.  You cannot mess this up!

Delicious! One of our favorites. I usually mix up the chicken, sour cream, and cream of chicken soup the day before I bake to let the flavors mix. It's also excellent as left overs.

This is the standard recipe my family has used for this meal for years and years and it always goes over well. I usually use it as my go-to picnic recipe and I've handed out this recipe more times than I can count! The only difference between this and mine is that I use about 1 tbsp of poppy seeds.

I use a can of cream of chicken AND a can of cream of mushroom.  You need to season the chicken with garlic powder, basil, and oregano for it to have more flavor.  I also add a little salt and pepper to the mixture before adding the topping.  This is my kids favorite dish!!

Made this tonight for a bunch of men and they loved it. I cut up and cooked some chicken with onions and garlic, mixed it with the rest of the ingredients and threw in some peas.  I noticed that it wasn't enough chicken, so I threw it in the fridge, and on the way back home later in the evening I picked up a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and pulled meat from it until the whole mixture filled a 9x13 pan.  I used poppy seeds in both the chicken mixture and the topping.  Served with roasted red potatoes and crescent rolls.  Will make again!!

I have had this recipe in my family for years.... but we make it a bit differently. We use 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and 1 cup sour cream. Alot of people I know use cream of chicken soup, but it is much creamier and has better flavor with cream of mushroom.

Great comfort food. I serve over noodles. I generally don't have leftover chicken so I just brown up some of those flash frozen tenderloins. I season them with a bit of garlic salt, poultry seasoning and pepper and cut them into bitesized pieces when they're done cooking.

I made this as written the first time and loved it but I actually have been making this in my slow cooker ever since. I put all of the wet ingredients, and some poppy seeds over raw chicken, and cook while I'm at work all day. Then when I get home I put the cracker crumbs and more poppy seeds on top with a little bit of mozzarella cheese. Move the crock pot to the oven and bake until the top is bubbly. Yummy with pasta.  We've made it apart of the rotation at our house.

Very good comfort food  and easy to make.  I stirred in 1 Tablespoon fresh lemon juice to the soup & sour cream mixture and I added a good tablespoon of poppy seeds in with it.  Used one sleeve of whole wheat ritz crackers...just crushed in the sleeve like another reviewer suggested. I put 1 tsp of poppy seeds in cracker mixture.   Bake uncovered and you will have a delicious crunchy toppiing.  I had some leftover cooked baby pasta shells in the fridge so I put about 2 cups on the bottom of pan.  The next time I will try over boiled potatoes.  This is a keeper.

In general we are not big fans of casseroles in our household, but given the high ratings I tried this dish and it wasn't too bad. I made 2 small portions, one just as the recipe says and another with a bit more flavors. In the 2nd one I used sauted chicken that I seasoned with italian seasonings, garlic powder, season salt, and black pepper.  This was was way better. I would consider making again.

YUM! I usually don't rate recipes unless I followed them exactly, but I thought this was worth mentioning. As others suggested, I added a few things for extra flavor and it turned out really good. I browned sliced chicken breasts in a little olive oil, and sauteed until cooked through. Put in baking dish, and sprinkled with a little celery salt, onion powder and parsley. I added 1/2 tsp. black pepper plus about 1/4 cup white wine to the sauce mixture, as well as increased the poppy seeds to about 2 heaping tsp. Also as another suggested, I used all low fat/light options and used only 1/4 cup butter. Served over egg noodles with steamed asparagus on the side. Will for sure be making again! Very very creamy, comforting, and yummy.

This recipe is ok.. but better when use 1 can cream of celery soup and one can mushroom soup and add poppy seed to the mixture of chunked chicken and sour cream and soup.  Then place the crushed, buttered Hi-HO crumbs on top.. Dlicious... but very high in calories...

This is the recipe that I always make when I need a meal to take to a family.  I get lots of compliments on it and it is so easy to make in a pinch.  I keep ingredients in my kitchen at all times.  We love green beans and crossiant with it!
If you over cook the chicken it makes the dish dry...I precook my chicken until just barely done...it is gonna get 30 more minutes in the oven anyway.  Turns out perfect everytime.

I actually found this recipe "accidentally" while searching for another one.  I happened to have all of the ingredients and this one seemed easy and quick to prepare.  It was just that, and my kids loved this one.  It is a new family favorite that will be used many times again.  We served this over some penne pasta, but I will be trying brown rice next time.  The topping is so delicious, and I only used 3 tablespoons of melted butter.  It was a little crumbly when spooning it out of the dish, but every crumb was eaten.

This was pretty good. I made the recipe as is and everyone cleared their plates but it was a little bland and dry. I will definately make it again since it isn't often that I find something that all of us will eat without any complaints but I will probably make a couple of changes next time to add a little more flavor and liquid.

I have eaten this several times but never made it myself.  I love this recipe- it's comfort food to the max.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli for ease in preparation and only added extra poppy seeds, salt, pepper, a dash of garlic powder and poultry seasoning for some extra flavor.  Very easy and so satisfying.

This is a super easy recipe for chicken that I have been eating for a few years. It is easy and is a somewhat different take on your ordinary chicken because of the poppy seeds.  Don't skimp on them! I serve it over egg noodles and its delicious, even leftover (if we ever have any).

I received this recipe from my mother-in-law. I love this recipe...but hers has a few differences:  2 cans Cream of Chicken Soup; 1 TBSP Poppy Seeds; 8 oz Sour Cream; & 2 sleeves of Ritz crackers w/ a little melted butter! I serve w/ mac & cheese & butter or lima beans and cornbread muffins!  YUM!!

yummy.  But, I added an additional can of cream o' mushroom soup, saute'd the chicken in 2 tsp minced garlic and 1/4 cup chopped white onion.  I also added a dash of ground superfine mustard seed, and poured about 1/2 cup of de-fatted chicken broth over the entire mixture before adding the crushed crackers and melted butter.

I was hesitant to try this with the fat content. I took others advice and used fat free soup, only 1/2 the butter and low fat sour cream. I gave it 5 stars because if you had made it as it is stated I'm sure it would be. It was 4 the way I made it. Thanks

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes, because it is so easy and delicious.  I like to add cooked pasta to it before baking it, it makes the casserole go alot further...especially if you have a crowd to feed.

All time favorite dish. My twists: Add A LOT OF POPPY SEEDS. 1/2-3/4 cup to the soup/sour cream mix. To ADD VEGGIES: try sautéing brussel sprouts, still keeping them firm. Add them in with the chicken before baking. The sauté idea is to ensure the brussel sprouts soften when baking. I learned the hard way- time for the chicken isn't enough for the sprouts. They came out still a little too raw.

A great way to use up leftover cooked chicken or Thanksgiving turkey! I don't layer...I just mix the chicken with the soup and sour cream.

I remember my mom making this for me 30 years ago....  And this tastes just the same!  Very nice!

As always, though of you who know me.... I like to add some heat.  So...  I put about a teaspoon of Spanish paprika, about 10 clicks of fresh ground black pepper and garlic powder.  In addition - 2 dashes of oregano and 2 dashes of basil.

I used 2 large chicken breasts, cut them into uncooked chunks and mixed them with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  Of course at least 1 cup of sour cream...  

Finally, instead of regular saltines, try Keebler Club Crackers!!!!!!!!  Then, the 1/2 cup butter works just fine.  I cook for 30 minutes, check it and usually let it ride another 10 to 15 minutes.  DO NOT OVERCOOK or the crackers taste terrible....

All-in-all, this goes great with garlic mashed potatoes, rice (white or otherwise) or pasta.  A truly versatile dish!

Cheers!

This dish is one of my family's favorites. I use 1/2 stick melted butter in the bottom of casserole dish, then the diced chicken which I salt and pepper, then sour cream/soup mixture, crackers, poppy seeds, and 1/2 stick melted butter over crackers. We like it over rice or wide egg noodles. You can't beat this dish!

I have used this recipe several times. I teach and its a perfect dish to scoop out a serving and haul it to school with me. Reheating it is no problem, it comes out of the microwave yummy. I use way more than a teaspoon of poppy seeds and probably more butter too. It is a rather bland dish if you prefer spices and stronger flavors. I sometimes add salt and pepper to mine. An Italian herb mix (found at most grocery stores) would be a nice addition.  Also, a friend of mine makes this for her 3 young sons and it's ALWAYS a hit.

I was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't very creamy and scored a little low on the flavor scale at our house.  I'm sure with modifications it would be OK.

I follow the recipe as written except: I use cream of chicken with herbs soup this helps with the "flavorlessness" complaint ( or add your own herbs to soup) I also season the chicken. My result is chicken in a creamy sauce with a buttery crumb topping. I've made it several times with no complaints.

I actually discovered this recipe from my brother and grandmother while we were visiting them a couple of weeks ago.  My brother raved about it and after returning home, I looked it up here.  I've made it twice already, it's such a big hit with EVERYONE in my family, including the little ones!  It's definitely a keeper. :-)

So quick and easy to make and so yummy!  I try to make it soupy enough to put a layer of rice on the bottom of the casserole first.  YUM!!!  Awesome comfort food!

This is simple and really awesome comfort food!  Like others, I put the poppy seeds in my sour cream mixture as well as the topping.  Just a tip on the crackers - I use one stack, and crush them in the package by pressing down from the top with the palm of my hand.  This works perfectly every time!  Also, 1/4 cup of butter is plenty!

I love this recipe it's a simple, delicious and comforting food. I like to add a little more poppy seeds then this recipe calls for though just for texture and coloring.

This has quickly become a family favorite! The only thing I do different is mix the chicken into the soup mixture before pouring into the pan and cut back on the butter. Everyone who has tried this has absolutly loved it!

Awesome, delicious, wonderful all the way!!  So easy to prepare even a novice like me can do it with divine results.  I've made it twice since I found this recipe one week ago. Once for my husband, son and myself and then for my parents.  Everyone was impressed.  I think this has actually replaced mac and cheese as my all-time favorite comfort food.  Follow recipe exactly...it is perfect as is!!!

This is the first recipe I have made off this website and my alltime favorite to date.  It has an addictive rich flavor.  Ritz roasted vegetable crackers make a perfect topping.

I love comfort food, but I almost didn't make this recipe when I saw the fat/calorie content!  Then after reading a review from LORI3405 (about 10 reviews down from this one) I decided to give it a try.  LORI used low fat soup and fat free sour cream and reported good results.  I followed her example, plus I used reduced fat butter crackers and only half the amount of butter the recipe calls for.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  I don't usually alter a recipe the first time I make it, but I wouldn't have been able to enjoy this one knowing I was eating 50 grams of fat in one meal.  The reduced fat version came out really good and I'll definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe, and thanks to LORI3405 for trying the lighter version and telling us about it.

This is a keeper.  If I am making the chicken for this recipe, I usually season it with a chicken seasoning, but it's not necessary.  I don't use the poppy seeds b/c my husband is allergic, but it is still really yummy and easy!!  Good leftovers too.

I love this recipe.  This is one dish that I remember from TN.  After having my daughter I had dinners delivered for a week and a friend brought this dish over.  I loved it so much.  It's a fabulous base recipe that you can jazz up in SO many ways.  I like to add garlic, fresh pepper, cheese, white wine, and onions for instance in my dish.

I was surprised how good this turned out.  I used 98% fat free cr of chicken soup and fat free sour cream.  I only had honey wheat crackers to use and no poppy seeds.  I made half a recipe for 3 of us.  All I have to say is "Yum yum" and even my picky 2 year old ate it.

The dish was good. I didn’t use enough shredded cheese to top & so the sour cream sort of over powered the dish. Which for me was ok, but for my family not so much. I have extra & going to more cheese, more crackers & see if I can turn it around.

This recipe has been around for years.  It was in my children's elementary school fundraiser cookbook.  I have always used low fat/low sodium cream of chicken and low fat sour cream, but do use the butter.  Adding garlic powder boosts the flavor.

Made exactly per the recipe. I mixed the soup & sour cream together but instead of poring over the chicken, I stirred it into the chicken before putting it into the casserole dish. Was great. Just 2 of us & the hubby really enjoyed it. Had leftovers the next night & he finished off. Definitely a keeper and so quick and easy to make after work.

This is very very rich! Cooked the chicken ahead of time, so it was fast. Can be made in stages. Simmered the chicken in chicken broth with some sautéed onion and let it sit overnight in the broth. Completed and cooked the next day. I definitely used more poppy seeds than in the recipe. Served with wild rice and steamed broccoli.

Pretty straightforward dish. Added a few extra seasonings and spices of our own to enhance the flavor and added extra poppy seeds. Makes a good dish to include at a potluck.In the future I'd like to make my own cream sauce rather than using canned cream soup. Would make it again.

My family has been making this for years . But I come from a large family so we added a few things extra , 
2 cans of cream of chicken
1 can of cream of mushroom
1can cream of celery  
16 oz sour cream and we mix the poppy seeds right in the mix 
Also we use a Cheeze it base of crackers and topper as well . 
The crackers changes with my mood and sale price but changing the crackers can either boost the taste or change it completely . We love it family fav .

This was my favorite dish as a child.  I ran across this recipe one evening and decided to try it.  Although it was delicious, I found it slightly dry and lacking depth of flavor.  The second time I made it I used a whole stick of butter for the topping, and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup (in addition to the cream of chicken) and a hefty dose of fresh ground pepper.  I also found that it is best to use a whole bone-in chicken.   The addition of these extra ingredients and the mix of white and dark meat really benefit both the flavor and texture.  My family liked it even better!!

This recipe is fantastic, this one is on the menu in my house quite often. 

I add a little less chicken than what's called for, probably about 4-4.5 cups instead of 5. This makes it less dry and comes out amazing. I also just eyeball the topping because I like a lot of it. Finally, I add a little bit more poppy seeds than what the recipe calls for. 

I'm not a fan of left overs typically but I enjoy this for a day or so after it's made!

I personally love this meal because its fast and easy. My friend made this one night when I was over for dinner. My recipe is a little different, but that's probably why I've never had a "dry" or " bland" issue. I also add a can on cream of mushroom soup, I stir the poppy seeds on with the soup and sour cream, then add 1/2 cup of milk, and the best part is a squeeze about a half of a lemons juice into the mix. I don't put any butter in mine. I prefer to shred my chicken like pulled pork.

Awesome recipe!!!! I am know at work for this meal now. It's a really flexible recipe too, for example, you don't have to have 5 cups of chicken or increase the amount of sour cream and soup. It will still be delicious! and I actually prefer using more cream and soup.

I make this exactly as directed. I think it's "ok", but my husband and all of my children LOVE it and rave about it. It is a staple in our house because they request it often and there are usually no leftovers of this one!

Super good! Basic for one of our favorite recipes. I always add some spices (garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, paprika, and onion powder) to taste to our liking. We also stir in a bit of milk or cream. Poppy seeds weren't usually a staple in this house, until we made this dish. Now, they're always in the spice cupboard.

Good comfort food. I sauteed onions & garlic and used cream of mushroom soup along with a TBS of poppy seeds. Served it with mashed potatoes and peas.

This made the best chicken sandwich ever. I shredded the chicken and mixed everything together, put crackers, poppy seeds, and butter mix on top. Then we ended up mixing it all up and putting it o buns. So good! I think I will add broccoli next time if I want to keep it in casserole form. But hubby loved it as shredded chicken sandwich.

Delicious! I did think it tasted a little too much like sour cream until I mixed the buttery crackers in (I had no poppy seeds on hand, unfortunately). Perhaps I will add a little bit of butter to the sour cream/soup mix or just use a little less sour cream next time. There will definitely be a next time! It was so rich I couldn't even finish one serving. Bravo!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is delicious, AND my family likes it as well, so that is always a plus when trying to find new ideas for dinner.  I also gave it 5 stars for its simplicity.  I purchased a rotisserie chicken which already has a lot of flavor built in.  I also mixed the chicken and sauce ingredients, including the poppy seeds, in one bowl (there's really no need to layer the sauce on top of the chicken).  I did increase the quantity of poppy seeds to 2 tablespoons.  For measuring purposes, one sleeve of crackers (ritz or townhouse) equals a 1/2 cup.

This was a hit with my partner and me. After reading other reviews I decided to add 1/2 cup of milk, a whole 8oz container of sour cream, and 2 tbls of poppy seeds into the soup mixture. The whole dish turned out very moist and creamy, and the extra poppy seeds really made it perfect.

This was very tasty!  I did a couple things different.  I took a short cut from the store and bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded the whole thing. I took advise from other reviewers and added sauted onions and I also added a can of chopped green chiles. Minus the buttery crumb topping, I mixed everything together before putting it in the dish.  I concur with another reviewer, 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds is not enough...I added about a tablespoon of poppy seeds to the mixture itself and about 2 tablespoons to the topping. Serve with brown rice and a veggie and viola, a great and simple meal.

Pretty good.  My husband liked it.  I thought it was a little rich and overwhelmingly greasy.  Oh well.  It's okay to enjoy something "southern" every once-in-a-while. :)  I served it over rice because I'm not sure it should be eaten alone.  Way too rich but very good with rice.

This is a very good, simple recipe. To give it a bit more flavor I added just a dash of sherry to the sour cream mixture. Also, for variation you can crush croutons in place of the butter crackers.

This was drier than I was expecting for a dish that is to be served over rice or potatoes, I even added 1/2 cup milk to the soup and sour cream mixture. The flavor was ok. If I made it again I would halve or omit the cracker crumbs.

Great recipe!  My favorite topping is shake and bake.  After the can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup butter, and 8oz sour cream over the chicken... I top the dish with poppy seeds and then shake and bake crumbs on top. Big hit with the family!

This is a great recipe that I altered just a hint for an extra boost of flavor.  Instead of sour cream, I use Rand dressing for a kick of flavor.

Ultimate in comfort food at my house.  I always add a bag of frozen vegs to the mix (cooked first) just to give the illusion of more health.  Also serve it over brown rice... my pickiest kid will eat this!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and our family loves it!  One variation to the recipe we make is we add soy sauce and some seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder) to the mixture.  This definitely gives it a unique taste that sets it apart from your ordinary chicken dish.

I cooked extra chicken earlier in the week, knowing I was going to try this recipe.  After a most trying day at work, I pulled out all the ingredients, and Wham, bam, thank-you  ma'am, it was assembled and in the oven. (I used reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat crackers, 3 TBSP. butter, and at least 3 TBSP poppy seeds.)  It smelled insanely good cooking.  Husband, teenage daughter and I loved its creamy goodness.  Cooked rice on the side and  a green salad.  It IS super high in fat, just like me, but what the heck....all things in moderation. I will definitely make this again, just for the sheer ease of it....but not too often, because it might make my already clogged arteries completely blocked.

I was looking for a way to use up a bunch of fried chicken that I had left over from a reunion, and tried this recipe.  It was fantastic!  Loved the texture and the flavor.  I've made it again with other kinds of chicken and it wasn't quite as good, but still wonderful.  Thanks.

This turned out really moist and good.  I did add some extra seasonings to it. I also cut back a little on the sour cream, though I like to make the recipes on here as is, I knew my family would find the sour cream a little to much.  I like to use it to enhance the flavor of the foods.  Thanks for the post.

My family has been making this for years!  We use twice the poppy seeds though and mix half in with the soup/sour cream mix, and it is also great with a vegetable added into the mix.  Our favorites vegetables to add are peas or corn.

We've been "iced in" for four days, so I've been cooking with what we have on hand. This is fabulous!! A southern favorite my husband says. I'd never had it before.  We put in a full tablespoon of poppy seeds b/c one teaspoon didn't look like enough. Very good!!

I kind of cringed at the calories and fat content but thought you know what a splurge once in awhile is no big deal. I made this dish and my husband and 16 monht old could not get enough of it. It is definately a keeper.

Scrumptious and easy to make!  We really liked it a lot.  Both kids, 3 and under, gobbled it up.  DH said it was good and we could have it again.  While boiling the chicken, I added some dried minced onion.  Once I put the cut up chicken in the dish (I used 3 large breasts), I sprinkled lemon pepper over it.  I also added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of poppyseeds.  Really good.  Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  Yum.

My 12 year old daughter made this for our dinner; it was super easy to make and tasted pretty good.  Nothing amazing in the flavor department, but a quick, good meal in a short time for a weeknight.  We served it with rice and green beans.

This is a family favorite!  My son calls it his "favorite chicken".  I use 3 large chicken breasts and I also used 8 oz. of cream cheese rather than the sour cream (just a personal preference).  I assume the "teaspoon" of poppyseeds called for is supposed to be a Tablespoon... that's what I use and it is just perfect!

I use a similar recipe and it is one of my families favorite recipes.  It is great.  I use 3 chicken breasts. I have never measured to see what it equals. I never measure the poppy seed either I just pour some in.  I have never had it where it did not turn out, even after not measuring. I recommend it to all of my friends and family... It is GREAT!

This has become a family favorite in our house.  It's creamy, crunchy and delicious.  My boys love it!  We never have any leftovers.
