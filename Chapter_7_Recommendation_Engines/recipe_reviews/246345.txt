Tasty dish... my only substitute was fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I needed lots of S&P and more Sriracha for my taste. Having leftovers today for lunch. I would recommend using the entire package of tofu... wasnt very much. I cooked the tofu first separately to get some color to it and to avoid having it fall apart

Not protein-packed if you only use 1/2 package of tofu for 6 servings! Brown the cubed tofu in sesame oil to add flavor before starting veggies. Add or substitute multi-color bell peppers for celery. Put the whole onion, diced. And please try bright fresh greens instead of frozen; a whole bunch will cook down quickly to 8 oz. Be sure to offer sriracha and soy sauce on the table for guests who can handle extra sodium.

Pretty good and surprisingly hearty! A bit on the bland size, be prepared to improvise with the selection of spices.

I didn't find this to have much flavor. I had to add a lot more Sriracha. It could use a lot more spices, perhaps in the curry family.
