Made exactly as written.  Really yummy.  I think next time I will saut√© the onions a bit before adding them to the sauce.

I used my own garlicky panko style bread crumb topping.  Other than the topping I followed the recipe and thought it was very good.  Would rate 4.5 stars if that was an option.  I give few 5 starts.
