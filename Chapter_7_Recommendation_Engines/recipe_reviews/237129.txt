This was a unique recipe for sure! I loved the shredded chicken idea. The flavour was a little bland, so I tripled the garlic and added salt. It was quite yummy and everyone liked it.  I would have given 3.5 stars if it let me. Oh, even though prep is said to 15 mins it was much longer than that when you consider boiling/mashing the potatoes and shredding the cooked chicken.

It didn’t turn out well. The flavors didn’t seem go together, and it took more steps than it should have. I would have nixed the green chilies and mixed the chicken soup and milk but n the skillet with the rest of the ingredients at the end of cooking time. I rate it a 2 because the kids ate it.

This recipe was warm and cozy. Def made it in November. :) I added corn with the green beans. I used all dry spices. When I picked up Parmesan cheese at the store I noticed a new salad blend that had Asiago. Spoiler alert!! That was excellent. Planning on using the leftovers for work this week.

A very good way to use left over mashed potatoes and other vegetables! I put a bay leaf in with the chicken breasts while I boiled them for some additional flavor I also used twice the recommended cloves of garlic.  Since the potatoes were cold in the refrigerator, I heated the potatoes up with a little milk to ensure that they would be hot throughout instead of burnt on the outside and cold inside.  I left out the beans, and put in some left over corn. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 baking pan for about 30 minutes. Will probably use this recipe in the fall with left over turkey as well.
