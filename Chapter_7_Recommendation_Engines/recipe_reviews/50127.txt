WOW! This is so yummy! It IS like drinking a hershey's cup. I made it with regular vanilla and store brand chocolate and it was still fab! My kids love it and so did I. This is a super easy special treat for them!

This was good, but I think it called for too much milk, making it very thin.  Also, how much is a "large scoop"?  I put in what I thought was enough, and with the milk, it was still thin.  However, it tasted great.  I used Tillamook vanilla bean ice cream, Adams's natural pb, and Trader Joe's chocolate syrup.
