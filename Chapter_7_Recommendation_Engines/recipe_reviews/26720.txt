I really liked this recipe because of the garlic!
My only change was I omitted the celery and bell pepper, used some celery seed and it was delicious
and smooth. Perfect on crackers. I will definitely
make this again!

It came out great with a few modifications.  i doubled all the spices, i did not add the paprika, dill or the parsley instead i added more cilantro, added red bell peppers and carrots. i also substituted the mayo with sour cream. instead of dry mustard i added regular mustard. i also boiled three eggs and added those of course without the yolks. oops i almost forgot i added some olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the veggies before adding the tofu. i also used extra firm tofu instead.

I've made this a few times, and now have it perfected.  Use firm tofu rather than silken, you'll get a firmer, more speadable texture.  Use the food processor, again, texture.  Use two cloves of real garlic, not that revolting powder.

I thought this was to bland. I did not add all the garlic, may be that was the reason. I did try to zip it up with chopped green onion and horseradish but it didn't work. It went better with baked chip than raw veggies. My husband and I ate it but everyone else didn't like it very much. I guess we're a bit more adventurous.

My husband and I loved this.  It's a fast, easy recipe and great served with crackers.  I might use a little less green pepper next time, but that is what is fun about this recipe, it's very flexible.

not bad, a bit bland - i added some blue cheese salad dressing (i was hosting a party for goodness sakes - it had to be salvaged) and it turned out quite a bit better.

I took KVCHAN's advise however I am trying to eat dairy free so I did a couple twists to it.  I doubled all the spices, I  did not add the paprika, dill or the parsley instead I added more cilantro, and I used all green peppers (I am a college student and the other colored pepper are too expensive).  I did not add carrots although I may next time. I substituted the mayo with a dairy free soy bean based sour cream. Instead of dry mustard I used added regular mustard. I did not use any eggs.I did add a tablespoon of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the mix.  I used soft tofu.  It turned out GREAT!!! Happy eating!!

added 1 more clove of garlic, added 1 carrot, no garlic powder, chilli flakes for chilli pepper & used cuisinart to blend it all.  Let it set, delicious!  great on toast, dip for chips or veggies.

It was good! I had to add more of the seasonings at the end, you have to tweak to your preference with this dish i think.  I also could only find Extra Firm and Firm Lite so I combined the two.  it was really very good.  Boyfriend ate half of it before dinner was ready. Great with crackers

This was really delicious. Since I am completey lazy, I threw it all in the food processor. Only sub I made was some red pepper flakes instead of fresh red pepper and dried dill. Didn't measure exactly..  will made again
