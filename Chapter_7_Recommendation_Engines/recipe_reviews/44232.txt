Ok, I really changed this, but I want to post this so other people have an idea...I used the banana, apple, kiwi, and orange juice and I blended that.  Then I stirred in the yogurt and the peanut butter.  It was great, I really liked it...didn't use any of the other ingredients though.

Really is awesome!  Very filling - this would make a good breakfast on its own.  Just the right touch of peanut butter to make it a very unique-tasting smoothie.

Thanks for a terrific smoothie idea!  After playing with a few variations, I've found something that I use for breakfast at least 3-4 times a week.  Instead of the apple, I use a whole pitted plum.  Instead of OJ, I use 1/2 cup of apple juice.  Instead of soy milk and tofu, I use 7oz of Coconut milk!!  I prefer using a full 6oz of flavored yogurt.  For the grand finale, I mix in 2 tablespoons of dried bee pollen in lieu of the barley grass.  Blend it all up and I am off to a great start in the morning.

I tend to be skeptical of things that claim to be "the most awesome" or "the best", but I figured I'd give this a shot anyway. It was OK - definitely NOT the most awesome smoothie i've ever made.  Nothing I would make again. I think I'm the only reviewer so far who's made the recipe exactly as written. Most people leave out ingredients, so they're not really getting the true sense of the recipe.  Kind of a time consuming smoothie.

not my favorite - and definitely not the most awesome smoothie - i think i'd definitely have to get used to the "healthy" taste of it... i might try it again without the peanut butter.

This recipie was very good, but I tweaked it a little bit so that it would be less heavy and a little more sweet. I doubled the soy milk(use flavored to make the drink sweeter) and ditched the tofu. I also added a little bit of organic honey.  It was really good. To give it more flavor, use flavored organic yogurt, too!

It was alright, I thought it would be better. I had no tofu at home and the apples made the texture very....chunky. The kiwi was a nice touch as long as you don't add too much.

I also changed a number of things, and am posting so others can see different but similar ideas. Kept the fruit as is; switched 1c OJ (OJ + PB = bad combo for my taste) to 1/2 c Green Goodness juice for the green stuff I didn't have, and soy milk to cow's milk; didn't have tofu; didn't have aloe vera juice; subbed 2T ground flax for the flax oil. My husband is terrified of it, but my 15mo loves it and I enjoy it, too.

I love this smoothie: the nuttiness of the Peanut butter makes it very different! I double up on the yogurt (i use vanilla) and omit the tofu. I also add a little honey. I also freeze all of the fruit to give it a better texture and a colder taste.
