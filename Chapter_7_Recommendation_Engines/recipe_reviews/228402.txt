This recipe is wonderful. I cooked mine in the crockpot on high for 4 hours and it came out tender and juicy. The flavor was perfect! I did throw in some chopped garlic with garlic salt because we love garlic on our roast. This is a recipe to keep and cherish. Thanks for the add!

Very, very good - hubby loved it! I used what was left in a bottle of Shiraz (about 2/3 cup) & substituted low sodium cream of chicken soup only because I didn't have cream of mushroom. Used fresh mushrooms instead, which I'd quickly saut√©ed with  clove of garlic. A few grinds of black pepper & 3-1/2 hours later the roast was moist & tender, & the gravy was the perfect consistency & full of flavor. Also, I added some carrots & celery for the last 1-1/2 hours (turning up the oven to 325*) & served with ricotta mashed potatoes. We're actually looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

Wow! The hardest part of this perfectly simple recipe is having to endure the aroma for 4 hours (mine finished in 4).  It came out fork tender not stringy. No mess simple clean up. There is no wine taste, just perfectly seasoned gravy. I did use fresh mushrooms vs. canned since I had them. I normally "doctor" recipes but not this one. The only addition I made was dried minced garlic. I may try this out in my crockpot next time...but definatly making this again!!!

A tasty version of classic pot roast.   I added fresh mushrooms instead of canned and also threw in fresh baby carrots.  Yum!

This is my favorite pot roast recipe! It's so simple and delicious! One pot recipe. I throw in chunks of sweet potatoes/small red potatoes, onions & baby carrots in the roasting pan with the roast. I will use either red wine or balsamic vinegar, whatever I have on hand. I've tried both and it tastes great either way. My fiancee was RAVING about how amazing it was and what a good cook I was :) Haha!

Good! Better than I thought it'd be, actually. I chose this recipe because I accidentally opened a can of cream of mushroom the other day when I was looking for chicken broth, so needed to use that, and because I was gifted a couple of bottles of red wine over the holidays and I'm not a big fan of red wine (as a beverage, I mean, love it for cooking) and wanted to use some of that too. As this was a 'use up what I have' endeavour, I used stew beef instead of a full roast. I think I had about a pound and a half of beef, so if I made a 4 pound roast, I definitely would have wanted more gravy. It was also just a touch on the too salty side (but not so much that it was unpleasant) so in the future I might not add the entire packet of onion soup mix. I completely forgot the flour but I found it thick enough for me. Like a couple other reviewers, I cooked it in the crockpot, but I did about 3 hours on high and then about an hour and a half on low because when I checked it, it was starting to burn around the edges. It could have been a little more tender for my liking but that's probably because of the stew beef and turning down the temp. If I were to do it in the crock pot again, I'd probably do it on low 7-8 hours. All in all, very good though. It's very similar to a beef cubes-and-gravy meal my dad makes but the red wine took it to another level. The only downside to my meal was I made boxed mashed potatoes and their gloopy texture didn't do this delicious gravy justice.

While this recipe had a good concept going of cooking it slowly (I did 3 1/2 hours, so it was medium-rare), it really lacked in the flavor.  I think some thyme and salt would really kick it up a notch.

Made this  over the weekend and it was delicious!!  The only changes I made was to use fresh (slightly sauted first) mushrooms, added some onions, used Marsala wine as this is what I had and doubled the sauce.  My roast was a little under 4 pounds so I roasted it in foil for 4 hours.  Perfect!  Since there were only 2 of us, we had leftovers so the next day, I cut up the meat into cubes and made a delicious beef stroganoff with it.  I added additional mushrooms, sour cream and beef broth and served over pasta.  My husband said it was the best stroganoff he had ever tasted.  Will be making this again and will always double the sauce for stroganoff the next day :)  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Christmas dinner. The piece of meat was a rib-eye roast. I doubled the soup and burgundy amounts because it was a large piece of meat, and because I wanted plenty of extra sauce.  My family was so impressed, and the recipe was amazingly simple.  My uncle said it's the best holiday entree I've ever made.  I also tried the exact same method with chicken cutlets a week later (since I had extra wine), and it came out delicious too.

This was a real winner in our household.  I had a smaller roast - only have the size called for in the recipe, but left all other measurements the same, and used fresh  mushrooms instead of canned ones, and the whole family LOVED it, including two little boys 4 and 2 years old.  We will make this again for sure - thanks for the great recipe!

This was really delicious and easy! I used a Merlot wine and 2 containers of fresh mushrooms.  About an hour before I thought the roast would be done, I put in some cut up potatoes. I also sprinkled everything with some garlic powder, thyme and pepper to give it some extra flavor.  This makes such a great sauce!  This recipe is a keeper!

Love this recipe! Got it in the oven right now...2nd time making it.  I add Yukon potatoes and cut asparagus during the last hour and cook it in my Dutch oven. Also, I browned the roast before adding the other ingredients just because that's what I usually do.  Think the lil caramelized bits add a touch of extra flavor.  Even my picky eaters love this one!

Fantastic! This is going to be my new recipe for roast beef.  For years I have been doing the slow cooker beef; not any more, this is great! And as promised, very, very easy.  Plus it made the kitchen smell marvelous, and the taste of the wine in the beef was perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe :-)

Used half a packet of dried soup, as I was concerned about the sodium.  Used fresh mushrooms.  Added sliced onion and one clove of minced garlic.  Served with kale mashed potatoes.  So good, will certainly make again for a nice Sunday meal!

I thought that this was really easy and delicious! I put in fresh mushrooms but would put a pound great in next time. I also put it in the crockpot on high for 4.5 hours. Super yummy!

Very easy and smelled SO good while it was cooking.  Only 4 stars because it tasted a little salty (probably from the soup mix) and the gravy just needed ...something.
I'll make it again, but will read the reviews and get some ideas to make it even better.
BTW - I was true to the recipe, except used fresh mushrooms and cabernet sauvignon.

I cooked a 2.29 lb sirloin tip roast in my electric skillet at 300 degrees for 4 hours. Could have cooked it for a shorter time, but it was delicious. The leftovers were even better. I followed the recipe exactly and used the can of mushrooms. For a bigger roast, I think I would double the ingredients to have plenty of the delicious gravy.

This recipe is so delicious that I renamed it "Best Ever Roast Beef".  Thank you, Carina for submitting it! I have to admit that I did make some changes to your recipe. Instead of dry onion soup mix (too salty) I use fresh onions. I also use whatever wine that we have available. Our favorite is Cabernet, so it is usually the wine we use.

Turned out perfect!   The gravy went great with mashed potatoes!   I followed exactly as directed except my soup was mushroom garlic.  I am reluctant to use the crockpot because this was more of a ROASTED texture.

I didn't care for this flavor. Followed recipe exactly, I might not be a fan of Burgundy wine but I really didn't enjoy this at all.

I only used 2/3 of the onion soup mix, I used a cabernet sauvignon instead of the burgundy and I didn't use the mushrooms. I mixed the soups and wine together before pouring over the roast and I used a Dutch oven instead of the roasting pan. I didn't use the flour and wished I had,  I ended up thickening the gravy with a flour mixture after.The roast turned out moist and fork tender. The gravy was very good, I made mashed potatoes to go with it.

I used a 3 lb roast because I couldn't find a 4 lb one and I used saut√©ed mushrooms instead of canned. I also added a small bag of pearl onions and a small bag of baby yellow potatoes. The gravy with the potatoes was outstanding and this was so easy!  Since I used a smaller roast I cooked for three hours and it was perfect. Awesome recipe. Husband wants me to cook this every week now.

Excellent flavor, easy to put together in the crock pot, and with the addition of the flour the gravy was a good texture; didn't need to do more than pour it out and serve. Highly recommended.

Family gave it rave reviews. Even my picky eater loved it, except he pick out the mushrooms.  Will definitely make again!  I didn't have Burgundy wine so substituted Marsala. Was so good I will probably use Marsala next time too.

Fantastic. This is my top "Pot Roast" recipe now. I only added some minced garlic and cooked it in the crockpot.  It is wonderful.  I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots.

I left out the mushroom soup and used fresh mushrooms, carrots, and a bit of garlic.   The beef was tender and very good.   Next time I will increase spices.  We added salt and pepper at the table, but it needs more.

This roast came out very tender with its own gravy. Tasted delicious!  If serving with mashed potatoes, you might need more gravy.  I used a can of beef broth, 1 ounce package of the same onion soup mix, 1/4 cup of the same red wine, and simmered this for a few minutes to thicken (add a pinch of flour to make it thicker).  Add a couple tablespoons of the meat drippings if desired. The gravy flavors matched well with the meat flavors.

So simple! So good! I didn't change a thing and my husband (who hates mushrooms) finished his entire plate, went back for seconds then found a loaf of bread to soak up the gravy.  This is getting saved to my recipe box and will now be a regular. I served it with roasted rosemary fingerling  potatoes and a veggie medley containing Brussel sprouts, summer squash,  parsnips, butternut squash, onion, and garlic also roasted. So delicious and the gravy fell victim to being smothered over the veggies too.

Excellent recipe, we always double all ingredients and use balsamic vinegar instead of wine.  Also use fresh mushrooms if you have them,  and we add a bag of baby carrots, and a bag of mini potatoes.  So easy to make!

Was my first time making a roast.  I did as one of the other reviewers suggested and cooked it in the crock pot on high for four hours. I also added carrots and red potatoes to the pot. Super easy and the end result was super delicious :)

Made it as is with no variation to the ingredients.  I get large roasts as I have a big family, so I cut a 5# rump roast in half and covered each half with the recipe ingredients (whole portion for each half, so doubling the ingredients).  Had plenty of gravy for each that way.  One poster had mentioned maybe adding salt....I can't even imagine as this comes out plenty salty...don't salt it!  It was really good, but I gave it a 4 vs a 5 star because none of us found it spectacular, and my family said they preferred my "old way" of making roast.  I would give it a 5 for ease though!  I paired it with garlic mashed red skins (gravy gave it extra good flavor), and steamed green beans.

Great recipe. I've made this twice already...each time I used two packets of dry onion soup. I've been glad each time. I would recommend low and slow in a crockpot...8-10 hours. Be sure to let the meat rest as the recipe recommends to allow the juices to absorb. This is what I did the first time and the roast was fork tender and absolutely wonderful. The second time I made this I put it in a crockpot 5 hours on high. It was still yummy and pretty tender but the extra time is worth it.

The absolute best roast I've ever tasted. The whole family couldn't get enough. Simple to prepare and better than any high class restaurant roast beef. Received a lot of ''Wow Mom this is sooo good. Don't make it any other way.'' Used sirloin roast, but I would imagine that this would make any cut absolutely tender and delicious. Must be delicious with thick pork loins too.

Super easy to make and Absolutely Delicious!!! My husband and son can't get enough of it. I have made it several times and needed to add water after checking it half way through.
The one time I made it that I did not add extra liquid it burnt to the bottom of the crock pot.
A wonderful recipe that reminds me of the hearty family dinners that my mom would make when I was growing up.

This was very good and incredibly easy.  I like a lot of mushrooms, so I used a variety of fresh mushrooms.  Just put it in the oven and forget about it for a few hours -- perfect meal if you want a hot meal waiting for you at the end of the day.  Thanks you! Will definitely make again!

I didn't have Burgandy wine on hand so I used Marsala and this dish was a complete hit with the family. I took MommySmith's advice and cooked it in a crock pot for 4 hours on high and we served it over white rice with a side of vegetables. I will make this recipe for the rest of my life. You should too!
