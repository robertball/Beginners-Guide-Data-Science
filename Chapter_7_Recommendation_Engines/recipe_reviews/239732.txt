Not being a big fan of Miracle Whip I was quit surprised how well this turned out. This is so easy to make and would be perfect for those summer BBQ's. I will be making this again.

My grandfather made this for me when I was a kid.  So when I  made it I didn't use miracles whip, I used the generic whipped salad dressing and boy it was delicious
