Amazing!! I absolutely hated Velveeta and pork until my husband made me this dip. He added jalapeno for some serious kick. Best cheese dip/game day side ever!!!

Used Johsonville Sausage and italian diced tomatoes in this and it was a nice change. Quick and easy but nothing super duper special. Veganizable with vegan sausage and vegan cheese and cream of mushroom soup :)
