Good, but very, very spicy.  Don't get me wrong - I love spicy food. Maybe my peppers were extra hot, since I used home grown jalapeno peppers (canned). I may make these again, but will cut back on the peppers.

I used red potatoes 'cuz that's what I had on hand. I didn't have 4oz jar of jalapenos. I had 2 fresh jalapenos, took out the seeds and chopped up. Tasted just like scalloped potatoes but more cheesy and spice. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great basic recipe and was very quick and easy because of first boiling the potatoes. I did not have fresh peppers so I substituted 1/8 tsp. cayenne powder and 1/8 tsp. red chili pepper flakes. My husband gave it the thumbs up and my three year old seemed pleased. Will certainly make again! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Made for Recipe Group. I left out the pimentos and layered the potatoes in a 13x9. I liked this much better the next day. The taste of the canned peppers gave it a weird taste, but much better after it sat and melded flavors. The guys loved it from the get go! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was great for the over abundance of jalapeños in my garden, at the moment.  In fact, my family enjoyed these potatoes so much; I will freeze diced fresh jalapeños to make this in the winter months.  I admit to using fresh jalapeños rather than canned.  I also used white sharp cheddar because that is what I had on hand.  Rather than layering all the potatoes then adding the sauce, I put a layer of potatoes in the dish, added cheese sauce, potatoes, cheese sauce, etc.  I had 4 layers of potatoes and poured the remaining cheese sauce over the top.  The potatoes were served with ‘Pittsburgh Ham Barbecues’ another AR recipe.  My dad came to dinner tonight and he thought the meal was delicious.  Potatoes will be a repeat in our house.  Thanks LilSnoo for sharing your recipe – it is a keeper!

Made these for Recipe Group...Delicious! The cheese sauce came out so smooth and creamy, and the heat from the jalapenos gave these just enough of a spicy kick. Hubby really raved over these, but I already knew he was gonna love them, lol. These are a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was good, don't get me wrong but it was hotter than the depths of hell it might've been my jalapeños but I recommend not using that much jalapeños

I made this in November for recipe group, with some changes, but wanted to make it as written before reviewing it since I thought it might matter in this instance. I liked the changes and would make it again with them. As written, my potatoes didn't have a good texture but it may have been a "bad" batch white potatoes. It was also too hot for me with the full can of jalapenos. Not too hot to handle but not pleasant and overpowered the other flavors. However, the first time I steamed (in microwave) red potatoes instead of white and used fresh jalapenos instead of the canned. They were excellent- not as hot (maybe the jalapenos were milder) and didn't have the canned taste. The added bonus of cooking the potatoes this way is using the same dish for all the cooking except the sauce.

I thought the recipe was really good, even though I left out the pimentos. It was a really nice change from every day potato recipes. I think the cheese base could be used many different ways too.

I made the recipe as written, except I used two fresh jalapenos diced small, adding them to the milk, flour, etc. so they would soften a bit before putting the potatoes into the oven, and I used new potatoes (skin on).  These potatoes were delicious and a nice change.  I will make this again!

I was pleased with the recipe. Everyone liked the spicy taste!  I’m wondering if I could make a pan and freeze them?  Any advice?

I sliced these potatoes with a mandolin before boiling to make things easier on myself.  The flavor was decent, the cook time a little longer than stated.

Made this for our Easter Sunday taters...I added chopped bacon to the milk/cheese mix.  It was a big hit and have already been asked twice for the recipe a day later!!!

These potatoes  are definitely comfort food! I used the canned mild diced peppers, as my 8 year-old was eating this. The only major tweak I made was to slice the potatoes before boiling.  No need to boil the entire time -- simply remove them after about 10 minutes, as they will continue baking once they're in the oven. I didn't layer either -- just added the drained potatoes into the cheese sauce and dumped them into the baking dish. Next time, I will add more cheese to make a creamier sauce and use fresh, roasted jalapenos since the hubs and I like the heat. Adding bacon is a great idea too!

Very tasty change of pace!  Took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the jalapenos to half of a can and am glad I did.  Wow, I like things spicy and with only half the can, it was really spicy.  But also very good!  I have trouble boiling the potatoes the right amount.   The first time I made it, I undercooked them when boiling and this time probably overcooked them.  I used 5 potatoes and probably could have used a little more sauce, but that's what I get for adding a potato!  I skipped the pimentos.  Will definitely make again.   Thanks for the great recipe!

I have not made it yet...sounds like a five...I would like to know this recipe is for how many servings.
For some reason you always had the number of servings listed, but now, most of your recipes have no number of servings shown.

Very good! I used jarred jalapenos and colby jack cheese because that's what I had on hand. Didn't have any pimentos but I bet that would have made it better. Good and easy. Next time I hope to have sour cream and pimentos on hand!

This is a plate of spicy creamy yumminess.  To reduce fat and calories I subbed chicken broth for the milk and after it thickened I stirred in the jalapenos, shredded velveta, and 1/4 cup of fat-free sour cream.
