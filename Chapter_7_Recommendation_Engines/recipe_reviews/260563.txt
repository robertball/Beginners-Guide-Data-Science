So rich and delicious. Small pieces are plenty. I used maple syrup instead of Caro in pecan mixture, for just a little more flavor. Elegant-looking with whipped cream as a dinner party dessert.

Followed directions as stated. I wouldnâ€™t make it again.  Tasted like brownies with lots of nuts on top. Nothing special.

This was so delicious! The brownie got chewy/ overcooked a bit which is the only reason I gave this 4 stars. The pecan pie topping was so good. Overall a delicious and show stopping dessert!
