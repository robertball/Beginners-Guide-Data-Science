I have never made baba ghanouj with pomegranate molasses so I wanted to try this recipe.  It is wonderful.  I normally use lemon juice and a slightly different recipe but I really like this version.  It's so flavorful.  I roasted the eggplant on a smoking grill for about an hour and followed the recipe as it is written.  It paid off because this tastes lovely!

This looked like it was going to be good.  I have never tried making anything with eggplant before.  When it was all done in the oven, I slice it open and it was a big glob of stringy mush.  I don't know how I could have separated the seeds, all of the insides would have come out with them.  I tossed it in the trash.
