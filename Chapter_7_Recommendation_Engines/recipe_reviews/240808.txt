Tastes as good as it looks!  I had 4 cups of flowers to use.  I suggest letting the flowers dry off if you wash them just before you use them in this recipe.

I was really second-guessing the whole adding plants into my butter, but it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe
P.S. add in some grass if you want a more nutty taste

I love the light, radish-y flavor of nasturtium in salad, so I was intrigued by this recipe when I saw it.
