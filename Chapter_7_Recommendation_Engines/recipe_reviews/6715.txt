As a Canadian I have NEVER heard these called "Canadian Doughnuts" -- they are BEAVER TAILS (or Whale Tails for the places that rip off the Beaver Tails company).  This is OK, but there is a more authentic recipe in this site called "Beaver Tails from a real Canadian".  Like the original from Ottawa that recipe uses only whole wheat flour too.

PLEASE!  Although they are LIKE doughnuts, these are called:  "Beaver Tails", not "Canadian Doughnuts"!   
I'm from Ottawa, and my favourite is indeed the Killaloe Sunrise (fresh lemon juice squirted over a generous sprinkling of sugar & cinnamon on the Beaver Tail).  That with a cup of hot chocolate after skating five miles on the Ottawa Canal, on a cold February day, is pure satisfaction. :-)

The first time I have this doughnuts was in a farm fair in Ancaster. They called it "Elephant Ears", a French Canadian friend told me that they usually call it "Beaver Tails".
Anyways, I found this bread tastes really great, crispy outside and soft & chewy inside. So I looked for the recipe here and tried to make it at my own kitchen. This recipe is good! Exactly the same thing that I had in the Fair!
Thank you!

Yummy ... we call these mini elephant ears on the west coast.  My girlfriend, who is one, calls them Mormon Scones.  Whatever they're called...they are deeeelicious!!!  Shortcut...use Rhodes Frozen rolls and save a ton of time.  Simply thaw on a cookie sheet, roll out & fry'em up.  My 5 g'kids will eat 3 dz. faster than I can get them sugared & cinnamoned. I toss them in a brown paper sack with sugar & cinnamon.

Sooo good, kids loved them!  Light and fluffy, full of taste.  Lemon juice adds a nice zip to them.  I tested the amount on the first doughnut, remember a little goes a long way.  Add a small amount until you get the amount that is right for you!

I tried this one but not the other one yet. It makes a lot of Beaver tails ... regardless of what it is called. (In Ottawa it is called Beaver Tails) 

It is good but I find that making it the size of Beaver tails is hard to do at home. I make mine smaller (about 8inches long and 4 inches wide.

These are good and VERY easy.  I make half the recipe and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar but haven't tried the lemon juice.  They usually puff up and are hollow when fried.

Not a bad creation.  Certainly yummy, but definitely not like our Canadian "Beaver Tails."  Just a tidbit of interesting information, in Hungarian, these delicious treats would be called Langos.  A Hungarian food speciality, a deep fried flat bread made of a dough with flour, yeast, salt and water.  At many fairs there is a booth that sells Elephant Ears and they use a tradional recipe as well because most of those booths are operated by a Hungarian owner or a member of the Hungarian dance troops.  Hey, just food for thought! :)

The recipe was nice, although I found the lemon juice gave an unwanted bitter taste. It's just my opinion though - some might like the extra zest.

Eating-wise, try them topped with maple butter and melted chocolate. So good!

you do actually need the lemond juice, we also substituted the 4 cups of whole wheat flour for 4 cups of all-purpos flour so there was not any gunk left in the oil,we put a vanilla glaze on some of them also; its icing sugar water and vanilla.

Great but I've had better!  The whole wheat adds more sweetness to the dough.

I was unable to get an effective sprinkling- used glaze instead. I added milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg in dough.

Me, my Thai wife and our little girl, all liked this, so quite a triumph. I prepared using a bread machine, maybe next time I would add something a little spicier. We sliced them in half, put in some jam and ate.

The doughnut itself was to chewy and soft in the middle
