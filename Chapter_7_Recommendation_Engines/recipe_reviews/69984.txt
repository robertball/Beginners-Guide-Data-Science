I am the original poster of this recipe (been trying to log-on to that account, but haven't been able to get the password right!)  Baking times are truly variable, depending on your oven.  You must watch cookies closely, I've found that once there is a light brown tinge, the time is right.  The cookie's thickness will also affect baking times and textures.  My avg is around 12-15 minutes, 17 minutes is too long, but of course all ovens are different.   Lastly, sifted flour is vital.  Regular flour makes it heavy and crumbly.  That being said, this is one of my all time favorites.  Rich, buttery and oh so good.  I always end up adding much more cherries and walnuts than the original recipe calls for:  usually up to 1c each, and I chop of the cherries very fine so that they are more evenly distributed.  Every Christmas I get asked to make these.

Very good cookie. Instead of using my kitchen aid I decided to use my hand mixer and it worked fine. I did not sift the flour. After everything was mixed I did have to mush it together by hand and I lightly kneaded in the cherries and nuts. The dough was wonderful to work with, was easy to form and lightly flatten with a fork. I baked them on a parchment-lined sheet for 13-14 minutes. Removed the sheet from oven and let them sit for about 2 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack. I don't like airbake sheets but if you decide to use one you may need to bake longer. I'll try to use half vanilla and half almond extract next time to see if the almond will compliment the cherries. I made a little cherry drizzle out of maraschino juice, milk, almond extract, melted butter and powdered sugar. Also made a cocoa drizzle with vanilla, milk, cocoa powder and powder sugar. Drizzled all the cookies with both chocolate and cherry drizzle. Cookie tasted good, looks great, and freezes well. Will make great little Christmas or valentine cookies. And, they taste great with coffee! This cookie is a hidden gem here on allrecipes!

I think the powdered sugar gives this a nice delicate texture, overall it has a very buttery kind of taste.  Delicious if you're into the shortbread type of cookies (which I am.)  I added Christmas colored non-pareils to give it a festive look.  I can easily see adding red white and blue ones for July 4th, pastel colored ones for Easter or birthdays, etc...  I also added the powdered sugar to the finished baked product.  A really great, tasty, butter cookie!  And I agree, I could really see these would go well with coffee or tea.

I tried these for the first time this past Christmas and we all LOVED them. My son, home sick from school today, asked me to make them but we don't have any maraschino cherries. As it's getting close to Easter, I used chopped up jelly beans instead! I also threw in a mini box of lemonade-flavored Nerds candy for good measure. I know it sounds like a weird combo but they are FABLUOUS! The jelly beans are chewy and the Nerds are crunchy...yummmm!! Just watch the time-mine were perfect in 12 minutes, any more and they would have been overdone. They should be just a pale light brown on the bottom. I wonder what else I can throw in these cookies??? :)

A hit at Thanksgiving!  It is VERY important to use confectioner's sugar and SIFTED flour.  I noticed the first time I made these I didn't use the sifted flour and they turned out the way "Shanny" described, undercooked in the middles and browned at the bottom.  It is also VERY important that when you smash it down with a fork, you do it enough to make it somewhat flat, something like the pictures that were submitted.  Again, this will avoid the undercooked middle and overcooked outside.  Absolutely excellent!  Wonderful texture and taste!  A new holiday tradition, can't wait to make again in a few weeks for Christmas!

Very good! First batch I undercooked, I took out when they started to brown but the insides weren't done. Next batch I left in recommended time and came out great! Thanks for recipe!

A hidden treasure on allrecipes!!  The basic recipe is divine.  For my own liking I added two jars of chopped maraschino cherries and pink coloring gel, rolled them into balls and into rainbow sprinkles, then flattened them slightly by hand.  Left the nuts out.  They are the perfect cookie for all occasions.  Love, love, love this recipe!!!

I made these without the walnuts and with a few extra cherries and they turned out great. I also tried using an electric mixer to add the flour, and it worked, but it was harder to form the dough into balls that stuck together.

5 star recipe as written!  I love a good shortbread cookie, but this was amazing with the cherries and walnuts added to it.  We made a revision that made this a 10 star cookie.  We used some of the cherry juice, butter, and powdered sugar and made a glaze for them. THAT was genius and made it a killer cookie!!

I did not use the walnuts, but instead used white chocolate chips to make these red and white for the holidays.  When the cookies were cooled, I dipped them in melted white chocolate and topped with holiday sprinkles.  The looked very festive and are a delicious cherry cookie.

I love this shortbread type cookie. The buttery, soft texture is delicious and melts in your mouth. You can do so many diferent things with the dough to make different cookies each time. This time I used green maraschino cherries, a little green food coloring, rolled them in to 1" balls and pushed a kiss in the center as soon as they came out of the oven. Great for the grandkids to take to daycare/school. Everyone loved them. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy shortbread-ish sugar cookie.  Nice touch of cherry with the maraschinos.  Perfect compliment to a cuppa joe.

Nothing says Christmas Cookies at the Cookie Exchange like these yummy buttery vanilla/cherry cookies do!!  They are always a huge hit.  This particular recipe is one of the best I've used for this type of cookie.  Certain to be the one we use traditionally!  NOTE: I add three heaping tbs of corn starch and a couple of drops of almond exctract to the dough.  It compliments the recipe perfectly.

I was disappointed in these cookies.  Granted, I used almonds instead of walnuts, but really I didn't think the cookie had much cherry flavor.  I even made a glaze from the maraschino juice (as someone had suggested) to try and give it some more cherry oomph, but I don't think it made much difference.

Great tasting cookie.  I used a bit more cherries than recommended and it came out lovely.  Will most certainly make again.  I think I may try substituting cherries with chocolate chips next time.

I followed the recipe to a t.  They remind me of a mexican wedding cookie a little bit.  If I make these again I would up the cherries to probably 1 Cup.  I thought the 1/2 cup was a little on the light side.  Thanks for sharing they are easy to make and look very pretty.

I made this reciped exactly as stated except with pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  It was wonderful!! I could sit and eat every cookie.  The powdered sugar makes them seem lighter but they are soooo goood.

These cookies were awesome. I added mini chocolate chips instead of the nuts. The dough was a little crumbly, but the baked cookies weren't. I baked mine for only 12 minutes and they came out perfectly. My kids said they were the best cookies ever!

These are a delight.  The nostalgic name and the charming photos caught my eye; I just had to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did.  It's a classic, just as a Home Ec recipe should be!  I halved the recipe with great results - 2 dozen lovely and delicious cookies in less than an hour, including a bit of extra Christmas decorating - I drizzled them with an icing of confectioner's sugar, half/half and maraschino cherry juice and finished with some red/green sprinkles.  Thank you for sharing, and  Merry Christmas!

Not sure what happened but we did not like these at all.  The dough was very elastic, like bread dough and did not bake all the way through after 20 minutes at 350.  Followed everything according to recipe but mine turned out like little doughy rocks.

A great old fashioned cookie, perfect for the holidays!  I also drizzled some with melted chocolate and sprinkles.  Made double batches and froze dough, they came out perfect.

My kid gobbled them up and I'm quite satisfied with the result! the cookies were good and pretty, I put a whole cherry on top and no icing. Only, I added an egg because with my kitchen aid the dough won't come together no matter how long I mixed

Made these for my family at Christmas and they were a HUGE hit!  I can't wait to make them again...perfect for Valentine's Day as well!  I did follow some other's advice and doubled the amount of cherries in the recipe.  I also made my own confectioner's sugar glaze and drizzled the cookies while they were still a little warm and sprinkled them with Holiday sprinkles.  These really are awesome cookies!

Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe! It's a wonderful twist to my regular shortbread type recipes. The cherries are delightful & like you mentioned, they're awesome with a cup coffee too! YUM! I did make with pecans because that's what I had (highly recommend them now too! :o)

Very good cookies!!!  They aren't too sweet and have great texture.  I did add an egg though cause I didn't want them to be too crumbly as some people stated they were.  I also added some green sprinkles as well.  Santa will love these!

These look delicious! I haven't made them yet, but your recipe caught my eye, because I, too, was in Home Economics classes at Venice High School! I remember making a Boston Cream Pie! Who knows..maybe we were in the same class? I was there 1969-1972. I definitely will be making these! thanks!

I can't believe I have never reviewed these. I've made them every year since I stumbled upon this recipe years ago. Perfect as is. The only change that I make is to use all almond extract instead of vanilla. I love them with nuts, but some of the people I bake for don't; so I make half with nuts and half without. Thank you for this recipe!

These are amazing.  I added finely chopped candied red and green cherries and pecans instead of maraschino cherries because I wanted to include them on my holiday cookie trays.  I used my standing mixer, so instead of kneading them by hand, I let the mixer do it for a minute or so.  The cookies turned out perfect.  I can't think of anything that would make them better!

OMG these cookies are fabulous! The only change I made to the recipe was other than using 2 tsp vanilla extract I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract per other reviewers. Other than that, I did everything exactly as written. I came out with 5 dozen cookies and that was perfect for me. I also made a quick sugar glaze using 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 5 tbsp maraschino cherry juice, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 tsp almond extract to drizzle over half the cookies (so delicious!). The only change I will make next time is to double the almond extract and maybe add a few more cherries. I also wonder how well almonds would taste in place of the walnuts in this recipe. Hmmm... Anyway, try this recipe!!!

I thought these cookies were good, and they have a lot of potential. I followed the recipe exactly, I just made half a batch. I think I will add some cherry juice next time to give them a stronger cherry flavor... and maybe some chocolate chips, or dip them in white chocolate. Thanks for the recipe!

I baked these closer to 8 minutes, but I also made smaller cookies.  They are very cute cookies, with a small amount of cherry flavor, but so easy, that they are easily made again with more.  (I haven't tried, but they were so so easy, it can't be hard  ;)  I found my fork was sticking so I used some confectioner's sugar on my fork to help, and it did.  Very cute, tasty little cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good butter cookie.  I did use white chocolate chips in place of the walnuts, though.  Will make again when I have macadamia nuts to add, also.

I just made these. They are good. I did omit the nut because  I am giving them to someone who can't eat nuts. The batter was crumbly and very hard to work with. Otherwise these are good. I might see about adding some Cherry flavor next time to give the bites that have no cherry a bit of cherry flavor. I will also make them again with the nuts.

These were good, but the dough was extremely crumbly and almost impossible to work with. Because of that, I probably won't make these again.

No taste, probably should add almond flavoring, if I didn’t put a glaze on them, would’ve had no taste at all.

LOVE these! I about doubled the cherries and used pecans instead of walnuts, and they were fantastic! Even members of my family who don’t typically eat nuts liked them!

These cookies are delicious.  The only change I made was that I drizzled icing over the tops.  A very tender, rich and perfectly flavored cookies with nice texture and cherry goodness from the chopped maraschinos.

Used almonds instead of walnuts,a smidge more than called for, added two tablespoons cherry juice and red food coloring to wet ingredients. Mix til just incorporated with kitchen aid mixer, and doubled the cherrys. Loved!

These are delicious! I made them smaller than ping pong ball size and left out the Walnuts on half the dough. The other half, I put walnuts on top.

This dough is nice to work with.  I needed to leave out nuts because of allergy reasons. The kids liked them and I’ll be using them for a Christmas bake sale.

Epic fail. No flavor at all. I followed the recipe.  No butter, sugar nor cherry flavor. I used really good ingredients. I've been cooking for over fifty years and this the worst recipe I've ever tried.

This recipe will blow your socks off!  Unfortunately, I didn't have any cherries or nuts on hand, so I just used some freeze dried raspberries.  Wow!  They turned out so delicious.  It was hard to not eat the batter too.  So yummy!

I added food colouring and white chocolate chips like a couple of the reviewers did, like the visual effect of that. I used half a cup of milk to knead the dough, which increased the cooking time a bit but made them very soft and chewy.

I made these delicious buttery cookies and they came out perfect.  I did not change the recipe at all.  They were a huge hit!  A new Christmas  tradition in my book!

I love cherries so took advice of others and put in a cup instead of 1/2, otherwise followed directions exactly.  Very heavy butter cookie with a light cherry flavor.  Not exactly the cherry flavor I was looking for, but a good, heavy butter cookie that is great with coffee!

I've made these cookies 4 or 5 times now and they always turn out great, full of cherry buttery goodness! The first couple times I followed the recipe exactly and took them to a couple Christmas parties. Everybody loved them. I like to experiment so the next time I tried adding 2t of the juice from the cherries to the dough. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla and used almonds instead of walnuts. I liked them even better that way! For my most recent batch, I added red food coloring and rolled the balls in sugar before flattening. The pink color looks so pretty on the cookie tray. Watch carefully during baking. My first batch got way too brown. They only needed 11 minutes in my oven.

Husband's coworkers loved them, and raved about them. I thought they were a little too buttery, but that could be because I left out the walnuts and the cookie was less "full" of goodies. Next time I will add more cherries and include the walnuts.

These are probably really good butter cookies. I don't think I like this type of cookie, though. They weren't bad.

Thought these turned out a little dry. They took forever to bake because the middles just weren't getting cooked. Then when they were completely baked through, they turned out with dark bottoms and very dry. And I followed the recipe exactly.
