Pour enough stock to just cover the quinoa. Allow the liquid to reduce to half. Continue this process until quinoa is soft and all stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes   Did you read this part kc37?

Solid, healthier alternative to egg noodles.  I made these changes to speed things along.
- cook 1 can chicken broth with 1/2 can quinoa 10 min in microwave, stir 2 x
- add one can 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and two cans drained tuna
- stir, add to 9*9 casserole and bake at 375 for 45 min

I would add fresh herbs and maybe peas next time to give it color.  It looked unappetizing, but tasted good.

I substituted olive oil for the butter, used 3 of the 2.3 oz tuna packets and only used 4 cups of stock.  the quinoa was totally cooked by then and any more stock would probably have made it mushy.  Also I did not want to open another box of stock.  I also added peas and will probably add broccoli, cauliflower and/or ground turkey next time.  To season I used some tumeric, lots of cumin, minimal cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt while I was cooking the quinoa.

This was a really good recipe and it leaves a lot of room for additions which is nice.  I don't feel like I have to run to the store to spend $10 on one ingredient--these are all things that I have or will use normally.  Five stars for convenience, versatility, inexpensiveness, healthiness and tastiness.

This was good for being a healthy version of tuna casserole.  I added spinach and another can of tuna as I wanted it to be a stand alone meal.  I think of tuna casserole as full of tuna and I feel like this could have even had a 3rd can, but that's probably a personal preference. (I also think somewhere along the way my portions were bigger as it didn't all fit in my casserole pan)  Thanks for a great idea!

A very versatile casserole recipe. The quinoa can be cooked in the microwave with about 4 cups of vegetable/chicken stock. Based on what we had in the house, we added one can of condensed mushroom soup, a cup of frozen peas, a cup of frozen stir-fry vegetables, half of a sauteed red onion, two small cans of tuna, and a variety of seasonings (cumin, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, cilantro, black pepper, regular salt, chili powder, and a little cayenne pepper), with seasoned panko crumbs on top. The quinoa cooked in the microwave in about 15 minutes, stirring and adding liquid every five minutes. The casserole set nicely and browned around the edges in about 30 minutes. It made a very satisfying meal. Next time I will probably add another can of tuna and would be comfortable adding any vegetables around the house.

I'm pretty particular about tuna noodle casserole, but this was good. I'm not sure what could up the flavor a little, but I might try to add something next time.

I added peas & an extra can of tuna. Instead of bread crumbs, I sprinkled with Panko crumbs and unsalted roasted slivered almonds.  It added a crunch to the dish.

Since I have very high cholesterol & can't have either noodles or white rice, this is a great alternative.  Added a little chopped fresh basil at the end for some fresh herbage & was awesome.  Thanks so much for giving me one of my fave dishes back!

I omitted mushrooms and added zucchini, red bell pepper and corn.  I also added a little salsa to the mix.   I would like to substitute the 1/4 cup butter but couldn't think of an alternative.   It came out delicious.

I cooked this tonight. I loved it. Next time I would add more tuna, maybe peas, and cayenne pepper or other spices. I feel comforted by the taste, and not feeling weighed down like you do with traditional Tuna Noodle Casserole. I did add spinanch like another reviewer suggested, substituted butter with olive oil, and used panko plain breadcrumbs.Thank you for a new recipe in my collection!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I added some garlic, 2 cans of tuna, and I used a quinoa and bulgar mix.  
I would have never thought to use quinoa.  Thanks for the inspiration. I will be making this again.

I thought the recipe was okay, just an average tuna casserole, but my significant other took one bite and wouldn't eat any more.  I did make a few simple changes to the recipe, adding more tuna and adding some fresh asparagus, neither of which should have changed our reaction to the recipe much as we like tuna and asparagus.  I've concluded that my SO simply doesn't like quinoa, as this is the second recipe I've tried that included it and he wouldn't eat.

Used a chicken broth with garlic (great flavor if you like garlic) and 2 cans of tuna.  Next time I will add 2 more cans of tuna (4 small or a couple of large cans) and other veggies (peas would be perfect)

I really liked this!  I am a big tuna casserole fan and wanted to try a substitution without the refined carbs.  I did make a few changes to make it more like my go-to pasta recipe: I added celery with the onions and mushroom to saute; I added a pound of frozen peas, I used 3 cans of tuna (feeding 7 people and like more protein), I didn't use any bread crumbs because we were out, but I mixed in parmesan cheese and topped with more of it.   I didn't use chicken broth either, just water for the quinoa, and I only ended up needing about 4.5 cups.  Everything came together really well and I loved the final result.  I only take away 1 star because I think it really needs at least two cans of tuna and also a couple of my kids didn't like it.  I'll make it again though, I'm a mean mom that way!

All the necessary parts are here. I threw in some garlic with the onions and mushroom, and added some shredded cheese to the bread crumbs. The taste was nice, but everything was just a little too homogenous. When I make this again, I‚Äôm probably going to add some red bell pepper and a leafy green ‚Äì most likely broccoli or spinach.

This was really good and really quite filling. I cut the recipe in half and made a small one for our family of 3.  We had steamed chard on the side of it, very good!

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  I had asparagus to use up, so I chopped it into about 2 inch pieces and mixed it in.  I also topped with cheese and crumbled ritz crackers (don't have bread crumbs).  I had a can of cream of mushroom soup, so added that in too.  It was great, and my husband LOVED it!  To make it easier, just cook the quinoa the regular way but shorten the time a couple of minutes to leave some moisture for the baking.  So good!  Everyone will love it!

I used mostly no-salt versions of the ingredients, one onion, and 4 c. of chicken stock. I didn't add any salt or pepper. It still was very tasty. I might add more mushrooms next time and try it with shrimp instead of tuna.

This ended up to be very good, I did take some of the suggestion from the reviews. I add garlic, to the mushrooms and onions, I add a can of mushroom soup, after I cook the Quinoa in Chicken broth I also added an extra can of tuna. Topped in with a small amount of bread crumb and cheese and baked. My husband and daughter were pleasantly surprised on how good it turn out. So was I, Quinoa has such a strong bitter taste sometime, but not with these additions.

This was awesome!  Way better than the traditional tuna casserole and healthy, too!  I am going to make this regularly for my family.  Thanks!!!!!  The only thing I did different was add an extra can of tuna.

If seasoned correctly, this is totally awesome.  As a low-carber also, decided to give this a try.  Doctor told me to add in more complex carbs so quinoa was suggested.  Made this almost exactly as written except I seasoned with cayenne pepper, seasoned salt and lots of black pepper.  I did saute the mushrooms and onions in a mix of avocado oil and olive oil seasoning them as well.  I also left the quinoa slightly al dente for a little texture.  I used a can of tuna and a can of tiny shrimp just because it was on hand.  This turned out super yummy!  There is quite a bit of quinoa so either reduce it or increase your tuna ratio.

Like others have said, this is a great basic and versatile casserole recipe. I was easily able to make substitutions for items I didn't have. I was out of quinoa, butter and mushrooms, so I omitted the butter, used frozen mixed veggies instead of mushrooms, cooked egg noodles (instead of quinoa) in the broth, and mixed half of the remaining broth, after the noodles were cooked, back into the mixture and allowed to thicken. Sprinkled grated cheddar cheese on top.
