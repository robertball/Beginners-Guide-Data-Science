I made this for dinner tonight.  It was quick and easy, and tasted great.  I followed the recipe with the addition of a tsp of garlic, salt and pepper  in with the chicken while browning,  I also added a can of black beans and some frozen corn to the rice when I added the chicken back in.  Filling, delicious and not too spicy for my 7 year old :)

My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so I couldn't use the Knorr sidekicks, but I kept the idea by using brown rice, fresh broccoli, and shredded lactose-free cheddar. Substituted the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! spread with lactose-free butter as well, and it turned out great! It really is a beautifully coloured dish with great flavours. Filling and easy to make, will definitely make again!

I made this just as directed and it was very good. My family just loved it and wants me to keep making it every week. It is very tasty plus it makes a beautiful presentation. Very colorful.

Okay, I didn’t get finish.... Delicious meal...teeny modifications. It needed a little salt and pepper. Also, a fun way to spice it up would be to add some black beans to it. Also, I added cheese to personal plate and it was delicious.

This wasn't anything special, and the choice of the broccoli cheddar rice is a bit odd.  A Spanish or Mexican rice would probably work better here.  I marinated my chicken beforehand, and I'm glad I did because otherwise the chicken would have been pretty tasteless.

This recipe was incredibly easy! I followed the recipe as is minus one addition of corn. Great base recipe and can be modified in so many ways to your own personal preference or as to what you may have on hand. Next time will throw in beans also as some other reviewers suggested. It’s a keeper !

I used regular butter instead of the "I can't believe it's not butter" and it came out pretty tasty.
