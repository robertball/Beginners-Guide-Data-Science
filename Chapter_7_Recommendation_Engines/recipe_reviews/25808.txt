I think these are the greatest, very quick and easy to make, they're especially a hit with all the ladies. I've been making these for over 2 years now and I still get raves over them. I sometimes add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the recipe and also substitute 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips in the first cup of chips in the recipe. To help make handling the dough easier, I keep my hands damp with cold water, rinsing occasionally, while I'm rolling the dough into balls, I also always use parchment paper when baking any cookie recipe.

SO DECADENT!  I just got done making these and they are so delicious!  I noticed that others had trouble with the cookies spreading, so I froze the batter for a 2-3 hours first.  I then used a small ice cream scoop to form the balls, any ice cream scoop with anti-freeze liquid in it should work.  Make sure to use a good non-stick cookie sheet but do NOT grease it!  And letting them sit for 5 minutes on the sheet to finish cooking before taking them off is a must, trying to take them off before them will only break them. I will definitely be making these again!

WARNING: YOU MUST REALLY LOVE CHOCOLATE TO ENJOY THESE COOKIES!!!  I made a batch to take to a meeting tonight.  It's very important to thoroughly chill the dough, not just for easier handling.  The first batch I baked tasted kind of floury, so I had to eat them myself ;).  I think letting the dough rest helps absorb the flour and baking powder.  I dropped by tablespoons and adjusted the baking time accordingly.  I also sprinkled some cookies with sliced almonds and some with cocoanut...nice appearance.  If you want cocoanut flavor, you'll need to mix some cocoanut into the dough.  Sprinkling on top just gave a bare hint of cocoanut flavor.  This is a very good recipe, and not difficult to make!

This a great recipe for RICH, chocolately cookies. Have a glass of milk nearby. As an added suggestion, I used a 2 Tbsp. cookie scooper to make larger balls of dough and I rolled them in powdered sugar before I baked them.  Baking them for 10-12 minutes should bake them enough since they are larger than the 1-inch recipe recommended cookie size.  I gave them out to friends and brought them into work....everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  The larger cookies yield about 2 dozen+.

Sept. 18, 2009:  These are amazing little cookies!  The perfect chocolatey indulgence that I was looking for.  Really, nothing is too chocolate for me and I love dark chocolate, so these are perfect for me!  I followed the recipe exactly (refrigerating for 1 hour) and they came out perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe!  ******UPDATE 7/30/10:  This is officially my most favorite chocolate cookie EVER!  This time I added 1 1/2 tsp. Watkins raspberry flavoring and they are to die for!  Just heavenly.  The dough is really sticky, so I use a cookie sccop to make it easier.

Been making these for years, same recipe as the Taste of Home one only available to paid subscribers on this site.  Anyway, mine come out different than the picture in the recipe - not so many "points" but that's b/c I roll them well.  They are rounded little puffs with cracks in them.  VERY important to not overcook these.  Just until puffed with little cracks is perfect.  I adore this recipe, make them every Christmas and keep dough in the freezer all the time so I can pop a few when I need a chocolate rush!

This recipe is great!!!! It has become a staple in my family for all get togethers. It is an easy recipe and tastes amazing. The cookies melt in your mouth. The only advice I have is not to over cook them. The 9-11 minute cooking time is a must. They are great rolled in chopped nuts, powdered sugar or colored sugar.

These are good and chocolaty, just what I wanted. After I got the batter ready it seemed very thin but I put it in the fridge and it firmed up wonderfully. I couldn't roll it into balls because it stuck to my fingers so I just dropped them by teaspoonsful.  I frosted some of the cooled cookies with chocolate frosting and oh my, they are so good.

I've made these cookies several times, and each time I have to bring along copies of the recipe.  Almost everyone has said these are the most delicious cookies they've ever had.

These are unbelievable! If you like chocolate, you will love these. I am very grateful to the reviewer who recommended dipping your hands in cold water (and keeping them wet) when handling the dough- makes things much easier! My only other comment is to keep the cookies small because they are so rich, and make sure you use parchment paper when cooking. This recipe is outstanding- thank you so much!

YUMMY!  Best chocolate cookies I've ever made.  This is for Chocolate Lovers!  The only changes I made was that I only added 1/2 c. of chocolate chips into the dough and I baked them for 12 min.

Oh. My. Gosh. If you're a Chocoholic, you'll love these sinfully decadent cookies. They have an oh-so-delicate crisp exterior and a fudgey soft almost-brownie-like center. I didn't have unsweetened baking chocolate, so I substituted 3/4 cup cocoa and 3 tbsp cooking oil for it, and the cookies still turned out perfectly! Also, I didn't have time to refrigerate them overnight, so I put the covered bowl of dough in the freezer for 1.25 hours, stirring it every 20 minutes to cool evenly. Then I used a cookie scoop (looks like a mini ice-cream scoop) to scoop out the dough. Saved my hands from a sticky mess. I would recommend checking them after 7 minutes of baking time. Mine were done in 8. Next time, I'm going to try variations on this recipe: almond or raspberry flavoring or mint chocolate chips, or maybe maraschino cherry halves sunk into the top for Christmas.   Hubby and kids (and I) loved them! Hubby said they were --- hands down---- the BEST chocolate cookie he's ever tasted. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Raspberry - the only thing that can improve on these cookies! I call mine Chocolate Raspberry Thunder. Make cookies as per Kevin's recipe. Change nothing except you may want to use parchment paper on your cookie sheet! When baking, DO NOT press dough down to make cookies flatten. When done cooking, cookies will be dome shaped. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes. Using a finger, thumb, or rounded end of spoon, very carefully press down in center of cookies, making a small well. Be sure not to go all the way through to the parchment paper; cookie will expand a little. Fill the well with seedless raspberry preserves, usually @ 1/2 teaspoon, and flatten to shape to top of cookie (I use a small cupcake icing knife for this step). Very carefully, place fingers around the bottom of cookie and push slightly to reshape so it's round again but don't squeeze so hard that it pushes the filling out of the middle. Place in freezer for @ one hour, then wrap individually with plastic wrap, put in freezer bag or container and keep frozen for the occasional best cookie you've ever eaten (if you haven't eaten half of them already!). Note: you can also make a well in dough and fill with preserves before cooking. Either way is good, but I like the flavor better when the preserves are fresh. I'd write a custom menu but not a supporting member.

These are basically the same cookie I've been making for years under the heading "Double Chocolate Brownie Cookies."  The only difference is the extra 6 oz of chocolate, which is a great improvement as far as I'm concerned.  I didn't notice that unsweetened chocolate was called for until I began, so I used Ghirardelli bittersweet and cut the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup.    It's important to refrigerate the dough first to prevent spreading.  I kept the dough in the refrigerator between batches and put the second batch in the freezer on the cookie sheet for a few minutes until the first batch was cooked.  You really don't want to overbake them.  Just think of them as brownies and bake only until the top is a little crackly.  The middles will be nice a fudgy.  I froze most of them so I can take them out a few at a time "as needed."  They are a great chocolate fix!

i loved these. why are there so many reviews saying this is too rich or too chocolatey? the description says that it's "very rich" for the "true chocoholic." if that's not what you're looking for, don't make it. think, people!

These were so good! They are the best while they're hot because they are chewy. However, they are very rich so I recommend using milk chocolate chips so that it's not so rich. They harden very quickly, so I suggest covering them as soon as they cool.

This was amazing. Loved them. Whenever you refrigerate cookie dough and shape them, they tend to retain their shape so i squish them down for a classic cookie look. I like this recipe because you can fit 16-20 cookies on pan (instead of 12) and not worry about them touching each other. You could probably shape them into a heart or something. I ran out of chocolate chips so i used white, and it gave them more color and flavor. This recipe can easily put Mrs.Feild's out of business. So chewy, so delicious. All the flavor (if not more) of a brownie without the mess. These, i think are healthier than brownies too. Anyway, I’ll shut up now so you can try this recipe, but you'll love them. Really.

Wow! These are to die for! If you are not a richchocolate fan, these are not for you. They are a mess to make as they get your hands pretty dirty but WELL worth it! 9 minutes was the perfect baking time. Make sure to let them sit a few minutes before removing from the pans. For the people who thought they were dry, you may have over-baked them. Mine were still soft in the middle the next day without putting them in a container.

This cookie recipe was a great failure.
Expensive to make, time consuming,and the cookies hardened by the next day to a tooth breaking status~~in an air tight container. I have made cookies forever and this was disappointing.

Excellent, I suggest dusting your hands with powdered sugar before rolling dough into balls. This is my favorite cookie. If I could have 1 type of cookie for the rest of my life, this is it! Yum!

A frustrating experience, I have to say.  The "dough" was more like a batter, and I wondered.  It DID firm up a lot when chilled but it was so sticky to handle.  Had to wet my hands to roll them.  First batch wound up in the garbage.  They were totally gooey (perhaps undercooked) having baked 10 min.  I figured they would firm as they cooled.  They didn't.  Wish this recipe would state how to know when they are fully cooked/done.  You can't see any browning due to the dark color of the batter.  Second batch, baked for 13 minutes was better, but still, they came out so thick and gooey in the center as to not be very enjoyable.  Too bad.  I had hopes.  Expensive failure, too.

Wow! were these rich!  I wondered why they were made so small until I tried one.  Very good, but very rich.  As my husband said, "You wouldn't want to grab a handful of these."

I tripled the recipe and cookies were still gone in a couple days. Net time I will have to hide some!!!
 In half the cookies I substituted orange for vanilla extract, added two tbs. fresh orange and fresh (dried would work also) grated orange zest. The chocolate/orange in my house were more popular than the plain orange!!!!
 I am sorry that I can only give this recipe 5 stars!!!

12/26/14 These are a chocolate-lover's dream come true!  Bursting with chocolatey gooeyness.  They are so decadent.  Before folding in the last cup of chocolate chips, I divided the batter in two bowls and then folded in bittersweet chocolate chips in one batch and white chocolate chips in the other.  I was going to drizzle more chocolate on top, but they came out of the oven with a gorgeous glossy crust.  
We used a cookie scoop to portion these out, and baked them for 9 minutes.  Delicious! 
Thank you Kevin for sharing!
Updated 12/23/18 Instead of unsweetened chocolate and semisweet chocolate, we used only Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips (melting in a medium-sized pot).

Can you say YUM?! If you like chocolate you will love these. It is very important not to over-bake. I would cook for 9 min and then let rest on the pan for another 5. I did freeze the batter for a couple of hours. A bit hard to get out of the bowl, but worth it. I used a small cookie scoop. These cookies keep their shape and don't run if you freeze the batter. No need to change the recipe. It's wonderful. The only thing I did on the second batch was add a little salt on top. If you like salt and chocolate this is AMAZING! I will use this recipe again and again.

These were heavenly!  They are my new favorite cookie.  Best when eaten out of the oven warm.  I did make a few changes, which were I used dark chocolate (60%) baking squares instead of the regular, I also subbed chocolate chips for chopped up dark chocolate peices!  These are very rich, creamy and melt in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing!

The best christmas cookie I made this year and the absolute hit of every christmas party I took them to! I took them out of the oven before they looked completly done and the middles stayed nice and gooey just like a truffle. Delicious!

the cookies were heavenly, only not too pretty: I had almost a sheet cake, with a brownie consistency. but we didn't care, my hubby had a raptus and devoured them... maybe I should have left them into the freezer longer?

Great cookie, easy to make...sooooo chocolately.  Replaced last addition of chocolate chips with 1/2 cup Andes mint baking pieces...amazing!  Chilled the dough overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes and it was the right consistency to form the dough into balls.

Instead of adding the half cup I put in a couple extra tablespoons of flour. Just a half cup will leave your cookies as flat as paper and you'll be spending the entire time scraping cookies from your sheet that's not worth eating. I always used to have that problem whem baking cookies. Other than that they look and taste wonderful!

Very, very good.  I love these cookies.  They taste great without rolling them in confectioner sugar, and just a little bit sweeter with.  I am going to make these again and next time I am going to put some coffee in the mix.  They are wonderful.

Changes I made, since I use what I have on hand: used 1 bar very good bittersweet chocolate. & 1 bar of Lindt 70% cocoa, all cut into chip-sized chunks  & 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Also, the cocoa was sweetened.  I added probably 1 TB or 2 extra of sugar to make up for it.  I had NO problem with the cookies not being sweet enough.  Very indulgent & very good.  Has wonderful chocolate taste, unlike most "chocolate" cookies without much flavor.  Even altered, I wouldn't hesitate to gift these! Yum.  Also, the crackle was just like the picture.  Perfect.  Very pretty.

I don't understand why people are having trouble, some rolling the cookies, others saying it is the consistency of cake batter and some saying they spread too much. I had no trouble scooping the dough after being in the refrigerator for exactly 1 hour. The consistency was perfect for scooping and they barely spread, resulting in a nicely domed round little cookie. They are very chocolatey and taste just like truffles, a bit crispy on the outside with a fudgey center.

This is a wonderful rich recipe.  I've received many compliments on it when I brought it to work.

I recommend using mini chocolate chips (at least for the second half that goes into the batter).

I saw a similar recipe in a magazine that used chopped up black walnuts in lieu of the second cup of chocolate chips; and it dipped the cookies in powdered sugar before putting them on the baking sheet.  It gives them a nice looking coating.

Yum.....just yum!  Only change was to use mini-chocolate chips for the 1 cup that you stir into the dough at the end.  I refrigerated overnight, and if you do that I also recommend letting it warm up for a few minutes, as the dough was like a big hunk of hardened fudge at first, and a little sticky. Unbelievable chocolate flavor!  This one is definitely a keeper!

If you like chocolate these are for you. The prep & ball rolling is a 1 star, but the taste is 5. These are worth the trouble, but for something special. Hubby made the dough & I rolled the next day to bake so that helped.

Wonderfully RICH!!! True chocaholics will adore these with a nice cold glass of milk!!!!! Used 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips when melting as my family loves the taste of dark chocolate chips most. When following the directions, the cookies came out dense, rich and very chocolately!! A keeper!!

The cookies are unbelievable!  I would honestly say these are the best cookies I have EVER had.  I am a total chocaholic though.  The cookies were very moist, rich, with just the right amount of sweetness.

WOW!!!! Never had a cookie this good in my life.  Eating the uncooked dough was really like eating truffles.  The cookies were soft and melted in my mouth.  Took them to the hospital to deliver my baby and the nurses were begging to be my nurse so I would share with them.  #1 of all time.

I love anything chocolate, but was not impressed by these.  They were unpleasant and messy to shape.  They do not take a nice form when baking and I was very disappointed with the texture and taste of the final product.  My husband likes everything I bake and I have a great deal of experience, but he did not like these at all.  

Very disappointing and will not make again.

YUMMY!!!!!
these are so fantabulous, if you love chocolate and don't want to go over board these will definately satisfy that craving. Only thing I had issues with is putting it in the fridge, I left it there for a few hours and when I went to roll them up they were really hard, I would say just leave it on the counter to cool

These cookies turned out completely flat. They had a very good flavor but we just had to eat crumbs scraped off the pan. I followed the recipe exactly. They are expensive and time consuming. I will probably try them one more time with shortening instead of butter to see if that helps the flatness.

I was very excited about making these for all my chocoholics, but they came out quite dry and I did not care for the taste at all.  Most liked them, just said they were dry.  Will try again, with shorter baking time. Personally, I can take or leave chocolate, so perhaps that's why I didn't care for them myself.  Thanks for the recipe though!

Very good.  Quite a bit of work for a cookie.  Tastes a lot like brownies and has same texture.  My family would like me to make again.  I'm not sure it's worth the work though.

Excellent.  I found that I needed to make the balls slightly larger than 1" size to get the 36 cookies that the recipe states, but they turned out very well no matter whether I made them tiny or very large.

Wow, non-chocoholics need not apply.  These will satisfy any chocolate craving out there...so decadent and rich.  I also rolled these in powdered sugar before baking, but didn't like the result;  they are such moist cookies, the sugar tends to seep in and yellow.  I dusted them afterwards and they looked great.  Next time I'll try to smoosh them a little before baking so they look less like rocks, but no matter the shape, the taste is spectacular!  I think I'll try them as a brownie/bar cookie too.  Thanks

These were delicious and decadent! I substituted the unsweetened chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips with all 72% chocolate, since I didn't have the others (I omitted the extra chocolate chips, they were just as good without them). For a full recipe that would be 10 ounces of dark chocolate.  I also reduced the sugar a little due to the change in chocolate, but it wasn't too sweet so that is optional, since it had a really dark chocolate flavor.  I also added about 1 Tbs. of prepared coffee for a full recipe. With that I added the same amount of cocoa powder ratio to coffee to balance out the extra liquid.

Excellent cookie!  True chocolate flavor!  I am so glad that I tried these when I thought my Christmas cookie plate needed something a bit darker visual effect.  Be careful not to over bake, as the soft, fudgey texture is part of what makes these so special.  I might try adding a tablespoon of instant  coffee with the dry ingredients next time, just to see what happens.

Aiyiyi are these chocolatey!  True to the description, for sure!  I inadvertently left out the vanilla, and they still turned out great.  For high elevation adjustment, I increased flour to just under 3/4 cup.  Since they came out fine without the vanilla, I think the only thing I'd try differently next time (though, I can't imagine "needing" a chocolate fix ever again after making these), would be to try using brandy instead of the vanilla.  Oh - and the dough was pretty gooey even after chilling, so I used a Pampered Chef medium cookie scoop to make the rounds to bake.

So, so, so good!  These are super easy and are excellent even when they're not warm.  I never let the chocolate cool; just cook it on low or 2 on the stove for a long time, and add it to the batter right away. So gooey in the middle, just awesome!!!

Really great and easy (as long as your boyfriend doesn't turn your oven up to 360 in a misguided attempt to help!).  For my second batch, I ran out of Vanilla extract, and replaced 1/2 tsp of that with almond extract.  Wasn't sure if the flavors would mesh, but they did quite well.  Tasty!

Decadent cookie that is true to it's name and description. VERY fudgy and rich. Do not overbake these, and make sure you let them cool completely, as the recipe directs, before transferring to wire rack.

Get the milk out! These are VERY rich. The texture is very gooey in the middle. This is almost like a brownie in cookie form. I like these, but I don't LOVE them and doubt I'll be making again. To me they were a bit too bittersweet. I love chocolate and I love sweet, but the bitter part I can do without.Also, mine were quite ugly. They didn't crackle on top like others (I left in for the correct time).

HOLY COW!  That was my reaction the first time I bit into one of these cookies.  I can not begin to tell you the accolades I have received over these little gems.  Rich, chewy, chocolate-y; these cookies are amazing.  I will definitely be making these a lot more often!  Thanks for one of the best recipes I have ever tried!

These cookies are AMAZING... everyone who tried them loved them and it seems I will be making them again and again. They're incredibly chocolately (perfect PMS fix).  The dough was hard to handle even after refrigeration so I lightly covered my hands in confectioners sugar in between rolling them and that helped enormously to shape them.

These cookies are spectacular! I live at a high altitude, so I had to do a little adjusting. I added a little more flour (about 2-3 Tbsp.), set the oven for 325*, & lengthened the baking time to about 13-14 minutes. Also, I did not have enough semi-sweet chocolate chips (to fold in at the end), so I used a combination of milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. They were SO good, I had a hard time letting them cool before my husband and children tried to devour them! This is going to make a wonderful addition to the cookies I bake to give to my friends this year. They almost melt in your mouth ~ MMMMMMM

These are one of my favorite cookies with a few changes....First, I had to set the oven temp lower so as not to burn the bottom, next I use parchament paper on the cookie sheet.  I use 1/4 cup less sugar then called for and use dark chocolate powder, rather then regular cocoa - this gives my cookies more of a bitter sweet taste.  I refrigerate over night and use a cookie scoop since these get very tacky.  They are definitely better then day after baking and I dust with powder sugar for presentation.  Great cookies for your holiday cookie tray!

Great cookies - make sure you don't bake them on a dark cookie sheet or they will burn. I used foil to line the baking sheets after the first batch and that worked fine.

I've been making these for years and have never had the problems the negative reviews mention.  They are a bit labor intensive, but so worth it.  You NEED to refrigerate the dough - I do it over night.  If it's too hard, let it soften SLIGHTLY at room temp, just to get it pliable.  It needs the chill time to absorb the flour and to become rollable.  I tried not rolling once, mistake.  They shape better if you roll them - it keeps it tight and moist.  Otherwise, the spreading it weird.  I use a disher (small ice cream scoop like thing) to get the dough out and then roll it between my palms, much easier to get it out while still cold enough with the disher.  I make these every year and always have to at least double it - very rich and chocolaty.

Make sure to bake these on parchment paper.  Don't overbake. Let them cool for at least 5 minutes before removing from the sheet. The colder they are when you assemble them, the better they are to work with.  These are absolute 5 star cookies

These are decadent and delicious. I actually chilled for 2 days (not my plan but that's how it worked out.) Has to let warm up a bit because they were pretty hard to scoop. Wet hands when forming into balls, it prevents sticking to your hands.

Every year we try a couple new cookie recipes over the holidays, This one has been a huge hit! Easy to make and gobbled up as soon as they cool from baking. We are now doubling and tripling the recipe to keep up with demand.

I've made these at Christmastime for many years and they are always a favorite, exactly as written!  They are easy to make and always turn out perfect, so chocolatey and decadent.  *I saw the negative review about these getting hard on the counter, which made me chuckle since, in my experience, ALL homemade cookies get stale and hard on the counter.  I store them in the fridge or freezer, but if you have to keep them on the counter, put a slice of bread in with them (the bread will get hard but the cookies will stay soft).

This might be the best cookie recipe I've ever tried.  I made some modifications for taste and the holidays.  I used the Nestle mint/chocolate chips, half semi-sweet/half unsweetened baking squares, and doubled the flour.  I put my covered bowl out in the snow for about 20 minutes, rolled the dough into little balls, baked for 9 minutes exactly and WAHLAH!  These taste like soft, fluffy Thin Mints.  Now I'm making a batch of 10 dozen for a cookie exchange!  **NOTE: my recipe modifications with more flour only yielded 31 cookies and the balls are very small.  If you need exactly 3 dozen, you'll need to beef up the quantities.

I made these for myself and a group of my friends:  they were a hit!  I will echo the sentiment that these are only for the serious chocolate lover.  They are so rich....mmmmmmmmm.  The only change I made to the recipe was to sub Earth Balance for butter to make them dairy free.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

Wow. Chewy, very chocolatey goodness! I saw a review that recommended keeping your hands wet (with cold water) to minimize the mess while forming the balls and found that to be helpful. I baked them for 9 minutes, until puffed and they are perfect.

very chocolatey! simple recipe, no problems baking, etc.  probably won't be making them too much though because - the excessive amount of chocolate is pricey & honestly too much chocolate for the tastes in our house.  definitely would be a great dessert to take away or make for company!

These cookies are the BOMB.  Everytime I make them, they magically disappear.  Worth the effort to make them.  My friends at work are devouring them as I type this.  I don't change a thing in the recipe - they come out perfect every time.

Our local ice cream shop has a flavor called Death by Chocolate.  I think these cookies taste a lot like that.  We love them.  Dough was really sticky, but after I refrigerated it was like fudge.  I used a cookie scoop and that worked fine.  They are delicious!

OMG, If I could give these more stars, I would!!!   I LOVE chocolate and these are possibly the BEST chocolate cookies I've ever had.  They are VERY rich and stay nice and soft.  They were a huge hit!

**I did not have any semi sweet chocolate chips on hand, so I used 6 semi sweet baking squares(equals 1 cup of chips) and used the remaining two squares(I chopped them up) in place of the additional cup of chips called for at the end of the recipe and they came out so delicious this way too!!!

Very rich, chocolate bites of deliciousness!!!!   YUMMMM!!!!!

These are very good. I like to add peppermint extract and have also tried them with pecans, which I didn't really like but can't really explain why. I like them straight from the refrigerator rather than at room temperature or warm. When I read the many reviews exclaiming how chocolatey these were I thought people were simply stating the obvious but it's difficult to explain why they're so rich, maybe because there's not as much sugar to balance the bitterness of the chocolate as in most recipes. The last time I made these I had to substitute unsweetened chocolate for the semisweet and I simply added more sugar. I didn't add the chips in at the end, either, and they turned out fine. Two important rules, both of which have been stated in many reviews but I must say once more- use parchment paper (or silicone) and do not overcook them. If you feel they are too raw after they have cooled you can always cook them a little more but once they're overcooked the only thing that i find sometimes improves them is refrigeration. I cook them for about 8 to 9 minutes, let sit for 2 or 3, then move them to wire racks. If they are perfectly cooked, they will stick a tiny bit at first but will move all in one piece to the rack. If they are overcooked they will move easily but will be a little dry- still delicious either way! I would love to try these crumbled over ice cream.

These were alright.  The kids and husband liked them more than I did.  They are definitely a rich cookie.  I made exactly according to recipe but rolled half of the bach in powdered sugar before baking.  They look and smell so yummy while cooking.  For me, as a personaly preference, they were just too rich.  Not anything wrong with the recipe, just my taste!!  By the way, had no problems with the dough either!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought that these were extremely good and well worth making if you are a chocoholic! My husband thinks they are especially good when eaten warm. 

My only recommendation would be to pour the dough onto saran wrap and roll into a log for refrigeration. Once refrigerated, you can cut the dough into coins which will make it look nicer when baked.

I'm giving this 4 stars since my coworkers seemed to love them.  I wasn't quite as impressed.  I'm a major chocoholic, but after they were completely cool, to me they almost tasted a little bitter.  Maybe I'll try semi-sweet squares instead if I make them again.  I didn't have cocoa powder (well I did but it expired in 2004 so I thought I probably shouldn't use it!), so I added an extra square of unsweetened chocolate and a tablespoon extra flour.  I had thin brownie batter at this point.  I figured there was no way I would be able to make cookies with that even after refrigerating so I ended up adding 3 more tablespoons of flour.  Before refrigerating it was pretty much brownie batter consistency.  I refrigerated it over an hour, and boy did it thicken up!  I had no problems forming the cookies.  I added peanut butter chips to some (I liked those best) and chopped up Andes mints to some.  I baked them 8 minutes and moved them to a wire rack after about 1 minute.  Overall they apparently turned out good since I got rave reviews.  They just weren't my favorite.

these did taste nice, however mine turned out nothing like the picture. after hours in the fridge the batter was thick enough to role in balls but as soon as they went in the oven they spread out so far and so thin they made one very thin but huge cookie.

OMG! Probably the best tasting cookie ever and I am a cookie SNOB! I never eat the dough but this is the exception! WOW! One of my top 5 cookies now. The only recommendations I have for this recipe are:
1. Use a good quality chocolate, it will be worth it.
2. Double the recipe otherwise you will be back in the kitchen wishing you did the first time!

I made these for my co-workers and they didn't even last 10 minutes. Everyone was raving about them and wanted the recipe. One thing I've notice with all the reviews, everyone's topping them with more sugar. I'm not sure if it's for everyone but chocolate and salt are an amazing combination. When I made mine, I used a really good quality bittersweet chocolate and sprinlked them with a nice coarse Kosher salt right when I removed them from the oven. OMG! So much better then just on their own!

These cookies are a chocolate lovers dream and perfect for Valentine's Day.  I used the ingredients exactly as written.  A small ice cream scoop is perfect for making the balls as the dough is rather sticky. I flattened them just slightly and baked for 9 minutes.  Perfection...these are definitely a keeper.

These are delicious, but DON'T REFRIGERATE overnite as it suggests....but the one hour chill would be okay to thicked for scooping onto a pan. I have very sore hands from all the digging after leaving overnight (I and I double the recipe!) OUCH! lol

Very dark chocolate--made with M&M's and semisweet chips and were SO decadent. Would also be good with chopped nuts either in the batter or on top.

These cookies are blah, to me, but my husband thinks they are BLING, and they will probably be popular around the neighborhood!   That will save me some calories!  These are soft and have no texture.  I prefer the crackled chocolate cookie recipe I've used for years, which makes a chewy cookie.

Amazing! Very moist and almost taste like truffles but they're a little more cookie like. So rich! Must have with milk! Yum! I used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semi sweet in the batter and it was pretty good. Hubby liked the bittersweet.

Oh so sinfully delicious.  I didn't have enough semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used a combination of those plus milk chocolate and dark chocolate - how can you go wrong with chocolate right?.  I made the balls almost exactly one inch and set apart 2 in as noted.  These came out perfect - I do use an oven thermometer and suspect that some of the ovens where these were too thin may have been hotter than needed.  Also used parchment paper (which is reusable) - I never grease pans. A repeat for sure!  These were so popular over the Christmas holidays, but maybe too intense for little ones.  A definate adult treat!

Took these to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone couldn't stop eating them..  They want me to make them for Christmas now.  But I must say they are a mess when you are rolling into balls.  The dough totally sticks to your hands.

Decadent! Most people can only eat one, but I can definitely go for two with milk. :) My best friend said it was like a mini chocolate lava cake that would be perfect hot with ice cream! This has to be my favorite cookie of all time since I'm a chocolate lover! I refrigerated them for a few days. They were hard to scoop out, but I used an ice cream scooper, rolled them into 1.5 in. balls and cooked them for about 12 minutes. Fabulous!!

Hubby says "best cookie he's ever had" ...he's had many & adores dark chocolate.  To solve crumbling that many complain of, just use baking SODA vs powder.  Done this with other cookie recipes that call for powder vs soda (not many do).  To avoid mess, just used (generous) COOKIE SCOOP (with built in scraper) vs. rolling into balls.  Baked nicely shaped.  Used salted butter, so omitted salt.  B/c of what was on hand, used 8oz of 72-86% choc bars (that needed used up) vs 4oz unsweetened & 1c semis.  Also used mini chips for mix in vs regular sized chips.  Tasty!!  Would suggest pure vanilla (used madagascar bourbon vanilla) in all recipes over imitation.  No problem getting off sprayed cookie sheet.

These cookies are the ultimate "chocolate fix"!!   I made them exactly how the recipe is written.  Leaving them in the fridge for an hour was enough to be able to handle them.  I will definitely be making these again!  I'm thinking of using peanut butter chips for the 2nd cup of chips next time.

the best chocolate fudge cookies. batter tastes just like brownie batter, so I bet would taste great as brownies as well. when I first made these, I did not have bakers chocolate on hand, so on the heels of another's review that it worked okay with additional chocolate chips, I tried that. They came out really good, but when I made them the next time, I really saw the difference in using the bakers chocolate and TOTALLY worth the trip to the grocery store for it. They set much better and taste more triple chocolatey and less bitter-sweet, if that makes any sense. Also, roll them in powdered sugar for a beautiful look! I cannot wait to try the other suggestions of peanut butter, white chocolate or butterscotch chips!

Super yummy! The dough is just as good to eat as the cookie itself! The dough tastes like truffle filling. I used white chocolate chips and semi-sweet, it was an awsome contrast. Watch the cookies, they over bake really quickly as I discovered.

These cookies rock. But make sure you use a good quality chocolate like  guitard. It makes a difference.

While I am a true chocolate lover these were a little too much for me. I think next time I will use less chocolate in the mix and add fewer chocolate chips and a bit more sugar.....they tasted more like the bitter or unsweetened baking chocolate than I like. I will also make a point to buy better quality chocolate for the next try. The texture was great though!

Yummy, fudgy chocolate drops from heaven.    I rolled some of the batch in chopped pecans before baking.  Pretty, easy, and super yummy.

Delicious! Made them exactly as per recipe. Batter is very gooey and brownie-like immediately after mixing- I chilled overnight in fridge, which made the batter much easier to roll into balls. Had to bake about 15 minutes due to chilled batter, but they came out great!

Love, love, love these cookies!  They really do sort of melt in your mouth.  I followed the recipe as written and baked them 9 and 1/2 minutes.  After they cooled a bit I rolled them in powdered sugar.  Delicious with a glass of cold milk.  I will add that I think the amount of time I baked them might be considered slightly underdone by some people.  They still look pretty soft when I take them out of the oven, but do firm up a bit.  I always underbake my cookies by 30 to 60 seconds and I think that is what contributes to their softness, and with this particular cookie, to its 'melt in your mouth' quality.  Highly recommended!

Followed the recipe exactly.  These chocolate cookies are TOO chocolatly, if that's possible.  They are very crumbly and do not hold together well at all, despite varying the cook time on each batch to compensate.

Made these for mothers day.  I had problems with having the dough to hard to scoop out of bowl but left dough in for about 24 hours.  They are really good but  I would recommed only for true chocolate lovers and have a glass of milk near by.

We all liked these.  Be sure not to over bake them.  When they first come out they look a bit underbaked but firm up nicely.

Loved these cookies, as did the recipient. I added about half a tablespoon of instant coffee to the butter/ chocolate mixture to give bring out the chocolate flavor. The dough looks nothing at all like cookie dough before you chill it. It looked more like cake batter to me. Once it was chilled it was fine, but I still found this recipe a little more challenging to roll into balls than others, probably because of the small amount of flour. Loved them though. Used chocolate chunks instead of the chips.

honestly i was a bit afraid to make these because of some of the reviews i read but some of the reviews made them sound too good to pass up. After mixing up the recipe, I divided up the dough into 2 containers so i would only have to get out half at a time when baking. I left the dough in the refrig for over 24 hours. Used a cookie scoop to make balls. The dough gave me no trouble at all. The cookies turned out cute and really yummy! (For the 2nd cup of chips I used milk chocolate chips.)

These are very, very good.  However, the tackiness of the dough to get it into balls is enough to give me pause about making them again.  I probably licked enough chocolate off my fingers at the end of each set to make at least one more cookie (not that that's a bad thing!). There were mixed reviews here on what it took to overcome this problem. I chilled the dough for 3 hours to start with.  I only got 12 cookies in at a time and had to re-chill the dough after rolling out each set.  Even though the dough was "spikey" going into the oven, they did come out just fine when cooked.  Like others, I let these sit and cool on the cookie sheet until they were easy to remove (about 12-15 minutes) then I let them cool completely on a rack before bagging them up for gifts. The dough is just as delicious as the baked cookie! Thank you for posting the tasty treat.

Very nice taste but mine looked ugly. It spread a lot from 1 inch ball to 3 inch (or more) round flattened cookies. I did chilled the dough over night. But it was spreading once put in the oven. And the cookies was very fragile. Far away from the pics.

These came out perfectly. I made these cookies (among other thing's) for Christmas and they were gone within minutes, literally. The flavour and texture were perfect. I recommend lightly dusting these cookies with icing sugar for that final touch.

These cookies are simply amazing.  I took them to our Bible study two weeks ago and *everyone* asked for the recipe.  They are soooo chocolatey and rich -- you really can only eat one or two.  I will add to the chorus that chilling the dough is imperative.  Even after putting it in our deep freeze for a couple of hours it was still like spooning gelato on to the cookie sheet.  Overnight in the fridge would have been better.   I will definitely make these cookies again.

This was a tricky recipe. Dough was sticky even after chilling overnight. The first tray I undercooked a bit - and I was convinced I'd never makes these again. The second tray I left in the oven a bit longer (total 10 minutes). I let them cool completely on the tray and they came out so much better. A very flat cookie - kind of runny in the oven - but yummy none the less. Might make these again, put a little espresso powder in with the dry ingredients and freeze the balls of cookie dough before putting in the oven.

This recipe is great, albeit a bit too chocolatey (weird coming from a chocoholic like me).  Next time, I might sub milk chocolate chips for the 1 cup semisweet chips stirred in at the end.  Rolled mine in powdered sugar before baking to try and offset the slight bitterness, and they look gorgeous.

Also, for those with spreading issues, it's a must with this or ANY cookie recipe to chill the dough overnight!  And bake on parchment-lined cookie sheets.  I've always had picture-perfect results with the chilled dough and parchment, even in my terrible electric oven.

VERY good. I personally love it, but for a younger crowd I would switch the 4 squares unsweetened chocolate to 1. I did this (by accident!) the first time I made them, and they received great reviews from the younger kids, but they are really just like any chocolate cookie this way. With the 4 squares, they are more for an older crowd. They aren't as sweet, but they taste INCREDIBLE! Definitely for any true chocoholic! I personally like them a lot better the way the recipe was written, but if you're cooking for kids you might want to try with 1 square.

These are AWESOME!!!  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and chilled overnight.  They are the best chocolate cookies that I've ever made.  They are very tasty but not so rich that you can't eat a couple and they are soft like fudge.  Thanks for this recipe!!

CAUTION! this is a HIGHLY addicting and DELICIOUS cookie. the best double chocolate cookies i have ever made and or tasted. if you are in the mood for some intense chocolate this is the recipe for you. these cookies have a fudge like consistency and also reminiscent of brownies. i used bittersweet baking chocolate for a twist, they came out great.

I made these for an office potluck and they were a big hit!  They are VERY rich, one or two will do ya. Good with a glass of milk.

I didn't refrigerate mine for a whole hour - I put them in the freezer for 30 minutes and that seemed to work. 

YUM!

Wow!  Just the way I love a chocolate cookie--fudgy, mildly dense, and very strongly chocolate.  Yum!

These cookies are really good. At first i didn't understand why you had to leave them overnight in the refrigerator; but that is really useful. When i took my cookie dough out of the fridge it was really hard to work with, but 30 minutes later it was in the right consistency to work with. Also wanted to especify: 6 tablespoons equals 3 ounces, that way it's easier to understand; i believe. I still can't believe how gorgeous these cookies are, i imagine they would be a total success when entertaning or in company. I made them really small and got like 95-100 cookies or so. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

These taste best when cooled.  Not your typical cookie that tastes the best right out of the oven.  They were almost pasty when still hot.  Anyways, I froze some of the cookie batter, already rolled flattened a bit with a fork, and today i baked them for 12 minutes - and they still tasted great, with a little bit of a crisp to the edges than the fresh batter batch.

These were delicious! I thought they were very chocolatey but true chocaholics love them. I took them to work and the people were drooling over them. I didn't roll them in powdered sugar before, but sprinkled them after. I didn't change a single thing, and I baked them for 10 minutes exactly. They were perfect!

These were very rich, and they spread out a lot when cooked, so i used much smaller balls to make a normal-sized cookie!Mine were pretty flat-was this supposed to happen? Still edible though, a bit too sweet for me but my chocolate-lover family enjoyed them!

I'd give it ten stars for flavor, but I may have goofed in the ingredients. I used chips instead of chocolate squares, and the cookies took longer to bake than the time mentioned - some stayed gooey. Also, I had trouble getting some of them off the cookie sheet, and they got rumpled up. But it'll give me an excuse to try again with unsweetened squares instead of chips. The taste, however, is absolutely out of this world!!!! No such thing as too much chocolate!:-)

These are like little brownie bites. I accidentally doubled the amount of cocoa and flour in the recipe so I think the cookies would have spread out more than they did, but they got the same flakey top that a brownie gets after it bakes, and it had such a strong chocolate taste that it was almost really too much...like you needed a glass of milk to swallow. I loved them.

This cookie was just absolutely awesome. So dark and soft. just amazing. Didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so substituted that with some vegetable oil and more cocoa powder. Still came out great.

These remind me of a Fudge Brownie recipe from an old cookbook my gramma gave me... except the brownie recipe is much less involved and requires less ingredients. 
    I think I'll stick to the brownies next time. 
    A fun experience, however. And tasty.

This is an excellent cookie, I did ues a bit more peanut butter and flour, about 1/2 cup each. Also on half of these I made thumbprints instead of using the fork and put some strawberry jam on them. they were delicious

So easy to make, my six-year-old practically did it all himself. We also rolled them in powdered sugar and I drew a heart shape in vanilla icing, which made them a little too sweet. They were delicious, a hit with the grade one class we served them to. Only four stars because my husband (the junkfood junkie of the house) didn't like them.

I thought these cookies were very good, but they were a lot of work to make.  they tasted an awful lot like brownies, so I figure that I could have made a box of brownies and saved myself all the work.  They were good though, I would recomend them if you don't mind spending a lot of time on them.

I, too, used a 2 tbsp scoop for these delicious cookies (12-13 min does the trick).  To make them a little sweeter, I used Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate & Cocoa instead of plain old unsweetened cocoa. Made a big difference. I'm also thinking of using peanut butter chips next time.

I know this is bad, but I actually didn't think these were sweet enough...they tasted like brownies in cookie form, but a little more bitter.  However, my mom liked them, so maybe it just depends on age.

I had the most rave reviews EVER the very first time I made these cookies last February!  They are only for chocolate lovers because the result is incredibly rich and delicious.  It's a good thing the cookies themselves are small because you don't need many to be satisfied.

I have since made them two more times and have some tips to pass on.  The dough is extremely sticky so the first time I tried this recipe, I had a bowl of cold water to dip my fingers into to make the dough easier to work with. For my latest two batches, I used a small 1-1/2 inch scoop, kind of like an ice cream scoop but smaller, that has a curved piece that scrapes the dough ball out of the scooper. I dip it in cold water after every two dough balls and it's made my life so much easier.  I highly recommend getting one if you think you will make these cookies more than once.

Also, for one of my batches I used salted caramel chips for the last cup (the unmelted ones) instead of chocolate chips and the results were amazing.

I made this recipe and wondered at first if I was going to have to throw it all out?  
The key step is to let the mix chill in the fridge for at least an hour.  When you bring it out it can be rolled our scooped with a #40 scoop.  I used parchment paper for easy clean up.  
The chilled dough is good enough to eat and could be used as a base for a cheesecake, without baking it... or a peanut butter pie, think of the possibilities?  Back to the cookies.... 
The baked product is very moist in the center, some might say not cooked/raw, however it leaves them with a creamy texture with super chocolate flavor which could become a sweet treat addiction!
I replaced the sugar for Splenda and they turned out fantastic.
UPDATE:  Made this in an 8" x 8" pan  and cut into squares-by far some of the best brownies I have made.  Took a container to work and shared with the cast...they came back for seconds and in some cases, thirds!

Delicious! I didn't add the 2 T of baking cocoa as I was making them as a gift for my mom who prefers milk chocolate and I didn't want them TOO too dark chocolate-y. They were still fantastic! My husband wants me to add a little coffee next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for chocolate lava cake until I realized I didn't have a ramekin, so I decided to settle for chocolate cookies. This definitely was NOT settling. These cookies taste just like a mini chocolate lava cake and they were a big hit with my friends. These were pretty easy and I will definitely be making them again.

These are truly decadent.  Wonder of wonders-I brought them to a family get together, and my mother demanded the recipe.  If you need a chocolate cookie to round out an assortment, these are fab.  If you just need a death-by-chocolate fix, these are your cookies.  To make the struggle with the richness of the dough somewhat smoother, definitely chill it down.  And I use a small cookie scooper to make it easier to get dough to baking sheet without so much sticking to my palms.

This is by far one of THE best cookies I have ever made. I left it in the fridge overnight and used a 2T scope. ( made 20 cookies ) It's a very firm dough, hang in there, you will not be disappointed. I baked it @ 350 for 13 minutes. Perfect.

As per my sister these taste like brownies! A+ she says. 
I should have read the receipt all the way through and left the batter in the fridge overnight. 1 hour was not long enough the dough was hard to work with. 

I will make this again!!! Thank you.

Let me first say that yes, I am a chocoholic and so is everyone in my family.  We LOVED these cookies.  I made a half recipe because I wasn't sure how they'd turn out, but they were perfect.  It made 30 small cookies and we ate 20 of them!  I followed the directions exactly and cooked 9 minutes and let them sit for 5.  We ate them still warm, and they were set on the outside and soft and gooey inside.  I did lightly spray the cookie sheet before baking and they came right off the tray.  Also I coated my hands with flour 2-3 times while rolling them to help with the stickiness.  This is a definite keeper for our family, though I think I may try almond or coffee flavor just to see what they are like.

I just made these, and they came out fantastic!  I bake a lot of cookies, so I suggest sticking to 9 mins for the time.  I substituted white chocolate chips for the second cup just for fun, and they were delicious!

These are soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Let the dough sit out for 15 minutes to make the dough a little more scoop able. I made the dough the night before and kept it in the refrigerator. I used a cookie scoop. Could have made them bigger though. They don't spread much so I got 24 on the baking sheet

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  Heavenly!  Thank you to the reviewer who suggested dipping your fingers in cold water before handling the dough, because otherwise it is a sticky mess!  These are SO yummy.  They remind me of the Otis Spunkmeyer (sp?) muffins.  SO rich and delicious!

Just a suggestion for bakers having a difficult time with spreading......never put your cookies on an already hot cookie sheet. This allows the fat in the recipe to have started to melt before it is put into the oven with the resulten spread in your baked cookie. Chilling too long is always better than not chilling long enough for ease in handling and perfect results.

Thanks Allrecipes! Looked online for a perfect chocolate cookie, and you had it! And it is exactly what I was looking for! I wanted a cookie with this texture, and moistness to make with a mint combination that my family loves.  I just added a bag of M&M's Mint candies, and it was a perfect combination!

This is the 2nd time I made these, they are so very delicious.  This time I decorated them Halloween style, fun!  The 2nd cup of chocolate chips at the end, I used a a mix of semi-sweet chips and orange colored chips to make it more Halloween-y. A couple of tips...Make sure the chocolate that you've melted is cooled before you add it to the bowl of other ingredients.  Make sure you keep the dough very cold and roll quickly.  It will help to cool your pan before the next batch as well.  Enjoy!

This is serious business here.  I'm not kidding!  My wife is the pickiest of pickies when it comes to chocolate.  I have tried more cookies than I can count, but none did anything for her....until I found this one.  I'm not a chocolate nut like her, but I love these too.  Better than just a cookie.  Light crispiness on the outside, and gooey goodness on the inside.  Making half the chocolate chips in this recipe the bittersweet (60% cacao) will melt the most passionate dark chocolate fan.  W-I-N-N-E-R!

Chocoholics rejoice! This is a fantastic super-chocolatey cookie! I refrigerated the dough overnight and found it rather difficult to work with in the morning. I ended up scooping out a tablespoon of the dough then rolling it between my hands. Very messy but effective. I would recommend making them bigger, more like 2 Tbsp of dough, and cooking them 9 minutes. They don't have to be done to be delicious. I will definitely be making these again!

Not sure what happened but my batter was the consistency of mayonnaise after being in the refrigerator for 4 hours.  Cookies really spread out but they were yummy.  Put dough (batter) in freezer and had better luck.  Two stars for the problems, four for the taste.

Absolutely divine! I got a ton of copliments on these cookies.

They do taste very similar to a chocolate truffle, but you also get the added texture of cookie.

I will be making these again very soon and continue to keep them in my rotation!

I haven't tasted these yet, I may change the star rating aftervI do but I must say so far I am not impressed. The recipe says refrigerate at least an hr up to overnight...other reviews said don't refrigerate overnight because the dough gets too hard so far  I have had the dough in the refrigerator for 3 hrs and it is still too soft to even think about rolling. I bake a lot and so far this is the only recipe I have had any issues with.

FANTASTIC! Best ooey-gooey chocolate cookie I have ever made/had. They have a thin flakey crust and the middle melts in your mouth. I ran out of cookie dough before I could try the dough with raspberry flavoring but there will be a next time!

This is definitely a chocolate-lover's cookie!  It's 5-stars as is.   I've also added bittersweet chocolate in place of the semi-sweet or in half and half proportions.  Tastes great with a demitasse coffee or a nice wine, as it's not too sweet.  LOVE THEM!

I made these with all Ghiradelli chocolate products and they are to die for! If you refrig over night, I would take the dough out for a little bit before you start as it gets very hard to scoop, it broke my cookie scoop. But I still give it 5 stars, a chocolate lover's dream!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies. I have made them for a few holiday parties and one of my friends liked them so much she requested that I make them for her birthday party.  I top them with powdered sugar and sometimes instead of the last 1 cup of chocolate chips, I used the chopped Andes candies to make them minty. SO GOOD! Definitely one of my favorite cookies, ever!

I made these exactly as written and they were wonderful! Mine looked just like the picture. The dough is too sticky to roll even when refrigerated so I just spoon dropped them. I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Wow! If you like chocolate, these are the cookies for you! I have made these cookies several times, and have consistently had very good results. On a few occasions, I have omitted the 1 cup of chocolate chips stirred in at the end, and the results are still delightful.

Of note, I believe that the step where the eggs are beaten is very important - that is what gives the cookies some of their volume. Otherwise, I think it would be difficult to mess these up!

These were not very cookie like and were very bitter, (and I really like dark chocolate), and not exceptionally easy to make. If you want really dark chocolate flavor... just eat your favorite dark chocolate.

Very good, chocolately cookies. I did half white and half milk chocolate chips because I was worried it would be a little too bitter with the semi sweet chips given the baking chocolate and cocoa powder in the batter. I will definitely make these again, they were a big hit with my husband and his friends that came over!

Good flavor,very "chocolatey", maybe too much for my taste.  My cookie didn't look like the picture, more flat for some reason.  Not sure I will make again.

Possibly the best cookie I've ever had- moist, fudgy, rich and satisfying!  I made one change due to my own ingredient availability- I used 3 oz. unsweet chocolate + 1 oz bittersweet, and tried to compensate by using just less than 1 cup of sugar.  Excellent recipe!

My family said these were the best. These were really fudgy or truffle like.  In my opinion they were doughy.  Im sure thats how they are suppose to be.  I made most of them as written and one batch over cooked.  I like my cookies chewy.  I did use some white chocolate chips.  Tastes great.

I expected great things from this recipe after reading the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, I found myself disappointed. Sure, the dough was extremely chocolatey, however, as a self-professed chocoholic, found myself wanting more. Additionally, the dough was much too difficult to handle.

Well, I'm going to ruin this cookie's almost flawless reputation. I didn't really like them, and I am 100% a chocolate over. I didn't really like the taste, nor the consistency-too mushy inside and too bitter-and I looove dark chocolate. I don't know-these cookies and I are not in love. Won't make again. And I wanted to loooove them. =(

We had these for dessert after Valentine's dinner. I served them warm with fresh raspberries, They were fabulous - slightly crisp outside and meltingly soft inside. I didn't change a thing! Will definitely make these again for special desserts.

Oh my.... these cookies are sooo delicious - great recipe, Kevin!  Instead of rolling the cookies into balls I just used my cookie scoop and they came out very nice.  (Less mess that way).  These are definately a "special occasion" cookie - very decadant.

I"m 64 and my recipe file only holds the best of the best. These cookies will STAY in my cookie file. They are light weight with chocolate pieces on the inside that make them seem fudgey  and just gourmet! They are as light as mashmellows also. I love these and my family as well loves them So very glad to have this recipe.  I suggest rolling them in powdered sugar before baking. Makes them wonderful and just beautiful with the chocolate and white cracks.

These cookies are great, so decadent. I used milk
chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. I gave a plate of them to my daughter and her roomates. 
They were a hit. Thanks.

These are delish!!  I found it easier to work with the dough when it has not been refrigerated.  I used a small spring loaded ice cream scooper instead of trying to roll it into a ball.

I personally loved this recipe very chocolately they almost taste like double chocolate fudge cookies. The only thing is I did have trouble with rolling them and I did just drop them onto my cookie sheet so they dont fully have the cracked look effect. But overall I give this 5 stars

These are so decadent! Wow! I followed the recipe as is, always do the first time around then I like to tweek it if need be. On one batch, I squeezed them into a small heart cookie cutter to shape them for my Valentines dessert and they came out nice. This is going to be in my recipe box forever.

Amazing! I wasn't sure if the insides were supposed to be as soft as they were, so I might bake them a little longer next time (I only put them in for 9 minutes)... However, there definitely WILL be a "next time" because these cookies are delicious!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made. The only substitution I made was, since I didn't have unsweetened chocolate on hand, I used regular milk chocolate and then halved the sugar. Only made about 20 cookies though, so next time I'll probably double the recipe. Thank you so much for this.

I have been visiting allrecipes for probably 10 years now, and this is the first recipe that I literally had to run to the computer to review.  This is, hands down, the best cookie I have ever made or eaten (and I have eaten and made a LOT of cookies!).  Mrs. Fields, eat your heart out! I typically prefer sugar cookies over chocolate, but these have converted me.  I followed the recipe without changing a thing, since all the reviews were positive.  I did opt to use the microwave rather than a double boiler to melt the chocolate, and it was way easier.  I put my dough in the fridge 1 hour, then froze 1 hour before scooping with a cookie dough scoop and rolling into balls. I covered my cookie sheet with parchment paper, which allowed them to slide right off after cooling a bit.  The cookies came out soft, dense, and beautiful.  I know I'm going to be asked for the recipe!

These turned out really good.  I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of mint flavor.  I used 2 squares of funsweetened chocolate and 2 squares of semi-sweet since that's what I had on hand.  I used mini chocolate chips.  I put cookie sheets in the freezer and coated my hands with powdered sugar and had no trouble rolling into balls.  Was messy but cookies set up nice!  I made them small (rolled 2 cookies from 1 tablespoon scoop of dough).

delicious! i like to use mini chocolate chips instead of full size ones because it adds more chocolate flavor without interrupting the decadent experience of this cookie by you noticing the chocolate chips- the cookies are definitely better than that chunk of plain chocolate that makes up a chocolate chip. if you can, use the best quality cocoa you can find - it makes a huge difference, but this cookie is delicious no matter what kind of cocoa you use.

Having read a large number of the many reviews and concluding that the recipe should definitely be made slightly sweeter and just ever-so-less rich ... I substituted 1/2 of the semisweet chocolate chips used in melting for 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips, in order to heighten the sweetness; I increased the amount of flour to 3/4 cup, omitted the 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder and, for the final step, substituted milk chocolate chips for the semisweet listed. I cooked each batch for exactly ten minutes, and each cookie came out perfectly! The consistency is somewhere in-between a brownie's and a cake's. While being rather chocolatey, they are not TOO rich or TOO sweet, though still maintaining a good level of both qualities—which I was going for. Overall, pretty  good.  Hope this helps.

So Good! I brought them to a family get together and every one LOVED them! You really have to be careful not to overbake. The cookie will still taste good, but it won't have that soft velvety truffle texture in the center. MMMM... can't wait to make these again.

Very rich and chocolatey. Make sure to let them cool completely (at least 3 hours) before eating if you want that truffle-like consistency. Otherwise they're just too messy.

WE loved these! If you like, truffles, brownies, and cookies.. these are for you.  I made the dough in the morning chilled all day, and they were dessert that night.  I used peanut butter chips, because I love that combo and they were super yum! Definitely cook them for 10 min, cool on pan at least 5.. then more on a rack.. they don't fall apart once cooled.

Wow! I just finished making my first batch of these.  They are very soft and rich!  I find the taste very similar to the brownie recipe found through the LCBO. If you have a chocolate craving and don't want to make a whole batch of brownies this is the recipe for you. Only possible flaw is that they are very crumbly so if you have kids be careful.

If you are a chocoholic you will love these!  I used Scharffen Berger unsweetened chocolate - expensive but worth it!  Followed the recipe exactly and they are to die for.  Be careful not to overcook and if you can stand it, let them cool before eating.  My husband claims these are the best cookies ever made!

Very good cookies!! The greatest I have made in a long time. I put pecan in some and they turned out good too. Taste just like Chewy Chocolate Supreme cookies from Great American Cookie Company. Will make again.     It took a little time to melt the chocolate and let the batter cool but soooo worth it!

VERY YUMMY! It was a nice change from always making chocolate chip. I think that next time I'll make them a little sweeter by using a little more of the chocolate chips and a little less of the unsweetened chocolate

SCRUMPTIOUS! Sooo chocolatey, these are simply fabulous. I didn't change a thing, and this recipe doesn't need it! I liked that it made as many as it said, also - a lot of cookie recipes tend to make fewer than they're supposed to. If you're debating about trying these out, debate no longer! They are WORTH it, trust me! They are also really quite quick to mix together, just plan ahead for the refrigeration time.

Wow! These turned out super fudgy and delicious! I ended up making 2 batches in 24 hours! I used German chocolate instead of unsweetened and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. (I didn't have the others on hand.) I also let the dough chill overnight. I think my family enjoyed the dough as much as they did the cookies! These are a definite keeper!!!

Rich and decadent, these cookies are for chocolate lovers only!  Instead of the vanilla I used a little over ¼ tsp. of Fiori Di Sicilia, a combination of citrus and vanilla.  Ordinarily I do not use it with chocolate, but it was wonderful in this cookie, making it even more of an adult delight.

Gone in an hour! It also got a "melted in my mouth" comment. =) I let the dough chill overnight and had to let it sit out a bit because it was too hard to scoop.

These cookies were amazing! I did modify it a bit though. I used all semi-sweet chocolate because I am cooking in Japan and can't find unsweetened baking chocolate. Other than that I followed the recipe and they turned out so well! I brought them in to my coworkers and they loved them. They are very rich, though, so keep that in mind.

I just made these for the first time. I chilled the dough overnight. The cookies did not spread like some have said, but were very thick and dense. The name does the cookie justice as the texture is smooth and the chocolaty taste is very rich. I love this cookie.

WOW!  Too bad no one could wait until these cookies cooled, because they were even better the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly, then added a container of mini peanut butter cup candies (about the size of chocolate chips) from Trader Joes.

Excellent!  Very rich but very good.  These were very easy to put together.  I had to bake my cookies for 13 minutes to get perfect results.  I will definitely be making these again.

My family went nuts over these cookies.  They were dekicious.  I did have to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe stated or else they wouldn't have set.   I'm sorry I gave up chocolate for Lent.  Now I'll have to wait 'til Easter to make them again.

These cookies are so good.  I have been searching for a recipe for a truffle cookie that tastes like the ones Mrs. Beasley's sells for $29.00 a dozen. This is just as good.  It is critical that you don't overbake them so I did have to experiment with the time in my convection oven.  These are going on my "Christmas cookie list" for sure.

These are so rich.  Not for those who don't love chocolate.  I used a small cookie dough scooper which helped keep my hands clean since the dough is quite sticky.

I created variations by rolling them in one of the following before baking: powdered sugar, or crushed almonds, or cinnamon for a Mexican kick. Took exactly 10 minutes to bake into fudgy deliciousness.

These were amazing! Very chocolate but not too sweet. I followed the recipe as is and didn't have any trouble. I did put the dough back in the fridge to keep it cold and firm while waiting on the batches that were cooking though. This is a new fave recipe!

These are the best chocolate cookies that I have ever made. The girls at work beg me to make them all the time.  Didn't change a thing , next time I may try peanut butter chips as the last ingredient instead of chocolate chips.

My sister and I make these cookies all the time! You really can't go wrong with this recipe, and they always turn out great. The only changes I make is omitting the salt, heating all chocolate using the microwave, and I don't chill the dough.

Now my favorite chocolate cookie!  It is one of the very few cookies that is equally good on the second day (if you can manage to hide some away).  I used milk chocolate chips as the last cup of chips for a my taste preference and only baked for 7 minutes.  Everyone raved about these.

These cookies are PHENOMENAL. They remind me of when you bite into something like a Lindt truffle when you break through the outside the inside is just rich and creamy. I was afraid that they hadn't set because even after I let them sit on the tray for 5 minutes the inside was still VERY creamy, so in a panic I put them in the fridge for about a half hour and when I took them out, they were just the BEST to bite into. Honestly warm or cool, these are delicious. Very much for the chocolate lover.

These turned out wonderfully!  They are great cool but fabulous while still warm!  I used an ice cream scoop to get the dough out of the bowl after refrigerating the dough. I made a mess (of my hands) rolling them but sure enjoyed the cleanup!

So yummy! They turned out perfect. Definitely for chocolate lovers. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate bars, so I used 3 tbsp of coco powder + 1 tbsp oil for each ounce of chocolate. Turned out great. Definitely a keeper!!

Excellent! Just made a batch. Followed the recipe. Didn't have much time for cooling the batter. Just put it in the fridge for 1 hour. And the cookies turned out perfect! Just like on the pictures -- with the crinkles and all. And absolutely delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very addictive and very sweet. I put a chocolate mint hersey's kiss in the middle of each and i couldn't stop eating them. I would make them again. My only complaint is that the dough got really hard sitting out on its own since it is mostly made of chocolate. If this happens, just microwave it just for a few seconds and it will soften up enough to make it after to work with.

I'm not sure if I just don't like chocolate enough, but in my opinion, these cookies are good, but not great.  
I made these for a cookie exchange.  I do like the simplicity of the recipe, and overall, they were very easy to make, they cooked nicely, and presentation was great.  I like the way these come out perfectly round (versus spreading like a chocolate chip cookie.)  The flavor was good, but nothing spectacular.  After a few batches, I decided to add pecans (would have preferred almonds, but didn't have any on hand), and I felt the flavored drastically improved with this addition.  
I would make these again to have cookies on hand, but not as part of an exchange or gift giving.

Excellent decadence.  Made these for a Unity Church Social.  They've now been nicknamed "Little Sneakers".  They were presented on a dessert buffet table with numerous other lovely desserts, bakery cheescakes, pies, etc.  At first they were pretty much ignored (I made the recipe exactly as stated, overnite chilling and they were pretty boring in presentation) but as the chocohalics started tasting, the whispering began.  I've been asked to e-mail the recipe to most of the congregation.  If presentation is important, probably rolling in a little confectioner's sugar would do the trick.  I think it's more fun to leave them as the "Little Sneakers".  Thank you for the recipe!!!  Will be including in my Christmas gift packages.

Seriously good.  Let the biscuits cool on the tray for a while to let them solidify as they are ultra gooey and will come apart if you try to move them too early.

The first time I made this I didn't have chocolate chips or cocoa powder and I absolutly butched it but it still tasted great. This is so much better than the cookies that you make from cake mix.
The second time I made this it was even better. All my friends love it!

These cookies are absolutely wonderful. My four year old daughter and I made these together because she wanted a cookie "with lots and lots of chocolate in it", And are these the cookies!!! Very easy to make...you will not regret making these (unless you have no self-control around chocolate:)

I followed the recipe pretty much to a tea, except that I used milk choc. chips (because hubby likes milk choc. more than semi-sweet)and as other suggested, I dissolved 1 t. instant coffee in the vanilla.  I chilled the dough overnight and used a cookie scoop.  It was a little messy even after chilling overnight, but it was so worth it!  These are excellent chocolate cookies!  Thanks, Kevin!

I gave this recipe 5 stars for taste, but would only give it 3.5 for ease in preparing. The dough was very sticky and difficult to handle. After my first try, I chilled the dough for an extended time, which did make handling easier. It was worth the trouble and I will make again.

One word can sum up this recipe: yumm :D Crunchy on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside!  More like a brownie than a cookie, which is just fine with me :)  

P.s: in my opinion, the cookie dough is better than the cookie! :D

These are unlike anything I've ever tried.  They're not really like a cookie.  Sort of like a brownie, but even fudgier than the fudgiest brownie I've ever had.  Oh well, so I can't classify them, they are still wonderful!  I use them like a chocolate cobbler, warmed slightly with ice cream on top, YUM-EE!

Mmm, definitely my kind of cookie; lots of chocolate! I didn't have any chocolate chips (which I didn't realize until I'd already started making them) so I used 8 additional baking squares instead. I also added a Tbs. of cocoa and chopped hazelnuts. My family gobbled them up the second they hit the cooling racks. :-)

i tried making these and they totally didnt turn out like the picture. They were all flat and cause they didnt have much flour we added more cause we couldnt understand how to put them on the tray if they were so runny. so they didnt turn out fudgy. i think maybe the fact that im from Australia and our cup size etc is different maybe the quantity didnt work out. i dont know. we might try them again some other time and try doing something different, see how they turn out then. they did taste really good though. they just didnt turn out fudgy.

These cookies ROCK! But beware, you must really love chocolate and they are full of deep dark chocolte. I used relly good chocolate(Valrhona) in the 3 batches I made and it was well worth the expense. I gave them as Christmas gifts along with homemade truffles and Iv'e already had calls for the recipe. The only change I made was to add toasted hazelnuts. Yum!

These were really good. I took them to work and got lots of compliments :-) I subbed unsweetened chocolate + sugar for the semisweet that was melted in the first step since that's what I had on hand. They taste so much like brownies that next time I will try baking them in a pan so I can skip the chilling in the fridge.

These cookies are very chocolate-y!  That's the idea, isn't it?  I made these for my aunt who is a bona-fide chocoholic and she loved them...I only ate one.  They are very good...I made as directed, but rolled half of them in powdered sugar before baking, and rolled the remaining half in finely chopped walnuts, they were the best!

Soooo rich and chocolatey, and so good.  I ended up using two kinds of chocolate chips: Ghirardelli milk and double chocolate.  Anyway, very nice recipe.

Made twice so far. Both times chilled the dough overnight in the fridge.  First time I didn't have enough unsweetened chocolate, only using 1.5 ounces instead of all 4. I also added 2 tablespoons of coconut butter while melting the chocolate the first time.

The second time I used 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate as the recipe calls for and instead of the extra coconut butter, I just added an extra 1 tablespoon of cocoa butter in the melted chocolate. and the second time I used dark chocolate morsels instead of unsweetened.

The first batch was more cookie-like and the second batch was more brownie-like. If you make the cookies you will see what I mean.

Both times the cookies were fantastic, and it was hard to not finish them all at once.

as for storage, as some have had problems: took the cookies out of the oven at 8 mins, lets them finish cooking on the cookie sheets, then when they were transferred to wire racks to cool I put a paper towels over them. When they were done cooling, the ones not eaten right away were transferred to zip lock bags and placed into an air tight container and stored in the fridge. Extras were put into zip lock bags and frozen for personal use. They do keep well in these conditions. 

best cookies ever, and best treat ever when you need a chocolate fix.

These are rich and chocolaty.  If you like brownies and you like dark chocolate, these are your cookies.  I watch them carefully and take them out a little early, because I like them soft in the middle. Yum!

Chewy with intense chocolate flavor ! The dough was also so fast to make, it took about 20 minutes !
The only thing that I change was adding little more flour, couple of tablespoons because the batter looked too runny for a cookie dough, almost like cake batter ! For the baking part, 11 minutes was perfect for my cookies.

Absolutely wonderful cookies. We were out of unsalted butter and used the salted one and it worked just fine! I also recommend substituting the vanilla extract for coconut extract. It adds a nice twist to the cookies!

These cookies came out rich, gooey, and full of chocolatey goodness! I dusted them with powdered sugar after baking them. They are beautiful! My husband, who hates sweets, loves these cookies! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I am 63 years old and have been making cookies for many years. These have to be the best I've ever tasted. I can't how anyone can give less than five stars.

Huge hit with the family. Best to refrigerate dough for at least a couple of hours. Put bowl back in fridge while one batch is baking.  My colder dough made a better looking cookie.  Already had to send recipe to my cousins.

These are delicious!  Not sure why some said their dough was thin or the cookies spread.  Mine was almost too stiff.  Maybe because I did most of the mixing by hand and made sure to chill at least an hour.  These turned out perfectly chocolatey and moist.  Definitely need a cold glass of milk with them.

4/7/2019 - Just made my second batch and turned out great, once again.

These are the most decadent cookies ever! Kind of a cross between a cookie, brownie and fudge. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of espresso powder.  I made some plain, then rolled some powdered sugar, and rolled others in finely chopped walnuts.  Outstanding!  Will definitely make them again.

This was an amazing recipe and super easy to make! I did however tweak the recipe to make it vegan and gluten free! And it’s amazing! 
Instead of the regular flour and sugar I used gluten free versions, as well as with the eggs. You can now buy protein eggs,made with protein base,(veggies) not any more expensive than a dozen eggs. You can find them by the egg beaters in your grocery store. Or you can use equal amounts of apple sauce. All the people I made them for loved them! 25, so they were delicious and none knew until they ate them! Less fat and better for you!

I absolutely loved the taste and texture of these cookies. I did substitute unsweetened Cocoa for the unsweetened chocolate. Delicious and melts in my mouth. How do you store these cookies other than the freezer? I hope air tight container and bread will keep these soft and fresh.

The best, most decadent chocolate cookie I have ever eaten.  So easy to make.  No need to roll into balls.  I simply scooped approximately 2 TBS of dough and placed on parchment lined baking sheets.  Incredible.  I've added this recipe to my list of favorites.

These were such a great hit at the Raiders game while tailgating that l had to make them again for the next game. They were gone in minutes and some of our tailgating friends were upset because they couldn’t take any home with them.

I didn't make any substitutions or adjustments to the written recipe and the cookies flattened out completely and merged into a giant mess. I chilled the dough thoroughly and baked it at 350F for 10 mins so I'm not sure what happened. I won't make these again, but if you give it a shot then start checking on them every minute starting at 7 or 8 minutes to catch them before they totally liquify.

Dough was too sticky even after freezing for an hour. I used a scoop because of this and when it came out of the oven after 11 minuets, they had spread across the whole cookie sheet and were not cooked thoroughly. After trying to fix it I ended up throwing it away because it was inedible. 
If someone is reading this and plans to make this recipe, add an extra 1/2 to 3/4 more flour so that you can roll it and they wont spread like mine did

These cookies were only average.  I added mint-chocolate chip morsels.  I took them to work and people enjoyed them.  Used a scoop to form them.  Did not even attempt to roll them.

I made these exactly as the recipe indicated. These cookies were just okay for me. When we tried them in their warm state they were alright, nothing like the raving reviews they get here. The next day, fully cooled off, they tasted better, but still not what I expected from so much chocolate....

I've made these cookies several times now for different events with my family, my in-laws, my coworkers, and my husbands co-workers. We have been calling them the "Crack Cookies" because they are absolutely delicious. I get asked to make these for every event and sometimes just because. They are fairly easy to make and are a great dessert to bring to absolutely any event.

Easy to make. Folded in maybe 1/2c of milk chocolate chips on top of the 1c semi-sweet bc I'm crazy. Had all of the ingredients on hand except the chocolate chips(only had about a cup on hand but now I have extra if I want to make it again).  Some of the one star reviews said they were expensive to make and hard but they are not! If you bake often(which I don't) then you should have most of the ingredients in your pantry. The only thing I was confused about (bc I'm not a baker) was what the egg and sugar mixture was supposed to look like... But I just googled it and attempted my best. Refrigerated for about 2 hours. The only thing I'd do differently next time is use a mini ice cream scooper for the dough! The choc kind of melts and sticks to your hands and the cold water on your hands before rolling them trick kind of weirds me out with the feeling on my hands lol. Otherwise, I think they came out delicious! Better than boxed brownie and has that fudgy/truffle texture. I'd def do it again!

These were seriously chocolaty good!  I ran out of the last 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips so I substituted 1 cup of white chocolate chips at the end to fold into the very chocolaty mix.  Still seriously chocolaty good!  The batter was very soft runny.  You have to refrigerate or you won't be able to form and roll balls.  I'm wondering if the 1/2 cup flour is an error and should be 1 cup.

I'm giving the review on basis of can't eat it as a cookie. I followed all the instructions, left it in the fridge for a day and a half, and there was still no way I could shape them into balls. So, on the principle that nothing with chocolate as main ingredient is ever a complete disaster, it's baking right now as a cake.

A chocolate lover's dream.  Make sure dough is chilled thoroughly before forming cookies.  For those who got bad results I'm wondering if they didn't use the correct amount of chocolate.  The 4 oz of chocolate equals a whole package of Bakers  baking chocolate squares.

Good flavor cookie, if you like a lot of chocolate.  Gave it only three stars because it is a horrible cookie to make even following recommendations from others --- too much wasted dough on hands, fingers, scoop; had to wait til firm enough to roll and/or put on sheet; had to wait 5 mins. to take off sheet.

These cookies are amazing!  I don't understand the bad reviews.  After reading the bad reviews, I came to the conclusion that they're probably a result of substituting butter for something else, overbaking or not using proper baking technique. I can't see how else you can go wrong with this recipe.

Oh my word! 
These are the best chocolate cookies I have EVER had. Used dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet, and used 3/4 cup of coconut sugar in place of the white. Let my dough chill overnight. I wouldn't change a thing.

I made these cookies - and they were delicious!  The only change I made was to use coconut flour instead of all-purpose flour to make them gluten free. Delicious!

These cookies are amazing! The only changes I made were using mini chocolate chips, adding 1tsp of peppermint extract, and freezing the dough for 3 hours. It's easy to over bake these cookies. If you like them moist with just a bit of crunch to the outside I found baking them for 8 1/2 minutes was perfect.

Definitely 5 Stars from the entire family, especially my 9 years old grandson. I made a couple of minor changes that made them even more irresistible to us all. Instead of adding chocolate chips at the end, I used dark chocolate chunks instead and also added chopped walnuts.

Delicious. I added a little less of the dark chocolate (3 oz) instead of 4oz. Only because that was all I had on hand. The recipe still turned out terrific. My husband LOVES chocolate and he really enjoyed these cookies. Thank you so much for sharing,

Great chocolatey cookie. Used the microwave for melting the chocolate, stirring about every 25-30 sec for maybe 2 min total. I let it refrigerate overnight. Definitely needed the water for hands when forming the balls, which did leave the dough a bit wet. The balls did spread out for mine to flat/traditional cookie shape. I took out after 10 min when they were still soft on top, as they hardened when cooling, but still had a soft center. Love the suggestion to add instant coffee or raspberry - will try that next time. Thanks for the recipe and helpful reviews!

OH MY GOODNESS!   If you love chocolate....if you love fudge, if you love cookies..... These are amazing!  Very easy to make.  The cookie dough looks like brownie batter, but you must follow directions and chill for a few hours minimum.  I used a little 1-1/2 inch ice cream scoop to dole out balls of dough, cooked 10 minutes, cooled on pan for 5 minutes.  They're beautiful soft truffle chocolate  delights.  My very picky daughter had one bite and was hooked.  These are so easy to make, and so amazing they have earned a place in the cookie hall of fame at my house.   THANK YOU!

I know I made these Christmas 2015 but forgot to review it. I recall these were really good, like Barefoot Contessa's White Chocolate Chunk Cookies, but without the white chocolate. I'm remaking these for PTO so I'll update my review later. ***UPDATE*** Do not overcook. First time I made these, I did overcook them and they turned rock hard by the following day. This time around, I cooked for 9 minutes then added raspberry jam afterwards. Tasted great, really rich, and does make a truffle cookie.

These are the most delicious Chocolate Cookies I have ever made!  My husband loves them.
I put the batter in the fridge over night, it is a messy job rolling them but this helps.
Will make them again for sure.

Worst cookies ever. They were paper thin and wouldn't come off of the cookie sheet. They were also extremely hard to make! The ingredients were expensive, and when I tried to roll the cookies into balls, they were super stinky and hard to handle.

I have had this recipe for years (long before it was on allrecipes) and this is by far the best Chocolate cookie out there!  Slightly crisp on the outside & fudgy on the inside.  I have made this every Christmas season for over 2 decades.  Sprinkle with Powdered Sugar for a "pretty" look.

Cipi's review of one star - not a chance - they DEFINITELY did something wrong!  NEVER do they turn out hard!

Disaster!! The dough is more like a batter, and though they did firm up after chilling for a few hours, they were still very sticky and hard to roll. I decided to let them chill more overnight before baking the rest and I had the same result. In addition, this recipe says to not grease the cookie sheet and my cookies got stuck on the sheet and very messily crumbled up when I had to pry them off. I was very excited to make these cookies since they look so good in the picture, but you might as well just make some brownies because that's basically what this recipe is, there's nothing "truffle" about them.

These taste amazing, but I must have done something wrong because my cookies came out completely flat.  I triple checked and I added all the correct ingredients and followed the recipe.  I also let the dough chill over night.  Any suggestions for me?

Wow! Amazing! Get a glass of cold milk ready for these. My only change was that I had a 3 oz extra dark choc bar that I melted with the choc chips to make one cup. What they lack in looks is more than made up for in taste.

Would not recommend rolling dough,instead use two spoons. I chilled it for 4hrs. Cook slightly longer. My oven usually requires that I take things out at minimum time and these were not done at 10min.

Tasty.

My adjustments: None.

Very very very rich, thick, dark, chocolatey. If that's your thing, you will love these. You absolutely MUST have a large glass of milk nearby!

I made this recipe for a party that I really wanted a chocolate souffle for but didn't have the time or skill to manage that for. These cookies are the perfect thing! Simple, rich and classy! I tasted the dough, a cookie out of the oven (because who can wait when it's chocolate) and a day later at my actual event and these cookies truly last and hold up with time. I cannot express how easy it is...I have 4 kids under 7 yrs. I made this recipe while they were all home and had one friend over. Amazing!

LOVE these cookies so much that I made two batches in the last week so that I could send them in care packages to both kids at camp for sharing and they were a hit. They are a scrumptious chocolate cookie.  A bit messy to roll, but well worth it.  Last batch I was short one square of unsweetened chocolate so I substituted semi sweet, still just as good.

Sorry to say that I am disappointed in this recipe and shocked at the rating.  The cookie is dry and tasteless.  I am a baker and love chololate.  This was a huge disappointment.  I am going back the chocolate crinkle cookies for my holiday trays.

Best chocolate cookie I have had. Made if for an office potluck and won best side/dessert. Substituted 1 cup butterscotch chips (mixed in at end) that I needed to use up and I could not taste the butterscotch, although others could. Will definitely use chocolate chips next time, may try it with white chocolate chips. As someone else mentioned it is very good with milk as it is very rich.

Very rich and decadent! I was hoping for a crispier exterior but the entire cookie was soft. It is very much like a cake or brownie. I also prefer a more natural looking cookie so I wish I dropped them with rounded teaspoon instead of rolling them into perfect balls. There a lot of similar double chocolate cookie recipes out there with slight variations. I will try others to find a well balanced cookie that is crispy on the outside but gooey and soft inside.

I've made the cookie 3 times but each time the dough spreads out to yield a rather flat biscuit instead of a nice cookie. Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? I did refrigerate the cookie dough overnight, but they just spread out within a minute or so of being in the oven. I resorted to putting the dough in mini patty tins in the end to get a cookie shape. I would give 5 stars for taste but downgraded to 4 stars because of this 'flattening out' problem.

This was the 1st time I used this recipe. I accidently used baking soda instead of baking powder. When i realized it I added the bakeing powder. They were awesome. Like a peice of heaven. Dont know how much they changed from useing that little bit of baking soda, but I will be makeing them again the same way.

not a fan! the name is not appropriate. i consider myself a great cookie maker and i was trying to make these for an auction tonight. Will not be adding them to the trays. They taste wonderful but, the most difficult cookie to make. super messy, tried everyones tricks and found that the only way to actually make them look like a cookie was to press them down with the bottom of a glass which i had to keep spraying with pam. will probably keep these for myself but lets see if i can save them by dipping half of the cookie into almond bark. and lets just call them what they really are...... brownies shaped like cookies.

LOVE!  I added a packet of Starbucks Via to my recipe, and am calling them Chocolate Truffle Espresso Cookies!  They are SO GOOD!  Using parchment paper and waiting a few minutes to take them off the cookie sheet helped keep these soft, chewy cookies in one piece.  I also melted a little chocolate and butter and added a little drizzle to the top of the cooling cookies.  I can't wait to make these again!

If you like chocolate or chocolate truffles, you will love these cookies.  Make them small and plan to share as they are very rich.  I halved this the last time I made the recipe (used two whole eggs), and it turned out great. (Only shared about half of them as they keep well in closed container.)

We loved these. I used mainly all dark chocolate since that was all I had, just added a bit more sugar.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, OH!!!  Thank you Kevin!  There are 3 things you should not do when you're alone in the house: use a chainsaw, watch a scary movie, and make these cookies!  If you're a true chocoholic you'll want to scarf down as many as you can and hide the rest.  (No, I have no idea why my pants are getting snug.)  After refrigerating overnight the dough was very stiff, but a mini cookie scoop and some muscle did the trick.  It was a bit easier after the dough sat out a while, so I may just try cutting the chill time.  I rolled some, rolled some and flattened them a little, and just scooped some without rolling them to see the different results.  The rolled were slightly neater and flattened made them LOOK bigger, but otherwise it didn't matter.  So if you're not concerned about perfect appearances you can just scoop and skip the rolling.  9 minutes in the oven.  I used parchment and forgot to try any without.  I'll have to make another batch to test that.  I may also try peanut butter chips instead of that last cup of semi-sweet chips.  Will update if I try it.

This was easy and so DELISH!!!  I will make these again and again.  Thank you to the person who suggested keeping hands wet while forming the cookies!  I also forgot baking powder at the store and substituted 1tsp baking soda and they came out awesome!!!  Thank you thank you for this recipe!

This cookie has a lovely soft texture and it's about as chocolatey as I can imagine a cookie every getting.

Oh my goodness!! Literally. I'm not a frequent baker, but I am a cookie monster. These are decadent dark bites of heaven. Sure to cure anyone's chocolate lovers craving. Very easy to make, and perfect for that special valentine. I would think these would go very nicely with a glass of port wine. This recipe is definitely at the top of my list.

If I could save only one recipe for the rest of my life, it would be this one. I make these once every couple of weeks. They can be tricky, they always seem to turn out differently from batch to batch, and it seems like the more humid it is outside, the flatter the cookies turn out. I've found that well-chilled (but not frozen)dough and chilled cookie sheets help, as well as whipping the eggs really well, and smaller cookies tend to look nicer. I've never rolled them, just spoon-dropped them which saves a lot of time and they turn out fine. I've used many different chocolate combinations and none have disappointed. My husband prefers them flat because then he can squish two together, fold them in half, and shove the whole shebang in his mouth. I spread nutella on two cookies and ate it like a sandwich once, and I'm pretty sure I had an out-of-body experience. BEST. COOKIES. EVER!!!!! THANK YOU FOR IMPROVING MY QUALITY OF LIFE WITH THIS RECIPE!!!!!

Taste like brownies. I get intense chocolate cravings, and these actually hit the spot. They were impossible to work with, though. I chilled them for a few hours, making the dough (it was more like batter, really) more solid. Unfortunately, this didn't keep it from sticking like crazy to my fingers. I had to coat them and my hands in powdered sugar just to get them to the baking sheet. They also really stuck to the cookie sheet. IF I make these again, which I probably won't, I'll definitely use parchment paper. They're really crumbly. If they didn't taste so chocolaty I'd give them way less stars...

FANTASTIC!  Definitely for the chocolate lover but the nice thing is that it really satisfies the chocolate craving without feeling the need to eat more than you should which is always a good thing in my book!  Kept dough in fridge overnight, scooped with a 1 Tbsp cookie scoop and then rolled in 10x sugar before baking.  Turned out perfect.  This made just about 5 dozen when using the 1 Tbsp scoop.

These cookies are to die for. I couldn't stop eating the dough; it was soooo good. If you are a chocoholic I would definitely recommend you try these. Also, I used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

So tasty! A non-carb-eating friend broke their rule to try one and did not regret it for a second. A moderate chocolate fan, however, said they were too chocolatey. I'm a chocolate lover, so I thought they were perfect!

I thought that this was a wonderful cookie.  I added 1 tsp. of instant espresso powder for a more decadent chocolate flavor.  I find that a small sized ice cream scooper made baking these cookies a breeze and less messy!

Awesome chocolate cookies! Certainly the best I (and all my guests) ever had. Definitely a keeper :)
