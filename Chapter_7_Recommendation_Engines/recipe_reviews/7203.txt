Very good whole wheat bread. Has a slightly sweet, but not overpowering, flavor. Texture is dense with good crumb. Makes great toast. I really like this bread recipe, Jon. Thanks for posting it.

My test of a good homemade bread is how good it is two days later -- untoasted, with just a little butter.  This held up pretty well.  I'd even give it a 4 1/2 if I could.  It was good fresh with butter and honey (although I would have liked a crunchier crust at this point), good the next day as toast and for sandwich bread.  A very all-purpose whole wheat recipe.  I might try increasing the amount of granola some next time.  It more or less disappeared into the texture of the bread. (I baked it until a turkey thermometer registered 200 degrees, which was just right.)

I couldn't detect anything particularly distinctive about this wheat bread that the granola added, but it has a pleasant nice and nice, chewy texture. It rose beautifully and baked up into an high, dense, fine-grained loaf.

Mine turned out really tough and dense.  I prefer a lighter wheat bread.  What was left after dinner is going to the ducks tomorrow.  My husband asked if they had risen (yes).

This didn't have quite the taste that I was expecting but it made a fine product and baked well in the breadmaker :)

YUM! I changed this only slightly and it came out prefect. The 3 of us ate half a loaf at dinner last night. I used 2 T coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and used 2.5 teaspoons of yeast (per my machine's rapid wheat cycle instructions). So good. Very flavorful, nice crust and fluffy inside. Can't wait to eat some as toast in the morning!

I just made this last night, because my boss asked me for a honey wheat bread. I cut a little off because it wouldn't fit in the gallon ziplock bag and tried a piece with some nutella for breakfast.

I only had white wheat flour, because my son won't eat regular wheat bread, and vanilla almond granola (almonds picked out), but it turned out pretty well. The texture was good, it stayed together well while cutting and eating it, and it tastes good. However, I didn't get a lot of granola crunch or that honey flavor that I was expecting.  I'll make this again, but will double the granola and the honey and see if that's closer to what I was expecting. Even if it's not, I'll keep making this, because it held up so well and makes a great sandwich bread.

This is very good.  I meant to add another 1/2 cup of granola at the fruit and nut beep, but I didn't hear the beep so I didn't add any more.  Bf's comment was that it "tastes like wheat bread"--meaning he doesn't like it that much.  I liked it--it's a nice whole wheat loaf, but to make the granola pop and make it a crunchier bread, I'd add the granola at the fruit and nut beep so it won't get incorporated too much.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe turned out really well.  I made it for sandwich bread and both my husband and I like it for that purpose.  I felt like it was almost too dry though.

I loved it!! My changes were: Since Fleischmann's yeast package says that is equal to 2 1/4 tsp. of active dry yeast I used it from the jar. Also I used crushed original Mini-wheats cereal (rolling pin and a Ziploc)and increased to 3/4 cup from a 1/2. Last but most important: I increased the liquid to 1 1/2 cups and used 2 % milk SINCE lots of bread machine recipes say use milk or water/milk powder.
I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.......
