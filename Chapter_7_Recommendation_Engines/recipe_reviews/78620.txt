Great sandwich!  I doubled the amount of tuna called for because one can just didn't seem like enough considering the quantities of the other ingredients.  It came out perfect.  A delicious recipe that is healthy to boot.

Great recipe!  I only used 1/2 of an apple and next time I will also double the amount of tuna.  There were no leftovers.

I've made this kind of tuna salad before but without the walnuts.  The nuts really make this interesting and very yummy.  I accidentally left out the mustard, and it was still very good.
