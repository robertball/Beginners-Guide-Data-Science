My daughters and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have honey mustard so I used one tablespoon of mustard and one tablespoon of honey.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder.  Very easy and very yummy!

I made this on a whim as I needed a quick and yummy salmon recipe.  My daughter proclaimed "I don't like Salmon!", but I made it anyway and I knew I had a winner when part-way through dinner she looks at me and says "This is to Salmon what In-N-Out is to burgers".  And if you live in the western states of the US and have been to In-N-Out, you know that is a HECKUVA big compliment!  I actually had three halves of salmon and I doubled the recipe...it was perfect!

I love how this marinade only takes 45 minutes... so if you forget to think about dinner until an hour beforehand, you can still pull it off!  :o)  When you set aside some of the marinade to use for basting, be sure you keep it at room temperature.  I put mine in the fridge next to the marinating salmon, and it solidified a bit and was too thick to baste with.

This was so good!  I didn't even have time to let it marinate, and it was still good.  Simple and tasty but seems like you spent a lot of time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is outstanding.  I just made the sauce & tasted it.  The secret is in the sauce.  Now I really can't wait for dinner and I know my family will love it!  Thank you Tim for posting this.

My husband really liked this and so did our 18 month old! I, however found that the sweetness didn't mix well for me with the salmon, personal taste I guess.

Very good recipe for an easy salmon dish. The only problem I am having is that the marinade seems to be burning on the fish. It tastes delicious but the smoke alarm always goes off.

This recipe ended up being great, I substituted the honey mustard with honey dijon dressing and added fresh garlic rather than the garlic powder and everyone in my family loved this! (even the ones who wont normally eat salmon!)

Awesome! I don't eat alot of salmon, because most recipes pair it with dill. This is sooo good, I am already looking forward to having salmon again very soon. Next, I want to try creamed honey and Dijon mustard in place of the honey mustard, as I have alot of honey to use up. Thank you for posting this recipe Tim.

The glaze for this was very good.  I added a little more brown sugar than the recipe calls for because I wanted mine just a tad bit sweeter, but I really liked the glaze.  However, I used frozen salmon the first time I made this and there is a HUGE difference in the taste of the frozen vs the fresh.  So for the best taste, be sure to use fresh fish, I definitely will every time I make this going forward!!  Overall, it was still good and has been added into my meal rotation

This made salmon-eaters out of some former salmon-haters at a family get-together.  We did cut back on the garlic - cut it waaay back so the flavor was more sweet and tangy.  Big hit and easy!

OMGoodness this was a HUGE hit! A friend was "home alone" and we decided to prepare dinner to cook at his house. We invited another friend who is very leery of seafood and "didn't like salmon", He said this was the best salmon he's ever had and LOVED IT!! Of course all of us loved it, not a flake was left, according to all-PERFECT! I stumped my toe on ingredients due to large pieces of fish and wanted to have plenty for basting, I didn't flip the fillets, just let them cook, skin side down, in a coated Pyrex dish. We've already decided to get more salmon to have this again SOON!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I had all the ingredients on hand, it was easy, and tasted pretty good. I have to mention, though, that it was not a typical marinade (lacked liquid) so the glaze pretty much sat on top of the salmon while it chilled. It was a good flavor, but it didn't permeate the fish as I had anticipated.

My family really enjoyed this salmon recipe. My four year old, who usually hates salmon, ate her entire piece! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil but kept everything else the same.

The recipe is AMAZING. I made it as is...doubled the recipe because I had 1 1/2 lbs of salmon.  I had to broil it about 17 minutes because of the extra size.  I did cut my filet 1/2 way through to help with the broil and when I make this recipe again, I will cut the filet prior to the first marinade.  MAKE THIS RECIPE!! It is FANTASTIC!

My daughter didn't necessarily think this was anything special, but my son - who refuses to eat salmon - loved it. Substituted fresh garlic for the powder.

Terrible recipe.  The marinade in't really one and it burns when broiled. If you have it farther away from the flame, it doesn't cook. Ended up frying it. Taste wasn't that great  either. Skip this one.

Very good! I think I will flip it over mid-way through cooking as the 15 minutes cooked it only halfway. After we got our piece I flipped it and popped it back in the over for 5 minutes. The piece that cooked longer was better texture and flavoring.

Either I made a mistake in measuring or this glaze is far too sweet as is. I tripled the recipe as I had 3+ lbs of salmon. I did use evil instead of vegetable but other than that, I followed the recipe but it came out far too sweet for us. It overpowered the delicate salmon flavor. We ended up scraping off the top in order to salvage dinner. I would not recommend this recipe.

I made this as is and thought it was great.  I could see a pecan crust being a yummy addition and will try that the next time I make this, because yes, I will be making it again.

Pretty good "marinade". I used hot sweet honey mustard instead of regular because that is what I had on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It gave the salmon a little kick.  I think next time I make this recipe, I will loosen up the "marinade" so it actually permeates the meat. I cooked a chinook 1/2 lb. filet with skin  side down for 9 minutes. I liked the way the salmon was a bit charred on top but marinade was too thick and there wasn't really any need to marinade during cooking because the "marinade" pooled on top. Overall though, I really like the flavor. Do you think I used the word marinade 1 too many times or what?

I thought it was delicious!  But I'm with someone who "hates" fish.  Oh well, more for me.

My family and I did not like this recipe at all. A little too sweet and it really did not satiate the pallet.

We loved this! I really appreciated the simplicity of the recipe. Served it on a bed of brown rice, with corn on the cob. Hubby liked it so much, it immediately went on the next payday's shopping list! He said it reheated well in the microwave at work for lunch too~ which is always a plus. Made his co-workers jealous, which I liked!

Like other reviewers, I left out both the butter and the oil as well as cutting the garlic down to 1 teaspoon.  I had two slightly larger pieces of salmon, so used the full amounts of honey mustard (made with honey and regular mustard), Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar.  I marinated for about 2.5 hours and wish I had gone for at least twice as long before baking at 375 for about 15 minutes.  We will have again.

Very tasty even with only  30 mins to marinate and so easy! Use 2 small cloves of garlic instead of powder as suggested by another reviewer and used honey plus mustard instead of honey mustard and it really set the glaze on the fish.  Broiled 4oz for 8 mins and it was perfect.

Was good, but there are better recipes out there that are just as simple.
