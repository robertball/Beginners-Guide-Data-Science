Why on earth would you discard the sausage grease and use packaged gravy? Add a little butter, flour and milk and make your own. This was very good and the concept is great, but I feel it tastes better with fresh gravy.

Really good!  For those of you asking about Why packaged gravy? Why canned biscuits?  Make it how you want - this recipe is intended to be EASY.  When you work 12 hours a day, have 3 kids to come home to, you need all the easy recipes you can get.  If you don't like a recipe, change it or don't make it.  Oh, and I don't even cook my own sausage but use pre-cooked Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles instead, Pioneer packaged gravy mix and Grands biscuits.  I do saute some diced vidalia onion to add in.

Fantastic! I'm going to make this an annual feast.  (Just wanted to reassure the food police that I'm not planning to 'obesify' myself or my family)   I think it's interesting that the creator was criticized by both sides of the aisle. What?? Not using the sausage fat plus added butter for the gravy?? Using package gravy mix?  It continues to amaze me that people feel free to criticize the recipe maker AND infer that readers don't have the sense to know whether or not to serve this to their family.  I'll say it again.... The dish was fantastic!

Yummy!! I made this last week and we loved it so much I am making two pans on Christmas for brunch for my large family. I used Pillsbury Grands Butter biscuits. ( they have visible flecks of butter in them). It's a 14 oz. can. I used the entire can. I tore them into large pieces  and scattered them on the bottom of the greased pan. I used Pioneer brand Country Sausage flavor gravy mix and shredded Co jack cheese.  Loved it! I will try Sharp cheddar cheese next time just to try it.
**UPDATE**. This was a huge hit on Christmas day! Everyone devoured it. Some said they went back for 3rds.
I made 2 pans the night before up to the gravy point then I stopped. I covered the pans with saran wrap and refrigerated them overnight. While the oven was preheating the next day I pulled the pans out of the refrigerator and set them on the counter. Then I made the gravy, poured it on top of the casseroles and baked. After they came out of the oven I let them rest for 10 minutes before serving.
I also used tin throw away pans you buy in the store for easy clean up.

Made this three times and tweaked according to a suggestion from another recipe. Don't use Grands! It becomes more like a biscuit casserole rather than a gravy casserole and doesn't have that wonderful creamy gravy you want in this dish. Use regular biscuits (I used a 12 oz. can of flaky). I used Jimmy Dean 1/2 hot and 1/2 regular sausage. I also made my own gravy with 4 tbsp butter heated with 4 tbsp of flour and slowly poured in 2 cups of milk , brought to a boil until a creamy consistency and added salt and pepper to taste. I assembled everything in a 9X12 glass dish the night before except for the gravy. The next morning I warmed up the gravy, poured it over the top and  cooked for 38 minutes (after the 3rd time, I found this to be the perfect time)  SO much better! When I used Grands, my company liked it OK, but when I made it again, they sucked it up with rave reviews. Next time I'll take the suggestion to add the sausage drippings to the gravy. Yum!

Excellent !! And Easy Breezy....Well, for once in my life, I made it exactly as the recipe reads. I usually ALWAYS change something or look at several recipes and try to use the best ideas from each. Not this time!! And I agree with some who said why the heck not use packaged gravy and canned biscuits. If you've got time to make your own biscuits and gravy from scratch, go for it. Then write your own recipe and tell us how to make biscuits and gravy from scratch. Easy is why I chose this one. Thank you Angela.

Great and no leftovers. Even picky kid eaters liked it and said it tasted like something Grandma would make. That's a compliment any day!  One can of biscuits only covered half the casserole so I used two cans, and I used 7 eggs instead of 6. Otherwise I followed the directions to a tee. I used Grands biscuits and they rose so much that my casserole nearly overflowed. Will definitely make again. Gravy gave it a nice creamy texture that you don't get with more traditional breakfast casseroles that only have potatoes, sausage, and eggs.  **Made this second time using Grands Frozen Southern Style  biscuits and it didn't turn out as well.  It tasted okay but the biscuits rose toward the sides and created a crater of sorts in the middle, causing the gravy to pool in the middle.  We still ate it all but I'll just stick to the refrigerated kind like the first time I made it.

I made this as with the exception of making my own gravy from the sausage drippings and added 5 more minutes of bake time. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Daughter suggested making a side of gravy for dipping, but we thought it was just fine as is. Highly recommend.

I made this last night for dinner using ingredients I already had: left over chicken, chicken gravy mix, and then all the rest of the ingredients were the same. Absolutely scrumptious!! I'm sure I will  make it using the sausage and gravy too! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

It's a great recipe!  I feel sorry for the people that come in and write a negative review and want to re-write the recipe.  I f you don't care for a recipe I think you can write a review explaining what you didn't like about it without being so hateful!

Delicious! The guys really, REALLY LOVED this, and so did I! This was very easy to make too. I used Peppered Sausage gravy instead of the pork gravy, because that's the way hubby likes his biscuits and gravy. I will def be making this again and again~YUM!  Thanks for sharing. :)

This casserole was awesome!  I made it for our Sunday School class and there was not one crumb left!  I've made this recipe at least 5 times now and my husband and toddler LOVE it!  It has turned into our Christmas breakfast tradition :)  I did alter it slightly.  Rather than pork gravy, I used regular "country" style white gravy.  Excellent substitute!

My 11 yr old granddaughter makes this all by herself...and she is so Very Proud.  The only difference is we use 8 eggs and we use packaged pepper gravy.  She beams when she does this and now she does it all by herself. I also am Very--Very proud of her.....

Turned out really well. I agree with most other posters and don't know why you would use a powdered instant gravy mix when you have the sausage grease. Just use a pound of sausage and make gravy. I'll also probably use a lot more eggs next t time too. Because I thought that layer could have been thicker.

This turned out as a great keeper.  I made a half and half version this morning. One half being these  instructions, the other half for my spicy family members.  The "other half" I used chorizo, pepper jack cheese, and sprinkled tabasco on top of the gravy before putting it in the oven. Mix it up and enjoy.  Yum!

For those of you who can'T understand why you'd throw away the sausage grease it's because it mainlines straight to your arteries whereas the packet mix takes a bit longer. Though biscuits and gravy are delicious they aren'T known as a healthy dish so if you can cut corners why not do it?

I prefer making my own biscuit dough for this and I use turkey sausage. Sometimes for an extra kick I mix hot sauce in the eggs.  It's a huge hit here.

This was delicious! Only change I made was I made extra gravy and poured on top before serving. Had leftovers, and rewarmed for breakfast the next morning. Was just as good if not better. Everyone loved it!

Followed recipe exactly as written,  even buying a packaged gravy mix (which I have never done) Didn't dawn on me not to buy any type/brand large biscuits - now I understand why - too much of the casserole was just biscuit.  I didn't  care for the brown gravy with sausage - the flavor just ruined the dish and the combination of the packaged gravy and the packaged biscuits  gave it was very artificial, chemical taste.  If I ever would consider making again I'd buy the small type of plain biscuits, a good quality brand, maybe  cut them up, and either make my own gravy or buy Bob Evans sausage gravy in a jar/can which is pretty good.  My husband didn't mind it too much.

Definitely will make again! Used a white country gravy rather than pork. It just seemed like the better choice because biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, etc. is always country gravy. I might go with less cheese next time. I put crumbled bacon on top but realized that wasn't a good idea because it was crunchy amidst all the soft yumminess. My son, 22 years old and has Autism) *hates* eggs, biscuits, gravy, sausage, etc. I cringed at what his reaction would be when I told him what dinner was yet surprisingly he was very interested because I "made it sound so good". One bite and he told me that I'd made a biscuits and gravy and egg and sausage lover out of him and that he could eat that every single day. lol Textures such as gravy cause a lot of the folks with Autism (all age ranges but not everyone with Autism has the issue) to actually never eat gravy. I've worked him into other gravies and yet couldn't succeed with country gravy. This dish did the trick! Thank you so much!! BTW, for anyone who might be concerned that it'll 'flow over' as I was, put a cookie tray either directly under the dish or like I did, on the next rack down. It didn't flow over but I was prepared! ;) Again thank you!!

Loved this. Next time I might add some chopped broccoli or spinach to the eggs for some extra nutrition. I used Trader Joe's biscuits and peeled them in half so that it could cover the entire bottom of the 9 x 13 baking dish. That way I didn't have any puffing up problems and all parts of the casserole had biscuit. Also made my own gravy in the frying pan, as many others did. Way easier and economical than bothering with a packet or a jar.

This was easy to make and, like others, I made homemade gravy. I should've seasoned my gravy more as I felt this needed additional seasoning. I also used a different brand of sausage than I typically do. I used Smithfield and should have stayed with the no-fail Jimmy Dean.

I make this for all holiday mornings and our family and friends love it! I use a large baking dish, the 16ounce can of biscuits, and it comes out a little drier than I would like so I use 8-10 eggs and a little less than one cup of milk. I also use a little more than the 1.5 cups of water for the pioneer gravy mix (almost the full 2 cups)... I don’t tend to have too much sausage grease once cooked so I don’t dispose of anything and just add it all in!

I have made this recipe many times and it is a simple delicious meal that my whole family enjoys.  It is always a favorite for holiday brunch. You can make this simple or more difficult depending on how much time you have. I usually cook my sausage the night before, use 9 eggs and season them with Tony's and black pepper. I also have no desire to make homemade gravy because usually I don't have time. I do use a cream gravy mix that I mix with milk instead of water and can be prepared in the microwave so all you have to clean up is a couple of bowls. Very yummy and easy recipe.

A fantastic brunch recipe! I made it in an 8x8 pan. I used regular biscuits (store brand),  1lb of sausage half regular and half hot- both Jimmy Dean,  6 eggs (a good dash of baking powder to the egg mixture- to keep the eggs fluffy), and about 1 1/2 c of gravy made from sausage drippings. I prepared it, otherwise, as the recipe instructs. The only thing I would have done differently is to make extra gravy to serve on the side. Oh, and to double this recipe!!! Excellent dish!! Thank you for sharing it with the cooking community!

Pretty good!  I agree with another reviewer to make your own gravy, even though I did make it as per the recipe this first time , but substituted half milk instead of all water for the gravy.  I might try at another time using a lightly hopped ale for a “Dude" breakfast instead of water and milk .

I’d add that I use a convection oven and it took 10 minutes longer to cook the middle because the oven drops the temperature by 25° F and the air browns the outside faster.  

So if you have a convection oven I would recommend baking it without the convention feature so that middle cooks faster and the outside doesn’t over brown.

Instead of getting rid of the sausage grease, I used it to make my own gravy and pitched the package of gravy. Put half of the sausage on the bisquits and put the other half in the gravy then poured that over the eggs.

Been wanting to try this, and check it out before serving to company.  I am so glad I did! We had it for supper, made exactly as written with Grands biscuits,  hot bulk sausage and Pioneer Country gravy. Did not add even a pinch of salt or pepper as I wanted to try to do without - didn't need it. Makes a huge dish, and very rich. Can't wait to see what my son and his family think - we like to trade easy recipes. Thanks for a new go to breakfast casserole!

I flattened out the raw biscuits  as much as possible, then cover the bottom of a casserole dish like a pie crust. I too make my own gravy, otherwise  nothing else was charged. Love making it for church breakfast gatherings. Always come home with a empty dish.

I went by the directions and all went well, except I used the wrong type of sausage.  I bought Italian sausage instead of a breakfast sausage.  I recommend ONLY using a breakfast sausage.  Otherwise, the dish is great.  Give it a good 35 minutes or so to make sure the biscuits are soggy but fully cooked.  Also, the one think I will change in the future will be to make my own gravy.  I agree with a review I read before that fresh gravy is better and takes just as much time as a package of gravy.  Very easy to make while doing other quick things that you have to do after getting home from work, so it makes for a good dinner as well.  Freeze leftovers in individual portions for a quick, yet filling, microwave breakfast (It has to be better than the prepackaged ones from the grocery store).

The eggs didn't turn out how I see in all the other pictures, I wasn't too sure if I should've spread out the biscuits on the bottom layer but it was great nonetheless! Flavors went together well!

I used Ground Turkey meat instead of beef or sausage, and I bought a Country Style Gravy mix. So I wouldn't have to make my own.  Instant hit!!! I have ate a lot of Biscuits and Gravy in my life time, this receipe beats them all!

I should have just thrown all those ingredients in the garbage and not wasted my time.
The biscuits never browned, they were like dumplings. The biscuits in biscuits and gravy should be baked so they are sort of  “dry” , these were so gummy . I knew the biscuits wouldn’t be “baked” but I didn’t think they would be quite that nasty. Another thing, cheese DOES NOT belong on gravy. Who in the world thought that was a good combination???

Just so so easy and so good. Thank you. To join the debate, I always read the comments. They are from people feeding their families, who don't always have the ingredients (like me). In this recipe, I will try to find that Pioneer mix. It is not available where I live. I will try Amazon. Tanks everyone.

Yum!  I had time today so I made it using two cups of homemade gravy instead of the gravy packet and it was deeelish!  Nothing against gravy packets, I will definitely try in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it with 2 changes, I made my own pork sausage gravy, skipped the loose crumbled pork and added in 5-cheese Italian blend cheese along with 1/2 cup cheddar. So yummy! The whole family loves it.

We’ve mad this casserole many times and has become a “must have” for family breakfasts. The only thing that I do different is to break up the Grands into half-inch pieces and spread across the bottom of the pan. I like the result better than laying whole biscuits in the pan.

Yummy! Made for Christmas morning and my boys asked to make it every breakfast! Used large can of biscuits cut up, 7 eggs (to use up the container), and made my own gravy. Was delicious. I could see making it up ahead of time, if you needed to, but wasn't too much work the morning of.

This is a great recipe. I subbed in homemade biscuits and homemade gravy. It takes the extra effort for this, so if you don’t have the time you can use the pre-made biscuits and it will still turn out great. I used to used gravy packets for years and would and sausage to it. After I learned out to make gravy it almost takes the same amount of time. But to each there own recipes are a guide line so unless you work in a restaurant have fun and tinker with it to make it your own. I enjoyed the recipe.

This turned out really well! I made it at home and it was eaten up very quickly. I did make my own gravy with the sausage grease. It’s a family favorite.

Used mozza instead of cheddar, and used country biscuits dough.  None left, so it was a hit!

I used three packages of sausage and browned it.  I divided it in half and set half aside.  I then followed the instructions, except I did not put the gravy mix on the top.  I put the casserole in the fridge over night and made my own gravy with the left over sausage.  In the morning I baked the casserole WITHOUT the gravy.  While it was baking I reheated the gravy added a bit more half and half and then poured it over the casserole when it came out of the oven......OMG it was amazing.  I will make this again and again.  THANK YOU

The only thing different was to add a few spices to the ground pork. I used Southeastern country gravy 4.5 oz. and I also make a little extra to serve in a small pitcher for those who want a little extra on top.  Thanks for the recipe

LOVED THIS!! Only things I did different were I used sausage gravy from a can, used the broiler at the very end to crisp up the top, and put fresh cut scallions on top when serving. Such an easy recipe, will definitely make again REAL SOON!!

I listened to. Lot of reviews. Did not buy the gravy mix. But in the end there was not really enough grease from the sausage to make a tasty gravy. 
The biscuits on the bottom did not raise or really cook and were very doughy. Also it needs no salt.
I will throw this recipe away, like I did with most of the casserole.

I got this recipe in an email from Allrecipes and I made it this morning! We didn't have any regular sausage so I used maple. Made gravy with the sausage in the pan. OMG this is so yummy! I will definitely be making this again and sharing this recipe!

Ok, I made it both ways, just as is and using the sausage grease to make my own gravy. In my opinion if you are trying to cut back on fats use the package mix. For the taste my family wanted the real sausage gravy. The youngest want this all the time now, I have used Italian sausage as well to change it up even more. A plainer version could be made using hamburger but I think I will stick to the sauasge.

Excellent!  My husband does not like mushy biscuits (at all) so I did cut the biscuit dough into 6 pieces with a pizza cutter before putting in the pan, and also prebaked it a bit.  I was soooo happy with the toppings, though!  I was afraid that the gravy would just mix in with the egg, but after it was cooked, the egg and gravy were distinct and the casserole lifted from the pan without being too goopey - will definitely make this again!

I made this with regular buttermilk bisquits. The grands were to much. I added onion to my sausage while cooking. I used wondra quick moxing flour to make my gravy and used almond milk. It turned out great. It was better than the original recipe I thought. But the original recipe is a 5 star.

Delicious!  Instead of the envelope gravy mix, I made it homemade and layered the gravy and sausage all together, followed by cheese, eggs and more cheese.

I am not a casserole fan, but needed a casserole recipe to take  dinner to a neighbor.  I decided to try it out on us first and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was!  I took the advice of others here and made country gravy from the sausage drippings and supplemented with butter.  
This is definitely a caloric indulgence, but most casseroles are and this one is worth the occasional splurge!

OMG! This is so good! I doubled the recipe for our family of nine and made my own sausage gravy from drippings using Bill's Sausage Gravy Recipe from this site. I didn't have milk so used half and half which helped make it creamy delicious. My daughter asked me to make this for all our family gatherings.

We made it five stars with chorizo sausage and added some cilantro from the garden to the egg mixture. It was awesome! An easy recipe that will definitely be made again many times over - a great breakfast, brunch, or dinner - which is what I made it for this first time.  Great recipe!!!

This was really good!  I only changed it a tiny bit.  I added some white cheddar and Swiss cheese to the recipe and I only had a 2.5 oz. package of Country gravy mix so I used that.  I also split the biscuits apart before I put them in the glass pan. Perfect!

This was great.  Easy to assemble and doesn't have to cook that long.  My family loved it!

I made this making my own gravy and also using hot sausage.  I received rave reviews for this recipe.  I used Pillsbury Grand Butter Tasting Biscuits.

This is now my family's new brunch favorite and i have made it numerous times. So easy to prepare and very tasty. The only change I made is that I cut the biscuits into four. This allows the sausage, gravy and eggs to spread a little more and doesn't make the biscuit overtake everything else. I have made my own gravy, used dry gravy mix and used already prepared gravy (can be found in most groceries in the south).

I followed the recipe exactly. Not exciting but I think the recipe has potential. I would ditch the Grands and use regular canned biscuits or use less than a full can. I would not use the packet of pork gravy mix. I would follow the advice of other reviewers and make country sausage gravy right in the same pan you brown the sausage. It is no harder than using the packet, saves cleaning another pan, and is SO much better tasting. I will try again with these adjustments.

This was delicious and easy to make!  I did listen to the other reviewers who suggested making the gravy from the sausage drippings, which only adds about 5-10 additional minutes to the process.  I also added cayenne pepper to the gravy for just a touch of heat.  My husband thought that adding green chile would be a nice touch (being from New Mexico, he puts green chile on everything!).  I used a generic 14oz can of jumbo flaky butter biscuits, quartered them and tossed them around the bottom of the 9" x 13" pan, generic pork sausage, 8 eggs, and Colby Jack cheese.  I then baked it for 40 min exactly and it came out perfect.  Big hit with the fam.

I loved it and wouldn't change anything except maybe make another gravy packet.  The one packet was tasty but because the biscuits  sucked it all up the end project was a little dry.  It was easy to make and a complete meal.

I used this recipe as a guide but made a few changes. I quartered my biscuits, laying them in the bottom of the pan. I made my own gravy and poured it over the biscuits and added the cooked sausage. I baked this for 10 minutes then I added the eggs (I used a whole cup of milk). I baked that for another 10 minutes or until it no longer jiggled. Then I sprinkled only a cup of these on top with green onions and placed it under the broiler until golden. Great recipe! And it reheats well, so it's nice for company.

This is my go to recipe!  I like saucy and moist dishes as well as a deliciously balance of flavors and this recipe fulfills all of those requirements.  Hope you try it....I'm sure you'll feel the same.

I use 2lbs of bulk sausage & roll the biscuits in the cooked sausage crumbs before laying  the biscuits down in the pan. Plus I use white peppered gravy!  My family LOVE IT SO much...they don't care if it's hot or cold!!!

This was delicious. The only thing I would say is that (at least) in our oven, I would have cooked it for 45 minutes rather than 30 minutes. The eggs weren't completely done. Taste-wise, it was yummy!

A local country store with a deli has this dish daily. I was going 3-4 times a week to get. The only difference: theirs has cubed potatoes. I've tried repeatedly to duplicate, but haven't gotten it right. I think maybe the biscuits is why mine isn't the same. I use canned, precooked new potatoes.

Very easy to make and very yummy! I'm already thinking about how good the leftovers will be!  Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll make my own biscuit dough and add a little more gravy.  I didn't see the need for cheese.  I followed recipe, but next time it won't be added.

Delicious! I threw this together in minutes for a warm Christmas morning breakfast. My picky eaters loved it and asked if we could have it once a week from now on! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except I browned the breakfast sausage the night before and put it in the refrigerator just so it would be faster to put together in the morning.

Very good recipe. Whole family loved it!  Only change was I pulled apart the biscuits into pieces and used Pioneer Peppered cream gravy packet.  The people that felt the need to make their own gravy and biscuits, bully for you!  This recipe is great as is.

I made this and for the picky adults in the house they loved it! I commend the original poster of this because I am all about easy cooking!  For those passing such harsh judgment, I used PREPACKAGED FROZEN GRAVY!!  And I forgot the cheese! I know the horror of it all!    Will definitely make this again!

Felt compelled to write a review while I'm still finishing my plate BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD. Used Jimmy Dean original sausage, Grands homestyle biscuits (8), and Pioneer peppered gravy. I baked for 40 minutes, seemed to work well - may need a bit longer than that due to the larger biscuits and high altitude here in Denver, but overall, we're elated. My picky husband devoured his plate and is stoked to bring some to work tomorrow. This recipe is definitely a keeper, I look forward to making it again!

This is a very good casserole. Easy to make and my guys loved it. The only thing I did different (the 2nd time I made it) was to use 2 packages of the pork gravy instead of one. To me it seemed a bit dry with only 1 package. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.

I first tried this when my son brought 3 of his college buddies home for the State Fair Classics annual football game. It was devoured. They even bouught the ingredients and asked me to make another one to take back to school with them  This recipe was perfect. I didn't change anything and it was a hit at home and at work.

Quite delicious and easy to make. Like other reviews mentioned, I just made my own gravy in the same pan I browned the sausage in.  Used most of two cans of regular biscuits and covered the entire bottom of the dish. Next time Ill just use one can and quarter or halve the biscuits and not cover the entire bottom. It was too much biscuit. Ill probably make an extra side of gravy too. I also added sliced mushrooms and green onions.  This is a keeper.

I have to admit I’m a lazy cook and this was a perfect fall breakfast to get the guys ready for chores. I used brown n serve sausage that I threw in the air fryer and then sliced up and canned sausage gravy. It turned out great!  Already have requests to put this in the breakfast rotation!

I made a few changes. I used pre-cooked sausage and didn't pan fry and crumble it...just diced it up small. I also made homemade biscuits. And I used poutine gravy mix. But it all turned out really good. And was really filling!

Too salty, even without adding salt. Cook time is too short, should be more like an hour. The parts that were cooked were ok.

This recipe is  similar to another breakfast casserole I have made.  My husband  really liked this one, he liked the pork gravy flavor. I  followed the recipe with no changes, I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely scrumptious! My family loved this recipe. I didn't change a thing, & with the pork gravy it was great! But next time I think I will try it with white sausage gravy. I'm thinking you can't go wrong with either one.

This was a great change for a breakfast casserole! I increased the number of eggs to 12 (so you could actually get a good taste of them), used a packet of cream gravy mix, and increased the cooking time to add 15 minutes uncovered at the end to brown the biscuits. (Also, let it sit for 10 minutes or so before serving.)

I make the gravy myself instead of using the gravy packet. So I rate this recipe a 4. Making the gravy yourself will make it a 5.

I have made this twice: once with store bought gravy and once with homemade gravy. Either way my friends loved it! Not as good as the biscuits and gravy casserole my mom and grandmother made when I was growing up but a good substitute. Definitely added to my friends brunch options.

I only made minor changes to mine (used breakfast pork sausage and also used country gravy because we like the flavor of that better. Otherwise SUPER easy to make, doesn't take a lot of time, and is a huge hit every single time I have made it!

This was really good!  Used Country style gravy and made extra in case anyone wanted to pour over but nobody needed to.  Saved gravy for next day  reheating. Hubby had it for dinner, breakfast next morning and then took a piece to work for his double shift. Everyone was asking him what he was eating that smelled so good, and came home with requests for the recipe.  This one is definitely coming to my next potluck or for when I have overnight guests. Thanks!!!

This was an excellent recipe! I love to make casseroles and my family liked this one! The only issue was that my gravy mix was extremely salty. So I nixed the salt as written in the recipe. I'll use a lower recipe mix next time...that's the only adjustment I'm gonna make. Two thumbs up!

This was very good!  Made for brunch with my parents and everyone loved it and had seconds. I split the flaky biscuits in half to cover the bottom of pan and used 2 pkgs. of pork gravy.  Didn’t need to change anything!  Served with yogurt and fresh fruit. Yummy and easy!

I made this for dinner one night.  My wife and I like to have breakfast food for dinner occasionally. I did make my own gravy, but I haven't always been able to make gravy until my wife's grandmother taught me, so use packaged gravy if you need or want to. This is definitely a keeper!! A real treat on a cheat night...HaHa!!

My husband loved it. I added some chopped bell pepper and onions just to give it a little zing!  I made it for dinner and he ate it for breakfast in the morning.  Very hearty, stick to your ribs kind of meal.

We loved it. I cut up the biscuits and used Hot Jimmy Dean Sausage, a can of Libby’s country sausage gravy, sharp cheddar cheese baked for 38 minutes. It was excellent. I didn’t add any salt due to complaints about it being so salty and normally I don’t anyway. You can add it at the table if you want salt. This one is a keeper. Thank you.

This was totally a hit! I made it for dinner. I did use Grands biscuits, I used breakfast sausage, and I used country gravy with the leftover sausage grease. Like another baker suggested, I found that 38 mins is the perfect bake time for it. My boyfriend wants this on a weekly rotation now LOL

Delicious! I added some sautéed mushrooms to the sausage layer and sprinkled chopped scallions just before popping in the oven. I will definitely make it again.

Ok, so I made changes because I didn't want to run to the store for ingredients, but I don't think the substitutions would affect the recipe all that much. I made my own biscuit dough and gravy. I added a bit extra gravy and next time would probably make a a little more than that. My guys like it with pancake syrup drizzled on top.

Tasty but the biscuits never cooked through! Too 'doughy'!
Maybe pre-bake biscuits and then add the rest of ingredients? 
I like the idea someone suggested about making 'scratch' gravy from sausage drippings. The dry mix was kinda blah. 
I would make again but with some changes. The basic idea is good.

My husband and I loved this. Of course I adjusted things for what I had.  I sprayed a glass 9x13 pan with olive oil. I used 14 oz jumbo buttery biscuits and flattened them; there were gaps. I used a package of Bob Evans turkey sausage crumbles and mixed in Hormel bacon pieces.  Just sprinkled some around.  I used 7 eggs because they were little, and added some dried onion flakes . I did not add salt; it doesn’t need it. I also used Pioneer Fat Free Country Gravy.  It worked well. I baked it about 40 minutes. I read a lot of reviews and used some of their ideas.  This really is easy and very good.

Family really liked. Made exact to recipe. Used crescent roll dough and turned out a lil flat on the bottom I think but still good. Cooked in deeper dish and took longer to cook through.This is basically like a quiche.

One of the best breakfast casseroles I’ve made! 
I had to substitute country gravy mix for the pork gravy mix.  Didn’t affect the cook time or the taste. This will go to the favorite file!

My family really loved it!! It was a little salty, (maybe the gravy has a lot of salt) so I will make it again without adding salt to the egg mixture.

Easy casserole,  I did add some onion to the sausage when I browned it and some dry mustard to the eggs, I used grands in the larger can and cut into 1/6’s to cover the bottom of the pan.  Looked beautiful but I think it dried it out a bit so next time will probably cut back on biscuits or increase gravy... good and easy.  Made for my Sunday school class and they almost finished it off.  Will make again for sure....I baked for 40 minutes ant it was perfect.

Good flavor but the biscuits were a bit doughy.  Think I would bake the biscuits as directed on the can. Then make the rest of recipe as originally directed the next time.  I also added onion, garlic and green pepper to the sausage liked that extra flavor.

Made it with breakfast turkey sausage. Used Grands biscuits but it was 16 oz not 10 oz so I left 2 biscuits out. Was still a little more biscuit than I like. I would use a second package of gravy next time. Turkey sausage is lean and can't really make gravy.

I made my own gravy after spooning the sausage over the biscuits using the flavored oil from the sausage.  One can of grands flaky biscuits was perfect.  The only thing I would add is some store bought breakfast gravy to spoon over the top at the table.  That would make it 5+.

Very tasty! I did make some changes, but unlike some people, I don't think this is a big issue to do, then post a review including your changes...as long as you don't give it a low rating then say "With MY changes, it's a 5 star!" I think most experienced home cooks make changes to suit their families tastes and do things they feel make it good. Some may find these hints helpful, others can just scroll on by if they don't. After reading several reviews saying the biscuits were too doughy in the middle, I cut up each one into 4 pieces, then spread them around the bottom of the greased pan. I pre-baked them for 10 minutes first. I sauteed a small diced onion with the sausage, drained it then spread this on top of the partially baked biscuits. I used sausage & pepper flavored country gravy mix vs the pork gravy and added some garlic powder to it. I also added some dried parsley flakes to the egg mixture. I layered everything as stated in this recipe, then baked it for an additional 30 minutes. It came out really well. My husband and I loved it. If you like Sausage, Biscuits & Gravy, you will love this too!

This was a huge hit with my family (ages 10 through 65)!  Very easy to make and looks delicious. I made one small addition. I added 2 tablespoons of Better Than Bullion Garlic to the meat while cooking. My family loves garlic so this was a small bonus. Will be adding this recipe to our menu.

This was just AWESOME! Made my own sausage gravy in the pan after the sausage was removed, with browned flour, and milk...brought to a boil and simmered until it thickened, then added the sausage back. No salt needed - the sausage is salty enough!

This was great! Made it exactly like it said but didn't read recipe right. I didn't heat up my gravy first. I added it over the egg and it still turned out! Next time I'll make extra gravy for when it comes out. Easy and delicious!

Ok I read all the reviews and I tell ya use more cheese it won’t dry out I couldn’t find pork gravy so I used brown gravy added the pork grease and some johnnys season salt (the best hands down) added red pepper flakes and well my oven isn’t the best so mine cooked longer but mine tasted like biscuits and gravy I also used white sharp cheddar cheese  will definitely make it again the biscuits were crunchy on top and done perfect inside the gravy was awesome

This is such a good and simple recipe - anyone can make it if they just follow the OP directions! I did not have any pork gravy but I had some pioneer white gravy so I used it - it was delicious!!!! I think it is a lil calorie heavy so I will save it for special occasions - but I wish I could have it at least once a week! I am sure you COULD make your own biscuits and gravy but that really would take away from the utter simplicity of a perfect meal.

Since my hubby and I love biscuits and gravy with eggs this was a match made in heaven. BUT since we are both on a low carb diet I left out the biscuits. I wasn't sure how it would turn out since the biscuits would absorb the liquids.  This is what I did. 1 roll of turkey sausage(since that's all I had)  fried up place in bottom of 8x8 pan. Cheese on top.  8 eggs mixed up pour on top. I always use libbys sausage gravy in a can. Dollop ed half a can on top. 350 for 40 min. Great recipe to start with just tweaked it a bit. Can't wait to try it on friends and family. I will have biscuits on the side and fresh fruit. Yummy

Made it as directed only change was in the cooks notes and used peppered gravy mix. The whole family enjoyed it. Even my four year old daughter had seconds and that never happens. 
We will definitely be making it again.

I made it - I was actually surprised how much everyone loved it and devoured it- honestly I wasn’t expecting it to be that great but it was actually really great - nice easy breakfast or brunch to serve a crowd especially at a holiday - when u don’t want to spend the whole time in the kitchen -

I made exactly as written.  I used the package of sausage gravy instead of pork gravy.  I found the biscuits in the very middle did not bake all the way through, all around outside were fine.  Very one liked this.

I followed the directions as written and it turned out very good!  My hubby loved it and said I could make this again!!  I used a glass lasagna pan and the Pillsbury Southern Grand biscuits baked up perfectly.  I had extra gravy (my pkg. was over 2 oz and 1.5 oz. pkg makes 1 cup of gravy) and I served the extra gravy as an optional add on.  Next time, I'll use the grease from the sausage to make my own gravy.  This is a definite keeper!!  
P.S.  I did bake it for an extra 5 minutes because I like a slight browning on the top.

Not enough gravy!! Next time I will use 2 (maybe even 3?!) Gravy packets...the recipe calls for 1, and that barely covered half the pan..I'm not trying to make a soup, but I would like a little bit of gravy in every bite

I have made this as written, and I’ve also made it making the biscuits and gravy from scratch. Honestly, there’s not that much of a difference. I will say that now that I’ve made it a few times (for potlucks) I’ve tweaked it. I now use 10-12 eggs, and I never use grands, I usually use Annie’s organic canned biscuits and I cut each biscuit into four pieces and cover the bottom of the dish with them. They cook through better.

I think after a few changes this would suit me fine.  First I will omit cheese and salt.  Also up the gravy mix to 2 packages.  Overall is a nice easy recipe.  A little too salty and dry for me.  I love lots of gravy!

Very good, but the recommended dish size was too large, so it was drastically spread out. Also, couldn't find pork gravy packets, so substituted brown gravy. Otherwise, a top notch meal! Will make this again.

This turned out okay.  It was tasty, but, it was runny at the bottom from some of the eggs and milk.  I cooked it about 5 mins longer to dry up some of the funniness.

I used packaged country gravy instead of pork gravy (because that's what I had on hand, and I am horrible at making my own), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This is delicious! Big hit at my house. Would be great for a carry in.

Made this for my picky son for school day breakfast - he loved it. I am not a fan of egg bakes, I tried it - thought this was amazing!  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  I didn't realize until it was in the oven that my pioneer sausage gravy packet was 2.75 ounces, all was afraid it would come out soggy, but it was perfect!

Rather than using refrigerated biscuits, I used the recipe from AllRecipes for cheddar and onion drop biscuits. I also made my regular sausage gravy instead of using a mix.

This is my go to for brunches. Everyone loves it. I usually use 2 full cups (8 oz) of cheese, a 16.3 oz package of grands flaky biscuits, and 2.75 oz package of country gravy in the 9 x 13 pan. It turns out just right after 30 minutes in the oven.

ONE BITE and I was hooked!! This is definitely a repeat in my household. My only suggestion is to double the amount of biscuits that you put into it.

Everyone loved it.  There were no leftovers. Next time I will get a large package of biscuits to cover the dish instead of splitting the biscuits in half. I think I will also try the country sausage gravy mix or make fresh.

Sorry, but I've made this twice now, and each time it is just not any good! I love all the ingredients separately, but together, they do not taste good. The eggs within the casserole are hard, and the flavors just taste funny together. Even served with extra gravy to give more moisture to the casserole, this is not a hit. Each time I've served it, there are no positive comments.

Really good, it was hard to find a 10oz can of biscuits, used 7oz ones, I decided to use both and not waste any, a little too much biscuit, next time I'll use only 10oz or use extra meat

I absolutely love this. I've made it multiple times and have tweaked it a few times many different ways.. Add homemade green chili over sausage layer it's amazing.. Add cream cheese to cheese layer over sausage... There are so many ways to personalize this recipe!!!

Take the advice from others and make home made gravy from the sausage. I also use one can of Libby's sausage gravy with my home made to make it creamer. Very satisfying!

This one was a victim of my own inexperience with spices.  I "added salt and pepper to taste," as instructed in the recipe, before I put it in the oven.  This ruined the whole thing.  My fault, I neglected to consider how much sodium was already contained in the sausage and the sausage gravy mix.  It came out essentially a hot mess, so salty it was unfit to eat.  

Still, I give it three stars and will definitely try it again because I can tell it would have been yummy without the excess salt.

Next time I make this, I will NOT add ANY salt.  I will let the sausage provide the sodium.  I think I will add some sliced mushrooms and maybe some  chopped Jalapenos next time as well.  

And I think I will make my own sausage-milk gravy separately on the stove top, and add that  to the casserole when I remove it from the oven.  Without my added salt, and with a home-made gravy, I am certain this recipe will be scrumptious.

Made it and it was well received. Remaking it I feel that it is better if the biscuits are cut into quarters and makes it more like a typical casserole. Seems better to cook it for up to 40 minutes to ensure complete doneness, but maybe I overcook it. Delicious.

My entire family loved this one.
I used an entire container of Grands biscuits.  Quartered them and lined the bottom of the pan.  I did increase the number of eggs to 8.  I didnt want it to be dry.  I also omitted the cheese feom the top, just because i forgot.  It wasnt neexed in my opinion!  We will be making again!

This casserole was a huge hit both at home and at work.  I had some chicken thighs/legs in the freezer that I needed to use up, so I changed out the sausage for roasted chicken and made a gravy using my drippings and some chicken broth.  Made this way it tasted like a Thanksgiving casserole.  I did use the Grands biscuits and cut them into quarters plus used 7 eggs instead of 6.  Would be a great way to use up your turkey after the upcoming holidays!  I can see how using sausage would make it more of a "breakfast casserole" and will try it that way next time.

About to make it, sounds amazing! When making the list for everything I need for it I accidentally thought hashed potatoes was an ingredient. So we are going to throw those on top when finished with the  original recipe! Definitely going to make it again!

This was yummy! My family of four loves this and with no leftovers both times I've made. First time I followed the recipe but used Pioneer Country Gravy mix because that's what I had at the time. It turned out good but the next time I made I decided to add 2 more eggs, more gravy, more sausage, and more cheese. For us, more was better! It took a little longer to cook but was worth it. Sure, if you have the time to make biscuits and gravy from scratch then go for it but for me this is a good recipe and a great time saver. Thanks for sharing!!

Made my own gravy with the drippings-cut the biscuits in quarters. Mixed the biscuits sausage gravy and some cheese and put in pan. Poured egg mixture over that and put cheese on top. Very good! Baked about 40 minutes to make sure biscuits were done.

Very good!!! My family loved it. I will definitely make this again and will add extra gravy. I didn't have gravy mix so I made homemade gravy. Added 2 cups of the gravy to this recipe.

no changes.  Good, but would make changes.  would leave out the eggs, and use peppered gravy instead of the pork gravy and double it.  pretty dry.  Yes I would make it again.

I made this for a small group at work.  It made way more than six servings and we all agree, it tasted even better on days 2 and 3.  I will make again and again.

Very good and easy to make.  It was a big hit.  I used 6 Grandes biscuits cut in half and made my own gravy adding 3 Tbls of butter to the sausage drippings.  It was delicious.

Turned out pretty good! Wife thought it was a bit salty but it could've been the gravy mix I used or sausage. I just simply loved how easy it was to make! I would definitely make it again but next time with more gravy possibly on the side to pour on top afterwards.

Changed seasoning to sage and coarse ground pepper , and it was more to our family's taste. Buttermilk biscuits and sausage gravy is one of our favorites so this casserole is a good idea

This recipe was fantastic! The only thing that I would recommend is adding two packages of gravy. Luckily there was gravy from the sausage so I just made homemade gravy and poured it on top. It was delicious! I highly recommend it.

A quick and easy breakfast to have at the cabin.  All loved it.  I used a country style gravy packet.   Maybe I would add a couple more eggs but it tasted awesome just the way it  is written.  Will make it again and again - probably 2 pans next time.  Thank you!

My husband is a big southern biscuits and gravy guy and I'm a fan of breakfast for dinner gal.  I made this for dinner and my husband had it warmed up for breakfast!  Warms up just fine in the microwave.  We loved it!

This is a keeper. I made a few small changes: used a 6 ounce can of mini Grands biscuits, made my own gravy with the drippings, and used a square baking dish (8x8 or 9x9, not sure which). It was light and fluffy and really tasty!

Okay sometimes I am in a rush and shortcut recipes.  I used Pillsbury grands; and canned country gravy.  It came out great!  Everyone raved about it and there were no leftovers.  This is about as good as it gets folks!  No one was the wiser and it was still awesome.  Just saying.......

I made the biscuits from scratch and added onions to the gravy. I was told that it came out a little doughy. I was thinking I should baked the biscuits a little before adding the other ingredients, but it did come out very tasty and we will probably try it again.

I have made a couple of times, once as directed.  The second time, I made my own gravy from the sausage drippings and we preferred it that way.  I also like gravy, so I used more than what the recipe called for in the dish itself, and then had some on the side for after it was cooked.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I make this once a week on the weekend.  The whole family loves it!  We have leftovers to heat up quickly during the rest of the busy week.  I cut the biscuits up into fourths and pre-bake a little while I cook the sausage and beat the eggs.  I usually use 7-8 eggs.

When I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it for my husband!  It was easy to make and turned out very well--the hubster says "This is a keeper!"  I won't make it very often, more like a special  treat...it's not exactly health food!  I had a packet of McCormick "Peppered Country Gravy" that worked very well for this recipe.  I could certainly make my own gravy, but I had this mix on hand and it was yummy gravy.  I'm not big on canned biscuits, so I may replace those with homemade, next time.  Thanks, Angela, for sharing this recipe!

I made a smaller version and I cut up the biscuits into smaller pieces before placing them in the casserole dish. I also added a few "pre-cooked" shredded hash browns. My layers were .. biscuits, potatoes, turkey sausage, cheese, eggs, gravy and cheese. It was wonderful. I thought I would have leftovers but I was wrong.

We both really liked this recipe.  I took others advice and used smaller biscuits instead of the "Grands".  That was a mistake.  When I make next time I will use the Grands.  I used Jimmy Dean's Sage sausage.  Great flavor with the country gravy.  I made this in the afternoon and refrigerated until I baked for "breakfast for dinner."

I made this recipe exactly as written, BUT, I added hash brown potatoes I fried up earlier on top of everything, then poured gravy over the top.  Outstanding recipe, my husband and I both loved it,  can't wait to take this along when we go camping.

I followed the recipe as directed except I added the cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking. I used Pioneer Sausage gravy mix because that's my favorite brand. My husband and I really enjoyed it! He ate THREE helpings at one sitting! This recipe is a total keeper and one I expect my husband to request often!

To get the best rise on your Biscuits Pop them in the oven and Bake until they have risen but not yet started to get brown Add all ingredients as stated above and finish baking another 5-10 min. The reason some people may not get a good rise is the oil or grease from the sausage if not well drained and the oil removed. Dough doesn't rise well if the sides get to much oil on them

I have made this a few times now. The only changes I have made are that I use the sausage drippings and make my own gravy. I used Great Value butter flakey canned biscuits and they turned out great. One can cover the bottom of the pan. And I baked mine in a 9x13 glass pan 375* for 35 minutes. I would place your casserole dish on a baking sheet. Mine almost ran over after the eggs and biscuits started to bake.

Made this today. Just a few variations.
I made homemade sausage gravy with sausage in it along with putting the layer of crumbled sausage. And I added more than just salt and pepper to the eggs. 
Turned out good. Was a hit here.

This is wicked good.  He loves sausage and gravy, who doesn't?  I usually serve this for dinner with leftovers heated up for breakfast the next day.  Not for calorie watchers but we enjoy it every once in awhile.  Extra good!

I made this for Christmas breakfast with the family and everyone loved it! I didn't deviate from the recipe much other than I used Bill's Sausage Gravy recipe for the gravy instead of the suggested "pork gravy" listed in the recipe. 

Very Good!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. I used grands biscuits and tore them into pieces for the bottom. I only had sausage gravy mix on hand and it was delicious, I'm sure the pork gravy would be good too. This one is a keeper, I will definitely make this again.

It was ok.  I used 1 and a half containers of Grands biscuits.  Cooked for an extra 5 minutes to make sure it was cooked throughout.

This dish tasted pretty good, but looked disgusting. To start off, I definitely think it needs more biscuits. The small can didn't even cover the entire casserole dish, so I had to use more. I also used the pork gravy mix and definitely think the recipe would be better with country gravy. With how it's made, I don't really think it can be called "biscuits and gravy casserole".. it's more like just a breakfast casserole with the eggs and cheese added. And the gravy just makes it look weird. I wouldn't make it again.

I just made this today. I did it just like it said but added some other spices. Paprika cayenne pepper onion & garlic powder no and believe it or not McCormack Montreal steak seasoning. Just a dash of each give or take. Oh I cooked it for 40 min!!

It's good and relatively simple of course I had to improvise some. I whipped up my own gravy with half of the sausage. Another modification, I went light on the biscuits and supplemented with bread cubes which went into the gravy layer. Anyhow, it cooked up beautifully and tasted great, we will see if it keeps overnight and warms up well but what could go wrong?

It was great. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. However I did find it a little dry and I added more gravy the next time except in a different way. After I finished browning my sausage I did not discard the grease.  I used the packaged gravy  and added that to the sausage instead of using flour and then added milk to the gravy and stirred until it was done. Lot's of flavor this way! I then poured that over the biscuits and then added cheese and then I added the eggs and then I added a little more cheese and of course had to make some hash browns on the side. Delicious!

I loved this and made it while on vacation for myself and my sister and her husband.  I would say they loved it since they even ate it the next day.  I had done up the sausage the day before to make it quicker to put together in the morning.  I had bought a package of country gravy that was twice amount called for.  It ended up being the perfect amount.  I would say making homemade gravy would be the tastiest but no time for it on this day. This would be perfect on a holiday morning.

This is really good.  To make it 5 star, make homemade gravy and biscuits instead of store bought.  It's trade off of little less flavor for a significant time savings.  If you got the time, go all out and make from scratch.  Otherwise there is nothing wrong with it as originally posted.
  
Leftovers are nearly as good as fresh.  Which is a good thing,  less tempting to eat seconds (or thirds).

Was nice as a side dish or as a breakfast dish. Made the sausage gravy at home but you need spicy sausages wher u can remove the casing and crumble them otherwise it tastes just like plain white sauce.

I served this at a family breakfast and everyone loved it. I didn't rate it a 5 because some of the biscuit on the bottom corners was hard and tough. I will make it again.

Kids say this has to be a regular. I didn't use pork gravy mix, instead I used canned sausage gravy. Much easier, and very tasty :-). I used Grands biscuits, next time I will use smaller biscuits.

Yum! I made a larger batch and just added more ingredients! My family loved it, even my picky daughter who swore it wasn't going to be good, loved it:) I made extra gravy and poured it over each serving as well. I brought some to work the next day for brunch as well.. yes, it's that good!

Delicious!  I took several other reviewers' advice and quartered the biscuits before scattering them on the bottom of my 9x13 pan.  I also used 8 large eggs, because 6 didn't seem like enough.  Next time I'll make my own gravy, as the 2 packages of gravy I used, (I went by weight), seemed too salty.  This will be one of my go-to recipes for potluck breakfasts.

I've made this three times in the last month. It is easy, tasty,  and everyone in my family loves it. I use the 16.3 oz. can  of Pillsbury Grands Flaky Layers Buttermilk Biscuits,  16 oz. Jimmy Dean Regular Premium Pork Sausage, and Pioneer Brand Country Sausage Flavor Gravy Mix. This gravy comes in a 2.75 ounce package and I follow the instructions on the back of the package instead of on the recipe. Thanks for this quick and easy casserole.

One of my my favorite past times are looking at recipes.  I fell upon this recipe as I was searching for a biscuit and gravy recipe.  All I can say is this was FABTABULOUS.  
If I change a recipe it's based on dietary reasons or lack of ingredients.  This will become a staple in my house as most times I have the ingredients on hand.  Thank you for your submission!!!!

First time making it I used a 9X9 pan as its all I had and made it a 50min cook time since its a thicker casserole in the smaller pan. I also added some not all of the sausage grease to the gravy used packaged the first time as well me and my family absolutely love this will try with shredded potatoes added next

I tried to make my own gravy from the sausage drippings and I guess I didn't make enough. Was only enough for a spoonful on top of each biscuit. Also used pillsbury grand buttermilk and I thought it was just too much biscuit. Ended up making a package gravy to add to the top when serving and that helped. Added the top cheese (probably a cup) after baking just long enough to melt. May try again with smaller biscuits but not sure.

4.5 stars.  Delicious. Used it for a brunch with weekend guests. Our company raved about it too and took the recipe home with them. I cooked the sausage meat the day before and just warmed it up when preparing the dish.

Made this for a girls weekend and it was a big hit.  But even better as a single person, I make it on Sunday and can take it to work or have it for dinner.  Very tasty cold.

Whole family loved it!
First time I made it, for some reason biscuits were not done! Second time, I pre-baked the biscuits, turned out perfect!

Fast and easy and it tasted great! We ate this for the next two days.  I am going to tweak it a little bit, but it was very good and worth trying again.

We loved this dish. Our family has big breakfast every Sunday. We will be adding this recipe . The only change we made is we used our family recipe for the sausage gravy.

The next time I make it I would probably use more sausage  - I think it would benefit from a little more.  Really amazing & yummy!  Even my choosy 11 yr old son liked it.

WOW! Easy to make and one dish dinner. I made this using vegetarian sausage patties,then crumbled them up. I did it on a night when we would both be off the next day,so we'd eat the left overs for B-fast,there were very little leftovers.  This brought tears to this red necks eyes. DELICIOUS!!

Great recipe and I'll most likely make it again.  I would add more gravy next time and cut the biscuits in half before placing on the bottom of the tray so you can taste less biscuit and more flavor.  The family loved them though.

I halved the recipe and made my own gravy from the sausage  drippings- much better than packaged gravy!   I was afraid the biscuits wouldn't cook well with that much liquid over them, but they really did.  I would use more egg next time.

I tried this recipe merely for the concept.  I grew up eating biscuits and gravy from breakfast (or supper) and thought the casserole might be a neat alternative.  All though my family LOVED it, I am not a fan.  I think it was really dry (compared to our "normal" style) and very heavy.  In all fairness, I did change one thing - I made my own gravy.  I just couldn't see wasting all the sausage flavor by using a package gravy.  Maybe that contributed to the dryness?  Not sure how much gravy a package would have made, since I have never used them.
The fam has demanded this be made again.  I will definitely be doing that, but maybe with extra gravy on the side.

I made this dish and followed the exact recipe. And I can honestly say I won't make it again. I agree with several other reviews, that the dish just doesn't have much taste. It's  bland and dry, and as I said, I followed the recipe exactly. And rather than try to find a way to make it better, I'll move on to other tastier recipes.

SALT!!  Do yourself a favor and back off on the salt.  Next time I'm not even going to add any.  And I'm going to use traditional white "biscuits and gravy" gravy.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

This is the first time I've made this recipe. The gravy on top made you think the eggs were uncooked. If I make it again, I will save the gravy to pour on your casserole after it's on the plate. No one in the family cared for it.

I felt like the dish was too rich  and the biscuits were too soggy for me to enjoy. 

I think cheesy scrambled eggs, a sausage patty, a biscuit, and some gravy all prepared separately  is tastier, has a better texture, and prettier to look at than this casserole....but is still too heavy and rich. 

You will probably want  to serve sides alongside  this casserole that are very fresh like sliced tomatoes and/or a fruit dish.

I made this and even though I try to make things homemade often. Sometimes you  just need to make a quick easy meal especially on Wednesday after working all day and then getting ready for Wed. evening church service. I did add chopped onions and frozen hashbrowns to the layers, 10 extra minutes cooking time and loved it.

Wow! This went over with my extended family way better than I expected!  Turned out great for a vacation day breakfast.   I doubled the recipe, and added a couple of extra eggs.  Couldn't find any 10 oz tubes of biscuits and was a little worried about getting giant ones that would rise too much, so went with Pillsbury Juniors and used 2- 7.5oz tubes (15 oz) in each  pan, which worked perfectly.  I'd forgotten to buy cheese specifically for this, so used what was available- some sharp cheddar, some Colby Jack, and a little pepper cheddar.  Finally, I made the gravy with the sausage grease, light butter (all we had) and skim milk  (plus flour, salt and pepper, of course) and didn't have to use the mix that I'd bought as a backup.  Ended up with about 6-7 cups gravy  (about 3-3.5 cups per pan), which is more than the recipe would have if using the mix, and it was the perfect amount- not dry but also not soupy.  I'm writing this recipe down for my in-laws and sister-in-law at their request, which is rare!  Will make this again for sure!

I made this dish last night and my whole family loved it!  My picky eaters ate seconds!  I used sausage flavored gravy because I love that one, it was super yummy.  I will be adding it to our monthly menu.

Made this, but used my own gravy made after I cooked the sausage. So much better than the packaged stuff.
