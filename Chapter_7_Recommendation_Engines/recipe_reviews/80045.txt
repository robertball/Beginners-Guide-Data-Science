The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 if for the ingredient amounts.  I could only use a maximum of 2 small frozen bananas and 1 cup of frozen dark sweet cherries or it was WAY too thick and I had to add a lot more soy milk.  My daughter is overjoyed when I've had a heavy workout because we get to have "shakes" for breakfast!  I LOVE these and we have them at least once a week and keep all of the ingredients on hand at all times!

Very good. I halved the recipe & only used 1 banana & a little more than 1 cup of cherries. I would make this again.

Pretty good. I froze the extra into popsicles and those were a big hit.

My boyfriend and I love this drink. We put protein powder in our and use Chocolate Rice milk to make it healthier. I would also recommend frozen cherrys. Its less work and it makes the drink colder. Sometimes we even freeze our bananas, if it looks like we have to many to eat before they will go bad.

This was surprisingly just ok - but it might have been the brand of soy milk I used.  This smoothie just didn't seem to have a whole lot of flavor - it was missing something.  I'll try again, maybe with Silk brand chocolate soy milk as that's my favorite, and maybe add some yogurt like I usually do.  This wasn't bad, just not memorable as is. ***UPDATE 9/10/09*** I gave this one another try, adding a little yogurt and a tbsp. of almond butter, for protein and flavor.   Loved it!  Changing my rating from 3 stars to 4

What a treat, this is now one of my favorite quick to go breakfast smoothies, I did add about a teaspoon of honey because it wasn't that sweet at first. LOVE IT

This was fantastic. I altered it slightly because I wanted no dairy or soy.  I halved the recipe: 1 frozen banana, 1 cup frozen cherries, 1 cup plain Almond Breeze almond milk, 2 tsp cocoa powder. It was delicious.

I made this smoothie for myself to try something different and to my amazement my children (who are very picky) enjoyed this very much. I had to make 2 pitchers of it. Instead of soy milk though I used 1% milk and chocolate syrup. Thanks for the smoothie idea.

These smoothies were great! Might add a little more chocolate soy milk to thin it out a bit, but they still turned out wonderfully! Even my husband who isn't a fan of cold things loved it!

So, so good! I was just making this for myself, so I modified the proportions for an individual serving. I used 1 small banana, 1/2 cup of frozen cherries, and 1 cup of dark chocolate almond milk. Yum! I will be having this for breakfast a lot, I can tell. Thanks for sharing!

I scaled this down to two for my kids and I and I used chocolate milk.

This was just okay. My kids liked it but I didn't.

My husband and I loved this recipe, I didn't have chocolate soy milk, so I used vanilla and just added 3 TBL chocolate ovaltine. Was terrific.

I made a few modifications.  I used skim milk and added cocoa and little sugar.  I had frozen sour cherries from last summer and omitted the banana.  Very good and filling.

I halved this recipe and used 3T of chocolate Ovaltine and skim milk in place of chocolate soy milk. Definitely use frozen fruit, and maybe even add some ice cubes as it seemed kind of thin for my liking. Not a bad smoothie, but probably not something I'd make all the time.

Very tasty. I didn't add banana, simply because my daughter doesn't care for banana in her smoothies, so I increased the frozen cherries to 3 cups in its place. I also added 1/4 tsp truvia (we like our smoothies sweet) & 1 tbsp flax meal for added health benefits. It was the perfect consistency & absolutely delicious! Thanks for posting!

I realized while I was making this that we had no cherries and not enough milk. I then added 1 cup chocolate soy and 1 cup vanilla soy for the milk issue. And for the cherries, I substituted peanut butter. DELICIOUS!

Not bad, I made a single serving and it was a little heavy on the banana flavor so I added more cherries for flavor and had to add extra soymilk to make it thin enough to drink.

I made this for one and it was very good! I used one unfrozen banana and a bit more cherries than 1/2 C. I also used plain almond milk (as I don't care too much for chocolate) and a scoop of protein powder.   Will make again!

Substituted fresh cherries and dark chocolate almond milk.  Also used fresh bananas but only did 1 large banana.  Added a cup of cubed ice to give it body and a nice chill.  Kids loved it!

The only change I made to this was using chocolate almond milk. Also I did not measure the milk but filled the blender until it was full. My family loved it!

Add 1/4-1/2 cup raw oatmeal and don't even taste it!
