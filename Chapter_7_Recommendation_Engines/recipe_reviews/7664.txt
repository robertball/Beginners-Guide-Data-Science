This a review for the frosting.  I made a different recipe for a cake and put the frosting on while hot.  The frosting had lumps of pwdered sugar in it.  Be sure to sift the sugar.  I still think the frosting was too sweet.  I'd use a little less sugar.

This cake was 'da bomb'! I made two substitutions: I replaced one cup of flour with one cup of whole wheat pastry flour & I replaced one cup of sugar with one cup of Splenda for baking. It baked  for 40 minutes and disappeared in about the same amount of time! It was quick and easy; just follow the directions to the letter, baking for 40 minutes.

This is a wonderful, moist, chocolate cake.  It is definitely fast and easy to make.  No creaming the butter and sugar together, and no greasing the pan!
What else can one ask for?

This review is for the frosting only. I used cocoa nut oil instead of butter, used dark cocoa powder, cut the powdered sugar down to 2 1/2cups, and only cooked it about a min after it came to a boil.  It was super easy to make and tasted great. Also, when it cooled it made a lovely glaze on the top of the cake.  Pretty to look at and yummy!  I'm definitely making this my quick, go to chocolate frosting from now on.

Good cake. My first from scratch. I would put more chocolate into the batter; the cake was moist and otherwise a big hit. I served it with a cream cheese frosting.

This is a great cake and my family has followed this exact recipe since the 50's.  The only thing we do differently is bake it in a jelly roll pan, I think it's 10X15, and it only takes 20 minutes to bake.  It truly is a fast cake, and VERY delicious!

Made this cake at 2 p.m. for a 5 p.m. christmas dinner today...Substituted coffee for water and soiur cream for buttermilk. Omitted cinnamon and added 2 tsp. vanilla, as well as 1/2 tsp. salt- I used unsalted butter. I boiled the coffee, butter and cocoa  to melt butter, then cooled a bit and whisked in eggs, sour cream and dry ingredients- right in the saucepan.  Before baking, I topped the batter with 1 c. chocolate chips. After it came out of the oven and cooled a bit, I topped with a sour cream/chocolate frosting (12 oz. melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 tsp. vanilla), then sprinkled homemade brown sugar/cinnamon struessel topping I made in 15 min. on a cookie sheet and broke into bits. Chilled the cake until dessert time and it was perfect!

Love it!  If you want a quick chocolate cake, this is it!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used sour milk.  Great recipe.  Especially for a homemade cake.  I didn't put nuts in the topping but it didn't really need it.  Plus if the frosting is to runny poor it on the cake then stick it in the frig for a couple minutes.

I agree with Danielle.  No way will this cake bake in 40 minutes using a 9X13 pan.  I waited 40 minutes.  Also, it flattened out when frosted.  Just a hi carb gooey mess that I will never use again.

Very disappointing - a waste of good ingredients. It took 40 minutes to bake and it still looked uncooked and unappetizing.

In Texas, this is the Texas Sheet Cake and it is baked in a sheet pan.  I personally like it thicker and bake it in the 9x13.  I also use a fork to poke holes into the cake after it is done to let the frosting meld into the cake.  If you have never had this, you are missing out on the most chocolaty, moist, rich, amazing cake.  It is always the favorite of everyone I know.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.

The cake turned out pretty good but had a little more of a cinnamon taste to it.  Will try adding more cocoa next time.

I found the 20 minute baking time to be a little short.  However, it was solid when I took it out, so I did use the the frosting on it (actually poured it on.)  

So, the frosting was very sugary and runny, and there was probably more than necessary when I was done cooking it.  I poured it all on anyway, thinking the cake would soak it up.  We let the whole thing cool for at least two hours at room temperature.  This was definitely not enough.  Ideally, it should have been put into the refrigerator to set.  When we cut into it, it was a huge mess.  

It was also a different flavor.  We are used to the box cake mixes and pre-made frostings, so possibly it is because of that we were not ready for what we got.  It wasn't a bad flavor, I guess we are just used to a more "chocolaty" taste.  This tasted very heavily like cocoa. This does not mean it was a bad taste, just different.

I loved it and I made one change instead of walnuts I used a creamy chocolate sauce that makes it taste even better but either than that it's great I recommend this to anyone who likes chocolate !!

This recipe really is THE BOMB!  I did,  however, make a couple of substitutions.  I used brown sugar and instant coffe instead of the cinnamon because both of those ingredients intensify the chocolate  flavour.   I also doubled the cocoa in the recipe.   The frosting is fantastic,  but please do remember to sift the icing sugar because the lumps are very hard to get out. Fantastic recipe,  thanks for sharing!

This recipe is yummy!! I read most of the reviews and adapted some of the changes others made - used whipping cream for the icing (made the icing a little thicker, only used two cups of icing sugar and pokes holes in the cake before pouring the icing.  I wonder what the icing would taste like using almond milk?  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

PS. I cooked for 40 minutes.

This cake is very heavy on the cinnamon aftertaste and too rich for even my chocoholic children. I'd suggest cutting back on some of the sugar or perhaps serving with a shot of insulin.

I remember this cake from the 80's. 20 minutes in oven? Not unless you want a liquid cake! Cooks about 40 minutes. Put the icing on when hot - cake will level down - this is the way it's supposed to be. Cover and put it in the fridge for a couple of hours - then eat it til your full - chocolate HEAVEN! P.S. I double the amount of cinnamon
