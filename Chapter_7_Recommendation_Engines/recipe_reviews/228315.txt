So I was a little hesitant to try this until I saw a few more reviews... But then I got into an extremely boring stretch of homework and decided to try it.  Man this is good... it tastes like eating a peanut butter banana sandwich on graham cracker bread.  I decided to add about half a cup of creamy peanut butter, the good stuff without all the added sugar.  I made my chocolate ganache recipe to throw on top and it was delicious!

I really expected great things from this and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I followed as stated with the exception of using chocolate Graham crackers for the crust. The cake had an overpowering "fake" banana flavor. Next time I will leave out the banana extract and use more real banana.

I made this for a bake sale at school and it was one of the first few items to sell out, even at $3 a slice! I left out the banana extract, substituted lemon juice for lime, and topped with sliced bananas and velvety cream cheese frosting. I did overcook the crust (my fault, not the recipe's) and should have started on the cream cheese batter while the peanut butter chips were melting (the consistency gets thrown off if you leave them out for too long after boiling), but the important thing is, my first cheesecake turned out to be delicious :)

This was very good!  I decided to use a springform pan, but still did the hot water bath.  Be careful with this...I made two cheesecakes this way.  One turned out great.  On the second, I didn't have the springform pan sealed quite right, and the crust got soggy (the water must have leaked in a bit).  Also...be sure to do just two small-medium bananas.  I didn't think it looked like a lot and so added an extra banana...and it overwhelmed the peanut butter.  Next time, I will stick to the recipe!  Still, very good!  I covered it with a ganache made from a cup or so of choocolate chips melted into about 1/5 cups of hevy whipping cream, with a teaspoon of vanilla added.

I'm not a baker - barely make decent meals.  This is the only cheesecake I've ever made.  I have only ever made a cake out of a box mix and various cookies.  This recipe seems complicated in some steps - but I've made this twice now and both times it came out amazing!

I made the recipe as written with the exception of the crust. The first cheesecake I used nutter butter peanut butter cookies, tossed them into the food processor, made an excellent crust. The next cheesecake I made with an Oreo cookie crust. Anyway you go with this, you can't go wrong.

This was so good. Everyone loved it. I omitted the banana extract because I don't like the fake.

There is no way it fit into an 8-inch pan. So I had to carefully scoop it off the crust, once I realized all the batter wouldn't fit, to put it into a 9-inch pan that I made another crust for.  The only 9-inch pan I have is a spring-form pan which I thought would be fine except for the water bath. The water seeped into the pan and made the crust a little soggy. The cheesecake itself tasted very good but I wouldn't do the water bath next time as I would use my spring-form pan again. I also substituted vanilla extract for the banana extract and made a peanut butter cream cheese frosting for the top and piped it on with decorating bags to dress it up.

I didn't make any changes I wanted to try it just the way it was.  Surprisingly I didn't get enough peanut butter flavor that I personally  wanted.  I didn't do the water bath and it turned out fine.  I would like to try the nutter butter crust next time.  I added peanut butter icing & Reese peanut butter  cups to add some pizzazz! (Picture added) 
I made this for my husband's birthday & he said it was "5 All Day!"  I had to go to 5 stores to finally find the banana extract, thank you to Ralphs.  Cooking time was perfect!  
**Great recipe thank you for sharing.**

This cheesecake was fantastic!  My brother-in-law gave me a raving review.  This is rare since he only grunts when asked how something tastes.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and chocolate ganace

What a surprise as I didn't think I was going to like it. I added a layer of the peanut butter chips and milk to the top once cooled. Yum yum!

This recipe was super easy and totally awesome. I added a dark chocolate ganache and peanut butter with some banana slices as toppers to spruce it up.

I made this recipe for a cookoff with a few changes!  I added more peanut butter chips and less banana extract! I used shortbread cookies for the crust too! I also covered cheesecake with banana whipped topping and peanut butter chips!  (See photo) It won first place!!!
