I didn't have iceberg so I used cut leaf lettuce.  I also didn't have corn and bean salsa so I just added corn and beans!

My husband and I absolutely loved these!  We found it very hearty, and I've actually made it several times since as a meal in itself.  Very good flavors.

Not bad.  I didn't use salad wedges but used spinach, as that is what we had.  Basically another version of a taco salad.  I would have preferred warm chicken, so I'll remember that next time.

As usual I could not help myself and added lots more veggies.  I decorated the plate with about 1 T of ranch and dotted that with green jalape√±o salsa.  Made a nest of matchstick carrots and red peppers to hold the wedge.  Added avocados, red onions, mushrooms and tomatoes. I used (modified) "Spicy Bean Salsa" with the chicken. Will have this at least monthly, perfect recipe to use up leftover chicken. Would be equally good without chicken too.
