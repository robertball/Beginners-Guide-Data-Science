This is my new favorite cookie recipe. I used splenda blend and whole wheat flour instead of sugar and all purpose flour. I know I will make these again.

LOVED IT! I have already made this twice within 24 hours!!! I followed the recipe as indicated, except I specans instead of walnuts. The cookies turned out great.  I baked them for about 11 minutes so that they would be soft.  The texture really surprised me.  The cookie was nice and chewie but the cereal gave it some crunch. Kind of like when you have a soft cookie with some crispy edges, but all mixed together (I don't know if that made sense at all).  Bravo!

Very good recipe and a great way to use up the last of the raisin bran.  I cut the recipe in half, but used 2 c. of raisin bran and added a little skim milk to the batter.  I made these into 8 HUGE cookies for my husband to take to work as breakfast cookies.  They took about 20 minutes to bake that way.  They came out very moist, and chewy with just the right amount of sweetness.  The honey was a nice touch.

Last night I wanted to use up the raisin bran I had, so when I looked I found this recipe.  It was perfect.  The cookies are tasty.  I used butter in my batch, but everything else was the same in the recipe.  I think the next time I make them I will add a tsp. or so of orange zest just for another little perk.  You were successful in making a good cookie recipe!

These cookies are wonderful.  If you bake them just a little longer they are nice and crispy.  I like them that way.  My husband likes them a little chewy so I end up baking them both ways.  Just love everything about them.  I added nuts this time.  Next time I will at a few chopped dates.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are really Good if I sound surprised I am, I really didn't think raisin bran would make a good cookie. I used margerine instead of Shortning, used 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of half and at the last minute I noticed I ran out of raisins so I couldn't add the extra. Even with these changes they still turned out really nice and chewy. Thanks for sharing.

I'm scratching my head about all the praise. Mine turned out dry, dry, dry. Not even remotely "chewy". The flavor, however, is excellent - hearty and delicious. I got the crunchy part. But we just couldn't get past the dry texture. The dough did not spread, not even a little. I ended up slightly flattening each cookie before baking them. Had I not done this, I would have ended up with small hemispheres, since I used a cookie scoop. I followed the recipe almost verbatim, but replaced the white sugar with Splenda to make them a little more diabetic-friendly, keeping the brown sugar. Since that represents only 1/3 of the total sweetening, and I've used that proportion many times in other cookies with no textural difference, that's not the problem. I only baked for the minimum time, 12 minutes, so that can't be it (and my oven is calibrated correctly.) I suspect that if they had been pulled from the oven at 9 minutes, the results would have been closer to those of others. That would be my main suspicion. Don't know with any certainty, however, how my results turned out so differently, so all things considered, I won't be making these again.

I've made cookies with various cereal added (corn flakes or rice krispies), but never before have I added Raisin Bran...and never before did I think I'd enjoy these so much! The 3 other photos, I'm sorry, but they do not do these cookies justice! A medium cookie scoop made these cookies beautiful! With a great flavor to match! I snacked on a bowl of cereal about an hour before making these and wanted to kick myself, because I only left myself with 2 cups of cereal. So I improvised and used 1 cup old-fashioned oats and about 1/2 cup Craisins (no nuts). These cookies hit the spot: I was surprised by the complexity of this cookie, between the flavor and texture... a sure winner with the coworkers tomorrow! --I noticed there seemed to be a fine ine between underbaked and a bit more done than I'D  personaly like, so keep an eye on them and SLIGHTLY underbake if you like to make sure it stays a bit chewy.

Terriffic! nice and chewy and although not totally healthy, one has to figure they're a little less bad for you than the usual cookie.  I didn't have enough honey and so replaced half of it with maple syrup and it was delicious!

Wow, so yummy. I do think that crushing up the flakes might be a good idea as biting into one can be a little extra chewy. Not really sure how healthy you'd consider this recipe as I also substituted butter for shortning. But, it's so good, healthy didn't matter so much! Going to try adding in some different friuts and dried fruits just to see what happens.

These are very good. I made a 1/2 batch and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. A great way to use up Raisin Bran cereal. (I am the only one in my family that likes it and a whole box is hard for me to finish without getting tired of it...) Thanks!

Taste was excellent. People complained about the "chewy" raisin bran; that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. But, will definitely make again because they tasted good enough that I can get over the texture issues. (And, as a side note everyone that "complained" went back for seconds so it didn't bother them that much either.)

I was looking for a recipe to use up some Raisin Bran and I'm glad I found this one.  I cut the recipe in half and it made 34 cookies.  I used a stick of Promise margarine, only the brown sugar, and omitted the extra raisins and nuts as I didn't have them.  The cookies were done in 14 minutes and are somewhat chewy AND crispy.  They're delicious!

Tasty, sturdy cookie good for shipping to family. The honey adds a nice accent and the bran flakes add an unusual crunch. I used pecans instead of walnuts. Personally I will leave out the additional raisins next time (not a big raisin fan).

This was a delicious cookie!  I added a box of butterscotch pudding (jello) and they came out crispy, chewy, and delightfully butterscotchy!  I used a mixer to mix in the cereal...making the bran flakes just the right size!

Had some bran Flakes on hand, so I made these up and sent these cookies to a party.  They were the only plate of cookies entirely devoured!  Many friends have asked me for the recipe it was such a hit with their kids!  Thanks!  :)

A little to sweet so will cut down on the sugar next time.  I added craisens instead of the raisins.  These make a good breakfast cookie.

Quite chewy but good.  For a somewhat healthier version: I did add a dash of cinnamon and used only brown sugar and reduced the amount shortening to about a 1/4 cup and 4 tbsp of butter. I also used egg substitute. Sub'd pecans for the walnuts. Would make again

Great cookies with the leftover raisin bran with some changes.  I used half butter, half shortening.  Substituted 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for 3/4 of the white.  Added 1 cup chopped walnuts, reduced add'l raisins to 1/2 cup.  Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Baked 13 min on UN greased insulated sheet at 335.  Cool on sheet 2 minutes.  These cookies did not stick and did not spread more than they should.

These cookies are great! Crispy and chewy and delicious. I added chocolate chips instead of the extra raisins and left out the nuts since I don't like nuts. They were ready after 10 minutes in my oven and I got 32 cookies. New family fav!!

GREAT cookie!!!!  I made only minor changes to this just to "healthen" it up a very little bit.  I reduced white sugar to 1/4c, used 1 1/4 c white flour and 1 c whole wheat flour.  For the shortening I used butter and all I had was Raisin Bran Crunch which adds some additional texture to the cookie.  I did crush the cereal a bit before adding to the mixture.  These were delicious and I will make again!!!!

I wasn't looking to use up my raisin bran cereal but rather looking for options so I don't have to be forced to eat the whole box myself.These are so good! I used the (vegetable) shortening because I had it on hand, but we prefer to use butter in our cookies. I skipped the half cup each of sugar and walnuts, switched the honey for maple syrup and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. These are definitely crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

These cookies taste great and are easy to make. Mine refused to spread though so they're round-ish :( And they are nowhere near the size of the ones in the first 2 pictures. Those ladies did NOT use a teaspoon as per the recipe! I made heaping teaspoons and thought that they should really be much bigger and flatter, personally, and that's what I'll do with the remaining dough. Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: In retrospect, this was one of those recipes where I just couldn't stop eating the cookies, despite some reservations about the appearance of the end product. I think I ate them all myself! So I'm revising my star rating up to 5 stars, because taste matters a LOT!

Really an unexpected surprise of yumminess! I too had tons of uneaten raisin bran taking up space, so I thought I'd give this recipe whirl. I'm glad I did ;) My kids who don't eat it in cereal form loved these. Will make again!

We just made this for Christmas Eve. They are "tasty and most excellent", according to the reviewers here. They are crisp little cookies that would hold up well for travel and gift giving. They have a great crunch to them.

I thought that these cookies were a bit too sweet, but still they were quite good. I used a bit less than the 1 cup of shortening and instead put in a bit of applesauce. And I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and the other 1 1/4 I stuck with all purpose flour. I didn't have any walnuts, so I pressed a whole almond into the center of each cookie. My kids liked them and I like using up the raisin bran!

I was a little wary of these at first, but really needed to use up some raisin bran that was rather stale.  They are delicious!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, half butter-half shortening, and instead of dropping by spoon fulls, rolled them into balls and then rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar.  They came out FANTASTIC.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I, myself, have not tried this cookie for the fact that I'm not too much of a cookie fanatic. I substituted a cup of white flour for wheat and kept everything else the same. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried them. What a nice way to get rid of Raisn Bran! This is a nice and chewy cookie. EDIT: Sprinkling cinnamon sugar/plain cinnamon onto the cookies prior to, or after baking really compliments the flavour.

These are fantastic! I made them just to get rid of some Raisin Bran cereal and ended up buying another box just to make some more! Delicious!

Wow! These cookies are absolutely wonderful! The only thing I changed was to not add additional raisins.  They were chewy and ohh so good.  This is my new favorite cookie! Somebody hide them please...

These cookies turn out great!  Followed the recipe exactly, other than crushing the cereal a bit before adding and using golden raisins as the extra 3/4 cup.
They don't spread on the cookie sheet and were perfectly brown in 12 minutes!  Oh...and your house will smell amazing too.  :)

Yummy substituted 1/2 margarine , 1/2c butter I made these cookies with the basic dry recipe but added or substituted these only as I didn't have everything I used the dry ingredients added 1/4 t nutmeg, 1/2t cinnamon. 2 T of roasted maple pecan syrup Added 3.5 C of Oats & raisins & more cereal. Plus 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Wish I had a berry cereal to try as that sounds lovely with the white chocolate chips. I did add my cereal to the mixer and just mixed everything to cut down the size of the flakes.  Turned out great! They were wonderful

I wasn't trying to use any Raisin Bran up, I just thought that these sounded interesting.  And they are.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies, so I thought that I would like these as well.  I added some cinnamon, but kept the rest of the recipe as written.  They don't taste that good right out of the oven, but are better once they have cooled and set a little.  The bran does add a little chewiness that was the only thing that I really didn't care for in the cookie.  Overall, the flavor was really good, especially with the cinnamon addition.  One really nice thing about these is that I did not think that the dough was good, so it kept me out of it (I do have a tendancy to eat a lot of dough while making cookies.)

Made exactly as stated in the recipe except substituted pecans for walnuts.  Took them to a Christmas Cookie Exchange party and they were a big hit!

This is a creative, fast and easy recipe! I also had to use the raisin bran cereal, since no one was eating it, and it was the perfect way to do so! I did use butter instead of shortening, and I added orange zest (about 1/2 teaspoon, since I halved the recipe). After the first batch, I also had to lower the oven temperature to 325, and bake the cookies for about 7 minutes, not 12-14. I also omitted the raisins, because most of my family doesn't like them very much. My brother and mom loved them, and so did I!

This was soooo good! I did mess up on the first batch by forgetting the second cup of flour , but the cookies were still divine! I used margarine instead of shortening to give it more of a buttery taste. Perfect!

These were really good -- they're different than the cookies I'm used to, which was kind of nice. They spread quite a bit, so I learned not to put them too close together on the baking sheet after the first batch all stuck together, and then I put the dough in the fridge for awhile hoping it'd firm up a bit. (But that didn't make much difference). Despite the spreading, though, the cookies tasted great -- almost carmelized on the edges thanks to the huge amount of sugar, so they had a nice, complex taste to them (I think that has something to do with the honey as well) and they stayed chewy in the middle. Altogether, definitely a 'make again' recipe! Thanks Ione, for helping me get rid of the Raisin Bran that was languishing in my pantry!

A great cookie, simple and easy. I used Raisin Bran Extra which has cranberries, almonds, and yogurt clusters in it also. It worked great in these cookies (didn't like it as a cereal, so I was trying to get it out of the cupboard). I used butter rather than shortening, left out the nuts because the cereal already had it, and didn't add the extra raisins (mainly because I didn't have any on hand). I cooked them at 350 fro 13 minutes and they turned out great. The cereal flakes added a nice chewy texture. I couldn't ask for a better way to use up the extra cereal in my cupboard!

These were so easy and delish. My 3 year old and I whipped them up with leftover raisin bran. We added almonds and chocolate chips - yum!
