I must admit I did change this recipe slightly.  I did not add brown sugar, because carmelized onions are very sweet on their own, I didn't want it to be a dessert.  I also peeled my potatoes, I just don't like the skin. I also did not add the rosemary, partly because I didn't have any and partly because I don't care for that either.  But this is the only way I will make "escalloped" potatoes from now on.  No dried up potatoes for me anymore. So creamy and flavorfull.  My husband raved about these.  A must for company or a pot luck if you want to show off!  A+A+A+

We loved this dish!  I cut the ingredients in half as I was only making it for DH and I and I increased the cream, but only marginally.  We will definitely make this again, and the only think I will change is the amount of brown sugar used.  While it does give the onions a lovely golden colour, we found it to be a bit sweet.  Next time I will only use 1 or 2 tbsp.

This recipe is awesome! I reduced the brown sugar to 2 Tbsp and used peeled russet potatoes. I also deglazed the onions with a Tbsp of Madiera. Took it to a dinner group and they all but licked the casserole dish!!  It is definitely a keeper. Such a great change from the cheesey potatoes casserole that we always return to. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME!  The first time I made this, my boyfriend loved it and said "I see this at Thanksgiving dinner...a nice change from traditional mashed potatoes"!  We both loved the sweetness of the onions by using the amount of brown sugar suggested.  We wanted even more onion in it!  The only thing I would say is to use regular salt and pepper when layering the potatoes.  The seasoned salt is not as strong.  I actually made these once with hot and sweet sausage for an Easter brunch.  I won the title for "Best Entree".

This is a good, but high calorie, sidedish recipe.  I would make it again, but not very often.

We really liked this twist on potatoes.  I used red and it made it way to sweet.  I would definitly use the potato suggested and a little less sugar in the onion mixture.  Liked the flavor alot.

Very time-consuming but definitely worth it! I made these as part of my Dad's birthday dinner and he loved them! Fresh rosemary is waaaay better than the dried stuff - you won't get the same flavour without it. Excellent.

Made this exactly as it called for in the recipe.  Very good but a tad too sweet for my taste.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use less brown sugar, more onions and be absolutely delighted with the result.  Such a change from regular cheese potatoes.  THANKS!

My instinct told me to halve the amount of onions, and I'm glad I did.  There was plenty of onion flavor, and I fear the full amount would have been too much.  The rosemary combined with the caramelized onion makes for a very tasty dish.

Amazing!!!!  I sliced my potatoes really thin.  I agree - you don't need the sugar for the onions, just carmalize them up nicely.  I put a little garlic salt in between the layers along with the rosemary.  I put some grated parmesan on top for a little crunch.  Can't wait to make again - I think I'll try with half and half to cut the fat a little.

Awesome!  Was a big hit with the hubby and the neighbors! Went well with salmon marinated in soy sauce and brown sugar.

While the amount of time spent on carmalizing the onions was cut down drastically, the recipe turned out well with a touch of sweetness added the the taste of the potatoes.  Unfortunately it wasn't a big hit with the kids.

This recipe - as is - is a splendid and resounding FIVE!  Try it as is first.  My own worries about onion and sugar levels were unfounded.  I do want to share some changes I made in subsequent preparations just as additional options.  I carmelized the onions in the oven with butter and brown sugar.  I reduced the fresh rosemary by half and put in the blender to release flavor and change texture.  I added a few slices of gruyere between layers and used freshly ground fresh pepper.  Nice additions for another take, but the original recipe stands on its own.

Wow, you must try this recipe!   Like other reviewers, I didn't use any brown sugar. Make sure to fully caramelize the onions; they are CRUCIAL to this recipe.  Caramelizing mine took me approximately 50 minutes or so, and this can be done a day or two in advance.  Besides omitting the brown sugar, I didn't change anything.  Delicious. I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to guests. Amanda, thanks for sharing your recipe!

I'm not sure about this recipe. I like cheesy scalloped potatoes, this has a very different distinct flavour. I will make it again but not often.

Did not use the rosemary. It smelled way too overpowering.I added leftover ham. It was delicious. Fiancee said it was the best meal I've made yet. Also I omitted the sugar. Onions caramelize nicely on their own.

I'd give this 5 stars, but as written there's WAY too many onions. We used 2 rather large onions and it was more than enough. Other than that it was SUPER delicious. But my non onion eaters wouldn't touch it :(

This was really good, simple, and delicious.  I halved the recipe and served with asian green beans and bbq ribs.  The only I will change for next time is a bit of salt throughout or a bit of very sharp cheese throughout.  It was the tiniest bid bland.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it (they were all asking for the recipe)!  It was so easy to make.  I will be making this dish again!  The only change I made was to half the amount of brown sugar that was called for.  Yummy!

These were okay, but I didn't really think they tasted that great for the amount of work involved.  To help with the fat content I cut the butter to 2 T and added a tiny bit of olive oil.  I also used fat free half and half rather than heavy cream.  Maybe if I had added the extra fat in it would have helped.  It wasn't that they tasted bad, they were just okay.

Rich, but delicious.  I followed this recipe pretty much per instructions except I didn't use the sugar, and I seasoned it differently, hence the 4 stars (no salt?).   Sprinkled Parm on top for the last 5 min.  Company dish served with roast chicken and green beans w/red pepper.  Everyone was happy.

I made these today, and I made a half recipe (3 servings rather than 6).  I did make a couple of changes, some by necessity.  The biggest change I made was that I carmelized the onions with bacon (2 strips, cut into 1 inch pieces) and some butter.  I did not add the brown sugar.  After carmelizing the onion, I followed the instructions completely about the layers and order of them.  I put them in the oven at 350 and set the timer for 1 hour.  I checked on them occasionally.  After 45 minutes, the sauce was bubbling like crazy and starting to dry out, so I figured they were done.  Unfortunately, the potatoes were still hard.  I added more cream (eventually adding a full cup -- the amount for 6 servings) and cooked them longer, but some of the potatoes were still hard after that.

I think I probably didn't cut the potatoes thinly enough, so I will try it again.  Also, I might try it on a lower temperature, since I know my oven tends to be hot (I usually need to take off at least 1 minute for any frozen food I bake).

Overall, these were very good despite the problems with getting the potatoes to cook fully and keeping the cream from drying up, which might be an oven problem rather than a recipe problem.  The only real dislike I had was that the onions were still too sweet.  I'm really glad I didn't put in the brown sugar, but I thought the bacon would help make it less sweet, too.  I haven't figured out how I will deal with the sweetness.

These were amazing. My family and I loved them. I added more rosemary because we love it in my house. Although this doesn't look so beautiful reheated, it tastes even better the next day.  Please try it. You won't regret it.

Simple and tasty
This was quick and very easy to prepare.  I have made it a couple of times with rave reviews (I did not use sugar to carmalize onions).  I added some cubed ham, cut back on the rosemary and made a one dish dinner.
I made it today to go along with a rib roast for Christmas dinner.

I liked it, but it wasn't for everyone.  However, the aroma was amazing.
