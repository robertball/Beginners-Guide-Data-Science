After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant to make this recipe because I was worried I would just end up with balls like everyone else. I had absolutely no problem with this recipe and thought it turned out fantastic! I added a little bit of cinnamon and sugar into the batter itself (like some others recommended) It wasn't too sticky and rolled out perfect. I had a hard time fitting 18 rolls into my pan though. I think next time I would try to make 12 or so and see if they rise up more. I will definitely make this again!

They were amazing! I didnt make any changes, except when I was stirring the mix, since many people said the dough can be sticky, it happened for me too but for the dough not to be sticky you just add more flour (like a spoon or two) and keep mixing it with your hands until you think its good enough to be rolled with a roll pin and not stick. Mine didnt stick anymore and was perfect. Also i made the mixture of 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar with cinnamon, but I personally didnt need to use all of that as it was a lot. Other than that, followed all instructions and it turned out amazing, soft and brilliant for breakfast!

Dough is extremely sticky. Used practically half a sack of flour on my surface and it still wouldn't roll. It stuck to everything and turned into cinnamon sugar biscuits, almost. Still tasty but not what I wanted to make.

I made these for my girlfriend and they were so good that my family ate them all before she even came over. I added an extra tablespoon of butter and I heated my milk to make them fluffier. Just make sure you don't heat the milk too much, you could burn yourself mixing and rolling the dough. I also sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the rolls

I've tried 'quick' recipes for cinnamon buns before, and I was a little worried they'd turn out hard and biscuit-like, like the other ones I've tried, but they didn't! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used a little less salt than the recipe called for), and it was perfect! I didn't have any problems rolling out the dough on a floured surface. I have a ceramic (from the dollar store!) rolling pin, not wooden, so maybe that helped..? They rose in the pan, they look great, and taste even better.  5 stars, 2 thumbs way up! ;)

Great recipe if you're not looking to spend hours waiting for dough to rise. The dough itself is very sticky like biscuit dough. Be sure your surface is well floured before turning out or it will be difficult to roll up. Also, it called for a lot of salt so I only used 1/2 teaspoon instead. They came out great with a lot of flavor and just the right amount of crunch to them.

I agree with many of the comments -  I followed the directions exactly and the dough was too sticky to roll.  I wound up adding about a cup more flour and kneading it, then rolling it out.  Next time I would use less milk and more flour in the original dough mix, and I will also add cinnamon sugar to the dough.

The taste is good but this was not an "easy" recipe for me.

Very good, easy to make or add other favorites such as coconut.  I noticed many of the reviews state it took a long time to rise. I used dastardly acting yeast and covered  the  dough with a warm dishcloth.  Also adding a bit more flour when k eeding will prevent the stickness.  Also used this reciept for monkey bread.  Rolled dough into balls,  layered in a bunt pan.   Mixed sugar, butter, cinnamon together. First put a layer of dough, dribbled sugar mix and sprinkled raisins and walnuts, continued with layers until done.  Baked about 10 to 15 minutes longer, cooled then turned out onto a plate. Family loved it.

They tasted great and my family said they tasted like the Cinnabon bakery type. Though the dough was very sticky, and it needed sugar in the batter. I suggest putting  1/4 cup of the cinnamon sugar filling inside the dough. Other than that, it was great!

The dough didn't come out right for some reason. I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes and it was too "wet". I tried to roll it up and it kept sticking to the the counter and ripping. I tried adding some flour but it didn't make it any better so I just ended up rolling it up my way. They came out alright. I'll most likely try to make them again and see where I went wrong with the recipe. I refuse to be defeated by some cinnamon rolls, lol.

The recipe for the dough was extremely sticky and I ended up adding a lot of extra flour. I had to cook these for about an extra 10 minutes so the dough wasen't raw. These definitely aren't the typical soft gooey cinnamon buns. But there's okay if your looking for something to whip up in a bit of time. And willing to deal with some sticky batter.

I only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt and put them in a 9x13 inch glass dish. The dough was perfect, not too soft at all. I think it might be meant for Canadian flour which always needs more moisture added than other flours. For those using other flours, King Arthur is supposed to be the one most like Canadian flour, or maybe use cake flour or reduce the milk by a few ounces.  I blended the butter and flour in my small food processor. They don't need icing. They do need to be removed from the pan before the sugar mixture hardens on the bottom. They were delicious and I will be making them again.

I followed the recipe exactly as shown. Flavor-wise, if you are craving cinnamon rolls, you will get it. The frosting tastes really good. But the rolls themselves taste kind of dry, almost like a biscuit, not soft and fluffy and flaky like your standard cinnamon rolls. I prefer the version with yeast. You will NEED lots of frosting to eat this.

Rolls turned into coffee cake because I couldn't make the dough roll up!  I spread the dough on a very well floured piece of parchment paper using a spatula because there was no way of rolling it because it was so wet.  I ended up just plopping pieces into the prepared pan and baked it as written.  In her personal recipe Shauna said that she has trouble rolling out dough.  I usually don't, but with this recipe she is not alone!  I loved the crunch of the generous cinnamon sugar on the bottom of the "rolls" and the taste is good, though I was a little put off by not having the usual yeast rolls.  I know this will be gone in a heartbeat as soon as my family gets hold of it!  This was an experiment worth making!

You can see by the ingredients how much money and time I wasted before I threw it all in the trash. Would have needed much more flour just to roll it. It was a gluey mess.

So many modifications had to be made to even attempt to work with the dough and still have it be tasty and not be a flour and butter ball.  As I am reviewing, the timer rang and they are just hard cinnamon balls.

I am an avid baker, but this went so badly. The dough was too sticky & stuck to my surface despite dusting with nearly a cup of flour. I am being optimistic. Maybe it will be like monkey bread in the end. Hoping for delicious failure.

I don't know what happened or what I did wrong but the dough was so sticky it wouldn't even roll up. I know I added the correct amount of flour so I guess they are suppose to be a good awful mess? Not worth it at all if that's actually the case. No one wants exploded cinnamon rolls.

The taste was amazing! I followed the exact recipe, and the dough was not to sticky for me. it worked but I did have a lot of flour on my space while rolling it out. The only thing that did not work out, was when putting the extra sugar spread on the cooking pan, that made the rolls almost burn to the pan and now I cant get them out without ripping them in half. I would skip that step next time.

The dough was kind of sticky but you can tell when it is so instead u should just add a bit more flour I addded 1/4 cups of extra flour because I seen it a bit sticky. Also I knead the Dough for a good ten minutes so it helped a lot more. Instead of spreading the melted better and then adding the cinnamon and sugars I just put them all together to make a paste and it was easier to roll. I also heated the milk so it can become fluffier. this is a great recipe. ??

I noticed some people had a problem with the recipe and others didn’t. Having been a cook and baker since I was a child, i went by the recipe. I found that the recipe is right and the people who had problems with it didn’t work the dough to  get the gluten in it working. As with most doughs, it can be sticky until the gluten got to work. Since this was the first run on the recipe, will add spice to the dough and make other changes on next go with it. Wonderful quick recipe even with some extra kneading. I will add lots of rafted nuts and a maple cream glaze.

I have been searching for a cinnamon roll recipe that doesn't take too much time and produces a tasty, soft roll that is not too sweet. This one fit the bill perfectly. After reading others' reviews I cut down on milk (used apx. 1/2 cup), and reduced sugar in filling (used 1/3 cup of each)because I was making only 12 rolls rather than 18. I used extra vanilla in frosting just because. It was the best cinnamon roll frosting I have ever tasted!

I really like this recipe, only thing i changed was the dough mixture, instead of adding the butter to the flour mixture, i mixed the milk/egg mix to the flour mix and then added the butter afterwards, then for the frosting, i added 1 tablespoon of milk but other than that i love this recipe, thank you :) :)

Made it with some modifications. Doubled the recipe, mixed about 3/4 of the sugar and cinnamon into the dough, and baked it in a 'cheater' cinnamon roll pan (shaped to look like cinnamon rolls). I'm not the best rolling dough, and the comments about it being sticky, made me think of using the 'cheater' pan.

See other reviews.  The dough was so sticky and unmanageable that you would literally have to add at least another cup of flour, which is then NOT the original recipe.  This was so much work just trying to get the dough to a workable consistency.  I wouldn't waste my time.  It was ridiculous.

Ive had better cinnamon buns, they’re not super special. but they’re good, Id totally make them again. as everybody else has mentioned, the dough was very sticky. just add a little more flour and all will be good. I used a muffin tray and it worked well. I also only cooked them for 18 minutes and it was perfect for me, I suggest checking on them at the 15 minute mark. also, the measuring cup I used for the milk I used as a bowl to mix the egg in.

I followed the recipe exactly, the dough was EXTREMELY sticky. Added a mouth 1/2 cup flour, still sticky. I added another 1/4 it seemed good so I floured the counter and started rolling. It was still so sticky I couldnt get it off my counter. I ended up having to throw it out. 
I've been baking for years and this did not work out at all

Oh Em Gee these were delicious! They were better than I expected. Yeast and I do not get along very well, so I had pretty much given up making good cinnamon rolls. But these were gorgeous and tasted wonderful. I didn't have cream cheese so I just drizzled them with basic milk-confectioner's glaze then added pecans. Yummy!

Was ok. Edible. I was a bit disappointed with the "crunchy" bottom. I would suggest skipping the cinnamon sugar on the bottom and instead spread it across the top. Also, watch the cooking time. I found 15 minutes to be better than the overdone results at 20 to 25 minutes.

Wonderful recipe when you want cinnamon buns without the time needed for yeast rolls. I accidentally melted my butter so I ended up needing a bit more flour in order to roll them out. The only thing I would change in the future is cut the filling in half.

I used only white sugar for the center mix of the rolls. Very good and super simple!! Also if I make this again I won’t put sugar on the prepared tray made all the rolls stick to it. Tough to clean up after. Over all perfect and taste great!

My family enjoyed this one and I would DEFINITELY make it again. I agree with the sticky dough. I kneeded and added flour until I was able to roll it out. It was yummy!! The frosting was a little sweet for me but my guys loved it!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  After reading other reviews, I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of the brown sugar/cinnamon/white sugar mix to the dough.  I also added almonds in the filling.
The dough rolled out fine but did stick slightly to my parchment paper while I was rolling them into rolls.  I used a metal spatula to help them along. In the end they looked and tasted great!

Maybe the author of this recipe packs the flour down when measuring - I ended up with a terribly sticky dough that I couldn't roll, and ended up throwing it away. Husband's birthday breakfast ruined.

Halved the recipe and adjusted the cinnamon sugar measurements even more as I don't like my cinnamon rolls to be too sweet. They rose perfectly and were beautiful and delicious once out of the oven! This will be my go-to cinnamon roll recipe from now on.

I have made this for my family dozens of times! Always a hit! Tip: I 'plumpify' about 1/4 cup of raisins by popping it in a bowl with water for about 30 seconds in the microwave and add it to the cinnamon filling mixture. They get all fat and juicy and my mom loves that I do that!

If you don't have yeast and you want a quick breakfast treat, this is great. Do not expect the texture and look of yeasted cinnamon rolls. I had to add more flour than called for in the recipe to get a dough that could be rolled out, but after that it was relatively easy to work with and I was happy with the finished product. The rolls were tender and tasted great, especially with a generous helping of the cream cheese frosting.

It was an easy and very tasty recipe. The dough was only slightly sticky nothing a little extra flour couldn't fix. My only problem was there was no way I was getting 18 rolls out of it. I got 8 ok sized rolls. None the less it was a good recipe.

Followed all directions but the dough was very sticky, so i put it in the fridge for a bit and floured the surface well, but it was still extremely hard to roll up. They kinda turned into cinnamon balls instead of rolls lol! Still tasted great though!

Followed the directions to a T, Delicious !! dough was perfect, rolled it out on parchment paper, doubled the recipe, used no flour to roll it out with, shortening used to coat the casserole dish.
 Kids are really enjoying this :-) is enough to rate 5 stars. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY IT WILL BE PERFECT...Depending on your oven as that will play an important roll. Personally i baked them at 375 for 20 min. Perfect.

It was OK, and I would say pretty good and delicious. However, far from a yeasted version of cinnamon rolls. It is a quick and easy recipe that get you some yummy rolls for breakfast in literally 30 min. This is a great plus.

This recipe is excellent, I don't think I will ever go back to making cinnamon rolls with yeast. So fast and easy, the sticky dough needed about ½ cup more flour for me, but besides that, perfection.

This turned out terrible. The dough was so sticky I had to put it in the blender with more flour and it barely rose in the oven.

The recipe as is presented some issues, the primary issue being the baking temperature denoted in the recipe created a hard exterior crust. I also noticed that the dough was particularly sticky and hard to manipulate on a heavily floured work surface. I would personally suggest if you make it at home to add an additional cup of flour to the dough, as well as baking the rolls at 350 to achieve a lighter, softer crust.

Like most of the reviews the sticky dough was off putting. The result however was great.
If you want a cinnamon roll and don't have all day to raise and proof this is a great recipe!
I did alter things a little; adding cinnamon to the dough and mixing the filling (all brown sugar plus 6 T softened butter) and applying to dough prior to rolling out. I also was low on all purpose flour and so half was bread flour instead.
The result was great! Light textured with a nice volume.
This will be a recipe I return to again!

Agree with reviews that found the dough too wet. I worked it quite a bit with extra flour and still ended up with a blob of wet dough. Too much sugar in the filling. Too little flour in the dough. Ratios are definitely not right on this recipe. Shame

These are not cinnamon rolls.  These are cinnamon biscuits. I followed the recipe exactly and when I added the egg and milk to the dough mixture the dough became incredibly sticky and unmanageable. I had to add least another cup of flour to even roll it out. I poured half of the sugar mixture in the dough and pan and there was hardly any "filling" to the "cinnamon rolls". When baked at exactly 400°F for 20 minutes as the recipe stated the rolls hardened and turned out to be cinnamon biscuits. This was not what I wanted to make,  I wanted cinnamon rolls. I am very disappointed with this recipe, however my boyfriend thought the flavor was good and that they were also like a biscuit due to the excessive amount of flour that was needed. Would not recommend unless you like cinnamon biscuits. Probably will not try this recipe again.

Very doughy and difficult to roll up. Flavor is more like something made from a mix. I won't try this exactly as the recipe states again.

I would suggest adding quite a bit more dry ingredients into your dough before mixing in egg milk mixture. Dough was the consistency of a thick pancake batter before putting it onto a floured surface. I think I'm going back to my old standby bread dough recipe using yeast that my mother gave me.

What in the world. I followed this recipe exactly and the “dough” was practically still liquid. I ended up adding over a third cup of flour before giving up and tossing it.

It was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls, and in that sense, this was awesome! The directions were pretty clear, the ingredients were basic, the prep time was a little longer for me because I don't bake much. They came out a little dry, but flavorful. The frosting was OK, it just seemed to be missing something. Maybe almond extract along with the vanilla? It seemed easy to experiment with. I'll definitely make these again!

Loved this recipe!  Totally forgot to get cinnamon roles this year, so I made these. I didn’t find the dough sticky at all but I made and kneaded the dough in my kitchen aid. I also lined the pan with parchment paper. The dough rolled out great and the parchment paper prevented anything from sticking. 

Highly recommend this recipe!  Huge hit for Christmas morning!

I made this recipe as written despite having reservations after having read the recipe. I would rate it below Dairy case cinnamon rolls that you just pop in the oven. The prep times were pretty accurate; but you are left with a horrible mess which takes quite a while to clean up. All in all we thought these were terrible.I would recommend halving the sugar and not putting any on the prepared pan. I have a very large sweet tooth but these were way too sweet for me.

So sticky and after 1/2 bag of additional flour, it still was sticky.  Do not attempt this recipe.  We wasted our time and dirtied so many dishes and all for a sticky mess!!  Never have I experienced this before with other recipes!!

They were incredibly sticky no matter how much extra flour I put in! I couldn't even get it to be balls!! The dough just stuck to my hands, the spoon, the bowl, the pin. It was the most frustrating thing I've ever tried to make.

These reminded my daughters of monkey bread - which they love!  The dough was extremely sticky - impossible to roll as ratios given.  I added more flour until it was able to be rolled out.  Quick and yummy!  (Pic is pre-baking)

They taste great! The dough was quite wet so I did add an extra cup of flour and I didn’t get 18 rolls but rather 15 small ones so I would double the recipe next time. Also didn’t have cream cheese so just did a simple coffee icing (icing sugar, instant coffee and hot water) and that was a great addition. Overall, great tasting cinnamon scones, will make again. (Oh and I forgot to put cinnamon sugar on bottom of pan but they still turned out great)

The cinnamon rolls are delicious and easy to make. I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the dough. I cut down the cinnamon sugar filling in half and it was the perfect sweetness for our family's taste. The dough is indeed very sticky but like other reviewers suggested just add more flour. I added about a little over 1 cup of extra flour before turning it on the counter. If you like simple easy baking like me, do try it out.

It's pretty good considering that it is without yeast nor proofing. Thanks for sharing!

ok after reading and studying throughout all of the reviews, I followed all the directions except I used a different icing recipe.  The recipe makes mini cinnamon rolls. The key thing is you have to follow directions.  They say the dough is sticky? You have to turn it out onto a *floured surface*. I worked a bit on the floured surface and then rolled it with a floured roller. You need to dust the roller so it doesnt stick yo it. 
 Also I didn't have a 9x9 glass pan, instead I used a 9x 13 glass pan.  It turned out great! I'm doing it again. It was great! Tasted awesome. Terrible for a diabetic tho. Shot my sugar threw the roof!... and the smell went all through my house... omg!  Yeah! I'm doing this recipe again

According to the cook's note, I halved the recipe because it was just for my wife and I and it came out great. Flour measurement was too small, so I added additional flour (about quarter cup) until I could get a proper soft dough.   I also kneaded instead of using the spatula. But other than the difference in technique (and the little extra flour), everything was spot on in this recipe.

Definitely more of a mini cinnamon bun but still yummie, quick and easy ! The dough was a big too sticky but with a tiny bit of flour while rolling it, it came out great! The kids gave this the seal of approval so that’s a win in my books !

I made this cause I love .aking random new recipes.  But this one. The dough was too sticky so you cant roll it. Ended up adding an extra cup of flour. They were okay but the sides were too hard and the sugar cinnamon mixture at the bottom just hardened like candy (bleh).

These are easy-to-make and great tasting cinnamon rolls. I have tried a few quick cinnamon roll recipes, and these by far have the best texture and the best flavor. I only made a couple modifications as I went through - call it baker’s intuition. First, I doubled the cinnamon to 2 tablespoons. Second, the dough was too sticky to be rolled out properly, but working in 2 additional tablespoons of flour worked perfectly. So delicious and fast!

the sugar mixture at the bottom of the pan made it hard and stuck to the pan. The rolls itself was pretty ok, more like a sweet biscuit taste. I added honey pecan cream cheese to the top though.

Starting out, the dough was extremely sticky, but just added more flour to my cutting board. Also I chill my roll pin in the freezer really good and that helps the dough from sticking to it. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Except didn’t use all the filling, since it looked way too much. Overall turned out very cinnamon flavored and light, chewy rolls :)

Sooo delicious. Very sugary. The only thing I changed was that I used a buttercream icing instead of the cream cheese icing. But the rolls themselves were SOOO good.

Will certainly be making these again..  and again. The dough looked impossible initially but after 2 or 3 tablespoons of extra four it was perfect, easy to roll out and soft and light when baked. Used Ceylon cinnamon and the taste and aroma was out of this world.

These are truly amazing cinnamon rolls! They taste like the store bought cinnamon rolls in a tube. I added the butter that you're supposed to brush on the dough into the cinnamon mixture, and they were much softer. The dough was also rather sticky, but an extra 1/2 cup of flour can fix that. These are great cinnamon rolls if you don't have time to make normal ones, or can't get out to the store to buy some!

I made it with my 14 year old and 4 year old.
Super easy, super fun, super yummy!
1. Don’t be afraid to put what looks like a lot of the filling mix into the roll, we were, and in the end now wish that we put the full amount.
2. The cream cheese icing is so yummy, lol but you only really need half that much!

Mine didn't look the best but it tasted great! I didn't make any adjustments on the dough, but I kinda just did whatever with the frosting, I used butter and powdered sugar. Will definitely make again!

We liked it. Icing was yummy too! Easy enough recipe, just added more flour while rolling it out... not a big deal and baked it for 24 mins. Made 14 rolls.

The dough was too wet to roll at all, so I was only left with a blobbed bun-like thing, totally unlike what was advertised!  If you really want to use this recipe, use way more flour then it says to!

I followed the directions and it was way too sticky. I wished I would have read the reviews first. I added another 1.5 cups of flour and knead it on the counter and seemed to work but I felt like it was too dry. I will try again with only 1 extra cup of flour.

I read the reviews about the sticky dough. Yes it was sticky,  but I kneaded the dough with flour and it was fine.   Fantastic for a non yeast recipe. Fast and simple. Cut back cooking time. 15 min was good.

Nice and easy recipe-will make again! Made exactly as per instructions -dough is very easy to work with...I wanted to add photos but unfortunately allrecipe changed their setting to certain size and it is way too much hassle to redone pics -not very happy with allrecipes set ups - also we able to pencil-make notes on our account with each recipe-I contacted the customer service several times and they said there were working to add it again-but clearly it will never happen since its been now at least  3 years.....I now use another way of storing my recipes...dont like this new set up

I made this and thought it was really good. I love that it can be done in less than an hour. It was very easy to make. Hubby said they were better than Cinnabon! The dough was very sticky as many have said. (I did substitute almond milk since I didn't  have any regular milk on hand.) I put a lot of flour on the board and gently rolled it out. I added some nutmeg to the sugar mix to make the mixture pop. I was able to roll it into a "log" fairly easy. Slicing it was difficult because the slices were sticking to the knife so  I sprayed the knife  with cooking spray and that worked great.  You can eat with or without the icing. They're delicious either way!

This is the ABSOLUTE WORST recipe I have ever used! The dough was too sticky, no matter how much flour I added when mixing as well as when I turned it out to roll into a rectangle. Save yourself some trouble either buy the ones in the refrigerated section at the supermarket or make them the old fashion way with yeast. This recipe is an EPIC FAIL!!

Seeing as it was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls, I'd say they were pretty good. Although I'm the only one eating them so I have no other opinions. 
Recipe said half of the sugar mixture on the bottom of the tray, and the rest in the rolls. I used about 1/4 at the bottom and maybe half the mixture in the rolls, and had 1/4 leftover. Still really good. 
I also made icing out of 1 cup powered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 2 and a 1/2 tablespoons milk.  
Super yummy. Hope my dad comes to visit so I don't end up eating them all.

I wasted all the ingredients and about 45 minutes trying to roll this slimy sticky mess into some semblance of a cinnamon roll. I ended up tossing it in the trash and couldn't even make it to the oven. This coming from someone who spends plenty of time with dough and pastries. Please revise the dough portion of the recipe and triple check the measurements so it makes a dough instead of a pudding.

twas the night before Christmas, a mugger asked me for all my cinnamon rolls, luckily i had these bad boys in my pocket, or else id be deaded. As I was walking home that night I stopped at the super market to get some broccali, but what I saw was some ghost brocoli, the clerk tried to tell me it was cauliflower so I took a long drag of my cigar and said "listen kid I know what I saw"

These were ok, very easy to put together but the flavor was lacking. Next time, I'll add more cinnamon and butter to the filling. II didn't have the sticky dough issue that a lot people have mentioned. These also aren't nearly as fluffy as traditional rolls that use yeast and need to rise but I'd definitely make these again for a quick treat.

I did not like this recipe.  The buns don't rise, they are more like cookie consistency than rolls or buns.   I'll try another with rising dough as these were flat and the cream cheese quantity appears to be too high for the topping.

Really sticky followed advised extra flour and I had to add cinnamon to the dough to give flavor. I ended up with cinnamon Carmel buns instead of roll. Tried to roll it and ended with a mess turned out  with flavor

Like many other reviewers have stated, the dough was incredibly wet and sticky, even despite the fact that I added extra flour. In saying that this was my first time making anything like this. Therefore, I would not recommended this for someone with a similar experience and knowledge in baking to me, as it was quite the challenge to make. However the taste wasn't too bad but they went rolls whatsoever. They were more like sachets with the sugar and cinnamon mix stuffed between a messy and disproportionate layer of dough.

As others have said in reviews the dough is very sticky. Just added 1/2 cup of self rising flour. Worked very well.  My family loved them.

The cinnamon rolls turned out great and I would defiantly make them again. The only problem was that the dough was really sticky so when I kneaded it I added less than a 1/2 cup of additional flour. Thank you for sharing.

They have a biscuit taste so if you're looking for true cinnamon roll taste, make the yeast kind. This is okay if you want to cut out some time. My kids ate them fine.

I really loved the flavor of the dough! But i did cook them on the BBQ grill in a cast iron skillet for 15 minuets in high. Which i thought worked perfectly

Also a tip if you're out of Cream cheese or just don't like it, Powdered sugar with a bit of water tastes great on these.
Thanks for the recipie

Dough is WAY to sticky to be workable. I’ve tried twice and no matter how floured the surfaces are, the moisture of the dough absorbs it, and makes a sticky mess. Had to add 2/3 Cup more flour to the dough to make it workable. Maybe less milk would help instead.
I only used half the sugar mixture and I wasnt a fan of pouring it on the bottom. 
I like to make bigger rolls in a 8x8 glass pan (9 rolls).

I'll give it a five because I'm pretty sure it was my fault the dough roll was to wet causing them to... Well, I'm not adding a photo because nobody needs to see what kind of mess I created. My toddlers and I loved it, especially the cream cheese/butter frosting. The fact that I didn't have to use yeasts makes this a win.

Overall, exactly what I was looking for. Easy and quick cinnamon rolls without all of the rising, kneading and waiting. Because this recipe uses baking powder instead of yeast, it is no fuss and hard to mess up. However, I recommend adding sugar to the dough (I added 1/3 cup) and brushing with butter prior to baking. Also, for gooey and moist cinnamon rolls, pour 1/4 a cup of heavy cream over them prior to baking, and let it soak in before popping in the oven. Great recipe, try it out!

Dough was sticky and impossible to work with. I made this once with no issue and I dont know what i did differently that time vs the last two times i attempted this, but the last two were epic fails. I ended up scraping the sticky dough into the trash. Butter is too expensive to be constantly failing at recipes constantly and im not confident enough in my cooking skills to make modifications. 10/10 will not recommend.

I used oil instead of butter, and i halved the recipe but still used the full egg. Everything turned out fine, I just had to add extra flour to compensate for the extra liquid. :) I would make again, very easy recipe.

First time making a Cinnamon Roll. It turned out well, but they weren't super presentable. Tasted amazing though! I didn't have cream cheese, so I used an alternative glaze made of mostly powered sugar.

I made this for a friend's birthday, he loved them!

EDIT: Looking back at it, this recipe was quite fun to make! I might need to cut back on the sugar though. I recall it was a bit too sweet and my father said so too. My two friends really loved it!

I did not read the reviews first, though I normally do and wish I would've. This was a sticky mess for me. I would not make it again. I agree with another reviewer who said these taste more like biscuits. I followed the recipe exactly. The cream cheese topping was delicious, though. I would not make these again.

Tasty, but the cinnamon rolls didn’t rise much and they lean toward hard/dense rather than fluffy even though we handled the dough gently. I felt like I should have cut them thicker and made fewer, maybe used more baking powder or added baking soda. We did use King Arthur all purpose flour, which someone else mentioned might work well for this recipe, and the dough was sticky but not unworkable with a lot of flour dusting. The real problem was that the rolled-up log was very soft and didn’t hold its shape when cut, even after being chilled in the fridge, so we ended up with oblong shapes instead of rolls. Maybe I should have cut the rolls with a piece of thread or floss?

Next time I make cinnamon rolls, I’ll probably just plan ahead and make yeast ones; this recipe definitely wasn’t fast or easy enough for me to justify making it in place of another quick bread like muffins.

Started with only 1/2 C milk since most folks said they were too sticky to work with. Ended up adding the other  1/4 C.  Didn't add the  sugar to the dough that was called for in the recipe but instead added some of the cinnamon sugar mix to it. Still had lots of cinnamon sugar left over as it just seemed to be too much.  Floured our surface and had to add more, as it is a sticky dough. Lots of icing left over. Some of the kids thought it was still too sweet and reminded them more of a scone than a cinnamon roll.  Would decrease the cinn/sugar mix by half next  time.

The flavor was good, and I had issues with the stickiness of the dough as well, I rolled it out between parchment paper. I'm thinking my butter may have been too soft , I'm going to try it again with room temperature butter instead of softened .   I also found the filling quite a bit, but that's not a big deal and can be easily cut back.  I put the roll in the freezer before slicing, so the dough was firmer and didn't collapse while slicing.

This made very little dough and it stuck to the counter and ruined it almost while we were rolling it, it did NOT make 18 rolls, it only made 10 and they were tiny. They have three times the amount of sugar and butter that it needs. These may taste good but don’t turn out well and aren’t healthy.

I was reading a few of the reviews and my dough wasn't very sticky like the rest. It rolled out perfectly! I did happen to have too much of the sugar and cinnamon mix though. I also made 9 rolls instead of 18 because for me, they were too thin. Other than that these are quick, easy, and I will definitely be making these again!!

I've made these twice now. The first time, the dough was insanely sticky. I couldn't even roll it into rolls. I ended up dropping chunks of the sticky stuff into the pan and cooking it. They definitely didn't look very pretty, but they tasted amazing. The second time, I added about a cup extra flour. I also added finely chopped apples into the filling. The result was delicious! The dough was much easier to work with, though they still didn't end up looking perfect. They tasted great, and I will probably make again!

I usually don't write reviews but I followed this recipe to the very last step but when I dumped it out on my floured surface it was a mushy lump. It stuck to everything even though I kept adding flour. In the end I got hard cinnamon blobs.

Very easy simple recipe. The dough is extremely sticky so I just kept adding flour and kneeding the dough until it was workable. I added walnuts and raisis also.

Do need to ensure that you have extra flour to roll it out and knead it, so that it's not so stucky.

I was craving cinnamon buns, and didn't have any yeast, so I tried this recipe. 

As others have said, I also had to add more flour to make the dough workable with a rolling pin. 

The dough is a bit heavier than you'd get with a tradition yeast recipe.  I cut down the bake time to 17 minutes. 

Would make again!

I'm not sure about the people that had the problems with wet dough. For me it was fine.  However, this was more of a scone than a cinnamon roll.  I was looking for something to make my daughter in the morning and this just wasn't it.  If I want to make a cinnamon scone, I'll make a cinnamon scone.  This is definitely not a cinnamon bun.

Tastes AMAZING!!! Definitely make the frosting though. It makes it even better, and doesn't take that long to whip up. You don't have to use a blender either! The only downside is when you're rolling the dough and cutting it. Very gooey and hard to do.

The dough was very runny when made per recipe.  I had to add more flour, which then threw off the baking powder ratio for sufficient rising.  They did not rise very much and did not brown at all.  The flavor was ok, but I think I will find another recipe in the future

The dough is sticky even after I added more flour. Really, just a sticky mess. I accidentally said I made it twice -but , no offense, I wouldn't make this twice. Needs a lot of tweaking to be "easy".

These were absolutely HORRIBLE! Dough was way too stick I had to use about 3 more cups of flower and as soon as I stuck them in the oven they didn’t rise and we’re burning faster than what they were cooking as of right now I will stick to buying the premade ones

I've made a lot of cinnamon buns, and this was by far the worst recipe I've used. It was way too sticky so the dough fell apart when trying to roll it into a log shape prior to cutting the rolls. I literally had to wrestle them into the pan. The final "rolls" were the consistency of biscuits. Next time I will go back to my recipe that saves time by only requiring one rise.

Added pecans. Flavor great. My husband thought it was more cake like than rolls. I thought it had texture of rolls. Dough very sticky. Had great difficulty rolling. Added extra flour & it did not help much. Even put in freezer 10 minutes to firm dough. Very difficult to roll. Would not use this recipe again.

I am diabetic so I revised this recipe using Splenda sugar mix and Splenda brown sugar mix. The dough was indeed sticky but I found that using a LOT of flour on my rolling surface helped immensely with that. They tasted really good, they were more like biscuits than a traditional cinnamon roll and the dough only managed to yield about 6 rolls. Will make again but will double it for bigger appetites.

I just finished making it, thank you for giving such a simple recipe!!! ^_^ 

My house smells INCREDIBLE ??
But, if I changed one thing, it was in how much of the milk/egg mixture i poured into the flour. If I'd never kneaded dough before, I would've followed through and ended up with a very sticky dough. 
Using my hands helped too. :) Thanks once again!

I added raisins and vanilla to the recipe and substituted with Almond Milk .  

Oh and I sifted the flour.  Which I hoped would be fluffier. 

I am really shocked as to how good these came out.

Quick, easy, tasty substitute for cinnamon buns. Soft,yet denser than a bun. I did have to add a little extra flour to the dough. Heavily floured counter top. Rolled out perfectly. Lifted each section of rolled dough with a metal BBQ spatula as I rolled it up to make sure it was not sticking to counter. Added crasins. Next time will add finely chopped nuts.Turned out very well. Will make again.  Omitted butter from icing and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.

Loved the cream cheese icing! definitely the best part. The bad part came when I took the rolls out of the oven at exactly 20 minutes. They were way to hard. Still very delicious though.

Great recipe! I did want to cut down on the sugar so I subbed the 1/2 cup of sugar that went into the filling with a mashed banana. It was delicious (and yes it tasted like bananas).

They came out really good! The dough is really sticky but to remedy this we just added more flour every time it started to feel sticky. This helped a lot and the finished result was delicious. Definitely saving this and using it often!

Delicious cinnamon rolls, but found the sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan just stuck to the pan so will probably skip that step next time.

horrible.  Dough was too runny after adding a lot more flour.  Plus it says take 1/4 C butter (which is 4 T) and divide it, using 2 T for pan and 3 T for dough.  That doesn't add up.  Will not make it again.

I woke up craving cinnamon rolls. I tried this recipe and it satisfied by craving. I used cooking spray for the bottom of the pan instead of adding butter. We halved the frosting and still had enough. Instead of 18 pieces, I cut this into 12 pieces.

That was the stickiest dough I have ever worked with!  When I tried to make the rolls, the dough completely fell apart and stuck to the counter, so I ended up with cinnamon sugar blobs rather than cinnamon rolls.

Great recipe. It is a more biscuit-like cinnamon roll, but still very tasty. The dough was slightly wet, but for anyone used to working with bread and pie doughs, it isn't a big problem. Just add more flour. I forgot to roll mine out on parchment paper for a tighter roll. I'll definitely do that next time! I also halved the frosting recipe and still had plenty to cover the tops of the rolls with some left over.

I left out the egg based on other reviews.  For being "quick", these were still a lot of work.  The cream cheese icing was way too much, that part could be cut in half.  The rolls themselves tasted more like biscuits or bread with cinnamon sugar, and the sugar was crunchy.  Definitely tasty, but not delicious or worth making again.

Followed the recipe, and yes very sticky,  but DELICIOUS!  will definitely make again but with less milk, maybe 1/2 C rather than 3/4. Used quite a bit of flour and still could not achieve a roll, but more like a fold hahaha.  I added a little cinnamon into the icing for personal taste .. only 2 tweaks for me:  less milk and cinnamon in the icing.

Easy and yummy.  Flour your surface heavily before rolling the dough.

THE QUEST IS OVER!  I've been hunting for a no-yeast cinnamon roll recipe for YEARS and this is THE ONE!!!!! Easy, quick and delicious!  I do suggest, echoing the sentiment of others, that you add 1/8 c flour while mixing to prevent sticking.

The dough was extremely sticky and difficult to roll.  I used additional flour but it only helped so much.  Therefore I couldn't separate the dough to make buns so it came out more like a blob in the pan, it was tasty, however.

It's a shortbread recipe since I didn't have yeast.  I added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dough itself, since I wanted it to have that flavor throughout the eating process.   I found that the dough did turn out very sticky, while rolling it on parchment paper by hand at first I kept adding flour to it until it started to behave like proper dough.  After probably 3 handfuls of flour it began to roll correctly.  The only problem I had was after rolling it the end pieces just turned out more like biscuits.  The other ones I cut up turned out just fine though.  It was a delicious recipe I'd rate a 5/7.

I'm 16 I made it in my class it came out great!!! It was really sticky at first, but I put flour on my hands and the bored and kneaded it with flour. It was great . The only thing I would change is not putting so much of the filling on the bottom of the pan.  Other than that you will enjoy definitely enjoy it.

Made this for grandchildren too impatient to wait for rising! The dough a sticky, but on a well floured surface and sprinkling flour on top of the dough, was able to roll out just fine. A scraper was helpful as I rolled It up, for any areas that were stuck to the cupboard. I would not add more sugar to the dough, as others have noted, unless you aren't going to frost them. There was plenty of sweetness in the filling and frosting!

I liked this recipe. It was quick and pretty easy. I did make a couple changes. I added some cinnamon to the dough and used almond milk with a little non dairy creamer (dairy free living). The dough was soft but manageable and roll i used my (dont know technical name) scraler thing to help it come easily from my counter. The rolls came out a little mini for me. I use a muffin pan to cook them in. I also have never added cinnamon sugar mix to the bottom and loved it!
