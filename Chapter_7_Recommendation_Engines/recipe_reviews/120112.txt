I used a can of whole cherry tomatoes where I mean't to use it for another recipe I was making simultaneously. Though I don't think that should have changed the taste. The soup tasted like Ragu sauce witch I can't stand. This was a pot I cooked for hubby, and he liked it. Probably won't make again.

I'm not a big soup fan but after looking at the ingredients decided to try it out.  I cooked the meat with the onion, garlic (doubled the garlic), cayenne (we like our food spicy), salt, pepper & green pepper so that the meat wouldnâ€™t be so bland.  I also added a can of tomato sauce.  I left out the croutons & also found adding some parmesan cheese to your individual bowl rounds off the flavor quite nicely.  This is a soup that can be eaten with or w/o the noodles.  My husband has told me I need to make this at least once a week and the kids love it too!  Oh, since I make a double batch, I don't cook the noodles in the soup (don't care for soggy/over done noodles).

This was a delicious soup and very easy to make. I substituted bulk Italian sausage for the ground beef and it was terrific - will definitely make again.

I had to change the recipe a smidge because I only had one can of diced tomatoes.  I used a can of tomato sauce in lieu of the other one.  I also used one green and one red bell pepper.  This was very tasty, and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  The peppers add some sweetness, and this smells delicious while cooking.  My kids didn't really care for it, but anything with tomatoes and bell peppers usually isn't popular with them.

Ecellent! I did add a can of tomato sauce and cooked the pasta separate. A great soup after a New England Snow Storm. 6" today.

Very easy and tasted great! Brought it to a church Halloween party (where there were at least 20 other crockpots of soups etc) and mine was gone within minutes!

This is a very tasty soup!  I doubled the garlic (always do) and added a few dashes of cayenne pepper because we like things spicy.  I'll be bringing this to work everyday for lunch!

Eh, I thought this soup was ok... I added more seasonings bc it seemed pretty bland to me. I sauteed the green pepper, onion and a red pepper I added with the meat. It needed more liquid- was not very soup-like. It was really easy- that's always a plus in my book!

Very good, hearty soup!  We skipped the croutons and had skillet cornbread on the side.  I scooped a dollop of ricotta cheese onto each serving.  Plenty of leftovers for freezing, from my family of 4.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I had to alter it for 60 people.  It was a big hit too!!!  Not one complaint!!!  Thank you for submitting this one.  Everyone loves the heartiness of this soup.  It's thick and full of flavor.

I enjoyed the flavor of this soup but mine turned out more like chili since there wasn't much water after the  pasta was done.  I will make this again and next time add 7 cups of water instead of 5.  The croutons were a nice touch.

As we do not eat beef often, I used this recipe minus the beef, and minus the gr. peppers. It was great! This can be a great vegetarian pasta dish.
