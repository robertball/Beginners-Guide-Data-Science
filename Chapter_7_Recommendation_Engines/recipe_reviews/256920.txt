This is great. I like smoothies with oats. The key is to blend the oats first as directed. I used a small whole frozen banana and just a big squirt of honey instead of agave. This is a good size serving and is a filling breakfast.

To make this more like the Tropical Smoothie version I added about 1\4 c almonds, 2 Medjool dates (in place of agave), cinnamon to taste and about 1-2 tsps chia seeds or less. I love the coconut milk. I ususally use Watkins coconut flavoring to taste. This is guiltless decadence.

This is an awesome recipe!! I substituted some though. I had no Silk milk so I used regular milk. I did 1 tablespoon of regular peanut butter. It is nice that it has no protein powder in it. Tastes like it should. Banana and peanut butter smoothie.

I loved this smoothie!!! I had never had PB powder in a drink and I think is fabulous considering the calories are lower. Simple and delicious.

Delicious! I didn't have a frozen banana, but can see where it would be welcome. Having used rolled buckwheat oats instead of regular oatmeal, I needed a bit more coconut milk.  It tastes like you are drinking a peanut butter and banana sandwich. Yum! Thank you for the recipe.
