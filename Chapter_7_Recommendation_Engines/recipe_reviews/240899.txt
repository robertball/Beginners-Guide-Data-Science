Awful. I had to bake it for 40 minutes longer to get it to set at all. Still a runny, big mess. This recipe just does not work. What a waste of all that  maple syrup.

This pie was delicious! A fun maple syrup recipe to make as spring approaches. This version is very sweet. I’ve tried similar recipes that don’t add brown sugar...So it all depends on your sweet-tooth!The batter is very liquid as you pour it into the unbaked crust. As a result the crust was a bit soggy when serving. Next time I will try baking the pie 5-10 minutes longer than the recipe says.
