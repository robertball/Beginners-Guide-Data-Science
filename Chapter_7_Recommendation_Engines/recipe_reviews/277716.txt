This makes a good, basic bread pudding.  I mixed all the ingredients, with the exception of the bread cubes, for even distribution.  I then added the bread cubes and mixed so the bread would be evenly moistened.

I accidentally used heavy cream instead of half and half (a delightful mistake), and added a teaspoon of bourbon along with the vanilla. 
I so wish I'd taken a photo of my neighbor's first bite! I'd have taken a selfie of my first bite too, except my hats were busy spooning up my second bite. 
This was my first ever time of making bread pudding, a dessert I've always loved, and it is both very simple, and the best I've ever eaten.
