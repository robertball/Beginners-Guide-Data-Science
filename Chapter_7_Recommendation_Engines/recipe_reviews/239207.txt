For those who are having problems with rising, add and extra 1/4 cup of flour and decrease the milk to 1/2 cup.  The main  recipe is for the environment I live in.  Sorry about that.  Gluten Free Version: subbing 150 grams of gluten free all purpose flour and left out the salt (all for health issues).

This cupcake was a disappointment for me. First off the cupcakes just would not bake!  The cupcakes just started going over the edge and became hard on the edges! Finally when they did cook I took them out to cool and they started to sink down and became very dense! These cupcakes did taste very good though. It was not to sweet and it had a good balance, the amount of carrots were not over powering either. Over all these cupcake were really not something i would make again.

These muffins have become a staple in my house.  My family and I enjoy these very much.  I make gluten free and gluten versions of these with no problems in either. They are light and delicate with the cinnamon adding a nice touch reminding you of Thanksgiving and Holiday time.  I've been making these for months (when they were still unpublished) and the outcome is always consistent.  The walnuts add a nice texture.  The sugar/flour ratio is right on, never too sweet.  I recently made a batch omitting the butter, adding 1 cup of sugarless "Chunky Pumpkin Apple Butter from sueb" on the AR site.  The pumpkin and cinnamon really sparkle and the result is a bit more dense but still very good.  They taste like light pumpkin bread with walnuts.  Thank you Bobby Susan for the versatile recipe.

To add to my previous note: given this recipe didn’t turn out a success for “cupcakes” I was able to use the rest for the batter to create cookies! The cookies were way better. All I did was scoop the batter using the standard cookie scoop, placed it on parchment paper and they cooked for 15 minutes. Consistency was prefect for a cookie!!

The batter tasted delicious but the cupcakes turned horrible... The outside was rock hard, and they were sunken! The inside though is moist and delicious.

I've made these twice, and both times they have fallen in the middle. I have accounted for altitude, but they still look awful. The taste is fantastic, however, so I'm going to keep trying for a successful fix.

It smelled amazing, but the cupcakes wouldn't rise. They ended up being a really weird shape at the drips off

I made these cupcakes and my family loved them. I also make the boxed kind. These won hands down. They gobbled them up. I will definitely make them again.

This recipe was very good and I will definitely make it again.   I didn't finely grind the walnuts though as I like the crunch they add so just chopped up to a consistency I liked.  They are moist and bake up perfectly.  I did find them a bit on the sweet side but I tend to say that about all cupcake recipes so will be cutting back the sugar by about a half cup next time around.  Thanks for sharing!

I love these cupcakes! I just replaced the walnuts with coconut and white ghirdelli chocolate, it still came out amazing.

These were Delicious! Very Soft and moist. Just my opinion, I thought it was a bit too sweet. I would add more carrots and maybe less sugar. Still delicious, followed recipe exactly. Thank you for the recipe, will continue to make.

These were ok and all got eaten, but nothing to rave about. I thought they were a little dense. The cinnamon saved these so if you make them then keep that in it, otherwise they may be a little boring. Might try another recipe in hopes for an amazing cupcake.

I was really exited to try these but I made the batter (good) then the cupcakes themselves were horrible. They would not cook!

Made these twice and both times the center sunk in and wouldn't cook.  The edges got super crispy and were inedible. Disappointed :((

The edges were tasty, probably due to the sugar concentration.  Otherwise very sunk in and gooey, even after cooking longer than recipe calls for.

It made a pretty big batch (more than the 12 cupcakes it said) and was really light and fluffy and tasted good, the batter had overflowed each cup and never rose. (I filled them 2/3 full.) The batter was still wet, so I let it cook a little longer, but the longer they cooked, the more than started to sink in the middle.

It's just okay - don't especially like the ground walnuts - half the fun of carrot cake/cupcakes is the crunchiness of the nuts in them.
