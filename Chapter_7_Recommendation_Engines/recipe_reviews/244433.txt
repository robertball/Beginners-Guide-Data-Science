I used the store brand chocolate pudding mix, and the only change was to add a little chocolate syrup. It definitely has a pudding flavor (surprise!) and the texture at 5 degrees F is like granite, but let it sit out until it's about 12 degrees F and it's just right - creamy and silky. As it warms further, it becomes very pudding like. I'd have given it 4 stars, but I wanted to offset the unrealistic 1 star review. You're just making pudding with twice the half and half instead of milk, so if it had a bad flavor, I'd blame one of the ingredients, not the recipe.

Quick, easy, and versatile. The flavor of the pudding was not very strong. Less fat would allow flavor to come through better maybe. Trying milk next time.

There's a few reviews saying it was bland or slimy, I didn't have that issue at all. I used the full 3.5 ounces of instant pudding mix (2 boxes sugar free chocolate fudge and one sugar free cheesecake which was 1 oz), full fat half and half and a dash of almond extract. I only had 30 oz of half and half so I subbed 2 oz of heavy cream. Mixed it well before putting into my Cuisinart self chilling I've cream maker. 35 minutes later, I have silky delicious keto icecream. Very very sweet, can't tell it's sugar free and a small serving was very satisfying.  Think about your ingredients, use full fat liquid and you'll love it.

Tasted like frozen instant pudding. If I were to go through the effort to use my ice cream machine I'll make real ice cream. It's just as easy but tastes much better.

I used Oreo pudding mix and added crushed mint Oreos at the end of churning. The mint added the extra sweetness and flavor it was otherwise lacking. I will use this recipe again with different flavors, tweaking as necessary. It is a quick easy way to make flavored ice cream.

It didn't work for us at all. I made exactly as written with vanilla Jell-O brand pudding. The texture is slimy and it leaves an awful aftertaste. I really wanted to like this, sorry.
