This was very good. The sauce works perfectly with the nutty flavour of the black rice. I imagine that with brown rice this would be quite good too, but the soy, Sriracha, and lime go so well with the nuttiness that is so unique to black rice. This recipe jumped to 6 stars with the addition of a habanero pepper. :-)
