This was a great change from the normal. It looked beautiful. Next time I will add more carrots and fewer onions. Other than that it was great.

This was excellent! Even my 4 year old loves it. I made it for the first time tonight. I did only make 1 pie. Instead of only using 3 eggs I threw in 4. I also added some extra spinach. I used a combination of montery jack and pepper jack cheeses to give it a little more kick, and I also put some thinly sliced tomato on top to make it look pretty, tasted good too!! I will definitely be making this again!!

My first quiche, and what a keeper this is.  I used the food processor to mince the onions finely.  I substituted fresh organic red chard shredded by food processor very finely for the spinach (one whole bunch), and fried it with the onions and garlic.  Didn't use any carrot.  Used half cheddar and half organic emmenthal cheese.  YUM!!!  I was truly impressed by this recipe.  The quiche turned out with a good consistency, not runny at all, after 28 minutes in a convection oven.  We couldn't stop eating it, so between two thin adults, we finished one pie.  I couldn't really taste the red chard.  Unfortunately, not a hit with my two children under 4, even though I left out all pepper.  Thank you for the relatively easy and delicious recipe.

i'm a college student working on a low budget and in a cramped shared kitchen, and if this recipe turned out this well under those circumstances, it's good for everyone!  i made this without ever having made quiche before...it was delightfully simple and tastes amazing.  this is an absolutely perfect recipe, thank you for sharing it and making my night!  :)

I think this recipe needed some cream or milk to give it a more fluffy texture. It didn't fill my 2 pie crusts and they looked so sad. However, the taste was good, maybe a bit too much nutmeg. I also added diced red peppers and split the cheese - 1 cup sharp cheddar and 1 cup muenster. I also used fresh spinach and just added a teeny bit of water to the pan for a few minutes so it could wilt.

Great quiche! I made the mistake of using deep dish pie plates and I didn't have enough for 2 quiches. I put tomatoes on top and it really added great flavor. I will add this to the rotation!

I made this with the Rice Quiche Crust, and the combination was fantastic. The only thing was that it needed to be in the oven longer. The quiche soaks into the crust, making it the same as a regular one, but without the edges burning. The amount of cheese made it kind of oily, so a bit harder to tell when done. Will probably save more or the cheese to throw on top near the end of baking to avoid that in the future. Fantastic!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! I fried the onion together with the garlic and used a mini food processor to chop up the carrots (instead of shredding them).

Good flavor and texture (not runny at all). My 3 year old NEVER eats spinach and ate his entire serving. I would like it with a little more egg, but I will definitely make it again.

This was my first-ever attempt at a quiche and I was pleasantly surprised! I halfed the recipe since it is just me and followed it minus the onion (hate onions with a passion!) and red pepper flakes, as I didn't have any on hand. I will definitely be making this one again!

Follow-up: I made this again since I had ingredients leftover only made with 4 eggs per shell instead of 3 and loved it even more!

I guess I'm more of a creamy quiche lover.   It sounded good so I tried it. I was skeptical of making this dish without any cream or milk in recipe, but went ahead with it. The egg did its job and brought it together.  The flavor was spinach and that was it. Maybe I will try it with a little milk and hea,vy cream.

I was looking for a good base quiche recipe so I made a few changes to it.  I gave it 5 stars because it is not fair to rate it poorly if it was due to my own changes.  I used fresh spinach and added broccoli, diced ham and about 1/4 cup milk.  Even with the additions, I felt it was not quite enough for to 9" pans.  It turned out very slim and probably could have made one hefty quiche.  I baked the crust for about 5mins before adding the insides, as this allowed it to cook fully in 30mins.  The flavor was amazing!  I will make again with either more ingredients or just one crust.

I love this recipe... but with a minor change.  I make it for one pie and use 4 eggs, maybe a little less spinach and more carrot.  My daughter who would never touch a spinach leaf let alone eat one, enjoys this dish.

This was a keeper. I wanted a base recipe which I could use to alter to the items I had on hand. Instead of spinach, I used fresh mushroom, fresh chives, one small tomato, garlic powder, onion, and carrots. I halved the recipe, but used 5 eggs instead of three and it  turned out fantastic. I also used a mix of pepper jack cheese with sharp cheddar and the flavor knocked our sock off. It was the only time my husband did NOT add extra spices to his meal. It felt like victory!! Thanks for this great recipe.
 A tip for those whose crust isn't turning out- I baked my dough for about 5 minutes to set it before adding the rest. It turned out perfect.

Made this last night and LOVED IT! I admit to changing the recipe slightly by adding about 2/3 c. of skim milk. Without it, the mixture just didn't seem "quichey" to me. Had it not been for that, I'd have given it 5 stars. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. We'll be eating this on a regular basis. YUM!

First attempt at quiche....so rating this one is hard because I have nothing to compare it to.  Anyway.....family ate it up so this is a 4 star!  Only thing is, is that the crust didn't get done as another reviewer said.  I will bake it for a little bit before putting the filling in next time.

Delicious!  I wanted to modify the recipe to make one med-large quiche, so I sauteed 1 small onion, 1 small potato shredded, and 2 med. carrots with the spinach and garlic.  I added 4 eggs and 1c. shredded cheese and poured it all into a homemade pie crust.  It was very tasty!

I am a quiche lover and I so did not enjoy this dish. 2 pies wasted for my household.  It was all spinach. I used all the exact ingredients minus the red pepper flakes because I as hoping to feed my infant son some. I doubt that would have improved the dish much. It was very dense and it tasted like spinach pie minus flavors. Couldn't taste the garlic or onion. I was dissapointed :( Not something we will be making again. I'd say add a little cream and use less spinach maybe this dish has hope.

My family loved this quiche!  I adjusted the measurements and only made one quiche.  Should have made two so we'd have leftovers or another to freeze!  The adjustments I made: I used lots of fresh spinach (added some water to pan so it would wilt better), half a red bell pepper, three cloves of garlic and added 1/4 milk to the egg.  I sautéed all the veggies and mixed the egg, spices in a separate bowl.  Then added the cheese to the eggs, then the warm veggie mixture.  Mixed all of it up and added it the pie pan (I used the Pillsbury pie mix.  Baked it for 40 min and let it cool a little before serving.  This recipe is a great base and  plan on trying other vegetable combinations with it (broccoli, tomato) and other cheese.

This wasn't very good.  It makes a very shallow quiche, and since the recipe doesn't call for any milk, the filling is fairly stiff.  The bottom crust doesn't bake in the time required to set the filling.  The taste is only okay.  I wouldn't make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I poured the entire contents into one deep dish pie crust (9 inch).  It took an extra 5 minutes in the oven.  It baked up beautifully! It was easy to make, and the carrots mixed in with the spinach gives this quiche stunning presentation.  This is a great brunch or special occasion dish.

This was great even though I made a few changes--I used about 1/2 cup of frozen onions and didn't saute them and instead of 2 pie shells I used a 9x13 pan and made a potato flake/butter "quiche crust" I use quite often.  This was great for a vegetarian dinner but I can see how it'd be great for brunch!

This was ok but I thought there was way too much spinach. I like my quiche where you can taste the egg.

This was my first quiche, but definately not my last!  I never knew how simple quiches were.  This recipe is a snap and everyone loved it I subbed the cheese for a good sharp cheddar as that is what we had on hand and it was great.

This quiche was very good.  I didn't even taste the carrots; I used reserved carrot pulp from making carrot juice a few days ago.  The filling didn't come to the top of the pie crusts as I had expected, but it was really good anyway.  I will make this again.

good flavours but I would drain the thawed spinach as I found it too liquidy. I added asparagus and cheese on top too.

I made this tonight with the two pie crusts (thanks for the tip!). I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so shredded up a bit of marble (maybe half a cup, all I had left) and used about 2-2.5 cups of ricotta. It turned out fantastic! Next time I'll make sure to get Monterey Jack but will probably also add some ricotta as well! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great meal with a tossed salad. I took one of the other reviewers suggestion and put sliced tomatoes on top, then sprinkled a little bit more cheese on top the tomatoes. Also made it crust less in a baking dish. I will make this again!

I made this for Pie Day (3/14...I live in a house full of geeks.) It was a huge success. We ate one for breakfast that day and then ate the other one for breakfast a few days later. I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I used cheddar, which we all prefer anyway. I also used fresh spinach rather than frozen since we rarely buy frozen veggies. It was amazing. I will definitely be making this again, though I'll probably freeze the second one instead of keeping it in the fridge.

I only made a half batch for 1 pie shell, it was good, made exactly as written with maybe a little extra cheese.  I thought it was a bit dry and not quite as fluffy as I expected. Next time I will hadd a bit of cream, milk or half 'n half.

This was just O.K. to me, but my twin toddlers are eating it really well, so I'm giving 4 stars. I also give it 4 stars for keeping well in the fridge for 4 days for quick homemade re-heat breakfasts. I didn't like the nutmeg in there, it brings out the carrots too much.

I've mad this 3 times already!  It's become a part of my standard repertoire.  I love that it's cheesy & good without having fatty cream or butter.  It needs the eggs for protein & to hold it together. My kids love it!  I also brought it to a potluck lunch at work and everybody raved about it.  Thanks!!!

FABULOUS! My first quiche ever to not come out runny. Didn't have carrots so used 16 oz. bag of frozen spinach instead. Also added 1/4 cup milk and precooked crusts. Will use this recipe from now on! Thank you!

This was a really good but easy quiche!  (Adjusted recipe to serve 9, and it made one 9 in pie)  My roomie and I devoured the whole thing during dinner last night and breakfast this morning.  haha  I added mushrooms, as well, which I always think HAVE to be in quiche.  :-)  Also used swiss along with the jack cheese.  Will make this again, for sure.  May use more egg and a deep dish pie pan next time, to make it a bit fluffier.  And yes, it does take longer than 30 min. to cook.

I have made this recipe a few times now.  I pretty much followed the recipe the first time, except I used a bunch of fresh spinach and halved the ingredients to only make one pie.  I have since tried it with variations on different vegetables added to the mix depending on what I have in the fridge.  Grated zucchini and carrot one time and mushrooms another time.   I also use frozen puff pastry sheets instead of pie crusts cooked for 10 minutes on 185degreesC before adding the filling because thats all I keep handy. I love this recipe, its so easy and delicious.  It's become part of my rotation. Thanks!

My husband who hates quiche had seconds!  However, I did not follow the recipe:  I used one package of fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  Since this was less than half of the spinach the recipe called for, I only made one quiche, not two.  I used half the cheese, but all of the onions, carrots, etc. as called for in the recipe for two quiches.

Great for lunch with a glass of milk. This recipe is one of my favorite on a cold day because it has substance and fills me up. I generally add a little cream to smooth it out a bit, but other than that I don't change it much.

This is a KEEPER. I made this "crustless" by using pre-coooked white rice (1/8th cup per desired servings) instead of the pie crusts and tossed some parmesan cheese (n addition to the Jack) into the mixture (just what I do).      I also used 4 eggs -- rather than 3 -- for every 8 portions I prepared. I served this (along side of other dishes) at my "faux Thanksgiving dinner" this past weekend. I don't know exactly who DEVOURED it (might have been "all of them"), but I can tell you that at the end of our "faux T-day dinner" there were NO leftovers of this particular offering. Enjoy!

Awesome!  I only had about ¼ of a bar of cracker barrel Vermont cheddar (white).  So I mixed the eggs, seasoning, and a couple of tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese with half a box of silken tofuand just under ½ a cup of soy milk.  Then mixed that with the spinach mixture; poured it into my pie shell and sprinkled the top with the little bit of cheese I grated and a little more grated parmesan cheese.

this was good.  I followed the directs and didn't really change much, maybe just added more carrots.
But I felt like it was missing something.  It was good and I'll make it again.  I like that it makes 2 pies so we can have it later in the week for leftover dinner.

I made this four times in two weeks!  It was a big hit during Thanksgiving.
