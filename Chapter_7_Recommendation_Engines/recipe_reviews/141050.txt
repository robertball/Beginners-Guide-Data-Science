These tasted very fresh! I accidently bought wonton wrappers as opposed to egg roll wrappers so mine were small and thick skinned but still delicious. I substituted vanilla greek style yogurt for the mayonnaise because I used these as a dessert and I just can't eat mayonnaisse. I also srinkled them with some cinnamon sugar right out of the fryer. I served them on a key lime sauce to cut the sweetness of the mango.

I tried this with the mayonnaise first and then I tried it with Greek yogurt as Grifo suggested. I prefer it with Greek yogurt but everybody else in my family liked the mayo better. I think its a great dessert item once you sprinkle some sugar on top or provide a dipping sauce to go with it. Thanks for the neat idea dapan!

I made dim sum for my family looked around for a bunch of appetizers/desserts started cooking at around noon and had dinner served at around 5:30 (with the gelato still in the machine but we were going to have that last anyways). These spring rolls possibly the first fried thing I've made by sticking them in a pot full of boiling oil turned out g-r-e-a-t! It might help that I love mango and so does my family but we all loved them. It was the overall favorite of that dinner (I think they liked the edamame dumplings better but I hated them so that makes them drop down in overall popularity:P). One thing I noticed is that they were hot and hot mango isn't the BEST thing ever. That's why I gave it 4 stars.. But dapan - this is a good recipe! I think it's the best possible way to serve mango... in a spring roll.:P

This was...ok. The hot mango flavor and the combination of the soft fruit with the crunchy exterior were nice but I'm not sure how well the flavors went together. I also kept taking a bite and then inadvertently pulling the whole mango slice out of the shell. I'm not sure that I wouldn't have just enjoyed my mangoes more fresh.

These are great dessert wraps. The Mayo was replaced with 1 tsp unflavored Greek Yogurt. The whole taste profile after frying was sweet and creamy like a warm and crunchy mango smoothie. We will be making more of these for the holidays.
