Very tasty, and easy to make. You have to make sure you squeeze the excess water out of the eggplant otherwise it is a bit soupy. Really enjoyed this one. Instead of crumbling cornbread on top I just pored the batter directly in. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

This was awesome.  My husband, who is very picky, loves it.  It even freezes well, if you want to make two at a time.

This was fantastic.  I will definitely make this again!  Next time I will mix cornbread into the casserole and maybe add more cheese.  Great comfort food!

I used crushed crackers for my top just becuase it was what I had on hand. Mine came out a little watery so make sure you drain that eggplant REALLY REALLY well! Otherwise it tasted great. Personally I'd add more cheese.

I was very disappointed with the way this turned out.  My husband thought it was okay, but I found it to be very blah.  The kids were not thrilled at all.  The one nice thing about it was that I did have everything on hand and didn't have to make a special trip to the store.  At least we tried it, but not again.  Thanks anyway!

This was absolutely the best!  My husband loved it and he is by far no eggplant fan.  I made it as is and will do that over and over and over again.

Thought this recipe was pretty good.  The texture wasn't the best, but like another reviewer said, I will try and squeeze more water out of the eggplant next time.  Has a stuffingy taste which is good.  Even used leftovers as a side (better the next day). PS I also just poured the corn bread batter over top and it cooked nicely!

I made this recipe because I had an eggplant going bad and had all these ingredients.  I poured batter over the top rather than crumbs... used less cheese.  This was tasty, but the eggplant was drowned out and I feel there are better ways to accentuate its flavor.  Also this is a really unhealthy way to eat a healthy food!  Anyway, good recipe, but won't make this again.  Thanks Mimi!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  In addition to the eggplant, we added a bunch of fresh spinach and used cream of celery soup.  My husband is Indian, so to find compromise in traditional American casseroles recipes, he adds the spices to the flavor/spiciness that he prefers.  So with this recipe, we added Cayenne pepper, curry, turmeric, and tomato spice.  We baked the cornbread batter on top of the casserole and it was good.  We both got out of this recipe what we both wanted: Me - casserole, cheese, and cornbread, Husband - Indian spices & fresh eggplant and spinach.

I was going to leave the mushroom soup out but then I decided at the last minute to run to the store and get it.  To me this was a fatal mistake.  It smelled so good before I put the mushroom soup in.  In my opinion, if you're going to fix unhealthy vegetables, it better be really yummy.  I did not find this good at all and my husband wouldn't touch it.  Sorry. If I fix it again I will fix it without the mushroom soup and with less sage.

This dish was superb. I left out the sage and other more exotic spices and resorted to plain old comfort seasonings. I added a bit of chicken broth as well but was careful not to make it to "liquidy". My family loved it and so did our neighbors. I've made it a regular.

My husband and I really liked this casserole. My 2yr old son however did not. We think he didn't like the texture of everything. I didn't drain all of the water out of the eggplant. I added another cup of cheese and another cut 1/2 cup of the corn bread. Turned out pretty good.

Not  4 because i changed it a little to what i had lying around...instead of cream of mushroom i used cream of celery and as others suggested i used corn bread batter, for which i spiced up with a lil cayenne pepper and cinnamon.  Overall I really liked this...i didnt know what to expect but i was very nice and make good left overs!!!!!!!

This was wonderful. Worthy of a holiday meal and a definite crowd pleaser. I liked it a lot with cheddar but next time will try it with swiss since that is our favorite cheese. I'm for sure adding it to my Thanksgiving menu. Thanks!

This is really excellent.  I have to admit I was a bit surprised at how good this dish actually is, given that the ingredients all seemed to me to be a bit less than inspiring.  But put them all together and, wow!  I'm also not a big fan of cheddar cheese, but have found that this dish works just as well substituting chopped or grated swiss cheese. Very nice!

I found this recipe to be quite tasteful.   Didnt have cornbread so I substituted cornbread stuffing mix.  I dont see that this is an unhealthy dish as per other reviewers opinions. Also eggplant tends to take on the other flavours in a dish such as this.  and my husband liked it too

My $.02.... Didn't want mushy. That type of veggie casserole HAS caused my husband 40 years of hating summer squash. So I humbly suggest the following adaptation.  Place eggplant, spices and cubed butter in 13x9 glass dish (oiled), and microwave for 6 min.  Use half can soup add eggs and cheese. Spread mixture over eggplant. Pour jiffy cornbread batter over top smoothed out casserole and bake for 8 fewer minutes than suggested. Dish has texture of grilled portabellas.  Yum.

Just okay.  I was excited to try it, but you can barely taste the eggplant.  Maybe next time I'll try to get a larger eggplant.

I added Louisiana spices, hot spice, onions, more cheese and added cornbread stuffing to mixture.  I also put panko crumbs on top and more cheese at last 10 minutes of cook. It came out good but didn't taste much like eggplant.  Probably won't make again. But thanks

Reduced the amount of butter and added some leftover roasted veg which contained eggplant, butternut, onion, tomatoes, red bell peppers and olive oil. Left this as cubes which gave it more texture.
Made homesteader cornbread to crumble over the top. 
Topped it with some of the cheese over the cornbread.
DIVINE!

Be sure to drain & use paper towels to thoroughly dry the eggplant after cooking. Use only regular, not low salt cream of mushroom soup. I use the " Jiffy" corn bread mix in the blue box. Mix according to box instructions , then pour on top of the casserole & bake, Yum yum!

I picked a large and medium eggplant from my garden.  I still used recommended portions on ingredients. However instead of boiling the eggplant, I steamed it.  Less water to get out that way!  I also didn't use quite a full can of soup.    I divided it in half (before spices).  Half I cooked with oregano, savory & thyme, and the other I cooked with curry & tumeric.  They are both wonderful!!!  I did not use the cornbread at all.  I want to freeze the extra.  I will add bread crumbs or extra cheese when I reheat them.  The flavor is great!!!!

Eating it as I review!  After reading some reviews I too tweaked recipe.  I halved the ingredients except for the eggplant and the seasoning. I added mushrooms used parmesan and bread crumbs only bc that's what I had.  All worked very well.  I bit running but not too bad at all! Thanks Mimi!
