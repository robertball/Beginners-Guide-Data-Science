I followed this recipe loosely as I thought the amounts called for would make too much for my crew but it was a big success. My husband really liked it. It was a great dipping sauce for sauteed smoked sausage!

Very good dipping sauce Erin. We used it on chicken wings. I'm not sure how much bbq is a dash but I used 2T and we thought it was delicious. Thanks.

Nice and Easy! I found the proportoins of honey to mustard to be on the sweet side. Bump up the mustard for a more tart tasting!

Great dipping sauce. I used this with fresh chewy (dough) pretzels. So yummy!

I halved the recipe for my family. I wasn't really happy with this following the honey to mustard amounts at first. All I really tasted was the honey. So I kept adding mustard until it tasted better I think I ended up using about the same amount of mustard. Also added a T of spicy brown mustard and a dash of hot sauce. I used a hot and spicy bbq sauce. It was really good and I served this with Jan's Pretzel Dogs (AR) which was a fabulous combo.
