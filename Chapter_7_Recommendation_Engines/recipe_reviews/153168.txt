Alot of people in my family hate mayonaise, so I just used cool whip and it came out great.

Instead of the dressing mixture in this salad, I used a cole slaw dressing consisting of: 1/3 cup Splenda (or sugar), 1/2 teas. salt, 1/8 teas. pepper, 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1 1/2 teas. white balsamic (or rice vinegar), and 2 1/2 T. lemon juice. Loved it prepared this way.

This is a great basic recipe.  I really liked the combination of fruits.  I used Gala apples unpeeled, left out the pecans, and used Greek vanilla yogurt as dressing . Delicious!

I liked it so much! I love the fruit selection in this. The mayonnaise was a little much, next time I'll try cool whip like someone else said below. :) Overall, I would serve it again :)

sour cream or cool whip are the best dressing for this salad.
