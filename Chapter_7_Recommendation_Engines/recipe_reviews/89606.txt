Fabulous! My passion is cooking and I have prepared so many dishes...it NEVER dawned on me to prepare burgers made from salmon! My husband mixed the ingredients and he does things by-the-book. We followed the directions to-the-tee. We grilled these up and they were INCREDIBLY TASTY! They stay together perfectly, had no shrinkage (make the patties exactly to the size of your onion rolls for the perfect fit), and if you double the recipe, form more patties and freeze them. They freeze perfectly fine. The olive oil is a great addition and healthy too! I give this recipe 5 stars. Will do again and again. Bravo to the author.

Healthier Substitutions that worked great for me: Canned sockeye salmon Ground oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs egg whites I mixed it together with my hands and cooked in a non-stick pan on the stove. I didn't have time to refrigerate and they still came out great. Served over a salad of greens, purple cabbage, sliced apples, pesto, and canellini beans. Great dinner.

Wow!  I followed the recipe to the letter and they were fantastic.  At first I thought pulling the salmon from the skin was a bit of a pain as I was trying to cut it off (apparently I'm not that coordinated) but since I knew I would be mincing it, I got right in there with both hands and the salmon tore away from the skin rather quickly.  I then popped it into the food processor and had minced fresh salmon in seconds (did the same with the red onion).  I formed the patties in a Tupperware burger press so the consistancy was perfect and not a single morsel crumbled during grilling.  I will be laminating this recipe because I'll be making it over and over again.  Thanks so much for posting it!

My husband loved this! This is his rating. He said it is a "10" on a 10-point scale. He loved the blending of salmon with fresh rosemary (don't used dried), Dijon, and horseradish in addition to the other ingredients.

This, despite my making this from canned salmon, and scaling the recipe to three servings. And, I made them on my stovetop (lightly fried).

I'll make these again, using canned salmon, but would add more bread crumbs to make them hold together instead of falling apart as they did. One patty was ok; the rest were crumbs (that my husband is happy to eat as leftovers).

If you like salmon, you'll love this recipe. I imagine it's best if made with fresh (not canned) salmon.

What a great recipe! I look forward to playing with the ingredients--like using fresh ground ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi instead of the dijon/horseradish/rosemary. When I shaped the patties I was afraid that I hadn't minced the fish enough and that they would fall apart so I put the patties back in the fridge for a bit. It was raining out so we did them on a very hot skillet with a little olive oil. They got a wonderful sear and stayed together beautifully. I used Panko for the bread crumbs and I didn't change anything other than the addition of some fresh parsley and chives. We didn't bother with the buns and just served it on a bed of mixed greens. Fabulous!

The flavor was awesome.  I thought the rosemary may be overpowering, but went ahead with the 1 tbls.  It was very yummy...definite keeper.

Good recipe!  I used Alaskan salmon in a pouch and whole wheat panko breadcrumbs.  I had them without the bun (because I wasn't very hungry, not because I am afraid of carbs) and topped them with a little prepared horseradish sauce.  Served with steamed haricot vert.

These are fantastic.  Scaled down to half and used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs.  Otherwise followed exactly.  They held together well (the key is to referigerate the mix before forming patties...and handle as little as possible while making patties, then referigerate again).  

Were a hit.  Served on onion rolls lightly toasted on the grill and micro greens.

I usually alter recipes a little, but after reading the other reviews, I followed this one to a tee and it was GREAT! The patties held together really well, and tasted so good the bun seemed in the way. Served it with green beans and a light pasta salad for a terrific summer meal.

This is such a great recipe so if you’re going to try it please make it as WRITTEN! Don’t substitute canned salmon for fresh. It is not the same. Also don’t listen to the people who substitute half the ingredients and then give it only two or three stars. It’s not the same recipe. I’ve made these burgers at least 8 times and when I got “creative” the taste suffered in my opinion. The flavors of the salmon, horseradish and rosemary are incredible. The grilled burgers had a nice crispy crust and were moist and tender inside. A nice change from beef or turkey burgers. Thanks to the creator of this recipe.

The boyfriend approves, I approve, we're good!  Good flavor, easy to make, they didn't crumble apart.  I just cooked them on the stove top since it is cold out here in Alaska! I've made salmon burgers before, but I think I would use THIS recipe again instead of the one I'd used before!

Not bad. Not good. This just seemed like a waste of salmon. There are so many better ways to prepare it. The patties were a little mushy, eggy, and lacked zest. The rosemary was too strong. Might have been better with some lemon, maybe more horseradish... I don't know. Somethin.

Fantastic.  Hold together well on the grill, taste better than anything you've gotten in a restaurant.  Easy to modify the recipe to make them your own.  (I like using shallots, fresh mint, and fresh basil in place of onions and rosemary.)
*** Update *** I've been making this recipe for 5 years now.  An absolute standby in my house for making ahead/freezing, as well as for casual entertaining.  I always make it exactly as written now.  An all-time-favorite recipe of this very busy home cook!

These were great. I used leftover Baked Dijon Salmon, omitted the horseradish, only because we don't really care for it. I only had green onions, so I used one of those and some parsley. Too cold to grill so sauteed them in a little butter. Yummy, hubby loved them too.

These were fantastic!  What wonderful flavor.  You definitely want to use fresh salmon.  I cut mine into small chunks and then ground it in the food processor until it was the consistency of ground beef.  I formed the patties and then put them in the fridge for a few hours to avoid crumbling when I cooked them.  I broiled these for about five minutes per side and served them on onion rolls with dijon mustard.  Awesome!

My husband brings home tons of salmon in the summer and by winter we are getting bored of salmon steaks. I tried this recipe and it was a huge hit! One hint, I made them the first time a bit on the thinner side and they stayed together well. Next time I made big fat ones and they kinda fell apart. Anyways the flavor in this burger is to die for!

Not bad, I followed the recipe exactly, and although they were good, they weren't excelent. I will try them again, but modify them a little. Might try to used canned salmon to see if they are equally as good but less expensive.

No offense intended to the originating chef, but while the burger itself looks absolutely wonderful, the taste is something that I have never experienced! Perhaps less herbs would help the cause.

good flavor..the horseradish adds a nice kick and blends well with the Dijon mustard, rosemary and red onion.  However, it was time consuming to chop up the salmon until minced well and I'm not sure I would go to the trouble to make them again for half my family really liked them and the other half just thought they were ok.  I might try this recipe again using ground turkey instead of minced salmon.

I followed the recipe to the letter T.  They did not want to hold together so I gave them extra time in the fridge and they still fell apart.  I lost almost 1/3 of the burgers into the bottom of my grill.  Once I ate one, while they were tasty, you can skip the rosemary, it was totally lost in horseradish.  When I ate one, it fell to pieces so I ended up with a bun and no meat.  Then finished the meal by using a fork to eat the meat off of my plate.

I tried this recipe with both fresh and canned salmon.  Fresh is definitely the way to go.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried, and I think I will cut back a little next time, since it overpowered the taste of the fish.  I also didn't use horseradish, instead added a touch of wasabi which was a nice addition.  Overall, I'd definitely make this again.

Truly amazing burger. The strong flavors of the horseradish, rosemary and mustard blend well with the strong flavor of the salmon. However, I could still taste the salmon! Unbelievably well balanced dish!!!

These had a great flavor, even using canned salmon. I scaled the recipe for 1 pound of salmon. I will add more mustard and horseradish next time.

This was sooooo good!!!  What a wonderful and creative way to prepare salmon!  I'll definitely make them again. I didn't use the horseradish, but I will next time.  They were still so tasty.  Also, I cooked them on the George Forman Grill - be sure to spray top and bottom with Pam or else they will stick!

These are delicious, and a great alternative to hamburgers or salmon filets. Did need a little more salt to suit my family's tastes.

This recipe makes some delicious burgers! I used my Cuisinart attachment to grind the salmon - while adding the rosemary into the machine at the same time to blend it in, worked very well. My husband grilled them on the BBQ and the whole family loved them!

Tasty burger. I mistakenly bought horseradish sauce instead of straight horseradish, so the flavor wasn't as strong as I had hoped. But we topped the burger with a little extra sauce and it was perfect. Next time I'll do it the right way and I'm sure it'll be excellent.

 I only took off 1 star because I had a hard time getting the patties to stay together. Perhaps this is just the nature of the Salmon burger, but you really can only flip it once--so be sure it's done!

I made these burgers for my daughter's birthday B.B.Q. and they were a HIT!!!  Everybody loved them and wanted the recipe.  I must say, I cheated a little.  I used fresh salmon flavoured trout instead of salmon (the trout cost half the price) and no one new the difference.  If you have never had salmon trout you must try it.  You really cannot tell the difference.  The burgers held up perfect on the BBQ.

WOW! I wasn't expecting these to be quite this good!  I used canned salmon and this still far exceeded my expectations! I used mayo instead of horseradish, and added a little extra dijon/mayo to my mix since canned salmon is a little dry.  It reminded me a little of crabcakes, so it would be great even without the bun!

We loved these burgers! But I've made them twice, once with canned salmon and once with fresh. Please don't use canned. It just isn't nearly as good. I've also pan fried them in a little oil, which works fine as long as you chill them first.

Who isn't trying to get more Omega-3's in their diet besides the sea lions and bears (and other salmon loving creatures)? What a wonderful way to eat Salmon!!! I had dried some Rosemary I got from my folks versus store bought. Used my George Foreman Grille for two at a time cooking. Then I freeze patties in aluminum foil for future consumption. This way I can eat Salmon once or twice a week with limited effort. This is a VERY good tasting Salmon Burger...I'm thinkin' "Perfessional" in quality.  BTW I used Sockeye, but better OR cheaper species would work well too.

I was quite disappointed w/ how these turned out.  I stuck to the recipe except scaled it down to only make 4 small patties, but they were VERY bland and completely fell apart on the grill.  Made a great big mess.  Will not be making again.

Yum! Very good as written. Probably used a little more bread crumbs because the patties seemed wet. (May have had more than the 2 1/2 lbs. Hard to say when you're working from a freshly caugh salmon. But the flavors were very good and I like the suggestion of food processing the minced fillet - made the flavors mix together better.

I scribbled down the ingredients and headed to the kitchen.  I didn't write the instructions. So the olive oil got thrown into the mixture. I deleted the horseradish because I was using a wasabi mayo on the bun. I also didn't use rosemary because my kids won't eat it. I would've liked the rosemary. But overall I like the Paula Deen one is better.

Excellent recipe. Made them many times.
I prefer a bit more flavor. I add cayenne pepper, red pepper and Tabasco sauce which wakes them up a bit.

Really good, even my husband the super picky eater thought it was delicious!  I'm not a very good cook, but they came out perfect.  I halved the recipe so I'm not exactly sure on the proportions, but it still came out great.  I used a George Forman grill and the burgers held together really well.  It's a keeper!

Hand chop the salmon coarsely to avoid mushy texture. Be more generous with the minced red onion. Added minced garlic and 1/2 cup chopped parsley. Started out with 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and adjusted it until desired; for a little under 1 kilo of salmon, I ended up using 3/4 cup of bread crumbs. The hamburger patty maker was so helpful in shaping them; placed two medium scoops on a piece of parchment paper, cover loosely with a piece of Saran plastic wrap and plunge the patty maker on top.

My whole family loved this!  A great way to use some of the salmon in my freezer. It was snowing outside (on Oct 30th!), so I cooked them in a non-stick pan with a bit of olive oil and butter.  Kids put ranch on their burgers.  Adults did Dijon and/or horseradish, and I added acodado -yum!  I only had my dried rosemary, and the flavor was still good.

This is a very good recipe. I left out the horseradish and scaled it down to three burgers. My only complaint is that the burgers were huge and falling apart. BUT, they tasted great. I will make this again.

Thank You so much!  This this recipe is wonderful.  I have been buying the salmon burgers from whole foods, very pricey!  Now I can make them even better at home.  I added about 2 ozs. of crumbled blue cheese to the mix.  Even better!

These are excellent.  So much flavor..better than beef!  I have added this to one of my usuals.  Boyfriend loves it to. Great healthy weekend dinner.  Definitely let it chill though, otherwise it will not form patties.

I reduced the rosemary by about half, and added a half teaspoon of garlic paste. (I'm a HUGE fan of garlic)

They were so easy to put together, and surprisingly easy to grill... no broken or crumbly patties.

Goes great with wasabi mayo too!

I bought the salmon in the packet instead of canned.  The canned stuff is really gross... you have to pick out scales and bones.  Otherwise, this recipes is great.  Super easy to prepare and tasty.  The hubby loved it too!

Really good. I used canned salmon, white onions and added gorgonzola cheese crumbles into the meat mix before cooking. I put it on a grilled whole wheat bun and made a 'spread' of spicy brown mustard and horseradish and put that on top. It was fantastic!

I have made this recipe many times because it's so versatile. I like to scrap the bun and serve it up with a side of white rice.   Everyone loves it!  I also recommend trying it with coarse mustard inside and on top for a little extra flavor.

These were excellent!  I was never so happy to hear that my husband wanted hot dogs...perfect chance to make these for myself!  Canned salmon can be ok in a pinch, but I think burgers like this should always be made out of fresh salmon - it adds so much to the flavor and texture.  The patties are a bit delicate when raw, but held together beautifully  on the grill as well as on the bun - just make sure you brush with oil and let them grill a bit before attempting to flip over.  Served on a whole wheat bun with a lemon-dijon sauce.   Froze the leftovers and I will be enjoying them later this week.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

These are the best salmon burgers I've ever eaten, and I used canned salmon.  I can only imagine how good they'd be with fresh salmon.  I also pan fried them, and I know they'd be better on the grill.  Nevertheless, they have a lot of great flavor, and I loved the crisp outside.  They are my new salmon patty recipe.

These turned out great! I used some leftover cooked salmon fillets and substituted a little dry onion soup mix for the onions (I was out). I didn't have any horseradish either, so I used extra Dijon mustard. Best way I've ever had salmon! I can't wait to try it with the horseradish and red onion.

This was an awesome recipe. Family loved it! Only thing I might do differently is reduce the amount of bread crumbs, increase the Dijon and horseradish. Needs a nice mayo sauce to go with this sandwich.

I love this recipe, and advise cutting back on the bread crumbs.  If you use 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup, it tastes more like a burger vs. a salmon pattie.  But either way, it's excellent!

This will be my go-to recipe for salmon patties from now on.  I did not put it on a bun, I just ate it as a patty.  I will make often and will take places as well.  Yummo!

These were nice.  I liked using fresh salmon and rosemary.  Ultimately, I feel that they were "nice" and would happily eat them again, but will in no way be racing to make them again.

I am trying to make a fish or seafood dinner every Friday night. These burgers were perfect. I served them with a relish made of diced tomato, green onion, cucumber, feta, lemon juice, lemon zest and mayo.  Amazing flavour, we loved them!  Thank you!

Awesome burgers!  I followed this recipe exactly as stated and they came out perfectly.  I didn't have time to refrigerate the burgers and they still came out fine without crumbling.  I made a lemon basil aioli to put on top of it and it went really well.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Cut the recipe in half and made 4 burgers (not on buns). Used green onions instead of red,2 TBS horseradish sauce instead of the horseradish (both emergency substitutes). DEEEE-LISH!!!!  What a great twist on Salmon!  Don't skip the frsh rosemary if you have it!

Followed the directions to a T just as some of the previous posters had said they did.  Served this for the first time to dinner guests (a risky move!) but lucky for me, these turned out GREAT!!  Wow!  Our friends loved them!  Very moist and tender, great flavor, even with onions (which I'm normally not a big fan of).  I personally ate them with just a kaiser roll (couldn't find onion rolls), lettuce and tomato, and it was delicious!  Patties held generally well together, although the first one or two patties sorta fell apart on the sides when I flipped them but that's because I flipped too early.  Can't wait to make these again! YUM!

Better than other salmon burgers from this website. I used can salmon & dried rosemary & it still tasted fine. I think next time I'll add more horseradish though.

Mine didn't quite stay together but I suppose that could be because I used canned salmon.  I halved the recipe to make 4 good sized patties.  Bf said that to alleviate the crumbling you can add a bit of vegetable oil to the mix before you form into patties.  good flavor, and they work pan fried as well--didn't want to grill since it's cold out.  Thanks for the recipe1

EXCELLENT!!  I'd never tried a salmon burger just because I thought they would taste to dry and fishey.  These were moist and quite flavorful.  I used fresh rosemary, which is what the recipe called for and it provided a very subtle flavor.  Using dried rosemary MAY overpower the flavor of the burger.  Will DEFININTELY make again!

These were very good.  I think I've been trying to turn myself into a fan of rosemary and I'm coming to the conclusion that it is just too strong for me.  Next time I think I'll use dill and maybe a little mint which will be more to my taste.  The basic burger though is great.  Out of all the great reviews two suggestions that are a must are chilling the mixture before you form the patties and then chilling the patties after they are formed and putting them right on the grill chilled.  I was also very careful flipping them on the grill.  They didn't fall apart at all.  Panko bread crumbs are also a nice addition.

Very tasty burgers!  My boyfriend and I made these the other night and they were great.  We served the burgers with sweet potato fries and lemon garlic sauted shrimp.  Yum!

My family loved these.  I made them exactly as the recipe, but I chilled them after making the patties.  They did not fall apart and they were really good. This is a great way of eating salmon if you generally don't like it.

My burger looked just like the picture :)  It was very good.  The only thing that I didn't like was the texture.  Just a little mushy for my taste.

I made this recipe today and I have to say we didn't like it. That is my family's opinion and my own. I love salmon but this recipe is not to my taste, you may try it yourself but do it at your own risk.

Honestly this might be my favorite recipe from this site yet!  I LOVE, Love, love, Salmon!  I threw everything into the food processor to mince it up and used my hamburger press, and they came out perfect!  No problem at all with them falling apart when I grilled them.  Served them on kaiser rolls with fresh sliced tomato, red onion, and romaine!  Made homemade sweet potato fries from this site for a side!  TO DIE FOR!

Oh my gosh! I followed this recipe exactly, except I did not use fresh rosemary (it was in the spice bottle), but they turned out excellent! I also used extra hot horseradish, which really blended in well with the other ingredients.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  If you love salmon, you must try this recipe.

I used canned salmon.  Expected more based on the reviews.  Maybe fresh salmon would help for next time.

This was great! I reduced the recipe and thawed a frozen atlantic salmon fillet that was in my freezer. Only one egg, and I eyeballed the rest, looking for the right consistency. I did not have most of the ingredients on the list so I changed the flavor profile and this was still amazing. No dijon, horseradish, or red onion. I used minced garlic and I minced yellow onion. I thawed some frozen spinach and threw that in with some feta  crumbles...Mmm, mmm!

These were delicious!  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used 1/2 TB dried (I ground it) and it still turned out great! I didn't eat mine with a bun, but served it with garlic mashed potatoes and salsa - YUM!

We thought this was a good recipe to try on the grill.  I'm happy to say we didn't have any trouble with the burgers holding together.  While I liked the fresh rosemary overall I thought these needed more of a flavor boost.

These were really tasty and I followed the recipe as written.  I used panko for the bread crumbs because that's what I had in the cupboard, and after reading other reviews I chilled my burgers for a good 30-40 min and they held together very well.  I cooked them in a skillet with butter and olive oil and they turned out great. I served them with a ranch/tartar dipping sauce and that gave a nice cooling balance to the whole thing. Yummy, thanks for sharing!

Amazing. Next time I will use oats instead of breadcrumbs. I made these in th oven:170C/22 minutes. I did not chill them. I minced the salmon and onions into the chopper.

Update:I used 3/4 cup oats ground in thechopper and because the mixture was too liquidy I added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs

Though tasty, I would not make again- too much effort when a filet on the grill is so much less labor. Made recipe, as is. I coupled the burgers with a yogurt sauce (Greek yogurt, lemon juice, s&p, cayenne, and a tad of dill). Served on toasty Rosemary ciabatta rolls.

This was delicious. I used dried Rosemary and I served it with some store bought Remoulade mixed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. Also, I think the key to keeping it together (in addition to chilling the meat) is to limit the handling, i.e. gently make the patties and only flip once.  They were awesome!

Very nice selection, added more garlic, extra egg, and fresh cilantro, held together well, this is a great dish to make with farm raised salmon,  I would not make with sockeye as it is just to nice of a fish, but a great recipe for a lesser salmon. served mine with a wonderful roasted red pepper aoli.

A fun different way to cook salmon that everyone enjoyed.  I however realy disliked de-boning the raw fish, if I ever make this again it will be from a can.

I thought it was super easy and my family enjoyed it, even my 2 year old.  I mixed fresh basil and mayo to spread on it, with a slice of tomato and it was wonderful.

I cooked this for my bf and he loved it even though he doesn't like fish at all! Easy to make and healthy. Definitely will be making it again!

Great recipe.  My guests enjoyed it very much.  I skipped the horseradish and added an extra egg to hold it together better.  I also added some fresh parsley and coriander I had.

There was no horseradish in the house, so we had them without.  They were good, but not as spicy as I might have liked.

We really enjoyed this one - which surprised my husband.  I used panko breadcrumbs and frozen salmon fillets.  The only thing I might do is add some fresh parsley next time.

This was Soooo good! It held together very well and was very tasty.I shaped into patties and then put in fridge for a few hours. The fresh rosemary is a must. I will definitely make these again.

Very good! We used sockeye salmon and tried to prepared as directed although I was missing a few ingredients I didn't have Dijon mustard so I just added a little bit of regular mustard. Also I only had dried rosemary...will make with fresh next time love the flavor. Instead of bread crumbs I used Ritz crackers crushed. We cooked them on the George Foreman grill worked perfect. I chopped about two thirds of the salmon and put the rest in the food processor and it made kind of a paste out of the salmon, I think that is why it held together so well.

I didn't really care for these.  I made them and my daughter and I ate one each and that was that.  There were no seconds.  I am not sure what it is I didn't like, but I will not be making these again.  Thanks anyway.

this recipe was really good. the only advice i would give is to make sure you let the mixture sit in the fridge for the full half hour maybe even a little bit more, and also to keep a good eye on it when it is on the bbq. becuase it burns really easily. other then that it was great! i served it with a cheesy risotto rice and green beans. yummmm

It was okay.  We love salmon and it seemed a waste of a good piece of fish to make burgers with it.

I followed the recipe completly, I was looking for a recipe that my husband (not much of a salmon fan - but I am) would like even though he wasn't a fan. The good news is, he liked it okay, so I will more than likely make again. I thought it was great. So if you like salmon, it's really good. If you so-so like it,then in my husbands opinion, it's still so-so.

Super easy and super tasty.  The outside crisps up nicely on the grill and the texture is fabulous.  I made mine bunless (low carber) with sugar free sweet and sour sauce (Steele) for dipping.  Wonderful recipe.

Yummy!  THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!  This is a great way to add more salmon into my diet without having to deal with too much of a fishy taste.  I'll be able to eat this even when I'm not in the mood for fish since this tasted like a regular burger.  Fabulous!

My husband definitely liked these and we were shocked that our 3-y-o wolfed a rather large "burger" down pretty quickly. Followed directions exactly. Made a horseradish-enhanced sauce to top them.

Fantastic recipe!!  I forgot to get a red onion and substituted one large shallot.  We also fried these in a pan as some other reviewers have done.

This was really good and my Husband loved it! I thought there was too much dijon mustard so next time i'll probably just take out a little less. It was so easy and I will be making some for labor day!

These were excellent!  I made a half recipe but made no other changes save those of scale. Unlike a few others' posts, these held together perfectly. I will definately be making these again.

The flavor was really good but I still couldn't get the burgers to hold together well on the grill.  I have tried other salmon burger recipes and have run in to the same problem. I may cook this again and fry in the frying pan and see how they hold up.  (though I hate to fry anything!)
