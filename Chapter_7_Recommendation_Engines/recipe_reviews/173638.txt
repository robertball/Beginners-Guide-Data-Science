I absolutely loved this! Of course I love garlic though. But which made it ten times better was adding a little parmesan cheese to the top and baking at 400 degrees for like 10 minutes just to warm it through, then served with brucshetta and avacado! to die for! MMMM thank you for sharing this recipe!

very good!  def gets better as it sits.  I really thought it needed another flavor component, but wasn't sure what and all my friends loved it so I didn't add anything.  Instead of nestling the garlic in foil, I plopped them in a muffin tin and it held them perfectly.

I didn't expect how it was going to look, but don't let that fool you!  The dip was awesome!  Definitely would make this again!  Great dip to entertain with.  Serve with crackers, pita chips, or baguette bread.

I will make this again (and again and again and...) with a few changes: less salt and more green onions. I did substitute 6oz plain nonfat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. I thought the texture was perfect and the garlic flavor which I expected to be overpowering was just right.

I used balsamic instead of Wine vinegar. It was so good. It adds a nice tang.

I thought the sour cream and mayo really hid the rich garlic flavor. I would add less of those and let the garlic make more of a statement flavor that you would expect from a garlic dip.

This was very good. I was looking for something a little different for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I did put a little finely chopped red radish in it and my 3-1/2 year old grandson loved it as did the adults.

This is AMAZING!!! I didn't have sour cream on hand so I used plain yogurt. It turned out so yummy and can only imagine how much better it would be with sour cream.

SUPER YUMMY! I did more equal parts of the mayo and sour cream because I was using this as a spread for 'Mushroom Artichoke Sandwich' from here. Made as written otherwise. This had wonderful flavor and worked perfectly as a sandwich spread! I will be using this reacipe often! Thanks for sharing.:)

Loved this. Sometimes the simple things are best. I oddly enough ran out of black pepper today so only had half pf what the recipe calls for. I added some cumin (because I could use it in ie cream I love cumin so much) and one quarter of a roasted red pepper. The red pepper addition was more of a "I roasted these a couple days ago and want them to be used" reasoning. The dip would have been lovely without it.

I made this and man it is good. I used smoked salt over regular. I took 6 new potatoes cut into bite size pieces 1 1/2 Vidalia cut into 1/2 inch wedges. Put then into a pan with 2 -2 1/2 tbsp. olive oil added Italian seasonings and a little salt. Saut√©ed them for 15 minutes then raise the temp to med. high and to put a little browning on the out side. Poured this into a bowl and poured the garlic mix over. Man what a flavor

This was delicious. I served it as a dip for some homemade French fries that were topped with parmesan and truffle oil. So good.

Very good, but everyone around you needs to eat it or you will scare them a way like a Vampire!
