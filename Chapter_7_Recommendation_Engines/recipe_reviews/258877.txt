The recipe didn't say to do so but I highly recommend draining the grease off of the sausage after it is browned. Other than that, I made the recipe as written leaving out the optional sunflower seeds. They didn't seem to fit to me. After tasting the mixture I added more sesame oil out of personal preference. This recipe was good and tasted just like an egg roll without the wrapper. Because I didn't want to just serve it in a bowl and because the point of this recipe is  to eliminate the fried wrapper, I met in the middle. I made my own bowls by baking them in the oven. Good recipe and one I would make again. Don't forget to drain the grease!

This is a favorite of mine.  I have made it with ground turkey before and was just as good.  The sunflower seeds aren't a necessity I feel like it doesn't add to the flavors.  I personally prefer the low Sodium Soy , I feel regular Soy makes it very salty.   Perfect for weekly meal prep lunches

This is a great meal for when you don't have a lot of time to cook. I left out the carrots since my cole slaw mix already had carrots in it. I also omitted the sunflower seeds because I didn't have any on hand. I will be making this again!

This was so easy!  Light and full of flavor, this one will be added to my recipe box.  I used egg roll wrappers cut into quarters and folded like a taco during frying.

This is SO good!  
The one thing I changed was adding ginger at the end.  I did throw it in while it was cooking because I was afraid the raw ginger would be too potent.
But other than that I followed it (not normal for me to stick to a recipe) and it was so tasty.  Will definitely make again soon.

I love this recipe, it’s a go to when you are short on time (or patience) to put together a healthy meal. I don’t eat pork so I use turkey breakfast sausage. That’s my only change. Move over Taco Tuesday, Egg roll bowl is in the house~

Delish!!  This will be my go to instead of spaghetti!!  I used ground turkey and seasoned it pretty good.  I also used peanut oil because my sesame seed oil was rancid. I didn’t do the entire 6 cups of coleslaw mix either.  My mix had carrots already in it.  Other than that I followed recipe as stated.  No sunflower seeds. This was very easy and quick.  Tasted better than I thought it would.  I’m not a cabbage fan but I like egg rolls.  Yum!!&

I made this exactly as written and loved the flavor! Was a little too meaty for me though. Will definitely make it again, but next time with less sausage and/or more coleslaw mix.

This was awesome! EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. Seriously. No changes, no additions, nothing crazy. My husband is trying to eating lower carb and this was perfect. Since sunflower seeds were optional and I didn't have them, I left them out. I used squeeze ginger from a bottle and it gave it a great taste. Will definitely add this to the dinner rotation!

I used broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. It could use a little more soy sauce and I added some black pepper. Super easy and very yummy!!

We bought a Ninja Foodi and made this recipe. It turned out awesome! We didn’t use sunflower seeds but maybe in the future use sesame seeds and if you’re not doing low carb, top it with won ton strips.

Loved this! I made one pan with diced tofu and a second with ground turkey. I doubled the soy sauce and sesame oil.

Made this. It tastes just like an egg roll filling. Unfortunately it wasn’t my cup of tea. I put a 3 because it tastes just like an egg roll BUT I just didn’t like it. Different strokes for different folks. Great recipe though!
