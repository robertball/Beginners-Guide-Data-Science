I made this as an entree and it was delicious. Notes: Use GROUND beef. Also, the measurements for the mustard, salt and pepper are guidelines; use more to taste. I microwaved my head of cabbage for 1Â½ minute to make the leaves easier to remove and work with. Next time I would use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water and make it into a gravy to serve with/over the rouladen. I served this time with package gravy and rice and everyone (husband and teenage kids) loved it!!!

Despite the previous review ), I tried this recipe and found it was a great improvement on my mother's version.  I found it was quite good, flavor as expected of a German dish.(i had to laugh thinking the previous review may not have understood this was supposed to be GROUND beef, hence the implication that you might not be able to wrap a standard cabbage leaf arround an entire steak!

One of the blandest recipes I've made lately.  Good luck trying to find cabbage leaves big enough for the meat roll-ups.

Maybe using beef stock to steam them through would give additional flavor rather than just using plain water.
