These were excellent. I used whole wheat flour and added a couple of tablespoons of ground flax, as well I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. I was worried they would be too sweet with the honey, but they weren't. These baked up golden and beautiful. I baked these as well as an banana oatmeal muffin recipe on this site that had 147 votes for 5 stars and this recipe is far tastier. This is a keeper!

I don't usually review recipes that I've altered but this one came out so delicious despite my many changes that I just had to share how forgiving it is.  I used EVOO instead of butter/margarine, 4 tbs. of egg whites in place of the eggs, 1/2 cup of honey instead of 3/4 cup, added a bit of applesauce to the banana mixture to make it a full cup, switched the flour mixture to 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup all-purpose, and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking.  The result?  The absolute best muffins I've ever tasted, let alone made.  AND HEALTHY!  This one's going straight to the front of my recipe box.  YUM!

These were great. The only thing I changed was instead of 11/2 cups of all -purpose flour, I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  And I used ripe bananas and I figured that would add enough "sweetness" so I omitted the honey.  But then used brown sugar instead of the called 1/2 cup white sugar.  It actually turned out like cupcakes, very moist and fluffy.

First, as others mention this is a muffin, not a cupcake.  I think my personal rating would've been a 3, but my kids ate these right up so I'll grade up.  Even my daughter who strongly dislikes banana kept asking for more...and here's why.  They don't taste much like banana.  This is why I would've only given them a 3 star rating.  I think the amounts of honey and sugar should be reversed as these taste much more like honey than they do banana - it would also keep them from being on the dense side.  Plus, I felt they could've been slightly sweeter. I will make these again, but I think I will try blackberry honey to complement the banana as clover honey overpowered the banana,  and I will reverse the amounts of honey/sugar.  I did use cinnamon, and that added a nice flavor. Also, 1 cup banana is equal to 2 1/2 regular sized bananas just in case you were wondering if you had enough banana before you started making this recipe.  My final tip, do not use an electric mixer! Only packaged cake mix should use an electric mixer as they put tenderizer in their flour.  Using an electric mixer will release too much of the gluten making a tougher muffin.  A strong arm and wooden spoon is a better bet.  This muffin is already on the dense side, so don't do it an injustice by over mixing.  Stop using your mixer after the butter has been creamed, and then move on to the spoon.

OMG!  Yummy!  I was a bit worried about the batter being a little too wet and thought that I SHOULD have lessened the honey - but these were great!  Mine didn't poof over the edge of the cupcake top like most do but I can't wait to frost (yes they are already sweet) with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I talked my boyfriend into these instead of our usual chocolate cupcakes:-)  Oh and don't taste the uncooked batter - It is SOOO good I ate about 4 muffins worth!

Very tasty, and I agree with cookinchris that they are more muffin than cupcake, especially since I subbed WW flour for 1/2 cup of the flour, and brown sugar for white. Great recipe for those too-ripe bananas!

This recipe was amazing.  They came out nice and moist.  I used a few variations. Instead of using all margarine, I used 1/4 cup canola oil & 1/4 cup margarine.  I only used 1/4 cup of honey and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, in place of regualar oats, I used instand cinnamon oatmeal to subsidize some of the sweetness in place of the reduced amount of honey.  My husband LOVED these!

Awesome!  Really delicious, moist and a huge hit with both grownups and kids alike!  I think they are more like muffins than cupcakes, as they are hearty and more filling than a cupcake.  I make these "cupcakes" once a month.

This recipe is sooooo yummy, although it really is more like a muffin than a cupcake. (Am I back to the different between a muffin and cupcake?) No matter, these are going into my regular Muffin rotation file. They are healthy too using only 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup honey. I love to cook using local honey because of my alergies. So, this is a "for sure" keeper! Also, I had to use extreme control because I wanted to add nuts, but I didn't and they were wonderful. I may add nuts the next, I may not. GREAT muffin recipe! Thank you Louise!

I ground the oatmeal in the blender to a finer consistancy and added vanilla. To make it a little prettier, I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the top and swirled it with a knife.

This turned out really well. It made one large loaf for them and one smaller one for the kids to share at snack time.

First off, these are more like a muffin than a cupcake but thats no biggie to me! I used fresh ground whole wheat flour and oats. They were wonderful and moist! I used about 1 1/2 cups bananas that i needed to use up and only 1/2 cup of honey and they were PLENTY sweet (and i have a huge sweet tooth). I will be making these again and will try with less sugar next time. Thanks!!

Delicious. I used 1/2 cup honey and 3/4 cup white sugar instead as others had suggested--this gave a perfect sweetness for me. I sprinkled each muffin with cinnamon and sugar. I used three overripe bananas, about 1-1/4 cup, and the muffins turned out super moist!

Well these actually all got eaten before I got a chance to take a pic of them so maybe next time, but they were so good! Nice and light, but hearty at the same time. I added about 1 Tbsp. flaxseed and only about Â½ cup of honey. The sweetness was just right this way.

I just made these and I like them. I gave it only 4 stars because my muffin loving daughter said they were too oatmeally. They do have that texture but they are yummy. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon as others had suggested. I also cut the honey to 1/2 cup and the salt to just a dash. next time I might add choc. chips to mix things up. I used 1 big muffin tin and 1 reg. muffin tin. The big one came out in about 23 min. the reg. one was 18 mins. no burning just perfect.

this is the BEST muffin i've ever ate! i can't believe i'm the one who made it! it was super easy to make. i made them both by just greasing the pan and putting paper liners... it comes out easily from the pan and doesn't stick on the paper wrappers.  the only change i made was adding chocolate chips and put only 1/2 cup of honey. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

These have become a family favorite on my house.  My kids love them and I love the what's in them.  I use white whole wheat flour and follow the recipe exactly.  These are moist, flavorful, easy to make and best of all enjoyed by my family.  Have made them about 7 times and each time they have come out delicious.  I bake them at night and use them for breakfast the next morning and for an after school snack. Thanks!

The batter is delish. I now judge all my baked goods by whether the batter tastes good to me. Then I know the baked product will be tasty, too.  I subbed medium agave nectar for the honey and added a bit of vanilla. They were sweet enough without frosting (but would be super tasty with it, too.)  used a hand blender to chop my oats, per another reviewer's method. I really like the resulting texture.  Mmmm!

They were very good but a little too much  sweetener as written and I only got 12 out of the batch but they were done in 20 minutes.There was butter weeping out between the muffin papers and the pan so I'll probably reduce that next time also. I made a couple of substitutions: used all white whole wheat flour, the flax/water substitute for egg(worked great), and left out the honey. I also added walnuts to half and liked them both ways. Moist, slightly crumbly, no need for butter or other topping, and very good banana flavor.

These are fantastic!!! It's nothing to do with cupcakes, these are just muffins, really great muffins. After I started making this recipe I noticed I only had around 1/2 cup of quick oatmeal so I also added 1/2 cup of baby oatmeal. I reduced the amount of honey to 1/2 cup and it was just perfect. This is a really nice recipe, kids loved it! Thanks Louise!

These muffins are very good and very versatile.  Made as is, they turn out very rich-tasting.  Sometimes I add a few more things, like wheat germ or flaxseed, or finely grated carrots or raisins.  Sometimes I mix white and brown sugars or just one or the other.  They take a little more cooking time for me than noted.  We really like these!

These were super! I made 2 small changes: instead of 1/2C sugar & 3/4C honey, I put in 1C brown sugar. I also didn't have quite enough banana, so I used what I had & added applesauce to make 1Cup. Even my picky two year old loves them. Will definitely make them again.

Awesome, although I did make some substitutions to suit my family.  I added Fiber One instead of oatmeal to increase the fiber; brown sugar instead of white; applesauce instead of butter (milk allergies); and 1 cup wheat flour with 1/2 cup white.  Turned out like banana nut bread, without the nuts (nut allergies, as well).

The blend of sweetness and oatmeal complement each other. I used half white flour and half whole wheat pastry four, and next time may cut down on some of the sugar (just to make them healthier).  They are almost like a muffin, but still cake-like.  Will make again.

Loved these muffins (definitely not a cupcake). I cut down on some of the honey (1/2 cup) and sugar, adding some Splenda brown sugar too, and they had just the right amount of sweetness. The oats add a nice texture and I sprinkled walnut  pieces on top of some. These make are a great breakfast or snack!

Yum! These were a great way to use smushy bananas! I made a few changes... used 2 packs of maple/brown sugar flavored instant oatmeal instead of regular oatmeal. Since the packets were sweetened, I skipped the 3/4 cup honey alltogether & dropped down the salt to only 1/2 tsp.I added a bit of extra banana to make up for loss of moisture by skipping honey.Also added 1 tsp vanilla. Even my 4 yr old who "hates" bananas gobbled these up!

Thanks Louise, it is a great recipe!
My in-laws are here visiting us, they are diabetic and when i made this for them, they thoroughly relished these delectable muffins!
the only thing i changed here was instead of 1 and 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, i used a cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 a cup of all purpose flour, they were a little denser, but tasted awesome!
My husband who is never an oats person found them delicious.

OMG these just came out of the oven!  I WILL be making these as often as I have left over ripe bananas!  I changed the recipe to make it healhier for our diet restrictions.  I only used 1/4 c of butter and that was plenty.  I used splenda and four ripe bananas I used the 3/4 cup of honey but I substitued Agave Syrup and all white whole wheat flour.  These are AMAZING!

I cooked these cupcakes with my 4 year old son - and we just loved it! Wonderful cupcakes! 
However, i thought that there is too much sugar in the recipe - so instead of 1/2 cup honey i just 1 tbs of honey and substituted the rest with milk.

Not the best - very strong honey taste.  I found them a little bland and not very tasty!

yummy.. I also added ground flax and cinnamon like others had. I made these mini muffins so i only cooked them 13 min. My 2 boys pretty much ate the whole batch on the first day.

In my opinion the honey is what makes this recipe so awesome. Like others, I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar instead. I also used 2 egg whites instead of one egg. The muffins/cupcakes came out great!

These muffins are amazing!  Even the pickiest children will enjoy them.  Great for breakfast or as an afternoon snack!  I like to sprinkle a little sugar over each muffin before baking.  It gives the muffin a sweet "top."

For flavor and nutritional value, I give these four stars.  However, I'm with everyone else on the title being deceiving.  This is definitely more of a muffin than a cupcake.  I added some chopped pecans to my batter, which was a nice compliment to the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't change a thing about this recipe, except to make them mini muffins, and these were excellent!  I'm always looking for something nutritious and quick that my 2 year old will eat because he is a picky eater.  He had no problem gobbling up a couple of these.  Very tasty and moist, yummy!

With "jlandhen" modifications this recipe is absolutely phenomenal! I made slight adjustments to "jlandhen"s already modified version... first I only used half a cup of honey, 3 ripe bananas (a little more than a cup), and probably close to half a cup of finely ground flaxseeds. So delicious and healthy!

Very moist.  The oats add a nice texture.  Overall very banana-licious.

These are very moist and delicious!  I've been making banana bread for years and I never would have thought of using oats or honey, but both added fabulous flavor and texture.  I think next time though I will cut back slightly on the honey, they were quite sweet!  I used whole wheat flour and added 1 tsp cinnamon. On top I sprinkled a crumb topping (the "Crumb Topping For Pies" recipe from this site) and it was a great finishing touch!

Very good recipe and also very easy.  I had everything I needed right in the pantry and fridge.  I substituted flour with whole wheat and also brown sugar instead of white.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 Tlbs. coconut just for fun.
