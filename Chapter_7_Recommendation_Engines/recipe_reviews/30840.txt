Being Cuban, I grew up on "bistec empanizado," but my family's recipe is slightly different from this one. I omit the cumin (which I am not fond of) and the oregano, and substite garlic powder for those seasonings. I sprinkle the steaks liberally with lemon and garlic powder before cooking for best taste. 

This is the way my grandpa used to make them, and it is the recipe I still swear by, with white rice, black beans, fried plantains and yuca con mojo (cassava root salted and boiled and served with a warm dressing of olive oil, lemon, garlic and onion).

This recipe is great.  I love chicken friend steak, but this is the first time I have ever attempted to make it myself.  The spices in the breading mixture added a nice background taste, but they were not over powering.  The thing I really loved is the slight lemon flavor the garnish gave.  We ended up topping ours with fresh squeezed lemon we liked it so much.  The only thing I would change is, the recipe made way too much breading mixture.  I would cut that in half.

Love this recipe.  My husband and I both love cuban food.  This is wonderful.  A little bland by itself however, but to liven it up I added a topping of...can of diced tomatoes with (mild or reg) green chilies, packet of Sazon seasoning, some chopped onion, minced garlic, oregano and some corn starch to thicken.  Makes a wonderful topping for the steak.  Also served with yellow rice, black beans and corn.  Delicious meal!  A hit everytime!
Roxie, Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!

I liked this! It was easy and tasty. I didn't use cumin and oregano, I used garlic salt and lemon pepper b/c I didn't have an actual lemon and I wanted that flavor. Will definately make this again!

Found this recipe to be a wonderful update on an old comfort food.I chose  a little healthier version by sauteing in olive oil.

This was simple and very tasty. Knowing my family's taste for spice I generously added lemon pepper, garlic powder and enough cayenne pepper to make a difference. The breading came out browned and crispy - add the lemon wedges and you've got happy taste buds :)

Inspired by another reviewer I served this with black beans and fried bananas (I didn't have plantains)

Classic Bistec Empanizado...long a family favorite around here!  I love cumin, but never thought about adding it to the bread crumbs...it adds a great touch.  Goes great with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains.  A Must Try recipe!

2 cups of oil for frying is excessive not to mention unhealthy.  I found that not even 1/2 that is plenty.

Even my picky eaters loved this dish! I made this with buttered noodles, steamed asparagus, and the Special Lemonade - the five of us can't wait to have it again! I did not change anything in the recipe!

I thought this was really good and simple.  I did not fry them in the amount of oil specified, just enough to coat the pan.  The lemon was a nice twist at the end.  I served mine with buttered egg noodles on the side.  Yummy.

An easy, delicious dinner entree that's true to non-criollo Cuban cookery.  Cuban cooking is not highly spiced, as are some criollo cookery but is still adequately seasoned.  You can heat it up as did some reviewers.  I enjoyed it as printed but did cook it in a non-skillet pan with a small amount of olive oil.

A delicious and quick meal!  I prepared it a little different.  I seasoned the beef for about an hour while I was boiling my potatoes.  I added salt, pepper, a hint of cumin (don't use too much!), some oregano and italian seasoning (bought as a spice at local supermarket).  I then layed out three bowls, one with an egg, the other with all-purpose flour, and the last one with seasoned bread crumbs.  I covered strips with flour then immersed in egg then last but not least covered in breadcrumbs.  It was great!  I served with mashed potatoes and salad.

This was a great recipe for my family. I did modify it slightly by dredging the steak in flour, then egg, then the breadcrumbs. I also added all the spices plus paprika and ms dash to the flour, & pepper flakes to the bread crumbs for a spicier bite. I also cooked them in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. They turned out great and my family loved them. Thanks for the recipe.
UPDATE: I've made this several times now and it gets better every time. I've taken to cutting the steaks into fingers which cook much quicker then standing them on end in a paper towel lined pan to drain. I serve with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans. I use the oil and dredge flour to make an out of this world gravy for both the steaks and potatoes. Best Comfort Food Ever!

I always made cube steaks the same boring way and was looking for something quick, easy and different. The cumin added a nice flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I have to say this was one of the most tasteless dishes I have ever tasted. Even putting salt, garlic and other seasonings on after recipe completed did nothing to aid the taste.

These were a great change to the batter and deep fried steaks.  I added a dash of red pepper to spice it up a bit.

This wasn't too bad!  I was kind of nervous because I have had some bad luck with cube steak.  But the breading for this is really good.  Make sure that you like the taste of cumin before you make it though, you can taste it very well.

I think that was alot of breadcrumbs, so i had to save most of it for other times, and i really liked the cumin and oregano! unfortunately, like a goof, i used the wrong oil, (avacado oil) and we did not get the full flavor. Maybe next time i make it it will be crunchier and i can make a better review!

I just made this tonight for a few of my Hispanic friends and even I though there wasn't enough flavor to it. I know country fried steak isn't supposed to be very flavorful, but I though it would use a lot more then what was required for the recipe.

I am not very good at cooking chicken fried steak or anything that needs to be dredged/floured and fried. 

I tried this on a late night when I realized I didnt have the ingredients to make another dish I had planned on.

I had all of the ingredients on hand for this.

I thought it was pretty easy, pretty tasty and worth keeping.

I wouldn't say it was bland, but I can see that you could jazz it up some by adding different seasonings to the bread crumbs.

Made as described, except used 2 8 ounce cube steaks.  Didn't have fresh lemon so I  squeezed lemon juice on my steak.  I thought this made the steak.  Unfortunately, my husband isn't a fan of lemon and thought the steaks were just ok.  I also with they could've been more tender, but they are cube steaks!  I served with the Easy Black Beans & Rice resipe from this site.  Overall, it was an easy recipe and I enjoyed it because I love cuban dishes, but probably will not make again.

I had always wanted to try making country fried steak, and this recipe was perfect. My family voted to definitely have this again in the future - and often!

I thought this was pretty bland.  I added extra cumin and some garlic powder.  I also put some seasoning on the steak before dipping it in the egg.  My husband said he would eat it again but he'll have to ask for it specifically before I make it again.  Pretty disappointing.

Recipe was a quick & easy dinner with minimal cleanup.  I think I'd like to 
experiment a little more with the spices to bring out the flavor more, but I will
try this recipe again.

Though the cumin may give to it an added flavor, or twist, this is the classical "Shnitsel Viennese"... And, as such, it is a wonderful and quick dish, still! Kids are just crazy about it! In Israel, whwre it's much eaten, the coating is mixed with grounde corn (from which the Polente is made), or with grounded garlic, the sky is the limit). Bon Appetite!

Turn out great!!!!! The native recipe called for 3 cups of bread crumbs, but I only ended up needing to use 2. I would also recommend kicking up the amount of cumin to give it a bit more cuban kick. Double or even triple it!

I'd happily make this again. It's a nice change to the average chicken fried steak.
