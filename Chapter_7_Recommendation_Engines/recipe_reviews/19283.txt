This taste pretty good. The dough was a bit crumbly and not really easy to work with. They turned out very nice and they are nice and soft.

Made these with my kids. Our bakery sells a similar cookie called Speckle Cookies and we wanted to make our own. Not disappointed almost the same cookie! Can't decide which is better though the dough or the finished product!
