I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix and upped the onions. I also splurged and used real bacon, a half pound that I cooked to a crisp and crumbled. The cheese I used was sharp cheddar. I threw this together early this morning and let it set most of the day until I got home from work, my husband and I have eaten most of it--there's nothing left for Christmas. Whoops. We loved it!

Yes Margo, it is a dip, hence the name Baked Potato Dip.

This is good! I tried to reduce fat and calories by using light sour cream, light cream cheese and 2% sharp cheddar; I didn't feel like the flavor of the dip was compromised. I used the entire container of sour cream instead of the 8oz called for in the recipe. The flavor of bacon was good, but not over-powering, using real bacon pieces (found by the salad dressing at the grocery store). I served Ritz reduced fat crackers along with veggies (red pepper, carrots and celery). A super easy recipe AND good?!? It's a keeper in my book :)PS- Even better after it sits overnight!

This dip was great! I made it for a New Year's Eve party and was so well liked and easy that my husband made it for a New Year's Day party. The bacon really adds a nice smokey flavor to the dip and the onions give it a slightly spicy taste. I didn't set the dip in the refrigerator overnight like the recipe states since I didn't have time, but it still tasted great! In fact, I don't know if that step is necessary because when I tasted it the next day it seemed the same to me. So if you're hesitant to try it because you're making it at the last minute, it will turn out just fine. This will be a dip that I make often whenever I need something easy and quick to take somewhere. Thank you for the recipe, Luanne!

Recipe Group Selection:  17, Dec. 2011 - Excellent dip!  We have used this on baked potatoes and crackers.  Our favorite was when I stuffed celery stalks with it.  There is a lot of flavor to this.  Found that it works best if left out of the fridge for about 30 minutes before using on potatoes or spreading in celery.  Thanks Luanne A. for sharing this recipe.
UPDATE:  We spread on French bread slices and popped the bread under the broiler.  It made for a yummy, creamy treat.

This dip is wonderful!  Tried it for the first time last weekend for a party and it was a total hit!  People LOVED it!  Making it again this weekend for tailgating!  This has become my new "go to"- very simple and very delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have any potato chips, but it was great on tortilla chips and whole grain crackers.  Can't wait to try it on actual potato chips.

This let our high hopes and great expectations down.  It does improve somewhat as it sets, but it ultimately left us unimpressed one way or the other. Saltiness got in the way of real flavor, so it's best served with anything but salty potato chips.

This was delish! Next time I might add some chopped roasted jalapenos. Perfect dip,spread, or topping. Thank you Luanne. This is a winner!

This is great! I've made almost the exact same dip before without cream cheese, and the addition of it made it really nice and creamy. Both ways are good though. I cooked and crumbled my own bacon. I had to omit the green onions because I forgot to buy them but I know that would have made it even better.

I thought this tasted good. I made 1/2 recipe with some leftover cream cheese and sour cream. That amount made about 1-1 1/2 cups. I used all the ingredients except I used low-fat dairy and for the bacon I used pre-cooked thick cut bacon. I microwaved the bacon and then crumbled it very fine. I tasted it with crackers and pretzels, but it honestly had the most baked potato flavor with potato chips. I wouldn't subtitute anything different other than them. This will work good for a pot-luck or party. It is like other cream cheese, sour cream, and seasoning dips but better with the bacon and cheese.

I thought this was a nice change of pace from a normal ranch dip.  I served with potato chips, but might look for something a little less salty the next time.

I assume this recipe is meant to be a topping for baked potatoes, and it is delicious.  Reading the two reviews, people used it for chips!

I didn't have ranch seasoning so I did half the amount of sour cream plus ranch dressing. Threw it all in a crock pot and served warm right away. Very good with tortilla chips.

This was a very yummy recipe!!  It was the favorite among the three that I made for a superbowl party.  Even the kids ate it.  I did not see the point of using 2/3 of the bacon, so I went ahead and threw in the whole bag; there is nothing bad about extra bacon on anything!  I used a combination of baked mini bagels and baked mini flatbreads.  It was delicious!

This receipe is great! The only thing I have to say about the recipe is that it doesn't make a ton of dip. I would guess the servings to be closer to 10 or 12. It all depends on how big you consider a serving, but because of how good it is, better to be safe than sorry.

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe.  It's become a new holiday favorite of ours.  We made it for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years.  I preferred it a few days later then when freshly made.  YUM!

This has a wonderful flavor that leaves you licking your lips wanting more of it!  We used it on a variety of chips, crackers, and crudites.  We kept going until there was no more---grown adults were making crying baby sounds!  Really good, and the bonus was how quickly it went together.  Because several guests like things a bit hotter (I don't), I did grind peppercorns over the top, but if they want hotter than that, they'll have to make their own!  Definitely a keeper!

I liked this overall but it needed some adjustment.  It was just too thick to be a good chip dip.  It had good flavor but I agree that it was very salty.  I think if you cut back on the cream cheese and on the ranch dip, this would be much better.  As it was, it was used to top baked potatoes rather than as a chip dip because it was too thick to dip easily.  As a baked potato topping, it was great.

I love this dip!  The only change I made was omitting the green onion. It may be slightly on the salty side but the flavors are all there and it tastes awesome!  We eat this with Fritos scoops and potato skin chips if we can find them. Definitely a go to dip to make:)

This easy recipe was a HIT!!!  It was YUMMY made exactly as it is written (I used lower fat cream cheese and sour cream) and tastes just like the delicious toppings that go on a loaded baked potato!  Served it with crinkled low salt potato chips and that was perfect to feel like you are eating a loaded baked potato!  The large bowl it made quickly disappeared and the crowd loved it!  This is  keeper.

After reading some of the other reviews I made some changes. I doubled the recipe and added an extra brick of cream cheese and real bacon. I also added some fresh minced garlic and seasoned salt. I wasn't able to make it the night ahead, but did let it set in fridge about 30 min before serving. My guests loved it! Served it with baked potatoes, grilled steaks and grilled mushrooms/onions. It's great as a topping on the steak too; that's how I was eating leftovers!! Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as written initially, it was too thick as a dip for a fragile potato chip so I added a bit more sour cream to make it more spreadable. I let it sit for over a day before serving it thinking it would give it great flavor.. It was just okay, maybe if you were to fry up real bacon it would taste a little better. I almost wonder if it would be better hot because of the cheeses in it. If I were to make it again I would probably add some fresh garlic and real bacon then I would try baking it in the oven for a half hour and see if that helps the consistency and flavor.

Very tasty!  I added a little more sour cream to dipafter letting this sit as all the chips kept breaking from it's thickness, after that it was golden. I made a half batch and it came out delicious.

This was a winner all around. The only change I made was to use 16 oz. sour cream instead of 8.  I think it was perfect for dipping.  It might have been a little thick with only 8 oz.  Will definitely make this one again!

Loved this quick and easy recipe. Added black olives and just crumbled some bacon up as I didn't see a need to make a special trip to the store to buy bacon bits. Will make over and over again. Thank you for the recipe :-).

I have been making a variation of this for years & it is always a crowd favorite.  I omit the green onion (personal preference, and 1 less thing to have to do for party prep), but the dip is fabulous either way.  This MUST sit a while for the flavors to blend prior to serving...This is also a fantastic baked potato filling :)  Thanks so much for putting this out here!!

Wonderful but definitely salty.  Didn't change anything and it was a hit at the BBQ.  You could definitely cut down on some of the ranch packet to try to cut the salt, but I think by just reading the ingredients it's evident it is to be a salty dip.  Regardless, there wasn't any left by the end of the night.  It also holds over well the next few days in case you don't finish it the day of.

Very good!  I used low fat cream cheese and my favorite low fat sour cream, Daisy brand, and it was still great.  Not being a fan of salt, I used only ½ pack of ranch dressing.  I also used Trader Joe’s nitrate free apple wood smoked bacon instead of canned bacon.  Quick to throw together and perfect for an afternoon watching football, I will definitely make this again.

The only thing I had a bit of an issue with was the amount of ranch in it. It made the dip a bit too intense.

I think I made my first batch with a little too much onion. You could smell it a mile away. Still yummy though!
