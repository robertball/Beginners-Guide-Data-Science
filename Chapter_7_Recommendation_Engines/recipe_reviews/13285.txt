Very very easy soup and inexpensive as well. I made my version with oyster mushroms (which are cheaper where I live) and macaroni! Very tasteful!! Will definitely make again!

I didn't really care for this. To me it tasted like watered down sauerkraut with mushrooms. I'm a sauerkraut fan but I won't be making this again.

Used chicken broth instead of water. Used potatoes instead of pasta. The soup was hearty and delicious. We may try beef broth next time.

I thought this was terrific! I changed just a bit. I did potatoes (5 cubed Red potatoes) fry with the onions and garlic. I used one container of veggies broth and no water (I didn't size my pan up.very good and ran out of room). In addition to the other ingredients I added one bag of Boca crumbles. It is delicious! We ate up this batch and will make another batch to freeze some! I am even going to make for my mom and maybe have a new Christmas meal for our family too!
