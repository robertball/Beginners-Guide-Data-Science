The kids really loved this cake. I didn't get a chance to taste it so I'm going off of the kids review :) Must have been really good since it didn't last long around here.

Nothing really very special about this, it's just an extra-moist boxed cake. Fine, but nothing earth-shattering.

Yucky cake is more like it. If you think this is the best cake out of GA, you are sadly mistaken. I will not be making this again because about 3/4 of it went to the trash.
