I took lovestohost's suggestions and only used one tube of whomp biscuits but I doubled everything else BUT the dry mustard. I did not use the sesame seeds only because I did not have them. I also baked mine as she did inside cupcake liners within muffin tins. Very simple, kids thought this was the BESTIDEAEVER. Made for great sopping-up bread for the sauce for my Baked Penne. I'll make this again.

Due to time constraints, I chose to cut the biscuits and make in muffin tins for individual portions (and quicker bake time...about 14 minutes).  I only used one tube of biscuits, but left everything else the same.  In the future, I'd DOUBLE everything else for a single can as these didn't really have a ton of flavor.  This is a nice jumping off point, but customize to your own tastes.  THANKS for the recipe.

I think I would have given it 5 stars if I had made it with bread dough. I put on a ton of cheese and added Italian seasoning  like someone suggested and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (I was afraid it would burn and get bitter). Sprinkled with thinly sliced green onions.

I also topped it with shredded parmesan.  This is a great recipe for something quick and easy.  I ended up covering it in foil for the last half of baking to avoid over-browning.

Like others I used just one container of the flaky biscuits  yet doubled all of the spices and put it in the muffin pan to bake faster. In my oven it took about 16 minutes. The seasoning was perfect and even my picky 10 year old loved it. One container of the biscuits made 10 biscuits when using the muffin pan by the way.

I also added some dried Italian herbs just to give it a little more flavor.

I used only one tube like the other reviewers- and doubled the ingredients (not the mustard) and baked in well-sprayed muffin tins. Great!!!!
