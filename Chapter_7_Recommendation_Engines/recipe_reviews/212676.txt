Didn't change a thing! They are delicious hot out of the oven and just as good cooled, on a buffet table where they attracted a lot of attention.  They make a very pretty presentation.  I shared your recipe with several people who were raving over how good they were. Will definitely make this again.

I made these tarlets for Christmas Eve and Chistmas Day for two separate family gatherings.  On Christmas Eve, I followed the recipe exactly as in the recipe and everyone loved them.  However, on Christmas Day, I used monterey jack cheese and think it adds more flavor than the swiss cheese.  Both ways were great and will be making again for another party on Monday..may try another type of cheese again!!!! This recipe is great

Delicious! I used a full size muffin/cupcake tray and it worked out fine. Didn't change anything! I made a second batch using milk bc I had no cream on hand, and it was good too, just not as rich.

The recipe turned out very egg like in taste...more like a breakfast snack than an appetizer.  It was tasty, but not what I would serve at a party.  I would not include the egg mixture if I made this again.

I made this for bunko and followed the directions per the recipe.  They turned out pretty well, but you really do have to watch to make sure you don't add too much egg into each dough-lined cup.

These are wonderful! I made them at christmas and they were gone before we knew it! Instead of swiss cheese I did use monterey jack because my family is not a big fan of swiss, these are so easy and yummy!

5 stars for taste, minus 1 star for preparation difficulty: stretching out the dough to fill regular muffin pans was a big hassle and resulted in slightly odd looking shapes. Mini muffin pans are probably easier but the filling would be so minimal I think the classic pilsbury dough flavor would overwhelm the cheesy goodness. Next time I'll try pie crust or puff pastry dough just for ease of assembly. Otherwise, the flavor is awesome and it's easy to make variations. Big hit at my lil sis' potluck wedding reception. Definitely recommended.

I thought these were very bland as written.  They are very eggy, so I might use less egg next time, and maybe season w/ some salt/pepper, and add more cheese.  As written there just isn't much flavor, but there is potential, I will probably try again, making some changes.

This recipe is awesome!! Easy to make and very tasty.  My husband couldn't eat enough of them.  I will definitely make these for all of my gatherings.  I doubled the recipe and added a little extra swiss cheese on top.  Perfect finger food with a great taste.  Very easy on the pocketbook.  Will definitely keep on my menu list.

On Friday nights my husband and I like to make them appetizer nights and watch movies. I decided to try this recipe.  We are both happy I did.  We gobbled them up.  I thought maybe the swiss cheese would be too strong but it was perfect!!!

Didn't taste very good, kind of plain if you follow the recipe. Probably will not make again.

I thought these would be great from all the reviews, I found them okay...but probably won't make again. Now, I have to say, my husband did get GARLIC dough instead of regular, so that could have been it. They were easy to make though.

I added quite a bit to this, so it might not be a fair rating, but with the changes I made, they came out really good.  I used a Crescent dough sheet, cut into 24 squares (4x6).  I had some left over ham, so I put that in the bottom instead of bacon (I think bacon would be delicious though).  Then some shredded cheddar.  I beat 2 eggs since I had more dough cups than the recipe called for, added 7T of whipping cream, salt, pepper, a pinch of garlic powder, minced onion, then I remembered I had chives, so I added just a few for color mostly.  Just less than 1T of egg mixture per cup and tossed them in the oven.  Seemed like the dough was browning too fast and the egg was underdone at 15 minutes so I dropped the temp down to 325 and left them in for about 7 more mins.  Looked like the egg still wasn't done, but when I poked a fork into it, it was indeed done, so maybe I didn't need to worry.  I thought they were great!  Lots of room to experiment with these.  UPDATE:  made with crumbled bacon, even better.

Didn't care for it. Too dough and too artificial tasting.

I added 1/2 tsp dijon mustard. I used powdered onion for the chopped onion, and 3 tsp half-n-half for the shipping cream. They were really good. Oh, I also baked them at 350, because I wanted to make sure that they were set before they became too brown.
