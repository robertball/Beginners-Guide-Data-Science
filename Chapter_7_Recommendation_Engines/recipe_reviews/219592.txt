This is the most insanely weird yet delicious bread I have ever made. I let it rise for the first 16 hours and it may have risen about 1/3". I was pretty dissapointed. Then, I decided to put it into a bread proofing basket (do not do that) and it rose only 1/4" after giving it about 6.5 hours more. I was very mad, as it damaged my proofing basket as it got stuck in it. I finally decided to just throw it in the oven, lack of proofing and all, in a big plop of an oval like shape on a sheet lined with parchment and sprinkled with the cornmeal. To my obvious shock, it sprang up in the oven. It tasted just like something that would come from Panera Bread. It had a crisp crust, a chewy interior, and nice flavor and appearance when cut open. It does make a small loaf, so don't be surprised by that. I was also told to be patient with it and to cover it the last 15 minutes or so to avoid browning but a finished interior. I used a thick piece of foil. Note, this recipe is the same as Chef John's Pumpkin bread except it is missing the directions to use water at 100-110 deg. F. Hope that helps with rising.

I made the dough exactly as written and then forgot about it until almost 24 hours later! I just continued to follow the directions... and it turned out fantastic. It's a great way to use up extra pumpkin.

Subtle flavor with an incredible chewy crust! I added some pecans for a little extra crunch, and subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat white to make it a little heartier. I also upped the spices a smidge. Delicious
