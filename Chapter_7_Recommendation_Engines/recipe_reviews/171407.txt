Simple and delicious! And, just as the submitter states you CAN do this in less than 10 minutes. It's the perfect recipe if you're in a hurry or you need to make a lot of pies. I baked mine in a glass dish with a baking sheet underneath to catch the excess drippings. It baked up nice and tasted great - especially with vanilla ice cream! Thanks for a great recipe Lisawas! And, thanks to everyone at AR for letting my niece Kailey and I participate in the President's Pie Challenge for the Thanksgiving webcast! We had a great time! As my niece put it, one of the best parts was getting to eat the pie at the end!!!

SO DELICIOUS! I used 6 c frozen tart cherries (no need to defrost-use them frozen) instead of canned. Instead of all sugar, used 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 c Splenda granular (this is the Splenda that is cup for cup equivalent of sugar). No need to add extra water or liquid.  Suggestion: If you have time, mix all pie ingredients together in a bowl and leave on the counter for about 10 minutes to let the cherries thaw slightly and absorb tapioca before you bake. I always do this when baking any type of fruit pie and using tapioca, and it seems to produce better/tastier pies. If you don't have time, charge ahead and get baking! My husband called for his mother and rolled his eyes back in his head over this one! :)

Excellent pie!! I only used one cup of sugar and the cherries were picked from my back yard. I will be using this recipe again and was so simple to make. It's a keeper in my books.

This "basic" recipe was rated by our entire family (cherry pie snobs) best ever experience with the following changes:  We made our own butter-based pie crust; instead of almond extract we used about 1 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice.  Instead of canned cherries, we used 5 cups fresh pitted tart (drained) cherries from our tree;  we increased the sugar to about 2-1/2 cups, and let the mixture sit over 15 minutes to soften the tapioca.

Best tasting and most beautiful pie I've ever made (and I've made a lot in my 66 years). I made it exactly like the recipe except that I brushed the top with milk and sprinkled sugar over it.

DELICIOUS cherry pie!  I used 5 cups of frozen sour cherries which tasted so much fresher than canned!  I also cooked the filling on the stove top and let it cool prior to filling the pie to ensure the filling set up nicely.

I used this recipe as a stepping off point for making a "sugar-free" version.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it came out fine!  I also substituted a 12 oz. bag of frozen unsweetened Sweet Dark Cherries for one of the cans of sour cherries.

My husband picked the cherries in the AM, & in 1hr that evening, the pie was made and cooling on the stove.(Not sure how long it took to pit the cherries though! I used about 5- 51/2 cups of fresh cherries instead of the canned ones.) This was my first sour cherry pie, and I made if for my husband for Father's Day. I also used whipped cream for a topping instead of ice cream. This Sour Cherry Pie hit a home run for my hubby and family! I have enough cherries to make another one. Can you say yum?!

This was my first attempt at a Cherry Pie, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect (never used canned fruit and/or tapioca before).  Used homemade crust - was a little concerned about the amount of liquid that developed after adding sugar, so I panicked and scooped out about 1 cup of liquid - - - aside from that, taste was great.  Appearance of canned cherries not that wonderful, but that must be why some people add red food coloring (?)  In any event, will make again :)

1 of the most idiot proof recipes I've ever seen.  Very tasty, and great consistency as long as you don't mind the texture of the tapioca pearls (but you can totally grind those down anyway if you like.)

I used fresh tart cherries, but I live in Michigan. My grandma always swore the tapioca made all the difference. I also use a vinegar recipe crust.

I have made this pie for years with a little twist.  I use minute tapioca and I use an oatmeal, brown sugar, butter topping.  It has been my husband's favorite.

This was my first cherry pie and it was perfect!  The tapioca was an easy no stove top way to make the filling and it didn't run when I cut it.  I would however add a few squeezes of lemon juice.  I make a blueberry pie that uses tapioca, almond extract and lemon and I like the extra tartness that comes from the lemon.  Will try next time.

Wow, this was great!  I'd never tried tapioca in a pie before but it made for a nice firm pie (when cooled).  The tapioca beads were visible but I didn't notice a texture issue (but I like tapioca).  Sour cherries weren't available in a can, so I used 6 c. of frozen "pie cherries" and tasted for sweetness.  We gave the filling 15 minutes to rest before we put it into the crust&baking.   Mm, be sure to try this!  Thanks Lisawas!

I ALWAYS use this recipe. I should have rated it long ago. I do have some modifications though. I add a bit more tapioca, let the mixture sit for 15 minutes then drain most of the water.This way if you lose some of the tapioca you have the extra as backup. I also use a 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening pie crust recipe.

Excellent and easy!  Used only two cans of tart cherries and one cup of sugar, substituted lemon for almond extract, and dusted the upper crust with one teaspoon of sugar.  You betcha I'll be making this one again and again!

I had a 29 oz. can of tart cherries in the pantry that I had picked up at Aldi, and have been trying to find a way to use it up. When I received my June/July/August issue of Allrecipes Magazine with this recipe in it, I knew I had to make it. My only dilemma was that my can of cherries was only 29 oz., and I wasn't about to go to the store. I threw in a 12 oz. bag of frozen raspberries, and said to myself - CLOSE ENOUGH! It was DELICIOUS! I loved the cherry/raspberry combination.

For a long time, I have been wanting to taste a sour cherry pie as I love anything with a bit of a sour taste, but sour cherries were never available locally.  Then recently, I discovered a place where I could finally get these.  I found this recipe and made it over the Christmas holidays.  I was extremely disappointed, as it was so sweet that I could not believe it was called a sour cherry pie.  So this week, I decided to try it again, but to slightly change the ingredients to suit my taste.  I therefore only used 1c of sugar, and added a bit of lemon juice to the filling.  For the pie crust, I tried the Hot Water Pie Crust II from this website, which was fantastic!  This time, the pie came out just like I had always imagined it!  I had to force myself to take it to the function for which I had made it!  Because it was a new recipe, I cut a small corner piece to taste - wow!  Fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing it!  I will soon be making it for myself!!

I followed the recipe exactly but didn't think this was a very good pie at all.  Almost every store-bought/restaurant cherry pie I've ever had was better.  I will never make it again. : (

Excellent. The almond is just right and not a bit overpowering. I used traditional tapioca and about 4 cups frozen tart cherries and had to increase the baking time a bit to get it to set, but it worked out great (I used foil to protect the crimping). Everyone loved it.

I don’t like cherry pie. At least I didn’t until I met this pie. My son-in-law had mistakenly bought sour cherries on their way through Michigan. Rather than toss them, I used them and about a cup and a half of sweet cherries to make this marvelous pie. I used 4 1/2 cups of fresh ripe cherries, 1 cup of sugar, and the other ingredients. I also cooked the filling briefly in a saucepan.  Epic! My wife says it’s the best pie I’ve ever baked, and I can bake pie.

Delicious & simple. I did use five tablespoons of corn starch so it was thick. Hubby said it was the best cherry pie I ever made.

I used about 5 cups of fresh tart cherries from our neighbor's tree. Didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla extract. Instead of a lattice top I used pie cutters and put star holes in the tops and put an egg wash on the top crust and sprinkled with medium-coarse sugar. I made two pies (and actually made the crusts from scratch). Not ones for cherry pies, my husband and I absolutely loved this pie using the neighbor's tart cherries. So good!!

Excellent recipe!  I only had two cans of tart cherries, so I made this in an 8 inch pan. Other than that, the only thing I did differently from the recipe was to smear the bottom of my crust with red currant jam, a trick I’ve used for years to keep the crust from getting soggy.  I followed another reader’s suggestion to coat the lattice with sugar, first running a brush dipped in the cherry juice over the lattice before sprinkling the sugar. Perfect!

I am not sure what happened but when I made this recipe it turned out horrible.  I was so disappointed.  We through it out after our initial tastes.

I let the cherries drain overnight after I read the reviews.   This was a very delicious cherry pie.  I liked that it had nice flavor, not runny and not too sweet.   Will keep this recipe on my list.
