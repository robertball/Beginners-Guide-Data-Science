Very good! I personally will add more tequila for the next time I make this. This recipe made about 2 margaritas.

I made this exactly as the instructions directed and it was absolutely delicious!  It's good enough to serve at a fancy dinner and yet easy enough to make for casual get-togethers.

Great recipe!  My only change was using lemon seltzer instead of the ginger ale because that is what I had. Thanks for sharing.

I used a white soda instead of alcohol and I think it tasted really good so you don't have to drink to enjoy this recipe.
