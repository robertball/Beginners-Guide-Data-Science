I picked this recipe because I wanted a dressing to go with my Mexican dinner.  It didn't disappoint but because I make my own dressings often, I did make some proposition changes.  I usually make dressings, 2-1, oil to vinegar (or acid).  So I used 1 small lime which yielded about 1/8 cup then I added 1/8 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup of oil olive, 1 large garlic clove, 1 tsp cumin and a bunch of cilantro, and salt to taste.  It was perfect with the Boston lettuce, small tomatoes, roasted corn, green onions, avocado, and corn chip salad.

The proportions are a bit off, making it a bit too liquidy.  I almost doubled the cilantro, halfed the lime (only because that's all I had) and added about 2tsp of jalape√±o juice and it was wonderful! Would have been nice to have it thicker but taste great and had enough flavor.

I wouldn't say the measurements are really off, but I did make some adjustments.  I added a bit more cilantro, garlic, and apple cider vinegar.  I also drizzle the dressing on my salad and stir it all together to minimize the amount of dressing used.

Sorry, but the measurements are really off in this recipe, and what you end up with a thin/watery dressing that will not emulsify and falls off your salad greens.  The standard salad dressing ratio is 3 to 1.  Also, understand that if you start adding a lot more olive oil, your fat grams will increase.  I'm giving this 3 stars based solely on taste, not the consistency.  I do like the layers of flavor that the bright lime juice and the fresh cilantro bring to the vinaigrette, but proportions need to be modified to reach the right vinaigrette consistency.  Very "Mexican" tasting to me, but I can see using this on a bean salad, pasta salad, or maybe even drizzled on some nachos.  It has possibilities other than just a salad dressing.  Maybe even add a little dijon mustard to help the emulsion.

I'm sorry to be negative, but this was a waste of good ingredients.  I couldn't finish my salad and the rest went down the drain.

Very tasty dressing - I liked it a lot. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. I kept the proportions the same but added a bunch more fresh cilantro.

Thank you for this recipe, I really liked it!  I tend to water my dressings down a bit anyway, so I really appreciated the lightness of this dressing.
