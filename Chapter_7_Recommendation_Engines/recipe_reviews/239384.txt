I had two large pieces of round steak & cut it into 4 pieces.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  Recipe doesn't say to cover, but I did after about 45 minutes as the meat was pretty  tough.  I adjusted the oven temp up to 375, too.  Not sure why the recipe calls for all the flour, which I ended up having to toss.  I think if I make this again, I will put some of the flour into the soup mixture, as it was very runny.  The taste of the sauce was good, but would have preferred it had thickened up while baking.
