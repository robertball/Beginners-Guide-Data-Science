This was A-MAZ-ING!! Very easy to put together and had a rich luscious cheesy flavor. Instead of the olive oil, cooked some bacon to chop and add in and used the drippings to saute the onion and mushrooms. Will definitely be making this again soon.

Very good. Didn't really like the sausage flavor. Next time will make without the meat. Very filling. Great pasta dish.

It was a good quick meal for my family. Everyone liked it and I would make it again. The only thing I did differently was the meat. My grocery store was out of the sausage, so I used chicken, which was probably a better choice for my family anyway.

I loved this recipe.  I usually do not make things with less than a few hundred "loved" it ratings but I'm glad I did with this recipe.  I had to use a few different substitutions since I was snowed in but it was absolutely delicious.  I used sweet Italian sausage for the chicken sausage, Blue cheese for the Gorgonzola, smoked Gouda for Fontina and made my own Alfredo sauce using the "quick & easy alfredo sauce recipe" from this site.

I made this for company and everyone was raving.  I used raw casing tom/bas/mozz sausages so the only thing I changed was the order in cooking the ingredients.  I agree with another user that its, by no means, a budget dish as these johnsonville recipes usually are; it is however, completely worth splurging on the gorgonzola! Between that and the tortellini being teeny little cheese stuffed pillows, make this dish for anyone who claims to be a cheese-lover in your life! Pair it with a light Caesar salad for an instant win!

This recipe is AMAZING!  It is a little more expensive to buy all of the cheese for the ingredients, however, it is totally worth it. You won't be disappointed.

Changed up the cheeses a bit to use what I had and used a different sausage because the one listed wasn't available. I used a spicier sausage to cut through all the creaminess. Super yummy. will do again.

Loved this recipe.  I made my own sauce using 1//2 cup fast free half and half and 1/2 cup heavy cream with 1/4 butter, Clove of garlic and fresh pram.  The taste of sausage was a little over powering.  Next time I will try chicken

This was great!  I did not use sausage, but simply crumbled some bacon into the mixture at the time the recipe called for the sausage.  Didn't change anything other than also added some fresh spinach to the onions and mushrooms.  I'm not a gorgonzola fan but I was making this for the gorgonzola fan in my life, and I'll admit that I really enjoyed it! :)

I think this dish has a lot of potential. I was really rich, but not in a good way. First I think 1/2 an onion would be plenty. That combined with Gorgonzola cheese was too much. It's all I can taste now. I bought Johnsons Cheddar sausage me and my husband didn't like this type of sausage it was a little too much like a hot dog. I think if less onion was used, different sausage and maybe different cheese proportions it could be a winner. If I get the courage up to give this recipe a second chance I will make changes.
