I thought just by looking at the recipe that there was too much Italian seasoning and not enough garlic. It is a garlic spread after all. I only used about half of the written Italian seasoning a half teaspoon more garlic and a bit more Parmesan because I like more cheese in the topping. It did very well and I would make it again with these modifications.

I made this to top fresh Italian bread to make garlic bread to serve w/a pasta dinner. It came together quickly w/staples and had nice flavor. I think I'd like to try a dollop atop a grilled steak. Mmmmm. THANKS Calibizaro!

Too much Italian seasoning -- it overpowered the garlic taste. Would not make again.

I was going to cut the seasonings in half but decided to try it full strength first. I should have cut them in half. My family said TOO POWERFUL. But will definitely try it again
