This casserole was so good! It was sweet and savory all at once and was a huge hit with my family. One criticism is that I have never cooked fresh squash before and it took me FOREVER to thinly slice it for the recipe. I later realized that if I had just cooked the squash in the oven for even ten or fifteen minutes, this recipe would have been so much faster! Also, I used butternut squash and acorn squash. The butternut worked better.

Oh man was this GOOD! It was so dee-lish that the whole family ate it AND complimented it. Can't wait for leftovers. I'm thinking about leaving out the chicken and stuffing my Thanksgiving turkey with this. YUM!

everybody loved it. I agree it was too watery though. Maybe cut the soup and cream cheese down.Would give it 5 * if it weren't for that!

It was OK but a lot on the blend/too goody-vanilla side for my taste. Next time I would have to make something similar using smoked ham/bacon...something to give this dish a bit of punch.

The best part of this dish is that it doesn't taste like vegetables. I cooked a quick box of Jiffy Corn Bread, browned chicken in a skillet while cutting up the vegetables. Should have had the cheese grated earlier, but other than that it was nice to use up so many vegetables waiting to be used. Might try with spicy sausage instead of chicken next time.
