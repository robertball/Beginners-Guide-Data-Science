My husband loves Greek food so I thought he would love this, but when I asked his input he suggested rating it only 4 stars!  His reason was now that he has been eating goat cheese rather than feta on his salads everyday, he has developed a preference for goat cheese and didn't care for the feta.  I prefer feta and think most people do, so I won't deduct a star for that!  I absolutely LOVED this so I overruled and gave it 5 stars.  Also, I normally don't eat lamb because I didn't think I liked it, but I DID use it in this and it was awesome!  Don't automatically substitute beef if you're not familiar with lamb!  Try it in this recipe, the flavors go great together!

Absolutely delicious and REALLY filling. I was looking for a new take on a stuffed pepper recipe, and this was it. The only thing that I would change is a little more basil, a little less oregano.  But, if you are looking for a delicious all-in-one dinner, this is it.  I also had a salad on the side, and it was way too much food... the pepper is all you need!

I used orange peppers, substituted brown rice for the orzo pasta, used 5 cups of fresh spinach and beef for the lamb.  It was soooooo delicious that I'll be making this again.

Very good recipe.  I was looking for something to use up the last of my orzo and I love stuffed peppers so this one really caught my eye.  I added about 1/2 C pine nuts and just a sprinkle of parmesan on top.  I also cut my peppers in half (stem to base) for smaller portions.   I prefer my peppers a little softer than these came out so next time I will bake them for 1 hr.   Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious filling. I took some suggestions and added pine nuts. Also, instead of two chopped tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes and I think it could still use some more sauce. I added some dried mint and a dash of cinnamon for more Greek flair. This does make a ridiculous amount of filling, unless your peppers are gigantic, you can fill a 1 1/2 quart casserole easily to cook alongside. I've made this with lamb and beef, lamb is tastier but the beef is pretty good too!

These were good, I'm sure I threw the flavor off a little because my budget just can't afford for lamb so I replaced it with ground turkey.  I had tones of extra filling and found that we highly preferred it in the peppers.  The peppers added a extra layer of flavor.  I agree these are quite filling and good! Thanks for the recipe! :)

Tina is a genius! These are so delicious.  I used .5 pounds lamb with 1 pound ground beef (will either use all beef next time or still maintain the same ratio as I don't love lamb), and half an onion based on personal preference.  To circumvent what everyone was saying about the undercooked pepper, I blanched them for 2 minutes each in boiling water then threw them into ice water immediately.  After filling and baking, there was still some crunch left to the peppers but they were cooked perfectly.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the T and thought these were amazing.  Also, this recipe makes a perfect amount of stuffing. Most recipes that require stuffing - you're always worried that there isn't enough stuffing, but this made enough to fill 6 green peppers (I always get them from Whole Foods - they have the most gorgeous, giant green peppers), and leave some loose for extra nibbling and round out that meal for the hubby.  Most of the time I have to bump up a 6 serving meal to make 6 true servings for us, but this one is dead on.

Excellent.  Made to recipe, no changes and they were very delicious.  Garnished with fresh basil.  Light but filling and low in fat, very healthy meal.

Absolutely a keeper!  I did sub 4 c. fresh spinach, chopped and cut back a bit on the basil and oregano.  Thanks, Tina!  (BTW, I preheated the oven to 350 degrees.)

We enjoyed it.  I had to use beef only because I could not find lamb at the store but I can imagine that would make it even better.  We both liked the filling more than the peppers though.  Maybe I will just use the filling recipe in the future.

These were awesome! I'm sure they'd be great as written, but I modified to suit my fridge and preferences. :) I used about 1.3lbs ground turkey I had, browned and seasoned in a skillet after browning the onion and garlic (less oregano and more basil than written). I made 1 cup (pre-cooked amount) of quinoa and added that when it was done, added 2 large diced tomatoes, a large handful of fresh spinach chopped, the can of tomato paste, about 2 cups of feta (we love feta and get it in bulk at Costco), and also added half a can of diced tomatoes because it seemed like it needed more moisture to go around the extra meat and quinoa. Cut 8 peppers lengthwise, rubbed in olive oil, arranged in 2 baking dishes (couldn't fit all the halves), salted and peppered them, then stuffed and baked for 35 min at 400 and sprinkled grated parm on top in last 5 min. Peppers were soft enough, and it was freakin' delish in a dish. Took one dish to a friend who just had a baby and she raved. Still had enough filling left over to eat plain (which was also delicious).

I really enjoyed this different take on stuffed peppers.  I left out the lamb b/c I'm vegetarian, but I figure I can still rate the recipe on preparation and overall flavor.  I enjoyed the filling but the recipe does make a lot of it (not really a problem I'll just have that on it's own tomorrow).  I had this with some herbed feta i had laying around and the flavors went together beautifully.  I roasted the peppers at 350 and left them in the oven for a bit b/c I like my peppers nice and soft.  Overall, a really filling and flavorful meal, even without the meat. Thanks for sharing, Tina!

Was looking for a way to do stuffed peppers and this recipe was perfect. I like my peppers a bit softer so I will cook a little longer as I believe another reviewer already mentioned. I also added some cayenne peppers which gave it a nice added kick!

Thanks.

Very tasty! I prepared the recipe as directed and had leftover filling. Since my 22 month old isn't crazy about peppers, this was fine. She really loved the filling itself!

Okay, first and foremost, those pictures don't do this recipe justice lol. But stuffed peppers aren't exactly cute. These stuffed peppers were very tasty. Lamb is a favorite of mine, that's what drew me to this recipe to start with. I followed recipe as is and the meat turned out very tender and juicy. The flavor was spot on, as well. Filled the family up quick and everybody was happy. I might play around with different seasonings next time, we'll see.

Only a few small changes .... Half the recipe so used 1/2bag of fresh spinach chopped, about 1 1/2 cups of canned chopped tomatoes so that there was enough moisture.  Some on the bottom of the pan and a little on the tops, only had 2 peppers so cut in half and mounded with the filling.  Had to use half sharp cheddar and Parma, also a pinch or two or red pepper flakes. Oh yes also finely grated one small carrot just to add extra veggies.  Baked 30 minutes, the peppers were tender and moist, I would call this one a winner!!

Really good! I didn't like the lack of a basting liquid, so I saved some of the pasta water from the orzo and combined it with a can of tomato soup. Delish!!

Made way more stuffing than I could fill in 7 medium peppers, but delicious and really liked not having to parboil the peppers ahead of time.  Liked them a bit crunchy but flavorful, this way.

This stuffing is amazing! The recipe makes way more stuffing than you'd need for 6 peppers,which is fine by me because i like some on the side instead of a whole extra serving. I will par boil my peppers next time as cooking them the way the recipes says calls for a lot of oil and takes longer. Delicious recipe!

if you want to make them lighter, skip the meat, just put tomato sauce inside or the inside of the fresh tomato..also it's 10000x's better if you eat the feta on the side. :-) I don't reccomand cooking it in Greek stuffed peppers..You can also make stuffed tomatos which are also great!
