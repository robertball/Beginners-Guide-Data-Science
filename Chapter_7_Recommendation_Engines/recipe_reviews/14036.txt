I made this for dinner last night using 
the smaller baby eggplants.  I added a 
little italian seasoning for flavor while
cooking the eggplant. Also,I served the pitas with shredded 
lettuce, chopped tomato and chopped green onions.
We topped the pitas with shredded cheese (mozarella
and parmesean blend) and some ranch 
dressing.  Overall the sandwich was very
good. Even the kids enjoyed it. 
I think the original recipe is good,
but would have been a little bland for 
my taste without the additions I had made.

I just loved this. I did things a little different. I chopped up the eggplant and roasted it in the oven with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil spray. I sauted the mushrooms, onions, fresh garlic and red pepper flakes on the stove and added the roasted eggplant. Put everythhing in a whole wheat pita with a little cheese and a tablespoon of low fat ranch. Just wonderful. Thanks for the recipe

These are so good I ran to my computer after I was finished lunch to write a review.
I used whole wheat wraps instead of pita and no ranch dressing or cheese (to cut out calories and fat). I was worried that cutting those things out would make it bland so I let the veggies marinade in red wine vinegar for a couple of minutes and I used garlic salt. I will definitely make these all the time and I'll also try it with the ranch and cheese sometime.

I'm really not all that crazy about vegetables, but I was looking for something different to do with eggplant.  I did add some Italian seasoning for additional flavor.  I thought these sandwiches were really good.  I think they were enhanced by having the cheese and Ranch dressing on them and would have been somewhat bland without them.

I thought this was overall a pretty good recipe. I altered it a bit though, as all of us seem to do:) Instead of pita bread, I used flat bread. I skipped the green pepper. I put lettuce on it. Instead of garlic, I used garlic salt. Also, to give it a little more flavor and a wonderful aroma, I cooked the mushrooms with seasoned redwine vinegar. I think that is the thing that made it the best. Even my picky husband loved it!!

This was a pretty good dish.  I used 4 fresh cloves of garlic (minced) instead of the powder.  I also threw in a couple of handfuls of broccoli florets. (The color is kinda blah without them.  My husband suggested that if you want ranch dressing on it, to lightly spread it on one side of the open pita before you fill it.  That way you will have the ranch taste all the way through and not just the first bite or so.  For those of you who had problems with sogginess, I wonder if you had too much oil---mine was a fine consistency.

Instead of mozzarella I used fat-free crumbled feta cheese and fat-free Ranch dressing. I also bought onion pitas. I think the feta really added flavor.

My mom has to eat fat-free, cholesterol free now and has spent the last three months eating plain grilled chicken breasts and salad. This was a treat that made her smile.

All the vegetables were good together but it made the pita soggy and came apart.  On the 2nd try I sliced all the veggies into thin strips and served it on flour tortillas.  It was so much better!!  It was like eating fajitas without the meat!  I believe when you chop veggies into small pieces they lose their "meatiness", especially eggplant.

Very tasty.  However, I would recommend cooking the eggplant for a few minutes longer, as it required more time to soften while not sacrificing the other veggies.  Also be careful what kind of pitas you buy... I couldn't open mine into pockets!  I used dill ranch instead of plain ranch and it was yummy.

I am not a fan of veggies...however my husband and two of my children are.  They loved this recipe.  Hubby suggested maybe next time to put it in a tortilla.  Also those who did not like ranch used ff italian dressing and thought that was tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was awesome!  My daughter is a vegetarian and found this recipe. We made it together.  Our local grocer did not have eggplant, so we used yellow squash in it's place.  We also added more mushrooms than the original recipe called for, and added fresh garlic.  We needed to add more oil, about 3 tbsp.  This recipe smelled so good cooking, my husband just had to try it.  He thinks he has to have meat with every meal, but after tasting this, he said he could definately eat this vegetarian meal for dinner because it was so good.  My daughter and I loved it, too.  Also, the original recipe only served 4 (instead of 8) in our household, but maybe we make them different.  Thanks for this great recipe, it' a keeper!

Not as great as I thought it would be...but the next day I added breaded chicken fillets (chicken fingers), and that really made all the difference.  On its own, I wouldn't give it that high of a rating. I have a much yummier recipe made with eggplant and roasted red peppers and flattened breaded chicken that I will try to post soon.

This was a very yummy & different recipe.  I used fresh minced garlic & a flat tortilla instead of the pita.  This was a great change from the ordinary everyday sandwiches.

Awesome...and made additions.  Added 1/2 zucchini, and a few sugar plum tomatoes, probably 1/2 a cup, used fresh garlic, the more the better, and 6oz ground beef.  Hubby said great, but more veg less meat next time.  Of course I didn't tell him about the eggplant, he doesn't like it.  Will add to monthly rotation.  Thank you

This was a very good, and easy recipe.  I only gave it 4 because I needed to add something to pep it up.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder, and I added about a tablespoon of fresh basil from my garden.  And I added probably about a 1/4 cup red wine when it was almost done cooking, then cooked it long enough to reduce the liquid.  I used a little fresh parmesan instead of the mozzerella, and put it in a flour tortilla.  I did not use any dressing.  I'll definitely make this again.

Thanks Nikki for this quick and delicious recipe - It was very tasty - I used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder - that's just the Italian in me and I added chicken cut into strips- I put the garlic powder on the chicken and I used whole wheat rollup bread instead of pita.  My husband and I loved this dish - It's definitely a keeper.

It was very easy to make and my whole family loved it! Including my meat-loving boyfriend :) I didn't use ranch..I used white balsamic vinegar, I thought it was better that way.

This was a great way to use the eggplant sitting in my vegetable bowl.  It was so easy and tasted great!  We made our own ranch dressing and it tasted wonderful.  This would also be good with some meat (like lamb) added.

This made for an easy summer meal.  It needed more oil - I used 2 TBSP, and salt to taste.  Also, my family didn't care at all for the green bell pepper.  Next time I will substitute red instead.

Like others before, this was bland.  I tried everything other did (seasoning, dressing, more garlic, etc.) but it was still bland once you got it in the pita.  Hmm, perhaps it was just the kind of pita a used?  I'm not sure....but I don't think I'll make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe though, it was fun to try it!

This recipe is easy and great if you like eggplant.  My boyfriend loved it!  I don't like eggplant that much and I thought it was ok.  Great recipe for vegetarians.  Next time I might add some meat to it so it will be more filling.

This was pretty good!  I thought ranch was a weird fattening ingredient to throw on something so healthy, so I just left it off.  It was good without and plus I'm not even a big fan of ranch anyway, I think a dallop of Greek yogurt would be good?  Anyway, this was a great lunch :)

This was really good, but it's missing something in the taste department to make outstanding. A great lunch, but I'd skip as a dinner dish. Made exactly as written.

This came out pretty good but definetly bland.  It needs a lot more garlic powder and anything else you like, I used cayenne.  I didn't use the ranch dressing to cut the fat, but that probably makes it yummier.
