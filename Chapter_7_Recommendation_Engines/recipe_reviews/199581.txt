This certainly had some kick.  After reading some of the other reviews I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also used smoked paprika, but everything else followed the recipe.  I cut my pork chops into cubes, threw them in a plastic bag with the spices and shook, then sauteed with EVOO.  Served over couscous for a delicious meal!

I didn't really like this recipe at all.  It just didn't taste good to me.  I could taste the sage over powering it, and it was really not that spicy

very nice spice to this one.  I have some leftovers that I'm going to use for tacos tomorrow.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used real butter and evoo and I didn't have sage, BUT I think I would like it better without.  I served it with home made apple sauce and a tossed green salad.  Thanks for sharing.

I used thin pork chops, and I used a pat of butter with the olive oil instead of the butter spray.  If I make them again, I will use way less sage (or none at all).  It was overpowering.  I will probably use a little more cayenne, too, but we like spicy food.  This was not a hit with my kids, but my husband and I thought they were pretty good.  I will probably fix them again sometime with a few changes.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good. My husband enjoyed it as well. I followed it exactly and did include the sage. I think the sage did add a great herb flavor. Very good!

Nice flavor.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half because I was afraid it would be too spicy for us to eat and it came out pretty good.  Just enough heat for me.  I'll probably use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time because it was a little saltier than I like.  Good recipe and very quick and easy to put together.

Yummy!!! WOW! Now these things have some heat! A bit too spicy for the kids but my husband and I loved them... lol, however I just may have heartburn for the first time in a while after eating these! But I must mention, I used 12 pork chops so I did the spice rub x4 so that could be why.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make these again but may cut down on the cayenne.

Good recipe.  Nice change from the traditional fried pork chops.  I followed the recipe and my husband and I really liked these.

Fantastic seasoning combo.  The only thing I did different (after reading other reviews) I bought boneless center cut chops, an inch thick and cut it into chunks maybe 1x1.  I doubled the seasoning and placed it into a zipper baggie, shook to combine the seasoning then threw in the pork chunks.  I worked the seasoning into the meat good and let it set on the counter for about 20 minutes or so.  A do over in this house for sure.  My husband even said it'd be good in a fajita with some cheese, sour cream and sauteed onions

I would make this again.I made it a little differently.
I added 1/2 tsp.chili powder. I used thick pork chops  so, I browned them then finished cooking in the oven.This would make a great rib rub.

This could not have been easier or tastier!  I halved the recipe to use two 7 oz. pork loin chops, which I cut into cubes.  I used 1/4 tsp. of ground sage and I think it mellowed the flavor of the cumin just a little.  It did not overpower the flavor and I think I will try just a little more next time.  I mixed the spices in a ziploc bag then added pork pieces and shook.  I served with steamed veggies and rice pilaf.  It was a super easy, super quick, tasty meal.  Thanks!!

I am a novice cook, and this was SO easy and SO delicious.  My husband commented, "this is the best pork chop I've ever had," and proceeded to polish off seconds.  I did not alter the recipe at all.  This will definitely be a repeat dish in my house.

AS I write this the chops are in the skillet and smelling good!
I have finished cooking these pork chops and they look and taste good.
I am more impressed with the ease and color of the product, it was a quick fix and very economical. There was too much sage and cayenne, but not enough garlic salt. I would be hard pressed to give this three stars. So two and a half it is. I'm going to rework this recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I did tweak it a bit.  My husband and I are not huge fans of sage so we used only a pinch.  I was also out of cayenne pepper and replaced it with chili powder.  I think it would be just right if I had the cayenne pepper, but was still very good as described.  I used very thin cut pork chops and they cooked up just great!

Definitely not our favorite recipe.  The flavor of the cumin really overpowered everything else.  To eat these, we ended up covering the pork chops with BBQ sauce.  We won't be saving this recipe.

I don't like pork very much but had some in the freezer that I need to use.  So I wanted to try this recipe because I had both chops and all ingredients.  It is OK but it wasn't very spicy (to me at least) and needed some salt.  I am the type of person who eats jalapenos with my breakfast and have a high tolerance for spicy food thanks to abuelas cooking.

Super, SUPER yummy. I made five pork chops all together (I just mixed up the spices in a shaker and just sprinkled the heck out of my pork chops before cooking) and none survived. My husband even ate THREE! Good stuff and NO SALT! I served this with a Lemon Cream Sauce that I lightened and filled with good fresh veggies and shirataki pasta. Super filling dinner.

i was a little hesitant at first on this one, but when i cook it, it turned out real good. My family love, but they think it was spicy.  I did not use the spray on butter because i did not feel like running back to store, so is just increase the olive oil a little.

I just made this tonight for dinner and loved it.  I made the recipe exactly as it says and loved the amount of heat that it had. I served over chilled applesauce which was the perfect balance to the spicy rub...I will definitely make this dish again!

Came out spectacular. Little hot in some areas because I did not properly mix the spices thoroughly.  I may take down the cayenne pepper a bit so the can be more accessible for my kids.

holy cow! this is good! I used thick cut chops, lots of cajun seasoning, one T of butter with couple spoons of olive oil, seared on high heat both sides minute or two then covered and cooked, turning once, on med heat around 5 minutes. i turned off the heat and let them sit a few minutes. made a lovely meat juice for mashed potatoes. definitely a keeper.

We liked this but I only gave it four stars because I thought it was a little too spicy.  But I generally don't like things really spicy either.  I cut the boneless pork chops into small pieces and tossed them in a bowl with the spice mixture.  I ended up turning it into a sweet and sour pork dish.  I'll make it again but a little more mild.

Flavor is an understatement with these! I doubled the spice topping (I didn't have confidence the current amount would cover 4 pork chops) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a GREAT meal. I love spicy food, and this pork was just that!

This recipe was perfect, simple and flavourful..  I did sub ground mustard for the sage, as I didn't have sage.  I will use this over and over.

It was ok. I think i was missing a little something because I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I will make it again and be sure to use salt but it is not in my top 5...

Leave out the cumin for more of a kick =) Personally, it's alot tastier without the cumin anyway. I made this with cilantro poblano rice which is "green rice" over in the food network website recipes.. It was great!! I also made spicy baked fries with this also from this website and my husband was in loveee

The only reason I don't give this more stars is because I'm not a huge fan of pork.  However, it was flavorful and, most important, FAST!

This tasted fine but I didn't get much of the "cajun" flavor. Next time I might add a little something hotter to give it more of a cajun taste.

Wasn't expecting these to be so good.  I had 2 pork chops but kept most of the seasoning amounts for 4 servings.  Only thing I didn't have was the cayenne pepper.  Yum!

I followed the recipe but diced up my pork chops and added some onions,then sautéd them on a skillet. They had a unique flavor and they would be perfect with ground beef,potatoes,bell peppers and onions to make a nice breakfast skillet.

Awesome!! Nice and spicy.  I did a teaspoon of all ingredients to make sure and get a good coat of spices.  I didn't have any cayenne so I just used a cajun spice.  So good, my whole family loved it!

Loved this spicy recipe! Perfect "cajun" flavor! I added chili powder and chopped onions to my rub for extra flavor. Paired this with red beans and rice in dirty sauce and mashed potatoes. *Quite spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, use a bit less of the cayenne pepper. :)

This was good.... While I was cooking, the cajum rub smoked up my house and everybody started to cough.....lol  I am not sure if I would cook it inside any more.  Maybe it should have been cooked on the grill outside.

Tender, tasty and easy! I cut the sage in half and added 1/4 teaspoon of dried mustard and a couple shakes Jalapeno salt. Served with unsweetened applesauce and buttered corn. Will be making again soon.

Good Rub for the chops. I would use less Cumin next time and sprinkle the rub on each chop so that they wont get over seasoned.

So, I chopped various cuts of pork(family pack), and coated the meat with the mixture(used 1/3 of the sage, and double cayanne, added fresh garlic to my olive oil and fried the mixture. Removed it from the skillet and fried some sweet frozen corn, pinch of sugar with red onions until lightly browned, added some chicken broth mixed with 1 tsp balsalmic vinegar and 1 tsp corn starch, let it boil, then I added the pork back to the skillet and covered for 5 minutes.  let sit for 3 minutes to thicken even more. Served it over some homemade cilantro rice, topped with fresh lalepenos!!!!
Yummy!!!!!!

My family loved this! i served it with apple sauce, fries, and a salad. i used garlic powder instead of salt and added minced garilc. i let it sit for about an hour and cooked it on the bbq. i didnt really measure the amount of ingreds. i kindof went by taste and rub it in on both sides with my hands. this would be good to season and stick in the freezer for a fast good meal.

Delicious and just the right amount of spice. I added 1/4 tsp of chili powder, and since I didn't have garlic salt, I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and added 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Yummy!  I will make this again.

A little too salty. I would follow the advice of others and use garlic powder, or at least cut back on the garlic salt. I also substituted dill instead of sage and it was an excellent addition!

The spice mix was so good. Husband said they were a bit too spicy, but I loved them. I will make these again. But I guess that I will have to tone down the cayenne for the husband. I will make these again though! Thanks

Good flavor, but a lot of heat.  For our personal tastes we will probably halve the cayenne next time.

This was awesome.  I didn't use the sage because I didn't have any.  I cut up the pork chops into cubes, covered it with the spices and cooked it in a skillet with olive oil.  AMAZING TASTE!!!!!

This was okay. I had hoped that it was going to be more flavourful, but it was lacking. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I used chicken for this recipe- and it was great!  I doubled the cayenne, got rid of the sage, and halfed the cumin.  As you can imagine, it was pretty spicy- I just added a dollop of sour cream and served it with rice, black beans, and warm tortillas. This one's a keeper!

Very moist.  I did the recipe from memory so the exact measurements are not know, but I could've had a slightly heavier hand with the seasons.

I really liked this seasoning. I diced up the pork and added a variety of veggies and the whole thing was spicy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and my only suggestion is to add a touch of salt.

Tasty! We barely ever eat pork but wanted to try sometime different. These were very easy and quick to make and we already had most of the ingredients on hand at home. Just the right amount of spice.

After reading other review, I used about half as much sage and a little less than the full amount of cayenne pepper called for by the recipe. They were tasty, but not as moist as I would have liked them to be.

This recipe was amazing!  It was super easy and quick and tasted amazing.  I made some mashed potatoes and fresh green beans as sides which worked quite well together.  I left out the sage as i couldn't find it in the supermarket, but the taste was still awesome.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you so much!

This is so simple, easy and quick! The flavor is awesome.  I did use chili powder instead of cayenne because I was out. I followed the recipe exactly and the spicyness wasn't strong (which was good because my fiance isn't a fan of spicy, he loved this) but I love spicy and still enjoyed it! I am looking forward to eating this again.

I didn't use the sage because other people said it overpowered. Instead I used a dash of Italian seasonings and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Turned out great! Love the heat!

Everyone else thought they were pretty good, but I didn't like them all that much. It was ok. Made exactly how the recipe called, a little more cayenne.

This was very delicious. I followed the recipe almost to the T! The only difference is that I used garlic powder and then used 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt. Perfecto! Too spicy for my children (2 and 1) but my brother and my husband loved it! 

I will definatley be making this again. If you dislike spicy food I suggest substitute with chili powder and not cayenne. ***Warning*** This recipe will make your kitchen a gas chamber due to the peppers used.

These were flavorful, tender and delicious. So quick and easy to make, too. I didn't have sage so I added dried basil instead and it worked out great.

This recipe was a big disappointment.  I was really expecting something better.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Found it to be bland.  Will try to add some flavor to the leftovers, but I won't be making this one again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We both really enjoy spicy food and even though sometimes he has trouble with his stomach, he said he had no problem with the spice and the flavor was very good. We don't eat much salt so I used garlic powder instead of salt. I did cook it too long I think as I used thick chops and they got a little too dry. That was my mistake.

I am really sorry that I can't give this recipe a higher rating.  After reviewing the recipe, I hurried home to try it.  I am from south Louisiana, and I can't find anything "cajun" about the flavor. I won't be making this dish again, I'm sorry!

Very Good & flavorful although we did increase ALL amounts of the spices o ya we also added crushed red pepper ground in coffee grinder. We will make again for sure, also recipe really is fast & simple.
UPDATE: We made it again & this time we added extra cayenne again & garlic not called for but pleased with results.

We love cajun seasoning. So I multiplied the seasoning blend several times and for the garlic salt called for in this recipe, I used about 1/3 garlic salt and 2/3 granulated garlic. So glad I did. This was really quick and tasty!

Nothing that great. You could use Cajun spice, rub on pork chops & grill for a better taste & no stove mess to clean up.

First, I just want to say that I read the reviews.  The good ones and the not so good ones.  Invariably, like with the reviews on this recipe, a low scoring reviewer will state "I don't like port" or "I don't care for spicy food."  Then don't make and rate the recipe!  That's unfair to the person submitting it, and to the people who rely on ratings and reviews while searching for recipes!  
That said, this recipe is awesome!  I love spicy food and these pork chops had great kick!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the sage.  I didn't have any so I omitted it from the recipe.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the results were amazing!  I served them with garlic butter penne.  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

These turned out really good, spice mixture was just perfect & the chops were tender. I did cover the chops for about 6 minutes after browning them.

Yummy recipe that I have used several times.  The only thing I change is using garlic powder instead of salt. We love this rub on grilled pork chops...i add a little EVOO to the dry ingredients before rubbing it on the meat.

Loved this combination of spices; only thing i did different was add a little tony's creole seasoning, used only 1/4 tsp of sage and used garlic powder instead of salt.
I think i am going to try this with chicken:)
yummy:)

I've made this four times now and it has become a favorite.  I make up extra and put in the freezer to cook later.  It's a easy "do ahead" step that makes for a future quick homecooked meal.

These were delicious! They pack some heat but my husband from Louisiana was pleased! We had roasted new potatos with similar spices and grilled asparagus on the side. Wonderful meal!

Lovely. I too changed the garlic salt to garlic powder, but left the rest just the same. The heat is not overpowering, it builds up just the way I like. Will definitely make this again.

Great seasoning that would probably work just as well with chicken.  I plan to make up a batch to save for future use.  I only used half of the cayenne since I'm not huge on hotness and it was the perfect amount of spice for me!

I added some garlic powder and bread crumbs to the parm.  I also used the thick cut, almost an inch, and thought the chops were a little dry.  They also needed about 5-7 more minutes since they were faintly pink in the center.  Seasonings were OK and added some ground pepper on the top.

Real easy — next time, I might try cutting the chops into chunks and tossing the spices into a plastic bag to coat them. Might also make a nice rub for steak.

I should have listened to my gut and halved the cayenne. We like spicy, but this was so strong that it made the chops bitter.

This was a hit at our house. I'll probably tone down the Cayenne pepper next time I make it (I LOVED it, but it was a bit too intense for the younger ones), but other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter, and it will go into the regular rotation. Super-simple and fast to make, plus easy on the wallet.

These chops were good! The spices were pleasantly interesting. Kind of hot so keep some chilled wine on hand :)
When they were done a nice dark brown fond was left in the bottom of the pan so I HAD to caramelize some onions to have alongside!
His first bite my husband said, "Ooh! Cumin!" Then "Mmmm!"
I'll be making this again.

I used 1/2" chops and I really think they were too thin.  But the flavor was very good and different from most of the pork chop recipes I have tried.  I was a little nervous about the cayenne but didn't cut it down.  Very glad I didn't as it gave the whole thing real zip without overpowering it.

Made it for my parents and they said it was incredible! Buy thick center cut pork chops and slice them a little thin when you eat it. Such a good flavor!

I more than doubled the amount of the rub and put it in a ziplock bag.  It was pretty spicy but that is how my family like it.

Yummy. Great spice blend. I reduced the cayenne pepper by half, and the heat level was perfect for me.

Great Recipe!!!!!! I substituted garlic salt with garlic powder and it made a great dry rub, I also grilled mine to get the nice sear marks on the porkchops. I added more paprika and cumin because I like spicy food. Overall, it made a great main dish and I will definitely use this recipe again

Decided to go with a blackened Pork chop using the spice mixture above.   Very good and flavorful, though not much heat.

Made them to the recipe.  Although a very good flavor, I found the chops to be a bit dry.  Think I will brine them next time I make them.

Pros: Super quick - I was done in less than 15 minutes, took less than 20 with all the sides. Easy - With the exception of the sage, I had all the ingredients and mixing them was a cinch.

Cons: Flavor - It wasn't bad, just not as good I was expecting. It was also uneven. My wife right away tasted ths spices, while I are the entire chop and could never pick up the taste. I'm sure I applied it evenly, don't know what could have happened.

I LOVE this recipe. I've done it half a dozen times by now, and everyone that has had it has loved it and wanted more. I'm generally not a fan of spicy, so this about kills me both when cooking and when eating it, but it's too delicious to not have.

These had absolutely no flavor which surprised me as there were quite a few spices involved. My husband hated them and I had to toss the 3 pork chops we did not eat. Also the 10 minutes for cooking is not enough , they were very chewy, pork chops do better simmering in a sauce for a longer period.

I love this!  Just made it tonight for my husband and myself, and it was delicious!  I was afraid it would be too spicy for my taste, but I wouldn't change a thing.  We are both following a carb-restricted diet, and this fit the bill perfectly!  It was great with a salad.

This is a must try! I never made pork chops and it had been awhile since I had them. I actually came across this recipe on Youtube.com and decided to try it. I didn't have dried sage leaves and cumin so I was unable to use those ingredients, but with the absence of those two ingredients the pork chops still came great! The remaining of the ingredients gave the pork chops just the right amount of kick..

I tried it last night - following the recipe to a tee.  There was a little too much cayenne for my son, and my hubby said it could do with a little less cumin.  I thought it was very delicious and so simple it's perfect for a weeknight meal.  I will tweak the ingredients to our family's tastes next time.

First off this is not a Cajun dish.  I live in southern Louisiana and our food down here beats this recipe hands down.  We went by the directions exactly and although the chops were hot and spicy we just did not enjoy the flavor.  Maybe re-naming this "Spicy Pork Chops" would better prepare your taste buds for the onslaught of this spice mixture.  It just wasn't good.

I loved it, my husband liked it but said it's to spicy and my 2 boys wouldn't eat it. I give it a 5 b/c it turned out great and tasted great. I just have picky eatters that don't like anything with a little spice. Now I make theres bland and this for me.

I used fresh garlic instead and let it cook in that, along with a few very small pieces of butter in the pan and it was delicious! I also used ground sage, and felt it added just perfect taste.

i was worried from some of the reviews saying it was on the salty side.. and since i didnt have any garlic salt i just used 1/2 t of garlic powder and 1/2 t of salt.. i loved the taste but felt it needed more salt.. shook some after i cooked it and it was wonderful.. maybe it's bc i didn't use butter spray and just oil.. or idk if the garlic salt would have made the difference.. either way this was super good.. beat the hell out of it with a meat tenderizer.. cooked it in the cast iron skillet.. it came out perfect.. moist, tender, and very tasty.. ty for the recipe

Loved it!  I actually made a slow cooker with my kids this past christmas eve to entice santa to our house first with the sweet smells of country spare ribs southern style like where I am from.  I met my wife in seattle, I am from Louisiana and I have been trapped in this big rainy city eva since!  Enough about me though...When I found this recipe to be bland I said to myself, "self, we gotta get some of mammas spices up on this pig!"  I know my ma would be proud so I gathered up the littlins' and packed'em in nice and right to the Excursion and headed ova to albertsons grocers they're a nice establishment if ya eva need to go out late like I do they is usually open round the clock except of course for holidays and observing the national presidents days...come to think...they is open on the national presidential observance days but holidays none the less most times till ten o'clock and so forth but we went on ova that christmas eve and they was open till ten that night so I had my list my mamma used to keep a little box with notes and measurements so now so do I well I had one of her old notes of spices she had writ it on an old baking soda top the little flap that you spoon through the measurements and flatten out the little spoon so you don't get too much and writ rite on it was Sorghum.  I remember when I was little Daddie would bring us kids down to the old pond to catch catfish and he had a little red boat named Dixie.  He Would say "kids, get up in Dixie! Go on, now!

Absolutely love this recipe, my favorite chop recipe I have had so far
I played around with the spices ratios a bit (little less cayenne pepper, bit more  cumin), replaced garlic salt with garlic powder, and then added salt, but that is just my personal preference
I also used real butter instead of olive oil,  and as it was frying I then basted it with the butter which made it taste even better and nice and moist I also let the chops rest for about 10 minutes

I followed the reciepe exactly and really liked it.  Didn't think it was too spicy and it had a good flavor to it.   Very easy to make.  Took a little longer to cook than what the reciepe calls for but, our pork chops are pretty thick. I will definetly make it again.

This recipe was very easy and tasty! It gave the pork chops a little something extra. My husband liked the spicy aspect of the meal. I will definitely make this again. My husband wants to try this cajun mix on chicken and shrimp for kebobs. I would recommend this quick, easy meal to a friend!

It's spicier than I was expecting, but still very good. I used a lower heat & covered for most of the cook time to keep the chops moist. Very flavorful.

The spice blend on this is awesome!  I followed the review that suggested cubing the pork chops and subbing garlic powder for garlic salt.  I sauteed just with olive oil and threw in some diced tomatoes and some diced red pepper.  I served it over quinoa.  Seriously delicious!

Love this!! We love spicey everything with bold taste.  I cooked the pork chops, cumins was a little stronger, so I used a little less the next time.  I am cooking it the recipe but flounder instead of pork, I'll let you know how it goes.

This recipe was very easy, which is why I chose to try it, but I don't think that the combination of spices tasted right. I think it was the cumen that I didn't feel really seem to taste right with the other spices. It was good, but I wouldn't say that it was great.
