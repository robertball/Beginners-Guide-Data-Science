Very good and very easy to make. I added about a cup and a half of steamed broccoli to the end product and, Voila, one dish meal. Thanks for sharing.

It went over really well for my family of 8. I doubled the recipe and served it with peas and carrots. After I made the dish I put it into a casserole dish added more Parmesan cheese to the top and broiled it just long enough to brown the top.   For my super picky eater I kept out some of the plain noodles added a little evoo and Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and she was super happy.

I used tuna instead of chicken and added broccoli, and it was delicious.  Not gourmet by any means but very easy and fast to make.

I seasoned the chicken with not only pepper, but garlic, italian seasoning, and salt as well.  I used Cream of Broccoli instead of Chicken and Broccoli.  Overall, very good.  A thumbs up from my husband as well.

Was easy to make and I followed the directions exactly. It wasn't bad but really nothing special. It was a very creamy chicken noodle thing. If it wasn't for the brocolli I added I doubt my picky daughter would have ate her supper

Ok this was just not to my liking.  I doubled the 'sauce', using two cans of Crm of Chicken being as we're not big broccoli fans, when it's not fresh.  1 cup milk, 2/3 cup parm. chz.  It was really thick and kinda gritty, and a bit over parmesan cheesy.  Like too much cheese flavor for us.  I added in my precooked chicken, my frozen veggies, and my uncooked noodles, wondering just how the noodles were going to cook in all this thick goop.  After a half an hour and they were hardly done???  I added a half a cup of hot water... stirred.  Added another half a cup of hot water.  That seemed to thin it out a bit, and cut the flavor down a bit.  Still seemed to be too salty and missing something, so I added in some garlic powder and Italian Seasoning, that helped a little. End result, another 15/20 mins to cook the noodles, and after an hour or more to prepare this 'easy' dinner, my family looked at me like I was crazy. We couldn't even eat it.  What a waste.
