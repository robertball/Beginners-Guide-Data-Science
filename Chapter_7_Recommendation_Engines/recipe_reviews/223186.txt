Hope you're not overly sensitive about alterations...but I can't eat bell peppers...so I deleted that item.  I used home-canned turnip greens instead of fresh spinach and all we can say is: "WOW...this was very good!"  I'm sure the original recipe would be very great as well...but  I had to make do with what I had.  Hubby was initially hesitant to try...but after an initial bite...dug in with so much enthusiam there were no leftovers!
