So, so good! This was my first time trying the Gevalia Cold Brew, and while it seemed a little pricey, if you consider how much you save by making these at home, it's well worth it!  I made "Simple Vanilla Syrup" (another recipe by the submitter of this recipe) to use in this. So quick and easy, we'll be making these often!

First, thank you for sharing this simply delicious iced coffee recipe. The ingredient measurements were perfect-not too sweet and not too strong- just right!! Nearly a half- century old and I'm learning to enjoy coffee. Looking for a way to ease off Starbucks and keep some $$ in my pocket, I began "studying" how to make coffee here in Allrecipes and YouTube (no joke). Now confident with making hot coffee, I was ready to step out into the cold brew coffee world and have some fun. I admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly and took the liberty of making a few tweaks such as, 1) cold brewed Breakfast Blend coffee in Bodum French Press (12+hours), 2) drizzled the walls of the cup with caramel and dark chocolate sauce, 3) used non-dairy coconut creme and 4) coffee ice cubes. The coffee ice cubes ensured the last sip is as good as the first!!

Delicious. Best with cold brew, but makes a really good drink with shots of cooled espresso too. Top with whipped cream for the coffee house experience!

Great recipe, love making these at home. I highly recommend trying different flavor creams (Bailey's Irish cream is one of my favorites)!

The ingredients and measurements are spot on to what I would expect a macchiato to taste. I will definitely keep getting the cold coffee and this recipe is going in my saved recipes. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted great! My coffee didn't stay on top. Maybe because my milk was one 1% and wasn't thick enough. Needless to say tasted Carmelly and sweet but not too sweet. Enjoyed this drink a lot!

Easy to make and so delicious. I tried this recipe in layers and also stirred up. I like the drink mixed up best. If you like your Caramel Macchiato stirred, I suggest adding the simple syrup after the ice. If you are out of simple syrup just use the Simple Vanilla Syrup recipe by the same cook House of Aqua. Thanks, House of Aqua! ***This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.***

O.M.AMAZING. This recipe is perfection. We have  bunch of coffee snobs in this house and the Gevalia cold blend is really, really, really, really good stuff. So incredibly smooth and just a delicious finish to it. This recipe is a wonderful way to showcase this yummy coffee concentrate. If you like caramelly, vanilla-ey yummy coffee goodness, make this soon. :)This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I omitted the ice cubes and topped it with whipped cream and caramel sauce. I had it with a toasted cinnamon crunch bagel cut into dipping strips. The drink went so well with the bagel. It was a very good combination. I’ve made the recipe a couple times now. It’s definitely a new favorite and a great way to use cold brew.This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

This rivals the big named coffee shop macchiatos. I like mine made upside down, but I made this as directed. I enjoyed the ease of preparation and appreciated the coffee concentrate didn't need to be chilled first!

I have a nice espresso machine at home so I am really into dialing in the perfect grind and amount to extract a good espresso shot. With that said, I enjoy the taste of good espresso and coffee. I found that the Gevalia concentrate is delicious and easy to use, especially for making iced espresso based drinks like the Iced Caramel Macchiato that many people love! You can save so much money by making this drink at home using this recipe. We enjoy walking the zoo on summery nights and I always make this drink to take with us. Make sure you pour the coffee concentrate on top, it's what makes it a "macchiato." Enjoy! ****Macchiato means "marked" which means the drink is marked with espresso  on top. This recipe is "upside down" as it is made similarly in coffee shops.
