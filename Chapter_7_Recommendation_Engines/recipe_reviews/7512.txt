I substituted sunflower seeds for the recommended nuts and didn't regret it. I used 2 eggs and appropriate amount of applesauce and discovered that the 5 eggs listed would have been better. For the drizzle/frosting I had too much left over even though I didn't use the butter at all but used 8oz cream cheese instead of 3oz. I woudl recommend PRESSING the juice out of the crushed pineapple to thicken the drizzle up.
