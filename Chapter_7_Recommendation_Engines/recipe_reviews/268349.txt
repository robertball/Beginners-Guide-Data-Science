Spices didn't blend very well. The oat were a little over cooked. I do plan to try again with some adjustments.

Well, I can' t imagine what I did wrong , but I woke up eagerly expecting a bowl of yumminess and instead found a soupy mess.  I followed the recipe exactly, but It is a nearly inedible goo. And the crock pot has stuff cooked onto it that is going to be a job to clean up.  Yuck. Had high hopes. Big fail.
