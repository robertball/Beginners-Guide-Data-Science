I boiled the artichokes whole, then cut them in half and removed the choke (I think it's easier that way).  Also, we just dip the leaves in butter or mayonnaise when we eat them.  Any way you do it, these are the best artichokes you will ever taste!

made this last night and it was excellent! Cut the chokes in half after the fridge, and choked them, then grilled. Served with a garlic mayonaise instead of butter and they were the best artichokes I've ever had.

delicious!  I made without the wine and liquid smoke, brushed with lemon/butter before grilling.  Made an aoli with lemon and garlic for dipping.  Best artichokes I have ever had.

Delicious.  I loved them!!!! I followed it pretty closely but I didn't use the liquid smoke and instead of using a grill I broiled them and turned them every few minutes. I also put butter on top while I was broiling them.  Oh, and I didn't remove the chokes because that was the best part.

They took a little time becasue of boiling them first, but they were worth it. Jeff loved them.

Made this tonight and was not able to eat it at all.  Thanks for the recipe, but it just didn't appeal to me.  Sorry.

Good Good Good. I have had better but this was really good. The flavor or the wine and spices are lost and not tasted. Still the Artichoke is well cooked and very tender. I think a good butter sauce for dipping can save this recipe
