Okay y'all! I live in the heart of Cajun country down here in Louisiana. So i got tired of all this Cajun soul food. I decided to look up some recipes on here-ran across this one. Now i did almost everything different. All ingredients were used minus the tomato paste and plus a tomato. Now i marinated for six hours.  Then when it was time to brown the chicken i used peanut oil instead of olive. I put it on medium high. And sprinkled a little sugar to help Brown the chicken. After the chicken was really browned on both sides i dumped inn the cilantr Mixture and ALL of the marinade!!! Then i dumped in some turmeric and cumin!! Also added extra Salt and water. I simmered for close to an hour till the chicken was very very tender, almost falling off the bone but not quite. Then last minute dumped inn the yogurt and simmered another ten minutes. Served over rice!! Look this is the bomb.com If you like a lot of flavor...here is the recipe. Please don't waste the marinade. It tastes great added in.

This had lots of flavor.  I marinated about 4 hrs and it got into the chicken but not as much as I would have liked.  Next time I'll go longer. I loved all the fresh ingredients that were used. The sauce was great and you could smell it through out the house as it cooked. I did have two small changes but I don't think it changed things much.  I used 2 jalapenos instead of serrano peppers and a used a big hand full of cherry tomatoes for the tomato.

I got creative with my substitutions but feel I kept the spirit of the recipe.  As I don't care for cilantro; I used fresh parsley instead.  The tomatoe and paste were switched to 1/2c salsa and sour cream for the yogurt.  I also found I needed to add much more water than called for (1/2c or more) in order to have enough sauce.

I was searching for a chicken recipe that was out of the ordinary and this fit the bill to a "T". Great flavors!

I used whole chicken breasts and the chicken turned out moist and tender. It wasn't red like the picture though. It ended up a brown sauce but still really delicious.

I thought it was great. The flavors melded and there was just the right amount of heat. I can see, however, that if less than good quality and fresh ingredients are used, it would be a bit bland.

This was delicious!  I made it following the recipe exactly, and it was one of the best recipes I've made in a long time.  It is definitely worth the effort and will become part of our regular rotation.  My husband and both of my very picky children really enjoyed it as well.  I thought from the ingredients that it might be too spicy, but it really wasn't; even our 2 year old could eat it.

I made this recipe for a second time yesterday, and being in a hurry, condensed the recipe and used substitutions. I had a bit of leftover fresh pesto that I had made yesterday, and so into that I added the  ginger, lemon juice, garlic, a cup or so of fresh basil, and there was some dill in the fridge so I added about a couple of tablespoons of dill and a tomato and blended the whole lot together. Marinated the chicken with this mixture for 10 minutes or so. Heated some veg oil and added the chicken (shaking off as much of the marinade as I could) and fried the drumsticks to seal the meat, and then added the remainder of the marinade, covered and cooked about 15 minutes. Lastly I added the yoghurt ( which I diluted with half a cup of water before adding), covered and simmered another 10 mins and voila! It was done and delicious!! This has possibly turned into a different recipe, but the concept is the same. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was quite delicious! Next time I will try using chicken breast or maybe shrimp but I loved all the flavors together! I did use sour cream instead of yogurt and used more ginger than called for but other than that this was a winner!!!

This was okay, but didn't suit my taste for the meal. I would give it a 3, but my husband and adult daughter liked it, and my husband doesn't like anything; so I gave it a four. I may or may not make it again.

Oh my gosh. So delicious. I was short on time so I don’t think the ginger/garlic was marinating on the chicken for a half hour but it still turned out so good. I also didn’t have any serrano chiles on hand so I used some dried Chile de arbol. They weren’t very spicy at all but I could see how a little heat would make this fish even better. Definitely recommend!!

I followed the recipe pretty close and while it tasted good, it has a strong tomato base that takes over the garlic and cilantro flavors.  Not what I was expecting but still good flavor.  I did skip the peppers and regretted it as this would have added more to a slightly bland tomato sauce the chicken cooked in.  The name is misleading but I did enjoy the leftovers.  This would be great with chicken thighs or breasts.

I had high hopes for this one since I love all of the ingredients. I made it as written but doubled the herbs and spices, except the salt and serrano peppers, and didn't remove the skin. I marinated the chicken for 24+ hours and the garlic and ginger flavors were still over-powered by the cilantro sauce. ( I LOVE cilantro, btw.) 
Just too many steps for it not to be Amazing in my opinion. I Am, however, going to break this recipe into parts and use them in other ways.

I did not have any fresh ginger so I just added a teaspoon of powdered ginger and it was fine. The cilantro is what really makes the flavor great. My husband says we should call this Puerto Rican chicken and absolutely loved the flavoring and juiciness of the chicken!

Loved it! Takes a bit of time to prepare but it's worth it. I added three serranos and it did not turn out too spicy. I also used chicken breast cut into cubes.

I love this recipe! I did a couple things different, I only used boneless skinless chicken thighs and instead of Greek yogurt I used cream and 1 habanero pepper. Turned out fantastic. Creamy with a kick. Loved it!

This wasn't the best chicken I have ever had, it's a o.k base to make a really good recipe i guess. Really bland for my taste though..
