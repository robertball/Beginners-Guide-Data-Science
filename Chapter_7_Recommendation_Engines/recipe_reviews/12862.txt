APRIL 2010 UPDATE  From: Buddy Sizemore
Over the years I've experimented with my original  Oyster Stew recipe, so I wanted to share the following information with you folks. 
A nice addition to my recipe would be to finely minced one large potato (I like Yukon Gold best), then saut√© the potato with the minced celery and shallots.
Also, after considering some of the comments that  a couple of viewers mentioned concerning the "floating" celery and shallots that their husbands didn't particularly care for, I experimented using a microplane to finely grate both the shallots and celery then add them in with the butter and finely minced potato. Before I microplaned the celery I cut the stringy layer off the celery stalks. This is easy to do with a potato peeler This is only a suggestion for thoes who may not like the larger peices of celery and shallots but still want the flavors. I however enjoy the texture.

Another tip would be to allow the half & half or whipping cream (which ever you use) to come to room temperature. Also drain the liquid from the   oysters then add it to the half & half at the beginning of cooking . This will cut down the time it takes to bring the mixture to a rolling simmer/boil.
 This is my family's favorite indlugence. 
  I ALWAYS USE FRESH OYSTERS!
Thank's to all who have posted reviews, I'm thrilled that the majority enjoy my recipe! And, with respect to the FEW negative reviews...well that just leaves more stew for the of us!

I made this for my dad.  He has eaten a lot of oyster stew in his 77 years and he says this is the BEST oyster stew he has ever eaten.  It's amazing how something so simple can be so delicious.

This turned out so well.  Since I'm in MN I used canned oysters.  I grew up on them in my oyster stew, so I figured it would be fine.  The taste is fabulous.

very easy and hearty dish with enough delicious butter to satisfy people who would not normally go anywhere near an oyster in it's unsubmerged format! 

Buy oysters in the shell even if you never opened one, as you can pop them in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes to loosen them up, and then use a paring knife to cut the meat from the shell.  This is oyster season (R months) and 2 dozen oysters is enough for this recipe.  Reserve all liquid exuding from the oysters and strain before adding to the stew.  The microwave method seems like a hideous shortcut but opening them by hand at the last minute for dinnertime is a pain too!  Good cooking!

This was very easy and foolproof. The taste was surprisingly delicious even though there were so few ingredients.  We added a few oyster crackers before serving and it was exceptional.  I highly recommend this stew!

OK, here in rural NC, shallots and fresh oysters are hard to come by. Funny, I thought a container WAS fresh... vs. fried and frozen. Anyway, this was INCREDIBLY EASY... HOWEVER  you MUST keep stirring. I got distracted and it boiled and curdled a bit. But still yum. Next time I'll search harder for shallots and add more pepper. Dice the celery finer too. A potoato would be a good touch... make it go further. Will revisit for the holidays. Thanks!!

Very good.  Used 2 cups half n half, 2 cups whole milk.  Also used a red onion instead of shallots.  Although the container of oysters was only 8 oz, it was still very tasty.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic and so easy to make. For some reason, it's hard to find the fresh containers of oysters here on the Florida east coast, so I've even used canned at times. It's good either way. I used a pint of fat-free 1/2&1/2 and a pint of fully-fat 1/2&1/2 the last time I made it and couldn't tell the difference.

Very good recipe.  We are an 'oyster stew' family, having it at least several times a month during the winter.  

Regarding this particular recipe: we like a smooth, milky broth, so after sauteing the celery and shallots, I whirled them around in the blender with a little of the milk.

Also, because we eat so much oyster stew and think that much cream/half & half might blow us up like a piece of inflatable furniture, but still like the rich taste that plain milk doesn't give, we substitute canned evaporated milk for some or all of the cream/half & half.

And when we serve it, we also put a selection of seasonings on the table so that folks can dust a little onto their soup, if they wish.  Most popular are curry powder, cajun seasoning (Prudhomme or Emeril), smoked Spanish paprika, or my personal favorite, Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.

And one last caveat.  For those unaccustomed to using fresh oysters in a tub or jar, you're well-advised to first lift the oysters out of the liquid and set them aside.  Then drain the liquid slowly, disturbing it as little as possible, and leaving a small amount in the bottom of the tub.  There are ALWAYS small bits of sand or shell in there, and biting down on a piece of shell is no fun.  In fact, my last tub actually had a pearl in it.  Charming, but not worth a tooth.

This was VERY good and easy.  My husband didn't like as much because he wasn't crazy about the "floating" celery and onions, lol. But it was very tasty and the kids loved it.

This is oysters in milk and not very good.  I added a lot of cornstarch to try to thicken it up and it didn't work.  Not worth the trouble.

I give this 5 stars for simplicity and flavor. My tip is using the same pot to saute' the shallots and celery, then adding the liquids and oysters.  I was able to prepare the soup with all ingredients, except the oysters, and let stay warm, while entertaining our guests. Then, just before serving, I added the oysters, heated to cook and then served hot. Pretty convenient for a small dinner party and to not be at the stove the whole time.  Our guests love the stew.
I served a small baby greens salad with vinigarette and a clump of fresh crab on top. Great seafood combo!

Absolutely delicious!  This is the fifth time I've prepared this recipe this
winter and I look forward to preparing it each time.  As other users have
noticed, using half-and-half is not a strict requirement.  I have usually
prepared this stew with 1.5 pints of heavy cream instead.  This makes for a
very rich, creamy stew that couples amazingly well with fresh crusty bread.
I have also added the minced celery earlier than the shallots, since it takes
more time to cook (al dente 15 minutes for shallots, 30 minutes for celery;
tender add fifteen minutes).  Also, I see little need for flour or other
thickener.  Perfect as is ...

If you're going to alter the recipe and make it YOUR way don't bother leaving a review because you are not reviewing the authors recipe you're reviewing YOUR VERSION.

Oyster stew has been a family tradition in our family now for many years. My father made it for us kids every Christmastime usually on Christmas Eve. This receipe is a great variation and I tried it this year myself - unable to go "home" for the holidays, so I made oyster stew myself for the first time using this receipe, and it turned out great!!!! Everyone loved it.

Best oyster stew I have ever had and made!  The only thing I changed was that instead of a quart of half & half, I used 2 cups half & half and2 cups of heavy whipping cream.  It was amazing!

Can't say enough about this ~I should have doubled the recipe for XMas Eve it went so fast.  Everybody raved -including some of the picky teens.  I didn't think this recipe would be much better than the old oyster/milk/salt/pepper standby that I usually use -bit it was!!  Thanks so much for sharing this -it's the BEST!

Buddy, Buddy, Buddy!!! I have been using your recipe for several years now, and I don't know why I haven't reviewed it sooner. Making Oyster Stew for Christmas Eve has been a tradition in my family for generations. Unfortunately I am the only one keeping it alive. If more people tried my version of your recipe I could bring the tradition back I am sure! I do tweak your recipe just a bit, but I think you would approve. I amp up the calorie count by going whole hog, or is it cow, with heavy cream, instead of half-and-half. It's Christmas, so what the hay. I also add a dash or three of worcestershire sauce and just before I take it off the heat I stir in a shot or two of good sherry. My godmother taught me that and it adds a nice touch to the stew that I have grown fond of. We like to butter rounds of Norwegian Lefse and dip that into the stew, the butter melts into the stew and adds even more richness.  I love it, I love it, I love it!! Thank you for bringing your wonderful recipe into my repertoire.

I grew up eating my grandparents Oyster Stew and loved it and have made it before but wanted to find a recipe with more substance, so tried this.  WORD TO THE WISE, do not use FAT FREE 1/2 and 1/2 I got it by accident and it had a weird sweet taste that almost ruined the stew, I had to over salt & pepper it to cover that weird sweet taste.  I too grated the celery, onion, and potatoe and the results were great, my husband who hates celery didn't even notice it!!  Great recipe just get the correct ingredients ;)

Simple and excellent recipe!  Sometimes, the simpler, the better!  This is the case here.  I made it for the first time on Xmas eve.  Everyone raved about it, including myself.  I will continue to make this recipe for any seafood event.  It‚Äôs better than any oyster stew I‚Äôve had in any restaurant.  Thank you.

My 91 year old father in law was craving oyster stew "from the old days." He absolutely loved this recipe. And it's SO easy to make.

Im sure this was excellant just exactly the way it was written but I come home hungry had 2 cans of store bought oyster no half and half no shallots.  So I sauteed onions and celery in butter.  Boiled me a few diced potatoes in water.  Did the rest cayenne pepper and hot sauce.  Used milk.  A few drops of Worchestire and it was the Bomb!!!!

I made this stew for my brother who had been recovering from By-Pass surgery and requested it.  I found this stew very easy to make I used fresh oysters and he was absolutely delighted.  I never tasted oyster stew before and I was very pleased with the taste.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE.

I made this with canned oysters and a few tweaks to the recipe.  I used 4 T. butter and it was delicious, though next time I'll cut back a little more on the butter (trying to lose a few pounds lol).  I diced about 1/4 c. onion and cooked it in the butter til tender.  Stirred in 1 T Old Bay and cooked some more.  Drained the oysters and added them to the pan with the onion.  I chopped the oysters up finely with a spoon as they heated in the pan.  Then stirred in 1 t. parsley (this helps disguise the green stuff in the canned oysters, lol).  I stirred in whole milk - didn't really measure, but about 3 c.  Heated almost to boiling, then turned down, added salt and pepper to taste, and a dash of hot sauce.  Stir well and spoon into bowl.  Honestly, this tasted just as good or better than the oyster stew I got from a local restaurant known for their fresh seafood.  It looked beautiful too.

I am personally not a fan of shellfish, and I have never eaten oyster stew.  My husband loves it, though.  During this recent cold snap, my hubby remarked that it was a shame I didn't like oysters because he would surely enjoy a bowl of oyster stew right about then.  So I did an online search of oyster stew recipes and settled on yours because it seemed relatively easy to make, and the vast majority of the reviews were favorable.  I followed the recipe as best I could:  I used finely chopped red onion with garlic powder sprinkled over it in place of the shallots, and canned oysters.  Even so, once I was finished and had my hubby"taste test" it to fine-tune the seasoning, he was blown away.  And after 2 bowls of the stew, he told me that it was the best oyster stew he'd ever had!  I tried it and I'm still not a fan, but I will not mind making this for him at all.....THANK YOU!

So good.  I added a minced potato which really helped to make this even more hearty. The only change I will make next time is to start the celery earlier, and dice the potato instead of mincing it (slightly bigger chunks I think would  compliment the oysters better).  I used medium oysters and cut them in thirds to make them more spoon friendly.

I had less than a pint of half-and-half and the same amount of heavy cream, so I combined them and added 1% milk to make a quart. I also added canned (hard to get fresh here!) oysters, clams and baby shrimp and the additional liquid didn't seem to affect the thickness. We enjoyed it very much.

For the first year, my kids actually ate the oyster stew and enjoyed it!  It was always the plain milk broth that bothered them, and this provided the solution.  Much thanks!

I did: 1 Cup Cream 3 Cup Milk 4 Tablespoons Butter 2 8oz can of Oyster, only drain 1 can Dash of Parsley 1 Tablespoon flour Directions: Put in 2 TBS butter let melt and add 1 TBS flour and stir till smooth. Add 3 cups milk & 1 cup cream, add salt, parsley, and pepper. Let is come to a boil and add 2 cans oyster, 2 TBS butter, and let it come back to a boil or till it foams up. Then let it sit for 10 min to cool and serve. By far the best I have ever had. Add some hot sauce to every spoon full and my son and I were in Heaven!

I made this just for one serving, and it was delicious!  Instead of shallots, I used garlic and onion, and used skim milk instead of cream (I don't like extremely rich flavors, so just the oyster by itself in the stew was enough for me!)  Finally, I also added some oregano at the end for more flavor.

I made this for myself on Halloween night because if was a family tradition growing up - wouldn't fill you up too much but would keep you warm.  My husband doesn't like oysters, so I had to all to myself.  What a treat!!!  I microphaned the shallots and celery right into the stew.  Brought back memories and was even better than my mother's.  It will be my very own comfort food from now on.  5+ stars

As of today, this oyster stew has replaced our traditional oyster stew.  It was so good!  Thank you for the recipe.  I minced the shallots and celery, didn't add salt, pepper, or cayenne.  It was wonderful!

I have never had any oyster stews or soups so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was quite nice. The broth was very smooth and lightly creamy. We picked the oysters in the morning so they were nice and fresh. I think next time we will either use smaller oysters, or cut them into small pieces. It was odd to have this broth with only some big huge oysters every now and then in it, so smaller, more frequent spoonfulls of them will be nicer. 

Glad I tried it!

I used some ideas from this recipe and used comments from some users on another oyster stew recipe on this site.  I added carrots, celery, potatoes, onions.  I thickened it with a little potato flour.  I added some hot pepper flakes. Delicious!!

I just got some some fresh oysters from the Chesapeake Bay, and I fried some of them last night, but needed this recipe to use the rest of them. Great tasting soup (stew). I don't know what any other oyster would taste like in this recipe, but I got the best oysters I ever had, NO RIVER oysters, straight the bay.Thnaks so posting!

I used this stew as a basis for our traditional Christmas Eve supper, and it was very good. I did make modifications based on our preferences and oyster availability. Here in the upper Midwest they cost a small fortune! So I used one pint of fresh oysters and one can of oysters. I also added 1/4 tsp. of celery salt and 1 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce based on my dad's recipe that I usually use, and used 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I used 1 pint of half and half and 1 pint of 2% milk and cut the butter to 1/4 cup since all half and half is a little rich for some family members who are sensitive to very rich foods. Even though I ended up changing up quite a few of the ingredients, it was a great change up of our traditional favorite. Since everyone thought it was even better than how I've made it in the past, I will make it like this in the future.

Excellent recipe, depending on whether we are wanting a very elegant dish or something hearty and homey I make this two ways.  Following the recipe exactly gives you a beautiful, delicious and elegant soup.  Or, if I want something with more substance as a main the I chop the celery more coursely, add half a chopped onion and a chopped potato.  I garnish with chives.  Either way, a really, really good recipe.

I am an Oyster Stew Connoisseur and can say without doubt that this the way to do Oyster Stew.  When it comes to this type of stew, the simpler the better is key.  I don't usually make mine with celery, but I do love the slight added crunch it offers, so now it's a staple.  ENJOY!

Excellent basic recipe.  The fresher and tastier the oysters, the better the stew

Great recipe.  Changed hubby's bad memory of Oyster Stew - hot milk,butter, and oysters.  He loved it.  I did add 1 cubed potato and sauteed it w/ celery for about 15 minutes, then added the shallots.  Added 2Tbs flour to pan. I could only find 8oz cans, so used 4.  Made dinner rolls to dunk w/.  VERY FILLING!!  And YUMMY!

Excellent stew, creamy and delicious, if you like Clam Chowder, you'll also like this.  I used 50/50 milk and half and half mix.  Good thing, it's plenty rich.

Thanks for this keeper! My father and uncle loved it, as I attempted to revive an old Christmas Eve tradition in our family. It was agreed that this recipe was actually tastier than grandma's used to be. So delicious I went back for two more helpings. Used a soup starter with diced onions and celery already made up, which was nice.

EXCELLENT recipe just the way it is written (I made it with the microplaned potato). The family LOVED it so it is going into the recipe book as "Christmas Eve Oyster Stew". The only thing I did differently was to add ground chipotle pepper rather than the cayenne. This gave the soup the same kick as cayenne but also a subtle smoky flavor. It had a nice texture - oyster stew isn't thick - if you think it is, you are thinking New England chowder. It was buttery, warm, and absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing a super recipe!

Buddy, this is the *exact* recipe I grew up with!  Celery (with leaves,) minced onions/shallots, butter, milk/cream, salt and pepper!  Perfect way to focus on the wonderful oyster flavor!  No need to sautee in a different pan, just do your veggies in the same pot you're going to use for the stew!  I suppose that for those who have never had this before, "stew" denotes a thicker texture...so this is more of an oyster soup.  No matter what you call it, it is delicious, and brings back many childhood memories!  Thanks for posting it!

First try at Oyster Stew. Very simple and very delicious. I used medium oysters and they were just fine. Might try small oysters next.

I halved it (and backed off the butter just a little bit) and made it with freshly shucked Maryland Oysters. It is dead simple to make and the best Oyster stew I have ever had.

This is a delicious stew, however the fat content is so high. I substituted a low fat evaporated milk instead of cream and used 1/4 cup butter instead and it still held its rich and creamy taste. I really like this.

I can't say this is the best oyster stew I've had. Not a lot of favour..for my personal taste, you would have to add quite a bit of spices to suit. Definitely not a stew - more like a soup.  My half and half cream curdled in this receipe so either I did something wrong or else this is something the chef/cook needs to be aware.

This is the perfect Oyster Stew!!! I just love it when the first recipe I find is perfection and I have to search no further and it is even better when I don't have to add my own touches.This has only happened 2 times and this is the second time. I did have to use canned oysters and I had extra shallots I didn't want to go to waist so I added them. other then that I followed it to a T for 8 servings because we wanted leftovers. This taste like my moms oyster stew she made when I was a kid to the best of my memory. We adore this oyster stew and will add it to our family recipes and make it many winter nights and for special suppers. Thanks Buddy  for sharing this and not keeping this masterpiece to yourself. If I could give it 100 stars I would!!!

Being from Maryland, I consider myself to be an expert to some degree on seafood that is served locally in that area, and this is very good.  This makes an excellent addition to meals you can have for lunch or dinner  if you are on the "I Love My Dixon Diet" by Sharon Dixon.

I appreciate the suggestion of minced potato - but just recently had potato soup - instead added 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot - love garlic so added just one finely minced clove - awesome stew - a simple salad - a glass of pinot grigio and freshly baked bread - makes a Friday night dinner in lent heavenly!

This was pretty good but just was not crazy about the celery and onion in the stew, think next time will use celery seed because I like the taste and a little garlic instead of the onion.

Other than paying for the fresh oysters ($7.99 per pound), this recipe is pure pleasure.  I wouldn't change a thing (other than the price of the oysters).  It was fabulous.  A splendid start to New Years Eve, 2004!

This is a very simple, yet very good oysterchowder!  It is a tradition in my family to have several soups for our Christmas meal and I have brought this one for the past several years.  It is very similar to the recipe my dad and mom made for us when we were kids, but the addition of the celery makes a big difference - dicing the celery very fine is key.  I have yet to try fresh oysters in it - SO expensive here in the land-locked Mid-West -  but one day I will.  I am sure that would just bring it over the top.

Delicious! I gave 4 stars because of 3 minor changes. I put the celery and scallions (not shallots) in food processor for a finer chop. The second change was to add 1/4 cup flour to  to the saut√©ed vegetables before adding 2% milk (no cream.) That was the 3rd change. This Oyster Stew was amazing and can't wait to prepare again!

Our other son is a commercial fisherman on the NC coast and he brought us a bushel of oysters when he came home. Needless to say, shucking took some time...but I made this stew out of them. Yes, I made alot of stew. My husband said it tasted like his grandmothers stew. We are very impressed. I had to modify the recipe to accommodate the abundance of oysters by adding more milk. And had to add yellow potatoes due to our Irish side and the necessity for potatoes at every meal,Hahaha!! But in the end the result was still amazing!!! Thank You!!!! :)

Delicious! This was my first time cooking with oysters but I had a sack of them to use so decided to try a few recipes. The hardest part was the shucking but once I put the ingredients together, this recipe worked so well. The subtle flavors all tied together in the creaminess of the liquid and created such a delicately flavored bowl of goodness. Thanks for sharing this one. I'll definitely use it again!

I have been an oyster stew fan my whole life. Growing up, we always had oyster stew for Christmas breakfast. That's a tradition I've continued with my own five. Needless to say, it would take a lot for me to give up the recipe I grew up with. I totally ditched it and THIS has been our family recipe for two years now. My oldest asks for it at least once a month. Thanks, Buddy!

Easy to make and delicious.  I made it for my father-in-law.  The ONLY change I would make is to not MINCE the celery.  A fine chop would be better in my opinion.  Served with oyster crackers and sauteed chard on the side.  We drank Pinot grigio.  I had a leftover bowl for breakfast.  i used fresh Hood Canal little oysters and the flavor was amazing.  And I don't like oysters.

Good base recipe...I ended up having to add more than just salt, pepper, and cayenne to it...I put some lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder which gave it a really good flavor..I'm not a huge oyster fan but this really good...We had fresh picked Hood Canal Oysters...Will be making again!

Not a lot of flavor. i added diced potatoes as well and thought the half and half was a little too rich tasting to me so next time i will use milk like before.

This was a great recipe.  I diced one russet potatoe, which I simmered in water for about 3 minutes before cooking it in the celery, shallot and butter mix.  The other things I added were a few bay leaves, pinch of parsley, and a splash of fresh lemon juice.  It was wonderful!  I loved this recipe - thank you.  When I cook this again, I think I will add maybe 1/4 cup of dry white wine, and some other seafood like scallops and lobster.

Very Elegant, Simple and Easy to prepare. Delicious in the end.  The only moderation I made was to heat the Oysters in their liquid, first.....then SLOWLY add them to  the rest of the mix before you heat it ALL up together.  This dish is a  Christmas Eve tradition in the South for my family.

This recipe is a big hit with my family during the Christmas holidays.  The recipe is simple, but the taste is big.  Use fresh oysters, not canned.  Don't skimp on the half and half.

Used heavy cream instead of half and half and minced onion instead of shallots, with fresh oysters. Turned out fantastic! Will definitely make again.

First time, I followed the recipe. It was very good. 2nd time I made it, I put in some morels and a can of clams I had that was about to expire.  I know, what the heck, right? Well, it was awesome. I will make it again just like that, but I'm out of morels until next season.

We just got back from a trip to Virginia in the Delmarva peninsula and brought back some oysters. Being we‚Äôre in July we opted to look for something to use them in where they were cooked instead of eating them raw. We followed the recipe exactly since we were making it for the first time so that we could evaluate it fairly. It turned out really well and everybody loved it. We will certainly be making it again.

Really good base recipe. If you want to make it thicker, I suggest using some instant mashed potatoes. Cornstarch or flour won't work the same.  Also, if you don't like the celery and onion textures, blend it all i(before you add the oysters) in a food processor or blender.  I also like a dash or two of hot sauce.  Bon appetite!

Just like the oyster stew my grandma made, although she didn't use the cayenne - it's an awesome addition! I am going to try it with the suggested addition of the potato and maybe use an immersion blender to blend the veggies all in smooth before adding the oysters.

Nothing like a bowl of hot oyster stew!!  This recipe uses too much butter for my liking, and it was missing the secret ingredient - BACON!!!  
Cut up 4 slices of thick cut bacon.  Fry to not quite crisp, remove and set aside.  Add a couple tablespoons of butter to the bacon drippings, saute up your veggies, toss the bacon back into the mix and follow the rest of the recipe.  Everything's better with bacon!!

I've been trying to recreate my mother's oyster stew and I've been using a few different recipes to get back to that.  I've made this before with some changes, but it's excellent the way it is.  I'll just have to leave out the cayenne (even a pinch) cuz we have 10 people coming over and not all of them can have more than the onions (I do add garlic while sauteing the oysters).  I've been basing my oysters stew off of this one and another and trying to find what makes everyone happy.  I add more oysters cuz we're piggies  :)  And just a little oyster juice.

Since I was a preteen, I have prepared oyster stew for out of town family that would be arriving  the evening before any winter holiday celebration. I have never had a written recipe, but if I were to write it down, this would be it (after including a potato which the author has suggested in his notes).
 Awesome recipe.

Made it and loved it. Here a couple tips to even make better. Fine cut scallions instead of shallots but either are fine. I cut palm size of green tips of  scallions and palm size of white root ends of scallions.  Melted in half stuck of butter in frying pan to soften and release flavor. 
I did chop 2 butter potatoes and boil while I was melting butter and bring the quart of half-half to temp. 
Don‚Äôt over soften the taters.  I added butter mix to cream and drained off water from taters and put them into fry pan.  Heated water off then and firmed em up. 
The cayenne is point on in the broth.  Nice touch. 
All in all put into bowls to serve and the most important 2 things. Best for last. 
Use Oyster crackers!  And add 1 tabelsooon if I ketchuo directly into each bowl. 
You are going to die after you eat this. Try it. 
Loved this recipe. Just like when I was a kid.

This is a great recipe for Oyster Stew.  Oyster stew is supposed to be somewhat thin, simple in flavor allowing the sweetness of the cream, and the brininess of the oysters to come through. Oh and the butter!! Perhaps some of the reviewers have stew confused with chowder?  I'm going to try simmering the onion and celery in the cream for flavor and perhaps removing them or put it in the blender.

Not complicated at all but nobody needs to know that. More of a brothy soup than a thick chowder. Have some oyster crackers or crusty bread ready to help soak up every last drop. Excellent with a simple Marina Salad.

I have always made oyster stew the same way:  oysters, butter, milk, salt & pepper.  Found this recipe and decided to try it.

It is AWESOME!  I cooked the onions (didn't have scallions) and celery in the butter for about 20 minutes.  Diced up a few small potatoes and cooked them in the microwave and added to the onion/celery/butter mixture.  (These changes are all based on the original author's recommendations by the way).  

I used half n half vs. whole milk (which is what I used in my old recipe).  All my grocer had was select oysters, which are quite big.  Based on another person's review, I cut these in half.  Cooked until curled (normal procedure for oyster stew).  Added salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and some "slap your mama" cajun seasoning.  

This is EXCELLENT---more like an oyster chowder when you add the celery, onions, and potatoes---much more filling for a cold winter night!  THANK YOU for this excellent recipe!

Growing up in a German/Scandinavian home this is exactly what we had every Christmas Eve growing up.  
First, don't expect it to be thick like a stew.  The name stew is a misnomer, I'm not sure where it came from.   
Second, if all it tastes like is butter and milk, then your Oysters are lacking flavor.  Make sure you use fresh Oysters and use all of the Oyster Liquor (the juice that comes in the can).  I use whole milk instead of half and half and maybe that is why the milk taste isn't as strong.  I cut the onions and celery paper thin.  I think this helps impart more flavor to the broth.
Third and final, be careful not to boil the soup(stew).  Seafood like clams and oysters can have a chemical reaction with milk that will cause it to curdle when boiled.  If it does curdle, remove the oysters from the broth and CAREFULLY blend it.  Cover the top with a towel and be cautious with the hot liquid.

Very tasty. To thicken this soup to a stew, add 1/2 cup of flour after your onions have become translucent.  Cook for a couple more minutes, then slowly add the liquid while stirring.

Turned out great. Cut the recipe in half as only needed one serving and that was plenty for me.

I added a couple of potatoes. Didn't have half and half but used evaporated milk with less dilution.  Yum! brought back childhood memories.  Thanks for the recipe. It has been a long time but will now make regularly.

Delicious. We used to make this in the restaurant and it was always simple.  The natural sweetness of the oysters  and cream makes this what it is. I add a small minced clove of garlic to the shallot and celery, and some fresh nutmeg really lifts it up.

This recipe is fantastic!
I used skim milk and smart balance, and used some flour to make a roux with the shallot mixture to thicken. I didn't have any celery so I added some fresh spinach chopped small to add some color and 4 med-lg garlic cloves minced. And I added some tobasco. 
This was so good!

I increased the servings and made a few changes.  I used 2 cups half and half, 1 pint of heavy cream, 1 cup of water, 4, 8oz. Cans of oysters,  and 1 large grated potato.  I used the same amount of shallot(green onion) and 1/2 cup of minced celery. Butter, salt and pepper the same.  I used Texas Pete hot sauce to taste.  I added the oyster liquid to the milk as it was heating.  This stew was AMAZING!  Using my changes, it makes 8 generous servings!

Very good.. used a little potato as you suggested which thickened it up perfectly. The only change was to use white pepper instead of black.

This is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best oyster stew we have ever had!  it is rich and has a great flavor.  Here is what I did a little different:
We have a hard time finding fresh oysters here in rural Kentucky, so I used cooked canned ones by Chicken of the Sea.  I had 32 ounces of oysters I wanted to use, so I added 1 1/3 cup of 2% milk, along with the extra 8 ozs. of oysters.  I also added plenty of salt and pepper and we ate it with lots of crackers in it.  
We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Buddy for sharing this great recipe!

I have loved this recipe for years.  (Thank you Buddy!) It is a simple, elegant and delicious soup.   A few years back my husband said to me... "Hey sweety,  I would really like to have Oyster Stew for Christmas Eve."  I said, we have been married for 7 years and you have never even mentioned this to me. He says..."yes, I just remembered growing up one of my Dad's clients gave him fresh oysters for Christmas and my mom used to make it."  I said ok, we will give it a try.  I went straight to Allrecipes and found Buddy Sizemore's recipe.  I mince the celery and the shallots.  I always use the liquid from the oysters and always use fresh oysters.  I use cream instead of half & half because the half & half can curdle on you if you are not paying attention.  This is not meant to be a thick soup like New England Clam Chowder.  It is all about the pure flavors here, the simplicity and it is amazing.    If you prefer personally a thicker soup,  you can always add a potato or two to it and it will become thicker and more hearty.  My husband loves it just as it is and says it is much better than the Oyster Stew he grew up with.  This is a family favorite for us.  We have this every year on Christmas Eve and sometimes on other nights for a special treat.

It's watery with no flavor. I thickened it up with a roux and added paprika, garlic salt, and some Old Bay Seasoning to get a decent flavor. I'll look for another recipe next time.

I make oyster stew every new years day for my husband. The only change I did was I used milk and half and half. Also used 16 oz of oysters and their liquid. He said it was great.

Not overly impressed. I made the recipe exactly as it is supposed to be except that I halved everything because I didn't have enough oysters (19 oysters gave me about 12 oz).  It's certainly not a stew or a chowder.  It's very liquidy - pretty much the consistency of straight half and half.  If you like straight butter and half and half, then you will probably like this.  Maybe if I used half cream and half broth it would be better. My boyfriend is an oyster fisherman, and so I get free oysters on a weekly basis - If this were not the case, I would be disappointed.

Oyster stew for us is a family New Year's Eve tradition. Instead of our normal oysters in milk recipe I did this one. The only things I modified were that I doubled the number of oysters and I used a double boiler instead of a pot. The double boiler prevented any scorching. The shallots are a nice change from the more over powering onions I normally use. This recipe is a keeper!

Being a Marylander, I tend to prefer the traditional Oyster Stew that I grew up on, with some oyster crackers on top. Yours was tasty, however, to me it's more like a clam chowder with an oyster substitute. Oyster Chowder.

I have been making this for a while and I love it and so does everyone who has eaten it. A friend who grew up on Hooper Island, Eastern shore of Md. say it is the best. Can't get a better complament than that. I do add carrot chopped really fine and I use canned milk since that was what I had. I use it all the time now.

Very good base.  A couple of changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp. baking soda dissolved in 1 tsp. water to prevent separation of butter and cream.  Also added 1/2 C. cream sherry a bay leaf and a pinch or two of thyme.  Going to let it sit for while, but a taste hints at awesome flavor.

This is great, but I try to lower calories and fat when possible.  I used 1/4c (real) c. butter and  1 c. half and half with 2 c. fat free milk.  (this makes a thinner soup, so I thickened it using 1 - 2 tsp flour. (or 1 c. left over mashed potatoes) - this works great) Other additives I use, occasionally include; (1) 1 clove of garlic, minced, and cooked with celery and shallots. If shallots not available, use 1 small finely chopped white onion. (2) 1 tsp chopped chives (3) Sprinkle top with mixture 1/2:1/2 paprika anc chili powder. (4) Serve in a bread bowl  .>>toast the bread you have removed from the bread bowl to make dipping crutons

Too thin needed to add thickening.  Not too much flavor for me plus too much celery.  It needs something else.

Delicious stew, so many good flavors! Oysters were fresh from the Apalachicola Bay in Florida Was a little chunky from the cream... would definitely make this again and again  Served with warm loaf of bread and an ice cold beer! MMMMM mmmmm

Fantastic! And super easy! Tasted like I worked on it for days! I did add a diced up potato. Man I can't tell you how great this was!

I am not a big fan of Oyster Stew but my husband loved it!  I made a few changes.  I browned some bacon, then added the veggies with the butter including potatos. I used tabasco instead of cayenne.   Fresh oysters are a must! Very good!

Very good. I didn't completely follow the exact recipe because i was just making a small pot for myself; it came out fantastic! Also threw in a little bit of Heavy Cream (just because i had it on me) and a splash of Adobo spices.  Plus, I did use canned oysters. Fresh aren't that easy to get here.

Very easy to fix and very tasty.  I used fat free half-n-half, and it didn't miss a beat.  Hmmm, hmmm, another way to make those delish Apalachicola oysters.

So EASY to make, and it's fantastic with fresh oysters instead of canned!
