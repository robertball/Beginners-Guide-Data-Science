Very tasty and filling. However I thought the sauce tasted better before I added the sour cream. Next time I will only add the horseradish and use the sour cream as garnish.

This was an awesome recipe! I followed it as written and even added the horseradish. I really did take just under 30 minutes to make it from start to finish. I wouldn't' change anything! It does make enough to feed 8 people not 4.
