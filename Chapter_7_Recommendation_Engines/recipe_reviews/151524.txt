I wanted a recipe to use up extra rice from another meal. This one was easy and delicious. I ended up adding more chilli powder, and plan to add a little garlic, cumin, and oregano to spice it up more for next time. Other than that great recipe. I will make this again.

I made this when we came home from being out all afternoon.  It is a quick meal to throw together.  I added garlic powder to this and then served over brown rice.  My husband and father-in-law both raved about this, but I thought it was a simple but filling dinner.  Would make again, but do a bit more to jazz it up.

This was ok. It was pretty bland, I think it could use paprika and cumin.

This recipe is so bland. I added a lot of spices and it still wasn't enough. Maybe a can of Rotel tomatoes would help give it some flavor.

This recipe was AMAZING!! We don't eat beef, so my mom and I added chicken instead. However, if you're using authentic chili powder, do not add the entire amount! It gets really spicy and just a bit hard to eat. But other than that factor, we loved this recipe and will definitely try it again!
