These are the lightest, fluffiest and most flavorful pancakes in our arsenal. We've been making them this way for 10 years and love it.  It's getting harder to find instant cream of wheat, so I snap up a box whenever I can get it.  Just to clarify - this is not the quick-cooking, 5 minute cream of what, it's the instant, envelopes. The recipe uses one envelope.
