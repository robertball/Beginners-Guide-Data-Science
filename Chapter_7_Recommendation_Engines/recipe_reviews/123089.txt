This is a good recipe.  Make sure you put a lid on the chicken when you cook it for the two hours and also after you add the veggies.  The bacon adds a nice twist to a great meal.

I made this the first time for a friend's party and both he and my husband went nuts about it. That year we ended up hosting x-mas for both families and I made it again because it was the only recipie I was familiar with that would feed so many people. We're hosting christmas again and I have been forbidden from doing any other recipe but this one! It's delicious, easy, and nearly idiot proof (though I have made the mistake of putting it too high in the oven) flavor is just right for me and my spice loving husband. Try this, you won't regret it.

This was amazing! I made it tonight gor guests. It wasn't a planned gathering until about 5 hours ago. So, I scanned my fridge and this website to see what I could come up with. It was a hit. I served it with roasted broccoli, stewed potatoes and a green salad. I had never had such raves over a recipe before. I will definitely be making this again. Maybe for my birthday which is 2 days before Christmas. I always cook for myself a special meal and invite people over so that way I have what I want. thanks for this great recipe.

My family loved this chicken!  Even my super-picky daughter was raving about it!  I did alter the recipe.  I reduced the cider on the stove before putting it on the chicken.  I also skipped the potatoes, green pepper, and tomatoes.  I put thin slices of onion all over the chicken, and poured on the apple cider reduction, then put the bacon on top.  I basted a lot, and it came out beautifully!  Thank you!

I ended up having to cook this like 7 hours I think because I put it on a higher rack instead of the bottom one.  After I put it on the bottom it finished up rather quickly.  It was very moist and the veggies made it appealing.  The skin under the bacon was not very good though.

OMG Delicious!!!  I am not a cook, and I actually made this one with no problem.  It was so full of flavor and even my 7 year old loved it.  Served it with a side of rice and poured the gravy over everything.  YUM.  It did tie me to the kitchen for a ehile, but it was soooo worth it.

Really nice roast chicken.  Came out tender and juicy, with great flavor.  We used regular white potatos in place of red and left out the tomatos.  Had lots of drippings.

FANTASTIC!! Thank you for a great recipe!  I used an electric roaster and this turned out fabulous.  I could of cooked it a little less but it was still very tender.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used 2 cans of peeled whole tomatoes and just cut them in half. I also used red and yellow peppers instead of green.  I basted it about every 10 minutes during the last hour.  I didn't thicken the pan juices but I've been eating this for a few days now, and the chicken and potatoes are awesome leftovers!

I had this in my recipe box quite a while but never made it until now.  Like a lot of recipes I have saved, it is no longer on the web site but should be. We loved this roast chicken, very moist and tender.  The bacon was a nice touch.  I also added celery, carrots, and green beans and left out the tomatoes.

Was ok - but like the traditional way because the taste is so minimal and the juice can't be used as gravy so it really isn't worth it.

Sorry to say no one liked the strong cider taste in the sauce & veges, but the meat itself was fine. I used this on a boneless turkey breast which was on hand and since it was only 3 lbs, cut down the baking time to 90 min. after turning down oven and kept roast covered for half of cooking time. However, the cider (used 2 c. apple cider vinegar) was way too strong on the vegetables and ended up discarding all veges and sauce, but kept three stars as the boneless turkey itself was tasty and moist. Would only try this again using white wine instead of vinegar.

It was good but the cooking time was too much for the chicken I cooked.  It turned out very dry and fell apart when I tried to remove it from the roasting pan.  However, the bacon gave a nice flavor to the drippings.  I will adjust the cooking time down next time and hope for better results.

It was nicely flavored.  I wasn't so sure about using the drippings for gravy, I felt it might have a distinct apple taste.

This is good! The vinegar gives the chicken and the veggies a nice flavor. I just used onions too and it was delicious. I love that there are not a lot of ingredients. Thanks for sharing this one. =)

This made a very tender, moist roast chicken, but flavor wise it was very dull. Won't use again. Thanks anyway.

Absolutely delicious!! The cider is an excellent touch. I used red peppers instead of green, as we like them a lot better. I will definitely make tihs again. Thanks!
