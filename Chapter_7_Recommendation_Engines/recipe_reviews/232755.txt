I skipped the parmesan and I used a homemade salsa. Not a bad snack--I think we would have liked it better had I skipped the frying step. NOTE: I made these on my tabletop griddle and it worked just as good as the oven would have and it didn't heat the whole house.

I really didn't find it necessary to fry the flour tortillas for a quick snack, although I'm not opposed to frying them. 8 minutes in a 400 degree oven and they turn out with golden brown crispy edges. I used a Mexican blend shredded cheese. A great snack or appetizer.

This is a great recipe for a quick snack or meal. I made 5 pizzas in total for 2 people. First, I made two pizzas (one without frying the tortilla and one with the fried tortilla) just to compare both. I topped them with seasoned tomato sauce, cheese and spinach. I preferred the fried tortilla because it made a crispier crust. The other tasted too much like a regular, warmed-up burrito. I was able to get quite creative with toppings using the tasty leftovers (sauce & chicken) from the Slow Cooker Chipotle Chicken recipe on this site. I just spread some of the leftover chipotle sauce over the fried tortilla, topped it with cheese, shredded chicken, more cheese and baked it for 7 minutes. One of the best little pizzas I've ever made! P.S. I did not use 2 cups of oil to fry my tortillas as 1 cup of oil was enough to completely cover the bottom of my frying pan and fry them evenly.

Very good and easy.I used about a fourth of an inch of oil and did not use the Parmesan cheese on it. Still good but semi greasy. I also only made one of them. Also DO NOT cook for three to four minuets on each side! only about 2 minutes for the first side and 1 for the other. 2nd side cooks way faster than the first!
