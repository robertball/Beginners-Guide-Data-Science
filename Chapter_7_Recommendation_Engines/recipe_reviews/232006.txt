This is more 3.5 than 4.  Make sure you season the chicken with salt and black pepper first!  Also, instead of just sprinkling the red pepper flakes on top of the chicken, I sprinkled them and then flipped the chicken over to get both sides.  I didn't measure the flakes, I just shook them on.  When done, the cooked sauce is watery and it would be nice to thicken it in a saucepan by adding a cornstarch slurry and then serving it over the chicken.

If pork is the new white meat.,as it was in this case,.I used a 2 lb. pork tenderloin..splashed a little liquid smoke on it..rubbed in some cracked black pepper and sea salt. I then seared both sides in a cast iron skillet. Follew everything else..exept..I just used some Ken's honey mustard swirled on top of the loin... with some extra surrounding the meat...probably 3-4 tablespoons. Topped that with some crumbled bacon and 2 tablespoons of sliced jalapenos. Twas "the bomb"!! :)

For the amount of effort, which is very little, this recipe is astonishingly delicious! The honey mustard sauce is good for so many other things as well. I don't know why I haven't been making my own honey mustard all along. I would however recommend red peppering to taste. I didn't use the suggested amount, I just sprinkled it on both sides and it was just right for me.

This is such an easy and flavorful dish.  My husband loved it.  I served it with a salad and mashed carrots and turnips.  The honey mustard sauce alongside the sweet carrots was delish!

I love it hot! Used more than the recommended amount of pepper, plus dropped a little hot sauce in the mix.  Fantastic!

This dish was AMAZING!  I've been so tired of chicken, despite recently trying many different recipes.  So easy to make-- can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow night!

We all agreed that this was the bomb...the baby ate it up!!  I tapered down the red pepper flake to our liking and it turned out super-moist and delicious.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!!

Add salt and pepper to the breasts with the red pepper flakes. Don't measure the red pepper, just sprinkle generously. Use decent sized breasts, cooking time should be nearly dead on. I used two good sized chicken breasts and one was slightly undercooked, the other was perfect.

This was bland and tasted even worse the next day for lunch.  Might as well have boiled the package of chicken breasts and set some honey mustard on the side as a condiment.

I prepared this last night for dinner.  Only change I made was to the amount of red pepper flakes, I only used a pinch. My DH and mother do not like hot spicy food. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking. But it was bland looking and tasting. Next time I will not cover this, that way the sauce will thicken and the chicken might brown.

I love the idea of this recipe.  I love mustard in almost any form, and I love spice.  I made it, and wasn't able to get much of a "sauce." I eyeballed the red pepper flakes and realize I'll have to add more next time. I'll make it again, maybe in a smaller dish, and see if a sauce like other reviewers have mentioned (as well as in the recipe photo) develops. We all really enjoyed the flavours of Dijon, honey, and red pepper flakes together.  Overall, a keeper!

Unfortunately for us, the red pepper flakes covered up all of the honey mustard taste. Disappointing but will try again with less flakes. And we love spicy, but they were just too overpowering for us.

We like ours a little spicier so I always multiply the crushed red pepper, but this is definitely one of my favorite last-minute cooking options. And thanks to the sweetness of the honey the kids adore it.

Holy Moly! Way too much red pepper. It was not just spicey, it was burning hot. Followed the recipe exactly. I did like the honey mustard sauce but it was way overpowered by the red pepper. I will make it again but will eyeball the red pepper next time.

Really good and very simple!  The sauce definitely gets watered down but is still excellent....used far less red pepper flakes but that was just a personal preference.

Made it tonight!! Put extra red pepper flakes on it like recipe called for. However, after I poured the honey and Dijon mix over the chicken, I added  more red pepper flakes and regular pepper! I love a great spicy flavor. It was so delicious! I cooked asparagus mixed with fresh ginger on the side and a sweet potato! Great meal!!  This one is a keeper! Enjoy :)

Wife doesn't like how, and pepper flakes show up for her to see. Added siracha to the honey/mustard mix and although she said it was spicy, it passed the taste test. I just added a little more for my servings.

I was so disappointed by this recipe....  there was zero honey/mustard flavor.  Thank goodness I read someone else's review which said to season with salt & pepper.  Wonder if I should have marinated the chicken breasts in the honey/mustard blend before cooking??  I really wanted to love this recipe, but alas it was the most bland thing I have cooked in years (decades??)

Super easy and good, a great week night dinner, I served with glazed carrots. I sprinkled chicken on both sides with Kosher salt and pepper, before sprinkling with the red pepper flakes. I generously sprinkled the pepper flakes because we do not mind spicy. I covered for the first 25 minutes and the removed foil and cooked for the remaining 20 minutes

Delicious! and easy to prepare. Used boneless, skinless thighs (on sale). It's sweet and then Bam! the red pepper hits you but it's not bad at all. There were no left overs.

Wanted to spice up my chicken from the same old same old.  This was really good! I use chicken legs instead of the breast so cooking took a little longer.  I also seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  Only a little was was careful because Dijon mustard is season also. I cut up an onion celery and green pepper and mixed it in the sauce and gave it a little color with parsley.  It turned out really good! Made fresh spinach as side.

Most of the honey dripped to the bottom of the pan.  For me it wasn't  anything special.

My husband LOVED the sauce,  we’ll definitely try it on other meats; he makes Great Northern White beans all the time- he’s going to try the sauce in them the next time. I baked covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered, then tried broiling for about 6 minutes trying to get it to look like the picture. We will definitely make it again!

Made it with thighs instead of breasts, and I didn’t cover it with foil so that the sauce could cook down. I didn’t measure the red pepper flakes, but rather I just sprinkled as much as I knew we’d enjoy. We loved it!  I will definitely make it again!

Dare I say that as written it’s too spicy? We like spicy and this was hot. Paired well with the mashed potato. LOL

Very easy to make, used a large breast so it had to cook for an hour.  The flavor is okay but not great, probably wont make it again.

My family really liked this. I did read reviews first and salt and peppered both sides of the breasts. Family says we can have this again.

Chicken was delicious, I didn't cover with foil, and the sauce thickened for me.

This chicken was just okay. Both me and my dad thought it could have benefited from being marinaded in the sauce overnight as my chicken was better the next day. Personally, the red pepper flakes did not add anything to the dish. They seemed just stuck on the top. I would definitely make it again but marinade the chicken overnight and nix the red pepper.

I added more red pepper than it said to, so it was pretty spicy but this was amazing! Definitely salt and pepper the chicken and make lots of the sauce! I also made rice and put the extra sauce from the pan over the rice! LOVED IT

I made this for the first time tonight and it was so quick and easy!  It smelled wonderful cooking and I couldn't wait for it to come out of the oven.  I seasoned the chicken before cooking with salt and pepper but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  I basted it a couple of times during cooking and served it with rice and vegetables.  I liked it a lot but my husband thought it was a bit sweet although he liked it and cleaned his plate!  I will definitely make this one again.  Great way to switch it up with chicken!

So simple and so good! A little spicy for us so next time I'll use less red pepper flakes. I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, but that was the only thing I did differently.
