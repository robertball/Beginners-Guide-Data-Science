Loved this indeed! I only made one loaf. It may look dry but it isn't. The meat mixture keeps it moist and tender. I didn't add cheese as mentioned in the description, but may next time. Definitely will make it again. Method is spot on. At 45 minutes the loaf was at 67°C. Another 15 minutes more and it was perfect at 70°C. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy to make, great comfort food with mashed potatoes, applesauce and freshly cooked carrots. I love having the second loaf.

Really, terrific recipe.  The meatloaf was a very tasty centerpiece to mashed, new potatoes w/garlic and green beans sauteed with chopped pancetta and carmelized, roasted pecans.

I made this last night. Epic FAIL!! My boyfriend is a great cook. I wanted to impress him and cook dinner for him. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was a mess!! Good flavor but it wasn't a loaf! He described it as a soufflé ?? It needs more than one egg and I think breadcrumbs instead of oats. Whatever...it was sad!
