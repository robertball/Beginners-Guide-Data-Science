I sliced the chicken in the morning and marinated it in a mixture of 1 tbsp Taco Seasoning I made with no salt and some lime juice.
I did not precook the chicken.
I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper, layered the onions, red and green peppers then the chicken on top. I sprinkled everything with Taco Seasoning I.
I feel 20 to 25 minutes would be a better baking time as the vegetables were overcooked at 30 minutes.
Fast and easy dinner with a little tweaking.

Not a big fan of baked chicken for fajitas but prefer grilled. It was pouring rain though and so baked it was. I gotta say that these turned out really good for being baked. I thought for sure that the onions would stay crunchy, the peppers would get mush, and the chicken would get overcooked but none of that happened. This was a good recipe and one I would definitely make again even if it wasn't raining.

This has become my ‘go-to’ fajita recipe. I have made it several times and there are never any leftovers. Really good!

I had cooked chicken on hand so I sliced and cooked onion and peppers, added the chicken and a tbsp of taco sauce. Simmered for a few minutes. Served in tortillas with sour cream and salsa. Delicious! I will make again.

Good, I also put Tomatoes in the bake. Also the Frontera Brand as a PreMade Fajita Sauce. Other than that it’s pretty simple, Watch out for onions though! ??????????????
