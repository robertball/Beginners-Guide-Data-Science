Sprouts got too soft for our liking.  Would cut water time in half.  We love sprouts but do not think the chestnuts added anything to the dish.  We do like chestnuts, just not in this dish.

All of my favorite ingredients!  I loved it and made it as written for me.  For the rest of the family I added some bacon and this at least got them to try it.

I substituted sweet yellow onions for shallots, to save myself a store run.  This was a hit at my house, and a good way to use some of the chestnuts I've been gathering.  I'll definitely make it again.

I loved this! I had some chestnuts in the freezer, leftover from the holidays . Made the recipe exactly as stated and I would not change a thing! Thanks for a great side dish!
