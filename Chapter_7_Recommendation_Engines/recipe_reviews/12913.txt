Robust flavor and it got better as a left over reheated. A very satisfying "comfort food" on dreary winter days.

Very disappointing. You can't roast meat at 450 deg F without filling the house with smoke. The resultant soup had an unusual, less than inviting taste.

This was my first attempt at oxtail anything & am happy to say that the seniors at the local center I cook for loved this soup, the only thing they wanted was some cabbage, so next time I think I'll add that as well. Great hit, thanks for sharing!!
