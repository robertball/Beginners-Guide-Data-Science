Well, it just doesn't get much easier than this when it comes to desserts - or much tastier! With so few ingredients you really can't go wrong with this one... I made this even easier by using Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells vs. the sheets so you can scoop out the inside that makes it so "doughy". (Just follow the directions on the box) I added some raisins to the apple pie filling and after brushing on the egg wash I sprinkled a little turbinado sugar over top for a little "crunch".  Granted there's nothing like homemade, but this is a great ending to any meal without a lot of effort!

This didn't work out well for me. The directions are not clear in terms of rolling this up and did not go easily.  Second, after baking for 35 minutes this was indeed golden brown and flaky on the inside, but still somewhat doughy on the inside.  Not to my liking or standards at all.  It has potential however - I think it would be much easier and efficient to roll the pastry sheet into a rectangle, spread the fillling along the middle third (the long way) and then fold in the two sides. This would seem to be much more user-friendly than trying to roll up pastry with a can of pie filling in it and would probably bake more evenly as well.

You couldn't get easier than this! This recipe is so simple, quick to prepare and is always a success! I have made it as stated and also into individual triangle using the small squares and using the egg-wash to seal the sides down and then pressing the tongs of a fork along the edges to make a nice finished look. I have also used blueberry pie filling. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar.

I really liked how easy this is. I did add some cinnamon to the pie filling for extra flavor. The ends were a little doughy on the inside, but not too bad. I also thought there was too much filling, so I think 1/2 of a can would be perfect. Overall, I would make this again with some slight changes.

This was very easy and very good.  I may not put in raisins next time, but thought everything else made the recipe delicious.  I sprinkled with coarse sugar before baking and after putting on the egg was.

I made this for Thanksgiving using my own apple pie filling.  I too sprinkled with sugar after brushing with egg.  This has a beautiful finished presentation that surprises everyone that it is "homemade".

I've made this recipe many times and find it virtually foolproof as well as delicious. I generally use Gala or Fuji apples, sliced very thin, golden raisins, and slivered or sliced blanched almonds. Haven't yet tried "craisins" but I bet they would be good. I've tried using pears but they were a little bland and peaches were much too juicy. This strudel makes a great brunch side dish or a dessert treat with ice cream. And one more thing, be sure to watch it closely that last 10 minutes so it doesn't scorch.

I had some homemade apple pie filling that I really wanted to use up and decided this would be the easiest recipe to do so. I did make my own puff pastry as well. But for only a few ingredients the end result is wow! I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed this. I was literally "mmm-ing" while eating it. I did sprinkle some cinnamon over the top before baking. Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe idea!

This was really yummy.  I made my own apple filling with two Gala apples, a little butter, some brown sugar and vanilla.  It made for a caramel tasting apple filling.  Then I decided to mix up about a half cup cream cheese with powdered sugar.  First I layered on the cream cheese mixture and then I put the apple filling on top.  Wow...so good.  The Pepperidge Farm pastry puffs up so nicely, it really looks classy, too.  GREAT recipe.  Thanks!

I made this years ago, but shaped them like turnovers. I didn't even realize it was a recipe? I just came up with it one day with some leftover puff pastry. To do that just cut into equal shaped squares. Just put a small spoonful of filling in the center and then fold the corners together sealing with egg or water. When done drizzle with some vanilla glaze. I would also put these or the studel on a parchment paper lined sheet in case any filling leaks out. These are even better with homemade apple or peach pie filling which I actually prefer.

This was very easy to make! We both liked it. I recommend the premium apple filling so there is not a lot of liquid.

this was nearly impossible to roll up, it was a big sticky mess.  Other than that, it was really tasty.

My daughter's 2nd grade class were having a feast based on where your family originated.  This german type apple strudel was a hit with the kids.  Very very easy.

Yes it is easy but it also leaves alot to be desired. I think the amount of filling called for is too much. Puff pastry is suppose to be light and crisp and this is heavy and soggy. Not sure if decreasing the filling would help or if it simply just doesn't work well for this type of dessert. I also thought the pastry needed something more so I made a vanilla glaze and drizzled on top. Leftovers did not keep well either. :(

With a scoop of ice cream, I think it might be the best dessert ever! 2nd time I tried making my own apple filling. Made the mistake of not allowing it to cool completely. Still tasted greats but difficult to work with the dough, so not as pretty.

So quick and SO EASY!  Turned out beautifully golden brown, with just the right amount of crispiness to the layered pastry.  Didn't have the apples to make homemade filling (and too much sugar in pie filling for us!), so I made some low-sugar black cherry preserves and used that for filling instead.  I've never baked with puff pastry before, but I can't wait to try a savory recipe with the remaining pastry package in the freezer.
