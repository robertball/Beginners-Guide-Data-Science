I read the reviewer's comment about the cookies spreading out too much...I have two comments: first, my original recipe I submitted never said to grease the cookie sheets, so DON'T!! And second, when you use butter instead of shortening in a cookie dough the cookies will spread more if the butter is softened TOO much. If that happens, just refrigerate the cookie dough for an hour and the cookies should bake up higher instead of flatter. If trying the recipe for the first time, don't leave the butter out too long before making the dough. 15 minutes at room temperature should be enough.

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 c. white chocolate chips, 1/2 c. semisweet M&M pieces and 1 c. milk chocolate chips, plus the 1 c. macadamia nuts.
My family and friends loved them.  Crispy on the outer edge, chewy in the middle.

These were ABSOLUTELY amazing!  They baked up beautifully on an ungreased cookie sheet!  The flavor was wonderful, and I even made them without the nuts and a little extra bit of chocolate chips.  This is the greatest recipe for white chocolate chip cookies i've ever made.  I did have to bake them almost 20 minutes, as they did not firm up enough in 10-12 minutes.  Fantastic recipe though!

This was an easy recipe and really good! Everyone said they tasted like Subway cookies. I used salted butter and halved the amount of salt I used. I also substituted walnuts for macadamia nuts because they're so expensive! Cooked for 12 minutes but I rolled somewhat large cookies and I think 10 to 11 may have been a bit better.

I thought these to be greasy as well.  I did not coat my cookie sheets with cooking spray either.  I think more flour needs to be added to absorb the amount of butter; 1/2 to 1 c. more.  But a very nice blend of chips and nuts.

This cookies were easy to make and tasted great. I took these to a family get together and they disappeared in minutes. My family has already asked to make more for the next get together.

Average cookie recipe. I made a couple of adjustments. Added 1/4 cup of flour, and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Only used white chocolate chips. Turned out great! Without my adjustments though, I think it would've turned out two or three stars, that's why I rated it three.

Nice cookie that husband REALLY likes.  I think that next time I make them I will experiment with a flavoring other than vanilla. Almond or rum extract might be good, or perhaps even a bit of brandy. Cookies, they're not just for kids anymore!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I rescaled it into 12 servings. It turned out really good! I reduced the sugar by a tablespoon or two and used only brown sugar and it has no problem at all. Soft and chewy - just the way I want it to be. p.s. If you are using a convection oven, you may want to reduce the temperature a bit - in this case I used 170 C for 10 minutes.

This cookie rocks! It is like getting a great chocolate chip cookie, soft and yummy, and adding macadamia nuts. My oven runs hot, so I cut the temp by 25 degrees, used minimum time (8) and turned the cookies half way. I made them for a church sale, so I made 96 of em. Turned out great!

These were good cookies except there was too much salt and vanilla which gave them a slight after taste.  I decreased the salt to 3/4 tsp and the vanilla to 1 tsp; everyone loved these now!  They are somewhat addictive!

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any problems making this cookies at all. I did melt the butter in the microwave because I always forget to take them out, but refrigerated the dough for about 20 minutes and the cookies turned out perfect. They look just like the photo and tasted like heaven. Thanks for the recipe!!

WOW!!!  I'm not sure how anyone could not like these cookies.  Mine turned out looking and tasting perfect.  These are now a favorite in this house, and I am sure this recipe will be used over and over again.  You could use this recipe for a plain chocolate chip cookie, craisins, walnuts, or other combinations.  The dough is easy to work with and my husband (who usually eats the dough as I am baking) said this was one of his favorites -and he is not a big chocolate fan - THANKS!

This was a very easy and tasty cookie recipe.  I made it without the semi-sweet choc chips and it was still very good.

Delish!  I had to modify the recipe a little bit just because of the ingredients that I had on hand.  I ended up using half salted butter and half shortening.  Also, before adding the chocolate and nuts, I divided the dough in half and made one half white choc. macadamia (with a dash of cinnamon...trust me it works), and the other half into chocolate chip walnut.  I think this is also a good base recipe for a cookie that you could add whatever you wanted to.  They did end up a little on the crispy side (which I LOVE), but to keep my chewy-softer-cookie-lovin' husband happy I'd bake it for a minute or two less.

These cookies were gone in no time!  I substituted coconut extract for the vanilla and they were very tastey!  Next time I will probably use a little less chocolate chips, there was a lot of stuff and not much cookie.  Still very delicious though!

Its a good cookie but it spread out to much. I like a holesome cookie. If I would make it again I wouldn't grease my pans. i've baked many cookie recipies before and this is one of the first that I see that asked for greased sheets.

I have to say this is the best recipe for cookies.  I use it to make any chip based cookie.  My favorite is double semi-sweet chocolate chips with chopped hazelnuts. (I live in the pacific NW).  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great.  I doubled the recipe since I was baking for a crowd, and it worked fine.  I used a 350 degree oven and used parchment paper on the cookie sheet and baked for 12-15 min.  The raw dough is quite sweet, but they bake up just right.

This made excellent cookies which kept for a good few days - it makes so many they lasted a few days.  It is definately best to refrigerate mixture before cooking to avoid them spreading too much.

These are good- I don't like the texture as much as some other cookies I've made, but they're still really good.  I found they turned out better when baked at 350 instead of 375, for about 8 minutes.  We're moving and I need to use up my baking products- this was a great use for the rest of my macadamia nuts and some chocolate chips!

GONE IN 60 SECONDS........  I made these for a small gathering tonight. Wow. I followed the recipe exactly and made sure the cookie pan was not greased or foiled lined. I used a plain cookie sheet. They came out fantastic and were gone in a minute or so..... I chiled the dough for a couple of hours before I baked them.

Thanks Bonnie for an outstanding recipe!

I read the comments about the tablespoons after I made my batches, but I was making the cookies for an entire department at work! Needless to say, dropping these cookies by teaspoonful worked well. Not to mention that they were delicious! What a wonderful recipe and I'm still getting rave reviews about them. Thanks so much for submitting the recipe!!

I used chopped chocolate instead of chips and baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes. Those were the only changes I made and my family loved them! The cookies also stayed soft for longer than my previous standard cookie recipe which was a nice bonus. 

This is my family's current favorite baked good and it isn't easy to please all four of my siblings and their families!

I did not care for these cookies at all...they are very Very buttery! I followed the ingredients to a T with no substitutions or exceptions, chilled the cookie dough for about an hour before baking. They were very greasy and the butter taste was too overwhelming for me...my bf and his roommate liked the cookie dough raw though so it wasn't a total waste.

I'm not an expert baker but I found these cookies extremely easy to make.  I took into account the comments made about adding extra flour, cooking the cookies for longer and lowering the oven temperature.

I did find it beneficial to add extra flour but found that 8-10 mins was adequate for cooking them.  I did reduce the temp to 180 C, 350 F.  This recipe, unusually, calls for teaspoon size cookies.  I would imagine people who didn't take that into account had to cook the cookies much longer.

Overall, these are awesome cookies --- I will use definitely use the recipe again.  

I would recommend cutting up chocolate bars of your choice rather than buying chocolate chip cookies.

Not a bad cookie, but my chocolate chip coconut macadamia nut cookie is better. Hopefully allrecipe will post it soon for others to enjoy.

This recipe was very delicious, I made a lot of substitutions for it though. 

I used: 
1 cup all purpose flour
1 1/4 cup coconut flour
3 eggs
1 cup pumpkin/cinnamon chips
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup roasted and salted macadamia nuts whole
3/4 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup stevia

I kept the remaining ingredients as is, and they came out wonderful. I did have to flatten them lightly with a spoon mid-bake because I refrigerated my dough before I baked and they wouldn't flatten out at all.

this made about 3.5 dozen cookies when dropped by rounded teaspoon.

These are delicious cookies.   Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I increased the flour to 2-1/2 cups.  I also used 2 teaspoons vanilla (because I wanted to finish the bottle); the added flavor blended perfectly.   Instead of the vanilla chips, I used butterscotch.   I only baked them for 10 minutes, but as the recipe suggests, I left them on the cookie pan for about 3-5 minutes.   I also lined the pan with  parchment paper.    They turned out perfectly.

Oh my goodness there were so so good.  Didn't change a thing with the recipe. Adding the milk chocolate definitely added depth to the cookies.

Loved this recipe, it was just the right balance of sweet and savory with the nuts. I always use butter, but I amde sure it wasn't completely melted so they didn't spread out too much, and I always bake with parchment paper, which makes these a nice shape, not to thick or thin.  If you use salted butter, you only need a little bit of salt.  Will deinately do these again!
