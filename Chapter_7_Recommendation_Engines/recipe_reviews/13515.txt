The blue cheese/bread crumb mixture didn't melt into the fennel as I was expecting at all -- it just lay there on top.  The fennel was okay.  I'll look for another recipe for fennel.

I felt the Gorgonzola completely masked the flavor of the fennel and did not go well with the licorice taste of the fennel at all.

although this has potential to be very good... it just didn't work out that well. Maybe putting more cheese on would help, but I just was not a fan.

This was the first time I ever cooked fennel.  We have always eaten it thinly sliced and very cold as an appetizer.  I followed the directions except had to add a bit more broth and cook longer because I used a simmer that was too slow.  We served it with a slice of left over pizza and it was a great combination.  I plan to serve it at Christmas to surprise the children.

I personally loved the combination of the gorgonzola and fennel.  My husband found it to be a winner too.  I prepared it for some friends and well some loved it, others didn't like the combination of the cheese with fennel, but I think it's because they aren't fennel fans to begin with....
