Very good, I used the Vindaloo sauce and served it with chicken flavoured rice.

These are so simple and taste great.  The only place I have found ground chicken is the Fresh & Easy Market.  I use Trader Joe's curry sauce and put this over rice.  It is a great meal to put in a tupperware for lunch at work.

I love the recipe.  I make my own curry sauce, but I am sure it is just as good from the bottle.  Kids loved it too!!!

My family all loved these meatballs!  A few alterations I did this time:   I used ground pork. And instead of curry sauce, I just used about 1/2 Tbsp of curry powder.  I also added shredded carrots, italian squash, minced green pepper, a little pepper and garlic salt (used as part of the salt).   My kids liked dipping it in ketchup, but I thought it had plenty of flavor by itself and was delicious! We put them with rice.
