Very nice sugar cookie.  Took them to work and asked for reviews.  Everyone liked them but said that there was no WOW factor to give it a 5.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made the recipe twice because I gave the first batch away for Valentines Day!  The batter is easy to roll and tastes great.

I've tried several different sugar cookie recipes on here. These are my family's (and my) favorite, by far! It's a small recipe, so I double up.
