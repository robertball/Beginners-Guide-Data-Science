When I went to make this recipe, I discovered I was out of beef boullion, so I substituted an envelope of onion soup mix.  These were wonderful!!  They came out very moist and with lots of flavor.  I'm not normally a big hamburger fan, but with this recipe I'll be making them more often.  Thanks for sharing!

Don't be fooled by the name.  These are far from "Firecracker" but if you know green chile peppers, you know that from reading the recipe.  I didn't have boullion on hand, so I used beef soup mix. These were incredibly juicy.  Loved 'em. If you want spicy burgers try Firecracker Burgers submitted by McCormack or Cajun Burgers submitted by Gail. I think I will add boullion to all my burger recipes from now on! Great idea!

Some of the best burgers we've had - I think its the boullion.  I'm going to use that every time now. We did add some chopped onion, and some worchestshire sauce too.  Everybody raved.

I actually changed this by adding the spices from the McCormick Firecracker Burgers recipe, basically combined the 2 recipes.  The burgers turned out awesome, the chili and everything gave it great flavor.  I did mine on a Foreman Grill as a matter of convenience.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

It doesn't GET any easier than this! And you get moist, juicy, TASTY burgers every time. (Even the hubby says he doesn't need any condiments whenever I make this recipe!) Some helpful hints...I actually use my hands when mixing---the ingredients seem to get more evenly-distributed this way. Also, I cut back on the green chile peppers (I use a little less than the whole can) so that our 5 year-old can enjoy them along with us. (Too spicy for him the first time I tried the recipe). Thank you Gail, for this quick and simple yet flavorful recipe!

I thought these were really good - very moist and flavorful, however we used canned chiles and they werent very spicy - but did help with the moistness.  I'll switch the canned chiles for the same amount of canned jalepenos next time.  These are really good though (wish I had a grill...)

I added about 1/2 a lb of pork sausage to the ground beef and sprinkled some garlic powder, salt and pepper in the mixture.  The chile peppers added a nice flavor and the bouillon cube gaves these a little "beefy" flavor.  My 17 month really liked it.  I served these on wheat hamburger rolls with provolone cheese and sliced tomatoes.  Quick and tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I always like to give high ratings to anything I try if only to support the great folks that submit their terrific recipes to the fantastic AllRecipes,com but this one didn't quite hit the mark. It was my own fault. I printed out the recipe and then didn't have it when I made these burgers. I left out the boullion and just salted and peppered the meat. Also I knew they were supposed to be grilled but I tried broiling them. With that said though I did think the flavor of the green chilies was interesting and I'll try making these again the right way. Even so they were nice and moist. But only four stars for this recipe due to lack of adaptability and flexibility when made by an idiot.

Sorry, I made these exactly as written and was very disappointed. I should have added garlic etc like others suggested. I could barely taste the peppers or the bouillon. Maybe I should have used Monterey Pepper Jack cheese instead of just plain Monterey Jack.I will not be making these again.

This was quite tasty. I used a Hatch chile pepper diced, straight from the freezer instead of canned. These had a nice flavor and weren't spicy at all. I will make these again. Thanks for the great idea.

My boyfriend requests these all the time in the summer! He loves spicy burgers, and this one really seemed to hit it home. Because of this, I up the amount of green chiles -because he likes it hot-, and I accompany them with the chipotle mayo from this site.

This is a fantastic recipe! The flavor that the beef boullion gives along with the green chiles is wonderful - no need for any other kinds of seasonings! I used Colby Cheese since we didn't have Moneterey Jack and it was delicious. My husband likes things spicy and next time, I will use some Pepper Jack on his burger for an extra kick! Thanks for a super recipe!

They were alright.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped they would be.  I tried the suggestion mentioned in other reviews...using pepper jack cheese instead of monterey jack...didn't really add much to the flavor. Don't think I will make these again.

I didn't think these burgers were very spicy or particulary flavorful. Maybe with some pepperjack cheese and jalapeno peppers...?

Yummy!  Mine fell apart on the grill but I think it was because we had just cleaned the grill and I should have greased it down.  We had company coming over and I was able to salvage them and the meal wasn't ruined.  However, I must say, if they are called Firecracker Burgers, don't you think Pepper Jack Cheese is more appropriate?  I will make these again.

So sorry to make bad remarks, but these burgers were not very tasty, what I think would be better to use rather than green chilies would be jalapeno's.

What an easy recipe! Prep time was virtually nothing. Used pepper jack cheese. I couldn't detect any spiciness but my daughter and husband did. I like really spicy food however and next time I think I will add some hot sauce. Incredibly moist. Will make many more times I am sure.

My family loved these. So simple to put together. Very, very yummy. My husband isn't much for extra things in his burgers, but he loved these. Instead of using regular monterey jack cheese, I used pepperjack. Very good. Everyone who tries this recipe and likes a little spice should try using pepperjack cheese.

Very juicy and tasty, these burgers are especially good with bbq sauce. The name is misleading, though. They are not that spicy.

Green chilis are not exactly a spicy food so I have no idea why this is called a "firecracker".  My husband, a Yankee, thought it was good (go figure) but I found it to be really bland.

The burgers were good, but definitely not "firecracker".  They were moist and it added a little extra flavor.  I would definitely try jalapenos in place of the chilis.

this was yummy and definitely juicy, but the zing just wasn't there.  i was expecting something a little more spicy.  my family also thought that they preferred the classic grilled hamburger as opposed to this one.

Very good burger, the green chilies add an interesting, but very good, flavor to it. I did add a splash of worcertershire sauce and used provolone cheese. The provolone goes GREAT with the green chilies in the burger. I will defenetly use this recipe every time I make hamburgers.

Well, "Firecracker" might be an overstatement here, but I will say that the addition of beef-bouillon granules was a good thing.  Will probably use that every time... Thanks for the recipe, Gail.

This recipe was just OK for me.  I didn't really notice any difference in the taste than I would with a normal grilled burger.  They weren't bad, it just didn't "wow" me.

These burgers were okay but not as outstanding as I had hoped after reading the reviews.  I don't know if it was the fact that I used a can of green chillies that I had previously frozen but they didn't have as much zip as I expected.  I will probably try this one again but use chillies that haven't had their kick removed by the freezer.

I haven't yet made it,  but can tell from looking at the recipe and the reviews that it needs more seasoning.   I will add: 1 TB Curry powder, 1 TB Caribbean jerk seasoning and 1 tsp salt  because another recipe with the same name used these, and see how that tastes... then I'll update my review.
