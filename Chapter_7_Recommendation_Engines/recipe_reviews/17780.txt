This is the bread loaf i will make now on and forever, I don't have a bread machine so i added a cup more of flour and added a tbsp of gluten. I substituted honey and molasses for the brown sugar and I omitted the sunflower seeds and the bread flour for spelt flour to get 100% whole grain bread. I also used oil instead of the butter. I also like to add dissolved (in water) vitamin C tablets to my bread it always makes the bread come out better (smoother and soft) for some reason.
 
It makes a small loaf so I will double it from now on. This makes a great gift loaf of bread, great for sandwiches, french toast, toast or with dinner.  Not heavy at all either. Dh and my picky eater little sister loved it, even asked for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I wanted a 100% whole-grain bread so I used all white wheat (white spring --Wheat Montana and King Arthur have this as do other brands, and it's a great way to get a lighter, sweeter flavored whole-wheat product) and it worked wonderfully. I used just 3 TBS of sweetener as suggested by others and as I didn't have sunflower seeds or quinoa, I used rolled oats and doubled up on the millet and flax. Great toasted. Makes a small loaf so next time I'll double. I  also took mine out after dough setting and shaped it and let it rise for 30 min and placed it in a greased bread pan on a lower rack for 40 min. at 350. Delicious! Thanks Debbie!

I love this recipe! I use molasses and honey (just a little of each) instead of the brown sugar. I also add more seeds than stated in the recipe, but it is a fantastic base. I don't own a bread machine, so I bake it at 375F until golden brown and hollow sounding when tapped (1/2 hour to 45 min).

The first time I made the bread, I followed the recipe exactly as is, and the bread was wonderful--albeit a bit too sweet. It was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich bread on earth, though.

Thank you Debbie!

Absolutely tasty!!
It's a shame it was such a small loaf.I will cut the brown sugar in half, just because I try not to use much in any recipe. Wonderful flavour & texture. I didn't have millet, but just doubled the rest of the seeds & grains(we love our nuts & seeds).
I have now made this loaf a few times & instead of the brown sugar I add 2TBS. honey & 2 TBS. molasses. I also now make this into a full loaf.....so it will last a day :)

This truly is a wonderful tasting bread. The texture is dense and compact, perfect for toast and sandwiches. I believe I will cut the brown sugar by about half next time, but otherwise this recipe is a gastronomic delight!

I love this bread!  I have been looking for a good multigrain/seed bread and have found it.  It made a fairly small loaf in my 1-1.5# bread machine but was perfect for me and my daughter.  It is particularly good when toasted (with peanut butter on it...yum!).  The next time I will put the crust setting on light, as medium made it a little too dark for me.  I will also probably increase the amounts of seeds and nuts.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used the dough setting and let rise 30 min. then baked on lower rack for 30 min
in a 375 F. oven.  It is excellent with a great flavor and texture.  So happy to find
a Multigrain bread for the machine.  Thanks!

Made into hoagie buns and baked in a french bread pan. awesome!

Fabulous in the bread machine. What a shame I gave up my first machine for low carb eating. This recipe makes me sure I did the right thing in getting another! My husband commented on how good this bread was every time he ate a slice. Toasting in just made it more yummy! Use whatever seeds or grains you have on hand.

I usually don't take the time to review recipes that have more than 50 reviews because people usually won't see them. This time I made an exception. This bread is review worthy. I hate reviews that modify the recipe so that you can't even identify the original recipe so I decided that I would make it as is, no modifications whatsoever. I'm so glad I did. This bread is amazing and it is now the go to for any bread that I want other than a default white loaf. Don't believe the hype about having to "modify" every recipe and just make it as it is. You'll love it.

A very good, solid loaf. I find it turns out best when made with a light crust setting.

This was a great start to yummy bread. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I altered the recipe. I replaced the water and dry milk with 3/4 c. whole milk. I used 2 T. butter and replaced the sugar with 3 T. honey and 2 T. molasses. Also, I ground all the seeds in a clean coffee grinder for about 8 seconds before I added them to the flours. Since I didn't use a bread machine, I combined the flours, seeds, salt and yeast. Then I heated the liquid ingredients to 115 degrees and stirred it into the dry mix. I let the dough rest for 20 mins. before kneading for 5. Then it took 2 hours for the dough to rise. I shaped it and gave it another hour to rise again. It baked at 350 for 30 mins., and was the most beautiful loaf I've made in a long time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great, easy recipe for a really tasty loaf of bread! I don't have a bread machine, so made with my KitchenAid mixer. Put all of the ingredients, except the flour, in first, mixed that and let it sit a few minutes till nice and foamy, then added the flour and mixed with dough hook for about 7 minutes. Let raise in a greased bowl for 30 minutes, turned out, shaped and baked in loaf pan at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. I tented the loaf with foil after the first 15 minutes as it was already browning nicely. Also, to make up for the small size I just recalculated with the "servings" tool to make 16 servings and it came out perfectly. I use a 4 1/2 x 8 inch loaf pan, which I just learned is a true loaf size to get a nice    height and shape. I will make this bread often!

This bread is wonderful. I double the recipe and put it in a lrg loaf pan, and it makes a great good size loaf for sandwiches.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and 2 Tbl of honey instead of brown sugar.   Great texture!!

Not sure why but I tried this break over the weekend using a breakmaker and it didn't rise. It was very dense and didn't taste good either. Any suggestions? If not, I won't be making this again.

I love making this!  the loaf is gone 1/2 an hour after it's out of the bread machine!  I do not have quinoa or millet.  I add 1 cup of rolled oats, skip the bread flour and use 2 cups wheat flour  and add 1/2 tablespoon more of all the other seeds.  It comes out PERFECT every time!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely yummy, though I think I'll cut the yeast down next time.

I made this by hand, and I always dissolve a Vit C tab in the water before proofing the yeast.  If you make by hand, mix an extra ½ cup of each type flour (I used whole red [regular] wheat flour and hard white) for kneading

It took about 8 minutes of kneading to reach the "baby's bottom" stage, and a full hour to rise in a warm oven
After risen, I kneaded the dough for another 3 minutes before shaping and placing in my loaf pan and letting rise 30 more minutes.  In a 375 degree F oven it took about 45 minutes to bake.

This bread was wonderful! I didn't have sunflower seeds or flax, so used sesame seeds and more of the millet and quinoa to compensate for the difference. I also didn't have milk powder but used milk instead. I read the reviews which stated this was small loaf so I actually doubled the recipe for one loaf.  It was a bit big, but was just the way I am used to for my white bread recipe.

When preparing my dough, I choose the dough option and let mix and rise in the bread machine and then take out, form into a loaf, place in loaf pan, and let rise for another 30 minutes in oven.  Then baked for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

This made the lightest bread - quite amazing for having such "heavy" ingredients. After reading other comments regarding it raising, the key to your dough rising is to make sure the water is warm, place that in the bottom of the bread machine, having fresh yeast, and always using some sort of sugar be it honey or the sugar mentioned as this "activates" the yeast.  Also, make sure to raise it the full amount in the machine and if transferring to the oven, let rise another 30 minutes. Raising twice makes ALL the difference! This was light, fluffy and delicious! My husband raved about it and won't let me off the hook until I make another one!

Thank you for a great recipe!

**Update - I have been adding twice the amount of grains and have been replacing the butter/oil with the same amount of plain applesauce. It turns out wonderfully and much healthier for you!**

This is our favourite bread! It is made at least once a week and gets eaten up right away.

I don't have any millet so I just use extra quinoa. I also  double all the seeds & grains for an even grainier bread! GREAT!

I have been fiddling with this recipe for over a week now, and my recommendations are as follows: As recommended by several reviewers, I like to double the recipe for a full-size loaf in my 2lb. bread machine. I use a light crust setting. Reduce yeast by 1/3 and salt by 1/2. (I'm not a low-sodium person in general, the original recipe was just way too salty for me.) Increase the millet by at least 50% for a nice crunchy texture, or just throw in whatever grains you have on hand (I like to add bulgar wheat in the same proportions as the millet). Happy baking!

Increasing the size to 16 servings was necessary to have some left for toast the next day. Overall an excelent loaf.

I've made probably a dozen batches of this bread, used it for loaves, rolls and pizzas, and it never disappoints. It's also a great starting point for experimenting (for example, oatmeal or nuts or grain mixes instead of the suggested combination, honey or maple syrup instead of brown sugar). This is definitely my favorite bread recipe!

We all enjoyed it - went fast too.  I also substituted for what I didn't have, so I used sunflower seeds, sesame, oats & wheat berrys.  Also overnighted the dough in the fridge and rose it for an hour in the oven at ~80 deg then baked til it got to 195 deg inside the loaf.  Nice rounded shape.

Very wonderful bread, I am vegan and I added coconut oil verses butter, i also added pumkin seeds by mistake, thought I had sunflower seeds in my hand... but no old age I guess... however, what a lovely recipe.  I personally didn't have a bread machine either and mixed it all up until combined, then let it rest for 8 minutes.  Flop it out on to a lightly floured board and knead it for a few turns, sprinkle a little more flour and knead for a full 10 minutes (just think of that last guy that broke your heart and what you'd like to do to him; or lady if you're a fellow here) :)  .  Place in a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in a warm place for an hour and a half.  after rising punch down gently and shape into your loaf, mine was round.  let rise one more time for at very least 30 minutes.  then place the loaf on a stone or pan and heat your oven to 350.  When the oven is heated now set the timer for 40 minutes.  Yup... it's a little rising trick I found out by mistake one day.  Works pretty good.  GREAT BREAD!!

The bread was as described.  The only changes I made were I used 1/4c. whole milk and 1/2c. of water since I didn't have dried milk.  Also I only used 3 tsp. of instant yeast which seem to be plenty.  For those not using a bread machine, I baked my loaf at 350deg for 35min.

Delicious bread.  I substituted poppy seeds and extra sesame and sunflower seeds for the flax seeds.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The bread is lihgter than I expected and just wonderful.

What a delicious multigrain bread. The only thing I changed was the exclusion of sunflower seeds, since I didn't have any on hand. I think next time I may add some honey or molasses and add some dried currants. Will definitely make this again with the addition of a few ingredients.

My first ever review of a recipe online, because this recipe is excellent - exactly as written. I don't know how it is possible to rate a posted recipe, after making numerous changes. Somewhat reminiscent of "Cobbs" quinoa bread.  Soft and good texture inside, nice crust, and the lovely addition of the seeds and grains - for texture, flavour and health. First made the given quantity for 12 servings, and it was a little bit smallish.  Second time, I made it  in same breadmaker that does no more than 3 cups of flour, for 16 servings.  For a while, I thought there was going to be overflow, but worked out fine.  Did not change the ingredients or measurements as provided by adjustment, at all.  At the same time made third loaf in another breadmaker that takes up to 4 cups of flour.  Used adjusted recipe for 20 servings. Same ingredients, no change to the adjusted quantities.  Another success.  Now I am ready to experiment with maybe poppyseeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds.  Might try to increase the proportion of whole wheat to white flour. Might play with olive oil, or coconut oil.  Might play with honey or molasses.  But only one change at a time!!  Definitely a keeper recipe, that will be made often.

This is pretty good, for as healthy a bread as it is. I did make some substitutions to use the things I had on hand (I was out of sunflower seeds and didn't have any millet, so I doubled the amount of all the other seeds called for in the recipe). I also cut the sugar down to 1 tbs.  because my dad is on a cancer diet, and is limiting his sugars. I used all whole wheat flour as well. Other than that, I made it as written. Maybe it was the use of all whole wheat flour, but my dough was REALLY stiff...I added some extra water, but it was still pretty dry. The loaf rose just fine, and the bread had a decent texture, but the next time I make this, I'll use honey instead of sugar and add a bit more water to add moisture. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I hate when people review a recipe and have changed it so much that it's not even the recipe they're reviewing BUT - I never use powdered milk, so I did sub whole milk, and I prefer honey to processed sugar, so I did make those two changes. It was a very good bread. Tasted great toasted as a sandwich, and buttered up and fried as a grilled cheese sandwich. It didn't have as much depth as I would have hoped for, but was still very good.   If you want a crispier crust, take it out of the bread machine after the dough cycle, transfer to a loaf, and let rise a second time, until double. Then bake for 30 minutes or until the internal temperature hits 190. This trick leads to high, beautiful loaves with real crusts (as opposed to some bread machines!)

Important! Few things to note, if doubled, the recipe requires way too much yeast and sugar.  I used a tablespoon of yeast (sill probably too much) and probably 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup.  Turned out great!

mm mmm very tasty! I made a few changes: no sunflower seeds or millet.  Instead I added an additional tablespoon of sesame seed, a tablespoon of poppy seed, a tablespoon of bran and one teaspoon of whole flaxseed to go along with the one tablespoon of ground flaxseed.  Also, I reduced the yeast to one tablespoon and it still rose beautifully.

This is great! Dense and chewy and a great crust. I increased the recipe by 50%, mixed it in the bread maker, but baked it in a loaf pan in the oven. I had a VERY hard time getting it out of the pan, so next time, I will shape it on a cookie sheet or grease the pan like crazy and hope for better results. Happily, it was not for company!

This is amazingly good bread!  I didn't have millet or Quinoa, so I substituted some poppyseed and 7 grain cereal.  It turned out just perfect as a double recipe, using the 2 pound whole wheat, light crust setting on the bread maker.  When you double the recipe, it calls for too much yeast - so check that.  Will definately make again.

I love this recipe and have made it many times now.  Yum!  I've tried many variations (poppy seeds instead of sesame, or adding wheat germ, doubling millet, omitting any grain that I'm out of, flax meal instead of seed, etc.) and it always turns out great.  I omit the milk, and it is still great.  An awesome base recipe.

Mine came out REALLY dense, not sure if it was supposed to be like that or not but I wasn't a huge fan. With that being said, the flavor was still good in the pieces i tried! I guess I've just found out I'm not a dense bread kinda gal

I've been looking for a bread like this for a long time.  First of all - easy!  The texture was great(definitely not fluff bread), it got a nice crust, tasted wonderful, utilized good fiber, seeds and grains.  It's a nice small recipe for one or two meals and did I mention that it's easy enough to throw this recipe in the bread machine in the morning and have bread a few hours later or for the evening.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I will experiment with various seeds, nuts herbs and grains. Thanks Debbie!  This is my new favorite thing.

I'm revising my review and taking it down to four stars ("average") only because we have since found the recipe for Whole Foods' Seeduction Bread, which is so extraordinary (on Allrecipes). But this is a great bread, too. It's filling, nutty, slightly sweet, moist on the inside, crusty on the outside, and a source of perfect protein. Plus, this bread is packed with more whole grain.

Delicious -- I doubled it, so I cut down the amount of yeast to about 1 tablespoon; I'm not certain whether I used to much or too little, because it did seem to fall the slightest bit. That said, it was very tasty. I didn't use the full amount of salt called for, but it probably needed it (unless you don't want/like salt in the loaf). Also, I did as everyone recommended and added more seeds than were asked for. All in all -- delicious recipe.

I used this recipe for my first loaf attempt in my bread machine.  Turned out great, with the minor additions I made:  oat bran instead of millet; wheat germ instead of quinoa; multigrain bread flour (not white) and followed other reviews by replacing the brown sugar with 2tbs of honey + 2tbs of molasses. Excellent loaf for sandwiches or even toasted with jam and cream cheese.

Great Bread.....If you live in Canada you can substitute some or all of the seeds with "Red River Cereal" which consists of a wonderful mixture of Cracked Wheat, cracked rye and flax seeds.  I also substitute the brown sugar with 1/8 cup of molasses....makes the recipe a little less dry.

This was really, really good. I subbed in 3 T of honey for the brown sugar and ran it through the dough cycle and baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes. Lightly sweet, nicely chewy, a little crunch from the seeds-this one will go in the regular rotation.

Lovely taste and texture.  I do not have a bread machine, so I just made it by hand and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes.  I also added some oats along with all the other seeds and grains.  Yummy.  Healthy.  Good.

This recipe is ok as is, especially if you like a really dense, kinda dry bread....but I made changes to make it more light and fluffy.. Its a FAVE in this house...  I double the recipe, only using the dough cycle in my bread machine.  Then I used EVOO instead of butter, added 2 tsp. dough enhancer, use 1/3 cup honey TOTAL in the doubled recipe inplace of brown sugar,  replace one Tbs vital wheat gluten flour for every cup of whole wheat flour used, and also used WHITE whole wheat flour instead of regular/red hard wheat flour.  When dough cycle is finished, I divide in half, shape loaves and place into loaf pans...rise for 30 minutes or so and then bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.  Rub cold butter on top of loaves as soon as you pull the pans out of the oven (keeps top of loaves soft)...let rest in pans for 10 minutes and then remove and let cool on cooling rack.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I even turned my Hubby into a wholegrain lover, and that is saying A LOT!

This is one of the best breads I've made to date. I have been searching for a great multigrain and found it here. It is even more delicious when toasted. I don't have a breadmaker, so I made a few modifications. I mixed the water with 2 tbsp honey (instead of brown sugar), then added 1 tbsp. yeast (based on some of the comments posted) and let sit 10 min. I also used 1 tbsp of whole milk instead of powder. I didn't have millet so doubled up on the quinoa and it gave the bread a nice crunchy texture. Baked 375 for 30 min. So yummy!

Wow! I wish I could rate something over five stars because this loaf surely deserves six! The crust is delightfully crunchy and yet the bread itself is chewy and sweet. Each seed adds a pop of flavor which all meld together with every bite. I would double the measurements next time as the bread was gobbled up within minutes of it emerging from the machine! Again, WOW!

Followed this exactly (except for slightly increased amounts of grains and seeds), and it came out perfectly! Definitely a keeper! I actually reminded me of the bread I used to get in Germany! =)

This is a great, chewy, healthy and delicious bread.  I do not have a bread maker, and after reading several reviews, I tweaked it a bit to leave out the white flour.  I used 1 1/2 cups spelt flour, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, and I also added Chia to the mix (1 tablespoon).  Instead of butter, I used Earth Balance (I'm dairy free), and added a bit more water when the dough mixture wasn't really getting it together in my stand mixer.  Then I used a spatula to combine and then I kneaded for a minute or so.  If you're using spelt flour, you don't want to knead it too much or you'll end up with a crumbly mess.  Placed in a warm place to rise for 1/2 an hour -- which it didn't really rise that much.  I used a package of active dry yeast for whole grain breads.  I also substituted honey and molasses for the sugar. (1/3 cup honey and a drizzle of molasses.)   As I wanted a really hearty bread, I also added about 1/4 cup of rolled oats.  Placed in a greased bread dish and baked on the bottom rack of the oven at 350 for 35 min.  The next time I am doing this bread, I'm going to put an egg wash on it, as the top was a little dry.  But it is great in the toaster with some (fake) butter and honey spread on it.  Nooom!

I followed this recipe as written & when the cycle was done it was evident that the bread had not risen, it was extremely dry and broke apart when I took it out of the basket.

This may be a great recipe with modifications but not as is.

This was a yummy bread.  I made a couple of substitutions based on what was on hand, but in essence I followed the recipe.  Due to a couple of changes I had to make to yeast amounts for high altitude and baking in the oven it didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  Not the fault of the recipe, but my adjustments.  Next time I'll use a little more yeast, and, oh yes, there will be a next time.

This is my go to recipe for wheat bread.  I modify it to 16 servings, set the wheat cycle on my bread machine, then before it starts baking I take it out and put it in a loaf pan.  Let it rise a bit more (or leave in the fridge over night) and bake in the oven.  I just throw whatever extra seeds and grains I have on hand and it turns out great.  I do make one change though-I use honey instead of brown sugar.  I've tried it both ways and just prefer honey more.

I was so delighted when I came across this great receipt for hearty multigrain bread. Baked it today and a whole loaf was gone in 20 mins. Family totally loved it. The basic receipt is great but you can always vary. I used buttermilk instead of the water and replaced the sugar with 2 tbps of maple syrup didn't have honey, and used 3 tbps rolled oats, 2 tbps red quinoa, 1 tbs sesame seeds, 1 tbs of linseed, flaxseed and burger each. Came out great! Thanks for sharing this fantastic receipe it's a definite keeper and crowd pleaser so deserving of its 5 star rating.

Sounded good but i was expecting an actual handmade recipe, not one where you put in a bread machine for it to do the work for you. If you ever get the actual recipe let me know! Sounds yummy!

Great bread machine recipe! I only use whole wheat flour, so I replaced bread flour with wheat and added 1/8 cup vital wheat gluten and a little bit more water. Also used a non-dairy buttery spread and dry goat milk powder due to food allergies. Turned out delicious and dense with nutrients!

I'm going to have to give this bread only four stars because I made the MISTAKE of listening to other reviewers and adding two tablespoons of molasses instead of brown sugar.  The bread is the perfect texture, is full of grains and fiber, and cooked beautifully - but tastes FAR too strongly of molasses.  I definitely should have just followed the recipe as it was and listened to the original cook instead of the improvised additions.  I am sure this would have been 5 stars had I followed the original recipe!

I found this to be a great foundation recipe to modify to your own taste. Mt first try I used all whole wheat flour as I didn't have any bread flour in the house. Found it to be a bit too heavy, so the next time I added the bread flour and a little potato flour, plus a tad more water. It came out perfectly, with tons of flavor, texture, but not quite so heavy. Make it every week now.

This recipe is awesome!  I did a couple things differently.  I increased the water to just shy of 1 cup instead of the 3/4 cup the recipe calls for.  I also added 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds (because I like them) and I toasted the sesame seeds in the toaster oven before adding to the mix.  I also sprinkled some of the toasted sesame seeds on top of the loaf as it began to bake.

Had doubts about this bread as the dough is very stiff. Made it without a bread machine and had to give the first rise 1 1/2 to 2 hrs before shaping and letting rise again. Did not have millet or quinoa so subbed poppyseed and amaranth. Turned out with a lovely texture and nice shape. Excellent multigrain bread that you can change to your liking. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is THE best bread I have ever made.  So easy and so tasty!  Even my picky husband said "mummmm"  I like more nuts and grains  added wal-nuts and next time I will add more grains. Also I used stevia instead of white sugar. I will keep this recipe forever.  Thank you so much!!

This was good, but I made these adjustments;  used 2 C high gluten wheat flour 2 C bread flour. 1/2 C 7 grain blend, 2 Tbsp stone milled whole oats, 2 Tbsps sunflower seeds, 1/2 C brown sugar, 1/2 C molasses. It made a huge loaf so I will split it next time and make it into 2 smaller loaves.

Loved this recipe. Adjusted it (1 1/2 times) to fit closer to the usual recipe my husband uses in the machine. Worked out perfect. Didn't use the full amount of sugar, and used all whole wheat flour, but had everything else exact. My husband says the "verdict is still out" but he'll eat anything and it'll take some used to switching from white bread to whole wheat/grain bread. I know I'LL keep making this recipe! Look forward to trying different flours.

This tasted great, but didn't work well in my bread machine.  Two cups of flour made a very short loaf.  I doubled it, and it rose, then fell as it baked, leaving a huge hole in the finished loaf.  However, this tastes good enough that I will try it again, this time doubling it but reducing the liquid by 1-2 tablespoons.

I didn't like the fresh out of the bread maker taste of it - that's rare for bread... it was pretty good after 2 or 3 days - that's also rare... i liked it enough to finish it off but honestly, i'm not sure i'd make it again.

Tried it 2x. The 1st time it didn't rise, I  thought it was my yeast.  Tried it again with new yeast and still didn't work.  Oh well, maybe someone else will have better luck.

My family LOVES this recipe.  I've even had friends ask me to make them a loaf of bread.  I use a bread machine and let it do the work, BUT I also elect to give the yeast time to proof before I start the dough cycle.  Doing this always guarantees me a full, light, beautiful loaf of bread.   We don't even buy "store" bread anymore.   This is a staple in our home.

Absolutely amazing! Like others, I don't have a bread machine so I baked on 350F for about 40 minutes. I couldn't find millet and I added an extra tablespoon of all the nuts, but otherwise followed the instructions exactly.

I will never buy store bought multigrain bread again!

The texture and density were good but this bread was way too sweet and needed more grains. Next time I will halve the sugar content as it tasted too much like a dessert!

Wow. That's all I have to say. I followed this recipe with the exception that I used ONLY whole-wheat flour. I used the 1.5 pound loaf, whole-wheat setting with a dark crust (I prefer a darker crust - just my preference). It is a slightly small loaf, but for two people it's PERFECT. I'll probably make this twice a week. Next time I'm going to use 1.5 cups flour and 1/2 cup quick oats to make it even heartier!

We LOVE this bread. I make at least a loaf a week - we love it for breakfast - in the toaster with almond butter and it also makes an amazing sandwich! It's definitely our favorite weekly loaf.

The best bread I've found for both the breadmaker and to bake in the oven! Like other reviewers, I double the loaf, add extra seeds, and substitute the brown sugar for honey and molasses. Makes a delicious loaf, just the right texture! In my breadmaker, I use a 1.0 lb setting for a single batch, and a 2.0 for a double. The light crust setting works best.

Great flavor and super easy to make.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  Changed the seeds out to what I had in the house.  Wheat bulgar, organic flax seeds, and mullet seeds.  Worked perfect!

The first time I made this bread it turned out like a hockey puck...but the inside tatsed great.  So I gave it a 2nd try.  I had to adjust the flour, water and yeast levels to get it right and I decided to have my bread machind do the dough and I baked it in the oven myself.  After the modificatsion it turned out GREAT!

Excellent!  I added 2 tsps vital wheat gluten and subbed quinoa for the millet.  I wasn't sure if cooked quinoa or uncooked quinoa is what this recipe called for.  I had cooked so I just used that and it worked just fine.  I only used the bread machine for the dough cycle, then baked.  I baked for 1 hour at 375, but that was a bit dry, so I'd do maybe 45 min next time.  I'm also not a huge fan of sesame seeds so I might do pumpkin or something else the next time I make this.  Still, very hearty and although it didn't rise much, it rose enough to have a dense and chewy loaf.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy recipe to make, and I don't even have a bread machine.  I will make this one again, and maybe play with the ingredients a little.  I doubled the recipe but substituted molasses and honey for the brown sugar.  I only wish I knew how to achieve a crustier crust.

I wish my loaf had risen more, but it has a yummy flavor.  I scaled it up to 18 servings (1.5x), used the sunflower seeds, millet, and bulgur wheat in place of the other seeds since I'm not real fond of them.  I found that I had to add a lot more water to the dough when it was mixing in the machine.  It did make a tasty bread, so I'll probably experiment some more with the recipe.

This is now my favorite roll recipe. Doubled the recipe and I added 1 TBL of gluten to the dough and allowed 2 rises before I shaped into rolls for sandwiches. Then let double for a total of 3 rises. This is an excellent recipe.

I think this has now become my favorite bread.  I used my bread machine's dough cycle and then baked it in the oven for 20 minutes at 325.  Because I did this, I also added an additional 1/2c flour to make it more workable.  I had no problem getting it to rise, but when my husband made it, it didn't rise for him.  I may try cutting back on the sunflower seeds,though, as that flavor is just a little predominant.  Otherwise, this was a wonderful recipe that I would recommend to anyone.

I downloaded this recipe in 2002 and its still the best. The only change I made was to use Granary flour instead of whole wheat flour. This makes it even tastier. Brian in England

Didn't really rise very well, and I really did try, but I have found that to be the case with other recipes for whole wheat flour.  The flavor was pretty good, but overall I don't think I'll make it again.

LOVED IT! Even the kids loved it! Going to try the version that one reviewer tweaked (maple syrup and other ingredient swaps) and see how that goes. Got a new 2 lb bread maker and the shape of the bread is so much nicer. Couldn’t be easier to make this healthy bread!

I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I substituted oat bran in place of them. I also increased the water to 1 cup and flour by 1/4 cup each. 
The flavor is ok, and it has nice texture. It makes a small loaf though, probably 6" in length.  So for the time and effort put in to making a loaf of bread I will forgo this recipe for one similar that will make a larger loaf, or revamp this one to be larger.

This bread is wonderful! I can’t find millet in the stores here so I leave it out. If you let it rise for at least an hour before baking it makes a nice fluffy sandwich bread, if you do a shorter rise it’s denser like a European rye.

This turned out to be a dense bread packed with lots of flavor. I doubled the recipe but made the following substitutions: I used 1 cup whole grain Rye and 1 cup AP flour instead of bread flour, 4 T molasses and 4 T honey instead of brown sugar. I did not have enough time for a second rising (no bread machine), so I baked it after rising an hour for 40 minutes at 375 F. I could have cooked it longer, but the rest of dinner was ready. I had no complaints about the dense texture, and many complements on the flavor.  It was probably dense due to no second rising, but it  was served with stew, and it held up well. Will make it again. Thanks Debbie!

This is good.  It mixed well, rose well, baked well, and smelled delicious while cooking.  But....those bits of hard crunchy quinoa are pretty hard on my teeth.  I think next time I'll cook the quinoa first.  This was much better when I softened the quinoa with some water in the microwave before adding it to the bread.

I have made a LOT of bread for my large family and this is a great bread recipe -- my new favorite!
I did scale up the size for my larger breadmaker using the tool in this site (and a little less yeast and half the sugar, poppy seeds in place of millet -- changes for personal preference and available ingredients).  It was very fluffy and so YUMMY! This is my new favorite!
I used a light crust whole wheat setting.
Thanks!

i followed the recipe nearly exactly except using more rolled oats instead of millet because i didn't have any. Result was a small rock which crumbled apart at the edges. Wonder whether its the fact that used more rolled oats or if I need to make any other adjustments. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! It was a big disappointment because I read all these positive reviews beforehand...

I doubled this recipe and put it into my bread machine on the dough cycle.  I  baked the bread in two bread pans at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.    I did not have pumpkin seeds so I doubled up on the sunflower seeds and used poppy seeds in place of the millet.  It would be wonderful with different combinations of seeds.  Great recipe!!!!!!

This bread is  not your ordinary heavy dark bread.  It is light and tasty.  Love this recipe.  I mix it in my bread maker on the dough/pasta setting and then take it out, raise it in the pan and bake it in my oven.

Overall this is a great bread recipe for bread machines. I had to adjust ingredients to get it work in my area. I have a Zojirushi BB-CEC20( which I love). For the multigrain part I used Red's Ten grain cereal (5 or six tablespoons). As I live in Phoenix I have learned to add xtra water and use 1 full cup of water.  Where this recipe and I really differ is the yeast. I buy large packs of yeast at Costo and with this brand we use only two teaspoons per loaf. The bread comes out perfect every time with these adjustment for me.

Wow! This bread is an instant family favorite! I just bought a bread machine and wanted to try this multigrain bread. I didn't have any wheat flour so I just used bread flour and set my bread machine on Basic.  My loaf was devoured! This bread tastes so good toasted with butter. I am about to make two more loaves.

This the worst bread recipe I have ever made.  I made it a month ago and thought my bread machine was broken, so I threw it away and bought a new one.  No better luck this time.

This is a great tasting bread.  I doubled the recipe to make a larger loaf.  Only change was to not double the 1/4 c brown sugar - personal preference only since I prefer a less sweet bread. I also  cut back on the yeast to 1-1/2 tsp as my other bread machine recipes only called for that.  its a light bread, but with lots of flavor.  Definitely a keeper!  (I was concerned that I hadn't rinsed the quinoa before adding - next time I will for sure)

I've made this bread a dozen times and can never get it to adequately rise. The lower half of the loaf is especially dense. It's a shame because it has a great flavor.

This recipe is great.  For my bread machine, I found that I needed to add more water.  I package up pre-measured baggies of the sesame seeds, quinoa, flax, milk and millet an put in the freezer, so when I want to make a loaf, I just pull out a baggie to make the process faster.  It makes THE BEST toast

Tried this recipe today, bread sunk in the centre and didn't rise as much as it should have. I substituted the brown sugar with honey, should have reduced quantity according to previous reviews as the bread does turn out a tad too sweet. I also added a tablespoon of amaranth instead of the sesame, a handful of oats and used 2 cups wholemeal flour. So that could be the reason for not rising enough but oh well.. better luck to others!

had one heck of a time making it without a bread machine. heres the alterations: mix dry ingredients together in one bowl, warm(NOT HOT) water in another with yeast and sugar till dissolved. add yeast mix to dry slowly and knead(with hands is best) until just combined then turn onto floured surface and finish kneading till the texture is similar to your earlobe(lumps from seeds are okay). place in greased bowl, grease top of dough, and cover to let rise for 30 mins. punch down and roll out with rolling pin till about 1/2" thick and oblong, roll up tightly to release any extra gas bubbles and fold edges under. place in greased loaf pan(grease top again) for another 30 minutes. then bake at 350 for 40 minutes. the rolling out and tucking under ensure an even texture inside and a smooth, rounded crust. take out, let cool on rack, and enjoy

LOVE this recipe!  It's very flexible with the amount and types of grains.  I doubled the recipe, added extra flax seed, substituted chia seed for the millet because that's what I had on hand and added a couple of tablespoons of oat bran as well.  I put it in my bread machine on the dough cycle, then transferred to a loaf pan and baked in the oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  My husband and I prefer the texture of oven baked bread so that's the only reason I did it that way.  Either way, this is fantastic and it made my turkey and avocado sandwiches at lunch today taste oh so good!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have sunflower seeds, flax or millet so I used 7 grain grits and 7 grain oatmeal instead and really enjoyed that aspect of it.  It didn't rise as much as I would have liked so I might add a little more yeast next time.

I have to have made this at least 20 times now (frequently requested by husband!). I found all the grains in the bulk food section of my local PCC. I follow the recipe, but make rolls instead of a loaf. I brush the top with egg white/water before baking to make them shiney. Love this recipe!

I have made this many many times in my breadmaker. I use the breadmaker for a double batch of the dough, then knead, rise and bake 2 loaves. It is impossible to keep in the house as my family eats it so fast.

Amazing! I use honey instead of brown sugar and I double and bake in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Everyone that tries it loves it. Even my kids love it.

This bread is delicious! I couldn't find millet so I doubled the sesame seeds. I didn't have powdered milk, but when the dough was a little too dry and wouldn't stay together, I drizzled in some warm milk for extra liquid.    I thought I had some bread flour, but it turned out to be self-rising. I decided to use it anyway since people complained of small dense loaves. My loaf rose nicely and didn't seem dense at all! I still added the full amount of yeast.   My bread machine is capable of making a 2 pound loaf, so next time I will modify the serving size to 16. Wonderful bread!!

I LOVE this recipe!  Have made it a couple of times and it always turns out perfectly.  I make the dough in the machine, then braid it and bake it on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.  This time, I substituted more millet for the sesame seeds, and omitted the dry milk powder (I was out).  The bread was just as good as always...!

Stuck to this Basic Recipe since finding it(6 or 7 loaves ago). Don't have all the Ingredients so use: Sesame seed, Ground Flax Seed, Sunflower Seed, Oatmeal, Cornmeal, Quinoa. When short on one or more of those, I just double up on what I have up to 6 tblsp total.  Used Canola Oil instead of Margarine(lazy) and added 1tblsp Lemon Juice.  Great loaf of Bread every time!
