Great texture, with a really fun flavor. The way the brown sugar, blueberries, and basil combine is pretty amazing. They all complement each other nicely. For those curious about the basil, I found it doesn’t come through very strongly at all, rather provides a nice brightness to the overall flavor.

This is really delicious. I didn't buy heavy cream for it, but used half & half as I had it in the house. I also used lemon goat cheese as honey goat cheese was not available to me. For the crust I used Kerry Gold butter from Ireland, which is excellent for baking. This is a truly wonderful pie!

I absolutely had to make this after watching Elise's video on Instagram.  I mean blueberries and goat cheese in a pie?! Def had my attention.  I made the recipe exactly as written except for using 3/4 cup of the honey goat cheese.  I did think about adding about a teaspoon of lemon but decided not to.  I'm glad I didn't because it certainly wasn't needed and it may have over powered the amazing flavor of the fresh basil,  which was so clever!  It is what makes this pie so unique while adding to the freshness of the blueberries.  I love,  love this pie!  Thank you Elise! Love your videos sweetie.  Keep'em coming!
