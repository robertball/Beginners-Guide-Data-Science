I used Smirnoff citrus vodka, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and organic orange juice. This was so different from 
what I usually drink, but fabulous all the same. Really refreshing. You almost can't tell you're drinking alcohol.

Didn’t think I was really going to care for this much, what with the grapefruit juice, which I don’t really care for all that much.  What a pleasant surprise I got!  I tried these out the other weekend at a pool party.  They were really good and everyone enjoyed them.  So, of course we played around with the second batch a tad and turned them into what we ended up calling a Rocky Rita!  Anyway you look at it, recipe as given or altered to fit the fun, thanks for sharing, they were great and enjoyed by all!

No flavor.  Very bitter.  A waste of Absolut mandarin!
