I did a variation to this recipe and added a box of chocolate pudding.  It was great.  A moist cake. Froze easily also.

Not what I remember.  This recipe was very dry and that is with the addition of raisins.

This is hard to rate, because it takes more than 1 day to complete...if you have the time and space it is a GRAT way to give to friends, and it is also, a great starter batter to make so many variations fo the cake....TASTE:  it is WONDERFUL,
and if there are young childern, it is fun to add the ingredients when they come home from school, and gives them a feeling of being a "BAKER" with PRIDE!!
I use this around the holidays..

I can't tell you how many times I've made this and it's never come out bad.  In my opinion, it's more like a pound cake.  You can add just about any of your favorite things...raisins, chocolate chips and nuts are only a few suggestions.  The pudding helps but I've left it out when I didn't have any.  It didn't ruin it at all.  And you can always freeze a cup of the "starter" for another time.  I've done this before and the end result still came out fine.  The fact that it makes 2 loaves, you can always share one.

Very dry texture, but okay flavor. I'll stick to my recipe for Amish Cinnamon Friendship Bread.

I agree with some others that it seems a bit dry but the flavor is good. I used pecans and 1/2 can of fruit cocktail in place of the suggested walnuts, banana slices and raisins. The best part is that it gave me a reason to visit my neighbors.
