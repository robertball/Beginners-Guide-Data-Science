A very good recipe as is.  Not as thick as I am used to though. To make it a 5-star recipe, I added finely chopped cucumbers, and I left out the olive oil and used greek yogurt because it is thicker.  If you can't find greek yogurt (or a real yogurt strainer), you can put two coffee filters into a colander. Put the colander over a bowl and strain the yogurt for about an hour or so on the countertop.

To make this a true tzatziki sauce, I did add one very large deseeded cucumber. I also used greek yogurt. VERY good. I seriously ate myself sick on this with a bag of sea salt pita chips. NOTE: If you can stand it, the longer this sauce sits.......the better it gets.

so ... i'd give it a "5" based on the way i made it, but no cucumbers in the recipe?!?! it definitely needs them. i added about 1 cup of finely chopped cucumbers to the recipe and it was perfect and delicious!  went great with the gyros burgers also on this site.  also, we used Dannon's plain fat-free yogurt and had NO problems with it being too "runny" like others complained about.  it was thick, rich and great.  but remember to add those cucumbers!

I can't really rate it in its virgin state because I didn't make it that way.  However, with the changes I made it was a 5.  Changes:  1/4 tsp pepper instead of 1/2 tsp, 1/2 tblsp dry dill instead of 1 tblsp fresh dill, 1 clove of garlic instead of 3 cloves, and I added 1/3 c. shredded & water pressed out cucumbers.  Made this way it will be a permanent fixture in my recipe box.

I really liked this recipe, but to add to the flavor and texture, I doubled the fresh dill and added finely chopped cucumbers.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Good start. I added finely diced seedless cucumbers (it needed it), chopped green onions, and 1 tsp of red wine vinegar. Also, use a good, thick greek yogurt.

It does have a strong garlicky flavor, so if you are not a garlic lover, either half the garlic or lightly saut√© it first to take out the raw garlic "bite". This was excellent on Pita Chips!

This recipe is a great base but requires additional steps and ingredients to make it perfect. I bought 16 oz of yogurt, lined a sieve with paper towel and placed the yogurt in it. After a few hours all of the liquid drained out of the yogurt leaving it nice and thick. I added 1 cup of grated Long English Cucumber. Be sure to squeeze all of the liquid out of the cucmber after grating it. I also added 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh mint.

Perfect Tzatziki sauce, Serena! We loved it. Served it with Sharon's Souvlaki, Tabbouleh and pita bread all of which are from this site.

We made chicken gyros and used this as the sauce.  The kids used leftover sauce for dipping vegetables for snacks for the week and liked it better than ranch.  I will use this next time I make a veggie tray instead of ranch or dill sauce.  This Tzatziki Sauce is better than anything I've had in a restaurant.  It's wonderful!

This recipe is awesome!!!  I made a few changes though, I used greek yogurt, omitted the olive oil and used 2 cloves of garlic finely minced.  It was very garlicky but that's how I like it.  Great recipe, thanks!

I would have given this a five if it wasn't for the bite with all the garlic in it. I am a garlic lover, and it was too much. Next time, I am going to cut the garlic in half. I added Shredded cucumber to it. Yum-o!!!

We liked this a lot, but I'm glad I used two cloves of garlic rather than three!  I also added some coarsely grated cucumber and used pre-strained Greek yogurt.

Good base for making tzatziki. Along with everyone else, I was confused regarding the lack of cucumbers as an ingredient! I did follow the recipe...although I did not think olive oil was necessary. Also, 3 cloves of garlic would be intensely overpowering. I used 1 good sized one and grated it in. I also used dried dill (about a teaspoon - would definitely taste better with real dill!), a couple of finely chopped mint leaves, and a bit of onion grated in.  For the cucumbers, I seeded and peeled 5 normal ones, grated them, then added salt (and a pinch of sugar) to help get the water out. I then took a filter/cheesecloth thing I had and squeezed that pile of cucumbers until they were all but dry. 5 big cucumbers shrank to about a cup!  I definitely think adding cucumbers is necessary in order to call it 'tzatziki'...but hey, to each his own! All in all, good base to then adjust accordingly.

I thought this was a good base... had to play with it though to get it just right for us. I added about half a cucumber (seeds removed and rung out in a paper towel). Used nonfat Greek yogurt. Also added 2 tablespoons of lowfat sour cream. I reduced the garlic to 2 cloves and olive oil to 1 tablespoon. Perfect for our homemade gyros!

I found it odd that a tzatziki recipe wouldn't have cukes and included olive oil.  I let the yogurt drain for several hours to thicken, omitted the oil, and included 1/2 of a seeded, shredded, pressed-of-its-juices cuke.  Let the whole thing set in the fridge for a little over an hour.  WOW! Yumm-o!

Pretty good. I did make a few changes. I drained the yogurt for a few hours to thicken it, and I added a cucumber, shredded and squeezed dry. I will probably make this again.

Yummy!  This tasted just like the sauce from a restaurant.  I made chicken gyros with this sauce and Peppy's Pita Bread - wow!  I only used 1 T olive oil, because that's all I had, but I don't think it made a difference.  I also added 1/2 of a seeded, finely chopped cucumber.  I love this recipe!

Delicious! I brought this to a party and got so many compliments! I used 4 oz. Greek yogurt and 4 oz. sour cream. I agree with some, the garlic is a bit heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love garlic, but I'll probably use maybe 2 cloves next time. Also, instead of fresh dill I used a paste-type dill in a tube (it was organic).  I can't wait to make this again!

It was ok but I wasn't particularly impressed with this sauce but maybe I should have seeded the cucumbers? Also I had never heard of this before so didn't know what to expect.

This was my 1st try making tzatziki, but I've had it plenty of times before.  I knew something was missing so I added finely chopped cuke.  It still seemed like it was missing something though, but couldn't put my finger on it.  And the viscosity was too thin.  Either strain the yogurt before adding it or try using Greek yogurt, and don't forget to add cucumber...or maybe just find a different recipe.

Great recipe, but like others, I added cucumbers, for sure, and skipped the olive oil and added 2T of dill.  It tasted better the next day after all the flavors blended in.  Thanks

This was really good once I played with it a little bit.  I used 12 oz. of plain yogurt (2 small containers) and a lot of extra garlic since we adore garlic and can never have too much.  I also added half of an English hothouse cucumber that I seeded and chopped into pretty small pieces (didn't bother to peel it first).  I kept the rest of the ingredients pretty much the same although I didn't really bother totally measuring the dill -- just eyeballed it for the most part.  We loved it with pita and the meat from the gyroll recipe on this site (I don't bake it in dough the way the recipe calls to do -- we just eat the lamb and onions).  I only had time for it to sit for about 30 minutes or so before we ate, and it was fine.  It was really great the next night for dinner with some warmed pita wedges to dip into it.

near identical comments to the poster before me: too thin/needed straining in a coffee filter to thicken. Is missing the cucumber...added that. Is missing the mint....added that. The dill and the garlic were overpowering and need to be cut back.

Excellent! I used sour cream because I bought the wrong yogurt (rats!). Also, used dried dill because I can not get fresh in Mexico. I added some chopped parsley for freshness. All in all, the flavor was very good.

Excellent tzatziki sauce! I followed the recipe as written and it was superb. I would recommend you prepare this ahead of time so the herbs and spices have time to infuse throughout the sauce. I used Greek yogurt and added seeded, finely diced cucumber. This was great with feta cheese on a gyro sandwich!

liked the recipe a lot.. wish i could give it 4.5 stars.. i ended up doubling the lemon and halving the salt.. didn't have fresh dill so had to use dried.. made sure that the garlic cloves were the big hearty ones.. not the lil skinny baby sized ones.. also added a quarter of a cucumber that i sweated out with salt and pureed.. left out the oil.. thanks for an awesome starter recipe!

So good! I used a fat free greek yogurt and used dried dill instead of fresh. I also used just 1 large clove of garlic which was plenty. As I started to make this recipe, I noticed no cucumber ~~ so I decided to add some very finely diced English cucumber to this sauce which I think made it amazing. Family loved and and used it as a dip for  Greek Island Chicken Shish Kabobs on this site. Thanks!

Very good! Added chopped cucumber (a must!), and cut the garlic back a bit. Think the next time I am going to cut back the lemon juice just a tad also, was a little more tart that I wanted, but still delicious!! Will make again for sure.

This recipe was great. I added chopped cucumber and let it sit for an hour. I put the sauce on another recipe from this site - Indian Style Sheekh Kebab. It was great wrapped in Naan bread that I purchased from my local grocery store. A great dinner!

Excellent tzatziki sauce.  I like the fact that it doesn't call for cucumber.  I know traditional tzatziki has cucumbers in it, but this one tastes almost identical to the sauce on the gyros I get at my favorite Mediterranean restaurant.  It was a little too lemony, but that was probably my fault, because I just squeezed the lemon juice into the bowl without measuring.  I used Greek yogurt, so I didn't have a problem with the sauce being too thin.  I served this with Middle Eastern Turkey Dogs on pita bread with shredded romaine and sliced tomatoes.

This was an excellent, basic tzatziki sauce to use with greek dishes, such a gyros with fresh lamb or falafels with delicious chickpeas.

This is really good and has the perfect combination of flavorings for a tangy tzatziki.  I did make a few changes for personal taste.  I used Greek plain yogurt instead because it lends a thicker sauce.  I also add about 1/2 of an english cucumber peeled, seeded, and finely diced.  I served with the Spinach Feta Turkey burgers from this site, but, it is also a great dip with toasted pita chips.

Really delicious - I use nonfat greek yogurt which makes it thick and delicious without the fat. I also don't know how anyone can eat this with three cloves of garlic in it. I am a garlic lover, but this is raw garlic we're talking about here. I started with one clove and it was definitely enough garlic. Even with one raw clove in a dip like this, don't plan on a romantic first date right after eating this. I also add another tablespoon of EVOO and double the salt.

Yum! I made this recipe exactly as written and we loved it. My 2 year old daughter and I polished off an entire recipe with some pita chips in a matter of minutes (What can I say? She loves garlic!) While I'm sure cucumber is delicious in it, I didn't have one, and therefore, I chose this recipe over others. I loved this recipe's simplicity and healthiness. It was great! Sure you could make a thicker, creamier Tzatziki with sour cream, but I used low-fat yogurt so we can eat a bucket of it without feeling guilty! This will become a new, regular afternoon snack for us. Per some suggestions, I think I may substitute Greek Seasoning for the salt and pepper next time, just for the fun of it. And I will be serving this at the next gathering with pita chips and veggies. I know it'll be a hit! So much more fun and less fat than ol' Ranch Dip.

/bonks self on head/ It didn't occur to me until just now sitting down to review this recipe that I put 1/2 grated cucumber in it automatically assuming that all tzatziki sauces have it. I hate to review this w/ that additional ingredient, but heck, it was a 5-star, delicious tzatziki that I slathered over pita, and dribbled over gyro meat. Next time I'll read the ingredients more closely.

I am giving this 5 stars becuase it is healty AND tastes good.  I have had better using sour cream, but yogurt is a great alternative without sacrificing taste. Great as dip, or mix a couple tablespoons into your tuna for instant tuna salad (w/o the fat of mayo).

Excellent dip!  We grilled pork chops and sliced them placed on top of Naan bread with red onion and tomoato.  Made the dip more tasty by adding one cup chopped english cucumber and a sprinkle of feta.

Like other reviews, we used greek yogurt, added chopped cucumber, and omitted the olive oil. Was perfect.

After reading some other reviews I added shredded cucumber with the water squeezed out. But I still felt that there was something missing. I love tzatziki and I felt like this one was missing the punch that most of the ones I have eaten had. After looking around at some other recipies I realized it was red wine vinegar! The cucumber and vinegar really did it, but just about a tablespoon of the vinegar. Afterwards it was great

Really yummy--the flavors are well balanced. I added some finely chopped cucumber, too. It was a bit too runny for my taste, so next time I will use Greek yogurt instead of plain. Will be making this often!

I ended up using trader joe's light sour cream, instead of the yogurt in here (because that is what I had) and it worked beautifully.  Everyone loved the sauce!  Thanks!

This is a great basic tzatziki.  I always use greek yogurt as it tends to be thicker, and add about half a grated cucumber.  I served this sauce with lamb kebobs recently and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for the recipe Serena.

Easy and yummy.  We used it as a dip for veggies on Superbowl Sunday, then used the leftovers to make Greek chicken wraps for dinner a couple days later.  I always thought Tzatziki sauce was supposed to have cucumbers, so I finely diced 1/2 of one and added it.  It would probably taste great either way.  If you do add one, be sure to scrape out all the seeds and dry it really well, so you don't make your sauce watery.

Very yummy! A little too much garlic for my tastes so will use less next time. If you don't like garlic, you can chop a shallot instead for a milder flavour. I also added grated cucumber which I put in paper towel and squeezed out the extra water before I added it to the yogurt.

While this is a great recipe, it is not tzatziki.  When you omit the cucumber, you changed it in a way that sends the result off into another dimension.  Tzatziki  must have cucumber, yogurt, olive oil, lemon (or white vinegar), garlic and salt and pepper, no exceptions!

I followed the recipe exactly, and we really enjoyed it. The flavors all blended really nicely and the sauce was a great compliment for the Souvlaki we had barbecued. (I used the Souvlaki recipe on this site.) I might try to add some cucumber next time, although we loved it the way it was! This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

3 cloves of garlic was just too much for this garlic lover.  I remade the sauce with 1 lg. clove and also grated about 1/4 cup of cucumber (I squeezed out excess water before adding to sauce.)

The sauce depends on the yogurt actually. I normally use Greek yogurt with it which taste exactly like the ones in Greece.

Very good sauce. Went great with the Gyro Burger recipe from this site. Came out a little runny, so I will try using cheesecloth next time, but it tasted great. I did add cucumber, though. Just didn't seem right not to.

This tased OK, but it seemed rather watery and I also missed the shredded cucumber you usually get in restaurant style tzatziki.  I would try draining the yogourt overnight through cheesecloth to get a bit thicker consistency next time and add some cucumber as well.

The grocery store nearby stopped carrying tzatziki, so after mourning its loss for a few days I decided to make my own.  This recipe was fabulous!  As other users have suggested, I added finely chopped cucumber (it hardly seems like tzatziki without it!) and I also added an extra clove of garlic, but that's just because I'm a garlic fiend. It took less than five minutes to whip up, and should take less than that to eat.  Thanks, Serena!

An authentic tzatziki recipe calls for draining the yogurt through cheese cloth over night in the refridgerator. This creates a thicker, creamier end product.

Very tasty Serena.  I added some red onion and cucumbers to mine...I wanted to make it into a salad. I served this with Souvlaki and rice.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good, but not the authentic Greek tzatziki that I was looking for (with cucumber, and no dill).  I thought it had too much salt, pepper, olive oil, and garlic, so next time I would decrease them all by half, or maybe just double the yogurt.  I didn't have fresh dill on hand, so I used 1/2 tsp. dried, which was perfect.  This would be excellent with chicken pitas, but I prefer Tzatziki Sauce II from this site for my Greek souvlaki.

This was excellent tzatziki sauce. I added a bit of cucumber in it. I also made it in the food proccesor but when I took it out, it was very runny, so I put it in the fridge to harden, but that didn't work. It was still really good, only too runny.

Good recipe! I used Greek yogurt instead of plain and added finely chopped cucumber. Next  time I'm going to add slightly less lemon juice and pepper as it was just a tad too much.

I add a finely chopped/seeded cucumber to this.  A Greek told me it tastes very close to the tzatziki his mother makes, she uses mint instead of dill.  Excellent recipe.

Oh my goodness! I was looking for a quick tzatziki without the mint - forgot to buy it - and found this one.  Quick, simple and divine!  I like the ones with cucumber as well, but this was just perfect with the falafels I made.  I even cheated and added dried dill tips - but it was great.

I've made this quite a few times now because my husband is hooked.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added cucumber, sauted my garlic, and used Greek yogurt. But my tweaks are my personnel preference. (I also cheated and didn't use fresh dill.)  i.e. I loved how garlicky it was.  Tzatziki is something I've always wanted to make.  Thanks for the recipe.  P.S. I also heat my oven to 300 degrees, wrap 5-8 pitas in tinfoil, and heat for 20 minutes.  Mmmmmm

Great dip!  We are always out of cucumbers, as my son eats them as soon as I get them in house.  So, when I went to make a quick dip to go with pita chips, I had no cukes to go into a tzatziki sauce/dip.  I found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised, as were my guests.  I used dried dill and kosher salt.

I needed a quick sauce for my chicken souvlaki and found this. I followed the recipe exactly as printed and it turned out great! My daughter asked to add some cucumber (about 2 tbsp.'s worth that I grated and then squeezed out the excess liquid before adding to the sauce) because it's her favourite vegetable. It gave it a bit of crunch. Will make this again and again! Defintiely a keeper

I liked it, but might try adding less lemon and a few more spices the next time I make it.  a little bitter for my husband's tastes.

Rated it only as 4 stars because it's missing the cucumbers as an ingredient! You've got to have cucumbers in it...if prepared as is, plus the cukes....a for sure 5 stars! Whole family loved it!

I used non-fat Greek yogurt to make it thicker, and also added finely chopped cucumbers as a few other reviewers recommended. The cucumbers are a must, but it actually felt a bit too thick with the Greek yogurt, and could have used some extra olive oil to thin it. As a garlic lover, I have to disagree with those who said it was too garlicky-- I thought that was spot on, but I also had to add more fresh dill and a smidge more pepper to give it an extra lift (I'm used to strong flavors, I guess). Alone it was tasty (albeit super tangy) but felt like it was missing something that I still can't quite put my finger on, so I'm reluctant to give it five stars, but I'll definitely make it again and play around a bit. I will say this though: it PERFECTLY complemented the gyro burgers I made from another recipe here and I'm looking forward to making it with another lamb burger recipe I have in the future!

Didn't taste like what I was looking for, so I added ~ 1/2 cup of shredded (and squeezed dry) cucumber.  Still didn't really do it for me, it's good but not nearly as good as our local Greek restaurant.

YUM if you love garlic.  I tripled the recipe and have been eating cucumber slices with tzatziki instead of chips and dip.  I also marinated chicken with it. And did a salad with cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, a few tablespoons of italian dressing and a few table spoons of tzatiziki.  Used on burgers instead of mayo.  Very versatile sauce!!

Probably the closest to the real Greek way of making it, since this uses dill.  Most recipes say to use mint, and my family (we're Greek) never made it with mint.  It would be a good idea to use strained yogurt, or strain your own using cheesecloth - it's worth the effort, I promise!  This was definitely yummy.

I decreased the amount of garlic and it was still very strong and sharp tasting. I will reduce it more next time. I also added some finely diced cucumbers.  The next day, I added the olive oil ( I left it out originally due to other's comments on the thinness of this) and milk to thin it out and made a tasty salad dressing with it.

Excellent flavor and such an easy dip to make!  I doubled the recipe and made a few modifications as suggested by others - used Greek yogurt instead of regular and I added cucumber, because I can't imagine tzatziki without it.  For the cucumber, I bought a seedless cucumber (and it was huge) so I only cut up about 1/3 of it.  The rest of it I sliced and put out for people to dip with.    My only complaint is that I thought there was way too much pepper (though my boyfriend did not think so).  Next time I'll cut the pepper in half for my own personal tastes.

Great recipe: fast, easy, and quick clean-up! It tasted a bit plain, so I added some Mediterranean seasoning.  Also, I had no dill so used about a 1/3 c grated cucumber.  Delicious! I will definitely be making this again

Holy guacamole.  I can't believe how amazing this is.  I've loved this stuff for a long time and am so excited to have found a good recipe for it, one that produces a sauce that is as good as or better than what you can buy.  That never happens!  Thanks Serena *xoxoxo*

Pretty Good.  I used balkan style yogurt and--as per other reviews--a little less olive oil because I prefer a thicker sauce.  I thought it was a bit salty though so next time I will use just 1/4 tsp of salt.

This is wonderful and really reminded my husband and I of all the wonderful tzatziki we ate in Greece on our honeymoon.  I agree with other reviewers, though, it is just not tzatziki without cucumber!  I added about a cup of crated english cucumber.  Delicious!

Easy and tasty!  I tried using plain yogurt (drained) and Greek yogurt.  Both turned out great - but much easier with Greek yogurt.  Added cucumber.  I used a mandoline to slice the cucumber, sprinkled a little salt, let it drain, then added to the rest.  I'd let it sit at least 20 minutes before serving.

4 stars as written.  I add 1/2 a cucumber, seeded and finely chopped.  I omitted the olive oil and dill, personal preference.  Used with Traditional Gyro Meat recipe from this site and it was wonderful.

Despite the many 4+ star reviews I found this recipe lacking. It lacked the creamy flavor of real Greek yogurt and I found the 8 ounces to be far too little. The other ingredients over powered the simple flavors and where's the cucumber?

It isn't tzatziki if it doesn't have cucumbers (it's the one essential ingredient apart from yogourt), so I can't give this anything higher than a 3.  Apart from that, the seasoning is just fine and the garlic/lemon combo is not overpowering.  I added a diced cucumber to the recipe, and then doubled the garlic/lemon to compensate for the increased volume.  It is a bit runny (half yogourt, half sour cream would probably help thicken it), but it tastes very nice.

It's Tzatziki sauce. And this one came out way to watery for me. It tastes like it should, though.

Thanks so much for this recipe. We all loved this tzatziki! The only thing missing is the cucumber :) I never thought of adding olive oil and lemon before - these ingredients actually made a huge difference to the taste! Thank you! Will make again!

This is a great base recipe.  If you have never made tzatziki, this is a good start.  The garlic may be a bit much for some, but for me and my family- we love it!   My suggestion-  spend a little more and get the authentic style Greek yougart.  Most other kinds of yougart will produce a really watery tzatziki.  If you can't find Greek yougart, you can fake it by straining it.  Take 2 or 3 paper towels and tape it or rubber band it securely to a container.  The perfect container would be a recycled 16oz yougart tub- then you have a lid too.  Scoop the yougart on the paper towel, cover and place in the fridge.  If you can, leave it overnight.  You will be surprised at the water that is rendered.  Then just follow the recipe.

Only 4 stars b/c I did have to change some things. I used 1/2tbs of dry dill. Added a half of a chopped cucumber. And only 1 garlic clove sauted to take the bite out of it. Also did not add the olive oil and let the plain yogurt drain for about an hour and a half in some coffee filters as was suggested in another review. I did add a little too much salt to it, but it still came out refreshing and yum.

This was really good, we used it on lamb kebobs but I'm thinking of other things to dip in it too.  It was awfully runny, though.  I did add some cucumber and didn't squish out the water (my first error), and I think next time I'll either get the greek yogurt (which I've read here that it is thicker) or I'll drain my yogurt for a while first.  Flavor is awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe definitely gave me a great starting point for a Tzatziki Sauce.  However, 3 gloves of garlic was way too strong; I used just one and was pleased with the taste.  Also, it was a bit bitter so I added about 3/4 c. finely chopped cucumber; that really made the recipe standout.  We used it on our chicken and falafel pitas; yum!  Thanks for posting!!

Great EASY recipe: I strained the yogurt using paper towel in a colander for about an hour or two in the fridge. I increased the garlic and dill because I like strong flavours.  This is a good recipe to play around with.

Mmmm! I always make this tzatziki with Souvlaki (AR recipe) and greek pizza (perfect dipping sauce!). The first time I made this, I included all the garlic and it was way too much. Now I just add 1 clove and it's perfect for me. It's not the butter-thick type you see in restaurants, but they use greek yogurt. Draining regular yogurt overnight in the fridge does thicken it up a bit, but it's really not worth the extra effort when it tastes the same either way. Anyway! Excellent recipe, thank you!

Very good! Balkan yougurt is the best since it is thicker, made with fat free and it was very liquidy, remade with balkan and it was perfect. Made in the morning to let flavours meld, added shredded cucumber just before serving. Had with gyro burgers on pita bread.

I made this to along with some souvlaki we had and the end result was pretty good.  I found it a bit tangier than the stuff I get at my local Greek restaurant, but I may have added a bit too much lemon juice (I just eye-balled it).  I used Balkan style yogurt and it was the perfect thickness; I should also mention that I also added cucumber...it's just not tzatziki without cucumber!

Very good. I love Tzatziki sauce, and  this one tries to do a good job at it. I made a couple mods that a few other users did as well.   Used Greek Yogurt instead.  Used 1 clove garlic (...well, 1.5 based on the size of the clove :P)  1 cuke skinned, seeded, grated, and drained)   Has come out amazing. Will work well with the Kebab recipe I"m making this weekend :)

Amazing!  Having lived in a greek neighbourhood for a few years, this tastes very authentic.  The only thing I added was some finely shredded cucumbers.  I was literally eating the small amount of leftovers with a spoon.

I served this at a get-together composed of primarily Arabs and the bowl was scraped clean within minutes! This can easily be adjusted to suit one's personal taste (may be too garlicy for some). I did strain the yogurt for a little while to make the sauce thicker.

Really good, really easy, although I did add a peeled, shredded English cucumber (it wouldn't be Tzatziki without cucumber to us). I used inexpensive Greek yogurt from Trader Joe's, so it had a nice, rich texture. I'll definitely make this again, with the cucumber, because it goes so well with seasoned roast lamb & fresh tomatoes folded in a pita. I'd give it five stars if it included the cucumber!

This was delicious!!!  I used dried dill because that was all I had and it was still great.  I will definitely try fresh next time, but I don't see this getting any better!  I used this with the Grecian Pork Tenderlion on this site and made gyros out of it with this sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was spot on. I just added a cap full of white vinegar for a little more acid. I also drained the yogurts like many had suggested. I served this with the other recipe for Gyro Burgers and it was delish!

I'm not too sure why this is called tzatziki as there are no cucumbers in it...but it's sooo yummy! In fact, I like it better than any traditional tzatziki sauce I've had.

I thought this recipe was truly awesome.  Tastes just like the Tzatziki I get at my favorite greek place. 

The only change I made was to add some fresh chopped greek oregano.  Gave it a nice, fresh flavor.

I made this and wasn't too sure initially.  But it was just amazing in flavour right off the bat.  I let it sit over night in the fridge and it was a huge hit.

This was INCREDIBLE!! The only complaint i had with this recipe was the lack of cucumber beacuase traditional tzatziki sauce contains cucumbers, however if your not a cucumber person this is amazing even without it. I made this to go along with another Greek recipe from this site, and OMG i will be making it again! An additional note, the best part of this recipe for tzatziki, no draining the yougurt, YAY!

I LOVED this recipe.  Normally I use a recipe that calls for cucumbers in it. I didn't have any cucumbers on hand and wanted to make a sauce that I could use right away so I tried this.  I used 6 oz of plain yogurt and 2 tablespoons of sour cream to try and keep the sauce from being runny and it worked!  We did not miss the cucumbers at all - as a matter of fact - we liked the texture of this one much better!  Thanks submitter.

Absolutely delecious, it was way too garlicky at first so I just diluted it with extra yogurt and lemon juice and then it was perfect. It was just like the tzatziki sauce they use at Opa Souvlaki in west edmonton mall. yummy.

too much garlic, i would use half next time (and i love the stuff). also i added a few mint leaves for extra flavor and of course shredded, pressed (to remove excess water) cucumbers, it seemed wrong not to.

I modified a bit...added 1 seeded and shredded cucumber with the water pressed out, another T of lemon juice, and only 1 garlic clove.  I spread it on a burrito wrap with lettuce and tomato and made Jeanie's Falafel from this site, Yum!

I really liked this except I found it a little too garlicky which is weird because I am a garlicoholic.  It was just very spicy and hot with all that garlic.  Maybe something was up with my garlic?  It was a little old so I don't know, maybe garlic gets more pungent and spicy with age?  Either way, I would definitely make it again as it was very cool and refreshing, but next time add the garlic gradually, tasting as I go along.  I added half a peeled, seeded, shredded cucumber which was a must.

Yummy!  I did add chopped up cucumber and chopped up my garlic.  I did not have fresh dill so I used dried and think it came out just as good - will have to try with fresh dill though. Thanks now I can have it whenever I want :)

A pretty good overall recipe...but after living in Athens for half a year and having this sauce at nearly every meal, I think I'm right in saying that it NEEDS DICED CUCUMBERS...about 1/2 cucumber for this serving size

I always use Greek yogurt so I did not even notice it was not specifically stated. I added half of a large cucumber and it was great! Took off a star for no cucumber too! But I do think it is delicious!

It is now a go to recipe for everything from veggies to breads and of course gyros.  Outstanding!  I added diced onion and left half slices if cucumber on side.  Better than the packaged forms for sure.

This is a delicious cucumber-free tzatziki sauce.  If you're like me, you don't always have cucumber in the house and you just don't feel like going to the store, then this is the recipe for you. I always make it as prescribed and it always turns out wonderful.

Very easy to make and delicious! I added a deseeded, peeled, and grated cucumber as others recommended. I also used plain greek yogurt instead of straining regular yogurt. Definitely gets better as it sits so leave it in the fridge overnight if possible. I used these on baked falafel burgers but am already planning to make spicy lamb burgers to use the rest of the sauce.

Leaves out the most important ingredient--cucumber! Like making "ham and cheese" and leaving out the ham!
Strain the yogurt or this will be a runny mess;better still use Greek yogurt

I tripled the recipe and used Greek yogurt.  Then to make a thicker dip I added 8oz regular cream cheese, 8oz Greek yogurt cream cheese, more salt, pepper, olive oil, and lemon.  I used a food processor to cream the mixture.  Lastly I used the pulse setting to mix in finely diced (seeded) cucumber.   Great dip!

I made this to go with lamb burgers. I didn't have any dill, so put a tiny bit of dried rosemary instead.......big mistake. I liked it more than my husband, so next time I'll make sure I have fresh dill. Thanx for tip to drain the liquid in 2 coffee filters, worked great and made it much thicker :-)

You can really taste all the flavors! Great sauce, but could be more thick. I used the 8oz plain yogurt, regular amount of olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and a generous amount of pepper. However, I doubled the dill and added half a diced cucumber. Really liked the extra flavor from the cucumber!

This is great, i make it all the time to accompany bbq chicken, kabobs, or sweet potato fries. As other reviewers have suggested, i finely shred 1/2 a cucumber and add. Of course, try to dry the shredded cucumber as best as possible, otherwise the tzatziki is too watery. Using a balkan-style yogurt also makes it more authentic.

Super easy to make - got better with allowing time to blend the flavours together. I used plain greek yogurt and added deseeded cucumber that I let sit in a colander with some salt for a bit. I did add a hint of sugar because I thought it was a bit sour. I also added lots of garlic powder because I really wanted the kick of garlic in the sauce. Was delish!

Great recipe but missing the cucumber! Once I added about 1/4 cup of finely grated cucumber, it was a 5 star recipe.

So I was going to give this recipe a 3 because it didn't use cucumber... I realized after I made it that I had made very obvious error in not putting any cucmbers in it. Tzatsiki with no cucumber? What were they thinking!?  However, after looking closely at the description I realized this type of dip was used FOR cucumbers. SO really, it's just that the name is a bit of a problem.

Now fast farward to me figuring out that all I needed to do was add a finely chopped cucumber. Delicious! Great tzatsiki when you add the cucumber. Amazing cucmber, bread, or regular old veggie dip when you nix it. Either way, it's a great summer recipe.

Incredibly authentic in flavor and texture. I added a diced cucumber as others suggested. My family likes the crunchier texture. And who doesn't love cucumbers?

Made this as a last minute thought before the guests came in the door. Used min instead of dill and forgot the lemon juice and olive oil. It went down a treat though. We had it with salad mixings and Mediterranean tomato baked chicken Casserole & rice. Everyone went to seconds and used it as a dressing over the salad.

There is left overs as I always over prepare, so I will add lemon juice to the rest before I have it as I like that sharp taste and I made the dish with homemade yoghurt which is quite mild to start with.

My husband was raised on Tzatziki sauce, so he is pretty picky and likes it authentic tasting. I followed this recipe to a TEE and he loved it. my kids loved it too. I served it with broiled marinated Chicken ( my chicken had a slight 'kick' to it, so this sauce was a perfect pairing ) I used pizza dough and baked it on my griddle at 450 degrees instead of the  usual pita bread. This dinner was a hit. I will make this recipe every time!

Perfect sauce for a Greek chicken dinner that I regularly make.  I do add a squirt of honey to sweeten it up a bit.  But everyone who has had it, loves it!

Thanks for posting this unlike most comments I am allergic to cucumbers but love Tzatziki Sauce I might try it with zucchini but for now I love it as you have posted. I did add a bit of feta and minced onions for texture.

Haven't had much experience with Tzatziki so I'm not quite able to compare with ones I've had in restaurants.  I thought it was good, but a bit too garlic-y for my taste.  I added chopped up cucumber which helped "dilute" the garlic taste as well as add a cooling feel!

8/30/12 I halved the garlic..MUCH BETTER!  I added even more cucumber for added thickness and forgot to take out seeds - turns out it doesn't affect texture if you chop fine enough! :)

Good, but not like the sauce I get in restaurants. I think the yogurt I used was too thin, so I tried to take a commenter's advice and strain it in a coffee filter, but none of the water strained out, so my tzatziki was pretty thin. The flavour was really zesty and great though, but I'd try a thicker yogurt next time or strain it in cheese cloth.

I've made this twice recently; the second time I forgot about the olive oil but the sauce was still really good.  I also added some italian seasoning because other recipes had mentioned adding parsley or oregano so I figured it might just add a little more.  I used this on a salad -- since i've tried it i've really grown to like it! I will definitely use this again.

This was really good with just one addition. As many others before me have suggested, I added about 1/2 of a seeded and grated long English cucumber. Definitely let this sit in the fridge for a bit to let the flavours come together.

I thought this was great not too runny at all! I added a bit too much dill because i didnt use fresh i used dill weed and I did about a half a tbsp. Just a bit too much but still great. I had it on a homemade gyro and it added so much flavor AMAZING!!

Excellent!!!   I took this tzatziki to a baby shower, and everyone raved about how delicious it was. After all the guests left, I stayed to help clean up and the hostess' husband tried it and commented that it was the BEST tzatziki sauce he had ever tasted. Like other posters, I added shredded cucumbers..but I used real Persian cucumbers to give it a more authentic flavor.

This came together really easily and was very good. I used Greek yogurt and after making it I tasted it and thought it was good, but missing something. I added onion powder and more fresh lemon juice and that did the trick... Perfect with AR's Sean's Falafels. I like that this doesn't have cucumbers in it because it will keep better that way and you can always add them into it if you want, but I didn't. Super good, easy and inexpensive. Thanks!

I liked this sauce. In the future, I may add less garlic and use a greek yogurt instead. I served it with cucumber slices and toasted pita. It was a good appetizer.

To make this more authentic use a greek yogurt (which is already drained) OR purchase the yogurt, line a strainer with cheese cloth or a paper towel and let the yogurt drain.    Also, peel, slice lengthwise, seed & grate 1 cucumber.  Once the cucumber is peeled, seeded & grated.  Line another strainer with the same method and wait until the cucumber releases the liquids.    Both regular yogurt & cucumber takes about an hour or 2 to strain liquids off - so plan ahead.    The result is delicious & authentic!!!

I pureed one cucumber (skins and all) in the blender and added the puree to this recipe. It made it a little greener than most tzatziki sauce, but it tasted great. I also added more garlic because it needed it. I've used a much more complicated tzatziki recipe in the past which required wringing out cucumber juice through a rag - forget that! This is now my go-to recipe for tzatziki!

This was only ok.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some plain yogurt I had in the fridge and make a dip for baby carrots so I'd eat more of them.  I was not a fan of this on the carrots even the next day, but it tasted pretty good on Snyders sourdough pretzels.

OK tzatziki sauce. Not like the stuff at the Greek restaurant my bf and I frequent, but good. Made gryos burgers (by Chef Kenneth) tonight and needed some tzatziki sauce to go with them. This seemed to be the most popular one on this site (and preparation was a breeze!). I pretty much followed the recipe to a T except for substituting plain yogurt for 6 oz. of Greek yogurt. I don't really know what the difference is. I just thought it would be neat to prepare "Greek" tzatziki sauce with authentic Greek yogurt : ) My only other change was to scale the recipe for 9 servings as I had a 6 oz. container of yogurt (not the 8 oz. called for). I do have one suggestion. Allow your prepared sauce to sit in the fridge for a while (I only had a half hour) in order for the flavors to blend together. I think that would have made a difference for me. Thanks for sharing!

Very Good. Gave it 4 stars because I added shredded cucumber (don't forget to put in a towel and squeeze out extra water).  Without the cucumbers, it was missing something. Once I added the cucumbers, it was 5 stars. I also used Greek Yogurt.

Next time I'll leave out the lemon juice. The yogurt provides plenty of tartness and the juice just made it too thin. I added fresh parsley for additional flavor, and feta to try and thicken it up.

I liked it a lot except I thought it had too much garlic. Next time I'll taste before I add all that fresh garlic in. Otherwise it was great. I usually use the frozen garlic cubes that just melt in whatever you add them to and it's not an over powering garlic flavor. But I ran out. Next time I'll be sure to use them in this for sure.

A delicious sauce! I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce is so yummy! I'm used to having to make recipes like this ahead of time to be flavorful, but this was immediately wonderful! I will definitely be making this again, and I highly recommend it. I served this with the Greek Chicken and Spinach and Rice (Spanakorizo) recipes from this site. Wonderul!

Well, I can say that I have never had a Tzatziki Sauce before, so I don't have anything to compare this one to. Overall I thought that this was a good recipe, but I felt like maybe something was a little off. I did add finely chopped cucumbers as other's had suggested. I will definitely make this again.

Very good with a chicken shawarma dish we make - the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the absence of cucumber that traditionally goes in tzatziki. I wound up adding about 2 tablespoons of finely grated seedless cucumber, and it turned out  wonderfully.

Great recipe, but not sure why it's missing the essential cucumber that makes it a true tzatziki sauce. I made as directed and added one peeled and finely chopped english cucumber. Just adding the cucumber made it a five star recipe!! Amazing on souvlaki!

This was quite good and came very close to our local Greek restaurant.  However, I think it would be even better with the addition of a bit of cucumber.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good.  I did add shredded cucumbers, and extra dill, and it was delicious.  The key to this recipe is using Greek yogurt... it's creamier and richer than regular plain yogurt.

I gave this 4 stars... I did add shredded cucumber, and cut back on the garlic... then the flavor was right on!  Next time, I'll drain the yogurt... this wasn't 'too' runny... I just prefer it thicker.

I added a diced, drained cucumber... couldn't imagine Tzatziki sauce without it, and it was great!  Served with the Souvlaki recipe(made with chicken) and pita bread.  Made an excellent greek meal!

This recipe is SO yummy & easy! I did make a few changes though. I added 1/2 a cucumber peeled,seeded,chopped then pressed water out. I drained the yogurt overnite, and I cut back the garlic to, 2 medium cloves pressed. I use this sauce on just about all sandwiches and also use it as a dip for fresh veggies. YUM! thank you!

Great and so simple to make.  Literally took me 3 minutes to throw everything together.  I bought the cucumber but completely forgot about shredding it and adding it in and it still tasted great.  Next time, I will try it with the shredded cucumber.

I used Greek yogurt (which you can find at Ralph's if you live in CA) and substituted the pressed garlic with 2 tsps. of garlic powder because I was planning to eat this with a dish that was garlicky enough.  I also doubled the amount of dill.  Delicious!

Fantastic tzatziki! Been looking for a good recipe, and I did add minced cucumber, drained of water, and drained the yogurt as suggested. Just as good as any Greek restaurant I've been to.

I like the fact that this recipe doesn't use cucumber because I don't like it.  I leave out the lemon juice and add extra garlic (which makes my breath awful afterwards, but I love my garlic!).  I make this sauce often and use it as a dip for vegetables or crackers, or instead of mayonnaise in tuna salad. Last night I stirred it in with some beans and had it cold for dinner.  So good!

This was great, with a few modifications as suggested by other reviewers:  drained the yogurt overnight and added half an English cukecumber, finely diced.  Didn' have any fresh dill, so just used dried.

This was a fairly good recipe although I thought there was way too much garlic.  I would probably halve it next time.  OTher than that, if you dont mind the garlic, the taste was awesome.  It went really well with the gyro burgers that we tried, also from this site.

Thank you for this recipe!  I have been looking for a recipe of this sauce forever.  Greek dinners are always a hit and the tzatziki makes everything come together. Opa!

A pretty good dip, everyone really seemed to enjoy it. A little too much grlic for me. I made sure I finely grated and drained my cucumber so the dip would not turn too runny. Also I added in a tsp of finely minced fresh mint, which really enhanced the 'cooling' effect of the dip.

Fairly good and couldn't be more simple. I used with the Spicy Lamb burgers from this site. Somewhat thin, but not really a problem.

This sauce was excellent, after I made a few changes.  I found it a little bitter, but that could be because I hate yogurt, so I used 4 oz. of yogurt and 4 oz. of sour cream, both of which I drained for a few hours before I mixed in the other ingredients.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added 1 med. peeled cucumber, which I shredded after I removed the seeds and squeezed the liquid out of the shredded cucumber.  I will definitely make this again.

A nice cooling flavor for a summer dip.  Well-received by guests.  A tad bit too much cucumber but that can be adjusted.

This is wonderful sauce.  I am a gyroaholic so this helps with my cravings!  I didn't have any fresh dill so I used 1 tsp. of crushed dill seed and also added cucumber.  It is great!

I'm sure glad to have found this recipe because I'm all out of cucumber, and all the other recipies I've seen call for it. This was pretty tasty. A very good alternitive for the usual kind that calls for cucumber. I served it with Focaccia bread, and it was very nice.

Great tzatziki sauce. It didn't turn out watery for me as other reviewers said. I added 1/2 minced cucumber (strained through a cheesecloth) as many suggested and it was perfect. I used the sauce on the gyro burgers recipe from this site.

This was a good dip but didn't taste like the tzatziki I've had in grecian restaurants and in greece. It was runny and alittle tasteless in comparison.
