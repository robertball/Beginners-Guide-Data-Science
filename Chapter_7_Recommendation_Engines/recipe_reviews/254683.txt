So I worked at Orange Julius when I was a teenager and I have to say this drink tastes pretty dang close to the original. I’m crazy about this recipe—don’t change a thing.

I'm always looking for smoothies/shakes for my young daughter, and this one whipped up nicely. I like adding a pastured egg to our shakes--it makes them frothy and adds nutrition, so this recipe appealed to me. I made several changes. I used a frozen banana, orange juice in place of the milk and OJ concentrate, ice cream instead of regular cream and only a tablespoon of sugar. It was fantastic, and DD said, "mmm mmm." This only made 2 small servings for me.

Excellent recipe with some adjustments for our preferences.  Seemed unnecessarily sweet to us.  

-Doubled the ice (Icier consistency & reduces sweetness),
 -Reduced sugar content to 1/4 cup of Splenda (to cut calories), -Omitted egg (food safety reasons),
-Frozen instead of fresh banana (creamier, icier consistency)

This was a good start, but way too sweet. For the 2nd try, I used 4 oranges that were kinda bitter and we didn't want to eat them, 1 c whole milk, 2T sugar, 1 good banana, big splash of pasteurized egg whites. Served over crushed ice.
