I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. The second time, I didn't flour the shrimp and I thought it was even better. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

This recipe is delicious!!  For those that said the flour made it gooey - next time don't use so much flour.  Just barely coat the shrimp and shake off excess. Nummy!!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great! However, next time, we will not add the floured shrimp back into the sauce but rather pour the sauce mixture overthe floured shrimp just before serving to prevent the shrimp becoming gluggy

This recipe was excellent.  I read previous reviews and decreased the flour--I simply shake the flour lightly over the shrimp before cooking.  Also, I only use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and find that there is more than enough lemon flavor--5 tablespoons would be overwhelming.

Excellent mixture; however, I added my own twist which took this dish over the top.  As most on here I reduced the amount of lemon in the dish and I added chicken cubes as well as a little heavy whipping cream at the end which gave this scampi a delicious creamy garlic taste.  Highly recommended..........

Me and my husband loved this. It had so much flavor. It was a tiny bit greasy, but shrimp scampi usually is. Definitely worth giving a try!!!

The first time I've ever attempted Shrimp Scampi and it was excellent!  I agree with rater #1, frying the shrimp coated with flour made the entire dish kind of gooey/lumpy but it tasted great anyway, next time I will forego the flour and fry the shrimp plain..

The shrimp would have been better if you didn't fry the shrimp first.  The flour made the shrimp very gooey when you put it in the wine mixture. We will try this recipe again, but use ready to eat shrimp instead.

This did not turn out well for me, at all.  Be sure to use dry white wine - I used what I had on hand, and obviously that was a bad choice.  Also, the lemon was over powering even though I cut it down to 2 Tbs. from 5 Tbs.  Probably should use 2 tsp.  I might have the courage to try it again sometime with the right wine and much less lemon juice, but it will be a while!

The shrimp came out great, but I made serious modifications...didn't have any lemon juice so I used some limoncello out of the freezer (2+ tablespoons), didn't fry the shrimp (sauteed in EVOO and then added them to the sauce at the end), halved the butter, used dried parsley.  Served with brown rice and broccoli...I'd definitely make it again!

I thought this recipe was very good. I fried the shrimp first and put them in a dish. Then, I made the sauce with the remaining juices from frying, but found it to be very thin so I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I also added some basil and oregano. I poured it over the shrimp and topped it with shredded Romano and Parmesan cheese and baked it in the oven for about 10 minutes. The only thing we did not really like was the lemon. Next time I will use less lemon.

Really good.  We grilled the shrimp, made the sauce and baked the shrimp for about 10 minutes in the sauce.  I did have to thicken the sauce a little with cornstarch, I think I was just impatient with reducing the liquid.  Thanks for a new staple recipe!

This was different but it was good. I followed the recipe as it directs and it turned out pretty good. I will make this again but I have other shrimp dishes that I enjoy making more frequently.

Wonderful sauce.  Used frozen shrimp so modify for that.  Was going to have zucchini as a veggie - decided to simmer in the sauce before adding shrimp and was delicious!

This recipe as written was very bland, it was just missing something I couldn't pinpoint. I had to add more worcestershire sauce, some red pepper flakes, & parmesan cheese to add some flavor to it. Sorry, we just didn't like this one that well.

I followed this recipe exactly, but after reading the reviews, I was careful to only very lightly flour the shrimp. I liked how this made the shrimp a little crispy, I didn't find it gooey at all.  I thought the flavor was perfect, but in an attempt to trim down the fat, I think I will halve the butter next time.

Delicious!  Other than halving the recipe for me and my husband, I followed the recipe as is.  Regarding other comments about flour, I decided to go ahead and use it anyway.  I dredged the shrimp by putting just a little bit of flour in a Ziploc bag. The flour did not turn the recipe goopy at all.  I will make this again for sure.  Very, very tasty.  Even my picky husband loved it!

This is my go-to scampi recipe. I always make it for company and it always gets huge applause. That being said, I tallied up all the ingredients' calories and this dish is 1314 cal per serving not 1100, which is big for me cuz I'm on a diet...eating shrimp scampi, I know. But I dropped the flour down to 1/2 a cup and only used about 2-3 T of oil for the shrimp. I used palain water instead of white wine and it came out BEAUTIFULLY and was 565 calories less a serving!

Very good.  I didn't use any W. sauce.  Didn't really think that the sauce would taste good with that.  Thanks for the post.

Easy and good. I have made this several times and everyone always loves it.  I normally add a little more garlic and fresh parsley.  Overall, a good recipe to keep for a quick and easy dinner night

I'm giving this a 4.5.  It's yummy!  My husband just made this dish with a few changes.  We didn't have any wine, so he used about 3/4 cup of Dry Sherry.  He sauteed some chopped onion and garlic in about 1/2 the butter this recipe called for. Then added the sherry, broth, and red pepper flakes.  He skipped the flour as was suggested by others.  He used the juice of an entire lemon and it wasn't too lemony.  The sauce was allowed to reduce a little and then he added about 1/2 cup pasta water to reconstitute it a bit. He added the shrimp at the very end and allowed it to cook in the sauce.  Next time we'd add some mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and/or shallot.

this recipe was excellent, somewhat like i had at a nearby restaurant, Tiffanys in Clinton, nj.  I butterflied the shrimps, dusted them with flour and refrigerated them for about one hour, then fried them quickly. I served them over ramen noodles adding just a dash of the chicken flav in the packet. I also sprinkled fresh parm cheese on top.Next ime I might even add some good sundried tomatoes diced up for color and flavor. My picky husband even loved this recipe I will make it for guests. june

This sauce was very thin and did not thicken up well for me. I found it WAY too buttery, and I only used 7 TBSP of butter.  You can definitely reduce the amount of butter used.  Also, based on other user's comments, I did not flour the shrimp, but used ready to eat shrimp and just tossed them in at the end to heat up.

Delicious.  I'd go lighter on the Worc sauce, and used some sauteed onions to add some texture to the sauce.  But it was fine the way it was written!

An excellent recipe with just the right amount of everything in it. I shook off any extra flour and there was no clumping at all, especially if you put it in HOT oil to brown it up pretty fast. Loved it!

This recipe was so tasty but very messy and time consuming (it took me almost 2 hours from prep to finish) I didn't have fresh herbs so I just sprinkled a bit of Italian seasoning on at the end. Otherwise I followed the instructions to the letter and everyone loved it. Yes. I would make this again on a cheat day.

My family loved it! I also made a few changes to the recipe after reading some reviews. I didn't flour the shrimp, was out of white wine so I used red was out of chicken broth so I used two chicken bouillon cubes and reduced the lemon juice to two tablespoons. I added a little red pepper flakes, a bit more butter and lactate milk with cornstarch to thicken. My family of 7 was sad I didn't make enough for seconds. By the time I thought to take a picture, the pot was empty.

Very good!  I realized I only had pinot grigio, not dry, so I used half the amount of dry sherry, I felt the sherry overpowered a bit but it was good.  I will continue to mess with the recipe for our personal tastes until I get the right combo for my family.  I served it over pasta and next time will try it over fresh spinach and add mushrooms and pine nuts like I used to have at Macaroni Grill.

It was okay. Not great not awful. I replaced half of the wine with chicken broth as I am not a big fan of white wine in cooking. Everything else I left the same.

Definately too lemony and I reduced the lemon to 3T.  The sauce was too watery with this recipe so I added italian style bread crumbs to thicken.  I don't think I would make it again.
