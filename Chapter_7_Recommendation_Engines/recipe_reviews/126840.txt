jbchef - this recipe has nothing to do with scrambled eggs!  It is a cheese since it is made by curdling milk.  It is a fresh cheese made for Easter with eggs.  This is the recipe my grandmother, mother and I have made for over 100 years.   I have also added a pinch of fresh nutmeg for a little kick.  I also server it with beets horseradish and cold sliced keilbasa for Easter breakfast.

Thank you. I made this when I was growing up in a Byzantine Catholic church. It is long since gone. I forgot the recipe. The only thing different is that we would take cloves and decorate the cheese with a cross.

uhhh...this isn't cheese, it's a way to eat leftover scrambled eggs...and there are a thousand ways or so to season the recipe and make it more than that.

This is exactly as my Grandmother and Great Grandmother made it.  it will be the first Easter without her and I am making it alone.  It will be sad but I know she will be with me in spirit while I make it.  Love and miss you Gram.

Just finished making my Easter cheese. A recipe that has been handed down for generations from my Slovak ancestors. My only variation is to add some water , and when that surfaces you know you are done. The eggs are to indicate a new beginning .
Happy Easter

I do pretty much the same thing, but add vanilla and a bit of sugar.  Also, make sure not to use too much milk with the SIZE of the eggs you get. If eggs are small, use less milk or it will be watery.  Been making this for about 10 years. Family loves it and it's a great tradition from my Slovak grandparents.

I add 1 Tbsp. sugar like my mom always did and I add 1 tsp. cinnamon because my daughter and her family love it that way. It is a traditional recipe made by generations of Eastern Europeans. It is made from curdled milk and is a very mild cheese. It would be kind if people could refrain from put downs of traditional foods of other cultures. It's ok to say you don't care for a recipe,  please refrain from comments telling us that it is not what we say it is and saying it's just leftovers.

This is my mother's recipe which I have been making since she passed  away but  I moved a few months ago and  I  haven't been able  to find the box with her recipes.  Thanks for sharing.  I decided to make it now even though I  missed Easter.

perfect tastes almost as my grandmother used to make.  I used my homemade beet relish on it and it was perfect.  Thank you for this childhood memory.

I make this every year, just as this recipe is written except for the smashing part.  That is unnecessary.  A friend of mine tried a variation wtih chopped jalapeno and that is DELICIOUS

My family has always called it egg cheese but we have always had it on Easter.  However we also put pepper to taste.  Made it this year for the first time since ma passed and was perfect.  Thank you!
