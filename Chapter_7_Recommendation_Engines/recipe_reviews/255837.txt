1.27.17   I’m not convinced that coconut milk is the right choice for creole rice, but it did make it nice and creamy.  I simply didn’t care for the thyme in this recipe but, admittedly, this just could be a personal taste preference.  When I think “creole,” I think bold, highly-seasoned food, but this was very mild and mellow.  I don’t know, maybe keep the coconut milk, but substitute some creole seasoning for the thyme?  Or perhaps substitute chicken broth for the coconut milk, keep the thyme, but add some creole seasoning?   This was OK and worked as a side dish to some grilled shrimp, but maybe retitle the recipe because it’s really a misnomer in my opinion.   Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I was expecting to taste the coconut in this but  the other flavors were too overwhelming and not in a good way. Nobody in the family was digging it and we are rice and bean eaters.

I really thought this was good! I did make some changes following another review like adding different spices and I used some broth powder for some more taste. It's really good though. I like the cloves
