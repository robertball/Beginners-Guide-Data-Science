I had a blast making these pickles! They are so close to tasting like Tony Packo's Sweet Hots. I made two gallons, one jar cut into spears and the other cut into thick slices. I like the slices better and they were to my liking after only five days. I am going to experiment with about half the sugar and a little less garlic, next time. The Tabasco is perfect, though. I processed some of the finished pint jars in a boiling water bath for ten minutes so I can keep them longer. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is similar to a recipe I have
used, except we purchased gallon jars of hamburger slices at Sam's instead of having to slice the pickles. As you described, they are dark green, crisp and yummy. Everyone loves them.  My recipe calls them "cheater pickles."  We packaged them in small containers with a red plaid ribbon for Christmas gifts.  A big hit! 
Mine did not call for the hot sauce.

This recipe was fun and easy to make. The flavor is similar to bread and butter pickles, but with a little extra kick. I love the ease in which one can adjust the recipe to suit their preferences. For instance, I didn't have hot pepper sauce, so I used red pepper flakes. Also, I used about half the sugar and the recipe came out just fine. 

Texas Christmas Pickles will be a staple in my refrigerator all year 'round! Thanks a million for sharing this recipe.

These pickles are awesome. I've been searching for a recipe like this for months! I made them at Christmas and they were a big hit. I just made my 2nd batch the other day. I did make a couple of changes...I used the sliced dill pickles. I used about 5-6 oz of jalapeno juice instead of tabasco. (from a jar of pickled jalapeno's)I also added about 1 1/2 cups of sliced jalapeno's (I had to remove some pickles to make room.) 4 1/2 cups of sugar was all I used as well. These were so crisp! I've had several requests for the recipe. These are excellent with grilled cheese sandwiches and burgers.

I tried these and they turned out great ,as long as I used the cheap brand of dill pickles ,whether I made strips out of whole ones, or ,the sliced ones , (both of the "cheap" ones came from Sam's), when I tried recipe using "Claussen" Dill Strips they turned out shriveled and limp, They still had a good taste , but were not crunchy ! My friends and family love the cheap, crunchy ones ,to those who like them hotter, I add a couple of red peppers, makes them pretty ,too

Note: sugar pulls out the moisture from the drained pickles.  If your pickle spears come out too shrunken, cut the amount of sugar. One or two reviews said they cut the sugar by half.

I was afraid to make these so I used a 1/2 gallon of pickles.  I sliced them into spears.  They sort of shriveled up and look funny....is that right?  They are tasty, just weird looking.  I will try them again, but want to try slices instead of spears.  A nice sweet/spicy flavor.  Very nice.

I've had this recipe for years and finally have tried it!  My family will love the sweet spicy flavor.  I wanted to comment also that the original recipe hadn't warned that eventually the liquid would be greater than the jar due to the increased liquid so I poured it off and poked straigt garlic cloves in it.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" for year round.  This time around it is going faster than I can put it into smaller jars but next time I'll just start out with three gallons and then we'll each have our own.

I'd never heard of pickles like this before, so I had to try them.  They were sweet, spicy (swicy), crunchy, and fun to make.  I will make again!

These were YUMMY! I will make these all the time. Everyone I gave to liked them! Great easy recipe! Thank You! I did split the batch in half after they were done, and I put a few habaneros in one half of the batch. This gave them a huge boost in spicyness, if you like spice.

I made these for my husband's birthday party and boy were they a hit! Such an easy recipe and the results are delectable. I used a garlic dill pickle I had on hand and sliced them into chunks. I added a good squirt of Sriracha hot sauce and the heat was perfect. I can't believe how crispy they were! I'll be making these at Christmas time for sure.

Only 5 stars? :)  These are GREAT!  I added onion slices, as I love onion.  Used Nally Garlic Slices to save time, they didn't turn mushy for me.  Did I say these are GREAT?  Thanks for sharing the recipe KIKI810

These were DELICIOUS!!  I wasn't sure about the directions (starting out w/no liquid), however, they were well worth taking the chance.  I took some to work and everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe!

My family loves these pickles! I add a few quartered jalapeno peppers for heat. I also used half the sugar called for with no discernable change in taste. Great Recipe.

I wanted to try this for Christmas and bought a 680g jar of pickled dill cucumbers at the store. I just sliced them last night and added the tabasco and garlic and sugar. I have to say, it has only been one day and I have tasted them and they are fantastic. Crunchy. Tingly spicy and sweet. Addictive. I will buy a few more jars as I can't resist. I don't think this jar will last a week. Thankyou for the new Christmas recipe to add to my other pickle recipes. It's a KEEPER!

Good flavor but they were limp and looked like they were just the peel left to them all curled up. Not very pretty.

This is a great recipe! I have made these before but w/out the hot sauce. They are better with the hot sauce. You taste the sweetness first then the hot kicks in-they are great! I made 3 gallons for presents-putting them into jars.

This is the second time I made this recipe. I made two jars one with sugar and one with Splenda. I Make quarts instead of gallons just divide the recipe?. It is delicious.

I  made this recipe.  It is delicious!  Thank you for adding this to Allrecipes.com,  I had a recipe like this year's ago and lost it. I do start with Hamburger sliced Dill pickles, saving one step. I   adjust the spices up a little; so easy to do( more to my family's taste) . I also, took these to a church pot luck, the recipe was at once requested, all I had to do was show them my phone and Allrecipes.com.  Great spicy pickle recipe!

Spectacularly good: hot, sweet, addictive. After tinkering through a bunch of batches, I have scaled down (& sped up) the recipe as follows, also adding two ingredients: use a 1-quart jar of shelf-stable whole kosher dill pickles, 2 cups sugar, 3 Tbsp. Tabasco sauce (original flavor), 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper, & 1 minced garlic clove (use 2 or 3 if you dare!). Discard the brine. Slice the pickles crosswise into thin coins of 1/8" thick or less. (Don't buy pre-sliced dill chips. The flavor is wrong for this recipe.) Place the slices in a mixing bowl. Add the garlic, chili flakes, black pepper & Tabasco. Stir to coat. Then stir in the sugar until thoroughly dampened. Refrigerate. Stir several times over the next day or so to dissolve the sugar. That's when they're ready. And they get sweeter over the course of several days.

I love these pickles and made them as a wedding gift for a couple that loves them.  I've always known them as "Crystal Pickles".  If I add hot pepper flakes, they are known as "Fire and Ice" pickles.  Either way, none stay around very long!
