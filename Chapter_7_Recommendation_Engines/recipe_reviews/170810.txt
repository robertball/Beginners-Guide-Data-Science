Wow, I love green tea flavors and this was my very first attempt at making a dessert out of matcha. I am so used to getting this flavor from green tea ice cream, it was almost bizarre to have it in a fluffy airy mousse cake like this. The color is delightful and is not as rich as a lot of cheesecake. I really enjoyed this recipe!

Good recipe. Needs more machta powder to increase flavor. A bit on the bland side in that respect but otherwise is a good recipe.

Very good. Very sweet, so the grassy-ness of the green tea doesn't stand out so much.

Avoid adding too much matcha as it can be a bit bitter.  I think a white chocolate whipped cream would be a great accompaniment to this.  I also used shortbread crust instead of graham.  Tasty and light...not heavy like traditional cheesecakes.

The crust is good. But the cheesecake part had a "gelatinous" texture/flavor to it. I think there is too much gelatin. And the flavor was very one dimensional. Maybe it needs more honey, and a splash of lemon juice or zest to brighten up the flavor. Edible, but will be looking for another recipe, or tweaking this one.

I have just finished this. However, I am concerned that, since I beat the egg directly into the mixture, it is still raw.

I just finished making this and it was pretty good. I couldn't find any matcha, which I thought was ridiculous since I live in Korea town! I decided to buy good quality green tea and emptied out 5 tea bags into my coffee grinder to produce matcha, it worked pretty well. I also incorporated some leftover matcha into my crust along with some green tea Pocky sticks. I don't like melting my butter when I make gram cracker crusts because I feel that mixing in cold butter until the crumbs stick together give it a better taste and texture. I also decorated the cheesecake with green tea whipping cream, an apple swan and pocky sticks. Overall it's a pretty good recipe, will defiantly be making it again (:

I am a low carb lady and this recipe was so simply to modify!  I just exchanged the sugar and honey for Zsweet.  Plus I used a coconut butter crust instead of the graham cracker.   I love it and will defiantly be making it again.

Super good! Kind of light but just right! Added matcha powder on top to add a little more flavor
