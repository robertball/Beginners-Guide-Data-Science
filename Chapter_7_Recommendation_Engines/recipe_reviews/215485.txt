This is outstanding.  Also consider increasing the chili sauce and decreasing the oil for a little more bite.

Made this exactly as the recipe says.  I thought it was FAB!  Thanks I'll use this again.  Only thing, maybe a little less oil, but thats really a stretch.  Flavor was awesome and my kids ate ALL OF IT!  (they are 6 and 8)

His mother-in-law is my mother so I agree about the recipe.  I only leave the tails on if I'm serving these as an appetizer.  They're delicious cold too.

We thought this was really good.  Not excellent- partly because the shrimp didn't really have time to soak up the marinade.  I think this is a very good base for people (like me) who like to experiment with sublte changes.

Wow! This definitely is some of the "Best BBQ Shrimp Ever"! I did cut way back on the oil though...only using a little over 1/4 cup.  I used olive oil vs. canola and 1/4 tsp. of tabasco.  I also added a little chili garlic sauce and a splash of white wine vinegar.  I let this marinate about 4 hours and these were fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe Huge!

Yum!  My kids and I loved this recipe.  I changed it a bit.  I used regular chili sauce, marinated about 1 hour then cook in a pan on the stove.

Really good - we like these in some tortillas or lettuce wraps with some rice. I didn't have chili sauce, but I did have a hot-sauce flavoured ketchup - so I used that with about a tbsp of Siracha hot-sauce to kit it up a bit. The sugars caramelize nicely on the bbq.

Learned about this recipe in early November. First time, followed directions to a "t." Next FOUR times, I winged it adding more chili sauce and less oil as others have recommended. I also used the jarred minced garlic. No matter, it turns out perfectly each time. This is one of my favorite recipes in the world. Thank you so much Huge's  Mom!

I was a little concerned with how spicy this recipe would be when reading through the ingredients but was surprised at how subtle the flavour was when the shrimp were cooked!  I happened to have fresh oregano in our herb garden and used that instead of the dried version.  Also substituted the tomato based chili (realized at the last minute that I didn’t have any) with a combination of sweet chili sauce and ketchup....which seemed to be ok.  A great summer bbq recipe that we’ll be trying again!

This is a great marinade.  I pan fried the shrimp on medium high for about 3 minutes/side (its about -10 outside so I didn't feel like grilling).  The shrimp were great.  The marinade gave them a great flavor.  I will definitely use this again!

This was a little too spicy for me.  I think the next time I make it I will cut back on the hot sauce.  It was very good otherwise.
