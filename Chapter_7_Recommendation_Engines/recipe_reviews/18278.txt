Good potatoes but need some modifications: 1)Divide the amt of butter required, put half in with the potatoes into the baking dish 2) sprinkle cheese over all 3) pour topping over potatoes and cheese 4) pour remaining butter over all.  I found that these steps allow the potatoes to cook more evenly and there isn't a pool of butter at the bottom of the dish.  Will make again with my changes.

These were bland, bland, bland. We each took a big spoonful and neither one of us finished them.  We won't make these again - there's too many other super potato recipes out there to waste time on this one.  Sorry!

these are great and so quick and easy. They could stand to be spiced up a bit and I am sure many different seasonings would work! I think that you would need to double the recipe if you had a family of 4 or more to provide for seconds. These will become a regular side dish in my casa. Thanks:)

Cooked it for dinner last night. I think next time I am going to use bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, and search for seasonings to give it some more flavor. Other than that no body believed that it was from canned potatoes.

I was in a frenzy trying to make a dish for a pot-luck.  I did some searching and found this recipe.  I had to make it so quick that I took it to the party without even knowing if it'd taste good.  They were a hit! Everyone, including me and my husband, LOVED THEM! Thanks so much!

I used real potatoes and added salt and pepper, but it was a nice change for a potato side dish.

My husband and I really loved these potatoes.  I didn't have any problem with there being too much butter, but I do agree that they could use some additional spices.

Awesome, I used to eat these when I was little and for some reason my family just stopped making it. I used real potatoes though, I diced them and used about 5 good sized ones peels and all. And I used a lot more cheese too :-)

Perhaps it would be better to use a little less butter.

This was good. I used potatoes I had on hand, instead of cornflakes I used panko bread crumbs. I will make this again, but I will double it next time. LisaMac

These were not good at all.  I've made many recipes thinking this would be quicker.....guess there lies the mistake in the choice. No one finished any of them.  Sorry.

These were ok. I think I will use fresh potatoes next time and just add some water to soften them. It's almost like it needed something else...

I would use less butter next time, I might also try bread crumbs. My Husband also said he would like more cheese, but over all everyone loved it and i will make it again. Great for football parties.
