Delicious! Great recipe, and used butter instead of shortening. My family loved them!

These were pretty good.  The cookie came out thick and chewy, but it was very very dense.  The only changes I made were to use white chocolate chips and smooth peanut butter, since that was all I had in my pantry.  People who don't like peanutbutter said they were good, but they were just too dense for my tastes.  I garnished with raspberries for a bit of color...

I cut this recipe in half and used a half cup of regular Crisco shortening. I also used mini semi sweet chocolate chips. I baked these at 350* for eight minutes. The flavor of these are OUTSTANDING but they did not flatten out at all. These turned out more like drops. I most definitely will make these again but I would use half butter in place of some of the shortening.

These are simply delicious! They are soft and chewy, and addicting! I used a Hershey's Symphony milk chocolate bar chopped up in pieces instead of chocolate chips, it's a milkier chocolate which compliments the cookie a lot better than regular chocolate chips.

Very rich & chocolatey!  The only thing that I would change would be to add more peanut butter.  Next time I make these, I'll add 1-1/2 cups instead of just 1 cup.
Other than that they are super delicious!

Ugh - the only redeeming thing in this recipe is
they didn't stick to the cookie sheet
