I used 6 muffin cups instead of the 4 ramekins she recommended. The cups that I filled only half-way seemed to work well, but the full cups were very dense, eggy blobs. All of the popovers did fall fairly quickly after being removed from the heat.

Decent. Good w/ honey and/or jam. I had something similar when I was a child. This isn't the recipe. These are dense, kinda like a pancake but chewy. I don't think I will make them again.

Very simple and very good.  I have a popover pan I used instead of the custard cups and it made three popovers.   I also added about a 1/4 cup of shredded white cheddar...yum!
