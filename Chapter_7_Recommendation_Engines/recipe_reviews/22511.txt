This is great stuff! Very much like traditional hummus, but a little thinner. The Italian dressing adds a nice zest. A good change from the usual hummus.

This recipe is fantastic!  I have made it at least 10 times, always to rave reviews.  Try sprinkling some celery salt on top before serving!

This was delicious! I used 2 different types of salad dressing (to finish up the bottles), one of which had roasted garlic in it (so I omitted the garlic powder), the other was a balsamic vinagrette. I found that the salad dressing made the dip too sour, so I blended the whole red pepper instead of just 1/2 and it was perfect (with a nice slightly sweet taste). I also omitted the sesame seeds since I didn't have any. My husband *hates* hummus, but liked this one as you could not taste the chickpeas. This is a versatile dip, you can make all kinds of adjustments to your liking.

This dip is terrible!   The ingredients didn't sound like a good mix to me, but I tried it because of all the rave reviews.   I attempted to salvage it by adding more ingredients, but ended up throwing it all away.    If you appreciate true hummus, you probably won't care for this.

I used this recipe because it has no tahini in it and I didn't have any but wanted some hummus. I only used the beans, italian dressing and mayo. It was easy and good.

Good tasting, easy to make hummus!  I thought it was somewhat plain, but my DD loved it!
