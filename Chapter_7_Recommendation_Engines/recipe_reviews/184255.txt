Very tasty pork roast. I found the time/temp a little off. Pork should be cooked to 140-145 degrees and then set aside to rest for 15 minutes; the internal temp will go up and the juices will seep throughout the meat. A foolproof rule of thumb to use is 15 minutes per pound @ 350 degrees. In my experience, cooking to an internal temp of 160 or above usually results in unpleasantly dry meat. For succulence, give my suggestion a try.

FIVE STARS FOR FLAVOR w a MINT TWIST. Thought the sauce would be too "gunky sweet" with all that sugar from jam & cranberry sauce, it wasn't. All said it was yummy AND from my point of view, the quickest roast I ever made (fully thawed) but it's not walk away time. I was busy making gravy & ladling every 10 min.  Originally I only had 1/2C of apple jelly & used 1/2C of Mint Jelly w flecks of mint, to make up for it. It was a DELIGHTFULLY HAPPY ACCIDENT & lent a subtle undertone of mint. Next time I will use solely mint to replace the apple jelly.   I had at least 1 Cup of sauce, not used for basting & put it in a saucepan, added at least three cups of chicken broth (stirring some of it with 3T of Corn starch) & it was a wonderful lighter gravy & there was plenty of it.  Entire dinner was served w steamed fresh carrots & fresh green beans & (canned)baby pototoes (my best quick assistant in the kitchen) IT WAS ALL PERFECT! We added an addtional splash of English mint sauce on our potatoes(not jam-I'll have to upload a recipe for it:

Wow, was this delicious!  We followed the recipe exactly and it was not only very easy (the only thing that could be considered possibly "difficult" is reglazing every 10 minutes - I did it every 12-15 minutes) but absolutely scrumptious.  The whole house smelled great, too!

This sauce is a perfect complement to the savory pork roast.  The blend of cranberry, sweetness of the apple jelly play off the salty boullion and spirited horseradish.  The thyme cannot be left out.  It makes this a super special sauce.  My family begs for extra sauce.

This was an great recipe. My room mate is in culinary school so we are always trying new things. I found this online and had to try it. The only thing I changed was Cranberry Jelly instead of canned cranberries, in hopes that it would be more jelly like, and it was delicious. We will for sure be making this again. Served it with mashed potatoes and a gravy made from a little of the sauce and chicken stock. VERY GOOD! I'd recommend this too anyone who is looking for a good homemade dinner.

Savory is an accurate descriptor for this recipe.  Loved by all.  Will make again.  Followed the directions with the exception of the oven temperature which was lowered to 350 degrees.  Used a thermometer, as always, to make sure the roast was done.  Will maybe raise the horseradish amount a tad, just because.

DELICIOUS! What an unusual combination of ingredients. I must admit I was a little leery of this recipe, but I love cranberry sauce and it was worth a try. First, I pan seared the roast. I then prepared the sauce with all the ingredients listed and brought to a boil. Finally, placed roast and sauce in my slow cooker and let it cook for 5 hours. WOW, the sauce was the perfect consistency and so tangy. A must try recipe.

Really great recipe. I did cut the cut the garlic powder back to 1 tsp. as I didn't want the garlic to overpower the other flavours.  Very nice tasting sauce.  The roast was turned out very tender and I will be making it again.

A four pound center cut pork roast will not be ready in 50 minutes.  Internal temp was 70 degrees.  The 425 setting is too hot.  Reduced temp to 350 and cooked for another hour to reach 160 internal temp.  Glaze was burnt and unpleasant.  Had to scrape it off, what little was left in the pan.  There's got to be a typo in this method!

I too would serve this to the president.  Made as directed for the sauce.  I did coat the meat with cornstarch, salt and pepper and brown before putting into the oven. This will help the glaze stick to the meat instead of falling off.  Cook only to internal temp. of 140 and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. Temp. will rise while resting.  If you cook to 160 you will dry out the meat and it will be overcooked.

This was such a great recipe. Very easy to prepare. I didn't have any thyme, so I left it out and even my pickiest son went back for seconds. I also used jellied cranberry sauce as I didn't have any whole berry on hand. I can't wait to make it again. Next time, with thyme.

This is one of those recipes that looked like you spent hours preparing it, but, in reality it is SO E-Z and quite fast (mine was done in a bit less then 45min.).  My gang loved it.  Next time I may double the sauce since most of it evaporated during cooking time.

First of all, I really loved the sauce.  The combination of all the different ingredients seemed strange to me at first, but it really is delicious with the pork loin.  However, like others, I think the temperature is just a bit over-done.  We like to cook our pork to about 145, and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  I meant to do that this time, but it had already reached 159 when I checked the first time.  it was still very good, especially with the excellent sauce.  But, I think it would have been a bit more tender if I had taken it out of the oven about 10 degrees sooner.

Great Recipe, tasty, so easy and quick!  I did follow the recommendations by Paula - Reviewed on Oct. 20, 2009 - " Pork should be cooked to 140-145 degrees and then set aside to rest for 15 minutes; the internal temp will go up and the juices will seep throughout the meat. A foolproof rule of thumb to use is 15 minutes per pound @ 350 degrees. In my experience, cooking to an internal temp of 160 or above usually results in unpleasantly dry meat. For succulence, give my suggestion a try. " - I made thises adjustments and it turned out to be moist and the hubby loved it!

This was sooo good.  Thanks to CNBH for the cooking tip.  Roasting at 350 for 15 minutes per pound worked perfectly.  My roast was so juicy, and I have always had trouble with pork coming out dry and tough.  Also substuted plum jelly for apple.  I couldn't find apple jelly anywhere.  I also browned the roast on the stove before coating with the glaze and roasting.  This one gets filed in Family Favorites.

This recipe was amazing!  The pork turns out so tender, especially following previous reviewers' suggestions of NOT cooking to internal temperatre of 160.  The leftovers were just as tender when I reheated them in the microwave.

This is my new favorite pork recipe.  Easy, and so delicious.  Served it with the sauce scooped up from the pan - yumm!  Used apricot jam as couldn't find apple jelly.  All the kids gobbled it up, too!

very easy and delicious as it says. I took it out at 145F and let it sit as others suggested. I would recommend bringing the meat up to room temperature before cooking.

I received this recipe in email this morning and made it for dinner tonight. We loved it. I did not have apple jelly so, as others did, I used apple sauce. I cut the apple sauce down to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup hot peach and apple chutney. To accomodate the heat of the chutney I cut the horseradish down by 1/4 tsp. In retrospect, I don't think that was necessary. I also used fresh minced garlic rather than the powder and jellied cranberry. I was thinking that my sisters brandied holiday cranberries would probably be even more delicious. I heated my oven to the temp the author recommended and cooked the roast about 10 min then reduced the temp down to 350 for the remainder of the time. I too used an instant read thermometer to get to 145-150 before I removed it to rest. We found the roast perfectly juicy and delicious.  My original intent was to do an au gratin potato but being rather lazy I chose  Uncle Bens Wild Rice. It was a perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the meat. We also had baked asparagus with balsamic butter (another All Recipes fav) and winter squash filled and baked with a dab of butter, a small bit of brown sugar and apple sauce. I had more than half the cranberry sauce left over so I just popped in the freezer for next time... or perhaps for ribs... or chicken....

I rarely review recipes, made this today exactly as ingredients were listed. I was very unsure about the combination of apple jelly and mustard. But I tried it anyway. The only change I made was to cook in a crock pot with the sauce dumped over the pork loin. I didn't want to have to baste it every 10 minutes. I cooked it for two hours and it came out moist and delicious. Will definitely make it again.

I made this w/ only 3 bouillon cubes, pear jelly, and one chopped Rome apple.  All other ingredients were the same as specified.  I cooked for 6 hours in a crock pot and it was delicious!!  Best pork loin ever!

Wonderful!  I'm not one for roasts but this is a slam dunk.  The 1st time my mega grocery store was out of apple jelly, so I used cherry preserves.  Absolutely fantastic with either flavor.

fantastic! made a 6.5 lb roast for a family get together, doubled the glaze. Cut the loin in half & poured half of the glaze over it & marinaded overnight. poured half of leftover glaze (cold) on loin before roasting - saving last portion of glaze to be heated & used for sauce at the table. Took out of oven at 150 degrees & let rest for 20 minutes before carving. Everyone loved it! Thanks :)

Roasting time was perfect. (And it's a good thing too, because my power went out.) I'll be honest, the sauce sort of smelled nasty when I was putting it together. So much so, that I didn't bother tasting it. I just steeled myself and dumped it over the meat. I'm glad I did. Once cooked over the pork, it lost the smell and tasted fine. (It was about twice the sauce I needed for that size roast, however.) It kind of went an icky brown color around the bottom of the roast... and mine wasn't so much a glaze as a really thick layer of cran-apple-ish-ness that was hard to slice through without destroying. Which is fine, really. It just wasn't what I was expecting. There was something slightly off in the taste for me. I'm not sure if it was the thyme or the horseradish. I think if I have cranberry sauce to use up again, that I will try it with tweaks. I can't see it being requested again as is. Thanks anyway!

I prepared this for mother's day serving approximately 25 people. I used a 10 lb. roast. When I first mixed all ingredients, boiled and tasted the sauce, I was not impressed with the flavor. But when all was cooked and done it was simply AMAZING! EVERYONE raved it!!! A definite keeper for recipes!!!!

I made this with potato dumplings it was great!.  For the sauce I did it exactly as it told me to except I used my homemade 1/2 of each:  peach jelly & apple rhubarb chutney (it has whole cranberries in it).  It turned out great.  I also had sliced cooked carrots on the side and made a gravy from the sauce with some extra water & cornstarch for thickening.  DELISH

Sauce is soooooo good. Would be good with any meat. I could see adding some poblano peppers to this for some spice and it being even more amazing.

To be fair, I always do the recipe exactly as shown for the first time.  This was awesome, and I would not change a thing.  A definite "do again" Used a piece of pork tenderloin.  Yummmmm.  Glaze is an excellant combination  of flavors.

Excellent and HUGE hit with my boyfriend. Followed recipe exactly, but used fresh thyme (so much more fragrant). As other reviewers have commented, it's best to use a meat thermometer since cooking times will definitely vary depending on density and thickness of various roast sizes. All-in-all, a real keeper, and can't imagine having to tweak this recipe in any manner whatsoever. Leftover pork sandwiches are calling my name..... *smile*   UPDATE: Just used the last of the leftovers (it was a big roast for two people)for open faced sandwiches. Used a packet of pork gravy mix, but I stirred in about two tablespoons of the leftover sauce to amp up the gravy. OMG. Speechless.

Delicious! I made this for dinner and it was a big hit. I couldn't find apple jelly, so I substituted with peach jelly. I also am not a big fan of horseradish, so I left that out. This one is a keeper!

EXCELLENT!  Made this for a dinner party last.  My Godson had THREE helpings.  As a side dish, I roasted sweet potato wedge basted with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt.  I also made a cranberry apple relish.  All the flavors were perfect together.  I added a bit more horseradish and Dijon than the recipe called for - that was a good add; would do it again for sure.

This was very tasty and easy to make. A total success at a dinner party we hosted.  My local Safeway did not have apple jelly, so I substituted low-sugar apricot preserves.    I wonder about cooking the loin at such a high temperature, however.  Next time, I may try 350 or 375.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year for my husband (he doesn't like turkey).  I gave it three stars as a compromise because he liked it but I didn't like it at all.  It was a pretty easy recipe to follow but it took quite abit longer to cook than the time stated in the recipe.

Very good, although I expected the flavor of the roast to pick up the flavors of the glaze more. Used a cooking bag and it turned out fine, although it wasn't convenient to glaze the roast every 10 minutes as directed. Will try glaze with a turkey breast at some point.

Very good! I didn't have time to cook as directed. I just threw it into the crock pot on low for about 6-7 hours, put a little cranberry sauce under the meat, sprinkled all the ingredients on top of the pork (just a sprinkle of powdered chicken bullion and no horseradish), along with the rest of the cranberry and maybe half a cup of grape jelly (I didn't have apple). The flavor was great. The sauce it made was extremely tasty. I am sure baking as directed is even better, but if your in a rush, this still works out great. My family loved it.

This was the best recipe I've ever used for pork!  I agree with some other reviews that the sauce smelled a little weird while it was boiling, but by the time I poured it onto the pork and they started cooking together, the smells blended nicely.  I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dried.  I stabbed the pork with a knife a few times so the sauce would work its way in.  I peeled and sliced a granny smith apple to arrange around the pork in the pan, and cooked it covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 20 more at 350.  I basted it a few times while it was uncovered, and prepared mashed potatoes and green beans as side dishes.  DELICIOUS MEAL!  I had some extra sauce when the pork was gone, and I used it on leftover turkey too.  So good!

This was yummy.  Followed the recipe and it was a big hit at our Sunday night dinner.  I am really happy to have found a pork loin recipe that everyone enjoyed.  Good combination of savory and sweet. Will make it again.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner.  I made the sauce earlier in the day then took the roast and sauce to a friend's house to cook there.  I followed the recipe pretty closely (used a little less garlic powder and boullion). I have to say it does have a strange smell and I was wondering whether to use it or not.  I am so glad I did, it smelled wonderful while roasting and it was absolutely delicious.  Roasting time as directed is way off, I did it at 350 then turned it up a bit toward the end to hurry it up.  Even the brown stuff in the pan was delicious.  So easy and friends loved it.  A definite keeper.

I would make this for the President also, but I sure hope he isn't in a big hurry because if I follow the recipe again, dinner will be late.  Aside from that, it was great tasting.  Now back to the late thing, I used a convection oven, which converted the 425 to 400.  And it was not even a 2 lb roast.  I thought there was no way it could be done, but I decided I should try this, thinking that maybe I always overcook my roast.  Well I basted at 20 minutes and there was just no way it would be done in another 25.  It took me about double time for a smaller roast for some reason, I just don't know what is up with that.  But anyways, it was very flavorful and very juicy.  It probably was the most juicy pork loin I have ever fixed so this has helped me to realize that I have been overcooking in the past.  So anyways, I didnt have horseradish - never use it so never have it, and I halved the glaze but still had plenty left so I froze it and it will be ready to go in case the President comes for dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe only took me about 1 hour to prepare and cook and it tasted like I slaved over the oven for hours!  It was soooo good and my kids loved it too!  Very moist.  Just enough sweet balanced with spicy. I served it with parsley red potatoes and steamed broccoli, perfect!

This recipe was yummo!! I made it using a 4 pound pork roast. I cooked the roast in a bag at 250 degrees for one hour and then raised the temp to 350 for another hour. The meat was so tender and tasty! Even my picky 5 year old ate it up and wanted seconds! I doubled the sauce to make sure we had some leftover to pour over the meat while eating it. I used a can of whole cranberry sauce and a can of jellied cranberry sauce. I didn't double the amount of bullion though, i didn't think it would need that much and it sure didn't! It was perfect! I always used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I will definitely be making this again! I saved some of the sauce in the fridge (uncooked) to use on ribs and chicken I'll be making later this week. I imagine it will be just as yummy! I was instructed by my family to make this again on Thanksgiving for those that aren't turkey lovers. This time I'll try it with a pork loin. Can't wait to eat it again! So yummy and so easy to make!

Most of the recipes were 2.5 to 3 hrs and I didn't have that kind of time so I tried this one. Turned out I didn't have a number of the ingredients: used a can of tangerines instead of the cranberries; what was left of a jar of pineapple marmalade instead of the apple jelly; and regular mustard instead of dijon. Tasted delicious and helped clean out the cupboards.

I did have to modify the recipe but the outcome was dee-licious. No apple jelly, cannot eat anything apple so I used apricot jam also no horseradish so I used fresh grated ginger and fresh garlic instead of the powder. Worth repeat performance.

I thought the sauce was very tasty! The zip of the mustard and horseradish balanced the sweetness of the other ingredients nicely. I was happy that I put foil in the pan - it would have been a nightmare to clean up, otherwise.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  I had a jar of Cherry Jalapeno jelly on hand so I used that in place of the apple jelly and horseradish and the flavors worked beautifully together.  This is a keeper.

Very very tastey but the sauce has an odd smell. I still make it as we love the flavor but keep the lid on the saucepan while cooking the sauce.

This was the best glaze ever.  I used sugar free Marmalade instead of apple jelly as I am diabetic and could not find apple jelly.  I also used rosemary instead of thyme as I just don't like thyme.

It was delicious. The dijon mustard and horseradish gave a nice little kick.  This glaze was also great on pork chops and chicken.

Easy to make and result was delicious.  I set aside about half the sauce (before basting) to serve in a gravy boat.  The only complaint I have is that it was difficult to judge when the pork was done and ours ended up slightly overcooked, so it was a touch on the dry side.

Very good! I cooked the pork loin roast to 160 degrees which took a little more than 45 minutes. I even cut the roast length wise so it won't take so long to cook. A 4lb roast is quite big! I think next time I won't cook it as long..maybe to 150 degrees. The pork was slightly tough. I liked the cranberry sauce but didn't love it. I think it had too much bouillon flavor. I will cut down on that next time. Otherwise the sauce was good. I will definitely make this again with a couple changes.

Just ok. The pork loin was moist, but this just didn't do anything for me. I'll make a cranberry chutney recipe I like, and serve over sliced pork loin next time. Won't make this again.

This is very, very good. I actually just used 4olbs of tenderloins, which was actually 4 separate pieces and just poured this over them in the pan. There are not many meals that all the boys agree on, but they did this. And we have been eating the leftovers both cold and hot, such a good flavor. Be sure to serve with some of the sauce. Yum!

EXCELLENT!!  We made this using a pork tenderloin and we grilled it instead of roasting it in the oven.  I made the sauce in the afternoon and just let it sit at room temperature until it was time to grill.  I divided the sauce and gave half to Hubs to use as a basting sauce after searing the tenderloin on the grill.  I heated the other half and used it to drizzle on when plating.  My horseradish didn’t have much oooomph, so I couldn’t even taste it, which I would have liked, but really didn’t miss.  We grilled the tenderloin to an internal temperature of 145 and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing, which produced a nice tender, pink center.  A word of caution, if you cook this to 160 degrees, it will dry it out and may become tough, especially if you’re using a pork loin roast.  These days pork doesn’t have to be cooked to death.

Fresh thyme from your garden is what is best for this recipe.  You can harvest the thyme twigs and add them whole to the sauce or you can strip the leaves and throw away the stems. There are numerous different flavors of thyme:  lemon thyme, lime thyme, orange thyme, as well as common thyme.  Thyme is a perrenial that comes back every year and can be propogated through seeds or through layering (covering a branch with dirt and a rock until it roots).

Abolutely delicious!!!  I used a center cut-not tenderloin-pork roast (about 2 1/4 pounds).  I cooked it at 350 but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  The sauce was amazingly yummy.  I must say that I was surprised at how good it turned out.  Husband and picky 16 y.o. son loved it.  We do have leftovers of both pork and the gravy for later in the week.  I also have some of the unused glaze as the roast was small and I'm going to try it with pork chops or boneless chicken.  I served it with homemade home fries, green beans and warm corn bread.  Next time I'll try sweet potatoes or sweet potatoe home fries. Thanks for the great recipe, so easy and delicious-a definite keeper!!

I change some of the amounts in the recipe.  I added apple sauce instead of apple jelly, used more garlic and horseradish by about 1 tspn and used honey mustard instead of regular.  I also used jellied cranberries instead of whole berry and half the thyme.  We also mixed it with pork gravy and it was delicious.  The pork was very tender, however I used a bag and cooked it for 40 mins at 325 not 425 and it was still a soft pink in the middle which makes it more tender.  A great recipe and one we will use again.

This was good, but like another member, I had to cook it much longer than 45 minutes.  My starting temp was 73 degrees.  I would like clarification on what type and size of pan to use.  Maybe that would help with the cooking time.  That being said, the recipe is very good.  It was more of a dessert for us since everything else was finished a half an hour earlier!  I will make it again with extra sauce.  Thanks!

Everyone loved it. Made it with pork tenderloin. The meat was  moist. I doubled the marinade & made it earlier in the morning. When it cooled off, I placed some of it on top of the meat in a baggie & refrigerated it until ready to bake, reserving the rest for mealtime. The meat was basted with the marinade from the baggie & I warmed up the reserved marinade in a small saucepan to serve over the meat.  Even cold, he leftovers were delicious!

I made this just as written and this is one of the best pork loin roasts I've made. The sauce is on the sweet side and I wouldn't to use it on side but you don't notice the sweetness when its on the meat. My 4 lb roast did take 1hr 15min to cook to 145 at 425. I also didn't baste every 10min as the roast was completely covered with the sauce every time I went to go put some on. I wanted to try this out before I make it for Christmas dinner. I think I may try sugar free apple jelly and add a little more horseradish and mustard but only because I'm trying to watch my sugar intake.

Substituted apricot preserves for apple jelly. Didn't use any horseradish. Cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes. The roast was a little fatty so a tenderloin might be even better. Next time would like to try in slow cooker. We used the cranberry sauce mix over roasted potatoes.

made this last night and it was, and I quote, "Amazing!"

I cooked it at 350 for about an hour until the thermometer read 145 and I let it rest for a good fifteen minutes.

I did not baste the roast every 10 minutes, though, as it would mess with the oven temp. I didn't really need to baste it, though, as the sauce stayed on the meat the whole time.

I put celery, potatoes, and carrots in the roasting pan along w/ the pork roast.

The sauce is amazing! I will definitely make just the sauce again to serve with other meals. Yum!

OMG This was super easy! Had to cut the giant pork loin in half since I doubled the recipe for a luncheon at church. But it tastes heavenly! Something I would def think about doing for a holiday dinner. Will try to take pictures tomorrow when it is plated for reference! Highly Recommended!!!

I wasn't wowed by it.  But it was a nice change.  I'm always looking for a different way to spice up pork.  I think I still prefer Erindix's "Slow Cooker Porkchops II" or Chowsito "Amazing Pork Tenderloin in the Slow Cooker" recipes (with mushies and onions of course).

I don't cook with pork too often, so I was uneasy about trying this recipe, but I absolutely love it. I've made it several times now, and it's always amazing.

A huge hit with my little ones, one of whom is a maddeningly picky eater.  Easy, delicious, a great blend of flavors.  Cook time seemed right on as well.

This was delicious!  I am not big on pork tenderloin, but this was such an easy glaze to prepare, and the meat came out so juicy.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. However, it took longer that 45 minutes to cook a 3.5 pound roast to 160 degrees. Divided the sauce into two bowls: one to baste with and the other to add to the pork at the table. Yummm-e!

Itwas okay.  The combination of ingredients makes the sauce taste like barbeque sauce, nothing special or unique.

Really Good recipe.  I only had apple pumpkin butter so I used that instead of Apple Jelly and it turned out great.  Cooked until 155 on my thermometer.  It's a keeper!

This is so easy and so good.  I will be making this again, maybe even for an upcoming holiday dinner.  It reminds me of something you would order when you go out.  Everyone loved it even my 5 year old.  The sauce is wonderful.

I made this pork loin last night and it was fabulous to say the least!!! I did what others have written and doubled the sauce and used only 1 teaspoon of the tyme due to the fact that it is a strong seasoning. The tyme is a must though in this recipe. It was easy and delicious. A definite keeper in my opinion!

I used in crock pot with an 8-lb whole turkey breast instead. I changed the apple jelly to apple butter (or applesauce would be good), skipped the Dijon, horseradish and bouillion and used more garlic plus added sage to the recipe and put some in bottom and the rest on top. Cooked it for 2 hours on high and 6 hours on low. It was FABULOUS! thanks so much!

Oh yes, we'll be making this one again! I didn't have apple jelly, so I used apricot preserves, and it was outstanding. I also substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder, and made extra sauce from the beginning -- which I then divided: half for basting and half for the finished product. I had one of those pork roasts that comes with the little button that pops up when the meat is "cooked to perfection," and that coincided perfectly with the temp and cook time of this recipe. I served with roasted red and sweet potatoes and corn, zucchini, carrots, and green beans tossed with a light butter sauce.

This is awesome. "Tweeked" the recipe a little by using chopped fresh applies and fresh cranberries & cooking until soft. Added some suger, then rest of ingrediants. My smaill family of 3 ate the whole roast within 24 hours.... thanks so much for this one.

I give this 5 stars, but for me a little crushed thyme goes a long way, and so next time, I'll cut it back from 2 t. to 3/4 t. at most.  Otherwise, this recipe made for a wonderful and tasty dinner.  The sauce mixture was more than enough for a 1-1/2 lb pork tenderloin, but I would definitely double it for a 4 lb roast.  This went great w/ garlic mashed red potatoes and fresh cooked spinach.  Thank you!

Oh my gosh!  I loved this recipe, and so did the rest of the family.  Definitely a great dish for a company meal.  This is a recipe I'll use again and again.  Followed the recipe except using cranberry sauce I had on hand.  The meat was juicy and the sauce was great.

Wow! This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe as it is.  I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans and curried butternut squash soup.  My husband and his parents LOVED it.  It reminded me of a Thanksgiving dinner without all the hassles of roasting a whole turkey.

I think this would have been much better for our tastes if I had used one teas. of thyme instead of two. I would recommend that unless you are positive about how much you like the herb, starting with less is better. Otherwise a very interesting blend of flavors & very easy to put together.

Fantastic!! I doubled the sauce to use as gravy.  With a 5 lb roast, using a meat thermometer it took 1hr 15min to reach 160. It was well worth the wait- not to sweet, balanced by the herbs and horseradish.  Ran out of thyme and made up the difference with marjoram, still tasted great.

This was a great recipe!  Even my picky 14-year old thought that the pork roast tasted great!  The only thing I didn't do was add the chicken cubes as I didn't have any, but otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T.  Next time, I will add a little less thyme.

Like Paula, I found that the timing was off a bit. I had to leave it in an extra 20 minutes and ended up with some pink deep in the roast. I’m thinking to let it set for 15 minutes

After reading the recipe, I knew my family would love it. However, once I was committed, I discovered it wasn't a loin cut that was thawed and I didn't have all the ingredients I thought I did. I read through a lot of the reviews and got an idea of compromises/substitutions I could use. So, here is what I did. 
 I used cranberry jelly, homemade peach jam, deli-style mustard, chicken base, prepared wasabi, 2 tsp. garlic powder,  1 tsp. dried thyme, pork sirloin roast (3 pieces equaling 6.7#). Tied roasts. 425*Fan for 12 min. Reduce temp to 325*Fan and baste every 12 min. Took about a full hour to cook. Even my reluctant pork eater gobbled it up. WINNER, WINNER, PORK ROAST DINNER!

I give it a quick sear in the cast iron skillet to seal in the juices, then put it in the oven. Remember to shorten your oven time if you do this. Also, I keep a good coating of the sauce on it, otherwise it gets a little dry on the edges.  Save a little sauce to drizzle on the loin after slicing. 
Delicious. My family loves it...it’s become a favorite.

This glaze is now my #1 favorite for pork loin. Followed the recipe as is. I had all ingredients in my cupboards, which made this recipe even more easy to make! The combination of all these ingredients is the Bomb! Super savory even before you bring it to a boil. (I had to give it a pre-cook taste test - and it passed!)

We love this dish! I make it with pork chops or a roast usually in the crock pot and serve it with mashed sweet potatoes drizzled in the sauce from the pork. It is a holiday favorite!

Really Good.  Like "Good4ursoul" says make a second batch of sauce.  This really enhances eye appeal and gives a nice sweet topping for your sliced loin.

Made in our Dufuo. The pork was very moist - often an issue when we it in a slow cooker. Used what I had on hand - blackberry jelly & dried cranberries - very tasty but will add more horseradish next time.

This was absolutely delicious. We've been looking for  a tasty moist pork loin recipe and this is it. I used cranberry sauce instead of berries and Apple Butter instead of Apple Jelly because that is what I had on hand. I think the berries would have been better only because they would be lumpy and stay on the loin as you braze it. I made enough sauce to have generous servings of sauce when served and that was the thing to do. I will definitely have this again. The salt comes through and all of the spices are a bomb(we are a light salt family)! You can serve this to guests and you will get rave reviews. I use a meat probe when cooking and would recommend it (ruined a Prime Rib once...never again), specially with this cut of meat, it rocks!

I made this glaze and added it to a tenderloin that was already flavored (with garlic and cracked black pepper). Next time,  I plan on making this again with an unflavored pork roast. It was heavy on the thyme, so I might decrease it or eliminate it altogether. There was a sweetness that livened up an ordinary tenderloin on a Tuesday night.

Great easy and quick way to put a holiday twist on pork. Didn't have apple jelly but had some lemon jelly from the food bank and gave it a nice acid kick...

I, like someone else, made it in the crock pot after browning it on all sides. I also substituted orange marmalade for the Apple jelly. My guests raved! Making it again for a luncheon with 30 ladies this week. Will post photos then!

What is "Apple Jelly"?  The mint kind? Apple Butter?  I've never heard of plain apple jelly and the store didn't have any.  I used apricot and enjoyed the roast.

I just made this again tonight. I would definitely NOT double the sauce:  there’s plenty!  I didn’t enjoy it as much as the first time.  It’s very sweet!

Made this for the first time and it came out great. I doubled the glaze. I cooked it at 350 and used the 15 minute per pound rule and it was perfect. I glazed it every 30 minutes instead of every 25. Great flavor very juicy. My family can't wait for me to make it again.

Delicious!  Didn't have a lot of time for the prep,  so I just mixed the sauce all together and heated it up before putting it in the crockpot.  Cooked it on high for 4 hours  (should have checked it earlier,  but was busy and forgot).  Cooked it 10 degrees too long,  but irregardless it was perfect!  Will definitely keep this recipe on hand,  especially if the President stops by!  My son said he thought it was "festive" ... he's 34 and loved it.  I  thickened the sauce and used it for gravy and served it over the mashed potatoes.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe. It's very easy to put together, and if you don't have apple jelly, use some applesauce and a couple splashes of apple juice. My husband loved it, too. Thanks for the recipe AND all the good tips!

I make this often. It is a very good recipe,its easy and tasty. I make it with roasted potatoes, and vegetables. It looks like a meal you spent hours to prepare. The leftovers (if there are any) make a good sandwich. The cranberry glaze is very good. I like the end pieces, where the glaze is toasty and  baked on.

We enjoyed this roast.  We did leave out the chicken boullion and used fresh, crushed garlic.  We felt it better to cook to an internal temperature of 160 degrees, which took about an hour and 20 minutes at 415 degrees for a 5lb loin.  Only basted once or twice during the cooking time, as it just didn't look like it needed more (our sauce was thick and stayed on the roast fine).  Tasty.

Awesome pork dish!  Ingredients are perfect, however I prepare a bit differently.  Combine the sauce ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil as instructed.  While that is heating up I pan sear the seasoned pork in an oven ready skillet. Pour the sauce over the pork in skillet and bake at 350 until the pork reaches 140 degrees (20 to 30 minutes - don't guess, use a thermometer!). Remove the pork from the skillet and tent with foil. Finish the sauce on the stove top until slightly thickened.  Cut the pork in 1/2 inch slices, drizzle the sauce over the pork and serve.  Reserve some of the sauce in a bowl for dipping if desired.

I used apple butter instead of apple jelly because we couldn't find any apple jelly in our store.  Was delicious and so easy to make.  The Horseradish gave it a good spicy punch, while my husband loved the fresh Thyme that stood out.  Brought it to 140 internal temp and it was perfect.  Very juicy.  Can't wait to have leftovers tonight.
Will definitely make again.
Not sure why other reviewers were thinking the internal temp needed to be 160.  Recipe even says 145.  Had no problem with cooking it at 450 degrees and my roast was small so I only needed about 30 minutes to reach internal temp.

My hubby made this last night and it was really good.  We  cooked the pork until it was 145 degrees F, because if you cook it more than that it will probably taste dry (The lastest from the FDA states it's ok to cook pork to 140- 145 degrees F and still be safe).  We never cook pork more than 145 degrees F and it does make a difference in how delicious and moist it is.  Remove from oven and let meat rest for 10 minutes.  It was so moist and delicious and you could cut it with a fork!  We did double the sauce and used 1/2 for baking and basting and 1/2 (keeping separate from the basting one) for pouring over individual servings.  The cranberries that are baked are kind of crunchy and delicious!  My 3 year old grandson who doesn't like a lot of meat, devoured it (and requested more sauce on his serving).  This is definitely a keeper! We will be making this one often.  The only change we made was to double the sauce and that's it.

This was a great roast! only changes I made were that I adjusted the oven temp to 350 and cooked it 1 hr 15 mins. I also cut up an acorn squash and put it in the roasting pan with the pork and basted the squash every 15 mins like I did the roast and it turned out amazing!! Will definitely make again :)

I made this with Boar's Head horseradish mustard and without bouillon because I'm watching sodium intake.  I put half the sauce in a container in the fridge and the other half in a gallon sized baggie overnight to marinade boneless pork loin chops. One hour baking at 350 degrees, and these were absolutely brilliant. Boiled the remaining sauce on the stove until bubbly, served it over the chops with a wild rice blend and steamed veggies. Definitely making this again!

My favorite way to make pork roast.  I cook the glaze and pour into a pyrex measuring cup.  I baste by pouring from the cup and use remainder of glaze when serving.  I have shared this recipe many times.

I made this pork roast for a church dinner and only brought home a very small piece.  Even my husband liked it.  The cranberry sauce gave it the right favor, and I will definitely serve it again.  I liked that it only took a little over an hour to prepare and cook.

Prepared this for very picky eaters that "don't like spices" they LOVED it. definitely worth making 2nd batch of sauce as gravy. Pork was tender and tasty. This is going to be added to the rotation of go-to recipes.

Delicious!! The first time I made this exactly as written, but it was lacking a good sear on the meat. I also forgot to line my pan with foil. Line your pan with foil or it will be an absolute nightmare to clean from all of the sauce sticky sauce drippings. I made this again last night and I coated the pork loin generously with salt, pepper and garlic and seared all of the sides in a hot pan. The presentation of the meat (and the flavor)is much more appetizing when you have a beautiful golden sear. The unusual ingredients in the glaze drew me to this recipe and it is absolutely delicious. Next time I don't think I will glaze the meat every 10 minutes. It just drips off and burns at the bottom of the pan (thank goodness for foil!). By the time I glazed every 10 minutes I barely had any sauce left to dip the meat in when we were eating. I highly recommend reserving sauce for dipping...delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Scrumptious, although I admit to playing fast and loose with the recipe. I made these choices since that is what I had on hand. I started with a leftover cranberry relish that had already been flavored with jalapeno peppers and oranges. I believe there were also some pistachio nut. I attempted to follow recipe, but had no Apple jelly, so used grape. Replaced Dijon mustard with honey mustard. I replaced garlic powder with minced fresh and fresh thyme with dried. Even with all these substitutions, the end result was fantastic. My decision is that the recipe is very good and quite flexible. Because I live alone, I used an already prepared white and wild rice. That was also delicious with the sauce. A total thumbs up.

This was really good!! I left out the horseradish cause I didn't have any available. I used homemade cranberry sauce and homemade apple jelly. I also used a slow-cooker on high for 4 hours cause my oven broke down. It was amazing! My husband went for seconds, the kids cleaned their plates and my bro in law told my sis to take some notes on how to make! Will do again!!

I usually brown my pork on all four sides before putting it in a crock pot but didn't yesterday and it turned out great. Such an easy, quick dish that you can make a lot of for a large group. Love it!

How yummy!  The pork loin was very juicy and the sauce is tasty.  I made double the sauce, as suggested in the recipe, but it was not necessary and I ended up with a TON left over.  Also, my pork loin was quite small and was done in 30 minutes.  I only basted it twice during the cooking time; about every 12 minutes.

I was looking for something to cook for Christmas along with my Turkey instead of a ham or duck and I found this recipe. It had now been 3 yrs and now its a Christmas dinner tradition. Everyone absolutely loved it. Now every once in a while my boyfriend and kids beg me to make it. Its one of my favorite recipes.

I was a little disappointed in this. I didn't think the sauce added much flavor to the meat for all of the basting. Cranberry Pork Roast made in the crock pot is much better in my opinion.

Delicious. I too let the roast get to room temp prior to cooking. Used dried thyme and peach preserves. Don't love cubed bouillon so used one pack chicken flavor enhancer by Swansons. Increased horseradish a tad. Was superb cooked to 145. I just made the sauce on the stove top and chopped up half onion to it as well. Split it to serve half and use half to glaze. There was plenty. Foil in bottom of pan helps with cleanup as the sugar in the jelly can blacken in the pan. Will make often. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I loved the flavor but the reviews are right the timing is off and it is hard to glaze every 10 min. I used the glaze for a pork roast on christmas and it was a hit! then used the left over glaze on a ham for new years and that was great as I just put it on the last 15 min. 
PS the recipe says to line the pan I didn't and it was hard to get the pan clean. 
I am making it again it was great!

Couldn't get enough!!!!  My husband was licking the spoon...he enjoyed the sauce so much.  He even saved the little bit that was left to put on some leftover chicken meat!  Which made me think....this same sauce might be delicious on baked/roasted chicken as well as the pork.   I did a "test run" as I thought it might make a good Christmas dish.  I made it exactly as the recipe called, except a bit less garlic, because I am not a fan of strong garlic. It passed with flying colors.   So this is what will dress my Christmas table instead of the traditional and boring turkey.  Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used my leftover homemade cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving, added a lot more garlic (not overpowering at all!) & used stock to thin. I used it on 2-1 lb center pork loins, basting every 5 minutes. Otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe. My men were happy and that's all that matters.

The sauce in this recipe is very good!  My pork roast was only 1 1/2 pounds and even took 90 minutes to bake to 145 degrees, not 45 minutes.  I did come out nice and juicy and tangy sweet.  I baked halved potatoes around it though there was enough room in the pan, they were not even touching the meat and the sauce was very tasty served on the potatoes and slices of meat.

Next time I'll try whole berry cranberry sauce; it did come out a little too sweet. But it pairs excellently with salty mashed potatoes -- the gravy was great.

Even an emergency variation on this tender, easy to make and flavorful dish was a home run.  My grocery store did not have apple jelly, so in a pinch, and since we are not super sweet fans, I substituted no sugar orange marmalade....Success!

This is GREAT!  The pork is very moist. Basting every 10 minutes is a bit of a hassle but only cooks for a total of 45 minutes so that's not too bad.

This is SO GOOD!!! I added some ground rosemary (I love rosemary and pork) and I used pork tenderloin. So good. I recooked the sauce in a pan till boiling so that I could serve it with the finished meat. My family loved this. Even my daughter-in-law who doesn't like pork. I have also tried this sauce on chicken. Very good. Thanks for the great recipe!

i had to make necessary changes, based on what i had.  i substituted apricot jam for the apple jelly, and jellied cranberry sauce for the whole cranberry sauce.  i also added a little bit of orange juice.  i mixed all the other ingredients in with the above, let the loin sit in it for about 15 minutes.  I baked it covered for 45 min before i basted it, and then another 30 minutes, and it was perfect!  next time i think i will boil down some of the sauce to let it thicken a bit more. but the flavor was excellent

I made the mistake of substituting mint apple jelly for half the regular apple jelly and that was all I could taste.  I like mint jelly but this is not the place for it IMHO.  I added more horseradish and mustard to the sauce when I served the leftovers and it was a big improvement.  I need to make this again as written because it was easy and the pork was good.  3 stars based on my mistake!

Oh! Yes!  This is a keeper.  I did not change anything with the ingredients and it turned out perfect, moist, and tender.  The store only had a 2 1/2 lb. roast so I did half the recipe.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed.  The only problem I had was that the sauce starting burning at the high temperature.  I will make this again, but use the recommendation of 350F.

Spectacular, husband said it was a keeper. He just went on and on about how good it was. One samll variation was I was out of dijon mustard so subbed brown deli mustard. As I said this was a spectacular roast and glaze.

WOW!  This is the best flavored pork I have ever made.  It got RAVE reviews from friends and family.  I made it in the crockpot with a butt roast, and because I had no apple jelly on hand, I threw in a jar of my mom's homemade peach preserves instead.  It turned out fabulous.  Unfortunately I got the bright idea of cooking brown rice in the sauce and that absolutely didn't work -- the rice would not take up any moisture no matter how long I cooked it, and I ended up sadly discarding the whole mess -- so we didn't even have any sauce for the meat and it was still remarkable.  Can't wait to make this again!

Delicious, but still not sure I'd serve it for the President.  Still we loved it. Easy to make anytime, not just the holidays.  And the amount of sauce in one batch was ample for our 3 lb pork roast with lots to spare for gravy on the table.

Such a delicious change to applesauce on pork.. was tempted to use apple butter instead of the apple jelly, as I was canning that as well as doing dinner. Next time I will.

Mde this tonight for dinner along with the whipped butternut squash and roasted brussel sprouts (all from this site) and can't believe how great they came out with so much ease.  The roast was so good, hubby wanted thirds.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was the best pork loin I've ever made!!! I substituted apricot preserves for the apple, and used jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole. I also used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. But I do believe the Thyme makes the dish. My inlaws and family loved it! This will definately become a family staple.

This was wonderful.  Tender and very tasty.  I cooked some sugar free applesauce with cinnamon and clover for a while and used in place of apple butter.  I will try this for our Christmas buffet.

What a wonderful recipe! I made this just as recipe says and it was a hit with my husband and our son (12), daughter (6). The marinade/sauce is fabulous. Whole cranberry sauce makes it very special. I had some sauce left over which I kept warm and served on the side which was great. Such an elegant meat that is so easily prepared. Thanks for sharing such a fantastic recipe, it is being added to our favorites for sure.
