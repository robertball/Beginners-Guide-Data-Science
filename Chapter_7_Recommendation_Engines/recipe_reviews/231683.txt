Wow!  These are surprisingly good.  I really was not expecting such a light biscuit using WW flour.  I used my food processor to mix the dry ingredients, added the cold butter cut into small pieces and pulsed in the food processor to cut in the butter.  I added the milk through the pour spout while pulsing.  The dough appeared to be very wet.  I scraped it onto a lightly floured mat and instead of 'kneading' it I just gently pulled the dough together into a rectangle with floured hands and a bench scraper.  I used the bench scraper to cut the dough into 8 biscuits.  Baked as directed for exactly 10 minutes.  These were the most tender biscuits I have made.  Really delicious!  Thanks!

I add 1/4 cup more milk for cut biscuits and 1/2 c to make a drop biscuit to use for Shepherd's Pie, etc.  Also for using as a crust/topping I add 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning or 1/4 t Chili and 1/4 t garlic powder-depending on the meat content.

Wow these biscuits are crazy good!! I'm a beginner baker (I just started baking from scratch a couple months ago) and these were just so good!  I asked my 12 year old cousin to try it and she said, "It tastes just like the ones from KFC." I think they're a little moister than that, though :) 

Recipe adjustments: I used two cups of wheat flour instead of one, and skipped the sugar. The dough was a little sticky when I tried to roll it out, so I added a little more flour than just the two cups.  I also froze my butter and then grated it into the dough (a tip I read somewhere) and added just a tad more butter, too. 

These taste great with a touch of honey on them, and taste even better than they look!

Love this recipe!  I only add 1 t of sugar as they are way too sweet if you are doing savory (such as biscuits and gravy).  I also use all whole wheat flour. Instead of rolling out, use a cookie scoop to get perfectly round biscuits.

Love this recipe! Made it last night and again today. Delicious and easy. Today I subbed the all purpose flour for another cup of whole wheat flour. Still delicious and worked perfectly! Thanks for this great recipe :)
