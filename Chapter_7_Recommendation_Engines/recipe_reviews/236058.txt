I made this the other night for myself and my boyfriend and it was awesome! I cut the recipe in half (4 servings) and still had plenty of leftovers for lunch. Instead of using the grilled and ready chicken we marinated a chicken breast in italian dressing and sauteed it in a pan with a little minced garlic. We also added a little minced garlic onion powder salt and pepper to the spinach mixture while that was cooking. The result allowed for just the right amount of seasoning/flavor to be mixed throughout the dish. The only change I plan to make next time is to mix the chicken into the spinach/stuffing when I'm adding it to the baking dish so the entire dish melds a little more.

Cut in half for 3of us. It was good but tasted pretty processed. I used fresh spinach which added a little more umph.

Wouldn't make it again. Although I added sautéed celery & onion and used fresh spinach this dish was just mushy & salty (the soup?).

Super good! I did half frozen broccoli and half fresh spinach. I cooked 3 chicken breasts in crock pot with 3 garlic cloves for 6 hours. I topped with a generous amount of parm cheese. Kept very well in fridge and my husband says it got better on the 2nd night of leftovers!

I made a half recipe. I used half spinach and broccoli which we definitely enjoyed more than straight spinach. I also used my own chicken that I cooked and seasoned.

I used cream of celery soup added half a packet of Italian seasoning mix and served over lemon orzo. The chicken was still really boring and flavorless. Perhaps grilling the chicken with Italian seasoning would help bring everything together.

This is a keeper! My family loved it. Even those who do not like spinach. I used cream of chicken soup and spinach. I also chopped up my own chicken breast and sautéed in the pan and then put on the casserole. I had a bag of Pepperidge Farm Sage and Onion cube stuffing that I never used at Thanksgiving so I used that.

I enjoyed this dish. Substituted the can of soup for break broth and more butter. Added can of stewed Italian herb diced tomatoes.

Yummy! Made it without the chicken and it was still delish. Next time I will make it with ground sausage for Thanksgiving stuffing!

Chicken-Spinach Casserole Haiku: "This was total MUSH. Taste okay texture awful. Swap out the stuffing!" So if the stuffing mix had been a rice or a pasta this casserole may have been redeemed but I made it as written and found the taste to be just alright (could greatly benefit from some herbs additional seasoning or sauteed onion and garlic) and texture to be that of baby food. It was unappetizing to look at it and equally unappetizing sloshing around in our mouths and stomachs. I have to laugh reading the "serving suggestion" note about making this for a potluck or party as I would be mortified to serve this to company.
