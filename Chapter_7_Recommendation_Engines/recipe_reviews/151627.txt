This is delicious.  I subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta bc I didn't have any, and I added in some squash, red peppers, and some mushrooms (for the bf).  I also ran out of mozzarella and just topped it with parmesan cheese.  My only issue is that I used the no bake noodles and they needed longer to cook.  Next time I'll be aware of that, but the recipe calls for boiling regular lasagna noodles, so it's an adjustment I have to make anyway.  Thanks!

The only thing I added to the recipe was some mushrooms.  My vegetarian friend said that it was the best lasagna she's ever had and demanded the recipe!  Everyone else loved it, too, and they've asked so much about it that I'm making it again!

this turned out really well after i slightly modified the recipe to my own liking.

instead of using the prego sauce i made my own from diced tomatoes, brown sugar, oregano, tomato paste, salt, pepper, onions and garlic. i also added chopped spinach (defrosted). i made it along with a meat lasagna for a bunch of meat loving friends. and everyone thought they were both exceptional!

The flavor was good, but the veggies were way too crunchy.  I used a bag of matchstick carrots and steamer broccoli that I did thaw first.  If I make this recipe again, I will precook the veggies.

My family teases me about giving up meat, however they preferred this recipe over the meat Lasagna I have been making all these years! I omitted the broccoli and added spinach and mushrooms and I'm adding sharp cheddar this time to the top, because everyone loves the extra cheese! Simple and tasty!
