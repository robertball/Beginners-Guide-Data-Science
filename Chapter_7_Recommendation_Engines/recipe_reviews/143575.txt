I skipped the pie crust- too much going on.  But I really liked the streusel topping.  It is a nice change in texture from the usual bread pudding.  I used raisin swirl bread and some leftover panettone, so I cut back on the sweetener  I also used Santa Cruz brand apple blackberry sauce instead of plain apple.  It gave the pudding a darker, but still pleasant color.  Because there was already raisins in the breads, I added some dried cherries.  It worked well.

Everyone liked it.  Next time I will try doubleing the recipe and cooking in sq cake pan for bars and maybe cook for less time for better texture.  Nancy

This recipe is tasty. A great solution to our Granny Smith apple tree over-producing this year. We enjoyed it with a little no sugar added vanilla ice cream a few minutes out of the oven. I skipped the pie crust as others suggested.  This first time was a test for a dinner I'll take it to next week. I used a couple extra eggs and apples too and added a teas. of vanilla to the egg mixture. I also used cinnamon bread from a specialty bakery and made my own applesauce. I might add raisins and or pecans next time. A definite keeper.

Tastes like an apple crisp and bread pudding combo. Very good hot & cold.

Very good. People liked it very much.  It's really good hot.  Don't know how it tastes cold because it went fast!!!
