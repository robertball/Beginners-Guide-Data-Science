This was my first time canning preserves. The recipe seemed simple and straight forward so I prepared the peaches but I questioned the amount of sugar. So I started with only 2 cups of white sugar with the 10 peaches and it's was already too sweet. My wife and I decided it needed more peaches so I added 5 more peaches to the mixture before I had it to the point of not tasteing too sweet. The cinnamon and cloves were just right.

Easy to make & spices make it standout from all others. I did add some ground chipotle pepper to the mix & lowered sugar to 4 cups- I cooked low & slow in crockpot for the 1 1/2 hours Guess what everyone's getting for gifts now?!?!

I used 15-18 peaches cut my sugar to 4 cups. Used the juice of a lemon and half an orange put this in at the start. I cooked down my peaches for an hour could have cooked them further but was anxious to be done. I added 2oz. real fruit pectin and turned off my heat. I put in your reccommended amount of spices but next time I am cutting the clove to one teaspoon. It is a strong spice and took over the flavour. It will be good on ice cream and yoghurt. I am going to try the less spice recipe again today. I bought a lug of peaches from my favourite farmer.

I cut the sugar with in half and added half with stevia sweetener. I loved the taste of how the cinnamon and ground cloves came through. Make sure the peaches are slightly on the ripe side. I wouldn't change a think about this recipe.

This is the first time I have canned anything. I wish I had of read the reveiws before starting this recipe. I mad it as printed however I cooked it a lot longer than the 1.5 hours. It was like soup. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for it to thicken. It seemed to take forever. Once it did get thick it was then too thick. I don't know if this is an error on my part having never canned before or not. As for the taste it is a little too sweet. The spices are great though.

Great taste but way too much sugar.. Added 5 cups and made the pot the consistency of soup.. I think I will start with 2-3 Cups next time.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't let it thicken too much because I wanted more of a topping. The spices are perfect! I think it would make a nice topping for waffles or pancakes.

Very easy to follow. I used my crockpot for the 2hrs to cook. Worked well. Very tasty
