Oh my.  So, I wanted to make extra soup, and decided to make 1.5 recipes instead of 1.  Good thing I didn't double it.  Opened the crock pot to it literally full of rice mush.  Not grains of rice.  Mush.  The flavor is ok but, wow, this is just ridiculous.  There is no liquid left AT ALL.  Just mushy rice.  Maybe wait until the end to add the rice?

Flavor is good, but the cook time makes the rice turn to mush.  I would try cooking it again, but put in the rice towards the end.

I added 1 bay leaf and carrots, and it turned out delicious. I would add 1 extra cup water next time though as it was quite thick.  4 hours on high was enough time.

Made this for a family get together & everyone loved it, even the kids.  I didn't have time to slow cook, so I simmered on the stove.  I took the advice of previous reviews & waited to throw in the rice until the last hour.  Even with that, I still needed to add about 3 additional cups of stock towards the end of cooking as the rice soaks it all up.  As a personal preference, I added 3 sliced carrots & 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Loved the subtle kick the red pepper flakes added.

I made this yesterday,it was snowing in Virginia Beach and this sounded just right for the weather. I followed the receipt for the basics but then added some chopped up bacon, carrots sliced thin, frozen broccoli and squash. It was the best

This was bland, but a good base recipe. Tastier the next day. My rice turned to mush but I did slow cook it for ages.

I wish I had read all the reviews first. Instead, I followed the recipe and ended up with a pot of mushy rice that was inedible. I had to throw it out. :(

Ok base recipe but pretty bland by itself.  I added a cumin, garlic powder, and fajita seasonings and sausage and went ahead and had a cajun soup.  plus added red bell peppers for color contrast.

It's a little too thick.  Next time I will add more chicken broth to make it more of a soup and less of a casserole

Came out great tasting.  I did add more liquid because it was a little thick.

Tasty soup but the rice gets very mushy. I recommend using only wild rice and adding it late in the cooking process.

My husband and I both thought this soup was really good!  I used a blend that was primarily wild rice and brown rice with a few other things mixed in instead of just wild rice and long grain white rice.  The flavor from the rice was excellent.  The soup was quite thick a few hours into cooking so I added an extra can of broth and only cooked it on low for about 6 hours which was plenty.  This will be a great base soup to add extra veggies to as well.

this is a delicious, simple recipe. I would add a little more cracked pepper and some salt and pepper for some added zing. It tastes even better the next day!

really good. I added black-eyed peas for more protein and it complimented well. Next time I'll only do a half can because it was a bit over-powering

I loved the addition of the crushed red pepper, it gave this soup a bit of unexpected kick.  Very good.
