Much better with two (16-oz) cans fruit. I also add some vanilla flavoring and bake at 400 degrees.

This was good. I used apple pie filling instead though. It wasn't the BEST one I have tried but it was quick and easy. Thanks for the post.

Love it. Got it myself from my mother-in-law years ago and misplaced it. Hoped I would find it on here. I use 2 cups of fresh fruit sweetened with a little sugar. Also I think it should say 1 STICK of butter instead of cup. Made it tonight with fresh blueberries. Yum! Thanks!

I used less butter and used apples instead. Added a little cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla too. Love it!!! noticed though the 1st time i made it i didn't see "melted" butter and still came out perfect so i guess it doesn't matter if its melted or not.:)

I always heard this as one "stick" of butter. One cup was just too much.

Waaaaaayyyy too much butter!!! Next time I would use half the butter and not drain the fruit.... Maybe another half a cup of flour and use the other half of the butter to make a nice vanilla icing.

I have few complaints about this recipe. With one cup of butter you will not find this recipe listed on the American Heart Association's website but the flavor is really good. Really good. I think the biggest problem I had making this dessert was that the recipe didn't indicate whether or not the canned fruit should be drained. It should be! An extra 1/2 cup flour and a dash of baking powder fixed it right up! It seemed extremely sweet but that could have been from the liquid from the can of fruit also. It went very well with some vanilla ice cream. I'll be making this again and might even try cutting the butter in half to make my doctor happier.

I found the way the butter was indicated was unusual. Most times it would read, for example, "1 cup butter, melted" instead of "1 cup melted butter." I melted two sticks of butter and it was way too much. Also, it doesn't mention whether to drain the fruit first. I did not because this recipe is very similar to one i had years ago, and i'm not sure but i think that recipe call for undrained fruit. In any event, it did taste quite good. I'm looking forward to making it again, but with less butter!

This is basically the same recipe that my mom made with a few changes. Listed are the differences. 1. Melt the whole stick of butter in the dish in the oven first. 2. Combine the flour, sugar, milk (and 1 tsp vanilla) in a bowl and stir to blend. 3. Pour the batter mix in the dish with the melted butter. 4. Pour canned pie filling right in the middle.  **  I agree that this is a simple but good cobbler and I'm sure there are lots of variations but this is my favorite because it's how Mom made it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
