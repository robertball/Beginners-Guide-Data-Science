This is one of the BEST coffee cakes I have ever made. It is so light, fluffy, and moist. The flavors complement each other so well. It is also very easy to make. Excellent warm or room temp.

I really liked the lemon flavor that came out in this cake, however, it was a bit dry and I would really like even more lemon flavor.  I might try again with a little tweeking.  It was a good cake over-all, and I realize that it is meant to be eaten with coffee, so that would take care of the dryness.

This has a nice light lemon flavor. I made it for Easter brunch and it was well received. Very Good!
