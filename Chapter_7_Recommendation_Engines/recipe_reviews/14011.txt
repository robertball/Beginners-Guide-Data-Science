This was really good. I had a real problem with the poppy seeds sinking to the bottom,so I just sprinkled the seeds over the toast as it cooked. I topped it with lemon curd instead of syrup and I think next time I'll use orange marmalade.Yum.

Worked well for breakfast. I used a little more vanilla and not quite 3 TBLS of poppy seeds. Also, I used up some sliced french bread first before switching to regular bread. I didn't think it tasted incrediably different from regular french toast but it was tasty and kind of pretty. Toothpicks may be needed for this one folks!

This was good.  I added some lemon zest to the batter and made a little lemon butter sauce and raspberry jam.  Very nice.

Very tasty French Toast!  You don't need to use so many poppy seeds, though, to get their flavor.  I used light brown sugar instead of white.

I used whole wheat Bread instead my family isn't big on white bread, were kinda health nuts, well me and my mother but it tasted good! i doubled the vanilla cause it adds more flavour i think :) but a good recipe i think i'll defiantly use this one again the next time i cook ;)

These were good but not as good as I expected. I did like them but not enough to make them again.

This was really good with the crunch from the little poppy seeds and the flavor overall. I used regular sandwich bread. I might try swapping vanilla for lemon or almond extract the next time and play around with this great little recipe. My only problem was that the seeds tended to settle on the bottom of the dish so when dipping the bread it was mostly seedless. It would work out better to sprinkle them on after dipping I would think or else stir them up every dip. Thanks Jessica, I love poppy seed muffins and this gave me the flavor without the wait.

Fairly bland. The vanilla did not help. Did smell good while cooking.

We made it with roasted hemp seeds rather than poppy seeds. Very tasty!

Too bitter/strong poppy for me. I even decreased to 2TBS. My husband liked it. If he wants this again I will only use 1TBS. The poppys didn't have a problem falling to the bottom, I just whisked in between dips. To enjoy this I just had to use a little more syrup to tone down the poppy.
