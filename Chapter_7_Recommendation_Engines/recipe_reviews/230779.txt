Got RAVE reviews with this!! My guests left with the recipe and my boyfriend was still raving about it the next day!Just made a few changes. Used Panko Italian flavored break crumbs for the top. And when I cooked the chicken, I seasoned it with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I did add a little more cheese because I love cheese. Cant wait to make this again!

Made it for my family, they ate almost all of it in one night (we are only four people!) and when I brought my professional chef neighbor over the next day to try it, there was only a single piece left! (He loved it, by the way, and ate the entire slice extremely quickly) Definitely would reccommend to anyone! Don't be fearful of the lack of ratings, you'll regret it- this recipe is perfect.

My family liked this recipe. Simple to make, I did make it in a larger 9x13 pan.

So I tweaked this recipe a little. I thought it could use a vegetable so I added a layer of broccoli over the chicken/ham. It was amazing!  My husband says this is his new favorite dinner! Also used half regular butter and half Challenge roasted garlic and herb butter. Most definitely recommend!

I made this tonight for dinner. It was delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. For some reason mine took longer to cook and I ended up turning on the broiler to brown the top. Everyone in my house loved it.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, that it might be too rich...but the first thing out of my picky hubbie's mouth was "mmm this is good" and for him that's saying a lot. I have 5 little ultimate critics and they mmmed and ooohed the entire meal too! the sauce was delicious almost onion dip like but perfect for the meal and tasted wonderful when I dipped a piece of chicken in it. I boiled my chicken in salted and peppered water until the water disappeared, only light seasoning is needed and I  used a 9 x 13 lasagna dish and found in had enough sauce, but I wouldn't have complained if I had a little more, (though double would've definitely been way too much). I used Ritz crackers on top because I had no bread crumbs, didn't bother covering it in the oven and 20 minutes did perfect, it was good with the browned cheese. It was pretty set out of the oven but if you use more sauce you might need to let it set a few minutes. Thank you so much for this recipe, from my 7 hungry tummies!! I will make this again and again. Goes great with crusty bread and some steamed veggies.

Very tasty! Only a couple changes Id make if I was to make this recipe again. First off there wasnt much sauce and was pretty dry on top so double the sauce when making this also the amount of ham was too much and I only used half of what was called for. It was pretty much a ham lasagna. I would use maybe about 1/4 of the ham called for and maybe about half a cup more chicken. Either way it was good and probably going to make again but with the necessary changes I mentioned.

Made as written but used non-hydrogenated margarine, low fat cream and Swiss cheeses plus whole wheat lasagna noodles to make the recipe healthier. Loose bread crumbs did not appeal to me and if I make this again I will blend with a little margarine to hold them together.  All in all I was pleased with how this turned out; I was able to use up a lot of leftovers in my fridge and it was delicious!

Made this the other night the only thing I changed was I used Italian bread crumbs and I doubled the sauce as I used a bigger pan. Also don't use no bake noodles the noodles didn't get quite done. But everyone still loved it

I made this recipe and really enjoyed it. It tastes just like "traditional" Cordon Bleu. It is rich and filling. I was concerned that there would not be enough of the cheese sauce, but there was just the right amount. I used the "no boil" lasagna. I cooked it for 30 min with foil on it and then another 30 uncovered.

I would give 4 1/2 stars because I really loved the flavor. I was hesitant to make a new recipe for a social gathering, but the guests loved it too.  One suggestion, double the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I made 1 1/2 the sauce but it was still a little dry. It might be because I used oven ready noodles so that may have been the problem. The bottom layer seemed to get a little over done, dark and crunchy but one guest said that was his favorite part.  I used pre cooked shredded chicken o that made it easy. I also added two layers of yellow squash which definitely was a hit. I also added mozzarella on top.

Just take a chance and make this recipe! All the reviews are right in how delicious this is and EVERYONE loved it and had seconds. I did double the sauce bc of others suggesting it since we like plenty of sauce and only other change was I used 1 cup of Italian blend cheese in the cream cheese sauce in addition to the Swiss only bc I ran out, then and topped with 1/2 c of shredded mozzarella and provolone and it worked perfectly. Thank you for this awesome dish!

OMG! I love cordon blu but I hate all the work to stuff the breast. This recipe is great and easier to make in my opinion. My father-in-law was skeptical about it but he was pleasantly surprised (told you so)! Hubby took the rest for lunch the next day and loved it still! Will make many more times!

Mixing the butter and cream cheese, I thought...this is going to be greasy but delicious. However it wasn't nearly as greasy as I thought, but was every bit as delicious! I thought my family might object to a non-traditional lasagna (I've always preferred white sauces to tomato), but it went over really well. Gonna make another pan to deliver to a friend and I'll definitely share the recipe! Not health food by any means, but it will be something good to serve when entertaining and when I get tired of plain ol chicken!

Omg this was amazing. I chose this recipe because I had some leftover honey baked ham and turkey to use up. I made the recipe as written except I used Jarlsburg light Swiss, and I also had a bunch of extra fat-free half and half, so I used that in place of the milk.  Next time I make it, I think I'll do 1.5 times the sauce--I think I could've just eaten the sauce with a spoon it was so good--and I think I'll sauté some mushrooms to put in, too.  I bet caramelized onions would be good, too.  The whole family raved about it--thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  Perfect for a dinner party! The only thing I added was fresh sauteed mushrooms on each layer. I did drain the mushrooms on a paper towel prior to  adding to the lasagna to avoid  any extra liquid.

This was delicious! I made 1 1/2 the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan. When I was making the sauce I thought there was going to be a bunch left but it was the perfect amount! It got rave reviews from my husband & his friend. We love chix cordon bleus and the sauce in this tastes just like the ones we buy! I did use American Swiss instead of plain swiss. This is pretty rich so serve it w/ a side to help break it up. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is absolutely delicious! That sauce is awesome. I did make a few changes but nothing I think altered the taste significantly. Used egg noodles cuz I didn't have lasagna. Added about 2T real bacon crumbled in the sauce. And used Panko bread crumbs with some Parmesan for the topping. So glad I stumbled on this  recipe as it is already a family favorite. Thank you!!!

I was looking for a pasta with a sauce other than red and came upon this.  The first time I made it as is but adding a bit of Asiago cheese.  Also used Panko bread crumbs.  The second time I also layered in broccoli in small pieces and amped up the spices with a bit of garlic powder and smoked paprika.  This was really good both times I made it.  My family loved it. Will save it for special occasions due to the richness of the ingredients (cheese, butter).  Maybe next time I will try a healthier version.

It was a big hit with my family. I used left over ham instead of deli slices. It is a little rich, so I'll be cutting back on the cream cheese/swiss mixture next time.

Omg amaaaazing... I’ve made this 3 times in the last month because my kids can’t get enough. The first time I made it exactly how it is written and it was really good.. the second time I added a tbs of minced garlic when melting the better for the sauce and it was even better. The third time I added the garlic and I used a mix of Swiss and mozzarella for the sauce and then for the bread crumb topping I used 1 C of Italian seasoned panko mixed with 1/2 C of melted butter. I then lightly sprinkled that topping with shredded white cheddar. These slight changes made the best version. I highly recommend using garlic and panko bread crumbs with butter. I also never chopped up the deli ham.. I just layered it on top of the noodles followed by the shredded chicken, followed by spooning the sauce over that and then beginning with noodles again. I also used a rotisserie chicken and the other times cooked my own chicken in the slow cooker, both methods worked well. Use high quality deli ham though, it makes a difference. Overall excellent kid approved recipe at my house!

Incredible but very runny.  I will definitely make it again but will use half of the butter and mill.

My whole family ate it and liked it, which is not a common occurrence, so I am very happy about that. I made a small batch with some frozen veggies on the bottom for myself and really liked it like that. It's a bit rich for regular use, but I will make it again for sure. It would be super quick if you already had some cooked chicken and leftover noodles. It uses a lot of pots and pans if you do it all in one cooking so that and the richness are my reason for not giving it five stars.

Holy WOW! This is amazing! 
I used no boil noodles and doubled the sauce to make sure there was enough liquid to soak into the noodles. 
I baked the chicken breasts. 
Topped with Italian Panko Bread Crumbs.  This is awesome comfort food for a cold day! I will DEFINITELY make this one again!

Great tasting recipe. Needed more sauce, but added extra shredded  cheese on top to make up the difference. It is a keeper!

My family and I loved this recipe.  I did not make any changes.  It took longer than the indicated 20 minute prep time (baking chicken first, grating cheese, etc), but I'm probably slower than the average cook too.

So good. Definitely double the recipe for sauce if using Oven Ready Lasagna if you want it "saucy".    I was unsure of all of the swiss cheese since I'm not a fan of it but everything pairs perfectly.

Great dish! I had leftover chicken from tacos the night prior; I made this dish based on the fact I had the ingredients to pull it off with some alterations to compensate for the items I did not have; worked out well! I used mozzarella cheese and Velveeta. For the noodles I used Fideo noodles. I added a can of cream of celery to the cheese spread compensating for the over amount of chicken I had. I will make this dish again!

This was SO delicious! We didn't have any milk (how is that even possible?) so I used half and half instead. Wow! It was so rich  but SO good. Wouldn't change a thing about it.
