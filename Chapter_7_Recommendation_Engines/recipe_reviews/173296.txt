I used my 9" round cake pan for this.  Instead of pepperoni, I used ham and pineapple.  I found that 1 1/2 cups of cheese was plenty.  I sprinkled Italian seasoning over the cheese before baking.  The directions were perfect, starting with a cold oven and then baking exactly 30 minutes.  Other than playing around with the toppings, the only change I plan to make next time (this weekend!!!) is to coat the dough all over VERY well with olive oil and sprinkle some cornmeal in the bottom of my pan.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use it often for a quick lunch or weekend meal!

This was really good!  My husband and kids loved it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe to make 2 because I didn't know if one would be enough for the four of us.  We ended up with 1/2 of one left over which my husband took for lunch the next day. I only used 1 cup of reduced fat cheese on each one and I used turkey pepperoni to cut back on some fat.  I added 1/2 lb of cooked sausage to each one.  This would be good with any of your favorite pizza toppings.  Next time I'm going to add ham and banana peppers.  The kids are wanting me to fix this again next week!  Yummy!

Easy, attractive and tasty.  Not restaurant quality but it's still pretty good.  I did not have the RapidRise yeast but did have Fleischmann's BreadMachine Yeast which says on the label it's "also ideal for all RapidRise Recipes".  Since this was a Fleichmann's recipe I took their own advice.  I guess it worked.  I didn't have a deep-dish pie plate so I chose to use a 10" springform pan and it worked beautifully.  Since you can take the sides off it made cutting it easier.  Well (olive) oiled hands made spreading the dough into the well oiled pan a breeze.  I chose to mix my dough in a separate bowl. I did find that the crust was a little doughy while the cheese was perfectly brown, next time I'll bake it on the lower middle rack.

My family and I love this recipe.  It's quick and easy.  I use 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 white flour for the dough and I don't add the cheese until about 1/2 way through baking.  Didn't have mozzarella the first time I made this, so I used provolone slices and that was really good! Thanks!

I've made a lot of homemade pizza since my son is such a fanatic. The only drawback is the hour I have to wait for the dough to be ready. This recipe was pretty good and VERY fast! I do suggest adding some seasonings to the dough. It's very plain. Usually I add some garlic bread seasonings (from Costco) to my regular recipe. I added a tablespoon or two when I doubled this recipe and it still tasted bland. I'll add several more next time or maybe some granulated garlic since it's pretty strong and some basil and oregano. Otherwise, the dough worked out very well. I do suggest using olive oil to oil the pans really well so the crust doesn't stick. I did this and it worked like a charm! I also followed the suggestion of adding some cornmeal to each pan. I topped the pizzas with hamburger, onions, mushrooms and ham and with just plain cheese and pepperoni. Both were great. For the speed of this recipe, I highly recommend it.

This recipe was super easy and fast...I had all of the ingredients in the house and within 40 minutes...Dinner! The only thing I changed was instead of pepperoni, I made it with ham. This is an excellent recipe for a family in a hurry!

My husband and son love this. I will double the recipe next time so they aren't fighting over it.  I like it because it's so quick and easy.  My only problem was that the "crust" stuck very badly to the bottom of the casserole dish even after I used the spray grease beforehand on the pan.  Also, I used 1 tsp of yeast from a jar.  The "2 envelopes" looked like a mistake to me.

Very easy and very yummy! I put oregano and garlic powder in the dough to add to the flavor. A lot of people said their crust was mushy so before adding the sauce and toppings,I baked the dough for about 10 mins then added everything and continued to bake. I will definitely make it again!

My husband & I loved this!  It is a very simple recipe that you can do so much to.  I used a larger oven proof skillet, added cheese sticks to the crust edges and loaded it with our favorite toppings.  It was very, very tasty!

FABULOUS Recipe and so delicious, even re-heated the next day for lunch. I have a picky brother who scoffed at the pizza being cooked in one of my lasagna pans but in the end, he ate half of it! The only thing was that it could have used less cheese and more sauce. Good to know for next time :D

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was definitely a DOUGH, not a batter.  Mediocre, at best.

This was pretty good overall.  Pretty simple.  We made our own sauce by using tomato sauce and a few seasonings.  My son picked off all the pepperoni because he doesn't like them.  It was pretty small, but within my diet range because I'm on a low carb diet.

This recipe was GREAT! I was trying to find something to make with ingredients I had in the house during a huge snowstorm- this was perfect. I was worried because I only had fairly bland, generic brand pizza sauce left over from something, so I spiced it up with pressed garlic and about 1/8-1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. For toppings I used canned mushrooms, sliced olives, chopped green pepper, and mozzerella. I was weary that the dough looked a little lumpy (I don't do too much with crusts or breads), but it came out of the oven looking beautiful. My boyfriend came in the kitchen and said WOW!- before and after the meal. Normally he comes in the kitchen, fire extinguisher in hand, thinking I've set something on fire. I will make this again and again!

This was really easy to make and it turned out better than I expected it to. I did as another person suggested and baked the dough for 10 min before adding the toppings. Then baked for 30min. The dough was still a little too wet for my taste. I will definitly be making this again soon!! Next time i'll cook the dough even longer or maybe try a different dough recipe.

My husband gave this 5*.  We made it with whole wheat flour.  I was surprised that the batter actually looked like dough, I think I was expecting it to be pourable.  We will make again.  Super easy.

This recipe was sooo easy.  I have always shied away from anything that uses yeast but this was not difficult in any way.  Next time I will add more ingredients which I am sure it will earn 5 stars then. It also looked pretty coming out of the oven! Thank you for the recipe.

This was allright. Not my favorite recipe on here (by far), but decent for a mediocre Saturday night meal. I must say, preparation couldn't be easier! I too like Tricia Jaeger used my 10 inch springform pan with excellent results (I do not own a deep dish pizza pan; being that I am a Chicagoan, I should tho!!!). My only changes were brushing my pan with EVOO (as opposed to cooking spray) mixed with a bit of garlic powder and a sprinkling of cornmeal to coat. Oh, and I used about 1/4 c. more (generic) pizza sauce than called for (I wanted to use up what I had in the fridge). I did not have Fleischmann's yeast available, so I used the generic store brand rapid rise yeast I had in my pantry (and my local grocer didn't even sell the Fleischmann's packets - all they had were bottles of the stuff). I think this recipe should indicate the size of yeast envelopes to use for that exact reason (but this is a Fleischmann's recipe, after all...). One last thing.... I found that I needed to place my pizza under the broiler to brown the cheese since it wasn't melted to my liking right out of the oven. While this was good (think Chef Boyardee pizza, only deep dish style), it was a tad too soggy/doughy. My fiance agreed. Note: one pizza fed the two of us (we each had two medium-sized slices), so if you are feeding a family of 4 or more, you might want to make more! Served with brownies for dessert, this was an OK meal. Thanks for letting me try this!

Delicious and super easy!  You can add all sorts of toppings.  I toss in extra seasoning and that helps a lot.  It's been a big hit whenever I've served it.

This was a suprisingly simple recipe! It came together in just minutes, and tasted pretty good as well! The only thing that I didn't quite like was the slightly "mushy" texture of the crust. This was not extremely noticeable, but it did keep me from giving this recipe 5 stars. I also didn't use two cups of cheese; 1- 1/2 cups worked just as well! This recipe is so easy to make that I will probably make it again.

Good, the crust was hard to get out of the pan. Maybe I didn't use enough cooking spray?

This was pretty good, but I did not like the no crust idea. It was also very easy to prepare and I have made this several times. I omitted the pepperoni because I am lacto-ovo. I used black olives and banana peppers.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit with my family!  I made 1.5 times the "dough" and used a 9X13 pan which fed my family of 5 perfectly.  This recipe will be a regular on my menu.  Thanks!

Delicious. Instead of using regular boxed pepperoni, I bought fresh Italian salami. It made the dish more meaty but that's what I was going for.

There was nothing wrong with this pizza really, but just not as flavorful as I had hoped for. It WAS super easy to make, and I may try again but change up the flavor a little to get more of a "wow" factor. There wasn't any left, but if you are looking to impress someone...this is probably not it!

This was a really great way to make pizza. My 6 year old son even helped me make it. The crust was the perfect flavor when the sugar was added. We will definately be making this again.

This pizza is okay. It was really easy. Trying to make a quick, but homemade dinner with two little kids running around isn't easy. But with this recipe the kids were able to help - and it cooks up super fast too.  Probably wouldn't make it again. While the ease of this recipe was great, the taste just wasn't there.

Not impressed with the crust/batter.  Very bland and yeasty with poor texture.  There are much better pizzaesque recipes out there.

It was OK.  The dough didn't turn out right for me.  The top turned out great but the bottom didn't cook through so it came out doughy.  But it was very easy and fast to make.

Wow, I truly impressed myself! Yeast and I are NOT good friends. This was soooo easy and it turned out very good. We're not big fans of thick crust on pizza, but that's only our opinion. Will definitely do this one again. The only change I made was to add mushrooms. Thanks for the post!!

I really liked this. Did 1.5x dough amount per another reviewer to fill a 9x13 dish; did not seem like it was enough to fully cover dish. Had to work at stretching it a bit; dough was not firm & smooth like pizza dough, but stretchy and quite sticky/wettish. I add this because I wasn't sure I was doing correctly, and no another reviewer mentioned it (at least in the first few pages of reviews). I also prebaked dough from a cold oven for 10 minutes (this included warm up time for oven). I then added toppings. Put back in oven for 22 minutes, and it came out great! The top of the dough (under toppings) was slightly soggy-ish, but that's to be expected because of the sauce. Thank you for sharing & will definitely be making regularly :)

It was okay. Don't expect the pizza dough that you're used to. Due to the mixing process and proportions that are used here it turns out very cakey. It is, however, very quick and easy to make. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again. Thanks anyway!

This was unbelievably good. I'm shaking my head at some of the negative reviews on this- by the very title, it is not going to be a traditional pizza. Its a bake and it turns out wonderful. The crust is so good its almost like a biscuit. Light, chewy and turns out so fluffy. If you are looking for a pizzaria pizza, this is not it. It is a pizza bake and as such, it lives up to its name. Really, really good. True keeper.

We loved this! For as simple as it was to make, it turned out really well. I opted to mix my dough in a seperate bowl, and then just poured it into my prepared pan (I used a 9-1/2" springform pan), greased my hands w/ a bit of evoo and spread it right out...couldn't have been easier! Along w/ the pepperoni, I also sprinkled in some cook, crumbled hot sausage, and after topping it w/ the cheese, I added some 'spiders' made out of black olives to keep w/ my Halloween theme. This would be great w/ ANY of your favorite pizza toppings. This recipe is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is so easy to make and tastes so good.  I added a little more flour from other reviews (not much) and mixed it in a seperate bowl. I coated the pan with olive oil.  It turned out very good!  Thank you for sharing!

Quick and easy deep dish pizza! Didn't have Rapid Rise yeast, so I used the regular kind and proofed it before I added it to the other ingredients. The flavors were really delicious! Very quick and easy! If you like thick-crust pizza and easy clean-up, this one-dish recipe is for YOU!

Very easy and quite tasty.  I did have to add a little bit more water.  I mixed the batter in a separate bowl, and then poured it into a 9x9 square casserole dish.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and I think it turned out great.  I like that it's a good base recipe and you can play around with the toppings.

My Kids are very picky eaters and I am not much of a cook.  I found this recipe very easy and was to even add pinapple and ham to half of the dish to please everyone.  Thank You so much for this recipe

For the amount of time this took to make (super quick!) this tasted delightful. That is why I give it 5 stars!

This gets 5 stars for being quick, easy, and delicious!  I would definitely make pizza this way again when I am short on time or feeling a little lazy.  :)  I was thrown by the recipe calling for 2 packages of yeast for just 1-1/2 cups of flour, however I followed the recipe as written.  The only thing I did any differently was to add a little black olive and spicy pickled pepper strips to the top of the pizza prior to baking.  Makes a nice deep dish crust and bakes like a pie.  If your yeast handicapped, this won't hurt to make since you don't have to do anything but mix, pat down and place in the oven to bake!

This was very easy and looked pretty using a springform pan (which is all I had). I made two pizzas, one as directed and another adding some seasonings to the dough and veggies to the pizza. We preferred the second pizza with the veggies and seasonings. It had more flavor and more thickness to it which helped with the crust:filling ratio. I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the dough and mushrooms, onions, red and green peppers to the toppings. The crust was somewhat disappointing, even with the extra seasonings.

One of my favorites for an easy and quick  weeknight pizza.  Sometimes add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of my (fed)sourdough starter to give the dough extra flavor.  I use 2 teaspoons Instant yeast instead of the rapid rise and use a 12" cast iron pan.

I never mix it in the pan, what a mess.  Just use a large bowl and save yourself a headache.  

For those having trouble stretching the dough out, if it starts springing back let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes while you get your toppings ready.  This allows the gluten to relax and will make it easier to finish stretching out.

I just didn't trust the step of mixing the crust in the pan. I didn't want it to stick to my black skillet, so I mixed it in a bowl prior to shaping it in the pan. Like others, I put the crust in a cold oven, set the temp (yes, it works), and baked it for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. Next time, I will bake it for 15 minutes. Now, for the changes: I used 1 pkg. of RapidRise Yeast and 2 1/4 tsp. instant yeast. It's what I had. I also sliced up eight 1-oz. mozzarella sticks because that's what I had, but I didn't need 8 and used less. Like others, I think you could easily get by with 1 1/2 cups grated cheese. This really is a very easy pizza to make and tasted ok to me (but I'm not a pizza connoisseur).

Pizza crust was very good.  The only thing I would do differently is to use a bigger pan, maybe a 9x9 square glass pan, so that the crust would be a little thinner.  I think we will make this again and experiment a  bit with it.  Thanks for sharing!

the filling was good, but my crust came out extra thick. I will try again. I think I must have done something wrong :(

I made this and it was delicious.  I did mix the crust ingredients in a separate bowl before adding to the well sprayed pie pan instead of mixing in the cooking pan. As another reviewer suggested, I cooked the crust once smoothed out in the pan for 10 mins before adding the toppings to make sure the crust did not end up doughy.   To please my husband, we also added additional toppings and cut back on the amount of cheese to 1 cup.  It was  delicious and easy, so we will definitely make it again and experiment with all different kinds of toppings.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

This came out astonishingly well. It's not exactly like regular pizza or exactly like deep dish. You can pick up the slices, though, so that's nice. The flavor of the crust itself isn't developed (due to the speed of rising time), I wonder if the texture and flavor might be improved with bread flour and beer? I think I'll try that out sometime. Thanks for sharing!

I would totally make this again. It was so easy and  very good. I didn't have rapid rise yeast- I used regular and it worked beautifully. I wanted to double the recipe but didn't have enough yeast. I made it as another suggested- in a spring form pan. Next time I'll make 2. 
I did have to add a bit more water to the dough. Mine wasn't a batter so to speak. More like a dough.
