Exactly what I was looking for! I've been craving a beer cheese soup like I get at a nearby restaurant and this was simple and perfect. The only thing I changed was using Worcestire (sp?) sauce instead of soy sauce, since I was out. I used 2% milk and it worked great.

This is delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, except that I used vegetable broth instead if chicken (since I'm a vegetarian). Very tasty! My only "complaint", which is not really a complaint, is that I would like  it a bit thicker. When I make this again (and believe me, I will!), I will either use one more potato, or use whole milk or half-and-half, to make it a bit thicker. Excellent recipe; I am going back for a second helping now! *slurp*

I copied this from my husband's cousin Sarah and I am incredibly impressed!   My husband likes some meat in his meal so I added some diced ham after the beer....delicious!!! Served it with garlic toast.

This is the BEST beer cheese soup recipe I've found anywhere. It's simple and delicious. My whole family loves it. I usually make a double batch because it freezes well.

My husband always gets this soup when he goes to a certain restaurant. He said this tasted pretty much the same. He loved it. Since a few people said they didn't like the strong soy sauce flavor. I did half the amount of soy and the other half with Worcestershire sauce.

I have made this twice now.  We LOVE it!  My terribly picky 15 year old will readily eat it.  The directions are easy to follow and accurate. A good friend whom I view as an accomplished cook asked me for this recipe.

This is the worst soup I have ever made.  Take my advice, do not add soy sauce!  Unfortunately it made a lot.

No one in the family liked this too much. It had an odd off taste. Maybe it was the soy sauce. Don't think I will be making this again.

It definitely wasn't bad, easy to make...  but it tasted more like potato soup with a bit of cheese and beer thrown in.
