Great recipe, just not much substance to the sauce. Delicious. Will make again.

I made a whole package of frozen tortellini.  Made the "tomato and basil pasta sauce" from this site.  This had an awesome flavor.  If I don't have to buy canned, I will not.  This was easy and will be made over and over in our house.
