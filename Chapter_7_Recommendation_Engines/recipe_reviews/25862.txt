I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner -- I must admit, it was the best crab casserole that I have ever had.  I did use lump crab meat and would suggest that to anyone making this dish.

Can I give zero stars?  Negative stars?  This was so dissapointing and I hate to say it, but gross.  This must be a hate it or love it kind of recipe.  I relate to the woman who said she had to throw the leftovers away.  We didn't even get that far.  We couldn't even choke it down and I found myself making another meal.  All my husband could taste was egg and mayonaise, and I decreased the amount of mayonaise.  We couldn't taste the stuffing or the crab.  There's another recipe for stuffed halibut that uses stuffing and crab, and it's amazing.  I recommend doing a search and using it instead.

WOW! Served this at a ladies' luncheon and it was a huge hit. "Easy" doesn't begin to describe the simplicity of this one. I used canned crab (claw meat) and Miracle Whip instead of plain mayo to bring out more of the crab mild flavor (which it did). Such an elegant dish--and my teen daughter ate the leftovers!

I love crab in any form or fashion, but this was soooo awesome! I served it for a themed seafood brunch. Everyone really enjoyed this particular casserole. I made a few changes: I used one and a half pounds of crab, 1c mayo and 1/2c Miracle Whip, and tossed in some blanched asparagus spears which added to the color, texture and flavor of the dish. Thanks for a great one Francis.

This is good comfort food.  Rich, satisfying and filling.  Thanks to all of the other reviewers - I made adjustments according to your comments.  I used only 1/4 c. of sherry and 1/2 c. of mayo and 1/2 c. of Miracle Whip.  I baked it at 325 and sprinkled lemon juice over the top at the end.  Broccoli almondine is a good accompianment.

Excellent!  I added a little shrimp to it also.  A huge hit with everyone. Have used it cold on crackers as an appie, too!

This had way too much mayonaise for me & my husband.  Had to throw all the leftovers away.

The 1/2 C sherry is  too much.  I like sherry but it overpowered everything.  Perhaps cut it to 1/8C and go up from there.

This recipe is pretty good. I recommend adding double the eggs called for though. I feel that it needs a little something extra to make it even better though. Perhaps next time I will add a bit of shrimp in the mix as well. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe all that well and it still turned out great. I used yogurt instead of cream, miracle whip instead of mayo, water instead of sherry, and imitation crab. Still loved it.
