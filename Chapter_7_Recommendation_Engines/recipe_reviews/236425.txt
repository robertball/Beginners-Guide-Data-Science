Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of baking in an 8”x4” loaf pan (there’s not enough meat for a 9”x5”) and roasting the peppers on the grill instead of broiling in the oven.  It did take about 1 hr 15-20 min to reach a temp of 160, but I’m sure that’s because it was cooked in a smaller pan making it a little taller.  In the future, think I'll try baking @ 375, instead of 350 and, hopefully, shorten the baking time.  I do agree with one of the reviewers that the slices tended to fall apart, so I would use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs next time (used Panko) which should correct this issue.  It does seem like a lot of poblano peppers, but don’t cut the number back because they’re a really important part of this recipe.  Loved the combination of poblanos, dates, goat cheese, and the BBQ sauce.  Served with dijon roasted potatoes, sauteed green beans, and sliced tomatoes. Tera_J, this is certainly is an outside-the-box meatloaf, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!

VERY Delicious but too moist. Very soft, broke in half moving it in pan. I will adjust the moistness and make it agaon, however, as the flavor is great.

Fantastic!  I made this with ground turkey which I think made the other flavors even more pronounced.  I thought 5 poblano peppers would be too much so I used 4 but I should have used the 5.  It is very flavorful but not spicy.  It freezes beautifully.
