This tasted really great and the family liked it, but I had the same problem I always have with roasting chicken - the clean-up in the oven!!! No amount of foil tenting, various roasting pans or any other contraption I come up with makes much difference.  Tastes great, but I probably won't make again for that reason.

I followed the recipe exactly and yet my chicken wasn't even close to being ready in the amount of time given.  We had to cut it apart and continue cooking it, then broiling to get the skin brown.

Excellent flavor! My chickens were quite a bit larger than 2.5 lbs (closer to 5 per, I think), so I had to cook them quite a bit longer than instructed, and at a lower temperature so I didn't kill the outside before the inside was ready - probably about 90 minutes at 350. This is also a great recipe for leftover chicken to use in other recipes, as the flavors aren't too strong or distinctive to blend well with other things. Thanks!

This is a great recipe for a standard roast chicken - the herbs and lemon really standout. The only caution I have for cooks is to make sure you use a larger bird. I made this with a small bird and whiel the meat wasn't done until the directions, the bird came out fairly dry. If you are going to do a small bird, make sure to tent the bird with foil and baste to keep it moister. This is what I should have done, and will do the next time I use this recipe.

This was very good. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I altered the recipe a bit. I did stuff the cavity with lemons ( I cut them in quarters), shallots and onion. I did also stuff some thyme twig and all in the cavity. The changes I made were I chopped shallots, onion, and tore off the thyme leaves and stuffed this under the skin with a few lemon slices. Then I olive oiled the outside and added plenty of garlic and onion powder. During baking I basted. Very flavorful and the shallots and onions under the skin cooked so it was soft and sweet to eat. The lemon slices from the skin I didn't eat.

I'm not a great cook, so I wasn't sure how this would go.  But it worked great!  I had a pack of 5 chicken thighs with skin and bones.  I ended up slicing up a lemon and putting each thigh on a lemon slice and tucking a sprig or two of thyme under the skin on top.  I sprinkled about 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and a quatered onion around the chicken.  I didn't have shallots, so I just omitted them.  

I kept checking the chicken until it looked done (maybe 20 min) and while it was resting I reduced the liquid into a sauce (after spooning off the excess oily)

Next time I'll try a whole chicken and see if the lemon is more pronounced.

Great taste.  We don't use butter and the chicken was fine without it.  Didn't know what was meant by "line with thyme sprigs" so I tucked some under the skin and put more inside with the lemon.

I used dried thyme instead of fresh, and I know it made a huge difference. Instead of bursting with flavor, the chicken was so mild I used the leftovers in a Mexican dish the next evening. I'll definitely make this again with fresh thyme!

I also love seasoning roasted chicken with thyme!  It pairs so naturally with chicken.  Followed recipe except I used a nearly 6-lb. chicken so I roasted at 375 for close to two hours, and I quartered the lemons that were stuffed into the cavity.  Chicken came out moist and flavorful.

I followed the recipe to a T the first time making it - and it earned a 4 star from me and my roommate. i've since made this about 5 or 6 times, and now I just wing it - nothing is measured - and it always comes out delicious. I took Barb's advice and stuffed the mixture under the skin as well. Delish!

I made one chicken and I did add a couple more spices, like paprika and rosemary. I know of no chicken that cooks in a half hour. Maybe my oven is slow, mine was done in almost two hours. That aside, this was a moist and flavorful chicken that my family darn near inhaled. I loved how simple it was and how it really didn't need too much babysitting. This recipe was a winner, as most chickens cooked with citrus in the cavity are.

Great roast chicken recipe.  I had an extra half-lemon in my fridge, so I sliced it up and stuffed it under the skin along with the thyme, which infused it with a wonderful lemon taste.

I made it but I made a grave mistake I advise you all against, I cut a lemon and put the cut pieces with the rest of the vegetables and it made the taste of the vegetable very sour-not in a good way- so dont do it other than that it was really good.

All the veggies burnt 15 min before it was done. Chicken absorbed the smoke flavour and was too bitter to be any good.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone lived it! I cooked mine breast down so the brass wouldn't be dry (past issue) which I don't think was needed, caused the beat to be a bit more lemony, still delicious.  They have already asked for it again.

Delicious. Made this with a large roaster chicken and adjusted the time, but it came out beautifully and scrumptious! Easy to make and pays off with big flavor.

Very bland for our tastes. But very juicy. Was able to use chicken in other dishes without altering flavors of them. A good basic recipe.

Very delicious!  I used one large chicken and roasted it at 350 for about an hour and 45 minutes, it was perfectly juicy.  I added potatoes and put the onion in the cavity.  I also put some thyme under the skin.  Yummy!
