I was just browsing in the Mexican section and found this recipe.  I am Mexican and yes, as another reviewer suggested, lard is the best way to make them for "authentic" taste, but honestly, who needs all that fat???  In the beginning my mother used to make them with Lard, but since my dad found out his cholesterol level was so high, my mom started to make them with shortening.  I have also always made them with shortening and I cannot imagine now having them any other way.  This is a great recipe and a suggestion to you all: try the butter flavored shortening, it makes them taste great!  For a great alternative, you can substitute sugar and cinnamon for the salt, makes healthier type of bunelos!  Oh and for those reviewers that say these were too tough, you have to realize that you have to use extremely hot water, as hot as your hands can handle.  I hope this helps!

I wanted to address the issue of the Tortillas going hard after being made.  Being from Mexico, I've never seen a woman making toritillas without having a Kitchen towel folded over and stacking the tortillas inbetween as they are comming off the griddle or comal. Infact my mother will go a step further and place a Kitchen towel (folded in half) into a gallon sized ziplock bag, this all in the effort to keep the tortillas pliable/soft.  Once you are all through making your taco's, burritos, etc, you can take the towel out of the bag and store the tortillas in the bag, in your fridge.  Whenever you need one or two, reheat on a hot griddle pan turning as necessary and they become pliable once again.  Tortillas are like bread, you leave them out in the open, they get hard.  Another thing that will make them hard is leaving them unattended on the griddle too long, the moisture is wisked out and not suitable for tacos, burritos, or anything.  I hope this additional step keeps the rating for this recipe high, as it really is no different (except for lard), than my Mexican mother makes.

Some people must think that 'authentic' means tastes like store bought. It does not. Last summer while my husband and I were in Old Town San Diego we bought tortillas from a lovely Hispanic woman who was cooking on an outdoor griddle in front of a restaurant. These tortillas tast exactly like the ones we had!(except she used lard) I did change a couple things. I used 3 T. shortning and 2 butter. I used 1&1/2 t.salt and it was just right. The water I used was just under boiling. I have a Kitchen Aid and I added the water slowly as the mixer worked. The dough was perfect and a snap to roll out. Actually I rolled them paper thin and they puffed up perfect. 30 seconds on each side. After mixing the dough I divided it up into golf ball sized rounds THEN let it rest under a damp towel for an hour. That way you don't compress the dough making the rounds after the dough rests. Very easy to roll. If your tortillas are hard and crumbly you're cooking them too long or the dough is too dry. They are supposed to be soft with brown bubbles. This was so simple and so 'authentic' I will never buy another pack of store tortillas! Thank you Jamie!5++++++

Ok, i understand all the reviews now about it being more flaky like a pie crust. I used another recipe similar to this,and the same thing happened. I think the error was in how thin we rolled it out. My husband gave me a tip, hes mexican and has seen his mom make it plenty of times, and said NOT to roll it out super thin. If it has more thickness, it becomes more pliable and not so flaky. ALSO, make sure your pan is on medium -high heat. if not, it cooks too slow, making the tortilla cook through too hard. Ill try it next time, and see if that makes a difference! As for the taste, it was wonderful!! Practice makes perfect!

I love this recipe but I changed the ingredients up to make a healthier, vegan version.  I used whole wheat flour, and instead of shortening I used grape seed oil.  The results were awesome!  My husband and son ate most of them as I was making them and I had to make more for dinner.  Canola oil would work just fine instead of the grape seed oil.  Thanks for the recipe, as a vegan it is nice to have a simple, quick recipe for an old comfort food.

Everyone! When I first submitted my recipe, like almost 20 years ago, I did it for a computer class in college and had to hurry up and finish it without really giving it much thought. SO - just change the ingredients like this and they will be awesome!!  3 Cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp. salt, 1/3 cup shortening/lard, and 1 1/4 cup HOT water.  PERFECT!!

I liked the recipe. It reminded me of my grandmas. The only things I had to change to make them like hers was to use 3T. Margarine and 1 tsp. salt. once I did that everything was great!! Thanks!

I should've read the reviews!  This is not a very good recipe.  Too salty.  Too tough.  Too much of my time spent on this project only to throw everything in the trash.  I grew up eating homemade tortilla and was excited to see a rather highly rated recipe here.  Don't be misled.  This is not the authentic recipe you are looking for.

Very easy to make and taste pretty good a little floury.  They however they do not store well they fell apart when I went to reheat and just weren't as good.

I used my Cuisinart Food Processor to mix the dough. I used 3 3/4 cups of flour, 2 tsps. of baking powder, 1 tsp. of salt, 1/3 cup of Crisco Shortening, and after pulsing 6  times, added 1 1/3 cups of HOT WATER.  Pulsed until it came into a ball.  Took out of processor and kneaded about 5 times. Let rest for about 10-15 minutes.  Made into 13 balls and rolled each one out. Put on cast iron griddle (comal)  for about 15 seconds and flipped on other side to cook. Flipped again and removed from griddle (comal) and placed in paper toweled tortilla warmer.  They came out perfect. This is my go to recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing.  I used to  make them all the time, but had no measurements. Just used my hand to measured all out.  ( This is how I was taught as a young girl).  And my flour tortillas were great then and delicious.  Now I have the perfect recipe to use in the food processor.  Thank you for the recipe.  NOTE**** You can also use this same recipe to make sopapillas, or buenelos.  Instead of placing raw tortilla on hot griddle,  first you must use fork tines on rolled out raw tortilla, then place in about 1 inch or so of  hot oil, keep an eye on tortilla, it will start to bubble, then flip over tortilla carefully and cook another few seconds to light golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  You may then put cinnamon and sugar mixture on top.  Very delicious.  Enjoy.

One word:WOW! I can't believe that this recipe was so easy and produced such great results! Here's what I did : I used 1 and a half cups of flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, a quarter cup of butter, and a half a cup boiling water. I got six tortillas out of the batch, and each one tasted delicious! I am so amazed. I wanted to do a tortilla roll up recipe on this site but found that all I had were stale tortillas, so I tried this recipe. I am in total shock about how easy and fast it was to make these. They are delicious! Thank you!

I followed this recipe as the instructions stated. The tortillas came out very thick and hard. Did not fluff up as they should. I would suggest allot less baking powder and oil works just as good as shortening.

Please don't waste your time making these "tortillas". I've made tortillas many times before and these were yucky. I threw the whole thing away.

The first time I made them as per the recipe and found them to be a bit too salty and crumbly. The second time around I used only 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup +1-2 TB hot water with perfect results. I don't think ready  made tortillas can match these in any way. Thanks a lot to the poster for the recipe and to the reviewers for their valuable tips.

This is a very good recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars due to the amount of modification it needed.  I cut the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  I cut the shortening to 1/2 cup.  I microwaved the water about 2 minutes on high to get it really hot.  I think the heat helps the shortening blend better.  I rolled the dough into balls and let it rest in the bowl with a paper plate on top for 15 minutes.  Mainly because that was the length of time it took me to get the rolling area ready and the cast iron skillet hot enough.  I heated the skillet on high until a drop of water evaporated on it, then turned it down to medium heat.  I rolled the dough balls out using a wooden rolling pin, trying to manipulate the dough as little as possible.  By the time it took me to roll out a ball, the one on the skillet was ready to turn (about 30-45 seconds, not 1-2 minutes).  I put the cooked tortillas inside a folded towell inside a gallon zip loc bag.  This holds in the heat as well as the moisture.  I think this step is important as some others had trouble with the tortillas drying out.  The smell of the cooking tortillas was great.  It was all I could do not to butter and eat them hot as they came off the skillet!  I did eat the last one that way and it tasted like a little Mexican abuelita had made it.  So if you've had trouble making tortillas, give it another try.  It's an art form, like flaky pie crust.  And for those who thought this recipe turned out pie dough, I'm not sure what type of pies they're us

I have been looking for a good tortilla recipe for close to 10 years and now I finally have one!  These are soft and easy to make.  For the water, The hotter the better and it was so simple using my Kitchen Aide.   It took less than 5 minutes initially, and then the hour rest time.  Rolling them took the most time (I'm hopelessly slow), but even that was only 15 minutes!  Oh, and the cost comparison?  About fifty cents as opposed to the $2 or $3 at the store!! ~high five~

I substituted Smart Balance spread for the shortening (no hydrogenation) and used a food processor to put it all together.  First the dry ingredients went in, then cut in the Smart Balance by pulsing, then added the water little by little.  Once it was wet, I ran it until it was doughy.  Easy!

My kids are totally hooked on store-bought tortillas so I thought they might object to my irregularly shaped and relatively thicker tortillas, but they loved them.  My 7-year-old requested I made them "every day".

I did not find them to be too salty at all, or tough.  I kept them on a warmed plate with an ever-so-slightly dampened dish towel on top as I made them and they stayed nice and hot through dinner.  I didn't need to cook them more than maybe 40 seconds per side to get some nice golden spots all over.

These are not like your store-bough tortillas, at least mine turned out thicker (maybe like the thickness of a "gordita" style tortilla).  I did not let them rest before cooking them; I don't know if this makes a difference.  But I like that these have five simple ingredients; no preservatives or anything weird like that.



I'm thinking about turning on my oven and slightly toasting the leftovers brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for my own secret dessert.  Don't tell.

If you are trying to make tortillas in a large batch to reheat through out the week do not cook them all the way through, just leave them on the heat breifly enough to warm them and put them in a plastic storage bag. Cool completely before putting them in the refridgerator if you are going to keep them more than a few days. When you are ready to eat them cook them the rest of the way in a heated ungreased pan until they bubble or fluff up, though not all tortillas fluff up like they should. 
You should also follow all the advice from the reviews about the shorteing and butter and VERY hot water. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Tortillas II is very good.

We just finished dinner and I had to jump on the computer to review these tortillas!  They were soooooo good!  They don't taste anything like the cheap-o store shelf types, rather they taste a lot like the ones from the Don Pablo's restaurants.  I followed the recommendations from Flashsmith's review (3T shortening, 2T butter, 1 1/2 tsp salt.  Rolled into golf-sized balls prior to the hour rest).  I had a little trouble with my dough initially, actually I kept needing to add more very hot water (probably another 1/3 cup) but eventually it turned out very well.  This was an awesome recipe, Thank you!!!!  I've never made tortillas before, and now I'll never buy the store shelf ones again.

These came out tasting like baking powder!  I called my Mexican mother-in-law and she told me to use only a pinch of baking powder and a pinch of salt.  Also alittle more shortening (about a half cup to each cup of flour).  She said the dough doesn't need to rest either.  Make sure to roll out almost to the point of breakage (paper thin),they should be rolled out a bit oversized as they will shrink when cooked.  They only need about 30 secs. each side then place in a large ziplock and reheat another 30 sec. when ready to eat.  These were so authentic! Not the healthiest but a good change from store bought!

This recipe is just ok, way too much shortening, I have made these before with just 2 tablesp. of shortening per cup of flour. Comes out much better and healthier.

There is way too much shortening in these.  Makes them come out tough and taste bad.

Okay, now this isn't my first rodeo nor my first homemade tortilla. These were NOT flour tortillas, they were pretty much pie crust in a tortilla disguise. These were very flaky, and crumbled when I tried to fold them. Tasted salty and like pie crust, we all agreed on that. Sorry for the bad rating, but I know a good tortilla when I eat one, this just wasn't it. Thanks anyway.

Awesome!  This is my third flour tortilla recipe to try from allrecipes.  These are miles ahead of the others.  First, I used butter instead of shortening due to trans fats.  Second, before I let the dough rest, I separated into golf ball size rounds then let rest.  My only issue is that if you want to make burrito size tortillas, golf ball size isn't large enough.  After resting, I rolled out the tortilla paper thin and they were so easy to roll.  Other recipes on this site were tough to roll out but this one was so easy.  I then cooked them in a nonstick skillet on very high heat for not even 30 sec/side.  My neighbors tried them and kept asking for more!  The best, thanks!

These are excellent!  A great tip for those who felt their tortillas were too hard/ tough-  after you cook them, lay them into a gallon size freezer bag, and fold the top over-for just a minute or two.  It traps the heat, and softens the tortillas-I do not layer them with wax/parchment paper-just stack them on top of each other.  I do this with all my tortillas and with all my homemade breads to give them a softer, more flexible texture for wraps, sandwiches.  Works great! I do keep them in the fridge because of the moisture and no preservatives, just to be sure they don't have a chance to mold.

These tasted great but need an extra step.  Freshly made tortillas should be placed in a tortilla keeper or similar enclosed space immediately from the skillet.  This allows them to steam a bit and makes them softer.  (I also used my food processor to mix the ingredients to make the flour & shortening really crumbly.)

The taste of these tortillas really wasn't too bad but the just weren't really tortialls.  They were really flakie and pastry like.  After we cooked them we tried to roll them up into burritos and they just fell apart. They weren't soft like other tortiallas I have had. I wouldn't use this recipe agian.

i am russian and i don't have any experience making tortillas, but these turned out great. i never knew that tortillas can taste this good! the dough was really easy to roll out, probably because i used boiling hot water. also, i think 1-2 min is a little too long, i flipped them before the air bubbles got too big, which is about 30-40 seconds.

I've made this recipe twice now -- once exactly as the directions specified, and once where I substituted 1/4 cup of the shortening for sunflower oil and didn't allow the dough to cool before rolling it out.  While it tasted great both times, the consistency and ease of making the tortillas vastly improved with the veggie oil substitution.  Overall, a great basic recipe.  These are definitely becoming a staple in my house!

The version I got from homesicktexan is great: 2c flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp veg oil (NEVER use veg oil)--I use coconut oil, palm oil. or lard--melted in 3/4 c of very hot milk. Mix all together and make it into a ball.  Let rest, covered 20 min. Make into 8 balls, let rest, covered 10 min. Roll 2x's & turn 1/4 turn, over, and over, until it is the size you want.  30 sec. on very hot comal or iron pan (preferably), flip & heat 15 sec. max on second side.   YUMMY!

The first time I made this, it turned out horrible. Too salty, and I didn't let it rest. Not letting the dough rest is NOT an option!! Wait at least an hour, then it'll be the right consistency. Otherwise you'll have a lump of greasy dough that refuses to be rolled out.  Once the dough has rested, roll out into very thin tortillas the size of the pan you'll be using. Fold a kitchen towel in half and stack the cooked tortillas inside it. This will keep them pliable and soft. Once you're done either eat right away or store in the fridge. Since the tortillas get hard in the fridge, heat gently in the pan just until soft again. It's important to use VERY hot water for the dough as well. Making a perfect tortilla takes practice, so be patient! This is a great authentic recipe and as far as the salt goes, I use 1 tsp, but that's just personal preference.

This is a good recipe. I was looking for a recipe to give my daughter because I never measure when I make mine. I am Mexican and my mother made them with olive oil instead of lard to make them healthy. It makes them taste good too. I also don't use as much baking powder.

I have had "authentic Mexican tortillas" before, made at Mama Luna's house for a huge cookout. She making them while the men were outside grilling. Whatever it is that this recipe makes, it's not tortillas. It really does taste like fried pie dough. Even the dough looks like pie dough, not soft the way it's supposed to. I didn't even make it all. I will never make this again! If you want a recipe for tortillas, keep looking. This isn't it.

I bought an antique Tortilla press and used this recipe!  They tasted just like the ones we had in Mexico!!  You can refrigerate leftovers (uncooked but pressed out) bring to room temp and cook.

Wonderful! I had never made tortillas before, but these are fun, easy, and taste a whole lot better than the ones you'll find in the grocery store. I substituted the shortening with a mixture of butter and olive oil and they turned out fantastic. Next time I will try adding some whole wheat flour for health's sake :).

This is a pretty decent recipe. I give it a five for versatility. You can use whole wheat flour and if you roll it thicker it's just like expensive flat breads you can buy at the supermarket. I did however, use tub margarine. Anyway, these are excellent because they are so fresh!

I did not care for these. They were pretty salty and way too much shortening; I have it stuck to the roof of my mouth, yuck. They were very crumbly too, I couldn't flip them without them falling apart.

super easy, and really good.  i used butter instead of shortening (i mean, if you're going to use saturated fat, why not go with what nature will provide you with?), and they turned out great.
so much better than store-bought.

This recipe works great! I used whole wheat flour, vegetable shortening and near-boiling water, and it made delicious tortillas. I will bookmark this for future use.

this is a good recipe, but no matter how thin I rolled the dough, the cakes puffed up a little more than I like. I watched them like I hawk on the griddle, only letting them brown for about 30 seconds each.  Modifications:  I reduced the baking powder to 1/2 tsp, and added a Tbsp of shortening.  I think I'll try omitting the BP all together next time since this does make the dough a little heavier.  All in all, the tortillas pleased my family, and they were very easy to prepare!

These tortillas where "ok" they tasted more like pie crust then a real authentic tortilla, and I live 10 minuets from the mexican border in san diego, so I know how a real authentic tortilla is supposed to taste...My family did enjoy them though, and they where easy and fun to make!

These are not authentic at all!  Like other reviews said, it tastes a lot like a pie crust and are a bit on the non-pliable side-even when heated over the flame of the stove.  I went and read Jamie's (recipe submitter) DRASTIC changes to this recipe since she said the original recipe submission wasnt given much thought as far as the measurements go, with the 1/3 C. of shortening she says to use instead of 3/4 C., they tasted like pie crust and I cant imagine 3/4 C. shortening being any better.  Normally I dont give low reviews but I was really disappointed with this one. It's gets a star for effort, but my search continues.

I am not Mexican, but when we don't have flour tortillas, and can't get to the store, these are wonderful!!! We made a discovery with this recipe. If you roll out a tortilla and fry it in oil instead of on a dry skillet, you have sopapillas and they are so good with cinnamon sugar or dipped in chocolate or strawberry sauce!! Try it. You'll love it!

Thanks!  I substituted 2/3 the flour for whole wheat flour.  Tortillas are a bit tricky, I made this recipe 3-4 times before I got it right.  Completely worth it!

These are great!  It took some practice to get it right, but it was well worth the time.  They get better each time I make them.  I use near boiling water and mix it up in the stand mixer.

I did not like this recipe at all I personally think it calls for tooooo much shortening.  I followed this recipe to a "T" and they came out horrible.  I'll stick with mi abuelita's recipe.

These were easy to make, but reminded me of biscuits.  With that, the kids loved the biscuit taste.  I would recommend cutting the salt down to 1/2 tsp as the tortillas were a bit salty.

This recipe is very good for pie crust (I actually used it to make apple pie after trying it for the tortillas three of four times).
These tortillas come out much too stiff, and they are not the texture they should be.  It has nothing to do with the thickness, I have made thick and thin tortillas with my grandmothers recipe and they were perfectly pliable.  
I suspect it has something to do with all the shortening.  I have sucessfully made tortillas using a different recipe since, and I only used a tablespoon.

Shortening amount is excessive for an "authentic" tortilla.  My family emjoys Mexican fillings wrapped in a tasty tortilla, not pie pastry.

I found this recipe when I couldn't find my old stand by, and I think I prefer this one.

The visual cues were helpful.  I did end up added a bit more shortening, and didn't put quite the whole volume of water in.

The consistency of the dough was just right to roll, without it trying to spring back on me.

The key to cooking these is not letting them cook for too long.  My first couple were very brittle.  After reading some of the reviews I noted the hint that over cooking can have this effect. (Because you cook too much of the water out.)  I tried again with the rest of the dough, and they turned out fantastically.

May try adding a bit more salt next time.

Turned out great.. I knew it would be more flaky and taste fresh compared to store bought.. 1 tip if I may, I used a small saucer to cut into perfect round shapes . Made it alot easier for me anyways... Good eating!!!

Too much salt! Should use apprx 1 teaspoon instead of 2...to make it AUTHENTIC use LARD (like Morrel's) NOT shortening or oil....shortening or oil will make Tortilla hard and cracky.

I grew up watching my mom and grandmother make tortillas. Same ingrediants and no receipe. I must say these are extremely salty, uneasy to roll out and flakey.

I can say that these LOOKED pretty and I was happy with the results until I ate them. Followed the recipe exactly. These tasted too much like pie crusts.  They either have too much flour in this recipe or too much shortening. Kept them warm with a towel in a zip lock bag and they were still tough and dry.

Amazing recipe!! However I would note that in order to get them extremely soft and pliable, use pre-creamed shortening.  Using anything but will be opposite.

I don't see why people are making a fuss over these! they are so good! I mean nothing compares to the real thing but they are really tasty and easy to make! I used 1 1/2tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of salt but used all the shortening and all of the water and they came out so good! who ever didnt like these must have done something wrong

These are not very authentic.  As written they taste more like salty pie crust, there is simply too much shortening.  Other recipes with a cup or more flour use less then half the shortening (but more water).  On the plus side, they were very easy to roll out.  But there are better options available.

Good. A bit pasty, I'll experiment with some other options, but this is a good start. My tortillas got better as I went along because I learned  1) don't roll out super thin 2) dont' try to cook them so they are brown and toasted looking- just until they get started looking a bit golden (cooking too long dries them out) 3) instead of covering them with a dishtowel, allow each tortilla to briefly cool on a plate before placing in a ziploc bag containing a moist paper towel (you will melt the plastic if you put them directly in off the griddle). I used lard.

My grandmother made tortillas everyday, she never added baking powder, that ingredient can be omitted, will also help in keeping them pliable longer. She also used 1 tbs of lard per cup of flour (I use shortening).

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time exactly as written- they were very flaky and would not stay together once you tried to use them.  Obviously to much shortening.  I then tried as another reviewer wrote and used 2T fat per cup of flour.  They were much better, but still not right.  Still a little flaky.  I used boiling water, mixed with fork like pie crust then used my hands and found them very easy to make.  They did puff as I cooked them once I made thinner ones.  I made several dfferent thicknesses - starting with 1/8 inch- Too thick.  1/16 or even thinner worked very well and not difficult to roll out in a circle and transfer to the skillert.    I will look for the other recipe referred to in one of the other reviews, or just keep reducing the fat until its right.

I've made these about half a dozen times now. I use the KitchenAid® to mix the dough and follow the recipe exactly - with one exception, I use near boiling water. Perfect every time.  Place into zip lock bag when they are warm to keep moist and pliable.

pretty good,.. here's a tip though. I followed the suggustions about reducing the salt,and used really hot (in the microwave) water, and divided dough into golf ball sized balls. Then cover and let rest for an hour under a damp towel. Another thing is I only rolled out two tortillas at a time while i was cooking them. if you try to roll them all out, then cook them out, they will dry out! roll them out thin, too thick and they will be more like pancakes. Oh, be sure that your comal or pan that you cook them on is not too hot, or they will cook to fast and not puff up. I used med/low heat. As you cook them, be sure and place them inside/under a kitchen towel. This helps them stay soft, and keeps them warm. Remember that tortillas take time and practice to master, and i think that this should be considered an art, but my kids enjoy guessing what the shape of their tortillas are. This seemed like a good recipe, and i will continue to make them. This is an authentic recipe though, so if your looking for a store bought taste, just buy them.

Wow!!!  They literally melted in my mouth!  I have definitely found myself a new tortilla recipe!  I did change it a little bit by using 3 TBS Shortening, 2 TBS Butter, and 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of salt.  The water was VERY hot that I used, and for once in my life I decided to be semi-patient and let them rest for 45 minutes after I had separated them into little balls.  Definitely the best recipe I have ever used for tortillas.  If I could give you 6 or 7 stars I would!

Holy stinkin' cow!  These were so good!  I did have to add more water, and next time I'll only let them sit about 15 minutes.  The dough got a little crunchy on top from sitting so long, even with the dish towel.  And it took more kneading than I thought, but these came out very yummy.  I will definitely have to try again with the things I learned from my first try.  I am afraid that I can't roll out a good circle to save my life, but who knows.  Maybe I will someday. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

We had a live in housekeeper that used to make the most delicious tortillas and this is very close to what she would make. She did use lard so these are a tad different. These are so so good. Thanks!

My ethnic background is Mexican and many times I tried to learn how to make flour tortillas from my mother.  But she couldn't tell me the exact proportions to every ingredient.  So in the end my flour tortillas would never turn out the right.  I tried this recipe one time and I made a perfect flour tortilla!

The truth be told that authentic
tortillas are made with "manteca"- ( that's lard in 
English.) You can make a passable version of tortillas
 using shortening but for a truly authentic and delicious flavor you must use lard. Therefore, this recipe was okay but if you
were to substitute lard for the shortening (lessening the amount of course) then I guarantee you will not taste anything better in this world.

I was glad to find a way to make tortillas homemade, but these were too salty, and perhaps I need more practice, but they were too stiff and didn't wrap very well.

I made this with the dough cycle (stopping it after 10 minutes or so) on my breadmaker.  These tortillas reminded me of flat biscuits, they were so yummy!  I'm glad I lost my other tortilla recipe.  I'm going to try putting some garlic in the dough next time, or maybe water from cooked spinach to make them green and add vitamins!

The alleged tortillas come out tasting like pastry shells and get super hard 15 minutes after cooking them. I have never made a tortilla recipe using shortening and never will again. Find a recipe without shortening and use one with milk. You'll thank me!

This is a review based on my first time using this recipe. I actually found that there was a little too much shortening in the recipe and next time I will use a little less shortening and a little more water. The flavor was good, tasted very similar to tortillas I tasted made fresh by a Mexican woman I know. I am going to try variations with ingredients that are keyed more to my dietary needs, but for a basic tortilla recipe, this is spot-on!

Why did I ever buy them at the store?  These things are so simple, fast and easy I will never buy again!  I just leave the dough wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge and cut off what I need, roll it into a ball, roll in out and whamo.  I have one with dinner every night and just love em!  Thanks a ton!

I followed directions exactly as written. I rate taste at 4 stars however, they were hard to work with.  After cooking for 30 seconds each side (after 1 minute didn't work), they did dry out and would not fold as a burrito should.  We ate them with a fork but they were very good.

This recipe was okay but too salty.  I added cheese to make a quesadilla for my daughter and it was almost too salty to eat.  Alone, the tortilla tastes good but it is missing something.  I wish I knew what that was.  I won't likely make these again.

I made these tortillias and they turned out great.  I used shortning for cooking my tortillias.  I read the reviews after I made the tortillias.  I used a plate to set my tortillias.  They remained soft.  I let them sit on the stove for a few hours.  Now that I now that they could harden if I leave them out, I will be very cautious about leaving them out.  This is a very good tortillia recipe.

Good, easy recipe! As a little girl, I watched my mom make tortillas time and time again, but she didn't use measuring cups or spoons, only her loving hands :) I tried, but could never master the right amounts and my tortillas would come out hard. I followed this recipe exactly and used water that was just on the brink of boiling, I don't think the shortening would have melted properly had I used hot tap water. Finally I can make my own tortillas, and my family loved them!

These leave a powdery texture in your mouth.  They are bland and this recipie is almost exactly like my pasta recipie.  If I tried again I would leave out the baking powder.  Tortillas are supposed to be thin, I don't think leavening is necessary.  Mine were as thick as a cracker no matter how hard I rolled them out.  Halfway through I stopped and added more shortening so they would be easier to work with and that helped a little but they still were not as good as I was hoping for.  As a woman who married into a hispanic family this will never fly in my household.

I tried this recipe and another listed on this site for tortillas and could not get either to produce suitable results. Each recipe had differing amounts of shortening but I got the same results after preparing both. I feel as if it is not the recipe, but possibly the technique involved. I am not sure what consistency the dough should be after adding the water. It also seemed like the more i kneaded the dough, the tougher it became. I feel that those of us who have had bad luck with the recipe would benefit from a more in-depth description of the steps.

I made this according to the recipe and how other review advised on keeping the tortillas soft. But mine still became stiff and hard. So instead of Baking powder, I substituted 2 tsp of active dry yeast and followed the rest of the recipe as is, which did the trick. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my first time making tortillas and these turned out really well. I used freshly ground whole wheat flour and lard. The taste was great and the family loved them. I got a lot of compliments from the three children and my husband. After letting the dough rest for a little bit I made it into balls then let those rest. When rolling, I flatten the balls a bit with the palms of my hands then rolled like pie dough. There was no problem with sticking and the dough was silky and easy to work with. I will be making these again and the only thing I will do differently is cut down on the salt a bit.  I'm super sensitive to it and these were a little salty for my taste. The rest of the family didn't even notice, though, they were too busy eating them! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Tortilla recipes are always hard to judge. I am not mexican but I lived in mexico for 2 years. During my time there I learned new recipes everyday from some fabulous mexican cooks. Tortillas are something you master so your first attempts may be failures but you must keep trying. The ladies that I worked with always joked that you wouldn't be able to make good flour tortillas until you are ready to get married.

This looks almost identical to a recipe I have used over years, except for the amount of baking powder.  However, I am trying to cut back on the fat I use in my Mexican food, and if you cut the shortening in half, the recipe is just as good.  Also, I never let the dough rest.  I find it easier to roll them out right away when the dough is still perfectly elastic.  Once it gets rough, forget it.

Don't bother. They completely crumbled when folded. Let the grocery store do the work.

I have made these several times and have finally perfected the technique.  The first time I made these I got something very similar to fried pie dough.  After re-reading the recipe, I found that the solution is to use less water, as the dough should not be sticky.  The second time I made them they were still sorta like pie-dough and the last several times I've made them they were perfect.  Because of humidity variations I heat up the full 3/4 C. of water in the microwave and then add 1/4 cup at a time until I get the right consistency.  I usually only need to add just over a ½ cup of water.

As written, this recipe is only ok.  3/4 cup shortening is way too much.  I have a rule of 1 tablespoon butter-flavored shortening for each cup of flour will give you a soft delicious tortilla.  I have been making tortillas for years with a recipe I have that uses no baking powder or hot water.  So I was intrigued by the comments to use boiling water and baking powder.  So I used 5 cups flour, 2tsp. baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/3 cup shortening and about 1 1/2 to 2 cups boiling water.  The boiling water made a big difference in the doughs consistency and the baking powder made my tortillas more like gyro bread, my family liked the difference, they noticed right away!  I will continue to make them this way. So thanks for the new ideas.  Lastly, no one mentioned stacking and covering them with a clean kitchen towel right after cooking them.  It helps keep them warm and soft while preparing the rest.

I followed the advice of other posters and used 1/2 cup of shortening and cut the salt back to 1 1/4 teaspoons.  I put my water in the microwave and heated it to just less than boiling.  They were wonderful!  I made a double batch and it took me a bit longer to cook them than I had planned. Once my kids, all 7 of them, started eating, there were no complaints and it was worth the wait!

This is an easy receipe which yields wonderful tortillas.  I grew up in New Mexico and these tasted just like the tortillas I used to eat at my friends house!  I will make these often.

I have tried this a couple of times already and really like it.  The tortillas do turn out the best if you let the dough rest for an hour. I learned this after reading over that step the first time I made them.  These have a very good flavor too.  They also shrink in the pan if you don't have a heavy weight to put on top of them.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe is great for its versatility.  I've tried both oil and shortening and have ended up with satisfying tortillas.  I have also used corn meal and wheat flour as partial substitutions.  I hate buying tortillas now.

It was stunning to have fresh tortillas! Never had it before, so it was an amazing experience! I do have to admit that I never expect it to shrink so much in the skillet! They became half the original size! Thank goodness I was aiming to make extra big ones (they ended quite small, but if I made them the original size, I would have had no space to put my fillings)

I used my kitchen aid mixer to mix up the dough which was quite tasty.  And I used my pasta machine to roll it to an appropriate thickness.  Then I cooked them on my electric skillet.  The flavor is very good but they are not flexible at all so I think I may have overcooked.

I was taught how to make tortilla's w/out exact measurements. More like eyeballing the ingredients in the palm of my hand. When I read this one I custimized it for 24 tortilla's and cut the shortening to only 1/2 a cup. They taste really good.

This is the closest I have gotten to my mothers' tortillas.  I just have to be careful with the amount of hot water.  Try this and you may not go with the store bought tortillas again.  :)

You can't find a simpler, more versatile form of bread. I've made these a number of times and find that you really don't need the baking powder; it makes them too puffy.

This is the third time I've tried to make tortillas..which I know now is an art.  This was the best dough that I have tried. I used almost boiling water and it did make the dough soft and pliable.  In past attempts with other recipes the dough was crumbly and hard to work with. The cooking of tortillas is tricky. I think it's just hard to know how hot to cook in order to heat the outside but still still leave them soft enough to roll into a burrito.  Although my tortillas were not all round and some had darker spots than I would have liked, they did taste good.  This recipe gives me some hope. I'll keep trying.

These are Awesome!!!  Making bread or even these tortillas is an art-you have to get a feel for the mixture.  If this is the only bread you have ever made then it may be that you don't have the "feel" of the dough.  I have killed at least 50 loaves before I got the feel!-LOL  As another reviewer suggests-Mommy of four-use hot water, as hot as you can stand it-this is the key.  Then keep flour on hand and add to get the right consistency-you can always add but not take away.  Once you make these a couple times they become easier to make.  I think they are definately worth the time.  The taste can not be mirrored by the store bought but I still use store bought in a pinch.  If these don't turn out the first time I would give them another go because they are super!

This is a good recipe and I have been making tortillas for over 54 years! IF you really don't want to go to the simple trouble of making these tortillas...there's an easier way..Buy a small pkg of Masa Trigo by Quaker Oats.  You add to 2 cups of the Mix , 1/2 cup of hot water.and mix with a fork til the sides come together into dough.  Gather your dough and add some extra flour to a clean work surface and roll out the balls of dough. You will see that it is very simple to make just like homemade tortillas.

This recipe turned out wonderful. Using very hot water, almost boiling, helped to make the dough perform as the recipe states. Our nine-year-old daughter who helped roll out the dough, thought making our own tortillas really fun. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been looking everywhere for this recipe.
My mom and I used to make tortillas all the time.
She passed away last summer, and I couldn't remember
how much of anything we used.  The other tortilla
recipes all call for sugar and strange things.  This
is the way my mom and I used to make tortillas.  It's 
a FANTASTIC recipe!

Howlin4 used milk instead of water.  Regular milk is a base, not an acid.  A recipe calling for baking soda (which is also a base) needs an acid such as buttermilk, vinegar, yogurt in order to activate it and make the tortilla cake rise.  Stick to very hot water.

I loved this recipe! The tortillas were amazing. I used the measurements as a guide but just added more water and shortening until the consistency was right. I am a vegetarian so I used vegetable shortening and used less salt than was recommended and they turned out great.

OMG!  This is exactly what we have been looking for!!  After moving from the Arizona desert/Cali/Mexico border our only option for tortillas has been store bought and they are loaded with ingredients i can't pronounce and taste AWFUL!!  It is so nice to have authentic flour tortillas b/c you can't eat just one!  And like another reviewer stated, they are like bread and will go bad.  Have to keep in the fridge and use quickly.  will make these again and again!

Very easy to make.  I accidentally used way too much water, but was able to compensate by adding flour until it looked more like dough ( I cut the recipe in half, but misread the water portion).  Anyway they turned out great!  I used a tortilla press and a tortilla warmer that had been gathering dust in my cabinet.  Worked great! Next time I'll pay more attention to the recipe directions.

I changed the recipe just a bit and it is so good! I don't have shortening so I used sunflower oil and 2 cups whole wheat flour with 1 cup white. I also did it in my breadmaker because I can't knead with my shoulder injury. They turned out great. I may cut the oil a bit in the next one to reduce the fat a bit, but this will be my go to recipe when I want tortillas - which is all the time. :)

I followed the recipe to a T and they were hard, too salty and too thick from the baking powder.

I never made tortillas before and I found this recipe to be easy and the outcome was great.  I used the suggested trick of a towell to keep them soft.

Awesome! I made it healthier by substituting 1 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour and adding sunflower oil instead of shortening. Great, I am pleased!

I usually use another recipe but couldn't find it last night so found and used this one.  It has more shortening than I am used to using but they turned out great and everyone enjoyed these tortillas very much.  Thanks!

These were much better than the lousy ones from the stores. Plus they don't cost anything really to make, just a little bit of time. Will always make these when making something with tortilla shells.

I have made flour torillas before but I had never used shortening.  These turned out pretty good but not great.  I had problems with them breaking when made into enchilladas even though they were wrapped in towels and hot.  These seemed a little too much like pie crust but they did have a nice homemade flavor and butter flavor from the shortening.  Over all we enjoyed them but next time I will try something else.

These are excellent, hard to roll thin, but great!  They are better a little undercooked.

Although I can't roll them into perfect circles, apparently...these are DELICIOUS!  I will definitely make these again.  GREAT recipe!    I cut the shortening in by hand then used my mixer to make it cohesive.

This recipe is has good flavor but does not hold together.  I made torillas before with the dump method and I should have known better when I saw how much shortening was in the recipe. They do not hold together after you cook them.  Use the Homemade flour tortilla recipe on this site, it is much better.

Not bad. The thinner they're rolled the better. Best heated up...can tend to get floury if too thick.

I think this recipe was amazing and I will never buy store bought tortillas again...!  Some things that I did differently or had problems with and made a solution! When I did all the ingredients my dough was flaky. So I added more boiling hot hot water just a tablespoon more. Then I think mixing the dough by hand makes them twice as better. Before mixing all the ingredient I added a ton of butter two my hands and it gave the tortillas a butter flavor as well... Remember the older the flour is the more water you will need!

These are wonderful! I'll never buy tortillas at the store again! I used a canola and butter, since I didn't have shortening on-hand, and they came out awesome! I agree that you should cut back on the salt a little, these were pretty salty. I think the tricks are...you need very, very hot water, mix and knead with your hands, adding flour as needed to get the right consistency. Once it's a smooth ball (not dry OR sticky), it's ready. I only needed to heat for 30 seconds per side, and flipped when they started to bubble up.

Not sure what I did, but it ended up being much more pastry than tortilla! Really flaky and crumbly, I couldn't actually wrap anything in it without it breaking apart. However, they were very tasty anyway.

I just finished making these because I was really in the mood and there were so many positive ratings for this recipe. I never change anything the 1st time I make it just because ya neva know!! But now that I have made and ate three small tortillas I have to say that they did come out pretty thick, they were also a bit too salty and I made sure to sift the flour, salt and powder.  I think I would try this again because it was easy, but I would reduce the salt by half at least and roll the dough out thinner. Overall it reminded me of a pot pie crust.

I got a tortilla press for Christmas, and these were the first tortillas I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were so delicious.  I will start to experiement a little now with whole wheat flour, maybe a little butter, but I wanted to have a base line.
Scrumptious!!

This recipe is great! I love it. This was the first time I have ever made tortillas. They are delicious. There's nothing like homemade tortillas coming straight off the stove. I did take advice from other reviews. I used only 2 table spoons of shortning per cup of flour. I also wrapped the pre-made tortillas in a towel. To keep them from getting hard prior to cooking. I am currently still cooking them and putting them directly in a storage bag to keep them soft and warm.

I made a dozen of these bad boys for lunch-time fajitas for my family. Between myself, my husband and two small children, they didn't last half an hour!! They were super easy and tasty! My son, who HATES all things bread, ate his no problem and my daughter had three! She never finishes anything we fix her to eat! Thank you so much! And the recipe doubles for sopapillas!!

YAY, this was fantastic.  Two comments: 1-I used a modification that another Reviewer had made and used butter flavored crisco. BIG mistake. The butter flavor made it delicious alright, but delicious as a thin, flat biscuit! If you like down-home southern cooking, that's a fantastic modification. Matter of fact, it would be excellent with "Breakfast Burrito" type flavor. But for authentic tortilla flavor, you just have to use lard or shortening. Second comment - Make sure to knead the dough fully, letting all the hot water (as hot as you can handle!) mix evenly with the shortening and flour. FANTASTIC. There's nothing like REAL tortillas with grilled meat, lettuce, tomatoes & pintos! This is my staple recipe now.

Fantastic. A few years ago I tried another tortilla recipe on this site and they turned out horrible. Not these. I read alot of reviews for homemade tortillas on this site and this had the most consistent good reviews so I decided to try again. I'm glad I did. These turned out for me. Dough was easy to work with, and these taste good. Thank you!

As I was making them I thought to myself that this is more pie like than tortilla like and *suprise* the end result was basically pie crust.

What a disaster!These were hardly edible.  I felt like I was eating pie crust with extra water added.  Way too salty and greasy.  The baking powder added a weird taste to it.  They also cooked up really yellow.  Perhaps I should have used bleached white flour instead of bread flour. I tried rolling them out from paper thin to thick, but nothing helped. I felt like I wasted a lot of time.

This is a recipe for pie crust, NOT authentic tortillas.  Never fear, if you want to try it anyway, you can use your pie crusts as crusty soft chips for nachos or poor honey on them for a tasty treat.

This recipe was easy to work with and delicious!  I made chicken tacos and was able to prepare and cook the tortillas right along with them.  My family was so excited!  We'd tried other tortilla recipes, but this one will definitely become committed to memory.

It was my first time trying.  My tortillas came out flaky and not as pliable as I wanted. It was also little too salty for my taste. Will read the other suggestions and try it again.

How can this be named "Authentic"??  These pie crusts didn't even resemble a tortilla in any way other than they are round and flat.

I watched my grandmother make tortillas a hundred times, I thought I would try these tortillas, and these "tortillas" did not react as real tortillas do.  This is more like pie crust. I may try this recipe for pie crust by adding a bit of sugar.

Very very very tasty! BUT they are more like a pie crust than a tortilla. To make them right, you'd need to add a whole lot of flour. I'm going to try the other well rated tortilla recipe next time.

I LOVE this tortilla recipe. I grew up with my grandmother making them homemade but since they've come out with the "just add water" flour, I just used that one, until I came across this recipe. This is sooo much better. I will use this recipe from now on. Oh!! The tortillas are ligher and fluffier. YUMMY!!!!

I tried this last night as a spur of the moment thing and they were great!
I halved the salt and baking powder and used boiling water and the dough came out nice and useable. I rolled it out with a pasta machine and then connected all the pieces together and then using an inverted bowl and pizza cutter I got perfectly round tortillas. Cooked them for 20-30 sec per side in a high quality stainles pan with a thick copper bottom. Will use this recipie again for shure.

Simple and tasty!  I let the dough sit for about half an hour, rather than the recommended whole hour and also cut back on the salt as recommended by others.  These were really easy to make and went quickly!  I served them with Homemade Guacamole, also from this site.

My mom, Balbina, used to make tortillas daily, back in the fifties.  I had tried to make mine like hers, but, never could.  These are so close to Mom's, I could swear these were hers, and I was a kid of 8 Years old again.

This was pretty good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because they were a little bit on the salty side.  My husband loved them that way, but they were too salty for me.  Besides the salty factor, they were awesome!  Very easy to make!

These were really good, and turned out great. There would just be a couple things I would change. Less salt-I think 1 tsp. would do it. Also, the shortening was a little overpowering-I would probably do 1/4 c. shortening and 1/4 c. butter, or something to that affect. I used really hot water, rolled them paper thin, and only cooked them 30-40 seconds a side. My first I cooked the full minute on each side and it came out crispy.. These were easy and cheap to make, and I think with a little tweaking I'll have the perfect recipe for tortillas! Thanks!

I learned to make flour tortillas from my husband's Mexican sister-in-law.  They were quick to mix, using only biscuit mix and water.  (But, to be fair, even she said they were definitely NOT traditional).  These are sensational!  Thanks for another recipe.

The amount of water in this recipe is merely a suggestion.  You need to add until it feels right.  I had to add more to my batch.  I thought this recipe was wonderful and plan to make it frequently.  Thanks!

Although, there was nothing wrong with this recipe, it did not taste like a tortilla, more like a flat biscuit.  Lacking a chewy texture.  May experiment using less baking powder.

These didn't turn out well for us.  They tasted like biscuits and fell apart easily.  I don't know what I did wrong as this recipe seems to have worked for plenty of people.  I used boiling hot water and rolled them out paper thin like people had suggested.  We ended up using them as a make shift tostada, they were decent that way.  The kids really enjoyed them, but I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

These were okay. The later ones I rolled out were better because I rolled them very thin. Also, I got 18 tortillas out of this batch. Will try them again.

I was always under the impression that tortillas were difficult and time consuming. This was an easy and delicious recipe. I won't be buying store bought tortillas again. The only thing that I would add to the instructions is to place the tortillas in a container with a lid to keep them hot and moist.

These are very delicious and had my kids coming back for more. They are not the consistency of a tortilla. I agree with others, it is more like a pie crust in consistency, and is very flaky. Maybe with some adjustments of water and shortening ratios (like most of the high raters did) it would be more like a tortilla.

Very authentic, especially if you use lard instead of Crisco.  Tastes and cooks just like my momma used to make.

I wonder if this recipe calls for too much shortening. The tortillas I made were more like flat biscuits, in that they were not pliable and were very flaky. They tasted great, and my boyfriend loved them - although he kept calling it flatbread and we had to use them for "open-faced tortillas" because we couldn't bend them without breaking them. Another reviewer suggested Esther Nelson's recipe, and I agree that it was better (the recipe is exactly the same, except hers calls for only 2 tablespoons of shortening).

I followed the direction exactly and I think they come out to oily. Next time I make them I will reduce the amount or shortening.

Boy oh boy, did I have the measurements wrong! I have been making tortillas all my life but they have never come out exactly right. Turns out this recipe was just the ticket for perfect tortillas. The only thing I changed was using "butter flavored" Crisco instead of lard. Very, very tasty!

I have not tried this recipe as it is very similar to the recipe I grew watching my mom & dad make. The only difference istead of lard or shorting they used bacon fat less than the amount of shorting called for in this recipe about 2 tablespoons per cup of flour and they are out of this world!!!

My boyfriend is latino and I've been trying to make flour tortillas for years with no success. Finally tried this recipe.  Lessen the recipe to yield 8. Followed the recipe exactly and used really hot water. Came out perfect. Boyfriend said it reminded him from when he was back home.  :) Thanks

Thanks for posting this great recipe!  I adjusted the quantity down to 6 servings.  Used just a bit less salt and baking powder, hot milk instead of water, a heaping tablespoon of lard/Crisco combo, and crossed my fingers!  I've tried a few flour tortilla recipes and just couldn't quit.  I added the milk and kneaded only ten turns.  Oiled my hands up just a tiny bit, shaped the dough into a ball, divided into six balls, covered with a damp towel, and set aside for 45 minutes.  Flour dusted the counter, heated the unoiled griddle under medium flame, rolled one tortilla THIN, cooked for 30 seconds a side.  Moved on to the next one.  BEST, BEST, BEST effort ever :-)  Thanks!

A great tortilla recipe if you use VERY hot water I didn't realize what a difference it could make, now I know what I've been doing wrong all these years!

I agree with Mommy of Five the butter flavor shortening works really well and the other review they must be kept moist due to the fact they are fresh and dont have all of the preservatives that you find in the store my husband will not eat store bought anymore...and these are much healthier due to the fact YOU have control of what goes in it. Once you make these your family will never want store bought again. Happy Cooking everyone!!!

These where the best tortillas I have ever made. The only thing I changed was I used half weat flour and half white, and they turned out great! U could bend them in half with out breaking and the flavor was out of this world.

I tried this recipe the other day for my husband, who was raised with homemade tortillas, and he absolutely loved them. I just made a change of adding about a tablespoon of butter to give them a buttery flavor and they were perfect. They were easy to make and I recommend this recipe for anybody trying to make homemade tortillas.

I thought this was ok. I will make this again only because I know this recipe has potential for me. I thought it had a little too much salt. I love the fact that you can use shortening instead of lard. My mother would always make tortillas when I was younger and I'm hoping I can make them just like she did.

It was easy enough to make, but for me, tasted like pie crust and dried out for my husband, rendering it, in his opinion, not edible at that point.  So the search is still on for us in the tortilla department.

I followed the recipe, but my flour never made a soft ball.  It was somewhat falling apart, and by the time it was time to roll out, they were completely hard.  I ended up baking them, not at all tortilla dough. I gave it 4 stars because the taste was great!

My cooking techer at school had us make these the other day and they were amazing! homemade tortillas are one of my favorite appitizers:) and they're actually healthier than fried bread and a lot more yummier. i guarantee you'll like them if you give them a try.

Yum! These were great! I didn't have shortening (oops) so I used real butter. They were absolutely delicious! It seemed to make the texture a little softer than I think shortening does. I'll try it with shortening next time just to compare but I might stick with using butter.

These were yummy, a bit salty though. I made just as directed. I did not find these to be tough, but a bit flakey. I could not lift these with out it flaking. I tried thick and thin. It seemed the thinner the better. I think these will be great with a bit less salt. I'm sensitive to salt though.

I found that these are very good tasting but don't think about folding them. they broke like tile. I tried making them twice but nada. My guess is that there is to much lard or shortening.

I generally use a different recipe from my aunt's family. These were okay, but I did have to use the oil in the pan, which I'm not used to (always used just a hot pan). Were good for enchiladas though.

I made these just the other day. They remind me of my neighbor when I was growing up. She would send us off to school. Tortilla with butter in hand. Envy of all the other children. They were delicious!

I followed the recipe and these came out okay. Overall, they were good but i'm not sure if I would make them again. Maybe I will make some modifications next time.

I'm mexican as well and have made tortillas since I was a kid.  The original recipe did contain shortening, however, we switched over to another's friend recipe, where all she uses is vegetable oil, some salt in the flour and warm water.  She doesn't even use the baking powder, although I still sometimes include it.  I can't tell you exact measurements, b/c I just calculate as I'm throwing everything together, but too much oil will make them hard, so be careful with the oil.  It's almost a trial an error thing.  Even with our friend's recipe, we could never get them as nice and big as she got them.  They were perfect, she even had to fold them in four, but they were always soft and pliable. Experiment until you get it right...  Ahhh...and the best way to eat a recently made tortilla is by rubbing some butter/margarine over it and rolling it up.  Good luck!

I lost my favorite recipe for tortillas and decided to try this one. When I was mixing the shortening in I realized this one has way more shortening than my usual recipe. Although the dough was really easy to work with, I did not care for this one at all.

WAY to much shortening - almost like pie dough, and very difficult to get cooked all the way through without burning the outside.

This is the 2nd tortilla recipe I have made - and failed at. I must be doing something wrong. They taste divine, but they come out kind of flaky - not flexible. They broke when I tried to fold them. I used scalding hot water like other reviewers suggested. I'm sure this is a wonderful recipe. It's just me who is failing here. Any advice? 

i just ended up putting fajita filling on one and topped it with another. That was really good.

I grew up on tortillas and I have never been able to make them like my mother or my sister. These come fairly close. No one had ever told me about adding hot water before. I had always used cold and could never figure out why they never turned out right. Now I know why. Thanks for an awesome recipe

I had high hopes for this recipe. I followed all the suggestions, cutting the shortening back to 1/2 c, cutting salt back to 1 1/2 tsp, using boiling hot water, dividing the dough up ito balls before letting it set for an hour, keeping the done tortillas in a plastic zip bag to retain pliability. Nothing worked. They were rather hard and not bendable, had a bland taste. I will definately look for a better recipe. Sorry.

It's a fried pie crust. I will try to fix the rest by adding more flour and hot water to it. I followd this exactly and I know what real totillas taste like. I think this has way to much shortning.

I must have done something wrong, but I followed the recipe.  It turned out just like hard tack.  Tasted like it too.
     I'm unsure of what I did wrong because I cooked them until they were no longer raw and they looked fine until they cooled and turned hard.
     I imagine this would be alot easier recipe if I was shown how to do it by someone else.

This recipe is great, and they're so easy! My family loves them. Im guessing by some reviews people mistake storebought for authentic. These taste more like what you get in Mexican households.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I agree with previous reviews about the tortillas tasting more like a pie crust. I think they had a nice taste, but they didn't taste anything like a tortilla that I would eat with Mexican food. Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious when warm and fresh.  After about 10 minutes I understood some peoples comments about it being a little like pie crust.  I will try again, maybe I messed up along the way.

These were great!  I did only use about 1/3 cup of lard (gasp!) and boiling water instead of just hot.  The dough was so pliable and easily rolled out.  SO much better than store-bought.  Thank you.

I have several cook books and none of them have a recipe for homemade tortillas! Thank you Thank you for posting this one!  I have always used the pre- mixed tortilla flour you find in the grocery store, but I knew how much cheaper it was to make them from ingredients I already have in my kitchen..and this recipe was excellent! I got 14 tortillas from this one: I agree that you have to get the "feel" of the dough in making tortillas..I did not use boiling water only very hot from the faucet..but I had to add a little more water than the recipe called for and I rolled them paper thin and cooked them in a cast iron skillet..they turned out great!!! I am going to pass it down to my kids! Thanks again for sharing it!

Perfect!!! These came out so nice! Just bare in mind that as with ALL recipes that call for flour you might have to adjust the amout of water you use to get the correct consistancy depening on the humidity.

My first time making tortillas and they turned out wonderfully! These were so great. I will never buy tortillas again. By the way, I only had 1/2 a cup of shortening so I used 1/4 c. of butter instead. Still turned out delicious.

The measurements came out a little off but thanks to the consistency descriptions I pulled it together (butter instead of shortening) and they turned out great. thanks!

The trick to these is to roll them VERY VERY thin.  Anything other than that and you have a Mexican pancake.  It took several tries but me and my husband finally got it right.  Still the tortillas were a tad too dry.  I think I will go with the tortilla mix they sell in the store next time.

I found this recipe to be too dry. It was hard to roll out and after heating fell apart and was doughy. Too much flour is in this recipe.The second time around I changed it around a bit, added less dry ingredients and shortening. Now their perfect

These tortillas had a really good flavor.  I used them to make enchiladas with "Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce", which I strongly recommend.  Thanks for the recipe, Jamie.  I look forward to trying them again.

The traditional ingredients are as follows...3 Cups Flour, 1 1/2 cup Lard, 1 Spoon Salt, 1/2 cup of milk. Period! There is no baking powder which will cause the tortillas to thicken while cooking. You want them paper thin. Most Mexicans have learned to stop using lard for health reasons so they use vegetable oil, margarine or mixture of both. The tortillas will not be white but a tan color.
I will share another trick Mexican use to make the huge paper thin burrito tortillas, they cook them on the bottom/round side of a metal bowl. The "bowl" is usually pounded out of steel to a large dome. This keeps the raw tortilla from shrinking and thickening while being cooked. You can literally pick them up and see through them.

Yep i made changes... From what i was told  from my Hispanic mother in law...  Hers were a 1/2 bag of flower... Handful of shortening.. Big pinch of salt an lg pinch of baking powder... And hot water... Lol... Much easier if you can follow some kind of recipe... They turned out great... Salt... If you dont like salty stuff.. cut it down... If it was crumbly you either didnt add enough water or not enough shortening... And if they are tough you have over mixed them.... All these i know... Ive done them all over the last 20 yrs lol...

Followed recipe exactly and they turned out great. After cooking each one I put them into a kitchen towel lined ziplock bag. When they were all done I sealed the bag and left it on the counter overnight. For dinner the next day I microwaved them in the bag and towel for a minute and they were tender and perfect. Just reheated some 4 days later (stored in the fridge) and still good.

I read through the reviews and tried to follow people's advice, but my tortillas fell apart when trying to roll them up. The outside was very dry too. With the other reviewers advice, I used butter in place of some of the shortening but still had more shortening than butter. I also pre-portioned the dough into balls before resting it for an hour. I know I made them too small which was part of the problem. I don't know if following the recipe exactly without reviewers advice would work better, so my opinion doesn't really do much since I didn't follow it exactly. Don't know if I will try it again though.... I'm sure it's a great recipe if you make it successfully.

We modified this recipe just a little. We used butter instead of shortening, and we used a good bit less. They turned out amazing! Great texture! My only problem is that I think the recipe calls for too much salt and shortening. Other than that, everyone thought they were great!

Doesn't taste like tortilla or even a Mexican tortilla. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and looking for great recipe. Tried this recipe, the texture was perfect, I rolled it not too thick or thin, it was nice and soft, taste awful-like dough or lard can't explain it and most of all its too SALTY! I was very disappointed with this recipe. I've been following all recipe and most recipes was great from appetizer to dessert but this one....hmm.  I wish people who makes rating are honest about the taste giving this 5 star is overly exaggerated!!

These were tasty but shrunk in diameter and got thick the second they hit the pan.  Despite keeping them in a tortilla warmer, they ended up a bit dry.  When I rolled them out so thin that they were difficult to handle, the shrinking didn't matter so much, but I think there's probably a better recipe.  We still enjoyed them - just not give stars' worth..

The flavor was outstanding, but the texture was way off. More like a flaky biscuit or pie crust. I'll try again, but need to figure out amounts. Open to suggestions...

I don't always have manteca (lard) around, I was hoping this recipe would be a good alternative with the crisco. It didn't make the soft fluffy tortilla I'm used to but I think these would be excellent as quesadillas.   Delicious though!

Great recipe. Fairly easy to make without too much fuss or clean up. These ones are easier to store than others, as they stay softer longer.

I used Canola oil for my shortening. Next time I might try butter. These came out OK...I found that if I turned up my pan to medium-high heat they came out better than if I cooked them too slowly. The dough was really easy to work with. I just thought they were a bit thick/floury tasting instead of chewy & bubbly like the kind at Costa Vida or Cafe Rio. I wonder what makes the ones there taste sooo much better than mine? Hmmm. There must be a secret!

This is the first mexican food I have ever prepared at it was a breeze.  I used the tortillas for an enchillada dish and it worked very well.  I will make another batch for the freezer definitely.

I didn´t like these at all unfortunatly. To me they had an extreme FLOUR taste. I am a big fan of corn tortillas but do not have access to mexican seasoning or food. I did use butter instead of shortening since is hard to come by in Brazil. It was easy to make though.

Tasted pretty good, and were fairly simple to make.  The kids enjoyed helping me press out the tortillas.  They were a little drier than I preferred; our local mexican restaurant has the moistest, fluffiest fresh tortillas, and I was hoping for a closer match, but these are pretty good nonetheless.  I'll keep looking for a moister end product.

I was looking for a recipe to make tortillas and this one was OK.  Way to much shortening.  My own recipe:
3 cups of self rising flour (flour already has salt and baking powder)
2 tablespoons of shortening
1 cup of warm to hot water (not boiling)
Very easy and not too many ingredients

This was my first time making tortillas!  This recipe was great!  It was really easy.  The only changes I made were using lard (which I guess is even more authentic) and I thirded the recipe.  I do think they were a little salty so I will cut some salt the next time.  I will use this batch for quesadillas so I won't add salt to the filling.

Was a little too salty for me.  The first time I made them I did not let the dough rest and they were just not right.  I made another batch and left it rest for an hour and they turned out perfect. We liked the taste and the consistancy was great.   Thank you for the recipe.

Kind of heavy and not very pliable...they fell apart when we tried to eat them.  Not sure what I did wrong...but I definitely would use Crisco instead of lard.

Let me say, we really like these tortillas, if I could I would have given the recipe 3.5 or 3.75 stars.  But the lower rating is because the tortillas are too stiff to actually use in burritos, tacos etc.  I've tried it three times, with variations on the shortening/water content with the same result.  But the taste is great.  I use them in casseroles, and the process of making them really is enjoyable.

These weren't too bad, but they tasted a little like pancakes. I will probably use this again becaues they had a gordita tortilla taste and consistancy.

These were ok.  I think I made mine a little too small and thick cause they had too much of a pastry taste for my liking.  I think I'll try again some time but only make 8 and roll them out really thin.

A little on the salty side,I rolled them to almost paper thin but they were still too thick once cooked.I agree that you should tweak it to your own tastes I will try it again next time I will cut back on salt and baking powder and maybe try a tortilla press .

These didn't taste bad but they didn't taste like tortillas either. They tasted like biscuits. I will try this recipe again because once I made them into fajitas they tasted okay. It just needs a little tweaking.

This recipe was easy to make, but it was far too salty and the tortillas were too dry. Maybe if it had milk or eggs in it, it would be better.

This is too difficult - easier to by fresh tortillas, and they taste better fresh.

These tortillas have GREAT flavor!!  I had a little trouble rolling them thin enough.  When I put them in the skillet, they got puffier than a store bought tortilla.  But the kids and I liked them just the same!  Thanks

I did this recipe exactly as it said but it did now work out.  I made them too thick.  I even used a tortilla press. My reccomendation to people who use this recipe is dont use the butter shortening and roll them as thin as possible. maybe next time i try this recipe it will actually work.

Very tasty! They really do have to be rolled as thin as possible, and do not use butter flavored shortening, it is just to much! Chaeya

This made some great tortillas!  If you want more "buttery" flavored tortillas, use a butter flavored shortening and reduce the salt by at least 1/2 or more, depending on your taste.

this recipe gives beginners to advance cooks at very detailed and authenic way to create some of the best torillas/yet the directions are very easy to follow and the end product is wonderful...
plus you can show your kids how to make this treat
or they can help you be making their own/if under 10yrs old you can cook them for the kids what a family cooking project...don't forget to shred the cheese......excellent recipe......
