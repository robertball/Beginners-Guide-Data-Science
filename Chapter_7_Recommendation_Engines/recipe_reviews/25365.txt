What a great bread! I used the Sweet cycle on my Wellbilt and after the 2nd knead I paused the machine rolled out the dough approximately 5 by 18. Used half amount of the filling listed and rolled from the short side. Pinched the ends and edge closed and returned the dough to the machine and resumed the cycle. Did not use topping. This made a perfect swirl and did not have to use my oven.

My husband and father both loved this bread. Both went back for seconds which is something these two picky eaters hardly ever do. Next time I will try it as a loaf instead of a ring.

We all enjoyed this recipe but I think next time I will use pecans rather than walnuts (just a personal preference). Easy and relatively quick. I will be making this for our family at the holidays.

This is a wonderful recipe! It isn't too sweet & it is beautiful to look at. I made it using wheat flour (minus the raisins) & it turned out very nice. I did have to cover it for the last few minutes as the walnuts started to burn. I will definately make this one again!

Awesome recipe! My kids loved it. To try to make it more healthy I substituted 1 cup of white flour with 2 heaping tablespoons of milled flax seed and then filled the rest of the measuring cup with whole wheat flour. It was a gloppy mess after the dough cycle ended so I added a small amount of white flour (2-3 T) and gently worked it in; let it rise in warm oven for about 20 minutes and continued onward. I also increased cinnamon to 1 t (we love cinnamon) and omitted the raisins. It did take a little longer bake 4-5 minutes maybe and as suggested I lightly covered it after 12 minutes of baking. Not a hard a recipe -- machine did most of the work. Thanks Marylyn! P.S. No one noticed the flax or the wheat:-)

Came out really pretty. Seemed kind of time consuming and took a lot longer than the 25min to bake.

The way I made this it was a delicious cinnamon swirl bread. I was able to make two 8 inch loafs with this. The only thing I would do next time is to double the filling but I think that it was lacking filling because of the fact that I made it two loaves instead of a ring. Will make this again! Tastes great toasted with butter and a cup of tea!

This bread was excellent! Will be my new staple to bring to brunches. A lesson learned though; I left it to rise for several hours while I did a few errands. It got too big and started falling apart which caused a mess in the oven. This also messed with the bread/filling ratio (too much bread). I will definitely only allow it to rise for 1 hour next time.

Disappointed. Tried to make a variation described by sandygocal but the dough turned out extremely sticky and messy. Result tasted ok but I felt it was a waste of good walnuts. Won't be making this one again.

Made with pecans instead of walnuts just due to personal preference. Made as a loaf rather than ring. Did not top with additional pecans. Very tasty! It's just fine on it's own at room temp...but warm it up for a few seconds or toast and top with butter and it's awesome! Also makes phenomenal french toast!
