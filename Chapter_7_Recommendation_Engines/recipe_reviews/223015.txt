I chose to make muffins out of this recipe instead of one big cake. I used "soured" lactose-free milk and I added two teaspoons of dried lemon zest--I made no other changes. I got exactly 16 medium sized muffins out of this recipe. Baked at 350 degrees, they were done at exactly 20 minutes. This quick bread recipe is absolutely wonderful. The muffins looked like something you'd see on the front of a cooking magazine! The muffins turned out moist, perfectly sweetened with the perfect amount of blueberries. My whole family loved these!

Thanks for the great recipe. I didn't have 2 cups blueberries so I did 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup strawberries and it was delicious. Would make a great breakfast cake or for entertaining. Definitely recommend the butter and sugar on top because the cake and berries are not sweet, so it is a nice complement.

Easy - Yes!
Made these into muffins.  I definitely liked the butter/sugar topping.  Needs that bit of sugar.  Made a half batch which ended up with 12 muffins.  I used 1-1/4 cup blueberrys which were starting to look a little shriveled.  Turned out great!  Took them out of the oven (350) at 22 minutes as the blueberries were popping!  Yum!  As the other review mentions, they do not look done - I was waiting for them to brown, but finally decided to get them out before they dried out too much.  Will make again.  Hubby thought they were "not bad" which is a fair compliment coming from him :)  They aren't the worlds best, but definitely worth keeping as I haven't found the "worlds best" yet.

Added a cup of choc chips and a t of cinnamon. Yummy! My mother, husband, and 3 yr old all LOVED it. My daughter wanted a blueberry Bday cake, so we tried this and it was great. Did NOT taste like a muffin at all. very cake-like. The choc chips helped a lot.

So easy!  I was feeling lazy so I just mixed the whole thing (except blueberries and flour) in my stand mixer.  No mess - easy cleanup.  Tastes great - definitely a must to add the butter and sugar.  Will be a great breakfast cake/muffin or after camp snack for the kids with all the fresh blueberries in season over the summer.

I thought this tasted good. It kind of reminded me of a mix between a cake and definitely a blueberry muffin. The interior was soft and the outside was more muffin like. I liked the sugar and butter coating. The cake was sweet without being overly sweet tasting. I halved the recipe to try it, and baked it in a 8x8 pan. I didn't think it looked blended enough by hand so I ended up using a mixer and beating it about 2 minutes. Make sure to watch it carefully. The outside and bottom was finished baking well before the top appeared to be so. I thought it tasted better the next day after it all softened also.

I made this I always use buttermilk when a recipe in a cake or muffins call for milk, it can’t hurt all it does is make it moist. This is very similar to the best blueberry muffin recipe. You can smash up 1/4 of the blueberries and then put the rest in coated with 1/4 of the  flour saved . It’s a wonderful cake . Thanks for sharing. One other thing the secret to all recipe is to not over cook . They’s  the hardest part in Baking and the key to the finished result .

Very easy to make with ingredients that are always on hand.  I only added 1/2 the sugar topping and it was still sweet with a slightly crunchy top.  My six year old says, "That cake is a miracle."

This was absolute perfection!  Substituted almond milk for milk, did not beat eggs prior to adding, thawed frozen blueberries and tossed lightly in flour after rinsing. Baked in two 9 inch glass pie dishes. Baked for 25 minutes, removed, brushed with butter, sprinkled sugar and baked for another 5. DELISH!

This is an easy, yummy cake that worked out absolutely perfectly.  I wanted to make it pareve (non-dairy), so I used coconut milk and coconut oil instead of the milk & butter.  Straight coconut milk was a bit too rich, so I'd probably use almond milk next time, but the melted coconut oil was just perfect on top!  This seems like it could become a staple around here...

This is so simple to prepare and bake. The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the melted butter before brushing on the cake.

Actually I added a squeeze of half lemon and little zest plus one table spoon of white vinegar, it gave more fluffiness and the lemon taste was yummy

I am not a baker but wanted to try something fairly easy.  I didn't have milk so I replaced it with coconut milk. That worked. I used a pie dish instead of a 9 x 13 baking dish. I told you I'm not a baker. I only had 2 c. of flour. The recipe called for 2 1/2 c. I think because the coconut milk had a thicker consistency it worked. I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen/drained. This is why I don't bake. My creativity gets the better of me and it doesn't always turn out well. My husband loved it though.  I think if I had followed the recipe exactly as it is presented, I would have been able to give it that extra star. It's pretty easy so I recommend it for sure.

I made quite a few changes but it still came out good. I used 3 flax eggs in place of chicken eggs, 1 mashed ripe banana in place of oil, 2t cinnamon in place of vanilla, brown sugar not white, vegan butter not cow's milk butter, used pea milk and whole wheat flour AND FROZEN berries which I thawed rinsed and tossed with flour. Adding to the batter made it blue ??I tried. I baked in 9x9 for 30 plus 10 and it is really dense but super delicious... like a dank blueberry coffee cake. Definitely not a cake which requires frosting!

I chose this cake because it used oil (I used light olive oil) instead of butter, and made a good choice!  It was very good.  I subbed 1/4 cup vanilla low-fat yogurt for 1/4 cup of the milk, but that was the only sub.  I baked this in a bundt pan, about 40 minutes at 350F.  Served with whipped cream.  Thanks for posting!

It was a very easy recepie to make. You only need four measurements for it. If you use convection oven, preheat you're oven to 350 and cook for 20 minutes. Add your butter and sugar. Cook for another 5 minutes.

This recipe is super easy and delicious. The cake is moist and flavor packed. I reduced the sugar to less than 3/4 cup and it's plenty sweet. You could probably get by with 1/4 cup of sugar--or less.  I substituted almond milk.

Light, moist, not too sweet and can be served as dessert , coffee cake or even morning muffins ! I made mine into tiny cakes and we had some for breakfast, 2 days in a raw and froze the rest (this recipe made 18 pieces). I baked at 375 for 20 minutes and turned the broiler on for 1 more minute. I made 2 changes. I used some lemon zest with half the Vanilla called for and skipped brushing with butter, but sprinkled some sugar on the cakes before baking.

I replaced the milk with cashew milk, and added chopped walnuts on the top with the butter and sugar.  Came out beautifully!  We love it.

I had more than 2 cups of blueberries, closer to 3 and I added them all. It wasn’t too much. This cake is moist as can be, just sweet enough and is great for a big family breakfast/brunch. I do not fair well baking cakes from scratch, but this one came out great and I am thrilled!

Very easy to follow and adaptable recipe!  I made it as a Bundt cake (see pic), adding ten minutes to the baking time.  I only used 1C of sugar, dusting the blueberries with maybe a tablespoon along with the flour.  Also added cinnamon to the flour.   I had about 1/4 cup of the dry ingredients left over (flour, sugar and baking powder), so I dumped that into the melted butter to make a crumb topping, putting that on for the final 10 minutes.  I had some turbinado  sugar, so I dusted the top with a handful or two after applying the crumb topping.

I did not fold in the blueberries as directed, but just poured them over the batter and pressed them in a tad with a spatula.  Pretty happy with the result and would definitely do this again, adding orange or lemon zest as suggested in previous reviews.

I don't bake often so I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out wonderfully. It doesn't take much imagination to see the versatility in the batter.  I'll be making it again but trying lemon extract.

I made this cake for my Life Group at church and received rave reviews!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added the zest of 1 lemon to the batter.  I also put 3 tablespoons of butter and sugar on the top at the end rather than just 2.  I used about a cup of frozen previously fresh blueberries (the last of my summer reserve) and 1 cup of canned blueberries.  It was delicious!

This is a very nice recipe. Like the name implies, it's easy. The cake itself is very good but I didn't give it 5 stars because, although very good, it's missing a "wow" factor. The sweetness is almost too much. That said, I will make it again because it's perfect if you need a dessert and you don't have a lot of time. I might experiment with a lemon zest topping or something. Wild blueberries would help too.

7.18.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223015/alices-easy-blueberry-cake/ ... I had high hopes - not that this was bad, but I've made better.  The berries sunk - even with the flour coating - but they were large berries, too.  'Not a big deal.  I actually made two & sprinkled some on top of the batter of one of the cakes.  They sunk a bit, too; but could see it's a blueberry cake; the other one wasn't so obvious until cutting.  I reduced sugar to 3/4c & it was sweet enough.  I know, surprising, but it was.  I didn't do the butter & sugar deal, but I bet it's good with that.  Three days later:  'Still more than half the cake left.  The cake looks like it was supposed to be layered - bottom blueberry, top cake - the one that I didn't  scatter some on.  Very disappointing.

Great, easy recipe. I used 70% wholewheat flour. Very moist and delicious. Made it as a one bowl as didn't have much time. The outside did crisp up (some might like that), but I wanted it soft so I just covered it in cling film while warm and it went delicious and soft on top. Will use this as my go-to quick cake recipe.

Easy recipe. Tastes so good.  The only complaint is that the blueberries sank to the bottom of the cake? Not sure if they were to large?  Or because I used skim milk? Would love suggestions. Overall a phenomenal recipe!!!!  The sugar/butter on top made it amazing...added a little crunch.  Will make it again

I halved the recipe and made it in an 8 inch round. Otherwise followed the directions exactly. It was amazing! So tempting to keep cutting just a little bit more. Would also make a perfect blueberry muffin. I'll definitely make it again changing nothing (except maybe varying the fruit).

I would add a pinch of cinnamon next time to give more flavor.

I made this for my hubby as he absolutely loves blueberries. I followed the recipe as posted, and it turned out delicious! I chose to make the cake. It didn't take long before it was all gone! I have made it several times. Definitely a favorite!

This recipe is so fantastic! I am currently in South Korea and I made these muffins in a toaster oven! It was seriously perfect for a Christmas morning away from home. I did half the batch at 20 minutes and they were golden brown and delicious!

My daughter gave it 20 stars :-)

I didn't add the butter and sugar combination at the end.  I just sprinkled on some left over streusel mix on top before placing it into the oven.  It was sweet enough without being over powering.  Part of the middle wasn't rising for some reason, but it still turned out fine.  We will definitely be making this again.

I made a full sized cake subbing almond milk instead of dairy milk, and coconut oil instead of butter. This cake is so light and fluffy! It's delicious, and the sugared topping just sets off the whole thing. 
I used frozen berries, cuz that's what I had on hand, and they all sunk to the bottom while it was baking, but it really doesn't take away from the cake at all. I think I'd make muffins next time, just to try them.

I love how easy this was to make. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 dish. It came out perfect! I used frozen blueberries but otherwise followed the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of blueberries and 2 cups of driend cranberries. I cooked them for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and they came out wonderful!! I then added the butter and sugar to the top and put them back in the oven for 2 minutes. They were delicious! I added a photo. :)
