I prepared this exactly as written.  It was very easy to prepare and it came out decadent and delicious!  I especially love the caramel pecan crust.  I'd never had anything like that before.  The cheesecake is definitely a semi-sweet flavor.  For those who would prefer more of a milk chocolate flavor, try using fewer bakers chocolate squares, or melt a milk chocolate to mix in the cheesecake.  I thought that many would be too much, but it tastes great to me and wasn't at all grainy.

AMAZING!  Did some tweeks by instead mixing the plain batter, then mixing half the chocolate amount into half the plain batter, and then mixing 16 melted caramel squares into the other half of the plain batter, then we just marbled the two in the pan.  OMG so delish!  Made it more of a true 'Turtle' cheesecake with the addition of the caramel cheesecake.  Yum!

I made mine with a vanilla wafer base, by crushing 1 1/2 cups of vanilla wafers and mixing it with 1/4 cup of melted butter.  I pressed that into a 9x3 springform pan.  Once I poured my caramel mixture over the base I  sprinkled the top caramel layer with 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I prepared everything else as directed and baked with a casserole dish on the bottom rack, filled with water, to prevent the top of my cheesecake from cracking.  Once baked and cooled and the rim had been removed, I drizzled on some store bought caramel sauce and hot fudge sauce, in a decorative fashion, the sprinkled on another 1/2 cup of crushed pecans. It was a HUGE HUGE hit!

Amazing! Make sure you don't let the caramel go to close to the edges otherwise it will stick. But overall, so tasty and so easy to make!

This recipe tastes great, but it's a hassle to make. The carmel was stuck to the pan so i hard time getting it out of my springform pan. The crust didn't stay together. It made an awful presenation.

The pecan and caramel crust was very good, but the chocolate cheesecake was dry and like eating chocolate paste.  I will never make this again.

It was a good cheesecake overall, but the crust was so sticky and extremely hard to cut through.  Will not ever use carmels again in the crust.  Filling was very rich and sinful!

5 stars for taste, 1 star for ease and presentation! I followed the recipe exactly, and although the cake was delicious, it was a terrible sticky fussy mess. The caramel never hardened, and it kept oozing out of the cake all night in my fridge. When I tried to serve it, all the pecans and caramel were stuck to the pan, so I wound up scraping them off and serving cheesecake with a side of jumbled mess. Everyone still said it was delicious, but it sure wasn't pretty!

A little time consuming, and the caramel crust really stuck hard to the pan... However, this cake is worth the trouble. Believe me, it's so rich, and dark, and smooth, and SO PERFECT!!!!! my advice: don't waste time asking yourself if this recipe is worth it. you won't be disappointed!!

I made this and it tasted to me like a no bake cookie. I only used half the chocolate it called for because i was trying to make it marbled...but that didn't work it all blended together. I also added an extra brick of cream cheese and an egg. Added a 1/2 c. whole milk. I took it to work and it was gone in a flash.

I made this but I made the crust out of Vanilla wafers. I also melted the caramel in a double boiler not microwave. Same with the chocolate chips for the chocolate. I also did not put the caramel on top of the crust I cut it in on the top and then baked it and then used the left over to cover the top and added the toasted pecans and chocolate chips (whole). My boyfriend is a cheesecake fanatic and said this was the BEST he has ever had, so did the rest of my family. So I give it 6 out of 5  :)
