The flavours in this was amazing and super easy to make in the instant pot.  I used frozen chicken thigh and breast, I did unfortunately get a burn message before it came to pressure, but when I opened the pot the chicken was already cooked.  Some of the chicken breast had stuck to the bottom, so next time I’ll either add a bit more liquid or set it on the trivet, just a heads up.  I can’t wait to make this again!  Thank you for sharing such a fab recipe!
