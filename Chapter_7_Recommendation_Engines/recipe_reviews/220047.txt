As written, I think this is pretty bland.  I tasted after following the recipe to the letter and then ended up adding additional cumin, some cayenne. a splash of vinegar, and a little chopped cilantro.  This rating is based on the recipe as written, not with the additions made.

Sorry. It was very bland and the rice was too wet which, I suppose, could be the way it was supposed to be. Not my choice.

I didn't have all the ingredients on the list so I did this instead:

1 half red pepper
1 half onion
some mixed herbs
vegetable stock.

A very easy recipe for lunch.

Add chili pepper and a squirt of lime juice for flavor.
