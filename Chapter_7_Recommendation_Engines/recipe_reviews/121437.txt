This is an easy to make dish and was well received for our Christmas brunch. Although the recipes says it serves 8, three people finished this up. I like to prepare the crust the night before and cover it well with plastic wrap. I used Pillsbury Golden Layers Refrigerated Biscuits instead of the crescent rolls. I split each roll into two pieces, spread them out over the pan and press together, going up about 1/2 inch along the sides. I also shred the cheese and cut up the onion the night before. This makes for a quick prep in the morning. All I had on hand was dried chives and that worked well. I didn't measure, I just sprinkled them on top. Great recipe.

This was just ok but definitely easy! I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8.  Could have used more onion, ham and cheese (used colby/jack).

This was a great brunch dish for such a simple & quick recipe!  I was following the recipe exactly but I had 1/4 cup of chopped green bell pepper on hand, so I decided to add them to the onions & we really liked having them in there.  I made no other changes aside from being a little generous w/ the amounts of onion & ham.  :)  Next time, I'll reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp as I thought it was slightly on the salty side (the cooked ham I used had plenty of salt already).  The fresh chives are a must not just for the added flavor, but for the beautiful color they provide.  I look forward to using this recipe with other kinds of veggies in the future.  Presents beautifully w/ that golden crusty edge!  Thank you for sharing!  :)

Even with a few modifications, this was still a quick, tasty little breakfast.  We didn't take the time to saute onions with the ham; we just added chopped deli ham to the egg mixture and poured it over the crust.  We also used shredded colby-jack cheese instead of swiss, but I bet both would be great!  I think the onions would make the flavor pop--will definitely try that next time.

Very good. I used leftover Ham that I had from Thanksgiving and cheddar cheese since I didn't have any swiss. This was very easy and very good. Also added a little bit of bell pepper into the mix. Will make again.

I was greatly pleased with this recipe.  I did change a few things.  I put a whole cup of chopped onions, 1/2 c of an orange pepper.  I added 2 more eggs, and I dusted the top with mozzarella cheese. I used Velveeta shredded cheese as that is my favorite with eggs. I omitted the salt. I also was generous with the ham, probably used 1 1/3 c.  The only other thing I found I should do is reduce the heat to 350 the first 10 minutes of cooking due to using a dark metal nonstick pan. It took a good 27 minutes to cook. The crust did not get overtly brown. I will make this again an again.  Great to have another way to use crescent rolls!!

Tasty and easy!  I didn't have chives so skipped that and it was still good.

VERY good!  I made it for my husband for Father's Day and had it with fresh donuts from the bakery.  It was a great recipe - very easy and yummy.

Tasty, easy, quick.  Added extra ham and used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss because I didn't have any when I decided last minute to make this recipe as "breakfast for dinner".  Looks great too - the crescent rolls puff up and brown around the egg mixture. I definitely plan on making this again.
