Love, love, love this cocktail!  So simple.  I used 1/2 grapefruit, a teaspoon af simple syrup, and a jigger of gin.  I salted the rim with coarse salt.  Perfect!  I think I'll have a double next time!  I enjoy the taste of gin, but the drink works equally well with vodka.  The grapefruit hides the alcohol taste, so be careful not to drink too much!

This drink is great but try not to add too much salt. Also, DO NOT USE A PLASTIC CUP. The acid + the salt = a very messed up cup.

After buying tons of grapefruit from a co-worker's son for a high school fundraiser, I tried this recipe and my oh my, am I glad I did!  I used vodka instead of gin just because that's what I had on hand, and added a packet of Splenda for a little sweetness.  Very refreshing!

My go to drink is a salty dog. I use vodka and search out restaurants that fresh squeeze grapefruit. Never add salt to the actual drink! It's a salted rim!

This is sooo tasty. Don't be deceived by its simplicity! I used bottled grapefruit juice (100% juice, not ruby red) and a couple pinches of salt. I think I like this even better than my usual summer fav of gin and tonic and that is saying alot!

Simple, refreshing and saves me $12.25 from the Chicago cocktail prices when made at home. Bonus points for drinking them without having to interact with the bar crowd.

This is also my "go to" drink! I use either pink or ruby red grapefruit for the sweetness, vodka, and salt the rim instead of in the drink. It counts as a fruit, right? ;)
