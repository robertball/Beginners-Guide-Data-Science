I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews!  (There were only 2 of them when I made this recipe.)  The oven temp on this recipe is obviously way too high, especially compared to other toasted pumpkin seed recipes.  That should have thrown a red flag for me, but I didn't trust my instincts, and instead followed the recipe, only to end up with burned seeds.  Too bad, I really liked the idea of a sweet alternative to a seasonal favorite.  Maybe I'll try again next year with a 275 degree oven...

Great recipe, thanks! I followed the recipe to a T, except, after reading the reviews, I baked in 7 minute intervals, instead of 15.

This recipe is really good, but I agree completely with the previous reviewer. DO NOT BAKE SEEDS FOR AN HOUR. Mine needed no more than 25 minutes. The best thing to do is just check on them every ten minutes. Other than that, they turned out great!

I made two types of pumpkin seeds this morning--this one and the Spiced Pumpkin Seeds on this site.  We prefer these seeds because it has that salty/sweet thing going on.  But I do have a couple problems with the recipe.  First, be sure to to use a dark pan.  I used one dark pan and one light colored metal pan, and the dark one definitely browned the seeds better.  Second, way too much butter--the seeds were seriously swimming in it; I would cut it in half next time.  Lastly, the temperature is too high--I ended up cooking mine for 1 hour at 300.  I did end up having to break them apart after I pulled them out because they stuck together like peanut brittle (although not quite as hard).  But their redeeming quality is they actually taste good--although now I'm dealing with little greasy fingers!   UPDATE 10/09:  Made these again.  This time I cooked @ 300 for 45 minutes.  Taste great!

I don't like roasted pumpkin seeds because of the texture of the outer shell but my husband does so i tried this recipe this year and it is wonderful! after reading the previous posts i decided to follow the directions exactly with the only change being the cooking temperature. I baked them at 250 for the first 30 minutes and 350 for the last 30 minutes. they taste like a seasonal candy and i don't even notice the texture of the outer shell. This is a keeper! Thank you so much!

Hi Cathy - I don't know if there is a misprint in your recipe, but I followed the cooking instructions to the letter and ended up with charred pumpkin seeds.  Did you mean to recommend an hour of cooking time?  Help!

I used 1 cup of seeds and cut the other ingredients by 1/2. I also reduced the cooking time and kept an eye of them while they were cooking. I made 3 different pumpkin seed recipes and this one was my favorite. They taste a little like carmel pop corn.

What a disapointment! They were dripping with margarine and again, mine were burned- and I really watched them. I think the oven temp is too high. Anyway, I won't be wasting my time again.

Loved it!  I made these this morning after carving our pumpkins last night.  I did as another user said and limited the time to 7 minutes each time instead of 15, and also used wax paper on the pan...turned out great!!  Thanx so much for a great recipe!!!

I used butter instead of margarine and cut the amount to 1/4 cup.  I used a Pampered Chef cinnamon sprinkles and wished I had used more.  My husband and I thought they turned out delicious.  A very tasty and addicting snack!

Great recipe!  Only had 2 cups of seeds from the pumpkins and I did boil them in salt water for @ 20 minutes.  Completely dried them and followed the directions exactly EXCEPT lowered the temp of the oven to @ 275 degrees, just like everyone else who reviewed this suggested.  Next year all of the seeds will be used for this recipe.  Happy Halloween!

this recipes is definitely a 5 star if you follow my advice:  1) Bake at 7 minute intervals, NOT 15.  2) Do not decrease temperature. The temperature was fine, it was the length that was the problem.  3)After you take them out, sprinkle salt and brown sugar on them. Bake for a minute or two more, and VOILA! Perfect-o pumpkin seeds!!!!!!

white sugar is a BAD idea.  I felt like it was a bad idea from the start and I should have listened to my instinct.  They were doing great and smelling amazing until the first coat of white sugar went on...they black smoke started rolling out of the oven within minutes.

I wanted to respond to the comments about the cooking temperature and time... I bake these on my Pampered Chef jelly roll stone... and so the high temp and the time work out perfectly - when cooking on stones, you can cook things FOREVER without them burning. If you're using a different pan, obviously, you need to watch the seeds carefully. Sounds like the general consensus is that 275 to 300 degrees is working well for most people - and checking often, (which you have to do to stir them anyway) is another key to success with this recipe.  I'm glad many of you have enjoyed the recipe.

I didn't much like this recipe. The timing is all off and the temp is way to high. I burned all of the seeds.... never the less, if you tinker with it, they could come out good with the ingredients involved.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this recipe with my son's pumpkin seeds!  The oven temp was way too high and the cook time was way too long.  I ended up with burnt seeds within 25 minutes!  I'd recommend an oven temp of 275 degrees max.  My 5-year old was so sad that mom burnt his seeds!  Too bad.  We were looking forward to trying a different recipe this year!

These were good. I added a little more white sugar at the end for more sweetness. Also, I will not cook them as long next time. They almost burned on me.

I so should have read the reviews before making this, what a huge disappointment. I followed the recipe and the directions to a 'T' and I think that was my first problem. I took them out of the oven the last time and they smelled okay. Then I ate one once they cooled, yeah it tasted so burnt. I won't be recommending this recipe or using it ever again.

These are pretty easy, and pretty good...however. wouldn't anything be good if it's buttered and covered in cinnamon, sugar and brown sugar? haha...it's a nice change in snack..and better than throwing out all the seeds..

the oven temp was way too high for the sugar content. Mine were burnt at only 35 minutes! I had to throw away 4 pumpkins worth of seeds. very disapointed. I would have given 0 stars if that was an option.  Sorry

I varied this one a bit-- added some pumpkin pie spice, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of cumin, just for an enhancement of spice to the sweet. And I cut the cooking time down significantly, too. I waited to put on the extra sugar  until they were done but still warm and sticky. Thanks-- They were wonderful!!

I wish now that I'd read the reviews. Fllpowing it exactly will lead to a solid clump of charred seeds and solidified burnt sugar .  If you use this recipe, make sure you scale back your cooking time at least by half. A cooler oven temperature would probably help, too.

These were very good.  A nice change from the savory seeds I always make.  I had half the seeds, so I used a little less margarine, but all of the remaining ingredients.  Very tasty!

I tried this recipe and the only thing I changed was the oven temp to 275 degrees. Turned out wonderful, and indeed a little like honey roasted peanuts. I will definately make these again!

I was excited to make this recipe.  I followed it to a tee.  After only half of the time the seeds were burned to a crisp.  They were totally ruined.  I was very disappointed.  I think the oven temp needs to be much lower, like maybe 250.

I didn't have as many seeds as this called for, so I just coated them until they looked "right", then kept a close eye on them while they cooked.  They only needed about 40 minutes and they were AMAZING.

My husband and I made these seeds last night and we took some of the suggestions by lowering the heat to 350 and watched them closely. I made 2 different kind of seeds and these were the success the other seeds were horrible. My husband says they can stand to be sweeter, I think they need more cinnamon. I will most deffinately make these seeds again. AWESOME!!

This was my first time making pumpkin seeds, so was a little nervous. Even with using the 7-minute intervals previously suggested, some of the seeds still tasted a little burned after only cooking for about 30 min. Will either reduce baking time or temp next time, but the overall flavor of the seeds was very tasty.

I was so excited to try this recipe.  It sounded great, was highly rated, and smelled amazing...at first.  I didn't read the reviews until I was 45 minutes in to the cook time, and they burned sometime between 30 and 45 minutes.  I am so disappointed!  It's not as if I can rush out and get more seeds for the recipe.  I think this would be an  amazing recipe, and I plan to make it again next year, but I will either cook it for much less time or, more likely, an hour at 275.

These taste great!! I was very surprised at how good and crispy a sweet Pumpkin seed could taste.  I only had 1 cup of seeds to work with and I ran the oven at 325, checking the seeds every ten minutes.  I will definitly be making more!

Mine ended up burnt.  I halved the recipe, though I think the temperature would have been too high regardless. I'll make them again but pay closer attention to the temperature and stirring interval.

I followed your recipe to a T and I wish I would have read the reviews, but since most of them were above 3 stars I figured I was in the clear. An hour at that temperature is way too long, and even though they didn't completely burn, they tasted terrible. DO NOT cook them for an hour.

This recipe looks sooo yummy!!!  I followed the directions to a T, but all I got was a burned mess.  I did not read other reviews. I'm not a quitter and will be trying this again, maybe adjust my oven temp.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!  God bless you!!!!

I followed this recipe to a T and my seeds came out looking and tasting like burnt popcorn kernels- very disappointing. Especially after I spent 30 minutes picking the seeds out of the pumpkin goo. Just ignore the time on the recipe and divide it in half.

Delicious! I didn't read reviews until after, and I'm not sure why I didn't have any trouble. I did use butter instead of margarine.  Maybe that was the difference?  Either way, I am very pleased! The whole family is munching them down as I type! :)

I WILL MAKE THEM EVERY YEAR!!!!!! I wish i could give this 4 1/2 they are delicious!! I only had 1 1/2c seeds so I did what some of the other reviews said and cut the butter to 2T and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Cooked them at 275 stirring every 10min, and they came out great!!! The only thing that bugs me is that they do stick together when they are cooled because of the sugar.

I also used a temp. of 300 F and checked seeds every 10 minutes, took about 40 min total.  Used about 2T butter and also added a little bit of chili powder.  Only used 2 T of the white sugar.  Super yummy, wish I had more pumpkins seeds.

Use twice as much seasonings, have oven at 300 and stir every 7 minutes until they are toasted (35-45 minutes).  You can dry them out a bit in the microwave first to speak up the toasting process.

I cut the recipe in half, and used 2 tbs. of oil and 2 tbs. butter. I followed the directions for everything else, except that I baked the seeds at 325 and stirred them every 7 minutes. They turned out very well, and my family liked them. I felt that they were a bit greasy, and not quite sweet or cinnamony enough. The seeds stuck together, because the coating was very caramel-like and gooey. Altogether, these were tasty and I might make them again. Thanks for sharing!

Because of the large number of seeds, I baked them on two cookie sheets. I missed the review stating to cut the butter in half. The first half of the seeds that I poured onto a cookie sheet had a lot more butter with them than the second sheet, so I was expecting them to take more time in the oven. Surprisingly, the seeds that started out swimming in butter really turned out best. I'd recommend splitting the recipe and making it in two different bowls so that each half of the seeds gets 1/4 cup of butter.

Husband: Hey, are the pumpkin seeds done yet? Me:  Ummmm.... they're in the oven. Husband: What?!? Since when do pumpkin seeds take two hours to cook? Me: Well...this is the second batch... Husband:  What happened to the first batch? Me: I sorta... well, ate them all... Husband: (stunned silence)  I halved the recipe and baked them at 300, then checked them periodically until they were the crispness that I like them at.  Super yummy; the taste reminds me of kettle corn.

smelled so good while cooking.  went to garage for a minute and came back with house full os smoke!  totally burnt the heck outta the seed.  i think these need to roast for about 1/2 the time, as I was not even 2/3 way through cooking per recipe.  will try again soon!

Very Good!  I reduced temp to 300F convection bake and followed the recipe as written.  The amount of butter was perfect.  They are crisp and delicious.  Those who ended up with lots of extra butter perhaps didn't have the full 4 cups of seeds?

I dunno - maybe I am not a pumpkin seed fan - too much work to get to the meat, and unlike some, I do not like to eat the shell.  I am giving 4 stars though because I liked the sugar coating - it is tasty. (I had a lot of seeds, so I made some of this, some of the "Spiced Pumpkin Seeds" and some of the "Roasted Pumpkin Seeds.")

This is very good and addictive.  I put some cummin and cheyanne.  I put wax paper on the bottom and stirred every 7 minutes.  The temp was 275 for one hour.  Also, as soon as the seeds are done remove them from the wax paper and put them in a bowl to cool.  Reminded me of a mix of kettle corn and carmel corn.

This recipe was very good! The seeds had the perfect balance of sugar and cinnamon. I followed the recipe very closely, except I used butter instead of margarine and I baked the seeds at 275 in three 15 minute intervals. After the third time, I turned the oven up to 350 and baked for another thirty minutes, stirring every ten minutes. Once you turn the temperature up, you really have to keep checking on the seeds, otherwise they will burn (I almost burned mine, but caught them just in time)! Overall, this recipe is a very yummy halloween treat. I recommend it.

I followed the recipe to a T on this one and the results were disappointing. At the end of the cooking time the seeds were stuck together (and to the dish) like glue. Couldn't even break one away to try it taste wise. It sure made my house smell good though. Don't waste your time with this one.

Tried it tonight - I actually had a little over 3 cups seeds and I ended up cooking the seeds a half hour more than suggested & did not reduce the other ingredients - it actually turned in to a kind of pumpkin brittle and is yummy!:-)I've tried other pumpkin seed recipes other years and like this one the most.

This is probably the best pumpkin seeds that I have ever made! It's perfect for fall. It will remind you of pumpkin pie with all the spices. I will definitely make this again.

These turned out great for me.  We saved all seeds from our family punkin carving and after roasting them bagged them up and gave them out to family!  Everyone enjoyed them.

Delicious! Thankfully I read the reviews before making so here are the changes I made

-My batch of pumpkin seed was smaller than the required amount, but didn't change the coating amounts ( I did strain the seed though)
-Oven at 325 instead of 350
-Baking in 7 minute intervals
-At 5 minutes past the last interval I turned off the oven but left the seeds in the oven, since the coating was still a little soggy. They were completely dry (and perfectly crunchy!) 5 minutes later.
-Total amount of oven time about 30 minutes

300° oven, as the comments said  the directions listed the temp too high.

Used a heaping tablespoon of virgin coconut oil, in place of margarine,and skipped the white sugar.

Checked every 7 minutes, was finished in 28 minutes.

VERY GOOD! TOSSED EVERYTHING TOGETHER BAKE 300 DEGREES FOR 40 MIN TOSSED WITH WHITE SUGAR BAKED FOR 20 MIN LONG. THEY WILL STICK TOGETHER IF YOU DONT HAVE THEM IN A SINGLE LAYER BUT BREAK UP EASILY. WILL SURELY MAKE AGAIN!

They are pumpkin seeds, follow your instincts.  If you think they are done then they are done.

Well, I started reading the reviews while the seeds were in the oven and got really freaked out! I cut the time in 1/2 basically. I put let them cook in 7 min. intervals like other people said, added a lot of extra sugar at the end, I kept it on 350, and they were done in 30 mins.
