This recipe is great! I added more lime juice, cilantro, and a red pepper to give it a stronger flavor and more color. I made it as a side to my main dish for the night and my boyfriend and I loved it so much we couldn't stop eating.

refreshing!  I left out the jalapeno and only used 1/2 an onion, used an entire lemon, and made it a little special by adding some shrimp (cooked quickly on a pan with a little oil and then cut into small pieces).  Had it with pita bread for a light lunch.

I made this last night and my family and I LOVED it! We love to eat at Chipotle restaurant, so I made the chicken and steak bowls that they serve. My husband made the remark, "you've got Chipotle beat with these bowls!" My two year daughter (I made some without the jalapeño for her), ate without her spoon and licked her hands clean! LOL! That made me feel soooo good! Thanks for a grrrrrrreat recipe! ;- D

I made this to add to chicken tacos and overall it was great! I used half of red and orange bell peppers to add a little more flavor and color. I also added half a can of black beans and one extra tablespoon of lime juice. VERY YUMMY!

Very good recipe! We ended up adding in an extra can of corn and doubled the lime juice as it blended better with our tastes.

What a beautiful side dish!  I was trying to find a way to use up a few leftovers and your recipe was simply perfect.  We love it.

I was looking for a corn salsa like what is served at Chipotle, and this is really close.  We like our salsa with a bigger kick and added an extra jalapeno pepper.  Really good!

This recipe has just become part of a very tasty "accidental" meal. The story: It all started with some homemade coleslaw that I wanted to use up, so I planned to make pulled pork sandwiches. I put a boneless pork loin in the crock pot, sprinkled it with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper,doused it with a cup of red wine vinegar and cooked it for 6 hours on high. I made some homemade bbq sauce, but the pork was sooooooo good without it, I decided to go a different route. I tossed a little of the crock pot juices in with the pork which I had shredded. I served it on top of some super easy cilantro-lime rice. It was really good, but it needed something. This salsa was the something it needed. It was very easy to throw together with on-hand ingredients. I happened to have some fresh lemons and strawberries so I made lemonade with mottled strawberries, which complemented this meal perfectly. When summer corn appears, I will try this recipe with some fresh corn, but it is surprisingly good with the canned stuff. The only thing better about going to Chipotle is they don't make me clean the kitchen!

I made this with (ok, more like I did the work and he stirred the ingredients) my bf for a potluck at his work.  I just got a text that said "everyone loved it, you did good!" (lol)  I just made a few tiny changes: 1) subbed red pepper for orange 2) added half a can of black beans 3) used closer to two tbs lime juice 4) subbed a chili pepper for jalapeno (what we had) 5) subbed garlic salt for regular salt.  THANKS FOR SHARING!  :)

Loved this! I can't give it 5 stars because I changed it a lot based on what I had in the cupboard, but it was a great base to work from. Used a can of corn, minced red onion, chopped red pepper, fresh cilantro, lemon juice and crushed red pepper. It was delish! Will definitely make again.

VERY good and EASY corn salsa recipe.  Like others have mentioned this is a very close replica if you are trying to make burrito bowls similar to what is served at Chipotle's Restaurant.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Jeannine!

Great recipe.  Our oldest daughter is vegitarian and loves Chipotle's salad with their corn salsa.  She was home from college this weekend so I made this for her while we had tacos.  It was amazing!  I doubled the recipe and we still had none left.  Will definately make this again...Can't wait to have fresh corn and peppers from the garden to make this then.  Thanks for the recipe Jeannine.

Good recipe & very easy to make. I would reccomend a small red onion or 1/2 of a medium red onion. Served with fish tacos and it was a hit!

Wonderful recipe, and super quick. A great accompaniment to tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. My only complaint is that I find this more a good 'base' recipe, than a complete recipe in an of itself. It's made infinitely better by the addition of some chopped avocado, a few dashes of hot sauce, and perhaps some black beans. You really could customize it however you like. Over all though, very good!

This is a great easy recipe! I have never made corn salsa before so wasn't sure if I would like it.I did change it a little with variations of 1/4 c yellow onion (didn't have a red),1/2 can black beans rinsed and drained,1 teaspoon sugar (didn't have any honey), 2 Tablespoons lime juice, 1 Tablespoon cilantro spice,& 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes.I took it to work and my co-workers loved it. Great with chips,or to use to cook chicken or salmon on the grill. The leftover I used on top of my turkey tacos!

I made it and it was a huge hit. I used left over fresh corn and about a half a can chopped green chili's instead of cilantro. I also doubled the honey, but I had also used large onion, red pepper, and a great big jalapeno! We had it with pork carnita's and a pot of pint beans, man o man!

I get tired of the same old salsa, so I whipped this up for my family to enjoy. They loved it! We had it with tortilla chips, and I also topped a baked potato with it. The only changes I made were to leave out the jalapeno pepper but that's just because I'm not a fan. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I'm rating this 5 stars because, if you make it to taste the way YOU like it, it's worth it.
It's not 5 stars as written (more like 3) because, even though she said she didn't measure, 1 whole onion and 1 whole pepper are too much for 1 can of corn. 
Here's what I used and I think it will be awesome after the flavors meld overnight (but it tastes great now):
1 can no sugar or salt added corn (I don't normally buy this kind, but I wanted to season the salsa to my liking)
1/4 of a large red bell pepper, diced small
1/4 of a medium sweet onion (didn't have red), diced small
1/2 of a medium jalapeno pepper, seeds removed, minced (might use more next time)
Approx 1 tsp crushed red pepper (didn't measure this)
2 tbsp chopped cilantro
Juice of 1/2 lime
Approx 1 tsp light blue agave (don't have honey)
Kosher salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste
After tasting it, as much as I love onion (even raw), I decided to add 1/2 Can of black beans (rinsed and drained) to mellow out the onion a bit.
I'm looking forward to eating this tomorrow because I think it is going to taste light and refreshing with a bit of heat - perfect for summer and July 4th weekend. Enjoy!

I made this to serve over the top of some fried zuchinni cakes that I made from zuchinni that I had picked fresh from my garden. I also used some fresh grilled corn instead of canned. I also used a pinch of cumin.  It was great! I plan on making this again in the future to try as a topping with tacos.

Very flavorful.  The only thing I skipped was the orange bell pepper...just not a fan.  My sister in law loved it and practically licked her plate clean!  Certainly a keeper!!

I love this and often make a large batch and just bring it for my lunches. I normally combine it with a mixed bean salad I make: add a can of mixed beans and  olive oil, vinegar, sugar, salt and lemon juice all to taste.

Refreshing side that would go well with Mexican dishes, fish or by itself. I'll have to go light-handed on the crushed red pepper, as it had too much of a bite for me.  It definitely needs the honey to offset all of the spiciness. I used a steamed, fresh ear of corn that equaled about the same amount in the can mentioned. The fresh cilantro from a plant I purchased recently worked nicely.

This is awesome! So simple to make. I did omit to bell peppers though. The best part, if you’re on Weight Watchers this is 0 points!! But you have to watch the chip intake. Enjoy!

Excellent recipe and super easy to make!  My husband loves it and wants to have it again soon.  I did make one change.  I didn't have an orange pepper, so I used a red one.  This recipe is a keeper.

This salsa is quick, easy and tastes SO good!  I added a can of black beans or you can add kidney too.  Huge hit at football parties and tailgating with Tostitoes scoops!

Delicious and flavorful! I tried a sample after making it and it was refreshingly delightful! I used a 16 oz bag of frozen white corn instead of the canned ones and just thawed before mixing everything together. I varied the serving to eight (to bring to the office potluck) and put in fresh juice of an entire lime. I like the spicy kick to it, the festive color, and crunchiness. I made it the evening before the lunch potluck and I think that helped seep the flavor. My co-workers enjoyed it a lot and asked for the recipe so I shared this! I am really happy and proud to have this recipe guidance and execute successfully.  Very simple and easy!

This corn salsa is awesome. I squeezed half a lime in it. Also, it's even better when it sits in the fridge. I guess the juices soak in better once it sits. It is really great and I've made it several times now to go on salad with chipotle marinated chicken breast.
