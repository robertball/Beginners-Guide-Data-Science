This was a nice, light, easy dinner although I made some adjustments.  I took someone else's cue and added garlic prior to adding veggies and I don't think I would have liked it at all without it.  I added a little more chicken broth than called for and sauteed the pasta in the skillet with all the veggies before serving to help coat the pasta and give it a nice flavor.  A good suggestion as well is to add the red pepper flakes at the end of the cooking process instead as a topping...the pepper gave it a nice little kick that it wouldn't have had otherwise.  Overall a decent recipe that has limitless possibilities as far as toss ins go.  We'll make it again.

This is the first time I have reviewed any recipe here but this was just excellent! I'm on a weightloss journey and I am trying to eat as low fat as possible. This recipe hits the mark. I have made it pretty much every week since trying it several months ago.  I don't add the oil, I just cut up lots of mushrooms, asparagus, garlic, red pepper flakes, and throw it in the pan and cook it using as much fat free chicken broth as needed. I tried it with fat free beef broth and it's just as delicious.
Once the veggies are to my liking I mix the whole pan in with the angel hair pasta. It is sooo delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe. The nice thing is that this dish goes with any type of meat you desire, or no meat at all, if you are looking for a meatless meal.

This was very tasty. I made a few revisions: used vegetable broth to make a vegetarian dish; I sauteed the asparagus with 2 cloves of garlic and added the crushed red pepper while the asparagus was sauteeing; I used baby portobellos (criminis); and added red bell pepper slices when I added the mushroom, which added a nice flavor and also made for a prettier color to the dish. Using whole wheat linguini increased the health quotient of this dish. A great spring dish!

Excellent (Italian!) dish. I had leftover asparagus so was able to skip the step of cooking it. I used spaghettini rather than angel air,  added garlic but omitted the mushrooms.  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese makes this stellar! Also, do save some of your pasta cooking water (it's GOLD!) and add it when you toss your pasta - not only will it prevent your pasta from sticking or getting gummy, but because of the starch it contains it will make almost a sauce or rich emulsion, even just with butter or olive oil.  I like to mix up my pasta right back in the pan before I transfer it to a serving dish.

This was a very easy quick and delicious recipe. I added alot of garlic, and a little thyme, rosemary, pepper, salt and basil when I sauted the asparagus and mushrooms. I used linguine noodles instead of angel hair because that is what I had in the house. It was very good. Definately will make again.

This is a delicious recipe. Easy and quick. I added thinly sliced chicken breast before the asparagus, 3 cloves of garlic and probably 2 or 3 tsp. crushed red pepper. I also stirred in the grated parmesan.

We enjoyed this recipe, it was a great way to use our own garden-fresh asparagus. But next time, I will add garlic and leave out the crushed red pepper. I will definitely make it again, though.

Superbly simple and delish! Made it 100% according to the recipe...light but tasty flavor. We didn't find it at all bland. Though I did wonder how it might be with a bit of garlic and a lemon squeeze! Might experiment later but this is a definite keeper recipe for a quick meal, even for company, as is!

Made this for dinner last night and everybody loved it, even my son that doesn't like asparagus raved. It didn't make enough for all four of us, so next time I'll double the recipe. I did as others and used 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I sauted the asparagus with minced garlic and sliced white onion. I threw in some already cooked salad shrimp I had on hand the last minute and it was great. We served it mixed with thin spaghetti noodles since I had no angel hair pasta on hand. This is a keeper.

Didn't have mushrooms, and besides, boyfriend dislikes them, but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. This was very tasty and I made this for our weekly "Meatless Monday" dinner. It was a bit on the simple side, but again very delicious. Careful with the red pepper usage.. I think I may have accidentally used more than necessary, it heated up the dish a lot. I will make this again, and next time use a little less red pepper.

great base recipe.. I seasoned it with plenty of salt and pepper, sauteed the asparagus and mushrooms together in a little evoo.. and a splash of white wine for flavor before tossing in multigrain spaghetti and sprinkle of parm cheese. im sure i added some calories with the wine however it just wouldve been too bland for me. I love eating healthy, but when healthy food is on the bland side, thats what makes people not want to eat it at all .. but thanks for the recipe, will make again with my adjustments

Being a reluctant dieter, I was prepared for a "blah" low-fat, low cal dish, but I really enjoyed this!  I used others' suggestions and added garlic, salt, and pepper.  Something that might have made the difference it that I topped the pasta with grilled shrimp seasoned liberally with Old Bay.  The Old Bay mixed with the sauce made it very flavorful.  We didn't even need the cheese (yeaa...less fat!  I will make this again!

A good, light dinner. I felt like I needed to add some thickness to the sauce so I added a handful of whole wheat bread crumbs and it was a great texture. I definitely added quite a bit of garlic, some chili powder for a kick, and squeeze of lemon juice. I also added some sliced red bell pepper for some color.

The base recipe is a good start but needed the help of extra flavors & seasoning. We sautéed 1 whole onion w/ 3 chopped garlic cloves before adding the asparagus. We also added at least ¼ tsp. ground pepper & an additional amount of red pepper flakes (total – ¾ tsp.).  Other reviewers are correct.  Fresh Parm. is key.  Another good, quick week-night meal.

This recipe is delicious! We added pulled chicken to give the dish more texture. Next time we'll add garlic, maybe onion, and just before serving, a squirt of lemon to enhance the asparagus.

I wasn't impressed, there seemed to be very little sauce.  However, my family loved it.  They would rate it a 5.  Just wasn't totally my cup o'tea.

This was OK, a little bland. I added leftover shake and bake chicken which helped thicken up the sauce. Next time, I will try squeezing a lemon on it in hopes of gaining more flavor.

I just ate a bowl of this right now! I added in a little onion and garlic to spruce it up and some bell pepper I needed to use up. This is very tasty and VERY easy to make. I also had some avocado that I needed to use up, so I cubed little pieces and sprinkled it on the top...loved it!

This was great, but I added garlic and salt.  I used a chicken bouillon cube and some of the pasta water (I didn't measure, but I'm sure it was over 1/4 c) instead of the chicken broth.  I also added red bell pepper and chicken, but those didn't really add much to the recipe.  The chicken was fine, but the bell pepper was actually a little too sweet, I think, so I won't use that again.

Very simple, very tasty pasta recipe!  It really did take the 15 minute prep time and the 10 minute cook time.  Good recipe for a fast, delicious dinner.  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I used veggie broth, and not chicken broth.  I also used healthy harvest whole wheat rotini, and not angel hair pasta.  My favorite change to the recipe was adding some sun-dried tomatoes.  Awesome addition!  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this as a side dish for grilled mesquite chicken breasts and it paired perfectly.  I used TWO tbsp of olive oil, added 2 minced garlic cloves and used an entire can of chicken broth.  I let the asparagus, mushrooms, garlic and pepper flakes simmer for a while and added a little bit of onion salt.  I added two good-sized tbsp of Country Crock to the pasta before mixing with vegetables.  Once mixed, the pasta absorbed almost all of the broth and left the perfect amount of "sauce".  I always have a way of taking a healthier recipe and making it not-so-healthy.  At any rate, it was fairly light and quite delicious.  I will make it again.

omitted the mushies and scaled the recipe for 4.  Kids went back for second helpings.  In seeing about the blandness, I added some chopped onion in with the asparagus.  Great easy weeknight meal

So EASY!  I loved this!  I added chicken to the recipe and it made a great and simple dinner!  I tweaked the recipe because I didn't have mushrooms or the correct pasta but it was delicious with Bow Tiw pasta and no mushroom... can't wait to try it with!

This was wonderful and so easy.  Leftovers will be great for lunch.  If you don't like spicy, go easy with the crushed red pepper.

Excellent!! I cooked exactly as described. I will add into my "rotation" but next time add some chicken and make it into a meal and not just a side :)   However, I have to say it does make an excellent side dish when you are grilling steak.

This has become one of my favourite meals.  Light, quick and easy. I now add light cream to the sauteed vegetables which makes for a nice cream sauce for the angel hair pasta. I have omitted the hot pepper for myself but that is a matter of taste.

Looked forward to this recipe but was quite disappointed with the end result.  Had very little flavor, in fact, it was rather blah as written.  However, I knew this recipe had potential.
Second time I made this, I cooked the asparagus as noted and removed them from the pan.  Proceeded to cook the mushrooms in the same pan with 1 tablespoon of low sodium teriyaki sauce, a turn of good red wine, 3 cloves of garlic, chicken broth, pinch of red pepper or a dash of black pepper until mushrooms were lightly browned.  As the wine reduces, it enhanced the mushrooms, so simmer them slowly  to preserve the wonderful flavor that will tantalize your taste buds!  

Drained the pasta (do not rinse), added the asparagus and mushroom mixture and tossed with the Parmesan.  Would go well with sliced chicken breast for a light dinner.  So much better and now worthy of 4 stars!

I tried some of the suggestion like adding garlic to the asparagus and even seasoned with salt & pepper twice.  However, I found this recipe to be very bland.

Great recipe, I loved it. I had some fresh onions and squash in fridge so added some to the recipe. I cut squash in 1" inch sticks about the size of asparagus. Sautéed onion first, then added asparagus and squash, then added mushrooms. I added pepper flakes to pan, at same time as mushrooms. Served with spaghetti and mixture of Romano and Parmesan cheese. It was very flavorful!! A definite keeper!

This was the most boring recipe I've ever tried, and I love pasta, asparagus, and mushrooms.  It was flavorless and definitely needed garlic and more chicken broth.  I should have read the other reviews and tried their suggestions before making the recipe exactly as is.

I made this exactly but left out the mushrooms, and I used penne pasta rather than angel hair..  I thought this was really bland.    I added about 5 mashed cloves of garlic and some diced red onion to the asparagus, as well as 2 teaspoons of seasoned salt.  I then added like 3 teaspoons of seasoned salt and some black pepper to the combined pasta and asparagus mix.  I like a lot of flavor in my dishes.    Then just for fun I added a huge tablespoon of Turmeric because I wanted to use up the rest of my jar :) it also made my pasta bright yellow which looks nice with the green asparagus :)    For those that like 'fresh'  or 'light' dishes, this could be like 5 stars but was a little boring for me

A nice healthy meal. I added a large clove of garlic and used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I sauteed the garlic along with the asparagus and added the red pepper at the same time as the mushrooms and the broth. Many Thanks.

I truly love this recipe!  I'm on Weight Watchers, so I use less olive oil and roast or grill the asparagus first.  This keeps really well for a couple of quick workday lunches in the fridge and it's only 7 points on WW.  Thanks!

Not a bad start to a recipe.  Although I added garlic, tyme, salt and pepper.  I also used twice as much chicken broth as called for and cooked the veggies about three times longer than stated because if I hadn't they would have been much to raw for our liking.  I also added red bell pepper for color.  In the end I won't make it again or if I do, I'll add even more seasoning than the first time.

Awesome and so easy.  I didn't have any red pepper so I added sweet chili sauce with my broth.  I like sauce so I used 1 cup of broth.  I minced some garlic and through it all together in a saute pan for 3 minutes with the veggies.  I added some meatballs and tossed it all together.  It was so....good.  Thanks for sharing!

great easy recipe; simple to alter based on on-hand items - I substituted halved cherry tomatoes for the mushrooms and used gluten-free spaghetti. also threw in feta cheese crumbled instead of the parm

I agree with someone who posted here that you need garlic to give it some flavor. I would start by adding more than 1 Tablespoon of oil!  Use enough oil and add the garlic before adding the asaparagus. Definitely toss the pasta into the pan to coat it and include the red pepper at that time.

Nice, light meal, especially good in summer months. I've also substituted the asparagus for squash and zucchini, and it's just as good.

I have to say, this recipe is pretty great. I used whole wheat gemelli pasta, since that's what I had on hand. I also used super thin asparagus spears, so the asparagus was way tender and definitely cooked plenty in the three minutes the recipe indicates. The oly reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I didn't care for the texture of the mushrooms cooked in the chicken stock after only 3 minutes (they were rubbery and not cooked), so I cranked up the heat and cooked a bit longer and it turned out fine.  Do take some other reviewer's advice and save off a bit of your cooking water from your pasta, it does help to make a creamy, delicious sauce, along with an extra pat of butter. I'd recommend fresh parmesan instead of the 'canned' stuff, it makes a huge difference in the flavor. I served this with a garlic chicken recipe from this site--great at home meal with an 'eat out' flavor!

I made a few adjustments as well - added 1T butter to the oil, sauteed the 2 veg together with the red pepper, and used about 1/2 cup pasta cooking water plus 1/2 cup beef broth (to complement my main course) and everyone just loved it! Thanks S.!

Such an easy dish to prepare for a healthy and tasty dinner in hardly any time at all! I followed as directed and was very pleased with the result! The simplicity is wonderful. Clean and flavorful. Great recipe to have around...easily adapted for dinner guests by adding the suggested fruit salad and french bread (or parm-garlic French bread like we did!)

Good! As written it's a little bland for our tastes, but that was easily remedied with a good dose of fresh garlic and parsley. My hubby wasn't in the mood for meatless tonight, so I sliced some chicken breast and cooked that in the oil with garlic before adding the asparagus. I also used whole wheat thin spaghetti. Thanks! :)

This was a great dish! Not only was it easy, but both my health-conscious mom and healthy food hating sister loved it. I added garlic to the asparagus and also added a bit of white wine and cornstarch to the sauce. I would definitely make this again!

A very fresh and healthy dinner idea! I had some leftover veggies to use, so I added broccoli, tomato, and onion, as well as some garlic. Because of all the extra veggies, I used a bit more oil and broth. The end result was very good! The veggies were perfectly tender crisp, keeping all of those healthy vitamins inside. I used Barilla Plus angel hair, which tastes the same as regular, but has more protien and vitamins. A perfect recipe for those Fridays during Lent. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I cooked the asparagus a little longer than the recipe suggested, because it was very thick asparagus.  I also substituted bow ties for the angel hair.  It tasted delicious, and was even great the next day as a cold pasta salad.

This is great, and so easy to make!  I didn't have mushrooms the first time, so I added red bell pepper (since that is what I had), onion and garlic.  I also added the crushed peppers while I was cooking the asparagus.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was pretty good.  I also cooked the asparagus alittle longer.  I added minced garlic to the oil the asparagus was going to cook in.  For me it did need something more to it.  So I put in some cooked chicken.

I am rating this recipe as a 5 even though I did add 2 cloves of crushed garlic, 2 tbsp olive oil vs. 1 tbsp, and fresh, cut portabella mushrooms. This was easy and delicious and can be seasoned/prepped to taste. Delicious!

Great base recipe. You can add different vegetables, meats, or sauce bases. The only negative would be that the recipe is a little bland, but that can be changed easily.

This was surprisingly delicious! I added some garlic as well (prior to adding the veggies) and sauteed them for much longer then directed. I also added more chicken broth so when the pasta was ready I tossed it in with the asparagus mixture to coat it in the remaining chicken broth. Came out very nice! Next time I'll add shrimp too.

This was an excelent dish that complemented the parmasen crusted chicken... I will say next time I will use some garlic and add the crushed red pepper during the cooking phase.  This is DEFFINATELY in my do again file!!  A wonderful change from the tomatoe base pasta sauces... Even the kids ate it. (but they are pretty good at veggies with  a bit of bribery)

This recipe has been in my recipe box for several years, but I've recently decided to go meatless, so I revisited the recipe. I added frozen peas and garlic, and substituted veggie broth for chicken broth. So light, so good and so simple. I plan to make this recipe again this week!

Very good dish! I used Baby Bella Mushrooms and added a bit of white cooking wine with the chicken broth. I also used fresh grated parmesan. Will make again sometime!

Followed recipe exactly. Came out very dry after adding the parmesan cheese and it was too hot (spicy). Next time I will toss the pasta with butter/olive oil and halve the amount of crushed red pepper and maybe add some sun dried tomatoes.

Added garlic and used linguine; not too bad. Next time I'll definitely add some extra spices, but overall a good recipe to use as a base.

4 as is/5 with some changes to suit my taste. My hubby/kids don't care for food that is very spicy....for the heat factor I cut the red pepper in half but without the heat it was bland. To add other/'richer base flavor: instead of 1/4 c of chicken broth (which is not enough to add any kind of real flavor) I used 1/4 of water and crumbled in 1 chicken bullion cube....plus added some diced red onion and a clove of garlic to the saute'd veggies. Since a lot of the flavor in this dish comes from the Parm cheese it is important to use GOOD PArm cheese......not that suff that looks like sawdust the pasta aisle passes off as Parm cheese in a shaker can....I served it over cheese raviloli to add more body as a main dish...it would also lend itself well to adding chicken...so this is a nice base recipie you can play with.

This is a great meal for something quick, easy & on the healthier side.  I did double the chicken broth, add in a zucchini, some garlic powder, salt, pepper & Italian seasoning and also added in the red pepper flakes while everything was sauteing.  Thanks for sharing a ver simple & tasty meal!  :)

Wonderful! I omitted the mushrooms since our family isn't mushroom fans...used some homemade stock I had made the other day, added 4 minced garlic cloves and a couple extra pinches of red pepper...oh and a pinch of salt and pepper...putting this in my "WILL MAKE AGAIN" drawer!

Great flavor, but the pasta dried out quickly after plating. This occurred despite adding additional chicken broth and lifting the pasta directly from the water into the pan to toss before transferring to the serving bowl.)

Who would have known this would be so yummy??  But it was!!  While at work I went to the all recipes spinner on my iphone... plugged in the ingredients and found this.  Gave the recipe to my 16 year old daughter and it came out fantastic!!!  I am on weight watchers so we used whole wheat spaghetti.  Took some other's suggestion and added garlic and red pepper. Used baby portabella mushrooms.  Also.. we didn't have a lot of parm cheese so when we were ready to eat we grated some gouda on top and popped it in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.  We'll definately be making this one again.

With a few minor alterations this was a very tasty and healthy dish.  I did a mix of whole wheat and regular pasta to add fiber.  Also, I love mushrooms so I used more than what the recipe called for and I did a mix of different types of mushrooms.  Taking the advice of some other reviewers I sauted the asparagus with the red pepper flakes and some thinly slice garlic.  I didn't have much parmesan on hand so I used a blend of parmesan and ramano cheese.  Next time I may drizzle some lemon juice over it for some extra pizzaz.  This is one of those recipes you could tweak all kinds of different ways to suit your tastes or mood.  LOVE IT!

This was okay, but last week I tried a similar recipe from this site that was amazing! This recipe was pretty bland and I added a lot of garlic and salt in addition to some shrimp. I also sprinkled some fresh diced tomato over the pasta. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice meal, it just needed more umph.

This recipe was pretty good.  As others stated, it really is a beginning recipe for you to add/subtract ideas from.  I read the advice of others and added a bit of garlic and a bit more vegetable broth.  I liked it but next time I will be adding some other spices and veggies.

Yummy!  A little bland as a main meal, but it would make a great side dish.  I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, added 2 cloves garlic per some reviews and a combo of goat cheese and mozzarella instead of parmesean because I was out of parmesan.

My family really likes this recipe. My only changes were adding an onion, some garlic and I used more broth than what recipe called for.  I overcooked the asparagus the first time so cooked less the second time and it was much better. Very good with lemon chicken.

This is a great basic low fat recipe.  It is wonderful because it is easy to add/delete the vegies you like or have on hand and create a healthy dish.  I added broccoli and used fresh garlic, rosemary, and tyme, and used wheat pasta, and it was super.  I had run out of parmesean cheese, and it was still good...i did use italian bread crumbs instead though.

Great alternative to a heavy cream sauce. I did find it a little bland- I will probably add a little more spice next time. A nice way to incorporate veggies into the meal.

Very good. A nice change.  I would suggest to put fry the mushrooms with the garlic then add the Asparagus.  I added the both and chili peppers together.  A definite hit here.  I am gonna try it with broccoli!!

Simple, quick, and even more delicious the next day. There's a lot of play-room with this recipe, so we used a bit more oil (olive) than called for and added chopped garlic cloves with the mushrooms while sautéing a bit longer as well.

Used bow tie pasta vice angle hair pasta. Also added 1/2 thinly sliced red pepper, 1/2 thinly sliced red onion and 1 large diced garlic clove. Sautéed these veggies with the asparagus. Used a little more chicken broth (needed with the extra veggies). My wife and I loved it, a great Lenten Friday meal!

Love the simplicity here. I was desperate for a quick meal. Make changes as you want. I added garlic to the oil before adding asparagus. Could definitely see sautéing a shallot and garlic in the future to add more flavor. I omitted the shrooms cuz I just didn’t have any this time. Like I said, it was a last second, desperation meal.

I didn't have any cumin, so I used chili powder.  Boy, it turned out spicy!  LOL.  It probably would have been very good had i used cumin.  I also baked the chicken for 20 minutes, as recommended in another review.

I think it would have lacked flavor if I left it as written. I added sliced onion with the asparagus, then at the end I added some of the pasta water, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, and fresh basil. I used only a pound of asparagus and 4 oz of mushrooms since that's what I had in my fridge. I thought the veggie-pasta ratio was good. This is good for a fresh, bright tasting pasta dish.

I love this recipe. I altered it to fit our dairy free needs & it was SO good! I used cashews for the alfredo sauce. I used vegetable broth & vegan Parmesan cheese also.

Added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Also a sharp cheddar added a nice depth to the flavor.  Excellent dish.  I will be making again.  Might try broccoli next time.

As others have noted, this dish is awfully bland without a lot of modifications.

My wife took one look at the recipe and predicted failure because of a lack of herbs and spices and, sure enough, she was right. The lesson for me is to read the comments attached to any recipe before trying it myself. 

The only change I made was to use spaghetti rather than angel air (which we didn't have), but I don't think that made much of a difference, if any.

I probably won't be making this again.

I listened to a few of the reviews by using .5 cup of chicken broth, cooked with 3 cloves of garlic, added 2 tablespoon of chopped brown onion and added basil to the mixture. next time I'll use fresh basil and add either cream cheese or sour cream for a creamy texture. along with other herbs.

3 stars for taste but I raised to 4 stars because it was so easy and also healthy.  
Changes: I omitted mushrooms because my boys do not like them. Also I used whole grain thin pasta.  Nice and  light and surprisingly tasty.  I expect to make this a regular dish.

I made half a recipe tonight and we loved it.  I changed the order of prep some and started out sautéing the sliced mushrooms (with a bit of onion) and about 2 teaspoons of Cajun seasoning.  After about 5 minutes, I added the asparagus and a couple of splashes of chicken broth (about a fourth cup).  I added the cooked pasta, cheese and combined.  I then decided to add a bit of the pasta water (no more than a fourth cup), mixed again then allowed to sit for about 5 minutes while the fish finished baking.  We loved this!!  It pared very well with Hudson's baked Tilapia with Dill sauce.

Made this last night and thrown some extra ingredients in: I can't have a pasta dish without garlic and hobby needed some meat so we added kielbasa sausage and also tossed some grape tomatoes in and added about a cup extra of cheese  Very delicious and healthy meal!  Would make this again!!

Only change I will make in the future is to have the pasta boil in the chicken broth. I feel it will give it a richer flavor.

I topped the angelhair with the asparagus mixture and had my family top it with as much parm cheese and crushed pepper as they wished. I also omitted the mushroom. Great, lite dish. I will make it again this way for sure. My family loved it.

I found this website through a Google search and am so glad that I did! I made this dish for my wife and me two nights ago and it was absolutely delicious. We had it for leftovers the past two days and it is definitely going on our regular recipe list. I would just recommend to go easy with the crushed red pepper as it makes the dish very spicy.

Absolutely fantastic!!  I sauteed the asparagus and mushrooms together in 2T butter then added 1/2 c. chicken broth and reduced by half.  Tossed with Thin Spaghetti and Viola!!  Awesome dinner!  Served with a garlic bread stick twist and fresh green beans.

A 1/2 cup of vegetable broth and whole wheat pasta.  So good, will add more vegetables next time.

I made a few changes: i added 2cloves of garlic and sauteed w olive oil for 1 min, then I added chicken with the asparagus, doubled the cheese and did half parm, half pecorino.  Also tomaccount for the chicken, i added a little extra stick.  Next time I'll drain the stock and add corn starch to make a sauce that will stick to the noodles.  Delicious!  And my cheffie husband loved it too!!  So easy and quite healthy!!

This deserves 3 1/2 stars.  After reading other reviews, I decided to give this dish some more taste by sauteing 2 cloves of minced garlic with the asparagus.  I also added less asparagus than called for.  I deglazed with white wine once the chicken broth had evaporated.  This dish was good but not great!  I served it is as side with breaded chicken.

Great recipe i didn't have mushrooms so i used scallions instead and tossed some rosemary and wine jelly into the frying pan with the asparagus which gave it a nice sweet taste. Will make it again. Great recipe when you don't have time to cook.

Like a few others, I added lots of garlic, some dill and it still was rather blah.  I threw a lot of feta cheese in it and it was wonderful!  It was just missing something without it.

Following this recipe exactly didn't do it for me. Pretty bland and seemed like it was missing something. If I end up making this again I will defiantly add some more spice.

My family loved this recipe!  We added chicken breast strips to it as well.  The only thing missing was some type of sauce...

Felt it was somewhat bland. It was definitely missing something. I added chicken to it and next time I think adding some lemon juice might do the trick.

I must be missing something.  Did add garlic, diced red pepper, and a little butter with the olive oil when sauteeing the veggies.  As suggested from a previous review, added a little pasta water to the mixture.  Even with these additions, it was very bland.  There really wasn't any "sauce" to stick to the pasta.  It might be a good base recipe, but I would need to add "something" for interest if I were to make it again.

I really liked this dish - it's a nice and light pasta dish! My husband didn't like it as much, as he would prefer more bold flavors and a richer sauce.

This was a really good base recipe. I followed a lot of the reviews and it made for an excellent pasta dish. I added the garlic and saved a little of the pasta water and it did in fact make a decent sauce. The one thing I did that was not in any of the reviews is I added a pint of grape tomatoes, sliced in half, when I added the pasta and it was delicious. I don't like asparagus and this was a very good way to make it. Will definately make this again with many different meats.

Very good!  This dish was light and flavorful and also good for you.  I did use more chicken broth (almost 1 cup) and I omitted the mushrooms since I do not like them.  Also used whole grain angel hair so I felt dish was extremely healthy!  I also cooked the asparagus longer then recipe called for.  I will make this dish again.....very good use of asparagus since I usually just bake them.

This is a quick and easy recipe that's easy to customize to your tastes. I used penne because I thought the shape and texture would fit better with the asparagus. I also used veg broth, and I added two cloves of garlic. Next time, I'll use more mushrooms, just because I love them.

This was a nice pasta dish but tasted very bland.  It would be tastier to add tomato pesto, salsa, or a few tablespoons of antipasto.  Will try it again.

DELISH! I added 2 garlic cloves (minced), 1/4 cup slivered almonds and extra chicken broth while sauteeing the mushrooms. Incredible flavor...I will make this a standard in my 'pasta rotation'.

I thought this recipe was a good base, but it definatly can be tailored to specific likes.  I added garlic, onion, and a small amount of half and half to make it a little fuller.  Will most likley make again.

Followed the advice of others and added chopped garlic.  Sauteed everything at the same time for about 6 minutes.  Good with any pasta, but especially tasty with asparagus ravioli from the WSM.  Served with salad and Coppola Bianco.

Very very good. I added lots of fresh garlic before I added the asparagus. I also used a lot more stock. Also, parmesean is only .5 grams/fat so I added some extra at the end and mixed through. With the stock it gave the whole thing a little bit of creamyness. My entiree family loved it and noone was disappointed that there was no meat. I would def. make this again.

Not much change to the original, I just sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and added the asparagus at the last minute. You will need more than 1/4 cup of stock, there's no exact amount, just add the stock little by little till you get the right consistency. Great Recipe! Thank You!

i started this and then realized i didn't have some things, but finished up anyway... so, i didn't have linguini, so i used rigatoni. my asparagus was spoiled so i used canned spears, drained and did not cook them, just  the mushrooms, broth and a minced garlic, some pepper and salt, cooked until done. added asparagus and heated them thru, mixed with drained rigatoni and topped with parmesan. it was still pretty good, and i think it would be better with fresh asparagus b/c it isn't mushy. hubby liked it.

I made this recipe without mushrooms and I added garlic.  The family loved it!  The kids all went back for seconds, as did my husband.  This is a great base recipe and I plan to play around with it to improve it so I'll like it more.  I really like aparagus this way and that isn't one my my favorite things to eat.

This was wonderful, quick and easy!  I did as other reviewers suggested and added more chicken broth and garlic, specifically I tripled the broth and added about a 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder although I think fresh minced garlic would impart a better flavor.  I didn't have angel hair and used spaghetti instead and it was fine.  This was really good paired with the creamy basil chicken on this site, because the creamy basil sauce runs into the asparagus pasta and they taste great together.  This is a keeper!

I made this for the first time a while ago, and was not impressed.  Since that time, I've modified the recipe and find it much tastier.  I add 1-2 cloves of garlic when sauteing the asparagus, and usually use twice the broth called for.  I also throw in a bit of rosemary, thyme and basil when adding the mushrooms.  Great on whole-wheat pasta!

This is a very refreshing recipe, especially since it's asparagus season.  I added some grape tomatoes for extra color as well as some garlic pepper.  Definitely sautee some garlic before adding the asparagus for extra flavor.  Sometimes I'll add a dash of sugar and a bit of tomato sauce to change up the flavor a bit.

I added zucchini and smoked salmon to add more flavor. I love that this is so fast to make but still feel like its missing something...

Super easy and delicious! I boiled the pasta and fried the veggies simultaneously to save time and it worked out perfect.

An excellent quick pasta dish.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, and it made a huge difference.  I also added chicken, but don't think its necessary, only if you want the protein.

Very tasty, and reheats extremely well!

We had this tonight and it was fantastic!  We had to use canned mushrooms and I imagine it could only get better with fresh.  I am definitely recommending this to others.  We all raved about it as eating.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

I used this recipe as a base. I actually used homemade garlic pasta and asparagus. I didn't use chicken broth, just some olive oil and it was great! Loved it!

This could be a winner but you would have to add a load of pepper and garlic in order to add some more flavour to this basic recipe.  I will make this again with a couple of changes.  The crushed red pepper gave it a fun kick.

This was a great, easy side.  I added red peppers like others had mentioned.  I also did a quick "thickening" sauce with some stock and cornstarch and tossed it with the pasta to give it a little more substance.  It was great, and even the 5 year old ate it.  I served it with the baked scallops that are on this site and it was a quick and easy meal that everyone liked.

I took other members' advice to add 1/2 cup chicken broth, as well as garlic and red peppers. I also added mushrooms, for more veggies. It turned out well, and the leftovers warmed up fine, even after almost a week. Just make sure to use fresh asparagus. I would also add toasted pine nuts for flavor.

I really liked this, I thought it had a good flavour.  My boyfriend thought it was 'okay', and some of the other people I gave it too didn't enjoy it as much.  Doesn't really reheat well, but it was good fresh!

Tasty, fast, easy and great for dieting.  I use about 1/2 of the suggested red pepper, and it's become a part of my recipe repertoire.

Good for being a low-fat dish.  I served with romano cheese (okay, that's probably not too low fat) and it was great.  The red pepper gives it good flavor.

I really enjoyed this simple recipe.  It was very easy to make.  I used linguine.  I also added chopped garlic and onion before the asparagus.  I used a small amount of olive oil instead of spray.  I served it with lemon pepper chicken breast.  Very tasty!

Very good recipe, however I wish I had read the other reviews before I made this.  I left out the red pepper just because I'm not a big fan and used vegetable broth to  make it vegetarian.   Next time I make it, I will definitely take everyone's suggestions and add garlic for some extra kick.

I tried this using canned mushrooms and frozen asparagus. Nobody went for second helpings and the leftovers went in the garbage. I'm not sure if these substitutes would make that big of a difference.
