My husband had already de-boned the goose, so we baked it that way and we only added 1 jar of sauerkraut (2 seemed like a lot.)It was the best goose I'd ever tasted, but I am not a big fan of goose. My husband, who loves goose loved the meal and the goose was quite tender. The sour of the kraut and sweetness of the applesauce and brown sugar make a nice combination.

This is a very good recipe. We liked it and it reminds me of our Czech Grandma's goose and duck dinners. Very Good!

A very good way to prepare goose. My husband and son are avid waterfowl hunters so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare their bounty.  They don't clean their geese/ducks whole, they only save the breasts (except rarely).  So, I cut goose breast meat into large chunks and just put it into the crockpot raw with everything else.  Dinner will be in an hour, but I took a bite out to "taste test" it.  Very good and I'm sure there won't be any leftovers!  Thank you!

As close as I want to get to Goose is a friendly game of Duck, Duck Goose; however, my husband used this recipe last fall after one of his hunting expeditions and the men folk seemed to like it. I went shopping that day. One of the nice things about Allrecipes is that it has something for everyone; thanks for the post.

I had to halve the recipe because like Mother Ann I only had the goose breasts to work with. To lessen the amount of carbs, I used a shredded rutabaga instead of potato and unsweetened applesauce. Next time I think I might use my Mom's sauerkraut recipe, which adds a bit of bacon and onions to the mix. Other than that a great recipe Matt, thanks for posting!

My boyfriend and his father have so much goose meat during the fall and I wanted to take a stab at my own way to prepare it so I found this recipe and wanted to wow them. They loved it! As for myself never having goose meat before it was good, but I think I enjoyed the sauerkraut more than the actual meat. The brown sugar was definitely good in it, but the meat was still very gamey for me. Overall though great recipe and will keep it in mind for next year!

I did less sauerkraut also added some carrots and just threw it all in the crock pot. About 2 hours on high and 2 on low it was so yummy, I was supper scared of it by the smell but to my surprise it was actually really yummy.

Good stuff. I used 2 breasted geese plus a breasted mallard soaked in lightly salted water for 2 nights, rinsed, and prepped by removing all dark, bloody patches, skin, etc.. Sliced breasts into 1/4" thick strips across the grain and placed in sink to drain completely. At same time, fried a 1/2 lb. chopped bacon with 1 medium onion and set aside. Added a little more bacon grease to skillet, turned up heat and browned goose slices on both sides but not cooked through. In large crock pot, layered bottom with peeled small-medium potatoes, then browned meat, bacon-onion mix, (next time I'll insert a layer of apple slices here), and topped with 2 quarts kraut. Sprinkled about 1/4 c. brown sugar over kraut and added 1/2 c. water to crock. Cooked on high for 5 hours. Meat was tender and not gamey, co-workers made short work of the entire batch and asked I make it again.
