This recipe was absolutely delicious! I had a large amount of spinach to use, and so it worked in this recipe perfectly. I used shallots instead of leek, and fresh red, orange and yellow bell peppers instead of the jarred kind. I would also recommend making more pasta then the recipe calls for - the dish will not suffer for it! I will make this again for my family, most definitely.

This was really, really good, I threw in a can of white beans as well, omitted the leek for an small onion.  Served with breadsticks.

This was great for a ONE dish meal.   I subbed onion for the leek (all I had) and doubled the parmasean cheese. I only approximated the 6 oz pasta so I thought I better increase cheese. I can't wait to try this with leeks!

I really like this! I don't use leeks, so I used onions and used the whole jar of roasted pepers. I also added a pinch of Chili flakes to spice it up a bit. Great weekday meal!!

This recipe was tasty, but like others, I used an onion instead of a leek.  I would  suggest putting a good sear on the sausage before combining it with the rest of the ingredients.  I also added whole roasted almonds for a pleasant texture variation.

I've made this several times for guests and everyone devoured it.  The 2nd time I did use real sweet sausage instead of turkey sausage & it was a bit tastier.  YUMMY!!!!
