This is definitely a keeper for us.  My husband and I are not big on quinoa or chickpeas, but this looked like a good healthy dinner, so we gave it a try.  We both loved it!  The dressing is delicious and makes this dish.  I halved this recipe for the two of us, but wished I had made the full serving of dressing to enjoy more of its goodness.  I substituted baby spinach for the kale out of personal preference.  I had an abundance of craisins, so used those instead of the cherries.  I think this dish would be even better with the cherries, though.  The portions are generous.  I think you would have enough quinoa and salad for 5-6  servings.
