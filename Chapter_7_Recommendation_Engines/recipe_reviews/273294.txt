I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of a little extra bacon and it was amazing!!! I didn’t cook it on a rack but it was tender and just spicy enough!!!!

These turned out perfect. I jam packed each breast with cheese mixture and placed them on racked pan slit side up. Had two huge breasts so baked for 50 minutes. Cheese oozed out a bit but the chicken was juicy and delicious. Scored points with hubby for this meal.

This is a very flavorful recipe and a good filling to amp up a plain chicken breast.  I would definitely recommend trying this recipe if you like jalapeno poppers and bacon!

Definitely a repeat for me and my husband! I used four chicken breasts however with the filling recommended and only wrapped in 2 bacon slices. Baked for an hour

I did not change a thing. The Jalapeno has a very good taste with the bacon. Just hot enough. Marlene

Made it as close as I possibly could to these specs with what I had at home. Absolutely will be making it again! Delicious, and amazingly juicy considering the length of time that it's in the oven. The jalapeños were very mild though after baking. I might try something hotter next time.
