I made this deli-cious potato salad for my family.  We enjoyed the unique ingredients.  In particular the use of pickles instead of the usual celery is very good.  We also enjoyed the sweetness of the apples in contrast with the tartness of the vinegar.  The salami is a good addition; I used sliced Genoa salami strips as I had deli sliced Genoa salami in the fridge.  Also, I used red potatoes with the skin on.  Thank you ibbz for sharing your recipe.  I am not a big fan of making potato salad because it is a lot of work but I would make this again because it is delicious and certainly worth the time and effort. :)

I thought this was very good, however did not add the apple, wasnt that brave yet, Also, I did double the dressing, and added a bit of mustard and my family really liked it!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Really good potato salad...practically a meal.  I made it vegetarian and a little healthier by subbing in fakin' bacon, vegannaise, cage free eggs...and for a healthy and delish twist, apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar. This has a great mix of favors, I'm a big an of the apple/bacon and pickle flavors. Cheers!
