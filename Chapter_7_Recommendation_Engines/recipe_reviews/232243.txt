Ramen Noodle Stir Fry with Chicken & Vegetables Haiku: "Wow, this was awesome! Only changed two tiny things, but did rest the same." I didn't have quite 2 cups of broccoli, so I used asparagus to make up the difference. Didn't put the single wedged roma tomato in at the end b/c I thought it would just get lost in the all the other stuff (plus, I don't think tomatoes really jive w/ stir-fry flavors.) I'm not a fan of ramen on its own (well, since college days that is) simply b/c the flavor packet is just soooo SO strong, but it mellowed out when mixed w/ all these great veggies and chicken! And wow, it all came together wonderfully -- we absolutely loved this dinner! Next time I'm going to add some red bell pepper for a little more color, or try swapping chicken for shrimp or maybe try to a different flavor of ramen - seems like it'd be a fun recipe to tool around w/!

Considering I'm a college student and buy lots of ramen, this is one of my go-to recipes.

I had chicken thighs and broccoli set aside for dinner . . . Decided to try this recipe with the things I had on hand (even had a random package of Oriental ramen! Score!) I left out the bean sprouts, water chestnuts, oyster and chili sauces. I added mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, extra 1/2 cup of water and a teaspoon of corn starch. Very good one bowl dinner!

This was excellent, hubby approved!  Based on other reviewers, I too doubled the sauce.  I even reserved some of the boiled ramen water just in case the dish got dry, only because I've had issues with dry ramen dishes before.  Good thing, since I ended up needing it.  BTW, regarding the sauce, I went ahead and mixed all the sauce ingredients ahead of time (including the boiled ramen water) then poured it over everything at the end to be sure it was flavored evenly.  Also, went vegetarian, so no chicken, used green onions instead of regular onion, and added bok choy and celery.  Delicious, very flavorful! A definite keeper when we're craving ramen! Thank you!

This was a delicious starting point. I made 2 packs of beef raman and used beef strips instead of chicken. Added a little more oyster sauce and sriracha sauce. Added ginger. It was delicious and definitely will make again.

This was very easy and surprisingly good (but I tripled the chili garlic sauce). The rating is for the concept, sauce, and ease. The vegetables listed sound delicious but I had to switch things up to use the vegetables I had in the house (broccoli, onion, mushrooms, celery, carrots, snow peas, and cherry tomatoes). Also, instead of chicken I sauteed some marinated tofu and added it at the end with the tomatoes. Delicious and oh so easy.   It definitely helped the flavor that I had marinated the tofu ahead of time.  It makes two very generous servings or three normal ones.  UPDATE:  I tried it again with chicken — it’s better with tofu. Also, it could have used some cornstarch the second time I made it (I slightly increased the sauce).

It's a great recipe, you can add what veggies  you like. Don't over cook the noodles. And add the noodles last. I used more garlic and extra oyster sauce.  Add plenty of salt and pepper.

Idiot proof and tasty.  Avoid the no stick pan though as the high heat will just kill the surface. Thank goodness I have a properly seasoned cast iron fry pan.

Great recipe for the entire family. My girls (9 and 14) ate it up. Although the bean sprouts were new to them they enjoyed the dish. I prepared it as directed here.

I loved the idea of adding ramen noodles to an easy weeknight stir fry!  I did change it up by marinating the chicken in my usual stir-fry sauce mixture of soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sriracha, garlic and ginger.  Then used the reserved marinade in place of the water & other sauce ingredients at the end but still added about half to three quarters of the ramen seasoning packet.  The best part of stir fry is using whatever veggies you have on hand.  (I had asparagus, red bell pepper, bean sprouts, cabbage and onion.)  Delicious!  Next time I think I'll add two packets of ramen for even more noodly goodness!

I did not have any beansprouts so I cut up a yellow and a red
pepper and added them.  I added harissa rather than sriracha sauce because that is what I had.  I doubled the recipe.  We really enjoyed it-very tasty.

Made it with Stir fry steak strips instead of chicken, I think it’s pretty good, but my boyfriend thinks it’s just okay, I think rearranging some of the order would help. It took longer than 30 total.

This was an interesting dish with good flavors, but just a tad too much salt that I presume came from the seasoning packet.

Quick, easy, and very tasty.   I had no broccoli or beansprouts, so I used red pepper and kale as those were the veggies I did have.  I doubled the sauce.

Super easy and very tasty. I omitted water chestnuts and added tons more broccoli, red peppers and mushrooms.  Ramen noodles are a different twist than rice, family loved it will definitely make again!

Very disappointing!   I doubled the recipe but this was SO bland!  Ramon Noodles got too soft sitting in the chicken/broccoli.  Will try it again but more spices next time and will serve the noodles on the side.

I didn't have half of the ingredients so I had to improvise. I used fresh baby  spinach instead of broccoli, I had no chili or oyster sauces....I used baby carrots and pea pods, and it was still so delicious...my picky hubs had seconds!! I will definitely make this again,  Thanks for this fantastic recipe! I did add the tomatoes at the end, tasty!

I loved the idea of this recipe, but it wasn't quite as great as I had hoped.  It was very very bland - it is under-seasoned in my opinion if you follow the recipe directions.  I am going to try to make it again and I may try doubling or tripling the seasoning and seeing if that helps.

4 stars due to how quick and easy this is to make. One of my kids really liked it, and I liked it as well. It's a quick, nutritious, flavorful meal.
