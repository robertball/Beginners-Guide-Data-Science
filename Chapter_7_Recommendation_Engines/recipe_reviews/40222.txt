These were good, but I agree, they needed more spice.... maybe sprinkling more seasoning on right before you serve them?

The chicken was definitely a bigger hit in my house!  I used olive oil instead and added the juice of one lime to the marinade.  I also used 1/2 green bell pepper and 1/2 red bell pepper for extra color. Be a little generous with the seasoning for more of a "kick" or throw in a little jalepeno.  Everybody had extra helpings along with guacamole, sour cream, and always use FRESH salsa!

Thank you!  This recipe is simple but wonderful!  My husband and I make these several times a month.  Tastes good with chicken but best with steak.  We saute plenty of onions and green peppers.  Let steak marinate in frig while cutting veggies and getting everything else ready.  We cook steak and veggies separate, and warm fajita wrappers.  Then just add sour cream and salsa.  An addictive meal.  We always make extra for left overs. I don't think we'll ever get tired of this one. Thanks again!

I used this recipe with chicken for a Cinco de Mayo party, and everyone really liked it. One of my guests said, "I smelled this coming up to your condo and I really hoped that's what we were having!" I used cider vinegar as that is what I had, and before it was done I worried about the vinegar overpowering the other tastes, but that didn't happen at all. It was really good.

These are a great and a nice change from others marinades.  I do like to add a little bit of lime juice though.  I also cook the maranaide with the meat for extra sauce.  You can also adjust the seasoning depending how spicy you like it.

My family really enjoyed these fajitas. I prepared the meat in the early afternoon and let
marinade for about 3 hours.  They were delicious!!!

Actually, I would give it 3.5 stars.  Better than three, but not quite four.  First of all, I used shirt steak,  By far the most tender cut, and the most suitable for fajitas.  I've also used chicken.  I don't care much for sauteed meat in fajitas.  To me, a truly authentic (or should I say "classic") fajita is fire-grilled.  I also don't think that the use of red wine vinegar lends itself well to fajitas.  Last time I tried it with lime juice and it was better.  The vinegar was too tangy and tasted just like, well, vinegar.  But we have enjoyed these with the changes.  The recipe as given is just okay but not great.

Delicious.  I did reduce the amount of veggie oil, and I used chicken instead of steak.  Hubby liked it  A LOT.  Thanks for the post.

I love these!  I let the steak marinate all afternoon and they are simply wonderful. My husband also loves the smell of them when he walks in the front door. I've made these several times now and each time I swear they are better and better.

This turned out great.  I used Epicure Fajita Seasoning instead of McCormick because that's what I had.  I also used two bell peppers instead of one.

A healthy meal with rich flavor. When there's no time to marinade, I add extra seasoning while in the skillet and it still comes out very good.

I added some fresh mushrooms, sauted, and served it with fresh avocado slices, sour cream, salsa, and sharp cheddar. I do not particularly care for the fajita seasoning, it seemed rather bland.  Maybe it would help if the meat was grilled... I will not be making these again

Good favor and yummy! We thought this recipe was fabulous on chicken and will make it again.  We grilled the chicken breasts on the BBQ grill whole and sliced them after they were cooked.  I pan cooked the onions in butter.  We did try some beef too, but I certainly had the wrong cut of meat because it was tough as bricks (unfortunately I don't remember what I got).  I highly recommend asking your butcher for advice on the right cut of meat for fajitas - I will do that next time.

I made these for a Cinco de Mayo supper club, and I got rave reviews and several people asked for the recipe.  Extremely easy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The recipe did seem to complement the chicken better than the beef.

Yummy!  I used chicken and gave this a hefty dose of Montreal Spicy Steak Seasoning also from McCormick. I served it with black beans and guacamole which made excellent side dishes. My husband and I really enjoyed this.

I don't have to go out for my favorite fajitas anymore! These are SO great. I made it with the sirloin - added the beef with all of the marinade to make it saucy, added sliced mushrooms and about 1/4 cup red wine while cooking.  Unbelievable and unforgettable!

Definitely tasty fajitas.

Nothing knocked my socks off enough to get the extra star, though.

Good, easy recipe.   Use good quailty meat, of course.

This recipe was a big hit with my husband!  I added a red pepper and a green pepper and a bit more seasoning and it turned out great.  I think it would be even better if you let the chicken marinate over night!  Definitely will make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe was very good! However, it was not nearly as delicious as resturant style fajitas, but probably as close as you are going to get for a do it yourself recipe. I did add another 2 tsp. of fajita seasoning for added flavor. Overall I would have given this recipe 4.5 stars. I will make it again in the future!

This is a simple and delicious recipe! Both me and my husband loved it! It goes great with pico de gallo & homemade salsa. For a little extra spice, I add a few habenero peppers to the mix.

This is a good quick meal!  We had friends over one night to watch a game and served these for dinner, and they thought I had spent all afternoon on them!

These fajitas were great! I was in a hurry when I made them, so I forgot to marinate the meat in the oil/vinegar mixture, but they still turned out great! Next time I will remember to marinate, and they should be even better!

My boyfriend liked this alot. He said the flavor was different (vinegar) than the usual fajitas, but really enjoyed it! It was easy & quick to prepare, however I gave it four stars, because 1/4c of oil seemed too much.

These were fantastic.  I only used 4t of the fajita seasoning and poured the marinade over the chicken and veggies while they were cooking.  Soooo good!

Hmm, I don't know if I did something wrong, but these did not turn out that well for me.  I don't like this cut of meat for fajitas, because it just doesn't taste right compared to what I've had in restaurants.  Oh well, I won't be making this again.
