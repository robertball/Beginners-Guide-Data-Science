Really great recipe. For those who thought it was too hot, then read the recipe first. 1 tablespoon of red pepper would equal hot stuff!! NEways, I used it on ribs, burgers and hot dogs and had a little left so I dipped some chips in it. Could not get enough of this!!

This is just like the sauce my Uncle from Georgia used to make.  I did cut back on the red pepper, though.

This is definately not one of your sweet ketchup based sauces.  If you like the carolina vinegar sauces, you'll like this one.   I ran out of tomato paste so I ended up using tomato sauce and cooked it down, also cut down on the red pepper by half and it was still plenty hot.

This is seriously HOT sauce, not at all for kids (and I even cut back on the pepper!) I haven't ever eaten sauce in Georgia, but I doubt that it is this hot. But if you are looking for a sauce that tastes like vinegar on fire than you'll like this...

You need to warn that this makes a very spicy hot barbecue sauce.

With certain modifications, this is an excellent sauce: we cut the red pepper by a third, and increased all of the other spices. We still found that the tomato paste flavor was overwhelming, so we tamed it by adding a little more sugar (but not much, this is not supposed to be a sweet recipe!), a little bit of spicy mustard, and a splash of bourbon. The flavors came together very, very well.

Very easy recipe, but a little too spicy for me.  I didn't have the red pepper and substitued cajun instead...I think I won't do that next time.  Would recommend!

The red pepper needs to be cut back a bit and sugar should be added a little along to taste--other than that, this sauce is comparable to those of the south and reminds me of some of the sauces from restraunts in Alabama such as Dreamland Barbeque in Tuscaloosa, AL.

way too hot, it actually burned my eyes, nose and mouth.  I added everything I could find to try and tame this sauce.  I like spicy things, but his was toooo much.

I was hoping this was like the sauce I remember eating when growing up in GA.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews rather than the name!  This is very hot with a strong taste of tomato... not what I would call having a good flavor.  I tried to doctor it up, but it was a lost cause.

I loved this, my family loves this, and my DH who HATES BBQ sauce ( I have to cook his ribs seperately, without BBQ sauce) said he loved this, and asked for chicken tonight. I made a couple changes, I added about 2 T more sugar, actually I used xylitol, thus bringing down the glycemic load/ carbs.  And I also added about 1.5 t hickory smoke flavoring. Also, I only added 4 shakes of red pepper, and it was still toooo hot, so I doubled the batch ( we have 8 children, so it will go fast) to 'water it down', so be CAREFUL with the red pepper! Wonderful low carb BBQ sauce!

My family and I loved it. But when you make this sauce be sure to limit the salt and red pepers if kids will be eating it. This sause is great for family meals, adding barbeque sauce intensifys the flavor.

I made this for the Slow Cooked Pork Barbeque recipe from this site.  This sauce was "out of this world".  I will be making this sauce over and over again.  It's a real keeper!

WOW! That's really tangy. I liked it but worried my kids might think the flavor was too bold but I was wrong, they LOVE it!

Close to Mom's North Carolina BBQ sauce.
Whoever said it was not for kids does not know mine. Sorry, it is not at all "Hot" Has a bite yes, but my grandson eats spicier than this. He is 5 years old.

We love this sauce!  It is really spicy, but if you like spicy food, it is great.  We like it on BBQ pork, for pulled pork sandwiches.  My husband and grown children can not get enough of it.

Wow this wasent bad at all! I usually balk at vinegar sauces, but I made this one about an hour ago and loved it! I ommited the red pepper since I dident have it on hand, and added onion and garlic. I was thinking maybe a little bit of liquid smoke and honey would also make some interesting add ons to this great sauce.

P.S. My hubby used it on his steak and I used it on my chiken, and we both really liked it!

DELICIOUS!  I will admit to cutting the salt down more than halfway, but it was great.  I doubled the recipe for 6 pounds of shredded pork and it was just perfect!

This is a good basic recipe for those of us who do not like "sweet" barbeque sauce. However, I used 2 sticks of butter and cut the red pepper in half. Even then, you have to taste test and add ingredients as needed. If it has too much vinegar, I add more sugar. If it is too tomato tasting, I add a little more vinegar. I end up adjusting each batch I make. But, it is a great base to start with.

I really like sauces on the hot and spicy side with a spike of vinegar so this is fantastic.  I have made this recipe many times and apply it to any and all of the "BBQ meats" but today I discovered that I really like it as a Taco sauce too!  Be adventurous.  Thanks!

I love a spicy sauce, butI did not care for this recipe.
