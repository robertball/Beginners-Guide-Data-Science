The onion is too sharp for my taste. Maybe if it was sauteed before adding to the dish. The cheese & mayonnaise makes it very greasy.

WOW now this is just great. my dish turned out soooo good and not greesy at all so i'm not sure what some ppl are talking about. I sprayed the dish with pam and used low fat mayo and i added a few slices of swiss cheese on top only because i had some. i also used only half an onion. We r so exited to have this recipe. thank u so much

Good flavor but my husband complained that it was not creamy enough...he thought it resembled quiche more than a dip.

I made this for a party and I served it with bagel and corn chips. It was quite a hit! I added 1/2 a jalapeno pepper to the recipe to give it a little kick.

It was a hit! Greasy yes but I think that comes from the cheese and the butter you grease the dish with. Very good!

Oh my gosh is this yummy! I doubled the recipe for a potluck for a women's bowling league that I belong to. Women all night long were asking me to write down the recipe which is so easy that I did. Pretty much the dish was licked clean. I didn't even have a spoon-ful to share with my family!

When I made this i thought the onion would be to much and to strong so instead I used one shallot. I also used one quarter cup cream cheese and three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise instead of just one full cup of mayonnaise to make it creamier and cheesier. I also added paprika and some dried herbs such as oregano basil and onion powder. I found it to be creamy and delicious!

This was awesome and very easy to make. Smelled so good while it was cooking. Next time I'm going to try it with some hot pepper cheese. Yummm.
