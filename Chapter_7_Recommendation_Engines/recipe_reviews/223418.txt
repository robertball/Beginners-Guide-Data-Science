This was an awesome stew, I added in some diced baby red potatoes and swapped the beer for some clam juice for extra seafood flavor!

Wonderful recipe! Spices were spot on. I didn't have zucchini so I added a red and green bell pepper. Only other things I changed was a pinch of sugar (about a teaspoon) to offset acid of tomatoes and added a few shots of Tapatio hot sauce. I simmered for 40 minutes and then added catfish for another simmer for 30 minutes. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I live in New Orleans so I adjusted this recipe to cater to a more Creole flavor palette instead of a Northeast one, so this rating is based on the changes I made. First I started by saut√©ing the onions, garlic, and added a chopped bell pepper and three celery rinsing. The carrots got left out. I subbed the beer with clam juice and used generous helpings of thyme, dried parsley, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's) for the spices (the clam juice and Tony's were salty enough that no salt was needed!) Instead of the garlic chili sauce I used a Louisiana-style hot sauce. I used frozen corn instead of canned, but I might just forego the corn next time. It wasn't bad, but didn't seem to add much. It came out so delicious!

The soup is very good. I didn't have any chile-garlic sauce so I put 2 tsp of chili powder and tsp of vinegar and a couple more cloves of garlic. It turned out to be a little too spicy but i don't want to knock the recipe for it.

I made this recipe and we loved it.  I used Swai instead of catfish, because that's what I had.  I added shrimp to the left-overs which was a good idea.

This was ok, but not great on flavor. Maybe it would have been better without the zucchini and a little more spice. As written it is just not great.

Definite keeper. I used 1.5 pounds of swai for a milder flavored fish, and added a bottle of clam juice instead of water. Probably will use half the Sriracha hot sauce to please my wife. Flavor was terrific. Everything else was as prescribed.

Very tasty. I mostly followed the recipe, but as others did, I substituted a little. Just add as much spice as you want. A little chili powder, some red salsa, sirracha, whatever.  Added some scallops, shrimp and oysters. Very much like a seafood soup we had in Baja. Yum

This turned out great!  I have no doubt following the recipe as written would have been even better.  Because I didn't have some ingredients, I omitted the beer, used from my garden, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, a jalepeno pepper  and minced garlic, in place of the chili garlic sauce and some basil and parsley.  I used cod fillets that I had on hand and this soup didn't last long.  It is on the list to make again and again.

I used Cod instead of Catfish (because that's what I had on hand). Also, I diced the stewed tomatoes before adding them.  I used all other ingredients per the recipe. This is a delicious, healthy main course and pairs well with spinach salad.

It was delicious.  Of course I went with some of the suggestions from other reviewers.  2T of Old Bay instead of 3T and some shrimp.  Also, we didn't have the right beer at home, so we ended up using a summer fruit/vegetable shandy. Everyone loved it! Can't wait till our next fishing day.

WOWZA - this was delicious and spicy!  I'm sure your version is 5 stars +.  The only reason I gave it 4 was that I made quite a few adjustments because I'm on a diet and wanted to cut out as much fat and salt as I could without destroying the recipe.  I replaced the beer with fat-free reduced sodium broth (chicken), omitted the butter, reduced the Old Bay seasoning from 3 T to 2T, and omitted the sea salt and chile-garlic sauce.  I replaced the sea salt with 1T of Perfect Pinch savory seasoning.  Instead of the chile-garlic sauce, I added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  It was plenty spicy for me - I absolutely loved it.  I'm saving this to make again when the weather gets cold - YUM.  Thank you so much for sharing!
