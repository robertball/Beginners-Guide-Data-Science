This recipe is similar to  Paula Deen's and I have her cookbook, I think with the except of the choc. chips it is the same as hers. Maybe I did something wrong but I did not like this. My husband, who doesn't know it has velveeta in it, didn't like it either. It has a weird consistency and wasn't as sweet as traditional fudge. Sorry, I think I will stick with the traditional. I didn't even take a pic, just threw it in the trash ): Very disappointed, I don't see how so many people have raved about fudge with processed cheese in it.

I have yet to make this recipe, but I just had it at a party and it was INCREDIBLE!  I couldn't believe it when they said there was Velveeta in it!  I am definitely adding this recipe to my collection.
