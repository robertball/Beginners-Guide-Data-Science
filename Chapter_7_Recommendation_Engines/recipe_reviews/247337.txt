Not a favorite.  My first time with eggplant.  Should have used more oil when frying the breaded slice.  Thinly slicing fresh mozzarella was not easy.  Recipe said heat in oven but don't let the cheese melt...didn't look like the photo.  Served it with a spaghetti sauce with some crumbled turkey.

Not entirely bad, but definitely turns out better by pan frying with a little bit of oil. A seasoned Ricotta cheese with chopped basil in place of the mozzarella and basil leaf is also a nice alternative.

Loved it!  It is a beautiful presentation, most importantly  flavor was great, and very easy to prepare!  I added a little fig balsamic on the top and my whole family loved it!

It was a nice change of pace but I still prefer the traditional eggplant parm.
