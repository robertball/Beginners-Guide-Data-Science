Will try this again, with all of the ginger and tomatoes (I was a bit shorthanded).  It was a bit thinner than I expected.  Definitely use all of the salt recommended.  Family liked it when it was served with a couple of chutneys on the side.

I loved this for a change. Next time I will personally season heavier, but that could be a personal taste. We loved having our own personal Indian night at home. I made this along with Serendipity Bread (also on this site) which is a grilled flat bread. Yummy!

I found chana dal in my produce store so I knew I had to make this.  Tasty and easy.  I added spinach and a dollop of  yogurt to a few servings of this.. delicious both  ways.  Will be good cold weather comfort food
