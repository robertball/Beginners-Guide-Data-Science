I read the previous reviews and made a few changes based on what ppl were saying about it not having flavor.
Instead of sauteing the squash in butter, I cooked one slice of bacon in a non-stick pan first and then sauteed the squash in the bacon drippings. I also added a big pinch of ground thyme to the squash mixture.
Instead of cooking the ground beef with jalapenos, I stirred in a drained can of Rotel tomatoes after I mixed in the eggs and mayonaise.
It was GREAT! Even my husband, who does not like squash, loved the casserole! (of course I didn't tell him it was in there!)

Very good recipe for a bumper crop of zucchini squash. I didn't have mayonnaise but found sour cream worked well. The hot peppers gave the dish a nice spicy flavor.

This was better than delicious!  I realized when preparing the recipe that I was out of mayonnaise so substituted with sour cream - then realized I didn't have ground beef, and substituted with ground turkey - both were - and wonderful.  My Beloved and I ate over half the entire casserole and have set plans to finish it off tonight.

This was easy to make and very good.  My husband loved it!  It could use a tad more flavor, but seasoning with a little salt and pepper will do the trick (and maybe garlic powder?).  This is also a great Atkins/low-carb recipe -- the only thing I had to omit was the crackers from the top, which I replaced with more cheddar cheese!  A welcome change from your ordinary meat and noodles casserole.

I have a finicky 14 year old daughter that will not eat vegetables, so I am always trying to come up with creative ways to sneak them in.  This worked.  Instead of slicing the squashed I grated it in the food processor to make it even less noticeable.  I also substituted 1 can of diced green chilies instead of the jalapeno's, because my family doesn't like things too spicy.

This was the best squash casserole I have ever tasted.  It was even a winner for those in my family who insist they don't like squash.  And, it is a terrific way to use up that bumper crop of squash from your garden.  I bought disposable aluminum casseroles and made extras for the freezer, too!

Can't eat spicy food?  I made this recipe without the jalapenos, using Italian-seasoned bread crumbs for the topping instead of crackers.  I was afraid it might be too bland, but it is now a new family favorite!

Great recipe!. My 9 yr old loved it!. I did not have jalapenos so I added about 1 tsp thyme and 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning for a kick. Also added a little pepper/garlic salt. 
Also used panko instead of crackers and drizzled butter over them. Thanks Liz!

Needed something...  I know!  Flavor!  Claims to be spicy, NOT even!  It sounded like it would be really tasty (love casseroles) but was very bland.  Leftovers went straight to the trash.  Won't make this again.  Good dish for fussy kids, bad dish for adults.

My husband and I loved this dish!  I used chayote squash instead of yellow because it was on sale.  I also used ground turkey and only one egg.  It wasn't really very spicy, but it tasted really good.  My husband hates squash, but he thought this was good.

Excellent!!! Used winter Banana Squash and sliced and browned Italian sausage, a can of diced green chilis, "Mexican seasoning" and extra cheese (of course!~~) and was wonderful! Also, I put just a little bit of shredded cheddar on top of the cracker crumbs for added "eye appeal". Will share recipe as well as make for church potlucks. Thank you!!

I was weary about trying this...but I love summer squash so I gave it a whirl. Very good! I always season my squash with soy sauce so I did that. I didn't have fresh Jalapeno's, but used about 1/4 cup chopped jarred ones instead. I used egg beaters instead of eggs and added a can of petite diced tomatoes. Omitted the bread crumb topping and added more cheese about 15 minutes before it was done baking. My roommate and I LOVED this! I will definitely make this again!

Hubby's absolute favorite comfort food. I do not slice the squash;  typically I use zucchini, and employ a chopper that dices into narrow rectangles; I do cheat and use a can of chopped jalapenos instead of fresh;and when out of crackers I have used Italian bread crumbs (with a light spritz of butter spray) with equal success. But the combination suggested for the casserole  is perfect.  I am nervous, but I am going to try to double the recipe for a potluck-- wish me luck!

This was a good recipe. I added some garlic while cooking the squash for a little extra flavor. I didn't have any crackers so I used bread crumbs and sprinkled extra cheese on top. Then I broiled it for the last 4 minutes to make the cheese a little crispy. Next time I will add some extra jalapenos since we like it spicy.

Well, this was a hit with my finicky step-dad! I didn't use jalapenos because he doesn't like spicy, but instead cumin and paprika. It was a bit bland for my taste, but perfect for him. I also used spagetti squash and precooked it in the oven for 20 minutes before sauteeing.  Was tasty and will probably make again!

I thought I was chopping up jalapenos, but they were really  hot, hot peppers, that my husband got from a cajun woman at work. I doubled the recipe and thought that the peppers were small so I chopped up 6. My husband asked how many of the peppers I chopped up, and after he quit laughing he said I hope we can eat it. But after it was all said and done, he said not to change a thing! LOL Now, my 4yr old didn't touch it, but the adults loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Very goo but I made it with Zucchini and yellow squash and added some lemon and garlic to it while it sauteed. I also layered it instead of mixing it, but will try it mixed next time I make it. I think  it was very good and has room for improvement. I can't wait to make it again.

It was pretty easy to make, and it tasted very good.  It felt light and healthy, no heavy feeling after dinner.  I added a little bit of blue cheese to it, which my husband loved.  Also, i didn't have jalapenos, so i added red pepper seeds instead, and it tasted great.  Good job!

Nice squash recipe.  I used 2 zucchini & 2 yellow squash.  Also used 2 Sweet Italian Sausages with the casings removed and cooked sausage crumbled.  Like others I used lowfat sour cream instead of mayo.  Will make again, especially for a potluck dinner.

I have made this recipe more than 10 times and it always gets rave reviews. You can use any ground meat.  I have tried turkey, beef and Italian sausage (bulk not link) with great results.  I gave it four stars because of the need to add additional spices.  I always add garlic. Today I also added 1 T. of fresh basil.  Sometimes I add fresh thyme.  It depends on what looks good in the herb garden.  I also use Serrano peppers instead of jalapeno because we like them better than Jalapeno.  Because we like things extra spicy, I leave the seeds in.  When making it for another family, I seeded the peppers.  When entertaining vegetarians, I left the meat out and added a couple of extra squash.  They all loved it.  Spice this recipe to suit your family's taste and it's definitely a keeper.

Sorry, but this needs flavor.  I tried the Rotel, too.  It probably helped, but not enough.  I will not be trying this again.

No onion so I added onion flakes with the squash and onion salt with the beef. Added a zucchini to compensate for onion mass. I don't like jalapenos nor did I have any so I put some paprika in with the meat. I added garlic salt and Italian seasoning with the squash that I sauteed in bacon grease. Per other suggestions, I substituted mayo for sour cream and topped with cheese and crumbled townhouse crackers. It really turned out good and my family liked it.

I made this for my Sister and I last night for supper. So tasty..we raved over it. What a winner recipe and so easy to make. The only tweaking I did was putting a little bit of the jalapeño juice in the casserole and left out the jalapeños themselves. I just wanted the flavor and not the heat. Great recipe...I will definitely be making this again real soon. Thank You

This was really good. I used a small can of diced jalapenos instead of fresh, and substituted turkey burger for ground beef, and only used one egg.  I plan to make a couple more batches and freeze them because I need to use up our yellow squash. Thanks for the recipe! I shared it with a friend also.

This is a great way to use yellow squash!  I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream.  I didn't have any jalapeños, so I added a small can of green chilies and some Badia seasoning.  I mixed one cup of cheese in with the other ingredients and sprinkled another half cup or so on top, and used a couple of tablespoons of bread crumbs in place of the crushed crackers.  The whole family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Good "base" recipe; I added my own substitutions which gave it some great flavor. I used leftover taco beef and instead of cracker crumbs I used crushed taco shells. Turned out okay - kind of dry though.

Instead of regular mayo I used garlic-herb lemonaise (Ojai Cook Brand).  This added a great flavor to the dish.  I served over some fresh baby spinach and orzo pasta.  Delish!

We really liked it, but had to make some changes since we have to eat gluten free.  First, as a prefrence, i used a can of undrained rotel rather than the jalapeno peppers. Instead of mayo i used a gluten free cream of mushroom soup.  I made as directed except topped with the cheese instead of crackers during the last 10 minutes or so of cooking. It was a hit!

This turned out great! I had a bunch of squash from my CSA, along with a pound of local ground pork so this was exactly the type of recipe I was looking for. I did half mayo, half low-fat cream cheese, kept some seeds in my jalapenos for additional heat, added garlic powder, thyme, white pepper, black pepper and plenty of salt. I could tell this recipe would need more seasoning by just reading it, which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. Very tasty and flavorful with the addition of some basic spices!

The reviews on this seemed to be really mixed depending on how you spiced up this very unspicy recipe. I took the opportunity to get rid of some Sazon Goya seasoning that I don't remember why I bought in the first place.  My husband commented several times on how good it was.  I wasn't crazy about the cracker crumbs, next time I would just use bread crumbs.

Great recipe. I did change a few things, used half the butter and light miracle whip to save a few calories. Also served it with chipotle hot sauce to sprinkle on top for a little more heat. My husband and I thought it was a keeper.

This just wasn't to our liking. The only change I made was in the cooking order. I sauteed the squash, onion, jalapeno together to keep all of their flavors and then browned my ground beef and drained it. I added a little Creole seasoning for oomph. While it wasn't bad, we all agreed it just wasn't something we will have again. Thanks anyway.
