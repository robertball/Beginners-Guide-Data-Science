OMYGOSH! I stuffed a tri-tip roast into the crockpot in the morning, went shopping, and came home to a wonderful aroma wafting through my house! Not only is this an easy dish, it has an outstanding flavor. The meat was done to perfection after eight hours and the au jus was to die for. I served on french rolls from this site.Since other reviewers had indicated it was a bit salty, I used half the Lite Sodium Soy Sauce and half the bouillon called for.I'm glad I did! It was wonderful! Thanks Gisele. This is a definite keeper in this house!

I've tried recipes similar to this and all are very good..one is not necessarily better than another, each is  good in its own way, with its own blend of flavors. This recipe differs from others with the herbs and soy sauce which give the meat and au jus a nice, beefy flavor just subtlely enhanced by the herbs. For those who question soy sauce as an ingredient, it is one of many secrets of great chefs, who occasionally use it in beef gravies, sauces, and reductions for flavor and color. I used fresh herbs rather than  dried since I have a kitchen herb garden, and fresh, minced garlic for the garlic powder. Other than these minor modifications I made the recipe just as written, and it was perfect...not too salty at all, as others have thought. Perhaps they didn't use enough water?  Great take on the classic French Dip, Giselle.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I have made this many, many times and my guests always rave about it. I use sodium reduced soy sauce based upon previous reviews. I serve it using two 6-packs of hoagies and cut each sandwich in half to make 24 mini-sandwiches. On each mini-sandwich I layer the meat and then top with a slice of provalone. Thanks for the great recipe!

I enjoy using my slow cooker, and this is a recipe I was really looking forward to.  In spite of the low rating, the flavour was actually not bad.  But I found that there were three key issues I had with the original.  My qualms were the following: 1. the type of roast wasn't specified.  For my first attempt I used a very cheap cut, which was too fatty, and the sandwiches were cloying.  I finally used a tri-tip, and it was fine.  This would have been good to know.  2. the slow cooking process seemed to mute the garlic flavour, drowning it out.  Again, after using fresh garlic, it really came to life.  3. When I used the bouillion, I found it too salty.  On the second attempt, I used homemade beef broth instead (low sodium consomme would have worked as well) and I enjoyed it much more.

This has to be the best French Dip recipe I have made.  I've lost tracked how many times I've made it but it is always a hit.  I use a 4-5 lbs chuck roast, rubbing it with garlic powder, seasoning salt, salt and pepper, then brown over the stove before adding to the slow cooker.  I saute one onion sliced in the drippings from browning the roast and add it to the slow cooker to help flavor the au jus.  After I pull the meat out, I turn the slow cooker on high to reduce the au jus.  To serve, I use crusty rolls, pile on the meat, add cheese of choice and add some of the cooked onion and sauted onions.  Easy but taste fantastic!

This is NOT your ordinary French Dip Sandwich! The mixture of soy sauce, rosemary and thyme gave it a unique and very different taste. Soooo flavorful... The meat just fell apart and stayed nice and moist in the crockpot. I used toasted hoagie rolls instead of the french bread and sliced each sandwich in half at an angle for easier dipping. Both my husband and I just LOVED these sandwiches, plus the leftovers were even better the second day! A definite keeper... Thanks Giselle! :)

This was really good... we used regular soy sauce (1 cup instead of the 1/2 cup called for) and 3 cups of water, and it came out pretty salty, so next time we'll use reduced sodium soy sauce. The flavor was excellent, though! Also, we had a lot of au jus left over, and I hate to throw it out, so instead, I started searching for a reipe I could use it in. I found "Quickie French Onion Soup" (also on this site) and used the left over au jus to make a DELICIOUS soup. I counted my au jus as the beef broth and the au jus gravy packet called for in the recipe as I had 24 oz. of au jus left from this french dip recipe. My best friend and I loved it, and even my husband enjoyed it, and he doesn't even care much for french onion soup! It's a great way to use that au jus you have left over... give it a try!

I tried this last summer and my husband said it was the best roast I'd ever made.  I tried the other recipe from this site (the one with beer & french onion soup) to compare them and then I made this one again last Saturday and this one definitely won, hands down! I made the french bread rolls from this site to make the sandwiches and it's a good thing I didn't invite anyone for dinner, because the two of us ate almost the whole thing!!!!!

This is a great recipe!!  I used a 5 lb outside round roast and seasoned it with Montreal Steak spice and garlic powder and browned it in a skillet with some olive oil.  I then put it in the crock pot and mixed the broth.  I used a large container of Sodium reduced Cambells beef broth, minced garlic instead of garlic powder and the full amount of soy sauce.  I used only half of the rosemary and time the recipe called for as I noted this was mentioned in other reviews.  I skipped the bay leaf (personal prefference).  I also added 1 package fo Lipton french onion soup mix.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and then switched to low for 4 hours.  I probably could have cooked on low for the 7 hours I had and the roast would have been done but I think that might be my crock pots personality!  The meal tasted great!!  I serveed it with home made hoagie buns still warm from the oven with sauted mushrooms and onions, and slices of sharp cheddar cheese, Mashed potatoes, and fresh raw veggies and dip.  Everyone loved it and the Jus tasted wonderful on the mashed potatoes and the sandwiches.  I will make this again sometime.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good French dip! As a personal preference, I reduced the rosemary as my family doesn't care for such a strong herb and used a mix of low sodium beef broth and water to cover the roast.  Served with a garlic mayo (1 cup mayonnaise and 2 cloves minced garlic that married for 8+ hours)and it was divine.  Thank you Giselle for increasing my list of favorites!

I used a 2-pound beef chuck shoulder roast.  Due to complaints of other reviewers about too much salt, I used lite-sodium soy sauce (next time I think I will cut the amount in half; not sure what I think of soy flavor in a French dip; don't know if that is normal or not!), a can of reduced-sodium beef broth (rather than the bouillion cube & water).  Did everything else as called for on recipe.  Served on toasted French hard rolls.  Meat was very tender and good.  Thank you!

The family didn't much care for this, and my husband is a French Dip fanatic.  I didn't think it was too salty, as other reviewers stated, but I did think the rosemary was too overpowering.  It was also very dry, but it could have been the cut of meat I used which was bottom round.

Great recipe!  As suggested, I cut the soy sauce amount in half and other than that followed the recipe.  There was plenty of flavor and it was salty enough with the smaller amount of soy sauce.  I served it with carmelized onions and it was awesome!  Thank you .

We loved this sandwich!  Because I used  a six pound chuck roast from Costco, I made 1 1/2 the amount of ingredients for the liquid mix, going a little short on the soy sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  After eight hours on low in my slow cooker, this was done to perfection.  I broiled the inner part of the rolls with butter and shaved Parmesan and then loaded on the Swiss cheese and meat.  We ate them with a combo of Inglehoffer horseradish and Philippe's mustard (from the famed restaurant in LA, home of the legendary French dip).  The au jus from the meat was just perfect after skimming fat from the top of the pot.  I would put this sandwich up against Philippe's any day!  Yum!

It's myyyyy turn now ..... THANK YOU, GISELLE!  This recipe is a BIG hit at my house.  I just made it last Monday - here it is Sunday and my husband picked up a roast & got out the slow cooker for me! 

I, too, lower the amount of soy sauce - but your recipe is so versatile, I find I can experiment if I'm out of some of the ingredients & it comes out AWESOME EVERY TIME. And so EASY.  Sometimes, when I'm out of french or hoagie bread, I just toast regular or wheat bread, whip up some mashed potatoes & serve it as an open-faced sandwich with the juice as gravy.  YUMMM! 

I've used a lot of recipes here at ALLRECIPE.com most of which my family enjoys & I use again.  But yours is committed to memory from my family's repeated requests. FIVE STARS without a doubt - more if there WERE such a thing. Again, thank you!

Wonderful! I took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit. I put the chuck roast in a dutch oven, covered with water and other ingredients. I skipped the garlic powder and used the real deal, along with an onion. I cooked it until it was tender - 4 hours or so.  I used partially baked scissor french rolls that I finished baking for 10 minutes or so. Sliced and spread with mayo, horseradish and mustard. I topped with provolone and grilled open faced until bubbly. Topped with beef, sauteed onions. Strained aujus and put in a fat separater - removing fat before serving. Superb!

This is quite good as written, but after making it a few times I think I've figured out how to make it perfect!  

First, rub the roast with garlic salt (or onion salt) and black pepper.  Then brown it well in a heavy pan before placing in the slow cooker.  

Deglaze the pan with the boullion mixture and scrape all the bits into the crock pot.  

Use only 1/2 teaspoon rosemary.  

Also, I'm usually getting this in a little late, so I cook it on high for a couple of hours before setting it to low.  

Finally, use a fat separator to remove the grease from the broth.  

We were trying to move to more meatless meals, but this is still making it into our rotation at least twice a month.  It's so totally worth it!

Since I've made this one five times now, I think I'll review it.  This is my go to recipe for any crock pot roast.  I always cook this as is.  I leave it for sandwiches, I  add to egg noodles with sour cream and cream of mushroom soup for a great main dish and I sometimes add peppers, onions and some brown gravy mix for roast beef poboys.  This is a great recipe by itself and great for adapting into something else too.  Thanks Giselle for posting!

Made this as is and I  thought it was great . I will make a double batch next time and freeze in sandwich size servings for a quick thaw in the micro. Be  sure and add plenty of the gravy to each bag.

Made this recipe last night. The meat flavor with the soy sauce, thyme,  rosemary, and bay leaf, was a refreshing change to most french dips that are made with just au jus mix or french onion soup. And yes tweaked it a little. I used a reduced sodium beef base called "Better than Bouillon" and a low sodium Soy Sauce. I also put the meat on fresh baked hoagie rolls instead of french bread. Since I like my French dips "loaded", I grilled some onions, peppers, mushrooms and topped the sandwich with the veggies, added a slice of provolone, and toasted the french dip in a oven to warm the bread and melt the cheese. All in all, the recipe made the meat and dip taste great. Thanks for sharing Giselle.

This turned out very well for me.  I used a cheap chuck roast and the whole meal was under ten bucks.  I did notice however, that using a cheap piece of meat to definitely let it go the full 12 hours and then it will just fall apart.  At ten hours it wasn't ready yet.  I only had about 1/4 cup of soy sauce and that worked well.  I put a splash of worcestshire in it and some herbs de provence, and two bouillon cubes.  It really only needs one cube, it was a bit salty which was my fault. I sauteed some peppers and onions and used pepper jack cheese for a different twist.  Next time I will use one cube, and use less soy sauce again and add the worcestshire.

Very good sandwich; I didn't have time to slow cook so I did this in the oven for about 3 hrs @ 325,took out the meat,shredded it,placed it on buns and topped them with baby Swiss cheese.I popped the sandwiches back in the oven for a few minutes until the cheese started to get soft. I served the au jus for dipping. My family loved it!

SO GOOD!!!!  Made this using 2 lbs instead of 4 lbs, but still kept the rest of the measurements the same.  Followed the recipe exactly except that all I had on hand was fresh thyme, so that is what I used instead.  Didn't have 10 hours, so put everything in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 6 hours & the meat was falling apart and super tender.  Threw it on some buns with plenty of swiss cheese and popped the sandwiches into the oven at 400 for a few minutes (just enough to melt the cheese).

Not something I will make again. The smell while cooking was not very appetizing and the juice did not taste well at all. The meat itself was ok if you got all the juice off but overall I was very disappointed for wasting a yummy roast on this recipe.

These sandwiches were awesome!!!  Only change I made was to use beef stock rather than boullion and water.  Put the prepared beef on steak rolls with some horseradish and provolone cheese and, of course, plenty of au jus to dip with every bite.  We will be having this again without a doubt!  Thanks for a great recipe.

The best French Dip sandwich you'll get anywhere!The broth has wonderful flavor. This is a great recipe for a crowd on game day. I toasted hoagie buns in the oven for extra crispness,placed some shredded beef on, added a slice of Mozzarella cheese & returned it to the oven open-faced to melt the cheese.MMMMMMMMMM

Soy sauce and rosemary was too overpowering.  Have tasted much better using beef, onion, s&p and aujus.  One out of six of us liked it.

This is such a simple recipe, yet so tasty. I used a 3.5 lb roast and let it cook on low for almost 10 hours. Used ciabatta rolls (which hold up nicely) and broiled quickly to melt the cheese on top. Yumm! Also want to note that I used 1 tsp of better than bouillon beef base.

Awesome beef for french dip, but the broth was WAY too fatty.  If you put it in the fridge and then skim off the fat it was pretty good.

This is VERY good French Dip.  I would suggest reducing the soy sauce or using low sodium because it was a little on the salty side per the recipe.  I didn't have a cube, but I used 1 tsp. of Better Than Bouillon with 2 cups of water.

My first clue that the recipe might not be right was the photo showing large chunks of french bread and some onions with the beef (yummy)...but the actual recipe did not call for either. Slices of french bread?? No onions? Beef so done it's brown? I've made better from the local store deli. Try beef paste mixed with water and minced green onions for the broth, with real French bread chunks and medium rare slices of roast beef. It's just so much better than this. Sorry!

This definately deserves a 5 star! It was fabulous! I followed recipe exactly except that i used low sodium soy sauce, cuz thats all i buy. Oh and I added a little water to make more au jus. SOO good, after 6 hours on low, i removed the tri tip, and sliced thin instead of shreading, Worked fabulous and the au jus was delicious!

If I could give this one no stars, I would. I love this site, usually "right on"! But if you are expecting your local pub french dip sandwich...forget it!!!! Maybe it's the spices, because the meat was very tender, maybe I expected something different. Good Luck.

I love the simplicity of this recipe, and the flavor is really good, too.  I made two small changes, though.  I added fresh garlic in place of powdered and I added two finely minced shallots as well, but not because I felt the recipe was lacking but rather because we just really enjoy the flavor of shallots.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll be making this one again and again!

My family said they liked it... but then they always say that.  I said "Holy Salt Bombs, Batman!"... but then again, I don't like salt that much.  I think if you are used to more salt, you may like this one.  I found that the soy sauce and bullion cube made it taste like beef jerky.  The broth is like liquid salt.  Some people like that.  I was also dissappointed because the meat seemed very very juicy until I shredded it and then it dried up like so much shredded shoe leather.  Oh well.  Maybe this one's just not my bag, baby.

Awesome!  I've tried both this recipe and the "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip" on this site, and this recipe wins hands down.  I used a bone-in roast and low sodium soy sauce but otherwise made no changes.  I can't wait to enjoy the leftovers.

This was such an easy and delicious way to make french dip!  I made it for my husband's birthday dinner, and the guests all claimed it was the best au jus they had ever had!  I caramelized some onions to go on the sandwiches, and also served them with slices of havarti cheese, which is divine on french dip!  The meat was perfectly tender.  My only adjustments: used lite soy sauce and a reduced-sodium bouillon cube.  Wouldn't change anything else!

I tripled this recipe to feed 20 adult kids... I used lower sodium soy sauce, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  That is what I do with every new recipe I try.  I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe when you make a bunch of changes...  The sandwiches got rave reviews... I had carmelized onions & mushrooms as well as provolone cheese to serve with them on  hoagie buns...

Incredible french dips!  My family raves about this one.  I make it every couple weeks.  I get hoagie buns, cut them in half, lightly butter them, sprinkle parmesan cheese on them, add a couple slices of provolone and toast in the broiler.  Definitely a family favorite.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

The sauce on this was fantastic with a few changes. I used 1/2 c soy mixed with 1 c beef broth. I chopped up 6 cloves of garlic and also added 1/2 envelope of italian dressing mix. I put it all in the cooker over high for 4.5 hours. I sliced it up thin and let it soak up the sauce for a few and it was AMAZING!!

Fabulous!  This recipe is a keeper!  Before putting it in the slow cooker, I dusted my meat with garlic powder and an herb blend, and then seared it in a pan of hot oil, something that I always do when I put meats in the slow cooker.  The only other change that I made was using a packet of low-sodium onion soup mix instead of the bullion cube, as this was all I had in my cupboard.  We did find the cooking liquid to be a little salty, but a little added water fixed that problem.  Next time I'll be sure to add more water to the slow cooker during cooking, as I don't think that I added enough this time.  Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe!

This recipe is so good, and so easy.  I love having something cook all day so when you come home it is ready to go.  Definitely need to make sure your roast is large enough for leftovers!

In a home like ours where people come and go like like cars at a toll booth, this recipe was spectacular.  It's the  kind of meal that family can eat when it's convenient.  The flavor of the beef and the au jus is fantastic.  "Hot Ham and Cheese Sandwiches," on the allrecipes website, contains a sauce/condiment recipe involving horseradish mustard, onion, butter, poppy seed, and dill seed, which I had available for the adventuresome types (me) to try with the beef on a sandwich.  It was a great condiment!  For many of my recipes, I use reduced sodium soy sauce, and it worked perfectly for these French dip sandwiches.  As usual, my fairly new slow cooker had this meat done on "low" setting after only four hours.  Keep this one around for the holidays ... or any days!

Loved this recipe!! I did change up a couple things. I used a 4 lb brisket I shredded the brisket (brisket does beautifully) and discarded any fat. I poured the beef broth into a bowl and put in the refrig so the fat would rise and discarded the fat easily from the broth that way.  NOW, for another yummy part to this recipe. I use bakery fresh french bread and top with provolone cheese then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of chopped green chilies to the sandwich then broil it for a couple minutes to melt the cheese. Ive never had anyone not eat everything on the plate!! NOW... another tasty idea if you happen to have leftovers... use them for breakfast!! Scramble up some eggs and cook until 1/2 way done then add in your shredded brisket (about 2 eggs to 1/2 cup meat). I top this with fresh homemade salsa or store bought salsa and salt and pepper to taste Wonderful breakfast!!! Enjoy!!

Thank you Giselle!  This was so wonderful.  I've tried the other French Dip with the beer and french onion soup (which was good), but this was superb!  I scaled down the recipe for a 2 lb. roast -- big mistake --  I wanted more!!!  The husband also said this was a definite keeper.  The ONLY change I will make is to ease up on the rosemary because it seemed to dominate the taste, but lends a wonderful flair.

I overcooked the roast the first time with this recipe, so it was a little dry, but next time I'm sure this recipe will turn out beautifully. The mixture of herbs and spices is perfect. Made my house smell wonderful! Great for leftovers.

I made this recipe with a Whole Boneless Beef Brisket, it was wonderful!!!  The meat just feel apart when it was time to take it out of the cooker.  The whole family enjoyed it.  One of my children hates sandwiches, but said it was soo good.  They want it again...they also said it would be great as a meal instead of a sandwich.

This was terrific-we had it with cream cheese stuffed mushrooms and cooked baby carrots.  The next day my husband made his sandwhich with some swiss cheese and BBQ sauce- that was great too!  You can't go wrong with this recipie.

My BF liked it a little bit, I did not. We both felt it needed garlic & onions for flavor. This recipe is good...but I need to add Lipton Onion Soup Mix & /or garlic & onions. It cooked perfectly on low for 10 hours, just not much flavor.

Good...but GREAT the next day! My meat didn't fall apart it stayed in a large hunk so I just sliced it and put it on a french baguette with Provolone and Horseradish sauce.  The leftovers were much tastier and the meat softened up even more.  Yum!

Made this last night and OhMyGosh was it Good! I am a food dipper and this recipe will be added to my family's rotation of favorite foods! The only things I did differently was, I only used 1/4 of a cup of soy sauce and I Caramelized some onions to put on my sandwiches, made up my sandwiches with meat, onions, and shredded mozzarella cheese. Then threw them in the oven on 450 till the cheese was just melted. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

A huge hit!  My family cobbled this up! I have a small family so I decreased the size of the roast to 2 1/2 lbs, but I left the other ingredients the same.   The meat was eaten straight away on fresh baked sub rolls, and there was no left over meat.  However, I had lots of the broth left over, so I packed it up and will use it in recipes calling for beef stock.  
Thank you so much for this recipe! This is a definite do-over!

This is the best recipe! I was out of French onion soup mix and so I was needing a recipe that didn't need it. I'm so glad I found this because I will never make a different recipe again! I did have to improvise on some of the ingredients because I didn't have exact plus I used some of the other reviewers advice and for these reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5. First I put salt pepper and garlic powder on the roast then browned it in olive oil. I moved that to the crockpot. Then I took the sauce ingredients and instead of mixing them in a bowl I mixed them in the pan I browned the meat in and got all the goodies left in the pan and then poured it in the crockpot. I also sliced p a half of onion and threw it in the crockpot as well. I didn't have the individual ingredients so I just used Italian Seasoning. Also I used Better Than Bullion instead of a bullion cube. I did 3 cups of water to 1tsp of base. I used the full amount of soy sauce and not reduced sodium and had no problem with it being too salty. Maybe because I used the Better than Bullioin instead of a cube.....I also didn't use bay leaves because I didn't have any. This turned out amazing and super tender! I didn't even have to cook it for the full 10 hours on low. It took about 8 hours instead. This will be my go to recipe from here on! Thank you!

Pretty tasty!  I toasted some French bread and added some provolone cheese.  It was done after about 8 hours.  I also added a few more peppercorns then the recipe called for.

Pretty tasty Giselle!  I used a can of beef broth instead of the bouillon cube and I think that made it less salty.  Like other reviewers, i used low sodium soy sauce as well.  Served on hoagie rolls that were too soft for my liking.. Next time I'll use a more substantial roll.  It is being dipped in jus after all.

AWESOME!  Served with sauteed mushrooms, onions and bell peppers, swiss cheese, provolone cheese, pepperoncini peppers, aioli and au jus.  Made it in the slow-cooker, cooked a 5 lb. roast on high for 7 hours. It could not have been better!  Thanks for a delicious, crowd-pleasing recipe!!!!

Super yummy! Be sure to use low-sodium soy sauce though or it will be way too salty. BF and I both really enjoyed this. Impressive as well!

Delicious!  Used a smaller roast since there were just 2 of us and my hot crock pot only took about 5.5 hours.  The meat was tender and just fell apart and the flavor and dipping au ju was very tasty.  I'll make again for sure.

My 5 year old said, "this is the BEST meat EVER! You have to cook it this way ALL the time." :-) So, it's a hit in the Newcomb household! I made some small adjustments like I used chicken broth instead of beef bouillon and eyeballed it, about 16 oz. of water, and some onion. Everything else was the same. Thanks for this amazing and simple  recipe!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!! I followed the directions exactly. Not too salty at all and my husband is real sensitive to salt. I did however put enough water to cover meat, I cooked about 3 pounds of tri-tip roast...very tasty! Thanks to my sister for sharing this recipe with me :)
I think the cut of meat you choose has a lot to do with how good it is. I would only use chuck roast or tri-tip roast...

This was a great crock pot recipe and wonderful for those cold winter days when everyone is tired after a day of work/school. The modification I did was use low sodium soy sauce, used fresh ground pepper and threw in an extra bouillon cube.  I only added 2cups of water to the soy sauce as the condensation from the crock pot pretty much made its own broth. After the roast was done I shreaded the meat and let it sit in the broth for about 30 extra mins. Then put it on French bread buns with swiss cheese over top then stuck them under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese. I used chuck roast this time cause thats what I had in the house. I think next time I'll use a better cut like a shoulder or arm but I think thats just individual taste.

This was easy to prepare and my family enjoyed it.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Next time I may reduce the soy sauce.  My husband ate the leftovers on top of mashed potatoes.

Wow! Never thought we'd be able to have a french dip sandwich again without a very long plane flight after moving back to Australia. Thank you so much for sharing! Based on other reviews I dropped the soy and went the low sodium option, however ended up having to up the beef stock cube quota at the end because the jus just wasn't there. A littl extra stock powder at the end really kicked it up in no time though. Going to try cooking the meat closer to 7hrs nex time - it seemed a little dry in the end, but still really tasty!  Thanks so much for sharing:)

These are good... But I have been trying MANY different French dip recipes and this recipe isn't exactly the best one. Another reviewer stated that the ajus was "beefy" and that is a great description. It was amazing roast but the ajus was really strong, beefy, hearty, even a tad to salty. I am however going to use this recipe for a pot roast in the future, but not a French dip. My fav so far: 4 lb pot roast. 2 envelopes French onion soup. 2 tsp sugar. 1 tsp dried oregano. 1 tblsp minced garlic. 2 cans (10.5 oz each) beef broth. 1 bottle (12 oz) dark beer. Cook on high 6-8 hrs. Try it out!

This was pretty good.  I might do a different cut of beef next time because even though I trimmed the fat there was a lot of fat in the cut.  The seasoning was dead on and I did not find it to salty.  Thanks for sharing this made for a nice busy night quick dinner.

What could be better than something so tasty and SO EASY?  Only additions were a bit of soy sauce and some fresh garlic with a healthy does of black pepper.  Whole family enjoyed them.  Will absolutely be making again!

I LOVE this recipe - a friend gave it to mee and I'm so happy to see it on Allrecipes! (It makes it easier for me to share it!)  My only complaint is the time it takes to shread the meat - but I make a huge batch of this and freeze in a meal-sized portion (usually in a ziploc quart bag, frozen flat).  Makes a great 10minute heat& serve meal on another busy night.  I use the thin baguettes (like 2.5-3 inch across) for the bread 0 it's the most cost-effective.

If you are thinking of changing something in this recipe, DON"T!  It is PERFECT exactly as written.  The people who complained of this being too salty must not have added enough water.  I used a 3 3/4 lb bottom round roast (rump), followed the recipe to a tee, and added probably 4 to 4 1/2 cups water.  I just can't say enough good about this recipe.  I used Pepperidge Farm French bread, swiss cheese, a little mayo and carmelized onions.  Our family thought this was a great combo!  Try this, you won't be disappointed!!!  I forgot to tell you...I didn't have time to cook this on low for 10 to 12 hours so I ended up cooking on HIGH for about 7 or so hours and it came out fine.

Sooo good! We used a 2 lb roast and cooked in the crock for 3 hrs on high and an addition 1.5 hours on low.  It made plenty for our family of 5, I can't even imagine having 4 lbs! Next time we'll add some provolone and broil open faced in the oven just 'til it starts to melt. That should make it fantastic!

Made this recipe for a party.  Everyone loved it - especially the men.  I did make one change, I omitted the bouillon and substituted beef broth for the water.  Next time, I might try 3/4 tsp rosemary.  Oh, and I just ground some regular black pepper in with the other spices instead of the whole peppercorn.

I made this for Solstice dinner and did not change a thing. I added water twice, I think that made me not have a problem with saltiness. I also flipped the meat in the crockpot twice. I served this with grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, and provolone cheese. It was a huge hit.

Oh, BROTHER...was this the best French Dip Sandwich I have ever had, or what?!  I followed the recipe almost to the letter...due to some of the reviews I read, I decided to use low-sodium soy sauce and half of the beef bouillon, and it was just fantastic!  I also used just a splash of dry red wine to the au jus, and some fresh garlic.  My husband doesn't really care for French Dip sandwiches (and, he is the fussiest, pickiest eater I have ever cooked for in my life!) but the smell almost drove him wild as it was cooking, so he decided he would try just 'one'.  The man ate four in a row, and almost waddled away from the table!  I have put this into my rotation, and will make it again and again.

I love this recipe.  I found it years ago and have made it too many times to count!  Everyone that tastes it loves it!  I have to admit that I am spoiled to other French Dip recipes after this one - they just don't compare.  I even gave this recipe to my sister who also makes it regularly and her family loves it as well.  When I lost my recipe recently, I was so relieved to find that it was still on your website!  I don't know what I would have done otherwise! ;)

I used beef broth instead of the boullion cube & water and only 1/3 cup of soy sauce.  I also used 2 whole cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder.  The garlic just cooks away, and the meat is so tender, you don't even have to take it out to shred...  I just stirred it with a wooden spoon, and it falls apart.  I used to make it for my roommates on cold days in Indiana.  Made it for myself this week, and saving the leftovers for when my family visits this weekend.  Great easy recipe.  Thanks!

It was good.  I guess my family is used to the regular sliced beef from the deli for french dip.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

I was so tempted to alter this recipe: ie:low sodium soy, beef broth instead of water, add some onion & fresh garlic, etc. But, I wanted to try just as written. Other than being just a "tiny" bit salty, it was 5-star-good, without any changes/additions. I wasn't looking for an oriental flavor, and was quite surprised that the soy did not impart that. My roast (chuck that I trimmed well)was 5 lbs and still partially frozen and I wanted to serve in 8 hours, so I used my high setting for 8, instead of low for 10-12. Was perfect: shredded nicely but not mushy/overcooked. Served it on toasted, & rubbed-with-fresh garlic, hard rolls: topped with swiss cheese and then broiled.  This is a keeper as written except, I will use low sodium soy next time,is all. Thank you, Giselle. This is a great, EASY, and few ingredient recipe. And thank you, Recipe Exchange's "Sweetjam" for recommending.

This French Dip is amazing.  I make this the day before I need it because I like to walk away and forget it until the few prep steps the night before.  I used a beef sirloin roast for the low to no fat factor as well as the special occasion. I followed the recipe but added one bottle of amber beer.  My slow cooker also isn't "slow", so I prepared it by keeping it in the crock pot on warm for an entire Saturday.  I removed the roast when it was medium to medium well. Just a hint of pink when sliced.  I used an electric knife to get the meat as thin as possible.  I added the meat back into the juice and kept cool until the next day.  Sunday morning I turned the crock pot back on which finishes the meat completely and the meat was juicy and hot by lunch for our guests.  I carmelized onions and had provolone cheese on the side as optional additions.  I've served this twice and will be doing the same this weekend.

Followed the recipe exactly (used low sodium soy sauce). Outstanding! The flavor of the "au jus" is excellent - you would never know the base is soy sauce.

Minor adjustments: beef stock (no salt added) instead of water, triple the garlic, used fresh (1/3 added near the end), a pinch of sugar.  Cut tri-tip into smaller pieces as I got a late start.  Seared meat in hot skillet after seasoning with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  Caramelized onions and mushrooms in same skillet and then added to crock pot.  Added a couple of mini carrots to flavor the broth and they were like candy... gone in an instant and we fought over them!  Reduced broth.  Served meat on toasted Dutch Crunch rolls with Italian Blend (6 cheeses) melted on top.  
S.O. asked how many stars he was allowed to give it and then said... ok... I give it 6 stars!

Absolutely delicious!  I added some caramelized onions and provolone cheese, then stuck it under the broiler for a minute or two to melt the cheese and toast the bread a bit.  My husband and I devoured them!

This recipe is excellent, I have made this a few times, I honestly think it was best when I made it with a nice lean venison roast. The beef is nice too, remember your cut and quality of meat will effect your results. But all will be good it is simply a matter of good, better, best!

This recipe is awesome! I made this yesterday for the second time and the only thing I did differently was topped with provolone cheese and broiled until toasty brown! I also mixed some sour cream and horseradish as a dip! Yum! I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Wow.  I'm impressed.  I used beef broth instead of water and buillon, kept soy the same and it was fantastic.  I did generously add the spices, and also included some minced onion.  I did not find it too salty, but we're salt people.  I put it on toasted hamburger buns (had leftovers), and ate with a side of mashed potatoes.  Delicious!  Note:  recipe says "water to cover", which I took literally and added 2 cans of beef broth... mistake.  It only needs 1 can.. I came out with WAY too much "au jus".  Regardless... a good failsafe when roasts are on sale and you don't know what to do with them!

I had high hopes for this since my husband loves french dip sandwiches, but we really didn't like it. The flavor of the sauce didn't appeal to us...didn't enjoy the rosemary. Will keep looking for a recipe we like better.

French dip is my favorite sandwich and this recipe made probably the best French dip I've ever had.  I made it exactly according to the recipe and didn't find it salty at all.  And since I'm a rosemary and thyme fanatic, I loved loved the flavor!  I'll probably dream about it tonight!  I can't wait to sample the leftovers! A definite keeper.

My husband liked it, but I didn't at all.  I had added a cup of water hoping to reduce some saltiness, but it was so salty it hurt my tongue!  The au jus has a layer of fat on the top that you have to skim off but it still seemed too oily for me.  I'd prefer a seasoning packet next time I want au jus.

This recipe was very good. I took the advice of others and added 1/4 c. soy and 1/2 packet of italian dressing seasoning.

My only complaint is that even though I'm a BIG fan of rosemary, it made this recipe taste funny. Next time we make it, I'll leave out the thyme and rosemary.

Thank you Giselle!  I used two 2lb. roasts - bottom round and sirloin tip.  The sirloin tip tasted 'livery' and had a softer texture.  The bottom round is more like what you'd expect from a roast beef.  I'll be sure to use this recipe again.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I didn't have any beef bouillon cubes at home and forgot to buy some so I ended up using beef broth soup instead.  I think it could have used some Worchester sauce and I'm going to try it next time.  This is defiantly a recipe you can play with in order to please your tastes.

Absolutely amazing! I had seconds and my husband had thirds. My three kids all liked it too! I used a low sodium beef boullion packet and lower sodium soy sauce. The boullion has only 5 mg of sodium compared to over 1000 in a typical boullion cube. We felt it tasted perfect this way and there was no need to add extra salt. I will definitely be making this over and over again.

This recipe is very easy to make and so good!  After cutting the meat we put it on soft rolls with sauteed onions and swiss cheese.  We then put it in the oven until the cheese melted.

Fantastic taste and SO good!
I would suggest caramelizing an onion to go with the sandwiches and lightly toasting the rolls/bread.

This is a great recipe that you can make a lot of modifications to and still have it coming out tasty.  I followed the original recipe best I could, but made a few changes based on what I had handy in the pantry.  I used chicken bouillon instead of beef, added some worcestshire, and left out the rosemary and thyme.  Served on toasted french bread with swiss.  Very, very good - my husband is already requesting to have it again.

My family has loved this recipe for years.  One change:  1/2 cup worcheshire souce instead of bouillon cube.  We like the sauce so much I double it.  We always serve it with carmelized onions and whatever cheese we have on hand.  We use french bread type rolls that have been split, buttered and baked in 350 oven until brown and toasty.

Very good and easy. It was perfect for yesterday, cold outside, kids came home from soccer practice, and dinner was ready.  They loved it and thought it was neat dipping the sandwiches in the au jus. We used toasted hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.  My au jus was perfect- I think I added about 2 cups of water to cover the meat.  I used a 4 lb. brisket, because it was on sale, and it was great.  Pulled apart just fine.  I did not change a thing in the recipe- will make this again.

Saute onions and peppers to go on your sandwich.  And I use beef broth rather than bouillon (less salty) Makes enought for sandwiches one night and roast beef and pots another!  I love it!

I had a chuck roast that I just didn't know what to do with and wanted something different than the onion soup/mushroom soup recipe.  I found this recipe and adapted it by covering the meat with water and adding more beef boullion.  I thickened the broth to make gravy and served it with mashed potatoes.  It was delicious.  My family absolutely loved it!  The meat was very tender and the gravy was so flavorful.  Very easy recipe, and my kids asked me to make it again.  What more could you ask for?

I starting cooking it a 7 p.m. and cooked it overnight I woke up to the most wonderful smell.  I turned it off at 10 am and at 4 pm turned it back on to warm it back up and my family devoured it!

This was excellent!  I put in in at midnight..by lunch time it was ready for company and the house smelled great.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  The next day, I made deliciuos homemade veggie soup with the leftover meat!

We all loved it! I used fresh rosemary and thyme from my garden. Even though I used bullion I also used beef broth in place of water. Ajou turned out very good.

This was okay. I found it to be very rosemary-y, and not very french dip-y.  Probably won't make this again.

I also used a tri-tip roast, but instead of water, used veggie broth.  Also, I added a little Worcestershire and cooked on high for 4 hours.  Delish!  This will definitely be added to the meal rotation!

Moist and delicious, tender and flavorful. This got rave reviews when I made it as written. Served it on hard rolls with small bowls of au jus on the side for dipping.

Delicious!   My whole family loved it.  I used low sodium soy sauce & substituted beef broth for the bouillon & water since that's what I had on hand.   The mix of herbs & seasonings is perfect & the beef was wonderfully tender.  Served on toasted hoagie rolls.

This recipe has a good flavor. I didn't have peppercorns so used some black pepper. My husband is not a fan of pepper so I didn't add much. I think if I make it again I'd use a better quality roast. This was very greasy.

Very good French Dip.  I had a smaller roast (about 2 lbs), but still used the recipe amounts for the broth. I used half the amount of soy and then added the same amount of worcestershire, used a soup base instead of bouillon cube.  Added an onion chopped in large pieces (I love onion on French Dip sammies).  Because I had a smaller roast I had to use quite a bit of water, so I ended up needing to reduce the au jus a bit at the end.  That's okay, turned out fantastic.  The herbs help make this a delicious au jus.  By the way...I started the roast from frozen.  Works just fine.

I have made this recipe so many, many times. It is a favorite of ours. We've been making it for almost 3 years now. It is a HUGE fall back for us when we know we won't want to cook in the evening. Even without the rosemary (which I'm allergic to, we use basil instead), it is DELICIOUS. Try it! You won't regret it!

Way to heavy on the rosemary...didn't get much salt...meat didn't have much flavor, we should have used a dry rub and let it sit overnight then searing the sides...will try to save the meat by adding cheese, onions & peppers

This recipe has been a family favorite for about 5 years. The only change I make is using 1/2 bouillon cube and using reduced sodium soy sauce as we found it to be a bit too salty otherwise.  Enjoy! You will love this very tender and flavorful french dip and it will make your home smell amazing while it cooks, too!

This was really good though we thought the rosemary was a bit strong.  The only change I made was I added a can of beef consomme in place of some of the water to give it a richer beef flavor.  Served on hot french rolls with a slice of Provolone cheese and served with a Ramen Broccoli salad.  Loved the fact that I could prepare it without heating up the kitchen during these hot summer days.

A regular in my house.  We use a smaller roast and cook for about 8-10 hours and don't use the bay leaf because of personal preferences.  I have found that the strength of the broth is best when I use just under 2 cups of water.  (Enough water to almost cover the roast is very vague.)

Perfect!  My husband and I loved this.  I cooked mine on high, and it was done in just under 5 hours.  I didnt have thyme, so left it out.  Next time I will make sure to add that.  Wouldnt change a thing, and I didnt find it too salty.

Very simple and very tasty. We used a 3.5 lb roast this time (4 lbs last time) and followed the recipe to the letter. I let it cook in the crockpot all day and the house smelled amazing. The leftovers are great in sandwiches and tortillas with veggies and cheese if you don't want to use the au jus every time. This is definitely my go-to recipe for simple and delicious football food. :)

Followed recipe exact and my family LOVED it! I did not change anything. We did add provolone to ours but that was the only difference. Enjoyed and can't wait to make again for my parents.

The tip to any French dip sandwich recipe is to shread the beef when it's done cooking. It makes the meat so tender and delicious!

Great recipe, and a sandwich that the whole family enjoys.  And the broth that comes from this........ wow!  A must-save for beef vegetable soup.  Nothing like a roast that sits in the slow cooker for eight hours.  Thanks !!

This is, by far, the greatest recipe known to man.  I have turned into a french-dip-making fool for my family and friends!
Tip - use soy sauce mixture as a marinade for a day then slow cook/pressure cook (45-50 minutes on low heat).  The flavors get soaked into the meat even more.
Also - leftovers are even better than the first day! Always make enough to last a few days.

The au jus was great.  For those that complain of being to salty, I recommend you use kikomen soy sauce and not LaChoy.  I give it 4 stars not for flavor, but because beef in a crock pot all day taste like "pot roast" on a bun.  I am looking for a better texture in a french dip.

We've used this recipe so many times it's ridiculous. However, I'm allergic to Rosemary, so we substituted with 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce. Omg...Heaven! This is one meal where I am an absolute pig, and worse - we make this only on days when we're not going to have any company! We're so selfish! ;) Also, we've discovered that if the mix is too salty, adding sugar tones it down immensely! And what's even better? You'd never guess there's sugar in it.

Rubbed seasonings on the roast, browned it, added large chunks of onion and garlic to the bottom of the pot. My house smelled amazing! We ate it as a roast and then had the leftovers on hoagies with provolone cheese. DELICIOUS!!!

These were allright. Neither my fiance or I were thrilled, but we weren't totally disappointed either. I thought about trying lonwolf32's easy slow cooker French dips, but having had Carla Kimball's shredded French dips before and finding them to be bland, I decided on Giselle's recipe instead (the only difference between Carla and lonwolf32's recipe is the addition of beer in one and beef broth / boullion in the other). I feared that lonwolf32's version would be just as bland. To my disappointment, Giselle's French dips were also bland. I think the reason is the addition of water. It dilutes EVERYTHING! Not wanting my roast to dry out (I purchased a bottom round roast), I had to add quite a bit of water. I didn't want to, but had no choice otherwise (I wasn't going to be home to flip my roast periodically to keep it moist). My fiance commented about how "light" colored and "weak" the au jus was. The way I served our sandwiches is what pushed my rating from 3 to 4 stars. I brushed onion rolls with a garlic butter mixture (i.e. melted butter / garlic powder to taste), lightly toasted them, topped half with a mound of meat and slices of mozzarella cheese, placed under the broiler (HI) and melted till the cheese was brown and bubbly. I slathered each sandwich with horseradish sauce (Kraft makes it - a horseradish mayonnaise) and topped with sauteed onions (sauteed in butter). Served with French fries, this was a decent meal, but not one I'd repeat often. Thanks anyways! :-)

I've only ever made these with sliced lunchmeat and the powder mix but I'm trying to cook with less processed ingredients. This turned out AMAZING! I spread a little garlic butter on toasted french bread and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. We had plenty left over to freeze for a second batch, can't wait!

I have never had a french dip sandwich but my husband loves them and he loved this recipe!  My roast was preseasoned with cajun seasoning, onion powder and yellow mustard. Other than the recommendation to use low sodium soy and freshly minced garlic i did the recipe as written and it was delicious!  we used small hoagies and white american cheese with mustard to dress the sandwich and it was yummy!!!

Terrific!  Loved the rosemary and thyme combination.  Liked this recipe better than the other highly rated french dip recipe on this site - that calls for french onion soup/beef broth/beer - liked these seasonings MUCH more.

I just made this and the soy sauce is a great addition! I usually add a ton of salt to my sandwich because they are too bland for my taste, but the soy sauce made it very tasty! (I also added garlic salt instead of garlic powder, but I don't think it needed it).

I always use a can of french onion soup and beef broth for my au jus.  It broadens the depth of the flavor of the juices.  Also, mix 1 tablespoon horseradish to 2 tablespoons Hellman's mayo, spread on you crusty rolls before adding the meat and provolone cheese.....melt under the broiler and viola!  THE BEST!

Wow, Giselle!  This was awesome!  The herbs and seasonings gave the au jus a wonderful flavor depth.  I used boneless blade shoulder instead of a roast and cooked it on high in the crock pot for 3.5 hours.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Hubby and MIL raved!  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Keeping this recipe, it is great!  To cut down on sodium I did use only 1/2 of soy sauce called for and it was still a great aus jus for dipping.

These are totally amazing! Don't change a thing.  Get good crusty french bread.  Mini french baguettes works wonderful! And don't forget to butter the bread first!

I tweaked the recipe a little after reading the reviews...  I used a 3.5# chuck roast, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 1/2 cup beef broth, 1/2 tsp rosemary, garlic powder, packet onion soup mix, seasoned salt and pepper.  I sprinkled garlic powder all over meat before placing in crock pot.  I then added the remaining ingredients and cooked on med for 8 hours.  I removed the meat to slice.  I strained the liquid and placed the meat back into the crock pot along with liquid.  Placed hoagie buns w/ cheese under the broiler to toast and melt the cheese.  Delicious!!!

This is very good.  I had hesitations for all the soy sauce so I cut the amount back, just a bit.  Instead of water, to cover the roast, I used a can of beef broth, then added a little water, too.  Garlic cloves to float and cook, for our tastes. I separated the meat from the juice, served on bakery hoagie rolls, au jus and had a great sandwich!  Thank you for sharing this one.

I was really looking forward to this.  It tasted good as I was slicing the meat.  However, I put the slices back into the juice and let it sit until suppertime, and the result was unbelievably salty.  I used lite soy which has less sodium, so not exactly sure what the problem was.  My roast was a sirloin tip that we raised ourselves free of antibiotics and hormones.  I was disappointed!  Now I'm not sure what to do with the heap of leftovers.

I made a few alterations and it was exceptional. I used 1 cup reduced sodium soy sauce, 1 can Campbell's Beef Consumme', 1 packet Lipton Onion Soup Mix, 2 sprigs fresh rosemary, 5 crushed garlic cloves and 6 cups of water, plus the bay leaf. It was excellent! The au jus was, quite simply, amazing! I recommend these alterations highly, since they produce a very flavorful french dip.

Don't go any further if you are looking for a French Dip! This recipe is perfect. Do NOT change a thing to this recipe. If you follow it, you will be rewarded with an awesome sandwich.  I have made this countless times and it needs no adjustments. It's fun to make when entertaining: great casual meal with almost no fuss. Serve with french fries!

I made a few changes, and it worked out great: First, instead of all soy sauce, I used only a small amount and instead used worcestershire sauce (which I prefer over soy). I also made the bread into a very light garlic bread (butter, garlic powder, and dill, then toasted briefly in the oven). Finally, I added provolone cheese to the sandwiches. They turned out FABULOUS! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe blew the other French Dip recipe on here with almost 1400 reviews out of the water.  This one had awesome flavor, my family couldn't stop talking about it.  I didn't think it was too salty at all....we added more soy sauce to give it more kick.  Delicious, will make this again for sure.

I don't usually eat red meat but ohhh my god this sandwich was great!!!!  Maybe it's my pregnancy cravings but I loved this sandwich.  I used a pot roast and broiled mozzarella cheese onto the bread.  My hubby said this is a 5 star recipe.  I will definately make it again.

I guess I didn't do it right, but the meat did not shred.  I had to carve it with a knife.  While it wasn't horrible, it certainly wasn't 4.5 star worthy.  I'll use all of the leftover au jus to make onion soup - hopefully it will be worth all the trouble of this dish...

Very tasty, followed recipe exactly.  Only gave 4 stars b/c my meat was ready after just a few hours and would have been super dry if I cooked it the entire time that is suggested.

One of our favorite recipes on AR!  Instead of water and a bullion cube I use beef broth - makes for great au jus.  Serve with french bread and provolone cheese to complete!  I always get lots of compliments on this meal and it also makes the house smell heavenly (thanks to the rosemary).  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy. I would use the lower sodium soy sauce next time as it was a little salty but not bad. Also only used half the amount of Rosemary as Rosemary has such a strong taste and it turned out perfectly in this manner.

Wow! Bar none the best French dips I've ever had, in or out of a restaurant - and I made it! Halved recipe for 2 lb chuck roast, and cooked for 8 hrs. Used low-sodium soy sauce as other reviewers suggested. Next time will substitute in low-sodium bullion as well and maybe just a bit less soy sauce, to adjust for our taste, but this was excellent!

I made this for tonight's dinner and my husband and son just loved it.  They went on and on about how this was one of the best things I'd ever cooked!  Wow - and it was so easy! I made the recipe exactly as called for, except we had no bay leaves or thyme, so I left those out.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I changed is I substituted the soy with 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup worchestershire sauce.  This added the extra flavor I was looking for!

I made this recipe as is – no alterations- The meat fell apart is was so tender but my husband and I were not huge fans of the au jus- The soy sauce and herbs gave it a very non-traditional flavor- good, just not my cup of tea.  I would definitely make the beef using this method again, but with different seasonings and without the soy sauce.

This was a mediocre recipe. The meat cooked up tender, but the taste just wasn't a traditional french dip to us. The au jus was downright boring. Sorry, not a winner for this house.

These were soooooo good the au jus was wonderful and it was super easy to make. My grandmother had a recipe for these that is almost exactly the same but in hers she uses 1 cup of beef broth instead of 1 cube of bouillon and only 1/4 cup of soy sauce. I make both of these changes and the sandwiches were amazing, one of the best french dip sandwhiches I've ever had.

Wonderful recipe, but I wish there would have been more 'au jus'!  We ran out of juice well before we ran out of meat. I used one can of beef broth instead of water, so next time I'll add an extra can.
Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  The beef was wonderfully tender and moist.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 it was a little to much soy sauce for us.  Next time I would use 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of beef broth  but otherwise it was very good.

I agree with cutting back on the rosemary and thyme....which I did anyways but now I think I need to cut back a little more.  Great recipe even with the rosemary and thyme being a little overpowering!! Definitely make again.

These were amazing. Couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day! I actually got a recipe from a friend of just the meat in the crockpot with a marinade of beef broth and Lipton Onion Soup Mix. I used that but per this recipe added some soy sauce to the marinade and before putting the meat in the crockpot, I rubbed it with S&P, garlic, and rosemary. We currently live in Paris so we got fresh baguettes and dipped away...DELISH!

My husband loves French dip sandwiches and I found this recipe for him. We tried it last night and he fell in love with me all over again he said. I also have two little ones who got "mini" versions of our sandwiches and they loved dipping and eating as well. The only thing I did different was leave out the rosemary and thyme because I had none on hand, I also doubled the garlic powder. This was a family favorite. I took the leftovers and added some more soy sauce, a little ginger and brown sugar, let it cook for a bit this afternoon and added some broccoli and threw it over rice for dinner tonight. Another hit. Fabulous recipe.

Wow these are so good!I didn't have 10 hours so i brought everything to a boil in a dutch oven then covered and simmered for approx 5 hours and the meat was so tender and juicy.The seasonings are perfect for my family (but we do like it a tad salty).I topped ours with mozzarella cheese and placed under the broiler until just melted.Thank you for the wonderful recipe.It's a keeper!

Delicious!  I used a smaller (1 lb.?) venison roast since I was only making it for two people, used 1/2 the soy sauce, and kept all the other amounts the same.  Topped each sandwich with a slice of swiss cheese and broiled just longer enough to melt the cheese a bit.  The flavor was outstanding!  I'm finishing a leftover sandwich for lunch right now and can't wait to make this again.  This is definitely going in my "Favorites" file.

My husband liked this recipe more than I did.  It just seemed like there was too much going on with it and I was expecting it to taste more like traditional French Dip Sandwiches.  I usually like herbs but the Rosemary overwhelmed this and made it more different than I thought it would.  These sandwiches were good, but not great, and I will continue to look for a better recipe.

I followed the recipe and it was salty, I would use the modifications of low sodium soy sauce and half a bouilon next time around.  I think I will make it again to give it another try but I was not a huge fan.

This was a good meal, don't get me wrong, it was not the flavor that I was expecting. I love french dips and will try it again, maybe adding a can of 
French onion soup, or something! I scaled back on the spices, as others had suggested and used 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce. It actually wasn't salty enough. Maybe try the full amount of reduced sodium soy next time. I served on toasted hoagie rolls. Just okay for me, dawg. Maybe it was my roast cut too - I used a leaner, more expensive cut. Maybe a fatty roast is what you need to make it fall-apart tender.

We had a 3 lb roast to I added a little less soy sauce, but used the same measurements for everything else and added 1 T of brown sugar, which I think rounded out the taste  and gave the au jus some more dimension.  It's delicious!

We made this on Sunday and had the last of it for dinner last night.  I sauteed some onions, added the rest of the shredded beef, spooned a little au jus over it, and added some chopped up pickled sweet peppers and hot peppers.  Ate this mixture in a french bread hoagie with cheese.  It was  very similar to a philly cheese steak and tasted AMAZING!!!  I highly recommend it.

*edit:  12 years later I made this again, forgetting that I tried it once before.  It turned out much better.  I don't know what I did differently, I followed the recipe using a chuck roast.  I used fresh garlic and a dash of Worcestshire.  I also put caramelized onions on the sandwich.  Still rather salty but I can adjust this if I make it again.  Upgrade to 4 stars from 3.

I have definitely had better French Dip sandwiches. Even with reduced sodium soy sauce and less bouillion, the main flavour is salt. The rosemary is subtle but I don't love the soy/rosemary combo. It masks the natural flavour of the beef which I think should be primary in a French Dip sandwich.  I toasted baguettes with provolone cheese prior to layering in the beef--that made it taste better.  I won't make this recipe again.

This was awesome!!  I sauteed some fresh garlic and bell pepper in butter.. then added the meat to slightly brown before I placed it in the crockpot.  I also used a full packet of parmesan Italian dressing along with beef broth and the rest of the ingredients. Since I didn't have a whole roast.. I used 5lbs of stew meat I already had in the fridge.. it came out perfect!  We toasted the sandwich on french bread and topped it with Mont. Jack cheese/grilled onions/mushrooms and bell peppers. The family loved it.. especially my husband!!

Awesome!  I hadn't had this in years and realizing it could be so easy (I love my crock pot)... well, Making it again.  I like to add some steamed green peppers and mixed melted cheese on top with some horseradish on the french bread.  Also, a touch of red wine works very well for the dip.

I really enjoyed this recipe...I did brown the meat on a hot skillet, then used 1/4 cup regular soy sauce, and 1/4 cup low sodium. I think next time I will just use the regular soy sauce since I like my Au Jus nice and salty. I also cooked it on high in my slow cooker for 4 1/2 hours. I also cut baguettes and buttered and put them under the broiler to add some texture. I will definatly make this again.

I would give this recipe more stars if I could! So good! I too added 1/2 packet of Italian dressing seasoning. I also used fresh garlic as I think it is so much better. I cooked it on high for close to five hours. I made several pricks in the roast to ensure it soaked the juice up. Also let the shredded roast sit on low while I finished preparing the rest of the meal. Served with Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries from this site. Topped with Pat's Mushroom Saute (from here) and a little cheese. Buttered white sub rolls and put under the broiler for three minutes. So so good! You won't regret this recipe. Thanks!

Perfection!  The meat was soooooo good.  Made this for my boyfriend and his parents and it was a hit.  Would make this again in a heartbeat...only next time I would use low sodium soy, add some worsh sauce and omit the bouillion altogether.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have seen this recipe before, and have used it for years!  You can't go wrong.  According to my husband, I can't cook, and yet, he loves it when I make this...and more importantly, my biggest critics, my children, love it too!  I would double everything, because you will certainly want more for left overs.

I just made this tonight for dinner. I used a beef round tip as you would find in a carne asada. That way the sandwich has thin slices of beef instead of shredded beef, which I found odd. I used the full measurement of soy sauce but I used a light soy with 50% less sodium. It was not too salty that way. You know, the meat turned out o.k. I had to strain the sauce into a cup from which to dip. It is important to strain it! The recipe doesn't state that. If you don't, you will get clumps of powdery spices and you may even find a bay leaf in there, LOL. So, strain it. I added carmelized sweet onions and provolone cheese. I grilled the french rolls in butter and cut them on the diagonal. It was alright. Not great. Not bad. Next time I will try the other very popular recipe for French Dip... Easy Slow Cooker French Dip is what it's called I believe. (Much more streamlined recipe and nothing to strain.) Good luck!

The flavor of the meat was very good, but the juice was just too salty for everyone except my husband.  I'm going to have to keep looking for a French Dip recipe.

I liked this recipe a lot but I took the advice of many others and cut way back on the rosemary. Very glad I did; it is a prominent flavor when used.I also used 1/2 cup of worcestire sauce in place of the bouillon cube.The meat was tender and it was very important to remove most of the fat. I toasted the bread with butter and garlic salt and added provolone cheese as also suggested by another reader! It turned out very well.

This was good but I would leave out the rosemary next time. The taste didn’t go well with it and the smell of it cooking was not great. My bread presentation was buttered and toasted sub rolls then broiled to melt mozzarella over the meat. Cut rolls in half on the diag. for a restaurant look. Trimming fat from meat is a good idea so you don’t have fatty broth but it was a bit problematic with the chuck roast I used. I ended up with big chunks of meat instead of a roast. Since it was going to be shredded it was fine. I made the broth to a tee except I added a pkg. of onion soup mix and about ½ cup of sherry.  I served it with French Fried mushrooms.

We all loved these sandwiches. My teenage son had 2 and was looking forward to leftovers for lunch the next day. I followed the recipe exactly and thought they turned out great. I don't think they are too salty. All I can figure is there is a difference in bullion cubes used or maybe used garlic salt instead of garlic powder? As for me I'll leave it as is. My slowcooker is large so I ended up adding almost a quart of water. Only change I might make is to use toasted or grilled Texas toast instead of the French bread. We'll be eating lots of these in the future.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet! I thought I had. We love this recipe. My extended family loves this recipe, too. When making it for French Dip Sandwiches, I use reduced sodium soy sauce or the au jus is too salty for my taste (and I like salt!). If I were to prepare this to serve as a sliced roast, I'd use the full sodium soy because it makes the meat even tastier. I toast hoagie buns and add swiss cheese for French Dipping. Ooh-la-la!

This was okay. Not superb, but edible. I may make it again, but will tweak the ingredients for the au jus. As others have said, it was too salty. I even added water near the end of cooking time, and it was still on the salty side. The amount of rosemary may have been too much as well. The meat came out really tender and good.

The whole family liked this.  I used a can of beef broth instead of bullion since several reviewers commented on it being salty.  Seemed to work :-).  There were only enough leftovers for one sandwich -- and they fought over that the next day at lunch

Loved it!  Mother -in- law asked for the recipe too.  I did this at night and let it sit on low through the next day for my arrival home from work.  I used flank steak instead.  It broke apart and was delicious with a lot of sauce.  Ate it with spiral noodles.  Drained the sauce reserving just a little for the meat to sit in overnight in a zip lock and gave to my husband for a sandwich at work the next day.  He loved it.

This is a regular in our household.  I use for beef dip or sometimes make a gravy with the juice.  I do cut the amount of soy sauce in half.  The original recipe was too salty for our tastes.

Awesome recipe! I fed a whole roomfull of hungry football fans. After smelling it cook all day, they were practically begging me to eat. I put the meat on fresh hoagie buns with mozzarella cheese and an herbed mayo I concocted. Touchdown!!!

My whole family loves this recipe.  It's a great fall/winter recipe on a chilly day or for a bar-b-que when you don't want to be a slave to the stove.  I served it along with shredded b-b-q pork sandwiches at a picnic once and it went over very well.

This recipe was almost too good to be true!  It was a snap to throw everything together in the crock-pot and let it cook all day.  I picked the meat up out of the pot and it fell off the fork, it was so tender.  The au jus broth was awsome!  I will fix this again and again....

This was a simple recipe to make, but I felt the soy sauce was a little to strong.  I used a 3 1/2 lb roast and it barely make 10 sandwiches.  I would probably make it again, but use a bigger roast.

I served this recipe to my husband's family, a very large group of meat eaters. Everyone loved it even the kids as young as 18 months. To serve 18 I used a 6 pound roast with increased spices. Will definitely do this one again. I served the beef on Panini rolls spread with garlic butter.  YUMMY!!!

Delicious and easy!  We had four teenage boys - who usually prefer junk food - and they liked this a lot.  Stop and buy crusty bread from a bakery (sliced 3/4 inch)- you won't regret it with this fantastic au jus!

This was a definite hit! Most recipes I try in the slow-cooker get a thumbs down from my family, but they loved this one. I added sauteed onions to the sandwiches, and served them on crusty buns instead of the French bread. Great leftovers the next day.

This recipe was so delicious!  Put everything in the crock pot on low and let it go!!!  It's great for working people like us.  By the time you get home, dinner is ready.  The soy sauce and beef bullion adds great flavor to the beef.

This was great!  No more buying deli roast beef and au juis mix at the supermarket when we want a French dip.  After the juice was gone, the meat still made a great roast beef sandwich with mustard, mayo and cheese.

My family loved these sandwiches.  They were quick and easy to prepare.  A great recipe to start before leaving in the morning.  I did find that I like to slice the meat before it is completly cooked as it is a little firmer to slice and then put it back into the juices to finish cooking.  This meat freezes well too.  Great recipe!

I toasted several pieces of french bread on a cookie sheet in the oven, topped toast with the meat and some "juice"; then covered with Jack cheese and ran under the broiler.  Served with a fork!  Delicious!!!  Next time I will add some onion and worcestershire sauce and decrease the amount of thyme (to suit my hubby's tastes).  Great recipe!

This is what I served to my son and his date to the prom.  It was a big hit!  We added provolone cheese.
We served it with oriental cole slaw and steamed broccoli.  This is a great addition to my recipe box.

I'm not a big French Dip fan but my wife says that is good. What it does make, however, is the BEST French Onion Soup ever!!  Just use the leftover dip (strained), well cooked onions and white wine. No need for any other seasoning, it's perfect the way it is!

I used London broil (hey, it was $2.97/lb) and seared it on both sides first. I also used boxed beef broth in place of the boullion cube and water, and crushed garlic in place of garlic powder. It was falling apart after 9 hours in the slow cooker, and sooooo delicious. Served on soft sourdough sandwich rolls that were buttered and toasted on the griddle. Oh, I also strained the liquid before serving. Family loved this and I'll be making it again. Thank you!

This recipe was amazing. Definitely going to be a regular on our menu. I put all the ingredients in the crock pot and then right before dinner I sautéed some onions and green peppers to put on the sandwich. I finished it off with a tasted roll and pro alone and.... Incredible! I only used 1/2 the amount of low sodium soy from the recommendations others gave. Perfection.

This is an awesome, easy recipe for french dip.  Every time I make it everyone raves.  We love to sauté mushrooms in butter and garlic and put them in the bun as well.  So nummy.  I do use sodium reduced soya sauce though.  Otherwise juice is way too salty.  But that is personal preference.  I love that the juice is so flavourful.  I can't stand boring au jus.  This au jus is so good we sometimes love to just soak the meat in it and never mind the bread. I have used all types of roast in this.  Some cuts need to cook longer but it has nothing to do with the sauce.

I will keep this recipe as a reference point but as-is it needs some essential editing.  

Problems: This recipe didn't specify the type of roast. Even after reading comments I had to settle on an arm roast bc for times sake I had to go to the small store that's around the corner from me and that's what they had available. It wasn't particularly cheap so, on the plus side, the meat was extraordinarily tender.
I was hesitant about the 1/2 c of soy sauce but I wanted to try the recipe as is.  I find that slow cooker meats release more water than I'd like so I rationalized that the soy would be appropriately diluted. It wasn't.  The au jus was way to salty.  I ended up having to add what I'd say was about 4 cups of water to even be able to dip our sandwiches 

There was no mention of cheese for these sandwiches which I suppose could be considered a preference but I've never been served a French dip sandwich that didn't have cheese so my suggestion is provolone. Also my family loves for me to make horseradish mayo to spread on the sandwiches 

Future suggested modifications:  while the soy definitely added richness, I'll reduce to 1/4 c. Also, I'd say half the amount of dried rosemary next time.

I found the prep and ease of this recipe were the majority of the 4 star rating I'm giving.   It was decent as is, but I certainly wasn't wowed by the sauce like others seem to be.   I felt I needed to tweak it because it lacked richness of flavor, especially on the beefy broth end.   I think way more garlic would help and some onions in the brew.     I used chuck roast and the meat took the full 10+ hours but then just fell apart.   Good, but not great.

Fantastic. The changes I made were to use fresh garlic and thanks to the reviews of others, I spent the extra money on a tri-tip roast. The meat is so tender after 10 hours on low. I'm going to let it go another hour or to and see if it improves. I did use lite soy sauce and instead of a bouillon cube I used organic low sodium beef broth.No doubt I will make again and  probably experiment with a few other changes. Still, great recipe, simple and delicious.

We have made this three times already. It is great recipe! We use about a 3lb roast, either chuck or round, and make about 6 sandwiches from it.  We do substitute beef broth for bouillon cube and add extra beef broth to have plenty of aujus if needed. I would recommend 1 can of beef broth if you don't like a lot of aujus or more if you like a lot.

I have made this recipe to many times to count!  My family and friends love it. Instead of garlic powder I use Better than Bouillon roasted garlic paste and their roasted beef paste instead of the Bouillon cube. I use a 5 lb Angus beef round roast. We love the au jus so I use about a cup of soy and probably 4 cups of water. Full teaspoons of the herbs. The fragrance of this dish is amazing!  I use whole wheat hoagie rolls and add provolone or Swiss cheese with mine. It just can't be beat!

I used an Angus sirloin roast.....very good. In place of water I used a 32oz. box of beef broth,skipped the bouillon no need for more sodium and sprinkled season all, pepper, and a teaspoon of fresh garlic on top of roast with the mixture. Excellent!

I was looking forward to making this so much! I read the reviews carefully, and I was excited to make this for my whole family. I followed the recipe to the letter, and unfortunately, it was very bitter and tangy. I won't be making this again any time soon.

This was super good!  I made just a couple changes, based on what I like and what I had on hand.  I used beef broth rather than bouillon.  I used a little less soy because I don't like salty.  I added a couple healthy dashes of Worcestershire sauce and a good splosh of red wine.  My new go to for french dips which are a family favorite!  Next time I will use fresh garlic rather than powder.

Great recipe - will definitely be making again.  Starting from almost completely frozen, I browned and then cooked it in a pressure cooker for about 1 hour total from  the start of full pressure build-up.  Just make sure you add enough water.  I had mine initially filled just below the top of the roast but needed to add more throughout the cooking process.

Delicious.  I made with our neighbor's home grown beef.  Very tender and flavorful; even more so the next day.  I served it with fried onions and peppers on a french roll topped with provolone cheese.  It was my husband's birthday meal; he loved it.

2-9-16 ~ This was delicious.  I halved the recipe and threw everything in the crockpot before leaving for school.  The house smelled wonderful when I got home.   I used the leftovers to make a pot of beef and noodles the next night.  I used a chuck roast for the meat.

So good! I used a chuck roast. Only thing I changed in the recipe was I smeared roasted garlic cloves over the top of the meat before putting the season mixture over it instead of garlic powder because I had a bunch on hand. I used a French baguette for the roll. Will definitely be making this again!

I LOVE this recipe!  So easy and delicious.  My husband loves French Dip sandwiches, so I served his up on warmed bolillios rolls with the au jus.  I love horseradish, so I had mine with white bread spread with sour cream and horseradish sauce.  It makes a lot of au jus, so I used the leftover in my next pot of French Onion soup as a substitute for some of the beef broth.  Saw the comment about using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder -- definitely will try that next time!

PERFECT!   Thank you Giselle, you made me look great!  I used low sodium soy, NO sodium beef broth (HerbOx).    I don't remember what the chunk of beef was but it was not fatty. 
 
My first time on a recipe I try to follow directions, if the recipe is worth a second try I make adjustments as I feel. I'll be making this again!   Thanks so much for adding this recipe & thanks y'all for taking the time to add your comments.

This is a delicious and easy French dip. I followed others' recommendations and added a sliced onion, sliced fresh garlic, and fresh rosemary. Also added a 12 oz can of beer. The only complaint from the family was that there wasn't more!

ONE OF THE BEST MEALS EVER! It's perfect as written! The meat comes out so tender and full of flavor. The crunchy French bread is the perfect compliment to the texture of the tender meat. We had it with sauteed peppers and onions and put provolone cheese on the sandwich. WE WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!  LOVED IT!!!

I've used this recipe and other's similar and always had great results.  Having used various cuts of beef, I've found that a chuck roast is my favorite. The key ingredients are soy and either beef bouillon or dry onion soup mix which can be combined with your other favorite spices. 8 hrs on low in the crockpot.

I used a roast half the size of the one in the recipe but used the same amount of liquid. After 10 hours, there was no liquid left at all -- just enough to wet the beef once I shredded it. What's up with that? How do you get any liquid out of 1/2 cup of soy sauce. Maybe the beef I used wasn't fatty enough to produce anything else. But it was so unbelievably salty, we could barely eat it. My kids love salt and both of them commented on how over-salted it was. There you have it. Just my opinion. I agree with ALLICAT2U -- definitely need to add a bunch of water.

It's 10PM EST and I just started to make dinner for tomorrow! I'm using a bottom round roast because it was on sale when I went out yesterday to buy the beef (also, if you add this recipe to your shopping list, it says bottom round). My roast is 2-1/2 lbs and at first, I was going to bump the recipe down to 6 servings, but when I needed 5/8 of a bullion, and 5/8 tsp of the seasoninga, I just kept it as is. I followed the recipe almost exactly - my only changes besides the size of the roast were I'm using minced garlic instead of powdered (it just has a much better flavor than powdered) and I spread some of the seasonings, minced garlic, and a bay leaf on top of the bit of the roast that isn't covered with the broth and two more leaves are floating around. I'll be serving this tomorrow night on regular Philly Amaroso hoagie rolls with provolone cheese. After my husband and I have dinner, I'll finish my review! It already smells delicious!!

Awesome recipe! I already have it written out and saved to my keeper recipe book :) Things I did differently were: I didn't bother with the bay leaf. I used fresh ground pepper (3 pinches). I used reduced sodium soy sauce and still found it to be slightly salty. For the cut of meat, I used an English roast ( one of my favorites for my slow cooker, as they always come out tender!) And instead of bread I used the Orlando brand hoagie buns. These buns toasted with the meat and some provolone cheese is just wonderful, very flavorful, the au jus was good but I think I may add something more to it for better flavoring next time. Definitely worth the time! And it makes your house smell good :)

I thought there was too much rosemary, but my kids loved it.  The meat texture was a little strange, but tasted good.  I would make it again, it was so simple and it was eaten!

This is one for the books! My husband and I both really enjoyed this. TIP: I lost the bay leaves I purchased at the grocery (yeah, I know :) and it was still just as good!

We liked this, only thing we changed was to use one carton beef broth instead of bouillon. I had to cook my 6 lb rump roast for 8 hours on high to tenderize it, perhaps 12-18 hrs on low would have been even better? I would make it again.

Used recommended meat and almost all of the seasoning. Not too salty - but did not like density of meat. Meh.

I have been making this exact recipe for years, mostly for parties/picnic's. Everyone always loves it and I have already had requests by some people to take the broth home so they could make soup! I usually serve creamy horseradish as a condiment.

Super easy recipe with great results.  I used a top round roast and trimmed the fat off before cooking.  The meat still had a really good flavor w/o a lot of fat.  The only drawback is it will be drier than some cuts I suspect, but that is what the broth is for. :)

We toasted the bread in the oven at 375 for about 5-10 minutes before making the sandwiches, but this isn't necessary.  The broth had a nice flavor, but not overpowering for most in my opinion.

I am trying this again with hot pepper cheese and maybe a bit of dry seasoning for an extra kick.

Based on the other reviews I thought this was going to be quite salty. I made it as stated, and actually found it needed a little more salt. Not entirely sure it's my style but it was exactly what I expected and very easy to make. Thanks.

This recipe is extremely easy, and my family loved it!!  Instead of French rolls, I bought Caprese bread. I put the meat and some provolone cheese and made Panini sandwiches.  These also turned out great!

This is super easy, And My husband LOVED it, and so did the rest of the family! No alterations needed for this recipe only a few finishing touch additions. I added some provolone cheese to each sandwich. a good addition in my opinion, and next time I will grill up some onions to go on the sandwiches as well. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Made this recipe for dinner today. It was amazing. I added a second bouillon cube because I wanted a stronger beef taste. If was perfect. I don't know what other people where complaining about it being to salty. Will be making this again.

Without the juice my meat was too dry, but the flavor of both the sauce and the meat was good.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and actually could have went for more salt to get it a little closer to restaurant.  In my crock pot the amount of water I used was about 2 cups.

This is awesome! I've made it many times over now and it has become a requested dish when I go somewhere. My hubby is allergic to garlic so I omit that and use a can of beef broth instead of the bouillon. I sear the roast in EVOO in another pan before putting in cooker and I do think this adds to the recipe. I cook the roast until it is tender enough to separate off the fat. I remove the whole roast, take off the fat then put the chunks of meat back in cooker and shred with fork. I let this cook another hour or two this way. Even though I use reduced sodium soy sauce and broth, if the juice is still too salty add some RAW cut potatoes, which absorbs much of the salt. I placed on Sara Lee Deli rolls, top with provolone cheese then broil a minute or two to make them just the right amount of crispy so the bread doesn't get soggy. This freezes well and the leftovers are just as good as fresh! (and I'm picky when it comes to leftovers) Thanks Gisele for this awesome recipe!

I've made this twice now and it is absolutely excellent. My kids don't use the 'au jus' for dipping but either way the meat is succulent. We love provolone cheese and lots of horseradish on the roll.

We liked this recipe quite a bit. I did cut the soy in half and used fresh garlic. I use an Italian herb mix with rosemary, thyme and basil that I substituted in and it worked just fine. As always, whoever gets the bay leaf in their broth cup, does the dishes!

Because of a food allergy, we substituted a teaspoon of Worsteshire sauce for the rosemary.  And used sourdough bread instead of french, because it was what we had on hand...  It came out absolutely fantastic.  We couldn't eat enough of it, and have had it several times since.  It's one of the best recipes that we've found for roasts so far.

What an amazing, simple recipe!  I put the roast with spices in the slow cooker at 6:30am before leaving for work, and by the time we sat down to eat (a full 12 hours later), everything was perfect!  I took the roast out of the juice and strained the juice to get rid of any remnants of spice.  We used store bought french bread (freshly made) and the sandwiches were so, so light!  Will definitely make again!

Great flavor! Has a nice italian flavor. Even scaled down the portions and it make a ton of food! Needed more salt, but you can add that at mealtime.

I used a two pound roast, so I should have shortened the time in the crock pot...it came out a little bit dry, but after dipping the sandwich in the cooking juice, it was fine. I used one can of reduced sodium beef broth (with about a can of water) and omitted the bay leaf and it was great!

I have to say. This is yuuuuummmmmmy! Even though I don't eat roast beef all that often, I really enjoyed this recipe. Very tastey. Would definitely make this again! I served with provolone cheese and sauteed green pepper and onion slices.

To cut down on the salt, I use Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce & beef soup base instead of the bouillon cube. It's such a simple recipe & yet it is really tasty. One of my family's favorites!

I followed this recipe to a T, but it was very bland. My husband requested a 'french dip' sandwich like the one's from McCallister's. This just didn't do it for us. It was not bad, but it was bland!

Oh my god. This was so, so delicious! I used a 2 lb tri-tip and halved the recipe and used 2 peppercorns and a whole fresh bay leaf off a tree outside my kitchen. I did not expect the flavor that came out of that slow cooker at all. I knew it'd be good, but it was just SO flavorful and so perfectly seasoned, it completely blew me away!

Since I only had a 2 lb piece of meat, I cooked it for only about 10 hours and it was perfect. The remaining broth left for dipping was PHENOMENAL. I wish I had more room in my stomach so I could eat more. Will ABSOLUTELY make again!

This is a fabulous flavorful sandwich.  I made it w/a beef brisket that I slow cooked in the oven one day then pulled apart and put it in the slowcooker w/the defatted au jus the next.  I served it to a gather of female friends & it made a HUGE hit.  Definately one to make again.

We L.O.V.E.D this sandwich!!  I read a lot of reviews and made the following changes. 1/2 c REDUCED sodium soy sauce, 7 whole black peppercorns, 2 bay leafs, no bouillon cube, no water, Reduced sodium soy sauce to cover almost cover the roast about 2 to 2 1/2 cups.  This will be a staple in our house for sure!  I served in on toasted French bread w/ provolone cheese.

This is good stuff and super easy.  I am not crazy about thyme so I cut back slightly on the amount that I added. I am not salt sensitive so used the other ingredients as recipe stated.  Will make this again!

YUM!  i did modify a bit:  all i used was: 1/3c low sodium soy, 1 beef bouillon and 1 package onion soup mix (left out all other dried ingredients)----was pressed for time, so cooked on high for 5 hrs...still incredibly delish....

A favorite go to dinner for my family on our busy hockey nights.  A hit with both the kids & grown ups!  I reduced the soy sauce to 1/3 cup, otherwise prepared it exactly.  I also toast the buns with garlic butter and serve melted cheese & sauteed onions.  YUMMY!

This was a great recipe for the crock pot. I am always looking for easy recipes for the work week and this is definately one I will make again. I used the suggestion of cooking it while we slept and stored in the fridge and reheated for dinner that night.  The meat was much more flavorful after sitting. I only gave it 4 stars because I still like the traditional french dip with fresh sliced roast beef.

This was very good, but I did find the flavor of soy sauce a little odd (and I halved it!) in a french dip recipe.  I used 1 tsp. "better than bouillon" instead of a bouillon cube.  Will definitely make again, but probably omit the soy.

the roast itself turned out yummy but the au jus was way too salty.  If I make this again, it will only be because of the way it flavored the meat.

These were very good, altho the rosemary was a little overpowering to me, even tho I halved it(I'm not a fan-I should've known:) No problem-I covered mine w/peppers, onions, & monterey jack.

Was great!  Also happened to be my first attempt at making French Dip.  The recipe was very easy.  I  pressed garlic cloves instead of using the garlic powder, and it tasted great.

Anyone could make this! It's so simple. Tasted great. I swapped out thyme for oregano because I can't stand thyme. This was perfect with baked potato wedges.

Excellent!  Best french dip recipe that I have made.  The family loved it.  I made it as written and would not change a thing.  Put it on toasted hoagie buns and put swiss cheese on top and toasted until melted.  The au jus was very tasty!

We liked these sandwiches a lot.  Next time I plan to omit the bullion cube as we don't feel it added much flavor.

Simple & Delicious.  Low sodium soy sauce is recommended.  Like most shredded beef style dishes trimming as much fat off as possible before you start will help your final product.

Really good! My Hubby and I ate on this for two days. It is salty as other reviewers have said but my Husband loves salt so he thought it was perfect. Served with provalone cheese and fried onions and mushrooms.

I cooked it exactly as the recipe said and had a really tender piece of meat that wasn't exactly what I expected French Dip to taste like.  It tasted more like a pot roast to me, which is exactly what it ended up being.  So, this is a great recipe for roast meat in general, only my personal tastes didn't like it as French Dip.  Great as a roast with mashed potatoes and veggies for me!

Easy and good recipe.  I used a rump roast which was very lean and came out nice and tender.  Put on crusty ciabatta rolls with melted provolone and fried sweet onions.  Then served the dipping broth on the side to dip them the sandwiches.  Everyone loved them.  I thought this would also be an excellent recipe for my son at college.

Outstanding!!!!!!  Just as is.  My family loves this recipe.    Hard to find a 4 lb roast at the local market so I get a couple of 2 lb roasts, eat one and put the other in the frig.  Next day slice it razor thin while cold and its awsome.   Almost has a Pastrami taste to it.

Nice mix of ingredients.  I still ended up with too salty au jus, but it was quickly fixed with a little water.  I did use fresh garlic instead of powder.  Will definitely do this again.

We made these for dinner tonight and they were AWESOME.  I do agree that the original recipe is a bit salty, I think next time I'll try cutting down the amount of soy sauce that I put in.  We also took someone's suggestion to put some provolone cheese on the sandwiches, which I think should be a requirement.  Just a little bit of provolone on each sandwich and then we put it in the toaster oven for a few seconds to melt the cheese.  Yum!  We'll definitely be making these again! :)

Excellent recipe. My store had eye of round on sale at a great price, so I used that.  Cooked it 8 hours on low and then refrigerated all over night (separated au jus from beef). Sliced the beef and thickened the au jus a bit on the stove top and put the sliced meat and au jus back in the slow cooker for a few hours.  I did skip the water part and used reduced-sodium beef broth for the liquid.  Excellent flavor.  My husband asked if I would make it often.  He likes his beef still moo'ing, so that was quite a compliment for this recipe.

This recipe is excellent, so tasty.  Instead of serving on French bread, we use a garlic loaf that has been re-heated (open faced) according to package directions.  Then, pile  the beef, sauteed onions and grated mozza cheese on one side, just cheese on the other and broil 'til cheese bubbles.  Put both halves together, slice and dip.....so yummy!

Very tasty!  I used a top sirlion roast.  The only substitions was a can of beef broth instead of the boulion and I did not have rosemary so I used crushed basil.  I read comments of people thinking it was to salty; and with the substition of the breef broth it wasn't. (I'm not much of a salt person - so this was a concern).  I also covered the entire roast with water after adding the other ingredients.  To avoid it being to salting, I believe the trick is to modify the number of servings in the recipes until it best fits your roast size - then it will be more in proportion.  We ate it for dinner last night along with some potatoes by just pulling off what we wanted along.  I did reserve some of the liquid.  Then today, we had it pulled apart on hoagie buns with provolone cheese and warmed a tad in teh microwave to melt the cheese and dipped it in the broth... YUM!

My husband LOVED this! I didn't use a roast because I was not going to go buy one just for this. I used smaller pieces of beef since I had coupons to use up and that was the cheapest way. I also threw in the remaining prime rib we had left over from Christmas dinner.  He loved the liquid it is dipped in. Now I need to find a beef roast on sale to use for this!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  This recipe was great! The butcher gave me 5 lbs instead of the 4 so I cooked it the full 12 hours.  It's just my husband and I, so let's just say we will be eating these sandwiches for days!  I will defiantly be recommending this recipe to my friends!

We liked this, but it was REALLY salty. And we cut the soy sauce in half and only used half a boullion cube. I like salt, but it was a bit much for my husband. If I do this one again I will use wine to cut the salt a bit.

Great taste super easy to make.  I always make the night before, slice it when it is cold the next day then stick it back in the crock pot.  We made huge sandwiches on some fresh baguettes I made--they were gone! Thanks

I followed the directions exactly, only added more water and one more beef bouillon for more dip for the sandwiches.  Made 16 sandwiches perfectly, with the "to die for french bread rolls" on this site. Great recipe and will make again.

Truely a perfect recipe - for once I did not change a thing.  I heeded other's advice and used low sodium soy sauce.  Defintely the right choice, it was salty enough as is, I can't imagine it with full-sodium soy sauce!  The meat had a very delicate but well rounded flavor, it's definitely unique to other French Dips that I have tried.  I had to cook it for 13 hours to get it to the shreddable consistency that I wanted (I had to start at midnight the day before), but it was awesome that I literally had everything I needed except for the meat in my cabinet; I was so excited.  Served on club rolls with provolone, and also sauteed one sweet onion, then threw it in with the broth to cook for 10 minutes.  Soooo good!

This is very good. I also like to use this like a pot roast. I just make a gravy with the juices, and serve with mashed potatoes.

Great recipe.  I made this exactly as the recipe states.  As a few other reviews say, it can turn out a little salty, but its not to hard to add a little more water.  Other than that, this was a great, simple recipe.  I will make again.

My family loved these - I followed directions exactly and it tasted great.  Not too salty at all - I think other posters with that problem had too little water!  My roast was only about 2 1/2 lbs. which was perfect for our crew.  I started about 9 am on high with a frozen roast and turned to low at noon - by 6:00 when we at dinner it was literally falling apart which made shredding easier.  I'll definitely make this great recipe again!

This is a great recipe.  It tastes GREAT, and it has no condensed soups.  I had fresh thyme, so I used that, and I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of the powder.  First rate!

This was phenomenal!  I am not a very good cook and my poor husband made a comment about how he wished I was so I could make him french dip sandwiches.  Well I got online and found this recipe. I did not take the time to sear the roast before hand. I put it in the crockpot frozen and left. I work 12 hour shifts and I was a little worried, but it was delicious and my husband was very proud and is begging for it again!

Made as written and thought it had a really good flavor, not what I consider a traditional french dip flavor though.  Nonetheless, very tasty and will make again.  I liked the rosemary/thyme combination.

Years ago, my husband and I LOVED French Dip sandwiches at a local pub called South Campus Place.  For 30 years, I have never been able to come close to re-creating the recipe...until this one.  This is by far THE best beef and au jus ever...even better than our restaurant one.  Didn't alter the recipe at all and it was fabulous !!

Wonderful flavor!  Served on French rolls & ladled the au just over open face.  Next time would like to add onion to crock pot & serve on sandwiches with a cheese to melt such as Provolone.  Notes:  *omitted bay leaf (didn't have any); *used 1 1/2 c. purchased beef broth vs. bouillon cube; *added water almost to cover after adding beef broth.  Wasn't too salty at all with regular soy sauce...perhaps variations in the size of crock pot/roast/& amt of water needed to cover effects saltiness.  Plan to follow another reader's advice in using the extra au jus for French Onion Soup.  Yum!

This was good, but not exactly the dip flavor I was looking for. A little on the mild side for me. I let it cook for 12 hours on low and halved the recipe since there is just 2 of us eating. :) The meat was wonderful, very tender, good flavor, shredded very nicely; it was the dip flavor I'm not sold on. It was GOOD just not GREAT. We served these on French Bread Rolls to Die For, very nice together. My son liked the bread with meat as well, but not the dip. Would be nice with some provologne melted on it.

I used just shy of a 1/2 cup soy sauce and used a can of low sodium fat free beef broth. While it was cooking the aroma was so strong I thought I put too much rosemary in the recipe (I didn't). I used a bottom round and it was fine.Very little fat to skim off (I cooked the day b4,sliced the meat and put back in the juices) I served it at a buffet family meal and it was a little tricky explaining the "dipping method" however the fam solved the problem by laddling the juiced directly on the roll.

My husband thought this was great, but we both agree that next time, we'll replace 1/2 the soy sauce with worcestershire sauce.  A tad too salty.  We made these with ciabatta rolls. Mmmmm!

wonderful! i ended up using venison and was very happy w/ the results.i needed 6 c of water to cover the roast, which yielded a ton of au jus. as another reviewer suggested i will use it to make french onion soup later. thanks for the great recipe w/ pantry spices i keep on hand( i dont like to have to buy mixes)

I adapted this a bit for the pressure cooker.  Since I was using appx 1.5 lbs of wafer cut (sirloin something) meat, I did this....4t. soy, 4t. Wyler's sodium free instant beef bouillon (since I knew the meat I was using was not "beefy tasting"), took about 2 cups of water to cover the sliced up meat.  I used the full amts of herbs and added maybe half a teaspoon of fresh minced garlic.  I intended to add a splash of sherry but forgot about it till the cooker was already rocking.  Will be making this again and again with a better cut of roast.

Unfortunately I really did not enjoy this recipe.  I think it was the rosemary or something.  Just did not taste at all like a french dip sandwich to me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband liked it so that is why I gave it three stars.  I hate giving bad reviews...sorry :(

Used eye of round roast which had very little fat. Everyone loved this and it was so utterly easy to make. Omitted the bay leaf because mine were hiding somewhere in the spice cupboard, but I will certainly add it next time. Thanks so much!

Used an eye-of-round roast and the only thing I'd do differently is pour the juice over the shredded meat before serving so it could soak in.  The sandwiches would have been even better if the meat was completely covered in the juice instead of just dipped in.

This recipe was awsome! I made a few changes (very few :-) ). I added fresh grated ginger to the mixture and about 1hour before serving I put onions and mushrooms into the slow cooker. It was wonderful!

Loved it...a little bit salty but i'll just use reduced sodium soy sauce next time.  Probably omit the bay leaf too, picky hubby!!  Nice crunchy salad and french dip sandwich, perfect, quick and easy meal..

Excellent every time I make it. I add a couple of cloves to the pot, just a personal preference.  And broil provalone cheese on the bread.

I realized after making this that I forgot the soy sauce!!  No wonder I thought it needed salt! :)  But the flavor was still really good.  The meat was very tender (I cooked it on low for 7 hours).  My only complaint was the sauce had about an inch layer of fat on top.  I tried to skim as much as I could, but there was still a lot.  And my roast didn't seem to have a lot of fat on it.  I guess I need to get a sieve or something for things like this.  But overall the recipe was good, look forward to trying it with the soy sauce :)

Used a chuck roast and followed directions exactly as written.  So good I had two for dinner!  Made french rolls also and couldn't believe how easy this great meal really was.

Wow!  These were delicious!  The only change I made was to add a can of beef broth instead of bouillion and water.  The au jus was the perfect mix of herbs and salty beef flavor.  Husband thought just a little too much rosemary flavor.  This was an extremely easy meal.  I prepared in 5 minutes before work and let it cook about 10 hours.  The only "work" in this recipe was shredding the beef and that was a sinch.  I would definitely let the roast cook at least 10 hours if not even longer for that fall apart tenderness.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent Recipe and super easy! I cut the recipe in half for the hubby and I. Cooked for 10 hours on low. Did reduce the amount of soy sauce by half after reading many reviews on salt level. Served this on homemade Cheesy Italian Bread with Swiss cheese melted on top.

I think this would be a great recipe but I did a few thinks wrong and realized afterword. The roast was a 2lb round center cut roast very little fat that could be why it was dry, and the crock pot was to big for the roast so there for too much water was used witch made the aujus watery. Plus it was only cooked for 8 Next. Next time I will tweak a bit.

These were pretty good. My family liked them.  I put the meat on the bread and then put it in the oven on low-- about 250 degrees for about 10 minutes to dry the bread out alittle bit and this seemed to be really good when you dunked the bread in the aujus.  We tried a slice of swiss cheese on it too and my son liked that.

Delicious! I made this with lower-sodium beef broth instead of a boullion cube, since some found it too salty. Left out the rosemary, since I didn't have any. Served it on french bread with provolone cheese and sauteed onions; it was fabulous!

Delicious jus.  Didn't have a bouillon cube so I used Beef Broth in place of the water.  Put some of the extra jus over our dog's kibble.  He was in Heaven!

I really liked this. It was easy, it smelled great and it tasted great. Served on French bread rolls from this website as suggested by others (good suggestion), provelone cheese, and sauteed mushrooms & onions. My husband added bbq sauce to the leftovers the next day and loved that as well. Great recipe.

I made this recipe just as the recipe said.  I did not change a thing.  These are by far the best french dips I ever had.  My husband said they were even better then his moms and that I now hold the new title for the best french dips!  Thanks for a great recipe.

The only thing I changed in this recipe was to use low sodium soy sauce.  I always use chuck roast for anything like this because it always cooks up great, and it was no different in this recipe.  When the roast was done, I pulled it out, put the juice in a gravy separator to get rid of the grease, then strained the juice through a fine strainer.  Then I put the juice back in the crock pot with the beef that I pulled apart with a fork.  This was absolutely fantastic.  I served with rolls and a few different kinds of sliced cheese, and it was all gone.  I will definately make this again for a croud.  Great recipe!

Tastes just like the one I used to have at Swiss Chalet.  I have made this numerous times and it is always a hit.  I like to toast the buns and top the meat with caramelized onions and shredded cheese (swiss is good).

Awesome. I used a three lb top round roast (London Broil cut) with very little fat and it was just fantastic. I did the full 12 hours in low sodium soy, and the au jus was just perfect. I left the meat in the slow cooker and juice with the power turned off for about 2 hours before turning it back on for an hour so that the meat would still be hot when my boyfriend got home. We put this meat on french sub rolls with caramelized onion and Swiss cheese, then put them in the oven for a few minutes. Delicious!

For some reason, despite the low heat setting and all the liquid added, the meat came out a little dry. It worked out okay, with the au jus however. I cooked for my inlaws and they really enjoyed it. I did cut the soy sauce in half.

This recipe was just ok. I think the seasonings that the recipe called for were too overpowering. That's all we could smell in the house was the Rosemary. I will continue to look for a better French Dip recipe.

OMG! This is the bomb. I had a two pound chuck roast. I used two bouillon cubes and instead of water one can of beef broth. I threw out my other french dip recipe from this site. This is and will remain the recipe I use. The rosemary is just awesome. The boyfriend and I love it!

Quick and easy!  Well, my bf did all the work for this one, but he said it was easy.  Haha.  And I guess it's not quick since you slow cook it, but it's a quick preparation process.  There weren't too many ingredients and the slow cooker really brought out all the flavors.  We got some horseradish to give the sandwiches a little kick and served them in a whole wheat french loaf with the dipping sauce on the side.  He also served these sandwiches with some pickle slices and curly fries.  Yummy!

Very delicious.  Stuck to the recipe about 95%. VERY easy to make. Changes I mad eto recipe- use un-crushed Rosemary, added 2 splashes of Wircescher Sauce, and let it simmer in crockpot about 14 hours.  It was so tender and flavorful.  Also, once I shredded the meat, I added 2 splashes of Liquid Smoke sauce, and about a tablespoon of seasoning salt to the meat.  For the sandwiches, I bought french bread rolls, and added provolone cheese.  These were yummy, and not a fuss to make.  We ate them while watching our Chicago Bears play. Great Superbowl dish to make for a crowd! And LOTS left over- good reheated as well!

This was the best french dip sandwich I've ever had.  Sooo good.  I used a smaller chuck roast (2 lbs) but kept the other quantities the same.  Tip for those who are afraid it will turn out salty: mix all of the sauce ingredients together with the water first, and taste, to make sure it is not too salty.  Everyone has their own preference.  I used 3/8 cup soy sauce and the full buillion cube.  I doubled the peppercorns too and used a lot of liquid.  

I only wish that the meat didn't quite fall apart and would stay in slices, but I guess that is because it was so good and tender! 

I don't even like rosemary but I thought the juices were just perfect.  I might make this to have the perfect au jus for my thanksgiving prime rib!

Wow! This is an excellent recipe! I used a venison roast because that's what we had & used beef broth instead of the cube. I found out that after I shredded it, I put it in a seperate pot along with the au jus so they can cook together, I went to get it after about 30 once we were done eating to put it away, all the au jus was soaked in the meat. It was soooo much better. I think that is what I'm going to do form now on.

This was so good!  I used a tri-trip roast and followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't find it to be too salty at all.  Just right in my oppinion!  I used provolone cheese on top of french rolls and put them under the broiler.  Excellent sandwich!!!  Will be making again and again!!

Very, very good!!  I followed the recipe as stated, but took others advice and only used half of the soy sauce.  Next time I may put it all in, though.  I had 2.5 lb of meat and (after browning it) cooked it on high for 6 hours.  I just had to get the bread and provolone cheese at the store.  Since they were just regular hoagie buns, I put the sandwiches together and toasted just a few minutes in oven before serving.  Awesome!  Husband raved about them!  This will be an often used recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic! The only thing that I changed was I used 1/4 cup soya sauce and 1/2 cup of water. This cut down on quite a bit of the saltiness. I also seasoned my roasts with a roast rub. Everyone gulped this down. Will make again.

I loved this. It's so amazingly easy. And makes a ton! I used 1/2c. beef broth instead of the bullion. Then I served it with grilled onions & peppers & melted provolone. YUM.

This was so good and so easy!  I used a pork roast instead of beef and canned beef broth instead of the buillion since it's what I had on hand and it was snowing outside - it still turned out awesome!  I served this with French Rolls to Die For, a recipe also found on this site.  I will absolutely make this again.

I had to give this recipe 3 stars. This really did not taste like a French Dip sandwich to me. However, the roast was good as a roast. I will make it again and serve it as a roast with gravy. I will keep searching for a French Dip sandwich. Update, I made this recipe again as a roast and it was awesome! I used the juice to make the gravy. It was to die for!

Wow! This was fantastic. I'm not a 'cook' by any stretch, but I made this super easy meal for a guest and he said I was a good cook! I can definately go for a recipe that brings that reaction any day! Another time I made it using the suggested onion soup mix and put jalapeno havarti cheese on hoagie buns and broil in the oven-that was fantastic! I used the leftover au jus to cook rice, which made for deliciously flavorful rice! Update: I used 1/4 soya sauce, half a pack of onion soup mix, and chicken boullion instead of beef and left the rest the same. I used 2 small pork roasts that totalled almost 4 pounds, put them in my larger crockpot (5 or 6 quarts, definitely larger than 4 quart) and covered the roasts with water. Cooked on low for 5 hours--PERFECT!

This was so good. I didn't have thyme in the house, so in place of the rosemary & time I used Fine's Herbs. Best French dip sandwich we've ever had, and the taste just got better with the leftovers!

I browned the meat first. I also followed previous suggestions and used low sodium soy sauce. Best french dip sandwich I have ever had!  Hubby asked me to add it to the tried and true recipe rotation!

I followed this recipe exactly except for using a 2 pound roast.  The gravy smelled delicious, but was extremely salty (inedible).  I carmelized onions and so served the beef drizzled with a little gravy, on toasted buns with cheese and onion and they were still very good.  But the gravy for dipping all went down the drain...

This is a good simple recipe.  I love the flavor of the juice.  My roasts turn out dry though.  I don't know if it is the cut of meat or if I am cooking it too long.  I will try it again though.

This was delicious! I didn't have a bay leaf and it still came out very tasty.  I cut the soy and bullion in half, too, to reduce salt, and it ~still~ was very tasty!  I used toasted onion rolls, horseradish sauce, honey mustard, and mayo - wow - did I mention it was very tasty? Yum.

Tasty sandwiches! I halved the recipe and didn't add so much soy sauce, like others mentioned, and did beef broth instead with water added. Oh and didn't have peppercorns, so didn't use any. Still tasty. But there is this film of fat on the top of the au jus, which isn't very presentation friendly, but I don't want to serve day-old food to my quests (even if it does taste better), so I just kind of took off what I could and left what was there. Tasted great with toasted french bread and provolone.

Very good, just tricky toasting and serving the sandwiches.  Added onions and red/green bell and provolone to sandwich for guests. I only need to cook it for about 8 hrs, used coarsely ground pepper, didn't have whole.  Added a little Worcestershire.  Will make ahead and let au jus set to scrape off fat.

Great recipe! I've made this three times in the last few months and am making it again tomorrow. It is so easy to prepare, makes the house smell great while it is cooking and tastes even better than it smells. I've always loved french-dips at restaurants and this is better than many I've had. I do use the low-sodium soy sauce but everything else I follow exactly. Turns out great!

This recipe is simple and looks as though you have spent much time in the kitchen. I did add a few things. I saute'd some onions and red bell peppers on the stove and placed that over the sandwich with some provolone cheese. I then broiled that for two minutes. The meat was very tender and flavorful.

Family favorite!  I wouldn't change a thing, but be sure to use newer jars of dried spices--esp. rosemary and the bay leaf--to get the full flavor!  I get asked for this recipe all the time--thanks for the original.

This recipe was awesome! The meat was so tasty and tender. I made it exactly as written-except I didn't have a bay leaf. Didn't seem to detract from the flavor though. I will definitely make this again-Espeically since it only took about 10 minutes to get in the crock pot!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Omitted the beef boullion for a can of beef stock.
Toasted the bread (did not have French available at the store) with a slice of swiss cheese and a slice of dill pickle on the side.
I checked the meat and au juice for saltiness after a couple of hours and I did add about a 3/4 cup of water to the stock.

It's a little hard to rate this, since I have a BBQ crock pot, which is much larger than a regular crock pot. I doubled the ingredients because I thought I was probably adding in double the water, but I can't really be sure! I used about half the rosemary/thyme, but I think next time I'd use Italian seasoning. I used low-sodium soy, but it still seemed pretty salty. Most boullion cubes have over 900 mg of salt, so that may have added to it. I still thought it was good, though! I popped it in the oven on Italian bread and melted provolone on it...yum!!

After all the reviews, I was so disappointed.  Way too salty for my family's tastes.  I used ls beef broth and ls soy sauce and still way too salty. Smelled great, may try another time with less soy more water.

This was sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly, and didnt find it too salty. I put the beef on a slightly toasted hoagie bun with some provolone cheese and a little mayo. Will definately make again. It was way better than the french dip sandwiches at our local deli.

Good for its simplicity.  I agree with others that the soy added a diifferent taste, and I can't tell whether that's good or bad.  I used a two and a half pound chuck and the meat had good flavor.

Yum! Husband loves french dip and he said this was the best au jus ever he tasted. I do not think the recipe needed any doctoring but I used chicken bouillion instead, added some worchestire sauce, rice vinegar, a stalk o celery & onion then at the end strained through with cheese cloth.

I added 1/2 package of Itallian dressing as some reviews suggested.  My faily voted this as a keeper.  French dips are supposed to be salty and this recipe turned out perfect!

This was really good!  I ended up using worcestershire sauce instead of beef boullion because I forgot to buy some.  I also used less rosemary and thyme.  I made the sandwiches and then broiled with provolone cheese as others suggested.  It really is a good french dip recipe!  Even my kids liked it!

This was a good starting point.  Like Ladyjaypee, I used a can of reduced-sodium beef broth instead of bouillon.  Only used a few splashes of reduced-sodium soy sauce too, and added about 1/4 cup of water.  I used a few more peppercorns and fresh garlic.  Served on toasted whole wheat french rolls with melted cheese.  Had a salad and fruit on the side.  This was a big hit with my husband and kids!

It's good but waaay too salty even with using low sodium soy sauce and less beef bouillon than listed on the recipe. Next time I'll probably use a combo of two parts beef stock and one part low sodium soy sauce. The salt overpowered everything else about the sandwich. I give it three stars, but only because the flavor of the spices was good, and the meat was nice and tender - otherwise it would be less. *Edit: I used french dip rolls for the sandwiches - toasted before putting the meat in, and then placed two slices of provolone cheese and broiled open faced for a couple minutes until melted.

Great recipe for these hot summer days.  I always add more of the spices asked for in recipes and I did so in this one.  I ground the pepper instead of adding peppercorn and I served on buns.  I also sliced onion and put them in with the roast to cook.  My husband cooked green pepper and onions to add to his sandwich.  Yummm!

My family and I loved this beef.  I never would have thought rosemary and beef would be good paired but it was fantastic.  Easy enough for a weeknight dinner but good enough form company too.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm going to make this again next week.

Everyone enjoyed these sandwiches.  I toasted french rolls in the oven then melted provolone cheese and added the beef.  I would make again, but leave out the rosemary.

So Good! I used a can of beef broth instead of the boullion.  Kids loved as well.  Only recommendation is make sure to use lean beef and trim any visable fat off before cooking.

Great dish!  I used less soy sauce and rosemary as other suggested.  I served  it with "french dip" rolls from the local grocer (they were really soft which I prefer to the crunchy hard rolls).  This is the perfect dish for large gatherings since it's so easy.  I would cook more though since they heat as leftovers so well.

My husband said this is the best sandwich he had ever eaten.  I added a can of beef broth in place of some of the water & it was yummy.  I loved the rosemary!  I was a little skeptical of the soy sauce but it turned out really good.  I will probably buy the lower sodium soy sauce next time but it wasn't too salty to us.  I toasted french bread slices in the oven w/ swiss cheese then put on the meat & dipped away!  I can't wait to make these for friends and family!

This was good.  I think reviewers that thought this was bland might have used cheaper ingrediants.  I used good beef stock, french onion soup (Progresso's), and good microbrew beer.  I did add in a clove of minced garlic, and it tasted yummy.  Made great leftovers the next day as well.  It was plenty salty and I did not need to add extra.

Excellent!  I used less meat because there is only two of us.  I made the same amount of sauce and used French Rolls from Earthgrains, and it turned out great.  This recipe was extremely easy, too!  I got it ready in about 10 minutes in the morning and left it until we got back from classes.  It smelled great!  Thanks!

This is phenomenal! I cut the recipe in half to serve 3, but wish I hadn't b/c by the time I cut out all of the fat, I had nothing for leftovers. Great review ideas listed... I omitted the rosemary, and thought the flavor was perfect. I buttered & toasted sub rolls, then melted provolone on both sides, and I can't imagine this meat on anything else. Delish! My only other alteration was using canned beef broth to cover rather than water. Thanks for an awesome new sandwich!

Very tasty... I did cut the soy sauce back to a 1/4 cup and used a cup of beef broth. After shredding the meat, I did throw in about 1/4 cup of A1 steak sauce to give it just a little more kick and I have to say that it was a great addition. Hubby wanted to know when I was making it again. Thanx for a great recipe.

I cooked a roast in the crockpot overnight with an onion and the herbs with the broth.  I was afraid of the broth being too salty, so I only added 1/4 cup of soy sauce. It turned out, it wasn't salty, so I added a little salt. Maybe because I didn't use all the called for soy sauce? I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I just shredded the the roast and returned it to the broth. Very good!!!

Not very good. Meat came out very salty and dry. This meal was rejected by both my boyfriend and his son.  I thought it was edible, but not something I would choose. Won't be making again.

The ease of the recipe and the tenderness of the meat when it was finished earns this recipe 4 stars. However, after reading all of the tips (ie: cutting the boullion and soy sauce in half) it turned out a little bland. The broth was OK, but not great. I served it with caramelized onions, provalone and toasted garlic french rolls. Will make again, but will follow the recipe to a tee.

Very easy and delicious; great for relaxed entertaining. I cut the soy sauce in half, use beef broth instead of the cube, and cut back on the rosemary (not our favorite). Since I procrastinate for dinner, I usually cook on high for 5-6 hours and it still turns out terrific.

How can you say "so good" over and over again??!! You must toast some sub rolls with provolone on them and add the meat. My 7 year old then asked to have the leftover meat after she finished her sandwhich. Added this to our usual meals!!

Ive made this several times. ALWAYS a hit. The only thing I do differently is add beer to the water to cover it. And half soy sauce and half worcestershire, because we love worcesthershire sauce. Also I add sliced onion to the pot during cooking. SOOO good on good rolls with swiss or provolone. Love it!

This is fantastic - I've made it with several different cuts of beef and it's delicious and tender every time. We've had it as sandwiches with the broth and without the bread with the broth spooned over. Highly recommended!

This was just okay for us.  Following other reviewers' advice, I cut the soy sauce in half and since I was out of garlic powder I used 8 fresh garlic cloves (minced) instead.  The meat was very tender when done and tasty enough, but the au jus that we were supposed to dip the sandwiches in tasted very strongly of rosemary.  I guess we're just not real big rosemary fans.  I will try this recipe again, but will use less rosemary and probably more garlic.

I used reduce sodium soy sauce and cut back on the rosemary.  Put provolone cheese on top and they were to die for.  Oh ya, also used roasted garlic bread instead of french.

Super easy to make, but I think the soy sauce was too strong -- the broth came out kind of salty, especially for the left-overs.  My family liked it, but didn't love it... Will try a different recipe next time.

This was great!  It ended up that we did not have any bread so we used it as a roast.  It was still great!  I turned it on, went to work and it was done when I got home. Very tender.  Great sauce.
