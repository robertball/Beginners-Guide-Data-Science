This soup needs to be thinned out with more cream or chicken stock.

Not as great as I thought it would be.  Tasted too strong (lime, carrots and onions? ack!), was very thick and odd colored (a gooey orange-milky color).  

Gross and not satisfying at all.

We were disappointed with this soup.  The soup was missing something so we added sugar, no help; we added rice vinegar, no help.
