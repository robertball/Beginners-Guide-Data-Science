Since it's freezing outside, I decided not to grill, but baked the chicken instead.  I just put the chicken pieces in a baking dish and covered them with sauce.  I also added one tablespoon of prepared mustard to the sauce as well.  I won't be going back to the bottled stuff again, this sauce was delicious.

I doubled this recipe to feed four. To the sauce I did add a squirt dijon mustard and a touch of Liquid Smoke. This was a quick and easy chicken recipe.

Love to grill but had no time. Doubled the sauce recipe and put four frozen chicken breasts in crock pot, dumped the sauce on top - slow cooked about eight hours. House smelled so good when we got home. Serve with a bagged green salad and microwave baked potatoes with a little extra sauce and some shredded cheese on top. Delicious! Felt like someone had been home cooking dinner for us!

Wonderful recipe - I doubled it and used chili sauce instead of ketchup and put the chicken in the sauce to marinate all day reserving some for basting.  We did the whole thing on the grill and it was very good.

I made this for holiday dinner a few weeks ago.  I didn't have a grill, so I baked it, first covered, then uncovered to get a nice color.  It got very good feedback.

This is a great recipe.  I got quite a few compliments on this one.  I doubled the recipe and it was enough marinade and brushing sauce for 4 medium sized chicken breasts.  I stuck to the recipe as written except for one extra ingredient.  I mixed in a Tablespoon of Louisiana hot sauce to give it a little kick.  It actually didn’t taste all that hot to me, even after adding the hot sauce, but it added just enough heat to offset the sweetness of the sauce.  I used a red onion which gave the sauce a bolder flavor.  Next time I’ll add a little cayenne pepper because I like spiciness, but the recipe is fine the way it is.  After the sauce cooled I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, then put the chicken breasts on a hot lightly oiled grill, and brushed the rest of the sauce on them as they cooked.  Delicious.

This chicken was a hit at our dinner party! I used a whole cut up chicken instead of chicken breasts, and it turned out wonderful!  I increased the sauce 4X, since we like extra sauce on the side.  This is a definite keeper!  Everyone wanted the recipe!

Excellent recipe. I cut the chicken into strips, doubled the sauce without doubling the brown sugar and honey, and added a little chilli powder, marinated them for 5 hours in the fridge, and grilled them on a stovetop grilling pan. My kids love them. Thank you for posting.

Quick and yummy! I didn't do the grilling part and cut the chick into strips. I simply added the chicken after heating the ingredients together. I thought this was really good over rice. Had a sweet flavor. Would definitely make again.

Delicious!  I baked the chicken breasts instead of grilling & it was still a 5 star recipe!  I just poured the cooled sauce over the breasts in a 8x8 dish & threw them in the oven.  No doubts that grilling would be stellar (no outdoor grill here in the city), but baking covered at 350 for 35 minutes turned out moist & flavorful chicken breasts with that flavorful barbecue sauce glazed over the top.  We loved it!  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty if you have the time to marinate it overnight.  I didn't have honey so I did without, but it still tasted great!  Used wings and thighs instead of chicken breast cause we're red meat eaters... terrific!

Seriously delicious.  I was a bit worried when I was making the sauce... it smelled and tasted a lot like sweet and sour sauce.  I ended up marinating overnight, and threw them on the grill.  A giant fire ensued so I took them off the grill, and threw them in the oven with sauce.  Didn't end up tasting like sweet and sour at all! Perfectly balanced and tasty! Thank you!

Firt the picture shows chicken legs and the recipe calls for chicken breast.  While the sauce may be be, i have not tried it yet, any good BBQ knows hat anything BBQed is verslowed cooked.  It takes me about 2+ hours to cook.  Like most Southern cooks I have my own BBQ sauce recipe which is a family secret.  Meat, for the seasoning to be absorbed  must me applied 2-3 hours prior, or over night  I like to brag that when I BBQ chciken and ribs, hens and pigs line up to voulenteer to be my final product!

WE like garlic, so I added extra garlic.  marinate a whole chicken cut-up over night. I had to quickly make another batch of the sauce after putting chicken on the grill,there just wasn't enought to baste with.  We will use this recipe again, only next time I will double the recipe.  will definately use it again.

I'm giving this a 4 because I needed to add something to really give this a barbecue taste.  I followed the directions and tasted the sauce before putting on the chicken and I knew it was missing something.  I added a few drops (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) of liquid smoke.  That was it.  Now it tastes like barbecue sauce and is 5 stars!  Yummy!  Will make this again.

My family loves my slightly altered version:  I use half the sugar and honey, and add a squeeze of lemon or lime juice.  Yesterday I cooked 8 chicken drumsticks in the slow cooker with this marinade; 8 hours on low.  Absolutely delicious!

This is so good! I left out the vinegar because I didn't have any but added a little Dale's sauce and a splash of Jack Daniel's whiskey. Baked it in the oven and it turned out great. Maybe next time will coat the chicken lightly with flour so the sauce will stick better. I'm thinking about shredding chicken & putting this on baked potatoes--yum. Thanks for the great recipe!

Holy cow, this chicken is AMAZING!  I've tried quite a few bbq chicken recipes from this site and this is the first that really blew my tastebuds away.  My bf, who really isn't a fan of bbq chicken but is a good sport and eats it when I make it anyway, took one bite of this chicken and said, "We're having this one again, right?"  I didn't change a thing and followed the recipe exactly.  It will now be the ONLY bbq sauce we use in our house.  Thanks so much Amanda!

This is a good recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it did not taste much like barbecue sauce. It tastes more like a sweet and sour sauce. Although it is still good it was just not what I was expecting. I am still looking for a good homemade barbecue sauce.

Hubby gave this a 2, said it was too bland.  I doubled the recipe and kept the honey and brown sugar at 1/4 cup.  I added a few shakes of hot sauce. I thought it was pretty good and worth trying again.

Marinated the chicken for about 8 hours in the sauce before grilling them up.  Great flavor and the sauce is easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

I, too, was concerned that it would be too sweet, but it was perfect.  Every picky eater in my family cleaned their plate, including my one-year-old.  This one's a keeper!

I served this at a BBQ this weekend and everybody raved about this chicken and what a great cook I am.  I marinated it overnight, but I think all day would be enough.  I was concerned that it would be too sweet but it wasn't.  It was very tender and tasty.

I've made this several times. The first time, I didn't include the worcestershire sauce because I didn't think I'd like it. The result was too sweet and really felt like it was missing something- so I tried it with the worcestershire and cut back a bit on the brown sugar and it was just perfect!
I love this especially because unlike store bought sauces, this is gluten free!

This makes an excellent sauce for chicken.  It's almost like a cross between sticky and BBQ chicken.  Very easy, and had all of the ingredients on hand; this will become a staple in my house.

Delicious though a little sweet for our tastes. (I'll delete the honey and sugar next time and increase the garlic)

I like this recipe because it doesn't have all that chili powder or cumin flavoring, that most BBQ sauces do.

Yum!!!!!!!  This barbecue sauce is excellent.  Very yummy.  Store-bought barbecue sauce will never live up to this!  Thanks for the share!

I made these in the oven since I don't own a grill and they were still pretty good.  I quadrupled the recipe and found that it was way too much sauce for cooking in the oven.  The chicken tasted great, but like I said, sauce overload.  The sauce was a little on the sweet side.  I added a couple of shakes of chili powder because it tasted too sweet with not enough tang, but I guess I needed more chili powder for it to really make a difference.  All in all, it was pretty good.  I'll make it again and see what I can do to make it a little less sweet.  My 2 1/2 year old ate it all up and my 11 month old begged for more (can't really talk, but he stood by my side begging for more...I think he ate more than I did!).  I served it with the "Perfect Baked Potato" (and those were out of this world fantatic...just like a steak house would do a baked potato) and a green salad.  Thanks for the recipe...it hit the spot for my craving of BBQ chicken.

I believe this was the best chicken my wife and I've ever eaten.  The amount used to feed four fed my wife and I just fine.  We used three breasts weighing about a 1LB.  

I did add a pinch more garlic, some additional honey and some Essence by Emeril - Fantastic!!

This was a really nice bbq sauce/ sweet-sour sauce. Shakespeare said "a rose by any name would smell as sweet"! Doesn't matter what you call it, it tastes good, and a definite keeper. Some slight changes i made: I used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce (because I didn't have any of the latter) and regular white spirit vinegar and a dash of brown vinegar, because that's what I had. I also added a Tbsp of bbq sauce in a bottle, it was the last dollop left so I didn't want it to waste, but it made a good difference. All else stayed the same. I marinated chicken breasts for half an hour, pan fried them and simmered with the sauce. It was lovely and saucy. Good recipe!

If it weren't for the onion pieces I'd drink this through a straw right out of the pan!!!  Made it exactly as stated only used canola oil instead of olive oil (didn't have it).  Can't wait for dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wouldn't rate it if I hadn't followed the recipe exactly. I cannot figure out why everyone thinks it's so good. Even my son said the kitchen smelled bad. It seemed fine until I added the Worcestershire sauce. Then it really seemed unappetizing. We went through with it thinking cooking would help. Luckily, we had some store-bought sauce to mask the chicken when it was done.

This recipe was great. Rather than use a bbq, I made the sauce, poured it over chicken pieces and baked it in the oven for 1 hour at 350. Then I thickened the sauce and served it over rice. We absolutely loved it! This is a keeper!!

This was really, really good.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I decreased the sweet ingredients - only used about 2 tbsp honey and 3/4 cup brown sugar - and thought the flavors were wonderful.  I liked the touch of putting the chicken back in the sauce after the grill.  We used bone-in chicken breasts and drumsticks for two generous servings plus leftovers.  This one will definitely be in the regular rotation, despite the mess it made on the grill!

A nice chicken dish. I used this over chicken pieces. I baked them for one hour covered and then twenty minutes uncovered. It came out flavorful and tender.

We really enjoyed this sauce and the chicken was very moist. I made this with less sugar by using sugar free ketchup, Splenda brown sugar and didn't add the honey. It was plenty sweet enough without the added honey. I also put in 1/2 tsp of an oriental chili/garlic sauce and that added a little bit of heat to it.

I used the sauce to marinate the chicken breasts throughout the day, reserving some for basting sauce. I made a large batch since I was making 4# of chicken and it didn't go to waste. My husband grilled the chicken thoroughly instead of brining it in and simmering it in the sauce as the recipe states. The chicken is wonderful and very tender. Received compliments by all. My 2 1/2 year old loved it.

My favorite marinade!!! I will never use another as long as I live, and I've tried them all. I always double the recipe because my family requests extra sauce on their plates everytime I make it. The sauce or glaze rather reminds me of the Jack Daniels sauce served at TGIF's. Thank you for sharing this.

A very good, very easy chicken recipe that I will definitely be repeating.  I made it two days in a row- once for my boyfriend and I, and once for my family.  Both had rave reviews!  I doubled the recipe and used chili sauce instead of ketchup.  I also used garlic oil instead of olive oil and garlic.  Doubled the recipe to make four breasts.  It turned out wonderful!

I am giving this 5 stars with a caveat.... First, there is no question that this is a great recipe!  My kids gave it 5 stars and then some. 
I used the bottled chili sauce instead of the ketchup but thought it could still use a little more zip.  Not sure what I would do to bump it up a notch.  Overall it was still really good and like I said my boys really loved it.

This was very good. I did it with pork ribs. I simmered the ribs on low heat for one hour in the sauce, then cooled the ribs and sauce. I then marinated them overnight in the fridge in the sauce. The next day I put them on the BBQ, basting with the sauce as they cooked. They were so tender and juicy.

Good, but waaay too sweet! I added more vinegar, some red pepper flakes and a little smoked paprika.  This made the sauce much more palatable for someone raised on Carolina-style barbecue but who also likes a "sticky" sauce every now and then!

So yummy - and so much better than the bottled stuff from the store.  This is the first time that I have made my own BBQ sauce, and it was so simple, and so worth it.  The only mistake I made was not making enough.  My kids don't usually go nuts for BBQ chicken, but when they finished their piece, they were looking for more!

I made this as written, although I grilled them for 30 min.  I put the sauce on first, and then again for the last 5.  My family ate twice the amount of chicken they normally do... the kids requested thirds.

Overall I just didn't think this was anything great, and it was also too much on the sweet side for me.  Once cooked down, things are never quite as strong so it was hard to say how sweet it would be until done.  I pretty much did cook it as is, except that I could tell the chicken would burn before getting done, so I put it in the microwave for just a bit and then returned it to the grill to finish. There was plenty of sauce for that amount of chicken.  I have to wonder how many people didn't notice it's only for 2 chicken breast halves and only 2 servings as well... it wasn't meant to be enough for a whole chicken.

We were so excited to try this after reading the reveiws, but ended up really disappointed. Living in KC, my family is used to some pretty good barbecue.  No one liked this at all. It tasted like chinese chicken with the heavy glaze. Way to sweet for us.

It's a favorite alright.  My son said, 
"You need to make this again!"  It will definitely go into the rotation. Like another reviewer, I baked it instead of grilling.  I live in apartments that don't allow the use of outside grills :(  I sprinkled 3 breasts w/ cajun seasoning and baked for about 10 minutes on 375. Then I poured the sauce over the breasts (I doubled the sauce), covered with foil and cooked until done. Not sure how long it was, I just kept checking them. Then I took the foil off and let the sauce get just a little thick then served with rice and veggies.  Yummy yummy yummy **Update** I made this again, this time with drumsticks and I put them in the slowcooker on low while I was at work, about 6 hours. Then I put them in the oven on 300 until the skin was slightly crisp. Yummy again - my husband liked this version more than the baked breasts.

excellent! i made 1.5 times the amount of sauce to make sure we had enough for 3 large boneless breasts. the barbeque flavor is just about perfect where it is however you can get it where you like by increasing the cider vinegar a notch for tartness or increase the brown sugar a tad for a sweetness. many thanks amanda!

Just finished dinner and the best  chicken I have had in ages! It was so moist and tender...this recipe is a keeper, printed and in my files. I doubled the recipe, and had lots left over. I had no vinegar so had to get creative and used Italian dressing! I also substitued chopped dried garlic for the minced clove of garlic. It worked great. Barbequed on the grill this is definately a family and company dish.  Thanks, Amanda Anne!

Loved this recipe.  I too don't like hot BBQ sauce or Mexican spices in mine, so this really fit the bill.  It is great on pork chops in the crock pot and I have put it on pork in the pressure cooker and it was wonderful.

this was good, almost a little too sweet though. my partner really loved it.
the honey/brown sugar loves to make the bbq flame up so make sure to watch the grill closely.

Really a great barbeque sauce!  I thought it might be too sweet but once the chicken was cooked with it on it was perfect!  Only thing I did different was add about 1 tsp liquid smoke and marinade the chicken in the cooled sauce for about 2 hours before grilling.  Will definitely make again.........and often!

This tasted terrific! I didn't have any cloves of garlic so I added garlic salt instead of the regular salt. I also added just a little less of the worcestershire sauce. I quadrupled the amount but didn't need to add as much olive oil as it called for making that much. My husband was impressed, and the kids loved it!

This was a great recipe!  I used chicken tenders (because that is what I had) and doubled the recipe.  I used some of the sauce to marinate the chicken put in the frig for about 30 min. and then while grilling the chicken added sauce to both sides (cooked on treated aluminum foil to keep down the mess).  Liked the taste so much that with remainder sauce used as a dip for the chicken.  Will definately make this again.

This is a great homade sauce. My wife won't let me use any other BBQ sauce's from the store. It's best to let this sauce simmer to thicken then finish on low to let the flavors meld. Tastes great on every thing!

Made this and I and my family were not enthused. It is very sweet and kind of bland.  I halved the honey and brown sugar and it was still too sweet. Would not make again.

I, personally, love the sauce!  I don't care for spicy, hot, or smoky sauce.......sweet and tangy is how I roll!  I make plenty and freeze it so I always have it ready for pulled sandwiches, or just anything that needs a kick.

I left out the garlic as it does not agree with me, and I added the mustard with some smoked paprika and chipotle oil.   Put chicken thighs into a baking tray and covered them with the sauce.  Baked in the oven for 15 minutes.  Delicious!

Very sweet.  I simmered my sauce much longer on a very low heat and it brought out the onion flavor.  With so much sugar it burns easily on the grill.  It would be better to brush the chicken with oil, grill and baste with sauce at the end.  Will mince the onion and reduce the honey slightly next time.

I also just baked this. I was worried about the sauce because of other reviews and when I tasted it prior to putting on the chicken, I choked because of the strong vinegar presence. But somehow when it baked, it didn't bug me anymore. The chicken was moist all the way through and my 3 year old (who refuses to eat meat usually) ate a whole breast all on her own! I will make it again, it's not a lot of work and we don't eat bottled BBQ sauce... but few can top this one anyway.

I made a few changes based on what I had. I sprayed my crock pot with coconut oil. I chopped in half red potatoes , sprinkled with garlic salt oregano and lemon pepper. Layered bottom of crock pot with potatoes. Browned skin on bone in chicken thighs (coz that's what I had). Made sauce exactly but I used red onion, less brown sugar and a Trollope of Dijon and woodsy.  
It would be a five if I had grilled it as poster had written

Made this for friends tonight and everyone loved it. I wouldn't change the recipe at all. I cooked 8 chicken breast and tripled the sauce recipe. It was enough to baste a couple of additional times as I turned the chicken while cooking. Already emailed the recipe to our friends.

This was a big hit in my house.  I am not a fan of barbecue sauce, but, I thought this one was pretty good because it had a nice tang and didn't use molasses.  My husband loved it though!   It was quick and easy to get together.  I did have to simmer my sauce for about 15 minutes to get the consistency I wanted.   I also didn't add the chicken back to the pan because I didn't have a pan that could go on the grill.  Very tasty!

Finally, a new recipe I actually like. Just a warning to anyone making this... The sauce initially smells pretty disgusting, at least it did to me and my kids. I was sure this was going to be gross but pleasantly surprised at how good it turned out to be . The chicken blackens on the BBQ if it's too hot so make sure you have it on a low setting. I cooked the chicken breasts on the grill for 14 minutes (7 on each side) and then 8 minutes (4 on each side) in the stove. The chicken was overcooked so I would only cook it 10 max on the BBQ and then another 10 on the stove. Great dish and my kids loved it. Definitely a keeper. :)

My husband really liked this! Instead of dipping chicken in sauce first, I put the chicken on my foreman grill about 5-7 mins, then into sauce snd back to grill another 10 and finally back in the skillet. To make it an Asian bbq all u need is fresh ginger and red pepper flakes, yummy :)

I doubled the amount of sauce and put it on a whole chicken. I don't have a grill so I popped it in the oven. My boyfriend really liked it but I thought it had just a hint too much of vinegar. Still, this one's a keeper.

Seriously, the best chicken. Even with boneless skinless chicken breasts, it's very moist. My kids ask me to make extra so that they can eat leftovers.

I have made this recipe many times since getting it from this sight. The whole family loves it.  I double the recipe, just not the apple cidar vinegar. The best barbecue sauce I've ever eaten. Will never use the ones purchased from a store again.
Thanks

Very tasty. However, I advise not following the exact directions. Dipping uncooked chicken in the same sauce as cooked chicken is a good way to get salmonella.

GREAT recipe---friends and family kept raving about it.  I will definitely pass it on with no problem----I've always thought that those that won't give out their recipes are just snobs.  Life is short!!  Share, for Pete's sake!!!!

This is my family's new favorite for grilled chicken!  I did make one small change; used bone-in chicken thighs, drumsticks and wings, but I didn't touch the recipe otherwise.  Will make often.

A very big hit in our house with two picky kids loving this dish. However, If you double the recipe I would consider not doubling the garlic. It can get pretty overwhelming!

I have made this about 4 times and has become our family favorite. I have both grilled and baked this dish and both time came out great. Kids won't let me use any other BBQ sauce.

The sauce never thickened enough to stick to the chicken-I simmered 30 min. I did marinate the chicken for about 7 hrs. The ketchup & vinegar were the only flavors that stuck out in this-otherwise pretty blah. Sorry:(

This chicken tasted like chinese food to me.  I could have served it on white rice and called it Kung Pao Chicken and nobody would have known the difference.  I'm not saying it's bad, we liked it.  It's just not very much like BBQ sauce.

Oh MAN was that good! I don't have a grill so I just made the sauce in a skillet, poured it into a saucepan, lightly boiled it while I sauteed my chicken breasts, then poured it over the breasts and simmered (covered) for about 5 minutes. I served it with plain brown rice and we scarfed it down. We were practically licking our plates! One note: it made enough sauce for at least 3 pieces of chicken. It would also make a great dipping sauce for chicken nuggets!

I made this barbecue sauce for about 10 people so I had to multiply the recipe by about 10, but I can't tell you how many genuine compliments I got. Even my picky sister LOVED IT. It was easy to make and delicious!!!  I will also never go back to the bottle stuff.

I made this exactly as the recipe states last night and it was great! The only difference is that I used chicken legs and breasts and grilled them entirely on the grill.  The sauce was very easy to make and so very good.  I did triple the recipe as I was making a lot of chicken.  It thickened up nicely and coated the chicken in a very tasteful glaze.  My 3yr old daughter and BF both enjoyed this.  I look forward to making it again and using it on baked chicken and possibly pork chops!

This is my new favorite sauce! It was amazing on boneless thin cut porkchops. I didn't have honey or vinegar or worcestire, but I thought I'd try it anyway! I skipped the honey & vinegar, and used 2 tablespoons of BBQ sauce. (I had to double the sauce to cover 6 chops). I dipped the chops in the glaze and grilled them for about 15 minutes without returning them to the skillet because they were perfect...a little overdone, if anything. We will be making this again for sure!

Well I too quadrupled this recipe but only put in half a cup each of the sugar and honey.  I probably could've even pared it down a bit more.  Also don't add the full amount of worcestershire, it's stong enough with just a couple of tablespoons.  Pretty good...very tangy and sweet.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though my grill burned the chicken! The parts that didn't burn were delicious & even my picky husband enjoyed it. Thank you so much.

This was really good! A tad sweet, so next time I may cut down the brown sugar by 1 T.  But I will be making this one again!  Served with brown rice and steamed asparagus.

I doubled the recipe. I substituted the honey for maple syrup as I didn't have an honey on hand.  I also added a couple of tbsp of Dijon mustard.  We used this sauce on chicken kebabs and BBQ'd them.  The sauce was very good and the BBQ chard some of the sauce which brought out the sweetness.  We will make this again.

Easy and convenient but turned out a little dry.  I added chili sauce in addition to ketchup.  Both husband and son didn’t like it much which is unusual because we love BBQ chickens.

OMG! Delish! Just finished eating and was amazed at the flavours. Hubby loved it too ... will be part of the regular meal rotation. Quick and easy, served with broccoli and rice with sauce drizzled on top ... will likely experiment with incorporating some pineapple next time. YUMMY!

Made this tonight for the family.  BBQ sauce turned out great as did the chicken.

Had to cook the chicken a bit longer as they were really big. Instead of cooking on the grill for 10 to 15 minutes, I used a digital thermometer and cooked it until it reached an internal temp of 165 degrees.  (I wish more recipes would give the finish internal temp)

I served the re-heated sauce in the side if anyone wanted more.

I also server corn-on-the-cob as well as a green salad with fresh Jersey tomatoes.

Family very happy campers.

Our family loves this. We've done it exactly as stated in recipe and we've chosen to just cook it completely on grill. Both tast great. Finishing it on the skillet does make it totally amazing.

Delicious! These were a huge hit with my family, a great simple recipe for summer. The BBQ sauce wasn't as thick as I'd have liked but otherwise bien!

It is a great marinade and great for basting however the taste was lacking when used for dipping sauce.

I have made this 3x now and everyone-no matter what their tastes- loves this BBQ sauce! I've used it for on the grill, when I make shredded BBQ chicken, and for cocktail meatballs instead of the standard grape jelly sauce. This is THE best ever. The only thing I did different for my shredded chicken. I added a few dashes of liquid smoke mesquite for a subtle smokiness.  An interesting note: The first time I made it, plans got shifted so I wasn't able to use it that night. It sat in the fridge for almost a week. When I grilled with it, the flavors had melded together and it was sooo thick. This is my favorite 'tweak' for the recipe.  Like others have said, this is the only BBQ sauce I will ever use again...mmmm!

This recipe tasted pretty good.  We grilled them and instead of taking them back to the skillet, we just basted them several times while on the grill.  I'm just afraid the recipe reminded us too much of Arby's sauce.  We are going to try it again.

Very good made with chicken breasts and made sandwiches out of them.  Added a little provolone cheese to them.  It was perfect.  Gave it to someone that enjoyed that it did not have a real strong barbecue flavor.

I was a bit worried how my boyfriend would like this (he likes spicy sauces mostly) but I'm glad I made it because we really enjoyed it!  I added some sliced mushrooms in with the onions and oil, along with a few green chile peppers (chopped small) for my bf's taste.  We live in an apartment so I didn't end up grilling.  What I did was cook the sauce in a skillet, transfer most of it to a bowl, then cooked the chicken breast (which I marinated for about an hour in some Honey Dijon Vinaigrette) in the same skillet with a bit of sauce still in it.  Towards the end, I went ahead and dumped all of the sauce over the chicken and let it simmer for a few more minutes.  For a side, I cooked up some Uncle Ben's Long Grain Rice.  Instead of making one of my other sauces for the rice, I drizzled some leftover sauce from the chicken.  Great Recipe!!  I can't wait to try it out on the grill!   Thanks Amanda Anne!

Wasn't that impressed with this one.  The sauce was just okay for me, nothing I would crave in the future.  And marinading the chicken may be in order for this recipe, as the inside of my chicken breasts tasted like plain old chicken.  All in all, I could take it or leave it.

Wow. This turned out so darn good and I really cut corners because I was short on time. But STILL turned out amazing. Followed the sauce recipe exactly and used red onions. Used chicken thigh meat, placed them in a casserole dish, poured the sauce over it (didn't wait for it to cool), and threw it in the oven. My bf absolutely loved it. Served with rice pilaf and corn on the cob. Definitely a keeper.

I double the recipe as some suggested and it gave plenty of extra sauce.  My family said it was just okay, too much vinegar and ketchup taste for us.  Also, a little too sweet.

Fantastic!! I doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers for lunch tomorrow (and used my Betty Crocker instead of a BBQ because it's winter) but my hubby had seconds, so no leftovers after all! The sauce was AMAZING and the chicken was evenly cooked and juicy.

This turned out very good...but I changed a couple of things.  I doubled the amount of ketchup and honey...as a personal preference towards a sweeter and less bold taste.  My kids raved over it!  I will be making this again.

This recipe was amazing! Very flavorful and simple to make. I didn't grill it, cooked right on the stove top. I would totally double up on the sauce per everyone's suggestion. I looked over the recipe and realized after I had cooked all the chicken that I totally forgot the apple cider vinegar...but the chicken still came out delicious!

I added a half teaspoon of hot pepper flakes and used a little less brown sugar.  This really does have the flavor of something served at a Chinese resturant - and my family loved it.

I must have done something wrong because of the ratings. But I did not care for this at all! My friend said it was good but I thought it was awful. So I knew I didn't have bad ingredients because he liked it.  I marinated it over night and the taste went through it. The marinated sauce smelled so bad and it tasted as bad as it smelled.  I took the chicken and cut it open and put some Jack Daniel barbecue sauce over it and marinated it for another hour. That sauce masked the taste of this one so I could eat it.  But I just can't get over the smell.

Nice flavor and everyone enjoyed however, I found the sauce to be lacking in robustness.  Changes (next time): decrease honey/brown sugar and a couple dashes of smoked flavoring, and cayenne pepper.  Everyone liked the recipe - will make again.

I have been searching for a BBQ chicken recipe that is really good and this is definitely it!  I love that it goes back in the sauce to cook--makes it very tender and saucy!

This is the first time I have made my own BBQ sauce, and this was amazing!!  I followed the recipe, except using minced onion (didn't have an onion on hand)and adding a couple drops of liquid smoke, which I believe made it perfect.  I will never buy my BBQ Sauce again!  Thanks

This was too much work for a BBQ sauce that was just "ok".

I was not as impressed with the recipe as everyone else.  I doubled it and found that the cider vineger taste was very overwhelming.  I must say my guests enjoyed it.  If I made it again I would lay off the vinegar a little, maybe it's just a personal choice.

New variation on bbq chicken. I used boneless, skinless breasts. My family raved over this. The sauce is amazing.

The best I've ever made, anyway.  This turned out very good, even my picky kids liked it.  The only change I made was maple syrup because I didn't have any honey in the cupboard.  Thanks!

This recipe was a big hit with the entire family. I didn't have as much honey as the recipe called for, so I added a little Karo Syrup.  It was not too sweet for our tastes....it was just right.

Very good, but our family actually thought it was a little too tangy.  We will use it again though, with some slight adjustments.
