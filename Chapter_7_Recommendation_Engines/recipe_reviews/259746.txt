This didn't rise like I expected with so much baking powder in it. Rather dense, but still tasty. I added 1/2 cup of raisins along with the walnuts.

This is a delicious bread that is moist and flavorful. I substituted oat flour for ww and cassava, used arrowroot as the thickener and added a cup of blueberries. Turned out perfect! This will become a regular of mine for family or holidays!
