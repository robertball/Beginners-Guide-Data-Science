It's the perfect blackening mixture!!  Had it on Salmon.  I also reduced the sugar to about a tsp and found that to be just right.  Have shared the recipe with 3 other people already

I had never "blackened" anything before and was skeptical at the beginning because it smells strange when it starts to cook, but the end result was delicious.  I can't wait to experiment with this seasoning again.

I have never had anything blackened, but my husband and son love blackened fish, so i gave it a try.
The only change I made was to reduce the salt to 1 tsp.
I have to say this will now be served on a regular basis at my house!  It is a great seasoning.

I'm only giving this one two stars because its basically the same rub as the one used for Herb Rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast. It was good, but tasted the same, even with the difference of nutmeg, sugar, and cumin. Those are some expensive spices! The amounts vary between the recipes, obviously, because one is meant for a single roast and the other is meant to be stored. Save yourself the trouble and costs of extra ingredients and stick to the Sirloin rub.

We used halibut with this recipe and cooked it on a really hot cast iron griddle.  The result was fantastic.  I had cut the fist into strips and we put them into fish tacos when it was all done. Yum!

I did adjust the salt just a bit because we're watching our sodium intake. This was just what I needed, thanks.

I love to make up a big batch - I love to mix it with flour (about half and half), coat tilapia sprinkled with lime juice and salt and pepper, and pan fry it. Top with lime zest and a lime and chiplole "crema".  Delish!

This is the second time I've made this and it's better, hands down, than any pre-mixed blackening seasoning I've ever bought.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I do not know enough to know what is "authentic" in a Blackening Mix and what is not but I do know I liked the taste of this blend. I wanted to blacken tilapia and decided to use this recipe and was happy I did. I only used 1 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar just because I wasn't sure about using a full tablespoon. I wanted to use the sugar because the submitter noted it carmalized and this was appealing to me. I'm looking forward now to using this often. Thanks Tom!

My husband loves Blackened chicken and he liked this seasoning blend. My complaint is the ""blackening process is a pain and smokes up the kitchen so make on a cool day or outside on the grill so you can have plenty of air circulation. It's only a special occasion dish for me.

Great seasoning! I have only used it for fish so far, but it came out great. I, too, would cut down on the sugar.

This was delicious seasoning..I tried on red fish first and it was not a good type of fish. I then tried chicken..absolutely delicious...and the shrimp was to die for. Tonights catfish was just as delicious too. I used the recipe as is other than cayenne which was reduced to half...and it was perfect. (Not so hot you lose taste but spicy...)

Very good flavor.  We made 12 servings for a package of chicken (1-1/2 breasts) and it was a perfect amount.

The only "blackened" foods I had in the past was purchased from a store.  I wanted to make my own Blackened Salmon so I did a search and came across this recipe.  I mixed it as written, except I used Splenda instead of sugar. This stuff is great!  I read here some use it on Tilapia, so I will try that next.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe!

I made this as directed (minus the nutmeg since I didn’t have any on hand). It made a nice amount to use for several recipes. I used it on tilapia for fish tacos. It turned out great! Everyone ate the fish including my picky kids!

I've never had anything "blackened" so maybe it should be this way but to me the thyme was overwhelming and I didn't even use all that was asked for, but my boyfriend thought it was good on the chicken I made, so very well could be just me.

This was very good. I made it as written. I did grind the thyme in a mortar and pestle a little first. That's just personal preference.

I was a little skeptical when I started this but I mixed it as per recipes, except I have cut the cayenne in half as we are not very spicy people lol, it was awesome!!! The chicken had the most amazing color, and the flavor 5 stars!!! I used this to make blackened chicken alfredo pizza delicious!! Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good rub on Swordfish. I brushed olive oil on swordfish steaks and sprinkled this rub on fish. Marinated for 30 minutes and then grilled. Very nice depth of flavor and spicy. Perfect for Swordfish!

I would give it ten starts if I could.  This is a great seasoning!  I have made shrimp, chicken, catfish.  I started buying different foods just so I could use this seasoning on them!  I didn't change one thing!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Made this exactly to the recipe. Used it on a butterflied chicken breast and served it on a salad. Everyone loved it!

Used this seasoning to make fish tacos. Sprinkled lightly on filets before grilling in a cast iron pan. Yum!

Super versatile, and has become my go to for salmon. 
Reduced the sugar a bit, but it's more there for browning than flavor.

Wonderful!  I have used this on boneless skinless  chicken breasts 3 times in the past 2 weeks!  Just coat the chicken and toss in a preheated, lightly oiled cast iron skillet and serve with a fresh salad!  A super quick, easy weeknight dinner.   The only change I make is to cut the cayenne pepper as my family doesn't like too much heat. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this recipe for a 12-person Taco Night crowd.  I added it to ground turkey, and to cubed tempeh.  Made no changes and followed recipe exactly - it was delicious!

We loved it! Thanks for this mixture! I  made this with chicken breast and cooked them in a pan with olive oil,  I  put it over a spanish rice.  We all agreed will be good with shrimp or fish as well. Only one not happy was my three year old.

This is a great seasoning blend. That said, the only change I made was to cut the thyme in half, and omit the salt, as I use a dry salt brine on the meats I cook.  Dredged the fish in melted butter, then seasoned it and put it in a screaming hot pan on the grill. Bon Apetit!

The only change iI made was taking out some of the salt after reading a review, that was a mistake.  Did this recipe with walleye and my guest said they couldn't get this in a restaurant that was this good.  My first time to make any blackened fish so if I can do it anyone can.  Thank for sharing.

Fabulous!!  This is the first "blackened seasoning" that I've tried and it is over the top good!   My skeptical hubby even really like it.   The chicken comes out tender and tastes perfect.

I used this on fresh caught red snapper my husband brought home from his fishing trip!  It was great!  I cut  back on the thyme some because I am iffy on liking dried thyme, but you know what?  I could have done the whole measurement!  This rub on our fish with a little lime juice  squeezed over at the end was perfect :)

This seasoning was delicious. I tried it on chicken tenders sautéed in a little oil. I found it a little sweet, so I would probably reduce the sugar next time. Other than that, perfect. My husband moaned with delight as he ate it. We are definitely having this again.

I have made this a few times, no adjustments. I used with salmon on spinach, tasted great. Seasoning should go well for grilling and smoking- so far have used the seasoning to pan fry. Not too spicy, good flavor. Went well with a peanut glaze too.

This was very good :) was well worth four stars and simple to do. I added more garlic and onion powder and reduced the amount of sugar to better suit my tastes though.

This is a great mix - I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the oregano in half, but otherwise stuck with the recipe - We used it on Tilapia and it was delisious - later in the week my husband used the rub on some chicken breasts and that was also wonderful - definitly a keeper!!  Next batch I may kick up the cayenne.

This is far better than any seasoning I've purchased for blackening. Great on fish, chicken, and shrimp. I've even used it on roasted veggies. Excellent flavor without too much heat. Keeps well also.

Love this recipe.  I used it once, and didn't save it.  The second time I wanted it, I made sure to bookmark it.  I love the authentic spices in this recipe.

This is great! Reminds me of a seasoning we used in the south. I'd like it to have just a bit more bite to it but it is perfect if you're serving those who prefer less bite as well as those who prefer more.
