I really liked this. I didn't change anything. I used a 12oz bag of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot mixture for my veggie mix. Def a keeper and will make again!

Very good! I did use a whole 32oz. carton of chicken broth instead of a small can b/c I wanted to make sure that there was enough for all of us, and that worked fine. Also, I had some fresh spinach that needed used up, so I threw that in too, which was a nice addition. Very easy to make...I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)
