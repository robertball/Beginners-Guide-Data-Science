My husband and I are big fans of authentic Mexican restaurants and he was always hinting that I should be able to cook like that too. Well, you should have seen the look on his face when I made these tacos and they tasted EXACTLY like the ones we had eaten there!!  Not bad for a gringo!! :-)

I've tweaked the recipe a little - I buy really thinly cut pieces of meat and then cut them into small cubes (that's the way they do it at the restaurants I've had this dish in) and then I  marinate the beef in some lime juice and salt and pepper first. I also cook the onions and pepper for a few minutes before adding the beef and cilantro and leave some raw for garnish. I also make the pico de gallo recipe on this site to serve with it. It's also not bad served with flour tortillas if you want to avoid the oil from frying the corn tortillas.

Tasted great, but just a note to inexperienced cooks like myself: wear gloves when you chop the jalapenos! I didn't know any better, and chopped them up with my bare hands. My hands were painfully burning for hours.

Being from the Northeast I never ate much Mexican but when I briefly lived in the Midwest I learned to make these sort of tacos. The locals called them tortillas but I later found out the tortilla was just the corn wrapping and not the name of the dish. We made them with all the usual taco fillings like seasoned hamburg, lettuce and tomato, onions, cheese, sour cream and taco sauce. The secret is the soft corn tortilla that you do not fry until it is crunchy but rather until it is limp and pliable. It frys very fast. Plop one at a time in the hot oil. It will puff up, then turn it. When it puffs again remove it immediately to drain the oil on a paper towel. The dish known as soft tacos is usually made with the already soft flour tortilla. I way love these soft corn tortillas better than those and the crunchy corn type.

WOW WOW WOW!!!!  These are absolutely the BEST THING I HAVE MADE FROM THIS SITE!  If you are into "Americanized" mexican food, then these tacos aren't for you.  However, if you love traditional mexican, then you MUST TRY these!  My entire family can't get them out of their head.  We have had them 3 times in 8 days.  The flavors are simple but come together to make an incredible authentic tasting taco.  LOVE THESE!  We prepared the recipe exactly as written.  I highly recommend you try them.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!. The simplicity of flavors is wonderful. At first I was worried about the jalapeno being too hot (first time making authenic mexican food) but, it wasn't at all. The lime was delicious and we added cumin and a touch of garlic salt when frying the meat. I get compliments from everyone that I serve this to..who KNOWS how authentic mexican food should taste like---that would be my in-laws. Flour tortillas, sour cream and chi chi's salsa have no place in a dish like this. Serve with Goya Arroz con Frijoles Negros y Coronas.

I made these for dinner tonight and they are awesome!  Very simple, easy, tasty, and very authentic.  My former neighbors had a housekeeper from Central America and these are very much like the tacos she made for us, except she made the corn tortillas by hand, without a press even!  Do try to get the highest quality top sirloin that you can find - it does make a difference.  I recommend Whole Foods Market all-natural beef, if you have a store in your area.  They are a little more expensive but it is worth it for the taste and tenderness.  Also, if you don't like hot food, remove all the seeds and veins from the peppers before you chop them.  That's where most of the heat comes from.  The only thing that I did differently was, like another reviewer, I marinated the sliced steak with a little fresh squeezed lime, salt, and pepper for about 10 or 15 minutes (just long enough to have a Corona) before I seared it, then added a little more salt and pepper after cooking.  Also coated my cast iron skillet with a tiny amount of oil, just enough to prevent sticking.  Lola, thanks so much for sharing this!!!

I really liked this recipe but I altered it somewhat.  I did not fry the tortillas, just used them soft.  And I cooked my onions with the steak, and then tossed the steak & onions, w/the salt, pepper and lime juice in a bowl and let it sit in the fridge for half an hour.  The steak just cooked in oil by itself did not have much taste.  Also I added shredded cheddar cheese and put homemade guacamole in my taco.

Next time, and I WILL make it again, it was yummy, I will use flank steat b/c the cut the recipe calls for is so much more expensive.  Thank you Lola, I enjoyed this meal and can't wait for my leftovers tonight.

These were terrible.  Way too much oil to fry tortillas and cilantro and lime were not enough to make these taste like anything.  Will not make again.

WOW!  Who knew that these bundles of lightly seasoned steak tacos would be so flavorful!  I was doubtful that it would taste so good but I was wrong!  I wasn't able to find corn tortillas so I purchased flour instead.  I was SCARED of the jalapenos (I DON'T like hot food... rather I can't eat hot food comfortably) but they were fantastic!  The lime and cilantro are the keys to the flavor in my opinion and since I love both I added a little extra on my tacos then my husband's.  I also couldn't help myself but purchased a 5 layer "Mexican" party dip that had salsa, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and diced tomatoes and added 2 spoonfuls to top off the tacos.  Just wonderful!  Met and exceeded my requirements for a weekday family meal which are easy to make, YUMMY, and fast to cook!  My Texan husband was quite pleased with them so I take that as a sign that these are up to par.  :)  I definitely will be making this again in the very near future.

I loved this.  My husband loved this.  My friend loved this as well.  She made it for all of her friends the next day.  Very good.  We cooked the onion and jalapenos with the meet and added the cilantro later.  We also did not fry our flour tortillas, to much fat that way.  But it was wonderful.  I love cilantro, it makes everything better.

My husband is Mexican, and this is the way that tacos are really made. This is the kind of taco sold in restaurants and by street or market vendors; this is about as authentic as it gets. For additional flavor, serve with salsa verde, not Old El  Paso or Pace. Salsa verde is the real stuff, and you can find the recipe on the site. The reviewers who said that this was bland and awful were probably expecting Americanized tacos: hard shells, ground beef cooked with taco seasoning, salsa, shredded cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. While there is nothing wrong with the Americanized variety, this is not what you should expect when you try this recipe.

I am so excited about this recipe! Ik....being from Pennsylvania Dutch Country....this is definitely something I was skeptical to try. It just didn't fit what I know in my mind as a Taco....but I read the reviews and thought.....well I might as well go for it!  Wow wow was I ever thrilled.  I kept thinking to myself that there had to be more to it....but it's simple to make..like 10 minutes...the flavor is different to my taste buds....keeping in mind that east coast has no clue what a street taco tastes like...so I just have to say this is delicious.  I'm so excited that the family loved it and just the fact I tried something new...this recipe is so great.  I will be making these again tonight since I still have the ingredients handy.  This meat and potatoes gal found something that really is a hit!!!!!

For the ones that said that the tacos were to bland, they have to know that authentical mexican tacos are bland. The crunchy ones are for the "american taste". We mexican if we want them crunchy fry the tortillas like this recipe. If the tortilla is completely  crunchy those are not tacos, those are "tostadas" and the tortilla is plain. This is a real mexican recipe, congratulations for sharing part of our healthy and delicious mexican food.

These were excellent. I used the top sirloin that the recipe called for and I cooked it in my wok and it was super tender. The flavor combo in these are perfect and I wouldn't change a thing. This recipe will be used often in my home. Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! Maranite the meat in the lime juice and cilantro. Saute' the vegies, salt, and pepper, in a little oil. Then add your marinated meat. Do not over cook.   YUM! YUM!

To answer to someone else's review, I don't know what the fuss isn't about!  We absolutely love these tacos.  We don't even use onions or jalapenos.  Definitely use top sirloin and salt and pepper it when frying in the oil.  After the tortillas are done make a taco with the steak, and handful of cilantro and a squeezed lime wedge.  We have made these for family who would definitely tell us if they didn't like the recipe but they agreed it was wonderful.  From the other reviews it seems people are trying to "Americanize" this recipe.  Let it be and enjoy.

My husband is from Mexico and these taste EXACTLY like home!  I'm so excited, I want to call all my friends over to show off!  If you want to try a variation of this recipe that would also be authentic, use pork instead of steak, but still have the butcher thinly slice it the same way. Then dice some pineapple for the topping (in addition to the jalepeno,onion, and cilantro.)  Thank you thank you a thousand times over, I will make this recipe forever!!

Yum!  Really enjoyed these tacos and felt they were very authentic tasting.  Next time I would grill the steak and slice into strips, as it was hard to avoid getting the steak overcooked.  Nonetheless, it ws delicious.  I used a jar of diced jalapeno rather than fresh.  Offered both corn and flour tortillas and the corn tortillas were by far the favorite.  I used less oil to warm the corn tortillas.  They seemed to do well with just a bit of oil warmed until flexible.  I then layered them between paper towels.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This is an awesome recipe! I marinated my steak overnight in lime juice. I cooked the steak through, then drained the juice, added in the onion and jalapeno, and cooked just until the onions were slightly soft(my husband is not a fan of cold onions!)and the steak was slightly crispy. I served with the cilantro and lime juice, and added a couple of avacados mashed with a little lime juice. Lola's Horchata from this site topped it off perfectly!! Rave, rave reviews!!  ***Made this with chicken...just as good!!***

Like other reviewers, I couldn't believe how tasty these were.  I scaled the recipe down for 2 people - make sure you don't scale the oil for frying the tortillas.

Also, I put my steak in the freezer for about 1.5 hours before I started cooking.  It made it nice and firm, and easy for me to slice paper-thin.

Fabulous.  I make a similar recipe only I don't fry the shell (warm them in the oven), and top with a small sprinkling of cojita cheese.  My family (even the littlest member) loves them.

I have not tried this recipe but wanted to give a tip to the person who burned her hands with the jalapnoes. I have found that if you roast them under the broiler in your oven the have a wonderful flavor and do not burn your hands. Simply cut off the top, slice in half and lay them skin side up on a piece or foil sprayed with nonstick spray and them put under the hot broiler(with the rack lowered to the second level in the oven) until the skins are browned and blistered. Remove from the oven and wrap up the foil to sort of steam and soften them. Then peel and seed them, you can then dice or put in the food processor to chop them up. My family loves the flavor of the roasted peppers in their food and it makes it much easier to use them.

These really are fantastic. (Granted there is room for improvement.) Definitely good when you are in a time crunch, as they are easily made and cooked. This would also be good for family taco night or Mexican Night! Kids love themed dinners, and this would be great for that! You should try adding some Oaxacan Cheese to really give it the Oaxacan taste!

We REALLY love this recipe. It has become a tradition to serve this at my youngest daughters birthday party in August every year. I serve it buffet style with pico de gallo, guacamole, homemade salsa, sour cream, cheese, black bean soup & limes of course. It all looks so pretty on the table with all the different colors. We've also used different cuts of meats all with great results. A little secret...lean cuts of beef packaged & cut as roasts are much cheaper & just as good.

This recipe is very authentic.  I've been to Mexico, this is how I ate them as well. The only difference is that they served tomato and avacado on the side, and I liked adding them to the taco.  5 star rating for being authentic, and bringing back great memories!

OUTSTANDING!  I marinated the beef in a 1/2 can of Budweiser and the juice of a lime for appr. 24 hours.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. My husband and I ate it all!  I never made fresh taco shells before, and they took a long time to fry.  Next time I will start the shells sooner as the meat was done long before the shells were.

I just made this almost exact recipe last week, just minus the jalepenos. I was trying to replicate "carne asada tacos" I ate at a local taco place. I used a too thin N.Y. strip one day and ribeye another day, which I liked better. It was more crisp like at the taco place. And, when I heated the tortillas I didn't use quite so much oil just a spray. The tortillas would be too greasy otherwise. I also add a tiny bit of chopped tomato to the onion and cilantro mix. I like making the tacos like this because it is quick, as the meat doesn't need to marinate, and if it is good quality steak it tastes great. I also don't have to mix together a pico de gallo. To make it easier to hold, put the meat and ingredients on two stacked corn tortillas, if they are flimsy. This is very delicious!

Thanks so much for posting your recipe!  These are very much like the tacos we get from the "taco truck" whenever we're in Marshalltown, IA.  Yes, we have to travel to the heartland of the USA to get a decent taco, LOL.  The family who runs the truck - It's like a "roach coach", but with a full kitchen inside - adds just a scant sprinkle of crumbled queso fresco and serves the tacos with big slices of lightly sauteed seasoned carrot and a wedge of lime on the side.  I only tweaked this recipe ever-so-slightly to get it to taste like the taco truck tacos.  Marinated the beef in mojo criollo before slicing and cooking quickly in a HOT cast-iron skillet.  This puts a slight crust on the beef, caramalizing the mojo and beef juices.  Let the skillet cool a little before tossing the sliced carrots in there with a squeeze of lime juice mixed with a little sugar and a sprinkle of oregano.  You only want enough sugar to counteract the sourness of the lime and enhance the natural sweetness of the carrot.  The carrots should be more crispy than tender; they barely touch the skillet.  Be generous with the cilantro in the tacos... the light,cool flavor contrasts beautifully with the meat.

This is quick, easy and DELICIOUS!  A great dinner for busy folks who don't want takeout *again*!  I made a few changes to suit my family's taste and this were a huge hit; I was the lucky one who got the leftovers!  I bought a sirloin roast and sliced it up, sauteed the meat then sprinkled it with Goya's Adobo seasoning.  None of us is really into super spicy so we skipped the jalapenos, but we had onion, lime, avocado, cheese & salsa for my daughter and hubby.  Folded everything into flour tortillas and I had supper cooked and ready to eat in about 30 minutes.  This is definitely going to become one of my "go to" recipes for busy weeknights!

Que rico!  We thought these were fabulous, especially because they are not overstuffed with everything but the kitchen sink.  I'm a vegetarian, so we used Morningstar Farms "Steak" Strips with great results.  Thanks, Lola!!

YUM - great tacos! I too was nervous about the peppers but they weren't hot at all and next time I'll get a hotter chile. I cooked them with the steak though so maybe that took out some of the bite...? Anyway, thanks to the other review regarding how long to cook the tortillas, these turned out perfectly. My husband thinks I should open my own restaurant! Even my kids liked these, well, 2 out of 4! They were easy and quick to make. We loved them!

Tried as written. One big flaw keeps it from being a 5. Do not fry the tortillas. Split into 2 batches of 9 or how ever many you need. Get a thin kitchen towel and put about an ounce of water on it and ring it out to spread throughout the towel. Wrap tortillas.  Microwave on high for 45 seconds. Leave in towel and put in a covered dish. Repeat with others. Use as needed from there. On a personal note I cannot stand cilantro!! I used a combination of flat leaf parsley and basil.

Delicious but I like to cut the beef and marinate in lime juice,black pepper and garlic before cooking. Also I prefer wrapping a stack of tortillas in a damp towel and zapping in microwave to frying them.

Straight from the Heart of Mexico, where simple ingredients come together to make great food.  While these may seem plain, it’s the lime juice that is key to the authentic flavor so be sure and give it a good squeeze.

Fun change to the normal American taco.  I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas though.  I honestly think I'd like these better on a flour tortilla.  I know that isn't "traditional"..it's just truth! 
I love the lime and spice together.  I think I'd like some fresh red and yellow peppers thrown in the mix too.

If my steak hadn't turned out super tough, this would have been a five-star recipe.  I think I would have preferred to grill the steak and then slice it up.  Otherwise the flavors were really good!

Very authentic! My husband and I had tacos like this from this man who sold real mexican food from his food truck. The first bite and we were hooked!  We now have named this guy "Taco Dude" and purchased his food at least twice a week. We have sinced moved and longed for those tacos. I think we have found the replica of "Taco Dude's" recipe! THANX!

These are quite yummy.  I also use left overs from pork roast.  Dice it up and heat in a hot skillet with 2 tablespoons of oil to brown up the edges of the already cooked meat.  I prefer my corn tortillas grilled without the oil.  Use a hot non-stick skillet and just lay the corn tortilla in it without oil or cooking oil spray.  Cook for a couple minutes until starting to brown, flip tortilla over to brown the other side.  "Cooks" the corn in the tortilla without adding oil to it.  Yummy!

I made these tonight and they were a hit with my family! I took another reviewer's advice and marinated the meat in lime juice, salt and pepper for about 15 minutes. I cooked the onion and a red bell pepper with the meat, since I didn't think my kids would eat raw veggies on tacos. Then we added the jalepeno and cilantro right before serving. I also used half corn and half flour tortillas since I didn't have enough corn tortillas. Both were good, though the corn was better. My kids and hubby were surprised that their tacos didn't need cheese, sour cream or any other regular taco fixings. I'll definitely make these again!

I marinated the steak in 1/2 bottle of dark beer, 1 lime, salt and 2 tsps of chopped garlic for 2 hrs.  I also put the tortillas in aluminum foil in the oven, instead of cooking in oil.  Used the rest of the recipe and it was awesome!!!!  The flavors were so fresh and no one could get enough.

Indeed, the other reviewers were right, this recipe had surprising flavor. The wife and I were skeptics in the beginning, thinking the lack of cumin, cayenne, and chili powder would make this bland. The lime, salt, pepper on the steak was the right combination. The jalapenos add just the kick it needed. We served with shredded chedderella, tobasco (for extra heat), and onion/tomato to balance out the heat. This one is a keeper.

These were YUMMY!!! I took the suggestion from another reviewer and marinated them in lime juice and house seasoning for about 20 minutes prior to cooking. Served them with Pico De Gallo and sour cream. I'll definitely be making these again!

These are AMAZING!  I'm not sure what authentic tacos taste like, but surely this must be it. I made these as-is with only the addition of fresh avocado slices. YUM!!!!!

This is the only way I will make tacos.  I do not bother frying the tortillas, just heat and flip them over the flame or in a dry skillet.

Fabulous dish!  My husband said this might have been my 'best dinner yet' - and if you look at how many recipes I've reviewed, that's saying a lot!  :)  Served with the Black Bean & Salsa soup  from this site and some cold Coronas!

These are my husband's favorite tacos.  Made again last night.  The corn tortillas are somewhat greasy after frying in skillet, even after laying on a paper towel.  Be sure to slice the steak VERY thin. We added a teaspoon or two of fajita seasoning to the meat, along with a couple teaspoons of cilantro and juice from 1/2 of a lime.

Delicious steak and tacos. Next time I will cover and simmer the meat to make it juicier. I was kind of hesitant about the pepper mix but it wasn't spicy at all.

This was a big winner. My "food snob" husband was very impressed with these tacos and he even bragged to our friends. They were so easy too.I used filet instead of sirlion and sauteed some of the onion.Then combined the chopped fresh jalapeno,chopped raw onion and cilantro like a relish. Will definately serve to guests at my next gathering.

Excellent recipe, although my steak was gone before the onion/cilantro/jalapeno mix was gone, so next time I would use a bit more meat.

We used chicken strips instead of sirloin.  It was still very good. We plan on trying the sirloin also.  Excellent! ... especially today on Cinco De Mayo.

I like this with some shredded cabbage instead of the raw onion and some crumbled cotija cheese sprinkled over. I think grilled onions would be good too (I can't eat them raw). I don't know if it remains Oaxacan style still when I do that, but it's good!

These were excellent! I did not use the jalepeno peppers and I added sour cream, cheese, and garlic lime salsa to the tacos. They had a great flavor, and it was easy to prepare. I plan on making these for company.

Outstanding!!  I was surprised how tender the meat was, I'd always thought sirloin was a tougher cut than this.  A few things I did differently:

I tossed the meat strips with a little canola oil, cumin and the salt and pepper and let it sit for about an hour.

After the meat was cooked (I kept mine a little pink inside) I took the meat out of the pan and put the chopped onions in there.  I sauteed them about 3 minutes which took the "edge" off and also coated them with the oil/meat juices.  The onions were still quite crunchy, and looked yummy.

Unfortunately my corn tortillas were a little too old, so I had to use flour tortillas.  Still delicious.  

This recipe is definitely a KEEPER, thanks for posting it!

These are so tasty!  They taste just like the ones we used to buy from a street vender.  They're so easy!  I use a lot less jalapeno and lots of cilantro and lime.  I made it one night and my hubby liked it so much he asked for it the next night, but the only beef we had in the house was ground, and it worked great with that.  Thanks!

This has become a regular in our house.  We really love it!  I usually let the meat marinate for a couple hours before cooking for added flavor.  Very quick & easy!

This was very good. Instead of onions I used pico de gallo that I found the recipe for here also. But I really liked it, is very authentic. Not really a dish for little ones though unless they like onions.

I loved these tacos.  I thought that I wouldn't and that they would be too hot.  But they were awesome.  I did fry the onion, jalapeno mix as well.

I cut the steak into small cubes instead of strips, sprinkled some Lawry's Seasoned Salt and then squeezed fresh lime juice to marinade.  Tends to give off liquid when cooking, so I cooked the meat until just cooked through, then drained it and returned it to the pan for a couple of minutes to brown, adding some more seasoned salt and ground pepper.  The combo of onions, jalepenos and cilantro was delicious, but it is also very good if you add lettuce and tomatoes to the mix.  Very tasty tacos!

I hate to go against the allrecipes grain but what can I say?  These were less than impressive.  If you change/add something to a recipe and that makes it fantastic, don't give it five stars because the actual recipe is in fact lacking.  These had an interesting taste; very clean and fresh, but my boyfriend didn't like them at all and even I have to say they were quite bland.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will not be making these again.

it was quite good...i did forget to add the salt and pepper and it still came out quite tasty! i didnt have vegetable oil so i used canola oil instead...while preparing the tacos i did find that 4 limes was a bit excessive...in fact i thought two was plenty...there was no spice at all since the jalapenos were seeded...if you want spice keep at least some of the seeds...if not you could substitute green peppers for the jalapenos...and just because we like them we added cheese, sour cream and salsa...

Deliciosoooo. I threw the peppers and onions in with the steak, just to make it easier to make the taco because we were feeling lazy, and we added some chopped avocado on top of the meat, before the lime juice. SO GOOD.

Made these but used the marinade from the Carne Asada tacos on this website and they were delicious.  Also, made the onion relish in advance instead of using all as garnishes - we only used 1 jalapeno in the relish.

Excellent! I did not fry the tortillas to cut down on fat. Seasoned my beef with with a little garlic, chili powder and cumin before sauteing.  We topped our tacos with some shredded cabbage and avocado salsa.

These taco's were fantastic.  Although I think I made them wrong.  I added a pinch of homemade taco seasoning to the steak, grilled it and made the cilantro, onion, jalepeno into a salsa with a ton of fresh lime and added a couple of roma tomatoes.  Topped with homemade guacamole!!  To Die For!!!

Excellent recipe, tasty tacos and so easy to make! I couldn't find fresh jalapenos so I got a jar of already chopped ones and worked well too!

Very delicious! The steak needs some seasoning however. And make sure the pan used is large enough.

This is amazing!  My boyfriend from Mexico City was amazed - these are almost exactly "street tacos."  Note:  if you are looking for American Tacos, these are not the tacos for you!
Thanks for a great recipe!

Even though I haven't made this recipe (bad to review without making, I know), I wanted to write and let everyone know that this is almost exactly what I used to eat while living in Brownsville, Texas -- the best were from the street vendors during the Cinco de Mayo parades.  One major difference is that the onions are cooked in lard or vegetable shortening.  Otherwise, one of my FAVORITE Mexican meals.  Highly recommend!  ... When making these at home, instead of slicing sirloin, we grill pre-marinated (with papain) beef fajitas from our grocers meat section.  YUM-O!

I was just in Mexican heaven! So simple yet so delicious! I was immediately transported back to the tiny taco stand we bought these for $1 from 12 years ago! Thank you so much.  Lime and cilantro are two of the best flavors this earth has to offer.  If I did anything different to the recipe next time, it would be to cut the meat smaller.

Great recipe!  I just wanted to add that if anybody gets jalepeno juice on themselves and it burns, dab a napkin in milk and hold that on the place where the juice got you, it really does help.  just keep changing it out when it gets warm.  the more milk, the better.

Really good.  My husband saw me preparing dinner and asked "are we having street tacos?" I put the meat in the freezer before slicing to get really thin strips.  I marinated the meat in lime juice and cilantro.  Good flavor.

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I followed it exactly as written.  Not nearly enough flavor, we even tried to add some things and they were still bland.  I don't really understand all the high ratings.  I was the only one in the family that actually ate it.  The rest of them threw it out.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic -- it will definitely change the way you think about tacos. Other than a little salt and pepper, I left the meat alone and used our broiler for the cooking. The fried shells, as always, are an absolute must! I'm not sure if I compromised the authenticity of these tacos, but I added some fresh avocado, queso fresco, and creme fraiche. Magnifico!

Frying the tortillas was kind of a pain but the result was worth it. I marinated the sirloin in a tequila lime marinade then cooked it on the grill. I can't wait to make these again.

I was afraid that these would be bland but I was wrong! My husband and I loved them - it was a perfect combination of fresh ingredients. Make sure to include the chopped jalapenos even if you don't like super-spicy dishes - I can't handle really spicy but the jalapenos really add to the flavor.

I thought these were going to be bland, but the combination of all of the flavors really works.  I did scale back the lime like others suggested, but found that it wasn't enough.  I also added sauteed peppers.  Excellent dish-very easy and quick.  Thanks!

Delicious! I used chicken in mine and also heated the cilantro,onion,and jalapenos together in the pan just a little before I put them on the tacos. They taste just like the tacos at our favorite taco stand in town. YUM!

My husband and I liked these tacos very much.  I changed up the recipe just a bit adding the onions, cilantro, jalapenos, and lime juice to the meat when it was almost halfway cooked.  Will likely make this again.

We have been making these for over a year now and this has become our staple taco recipe!  I use ground beef just as a preference, and everything else just as specified.  We make some homemade fried tortilla chips to go along when we have company, and everyone always raves!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

We liked this recipe.  Served with refried beans and spanish rice and of course added cheese.  Used the leftovers for breakfast tacos the next morning, just diced the steak and added eggs.

This was ok. I love cilantro, lime & jalapenos, but I this was just blah. The name of the recipe sounded like an authentic Mexican speciality but these are just dressed down fajitas. Glad I tried it, but I think I'll keep looking for authentic Mexican cuisine.

Very good.  I cooked the meat until pink was not visible on the surface of the meat, removed it from the skillet, then cooked the onion until it started to soften, added the meat, jalapenos, cilantro, s & p and stirred it around for 30 seconds.  Yummy.  We liked it with sour cream, not so Mexican but just what we like.

This recipe has all the ingredients of the carne asada I have been making for years, but not done as I was taught. 
With that said, I always marinate the meat, usually over night in Lemon juice , cilantro, salt, pepper to taste and of course at least one fire roasted jalapeno diced pepper. and garlic and a bit of cumin powder not seeds and be sparing as it can be over whelming. The long marinating will tenderize the meat. 
The fire roasting of peppers is very important as it enhances the chilies. I usually  do mine in the broiler or on a grill. The tough membrane on the chili will pop and turn dark when done. Be sure to wear gloves when handling chili as it can leave you burning. Peel the membrane , open the chili and remove seeds before dicing .
I always make this as a steak dinner so I am using the steak whole. Left overs are easily sliced thrown in a tortilla of choice with what ever makes you happy and voila! Carne asada tacos! Also unless I am frying my  tortillas to make them crispy, I do them in a dry pan! I use a non stick or well seasoned cast iron and heat it up. In seconds you should be able to spin the tortilla and then turn it over  let it warm until it spins again. I stack mine on a clean dish towel so that I can cover as I go. If  the towel is on a pie pan it helps hold heat. Do several fix the tacos and repeat. This method is perfect for either corn or flour.
Thanks Lola for reminding me of a well loved recipe!

This was a total home run.  We didn't fry the tortillas but brushed them with EVOO and put them on a frying pan.  This will be repeated for sure!

I loved the simplicity of this. I was skeptical at first, given that you don't marinate or cook the meat in any spices.  The flavor combinations were amazing and very authentic!  We added avocado, and for the low-carb eaters, we used lettuce wraps instead of tortillas.  This is now one of our family's stand-by recipes, and great for week nights in the heat of the summer!

Delicious!!!  Nice change from Americanized tacos.  The only change I made was to marinate the strips in lime and minced garlic for 20 minutes.  Even my picky hubby said they tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe Lola!

Really good. We don't fry our tortillas becuase we don't want to eat grease. We simply plug in our skillet and warm them until maleable. Also, try Mrs. Renfro's salsa with jalapenos in it (green). Then it will be a truly Oaxacan taco.

I give this a 5 star rating because it is close to perfection the way the recipe is listed. I do marinate the steak with the lime and put the onions on top and give them some lime so they have some flavor. I use a little less than a pound of steak for my boyfriend and I and it makes about 5 tacos. Only needed 1 jalepeno for two rounds of taco making. Just add a much oil as you need for each taco shell. Yummy!!

These are my new favorite mexican food. I got a recipe very similar to this from my sister, who got it from her Mexican neighbors. I cut the steak into little cubes and brown it with season salt, lime and granulated garlic. I serve it on the softened tortillas with diced sweet onion, cilantro, shredded cabbage and a squeeze of lime. My 11 year old son can't get enough of them. He ate 6 of them. I will be making a huge batch for a family get together with mexican rice and black beans. Yummy!

These are truly delicioso! I am blessed to have a grocery store that makes fresh corn tortillas everyday, so it really added to the authenticity of them. My husband's favorite way to heat the tortillas is to omit the pan (and the oil) and place the tortilla directly on the burner. (If you do this be careful to have a low flame and use a tongs to turn the tortilla).My husband and I eat them exactly as stated in the recipe, but for the kids I make a ‘taco bar’ and have shredded lettuce, sour cream, tomato, and cheese for them to add.  Everyone leaves the table with happy and full tummies!

It doesn't get much better than this! My husband is not a huge fan of Mexican food and doesn't care for cilantro at all. I happen to like both.. so I made these despite knowing he might not be overly thrilled. To my surprise he really... really enjoyed these. He loved the purity of the recipe. I think you have to have an adequate amount of the jalapeno, cilantro and lime to pull out that very distinct authentic flavor. It will be difficult if not altogether impossible to go back to our "usual" kind of taco after tasting these. MMMMmmm

Great tacos!  I wasn't sure they would have enough favor with the limited seasoning, but I made them as stated in the recipe and they were excellent.  Very fresh tasting, light, very nice.  I did blot the tortillas after I fried them to remove any excess oil.  I also sprayed a couple with Pam and then fried them to cut down on calories -- not too bad.  The amazing thing -- all three kids and my husband loved them!  Nice job!

Excellent and Easy! Very refreshing blend of flavors. I followed several of the review suggestions  1)Added a little dry fajita seasoning to steak, will add again. 2) Also liked mixing the onions, jalapeños, cilantro and a little lime into a relish.  Then added extra lime when assembled. 3) Heated the corn tortillas in foil in a 350º oven for 10 mins to lower the calories. Tasted fine, but tortillas fell apart.

Wonderful!  I added garlic as I was cooking the meat, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  A great recipe to use the cilantro, garlic, onions and jalapenos from our garden. :)

Okay - I ate them just as stated - although I used canned "tamed" jalapenos - and I just cut up one slice per taco - but it was amazing that I couldn't even tell it was in there!!  I tasted them before putting them in and they did seem a little hot, but not when in the taco.  For my boys (very picky boys, I might add), I forgot the cilantro and lime, and took out the onions for my pickiest eater, and added sour cream and cheese.  They were begging for more - even just the cooked sirloin.  It was great that I could so easily adjust for each one of us in the family.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this would be a refreshing change, but it was only o.k.  I marinated the meat in lime and cilantro, grilled some, pan fried some. Neither was worth trying again.

This is my favorite Tacos! I add sliced avocados to my topping. And one more thing, don't use oil to warm the tortillas.

Made this last night, the only thing I added was to also serve fresh avocado.  Family really enjoyed them.  I put out sour cream and cheese, but nobody used it.  All the fresh ingredients really make the dish.  Simple, fresh and easy to make.

As a huge fan of authentic Mexican food, this recipe is excellent! Very simple and flavorful!
I marinated the steak in lime juice and pepper for an hour before frying- delicious.
Remember, don't use flour tortillas... It's all in the corn!
Muchos Gracias.

SO simple, yet SO good! After making these yummy authentic tacos, I realized I had been over-complicating them the whole time! I've been adding way to much ingredients to what should be a simple dish. Thank you for simplifying and making the taste better!  My husband and I both loved them and are planning a dinner party in a couple weeks to serve the Oaxacan tacos!

I really liked these "authentic" tacos.  It was quite a change from the regular taco.  Instead of creme fraiche, I used sour cream thinned out with a little bit of milk and topped these tacos with it.  Wonderful

This recipe was amazing. It was so easy and so good. My husband said it tasted just like something from a small taqueria. My kids really liked it too..I just left the jalapeno's out of their.  I followed the recipe to a tee...and will definitely make this one again.

My husband made these and we liked them very much. I would give them 4 stars, but he says 3. The amount of lime called for seemed excessive. He says next time he would use skirt steak and cook it on the grill, slicing it after it was cooked. I'm sure I'll be seeing this on my table again later in the summer.

O SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!I have never ate or cooked steak tacos before but theses were great.I was afraid the steak would be too chewy or tuff,but it wasnt.I followed the recipe exact.I put the onion,cilantro,peppers,and lime wedges in individual bowls so everyone could put what they wanted on their tacos.I also diced some avacado to add.It was wonderfull,everyone loved them.the lime gave it a nice flavor.YUMMY!The only problem I had was I wasnt sure how much to fry the tostada shells I got a few too crisp and they broke when we tried to fold them,but the ones that I cooked right were very good.Be carefull not fry them too long.Will make AGAIN,and AGAIN!Thanks for sharing the recipe.:)

I tweaked this by adding cumin, cayanne pepper, paprika and some chili powder only because as I was cooking it the meat looked a bit bland.  I used flour tortillas instead and cooked the onion with the meat so my hubby wouldn't have onion breath - these were wonderful!  I was only able to eat one since my DH ate all the rest (only 1lb of meat, not 2).  Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

This dish is easy & delicious.  We add fresh tomatoes.  Don't skip the jalapenos, either.  If you take out the seeds, fresh jalapenos are NOT hot - just tangy!

Fantastic.  I made following the instructions except, like another reviewer, I marinated the diced sirloin tip (lime juice, onion, part of the jalapeños, cilantro and a little garlic) for about a 1/2 hour before cooking, used a tiny bit of olive oil to warm the corn tortillas, and topped with pico de Gallo and a slice of avocado.  Hands down the best street tacos I've had.

I will make these again.  My husband and I thought they were great.  I like my food highly seasoned so I added a pinch (literally) of cayenne, a teaspoon of Penzey's Chili 3000, and about a tablespoon of adobo seasoning.  Next time I'll add more of each. I used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil for the tortillas in the skillet.  I assembled the tacos as pictured.  Delicious.

This is so good. Made it 4 times now. A unique taco with great flavor. Great tortilla. 

We serve it with black beans and some fruit like watermelon.

Highly recommend.

This is so simple, and so good. I made no changes to the recipe, and don't think I will when I make it again. I did slice the beef razor thin, and cook it over a fairly high heat until I got those nice crispy bits. The picture shows sliced avocado and sliced red onion, not in the recipe but I think next time I might try it that way.  Yumm.

This was great! I didn't need 2 pounds because I was only serving myself and kids. I did marinate the meat in the juice of a lime and salt and pepper  while I chopped and prepared my side dish. This recipe is very adjustable - I added a little chopped garlic with the onion and sautéd it a little, then added the meat. Tons of cilantro on top! Kids devoured it ! Easy after work recipe! Thank you!

Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I wasn't expecting to love it so much with the ingredients being so simple, but these really are good. I did make a few minor adjustments. I can't justify paying that much for meat, so I bought a 2 lb beef roast, sliced it into steaks, and then into thin strips. I then put it into a ziploc with the juice of one lime for about 20 minutes before cooking. Once I got it onto the skillet, I added onion powder, garlic salt, and black pepper. Loved the fried corn tortillas. I grew up with eating tacos that way and I still think it's the best. For toppings, I put out cilantro, the Guacamole from this site, lime wedges, fresh medium salsa, black olives, and sour cream for the kids. I loved that the meat was flavorful, but not spicy, so that we could each adjust the tacos to our own liking with the different toppings. Thank you again. This one's a keeper.

My first love is Mexican food and this recipe was wonderful. The only issue was that the photos clearly show sliced avocado but it's not shown anywhere in the recipe. I added it anyways though because I can't imagine a Mexican meal with avocado/guacamole.

Bland as written. The meat definitely needs some taco seasoning or a home made to your own taste seasoning blend like I keep on hand and don't fry the corn tortilla. I think frying the corn tortilla changes the flavor of the masa base used to make corn tortillas. I either heat them directly on the flame or wrap them in a damp dish towel and microwave them for 30 to 45 seconds to heat and soften them. Spiced up and seasoned right makes them a 5 star taco.

Reading reviews that people don't like the oil on a corn tortilla. Just dip the tortilla in water and fry both sides till turning color. Wrap in a towel and store in 200 degree oven if serving a crowd. No oil at all. Tastes great.  This recipe rocks! Simple and good. Just like my favorite authentic taco stand tacos. Just add a squeeze of lime.

I will be making these, for now I eat the same thing twice a week at a little tortillaria near our house. I agree they are the best ever. They don't fry the shell . They make their own and just warm them slightly.

I added some garlic powder and pepper to the meat before I cooked it but that was the only addition I made.  I also left out the jalapeno because I didn't have any and they were still delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This really is delicious. I was afraid after I started making it that the flavor might be a little dull, but not at all. For the onion, jalapenos, and cilantro -- I tossed them together in the food processor and made a really nice looking topping. I also added some sour cream and black bean/corn salsa. DELICIOUS!!!

These were really simple and really good.  I cut the recipe down significantly, though, since I was only cooking for two of us.  My husband loved it, he was shocked to see me cutting up fresh jalepenos.  He LOVES jalepenos, but I have never bought them fresh and used them in a dish before since I'm not a huge fan.  But it was great, because I was able to just sprinkle a few on mine and a bunch on his!

Very similar to the tacos we had in Cabo, right off the street vendors.  Didn't use the jalapenos, but they were still very authentic.

I THOUGHT THESE WERE GOOD, BUT I CHANGED THEM A BIT. I DONT LIKE CILANTRO SO I MARINATED THE STEAK IN ITALIAN DRESSING FOR ABOUT FOUR HOURS. I DID NOT HAVE FRESH JALAPENOS SO I USED JARRED. ADDED A BIT OF SOUR CREAM, SALSA AND LETTUCE TO THE TACOS. I USED TOP SIRLOIN STEAK WHICH IS A BIT PRICEY BUT OVERALL THIS IS A RECIPE I WILL MAKE ONCE IN AWHILE.
