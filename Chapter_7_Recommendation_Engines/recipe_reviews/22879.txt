This is a very tasty fudge, however the directions need some help.  To get this fudge to set: after you've added the gelatin , stir to blend. Reduce heat to a bubbling simmer.  Do not stir again.  Simmer until it reaches a soft ball stage (238Â°), this will take several minutes. (Trust me,I know your thinking it will burn but it won't, this is the way fudge was cooked before marshmallow creme). Remove from heat and continue with the recipe except beat until smooth before adding cherries (quartered not halved).

I tried to submit my own recipe for Cherry Blossom Fudge two years ago with out success; guess I'll just rate this one.  This is great fudge but this recipe is way off for butter.  I use only 1T of butter and I also add 3T of the cherry juice when adding the choc. chips and CHOPPED cherries.  Be sure the cherries are well drained. Boil for 5 minutes instead of four.  You'll get great fudge with these notes.

I couldn't get this fudge to "set" properly.  I tried it 3 times and all I got was goo.  However, that goo tasted mighty good to me.  I am not giving up completely with this recipe.  It had an awesome flavor even though it didn't set. I will try again before the holidays to see if I can get it to set then.

The recipe as is is alright ... I liked the ingredients but added to them from my knowledge of fudge making.  I added another cup of sugar halved the butter and added cherry extract oil to enrich the flavor.  The maraschino cherries are delicious ... better than using candied cherries I think.  I also added a cup of marshmallows for color and texture.  I love chocolate and cherry together.  YUM!

I think the non-setting problem most often mentioned by other reviewers, is due to the huge amount of butter listed in ingredients.  If you want to make cherry fudge, I suggest you use: Hershey's Rich Cocoa Fudge - this site and add quartered maraschino cherries.

It is a quick and easy recipe... BUT don't expect it to hold up outside of the fridge. It melted at room temperature and was a complete mess to cut. Delicious? Yes!!! but very messy!!

This tasted good, but I have to concur with the other reviewers who had problems with it not setting.  This recipe didn't work for me.

Ok so the first batch I made turned out really bad.... therefore the 4 stars. But after reading the other reviews and making a few tweaks my second batch turned out perfect! First and foremost you have to reduce the amount of butter! 1 cup is entirely tooooo much, I reduced it to just 2 tablespoons. Next after adding the jello reduce to medium heat (it will continue boiling) and do not stir!(I promise it will not burn) and then Boil for 5 minutes instead of 4. The cherries I quartered and then pat dryed with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Follow the recipe for everything else and you will have a perfect very rich fudge.

I tried to make this & it did not turn our very good at all. It would stick to the pan & I felt could have been much better. Sorry but I was very disappointed.

Although I got this fudge to set correctly by boiling 5 minutes, the cherry flavor overwhelmed the chocolate. Much too sweet.

Followed the directions exactly and it came out terrible.  It was not the consistency of fudge at all, it was softer and gooier.  Would not make again-couldn't even serve it.

This fudge needed to be less cherry (although I LOVE cherry and thought the cherries inside were brilliant) and more chocolate.  I suggest adjusting to you own taste before commiting.

This fudge set up fine for me. However be sure that once you stir in the gelatin you don't stir again until after it is done boiling. Also I boiled it for 5 minutes not 4. The texture of the fudge was great, but the cherry flavor and sweetness was overpowering.

Very good.  Time consuming but worth the wait.  I followed the advice on using the candy thermometer and not stirring.  The texture was perfect!

I cooked the jello mixture longer as another reader suggested and the fudge set perfectly!   Next time I will make it a little sweeter to my taste.

This is a great recipe  but just as a variation you can use regular knox gelatin and chopped nuts and have a yummy creamy rich chocolate fudge that everyone will love. (at least my family does) just follow the same directions otherwise...then eat.

This turned out much better than I thought it would. I made it because my mom loves cherry cordial candies. I was very pleased. It is a little sticky. My husband liked it too. It wasn't "too sweet" as he complains that most fudge is.

I made the recipe has written. OMGAWD is this fudge good. I was worried about it not setting as other have stated so I did what WVLUPIE suggested heat to soft boil stage. It set up perfectly.  Cant wait to bring out all my goodies I have made for Christmas this year.

Tastes great but oily and grainy. I think there is too much butter for sure. I should have patted the cherries dry. Not going to try this again.
