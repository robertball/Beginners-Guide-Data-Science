I used my own homemade irish cream in this recipe and whipped cream vodka. I made no other changes. VERY sweet but unbelievably delicious........and POTENT. Next time I make this, I may try to cut the sweetness a bit and use regular plain vodka.

This was very sweet but wasn't very reminiscent of gingerbread. I think I would be more inclined to serve it on the rocks or in coffee to cut the sweetness a bit. Thanks so much for sharing.

If I make this again, use less cinnamon.
