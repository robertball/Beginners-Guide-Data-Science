I oven fried my wings (seasoned them with season salt, garlic and pepper) and floured them.  I didnt use the egg, instead after I floured them I sprayed them with pam.  They came out nice and crispy, I baked them at 400.  After they were "fried" in the oven, I added the sauce and it was perfect. Great recipe and I was glad that I was able to make them healthier by oven frying them. I will definitely make them again.

These are soooo good! I had a chicken wing night in which I prepared these, the Restaurant-Style Buffalo Chicken Wings, and the Honey Lime Chicken Wings. They all were great, but these Japanese Chicken Wings were our favorite. So sweet, so flavorful, so crispy, so moist! One word of caution... line your roasting/baking pan with sturdy aluminum foil. The sugar/vinegar sauce gets very gooey near the end of the baking portion of the recipe and can be tough to clean up.

I did not fry my wings. I baked the wings with a  
little seasoning salt on both sides for about 30 to 45 minutes. Then I poured the sauce on them and baked them for an add'l 30 to 45 minutes. Make sure you baste the wings w/the sauce during baking. They were EXCELLENT!! Thanks, Tracy.

I definitely suggest making this recipe without the egg, flour or frying.  I don't like to fry food unless it is really necessary to improve the taste and in this case it isn't necessary and in my opinnion does not inprove taste.  To make my chicken I used wings, cut them up and put them in a bowl.  I then poured about 1-2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil on them and made sure all the wings had a light coating of oil.  I then placed the wigs on a broiler pan and put them in the oven (set to broil) until the wings were brown on one side and then I browned the other side.  This is much faster than frying, uses much less oil and is much healthier.  I then put the wings in a baking dish with the sauce mixture from the recipe (I only used half a cup of sugar) and cooked them in the oven like the recipe says.  This way tasted much better than frying (in my opinion). But also, this way, the wings are less crispy.  If you want crispy wings you better fry them.

WOW this recipe is awesome. I first tried it about 3 months ago and have been making it all the time since then. I did tweak it a little though-i placed the wings in a pan and sprinkled them generously with garlic powder and paprika-then sprayed them with pam. I baked them at 375 for 35 min-then i flipped them respiced them and baked them for another 25 min. After that i poured on the sauce and baked them another 20-25 min. I find this recipe very quick and easy and it is always a hit with my guests. You wont regret trying this recipe!!

Awesome!  I used only 1/2 of the sugar recipe calls for and used half white vinegar and half seasoned rice vinegar found in Asian markets.  I tried 3 different cooking variations: 1)followed the recipe's cooking method using butter to fry in before putting it in the oven. This was good, but I felt the butter overpowered the goodness of the sauce -btw, I LOVE butter, but frying the wings in butter was a step you can definitely omit and save the calories on. 2) I followed reviewers suggestions and oven-fried. I coated with egg & flour and baked @ 400 for 25 min turning once then added sauce and baked additional 30 min @ 350.  This was by far the best. The skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was fabulous. 3) I coated with egg and panko flakes, baked @400 for 25 turning once, added sauce, baked addition 30 @350. This was also good and my second favorite. the panko really soaks up the sauce and gives the wing a more sweet-sticky coat then a crispy-sticky. so it depends on your taste.  For all 3 variations, once the sauce was added (lined baking sheet with foil for easier cleanup), I turned the wings a few times and then removed the wings from the sauce and placed on fresh foil over baking sheet for the last 5 min.Can't wait to make it again! I forgot to add the sesame seeds like the pictures show and really wish I didn't. I'm sure the sesame seeds are a perfect touch..

Sorry to have to give this one a negative rating. While the finished product looked and smelled wonderful and was relatively easy to prepare, the taste was overpoweringly sweet. I should have known better, but given the high ratings, thought that all these reviewers can't be wrong. Some mentioned adding cayenne pepper to "balance the sweetness" but in retrospect, I'm rather inclined believe that there's something a little wrong with a chicken dish that has as much sugar in it as an average dessert. Perhaps I'd use it again as an appetizer where you'd only eat one or two, but as a main dish for already sugar-addicted kids I'd vote no.

These were FABULOUS!!!!! i did try something different though when i made this in order to at least try and cut some of the fat. Instead of frying the wings i simply washed them, patted them dry, seasoned and put them under the broiler.  I turned them over and over again and they end up very crispy.  I then drained the fat and followed by adding the sauce. With the added corn starch, the sauce ends up very thick and rich  Served it with coconut rice and grilled veggies. Amazing!

I give this recipe a B+. It tasted great, but required some tweaks. Here are a few tips to make excellent Japanese Chicken Wings, with less fat and MORE taste:
1. Do not fry. Waste of calories. Instead, broil on high in oven. Each side approx 4-5 minutes. Ensure you flip sides so all of wing is alittle crispy.
2. Once broiling is complete, remove wings from oven. Turn off broil function. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
3. Line a sheet pan twice with foil. For recipes contents, forget about part with butter because we did not fry. Instead focus on sauce part. Do not use 1 cup of sugar. Use approx 1/3 of a cup. Use rice wine vinegar instead of white. For vinegar, use about 1/3 cup as well. Use about 6 TB of soya sauce or for taste you prefer. Slight sprinkle of chile peppers or hot sauce. Coat broiled wings in this mix well.
4. Once coated, please on cooking sheet and place in oven. Will cook for about 30 minutes. While wings cooking in oven, place leftover sauce in saucepan. Bring to a boil to use as a glaze. To thicken sauce, add cornstarch (to ensure no lumps in this sauce/gravy- add approx 1 TB of cornstarch to about 3TB of water, mix well and then add to saucepan to thicken sauce).
5. After approx 30 mins or until wings are cooked, remove from oven and coat them in the thickened sauce.
6. Service with white Nishiki rice or simply some veg. VERY delicious and enjoy!! :-)

Loved it! I changed a lot (like using cut up bone/skinless breasts instead of wings) and lightly frying in very little olive oil. Once breasts were cooked I added the rest of the mixture to the skillet and simmered for about 30 minutes. The longer you simmer the thicker the sauce gets. We served this on lettuce for a chicken salad. The sauce was so good, as a dressing, that my husband wants this to be in the weekly rotation of recipes! Thanks!

I made these wings for my boyfriend and his best friend last night and they were a hit!  I made double the sauce and set half of it aside, then later heated it to a rolling boil on the stove in a sauce pan until the sauce thickened to a syrup consistency.  I also took the chicken wings out of the sauce they were cooking in and placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven for about 15 mins. to crisp them up a little bit.  We then ate the wings using the thickened sauce as a dip.  It was great!  I will try marinating next time I make them.

These were SO good. I followed the recipe exactly, and yes, I used the butter, and yes, I used the full cup of sugar. It's not like a person is going to eat this every day (although I wouldn't mind!). I wish people would lighten up! At any rate, it was wonderful. I entered a photo, and I'm terribly embarrassed about using frozen mixed veggies as an accompaniment. My husband said the wings were so good, the veggies didn't work! He was right. Thank you for posting this many years ago!

These wings were AMAZING, I adlibed a couple things to make them way better (in my opinion).

Changes to the sauce:

Used white wine vinagar instead of white vinagar. 
Used brown sugar instead of white sugar.
Added a touch of hoisen sauce. 
Added red pepper flakes. 
Added toasted sesame seeds. 
Added minced garlic AND garlic powder. 

Cooking method changes:

Instead of using egg and flour and frying in butter, I did what others suggested and coated them in olive oil, salt and pepper and then "oven fried" them for about 15 min  @ 500 in the oven turning 2 twice. Then added the sauce and baked them uncovered for 20 min @ 350, turning evenly. Then I put them in the broiler for about 3-5 mins per side or until crispy and sticky... drizzle with the reduced sauce and enjoy!

So delicious! This recipe is really pretty easy and so flexible.  I have made the wings twice.  The first time I made them exactly as written and got such rave reviews I wasn't sure whether to try it any other way.  Thought I would give oven frying a shot to save calories and they were just as good - maybe better!  I coated them with seasoned flour (no egg, just flour, cayanne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and salt), sprayed with olive oil, and bake 35-40 mins at 400, flipping them halfway, turn up the heat if you want them crispy).  Then I made twice the sauce and added about a teaspoon of cornstarch to help with thickening.  I threw the wings and all the sauce into a shallow baking dish and back into the oven for another 35 mins or so, turning occasionally.  So so good!  They became even stickier than the fried version and had less of a breaded texture - fantastic!  Guests loved them and they went faster than the always adored Restaurant-Style Buffalo Wings from this site!  The sauce is also delicious on chicken breasts and rice!

I still don't know why it's called"Japanese" but I simply love this recipe. It was a big hit for our holiday party. I reduced the sugar to be half but it's still too sweet for my taspte. I will cut the sugar to be 1/3 the next time.

We  looooooooove these chicken wings.  But we did make some changes.  We used less sugar(half), rice vinigar instead of white(cause that  is what we had,and two or three times the garlic, ovened fried the chicken(as suggested by another review), thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch,and remove them from the sauce and bake them on a rake for the last 15 minutes.  There sticky and yummy!!!!!!  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!

This is a keeper. I used boneless and skinless thighs instead of wings, and I fried in vegetable oil instead of butter. I also cut the sugar in half on the recommendation of other reviewers (plus I simply ran out of sugar!). I served over white rice. Will definately make again.

This recipe was renamed the Superbowl wings and have replaced the Buffalo wings on our buffet.  I am rating the origanal recipe because it is absolutely fabulous the way it is. That being said, here are some tweaks that go with my nature that my family loved also.  I add one clove finely chopped garlic, 1/8-1/4 hot pepper flakes, and some grated ginger to the glazing sauce.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, for submitting this recipe.

This was a great recipe. I like it with cubed chicken breast. Also its a good idea to add corn starch at about 20min and then let cook for another 15min. This will make them nice and sticky but not too done.

Deeeeeelish. Very simple and very tasty.  I recomend that you make more than the recipie, if you want left overs.  Great as a party dish, especially for the holidays.  With my leftoers, took the meat off the bones and made sandwiches with keiser rolls, sliced cheddar and a bit of garlic mayo (mmmmmmmmmmMMM). Another hint is you can take the 'sauce' and use it for other meats.  I have put in on chicken breasts and grilled it, basting it with the sauce. You can also do this with duck, pork or beef.

I did the healthier version, and they were great!!
1. Broil wings on high in oven.  Broil 4-5 minutes. Flip wings, 4-5 minutes more, so all of wing is a little crispy. 
2. Remove wings from oven. Turn off broil function. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 
3. Line a sheet pan with foil and spray w/ oil. Mix sauce ingredients in mixing bowl. Coat broiled wings w/ mixture. 
4. Once coated, place on cooking sheet and place in oven. Cook for about 30 minutes. While wings cooking in oven, place leftover sauce in saucepan. Bring to a boil to use as a glaze. 
To thicken sauce, add cornstarch (to ensure no lumps, add approx 1 TB of cornstarch to about 3TB of water, mix well and then add cornstarch to saucepan). 
5. After approx 30 mins or until wings are cooked, remove from oven and coat them in the thickened sauce. ...then I stuck them back in the oven for 5 more min just to carmelize the sauce onto the wings.

I made some changes to the recipe to accomodate out diet and to make a bit spicier and it was very excellent! Used splenda instead of white sugar, mixed in some balsamic vinegar to help carmelize and added a little chili paste for spice. Also didn't bread the chicken before frying and it still turned out crispy and delicious!

I just made these two nights in a row. I took frozen chicken wings and sprinkled seasoning salt and garlic powder and then sprayed each side with PAM flour and butter cooking spray. Baked in a 385 degree oven for about 35 minutes, flipped them over and baked for another 30 minutes and then poured the sauce (which I thickened on the stove first) over the wings and cooked for another 25 minutes or so.....Got nice and sticky. Also added a little toasted sesame seeds to the sauce.

I am vegan so I did not eat any but my family LOVED them! The sauce is so sweet and good. It does come out a little thin so if you are looking for a really sticky gooey sauce I would add two teaspoons of cornstarch to a little water and then mix the whole mixture in in the last 15 minutes of baking. The sauce came out soooo sticky-sweet this way. I also added a little ground ginger and salt to the flour mixture and a little gound red pepper to the sauce. The result: YUMMY! Try try try! My husband ate 3/4 of the pan himself!

Tracy, thank you for this fabulous recipe!  I deep fried our wings (about 12 mins).   Once they were done, I tossed them with the prepared sauce in a large bowl and poured them onto a foil-lined (and Pam sprayed) jelly roll pan and baked for about 20 mins, basting a few times.  I sprinkled with some toasted sesame seeds during the last few mins. of baking.  I used Splenda for the sauce and it worked perfectly.  One note with the Splenda -- I started with half a cup, based on reviews saying a full cup of sugar was a little too sweet.  It tasted great at that point.  I heated it through, though, before tossing with the wings, and it lost some of its sweetness.  Not sure if that's the Splenda or the heating process, but I did end up adding the other half cup of Splenda to get the sweetness back up.  I made a second batch of sauce to serve for dipping (just thickened by adding a little cornstarch/water mix and microwaving for a few mins).  The wings were SO scrumptious -- and they were even better reheated the next evening.  The technique and flavor are so wonderful...please try this one, folks -- you won't be disappointed (especially if you like the TGIFriday's chicken with JD Dipping Sauce!). Thank you again...we LOVE this recipe! :)

I've modified this recipe a bit, since I'm not much good at frying (although I do love fried food).  I saute an onion with some garlic until they're nice and brown, then add some chicken legs to the pan.  I cook the legs just until theyre starting to brown, then add a little liquid (chicken stock usually, though water works in a pinch), cover, and cook on about medium heat until the legs are nearly done.  Then I uncover the pan, add the sauce ingredients (leaving out the garlic, since there's already some in the pan, and cutting back on the sugar), and simmer until the sauce thickens and the legs are done (only a few minutes).  Stir in some garlic-chili sauce for heat (or add red pepper flakes when you add sauce ingredients), and serve over some good rice (I like basmati, but use whatever you have around).  A little green onion and cilantro on top helps too.  Easy and delicious, and less of an ordeal than frying.  Definitely a good base to play around with though.

These were so-so. Not great, but not bad. The flavor was interesting and different, if a little too sweet, but my boyfriend just thought these wings were "okay". Didn't really think the end result was worth using my ingredients, so I probably won't be making these too often. Sorry.

This recipe was delicious!! I was almost ready to toss the whole batch while it was cooking because of the overwhelmingly powerful smell of vinegar...But I made my guinea pig (hubby) try them first.  I was shocked when he liked them. My super picky son gobbled half a dozen... he HATES meat of any kind!!  I loved them myself. Don't let the powerful vinegar smell freak out you when it cooks!!!

These wings kick butt and will impress everyone!  The sugar that's called for is necessary to create a sticky, carmelized sauce. These are sweet, but I have 2 suggestions to counter that sweetness so it's not too much. First, I put some chile sesame oil in with the butter to add a little heat to it. Fresh chiles would probably work well in the sauce, too. Second, serve these with Japanese sticky rice.  Use a short grain rice or use jasmine or basmati. The sticky rice is bland enough to contrast nicely with the yummy sauce, which is wonderfully gooey and flavorful. Make sure you baste these. About half-way through you can start basting with the juices that are falling off the wings and carmelizing. I used fresh garlic and mixed in a little pineapple juice into the sauce instead of water and I added chopped green onion--also a nice garnish. I think this method would work great on chicken breasts, as well, since there is more meat on them to absorb the sweet sauce. I've never made wings before and I'm just so pleased with these. They were so easy. One last thing--wash that pan right away or you'll be sorry later.

If you aren't sure about making these, cut the recipe in half to just try it, which is what I did. Now I can't wait to serve these at a party. Thanks for this gem!

5 stars for the sauce!  but omitted the deep fry, butter, egg, flour.  Instead, I coated it with EVOO, S&P, and then baked it at 500 for 20 minutes (flipped in between).  Then added the sauce (with an added tbsp of cornstarch), turned down the heat to 350 and baked for another 30 minutes.  Finished by reducing the sauce in a pan and broiling the meat for a bit of crisp.

Wow. Just wow. I can't get over how delicious these chicken wings were! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. My husband said that it was one of the best things I ever made and to make it again... and again. 

I'd pick this recipe over Wing Stop anyday.

My husband went crazy for this recipe!  I'm a vegetarian so I have no idea how they tasted.
He had left overs the next day and said they were awesome even as left overs...I guess chicken wings can get soggy, but these did not.

Amazing! These had so much flavor and my very picky boyfriend liked them so much he started eating right out of the pan after these came out of the oven! I didn't have wings on hand, so I used six whole drumsticks instead. First, I seasoned them lightly with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. I probably didn't need the full cup of flour to coat, either. Fried them in the butter three at a time, about eight minutes per batch. Put them in the oven and baked for 45 minutes, basting at minutes 15 and 30. The vinegar was overpowering when opening the oven, BUT the meat was oh-so-juicy and tender. Will definitely be making again sometime.

the sauce tasted good, very similar to Teriyaki sauce. I followed other reviewers suggestion to bake the wings instead of frying. But I think that the time they recommended was WAY too long. My wings turned out dried. I would only bake it for 35 mins at 375 and then baste sauce and bake for another 25 mins.

Will definitely make again and again!! As recommended, I baked the wings in a foil-lined baking pan, coating them with seasoned salt, pepper, and flour (didn't use eggs), and then spraying them and the pan with Pam cooking spray. While they were baking (approx 30 min at 400 degrees), I made the  sauce - adding 2 tsp each: toasted sesame seeds, roasted red pepper flakes (we like spicy), and cornstarch to thicken it up. I basted it every ten minutes - cooking them about 25 min in total with sauce on. Excellent! We used fresh wings from the local farmer's market - best wings we've ever made - better than in some restaurants!! Enjoy!

I made these last night for my husband and I - and the end result was really good.  I breaded my chicken wings per the recipe and deep fried them. Once they were done cooking in the oil, I transferred them to a foil-lined baking dish and poured the sauce over and baked, basting every 10 minutes. For the sauce, I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used 1/2 cup sugar and about 2-3 Tbsp of honey. The end result was tasty, not too sweet chicken wings.

The sauce had a great flavor.  I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also baked the wings instead of frying but they seemed to dry out.  Not sure why as the wings were in the sauce completely, but they just didn't stay moist.

AWESOME reciepe.  I did add some cayenne pepper to give it a litle more heat and did double the sauce because we LOVE extra sauce.  Didn't fry on stove, only baked in oven so no need for the butter at all.  DELISH!  Will make again.  Probably will use this sauce on chicken breasts as well.  Thanks for the great reciepe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! However... I did cut out the butter and didn't fry them. I oven fried them, I did the egg wash (I found I needed 2 eggs) and the flour bath and broiled them at 500 until crispy on all sides. As for the sauce. When I made it, I cut half of the sugar out. I also made 2 batches, both of which I boiled a bit to make thicker. The thinner one I used when I put the wings in the oven at 350. The second batch I boiled down until it was nice and syrupy, it made a great dipping sauce! I would've given this more stars but it was SO sweet, even with half the sugar! Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of sugar. I really don't think they need to be fried either, cut out the butter and save yourself the calories! Oven fry instead!

I use to make these in a restuarant I worked at. But we called them Chinese Wings and they were always a hit on Wing Night. We would soak the wings in the sauce for a few hours and then deep fry. Awesome this way too!!!

Awesome wings. I made them for football game for husband and friends everyone loved them. I deep fried them instead of frying them in butter and they came out great.

Terrific! I tweaked a lil (mostly b/c I'm lazy).  The only change I made to the sauce was to use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I made a half batch (just 2 of us) but wish I'd made a full batch.  I fried in oil (as I was already going to fry a few other items) and I didn't dredge in egg and flour.  I just fried them plain in the oil for about 10 minutes to get them partially cooked and the skin starting to crisp.  Then placed them in a baking pan (lined with foil) and poured the sauce over them.  I moved them around and flipped them a couple times, spooning the sauce over them.  At first the sauce seems watery but at about the 45 minute mark it got all sticky and bubbly.  I cannot wait to make these again.

Well, i gotta tell you, I was soo disappointed with the results of this.  I even followed the suggestions. I halved the sugar, and it just gave it an overwhelming vinegar taste, which pretty much ruined it for me.  I gave this a 1* because i had to, but in my opinion it doesnt even deserve that. We just ended up ordering pizza, which was a total bummer.

I have enjoyed alot of recipes from this site, but this is by far my absolute favorite. The flavor is outstanding. My husband doesn't normally like chicken wings and even he couldn't stop eating them. Before we were even done eating dinner he asked when I was making these again. I did follow the advise of some reviewers and skipped the egg & flour, and oven fried them instead. I did double the sauce, and added 1/2 the sauce before baking. The other 1/2 I boiled in a saucepan to thicken,and used some to baste with and saved some for dipping. Make sure you baste often. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us Tracy. I can finally say my husband loves wings!!!

EXCELLENT! Oh man this are soooo good! I also bake fried these to cut back on the fat. I made a second batch of sauce and thickened it up with corn starch and used it as dipping sauce.. As another viewer suggested I added crushe red pepper flakes. This is a keeper!

Last night I tried these again with a couple changes and they were even better than the first time. First I made the sauce (with about 2 tablespoons of cayanne) 24 hours in advance an let the chicken marinate overnight. I prepared them like the recipe says but let them bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. WOW what a difference! The cayanne balanced out the sweetness and the longer cooking time allowed the sauce to thicken and glaze over. This receipt is sooooo easy. All the ingredients are already in the cabinets! This is a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic!  It tastes like something you would get in a Chinese restaurant.  I used cut up chicken breasts instead of wings and on the reccomendation of others I added cayenne pepper, it added a nice zing to the flavor.  I also added corn starch but it didn't thicken it enough for my taste, so after I took it out of the oven I poured the sauce into a pan and boiled it down.

I liked the overall flavor, but as a beginner I just couldn't get the breading to stick properly to the wings.  I was so exhausted at the end that the taste unfortunately did not outweigh the effort.

My wife and I changed a few things. Instead of butter we used coconut oil, we used 1/2c of sugar and 1/4c of honey. We also added about a Tablespoon of sweet red chili sauce to give it a little kick. They were amazing!!

Don't listen to the negative reviews. The cup of sugar didn't make the wings too sweet. I'm not a sugar fan and they came out great. I wasn't sure about the vinegar at first but it works!!

This review is for the sauce only.  Very nice sticky sauce.  The second time I made this, I added 1tsp of cornstarch and heated the sauce on the stove top prior to pouring over wings.  Made it a little thicker.  FYI ...  Baked the wings at 400 for 30 minutes, flipped and baked another 25, flipped, added sauce and baked at 350 for 15 mins, flipped and finished off with another 15 mins.  Delicious!  Thanks TLTRN.

These are a little messy to make but everyone loves them. You gotta fry them in the butter ;-) makes a taste difference. and if you melt the sauce ingredients in a sauce pan it makes it easier to spread on the chicken.

This are by far the best wings I've had! I first grilled them on the BBQ for about half the time and basted them with a favorite Hoisin Sauce I make. Following that I did as one reviewer suggested by oven-frying them.  I still coated it with the egg and flour then sprayed them Pam Butter Spray.  A bit time consuming but so worth it.  We poured some Sweet Thai Chili Sauce over them and Bam! instant family hit.

This recipe is MARVELOUS! My family and I couldn't believe how great this came out. We had a rice and veggie stir fry and it complimented it well. The only thing I did different was use apple cider vinegar instead of white. Taste great as chicken tenders!

Did these, nothing too exciting to rave about. I've done my wings with soy sauce, honey & five spices, and they turn out better than these. These are too much trouble, and not enough results to show for it. The flour just didn't work for me, didn't turn out like I expected at all. Will stick to my normal wing recipe, which is easy and reliable.

I followed the recipe as is, and the wings turned out great. I was hesitant about using 1 cup of sugar, but the sauce turned out just right. It wasn't too sweet. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

My husband and I were snowed in due to a blizzard so I figured what better comfort food than chicken wings?!! I almost followed the directions to a tee, except I substituted Splenda for the sugar and used half butter half olive oil to fry it in. They came out SO yummy and crispy, next time I will cut back on the sugar a bit so they aren't so syrupy sweet but the flavor was really good!

I made this and it came out so good, I was not expecting it to be because of the vinegar and sugar mixed together.

These were wonderful. I did add a few shakes of cayenne pepper as others had suggested. Other than that, I followed the resipe as written and they were a hit. Thank you for submitting this one. I also needed a couple of eggs since my chicken wing pack was four pounds instead of three.

This recipe is wonderful!!  Very popular.  And you can cook it early in the frying pan, but then save the last step (the oven baking) for later on.  This saves time.  The frying is a bit messy, though.

Oh boy, I've been re-invited to the next party! I'm one of those that tries a recipe as written the first time. Usually. I did change things very slightly here. I eliminated the egg and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I floured the wings in a plastic freezer bag. Refrigerate the floured wings for 45 minutes. I did everything else according to the recipe. *IMPORTANT* Baste every 6-8 minutes. Now the new. Duplicate, in a sauce pan, the exact sauce recipe that you just used on the wings. Add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to 2 teaspoons of COLD water. Then add as much cayenne pepper as you like. The sauce will thicken perfectly. If it becomes too thick, just add a couple of tablespoons of water. The original recipe will please everyone, but you can make this as hot as you like with the dip. Enjoy!

WoW! These wings are delicious!  I love chicken and found this recipe to be a great way to diversify this main staple. I basically followed the recipe exactly (frying in sweet cream salted butter was a first, but definitely not the last, smelled great) except that I wanted my wings hot so I soaked them (for a few minutes)in an egg/redhot mixture before coating them in flour. Then let them sit in the fridge for about a half hour (as suggested by another 'chef'), I then coated them one last time in the flour mixture (flour and cayenne pepper)right before frying. In addtion, I put the pan under the broiler for about 5 minutes as they weren't 'crispy' enough for my taste. I added green onions and sesame seeds as toppers. These were addictive and can't wait to make again!

These wings are a crowd pleaser.  I've made them plenty of times.  My children loves them......they want me to make them all the times.  I have also baked the wings first instead of frying.  For the diabetics in my family, I substituted splenda w/ sugar instead of all sugar and they were a hit.

Very easy recipie. I've tried this recipie many times. The first time I followed it exactly, the next time I fried the chicken in corn oil, and I thought that gave the chicken more of a crunch then the butter/oil frying.

I made these last night for dinner.  I used cubed BLSL chicken breasts instead of wings.  I used 3/4c sugar and they were too sweet for my liking.  Next time I'll d/c the sugar to 1/2 cup and add some "heat" as well as some toasted sesame seeds.  I served it with steamed broccoli and rice and everyone liked it.  I was the only one who said it was too sweet.

Wowie!  These were excellent!  I added a dash of ginger to the sauce and s/p to the flour and fried them in shortening.  I didn't pour the marinade over the chicken because I didn't want them to get soggy, so I dipped the wings into the sauce and baked them that way.  It had just enough flavor with the crunchiness that we like.

Wonderful, will make many more times.
The chances I made are: salt, pepper, flour the wings, dip in milk or water, then back in flour (this will make a thcker crust
 Deep fry until done.
 I have Japanses C.W. and Buffalo C. III  sauces. 
Then dip the fried wings in the sauces, place on a cookie sheet, put in over at 300 for about 15 min..  Let the crew pick which type of wings they want..

These were truly magnificent.  I marinated the chicken overnight in soy sauce.  Instead of using wings I used boneless breasts, and instead of powder, I minced two cloves of garlic.  Not one was left.  Very similar to General Tsao's Chicken but better.  Next time I may add sesame seeds to the sauce.

These were very good. I tossed them in flour, salt, pepper and onion powder. I then sprayed with pam and baked at 350 for 45 minutes, turning once. 
I added the sauce and baked for an additional 20 minutes. I served with rice and broccoli. Very yummy for a cheap meal. I also only used a 1/2 cup of sugar.

These turned out really well, but my Japanese-Canadian bf asked “what’s Japanese about this recipe?”  Not too much, but these were good nonetheless.  I did a couple of changes to the recipe.  To make it a bit more “Asian” I substituted ¼ cup of the white vinegar for rice wine vinegar.  I also added about a tablespoon of sesame oil.  I only used ¾ a cup of sugar, but next time I would only add ½ a cup, as it was a tiny bit sweet for my taste.  I used low sodium soy sauce and completely left out the salt.  As for the cooking time, I listened to other reviewers and decided to bake them instead of frying.  I coated them in flour and sprayed them with Pam.  I baked them for about 45 minutes at 425, turning them over every 15 minutes.  I then set it to high heat broil, and added the sauce.  I broiled them for about 12 minutes, turning them over and basting the wings every 4 minutes.  Not exactly Japanese, but it’s a great “Asian inspired” recipe!

Outstanding!  Not sure why people change the recipe and then rate and review.  Everyone that changed the recipe to make it healthier has no idea what they are missing!  Your finished product is nothing like those that follow the recipe because frying in the butter completely changes the flavor and the texture of the breading.  If not done correctly the sauce doesn't soak into the breading and complete this masterpiece!  Thank you TLTRN

BEST WINGS EVER! As suggested I added garlic powder. I didn't have white sugar so I used brown instead. I also only had rice vinegar. I baked mine in the oven (400) but pan fried them in butter and oil first so the skin was crispy. I do think the sauce could be a little thicker. I think it would be great with ginger too.

These wings were easy to make and just as delicious as can be! I did season the wings w/ a little salt and pepper before coating them w/ the egg and flour but really I could not be happier they were fantastic. A real crowd pleaser for sure.

I was highly disappointed with this recipe...considering all the high reviews. I guess I should've read the ratings from lowest to highest. I really thought this was going to be yummy--even as I pulled the wings from the oven. Instead, they turned out to be a hot, gooey mess with little flavor. I even added seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder during the prep because I just don't see how people eat meat w/o seasoning it first. This recipe was time-consuming and my family just didn't enjoy it. I baked the wings for the full 45 minutes (on a non-stick aluminum foil lined pan), which was not a good idea. The skin was stuck to the foil....! Unfortunately, this was a total waste of my time (and ingredients).

It was very good, but I always like to add pepper and some Seasoning salt whenever I fry chicken. Looking at the sauce ingredients, I felt that a whole cup of sugar was way too much, so instead, I added a half cup of sugar and a little more water, which gave it a more balanced taste. Overall, great recipe, just adjust the amount of sugar!

These were the hit of the party. I marinated the wings with Stubs chicken marinade overnight. For the perfect deep brown crisp wing; found using less butter when frying was best.  My husband says these will have to be on the party menu going forward and that a five star rating is not enough. If your family likes wings try these. They'll love them.

OMG! This was SO tasty!  I followed the advice of others and did not egg and fry the chicken.  Instead I layed the pieces in a single layer in a roasting pan, sprinkled a little olive oil, then flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and cooked the chicken about 15 minutes on 400F.  I made one other yummy adustment to the sauce - I added a heaping scoop of creamy peanut butter, stirred well, and poured over the chicken.  Frequent basting, about every 10 mins, is important.  Also, as others have suggested - line your pan with heavy foil, thje sauce will be very gooey. YUMM!

My wings were not as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was great! I might try frying my wings and then tossing them in the sauce. Great flavor! Was a little too sweet for my boyfriend, so will cut back on the sugar just a little next time for him.

not bad. i didnt fry my wings, and only used the sauce portion of this recipe: the sugar and vinegar combination tastes just a LITTLE strange after a day or two. defintiely an easy recipe though-minimal dishes to wash after making this recipe and maybe boiling some spinach and garlic as a side vegie dish

These were awesome!  Restaurant quality for sure!  Cut down sugar to 3/4 cup (could probably have cut down to 1/2 cup), and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Incredible!

These were wonderfully sweet and gooey.  I had about 4 1/2 pounds of wings so I doubled the sauce.  I pre-seasoned the wings with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, dipped in egg and flour and browned them in a cast iron skillet with 1/2 Crisco and 1/2 butter.  I used raw apple cider vinegar, less sugar and I added some ginger.  Next time I will simmer the sauce first and add some cornstarch to thicken it.  It took lots longer then 30 minutes for the sauce to thicken on the wings.  I tossed some toasted sesame seeds on top when they were done.  Great Superbowl appetizer!

My husband *really* enjoyed this dish. 
I made some changes- strips of boneless skinless chicken breast, 1/2 C sugar instead of 1 C, lightly frying in canola oil vs butter. Generally the same amount of sweet is used to balance the sugar, so I stuck with that ratio, 1/2C sugar to 1/2 C vinegar.
I wish the sauce had thickened instead of remaining thin, but possibly if I had used the 1C of sugar it would have. I tried boiling it on the stove before spooning it over the chicken, but that didn't help. Next time I'll probably add 2tsp cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it. 
This is a very good recipe that allows changes to suit the chef. :)

i omitted butter and the deep frying part. i followed one of the advice of just drizzling some oil on top of the wings and popped it in the oven to broil. once it was crispy enough i started to baste the wings every so often & boy did it make a lot of smoke! but the aroma filled the kitchen & my family couldn't wait to get a taste of the wings! crispiest wings i've ever made w/o deep frying! will definitely make this once a week! better than having 30cents a wing night!

These were the surprise hit of our wing night-absolutely awesome!! Very messy to eat but I would use this marinade & method of cooking for any chicken!! GREAT flavor. I did throw the wings in a pan to thicken up because it wasn't thick enough after 40 min. No big deal-it took maybe 5 min on med-high & they thickened right up to give them that stickiness. I'll definately be making these again(soon)!! Thank you!!

Excellent.  Although I modified this recipe (not by much) it was wonderful and deserves 5 stars.  To make it healthier, I did the following:  Placed wings in a single layer in foil pan, seasoned to taste on one side (McCormick Garlic & Herb, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Paprika).  Placed 1 Tbs. Parkay in each corner of the pan and baked slightly covered for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then turned chicken and seasoned again - recovered and baked an additional 25 minutes.  I made the sauce as stated except I used 3/4 cups sugar.  After the 25 minutes in the oven, I poured sauce over chicken and baked an additional 10 minutes uncovered.  They were very delicious.

Not bad, I made this a few times until it was just right.  As is, here are a couple gotchas.  If you use egg and flour in the skillet with the cup of butter, make sure butter is hot!!!!! otherwise the wings will clump and make scrambled egg and flour mess in the pot.  Your almost better off using deep-fryer for  a couple minutes for browning.  I have read others mention to broil instead of fry, I will try that next time too.  Another item which we preferred was pick up some rice flour ( maybe a buck for 3 pounds )  instead of all-purpose flour.  it is much lighter and adheres better to the wings unless you have a few hours to chill in fridge before browning.   Now for the sauce.  add a shot of amaretto and some ground ginger to the soy and vinegar combo.  gives it that much needed asian flavor boost. other than that, this is pretty easy and good.  no blue-cheese needed.  Oh and it will work fine with a cup of splenda instead of sugar.   a cup of sugar in a wing recipe is a bit excessive.  I can see a cup in a cheesecake recipe but not for an appetizer.  the butter alone will do enough damage.

These were "OK".  I used 1/2cup of sugar instead of the whole cup and hubby still said they were so sweet they could be called dessert.  Other than reducing the sugar I made the recipe as written.  I might make again but with some spicy-ness to it to balance the sweetness.

These are awesome, next time I will add a little less soy sauce, also I "oven fried" my wings, just tossed them in some flour (no egg), sprayed with cooking spray and baked them at 450 for about 40 min and they were very crispy.  I then dipped each wing in the sauce and baked them for about another 20 min (I see no need to double the sauce as other users suggested unless you like your wings swimming in sauce) I will definetly make these again the flavour was excellent!!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and it always comes out perfect! I've used wings, boneless chicken breasts cut into strips as well as boneless, skinless thighs - even shrimp! The sauce absolutely makes this dish!

This was very good and tasted like a great chinese/japanese dish.  I thought they would come out crispy but the sauce really soaks into the breading and makes it soft.  I doubled the sauce because I noticed that it was all gone at the end of cooking time.  So I prepared some more on the stove and added some cornstarch to thicken it faster.  Added it to the chicken and cooked about 10 more minutes and served over white rice.  The sauce is sweet and sticky and tastes just like a restaurant would serve it.  Add some chopped green onions over the top and yummm!

These were amazing!  I didn't bread them, and I marinated them overnight in the sauce.  I also thickened the sauce on the stove and added corn starch to aid the thickening process.  My friends loved this!  We had edamame, sushi, and these hot wings in a japanese themed dinner party.

Everyone in my family  loves this recipe.  I've made it several times and have even tried it with chicken drumsticks, although I prefer the wings.  At first, the vinegar was kind of scary, but it does something to keep the chicken moist and creates such a nice sweetness to the dish.  You don't taste the vinegar at all, which is hard to believe when you get a whiff of it before it's baked.

Just finished making this recipe for Thanksgiving, it is delicioussssss.  I did add a little Apricot Preserves to the sauce, I'm sure it would have been just fine without it.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I make this all the time, it is my bf's all time favorite dish..  However, since we are not big wing fans, I do it with small chunks of chicken breast and I omit the egg...  Everyone always asks for this recipe :)

These are awesome!  Instead of frying in butter, I grilled the wings.  Then did the recipe almost exactly.  I cut the sugar a little.  But tweek this any way you want.

These were easy to make.  I did use foil to line my pan, easy clean up!  I also suggest basting them as they cook.  The sauce is fantastic and gets nice and thick!  We loved them!  Thanks!

This recipe is da bomb!!!  It really is good ya'll..  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that is what I had and I used margarine instead of butter but other than that I used the exact recipe as it appears to a "T" and let me tell you these things were delicious......  I made white rice and put a little soy sauce over the rice and ate it with the chicken.  It was sooooooo good.  I will definitely be making this recipe time and time again.  It actually was a very easy and quick recipe to make unlike what some people said in the reviews.  Yummy!!!

We really liked this recipe, but I couldn't rate a 5 because I had to make some changes to the sauce to suit our tastes (made it as the recipe states and the hubby and I both thought it was missing something).  So, I added about 1/2 cup of orange juice and some freshly grated ginger (about 1/2 tablespoon).  I did have to reduce the sauce on the stove a little bit...but they turned out amazing.  Will definately serve at our next gathering instead of the normal Buffalo wings.  Thanks for the post.

This was an awesome recipe. My man doesnt like sweet foods at all, so I was a little nervous about this one. But when he tasted these, all that changed. He has been praising them all day. These are a absolute keeper. At least twice a month. Do make more sauce than required and try adding a little corn starch to make it a little stickier. You'll LOVE'EM!!!

If there were only more stars. I had a asian themed party and along with my crispy salmon wontons, they were gone in a flash. I have already had a request to make these again. I was concerned that the butter would burn so along with the butter I added 1 cup olive oil which gives the same flavor as butter but without the burning. I had to beat 2 eggs and I added some fresh garlic and minced shallots that I had left over. DELICIOUS!!

This chicken is amazing! I cut the sugar in half, mixed in a dash of cayenne with the flour,and added some chopped onion to the sauce right before baking. It turned out fantastic! I served it as a main dish along with some vegetable fried rice.

I also doubled the sauce recipe so I could make the excess sauce into a delicious glaze for dipping: mix 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch with cold water. Add the mixture to the sauce and bring to a boil in a small saucepan. Boil for one minute or until thickened.

These were totally yummy!  We doubled the garlic, added a little red pepper flake, used 1/2 butter, 1/2 canola oil, and skipped the egg wash.  We cooked in the oven in a 9 x 13 pan.  We will definately make these again--but maybe in a different pan so they get a little more crispy.

This is absolutely the best chicken wing recipe I have ever had. I didnt fry in butter, I put them in my deep fryer which worked out better as it made life in the kitchen easier. The wings were a HUGE hit with my family.  I had to actually make 2 batches as my teens went wild on them.  Will certainly make this over and over again, and have passed this recipe onto all my friends and relatives.  Thank you so much for sharing this keeper!

I made a few changes just to make myself feel less guilty about these wings.   I fried them in canola oil instead of butter, and used half sugar, half splenda.  I also used chicken broth instead of water...so I omitted the salt.  Between the soy sauce and chicken broth, it was more than salty enough.  My husband really like these.  It was a lot of steps for a weeknight meal...but would make again on the weekend when I have more time.

Nothing less than 5 Stars will do for this recipe!  Why?  They have the perfect mixture of crunchy and sweet.  The sauce is simple and perfect.  I recommend you use part butter flavor Crisco for half of the real butter if you have issues with the butter burning.  I also used the chicken wings in a bag and I liked those much better than the bigger chicken wings the recipe called for (they cooked faster and I hate waiting).  These are so good you will probably have to double the recipe, so everyone will feel like they had their fair share!

I took a short cut and didn't dredge the wings and fry them first.  I marinated the wings first for 4 hours in a simple soy sauce and ginger mixture.  Then draied the wings and placed them in a FOIL lined pan.  Baked at 450 for 20 minutes then began basting with sauce every 15 minutes or so until nice and brown.  I can see why you would want to dredge and fry first.  The sauce "sticks" better.  But these still were very good and the company loved them.

Very Good!!  I made it w/chicken breasts & the hubby loved it & has asked if it can be a "regular" weekly meal (he doesn't normally like chicken). 

I did make a couple of changes.  I cut out the butter (didn't see a need for it), doubled the soy sauce & water, cut the sugar down to 1/2-3/4 C. (otherwise too sweet), cut the vinegar to 1/4-1/2 C., used minced garlic (hate the powdered stuff) & added 1/2 t. mustard powder.  I turned the chicken breasts a few times during baking to make sure they were coated with the sauce, served over rice & sprinkled cashews on top.

I thought these wings were great. I'll admit I was scared of the ingredients. all that sugar and VINAGAR! But this was fabulous! I seasoned and fried my wings like I normally do and then dipped them in the sauce and put them in the oven! I liked that the sauce was a little thin. I still got the delicous flavor without the gooey,messy, side affects! My boyfriend was scared of the soy sauce, but he loves them too!

This recipe gets quicker every time you make it.  I don't eat much meat, and I'm as picky as a 5 year old, but this taste is BEYOND amazing.  
To make it even better I used chicken breasts and put them in Ann Black's Chinese chicken salad--I am very proud of this invention.

I didn't make wings instead I used the sauce to roast chicken breast tenders in the oven.  It was delicious and I will make again.

These came out great and didn't have to alter a thing! if you like the flavor on these wings, search "Asian Salad" in AllRecipies to find a slaw that's just as good (and no, I didn't post that recipe, but have made it several times and it's always a hit!)

My family and i loved these wings.  I fixed them two days in a row.  They are sweet and tangy but oh so GOOD!  I didn't care much for frying them in butter because they tended to stick to the pan.  Maybe next time I'll oven fry them. Delicious!

These wings are out of this world! Made them for a football party and everyone raved and asked that I make them for every future party LOL. 

I oven fried them for about 30 minutes at 350 and then broiled them on high on each side for a few minutes to really crisp them up. I double the sauce to make sure they were really moistened, so I wouldn't have to keep basting them. When they were finished, there was a lot of the sauce remaining in the pan so I feared they would be dripping wet, but it seems the sugar really "latched" onto the wings. The meat fell right off the bone and the skin was extremely flavorful. Can't wait to make them again!

A bit too sweet - one of my kids wouldn't touch it as he said it was too sweet for chicken. I probably should have read some of the other reviews before making it. It was also a bit too greasy and in my opinion there was too much sauce, too. Other than that, it was good for something different.

5 stars for my 10yr old son who's favorite are the teriyaki wings from zaxby's. These were the closest runner up. Sweet and sticky but delicious. Next time tho I will try to oven fry them as another reviewer suggested to cut back on fat. Also be sure to completely cover your pan in aluminum foil or you will have one tough cleaning job!

I do hope it's okay to review this recipe even though I made it with no changes or substitutions! These are probably the best Asian-inspired wings ever. They take a little time to put together, but they certainly are worth it. I am pleased that the basting sauce does not totally destroy the crunch that the frying made, but it added so much to the wonderful flavor that it was nearly worth the sacrifice. Had the skin remained crisper during the baking phase, this would have gotten 5 stars. It's a wonderful recipe and I thank TLTRN for posting it.

Took the advice of one of the reviewers and used 1/2 the sugar the recipe called for... also didn't use the egg & flour.  Cooked them in a pan on the grill with the sauce.... they were awesome.

My husband loved them, so did my 3 year old. Im not a big wing fan anyways so i didnt care for them. To me, it was too much work for something that I really didnt like anyways. I did not fry in butter but instead did the flour/broiler/then sauce techniue. proly would be better if I had went ahead and fried them

These wings were sooooo good! My whole family loved them(even my picky child)! I did bake instead of fry and when the wings were done cooking, i poured the sauce over top and let it cook until the sauce thickened. Sticky, gooey, and delish!!!

I followed a reviewer and did not fry these before baking them. Afterwards I read that frying first will help keep the coating on them, and prevent them from sticking. I baked mine at 400 for 25 minutes (after coating them in egg & flour) then I put the sauce on and baked them at 350 for the rest of the time. The result was a burnt & smoky mess. My wings stuck so badly to the pan even though I had sprayed PAM and the sauce was burned. My husband still ate them (God bless him!) and through the burnt sauce I could tell that had I not burned them they would have been great! I had to throw away my pan! I would like to try these again and fry them first.

Yum! I don't fry many things and noticed half way through much of the crust was sticking to the pan. I am not sure if it was my pan or my margarine I used instead of butter,  so I grilled the others. I didn't add any coating to the ones that were grilled. I lightly seasoned them with garlic salt and pepper. Then I baked all of them with the sauce. I decided to reduce the sugar by 1/4 C. and it was perfect for us! Love the flavors! I liked the ones that were fried, but the grilled ones had a good crisp to them as well. I think I will grill all of them next time and have less clean up.

The sauce is delicious if you add some hoisin sauce and sriracha.  I fried, baked, and basted per the recipe and the skin is soggy.  I ate them up, but my wife was grossed out due to soft chicken skin.  Next time I would simmer the sauce and deep fry the wings.

These wings are definitely good.  Also, I like to add a couple cloves of garlic, some red chili flakes, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Don't skip crisping the wings before adding the sauce.  It makes the wings sticky, crispy, and perfect. I pour out the juice from the wings after I crisp them to avoid watering down the sauce.  It's a small step that makes a difference.  I guarantee you'll love these wings.

I followed the another's advice and cooked them in the oven instead of stove top.  Excellent wings.  My son told me to make them more often.

Fabulous flavor.  I used much less sugar, little more soy, only had apple cider vinegar and added dried garlic flakes.   Excellent for parties or one.  I pigged out!
An amateur can do this dish.  This is a keeper, forever.  Thank you!

I also oven baked these instead of frying them and they turned out great!  My husband who is a picky eater raved about them and said they were as good as the restaurant we usually order from.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup as previously suggested and will be trying boneless chicken next time.  Will definitely be making again! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it was not as good as I thought it would be. The sauce was good, but I didn't like the uncrispy skin and it was very messy. I will not be making this again. To much work for the outcome.

Like many others I just baked wings after rubbing them with some olive oil, salt, and pepper.  After baking 25 minutes at 425, I started basting the wings every 5 minutes for a total of about 50 minutes.  The taste of this sauce is great, a good change-up from the regular hot wing.  This is definitely becoming part of my repertoire!

I followed the recipe with the exception of the breading and frying. I baked the wings for 40 mins with black pepper and garlic powder then poured the sauce and turned them every 10 mins for a half hour. Some of my wings didn't get sticky enough so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to carmelize the sugar a bit....DELICIOUS

THESE ARE SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!  My husband and I try the wings wherever we go trying to find the best in town and we thought we found them until I tried this recipe.  I made them for my family tonight instead of going out and I can honestly say we will never go out for wings again.  So easy to make and finger licking good, unbelievable flavor.  I made the recipe as is and it was perfect!

Fantastic.  I did coat mine in flour mixture, with flour, garlic and ginger.  Then i put them in the fridge for about 90 mins, fried in deep fryer until brown.  Put back in shallow pan and covered iwth liquid mixture.  Baked 30-40 min.

Very good wings!  I made some for our Super Bowl "Pre Game" meal  aka lunch.   I took the advice from other reviewers;  instead of frying the wings I baked them.  Marinated wings with salt & pepper the night before.  This morning, I dusted the wings with min. amount of flour, sprayed with PAM then baked at 400F for 40 minutes, turned once.    Cooked the sauce in a sauce pan, using the ingredients suggested plus 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, until thickened.  Used a pastry brush to apply the sauce on both sides of wings.  Baked at 400F and basted every 8 - 10 minutes for a total of 35 minutes.  Just had enough sauce for that purpose.  The wings were sticky but not messy.  My husband and our son loved them.    Thanks for the recipe!  Definitely will make them again.

I really like this recipe but really recommend not frying the wings. I love fried food but don't fry these wings. They taste better just baked. Take your wings and season them w/ what you like... garlic salt, salt.. etc. spray with some pam and bake at 375 for 30 minutes, flip bake 20 minutes. Then add the sauce and baste often until wings are fully cooked like 20-30 minutes. Yummy!!

Used drumsticks and thigh pieces instead of wings. But it was definitely super delicious! Basted once every 6-8 minutes seemed perfect.

My family thoroughly enjoyed them. I changed it a bit: I did not fry, but oil, season (salt, pepper, dry mustard, garlic powder)and egg white (mix up the chicken in a bowl to coat and season)lightly flour and bake in oven for about 20 mins to brown and broil for last 15-20 mins (or however you desire for crispiness and brownness). Once crispy, baste w/ sauce until chicken is done. For sauce, double it. Use half of sugar. Last batch of sauce when basting, add a little cornstarch/water mix to thicken.

This was okay. I made this Recipe using less than two pounds of Chicken Wings (that's all I had on Hand). I would definitely double the Sauce next Time!

I seasoned 4lbs of wings with seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder then coated with flour omitting the egg. Oven roasted 25 mins @ 400F flipping half way. Doubled the sauce but halved the sugar then transferred the wings to a 9x13 baking dish. Baked for 45 mins @ 350F turning frequently. Very good!

While browsing recipes for chicken wings, I couldn't help but notice how many good reviews this one had. When I saw how simple the ingredients were, I had to try it. I have to say that I love the sticky, gooey sauce, and the chicken cooked perfectly.

I did make some adjustments the second time around. I dredged the wings in seasoned flour before and after the egg wash. The coating stuck much better that time. I also used just a half-cup of sugar and fried with canola oil instead of butter.

Very good.  I like my wings to have a glaze on them, so I added honey instead of the sugar.  I loved them!

These are the greatest chicken wings I have ever tasted in my life. My wife (who's screen name I'm logged into at the moment) and I make these almost once a month and they never get old. The taste is phenomenal, trust me, you have to try these wings.

So So good. I took the advice and baked them instead. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika....My family loved this with rice. I will make again this weekend for an appetizer for Sunday football...

I have made this many times -- sometimes using the healthier variations that people have posted and sometimes using the original recipe -- and it remains an absolute family favorite! Only gave it 5 stars because I couldn't give it more! :)

Thanks for the great recipe - very tasty wings! I gave this 5 stars for taste, but want to add a few notes about cooking: I don't see how it's possible for one egg coat 3 lbs of wings - count on using 2 or 3 depending on how heavily you coat the wings. Also, I have a very large skillet, but I still needed to brown these in 3 rounds. Plan on a little extra time for this.

These were awesome. We made these and the Ginger Orange Glazed Chicken Wings recipe from this site, which were good, but the clear favorite in our house was the Japanese Chicken Wings. The sauce reminded me of the Jack Daniels sauce from TGIF.

These were easy to make and great.  For an even healthier alternative I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I defat and cut into half.  Rolled each half up to kind of make them look like a chicken wing.  Marinated them in the sauce for the day, then baked them off at 400F for 30 minutes, basting every 5 minutes.  Didn't need to 'fry' anything, and they tasted great!  Extra sauce for dipping is nice.

These were delicious...I didn't dredge them in flour or fry them though for health reasons. I made 2 batches of the sauce, in one batch I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours then poured it all in a pan and baked it at 350. The second batch I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to and heated it on the stove then used it to baste the chicken while it was cooking.  I also added a bit of ginger and red pepper flakes to spice it up. I broiled the chicken for about 5 minutes at the end to crisp it up and give it a nice golden brown color. They were awesome!!!

I've got to say, I've made this many of the suggested ways...breading/not breading, basting/not basting, frying/baking/broiling, wings/legs...the point is, find what version you think your family will like, and make it...they most likely will.  The jewel here is the sauce.  It is delicious (after cutting back the sugar to 1/2 cup...otherwise it's a little too sweet).  We like these in all different versions but mostly for the same reason...the sauce is excellent!

This is a very tasty recipe. The first time I made this I half baked the chicken wings first (sprayed with a little oil) then made the sauce and then cooked the chicken wings in the sauce in the ove. I found them very sweet- I don't know if it's just my taste, but the next time I halved the amount of sugar and still found it very sweet. Next time I'll just keep cutting the sugar back until I find the right amount. Otherwise a very yummy recipe!!

Tasty!  Like the other hundred people that'd reviewed this before I tried it, I modified.  No frying, but baking for an hour at 375, then adding sauce for last 15 minutes.    Doubled sauce recipe and added garlic, red pepper and ginger; thickened with corn starch.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  Served with rice.  I think I'll try it with boneless chicken next.  Sauce is very sticky, so hard to eat as a wing.  But worth it!

These wings are terrific.  I've made them several times now so it's time to write a quick review.  I follow the recipe with one change: two eggs instead of one.  Anyway, when put out at a gathering, they are gone so fast I'm lucky if I get even one!  Very tasty!

Great recipe! I did make a few variations. I did not dip the wings in the egg(I forgot), I used vegatable oil for browning and I added a little ginger and crushed red peppers to the sauce mixture (which I warmed in a sauce pan before pouring over the wings.) They were wonderful, I will be preparing these wings again.  I have already shared this recipe with coworkers.

I made this recipe last year for a Memoirs of the Geisha Party and it got rave reviews.  I made two changes: I took a short cut by using wingettes and frying the wingettes in a deep fryer with vegetable oil. I am making it again for a holiday party next week.

It was a hit with my friends, but it was also too sweet for my taste.

I made these for relatives awhile ago & it was a hit.  I basted some with baking and some without.  The ones that I basted turned out much sweeter than the un-basted ones.  Some preferred the sweeter ones covered with sticky sauce, and some preferred the crispier, drier, and less-sweet ones.  Both were delicious.  Kind of troublesome to fry & bake - not a quick recipe.

This recipe was really easy and yummy. I added honey instead of the sugar and veg. oil instead of the butter. I even cut back on the honey and still found the wings to be too sweet! On the other hand, my husband loved it!! Thanks!

This was delicious although I used oil to fry instead of butter.  I also changed the recipe slightly as I ran out of soy. For the sauce (quantities were halved as I had a smaller amount of wings), I used 1 Tblsp soy sauce, 1 Tblsp oyster sauce & 1 Tblsp hoisin sauce as well as the other sauce ingred.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!

Awesome. I took the leftovers to work today and everyone asked for the recipe. I, too, added some oil to prevent the butter from turning brown. A+++++

These wings are showstoppers! Absolutely delicious and worth the effort to prepare them. I followed the suggestion of other testers to add cayenne to balance the sweetness, and they had a pleasant, but not overwhelming, kick. The frying in butter step was kind of scary to me until I did it - I just used the pot I normally boil pasta in, and it was deep enough to absorb all the splatters and my kitchen was not at all trashed. Per the suggestion of another tester, I did add some canola oil to the butter (about a 3:1 butter to canola ratio) and it helped the butter to not overbrown (provided you fry at med. high heat and not high). Finally, do line your roasting pan with foil to help cleanup. As these finish up in the oven, the sauce that was beautifully caramel-y and baste-able turns into a rock hard, baked-on substance (at least you'll know they're done)! Also, I prepped these through the frying stage the night before, then refrigerated. Save a few extra minutes in the oven, they turned out just as lovely.

This chicken recipe is awesome! I used Drake's frying coating because I had a hard time getting the flour to stick and I used large chicken drumsticks just because they have more meat on them than wings. Our kids loved this and they can be picky! Second time I made it I used chicken breast cut in large chunks and served over stir fry veggies and rice. EXCELLENT recipe - thanks for sharing!

Great! I'll add this to my keepers. Followed the instructions, but added sesame oil, and skipped the egg wash. I basted the chicken every 10 minutes, and baked it a full 50 minutes, for 3 pounds of drumettes. Received great reviews from my guests, even though it was my first time trying out the recipe. Thanks!

Excellent!  The only changes I made were to add about a tsp of ginger, a tbs of sesame seeds, and not to fry but just dredged and baked (and basted) after marinating for 4 hours.  The sauce was wonderful!  Also, I think next time I will use boneless, skinless chicken tenders.  Wings were too hard for the kids to eat.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very delicious.  I would change two things.  I would definitely add salt and pepper to the flour mixture.. It provides base seasoning to the chicken.  Secondly, I agree with other posters: ginger and red pepper flakes balance the sweetness of the original recipe.

So good! Very sticky and sweet. I didn't have white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar, which I think was wonderful. I add just a bit of corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up before I poured it over the wings. Will definately make it again!

It was great I did 1 teaspoon garlic and mixed the water and soy with 1 tablespoon corn starch then added to sugar and vinager mix. Make sure you have your butter up to temp to do a quick brown on the egg and flower (very important). This Rec. can be played with very easaly. have fun. Note: serve with a damp cloth for face and hands.

Wow, We loved these.  After frying the wings, I baked them for the full 45 minutes in the 350 degree oven, and basted them about every 5 minutes.  They were outstanding.  My husband claimed he wasn't hungry when I told him I was making wings, but once they came out of the oven he said he was starving and gobbled them down.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made these wings numerous times for alot of different guests as well as for parties and they are always a superbe HIT!  
I have even made this recipe using drumsticks...the meat just falls off the bone...
The only bad thing about these wings is that they are super addictive, and since they aren't really healthy, you gotta stop yourself from overeating LOL

Would rate this a 5+!  I made these wings to go along with Pancit and Lumpia for hubby's birthday dinner and it was a well received.  Instead of the butter I used canola oil to fry the wings AND doubled the sauce.  Seseme seeds tossed on top with some chopped green onion would go well too.  Not the healthiest recipe because of the coating/frying......but good for every now and then - definitely a keeper for our kitchen!  You do need to like the tanginess and smell of vinegar - I think using balsamic would work really well in the recipe for a subtle change!
Thanks!

Really easy to make. This was a hit with my family the very first time I made it. I  took the suggestion of using chopped garlic instead of powder and used olive oil instead of the butter. It was wondeful! My family couldn't get enough of it. Oh and if you have a deep fryer, it works very well with that too!

These are outstanding! I don't like frying food, but this wasn't so bad- I may try it with oil and not butter next time though since butter has a tendency to burn on med-high heat. Regardless, the end result was wonderful. I did marinade the cooked wings in the sauce for about 45 minutes before I transfered them to the oven. Also, I used real garlic (minced) and added green onions, which topped it off perfectly. Thank you so much for this recipe. My tastebuds thank you.

Loved these as a great change from hot wings.  I did tweak the recipe a little: used vegetable shortening instead of butter because it can burn so easy, used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar because it is not so hard and then added 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds to the mix.  Line the pan with heavy duty foil to avoid a huge mess.  Kids loved them.

Very tasty chicken dish.  After reading the reviews I made some simple changes to add more flavor and thicken the sauce. 1) I used 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  2) Marinated the chicken in the sauce all day.  3) Removed chicken from sauce and fried according to the directions.  4) Strained the sauce into a small saucepan and added 1 T. of cornstarch and heated until thickened, then poured over the chicken to bake.  This came out very flavorful, sweet and sticky!

A little too sweet for our taste even though I've cut down the sugar to 3/4. But it's still delicious! The chilli flakes really adds extra punch to this dish.

This was a big hit with my family. My husband and young children loved it. I also browned the chicken in oil and used less sugar. Great flavor. I will definately make this again!

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!! I've made this about 5 times now...I've made it with wings, thighs, and my favorite- cubed boneless skinless breasts.  It's wonderful as is, but one variation is to add sesame seeds, and another variation is too add crushed dried red chilis, that way it becomes sweet and spicy.  This is a fantastic recipe- I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

It was good, it would of been better if you could turn the sauce into a glaze and just dunk your wings into it...I'd make it again though

These were really good! i made them for my skinny friend and she went back for 3rds. Her 3 year old ate it w/no complaints. I don't know that i'd fry them in butter next time. that was a lot of butter and it has a tendency to burn. i added minced garlic & chili sauce. i would definitely make this again. thanks!

Yummy!  Yummy!  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of wings.  I fried the chicken in a non-stick pan with only about a 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  I used garlic salt in place of the garlic powder and omitted the salt.  I also added a little bit of crushed garlic.  My family loves garlic!  Next time I'll add a little corn starch to the sauce.  This was soooo good!

YUMMY, yummy, yummy!!  I loved this recipe.  I'm not a wing person, so I subbed 12 tenderloins for the 3 lbs. of wings.  I only had to use 1 stick of butter to fry my chicken in and I would cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup since it was a little too sweet.  I added 1 Tsp of sesame oil for a little extra flavor and about 1 Tbls of cornstarch to the soy sauce mixture before I poured it on and the sauce thickened up beautifully....fully coating the chicken. Many thanks Tracy, I'll definitley be keeping this one.

I was looking for something different to do with my chicken wings, and came across this recipe. I was skeptical of the vinegar, so I read the reviews to be on the safe side. Everyone enjoyed them, even a first time cook. Needless to say I tried the recipe and it was a HIT. My family (3 boys and a husband) enjoyed them.I added some egg drop soup, and chicken fried rice along with them. This is the first left over that we've had in a long time to disappear before noon the next day. 

Thanks for the reviews!!!

Wow! These were tasty! My daughter thought they were the best! We served over "Quick Fried Rice." I used a little less sugar and a little more garlic powder. Took a little longer to bake than required but still good. Thanks Tracy.

I made it as the recipe says, but the crunchiness from frying gets soggy if you put the sauce on during oven cooking. Next time I will cook in the oven and toss them in a bowl with the sauce just before serving.

8 13 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/23312/japanese-chicken-wings/ ... 'Made this & these ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/88438/teriyaki-chicken-wings/ ... While neither was "the bomb," K liked these, Japanese, better. I fry when necessary so didn't. :D To one cup flour, added 1/2t ea paprika & garlic powder. Cayenne would be a good addition to the flour & omitting water or subbing for more soy sounds like it'd be better, too. I floured 'em & baked on a moderately-oiled foil-lined sheet; placed More-skin-side down in oil then turned over n sprayed em with oil on the floury parts. Baked at 400, thirty minutes; turned over the drumettes & baked thirty more. 'Sauced everyone till lookin' good, 20? The flavor of these is predominantly sweet, slightly sweet; no soy or tang from the vinegar detectable. This baking method - first time I've tried - was good. Yay for me! :) Thanks for the recipe, TLTRN!

I have been making this recipe for years and my son begs for it every night! I limit it to once or twice/month!!  I follow the instructions to the T but often skip egg and it doesn't seem to matter.  I also often use brown sugar. Don't even follow the measurements anymore but just add each ingredient till it seems right.  Also it makes it so much easier for me to simply buy "party wings" which is chicken drummettes and wingettes instead of cutting the wings which I can't quite figure how to do as well as the butcher does!I only bake in oven for @ 20 min.  Thanks so much!

I used this recipe for my friends Super Bowl party. These were a huge hit. I did add a drop of mustard and hot sauce. I also did not add the 1/2 glass of vinegar. I used about 1/3. And my marinate for the wings were slamming. Love this recipe. It's definitely a keeper

Very good.  I made these as a dry run for the Super Bowl appys and will be making them on game day.  I did fry the wings to brown them, then baked in the oven until done before adding the sauce.  Yummy!

I did it exactly like the recipe, and after the cup of butter and cup of white sugar, I'm pretty sure it's the most unhealthy thing I've ever made. Also pretty yummy. But it was a little one note for my taste. Too much sugar and no other real notes. Next time I'll fry in oil, and add lime zest.

I was just sitting in my living room, minding my own business, when I got the urge to make some badass wings. My lovely wife isn't a fan of wings, mostly since she's used to hot wings, so this recipe caught my eye. I am pleased to report that my wife is now a convert, and I will be making these again. THESE ARE WINGS FOR THE GODS! 

I did deviate slightly from the recipe, substituting out rice vinegar for white and adding a tablespoon of ginger powder. I also garnished the whole assemblage with sliced green onions. It was good. So good.

Very good recipe! Will definitely make these again. I combined a few of the reviewers' comments. I seasoned with garlic powder and paprika, sprayed with PAM and then broiled until both sides of wings were browned/a bit crispy. And then followed recipe's directions to bake for 35 min with the sauce.

These wings are oh so delicious!  I marinated wings in the sauce overnight, then baked at 375 for about 45 mins, turning as needed to brown and cook through.  In the meantime, I boiled the sauce and thickened wih corn starch.  Once wings were cooked, I tossed them in the gooey sauce.  They came out sweet and gooey and so yummy!

This was good but just a little too sweet. We still enjoyed our meal. I served it with fried rice. Thanks for sharing!

Incredible! Fabulous! so good I use this recipe for chicken breast also, the frying locks in the flavor, the cooking sets the sauce, the end result is so good!!! I make the coating gluten free, this is one of my favorites!

Really good recipe. It's a family favorite type of chicken wings and pretty easy to make. But CAUTION: I sprayed my baking pan with cooking spray then put the foil and a little bit more of cooking spray. This makes an EASY cleanup.

Great recipe and fairly easy to make. I did alter the recipe based on the tips from others. I did not fry - instead I coated with olive oil and seasoned with paprika and garlic powder. I broiled the seasoned wings in the oven 9 mins on each side by placing it on a rack over a cookie sheet lined with foil. This made the skin crispy.

Excellent wings!  Like other reviews, I egged and floured the wings and put them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes.  I then added the sauce and baked them another thirty minutes at 350 degrees.  They were delicious and oven baked rather than fried.  I can't wait to try them again!!!

My family loved it. I fried the wings. I substituted 1 Tbsp. of soy sauce with teriyaki marinade and I used ground ginger instead of garlic. I also put them in the broiler for a about 5 minutes at the end to make them crispy.  They turned out great!

These were really good!  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception, I fried the wings in a mix of peanut and olive oil instead of butter.  Worked fine.  I also used wing sections (about 26-28).  Be careful not to place your pan too low in the oven or you'll burn the sugar in the sauce and that's a difficult mess to clean up.  Unless you're using a good quality non-stick pan, line it with heavy duty aluminum foil.  I turned mine once, half way through the baking time, which sufficed for basting.  You can really smell the vinegar while these are in the oven, but don't worry, the end result is sweet and delicious.  Mine were done in 35 mins.  Will definitely make these again.

Perfect! I have made them 3 times in 3 weeks...easy to make and taste delicious! After the first time I made them, I used brown sugar instead of white...personal preference, and added a little sesame seed oil....but they are delicious with or without these changes.

This recipe is amazing! Its really sweet in a good way. When I made it I was a little hesitant on putting that much sugar, so I put less and added more soy sause. Sweet and tangy! I would recomend this recipe to anyone.

This is my official go to recipe for chicken wings. The only thing I changed was using vegetable oil instead of butter. It's so delicious and everyone loves it. I've had 8 different people try it so far and they all think it's amazing. You can't go wrong with this recipe. It's easy and it will get you compliments.

I doubled the sauce using only half of the recommended sugar and added some sriracha hot chile sauce to taste. (I think I add cornstarch to thicken it so it would stick) Did not use egg or flour, just salted chicken and poured over chicken legs/thighs after baking them for 30-45 minutes depending on size at 400(thay were big chickens). Baked for another 30 minutes at 375 basting often. For side dishes I Made white rice and for vegetable dish heated a teaspoon of sesame oil and olive oil and stir fried bok choy, spinach, shredded carrots sprinkled with sunflower seeds and soy sauce.

Made these for a Super bowl party I attended; they were a HUGH hit. I also baked "fried" my wings which took longer than 45mins however when they were ready they were perfection.

Used a combination of hints from several reviews....YUM-YUM-YUM. I loved the sauce! Next time, I will definitely fry the wings instead of baking....they were super tasty as "baked", I can't wait to try them as the recipe calls for the quick fry :) great pointer about using foil to line the pan! Clean up is easier.

Took another reviewers advice and baked them! After they were done baking it posed them in a bowl with the sauce, made sure I coated all of them. Let them sit for 5 minutes then back in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes. (I had cooked them at 400 for 40 min before). And not oh boy! Kids and hubby loved them! Now they're called the chicken n' waffles wings! Just enough breaking for the waffles and almost a maple flavor! Yummo!!

Just made these wings, and everyone ate them up! I followed the recipe, and added about a tablespoon of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to balance the sugar and to add a little spicy :) Next time, will add more...Also, I did 375 degrees just because I thought 350 wouldn't get the wings as crispy as we like them...next time, I will bake them at 400 and watch them. Will be making these again soon!

I fried my wings first. After letting them drain out, I mixed together the ingredients for the sauce. Left out the extra salt. Threw it in a pan added a little flour wisked it while it heated. Then covered my wings in it. Delish!!! This is a keeper!!!

This was very good. Excellent even. I wanted more of a garlic taste so I added mince garlic to the butter before frying. I also used 2 eggs and seasoned the eggs with onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper before dipping in flour. And right before frying I sprinkle garlic salt on the already floured chicken wings. I had none for leftovers. Will make this again.

Very good! I went with the suggestion to use less sugar, so I halved it. Glad that I did, it was sweet enough. Next time I am going to try honey as well.

I know that people are changing this recipe to make a healthier version, but this version is perfect just the way it is. We make these wings once a year, because they are so fattening, but it is a very special treat. We do not tweak the recipe at all. I made these for my boyfriend the first time he came over to dinner. He is still with me 8 years later, and still talks about these wings as his favorite dish. I maintain that this is the reason he stays with me. HA! These wings are the ONLY food I eat fried. I have tried the other recipe suggestions, and so far, this exact recipe is the best and most well received. If you have dietary restrictions, go ahead and switch it up. However, if you want a decadent, sinfully unhealthy treat once in a while, definitely try these. They are easy to make, extremely messy, and a hit with everyone who has ever tasted them.

I read the reviews and changed the recipe as well.. I broiled these in the oven, then changed it over to regular bake and added the sauce to the wings as I constantly turned them to make sure the sauce was evenly applied... These were terrific!!! My family loved them, and I will definitely be making them again.

I really didn't expect these to be so good with the soy sauce and sugar.  They were sweet and sticky, the perfect way to enjoy wings on a Sunday.  My family couldn't stop eating them.  I doubled the recipe and it worked out well.  Thanks, another family favorite!

My boyfriend and his kids love this recipe.  It is a little to sweet for me.  I like adding fresh grated ginger or something with a little spice, but they like it just the way it is.  I also don't always use this with wings, I will take a chicken breast cut it into fingers and then go from there.  I think it's a good basic recipe to make your own.

I tried this recipe without the egg, flour, butter frying and just used the marinade and grilled them. They were great. Tonight I tried the recipe as listed and it just seemed like too much. I had a film of butter on my tongue afterwards (and I only used half of what the recipe called for). I give the sauce a thumbs up and the frying a thumbs down.

All loved this!!! I followed almost exactly but I only used 1/2 C. sugar, I think I could have gone w/ less. I never made wings before but  these were good! I actually used the butter to fry them in and I guarantee I will try something more healthy next time. It took way longer than 1 hour if you factor in prep. time.

I read another review and decided to bake instead of fry - well, sort of.  I put a few pats of butter and several large spoonfuls of coconut oil into a broiler pan (foil lined) and then placed the flour dredged wings (didn't use egg, the flour stuck just fine)side by side in it.  I cooked in a 400 degree oven, 20 minutes on each side, but I did kick it up to 450 in the last 5 minutes (only one drumette was overcooked, the rest of the wings and drumettes were perfect).  I also doubled the sauce (using my own homemade garlic/soy sauce) because there never seems to be enough and I'm glad I did.  I poured half over them and the other half when I flipped, making sure to stir thoroughly.  WOW!  This was like candied, garlic chicken wings!!!  Amazingly good and sticky!  YUM!  Definitely a keeper and SO EASY!  Oh, we ate them with a little ranch dressing, uberlicious!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

i took the advice i read in one of the reviews and oven fried the chicken. i also cut the sugar in half and used 1/4 cup rice vinegar & 1/4 cup white vinegar.  yum yum yum!  since i made about half the amount of chicken wings called for, i took the rest of the sauce, added 1/4 cup orange juice & a little bit of cornstarch and cooked it down to make a delicious dip for the wings.  definitely a recipe to keep!  :)

My Husband and I made this last night for dinner!  Absolutely scrumptious!  Next time I will double the sauce.  I did not have any white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar mixed with 3 tbsp. of water. The next time I will try it witht the white vinegar.

I have had this recipe in my box for some time.  The sauce was good (added some fresh grated ginger and some cayenne), although sweet with 1 cup of sugar.  If the wings weren't floured and fried but simply baked I might have liked them. They fried up nicely in the butter and were very crispy, but they got very soggy being baked in the sauce for over half an hour.  They were quite tender and fall off the bone, but I was turned off by the texture from the flour once it got "wet" again.  I was hesitant and feared that this might happen, not sure if I did something wrong but was bummed because it got such good reviews.

We followed some of the other reviewers and baked the wings instead of frying them in butter.  

We seasoned the wings with garlic powder, paprika, and pepper before baking them at 375 for about 50 minutes (turning them over once).  We then added the sauce and broiled for an additional 15 minutes, tossing around in the sauce throughout.  We loved the flavor!

Finally something my VERY picky 10 year old will eat!!  I changed this just a bit out of necessity and screw-ups... but it still worked.  I was planning on oven-frying, but realized I just didn't have the time.  I had already floured the wings (with garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper added in), but had NOT egged them.  I decided to pan-fry just to save a little time, and I used a mixture of butter and canola oil.  Because I hadn't egged first, I probably lost most of the flour coating, but it still turned out well.  I cut down on the sugar in the sauce just a bit (about 3/4 cup instead), and didn't put in quite as much salt as called for (soy sauce is salty enough).  I baked them at about 400 degrees for about half an hour, basting 3 or 4 times.  My daughter called them her "favorite meal ever!"

This is the best wing recipe ever with the following changes: I used chicken strips instead of wings and fried them (for a total of 10 minutes, turning over after 5 min.) in a half stick of butter and a half cup of olive oil (this prevents the butter from burning). I also added a clove of minced garlic and a half tablespoon of minced fresh ginger to the sauce and thickened a little on the stove before pouring over the chicken.  I then cooked them in the oven for 20 minutes. Everyone raved about them!

I LOVED this sauce! My boyfriend and I were literally licking our fingers it was so good - the only reason I'm only giving this four stars is that I used only 1/4 cup of sugar (I used brown sugar) since the amount of sugar seemed excessive. So, if prepared as is, this is probably way too sweet for me - but with the reduced sugar this is heavenly. Also, a minor change, but I used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar (mostly because I wanted to use it up).

Terrific wing recipe!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and oven fried them by seasoning with garlic salt and fresh ground pepper, floured them and then sprayed with Pam - I like wings well done so they were in the oven for a good 35-40 minutes on 400.  I made the sauce on the stovetop to ensure the sugar dissolved and then just spread it over the wings.  Everyone at my party raved about them!  Thanks for a great and different recipe!

5 stars, but with some changes: I reduced the amount of sugar y a little more than 1/4, and substitued the water for orange juice... Garnished with some chopped green onions, and they are an instant hit!!! :)

I love these wings and have been making them for years.  May tweak them as other suggests since we are trying to be healthier.  It will still be a cheat night meal but....it will be so worth it.  I make these with the Japanese soup, rice and salad with Japanese style dressing.  Completely satisfying meal and nobody leaves the table hungry or unsatisfied.

Wow this was really good. I do recommend to add some cayenne pepper to the sauce to give it some zing. This recipe tastes a lot like general tso. I'm planning to make it next time using chicken breast to serve with rice.

This recipe is a hit. I made a few changes and it still turned out amazing. Instead of frying the chicken in all that butter, I oven baked my chicken wings then coated them with the sauce. I also only used 1/2 cup sugar to the sauce and this came out to be a winner!

First...this was very tasty like sweet and sour chicken.  I made a few changes:
1) I did use egg (brown cage free healthy) and whole wheat flour that I seasoned and browned both sides of the chicken in olive oil...not butter.  
2) I had leg and thighs but this still worked well.
3) I made the sauce the day before and the flavor was more uniformed.  
4) I used the extra sauce that I had from the pan that the chicken was cooking in the oven in some whole wheat noodles that I had to go with this dish.

If you are going to reduce the sugar by say 1/2 cup then change the amount of the other ingredients as well but make the sauce ahead so that the flavors have a chance to blend.  

This was great and I can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe!  I made these 3 weekends in a row.  I always double the recipe and use boneless chicken thighs in addition to the wings.  We usually eat the wings the first day and the next night eat the thighs over white rice. Very tasty!

I've made this twice using sliced chicken breasts and on the stove instead of the oven. I served it over steamed rice. My son and guests loved it. "Tastes better than the Chinese food we buy", was the comment I received.

I really liked this recipe and it was not hard to make at all.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added cornstarch to my sauce before pouring it over the wings.  It did thicken up nicely after about 35 minutes.  I only had Apple Cider Vinegar but it still turned out great.  My hubby loved it, so I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will try frying it in canola oil rather than butter.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

So I skipped the first step of frying the wings. I prepared the sauce as stated and put the chicken to marinate in it in the fridge for an hour and a half. I then baked the chicken for an hour and a half. Smelled and looked good while cooking. I didn't use a whole cup of sugar but more like a half cup. The chicken wasn't too sweet but the sauce only stayed on the skin and didn't get to the meat. I would make it again and let it marinate longer. I served it with mashed potatoes, stir fry vegetables and biscuits. Was a great meal.

I opted not to fry per the recipe for calorie saving reasons.  I oven fried also and the taste of the sauce was very good if you like a sweet sauce.  I know that it would have been extra yummy had I fried it in butter per the recipe, but my conscience wouldn't let me do it.

I just deep fried it for 10 minutes then stir fried in the sauce for a few minutes.  The sauce is too sweet even with half the sugar but it's because I prefer salty to sweet.  I just added more soy sauce to it.

very good!! the frying and cooking time is the only thing I would change next time.  I used only 1/2 cup sugar, and they were sweet enough.  my hubby even enjoyed the wings! he said the taste remind him of the hawaiian steak flavor from Houston's.  the sauce is sweet, hawaiian terriyaki tastin.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These were an absolute delight. I, like many others, "oven fried" the wings which turned out really well but while preparing the sauce it seemed as if the vinegar overwhelmed the spices even while checkin on them in the oven it was still dominant however once the wings were complete the sauce had caramelized and thickened and the harsh vinegar smell was leveled out by the sugar. I was tremendously leary on how well they would turn out but I am extremely happy that I took the chance. I believe if u use less sugar you will be overwhelmed by the vinegary smell and taste. I used 3/4 cup of sugar but followed the original recipe to a tee aside from "oven frying." It was really simplistic and cut down on my cooking time. If you choose to "oven fry" take your wings and season them as you normally would deep frying. Once floured, place in a baking dish which has been coated with non stick cooking spray. Set oven to 450 and bake for abt 40 minutes.* Pour sauce onto the wings and then place back into the oven for about 20 additional minutes. Make sure to turn your chicken half thru both baking times. Enjoy!

I loved these wings!  They could probably be tinkered with a little bit, but the original recipe is a great start.  These wings are even good reheated in the microwave.

I thought these wings were really good. However it did take my husband and I both to make them. My kids really liked them cuz they wernt to hot. Just make sure you dont melt the butter before you are really ready that was a mistake we made.

I added Sriracha and fresh cilantro to my recipe and it was bordering insanity GOOD!  You can't go wrong with these wings and the recipe affords so much play in the end product.

The flavor in this dish is outstanding.  My wife is Japanese and she loved these!  For those who want a crispy wing, the method of cooking is not quite the way to go.  Next time I think I will not use egg, make sure to shake off the access flour and use EVOO to fry them.  The wings were a little "floury" and not very crisp.  I might use a little less sugar next time too.  But as-is, this recipe really is fantastic!  Play with it and make it your own!

I used drumsticks and I baked them instead of frying them in a pan first. The sauce was really good, but you don't get the sauce if you don't eat the skin. If I make these again, I'll use skinless.

These are FANTASTIC! I did add a little seasoning to the flour mixture (garlic powder and seasoning salt) and I basted the wings, rather than just pour it all in, but these were a hit with my entire family and not one wing was left!!

These were very easy to make, tasted good, and were easily the Superbowl Party favorite. However, I was hoping for a bit more flavor or possibly more glaze. The recipe is what it is, but I like my wings sloppy and not just a little messy.

These wings are YUMMY!!!  I made these for a party and they were devoured in a matter of minutes, if that.  If you are looking for something spicy, this is not your recipe, but if you are craving something on the sweet asian side, this is perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I will be making these many times in the future I'm sure.

Wow!  There are are some recipes that will be just above the rest and are "remarkable".  That is how I feel about this one.  It is that good IMO.  I found it supper easy to make.  I did add a bit or salt and freshly ground black pepper to the flour.  I also doubled the sauce so that I could baste it during the baking.  I had to use 2 eggs because one wasn't enough for the amount of wings I had.  This one is a keeper!  Thx!

followed the recipe exactly, and was very pleased with the result! I would agree with previous commentary that you should look to make more of the sauce (I wouldn't say double, but definitely increase the amount) because the amount in this recipe was just barely adequate for the amount of wings, and the added bonus being you'll have some left over for dipping.  Wonderful recipe though, was a hit with my dinner guests

These were very good!  I too fried them in the oven.  They were a little sweet so I might cut the sugar back a little next time. We ate every last one....I will definately make these again.

my fiance and i really liked this recipe.  we made it exactly as described but used some extra skin on chicken breasts and drums that we had instead of wings.  i think it would have been better as wings with a higher skin to meat ratio.  it was sweet and tasty.  a real winner!

I really really like these wings.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because if you make them exactly as listed, the sauce is too thin and doesn't stick to the wings well.  It's best to boil the sauce for a bit.  Usually putting it in the microwave for 2-3 minutes works well. 

The taste was great though and I've made this for my family and they love it.  I'm glad you posted this

Wow! Can I give it 10 stars for taste? I added Lowry's Seasoning salt and garlic pepper to the flour, and fried the wings in "I can't believe its not butter". I decreased the sugar in the sauce by 1/3 and added about 2 tsp of sesame oil. I baked them for an hour, basting every 10 minutes and turning them once. For the last 10 minutes, I cranked the heat up to 400 so that they would crisp up. When they were done, I sprinkled them with toasted sesame seeds. They tasted fantastic, just like what a wing place night have, or an entree on an Asian buffet. My reason for giving this only 4 stars is because the coating did not stay on very well. It was already coming off by the second time I basted the wings. Not that it's that big of a deal because the wings were very tender and absorbed the sauce well, but I think I will double flour the wings next time. Can't wait to make again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe and really liked it it was fairly easy to make and it was very quick. The only thing I modified was the amount of sugar I use less than a half a cup of sugar to make it more tangy and not as sweet as the recipe called for. =]

This is a good dish. My family just thought it was missing something. We did add 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil but felt it would most likely taste better if we had added a small can of crushed pineapple to the sauce.  Overall, a good dish.

A keeper.  I also baked mine, coating them in the flour and then garlic powder, salt, and pepper, for 30 minutes at 350° F.  I did give them a spray of cooking spray after coating.  After the initial 30 minutes I poured the sauce over each of the wings, letting it pool on the baking sheet for an extra 30 minutes.  I turned the wings every 10 minutes or so it got more coating as it reduced in the oven.  And they were sticky, lovely and very yummy.  Husband approved!  (I left out the deep frying and the oil and egg.)

These are the absolute best, fabulous wings I've ever eaten.  Even my husband (who doesnt care for wings) ate two plates full!  The only change I made was to omit the egg.  I just floured and fried, then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Except that I did add some sliced scallions just before pouring on the sauce.  Totally fabulous!!!!!!!

I made a lot of these (quadrupled this recipe)and not ONE wing was left an hour after the party! I stuck to the recipe exactly, the only thing I didn't stick to was after I egged and floured them was I deep fried them for 12 minutes at 385 (I know not as healthy). I was writing down the recipe so many times at the party and even received calls for the recipe AFTER the party! This is one of my keepers :)Thank you for a new one to prepare a favorite appetizer.

My family liked it!  It was a bit too sweet for me.  Next time, I'll use brown sugar and skip the white sugar.  I used chicken breasts and baked them.  It was very tender and tasty.  Great with white rice and kimchee!!!!  Will make again.

New rating: Love it.  Only had brown sugar and chicken thighs.  Skipped all the egg/flour frying.  Mixed all ingredients in a deep dish along w/chicken thighs.  Marinated for about an hour then put everything in a large deep pot.  Cooked on stove on LOW setting for a little over an hour.  The chicken just melts right in your mouth.  I did cut out some sugar and used 2 TBS honey.  Threw in some whole pieces of garlic and husband loved it.  Will make again soon.  Double the sauce and drizzle over steamed brown rice with steamed broccoli.  Delish!!!!  3 year old daughter and 10 month old son loved it too.  :P

all i can see is OMG. These are incredible. Even my picky 5 year old gobbled these up and asked for more. Here are the only changes I made to them.
I beat the egg and put the wings in the egg.  I added plenty of flour to coat them and fried them in about 1/3 cup of butter. Just enough to get them brown and not dry out as I fried them.  I made the sauce with 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  I added a a tsp of ground ginger and used ginger flavord soy sauce and added chopped green onions and seasme seeds to the sauce and boiled it to melt the sugar. Pour the sauce over the wings and basted every 10-15 mins. Baked about 55 min and these were PERFECT. I will be making these over and over again!!!!!!!

I read the first three pages of this recipe's reviews. I decided not to fry them - I dipped the wings (frozen) in flour, sprayed them with Pam and then cooked them on 375 for 35 minutes - turned them and cooked for 25 minutes more. I then basted them with the sauce - which I made more of (12 pounds of chicken wings to be exact) and used half of the called for amount.  They cooked for another 20 minutes - half way thru I had my hubby baste them again.  I then broiled them for an additional 5 minutes. I do not eat chicken on the bone but my hubby and the people I served these to loved them. My hubby said that the wings I bought were a little fatty (my fault) but overall they tasted amazing! I will make again!

My family just loves this recipe! They request it all the time. I alter the recipe slightly by using cubed chicken breast, substituting the butter with canola oil, adding a pinch of cayenne pepper powder the the flour and adding crushed red pepper to the sauce.

A friend convinced me to try this recipe.  I don't generally eat chicken wings, but I cut up some chicken breasts into "boneless wing" size, and followed the recipe, only adding about 1 tsp ground ginger for a kick, and sprinkling the chicken with sesame seeds before it went into the oven.  It was FABULOUS.  I loved the tangy flavor and the slight crispy texture from the breading.  Very flavorful, and I will be using this recipe again!

these were a big hit at our NASCAR party. i used drumsticks instead of wings, and kept warm for party serving in a slow cooker set to low. i will definitely make this again, probably again with drumsticks or thighs for dinner.

Did not like the batter on this recipe at all.  It became soggy while baking.  If I were to make this again, I would definately skip the egg/flour part of this recipe.  Otherwise,prepared the recipe exactly.  It tasted great, but the texture of the wings (crispy fried turned soggy) was disappointing.

I didn't like butter when I fried my chicken coz it burnt so fast so I used vegetable oil instead on my second batch of frying. It still worked. I don't think it tasted anything Japanese but I love the outcome so I'm giving it 5 stars. The chickens were so tasty.

I thought these were good but not fabulous.  I did add 1 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper which did make the sauce a little more flavorful and spicy (also reduced sugar to 2/3 cup)  However, they were a little soggy and time-consuming.  Will make again but not often.  It was, however, a good change from buffalo wings!

This is soooooo good. I have tried it both with breading and frying the wings and baking them "naked". I would say I prefer the wings "naked" and it is less time consuming that way. However, I also make this recipe with pounded skinless, boneless chicken breast and I do dredge and fry those and serve over rice with extra sauce. I do reduce the white sugar just a skitch. I never pour all the sauce over the top when baking. I make twice the marinade pour only 1/4 over the top, then I boil the marinade on the stovetop to thicken and then baste often with the syrup. The chicken turns out sticky and incredible. I am not usually a chicken fan but this is my favorite way to prepare it. I also omit the sesame seeds because my husband doesn't like them. Thanks.

This was an excellent recipe.  I was a bit time consuming but well worth the effort.  I forgot to put in the vinegar but it still came out fantastic.  The sauce was thick and finger licking sticky.  I would certainly make this again.

The first time I followed the directions, frying them in butter, but the coating wasn't cripy enough for us and had a buttery flavor which we found odd. Today we fried them in our deep fryer, removing the basket so they didn't get stuck, for 12 minutes, then continued baking and basting as directed.  This is a definite keeper and we will opt to use the deep fryer in the future.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely pleased with the results. The sauce didn't get as thick as I thought it would, but that was fine because I used it on top of the rice I prepared as a side dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe. It's now a permanent part of the family recipe file!

These were good, but I think next time I will cut down on the sugar (as other reviewers have said) and I will double the sauce. Also, I think I should've fried them longer, as they ended up kind of soggy. Overall, pretty good.

This was a very good recipe. This was on the sweet side, so if you don't tend to go for sweet meats this may not be for you. The only changes I made were omitting the salt, doubling the sauce and I used bone in chicken breats. Next time I will use premade frozen breaded chicken fingers ( tyson) and pour the sauce over and bake. Less messy! Good recipe :)

I have been making these for years and they are always requested at family get togethers. I make the sauce with 1/2 the amount called for in this recipe. They are time consumming so I often use the sauce on chicken wings i have roasted. Just drain the fat and add the sauce about 20 min. before they are done....

A real "winner" !! the crunchy chicken and delicious sauce....ummmm! I too added a couple of teaspoons of cayenne pepper and tripled the sauce because we had more chicken wings then recipe called for....On all of my sauces (barbecue etc) I cook in a saucepan and boil down till it gets sticky.....you can do this with bottled sauce...add some catsup and brown sugar or 1/2 ea. of brn and white....I followed this recipe to the "T"...except part of this sauce I cooked down on top of stove and used some for basting... "thank you" Tracy for sharing your recipe .

Excellent!  That is what my husband said yesterday when I asked him what he thought of the Japanese chicken wings.  My kids call them Sticky Chicky!  They take time but honestly these taste the same as what you get at a restaurant.  I will make these again.  By the way I took the advice and made a side of Cucumber Sunoma that you can also find here in Allrecipes.

These turned out really well, nicely baked through. I've used only 1/2 cup sugar, though, as the 1 full cup sounded a bit overwhelming; with 1/2 cup sugar they ended up being quite sweet already.

This is a PHENOMENAL recipe. These Japanese Chicken Wings are the best I ever tasted. I also loved it with cubed chicken breasts.
They were so flavorful, crispy and moist!

The taste is wonderful.  I tried following recipe as is and had problems.  Butter browns too quickly when frying and I had a hard time getting the coating to crisp up.  Next time I will try in the deep fryer to see if there's a difference.  Hubby LOVED the flavor.  If I can get the coating right I can see wowing people with this one!!

My daughter asked me to bring chicken wings to a backyard party for her college friends. She had lots of food, but I made 12 pounds of these wings. Every last one was eaten and everyone was saying they were the best wings they ever had! I was very pleasantly surprised. I followed the recipe exactly except for the fact that I deep fried the wings in half vegetable oil and half canola oil. I know these will now be a favorite party food in our family. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Yummy!  I decided to use sliced chicken breast instead of wings and added a few red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I doubled the sauce recipe so they weren't as sticky and I had to cook them a little longer but they were very flavorful and we had lots of sauce to put over our rice.  My husband says it's his new favorite dish!  Will definatly make again!

These are excellent!  I just re-read the recipe and realized that I forgot to dip in egg and flour, but they turned out great anyway.  The sauce is delicious.  My husband said they were the best he ever had.

OK, this is my second rating of this recipe.  I just couldn't help myself!  Again...I used fresh garlic and most importantly...I used cut-up chicken breasts...this reminded me of general tsao's chicken...I stir-fried some veggies (broccli, carrots, peas, onions, green peppers) in two tablespoons of olive oil, with one table spoon minced garlic, 2 tsp ginger and 5 or 6 tablespoons of soy sauce...I added boiled wholewheat spaghetti when it was done, seasoned with a bit of salt and ate this with my japanese chicken recipe.  (Better than any take out asian food I've ever had!)

These wings were quite a bit of work.. but if you're looking for a good "honey garlic" type wing, then these are for you.  My hubby likes his wings more salty than sweet, and had a hard time getting through sweet and sticky wings... I on the other hand had no problem eating his leftovers ;)

I am sooooo glad I made this for supper tonight!!! The family couldn't stop raving about it! I used boneless chicken breasts instead of wings, cutting them into bite size pieces like sesame chicken. My teenage daughter said she likes this better than any other chicken dish, and then she remarked on how she likes this recipe club! Thanks a bunch Tracy!!

I have made these twice, twice a big hit. Many requests for recipe, I just head them to Allrecipes.com. Garish mine with strips of red, green peppers, carrots and toasted sesame seeds. Will try the garlic idea next time.

Wow!  We absolutely loved this recipe.  There is no doubt that I will be making this again.  I substitued drumsticks for wings since we like those better.  I may try substituting chicken tenderloins next time and baking for a shorter time.  I also used a little less vinegar.  I baked mine on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil, but I should have added another layer of foil for safety sake.  And by all means, do your clean up of the pan immediately.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  By the way, I served this with shieldzini and it was a nice balance of flavors.

These were really good.  I did have trouble frying mine in the butter.  I used all purpose flour but the flour wanted to fluff up on the wings while frying in the butter, so I ended up having to deep fry them to make them crisp and then I put the sauce over the wings.  These are really good:)  Even my picky eater husband ate them:)  Thanks for sharing!:)

We made this with drumsticks because that's what we had and it was DELICIOUS!!! I made the recipe exactly as written (even though I hesistated with all the sugar and vinegar) and even though it smelled very vinegar-y cooking, it turned out really well!!!  I didn't think any particular ingredient was overpowering and I wouldn't change a thing!  I served it with white rice and spooned the extra sauce over the rice!

Really flavorful and already a favorite with the family.  I tried the recipe as is, with the addition of some minced garlic.  If you prefer a little heat, add some red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I would also suggest a shallow cookie sheet with sides and using non-stick foil to make clean-up very easy. Save the juices and and use it to flavor steamed white rice to go with this dish.  I'll be making this again!

Tried out this recipe today, and as per previous reviews, I made this two ways: I took half out after baking for twenty minutes and baked them again on a cooking sheet with no sauce, and I cooked the other half out on a pan with sauce thickened with some cornstarch solution. They both came out really good. I must say that the one simmered with the sauce is a little tastier, but it is really a matter of personal preference. I used chicken drumsticks instead of wings, and they were still good. Will make extra sauce next time.

This was my first attempt at making wings. I was surprised how tasty they were. I had to scale the recipe because I had 4 1/2 lbs. of wings. I still only used 1 cup of sugar because that is what I had and I wasn't sure what splenda would do to them. Also, I had to use cider vinegar(all I had) but I stuck with the 1/2 cup instead of upping it to 3/4 like it said to after I scaled it because some reviewers said it was vinegary. Time consuming because I had to fry them in batches but definately worth it. I do not like spicy wings so this is a super alternative. Will definately be making again.

We loved the texture of these wings but it was important to brown the egg/flour coating well.  I reduced the amount of vinegar to about 1/4 cup.  I have used this recipe for two potlucks so far, and it was a popular dish each time!

I took these wings to a potluck with 30 people and they were a big hit! I made two big pans of them and they were gone in no time. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone. I have an 18 month old baby and I can only do things while he is sleeping. So while he was down for a nap I breaded and fried the whole batch and put them in the fridge. The next day I layed them out on two big pans and I tripled the sauce recipe and poured it over the wings. There was extra sauce but I still poured the rest over the wings and by the time I got to the party they were still warm and the sauce had thickened which made them extra tasty and sticky! Isn't that what makes a good wing! We like our wings saucey. Just do what works for you. Thanks Tracy for our new favorite wing recipe!

Awesome wings, my picky 17 year old daughter went back for seconds.  Substituted the white sugar for Karo brown-sugar syrup and used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  We'll definitely make these again.  Cut salt in 1/2 and fried in 1/2 butter 1/2 veggie oil

Superb!
I browned the wings in half butter; half vegetable shortening.
I also added a few tablespoons of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up and then poured it over the wings and let them marinate a bit.
Incredibly easy and awesome!  Very tender and juicy wings.
Thanks!

This recipe is excellent! I made it exactly as described for Christmas Eve dinner and my family was oohing and ahhing over it! 

It did take a little bit of time to make, but next time I'll use two eggs and will toss all of the wings in the egg at once.  That should cut down on time. 

I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

my husband is real finicky when it comes to new food. i tried this one because it involved butter ! how can u go wrong with frying chicken in butter... i waited to see his reaction and to my surprise it was a POSITIVE one. he ate it all!!! it was a bit time consuming to fry but was worth the effort. next time i will just use a bigger pot with a lb. of butter.  thanks for the recipe. a keeper !!!!!!!!!

This was great especially since the two picky eaters in my house ate them.  I did let them sit awhile after taking them out of the oven for the sauce to thicken a little and adhere to the wings.

These were tasty! Be careful not to overbake and check on them often. I think frying them with the butter before baking them makes them taste really good.

I used this sauce (with the addition of a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds) to top broiled chicken legs which were marinated overnight in pineapple juice, minced garlic and soy sauce.  Delicious as a dipping sauce, too.  Won't ever buy the expensive bottled version again.... Thanks!

Fabulous recipe!  I only used half of the butter to brown the meat.  My family loved the sauce so much I made it again, but used boneless, skinless chicken breasts to cut down on the fat.  I also used the sauce with pork chops (pounded thin) and it was good too.

my family liked this very much.  I thought it was pretty good too, but can't go 5 stars.  I did cut down on the sugar to 1/2 cup and I also added some fresh finely grated ginger (about a tablespoon) to the vinegar mixture.  I would recommend omitting the water if you're going to be cutting back the sugar, as my sauce came out a little thin.

I made this recipe with 1/3rd of the wings and I didn't have a shallow roasting pan. They still came out good! I had to make more of the sauce since I thought I could 3rd everything and I baked them in a glass dish lined with foil. 
Only thing that kept it from being a 5 star was the flavor. It was good but 5's are for things that knock my socks off. Maybe something added for a brighter color like brown sugar or something that would add zip to an already great sauce.

Although I was already expecting this to taste great, this was, by far, much better than I was hoping for! I used fresh garlic, chicken breasts cut into smaller (wing-sized) portions, and red wine vinegar (because I ran out of white). This is one to add to the favorites!

I love this recipe!!! I used less butter and added sesame oil while cooking the chicken on the stove top. And for the sauce I used some sesame oil in place of the water and some minced garlic. I also changed the sugar amount to 3/4 cup.  I will definitely make this again. I will try this as a marinade with sliced up chicken breasts and put over salad. Great recipe!!!

Delicious and simple to make!  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I substituted butter for corn oil, used 3/4 of the sugar, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and added sesame seeds.  I left out the water in order to make the sauce thicker.  I also kept the chicken in the oven for a full 45 minutes.  Overall, a yummy recipe!

Excellent - took advice from others and added some canola oil to butter so it wouldn't burn, and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup - absolutely delicious!

Too sweet. I was apprehensive about using that much sugar into it. My BF liked them though. I probably won't be making these again. If I do, I will use brown sugar instead.

Excellent recipe!  They were so tasty and easy to make.  I put 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and they were still pretty sweet.  I didn't use the recommended 1 cup butter, just 2-3 tablespoons.  I also put in some minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder.  The turn out of the sauce had a nice glaze to it.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My family and neighbors loved this Japanese chicken.  I am not the best cook in the world but, I am able to follow instructions. It was very easy.  I was very suprised at how good the chicken was.  This will be a family favorite that we will enjoy for many years.

I don't care that much for chicken so I'm always looking for different ways to fix it. This is one of the best ways I've found yet! I really liked the egg dipped batter and the twangy taste that the vinegar and soy sause gave it.  I'll make this one again!I did use half as much sugar (1/2)cup and it was still plenty sweet.  I also used a mixture of brown sugar and white sugar. I used tin foil to line the pan for easy cleanup.

This was really good. I also made with chicken breast cubes and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and served on steamed white rice. My kids thought it was the best sesame chicken. We had no left over. I did decrease the sugar a bit.

My husband asks, "why can't we vote for a 6?" lol.. these were AWESOME! I used chicken drummettes in a foil-lined sprayed 9X13 baking pan. The thing is though, I doubled the sauce recipe and therefore, when the chicken was put in the oven, they were drenched 4/5 of the way so all I had to do was turn them over once instead of "basting" over and over. These were so good! Yum, yum, yum!! *thumbs up*

Very unique and tasty.  We learned that it is extremely important to use a good quality chicken.  That makes a huge difference in the taste, texture and appearance.

I made these with legs since my market didn't have any wings, and I also used a veg/sesame oil mix to fry the legs in rather than the butter and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch. My family enjoyed these, but my husband said that they smelled better than they tasted.  I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet enough.  I may try these again with breasts or wings and see if we like them better with white meat.  This is a good occaisional dish since it has so much sugar, but it was nice to do something different with chicken.  Thanks!

I thought this was awesome - my husband and even my picky 3 year-old thought it was great. I followed the recipe but I thought there was too much sugar.  Remember to use foil - I prefer to use Reynolds’s release foil for this type of recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was a hit.  We love the sweet taste.  I fried the first batch of wings in butter but I didn't like the way they turned out.  I fried a second batch in a couple of tablespoons of oil and they turned out perfect (and less fattening)!  Overall, excellent recipe.

This was unbelievably delicious.  The only change I made was adding minced garlic and minced ginger to the egg and seasoned the flour with salt and pepper.  Could not believe how delicious this was.  Wish I had listened more carefully to the other review and used foil though on my pan AARRGGH!!  Spraying pan first w/ Pam just does not help!

The recipe was OK but rather sweet. My chicken pieces also went very much like 'toffee' on top (chewy and quite sticky) but perhaps that was due to it being cooked under top heat as well as fan forced.

These are absolutely wonderful Tracy.  I made these for us when we watched the game last night and my husband was very impressed with the taste of the sauce.  It tasted just like the sauce they use at our favorite place to eat.  They were a little sticky, so just make sure to have a lot of napkins on hand.  If I could rate this higher, I would!

I will definitely make these again! The only thing I  did different, because if you look at the fat content you will have a coronary, is use a non stick pan and butter flavor Pam cooking spray instead of all the butter.

These are awesome!!!  I'm not big on oriental cuisine, but whoa!  These reminded me a lot of General Tso's chicken, sort of a cross between teryiaki and sweet and sour.  I used 4 lbs of wings, and there was still plenty of sauce to go around.  The only change I did make to the sauce was leaving out the salt(soy sauce tends to be really salty) and doubling the garlic powder.  Thanks so much, Tracy, for sharing this recipe that even my picky 5 year old told me I could make everyday!

This recipe was excellent! My husband, always a skeptic, absolutely loved it. He had to force himself to stop eating them, so that he could take some to work for lunch the next day. My only complaint is that it is a very fattening recipe, but if you don't do it often (just as a treat) it is not that bad. It just can't be a weekly occurence. I paired it with potatoes and broccoli in a cheese sauce. Wonderful meal!

I was skeptical about this recipe at first. After I started to make it, I was skeptical making the sauce with all the sugar that wouldn't dissolve and the strong-smelling vinegar. This is what I have to say: Try it. I loved it. The sugar doesn't need to fully dissolve and don't worry if you don't like vinegar. The taste is awesome! This is my favorite chicken recipe thus far. I recommend it even to the skeptical.

I made this recipe as written the first time and it was great.  The second time I added corn starch and a tsp of cayenne to the sauce,poured over cubed chicken thighs and cooked at 350 for 35 min.  At that point I added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and cooked 10 minutes longer.  This was perfect served over steamed rice and my family requests this often!

The sauce is delicious, but extremely thin.  I will have to experiment with cornstarch or flour to thicken it.

These wings were the BEST I have ever had.  Could even make with chicken legs instead of wings...  Very Yummy!  This is one you will pass on to your friends and family!

Absolutely the best wings ever!!  Wonderful when hot, and if you take them out of the sauce while they are cooling so they don't get soggy they are just as good cold.  However, it's hard to have any left over to eat cold cause they get scarfed up so fast.

Nice & easy recipe, be sure to eat them quick though or they get kind of 'goopy' as they get cold. Would make them again, my kids really enjoyed them.

These wings are delicious.  I have made them twice already.  You will want to make a lot of them!  They're great for parties too.  A little messy, but worth it.  Worth the effort!

Make these often...important note . The sugar and soy are EXTREMELY hard to wash off your pans so use a no  stick or two layers of tin foil. Anyway. These wings are to die for !! 5 stars all the way

Have tried both the unaltered recipe (crazy good) and the oven fried version, spritzing butter spray on both sides. Also very good and much less standing over the stove. Just BE SURE to use silicone on your baking sheet or it will end up a mess, though still good, just with half of it stuck on the tin foil or backing sheet. It is my go-to dish whenever I want to put other folk’s chicken wing recipes to shame ??

I pretty much followed the recipe ingredients exactly but cut the sugar down by one forth (not to one fourth) just down a quarter ( any more and you would not get the syrupy glaze) and the were still very good.  I will certainly make these again.  I made them as appetizers only, I probably would not make a meal out of them, too rich but two or three of them are a treat!

My husband loved this recipe. Said the chicken tasted like crack. (compliment). Definitely going to do this one again. I used regular size chicken legs and followed the directions. We were very please with the outcome.

I always change recipes...always. Largely because I read the reviews first. I was lazy about using the egg. I always have a flour mix on hand that I use regularly  (1/2 c flour, 1/4 tsp ea of paprika, cayenne, & salt). I used that on 7 large wings, halved. I used 1/2 a stick of butter and veg.oil. I used 1/2 c sugar & 1/3 c of vinegar. The rest remained unchanged. I lined a glass pan with foil & flipped the wings about 4 times during the 45 minute bake time. I think I fried my wings about 15 minutes. They didn't come out crispy how I did it, but my husband LOVED them.

I don't eat chicken wings but, I added a bit of honey to the mix and topped off the wings with some sesame seeds. Also if you want a bit of spice added a few red pepper flakes to half of the wings mixture. Everyone seemed to enjoy these. No leftovers!

Holy Mother of God are these amazing. We oven baked them and used apple cider vinegar instead of the white and they turned out AMAZING!  We made these for the Superbowl and made them again the next day because we cant get enough. We used a basting brush to put the sauce on and used it all. Depending on how messy you feel like being, I would even recommend making more sauce for dipping.

Made as written, just added red pepper flakes. This is an excellent recipe, made vegetable rice (from this site) Someone ask  why Japanese was in the title (Japanese use a lot of soy sauce in their cooking) Very tasty, this recipe is a keeper!!

This was great!!  I made it and took the advice of a few people who made some changes.  I am sure cooking the wings in butter will make it taste great, but I wanted to cut out some of the fat so I baked mine in the oven with just the flour coating and a spray of veggie oil. I  I also used brown sugar instead of white and they tasted fantastic.  Make sure you pat dry the wings before coating with flour.  (if you have some patience, try and pull some of the skin off of the wings to cut out even more fat. ) Will make again soon!!!!

Big hit in my house! Sauce is sweet and salty! I used thigh and breast cut into nuggets and it turned out amazing! Served on a bed of white rice. Can't wait to make it again! The sauce can get quite sticky in the pan so I definitely recommend lining your pan with tin foil.

Came out really great. I flipped them half way through baking and turned the broiler on for about a minute, minute and a half at the end. Also  added a little pepper to the sauce.

These were the best wings I've ever had. Super easy, too. Browning the wings in butter is what sets this recipe apart. You can taste the butter even after baking in the sauce. I'll definitely make extra next time.

Easy peasy. Subbed agave for sugar, and used 3 tbsp. Was too much. Used whole wheat flour. Turned out great.

Good, but I expect that "oven frying" isn't as good as properly fried.

3 Tab of soysauce certainly doesn't cut it.  These have no flavor, and were time consuming., which I wouldn't mind, if they had been great.

These wings were a hit at last weekend's party!  The only think I think I would do is to add some cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. Otherwise, they were awesome wings!

As with others I felt a bit of reluctance with using sugar on something I enjoy as a savory dish. To my surprise this was absolutely amazing, the sweet sticky texture was a delight from the usual spicy hot I enjoy. Sure, I see myselve adding some heat to the recipe, however this is awesome on it's own, as is thanks a bunch!

I read a lot of reviews from people that said they changed different things with this recipe and I started to make a lot of those same changes. Boy, I'm glad I didn't listen to those reviews!!
I made these wings exactly as directed and my family and I agree that this is the best dish we have eaten in a long time, period!
Don't change a THING!

The wings were so good! I did not dip them in eggs and fry in the pan because I had no eggs at the time. I did what others said and used Pam to baked them. They still were delicious! The sauce does get sticky, I made sure I lined my pan with foil. My husband loved them! They were so easy to make. I will make them again!

The flavor of this recipe is excellent!  I did not fry the wings but baked them as other reviews recommended, and they were incredible!  I have a picky hubby that works at an internationally recognized restaurant, and he LOVED this recipe.  Definitely a keeper, and I'm thinking of other ways to use the sauce....

Great recipe and super easy to make. I will add some heat next time. Oven-fried at 400 degrees and then basted the wings consistently with the sauce. Family loved it for our NYE dinner.

So tasty!! I didn’t fry them in butter. I instead coated them as the recipe says then put them on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper. Melts butter and brushed them generously. Put them in the oven at 425 for 15 mins. Took them out flipped and brushed the other side with butter put them back in for another 15. Then put the sauce on them and back in the oven at 350 for 15 mins and repeat with other side. Perfect!!!

Amazing chicken wings! I used rice wine vinegar instead of white, added about 2 tbsps of honey, 1 tbsp of sesame seeds, and 2 tbsps of minced garlic to the sauce, and put paprika, ginger, and mustard powder in the breading. My boyfriend said that these were the best wings he’s ever had. Will definitely make again.

OMG! this recipe is really good. I tried it as written and it did not fail me. I ran out of vinegar and didn't know which vinegar to substitute with so I did half acv and half rice vinegar lol. It was not too sweet as people mentioned. I think if you try the exact recipe with no changes then it will turn out the way it was intended to. thanks for this delicious recipe. my four year old asked to taste it and asked for two pieces. that's huge for her since she doesn't eat chicken unless it's a nugget lol.

These wings are just fantastic!  Great alternative to hot wings.  I made as written the first time, then after that, played around a bit.  I am rating on the original recipe.  My variation is not drastically different.  I don't like to fry, I like to eat it, but not make it!  So I did as some others and oven fried.  Placed the sauce on and baked about 25 mins more.  The only thing I do different to the sauce is add red pepper flakes.  Sweet and spicy, can't go wrong!  Thanks for the great recipe!

                                      UPDATE:  second batch today I used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the sauce...YUM!

Perfect.  The only change was I baked them not fried.  I kept everything else the same.  Perfect tasty wings.  Not too sweet like others have said.

I loved it so much, I did change the cup of sugar to a half a cup of sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar. I also added pepper jelly to my sauce, and a little bit of baking powder when i fried the chicken to make it more crispy. I also didn't cook it at 350, instead i cooked it at 450 for the same amount of time but maybe 10 min more after you add more sauce to the wings.

Nice sweet wings, and very easy to make.  I prefer dry wings, but this was a close second.  I will make them again, come football season.

People ask me to make this at least once a month.  Instead of using bone-in chicken wings, I fry up chicken breast pieces in the batter and then put it all in the crock pot with the sauce.  I stir the chicken and sauce a few times, and it's ready in under an hour without the hassle of pulling out the chicken to baste it every few minutes.  The chicken is sticky and yummy and works great over veggies and jasmine rice.

I loved these wings. I made no changes. I'm glad I left it the same because these are the best wings I have ever had. My family loved them too! The sauce is full of flavor. It was tangy and sweet at the same time. I served these with an Asian noodle side dish. I loved every bite. I will definitely make these again.

It all went together just as simply as it appeared it would. I did pan fry them first in oil before adding sauce and baking. Easy to follow recipe with an excellent result of tasty wings. All four around the table ate quietly and heartily.

Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly with the exception that had to use a little extra flour as I had some very meaty wings! After frying I cooked them in the roasting pan, basting them every 5 minutes and turning them once. I found 40 minutes was a good cooking time. They tasted amazing. Sticky and sweet with the slightest hint of tangy!   

I'll definitely be making this again!!! Delicious!

This was really good. I followed the review by CatlovesD for oven frying. I used 6 legs because that's what I had. Cooked 35 mins then covered with sauce, turned them over and cooked another 30 mins.

This was terrific!! I tossed the chicken wings in olive oil, seasoned w salt & pepper, a bit of paprika & garlic powder, as another reviewer suggested. Baked on a broiling pan @ 350 for 35 min., flipped, re-seasoned & baked for another 25min. Put chicken in a baking dish & poured the sauce (halves the sugar in sauce) on top, then used a baster to make sure chic was coated & baked for another 25 min. Will make this again & again!!

*Did again...baked drumsticks on a foil lined rack at 425 convection for 25 min & then transferred to baking dish & poured sauce on top. Finished baking at 400 convention for 10-15min

These wings turned out excellent! Definitely use aluminum foil as it gets very sticky with all the sugar. They are a bit crispy with a little sweet and salty on top of it. Loved them.

This was the best recipe for chicken wings I have ever had.
I didn't make any changes at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I will definitely make it again.
My daughter said they were better than any she has had in a restaurant.

I LOVE these wings!  I've never really been able to make wings at home that I loved, but these definitely hit the spot.  My husband begs me to cook them all the time!  They're definitely not healthy, being fried in butter and all, but they are full of flavor and the crispy texture is amazing.  I love the glaze, and definitely recommend basting every so often.

Overall good, but other than being sweet not much of a seasoned taste.  I would season chicken with more garlic and salt, but less sugar.

Quite delicious wings. Takes some effort but very easy to make.
However, this recipe is too sweet for me. I think kids might like it this way, but I would prefer it way less sweeter.

Here are some things I would change next time.

1. Use 1/2 cup of sugar
2. 2 tablespoons of water
3. 1 tablespoon of garlic power in the flour
4. 1 tablespoon of fine black pepper in the flour.

The wings were way better with "Pure Louisiana Crystal Extra Hot" hot sauce.

Made it two ways. By the recipesea and then skipped the fry added a little paprika and truffle oil and baked in oven with temp elevated to 400 last 15 min. The outcomes were very similar. The wings really don't crisp. They tasted very much the same because of the sugar glaze. I only used half cup in each. I thought they were very tasty. But my wife disliked the sugar even before she tried it and only wants spicy wings.  So this is a tail of two tastes. Now what you and your guests are looking for. Like many I also generally don'like all the fat. But I agree with the fellow who suggested to eat salad in that case.

Made these twice already.... they were a hit both times. Everybody raved about them and were the first to disappear from the rest of the food lol!! The only thing I do different is add a bit of cayenne to the flour mix for a little heat..

Extremely Sweet and savory!  Well worth the work put into them.  These are now my wife's   favorite  wings to eat. Add chili flakes or  a hot sauce  for a kick. Otherwise  these wings are fantastic  just the way they are. One suggestion for cutting down on all that sugar  would be to omit  half the sugar from the recipe. For those worried about  too much sugar.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them. I like to do as much in advance as possible when I entertain. The morning of the party I prepared them as directed except after dipping in egg and the flour mixture I placed the chicken wings on cookie racks sprayed with Pam and placed them in the fridge on trays. I also use this method with buffalo wings, the breading stays  on the chicken better when it  sits for a few hours. I also prepared the sauce in advance and put it in the fridge. An hour before my guests were to arrive I fried the wings, placed them in the roasting pan, poured the sauce over and put them in the oven.

These Japanese wings were very good.  My end results was a nice presentation just like the photograph. I will add this recipe to my kitchen recipe list. The wings are so easy to cook.

Very tasty recipe. I oven baked wings first on 350 degrees for about hour and half until crispy turning once. Then poured sauce over them and continued baking at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. Only changes in sauce I made was added a splash or so of orange juice and reduced sugar to only 1/2 cup. Definitely will make again.

I reviewed other reviews for this chicken wing. Definitely placed less sugar in the sauce. I probably should've added more soy sauce or salt and I could have used a little hot pepper but definitely my girlfriend loved it and she's very picky with her food. This recipe is awesome. Definitely add your own taste to it.

The wings tasted good. I took the advice of others and oven fried the chicken instead of frying in butter. I also used 1/2 of the sugar.  Next time I'll season the wings more.

I have made this twice because the wings were so delicious the first time !  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I used cider vinegar instead white. And I fried the wings in oil  instead of butter.

I also followed the reviews and I did not fry these wings.  Instead, I sprayed the wings with Pam and floured them.  I broiled for 10 to 15 minutes on each side after seasoning with paprika.  When I prepared the sauce, I added less sugar. The wings turned out quite tasty, but a bit light on the flavor.  Next time, I plan to add a little more soy sauce for more flavoring.

It smells wonderful but, the taste is bland. Very bland, too bland. If you do this please do yourself a favor and season the flour. Even the skin can't cover how bland it is. It's just oh dead goodness bland. Throw some salt and pepper in the  flour along with other spices.

I would cut the sugar down, it was too sweet in my opinion but my family loved it. Next time I make this  I would just bake it instead of frying then baking.

When trying this for the first time I knew one of my guests was not a fan of buffalo and super sweet wing sauce.  I halved the sugar while keeping the other ingredients the same.  I also simmered the sauce for about 30 min instead of baking it with them.  Baking the wings naked at 300 for 2 hours and broiling them at the end allowed the fat under the skin to cook away with a nice crispy exterior.  Tossed the wings in with the sauce and voila.  Within 20 min all of them were eaten and half of the wings I did buffalo style hadn't been touched.  Thankfully my friend got her share and loved it.  Great Recipe!!!!
One last thing... I sprinkled some sesame seeds over the finished product.  Didn't alter the taste too much but it did make them much more presentable.

As another reviewer suggested, I oven fried the wings and then poured off the fat. Other than that I made it exactly as directed and the wings came out with a nice sweet sticky bark, and were delicious. They are pretty sweet, but we prefer wings sweet rather than hot. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! Can't wait to make it again for friends.

I followed aegibear's suggestion #2. I guess it really makes it a different recipe but the flavor is the same. Loved how gooey and delicious they turned out. Even with 1/2 sugar I thought they were a little sweet though. (all personal preference of course!) I did the egg and flour and baked for the 25 minutes @400, added sauce and baked 30 minutes @350. About to make them again and will cut back even a little more on the sugar. Thanks!!

Dish was delicious and enjoyed by everyone.  After reading the reviews I did cut back on the sugar and made my sauce to taste.  I basted every 10 minutes but then when the wings were almost finished I poured the sauce into a saucepan and cooked it till it thickened up really nicely, then spooned it back over my completed wings.  Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely.  Will definitely be making these again. Yum!

I used Peanut oil instead of butter, added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the flour and 2 teaspoons to the water to help thicken sauce, also  subbed part of the sugar with coconut palm sugar.  It was excellent.   I will make this again, but  will try to oven fry, using coconut oil.

We loved these but like others, I made some changes to the recipe. I used the sauce ingredients exactly as listed except I cut the sugar in half. I skipped the frying step. I sprinkled the wings with garlic powder then roasted at 375 for 25 mins skin side up, then turned over and roasted 25 mins more.  I poured sauce over wings, roasted 15 minutes then turned and roasted 15 minutes more. I then transfered the wings to a rimmed, foil covered baking sheet and poured about 1/3 of sauce over the wings. I broiled for 3 minutes then turned and broiled for 2 more minutes. I was searching for a crispy skin and thickened sauce but it never happened. Even without the crispiness, both my husband and I thought these wings were really yummy. Will make again, for sure.UPDATE: I made these again but used 3/4 c. sugar. The sauce did caramelize under the broiler pretty quickly so I cut the broiling time to 2 mins per side. The wings still were not crispy but they were very yummy.

These were good but not worth the effort of making the wings from scratch. Although the recipe itself is easy, cutting chicken wings was not as fun and kind of made me wonder why I was bothering with this. But alas I did make them and they were pretty tasty. These were super sweet and the sauce is sooo thin that you have to baste the wings every 10 mins or so. I had doubled the sauce recipe because I wanted  it for  6 chicken drumsticks I was also making. But I had so much leftover that I image the original quantity would've been enough for the 3 lbs wings and 6 drumsticks with still some leftover. Also I lined the baking sheets with foil which was smart because even with that the sauce got through to the pan and was annoying to clean up. I also followed the first reviewers recommendation of oven frying them- minus the egg. Glad I did that. Deep frying them wasn't worth the extra fat. Anyways, I enjoyed this but not enough to make them again.

I made this for a holiday party, and a few finicky members of my family refused to touch it because it was called "Japanese wings". Not because they were Japanese, but because they were afraid to try something different. Other party goers raved the wings so the finicky members tried it...and loved it! Now i am requested to bring these wings to every family gathering...mostly by the finicky family members.

This recipe was a hit with my family. Like others, I made a few tweaks (hence the 4 star rating). I opted to fry the wings as directed, but used canola oil instead of butter. I also seasoned the wings and dredged them in flour (omitting the egg). 

For the glaze, I used rice vinegar and halved the sugar . I also added grated fresh ginger and freshly minced garlic. The sauce was amazing!
I placed the wings on a rack in the oven to avoid the soggy bottom and basted them with the sauce (turning them over half way and basted the other side). Since the sauce was a bit thin, I whisked in some corn starch mixed with water to thicken it. I used the thicker sauce and gave the wings one final basting under the broiler to make them a bit stickier. It was delicious!! We used the extra sauce for dipping and on some salmon the next day.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I "fried" it in an Actifry.  It turned out great!  It should be served immediately after cooking to preserve the lovely mix of crunch and sauce.

Followed other user advice and dredged the wings in flour, salt, and pepper, then sprayed with Pam and baked on a broiler pan at 400 for 20 minutes on each side.  I would recommend using aluminum foil underneath for easy cleanup.  I replaced the sugar with 1/3 - 1/2 C. Honey and added 1/2 tsp each of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to add some spice.  Then dipped the wings in the sauce and broiled for 5-10 minutes on each side.  Meanwhile, heated the remaining sauce and added a little corn starch mixed with water to thicken. Once the wings were done, I tossed in the remaining sauce and they were delicious.  Next time I'll try without the flour to make them a little healthier-- they didn't seem to need the breading.  Would also consider sprinkling with sesame seeds and/or shallots.  Definitely keeping this recipe!

This recipe is great exactly how it's written. I've made this dozens of times over the years. The chicken wings are meant to be fried in butter. It gives the savouriness. They are not supposed to be oven baked. Chicken wings are mostly fat and are not health food. The frying with egg and flour gives them the outside sticky gooey texture they are supposed to have. They are not supposed to be crispy like a hot wing tossed in sauce. They are also supposed to be sweet. Don't cut down the sugar. This is in all likelihood anything like an authentic Japanese dish. It's kind of like Western Chinese food. Developed in the Americas to be what it is. Anyone wanting to make so many changes to the recipe should probably write there own. Try this as it is written. Most won't be disappointed.

This recipe was certainly a hit with our guests although most agreed a little heat from some diced ginger or chilies would be a great addition for my next attempt. Still a great option when you are looking for sweet without heat.

This chicken is soooooooooo good and tastes better the next day and the day after that and the day after that. But must day i did make a few changes to the recipe. Since the vinegar is so strong i added few table spoons to just to balance it out and i baked them at 400 instead

Good recipe if you like sweet wings, and I'm giving it 4 stars because apparently a lot of people like sweet wings. Made this with a few minor changes including more soy sauce, less sugar and about 1 tap of crushed red pepper for some kick. They were a hit with our company. I thought they were tasty but too sweet. Personally, I'm more of a frank's red-hot buffalo wing type of girl ;)

I love this recipe it is a great hit  every time.  However I salt and pepper the chicken before dipping it in the egg.  I also put a ton of real garlic in the soy sauce sugar water mixture.  A little Tabasco doesn't hurt either

OMG, I tried these tonight and my family fell in love with these.  I will be making them again soon.  They could not get enough of these.  I followed the recipe as is and they turned out great. We had them with green beans and rice.

I think next time I'll use oil instead of butter or oven fry the wings as mine had a buttery taste that  almost overpowered the flavor of the sauce.. Other than that, the wings were fantastic. I added sesame oil and curry paste and ginger powder to the sauce and ginger powder and pepper to the flour.. This gave the wing a more authentic Oriental flavor through the butteriness.. Definitely a go to, but I highly recommend oven frying.

This was a little too sweet for my taste.  I seasoned the wings with salt,  pepper and Chesepake Bay style seasoning and baked for 30 mins at 350.  I poured the glaze over the wings and returned them to the oven for another 30 minutes - basting them again halfway through cooking.  The wings turned out great - just a little too sweet.  Next time I will substitute paprika for the Chesapeake Bay seasoning and cut down on the sugar.  Possibly even add some red pepper flakes.

Delicious!  I did modify the recipe a little to make it a tad bit healthier for my family.  I used vegetable oil to fry the wings, but added 1 stick of butter to the oil.  The wings fried up crispy, browned and beautiful!
I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, and cut the vinegar by half using water to make up the difference.   3 T soy sauce with cut to 2 1/2 T.
They turned out so good not a single one was left over!  I'll definitely use this recipe again!

The sauce was good! I made it exactly like the recipe. While it wasn't thick, it was still very sticky and yummy. Because of all of the mixed reviews, I made it 2 ways. I made a pan just as the recipe says and a pan as suggested by some to fry it in the oven. My preference after tasting both, was baked/fried in the oven. I love love love fried foods but as it is in the recipe, the chicken did taste too much like butter (I only used 1 stick) and the breading was actually soggy once it was done. Looked crunchy but the skin fell right off the chicken and was too soft. After 1 piece I was turned off.  Now for the oven fried version, I omitted the egg as suggested. I baked at 400 for 40 minutes , flipping it half way at 20 minutes. I then poured the same sauce on it and put it back in the oven for an additional 30 minutes at 350. These wings were much better and a lot less soggy. I will make them again, all fried in the oven without the egg. The sauce as is was great! It's not a thick bbq sauce, it's more of a loose sticky sauce. All of the chicken was baked uncovered.

Very good!  And that advice to use the flour after seasoning then spraying with the Pam spray was the best idea! Who ever thought of that got a thumbs up from me.  But this is definitely a keeper and not too salty! Good Job!

Made these tonight and like many other reviewers, I lightly coated the wings with olive oil, mixed Lawry's seasoning salt with salt and pepper to taste then sprinkled all over. First round in oven I baked for 45 mins @ 400 degrees, flipping them once halfway through. Made the sauce as directed and added a tbs cornstarch. Tossed chicken in sauce and put back in oven for second round another 40 minutes, basting and flipping once 20 minutes in. The sauce thickens as you cool and baste. Didn't flour or fry. These wings were deelish! And sticky!! Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I baked the wings for about 30 minutes before adding the sauce.  I continued to bake the wings for another 25-30 minutes.  They were delicious.  This recipe will be in my normal rotation.

Oh my ...delicious! I wish I could have done more than six wings but I'm going to do this recipe again with drumettes. Follow the recipe and make sure you base your wings every chance you get in a shallow dish so each chicken can be extra coat it with delicious and sticky sauce. My man licked his fingers then lick me too. LOL

Tastes really good, tho I followed another reviewer's tip and oven fried them, then added sauce, but I did leave it in there quite a while to try to get some glaze.  So next time I will add the sauce to a pan with the oven-fried wings to get a reduction faster.  Or, reduce the sauce by it self while the wings fry, then add them to the wings and leave another 10 minutes in the oven... Idk...

Delicious! I wasn't sure if it would taste good when I tried the sauce after mixing those ingredients. But... It did!!! Cooking it on the chicken gives it a completely different taste.

I've now made these wings a few times and each time they come out amazing! I've taken the advice of other reviewers and I do not fry mine, I bake them. First I sprinkle seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper on both sides, then shake them in flour and spray Pam on them. I set them in the oven at 400 for 30 mins, then pour the sauce over and put them back in and baste every ten mins for another 30. I then take the left over sauce from the baking dishes and thicken it in a saucepan with some cornstarch. When it's thickened to my preference I toss the wings in the sauce and serve! They turn out sooo saucy and delicious! Everyone loves them!

I use chicken breast cut into pieces for this recipe as I'm not a wing fan. I use thick soy sauce and half brown sugar half white sugar or the sauce which I think makes the sauce taste better. I also lightly fry chopped onion and add that to the chicken.

I really like the way the chicken wings came out! The sauce was so good!! I used a lot less sugar for the sauce because 1 cup just seemed like a lot. They were very good. I think that was the best chicken I've ever made. My 6 year-old son loved them too! Thank you!

These chicken wings are amazing! I followed the recipe and had to improvise a bit with the amounts because of the number of wings I had. They came out beautifully.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes on Allrecipes.  We also tried varying or adding some other ingredients, but it came out best for us just the way it's written here.  Personally, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought maybe heating the sauce in a saucepan on top right f the stove & then adding it to the chicken to put in the oven but I loved it! Im a New Yorker living in the south & can't find the right taste of Chinese in any of the restaurants down here & I love Chinese so this was a relief once they came out. My husband loved them & my 1 year old son who is a picky eater actually ate dinner that night but anytime I cook Chinese he eats (I guess he gets it from his mommy) But 5 stars for me I Love love LOVE

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have white vinegar so I used Apple cider vinegar and it still turned out delicious.

I loved this one! We wound up actually putting our wings in a fryer instead of just frying them in a pan. We also added more soy sauce to combat the sweetness. Very very tasty! We tore them up!

OMG.....just made this recipe and loved it! I didn't use egg, flour or fry. Like other I baked them and added my own seasoning to the chicken. (sea salt, pepper, adobo, onion powder and paprika) Also only used 1/2 cup of sugar though. Great change of pace for the chicken wing. Will make again very soon.

The idea was great and it sounded awesome, but I found it far too sweet. I couldn't finish my serving because I couldn't handle it. I was disappointed because I was really excited about this recipe.

This is so simple I had all ingredients at hand and it has become one of my husbands favorite dishes. He is always asking for the Japanese wings I think frying them in butter is a must!

I liked the wings but they were rather sweet. I thought that would be the case because of the amount of sugar. Next time I make these I will either add an extra pinch of salt or cut down the sugar. Only problem with that though is the sauce won't get as thick.

Look no further for a recipe for chicken wings! I was a little nervous about pouring the water consistency sauce over my fried wings but towards the end of baking, it puts a nice glaze over the wings. Comes out perfect!

This recipe was delicious. Only thing I did differently was seasoned the chicken with garlic powder before flouring and  frying. That helped balance out the sweetness of the sauce.  I also fried the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. My kids loved this chicken and it will be in dinner rotation regularly.

Delicious. I didn't fry the wings either - I just broiled them w/salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder.  I loved the sauce and didn't alter at all. My kids loved them!! Thanks!

I tried this recipe on Thanksgiving and it was a hit! No wings left over! But they were sort of sweet so not so good of idea to make for a meal but a good appetizer. But overall a great recipe.

I did not use an egg but used my own seasoning with the flour. I used paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and seasoning salt. I baked the chicken at 425 for about 15 minutes and then added the sauce for the last 20 minuted. The sauce was a great touch and will recommend this recipe to all of my friends!

This is a great recipe, made it this sunday for football wirh the neighbors and used chicken legs.  instead of pan frying, I oven fried by rubbing them in olive oil and then floured them 20min on 400 and then flipped them for another 20min to get both sides crispy.  Then moved them to a 9x13 glass pan and added the sauce and turned the heat down to 350 and baked them for another 45min.  Then turned up to 425 for 7min.  Best chicken with this asian style that i have ever had!

YUM!! Super tasty..a little sweet with delicious Asian flavors. I followed Aegibear's suggestion--Breaded with egg & flour and baked @ 400 for 25 min (flip once) then added sauce and baked for another 30 minutes. The sauce is a little on the liquidy side so I took a brush and resauced the wings at the end.

The sauce is OUTSTANDING!!!! I just added red pepper to give some heat and reduce it down to make it nice and sticky.

My husband liked these, but he likes this site's Grill Master wings way better.  He thought the sauce was a tad too sweet to give it more stars.

Overall they were good ! I suggest not battering unless you plan to fry.  I didn't fry only because I didn't want to.  Now I did half and half , half battered  and half not.   Sauce is excellent ! I think I would like it a tad more thick.   The regular not battered were really good !

My daughter made these for supper the other night and they were quite tasty.  Instead of wings, she cut chicken breasts into nuggets.  I fully intend to make these myself, and I'm already thinking of ways to mix it up.  This recipe seems to be very adaptable.

Just tried this for today's lunch. It was GREAT! I also baked my chicken first before putting the sauce. I wanted the chicken to be a bit spicy so I added cayenne pepper and paprika. It turned out really great. We absolutely loved it!

Very tasty. Also pretty sugary, but perfect if you want a good chicken wing recipe without spicy sauce.

Drool! Applause! Thank you! This is my favorite recipe from this site (or any site I think). My family and I started brain storming on the other cuts of chicken and vegetables you could dip in this delicious sauce. Oh the possibilities! No napkins please, well

WOW! These are delicious!  I doubled the sauce recipe since I had about 5-6 lbs of wings. Hubby asked for these and they were gobbled down in no time flat.  Even my son who normally doesn't eat wings loved them.  Other than doubling the sauce recipe, I didn't change a thing...and wouldn't!!  These will definitely be made many more times in the future.

These are absolutely devine!  I made these a couple of weeks ago because my husband wanted hot wings to eat while watching football, so I made him the restaurant style wings (also found on this site) and I made these for myself since I'm not crazy about burning up my tastebuds - LOL.  He tasted mine and liked them better!  I also tried his, and they actually weren't that hot and they were also good.  Today is Super Bowl Sunday and he asked me to make these. :)

Following the original instructions, I was blown away by how amazing these turned out.  The double cooking really helped give these wings the best crispy/chewy texture on the outside and moistness inside.  These are now a regular item for my family and pairs really well with a hoppy beer.

Great chicken! We made a big batch of chicken, but were concerned that the smaller children wouldn't like it, so we made some just fried with no sauce. WOW!  There was so much plain chicken left that we scraped sauce from the pan to pour over the plain chicken. We have been making this weekly by popular demand and it is always devoured!

Enjoy cooking with butter. It's not as smelly as with oil, and the wings turned out really good. I cut the sugar amount somewhat, to keep the wings from being too sweet.

Amazing.  The only change I made was I skipped dipping the wings in egg and just rolled them in flour. This was not near as messy and they were still very crispy.  I kept the wings warm in a crock pot on warm.  I took 6 pounds of these wings to a party and they were gone in the first 1/2 hour.  This was a party of about 20 with lots of other food! This is now my go to wing recipe.  NOTE:  It takes about 20 min to fry the wings and then another 30 - 45 minutes in the oven.

Fabulous! Per one viewers suggestion I placed sauce in saucepan and simmered it til it was a little thicker. After frying chicken I drizzled sauce on chicken till it was coated and place in oven broiler to crisp it. I used left over sauce next day on chicken strip I had fried and coated the strips with sauce and broiled them  the same way and they were fabulous!

I made these the other day. I only substituted the butter for veg. oil. Only because the butter started to burn quick. But tasting the wings I made in the butter and then the regular oil, I don't really taste to much of a difference. Five star recipe. Everyone loved it. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This receipe is fantastic. The whole family loved it.  The kids even asked me to make it again for them.  I think the next time I make it I am going to use cut up chicken breast instead of wings.  Will definatley make again.  The only substitue I did was use low sodium soy, instead of regular soy.

The flavour of these wings has a very  nice "restaurant" style taste. My friends can never believe that I made them from scratch rather than cracking open a box from the freezer.

Just tried this recipe out and for someone that isn't culinary inclined, it was pretty easy and straight forward. The recipe was pretty good! the flavor was great and would make it again in the future! Although I'd probably use the baking method instead of frying it in butter beforehand. Probably a much healthier alternative.

3 stars- exactly as the recipe is. I do not like the way it turned out without the few tweaks that I used. First off- put seasonings in the flour, it adds more flavor. Make sure you don't beat the egg too much, as when I fried it the crumbs fell off. I used the butter to fry and it just became soggy and fell apart. Instead, I added butter fried it, then added oil half way up the wings and fried on both sides. I then placed in the casserole dish and added the sauce. I tripled the sauce, and tried the double broil method but it did not stick or goop. Instead I took the wings out after 10 minutes, fried them, and then heated the sauce up and used it as a dipping sauce. It was good after these changes.

I made them and they were delicious. I wasn't really sure about the marinade at first, as my whole kitchen reeked of winegar, but when they were ready, half of my family came to sniff the oven. :)

This was good. I did make soem modifications. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey and instead of white vinegar I used aplle. These were not orignally intended but just using what I had on hand. I will update when I make it folowing the exact recipe.

This was amazing. Really good flavor. I followed the suggestion of others and broiled them using olive oil rather than frying them in butter. They turned out really tasty.

I decided to make this for dinner tonight. I know the ingredients are kind of unhealthy, but I wanted to try it as it's listed and then maybe try some healthier substitutes next time. It turned out to be so good! My husband and daughter were sad that I hadn't made more! I'll definitely make this again, but try some other options like "oven frying" and skipping the egg. The chicken was crispy, but still juicy. Great flavor :)

These were amazing! I just made one change though, instead of just using plain all-purpose flour, I decided to use the flour mix from another wings recipe I was working on. It included:    (1lb chicken drumlettes yield)  1/4 cup + 2 tbsp flour  1/8 cup garlic powder  ground black pepper to taste  salt to taste    It gives the wings a bit of a kick without changing the Japanese taste.

My family loved these. And I make that statement with 2 picky children included. My son (12) and daughter (6) went nuts over these wings. I didn't even get seconds the first time I made these. The only change I have made is to make a lot more sauce, and serve on rice  to make more of a meal as apposed to just an appetizer.  I tripled the sauce the last time I made these. The other change I made was to hold some of the sauce out until the last ten minutes and used a little cornstarch in that to thicken things up a little bit. Great all around as either an appetizer or a meal.

I have to admit that I did not follow this recipe exactly because I was already baking some chicken wings and looking for a different sauce to coat them in.  They came out absolutely delicious! They are sweet and very sticky and you can't help licking your fingers. Next time I will try them as directed but I don't see how they could be any better.

We went to a snack party where everyone made there favorite snacks and appetizers. I made these and had rave reviews.. That were so good... I have made them many times now for football games or when we have appetizer nights for dinner which is so fun.. I highly suggest having an appetizer night with your family..

Great Wings !! I also baked my wings like others suggested, i coated them in with flour and seasonings and sprayed them with pam , then transfered them to a corniware dish and poured the sauce over and baked them. They are amazing!! I served them with white rice and made some extra sauce for to put over the rice.

I followed the recipe exactly.  While the flavor was decent, I was not blown away.  The sugar was a bit much.  And I think maybe I should have followed some others advise and avoided the egg/flour/butter fry in the beginning and just seasoned the chicken and baked a bit longer.

Loved the sticky sweetness! Since my friend and I made these for a shower; the mass quantity we had to make took too long to fry with just butter so we added canola oil to speed up the process. Still turned out very yummy though; they were a big hit.

I have been making this recipe for several years and I just love it. The only thing wrong with this recipe is that for my taste, I have to double the sauce. We love a lot of sauce on our food. Another bad thing is, that we never have enough for the next day:-)!!

I followed as is except adding a double pinch of red pepper seeds.  This is very close to General Tso with the bone.  I didn't make enough and I doubled the recipe.

I love this recipe. I used chicken breasts cut into strips instead of wings, but followed the recipe the rest of the way. I get requests for this all the time now.

This was a hit with the family, especially a picky sixteen year old. She loved the sticky sauce. Destined to be requested over and over again. *I used oil instead of butter to fry the wings.

These were delicious - a nice change from traditional hot wings. I deep fried my wings in oil and dipped each one into the sauce before baking. I did pour the sauce over the wings and basted twice during baking. I will make these again!

These wings are excellent!  I made a few modifications for my taste.  I use oil to fry the wings and add less vinegar and soy sauce substituting orange juice for a little more flavor. Adding a table spoon of cornstarch helps thicken up the sauce.  I spice it up a bit by adding ground ginger and crushed red pepper flakes.  They always seem to be the talked about item when taken to events that I now remember to bring along copies of the recipe.

Excellent-our whole family really enjoyed them. A nice change from regular wings-will definitely add to our rotation. We made them as is-think I will also try them our with strips sometime-think the kids would love that.

This recipe was so delicious. Next time though when I make it I think i will pre-fry my wings in oil and then just toss the wings in the sauce because the wings were not crispy enough for me when I baked them.

The sauce was very good, but we prefer nonbreaded wings and it was hard to get the sauce to stick without the breading.

I made these for my husband, he thought they were awesome.  I floured mine, and baked them in the oven.  With the sauce I cut back a bit on the sugar, but used spenda instead.  They were very good, and not too much sugar.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's not hard at all and most importantly, it tastes fantastic! My sister made it first, and then I took it home and made it for my family and it couldn't have turned out any better. Thnx to the recipe submitter!

I really enjoyed these wings and my boyfriend did too! My only complaint is that you can get a nice crisping on the top layer but the bottom layer is soggy. We happen to prefer our wings crisp so once the wings had cooked the full cooking time I removed them from the sauce and lightly dabbed the bottom of the wings on paper towels to absorb some moisture and put them on a cookie sheet on parchment and baked them on high 475 degrees for a few minutes and then I turned the broiler on to crisp the top. Doing this achieved the texture we prefer, no knock on the recipe itself.

These are awesome wings. I've made them twice. The first time I pan fried like the recipe says and I made extra sauce. I ended up with a lot of extra sauce which I ended up discarding. This time, I floured the wings, sprayed with PAM and baked for 40 minutes. Then I put the sauce on the wings and baked another 40 minutes. I basted throughout the cooking time. The wings were great this way too!

What a great recipe!  I made this for my Super Bowl party - to go along with my spicy buffalo wings.  Which ones were gone first?  These!  Everybody loved them!  4 stars from me, because they are a little sweet for me - but I am sure all of my friends would give it 5.

This is a delicious recipe. I brown the chicken in oil, but I use chicken thighs now as it is a more meaty option.  I also omit the garlic as it really doesnt need it.  I also bring the sauce to a boil first just so everything is mixed well.  Always double or triple the sauce so you can pour over rice.  You must try, so so good

These wings were tasty. I decided not to fry them because of the fat content. They were a good substitution for traditional buffalo wings.

I took the advice of some other people, and oven fried it. I cut the suger in half. I made it twice in a row, the first night was awesome! Tasted great! The second night, I doubled the recipe for guests and it did not come out so great. I think I will only make it for me and my husband. We both love it.

My husband found this receipe and makes it for the family.  It is great!! Thanks for posting it.  I ask him to use a little less sugar because it is a bit sweet for my taste but the rest of the house likes it just the way it is.

I didn't give it a five star because it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I would use less sugar. I cooked it for a my father's big 6oth birthday and my very picky family gobbled it all up.  I didn't have any leftovers because it was the first item (of 20) they finished.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I integrated the 2 most helpful recipes and they turned out great and were very easy to make. So first, I seasoned, floured, and sprayed w/ PAM...baked at 400 for 30 min. Then poured on the sauce (I added chili flakes and some sweet chili sauce) and basted for another 30 minutes. I'll definitely make them again.

This is really yummy. I follow directions as is, but after frying, I cover, put in the oven for about 30 minutes. I then take it out, pour a lot of the sauce over the chicken, I then cover for another 10 minutes. I then uncover, bake for another 30 minutes, checking on it. For the last 5-6 minutes, I put on hi broil, and once I take it out, I top with sesame seeds and scallions. These always go great for chinese theme night in my home, where I make egg fried rice, and a side of egg drop soup =)

This is a great recipe. I don't fry the wings first, I just put them in the oven to bake them. I also add minced onions and a little bit of ground ginger too. My family loves it!

My family loved this recipe. I love trying new recipes and the last time I made wings it was not a good turn out so my husband was a little nervous when I told him I was making wings.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I basted them every 15 minutes and cooke them for the 45 minutes. My husband and my daughter voted that it was a keeper.Will for sure make again soon!!!

AWESOME! I had a 5 lb. bag of wings so I doubled the recipe, used 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of soy sauce. I added a little vegetable oil to the butter so that the wings wouldn't burn. There was enough sauce covering the wings so that after 25 minutes I just turned the wings over. They were so tender and delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I wanted a different way to prepare my chicken wings other than buffalo style and this recipe was what I picked. I baked my wings instead of egging and flouring and then frying in butter and halfway thru cook time I poured this incredibly simple sauce over them...DELICIOUS!! The sauce is what makes this recipe. Use aluminum foil on baking pan for easy clean up, very sticky! Definitely a keeper.

I've been using this sauce for years, to rave reviews, and often make Japanese Pork instead, using cubed pork. When served with a few other Asian dishes, the pork is usually the favourite. Also, I use half margarine and half peanut oil for the frying.

My sauce was thin.  I had to boil it down and add it back to the wings.  Too much work and not much flavor.  We preferred the Buffalo Wings I from this site better.

fantastic! best recipe that I tried here.   Even though I'm japanese raised overthere, I didn't feel this flavor is really Japanese.   I still give 5 stars though. the only chage I made was using half of the butter---didn't tast like I cut the amount of butter in half.

YUM!!  I was looking for something different rather than just frying my wings and this was perfect.  Pretty easy and super yummy.  The kids and the hubby loved them too.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!

Terrific recipe. I doubled the sauce recipe (for dipping) and was thankful I did. My son is always wanting "something different" to eat and this one was a winner!

This recipe intimidated me a bit at first as I've never fried anything.  It was actually very easy (though a little time consuming), but the wings turned out wonderfully!  They received many compliments.  These are best hot/straight from the oven, though.

My friends and I loved these wings. The first time I made them I used wings, used the flour, skipped the egg. For the sauce, I cut the sugar in half, and added some ginger, crushed red pepper and some chili powder. I wanted them to be sweet and spicy. Then I sprayed the wings with butter cooking spray then baked in the oven at 375 for 35 min. turned them over and baked another 25 min. Basted with the sauce for another 20 minutes and let sit for a bit. They were very sticky and delicious. The next time I used skinless boneless chicken breasts I cut up, coated in flour, then browned at high heat. I then added sauce and cooked in oven for 30 min, basting every 8 in or so. They were great this way too.

The sauce is AMAZING!  I also baked mine instead of frying.  Next time I am going to make more sauce!  I think that is the main key.  Thank you for a great recipe.

These were very good.  My husband actually thanked me for making them.  I did cut the sugar in half and I did deep fry the wings in oil as opposed to butter.   Very Very good.  Definitely a keeper matter of fact, I made copies of the recipe and handed them out to my team at work.

FABULOUS RECIPE!! I have made it many times and my picky eaters at home just love it (my husband is Japonese, so this aced his test!) Instead of using bone-in chicken wings, I cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite-size pieces. Also, I refridgerate the flour-coated pieces for 30 minutes then recoat them immediately before frying in butter. This allows for a crispy and gooey texture.

Absolutely the best wings ever!. I didn't fry these, I just placed wings in 3 9x13 pans and baked at 375 for about 45 min. I did decrease the sugar from 1c. to 3/4c. and the sauce was perfect! I then heated the sauce (which I doubled) on the stove to melt the sugar and poured over the wings and turned every 10 minutes for about 50 minutes. I was weary at first b/c the sauce is very thin but it makes a beautiful glaze as it cooks. I will be making this regularly and plan to try it with other cuts of chicken and pork!

Totally yummy!! I did follow prior users suggestions and cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and added a generous teaspoon of garlic chili paste and it was perfect!! No need to fry the wings, either, as I broiled mine until they were a bit brown and then finished baking them in the sauce per the recipe. Definitely a keeper!! Even better the next day, if there are any left!!

If you like sweet chicken wings then this is the recipe for you. I liked it even though i reduced the sugar by half it was still to sweet. I would also make them as an appetizer or for a party but i would not recommend having them for a main course unless you reduce the sweetness substantially. Give it 4 stars and i did not change anything except i added a teaspoon of canyenne powder to even the sweetness out.

When I made these for the first time, I forgot to dip them in the egg/flour mixutre.  They still turned out delicious.  My girlfriend who has also made them before commented that they are better without the egg/flour mixture.  I also added some sesame seeds to the sauce.  All in all, super yummy!

Very tasty actually - tangy and different.  I wish it would have crisped a little more - maybe my fault.  Thank you.

These were awesome!  The kids (2 and 5) just loved them and gobbled them up.  I did spend about an hour frying up the chicken, so don't preheat your oven until your about half-way done with frying.  I fried with canola oil instead of butter.  I will be making these again!

This was wonderful, I'm planning to make this for my office potluck.  I didn't make any changes to it, I would like to try it with hot pepper flakes, but my kid loves it just the way it is.

Such an excellent flavor.  I felt it was restaurant quality -- but mine was made from fresh ingredients with no preservatives!  I used veg oil instead of butter, and cubed tofu instead of wings, and served it over rice.  I made only half of the sauce recipe, but only used half a pound of tofu (instead of the recipe's 3 lbs of chicken).  I wish I had still used the full sauce recipe!  You really have to made a lot more sauce than the recipe calls for.  I also added cayenne since I like spicy.  The flour coating got very soggy while baking; next time I will not use flour at all.  I can't wait to try this again!

i brought these to a dinner party and they were quite a hit.  i felt they were a bit sweet for my taste.  maybe next time i will take other cooks' advice and add some cayenne and less sugar to balance out the flavors.  they make for a beautiful presentation and a nice variation from the traditional buffalo wings.

These were delicious!!! My four year old daughter loved them.  I used wingettes instead and this could be used as a great appetizer at a dinner party.

These were so easy and yummy.  Cleanup was easy as well.  I agree that maybe some seasame seeds and red pepper flakes would be good, especially the red pepper flakes. Some spice would have been nice to balance out the sweet flavor of the wings.

We loved the flavor, but the wings never got crispy, so the consistency was not very good.  But, I will make this again, but probably more as a glaze for chicken breasts or grilled chicken as others have suggested.

I have already made this recipe a few times.  The only thing I do differently is I use about 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of white sugar.  When you can get this wings on sale, this recipe is an good, very inexpensive way to make an appetizer.

This was a really good recipe.  I don't really care for wings, so I used legs instead.  They turned out terrific!  I really loved the sauce.  I did thicken it with a bit of a cornstarch slurry until it thickened to my liking (equal parts cornstarch and water).  I can't wait to try this sauce with tempura chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I love how they kind of caramelized. I didn;t baste them, just flipped them every few minutes and they turned out great but I think actually basting them would make them stickier.

These were too sweet for me, but my guests like them.  I would make them again because the texture was great, I like the whole frying in butter first part!  I would for sure cut way down on the sugar and maybe add hoisen sauce or something to add a little more flavor.  I also sprinkled chopped green onion on top after baking.

the flavor was good, however my sauce did not thicken which made the beautifully fried wings soggy. my boyfriend loves wings and thought these were just alright.  i fried them in half butter and half oil.

My family loved this recipe so much I made it twice in one week!  I made a couple changes to the the recipe: I used drumsticks instead of wings, and also used apple cider vinegar in place of the regular vinegar.

Excellent recipe! very very good.  Would love to know if there is anyway to make this less fattening without losing the flavor.

These wings are DELICIOUS!! I recommend seasoning the flour that you coat the wings with.  I added season salt, garlic powder, and pepper.  These are requested at my house all the time!! I have fried them in vegetable oil and butter.  The ones fried in butter are much better.  I just found that it takes more than 1 cup.

Very good.  I made these for a Christmas party and they all went.  I used brown sugar and different types of vinegar, (rice and red wine,) because I ran out of white.  I also fried them in veggie oil instead.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were excellent.  I did cut a 1/4 cup of the sugar though.  Also used packs of drumettes rather than cutting up wings and this saved a lot of time.  These cooked up oh so tender.

Wow, I love these.  Only change I made was to use minced garlic out of a jar because I didn't have garlic powder.  I served these an appetizer for a New Year's Eve Party.

This was really easy to make and tasted great! The wings were juicy and the sauce was great. It was a bit too sweet for me to eat without rice, but my daughter and husband loved it and ate the wings by themselves.

Can't see what all the hype is about over these. They were messy to make and the flavor was just so-so.  They also took longer to bake than what was said in the recipe.  I think I'll just keep making them plain in the oven with butter and seasonings.

I thought that these were ok, but a little too tangy for me.  My husband didn't think they were anything special.  I did have to heat the sauce and add cornstarch to get it to thicken.  I will not make these again.

I was looking for a last minute recipe to use with chicken tenders and this turned out great.  They were juicy inside and nice and gooey outside.  Can't wait to try them with chicken wings.

These are excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The chicken wings were so tender and juicy and the flavor was irrestible during the frying process they were crispy too. What is really good you should try is having fresh lemon wedges on a platter for party guests to have a wedge and squeeze it on them it's so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At A chinese place I had them they were similar to yours but were called Garlic Chicken Sticks SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

These are excellent!  My son has decided I should open my own chicken wing restaurant now.  I was a little worried because some reviews made these sound time consuming but I didn't find that to be true at all.  We will definitely make these again.

If you like sweet and sour you will love this recipe.  I accidentily set out chicken breast tenders instead of chicken wings and it was very good.  I haven't tried the wings but I'm very eager to.  GREAT RECIPE!!

My family LOVED this, I made fried chicken breast strips rather than wings. I made the sauce and cooked untill sticky in a small pot.  Then dipped the chicken in the sauce and broiled.  There were NO leftovers.

These are the BEST wings I've ever tasted and my family loves them. My only change is to add a minced red chili pepper to the sauce to give it that extra kick.

Not as good as my mum's recipe (honey soy sesame).  This needs to marinate for a couple of hours prior to cooking, the taste of the sauce never got past the skin into the meat.  It also didn't get the glaze that I like on wings and the marinade is more of a soup consistancy - not very appetising and has little plate appeal.  I did add the ginger which gave it a nice taste, just not 100% happy and would not recommend it to any of my friends.

This recipe is wonderful.  We always make it for company and everyone always asks for the recipe.  I do as others have recommended and double the recipe for the sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

Fabulous! Everyone loves this dish. I don't use chicken wings, just cut up chicken breasts, served over rice.

Oh my! These are so good and easy. I use 3 chicken breast, cut into strips; 1/2 C canola oil in the place of butter; and ½ the sugar and they are still good. It taste just like take-out.  I like to double the sauce as well.

I made some adjustments to cut the calories a little: fried in a little oil instead of in two cups of butter and cut the sugar by more than half.  Still, the results were decent: we liked these wings, just not quite as much as others did.  Next time we'll try it with pieces of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and serve it, stir-fry style, with veggies over rice.  I think it will come out better that way.

Very Good. I too added 3/4 cup of sugar, and added 1/2 tsp of Cayanne pepper. I added some pasta, with 10mins to go, like suggested in a prior post, and It made the pasta like rubber. Next time I'll add it with 2 minutes to go just to mix it together.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 as suggested by others, and used chicken stirfry/tender pieces instead of wings.  Followed the recipe from there, but increased sauce, boiled spaghetti noodles, drained them well, and then added to the baking chicken for the last 10 minutes or so in the oven. Delicious! I'd reduce the sugar even more next time and perhaps add some red pepper flakes for a kick.  Gr8 recipe, thank you!

These were a good twist on traditional chicken wings. They were a bit too sticky for me to eat fresh. I can't stand stuff sticking to my teeth while I'm eating! So, I put them in the fridge and ate them cold the next day. They were pretty good. I would definitely suggest sprinkling some red pepper on for a sweet/spicy flavor. This isn't my favorite chicken wing recipe, but it's good every now and then if you want something different.

Excellent!  Every1 loved this recipe! We are having it for dinner again tonite.
I changed the measurement of sugar to 3/4 cup because the original was just too much.  I also added sesame seeds: I dried-fried (in a frying pan) the sesame seeds until they turned golden/brownish, after the chicken wings were cooked I lightly sprinkled it on the chicken wings AND IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!   THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT RECIPE!

These wings were perfect. The only change I made was that I fried the wings in a deep fryer and then I added 1 tbsp of melted butter to the sauce for the butter flavor. The though of frying chicken in 2 sticks of butter was a little scary for me plus butter burns so easily.

This recipe is really good, but you have to make sure that there is enough sauce to coat and that you don't overcook at all - otherwise the flavor won't stand out as much.  The meat just falls of the bone!!

Not overly impressed with this recipe. I followed other ratings and added ginger and brown sugar to the sauce. The sauce was just okay...If I were to make it again I would use chicken breasts. Also the cooking time on this was skewed as mine took about 55 minutes to be completely done. I was really looking forward to making this and trying it but it felt short of what I expected.

I was afraid to try this one b/c the ingredients seemed strange together, but it has really good reviews so I thought I'd try it out!!  The first time I made it, I made it as written with chicken wings.  It was really time consuming, but pretty good.  The past few times I've made it though, I've used whole drumsticks instead and served it with rice on the side.

I usually love all wing recipes, but these were just soooo sweeet. They carmalized well, of course with all the suger. I also took forever to brown in the oil/butter. They were Ok,  but don't think I'll make again.

Kids LOVED these!! Hubby doused them in hot sauce and I thought they were pretty good. Very sweet! Don't think I'll be making these too often though as they take a very long time to brown in the butter. Served with New Red Potato Salad from this site and corn on the cob! Had ourselves a little "barbecue" in the brisk month of October! :)

This recipe was very good. I used Splenda instead of regular sugar, used half the butter and used chicken breasts. My family loved this and I  will definetly make it again. Thanks!

These were the best wings and this recipe definitely deserves 5 stars.  The only changes I made were to use fresh minced or pressed garlic instead of the powder and to add red pepper flakes to the sauce mixture.  The pepper flakes add some kick and provided a nice sweet/spicy taste to the wings.  I also baked the wings for about 10 minutes after frying them to increase the crispiness.  Thereafter, I poured on the sauce and continually basted.

The sauce is really good. I thought the vinegar gave it a nice kick but my sister thought it was too vinegary.  I used chicken thighs instead of the wings.  Next time I will try it again with the wings as the thighs weren't crispy enough when I fried it.  Also, the sauce turned out really runny.  I will try to add a little cornstarch to it before putting it in the oven.

It was really really good, but I would suggest making it with something else besides chicken wings, like bonelss chicken leg meat or breasts.
I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce, which at first didn't seem like it would thicken at all while it was in the oven, but I found that if you let it sit about 5-10 minutes before serving and then take some of the sauce from the bottom of the pan and pour it ontop of the chicken, that the sauce will thicken.
I also added salt and pepper to the flour and didn't add the extra salt to the sauce.  I also only put about 1/2 cup of sugar to the sauce mixture.
Finally, I added a couple chopped green onions as a garnish on top of the chicken when serving, the green onions seem to go well with the flavor of the sauce.

Love the sauce!  Is sweet so I only used 3/4 c. sugar.  Frying in butter is probably fattening but makes it soooo good!  I will definitely make again!

This was very, very good. It tasted like something we would order at a restaurant. I only used 1 lb of chicken because I didn't want to have a bunch of left overs. After trying, I wish I would have made all 3 lbs! We are a military family stationed overseas in Europe and because of our limited food resources, we often wish we could go to our favorite restaurant or create our favorite dishes but can't. This dish was a small bit of happiness for us! Thanks for sharing.

This was a yummy sauce.  It doesn't have enough bite for wings, but it would make a great chicken breast over rice sauce. I'll use this again for a dinner recipe. Thanks!

These wings were great. We used butter flavored shortening instead of butter and it worked out well. The vinegar was a little strong, but by cutting back on it some it was perfect.

Great flavour! I was a little hesitant about the vinegar, but it did blend nicely. The butter I'll substitute next time for a little oil, a bit too much grease for our liking. I'll be making this one again!

WOW!  What an awesome dish!  This is similar to sesame chicken or general Tso's chicken because it's fried and sweet, but SO much better because it's home made.  I would recommend this dish anytime...no changes to the original recipe.

Yummy. These are a hit. I made a few minor changes. I cooked the wings in my fry daddy. As a couple reviewers suggested, I added some cornstarch and water to the wings during the last 10 mins of baking. We ate them with rice. Definitely a keeper!

Wow!!! I made these for my husband and he LOVED them! I have a sweet tooth so I thought I would really love the recipe. I did, but after a while I found it a bit too sweet for me. It won't stop me from making it again though. Maybe next time I'll cut down on the brown sugar. I took the extra sauce and used it over rice. I would love to be able to make the chicken crispier though. Not that it was soggy, but I think it would be very very good if it had some crunch to it. Although that could be because I used chicken breats as opposed to wings to cut back on the fat.

These chicken wings are so good!  This is one of my most favorite recipies from this site.  I make these at least twice a month and every time I've made them it has taken me way over 1 hour from start to finish.  It doesn't matter though, the results are totaly worth the time.  I forget the extra salt and add a little honey. Tremendous!

Messy to prepare (and fattening as heck), but YUMMY!

These were delicious. Even though thin, I thought the sauce was perfect for this dish. It really does taste like something you'd get from a Japanese or Chinese restaurant.

Great recipe!  The taste was well worth the time it took to prepare, which wasn't that bad! My family loved it.  Just couldn't make enough of this for them.

My whole family loved these! I used chicken legs and they came out great. These were easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand. This is a keeper!

These were a big hit in my house. I made 5 pounds of wings and there wasn't one, not one, morsel left. The overall concensus was this is a keeper.
Thanks for sharing.

These are just fabulous!!  I made them for my husband, both with the wings and then with boneless chicken breasts, and he was floored.  I have been looking for a new way to cook chicken, and this is it!  I thought with the vinegar in it it would have a nasty taste, but the sugar cancelles that out.  This is now a must have for those weekly grocery store trips!!

These wings are the best I've ever made.  My kids love them!
