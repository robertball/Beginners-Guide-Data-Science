I made this cake yesterday and it turned out very well.  I live on the Mexican border so I have had this cake many times in restaurants and at parties.    I did make a few changes to lesson the calorie and fat content and it still tasted authentic. First I would tell you to read the directions carefully.  The cake has 3 parts ; batter,filling and topping.  The first 6 ingredients make the batter. Be sure to put only one cup of sugar in the batter not 2. The next 3 ingredients make the 3 milk mixture for the filling hence the name three milk cake.  I chose not to use whole milk but used 1% and used only 1 cup along with the other 2 milks.    I made the cake in a 9x13 pan not a round pan as seen in the picture.  The cake was a little flat but that is ok because as you add the 3 milk mixture it expands .  After the cake was done I pierced the cake many times with a fork , all over the cake. You want to make a lot of holes for the milk to saturate the cake.  After you pour the milk on , you want to cover with foil and refrigerate for several hours.  I chose to use cool whip as the topping instead of the whipping cream-sugar mixture.  That cut down on a lot of the calories and was very good.  After I covered the saturated cake with cool whip I covered with foil again and refrigerated for another several hours. You want it to be very cold when you serve it.  I know this has been long but wanted to share my changes and suggestions on making this cake.  Good luck!

I am from Panama and have been making this cake for over 20 years and am constantly making changes to make it even better. This is my favorite cake ever and it is always a hit! A few suggestions:
1 - The toppings can vary from cherries to coconut to cajeta (caramelized milk).
2 - I never use regular milk or whipping cream. Instead I use half & half. I also recommend using either eggnog or coconut milk.
3 - Most of the time, I don't make the cake from scratch - instead I use white cake mix (I don't recommend the butter cake mix for this recipe). When the cake is ready, I cut off the sides and the top to let the cake soak up the milk. 
4 - Always let the cake sit overnight in the fridge...letting the cake soak up the milk makes it even better! Plus this way you can decide whether to take out the milk or leave it in (I like to leave it all in).
5 - Kahlua and Rum adds a great kick to this cake!!! I've even heard of tequila-lime tres leches. 

Basically this is such a versatile recipe with millions of ways to make it your own!

I love Tres Leches cake but this is not the best recipe.  The eggs need to be separated, and the whites beaten prior to adding them to the batter.  I have done it both ways, and despite the extra work, separating the eggs is well worth the effort.

My recipe is nearly identical - except I follow a slightly different method for making the cake portion - beat the butter first, for a few minutes until it is a light yellow color - then add the sugar and beat on high until it is very pale - add eggs one at a time (beating for 20 seconds between each egg); then add vanilla and beat for one more minute.  Add flour mixture a little at a time and mix until batter is smooth (my batter is always a bit thick).  For a slightly better rise in the cake add 1/4 tsp baking soda with the baking powder.  

I like to use 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk (essentially half and half) instead of all regular milk... provides a creamier flavor.  

Can be made without the whipped topping if you prefer - it's good with or without it.  

You will NOT be disappointed in this cake - very very delicious!

This is the second recipe that I have tried for Tres Leches, and it came out perfect.  I read all of the previous reviews, and I must disagree with several of the earlier comments.  This cake does not taste eggy (I used 5 large eggs, maybe the other guy used jumbo).  Using a 13x9 pan, the thickness was just right, about 1-1/4" high (cake portion).  There was not too much liquid.  I found the amount of liquid to be almost perfect.  The only problem was having to wait a while for it all to soak in.  I did not want to wait any longer, so I had to dump a few ounces, so I could proceed to the frosting stage.  Once I was serving the cake, I found that it was totally moist, but I would have preferred some excess milk mixture at the bottom, which this one did not produce (the amount missing was just about the amount I threw out), so I think the recipe is probably perfect on quantities and perfect on cooking instructions.  Out of 7 people at my dinner party, 6 loved the cake and one was neutral.

Thank you Stephanie for a great recipe

Overall this is a very good recipe. To ensure you have a good cake, make sure you mix the batter halves exactly.  To get a good rise to the cake, make you you whip the egg whites to merenge-like batter.  Then gently fold in the the flour batter until blended.  Do not overmix or your cake will be flat.  Bake cake until you have a nice brown top where a toohpick comes out clean and cool. (Hint: in a confection oven, I bake this at 325 degrees for 20 minutes.)

As far as the milk mixture goes, I omit the whole milk and just blend together the three milks (hence the name Tres Leches) heavy cream, evaporated milk, and condensed milk together.  After you have punched holes into the made cake, pour half the milk mixture into the cake.  The cake will absorb the mixture.  Refrigerate at least an hour.

When serving, I cut out squares of cake out, not using the cake sides. I place a square cake serving into a small bowl.  I pour milk mixture on top of the cake until it is all the way to the top or half way to the cake.  A small dab of whipped topping and topped with a maraschino cherry and decorate with a tinge of cherry juice over the whipped topping.

By the time you will serve this, the milk mixture will be absorbed into the cake.

For my tough family of food critics, this recipe gets rave reviews!
Thank you for shraing this recipe!

Marti,

Your recipe is wonderful...yours was the second (out of four) recipe I tried and I'm not going any further...I am from Nicaragua, where this cake originated and your recipe came very, very close with the following exceptions:

1.  Use 2 14-oz cans of condensed milk and

2.  Use only 10 oz of evaporated milk (2 5-oz cans)

Thank you for your recipe...great start.

It truly is a great Tres Leches but here are a few very important steps taught to me by a Honduran friends mom. IMPORTANT!! Take the cake out when done to cool, don't touch it, turn off the oven & set the timer for 5 mins. After 5 mins THEN poke the holes in the cake using the large end of a chopstick making larger holes then fork tines, pour the liquid on the top & RETURN to the off oven for 10 mins. The reasons. 1) the cake is still cooking when you take it out so poking holes at that time reseals them, hence no absorption. 2) the dwindling heat slowly forces the liquid into the cake. Also, I substitute a cup of coconut "cream" NOT coconut "milk", for whole milk.
Proceed with the topping when cooled. You will be shocked how unbelievably moist but non soupy this turns out when done this way. Enjoy!!

I have made this cake several times.  The last time I made it, I decided to double the cake recipe, because I thought the cake was too thin.  (Although, I have never recvd any complaints from my customers.)  I was told that when I doubled the cake, there were areas where it was too dry and there was not enough of the liquid.  There is no need to fix what is not broke!!  The original recipe is a hit and the best tres leches recipe on the web.  It is very easy and as one of my customers put it, "simply divine!"

This is my husband's favorite cake - the one he's requested for his birthday two years running.  I used to think it needed more liquid and therefore added another can of condensed with another cup of whole milk, but last time I made it just the way it's written (except that I still decreased the sugar in the whipped cream), and it's *perfect*.  Absolutely, positively perfect.

For some people who were in a hurry - thought t might interest them to know that heating the milk mixture slightly will result in faster absorption into the cake. also it will enable the milks to mix better and with less effort.

I love this cake, it was exactly what I wanted.  I grew up eating Tres Leches cake, and the only problem I always had buying them from some stores or bakeries is that they were sickeningly sweet.  This one wasn't like that at all. Now, the only thing different I did was make a different frosting since I hardly ever have cream.  Also, I read mixed reviews on separating the eggs.  I didn't do it and since I liked it as is, I don't have a reason to do more work!  But that's just me.  Also, another reviewer mentioned that the cake is soggy.  YES!  That's how it's supposed to be.  When you sink your fork into it, the milks should ooze out.  It shouldn't be swimming in milk, neither should it be dry.  If you don't like the idea of a wet cake, then I suggest you try a more traditional cake because you may not like this one.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was just ok.  I've never made Tres Leches before and so I wasn't sure how it was supposed to turn out.  I used about 1/2 a cup of cream of coconut along with the rest of the milk due to some reviewers commenting on how it was not sweet enough.  Mine turned out perfect in the sweet dept. but it was like a soggy pound cake.  The taste was good and it held together well, but it's not something I'll make again in the near future.  Thanks anyway Stephanie.

Wonderful recipe! Very authentic. My husband is Nicaraguan and, yes, as other reviewers have stated, Nicaragua is the origin of the tres leches cake - although other Latin cultures have embraced and modified it. I added a good pinch of nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ing. to boost the flavors. For the milk mixture I used 2 full size cans condensed milk, 2-5 oz. cans evaporated milk and 1 c. 2% milk because it was all I had.  It worked perfectly. My cake (9 X 13) did not come out flat and that might be because I allowed quite a bit of whipping time after I added the eggs. I refrigerated the cooled and milk-soaked cake overnight and the next morning added a layer of chopped strawberries and on top of that heavy whipping cream whipped with 1 tsp. good vanilla and about 1/3 c. pwd sugar. In my opinion, the cake would be too sweet with any more sugar than that. Great recipe! I might try it next time with coconut milk (replacing the 2%), rum extract and mangoes.

I have made this cake 3 times.  First time I followed the recipe exactly, then I started tinkering with the method.  Here's what I came up with: (1) not necessary to grease and flour pan (2) not necessary to mix flour and baking powder separately; also not necessary to add it 2 Tbsp at a time - just dump in the flour and baking powder (3) I *did* find it necessary to beat well after each egg addition.  This produced a better textured cake.  THANKS, STEPHANIE, FOR THIS RECIPE!

I have made this cake three times now, and this is what I learned in my own personal test kitchen:
1) I don't bother separating the eggs:  If you beat the egg whites separately (as other reviewers recommend), the remaining batter is so dry (with only the butter and egg yolks for moisture, it is almost like a paste), that at the time of folding in the beaten egg whites, you loose most of the air you have just beaten into them.  I have done it both ways, and saw little to no difference.  I did add ¼ tsp baking soda to help the baking powder raise the cake.
2) More leche please!  For my taste, even  with one can of condensed milk, one of evaporated and 2 of half and half, the cake needed more liquid.  This may depend on personal taste, but for me a tres leches has to be oozing liquid.
3) If you are like me, and once a cake is made you can't stop eating, try half the recipe in an 8x8 pan and half all the ingredients.  The original 5 eggs can be best split as 2 whole and 1 separated egg white.  Leaving out the third yolk, also cuts on the eggy taste (which is not overpowering - the smell in the fresh cake is stronger than the taste in the finished recipe).
4) I used confectioner’s sugar for the whipping cream
5) Don’t hold back on plucking holes: This is what gets the liquid into the cake.  The more the better

I first made this recipe back in 2007 for my friend's birthday. (Infact, my profile picture is this cake haha.) Anyway, I swear by this cake because it truly is delicious. Way better than the Culinary Institute of America's recipe for Tres Leches cake, by the way. 

Here's a few secrets to this cake: #1) Replace AP Flour with Cake Flour and it's a way better product. I've made this cake all sorts of ways, and cake flour is gonna be your best shot for an impressively delicious cake. #2) If you let this cake sit in the fridge for 2 whole days, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Like, seriously. 2 days is the secret. The texture is crazy amazing.

Made this last night, and to give it additional visual appeal, I used a pastry bag w/ a star tip to add the whipped topping.  Also garnished each slice w/ a marashino cherry.  To add more depth, I added a dash of caramel extract to the whipping cream...yummy!
Instead of using a fork to poke holes in the cake, I used a tool from Pampered Chef called "Hold & Slice" -it has 10 tines, so it makes the job go a lot quicker, and allows the milk to be absorbed quicker

Results: Cake was very tasty and very moist.  It was completely saturated with the milks.  It was quite sweet, and IMO, went really well with a dark tea.  Making the cake was reasonably easy.  The flavors were quite balanced, and the taste of the milks did come through.

Thoughts on recipe: I used the amount of liquid specified.  At times, I thought there was no chance it would all be absorbed into the cake, but it was. (But barely, and after some time sitting)  Rather than taking the cake out of the pan before putting the milks in, I would recommend adding the milks with the cake in the pan, so that the liquid which falls over the side of the cake while pouring will eventually be absorbed through the bottom of the cake.

If I were to make this again: It's a fairly simple recipe, so I don't think I'd want to tweak too much.  I tend to like cakes which aren't super sweet, so I might consider using a little less sugar in the cake batter itself.  I also wonder if it would be a good twist to add a little extra flavor (nothing TOO strong) to the milks/batter, perhaps a little more vanilla or coconut milk or nutmeg to help the cake be even more aromatic.

I very much liked this cake and so did my family. The cake itself was quite simple to make and very flavorful. I have made this cake twice and plan on making it again. the first time I made it I had run out of evaporated milk so I actually had to cut the "filling" down to 1 can sweet/cond milk, 1 and 1/2 cup whole milk and a 1/2 cup of half and half. In fact, I was afraid to add all of the milk to the recipe to begin with so I figured it couldn't ruin it. It turned out wonderfully. 
The second time I decided to make it exactly according to recipe and added the correct amounts. It was far too moist for my family although the flavor was excellent. I believe this recipe is perfect but it depends on personal tastes for the amount of milk filling.

I made this recipe for a group of Guatemalan friends  and was nervous when I saw how thin it was.  Not to worry though...I called a Mexican bakery and they told me that the cake is supposed to be thin and to let the liquid sit on the cake for a half an hour before getting rid of the excess.  Also, poke lots of holes in the cake.  Ultimately, it was delicious and a huge success topped with sliced strawberries and kiwi.

This is a solid recipe for Milk Cake - in other words, someone from Mexico will recognize it as Milk Cake.  However, I'd definitely recommend reducing the sugar for the frosting to 1/4-1/2 of a cup (a whole cup of sugar makes a very sweet - too sweet - frosting.  Otherwise, perfect.  Also, add sliced strawberries & bananas to the top of the cake before frosting.  The fruit helps to reduce the overall sweetness of the cake.  I love really sweet cakes & desserts, but if you don't alter this cake slightly it almost feels like you're eating sugar (not quite, but it is that sweet!).

Enjoy!

It should be confectioners sugar in the whipped cream, not granulated.

This recipie is SOOOO good.  I have to admit - I took someone's advice from another review and used a white cake mix (running short on time)  I then poked holes in the cake when it was still warm and added the S.C. mile, the Evap milk and instread of whole milk I used 1 cup of heavy cream.  The cake was moist and delicious without being soggy.  I then topped it with fresh whipped cream - but I did not add as much sugar to the whipped cream as the recipie suggested.  I just added sugar to taste like I usually do when I use whipped cream.
Next time I will try actually following the directions for the cake.

I made this Saturday morning for a get together on Sat. Night.  My husband is Mexican, and my friends love Tres Leches...so the test was on!  I followed the recipe exactly except for only one thing:  I separated yokes from whites and whipped up whites to a froth before folding them in.  The cake bather was thick, and I had to spread it to the corners of the pan to cover.  After baking, I let it cool and hour before poking holes.  Poured the mixed milks on top, covered, and set in fridge for about 10 hours.  Right before serving, I whipped up the heavy whipping cream, topped cake, added sliced strawberries for effect.

I am not keen on wet cakes, [and that is what tres leches is suppose to be....very, very wet] and so I asked my husband and friends if the cake was too soggy & that maybe I should put in a cup less milk  [the cake had a bit of milk at the bottom, as other reviews described].   My husbands response was, "if you did that, it wouldn't be tres leches, it would be 2 and a half leches"...and then went on to say the cake was perfect!...and friends asked for recipe.

Just so there's no misunderstanding here, I used a boxed white cake mix and cool whip topping instead of the homemade cake and whipped cream the recipe called for.  However, I did use the ingredients for the milk mixture that you pour on top and I followed one of the reviewers suggestion to remove the skin on the top of the cake while its warm to make absorption of the liquid easier.  I also made a fruit topping of blueberries, mango's and strawberries, dressed in honey and lime juice, which I served on the side (not everybody likes fruit).  I know that it almost isn't even the same recipe, but it worked out so well that I wanted to let everyone know that there is an easier, quicker way to make this.  The cake was an absolute HIT at the party I brought it to.  People even went back for seconds!

Awesome!  I used this recipe because I couldn't find mom's.  Now this is my recipe.    I got rave reviews from all the guests including my sister-in-law who asked me to bring it to her Cinco de Mayo party.    This cake is easy to make and quick (1 hr from when I start mixing to when is out of the oven including cleaning up the kitchen).  The second time around I made the following changes and it came better than the first time:     Beat the egg whites and stir them into the mix (sugar, butter, egg yolks) before the flour, then add the flour 1/8 cup at a time.  My Kitchen Aid mixer was on the next to lower speed to do the stir.   With a serrated knife (I used a bread knife), remove the thin layer from the top of the cake before pouring in the milk.  It absorbed the liquid quick and didn't have to sit overnight, only about 6 hrs in the fridge.  I cut the whole milk to one cup (from two because it was all I had in the house).  The milk mixture was a little thicker and the guests loved that.

This cake was absolutely delicious!!!  It was my first time making tres leches and it was so easy!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I used a boxed vanilla cake mix and used a tub of fat free whipped topping instead of making my own whipped cream.  I omitted the the whole milk and instead used a can of coconut milk.  Also I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and fat free evaporated milk.  I had no problems with there being too much liquid, in fact some parts were still dry after it sat in the fridge overnight.  I probably just didn't poke enough holes in the cake.  Finally on top of the whipped topping I added fresh strawberries and canned pineapple chunks.  The pineapple was a fantastic addition, it went perfectly with the coconut milk in the cake!  All in all this tres leches was delicious and my Mexican friends loved it!!  I will definitely make this cake again!!!

when i poured all that liquid on top, i said "ummmmm...." and put it in the fridge for an hour or two- i really didnt think it would all absorb but it did and it was perfect- not to dry, not too wet. other tres leches recipes ive made could never get the consistency right. you can flavor the whipped cream however you like, i used imitation rum flavoring. SO GOOD. glad i lost my old staple tres leches recipe cause this one is better!!

This has got to be my families favorite recipe on here. They absolutely love it. At first I would make the whipped topping myself but now I just by the ready made kind and its much easier and faster and tastes just as good. My family and I love this cake REALLY WET so we add lots of liquid and use a seringe to make sure that the whole cake is soaked with all that goodness. I have also made this into a Cuatro Leches (4 Milk Cake) by topping it with Dulce de Leche (Caramel) instead of the whipped topping and its to die for. They sell it canned at your local grocery store, its called La Lechera Dulce de Leche by Nestle (1 can covers the whole cake).

Disclaimer: If you do not like ULTRA sweet cakes, this is NOT for you! I had never made Tres Leches, so I was not aware of how intensely sweet it would be. It is a very delicious cake and easy to make, but next time I am absolutely going to cut down on the sugar. I would recommend cutting the sugar for the whipping cream in half because the sweetened condensed milk already gives it enough. I made the cake the night before, poured the milk over it early morning, chilled it covered in the refrigerator all day and a few hours before dinner added the whipped cream, and chilled it again. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, and added coconut shavings to the top. This added very good flavor.

I tried this cake out for my fiance. I thought at first the cake came out too firm. Then when i added the milk mixture i thought, "OH NO, this is too much milk, WHAT do i DO!!??" So i was freaking out cuz there was so much milk on the surface, so i began to swirl the pan around so the milk can continue to be absorbed. Anyways to  make this short, the milk finally got absorbed, a little milk was left but i just poured it over each slice we ate. YUM. LOVE IT!!!! love it too much though,, ate half the pan..haha. Will definately do this again...just after i lose the extra pounds i gained..haha. DELICIOUS!

I've made this twice and gotten rave reviews every time! I followed others' advice and 1. separated the eggs before mixing; and 2. reduced the amount of sugar used in the topping to about 1/4 or 1/2 c. Also, poke LOTS of holes. Don't be scared to pour ALL of the milk - especially if you've poked lots of holes. This cake is moist but not too mushy, and has a good flavor. I'm not wild about the consistency of the cake, but I think that's because of all the eggs in it. It's still a yummy cake and I will make it again!

So good! Got rave reviews from everyone who ate it. I was worried people would think it tasted like soggy cake, but they really liked it! I followed the recipe's ratios exactly, but used 2% milk, low-fat evaporated milk, and Cool Whip to make it a tad healthier. :)  Enjoy!

A group of us tasted this delicious cake a few month ago while vacationing in Puerto Vallarta.  We fell in love with it and wanted to duplicate the recipe when we got home.  There were many recipes to  choose from, but I think I chose the perfect one!!  Everyone raved about this cake and thought it was better than the one served in Puert Vallarta.  I used coconut milk in place of regular milk and double the whipping cream topping. Yummy!!

I made this cake with my girlfriend for our families and it came out great! The whipped cream was especially tasty. I did feel as if the cake itself was not sweet enough, but other than that it was an amazing recipe. I'm craving it right now just thinking about it. I come from a Cuban family that loves tres leches, and they approved so you know it's good. One piece of advice though: pierce the cake A LOT with a fork before pouring the milk all over it like the recipe says. If you think it has enough holes, it doesn't, so pierce it some more.

WOW, JUST INCREDIBLE 10 STARS ********** Made 2 cakes a day ahead ~ COOL WHIP TOPPED. Both less sugar to 3/4 Cup, 1/4 Cup less whole milk, separated the yolks & beat whites, nicely folded in (Alternating) Flour & Whites. (While the cake bakes in oven, put together the sweetened condensed & evaporated & whole milk in Pour-able mixing bowl). Have Fork/Skewer ready when cake is done baking, IMMEDIATELY & QUICKLY poker your cake a lot, the edges & all-throughout. QUICKLY ADD THE MILK MIXTURE to poked cake so that it absorbs easily since it's warm. Let Cool. Then put in fridge until it's Cold. COOL WHIP TOPPED ENTIRELY ~ Put back in the fridge (we love it chilled) until you can Enjoy it!(We have known some folks to leave this cake out to room temp. as well, so whatever your preference)  We loved the 2nd cake too +24 hours later, all the flavors mingled, it was Just So Much More Incredibly Delicious, Enjoy MUCH!!

I have had tres leche from Latin bakeries several times. This recipe seemed a lot different than those. The cake seemed to have too many eggs. A real strong egg flavor. I did seperate the eggs and beat the whites like others recommended. I dont know if it made a difference since I never made it the other way. I would recommend making sure you have the cake batter perfectly even, when you spread it before you bake it. Otherwise the milk sits in certain spots.  Also, I glazed strawberries and placed them on top of the whip topping. IT seems as though every place I have ever had it from has done that. MAkes it look really nice and professional.  I brought this to work. I work with a lady from Honduras and a lady from Mexico. They both liked it, but one said it was like cheese. ?? The other Lady said it was really good and had a couple of pieces.

Amazing!  Such a great recipe!!  It tastes better than the Tres Leches at our favorite Mexican Restaurant.  My only suggestion...pay special attention to the directions.  I accidentally added both cups of sugar to the cake and didn't realize my mistake until I started making the topping which uses the second cup of sugar.  Needless to say, I now have two cakes in our fridge...one extra sweet and one that is just perfect!! :)  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

What a treat, although a bit sweet. I followed the directions and it was a great hit. I made sure my butter and eggs were room temperature.  After creaming the butter and sugar, I added the eggs slighltly beaten, on at a time. Additionally, I waited for the cake to cool, poked about 200 holes in the cake with a bamboo skewer and poured on the milk mixture and put the cake in the fridge.  The liquid absorbed within 1.5 hours and I then added the whipped cream topping and let it sit overnight. I topped it with fresh rasberries and it was a sucess.

At first I was dissapointed with this cake, because it seemed bland the first day.  Then the second day it was really good, and today the third day, the cake is the best thing i have ever had.  The key is to let the cake refrigerate a couple days so everything soaks in.  I was scared that the ingredients called for too much liquids but like i said by the second day everything was soaked up and perfect.  Oh- and for anyone making this cake for the first time, the batter is going to be think and i was worried the pan suggested was too big but once you put the whipped topping on and everything it is just right.  And the cake will come out thicker and more dense (it's ment to be that way).  Just add all the liquids and it will be moist by day 2.

I have made this cake many times for one of my coworkers.. I personally don't like the taste or texture of the recipe but this recipe has been requested many times. I used it for her wedding cake yesterday with my strawberry mousse and butter cream frosting. I do cut the milk recipe in half because she didn't want an extremely soggy cake. I like to add 1/8 teaspoon or two drops of coconut Loranne oil to the milks it adds that extra special touch. You can also substitute coconut milk for  part of the milk mixture if you can't find coconut extract. If you are looking for a sturdy cake recipe and like tres leches give this recipe a try you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a light airy cake then this ones not for you.

This cake was DELICIOUS. It was very simple to make, and I actually used fat free ingredients (and substituted applesauce for butter), which did not affect the taste at all.  The only thing I have to say is that I ate the cake about 3 hours after making it and it tasted a bit eggy then, but when I ate it the day after, it was absolutely PERFECT. By then, all the milk seems to have absorbed better and there's no hint of eggy-ness. So wait a few hours if you want to avoid that taste!

My husband loves Tres Leches cake and requested I make one for him. It took me two weeks to muster up the courage to make one, because the recipes I found looked daunting.  This recipe was nice and straightforward...and I'm glad I read the reviews before I started! Knowing the batter was supposed to be thick and the milk mixture would look like it was too much for the cake to absorb was comforting when it came to pass that the reviews were correct. I followed the recipe almost exactly - I used two 9 inch round pans instead of the 9 x 13 pan. Only thirty minutes after placing the cake in the fridge, all the milk had been absorbed into the cake and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.  This cake is *perfect*...not too sweet but very delectable with some strawberries on top. I will definitely make this cake again for hubby, and maybe I'll share it with friends too. ;)

Being from Miami, Tres Leches is one of my favorite desserts. This recipe is as authentic tasting as it gets! I did make some minor subtle changes like substituting 1% milk for whole milk. Also, I used 2cups of cream and added 1/2 cup more sugar to the topping, perfect amount! For more authencity, this has to be made in a disposable foil cake pan topped with marsachino cherries!

I think most of these negative reviews must be from people who have never had a real tres leches cake before. I made the mistake of beating the egg whites like many reviewers suggested and my cake came out light and fluffy (not a tres leches cake). It is supposed to be very dense almost like a corn bread, not light and fluffy. If you follow the recipe you will get a great tres leches cake, not a typical light and fluffy cake.

I like the fact that this cake is milky and mushy because I think regular cake is dry and dull.  But, my goodness it is sweet!  It tasted just like eating a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk.  You can't eat more than 2 bites.  I would suggest using store bought whipped cream rather than using the heavy cream because it just added to the sweetness/heaviness of the cake.  The "whipped" heavy cream turned out runny and mixed together with all the other milks making it even more sweet than it needed to be.

I had a Tres Leche cake from a bakery in Austin TX  for my birthday.  It was so good and moist that I wanted to find a recipe similar to it.  I made this cake yesterday and refrigerated it overnight.  It is actually better than the bakery cake.  I beat the egg whites and the yolks before mixing, used half and half instead of whole milk, otherwise the same.  I bought Redi Whip for the whipped cream, put it on last night and it pretty much soaked into the cake. So next time I will put it on just before serving.  This is a wonderful, wonderful and easy cake, and I have been baking at least 50 years.
Thank you so much.

I don`t know what exactly but something was wrong with this recipe for me. I have made it for two times and I had the same problem. When I poured the milk mixture over the cake ( I poked the cake before), the cake absorbed only half of this mixture, but half just layed on the top. The cake inside wasn`t moist at all. It was absolutely dry. I guess the dough is very heavy and thick here to absorb the milk mixture. I made Brazilian style moist coconut cake from this site (it is the same way moist cake and I made it perfect thanks to suggestions) and this cake always turn out really moist. That dough is more fluffy and absorbs the liquid perfectly. I read reviews, many people loved this cake and it turned out for them, but after two attempts I can give only this rating.

This cake was an absolute hit with my entire family!  That's saying a lot, too, as they're staunch Mainers who like their "standard" Northeastern US desserts, so a wet cake was really pushing it in my opinion.  Still, they all had seconds and thirds and even asked me for the recipe!  My only modifications when I make this again will be halving the milk syrup mixture as I ended up with a lot of extra pooling in the pan, which made it difficult to transport.  I also used about half of the sugar called for in the whipped cream topping because I prefer my whipped cream unsweetened so I compromised.  The cake was very sweet so I feel it balanced it out.  I tried dusting some baking cocoa over the top of a piece - yummy!  (And can I just say I am shocked that someone would put Cool Whip on top of a cake like this, bleurgh.)  Very simple, very delicious, and definitely something I'll make again for a special occasion.  My son declared it his new favorite food!  :)

This is a great recipe if you like cold touch in your desserts. With 9*13 inch pan, the cake did not come out thin at all.At first, the milk seems too much but it absorbs and keeps the cake moist. Next time, I will try to replace 1 cup of milk with rom or brandy. It might give a nice flavor to the milk taste.

Maybe i did not do this one correctly, because it was just too wet for me. Also, the topping was not what I would have expected. I'll need to taste it from someone who knows what it's supposed to taste like before I can say I like it.

This is delicious! I added Kahlua to the cake batter (1tsp) and Kahlua (2 tbsp) and chocolate syrup (2 tbsp) to the milk mixture. To cut down on fat, I used fat-free evaporated and sweetened condensed milk and used free Cool Whip. Also added 1/4 tbsp baking soda to flour mixture. Cake rose beautifully.

This cake was great. My whole family liked it. The base cake alone is delicious. The directions leave a bit to be desired. In place of the whole milk I used buttermilk. Great taste.

This cake turned out a little denser than I would have liked so I recommend using only 1 cup of heavy whipping cream for a lighter version.

This is an AMAZING recipe! My husband asked for it for his birthday. I've made this cake several times, and it's always very popular. Definitely use a 9x13 pan; it seems like there isn't enough batter, but the cake needs to spread over a large surface area so it can absorb all the liquid. If you use a smaller pan, the top of the cake will be dry and too much liquid will seep out the bottom. I followed the recipe as directed.

I love this recipe (tres leches cake is my favorite) I made it in a 9 inch springform pan and it was just the right size and thickness, then I frosted it with whipped cream that was stabilized with unflavored gelatin, it never became runny or watery.

Very good.  Got lots of compliments.  I poked a lot of holes  and poured the milk mixture while the cake was still warm,  and all the milk was absorbed immediately.  For the frosting, i only used 1/4 cup of sugar b/c 1 cup of sugar is too sweet for me.

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times since finding it here on Allrecipes.com. I have to admit when I'm in a hurry, I just make a boxed white cake and follow the remaining directions. I don't skip on the real whipped cream though.  Using the boxed cake can really save time when you're in a hurry.

This recipe is so good and I don't even like Tres Leches at restaurants.  My husband has me make this recipe on his birthday every year!  He's hooked.  It's very easy and people are quite impressed, they can't believe you made this dessert.  It's very fresh, which really makes it stand out from the restaurant version.

This cake is amazing! Definitely let it sit in the fridge overnight so all the milks can seep into the cake because there was a big difference in the way the cake tasted the day I made it and the day after. I tried it an hour after I made it and the cake tasted more eggy but after letting it sit overnight the cake tasted just like a store bought tres leches cake. Absolutely perfect cake, will definitely make again.

Perfect! I live in Los Angeles which is rich in Mexican/latina culture. This cake is spot on. So much so, that my Mexican 70 year old neighbor devoured some of the pieces I gave him. Not sure why others had a problem with the amount of liquid because I followed the recipe and had no issue. I allowed the cake to soak in the milks and then waited to add the whipped cream topping before serving. 

Sidenote: it smells SO delicious while baking!

It was so good! I did make some changes to it, I did  not add the evaporated milk. I just did 1 cup milk, 1 cup whipping cream and one can condensed milk. I split that between two round cakes. I did think it was not as wet as I liked so next time I will all a little more but it was great! My mother makes this cake all the time and she adds rum to it as well.

I couldn't wait to make this!  Tres Leches is my favorite cake in the world.  First ate it in a Nicaraguan restaurant in Metairie LA many years age, and I've been eating it whenever possible ever since.  I, too, thought it must be very difficult, so I never even looked for a recipe.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU for my chance to have a little bit of heaven at home!

This may be a 5 star version. I made this for my coworkers and I work in a Mexican Restaurant and it went over very very well...It was very very sweet...in my opinion next time I'm going to cut down the sugar in the whipped cream because it doesn't need a full cup.

I bake all the time but the calculations for the cake was ALL WRONG...and the whipped cream was too sweet, instead of adding 1 cup of sugar to the whipping cream only add 1/2 a cup of sugar to the whipping cream.

My daughter tried this dessert at a restaurant and has been asking me to make it ever since.  Tried it the other day and she loved it just as much.  Her new favorite cake! I also used reduced fat milks because that is what I usually have in the pantry, and they worked just fine.

I needed a "Latin" dessert for a theme party.  I was very nervous because I've never heard of this cake before...much less eaten it.  I gave it a try based on all the great reviews.  All I can say is UH....MAY......ZING!!!  I will be making this many many more times in the future!  I followed the advice in various reviews by adding 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the cake mix, using 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the milk, pouring the mixture on the cake when it's hot out of the oven, and using Cool Whip on top after it's cooled down instead of real whipping cream (this was just for simplicity - I'm sure the real whipping cream is delicious).  I am in love with this cake!  My new favorite dessert.  Don't be nervous about pouring all the liquid on the cake, it looks like way to much at first but it soaks into the cake like a sponge, right before your eyes. And it's true what everyone says about it being even better the next day.  I just had some with my coffee for breakfast.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you to the original poster of this recipe.

I just made this cake and am VERY disappointed with the recipe.  There was WAY to much milk mixture the cake just floated in it.  Maybe the instructions are not correct - I read and re-read and followed them exactly as written.  My family usually devours my desserts but they did not like this and almost the whole pan is still sitting in my fridge after 3 days.

I wanted to make an authentic cake for my husband's Mexican fiesta themed birthday.  I had never made or even tasted Tres Leches cake before so I was nervous.  But as my Mexican friend told me, it was "perfect."  In fact it was so good that my husband and his buddies were talking about it the next day!  My advice is, don't panic (like I did) if the batter is more like a dough.  The denseness of the cake meant it stood up to being soaked in all that milk.  A delicious recipe.  I'll definitely make it again and again.

I am 100% Mexican and have always had tres leches cake but never attempted to make it until this weekend for a Cinco de Mayo party (yes, in April HA!).  There were a lot of Latin people present (not just from Mexico but Venezuela, Panama, Dominican Republic, Honduras and Guatemala) EVERYONE agreed this cake was the bomb!  Thank you for the very GREAT recipe.  Oh, I must say I didn't change a single thing and it was phenomenal!!!!

Awesome! My boyfriend made this for my 40th birthday this weekend and it was a huge hit with everyone. We followed the recipe exactly and soaked the cake overnight before frosting.  This cake was perfect and at least five people have emailed me for the recipe.  I use all recipes constantly and this is one of the very best recipes I've ever found on this site.  Simply amazing.

This recipe was great.  Here's a tip though - instead of whipping the cream and adding white sugar, add confectioners sugar.  I usually add quite a bit because I like it sweet, but start with a cup and add more to taste.  the cake was great.  I even tinted the cake with green food coloring since I made it for Christmas.

My parents tried this dessert at a restaurant, told me about it and I looked it up on allrecipes.com. They said that it's pretty close to what the restaurant served. I've made it 2 times and have gotten compliments both times, and requests for the recipe.

This recipe was great! I did however get confused with the ingredients list. It says 2 cups of milk, but it doesn't say what kind, until you get to the instructions. So I figured that I could use 2% or whichever milk I choose, it didn't necessarily have to be Whole Milk. And with using 2% milk and fat free evaporated milk things turned out just fine!

The cake turned out well but I would use a smaller baking pan because the cake was kind of thin. I had to cut it in two and i placed one part on top of the other. The cake is a little dense, but it is necessary in order for it not to crumble when the liquid is added. I was not impressed with the cake once i took it out of the pan. Once i poured the milk mixture ( having poked the cake with a fork all around earlier) i placed it in the fridge. After a few hours i added the whipped topping and strawberries.  I served it to a couple of friends and they were impressed. After I tried i was impressed myself, the taste was wonderful and it had just the right amount of liquid. Somebody even asked me if i bought it at the store. Even though the cake was cut in half , noboby even noticed...after the liquid was added it was impossible to tell. I got a small rectangular slightly tall cake but the flavor was perfect.

My cake came out eggy and poundcake-ish. a very thick and nonporous texture. maybe i overbeated it. i'm pretty sure it'll keep it's shape though. i even left it soaking overnight and the center is sorta dry and i had to pour excess liquid out bc it was basically floating. overall taste was good but wasn't pleased with the texture. will try again but this time seperate eggs and beat egg whites and fold it in.

I have never made this cake before so I followed the directions exactly.  I offered to make this cake for a Spanish luncheon at work.  There was a man there who lived in Mexico who said this cake was the closest he has ever tasted to the authentic Tres Leches in Mexico.  So, if you don't have time to go to Mexico and have Tres Leches, this may be as close as you get!  (By the way, it is suppose to be wet and served cold)

It turned out tasting better than I had expected. About 150ml of the milk-mixture was left behind after the soaking. It didn't all soak in completely because my cake came out higher in the centre and lower around the edges - hence the milk-mix tended to sit mainly on the lower edges of the cake. To avoid this in future, I'll try making a "hollow" in the centre of the cake dough before placing the tin in the oven. I saved the excess milk-mix in a covered jug in the fridge and served it with each slice of cake. I decorated my cake with chocolate chips (chocolate shavings would be great too) plus 300g of mixed summer berries. They made the cake look lovely, like a sort of "black forest" cake. I also used 1/2 c. sugar instead of 1 c. for the icing/topping. This is a good, easy cake recipe to follow. I didn't bother separating the yolks from the whites and whipping them separately - too time-consuming, and besides, the cake tastes good even if eggs weren't separated before mixing. The amazing thing about this cake is that the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it tastes!! I made this cake for the first time this Easter, and I'll definitely make it again when I have time to bake another cake! Me and my husband finished most of it in 3 days.

I've made this cake 3 times and I absolutely love it!!! It is by far my favorite cake!!! It does taste much better after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, however. I've found it is a big hit with some people and other people absolutely hate it...the only reason, however, is that some people are texture-oriented and don't like the idea of cake being soggy...so if you don't like soggy cake...other than that I've gotten tons of compliments when I make it. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

This is absolutely the best and easiest recipe for tres leches I have seen.  I too have a few suggestions.  Instead of poking holes in the layers so the milk will be absorbed, I slice off just the very top of the crust.  This allows the milk to be absorbed nore quickly and thoroughly.  I also like to add fruit between the layers and top the whole cake with whipping cream.  Our favorite is pineapple rings with cherries in the centers, though strawberries or peaches work well also.

This recipe is the easiest, but it does need some changes. For one, 2 cups of sugar, I think is too much for the cake because the syrup already gives the cake its sweetness. Also, the syrup mixture that one would pout on the cake is too much. Only use about 1 1/2 cups of it. Overall, I think if I would've made those changes when I first made this cake, it would've turned out better. Don't get me wrong though, this is a very good recipe :) I would definitely recommend trying this out.

THIS CAKE WAS GREAT.  IT WAS THE SAME CAKE I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL TIME.  I ALSO FOUND SEVERAL OTHER RECIPES FOR THIS CAKE ON THE INTERNET. THIS WAS THE BEST ONE, HOWEVER ONE ALL THE OTHER CAKES, AFTER POURING THE MILK MIXTURE OVER THE CAKE LET IT SET FOR AN HOUR AND THEN POUR THE REST OF THE LIQUID OFF. I DID THIS AND IT WAS THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER EATEN.

I'm so disappointed with this cake. I was very picky and careful I'm choosing which recipe to use. I poured the batter and immediately knew it was too thick. After baking it was hard and flat. Still being optimistic I poured the milk mixture and refrigerated overnight. The milk didn't absorb and it was awful. 
I'm so upset I wasted my only eggs and milk!

I made this but it really was too much liquid. Maybe this is how it is supposed to be but I felt like it was too much milk. There was so much that the cake was literally floating in it. Everything else was great and tastes amazing though.

I made it as a Birthday Cake. I decorated it with strawberries instead of the cream mix. They were  all begging for more LOL.
I followed the advice of one of the people that commented, I whipped the yoke and the egg whites and it came out much better than the fist time I followed the recipe. Thank you for sharing

This is one of THE MOST DELICIOUS cakes I have ever baked!!! Thank you for an amazing recipe. It was a big hit at home and work. A few tips from my baking experience... 1) Add 1/4 tsp baking soda to the dry ingredients to help the cake rise really well. 2) When you mix the wet ingredients, add the eggs one at a time and beat well after each one. (I did not need to separate the eggs to get the cake to rise.) 3) Try letting the cake cool in the pan for an hour, then transfer it to a sheet pan. THEN poke holes in it after it's cooled. I used a wooden skewer and poked about 50 holes. Poke all the way to the bottom of the cake. Pour the cream mixture gradually over the cake. When it collects in the sheet pan, drain it into a bowl and start over. Takes a little time, but your cake will be really moist. 4) Let it sit overnight if you have the time. That also makes the cake super moist. 5) Use a little less sugar in the whipped cream if this is kind of rich for you. Fruit on top also adds a nice flavor and cuts the sweetness. TRY THIS RECIPE!!! It's incredible. :)

I made this cake for a family in our church who only speak Spanish and the rest of us don't. They look at some of the foods we have on the coffee table/coffee hour after church. I actually made three of these cakes at the same time because I knew of two other people who are Hispanic and speak Spanish also. I gave the cake to the family who cried with joy, the other two people were pleased greatly. The wife asked me for the recipe, it was a lot better than her mother in laws and she wanted to serve it to friends that were coming in town. I tasted the cake and loved it. I am diabetic so only had a forkful. It got raves from everyone. WOW! Ten stars

This recipe is FABULOUS!!! I followed the recipe to the 'T' and it was perfect! Although I do not like Tres Leches, but my boyfriend-who's from Mexico-LOVED it!! He's could not get enough of this. He asked me to make it again...and again! The second time, I added walnuts to the cake and will add them to the topping, as well.
I did add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each one. Other than that, the recipe was flawless!!
THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! It is a definite keeper!!

Made this as part of Thanksgiving dessert for my fiancé's family in Miami. Everybody said it was the best tres leches they have ever eaten! I used skim milk instead of whole and only put 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup in the whipped cream. It was still very rich and creamy. The amount of liquid is perfect. It was just enough to be fully absorbed with no dry spots. We just ate it yesterday and people are already asking me to make it again!

I made this for the birthday of a friend at work. I found the recipe easy and quick. It got RAVE reviews! I made a few simple changes - I added 1/2 tsp salt; used 1 tsp vanilla in the cake (instead of the 1/2); separated the eggs, whipped the whites and folded them in (based on other reviews); the whole milk I bought was 14 ounces (instead of 16 ounces); and I used 2 cups of whipping cream with 2/3 cup of sugar (plus the vanilla) for the topping. Of the people who tried it, everyone LOVED it, but I got the most pleasure from the reviews of the Latinos. They thought it was better than a local restaurant's version. It is a definite keeper. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This cake turned out great! I did however make a change to the whipped cream as many other reviewers did, I halved the amount of sugar. Even then I personally thought that the whipped cream was too sweet, so if anyone is like me and ends up leaving half the frosting on the plate most of the time I would actually try only about 1/4 cup of sugar in the whipped cream. Also I checked the cake at 22 minutes and it was already done (I know every oven cooks differently but thank goodness I checked it early because there isn't much batter and the pan is kind of large).

My Cince de Mayo party guests went on and on about how good this cake was.  After all the spicy food this was a nice "cool down".  Perfect fiesta recipe because you make it ahead of time.   I used maple syrup to sweeten the whipped cream to taste with good results.  Not too sweet.  Thanks Stephanie!

Very good recipe. I never really cared for this type of cake but I decided to make one for my husband. Now I'm hooked. I'cw made this cake a half a dozen times or so and everyone always loves it. This is a traditional hispanic cake and I'm not hispanic at all but all of my husband's family (he's from El Salvador) and friends want me to make this cake. Very good tres leche.

Good, but very heavy cake (especially, heavy on the tummy!).  The 2nd day the left over cake was flooded with milk.  It was like I had poured milk into the pan and the cake was sitting in milk.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be?  It was a good cake, but a little goes a long way.  This was my first time to make a Tres Leches cake and I doubt I will make another one.  Good cake, but there are so many excellent cake recipes out there, I'll probably just make one of those.

I am trying to find recipes that reminds my Salvadoran boyfriend of home. I made this and he loved it. I only have it 4 stars because i think the milk mixture you pour over the cake was to much. My cake did not absorb it all. I think I will try reducing the whole milk to 1 cup. Other than that it had a great taste.

Made the mistake of pouring the milk mixture while still hot.  :(  It was still very moist on the edges but too dry in the middle.  I will make this again.

In the words of Randy Jackson, "THIS CAKE IS THE BOMB" Followed the recipe and it came out delicious. I did not have any fruit to put on the top so I sifted a little cinnamon on it and it tasted great. I will be making this again real soon.

I went over the recipe a few time and I did everything exact and it still turned out work. The cake was really thick and so was the milk mixture so the cake soaking up the milk was a big bust. I ended up dumping half the milk mixture out and then of-course the cake was really dry. The whip topping was the only thing that turn out.

Followed the recipe almost exactly the same but added 1/4 tsp of baking soda to the flour mix to help it rise a little. I used a 9x13 baking pan and it didnt rise so much like a regualr cake but as soon as I added the milk/cream mixture it expanded and I think its a great size. Instead of whole milk I used half & half so it can be creamier. Before I added the milk/cream mixture I took a fork and pierced tons of holes in the cake so the liquid can absorb evenly in the cake. Now with the Whipped frosting don't add 1 cup of sugar, comes out WAY too sweet and I love sweet things. Next time I will add 1/2 cup. I felt like the extremely sweet whipped topping kind of took over the flavor of the tres leche flavor. Coming from a Latin family I have had tons of these in parties and this recipe taste just like those. Great Recipe!

Oh my goodness this brought tears to my eyes and a song to my heart. It was simply divine. The recipe is perfect in its dimensions. The only thing I substituted was I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar because that's all I had on hand. I added 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of the one in the cake mixture. It didn't effect the taste or texture. I made the recipe as specified without all the substitutions and changes other reviewers spoke about. Thank you Stephanie for submitting this recipe this one is a keeper.

Delicious! I refrigerated mine overnight and right before serving I added the Heavy Whipping Cream topping with only half the sugar. This was probably one of the easiest and tastiest desserts I’ve made yet. My husband had four servings at my Mother-In-Law’s birthday party. I love how the 3 milks soak through the cake and leave a little liquid at the bottom of the pan. I will be making this again and again!

OMG delicious!!  Not difficult to make at all.  I did separate the eggs as other tres leches cakes call for.  I beat the yolks with the sugar/butter mixture; whipped the whites and folded them into the batter.  The cake was not dense at all and created a "sponge" texture.  I still poked holes and took my time pouring the milk mixture over the top-it probably took me close to an hour!  I made it early in the day and by the time we ate it the milk was all soaked in.  I did not top it with whipped cream or meringue- and we didn't miss it.  I was lucky to have real Mexican vanilla which really added to the authentic flavor.  I also added a tsp of vanilla to the topping, as well as a dusting of cinnamon at the end.  I will make "3 Milks" cake very often!!

This recipe is crazy good. I don't like tres leche cake but I made this for my boyfriend and I tried a bit and it was delicious. But since a lot of people complained of its sweetness I omit the sugar in the whipping cream. And for future reference I might put 3/4 of a can of condensed milk. That flavor was a bit overwhelming.

First time I made this cake I followed it to a T and it was delicious, second time I made it I added a hint of almond extract to the batter and it came out even better. This is the best tres leches cake I've ever had!

So I have no idea what I did wrong, but the "filling" was EXTREMELY soupy.  The cake tasted good, but I drained off a good amount of the "filling."

I made this as written and the texture of the cake itself was not enjoyable to me. I made it again using a white cake mix (used 3 whole eggs but beat the whites separate then folded them in) and it was wonderful. Instead of whole milk I used half and half the second time. I served it with fresh strawberries. Three stars as written; five with my alterations.

I tried 3 of the 5 recipies for tres leches cake I could find on allrecipies. this one is definintely the best. probably folding in the egg whites makes the difference. very light and spongecake like. (another recipie turned out like a brick!) the only change I made was to add a few drops of almond extract to the batter and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. excellent results!! a great cake if like one thats not so sugary sweet.

This is my most requested dessert. I sometime double the cake portion for a thicker cake and reduce the sugar in the whipping cream because it is a little too sweet. I've also lightened the calories in this recipe by using reduced fat milk, reduced fat evaporated milk and using fat free whipped topping instead of whipping cream. I did it for someone on a Weight Watchers diet. It was still good just not as good as the original

This cake tasted good, but the amount of milk you poured on top made the bottom 1/3 of the cake very mushy, making it unappetizing.  If I make this cake again, I will use appx 1/3 of the combined milk to pour on top of the cake.

I made this cake day before yesterday. I have never made it before or ever tasted one. I followed the recipe to a "T" although it did seem like a lot of milk. Then I did something I was told never to do. I took a recipe that I have never tasted to a local Mexican restaurant and gave the cake to them to try. They loved it. (Or they told me they did) They wanted the recipe. Then they told me that I needed to make one for my husband and keep it for us. They did tell me that it was good the first day, but much better the second day. The woman I made it for only got one piece. But hey!!! I made it, they enjoyed it, and I am going to make this recipe again. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this cake and I am pretty sure I messed it up. I made the cake just like it said, and then I poked holes in it with a fork, and then poured the milk on it. But I ended up having to spoon milk off of it because it just wouldn't sink in. Did I do something wrong? Other than that, this cake was AMAZING!!!!!!

Great recipe - made it exactly as the recipe states the first time and it was really good.  The 2nd time, I used a can of cream of coconut rather than heavy cream  in the mixture poured over the cake, and then once I frosted it with unsweetened whipped cream, I sprinkled toasted coconut on top of the whipped cream.  For coconut lovers, the coconut version was absolutely wonderful - and the unsweetened whipped cream helped relieve some of the sweetness of the cake.   This is a versatile recipe for those who like to play.

I love tres leches cake and this was the first time I have made it...I thought it was much more complicated than it is.  Great flavor...I think I would like to play around and add some flavoring to the whipped topping or try layering.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used a white cake mix as recommended by others and cut the whole milk by 1/2 cup. I added some hazelnut flavoring and cinnamon. The flavor was outstanding, however it came out a little too wet for me. The pieces of cake were so wet they didn't stay together and rather than delicious cake I had delicious mush. I think next time I will cut back on the filling more significantly. I think I will also leave this in the fridge uncovered.

I LOVE this cake. My Brazilian friend made this cake for me and it was like eating a piece of heaven. I made it for my friends birthday and she and everyone there loved it. The recipe has been passed on and on each time a friend makes it they come back to me and tell me that it was a real hit. The only thing I did differently was added a little baking soda. The cake came out fluffy. It soaked up all the milks wonderfully. I sprinkled cinnamon on top like it shows in the main picture. Thanks Stephanie for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I'm pretty certain this is a great milk cake recipe. I made it with 1/2 the milk and it was good I did, it was still very wet. Not something that appealed to my family.

I had to make this a glutten free cake, so I used a glutten free, white cake mix.  I added the milk mixture when the cake was still warm and it sucked it up like a sponge.  We had it for dinner the next night and  WOW...it was great!  Everyone loved it and you would never know it was glutten free.  It sliced wonderfully, excellent tasting, easy to make, I wish I could give more stars!

I would make this in an 8x8 pan next time - it was too thin for a 9x13 and the extra milk made it very soupy.  I served with diced mango and blackberries.

The basic recipe is wonderful, but for those counting calories here are my modifications:  I made the basic cake recipe as is written, with the slight change that I did separate the eggs as suggested.  For the milk layer, I used 1 can of light coconut milk, 2% evaporated, and fat free sweetened condensed.  I only poured about half to 3/4 of the milk on the cake, and that seemed to be enough.  Moist, without being too rich.  I let the cake set over night and then topped with 1 can of crushed pineapple, covered that with a layer of fat free whipped cream and then sprinkled with strawberries and mandarin oranges.  Was a hit, and everyone appreciated the "lighter" version.

LOVED IT. I made it with just a white box mix and it came out super good. I also added in some cinnamon seasoning to the mix and it added some extra flavor! Hubby loved it too! Also the first time I ever made whip cream and the directions here are super easy. Will make again!

OMG! This was amazing! Everyone enjoyed it! It does taste like the original Honduran Tres Leches (this cake originated in Honduras but most Latin American countries serve this desert). The only change I would make would be to elimiate the 1 cup of milk. But overall this is the best recipe I have found. Thank you and enjoy!

This cake is absolutely delicious. I made this to a T and there's nothing wrong with this cake. It wasn't soggy, mushy, but I wish there was more milk at the bottom. We first had this at a Puerto Rican bakery and this one is 10000x's better.  I can't wait to make it again, with coconut milk, rum or almond extract. So many possibilities.

Made this last night. It was amazing! The only change I made was I baked it in a 9' pan and it rose nicely (with no modifications). As another reviewer suggested, I shaved off the top of the cake to help with the milk absorbance. The ratios and flavors were excellent. I added a little cinnamon to the whip cream and it was sooo delicious! Must try!

I baked 4 cakes for a 15th Anniversary Surprise Party for a crowd of 75 people. I used the recipe provided by Stephanie except that, I added 1/4 tsp of Baking soda along with 1 tsp of Baking powder. I also used 3/4 cup of sugar in the cake batter instead of 1 cup as the condensed milk & evaporated milk also have sugar. I used cool whip for topping instead of making it from whipping cream. The crowd just loved it & I had to share my recipe with them along with the Thank you notes. I'm posting the other pictures also here.

I have used this recipe many times and it is EXCELLENT.  Remember to use that fork and punch the cake at least 40-50 times to allow the milk to be completely absorbed.  If you don't use that fork, it won't soak in even if you leave in overnight.

This cake is good, but the best Tres Leches cakes I have ever made were made with good ol yellow cake mix and then the milks dumped on top!!!  Add some Mexican vanilla in when mixing the milks and then 1/3 to 1/2 cup of Rum an it is the best!!!  We get requests for this whenever invited to a party.  Also, make the day before so it can soak thru the night!!  This cake is the BEST after it has had a couple days to really soak up all the milks.  Of course, in my home, it's almost always gone before those few days are up!!!!!

Good cake and very easy to make. I poured half of the milk mixture on the cake (poked LOTS of holes with a fork) and then waited for it to soak in. Then I poured the rest of it on the cake.

I made this much easier and healthier. Use white cake mix and bake two 9-inch rounds. Poke holes on top of the cooled cakes with a fork. Mix 2 cups of 1% milk, 1can condensed milk, and 1 can 2% evaporated milk. Pour over cakes, cover with foil, and refrigerate. When ready to serve, layer one cake with light Cool Whip, stack on the second cake, and add another layer of cool whip. Throw some fruit on top like strawberries, bleberries, and raspberries. Done.

I made this cake to finish off a special Latin-themed dinner for my husband last night. Since it was just the two of us, I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan. After making the batter, I wasn't sure how the cake would turn out because it was a little on the thick side. After baking, though, it turned out very light and airy. I used skim milk instead of whole and it still turned out perfect. My husband (whose parents are from South America) absolutely loved it topped with a few strawberries. Will definitely make again!

I had never had this before, and made it for cinco de mayo.  It was delicious!  Perfect with Mexican food-- sweet and cold.  I made it almost exactly as called for, the only change being that I only used about 1/2 the can of condensed milk.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it. Thank you!

The taste of the milk sauce was superb. Here are my changes :
1) For convenience, I used a boxed super-moist yellow cake mix. 
2) I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder, 1 tsp almond essence and 1/2 tsp orange essence to the milk sauce.
3) I substituted 1 1/2 cups of half and half and 1/2 cup of whole milk for 2 cups of whole milk.
4) I added 2 tbsp of sugar to the milk sauce.
6) I made it the day before.
5) I served it with banana slices and whipped cream.
The end result was amazing - my bf, who is latin, loved it ! However, it is a calorie-dense cake and is heavy on the stomach because of all the milk-fat in it. Tastes much much better the day after, and when eaten cold with whipped cream and fruit. :)

I have already made this for 2 different crowds and received rave reviews both times. The more holes you poke the quicker the milks will soak into the cake. I was also concerned the density of the cake out of the oven, but once the milk has saturated the cake, it's very fluffy and moisted.

WHAT an AMAZING recipe! This cake was gone in no time and all of the guests RAVED about it. A Mexican friend suggested poking the cake with bamboo skewers before pouring the milks over, and the cake soaked everything up perfectly.

I made this cake for my friend's surprise 40th birthday party.  It was a Miami/Cuba theme as she is Cuban and her family flew in for the occasion.  Everyone LOVED it!  This is coming from people that have ate Tres Leches cakes all their lives!  It was pretty easy to make and again, they all loved it.  I made it in a 9 X 13 pyrex cake dish and let it sit with the milk mixture covered overnight in the fridge.  The next day I topped it with the whipped cream topping.  I followed the recipe exactly but did put carmel ice cream topping all over the top for decoration.  YUM!

This recipe got GREAT reviews, which is why I chose it.  I made this EXACTLY as was put.  The actual cake came out great.  It was thin but if it were thicker, it would take much longer for the milks to soak & keep in mind that the milks will make it thicker.  Everything came out great until I made the topping.  1 cup of sugar was too much.  Perhaps I didn't mix well but it was a lot of sugar.  I added it & when I tasted it, I had to dump it.  Also, it took forever for the milks to soak in.  HOURS! & I STILL had to dump some ounces out.  I recomment making this recipe a day before because you'll grow inpatiant waiting for it all to soak. & kept poking holes but nothing seemed to work.  I'd appreciate some tips on making it soak in faster.  Because it all came out great until the topping.  Next time, I will add half cup sugar & if it needs more, I will add more.  I will try again soon because it really is a great recipe.

I've been wanting to make this recipe for quite some time after having this cake at a local Mexican restaurant.  This recipe was very easy to make.  I did take the advice of others and reduced the amount of sugar in the whipped cream topping to about 1/2 cup.  I poked plenty of holes in the cake and the milk absorbed rather quickly, although next time I make it I will use all but about 1/4 cup of the milk mixture as there was some at the bottom of the pan that never soaked in.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect.

This is my husband's favorite cake.  The soggier the better!  However, the frosting was a little too sweet so I reduced the amount of sugar to just 1/3 cup, and it still tastes great.

The cake was a delicious hit at the dinner party! I gave it 4 stars because of the adjustments that had to be made. Not all of the milk was absorbed & I would use less milk in the future. I also used 1/2 cup sugar,as was suggested, for the whip cream & it was plenty sweet.

this is a very good recipe. I have a quick and delicious idea for the topping. It is 1 8oz tub of cool whip, 1 pkg of whatever flavor pudding you like (i.e. vainilla, chocolate,lemon), 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup powdered sugar. You mix the pkg of pudding with 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup powder sugar until blended then fold in the whipped topping. GOOOOD and easy!

This recipe is as close to the real thing as one might get. I would like to make a correction for all of your readers.
Tres Leches is a Nicaraguan cake, not Mexican. I give credit where it's due. Mexicans and other Latin American countries may have their own version, but I am Nicaraguan and would like to crear this fact for your readers. 
You might want to also try "Sopa Borracha" a typical Christmas dessert in Nicaragua.

I have never had a tres leches cake turn out as bad as this one did. I have a recipe that I normally use but I decided to try this one. My family actually felt sorry for me at my dad's b-day party and I had to promise to make another one the right way for mother's day. The reason that everybody says there is so much milk is because the cake isn't the right texture to soak it up--and way too eggy.

I made this recipe following all the instructions given, step by step. I found the texture to be a bit heavy, not really soft, It was extremely sweet, i would reduce the icing by 1/2 a cup. Also, no need to add ingredients separatly, like the flour, and eggs.

This cake has become a holiday staple at my house:  For Christmas, I substitute some Amaretto & Bailey's liqueurs with the milk and top with chocolate shavings.  Easter has fresh berries added as a garnish.  I made a chocolate version for my husband's birthday.  I love this recipe!

I had never heard of Tres Leches before, but was intrigued by how unusual the recipe was so I gave it a go.  Ohhh so nice!  I love it and my children (ages 6, 5, and 3) love it too.

I tried other recipes and yours is the best. If you do not like milky cake do not try this one. Oh by the way NO it is not too much liquid so if you want dry cake try a boxed brand and eliminate the milk, BUT HEY THIS IS THEEE ONE!!!!
I RECCOMMEND THIS ONE ANYTIME I HAVE THE CHANCE. PERFECT AND "TRIED AND TRUE". YOU WILL LOVE THIS.
THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND TASTE SO GOOD MARTI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The flavor is awesome! I love all the textures together and am really happy with it. I found the cake a bit wetter than I would like so will reduce the milks I pour over it next time. Will definitely make again. We served with strawberries but I think a sprinkle of cinnamon instead would also be great

I made it according to the directions, and it was a flop. It didn't rise. I added a can of evaporated milk, a can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 cups of whole milk. I had a cup of liquid that didn't get absorbed. I'll try it again, but I'll whip the egg  whites to add some lift, and I might add 1 cup of half and half instead of 2 cups of whole milk.

AMAZING end to our Cuban dinner. Recomend using your whisk attachment for your mixer and whisk on high for a full minute once all of the ingredients are together. This allows great air into your batter.

I am a caterer and made this cake yesterday for an event. My clients loved it! The ONLY thing I varied from the recipe is that I used RediWhip instead of the heavy whipping cream, which I had but didn't read the directions carefully.  I am making another today for family and friends. For all of you that say the cake was too wet, you need to make sure you let is soak. Takes several hours up to 24.  The liquid that remains after the cake is GREAT in coffee!

I made this for my boss. It is his favorite cake. I have never made this before so I followed the recipe to a T. I was very nervous but everybody raved over how good the cake was...which was a huge compliment considering the are from Central America. I was asked to make it again. So I will be using this recipe for all of my tres leches requests.

AMAZING!!! made the recipe exactly as written and everyone loved this cake! i added some cocoa powder and banana slices to the top and voila fabulous! When the recipe states to stab with a fork then stab away... my cake had so many holes in it and it took about 5 mins for the milk to be absorbed... (i did lift the edges of the cake a bit to help) such a great recipe will make 100 times over and over! i did cut down on the toppings sugar to 1/3 a cup and it helped quite a bit.. some cakes are way to sweet but this one was spot on perfect! thanks so so so so much for this recipe!

The best cake I've made, I used less milk than recipe. Equal amounts of condensed milk, evaporated and whole milk but only poured half of it on the cake otherwise the cake becomes too soggy for my liking. I also used icing sugar in the whipping cream and only about 5 table spoons, I would add the sugar until your happy with the sweetness before whisking. Finally reduced the oven temperature and increased baking time for fan assisted oven.

Wonderful recipe! Just tried it today and we love it. It came out great. We used an extra can of condensed milk since we only used 3/4 cup of sugar for the cake recipe. We will never buy tres leches cake again. It is so much better than both restaurant and store bought. Thanks a lot, Stephanie!

This was not only a first-time recipe for me, but the first time I'd had Tres Leches Cake! I baked it for a party and got raves (not a crumb remained), including from Hispanic colleagues.

I took other reviews seriously, plus added a tweak of my own. As recommended, I beat one (whole) egg at a time, very well. Some claimed that the cake didn't absorb well so wanting to ensure a "thirsty" result, I substituted ¼ c. of WHITE whole wheat flour (very mild in flavor) for a similar amount of AP flour. I thoroughly poked the hot cake immediately to release steam, let it cool COMPLETELY, and poured off the excess milk and re-added it (1X). The very well-done cake had shrunk from the sides of the pan but conformed perfectly soon after the milks (42 oz!) were added (another 1 - 2 oz. of whole milk would've been no problem). The cake rested (covered) in the refrigerator for a good 8 hours before frosting. While I realize TLC is probably meant to be extremely sweet, even halving the called-for amount of the topping's sugar was overkill+. In future: a whole pint (1 ½ c. was skimpy) of cream, no sugar, and perhaps some Dr. Oetker "Whip it" for stabilizing. I also used a high-quality aluminum (Magic Line) 12 (not 13) x 9 x 3" pan for a deeper cake with 3 #7 flower nails, baked for 35 minutes, and HIGHLY recommend Argo baking powder (similar to Bakewell Cream BP).

I literally hated Tres Leches cake until I tried this one!  I follow the recipe exactly except I do an extra 1/2 batch of the topping.    I get requests for this cake all of the time.  Super easy to make and so unbelievably delicious!!

This is not the best tres leches cake I've tasted, but it is very good. It was easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it. I think it tastes best eaten the day it's made, after sitting in the fridge a few hours.

My friend has made tres leche cake before, and I fell in love with it. I decided to make my own, and my first problem was the amount of liquid. Way too much! I was expecting it to soak or something, so I let it sit a while but nothing happened. The whipped cream couldn't spread because there was so much liquid and it was just slopping around. The whipped cream was way too sweet. I recommend reducing the amount of sugar put into the whipped cream. Then I ate it, and was incredibly disappointed. It tasted nothing like my friend's. and it was fairly dry and hard on the inside! Even with the liquid. Maybe I did something wrong, but overall it was terrible.

This was my first attempt at making a Tres Leches cake, and I see no need to try any other recipe! Fantastic, delicious, and it got rave reviews! Folks said it was the best they ever had. :) I made it exactly as written, except I forgot to let the cake cool before pouring the milks over. I did that while it was hot. It turned out AMAZING!

I followed the directions exactly, but this cake was way too soggy and milky. I'm very disappointed since I heard such good things about Tres Leches cake. I'm going to try a different recipe with less milk.

I followed the recipe along with all preparation steps exactly.  I found the cake soaked up all the liquid within a few minutes. I put many fork holes in it. I also precut the entire cake.  Once the liquid soaked in, I put on the topping. 

Two things about this recipe - The topping is my only complaint with this recipe. I will have to try some different things next time, perhaps less sugar.  I also think 30 min in the 9x13 pan is too long. Perhaps 5 minutes less. But, overall, it came out really well.  

I've added a photo so you can see for yourself how it looks!

Made as written. This was VERY soupy. Maybe it's supposed to be.  Over a cup too much milk concoction. Not enough cake to soak it all up. I served with Vanilla Caramel Ice cream. I think it would've been better with half the milk mixture. The milk floating around the sides was just not appealing to me. I guess the flavor was ok. Used Pwd. Sugar instead of regular.

I made this for a Mexican themed birthday party.  I read the reviews that said to separate the eggs, so I did that, and I beat the whites until stiff peaks formed and folded them into the batter.  It certainly didn't hurt anything to follow those instructions.  It produced a nice sponge cake.

The finished cake got rave reviews.  Some people asked me if I was of Mexican descent, so props for authenticity.

I thought my husband was crazy when he asked me to make this cake - soaked in three milks? Huh? Alas, I found this recipe and he liked it. I toned down the sugar and milk a touch but other than that, he said it was great. Also advise to watch the cake because it browns very quickly.

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  I added a few drops coconut extract.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and beat the egg whites separately before adding them to the batter (sugar, butter, flour mixture, and egg yolks).  I baked in a smaller pan--8 x 11.5 I think.  WHEN I make this again, I think I'll cut back a bit on the sugar (maybe cut 1/2 from the whipped cream to start.)  Otherwise, this got rave reviews from my boyfriend and his entire family.

This is such a great cake!!! This is a traditional spanish cake for birthday's or special occasions in my husbands family. (they're from Honduras) we would always get it from a local bakery and it was pretty expensive. I found this recipe and saw how easy it was and really how cheap it is to make.. I made it for my husband to suprise him and ever since then I'm the one that makes the family cakes :)

This was delicious.  I took the advice of others and halved the sugar in the whipped cream topping and it was perfect.  Many rave reviews from friends, including those of latin descent.  I did sprinkle cinnamon on top, but after tasting it, I personally  prefer it without.

I read a ton of the reviews for this recipe prior to making it. Lots of good advice, but it started to get very confusing after a while. I read a lot about the "egginess," "sogginess." and "sweetness" of this cake so I altered the recipe accordingly. I used 3 egg whites and 2 whole eggs when making the cake. I used a straw and literally stabbed the cake to death. I halved the whole milk, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk for the milk mixture. I used the Joy of Cooking whipped cream recipe which calls for 1 cup whipping cream, 2Tsp sugar, and 1tsp vanilla extract. I sprinkled cinnamon on top and served the cake chilled at this year's Cinco de Mayo party. It was a hit!

I was not a fan of this, but not due to the recipe. I think I just do not like this type of cake. My husband however, loved it! I added strawberries and this made it more appealing to me. I think I will make it again, this time adding more strawberries throughout instead of just as topping.

This was the first time I made this cake, my son wanted me to try it so I did. I always read reviews to see what others have done to modify the original recipe.. I did follow one reviewers suggestion on cutting down the sugar and whole milk.. We don’t drink whole milk so I used 1% and only 1 cup of it.
For the topping I didn’t bother with the original recipe… what I did do was use 1- 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup of confectioners’ sugar, 1- 12 oz container of cool whip.. I creamed together the cream cheese and powdered sugar till light and fluffy then I added the thawed out whipped topping and mixed them till I had the thick consistency I wanted.
When I made the holes in the cake I found it easier to use a straw, some of the cake will be inside the straw but I just pushed it out. Once I mixed the “ tres leches”  instead of just pouring it into the holes I filled a bottle with a tip and just inserted the tip into the hole and filled it in.. It was so much faster that way especially since I used a bunt cake pan instead of a 9x13 pan.. 
This recipe is a keeper… Thanks for sharing…………

Very good, but much better the 2nd and 3rd day--the eggy flavor disappears, so make ahead. I was hesitant to use all that liquid, but it did work out right. I cut the sugar in the topping to less than half and it was plenty. I think I would increase the cream to 2 cups if I made again, since it was a thinner layer of topping than I remember in Mexico, which I liked better.

I have had a tres leche cake many times before which were mostly store bought but this time I decided to try it myself. I made this exactly how the original recipe states and it did not turn out! The cake was very dense and tasted like eggs. Once cooled I added the milk mixture, put it in the refrigerator. I tasted it and it was not how a typical tres leche cake should taste, light and moist.

this was a great recipe. the only thing I did different was use 1 cup of milk rather than 2. the evaporated and condensed milk mixed together give a carmel type flavor, adding too much of the whole milk waters it down (in my opinion). I also added a dash of cinnamon with the batter. This did it wonders. I served it for a dinner party and everyone was in love with it. next time i will try coconut milk and also seperating the egg whites from the yokes and folding them in.

This first time i ever had tres leches was from this restaurant called Porto's and it was AMAZING and i've been trying to find a way to replicate it ever since. I used Stephanie's recipe mainly as a general guideline. I took some time first to research and read what everyone else thought and gathered that adding just a little bit less than 1/2 a cup of sugar to the batter would help make it not too sweet. Also, using smart balance butter is a great alternative to using butter. You don't notice the difference at all except the tummy ache you usually get afterwards. I also don't like whole milk because it always makes everything too rich so I used vanilla silk soy milk instead along with the condensed milk and i used 2% evaporated milk for the filling and no one noticed the difference either. Everyone loved the cake but to me, it didn't taste authentic enough, just like the slice I had from Porto's. So the second time around I took the advice of using plain white vanilla cake mix for the batter and I used the same vanilla soy milk/condensed milk/2% evaporated milk mixture for the filling and it turned out PERFECT! and also Stephanie should have mentioned it's much much better to make frosting with confectioner's sugar not regular. If you have never made tres leches before make sure to research first! this is a great recipe to use as a guideline but if you want to make sure your tres leches is a hit, definitely use white vanilla cake mix for the batter instead!

I made this for Christmas party this year. I used heavy whipping cream instead of whole milk. I will make this again for sure.

i think this recipe is not a good one. the serving turned out to not be really 24. the texture was more of a pound cake and totally flat..when the tres leches cake is supposed to be more of a sponge cake-like. im not going to use this recipe again. but thanks for the recipe anyways. :D

This cake is easy to make. I  made it for the first time, let it sit overnight and added the whipped cream in the morning. It is good but I must say it is too sweet (for my taste-and i love sweet). Also, I think there was too much milk mixture, got a bit too soggy. But it might have been that the cake came out a bit flat or that this is how it has to be? I live in San Antonio, TX and have had tres leches locally here only a couple of times, but they've always been a bit drier. 
I would make this recipe again, for sure. Just would take out some sugar and have less milk mixture. I subsituted 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of non-fat milk (instead of 2 cups of whole milk) per someone's review here, because I don't have whole milk at home. I wish I had just left it 2 cups of non fat milk, because together with the evaporated milk and condensed milk, it comes out very rich.
 (I am not an expert of what a "real" tres leches should taste like-this review is only  based on my personal taste). 
 My 4 year old likes it!

5 Stars x 2...I just made this for my family including 3 picky eaters....WAO, they lOVED IT!!! After trying other recipes to make an authentic Tres Leches I found this recipe to be easy to follow, with at hand ingredients and a final product that is by far the best Tres Leche I've ever made. Thanks for sharing a great, simple and tasty recipe for the dessert lovers. I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect!!! Try it and enjoy....

To those who think that the cake will become "soupy" or "thin with liquid" are all wrong; clearly those people have never made a tres leches cake before. The cake will be saturated with the liquid and every crumb will absorb that liquid perfectly as you leave the cake to sit for hours. Don't worry, the texture only gets better over time. I guess you can think of it as letting the cake sort of 'marinade.' The longer the better, your patience will be rewarded.

Great cake!! I reduced the evaporated milk... I used a 5 oz can instead of 12 oz. I also reduced the whole milk from 2 cups down to 1 1/2 cups. I wanted the cake REALLY moist, not soup. :) Thanks for posting!

The first time I made this cake, I followed the instructions and poured the milk mixture on the cooled cake.  There was a lot of liquid left in the pan and I felt it was too runny, but still delicious.  Today, I made it again and right out of the oven, I poked the holes and poured the milk mix over the hot cake.    After 12 hours, there is just the right amount of liquid remaining.  This is the easiest cake I have ever made and it tastes great.  You don't need to use a cake mix. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

This was a huge hit as a birthday cake for a friend who had a fiesta theme for her party.  Very good - I made the cake a day ahead to let the milk soak in and used homemade whipped cream for the icing.

Yummy! This cake is very good and very rich! The only thing I did differently was using fat free or less fat ingredients: fat free sweetened cond. milk & evaporated milk, 1% milk, fat free heavy cream, and wheat flour. Oh, I also seperated the eggs and beat the whites before adding them to the mixture, don't know if that makes a huge difference but that's what I did. The cake had a great consistency, I loved how it was soaked with the milks but it stayed together and didn't fall apart. While the cake was soaking in the milks, I drained the excess milk around the edges into a bowl and re-poured it over the cake so the cake soaked all of the liquid. There was a little liquid underneath the cake but most of it was absorbed. The topping was also very tasty!

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was adjust the baking powder for high altitude (3/4 tsp) and I also added a tsp of coconut milk powder. I topped it with fresh strawberries. My family couldn't get enough.

Although some of the reviews had me worried, I found this recipe straightforward - with outstanding results. Some small suggested adjustments that can be made, depending on taste:  1) It's a big cake. You can halve the recipe successfully using 2 eggs + a small amount of oil (under a tsp) instead of 2 1/2 eggs.  2) 1 1/2 cups of whip for the topping is generous. You can use 1 or slightly less.  3) The cake is quite sweet, and 3/4 cup of sugar in the base and 1/2 in the topping instead of 1 is fine. I gave the topping some extra kick by adding a generous splash of rum, which my colleagues approved of! 4) To make sure the filling is soaked up evenly - unless you prefer a more varied texture - pierce the cooled base deeply and evenly all over, not just a few times as the recipe suggests.

Buenisimo!  Sustituye leche entera con leche de almendras la primera vez que lo hice y fue un exito.  Casí como el queque de mi mamá tica.  :)

If you want, you can substitute almond milk for whole milk.  I did that the first time I made it and it was superb and probably healthier!

Wow! This is an awesome recipe! Follow as directed & you'll have a yummy cake. Try it with a drizzle of dolce de leche or cajeta & it's even better! If your cake isn't coming out tasting awesome then you are either changing the recipe or following it wrong.

excellent cake. I cannot say how authentic it is or not, but it was tasty. I was concerned that the 3 milks would not completely absorb, but I let the cake sit in the fridge for about an hour before serving... it was prefect! even better the following day

I've made this cake twice now and it's just marvelous, and super simple!  STRAWBERRIES on top are a MUST.  They really complement the cake flavor well and give the whole thing a fresh taste and great mouthfeel!!  I do NOT recommend making this cake the night before though, as my cake turned to a biscuit-like consistency the next day.  Eaten the day-of though is like heaven.  I made no changes to the recipe (other than the strawberries) :)  ENJOY!!!!

Not bad! I used a French vanilla cake mix but added 5 eggs instead of the 3 eggs on the box...It was great but I am new at making whipped cream icing homemade so I didn't know that the sugar should be powdered..(figured it out after it didn't peak so switched to powdered) It still turned out great...;)

This cake was gone almost as soon as it was cut up! Delicious! I was worried about the amount of liquid but it soaked up fast and was not soggy. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top for some color and a small touch of extra flavor. The best part about this cake is that it tastes so good on its own but can also be used as a base recipe and adapted so many different ways. Next time I might try some coconut milk instead of whole milk. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've never made a Tres Leches Cake before and have to say I wasn't really all that impressed. It was very soggy and wet, but I followed the directions to the letter. It tastes very sweet and very milky, so that's a plus, but I think I'll pass on making it again...I may also let it sit for longer in the fridge next time before trying it as the other reviewers suggest. It was easy to make and fun to try just not up my alley.

Easy to make and was sooo delicious! I used 1 cup of half and half instead of 2 cups of whole milk. I separated the egg white and the yolks. It was well worth the extra work! Will make this again and again! We love it!!! Thanks!

Never having had this cake before I enjoyed it - not my favorite - but very good for the type of cake its supposed to be. Made it for a Mexican Thanksgiving Dinner. I think next time I try it I will cut back on the liquid by at least a 1/4 cup - it was a bit too wet - I had a lready cut back to 1 1/2 cups. Also do put a few sprinkles of cinnamon and nutmeg on top - it really needs the flavor!

I tried this because it seemed the easiest of my internet search for Tres Leches. It turned out great. The cake part seemed a bit more yellow and dense than I'd had before so maybe the suggestions below to separate the eggs, etc. might help that, but it was still delicious! I poked lots of holes in the top AND sides of the cake and took the time to pour  the milk in segments to let it all soak in.  At the end there was some liquid that seeped out the bottom which is what it's supposed to do.  As stated before, this cake gets better as it sits in the fridge and chills. It's still good several days later. I added a little Amaretto to the whip cream topping and that really gave it a nice kick! Yummy.

very nice flavor. I used my own whipped cream recipe. But, too much milk, it puddles on the bottom. I will make again, but will reduce the amount of whole milk to 1 cup instead of two.

I've never had this type of cake before so I'm not sure how to compare it but it came out good. Cake was very moist  but the whipped topping came out very thin. Wish I had mixed some cool whip with the topping to thicken it up before pouring it on the cake.

I made this cake for New Years Eve for the first time not knowing how it would come out.  I must say it was delicious and everyone loved it!! the only exception was that I follow a slightly different method for making the cake portion - beat the butter first, for a few minutes until it is a light yellow color - then add the sugar and beat on high until it is very pale - add eggs one at a time (beating for 20 seconds between each egg); then add vanilla (instead of 1/2 teaspoon, I used 1 teaspoon) and beat for one more minute. Add flour mixture a little at a time and mix until batter is smooth. I used almost all the milk ingredients over the cake and it was so moist.  Everyone enjoyed so much that I'm making another one today.

This cake was good, but not amazing. I found the taste to be slightly eggy and the cake a bit too dense. It didn't have the lightness that comes with good tres leches cake. The cake does however get better the next day. I would recommend making it the day before you need it.

This is a fabulous cake recipe that I made gluten-free.  I just subed GF flour for the wheat flour and added 1 1/2 tsp xanthum gum to the dry flour mix.  Everything else stayed true to the original recipe.  I did pour the milk mixture on the cake while it was still warm and then refrigerated it (without the topping) overnight.  Oh and I reduced the sugar in the whipped topping to 1/4 cup powdered sugar.  1 cup white sugar is way too much.  Sprinkled some cinnamon on top and it was a HUGE hit for my GF daughter and no one else even knew it was gluten-free!

This cake is so creamy and delicious! I did make some significant changes to the recipe. First of all I only used 4 eggs as people were complaining of an eggy tasting cake. I also replaced half the whole milk with coconut milk and reduced the whole liquid volume by about 2/3 of a cup. The cake come out perfect - perfectly moist and not too soggy. For the topping, I added a couple tablespoons of dessicated coconut to the cream and sprinkled some toasted coconut on top to finish it off. Try it!

I chose this recipe to round out my tex-mex dinner party, and having never had tres leches cake before, I have nothing to compare it to, but this recipe definitely impressed me!  I read many reviews and decided to pour the milk mixture onto the cake (I baked in a 9x13 inch pan) when it was still hot.  Then I chilled it overnight, then turned it over onto a serving platter before topping with whipped cream, and it was perfect (I also added a layer of sliced bananas under the whipped cream, then topped it all with a drizzle of caramel)!  the milk soaked in nicely so it wasn't soggy, but there was a wonderful sweet ooze when you cut into your piece!

I love to take this to potlucks.  Everyone is convinced that it must be hard to make.  My only problem is that at every step I think that I must have screwed up.  The cake batter is very thick -it's okay. The cake bakes to almost overbaked - it's okay.  There is almost a quart of milk mixture - it's okay.  I do cheat and skip the heavy whipping cream and just use extra creamy Cool Whip.   The only issue I have is that it doesn't really keep long.  I usually make it the day before and "frost" it just before I need to serve.  I think it lasts in the fridge about 3-4 days afterwards.

My husband loved this! The only thing that I would suggest is using self-rising flour so you can get a bit more height with the cake itself. Otherwise, PERFECTO!! Gracias!!!

This is my mom's favorite cake, its better the next day. I recommend making the cake a couple days ahead of time to let it sit in the fridge and soak up the delicious milk. Also I only put a tablespoon or two of sugar in the whipped cream.

I made this yesterday for my husband's birthday. It turned out fantastic. I made this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of not spreading the whipped cream over the top of the cake and just putting a dollop of it on top of each piece. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top of the whipped cream. It was wonderful! Everyone asked for seconds!!

This was a very sweet and moist cake yet I found it lacking something.  A suggestion was made that sweetened condensed milk be a Mexican brand; that it would give it more flavor.

Tastes just like the real thing. I used a 9" round pan, and it seemed the perfect size/height. I also separated the egg whites, whipping them and adding them last. Added 1/4 tsp of baking powder to the flour mixture. I used only 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar (any more would have been too sweet for me), and it was perfect. One recommendation, when you pour the batter into your pan, be sure to smooth it evenly throughout. I didn't and had a large mound in the middle which makes it more difficult to evenly distribute the milk.

The first time I ever had this type of cake and thought it was OK. I didn't make it as the directions state. After reading the reviews, followed the suggestions of others to reduce the milk (I did so by using only about a 1/4 of what was called for) and the sugar in the whipped topping (about 1/2 a cup). So glad I did. Would have been way too soupy with all that milk. Used the extra milk to make the Vanilla Ice Cream III recipe also on this site.

I really didn't like this cake.  I doubt I would like any recipe for it.  It was so bland.  The best part was the cool whip I used for the topping.  Will not try again.

I have made this cake twice now and each time it has been a big hit with my family.  It is definitely a different kind of cake, but soooooo yummy.  The only changes that I made to the recipe were that I only added 1/3 cup of sugar to the heavy cream.  I would also say that it is better if you can let it sit overnight.  Still very good when made a few hours before serving, but better when left overnight.

This was so yummy! Just what I wanted! The only thing I would change would be to use 1 cup of whole milk, since there was quite a bit of milk on the bottom of the pan. Also, I used the cool whip frosting recipe I found on this site instead of the frosting recipe this recipe includes. Very good!

I've never had tres leches cake before but a friend raved over one she had at a restaurant recently. I decided to try this recipe and I just loved it!!! I did cut back on the sugar for the whipped cream. I put 2/3 c. instead of the whole cup. Also, instead of 2 cups whole milk, I used 1 cup whole milk and 1 cup whipping cream to make it creamier. It was heavenly! Even my picky husband (he's picky coz he also loves to bake) loved it! My 3 little boys raved over it. Enjoy!

I only waited five minutes after removing from the oven to pour the milk glaze over the cake.  It was absorbed immediately.  I found that by pouring the glaze close to the cake (practically touching the top), I was able to better control where it went.

Never had tres leches before but this was pretty darn good!  It was quite milky and wet so next time I will add half the milk mixture...although my boyfriend wanted it milkier.  This cake is really a preference thing for people who want it moist/milky or not.  I served this with store-bought whipped cream.  For a thicker cake, I think I will bake this in a smaller pan next time.  The cake was almost like a pound cake.  I will definitely make this again!

When I went to Peru I had this and was never able to find anything in the states that lived up to it.. till now! This was EXCELLENT! I also used 1 cu. whole milk and 1 cu. heavy cream, I added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda for the cake to rise better, I separated my eggs and beat well the whites before adding, I skipped making the whip cream and used cool whip. I topped with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. Be sure right when it comes out of the oven to poke holes ALL over the cake and to cut around the edges up the cake. Cake must cool, then slowly pour milk mixture on surface and around the edges. This recipe called for a perfect amount of milk it was GREAT!

This cake is pretty awesome!! I took it to my work and my coworkers loved it. It's prettty dense so I definitely recommend not waiting until it completely cools to put in the milk. Also poke a bunch of holes because it doesn't absorb the milk so easily. Last, it probably wouldn't hurt to cut back on the sugar for the whipped cream because it was pretty sweet!!!

I was worried when I baked the cake itself that it didn't seem to be enough cake for the pan.  I also left it in the oven a little too long and it got hard on the edges (completly my fault, not the recipe), so I was worried.  But I poked the holes and poured on the milk mixture anyway.  I only poured on about half and refigerated it overnight, then pour on about another 1/4th the next day after the first has soaked in.  The cake was moist and the "hard" places disappeared.  I frosted as directed and mixed the remaining milk mixture with whipped cream and served it on the side.  The only thing I would change would be to make about 25% more cake next time so it is a little thicker and I will be sure to thoroughly mix in the granulated sugar in the heavy cream before whipping because my whipped cream had some grains of sugar in it still.  Everyone at the party raved about it, though, so I will keep this recipe.

This cake is just delightful!  I did use half milk/half cream instead of the full 2 cups of milk.  I think it gives it a much richer taste, and also I think when you use all regular milk, it makes the cake a little too milky tasting and not quite sweet enough.  Very easy and delicious!

Followed the directions as stated. The only addition I would recommend would be to add some cinnamon sprinkled to the top. What's nice about this dense cake is that it cuts perfectly. Cut out little pieces & place on top of muffin liners if you want an elegant looking two-bite dessert.

I've never baked, or even ate for that matter, a Tres Leches cake. It was different but very good. A friend from Honduras requested it for his birthday and he enjoyed it. Be sure to poke enough holes in the cake with your fork so that it absorbs the milk mixture! Thanks Stephanie!

Wow!  This cake is delicious and so rich.  My mom said it was her favorite dessert ever.  The only comment I really have to make is that the milk mixture was WAY too much.  I was only able to pour on about a quarter of it before the milk started pooling around the edges and I couldn't touch the cake without milk squirting out.  When I tried the cake, it was soaked all the way through with milk like it was supposed to be, even though I didn't pour all of the milk on it.  Great cake, but doesn't need that much milk.

Delicious! I did change a lot in this recipe. I separated the eggs, whipped the whites at the end and folded them in right before pouring the batter into the pan. In the milk mixture I used the condensed milk, the evaporated milk, 2 shots of Malibu rum (coconut rum), and a can of coconut milk. In the whipped cream, I added another shot of Malibu Rum and just 1/2c sugar. For garnish, I used well drained crushed pineapple, mandarin oranges, and toasted coconut. This was amazing and I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe to use up some leftover sweetened condensed and evaporated milk I had sitting in the fridge.  I only had 4 oz of each, so I reduced the whole milk (which I substituted with heavy whipping cream) to 1/2 cup.  These amounts worked perfectly.  I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and whipped the egg whites separately, then folded them into the batter.  Finally, 1 1/2 c. of whipping cream was a bit too much for the topping, so I'd only use 1 c. next time.  Overall, this recipe was excellent after a few tweaks.  It has a unique flavor and I'll be making it again!

I loved this cake and so did my mother in law. I replaced 1c. whole milk with 1c. coconut milk. The only problem was the cake wouldn't soak up the milk. Next time I will try pouring the milk over the cake while it is still warm.

Seriously, wow. All my guests last night raved and asked for the recipe. The cake looks like it won't absorb all the milk, so out of precaution I poured half on and let it do its thing and then poured the other half on about 20m later when I saw the first half was all gone. Ended up being the right amount of milk. Thanks for a great recipe!

My cake turned out great! I have to say that I followed the recommendations of a previous reviewer who said to separate the eggs, mixing the yolks in on time,  whipping the egg whites and adding them after the dry ingredients. For some reason, my cake did great with only two-thirds of the milk mixture, so I just tossed the rest out.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I had to do some modifications, but it still came up great! I didn't have the whipping cream so I didn't top it with it, but I did have a can of whipped cream which I let my guests use at their discretion on top of the cake. Also, I had a box of white cake mix, which is what I used. It made it a lot easier and was still delicious.

This was my first experience with this type of cake, it is a very unique and moist cake. Amazingly, the milk is absorbed into the cake without it becoming mushy.

This is the best tres leche cake I've ever tasted.  A group of us had a "taste test" of three different recipes at a party and this one won - hands down.  This cake was gone at the end of the party - the others were practically whole.

This recipe is almost perfect.  I beat the whites first till frothy, and completed everything else as stated.  At first I did not think the cake would absorb all of the milk, but I let it refrigerate for about 5 hours and when it was served, everybody was very happy.  Great recipe.

Simply incredible.....I used fat free evaporated skim milk, fat free regular milk, and added a light sprinkle of cinnamon sugar over the top.  This was one of the very best things I've ever made.  SO INCREDIBLY GOOD!  I baked the cake in the round Pampered Chef deep dish baker, fyi- perfect pan for this dessert.

I'm glad I made this!  When pulling the cake out of the oven, I thought it was too dry.  When adding all the milks, I thought that the cake could not absorb that much liquid.  I put on the whipped cream topping.  We had a Mexican birthday party at the international banqet.  It was wonderful! We will be making this again!

Easy to follow and so delicious! This one's been a big hit everywhere I've taken it. I never liked tres leches cake before (I hadn't tried it homemade before!) but now it's definitely a staple in my kitchen. I usually wind up baking mine either in a smaller square pan or a round cake pan, a little longer at a slightly lower temp, and it's been good this way. Make sure you follow the instructions to beat it between each egg addition, etc. because then you will get the fluffiest cake imaginable.

I was visiting my son in Atlanta, and he took me to a local restaurant and ordered me this dessert.  It was fabulous.  As soon as I returned home, I searched this site for a recipe and chose this one.  I wasn't disappointed.  This recipe was easy to make, and everyone in my house loved it.  The only change I made was to add only 1/4 cup of sugar to the whipped cream insead of the 1 cup.  It was plenty sweet enough.  The next time I make it, I will cut down the whole milk to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups, as I did have some milk that did not fully absorb into the cake.  Other than that, the cake was great!

When I made this cake the only thing that I did different was that I used a can of whipped cream instead of the heavy whipping cream that it called for.  It tasted okay but it didn't taste like the tres leches cakes that I'm used to (I'm Latina by the way).  This one tasted like a pound cake with milk.  It still tasted good but not like a good tres leches cake.

Excellent and so easy to make. Tastes kind of like a custard. I let my milk mixture soak in the cake for about 24 hours. I added the whipped cream a few hours before serving to let it set. Then I added fresh strawberries on top. Warning: very sweet!

I took this to an early Cinco de Mayo potluck at work today and it was a hit.  One of my co-workers, whose parents are from Mexico, told me that this was the best Tres Leches cake he's ever had.  He said it was even better than his mom's, which was quite a compliment!

How can this get any better as it sits?  How can this last more than a day?  I can't believe how crazy good this is!!!  I did use 1% milk, and just a hair short of one cup of it.  (ALL The milk mixture soaked in pretty much immediately into the warm cake).  And, for the whipped topping:  I used just a lil' bit of Powdered Sugar, instead of granulated.  Stop reading right now, and make this one.   YUM! YUM! YUM!

I made the cake because my boyfriend has been begging me to make one forever. It was the first one I've ever made. It was ok. Not one of my favorites. He loved it, but I agree with those that thought it was too eggy. I use large eggs, so I should have either cut out an egg or maybe used meduim eggs. The cake absorbed the milk fast. And the Whipping cream was definitely my favorite. But overall, I was a bit disappointed.

This cake was the only saving grace of an otherwise disastrous meal!  I followed another unnamed recipe from this site (I leave it unnamed because I'm sure the fault was all mine) and long story short... the resulting smoke caused a 700 person dorm to be evacuated and 7 firetrucks to the rescue. (Don't worry, no fire.. just smoke)  But the cake was in the fridge before this happened and it turned out perfect!  Follow the recipe exactly as is, it is well deserving.

This cake was delicious.  Because of the other reviews, I didn't put the whipping cream on top.  I just used store bought cool whip and it was great!  Will def make again!

I LOVE TRES LECHES CAKE!! and decided to make this cake for New Year's. I do have to agree, the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it is. I'm almost done with it. (I have been eating it all by myself, he, he) I do recommend not adding so much sugar to the heavy cream, cut it down to only a couple of tbs. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was fantastic... I prepared this as a Thanksgiving dessert for my family. My mother's side of the family is Cuban and said it was the best Tres Leche cake they have ever had! These people are hispanic foodies and hard to truly impress... Instead of topping with strawberry, I topped with mango and papaya... You will be the talk of the party!!!! They are asking me to make it again this year.

Very yummy! No left over milk sitting in the pan after the cake soaked it up. But I believe I needed to whip the cream longer because it turned out very runny. Perhaps using a blender for 10 minutes will do.

Very moist.  It was a little bland and I was wishing I had added some chocolate or something to add more flavor.  I did like how moist and creamy it was though.  I might try it again with either some lemon or chocolate flavor added.

I make cakes for each of my friend's birthdays and this was requested for the most recent birthday.  The two of us seemed to be the only 2 people who were interested in the cake.  I think the peeps didn't like the soggy bottom, but then again I don't think that anybody had any idea what the cake was in the first place.  I would make again, but probably not for my meat and potatoes crowd.

I have made this recipe four times as written except I just added canned whipped cream on each piece when I served it.  I read others' concerns about the cake being too dense to absorb all the liquid and made sure to sift the flour and baking powder and that helped a lot.  Also, I softened the unsalted butter on the counter just a little before I whipped it with the sugar and that cut down on some of my prep time - it still took a while to reach "light and fluffy."  I would definitely make this cake a day ahead so it could sit in the fridge and get super cold and the flavors could marry.  The cake as made should still have some liquid in the bottom of the pan.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is great! Made it for a mexican themed party and everyone loved it!  I made it in a smaller pan since some reviewers said that making it in the recommended pan was too thin.  Somehow my whipped topping never whipped, I put the topping in a creamer bowl and had everyone pour some over their pieces.  I will surely make this again!  It wasn't too sweet for me!

Great cake and it's especially good served cold! I was so scared the milk wouldn't absorb into the cake - it looks like so much once you put it into the same container! Even once I poured it bit by bit, you need to wait for it to soak in. At first I thought I flooded it! It ALL soaks in though, so have no fears! Kids seemed to love it!

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was a big hit!  Yes, the cake is eggy and dense, but once you let it soak in the three milks and then top it with the sweetened whipped cream, the result is heavenly!  It is a nice departure from a traditional cake with a traditional icing.  

I added a little bit of rum extract to the cake batter and the whipped cream, along with the vanilla, for some added depth of flavor.

I definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again!

I made this recipe on a couple of days ago for my job as a pastry chef.  I have to say it turned out very, very well!  The cake is firm enough to hold the extra milks without breaking down and the whole dessert is not overly sweet just cool and delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this cake recipe but didn't have whole milk, so I used the milk mixture from Monica's Tres Leches Cake on this website to pour over. Excellent! I loved this cake's consistency/texture. Thanks!

My daughter and I tried this recipe last summer. We didn't change ANYTHING and it was delicious!!! We followed the recipe exactly and were delighted with the results. I've made it a few times since then and I still wouldn't change a thing. It's gotten rave reviews from coworkers, picky eaters, EVERYONE raves about this cake!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Stephanie!

This cake tasted good, but the milk mixture made WAY too much.  I used half of that mixture; any more would have made the cake soggy.  Also, I didn't end up with 3 layers, and I followed the recipe (although I skipped the whipped cream part and used chocolate frosting instead).

absolutely wonderful! I changed two things. I used 10x sugar in the whipped cream, and just enough to barely sweeten it,  and I added about a teaspoon of orange extract to the cake.  its perfect! I love getting this cake in restaurants where its served with fresh strawberried and mango, now I can have it at home and its just as good! thanks for this great recipe!

I have never made a tres leches cake before, but my husband is hispanic and we have had this many times in Mexico. I like food on the dry side, so I don't really care for this cake. But, like a lot of these reviews have said, if you know what this cake is and expect it to be heavy and soggy, then this cake is the best. My husband said that it is almost identical to the one's he's had in the past, and he would know. After reading many of these reviews, I did make one change. I didn't alter the amount of sugar in the cake, but for the milk mixture, I used 2 cans of sw. cond. milk instead of one and decreased the whole milk to 1 cup instead of 2. I poked a ton of little holes in the top of the cooled cake before pouring the milk over, and it took about an hour to soak in. Don't pour any off and make sure you use all of it, or the cake will be dry (at least dry for this type of cake). I hope this helps!

It came out perfect! I changed a couple of things.This cake alone is known to be very sweet, but a lil less sugar is better since the sweet condensed milk and the actual cake itself is already sweet to begin with. So I used 1/4 cup of sugar for the whipped cream topping instead of 2 cups and 2 tsp of vanilla extract instead of one. When making the flour mixture, I used one tsp. of vanilla instead of just 1/2. While waiting for the cake to cool off, I mixed the 3 milks and placed them in the fridge to chill. Then, I poked lots of holes throughout the cake before pouring the milks onto it so that way it all settled in nicely. At first I wondered why there was sooo much excess milk liquid, but it soaked it up nicely while leaving the cake overnight in the fridge, some but not all the excess liquid. I would recommend maybe not pouring all of it, but most, the same thing with the whip cream. There will be some left over.  The key to keeping it moist all over is lots of holes! :) In the end, the cake seemed plain-looking, so I added sliced marachino cherries in rows. Afterwards, it looked like a piece of art! And note...the cake is thin at first, but once the milks settle in...it will expand and sponge up. ;) Thanks, Stephanie for the recipe! p.s. this cake is to be served in little portions, due to the sweetness, not the regular size of birthday cake portions.

I loved it!  I am from Houston and had a Tres Leche cake at a local restraunt and fell in love with it, but they no longer carry it.  Yesterday, I found this recipe and thought I would try it for Easter dinner.  It was a hit!  My husband who hates cake because it is usually too dry loved it too.  I did reduce the sugar in the topping to 1/4 C like other reviews said and think it turned out perfect.  I am looking forward to making this again.  Thank You Stephanie.

With a few changes, this recipe turned out really well. At first I didn't think it was going to work, because the batter was very thick when I finished mixing in all the flour, and I had to spread it into the pan rather than pour it. The cake was a little thinner than normal, and much more dense, but I realized that the heavier texture was so it could absorb and hold the milk better.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and only used 1 cup of milk, rather than the 2 specified. I used skim milk too, and it turned out fine, so whole milk isn't absolutely necessary.

Great...I like my tres leches cake sweeter next time I will add more sweeted condensed milk. I wish there had been more liquid to serve the slices with. But overall a one of the best tres leches I have found.

I made this for my supervisor for her birthday, and she LOVED it.  We usually get Tres Leches from a bakery, but they loved my homemade version. I didn't use all of the milk combination, but it worked out because some of the cakes that we've had in the past were a little too milky.  It's definitely an office fave.

Original, however I think it would come out better if that milk mixture was heated up so it thickened a bit before pouring it on the cake. All that liquid was too much and didn't really absorb. (I probably should have made the holes with the end of a wooden stick)

I won't a make this cake again. My first time, following the directions as stated, and took the cake to a potluck luncheon. While the overall taste was good, the amount of (three) milks used to soak into the cake was way overwhelming with a puddle of milk left in the pan while serving.

I have made this recipe now many times and lot it every time. I ate Tres Leches for this first time while visiting Honduras and loved it. I like this recipe better than what I had in Honduras. I love to tinker with all recipes so sometimes I will add a little cinnamon to the whipped topping and/or the cake mix. It's delicious an hour after you make it but it is always better the next day after the milk has really soaked in. Thank you for sharing this- it has been a blessing to our family.

I am disappointed; I absolutely love authentic tres leche cake and due to my recent move, I have yet to find a place that sells some. With that being said I tried making my own following this recipe. This cake tasted good but it tasted nothing like a tres leche cake. I grew up in a Dominican household, I know what this cake is supposed to taste like and this isn’t it. Like someone said in a review I read, it tasted like a soggy pound cake.

I can't fairly rate the cake I've made just yet- I just feel like there's way too much milk for the cake to soak up? Any tips? Idk I followed the recipe to the T .. anyone else have this problem after pouring the milk over the cooled cake??

I think the 2 cups of whole milk is wrong. My syrup was way too watery. Also the egg whites should be beaten and folded in. Maybe my oven was running hot but 30 minutes made the cake dry.

I made it very close to the recipe and I think it is better than our favorite bakery version.  The changes I made were based on a reviewer who had the Honduran grandmother.  I subbed one cup of milk for a can of coconut cream in the milk mix.  I removed the cake after it had finished baking and let it rest for 5 minutes before poking it and soaking it with the milk mixture.   Then I returned it to the oven (turned off) for 15 minutes and it was like magic, the mixture re absorbed up the cake and did not separate even after three days.  We sent half to work and there was still lots for our family.  I also only added a couple of tablespoons of sugar and a couple  of tablespoons of instant vanilla pudding to the whip cream to help stabilize it and it was plenty sweet.

Delicious! This was the first time I made this cake. Brought it to an Ecuadorian themed party. Some of the guests were familiar with Tres Leche cake and told me it was just great. The only thing I did differently was to use coconut milk  (suggested by one reviewer)instead of regular  and added 1/4 tsp baking soda(another reviewer hint). All the milk was absorbed overnight but I let it chill another day before topping with whipped cream made with only 3/4 C sugar.  YUM!

Our family loves tres leches cake, and this recipe is perfect. Sure, you can do things differently to get different results, but there is no need to. We add a layer of caramel under the whipped topping layer and we've added sliced strawberries on top... no matter what you do, it will be amazing. Super amazing recipe as is, or the perfect base for a unique cake!

Made it for high school softball team and did the folding method,  but the cake was still too flat,  despite poured milk to sit in fridge to see if it arises;  didn't,  and had light Cool whip since pressed for time. Sprinkled cocoa and cinnamon,  and put a dash of nutmeg & cinammon on the cake batter,  Yet,  the flavor was superbly amazingly good! Sacrifice presentation for the taste.... used foil in metal pan,  cooled then put the cake in my ceramic 9x13 so we can lick it all off!!!

I made this cake (using Selena's comments as a guide) for my Colombian roommate's Birthday.  She said it was her favorite, so I was worried it wouldn't live up to "back home."  She LOVED it; she said it was the appropriate amount of sweetness and moisture.  She raved all night how much this made her "soul happy" to fill that craving for her favorite traditional food.  Surprisingly easy, GREAT recipe!

Though this is not my personal go-to cake typically, nor would I say that I will make it regularly, the recipe was simple to follow and worked out great. It tasted delicious for the cake that it is meant to be, and I ate too much of it. Because Tres Leches doesn't typically have butter in the sponge, I decided to beat the egg whites (after separating the eggs) in order to ensure that it's still on the lighter side. I found that I needed to make more than a few pokes with a fork in order to have the filling soak perfectly (I literally made giant gashes throughout the cake since the cake soaks in the filling better and mends the cake in the end anyway). I kept it in the fridge for about 10 minutes to ensure that the consistency was perfect.  My guests loved it and multiple people had seconds.  Consistency was great on day two as well.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now. Recently I thought maybe there was too many eggs in this recipe or maybe I should try separating the eggs. So I decided to go on a tres leche making test for a week and a half. I made 13 different tres leche recipes, including this one in 3 different suggested variations from what was suggested in the reviews. No matter what I did they never turned out as perfect as this exact recipe. They didn't hold the milk right, or were too crumbly, one even had a layer of milk at the bottom that wouldn't absorb for 4 days. I keep coming back to this one. I had to make 4 tonight for a party at work tomorrow and I had to use this recipe. Thank you to the original poster. My family might be a little chunkier because of this recipe but everyone loves it and it never lasts more than a few days in my fridge. I would suggest making this exactly how it's stated. The only difference I use is regular butter and I use confectionery sugar for the whipped topping. Great recipe! A+++

One of the best cakes I ever made!!!  I took some of the review suggestions by cutting the sugar in the whipped cream- I used 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar and I didn't put the whipped cream on until after I refrigerated it over night & put it on the next morning & served it at dinner time.  Going to make this again and again & again!

The cake was way too dense and it was still swimming in liquid even after leaving it to soak for more than a day - 2 cups of milk is complete overkill! Good flavour, but I will definitely not be making this again.

I made this cake this weekend.  I cut the milk in the mixture to one cup since I was going to add chopped sweetened fruit which would add extra liquid. I made my own whipped cream with two cups whipping cream, four tablespoons sugar, vanilla.  I used *drained* chopped frozen strawberries and sweetened to taste.  I added the fruit after the milk had time to soak and seal the holes. Everyone love it.  Fruit adds freshness.  Cake in convection oven 325 for 20 min.

Made pretty much as written.  ( I used 1 1/2 cups whole milk and 1/2 cup whipping cream instead of 2 cups milk). The whole cake was gone in no time !!  Easily could have made more and they would have eaten seconds.  The thing is, I felt it was an easy cake to make.   I made it the night before, put frosting/whipping cream on in morning, chilled all day and it was perfect at night.

Cake had a delicious taste, but be warned you won't have to chew this cake. You probably could use a straw to drink it tho. I wish I had tried a bite and warned others at my church dinner about the texture. Instead of compliments, I got a lot of "it was different" comments. I would definitely scale back on the liquids somehow. I did sprinkle the top with cinnamon and it made for a beautiful presentation.

I'm Venezuelan and I was trying to find a recipe that would remind me of my childhood when I would go to parties and have a delicious tres leches served! And I can assure you that this recipe did the trick. It's very mostly, fluffy and delicious altogether just like I was hoping for. I recommend this recipe for all of my Latinos that are looking for a nostalgic and beautiful memory from back home

Made this as written for a Caribbean themed party.  It was a hit!  Moist and rich.  Carried the cake it its baking dish and the whipped cream in a covered dish and assembled on site.  Served with a platter of sliced tropical fruit.

No changes yet but thinking of playing with it.  But it's perfect just the way it is.  Have made it many times over last couple years.

Really good, turned out great! After going through reviews, I used 1 cup of half n half, 1 cup milk, along with the evap milk and sweetened condensed milk.  I mistakenly added the mixed milks after poking my still warm cake.  However, it was fine. Within minutes,all the milk was absorbed, so not a bad way to go. I did refrigerate it for a few hours before icing.  I also reduced the sugar with the whipping cream to a heaping 1/3 cup of confection sugar, along with the tsp of vanilla. I will add sliced strawberries to the top after looking at all the lovely pictures! Thanks for posting this recipe, its a keeper. Can't wait to have a piece with coffee in the morning. UPDATE 10/15-I've made this 3 times and the most helpful things I've discovered: Don't separate the eggs, made no difference. Just be sure and beat eggs well and follow the directions to add the sifted flour spoonfuls at a time.  Pouring the milks onto your poked cake after 30 minutes of cooling (using full milk measurements) will offer a wonderful absorption. Check the cake 25 minutes into baking, mine was done and got too dry when baked for 30.  I made another time when I didn't have enough whipping cream and used powdered cool whip mixed with milk and vanilla for topping and it was great. Hope these things help!

I  made the recipe actually as written. the cake batter appeared alittle dense when it comes out which is perfect to absorb the milk mixture. the milk quantity was right on. the cake was absolutely delicious, easy and authentic tasting. It has possibility experiment with. i saw a review to use egg nog or flavored rum. thank you for this recipe!

I make this cake for all of my family get-togethers. I come from a Hispanic family and this cake is always a hit. For a little extra effect, I add a light coat of cinnamon on the top.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday today. It was absolutely delicious, but we found it to have too much milk in the bottom of the pan. Next time I might try a 1/4 cup less milk in the milk mixture. Still an absolute winner in our book.

So good and easy to follow! If you prefer desserts that don't spike your blood sugar levels, then cut the sugar in half for both the batter and whipped cream. Still equally delicious.

Terrific recipe from a Texan who thoroughly enjoys a tres leeches cake when out at a restaurant.  Made this for my nephew's birthday because it is his favorite kind of cake and everyone said this was the best they ever had. Followed the recipe EXACTLY - it was terrific and quite easy! Thank you!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! Congratulations Stephanie!!  I've always LOVED "Tres Leches (Three Milks), but thought it was a  very labor intensive dessert, so I would buy it from a Cuban Bakery near me.  My love for this dessert made me look up this recipe a few days ago; and, I found yours and decided to give it a try.  Today was the day!!!!!! I put on some soft instrumental christian music and followed your recipe, and I am so very pleased with the flavor, the texture, the ease of making it!!!  WOW, I ACTUALLY CAN MAKE A TRES LECHE!  Thank you so much for making it so very simple and delicious!! Can't wait to make it again as a SURPRISE for one of our church functions!!!  God Bless You Stephanie for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of us!! Oh, by any chance, do you have a "Mango Flan"  recipe that would "drop your socks off"?  If you do, please let me know.  Thank you!!

Have made this a couple of times now & is just like we remembered from Mexico.  This time hubby made & put some blueberries on the top for decoration.  Should let sit for a couple of days to "soak" up the milk, but we can't wait.

I did the cake and I use lactaid milk since I can't tolerate lactose. I also use some of the 3 milks mixture, a little bit of powder sugar, and cream cheese to make the topin because I did not have any heavy cream. This actually works for me.

I tried this recipe the first time I wanted to make Tres Leches cake. The cake recipe is just OK for a regular cake. Its missing proper proportions for a moist/fluffy and softer regular cake. 
But the biggest mistake is - Tres Leches cake is a SPONGE cake soaked in three different kinds of milk, and this recipe is NOT a sponge cake. 
Two important things about a SPONGE cake is - No butter (fat), and Separate the eggs. The Egg whites are beaten to stiff peaks, and folded into the batter at the final stage before beating. 
I made the cake again with a Sponge cake recipe (check out Pioneer Woman recipe), and by God! That, my friends, was Tres Leches cake....seriously!

I've made this cake several times now and it is always a hit. I have 2 children from El Salvador and they beg me to make it. They say it is better than what you find in any Mexican restaurant. The only change I made (and I only do it occasionally) was to add some cinnamon to the cake mixture. It gives it a little something extra.

Tried this recipe according to directions and it turned out perfectly. It tasted identical to the Tres Leches I had in Nicaragua on my travels. I accidentally bought whole wheat flour and it still turned out amazing.

definitely better the 2nd or 3rd day.  Very nice vanilla flavor, like vanilla ice cream.  If you're expecting a "typical" cake texture, though, this isn't it.  It's more like a custard.  (Which is fine - I hadn't made this before and had no idea what it was supposed to be like.)

Delightfully delicious and it tastes like it takes a lot more effort to make!  I did lighten it up by using fat free milks where I could and I did use almond milk instead of whole milk but it didn't taste light in any way.  The cake held up well to the liquids and didn't disintegrate like other recipes I have tried in the past.  This one is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for sharing!!

Made for my husband who grew up in authentic Mexican food and he loved it. In fact, kids loved it too! Used about 3/4 of the milks so as not to be too soggy. The frosting/topping was perfect and will be my go to topping for all cakes moving forward. Fabulous and easy Tres Leches Cake recipe!!

I tried this recipe using half-and-half instead of whole milk, low-fat evaporated milk and regular condensed milk.  The cake came out well, was finished early in the morning and sat, satiated with the milks, all day in the refrigerator.  When I served it in the evening it was soggy and left 1/8 inch of liquid in the pan when pieces of the cake were removed.  It was EXTREMELY rich and way too wet/moist.  Suggestions?

This cake is a hit! I  have to make it every time we go somewhere... people expects me to bring it! I do not modify the recipe, it is perfect as it is the only thing that I add is fresh sliced fruit on top, strawberries and mango are my favorites.

Super easy recipe and absolutely delicious! It gets better the next day so I would suggest making it the night before you plan to serve it and chilling it in the fridge overnight. 
Fantastic recipe!

Very disappointing! I followed your recipe to the letter but this was a real lemon! It had big holes in it, was stodgy and didn't absorb the liquid. Cannot serve this to guests so have to start from scratch.

I've made this cake a couple of weeks ago and the taste was exactly how I remembered it(I had it in a restaurant before). However the quantity of milks made it into a soggy mess! I'll try it again, but will reduce the liquid to a third.

This was my first try at this recipe, so I probably did something wrong, but the cake was not drenched in the three milks as I expected it to be.  When the batter is poured into the 9x13 pan (it didn't actually "pour"; I had to push it into the pan with a spatula), is it supposed to be spread evenly in the pan?  When the three-milk liquid is poured over the cooked cake, is it supposed to be fully absorbed by the cake over time, in the refrigerator?  That didn't happen for me. Can someone tell me what I did wrong? Thanks.

I made this cake for a morning tea at work and it has turned out great. The only suggestions that I would make are too add the milk mixture when the cake is still hot and not to add all of it at once! Keep adding bits at a time, letting them absorb and if you don't need all the milk mixture don't use it. That way the cake turns out delicious and creamy without being soggy.

I've made this recipe twice.  We've only had tres leches cake at a couple of restaurants, so we aren't experts, but my entire family LOVED this recipe.  Better than any bakery we've ever ordered it from....Not too sweet...seems like the perfect amount of moistness...... my kids and my husband ask for it constantly!  SO easy to make!

This cake was so easy to make, no need to leave it overnight. I didn't use milk, I used heavy whipping cream 2 cups, 1 can of condensed milk and one can of evaporated milk. I also cut the sides of the cake and cut the servings in small squares after making the wholes all over the cake, and than poured the 3 milk mix on top and on the sides. The cake absorved the liquid so fast and it stayed moist. For the topping I did not use a whole cup of sugar, I used a little over 1/2 cup and it was perfect! Everybody LOVED it!! Thanks!

I made this cake and everyone loved it. I had it in one of the restaurants in Peru and it was totally amazing. This recipe produces a very similar version of the cake I ate except the cake is slightly tougher. I would prefer a slightly softer cake. But that aside, this is a good recipe!

We have never tried a milk cake before so I thought this recipe might be one for us to try as a family. Everyone was very impressed with the taste and moistness of this cake. I put the topping on individually for everyone with a sprinkle of cinnamon or not depending on taste. We all enjoyed this cake very much.

This is such a unique cake.  I made it for dessert for a Mexican themes dinner I brought someone.  She's since made it a couple times for others as well.  I was nervous about putting the whole amount if liquid on top, but it turns out great as is.  If you don't want it soaked, just pour about 3/4 of the liquid on top.

I'm a white guy that has never baked anything before (I'm much more useful on the grill), but I decided to make this cake for my Mexican girlfriend's birthday since this is the only kind of cake she likes. I was worried that it wouldn't come out right because I've never baked before, and especially because of some of the reviews saying the ingredient measurements weren't perfect. So imagine my surprise when she said she liked it and it was almost exactly like how she makes her tres leches cakes. Personally I've never eaten this kind of cake so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was interesting. I added self rising flour so the cake wouldn't be so thin, and used a cup and a half of half and half milk instead of two cups of whole milk because I thought it wouldn't absorb that well. But it did, and it left just the slightest amount of milk on the bottom of the pan. It was very moist and not soppy or soaked like other reviewers have said. I poked a ton, and I mean a TON, of holes through the cake and it soaked it up very well. Also, instead of a full cup of sugar for the icing, I used a half cup. It still came out pretty sweet. All in all, a very interesting and tasty cake.

I made this cake today.  It turned out very well, I followed the recipe exactly.  The whipped topping on the top is divine.  The cake is a bit eggy for my taste. If I were to make this cake again I would probably try to adjust that.  It was a very quick and easy dessert to make, I do recommend it.

I too use a boxed cake mix, and I top this with fresh sliced strawberries and then the whipped cream. I always go home with an empty pan. I want to try it with fresh sliced mangos sometime - has anyone ever tried that?

The cake batter is perfect for tres leches but i double the recipe since it seems to come out flat with only the original measurements. Also I use my own (leches) mix for the "topping/filling" My mom loves the cake and I've made it 5 times already. To add some flavor to the batter i add about 1tbsp of flavored baking emulsion. (usually butter/butter vanilla or almond.

This is a wonderful recipe that is fairly simple and yields excellent results! My husband and his family (who are from Mexico and often serve tres leches cakes at parties) all agreed it was delicious. I made it as stated the first time and it was great, but the second time I used another reviewer's recipe for the whipped topping (1 pint heavy whipping cream, 3 tbsp sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla), and I preferred the latter. Some reviewers have stated that it was super sweet, but tres leches cake, in general, is very sweet. This cake tastes best when made a day or so in advance and not removed from the refrigerator until just before serving. Yum!

love the taste however, i dont think the batter makes enough to really soak up the "milk" filling. also for the whipped cream instead of regular white sugar i used powdered sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon... AWESOME!

**** I made this cake for the first time yesterday.  Having read the directions and most of the reviews, I thought I was "on the way."  However, I must have let the cake cool too much, so, despite all the holes punched, the cake didn't absorb all the milks.  I had to pour some of it off before putting the whipped cream on at serving time. I'm assuming that, had the cake still been hot when the milk layer was added, the milk would have all been absorbed and the cake would have had a softer texture.   The flavors are wonderful, and I'd make this cake again, but not until I hear from someone what my error was.  Although I rated this one at 4 stars, I think it's probably a 5 star with a bit clearer instruction.

I thought that this cake had way to much liquid.  My husband and kids thought the same.  We also thought it was to sweet.  I think the over sweetness came from the whipped cream topping.  1 cup sugar is to much for 1 1/2 cups whipping cream.  The whipped cream did not turn out fluffy like I'm used to seeing when I make whipped cream.  It thickened but it was heavy.  My kids always lick the bowl clean after I make whipped cream in it.  But this whipped cream was so sickenly sweet that they didn't want to lick the bowl this time.  I thought the cake by itself turned out great.  I wouldn't change that part of this recipe.  If I make this again I will make the filling the same but just not pour all of it over the cake.  It tasted good but the cake was to soggy.  For the whipped cream topping I will instead make it with 1 pint whipping cream, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I've used this whipped cream recipe before for other cakes and it always turns out good.  Just the right amount of sweetness.

I'm from S. TX, mexican, and had never tasted a tres leches cake.  I made this for a friends birthday and EVERYONE LOVED this cake.  Majority of the people are from Texas too and they all said it was just like home!
I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the cake batter.  Decreased the whole milk to one cup.  Made my own whipped cream and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  I made the cake the day before serving but was told the leftovers the next day were even better as the milk had soaked in even more.

Made the cake for a Mexican dinner.  Followed the recipe exact, but only used 3/4C of sugar with 2C of whipping cream.   The sweetness was perfect!!!

I really liked this cake! Rich flavor and good consistency. Some Tres Leches cakes are either too wet to where the cake part is oversaturated and falls apart or too dry where there isn't enough of the milk soaked in. Next time though, I would only use whipped cream on its own for a topping or not at all b/c it is already very sweet on its own. I know this cake is supposed to be quite sweet, but this is exactly how I like it! When I made this I followed the instructions as stated except I made sure the cake to soak overnight before serving.

I would give this 4.5 if I could!  It was delicious.  I used cool whip for the topping otherwise I didn't change a thing.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is I thought it could have a little more milk on the bottom.  But that is just my opinion as I love milk.  Give it a try!

This cake came out great. Perfect amount of milks. The cake gets thicker as it soaks up the milk. Made it the night before afternoon event. Keep it in the fridge. Only change was I used about 1 1/2 cups light coconut milk and 1/2 cup half -n- half in place of the whole milk (that I didn't have) and I cut back on the sugar for the whipping cream..

I am a self proclaimed tres leches cake connoisseur :) It came out perfect!! Absolutely Delicious!!! I would like to emphasize the importance of really piercing the cake allowing all parts to absorb the milk, making it moist and delicious. The first time I made it, I pierced it to  the point I thought it was good, but subsequent times I REALLY pierced it! Last time I got creative and used the end my funnel b/c its a little thicker than a fork, just had to pierce it many more times and it was the best yet :) Thank you Stephanie!!

I had never made Tres Leches before and a friend of mine from Mexico requested it for his birthday. He said this was one of the BEST Tres Leches he had ever had. I made the recipe as directed and topped fresh berries before serving. A great success!

My neice introduced us to this recipe a few months ago. We LOVE it! Super simple and very good, especially topped with fresh fruit. A friend tried it when we made it and loved it too, but she also modified it when she made it and it did not turn out. Follow the recipe and you will be happy!

After experiencing my first Tres Leches Cake in Richmond, VA, at a restaurant called Kuba Kuba, I thought I died and gone to heaven.  So, I ate it at a local Mexican restaurant in PA and was seriously let down, even though the later cake wasn't that bad.  
So, I tried this recipe.  I am a cooking enthusiast (never made a cake in my life, though) and made the cake with little problem.  My cake looked exactly like the cake in the picture above and tasted like the cake in the second restaurant.

I can't offer much in the way of tweaks or this or that, but I can say that the cake I made from this recipe, which I shared with my family and neighbors was an overwhelming success (even though I know there is a greater tasting cake out there, made by some clever Cubans in Richmond, VA).

Tried out this recipe because of the great reviews, and was very unhappy with the results. The cake was very bland.  Tres leches is my favorite cake and I have tried many tres leches in the Dominican Republic and in Colombia and this has no flavor. Too bad, I was hoping it wouldve tasted much better. The only thing that turned out well was the icing.

It seemed like it was too thin. I had to make two batches and just stack on top of each other. The flavor was very good.

I took this to a graduation celebration at a Mexican restaurant - and I sent the rest of the pan to the kitchen for the cooks and staff - they LOVED it! If fact, they were offering to PAY me to make more. Made as directed, but wimped out and used Cool Whip on top. Yummy - thanks!

Since its summer, I didn't bake the cake from the recipe, but used the milk mixture.  I used another reviewer's suggestion to use white cake, which was fine.  I used nonfat milk, so it was more liquidy than I had wanted, but that was my fault.  Next time I'll try 1 cup milk plus the evap and condensed milks.  It is great!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent recipe! I've tried many and this one is great. Usually I make the topping with sugar syrup and egg whites, but it's a hassle-this topping was very easy. I added about 2 tablespons of Rum and a dash of Creme de Cacao liquer to the milks, it gives a rich flavor. Refrigerate the cake overnight for best flavor.

Followed this recipe mostly as written and it turned out great!  Sweetness and liquids--issues other reviewers mentioned--were not an issue.  Guests gobbled it up and said I could make it again and again to share :)  I did pour the liquids over the cake when it had been out of the oven only 10 minutes or so (still warm) which probably helped soak up the milk.  Also used 1% instead of whole milk, but other than that followed closely what is given.

I really liked this cake. It was simple to make. I changed the liquids a little. I used 1 c. of milk, 1/2 can of evap. milk, and full can of condensed. The mixture came up to 2 c. and I only poured 1 c. on the cake. I also cut the sugar by half for the whipped topping and added a capful of bourbon to it. After letting the cake sit awhile after the milk glaze, I sliced 2 ripe bananas and placed them over the cake before covering with the whipped topping and sprinkling with cinnamon. My whole family loved it!

A+ recipe! However, I made a few changes. I separated the egg yokes from the egg whites, and added the yokes in just as the directions say to do for the eggs. Then, I added the flour/baking powder mixture 2 tablespoons at a time and beat. I then beat the egg whites separately and poured them into the batter and beat them for about 1 to 2 minutes, then poured them into 2 pans and baked and let cool.

I combined 1/2 cup of each milk, instead of a whole can to prevent the cake from being too soggy, and poured the milk mixture into a medium sized bowl and whisked the 3 milks together. And instead of 2 cups whole milk, I used 1/2 cup of half & half.  

After baking and letting the cakes cool, I poured the milk mixture over them, covered with foil, and let them sit in the fridge overnight.

If you coat your cake with a THIN layer of icing, this should prevent your cool whip from sinking into your cake after you put it on.

Thanks for a great recipe! Will make again and again!

My 11 yr old daughter made this for her Spanish class. It turned out great. She followed the recipe exactly. It is very rich and yummy. She was so proud of herself for being able to make this without my help. Next time we will serve it with fresh strawberries on top.

I got nervous & separated the eggs after reading the other reviews. My cake came out perfect. I didn't cool the cake before pouring the liquid over. I let the liquid absorb overnight and iced it the next day. Next time I'll garnish with marachino cherries just for looks. For people who can tolerate a very sweet cake, this is to die for. I think it's the best Tres Leches cake I've ever eaten.

I love the simple taste of this cake, moist and sweet. I got rave reviews by 2 of my coworkers who go to Mexico frequently and have access to the real deal! :-) However a bit too sweet for me, I think next time I will omit half cup of sugar from each the cake and the whipped cream...the condensed milk is sweet enough. Great recipe nonetheless! thx!

I would make this cake again butwould either double the amount of cake or lessen the amount of milks. There was too much milk in the bottom of the pan. I resorted to letting the cake slices sit on a couple of thicknesses of pape towels to soak up some of the mik mixture.

I decided to make this for a Cinco de Mayo party at work.  I'd never eaten it, much less made one.  It was super easy to make, and I enjoyed myself.  Added a bit of cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled some on top.  Took a jar of maraschino cherries, a jar of mango slices and a basket of fresh raspberries.  The people who HAVE had this before said it was delicious.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again, but I really did have fun making it.

This was my first time ever making or eating Tres Leches. It was interesting. I have to give the recipe 4 stars because it was easy to follow, easy to make and the flavours are really good. I am just a little weirded out by the soaked cake - the texture is so different from what I am used to.

Made this last night to take to work for Cinco de Mayo. Very, very rich. More than I am used to, but good. Made it especially for a co-worker who due to cancer treatment has lost a lot of weight and has to eat a softer diet. Noticed something sprinkled on top in the picture but the recipe didn't say anything about it. Cinnamon maybe>

Excellent cake! Tried this once before at a Cuban restaurant and found this to be as delicious. If you are looking for a dry or even moist cake, keep looking. From what I understand, this cake is supposed to be and is WET.  The cake was sweet enough for my taste after the milks were absorbed (1st poked many holes into the cake, poured in 2/3 of the mixed up milks - threw out the rest - and kept it in the refrigerator overnight).  Also, decreased the sugar in the whipped cream significantly as the cake with the milk inside is plenty sweet (in my opinion).  I just made my 1st one and will make another one this week for my husband's Cinco de Mayo work party : ) Thank you for this recipe!!

Excellent recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this yummy dessert. The only change that I made was to add pinch of salt into dry ingredients. Now I no longer have to travel to Miami to have a good Tres Leches.....!!!

There is something wrong with this recipe.  The cake was  very think and dry, and I took it out of the oven before 30 minutes were up.  It might have worked in an 8x8 pan, and half the milk sauce. It wasn't edible, and it was expensive to make.

i love making this cake. my family says its the best! and i agree! the only thing i would say is that the whipped cream comes out a little too thin, so i started using a different recipe so it doesnt run as much. also, I would like to know how to serve it outside of the pan so it is more presentable.

Made for a potluck.  It was good, but it did not taste like the ones I remember from my childhood.  I wish I knew the secret.  I will keep trying with some different twists.

I've been making this recipe for a long time now, it's my go-to cake recipe. Everyone LOVES it. They say it's better than the tres leches cakes we order from Mexican markets. I follow it exactly, except I don't use the "frosting" they have here. It's not as good. I just use Cool Whip as my frosting. This is delicious and extremely moist. So good. Also, after I pour the milk over the cake, I let it sit for at least 24 hours. The longer the better! After I let it sit, then I frost it.

Just made this tonight, and it was very good.  I've had Tres Leches in many different restaurants, including in Guatemala.  This is not as good as Guatemala, but it is close.  Also, I think it is worth mentioning that it is relatively easy.  I am not the best at baking, but I managed pretty well.

Tres Lecehs cake is supposed to be wet.  If it is simply moist, its just cake. Just to clear up for those who may not be familiar with how it should come out.

Followed the recipe exactly. I know what Tres Leche cake is supposed to be like.  The cake turned out too dense like a brick and started to float when I added the Milk filling.  Even by the next day it had not absorbed the milk filling.  Tried another recipe that had a white cake mix, that turned out great. Sorry, hate to leave a bad review since there were so many good reviews before mine....:(

This cake was WAY too sweet. I would reduce the sugar in the cake to 2/3 of a cup and also only use 2/3 of a cup for the whipped cream. Otherwise it was good. I added a teaspoon of orange extract and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the cake and it gave it a nice flavor.

Delicious! I love this recipe : ) I followed the recipe - except - I seperated the egg yolks/whites. Whipped them both seperately and then added them to the cake mix. My Hubby loved this cake too. So rich. A little goes a long way. Enjoy! : )

This cake is delicious....but a bit too much milk. I would suggest lessoning the milk...or.... add the milk to each piece at it is served. Overall....awesome!

To go along with what DICKSIELEE said about separating the eggs, I have found that as long as you add the eggs one at a time and incorporate each one well before adding the next, you get great results every time.

Too milky.  If you like custard in sponge form, this cake is for you. I refrigerated overnight and in the morning milk mixture still did not absorb.  I poked the cake another 20 times or so hoping the mixture would absorb.  I wanted to give this cake a try so I poured the mixture off into a bowl, hoping to salvage it.  I ended up starting from scratch with another recipe.

This is the first time I have made and ate a Tres Leches Cake.  Always wanted to taste one.  This is different then your normal cake because it s more wet then moist.  I followed the directions except I only used about 3/4 of the milk mixture and I topped the whipped cream with carmel sauce.  I thought the cake was ok but my husband loved it.  For me it was the texture I didn't like though the cake did taste good.  My husband grew up eating desserts similar to this.  I give it four stars since my husband loved.

Excellent, although VERY rich!  Regarding the half and half vs. milk debate:  I measured out my whipping cream for the topping in advance, and then combined what remained from the pint that I had bought with 1% milk for the filling (in addition to the recommended amounts of evaporated and  condensed milk.)  It took several hours of slow and patient soaking for the milk to absorb, and even then there was a little left that wouldn't absorb, but it made a delicious sauce when spooned over each serving.  As a final touch I sprinkled the cake with cinnamon and nutmeg (as shown in the picture).

This cake was so delicious! I've made it twice now, first time I followed the original recipe~which is fabulous and the 2nd time I added 2/3 cup agave instead of sugar, and 2 TBSP of rum to the cake batter. I also added 2 tsp of godiva liquer to the milk portion. I let it soak and just top each piece with fat free cool whip and sprinkle with cinnamon. Everyone begs for this recipe!

I have made this cake SEVERAL times for my family get togethers and it is requested every time. It is sooooo goood! DO NOT toss out any extra milk, if there is extra try to poke many more holes in the cake so it absorbs.   So yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I had never even heard of this before but my supervisor asked me to make it for a work party. It was very good, I followed it exactly. I had my doubts when pouring on all the milk, I thought it would be too much, but the cake really does absorb it like a sponge and expands quite a bit with the added liquid. There was also a little extra liquid at the bottom of the dish which some opted to spooning this over their slice. The cake was very good, very very sweet and rich and so it serves quite a few people because we cut the slices so thin. The most important thing about this cake is to keep it very cold otherwise it becomes soggy and of course the milk will go bad. Interesting cake, but very delicious.

Tres Leches  is my favorite cake next to pineapple upside-down cake and it's hard to find a good recipe. This one is the 4th I've tried and it's perfect, really a gorgeous dessert that makes people think I am a baking genius.

Don't get me wrong, this tasted good, and my guests said they really liked it, but I can definitely see what other reviewers meant by the eggy flavor of the cake. I also thought the sauce was missing a little bit of the mouth feel that it needed. Maybe cream instead of milk would do the trick? Good, but not quite perfect. The hunt is still on for the best ever tres leches cake.

Very, very yummy. I cut back on the milk because it seemed like too much liquid. Next time I would do it as the recipe calls for. The extra moisture would have been nice.

Great recipe, the only draw back was that the bread could have been a little more fluffy. Next time I make this I will be adding more butter to the cake batter. My family enjoyed this very much. (I added fresh strawberries as filling and also topped the cake with the same mixture).

This was interesting and pretty good.  I decided to bake it on Cinco De Mayo.  I have a tip for other impatient people, like myself.  After the cake cools for about 15 minutes out of the oven, place it in the freezer for 20-30 minutes to cool it all the way before pouring the milk mixture over the top.  Then you need to let it sit in the fridge till the cake soaks up the liquid.  I served with cool whip and strawberries.  It wasn't as popular in my house as most cakes are but it wasn't bad.

I gave this recipe four stars because my family enjoyed it.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it came out just fine.  However, it wasn't what I thought it would be.  I was expecting a tiramisu-like cake.  It just tasted like a sweet, wet cake.

I think this recipe would have been better if I lived at a more normal altitude.  I live at 9,000 ft above sea level and that causes baking to sometimes not turn out the way I would have expected.  There was way too much liquid even after letting it sit for a couple of days.  The cake did not rise so it was rather flat.  Like I said earlier, it might have been because of the altitude and since the cake was flat, that might have caused the excess liquid.  It tasted good, but I probably would not make this again unless we move.

I made this cake this morning, and when I mixed the milks together, it seemed like a large amount as other viewers have said. I ended up dumping the excess amount out after i realized it would not all soak into the cake. the cake itself tastes pretty good, but next time i make, i will prob add crushed pineapple on top and use less milk. i may even use cream instead of whole milk, and only about 1 cup total of cream.

This was the first time I've ever made this type of cake.  Turned out pretty good, with minor changes.  After mixing the milks together, I thought wow, there's more milk than cake.  It seemed a ridiculous amount.  So I only spooned on probably about 1/4 of what the whole recipe called for, just enough to moisten through the whole cake.   I jarred the rest of the milk mixture to make another one in the next day or so. And I cheated on the topping.  I just used cool whip.

This recipe is so off.  Too much sugar, way too much milk, for the soaking you're supposed to uses 1/4 c. heavy cream, 1 each of the milks and use ALL BUT 1 cup of the milk mixture or the cake will be soggy. You use 2 c of heavy cream beat w/ only 3 TBL sugar. The topping isn't supposed to be super sweet.

I followed some of the other review's suggestion and used 1 cup of milk instead of 2. Next time I will also cut back on the sugar. It was way too sweet. But overall it was delicious. It was dense and moist just like the restaurant. Will definelty make again!

Amazing Cake!  First time and everyone enjoyed it. Very easy to make ....just used 1/2 cup sugar for the whipped cream for the top. Loved that you make this ahead, perfect for company. Many have never tasted this type of cake.

Overall, true Tres Leches Cake.  I only added 1/2 cup of the sugar to the whipped cream and it was perfect!  I would also cut the 3 milks in half b/c it was a little too runny for me.  Next time, I will take the advice of other reviewers and separate the eggs as well b/c my cake seemed a little flat.  Otherwise, the taste was great, but very, very sweet!

This is a great recipe but very sweet. 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk can be cut back to a 12 oz can or a bit less. Used only one cup of 2% milk instead of 2 c. I also only put in about 3 Tablespoons of sugar in the whipping cream and nothing near a full cup.

I loved this cake! It is creamy and melt in your mouth moist. I am not a great lover of cake because of the dryness factor, but this eliminates that altogether

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband liked it. I think maybe I just do not have a taste for Tres Leches because I thought it was disgusting. I tried it several times, hoping maybe it would get better as the cake absorbed the milks, but it just tasted like soggy cornbread to me. I have make cornbread and dip it in a glass of milk with a lot less effort. I will not make this again... .but maybe it's just me.

We haven't taken a bit yet, but wanted to share what WE did. We took the advice of the Sage One who used Half & Half...and added our own twist. We had double birthdays last month and were surprised by sister, Terry and her hubby Ron, with a wonderful meal topped off by a Spice Cake baked in a round bundt pan. We felt like royalty! Sis is very special to us and therefore WE wanted to do something special for her birthday this month. We baked our Tres Leches in heart shaped bundt pan. German meets Latino! We popped the cooled cake out of the pan then added sliced kiwi and a mixture of frozen berries to the "bottom" of the pan and put the cake back in the way it was baked. We then poked the holes - we suggest a stick of raw spaghetti - poured the milk mixture over all, covered with foil for transport. We've got the fresh whipped cream ready to take along and have great hope that it all pops out properly so we can bring some beautiful AND delicious cake to Terry for her 59th birthday!

This was a great recipe, very true to all things I consider a tres leches cake should be: rich, creamy, sweet, etc.  I followed another reviewer's advise to trim the sides off the cake so that it really absorbed all the milk.  My only complaint is that I found the recipe just a little bit too sweet.  I think next time I might put a little less condensed milk.  Great recipe!

I got so many compliments on this cake! The only thing I would do differently next time is 1) put a little less sugar when making the whipped cream (the cake itself is already soooo sweet!); 2) even out the batter before I bake it because my cake came out shaped like a mountain rather than flat; 3) sprinkle cinnamon or add strawberries to it on top of the whipped cream. This is a wonderful recipe that anyone can enjoy!

Followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I made it 2 days ago for my sister in law and her family, they are all from Puerto Rico, and they told me it was amazing, so I was so happy. Definately saving this recipe!

Made this for Christmas for my brother who was coming in from San Antonio.  He fashions himself as a connoisseur of fine Tres Leches cakes because it's his favorite.  Huge success!    I suggest that you make sure you let the butter get really soft before mixing it with the sugar.  It's hard to cream butter and sugar if the butter is still clumping up.  I also suggest "basting" the milk mixture while the cake is soaking it up.  That way the center gets it's fair share.

Delicious cake. The whipped cream topping holds up very well for a few days in the fridge. This cake rivals the best ones I've had in south/central america. I substitute a half cup of whipping cream for the milk

This cake turned out divine!!!  I did heed the advice of some previous posters and seperated my eggs. Cake was very light and "spongy".  I poured the amount of milk called for with no changes and it turned out beautifully.  I did simple whipped cream on top with very little sugar in it.  My BIL told me this was his new favorite cake and requested it for his birthday!!!

This is my all time favorite dessert and I normally beg others to make it for me but this recipe was awesome. I frozen the left overs and still treat myself to a sweet treat whenever i have the craving.

Tasty Tres Leches! If anything I would increase the volume of the milk mixture. I added a 1/4 tsp. of baking soda with the baking powder, added only 3/4 cup sugar with the butter and separated the eggs (mixed the yolks with the creamed sugar mixture and beat the whites until soft peaks formed and added the 1/4 cup sugar, beat until stiff peaks, folded into egg yolk/sugar mix). Served the cake with strawberries and bluberries. Had the cake for desert one night, then brought the remainder to the office. I went to see what was left at the end of the day and found the clean cake pan drying by the sink.

This cake was easy to make, followed the recipes without making any changes, but i think it was too soggy, if i ever make this again id think i wouldn't put all the milk in. The taste was good though.

Excellent flavor, and the filling/sauce is exactly the right amount to soak into the cake with just a teensy bit left in the bottom of the pan.  I didn't use NEARLY as much sugar in the whipped cream--that would have been WAY too sweet!  And I made the cake as a sponge-type, whipping the egg whites separately.

I made this one for my sister-in-law's birthday- I'd never heard of/had it before this. I liked it well enough, and the family said it was 'good', so I guess it passes the taste tests. Bottom line: I'd make it again.

I used 1 cup of milk instead of two with the condensed and evaporated milk and I was told the cake was dryer than it is supposed to be. I think I would like the cake to be more pudding like as I understand it should be. I used 3/4 cup of sugar in the topping and it was too sweet for us. If I made this cake again I'd only use 1/4 cup of sugar in the whipping cream.

Very Good!! I felt like it was too much liquid and maybe that was because I used a box cake instead of the cake recipe. However it was very good. Will make again...after I loose the pounds from making the first one :)

I took the cake to a cinco de mayo party at work.  I added a twist and put strawberries and cool whip on top.  The office folks loved it.  I, however, didn't care for it.  So it got a four star.  Too much liquid for my taste.  Next time, I'll half the liquid amount.

Goodness gracious. I've been looking all over the place for a Tres Leches Cake similar to those I've had while visiting Miami and this one is dead-on! To me, a good Tres Leches cake is dense and soaks up the milk without becoming too soggy. It should also have a rich, buttery, vanilla flavor. This cake succeeds on both points. I didn't even have whipped cream to top the cake, so sprinkled a cup of shredded coconut  top.

I was really disappointed after all the effort, wasted ingredients, and waiting.  After I mixed up all the liquid and saw how much it was, I was hesitant to pour it all over the cake, but I did anyway.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  The next day it tasted like a big wet cake.  Forget about it looking presentable or even frosting it.  It was way too sweet too.  The best part was the fresh whipped cream and the toasted coconut I put on top.  I've only had tres leche cake from an american bakery, so don't know if it is the authentic version that I'm used to. That cake was not soaked through and was wonderfully light and moist. I was not prepared for such a wet cake.

I made this for a big family gathering and served it with a hot pot of good coffee. Everyone was a little skeptacle about the prospect of eating soggy cake, but after trying it---they were sold. I found my sisters hovering around the pan later that night. The only chage I made to the recipe was to decrease the sugar to 1/3 c. in the whip cream and substite half skim milk and half 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk mixture (I don't buy whole milk). It turned out lovely. I would make this again.

Superb dessert. I have never had Tres Leches no less made one before. I followed the advice of Peggy Ann and used half and half instead of whole milk, though I used the full amount - 2 cups. I let the milk mixture sit overnight before adding the Cool Whip topping ( I used the the low-fat ). Garnished with fresh strawberries and bananas. A bite with the strawberries tasted like a moist short cake and a bite with bananas was like banana creme pie! I really do recommend adding a topping as it made the cake come together.

This cake turned out to be great, I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk but it still turned out way too watery to the point where the milk was dripping all over the place.  So because of that, I'm giving it 4 stars.

I actually got this recipe from a friend and lost it but this one sounds the same going from my memory for the basic cake and icing ingredients. However i'll suggest some additions that make it the best cake i've ever tasted... try them you'll see what i mean.  Instead of whole mile use coconut milk and i like to add a little coconut rum to both the milk mixture used to soak the cake in and the icing just a little to taste. then once you are ready to ice the cakes, add mandarin oranges between the layers and on top. Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm delicious!

Excellente!  loved this cake, its exactly what I used to buy at the Mexican bakery in Ca.  I had some friends over for a Mexican dinner and they all liked very much. I followed the recipe to a T, but I baked in a 9" round pan.  Next time I am going to bake 2 cakes, let the bottom soak up all the 3 milks and then spread a strawberry filling (I love strawberries)and then put the other soaked cake on top and spread the cream/sugar topping.  I can't wait to try it this way.  I will keep you posted. Thank you for shring this exceptionally delicious recipe.

This recipe was such a hit. I took this to a mexican themed dinner party and I can not tell you how many compliments I got. I did take other reviewers advice. I baked the cake the night before, let it cool, poked it with over 200 holes, and let the milk mixture soak in over night. I also only used 3/4 cup of sugar for the frosting. All the milk soaked it perfectly and it was an absolutely delicious cake!! I will definitely make this again.

A nice, basic Tres Leches Cake, but not outstanding like the one I had from the Mexican pastelria.  Better with the suggestions that other reviewers have made, like using 1 cup milk instead of 2 and cutting way down on the sugar for the whipped cream frosting.  We really liked it best when the middle was filled with raspberry preserves...don't know if that's traditional, though.  Also, there are not 4 types of milk in this cake, only 3...heavy cream is not considered a "milk" since there is no protein in it.

This review is long overdue.  I first made this cake back in March 08, and ever since then it has been requested from me numerous times.  It is definetly a hit and a family favorite.  I only changed one thing, which is a preference of mine, I add a little cinnamon.  And thats it, it is a winner every time!!!  Try it, you will love it!

A bit too sweet for my taste buds.  I'd ease it up on the sugar for the filling.  Heck, maybe just all cool whip and not anything else.

I am from Costa Rica and this recipe tastes like home. It is greats. One tip though: make sure you don't press down the flour when you measure it. Just kind of shake the measuring cup until it is level with the top. This makes a big difference in how much liquid the cake absorbs.

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting a can of coconut milk for the whole and topping the final product with shredded coconut. We almost fought over the last piece!! A perfect Tres Leches recipe in my opinion. Thank you!

This is one of the best recipes I have tried for 3 leches - my husband's favorite cake.  I did a few things to make at least a slightly MORE HEALTHY VERSION.  First, I used half Splenda and half normal sugar to go inside the cake (1/2 c. each).  It says to use unsalted butter w/the ingredient list, but in the recipe it mentions margarine.  I just used a lowfat  margarine (smart choice).   (I didn't have any at the time, but you could use egg substitute as well to cut even more fat & calories.) I baked that, and it came out perfect.  For the liquids, I used normal swt cond. milk, but I only used about 8-10 oz of evap milk (you could use low fat, but don't do nonfat evap. milk - there just isn't enough flavor).  Then I used 2% milk to make up the difference until I had a little over four cups of liquid.  If you prick the cake with a fork and pour the liquid in while it is still warm (wait at least 15 min though), it really soaks up the liquid well.  Pour slowly and wait until what you have already poured is soaked in before adding more.  I used lowfat cool whip on top.  Definitely put in the fridge for at least an hour.  To make it just that much more special, when serving I top it with sugared strawberries on top.  Just take sliced, fresh strawberries (or thawed frozen strawberries) and sweeten them to taste.  Again, I use half Splenda and half sugar to cut calories.  Thanks for a wonderful, wonderful cake!

This is a great recipe.  The trick to getting it to come out right is pouring the milk on while it is still warm and refrigerating it overnight.  No mush, no fuss.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I used a fork to poke a LOT of holes and poured the milk over the warm cake---it soaked up all of the liquid almost right away.  I did add some cinnamon and citrus (orange and lemon juice) to the milk mix.  I also added lime zest to the whipping cream.  I topped with kiwi, papaya, and mango.  Everyone adored it and my husband has even requested this cake for his birthday.

Make sure you cool in the fridge over night before adding the icing. A friend also recommended you cut off a very thin top layer before pouring over the milk.

Perfect recipe.  I topped the cake with sliced strawberries and then covered it with the whipped cream.  Also I always use confectioners sugar when whipping cream, a couple of tablespoons.

I made this recipe last night.  It was awful. The cake was hard and there was WAY too much liquid.  I tried it this morning after letting it soak in the fridge over-night. Still awful. Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe directions to a "T". Sorry.

I followed the advice of another member who made 2 changes 1. Use 2 14-oz cans of condensed milk and 2. Use only 10 oz of evaporated milk (2 5-oz cans). I made it the night before and it turned out fabulous.

I've never had real Tres Leches before so I have nothing to compare this to, but I thought that this was a pretty good cake.  I followed the recipe as written and used skim milk.  I put the milk over the cake in "layers", but eventually decided to let it sit in the fridge for a while to absorb the milk as it did not seem to be absorbing any more milk after letting it stand for 20 minutes.  Maybe I didn't poke enough holes in the cake(?), but I had at least a half a cup of milk left and a few hours later there was still quite a bit of milk in the dish that had not been absorbed.  It was nice to try it, but I don't think that I will be making it again.

Delicious! Everyone loved it. I needed to make a birthday cake and chose to do this one, however one layer 1 and 1/2"  was not enough, so I made a second layer and added dulce de leche in the middle. On the second layer I beat the egg whites on the side until hard, this made the second layer 1/4" higher and fluffier! I would suggest that as the only change, everything else is just perfect, and the dulce de leche in the middle made it even better!!!

This is an awesome cake!  We had an exchange student living with us from Mexico and she said this was her favorite type of cake expecially for her birthday.  So I made this one and she expressed that it was even better than she gets back in Mexico. I go alittle less on the liquid because I think too much liquid sits at the bottom. Very good - a very sweet cake and light cake!

Made this for my boyfriend who is a native of Costa Rica.  He loved it, I was hesitant to try it but ended up enjoying it a lot.  I did bake it in a smaller pan as I did not have one large enough, but I loved the thick slices.  I also added only 1/3 cup of flour to the whipping cream for the topping.  We let it cool completely, slowly added the milk, covered it in the fridge overnight and added the whipped topping in the morning.  We had two pieces for breakfast.  Easy to make and very tasty!  Definitely try this recipe if you enjoy tres leches.

I was looking for an alternative to just the usual strawberry shortcake type dessert for summer and found this. This cake is delicious! Regarding another review that said that it was too eggy, I did find it "eggy" tasting when I tried it about an hour after making it. However, after it was refrigerated overnight, it was perfect and not eggy at all. Maybe the milk mixture just needed more time to soak in thoroughly. I was a little nervous pouring the milk mixture on because it seemed like so much, but I found the amount of liquid left over later was perfect to keep it nice and moist. My family has already requested I make it again. Great recipe!

The flavor of this cake is amazing!  It was the first time I made a Tres Leche cake.  I made it on a Wednesday for my husband and I, and the entire cake was gone by Saturday morning.  The only problem was it was a little soggy, and I already cut the milk amount in half.  I will experiment with different amounts of liquid next time.  Awesome recipe!

First, I did make a few changes...instead of the condensed milk, I used 1 can of cream of coconut. And I baked in a 9 inch round cake pan. The cake came out much heavier than I expected. The batter was so light and fluffy, I thought the cake would bake up very light too. But the cake was rather dense which is also why I think i had trouble with the cake absorbing all the liquid. I think the cake's texture was just too dense to absorb all the liquid. However, the taste was really good and I had people ask for seconds. I would use this recipe again for a coconut cake...but for tres leches, I want a lighter, fluffier cake recipe.

I made this cake tonight and it was really good! I was worried at first when It came out of the oven because it looked so flat and boring but when I added the milk it turned out pretty good! I didn't add all the milk though. I left some out so that I could pour over each slice as I served. I think a little drizzle of the extra milk around the slice is perfect and also gives it a nice presentation along with fresh strawberries and whip cream on top. :) I also add the whip cream individually (i cheated and bought one of those cans of whip cream). But it was too thin I think for me and I used a 9x13 inch glass pan too. I am going to double this recipe next time and use the same pan cuz I love thicker cake. :) I'm glad I found this recipe! thanks alot!

This got a lot of compliments when I brought it to a Cinco de Mayo-themed dinner meeting. I made a few changes: I used only 1-1/2 cups of 2% milk, instead of 2 cups of whole milk, and substituted evaporated skim milk and low-fat sweetened condensed milk for the full fat versions. I also used Lite Cool Whip for the topping. It was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

Tres leches doesn't do much for me but I live in Honduras and the people here love it.  They said that it was great and were impressed that the "gringa" made it.  Apparently it is traditionally topped with cherries but I used strawberries and they loved it.  Thanks.

My son needed to make a tres leches for his Spanish class.  After reviewing the other tres leches recipes we chose this one.  The class enjoyed this cake very much. I would recommend cutting back a bit on the whole milk as it was just a little moist.

I have made this cake for a couple years and it is delicious.  I have even tripled the recipe to feed a baptism party and it always comes out delicious.  The only thing I have changed is instead of using whole milk I use half&half and instead of using a fork to poke holes in I use a butter knife.  It seems to absorb better.  
I have also tried it with my homemade chocolate frosting and it came out amazing.

I made this over the weekend for a Mexican night with friends.  The cake was a hit!  I made as the directions stated, the only change I made was adding sliced strawberries under the icing.  The natural sugar was a nice contrast to all of the milk sweetness. I will definitely make this again.

this recipe is the best because I have made different recipes that call for a cake mix which rises higher so only half the cake is soaked in the milk mixture--so if it looks too low it's for a reason--delicous!!

This is a great recipe.  Even my picky "June Cleaver" mother-in-law enjoyed it.  I used a slightly smaller baking pan (8x11) pan, and opted to hold back about 1.5 cups of the milk mixture.  Made for a nice consistency -- not too soggy.  Served the extra milk in a pitcher on the side, but no one opted to add extra.  I had to sneak an extra piece after our guests went home.  Looking for any opportunity to make this again!!

I made this recipe for my husband's christmas party and it was a huge success.  His boss even asked if I could make it for him and his wife and offered to pay me for it, that's how much he loved it.  I made it with the few  changes to the whipped topping, but the rest I left the same.

Excellent cake!  Very easy to make.  If you like a really moist cake, this is for you.  You'll never believe that the cake absorbs all of the milk mixture, but it does.  I served mine with strawberries and got rave reviews.

I took another reviewer's idea and substituted 1/2 of the whole milk for coconut milk. That was an amazingly good idea. Unfortunately, the cake batter seemed really thick (like glue) and it came out like a biscuit. I kept basting it with the milk and putting holes in it after it had cooled but it wouldn't really absorb much. I had frozen butter and tried to thaw it on the stove (resulting in a little melted butter as you can imagine), so that might be the trouble.  Will try again, because even as a milk-clogged biscuit, it was still good!  :)

Great recipe, easy and came out great. I did whip egg whites separately and fold in. I would just add fruit or liquor as it is rather bland.  Kept for 2 days and we snarfed it all down.

Absolutely the best tres leches I've ever had. I didn't add all of the milk because I thought it would be too soggy, I maybe added all but half a cup or so of the milk mixture. I also added strawberries on top for garnish because it looks kinda plain, it needed to be dressed up a bit.

not many folks have heard of this one, I made this one time as a special request. It went over big with the people who knew what it was. It's actually a little too rich for my taste, which is somewhat hard to believe, I have an enormous sweet tooth!!

This cake will now be one of my favorites! I made it for Christmas and my family loved it. I however added one more can of condensed milk like the other reviews suggested and I used only 1/4 c. sugar for the topping.  I advise the more holes you make in the cake the better the milk absorbs in.  Next time I will add fruits like kiwi or peaches on top for a zing!

This is a great recipe. I only have one comment.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar for the whipped topping, and it still was a little to sweet, next time I would use 1/4 cup instead, but overall it is wonderful!!

This is delicious! I would follow the other recommendation of increasing the condensed milk though, as it could stand to be a little bit sweeter. I made many cuts into the cake and allowed the milk to soak in over night. It was great.

This recipe is really good if you add sliced strawberries(fresh, or in syrup; I put the syrup in too) or try other fruit such as canned pineapple (crushed or tidbits).  I have had it like this at many Mexican birthday parties.

Great tasting recipe - I made it for a party and it got great reviews. Next time I think I'll pour off a bit of the liquid, I'll also consider doubling the cake recipe since it came out pretty thin.

Although tasty, the cake was very thin and there was far too much liquid.  Also, the icing was extremely sweet.  I would make this cake again in a smaller pan, the filling reduced to half the condensed and whole milks, use much less sugar in the whipping cream and let the cake absorb the liquid overnight in the fridge.

The recipe for tres leches was excellent,but using a straw was optional!!The colombian recipe didn't seem too soup like texture. either way it was dammed good, and I was happy I found the recipe as a matter of fact I'm eatting some now as we speak w/ less milk and more wine

Thank you, 300Lb chunkie

There must be a misprint in this recipe.  I agree with the other reviewer who said there is way too much liquid.  I think one cup of milk instead of two.  Also, my cake came out really flat -- perhaps it should be baked in a smaller pan.  I ended up cutting mine up into cubes and storing it in a big bowl with all the liquid poured over and ate it as a bread pudding.  Not attractive, but definitely delicious!

This is a delicious cake, very easy to prepare and the cake absorbs the milks like a sponge, unlike other recipes I've tried.  This cake is a slight variation of the Nicaraguan recipe and my family loves it.

There was too much liquid indicated in the recipe for the cake to absorb. I decided to serve it in a pool of the liquid so that I could figure out what to do with it.

I loved this recipe and so did my family but I changed a couple things along the way. First I separated the egg yolks and whites, putting the yolks into the batter first and whipping and folding in the whites at the end. Instead of using all whole milk I used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 cream (aka Half and Half). I let mine sit in the fridge overnight before serving, it’s the best the next day. Also be sure not to add too much vanilla to your whipped cream because it can make the cake seem way too sweet. Strawberries makes a DELICIOUS topping, the cake is pretty sweet so it adds a nice tartness to the recipe :)

I  loved this recipe. Firstly, It was very quick and easy to make and I  added a few minor changes. Second, I  substituted one cup of whole milk for a can of cream of coconut (I  used coco Lopez). I  always prefer this with a coconutty flavor lol.  After reading several helpful ratings, I  cooked the cake I  used a chop stick to make several holes and closely cut off the edges. This allowed the milk to fully saturate the cake which I  did approximately 5-7 minutes after removing from oven. I  then covered with foil and refrigerated for the next day.  it was a huge hit with my sons.

Yum!  I sub out 1/2 cup of the milk for kahlua, use cool whip for the topping and boxed white cake mix.  I also copied another user's advice to poke holes in the cake with a chopstick after it's out of the oven for 5 minutes, add the liquid, and then put it back in the oven (oven off) for 10 mins.  My coworkers who usually don't like tres leches because it's too sweet, rave about this one!

I love this recipe. I made this two days before serving, this gave the cake time to soak  up the milk mixture. When serving, I placed the whipped cream on individual cakes. I put cinnamon or chocolate shavings on top of the whipped cream. My guest's loved the flavor, it was delicious! I will definitely make this again!!

Such an awesome recipe. I’m Uzbek so we’ve never heard of this dessert but I saw it at a shop once and it looked yummy. Decided to find a recipe and this one had the most reviews so I decided to try this first! Made it EXACTLY as written the first time, and it was perfect! SO many good reviews! Second time I added heavy cream instead of the milk to soak, and it was toooo rich. Third time I fluffed the egg whites and folded them in, cake was a lot drier and needed more liquid and broke up quicker.

I am not a huge fan of Tres Leches cake. But I don't hate it. So when I suggested to my husband that I try and make us one, I did my research. I really like the review from Rob (below) who suggests putting the cake back in the oven after pouring the milk over it. And I must say, after refrigerating over night, the texture is much better. 
I also used only 1 cup of whole milk instead of 2 cups. Everything else I left the same. I also used another suggestion where you beat the whites separate and fold them in, just to try my skills. I like this cake.

I would def watch the video first. The instructions alone can mess you up. Also, prob cut back on the sugar for the whipped topping. Honestly, I don’t bake a lot, so this was a little exhausting, so it might be a while before I attempt this again

Moist and delicious!  I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. I decided to make it in a  regular rectangular Pyrex mold and leave it there since I was going to transport it.  Serving it that way was easy too. 
 Once  I took the cake out of the oven I let it rest for about 10 minutes,  then poked the holes with the fork and poured the leche mixture over it. Looking through the glass I noticed the bottom of the cake was not getting the mixture so  I used a thin metal spatula to separate the edges from the glass and the  mixture flowed easily to the bottom.  I also used a bit less sugar both times and it came out just right.

I made for the first time, in a 8 x 9 dark baking pan, this was a challenge so well worth it. Next time gotta adjust the liquid ratios of milk, I did not get condensed milk, I could not find it at Aldis, I bought half and half instead it worked fine. I will definitely be making this again in the future!

Used an 8x8 glass pan and reduced the whole milk by 1/2 cup.  Required an extra 10 min baking, and it came out great with a 2" cake.  I also put the cake back into the warm oven as suggested by another review and the milk got absorbed easily.  The cake was delicious and approved by my kids!

I'm surprised to see this recipe so highly rated. First off, the cake was too eggy. 5 eggs is way too much, and leaves the cake tasting and smelling like overcooked fried eggs. The whipped cream was too sweet too. In combination with all the sugar already in the cake, it was almost not edible. I'm also surprised to see no cinnamon in the recipe. I added half a stick of cinnamon to my homemade evaporated milk and that definitely made a difference, but there's nothing you can do to fix the eggy taste of the cake.

This is the 4th time I'm making this cake for work.  I follow the recipe to a T.  I work with a lot of hispanic people and have been told this is the best they've had.  My secret is not really a secret.  I sprinkle, very  lightly,  brown sugar cinnamon mix (cinnamon toast) on top of the whipped cream.  It's gone by the end of the day!  No leftovers!

I was so worried this wasn't going to come out like it should. But I got rave reviews from my coworkers. I did look at the comments for some helpers, the best was who ever said to put the cake back into the oven (hot but not on) after poking and pour the milk mixture into it. I adjusted the ingredients for 48 servings.

I would not recommend this recipe. The cake turns out incredibly flat and eggy, and the liquid does not absorb, leaving you with a cake floating in milk. In addition, the whipped cream is way too sweet, even with only using half the amount of sugar required.

This recipe needs a lot of tweaking. Eggs need to be separated to make the cake more fluffy. The cake itself ended up tasting too much like eggs. I have tried a lot of recipes to make this cake and this one is not very good. I also suggest putting vanilla in the milk soak and sprinkling cinnamon on the top of the cake. If you really like cinnamon you could also put some into the cake batter.

This is a great recipe, i’d recommend pouring the milk over the cake after its completely cooled and doing it slowly. Also make sure to add cinnamon for the final touch!

This is the best tres leches cake recipe I’ve found, so-far. I used half the amount of whole milk the recipe called for because it’s always way too wet (probably because of where I live). I will also scale back on the sugar next time because it was much too sweet. I think 1/2 cup in the whipped cream would be plenty.

Too sweet. That's a lot coming from me because I like sweet things.  I always make the recipe as is the first round so I made no substitutions. I don't think I will make it again as I didn't like the texture much either.  Others may like it but it's not my cup of tea.

This cake was pretty disappointing... There was WAY too much liquid and it wasn’t thick enough. It sat like a lake on my cake and the whole thing was very soggy and sweet. The topping was very sweet too, I would even consider not adding any sugar to it. IMO the recipe was okay but there is definitely something off about the cake and the filling, I’m pretty sure that isn’t how you make a sponge cake and that you’re supposed to separate the egg yolks. In the end, we ended up throwing it away because it was inedibly too sweet and a soggy mess even though I bake regularly and followed the recipe to a T.

Yes I made it. It was nice, I made a couple of changes; 1)For the whipping cream topping I added 1 tsp of almond essence, 2) Toasted almonds on top of the cinnamon.

I made the recipe, following it as written. I found the cake to be a good consistency, dense but tender and the ratio of the milks to be perfect.  I did let it cool before adding the milk mixture and pierced the cake a lot...it absorbed the milk ,almost all of it.  I let it sit for 2 days before we ate it.  I made the whipped cream, but used confectioners sugar vs. regular sugar.  I also chopped up strawberries and sprinkled them on top and then grated some bittersweet chocolate...it was out of this world...will definitely make it again.

I personally did not like the taste, it does not taste authentic. What I would suggest is that you only put 1/2 c sugar in the whipped cream for the topping because it is way too sweet as is. I would also add 2 cans of condensed milk to the liquid portion as that was not sweet enough. This recipe is definitely missing something for the cake part as well.

This is my first time making this and I was satisfied but I will make changes next time. The whipped topping was very sweet to me so I will cut the sugar a bit next time. Also I wish I had thought to read the reviews on this. I poked the cake with the fork shortly after it came out thinking the holes would help it cool faster. Someone else mentioned they just seal back up bc it’s still hot. Also I grew impatient waiting for it to soak in since videos I watched seemed to make it seem like it only took about 10 mins. I poured the majority of the milk mix but dumped the rest, maybe 1/4 cup? And also some hadn’t soaked in so I poured some off too. Had I known, I would’ve let it soak overnight. Next time I will. I sprinkled cinnamon on top. 
Overall, I think the cake was very good. I’ll make it again with the changes. And possibly use a cake mix instead of the scratch recipe here too. Thanks for the recipe :)

Follow preparation instructions! I tried whipping eggs separately and adding to batter as others have recommended, and it made the cake so dense. Perhaps user error, but existing directions worked well.

This was my first attempt at tres leches cake and everyone liked it!  I followed as is except I removed 1/2 cup milk and added 1/2 cup cream.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top.  The milk and cinnamon reminded me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

This turned out great! I poked tons of holes on top, and reduced the sugar in the whipped cream to only 1/3 c. Was still plenty sweet! I'm at high altitude and didn't need to make any adjustments for baking.

I have a question rather than a comment.  The instructions on the whipped topping doesn't make sense to me. When it says, "Whip whipping cream, the remaining 1 cup of sugar and the remaining 1 tsp of vanilla" Remaining? The recipe never says to separate anything up to that point. It says in the left column of ingredients 1 cup of white sugar, and point 3 of the directions it says to add one cup of sugar. The right column of ingredients where the whipped topping is listed it says 1 cup of white sugar but in number 7 of the instructions it says "the remaining cup of sugar" what? Where did it get separated? Same with vanilla. Where did it get separated? So confusing.

It was fully edible, but eggy and waaaaay too sweet.  I was skeptical about not beating the eggs separately, but I followed the simple instructions, and the cake was alright, it wasn't a pancake like I feared it might be.  

After tasting the moistened cake, I only added a quarter cup of sugar to the cream for the topping, but still the whole thing was way too sweet.  If I make this again, I'll try 1/2 cup of sugar for the cake instead of 1, and 4 eggs.  And perhaps try whisking the whites separately and see what that does.

It made a pretty good cake for my first ever attempt on a Tres Leches. It is slightly eggy but I didn't really notice it. Definitely too much sugar for the cake itself considering the syrup is already super sweet so I would halve the sugar for the cake batter and I had to do the same for the whipped topping.
It is fun to add other things to the syrup though like coconut milk or khalua for different flavors.

The flavour of this cake was good. It was a little too sweet for me, so I would cut the sugar in the cake to 3/4 cup next time (bearing 8n mind that there is a ton of sugar in the sweetened condensed milk). I find many people like things sweeter than I do so it may be fine for others.  The texture was good, although I took the advice of other reviewers and whipped the egg whites before adding to the batter.

My major complaint about this cake is that the batter is very thick, and spreading it across a 9x13 pan was a challenge. I did my best, but still wound up with an uneven cake, which did not fill the whole pan or soak up the milks evenly. I think the solution is a smaller pan (a 9x9 square, maybe) and longer baking time.  

To serve this, I wound up scooping it like trifle into cups and dolloping whipped cream on top. It was too uneven to serve as it was. It was actually quite a lovely presentation, but definitely not the birthday cake I was hoping for!

The best Tres Leches cake recipe I have used! Make sure you aren’t using jumbo eggs and you will be ok, that’s the only thing you really need to watch out for. Otherwise your cake will taste very eggy. This is one of my family’s dessert staples for any special occasion!

This was a win! This was my first attempt at Tres Leches, and it went well! I DID separate the egg white/yolks, whipped the yolks/sugar and whites/sugar and mixed the two with the dry ingredients- and I think it really helped define the cake texture and stability. For the whipped cream frosting, I added some of cinnamon (about 1 tbsp) for added flavor and to break up the overly sweetness of the milk. Overall- this is an approved recipe by not only my husband, but my co-workers!

Made this recipe as directed and the cake came out very dense did not absorb the milk mixture at all. The whipping cream topping came out great.

Great recipe and easy to make. I added a pinch of salt since I used unsalted butter.  I also used coconut milk, cream of coconut and almond milk. For the topping I used “Rich’s Bettercream” because is non dairy. Safe for lactose intolerant people.

So. I cheated a little bit as I was in a time crunch and used a box cake but it still came out phenomenally. I had about half of the “tres leches” concoction left over so to save yourself some cleanup use half of the recipe. So delicious, moist and a hit for my whole family.

Made this for the first time for my husbands birthday. He was very impressed to say the least. Made a few tweaks based on some of the reviews. Substituted half and half for whole milk and added half a tsp of baking soda to cake mix. I also halved the amount of sugar for whipped cream topping. As a final touch, I added cinnamon. Instead of poking holes with a fork, I used the tip of a round wooden stick which is about 1/2 centermiter thick and then poked some holes with the fork. This cake turned out amazing!

This is the best Tres Leches recipe I've found.  I've tried other recipes that begin with a boxed mix, but you can always taste that in the end result.  I followed the cake part of this recipe exactly, and my cake wasn't flat - I recommend really beating the batter thoroughly after each egg and then a minute more once everything's added.  I used Cool Whip on top as others suggested, and I used 2% milk in place of the whole milk/cream.  After a few hours in the refrigerator, all of the milks had soaked in, so I poured more 2% milk over the top (maybe an extra cup).  It all soaked in by morning, and the cake was not soggy at all - it cut nicely into clean pieces without being runny.  Such a solid recipe!

cake was tough..and dense...maybe it was my flour...all purpose...or maybe I beat it too much. There was a lot of milk leftover as well which did not absorb.

I’ve never made Tres Leches cake before, so I wasn’t sure how it was supposed to turn out. The flavors are good, but the cake is more the consistency of a wet pound cake. Maybe a different method would make the cake fluffier. Overall, not a bad first attempt!

Love love love this recipe. My 4 girls (ages 2 4 5 and 7) also love to help! Ive made this a few times exactly as stated but today I substituted the 2 cups whole milk for 2 cups black strong brewed cold columbian coffee, topped with whipping cream and sprinkled with cocoa powder. YUMMMM!!! Such an wasy “cheater version” of tarimisu (I probably spelled that wrong). Can NOT go wrong here. Love it!!!!

This is a simple but delicious recipe for Tres Leches cake. We just cut the sugar for both the cake and topping in half, as we found it to be too sweet with the amount of sugar that the recipe calls for. We also mixed the cinnamon with powdered sugar to dust over the top of the cake.

It was very tasty but very wet on the bottom, I would cut the milks by 1/3.

After writing my review of this recipe, I went back to read through a number of the reviews of the recipe done by others and I want to respond to some of those things that have been said and make a few more comments.

First off--I should say that when baking and some cooking--I have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer and I have found that surely for baking----having a mixer unit of this type or made by other companies---is absolutely a must have.

Back in just about every "industrial kitchen" whether a large restaurant, the military or catering services---we had the real deal mixers----big floor model Hobart mixers.  

When it comes to this recipe--I did not separate the egg yolks from the egg whites--I really don't see the need for that--I had whipped my eggs first together using a hand whisk and I did use heavy cream to make my own fresh whipped topping--something I have been doing for a number of years now.  I have not used products like Cool Whip for a long time now because they really are not much that are "real" and mostly chemicals.  

The only preprepared whipping cream I use are the canned ones, they are more "real" than are the ones like Cool Whip.

As to the sugar content of this recipe--it is pretty high and in future runs of the recipe--I think I will both tone it down in the amount of sugar I use and perhaps even the nature of what I use as a sweetner. 

This recipe though--is a good one to tweek to your own tastes and such--and the suggustions that you can add many othe

I've made this a few times now and its always a big hit. I usually add fruit (strawberries & blueberries or pineapple & coconut).  The hardest part of this cake is getting the batter even so that the baked cake isn't lopsided. I would suggest serving with coffee, hot tea, or milk as it is a very rich cake.

The ratio of sugar to whipping cream for the whip cream is totally off. It says one cup of sugar which is way to sweet. You should use 1 to 2 Tablespoons of sugar. Putting too much sugar ruined my cake. This needs to be re-written.

the cake recipe is wrong (tooo many eggs) and was not soft enough and the milk would not be  absorbed. First time an "all receipe'dish let me down.

This cake is as good or better than I've had in Mexico, Panama or Costa Rica!  I followed the advice of an older comment that advised to put in a 9x13 pan and pierce cake with lots of holes.  Also followed advice of using cool whip on top, which helped cut down sweetness and calories.

I made it for Thanksgiving last year - everyone in my extended family raved about it.  Getting ready to make it again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I honestly don't know if I did something wrong, but the cake seemed very thin for the amount of milk that I made. It literally covered my entire cake and I was so worried about it turning into mush that I poured some milk out. I think next time I will only make half of the milk, or double the cake recipe and use it with the milk.

I love this recipe, I've made it numerous times.  I've changed the ingredients that you pour over the cake, I use coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and condensed milk.  I also use 50% less sugar when making the whipped cream for on top of it.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Very delicious! This was my first time ever making a home made cake and a once tres leches is my favorite why not I also did most by hand such at all the beating, etc. The whipped topping was really yummy I had trouble making it more thick so it came out a little runny. Also the milk was a bit much my cake came out super moist and really milky I had to dump some out of the cake pan because it looked flooded and wouldn't soak in anymore. For my first cake I'd say  it was super delicious and love it with cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe!

Way to make and very good. We added a little cream cheese to the whipped cream to make it a bit heavier and used confection sugar instead of regular sugar.  Will make this again.

I made the cake exactly as the recipe calls for but used a can of Lopez coco cream in place of the sweetened condensed milk and half and half in place of everything else. The cake absorbed it well and was delicious. For the top I whipped heavy whipping cream with sugar and topped it off with flaked coconut and a sliced strawberry. OMG!!

I have never been a fan of tres leches but my wife loves it so this was for her.  This recipe made me a fan as well.  Don't be too concerned about using the entire milk mixture to pour into the cake as it does take some time to soak in and will likely look like it is too much.

This cake is delicious and a hit! I only gave it a four because at exactly 45 minutes it was a little overdone. I’ll check it at 40 minutes next time. Also, as another reviewer said using the leftover milk mixture to make French toast is to die for!

This cake is delicious! Made this to take to a dinner with friends and everyone loved it! I followed suggestions made to replace the whole milk with half and half and used cake flour instead of all purpose flour. I also used my own whipped cream recipe which only uses 2 TBSP of sugar per cup of whipping cream.

My granddaughter has asked me to make this cake for her. We made it together and it turned out perfect. We did use less sugar in the frosting. Everyone loved it! We will make it again.

This was amazing!  I didn't think all that milk could possibly absorb into the cake but it did.  It was sweet and perfect.  We did this as a birthday cake because my boys don't like traditional cake.

The instructions have you put the entire egg in and with five eggs to boot.  That's a lot of egg for one cake. The cake tasted unbearably eggy.  The hero in this cake should be the milk but all I could taste was the egg.  Separate the egg whites and ditch the yolks if you choose to give this recipe a shot.

It turned out really yummy! I would give it at least 4 hours, ideally more in the refrigerator before serving because the milk seeps more into the cake the longer you wait.

Great cake. Made it exactly as the recipe states. The only thing i did differently was the whipped cream. I wanted to pipe it and have stability so I added an envelope of gelatin dissolved in water and changed the regular sugar for powered sugar.

Wayyyyyyyyyyy too much milk,  not enough cake. Did not turn out at all, filing this recipe under "G" for garbage, which is unfortunately where the cake went too... I wish I could have my time and ingredients back.

I followed the recipe exact, i don't know how it has so many stars, the cake was very dry and didnt absorb all or even a quarter of the milk. My cake was floating on top of the milk.  I was very disappointed and embarrassed to show my friends

This recipe was not as good as others I have used for this cake.  The lack of whipped egg white seemed to be the main problem.  It did not soak up all of the liquid and some had to be poured off.  I will not use this recipe again.

I wasn't very confident making this, the thought of an overly soggy cake worried me,  but my worries were put to rest after the cake was devoured by myself and my family. Leftovers held up well in the fridge as well; no need to buy a tres leches cake ever again!

This was not a good recipe. My cake turned out extremely thin and dense. The recipe should say to separate the eggs. I have to bring this into my Spanish class for a party but I feel embarrassed to bring this in.

My family loved this cake! We’ve been getting Tres Leches Cakes from MX bakeries for years. This turned out just how we like them - not too too sweet. I separated the eggs before beating. This version is a keeper.

This is one of the best tres leches recipes that I’ve come across! The cake is dense enough to handle all of the liquid that’s being absorbed, it never becomes mush. This is always my go to recipe when I want to bring dessert to a party or bbq. Highly recommend this recipe!

After tasting this in Spanish class I found the recipe here and decided I HAD to make it. It turned out okay, but not as well as I thought given the number of reviews it has. I forgot the pierce the cake before adding the milk mixture on top, so it just kind of sat there  for a while. Honestly it kind of just tasted like sweet, soggy bread; however the whipped cream made it taste better. I liked it, but not enough to make it a favorite or anything. Will try Pioneer Woman's version next time.

This was so easy to make and it was delicious. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and did not add any sugar to the whipping cream as there was enough sweetness in the cake. I made it for my kids after school snack. It hit the spot on a cold winter day.

I made this twice and yesterday it was requested for a birthday. I added fresh strawberries. I call it the all day cake bit now I make the night before and the the milk soak over night then whip up the cream in the morning. I also decrease the sugar to 3/4 for the whipped topping. It's really good. Saved as a favorite.

This cake is amazing. My husband says this is the best version of tres leches he's very had, and his grew up with his Mexican sisters making it for him. Also, they all say this is better than the bakery tres leche they've had.

This cake was amazing!!!  It was the first time I made a Tres Leches cake.  Really wasn't too difficult.  I did separate the eggs, adding the whipped whites to the batter before adding the flour mixture, and used Half and Half instead of the milk, but those were the only changes I made.  Made it 2 days ahead of time, making sure to refrigerate until it was time to eat.  Made the topping the day I was going to serve it.  Sprinkled cinnamon lightly over the whipped topping, then topped each slice with a mint leaf, blackberry, raspberry, and blueberry.  It was so look delicious I actually had another half piece, something I never do.  Eating the mint leaf at the end was a refreshing touch.  Great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and it's always been a hit. I really make sure to beat the sugar and butter well and add the eggs one at a time. Also try to use Mexican vanilla if possible. I don't bother with sifting or gradually adding the flour mixture but try to mix it till just incorporated to keep everything fluffy.

I made this cake gluten free and it was fabulous.  At first, I thought it was a lot of liquid for 1 cake, but I was wrong.  It was the perfect amount.  I will certainly make this again with all purpose flour next time.

I made this cake, changed some things, and ended up with a near disaster. I followed all the steps as written. I used a 1/2 C of sugar in the batter instead of the 1 cup listed. I used a 9x13 glass baking dish. My batter was very thick. Baked for recommended time. Let the cake cool. Mixed 2 C of 1/2 and 1/2, 1 can each of sweet condensed milk and evaporated milk. Poked lots of holes in the cake while warm. Let cake cool. Poured on the mixture and put it in the fridge overnight. Removed it the next morning and my cake was floating. I am thinking that is not how it was supposed to go? I used cool-whip for the topping. The cake tasted good and when served with the milk that would not soak in it was fine. Should I try this again I will decrease the temperature of my oven by 25 degrees and make sure my holes go through all the way to the bottom of the cake...

Possibly the worst cake I've ever made!  It is so soggy. I would not make it again and would encourage others to NOT make this!

I tried making it for the first time, and it was great! The only two things were that the topping did not come out anywhere close to the  texture of the topping in the video, and the cake didn't really absorb the milk mixture that much. Otherwise, it was awesome!

Make sure you cream the butter thoroughly until it is fluffy and not just until the sugar in incorporated! Adding in the flour at the very last step ensures a tender cake because if you mix it too much gluten will form from the proteins in the flour and will end up in a dense and chewy cake.

I added in the milk mixture after the cake completely cooled, covered it and refrigerate it overnight (6-8h) to make sure the cake had time to soak in the milk mix completely along with letting it dry a bit so it won't be completely soggy at the bottom.

In the morning I whipped up 2 cups of heavy cream with 3 tbsp of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, spread 2/3rds onto the cake, put 1/3rd of it into a piping bag with a large open star tip and piped dollops on each serving portion for the berries to sit on.

I adjusted the recipe to have only 1/2 cup of sugar as the condensed milk already adds to the sweetness along with the whipped cream, but honestly you could cut it down to 1/4th as well. I garnished with strawberries and blueberries although you can do whatever you like (peaches, kiwi, blackberries, raspberries, etc etc) and melted some peach preserves in the microwave and brushed it over the fruit to make it glossy for a more professional finish.  This is a perfect cake for the spring and summer.

The version I made isn't sickenly sweet like American Store-bought cakes but more towards asian bakery cakes, but still a tad bit sweeter because of the condensed milk. This will satisf

I followed the recipe as instructed and it wasn't exactly a disaster but it was definitely not anything like the tres leche cake I have enjoyed in Mexican restaurants. The cake was dense and the milk never fully absorbed into the cake. I found another recipe with almost the same ingredients but it called for eggs to be divided (beat yolks with sugar, add dry ingredients, then gently fold in beaten egg whites) and was MUCH happier with the result. This is a good recipe if you want a sweet mess but not the right one if you want a spongy delight.

I LOVE this cake so much and so does friends and family! There is not one person that have nothing to say other than how delicious it is. I make it at least twice for the holidays. Even during summer for get togethers. As a kid my aunt used to make it but in fact was way more complicated,  this one recipe is the easiest, quick and absolutely perfect!

As others have mention , you do normally make tres leches by dividing the yoke from the whites  and there is a folding together (not just mixing) of the moist mixture with the dry mixture. I have made it that way many times before and it is a little more time consuming and if not done right can come out lumpy however, I was  concerned that this recipe wouldn’t be as good. But it is just as good if not better!! It isn’t a keeper and MUCH easier! ???? ??  Thumbs up for a time saver! It was a hit.  The only thing I did different was I didn’t add as much sugar to the whipped cream on top. But that’s just a matter of preference. I lived in a Latin American country for 15 years. Some even make a sugary meringue like topping but I prefer real whipped cream with just a bit of sugar.

I made this recipe for my first go with separating the egg whites and folding them in at the end.  The result was a think batter that needed to be spread in the 9 x 13 dish.  

After it came out of the oven, I was skeptical as the product was very lackluster.  It was very dense and didn't rise very much.  None the less, I poked many holes in it with a larger serving fork and let it cool before I added the milk mixture.  The whole dish was then put in the fridge over night.

The next day the cake did not soak up much of the liquid.  I was disappointed and the cake was dry.  So in an effort to save it, I cut it up into squares while still in the dish, while still in the liquid, put it back into the oven at 300F for 30 minutes.

Voila!  It was saved!  It has soaked up A LOT of the liquid and puffed up to look half decent.  I am currently having it cool down to the point where I can put it in the fridge and hopefully by tonight whip up some cream to serve!

UPDATE:  still didn't soak up enough of the liquid.  I think there is a component missing in the recipe.  There isn't enough liquid for the batter.  Many Tres Leches recipes call for some kind of liquid i.e. 1 cup of milk into the cake batter mixed in prior to baking.  Alas, this ended up being a dry brick in the middle....dense, and not very enjoyable.

Made this and while easy and tasty It was excessively wet. I felt that the amount of fluid specified was too much for the baked cake. Other than that, it is easy to make. If I choose to make it again I would modify the amount of fluid milk.

I did tray this recipe after searching and trying some of them and I loved this one,
-  I did hit the milk little bit and set to get cool and also I pure the milk wile the cake was warm .
-  For best result chill over night .
Tips:

If the cake level / surface not flat (you can turn the cake upset down) before making the holes and purring the milk.

I prepared this recipe pretty much as is. I must point out that the eggs amount is fine.  I followed a few of the suggestions related to the mixing procedure. The cake came out a bit dense but very good.  I do however have an advice : Try to poke as many wholes as you can so the cake soaks up milk mixture evenly and not partially. The cake might look soaked but you might discover some dry spots inside once you slice it. Follow this recommendation especially if you use a round mold instead of a rectangular one.  A key thing to keep in mind here are to master how to make a good light spongy light cake without resorting to make a meringue. This could be a bit more difficult especially for the novice baker. Practice and get to know the recipe. The other key thing is making a good milk mixture. It makes a big difference.The suggestion of replacing a bit of the whole milk for heavy cream is excellent. It added texture and enhanced the milk mixture. I would recommend to add a pinch of nutmeg to it. I did not do it because I wanted to stick to the recipe as written as much as i could. You will  get a one of a kind flavor boost with the nutmeg still without altering drastically the essence of the recipe. I will make it again! .

The easiest way to make it but not the best.  The cake wasn't dense enough to hold up after the milk was poured over it and it crumbled into mush.  The kids still liked it but I'll keep looking.

Loved it but would probably reduce the amount of milk I poured over it by a little bit as it was very wet. Everyone I served it to seemed to enjoy it! Served it with mixed berries over top.

Made this for Cinco de Mayo and it was wonderful.  My only changes were salted butter and 1/2 n 1/2 instrad of whole milk. My company was very impressed.  Will make this again.

Next time, I will use a different white cake recipe for the batter as this one did not rise much and was very thin when it came out of the oven. That said, it still tasted amazing!

I usually make this cake using a boxed cake mix but decided I would try to make it the traditional way. I followed the directions exactly, except for omitting some sugar from the whipped topping. My cake came out very eggy tasting. Even while it was baking, my whole kitchen smelled like scrambled eggs. Not sure why. Maybe separating the eggs like some suggested would be a good idea. I let the cake sit for a full 24 hours before icing it thinking that would help, but still has a strong egg flavor.

So yummy! Made this for a Cinco de Mayo party, and it was a hit. It is a rich cake, but Strawberries on the side helped balance out the sweetness. I was at first worried that the cake wasn't thick enough, but with the whipped cream topping it turned out great. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 because I didn't have whole milk, worked fine.

This cake was really good! Some changes I made were I only used three eggs and not all the butter. I also cut back on the flour and the amount of milk. Tip: Don't use all the milk because your cake will turn out very soggy.

While the flavor was great, there were some sketchy parts to the directions like, how much of the milk mixture do I use and do I take the cake out of the pan or leave it in, before pouring over the milk? Turns out, I used less than half of the milk mixture on TWO 8x8 cakes (any more and they will be mush) and I set the cake on a raised cooling rack over a larger pan, and poured the milk over it. A pint of heavy cream made enough to frost 3 cakes. I think it's a 5 star recipe for flavor but 3.5 - 4 for clarity of directions.

I loved this cake. I added Carmel drizzle to the top. One thing that I didn't like about this cake was it was really sweet. Next time for the frosting I'll add 1/2 cup sugar instead. But other then that it was delicious

It worked for me just the way it is instructed. Tried separating the yolks from the white and that turn out not to be a good idea. It is excellent just the way the recipe is written. I did have a bit too much milk mixture left over.

This was delicious.  I made the cake exactly as the recipe was written, and I let the cake sit overnight before whipping the cream for the topping.  The only change was in the topping, since I don't like to use granulated sugar in whipped cream -- I used just under 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar along with some vanilla.  Will definitely make this again!

I like this recipe because it was fairly simple to make and straightforward.  The cake turned out a bit denser than I would have liked and it was very thin. The flavor was good although a bit too eggy for my taste. My husband and father loved it!

I followed exactly what's written here, and got the milk cake I was salivating for. I had a hard time whipping the cream though, I should have bought the readily made whipped cream which is much cheaper.

Loved this cake, the only change I made was to cut the sugar in half for the whip topping.  Very, very good! Definitely let is sit overnight.  It tasted just as good the 2nd and 3rd day.

We made this tonight for dessert and were blown away with how good it tasted. We didnt have the heavy cream or whipped topping and it was still great. I think the whipped topping will add the extra kick to it. The cake alone was terrific.. will use it with other recipes.

This is a hell of a cake. Endorphins for days. Make sure you spread the cake batter as evenly as you can as it is more effort to get all the milk to soak in if the cake has a peak.  I followed another users advice and beat the whites till stiff before mixing and the result is like sex in a basket. I hadn't even heard of this cake till I came across this recipe yesterday. Thankyou Stephanie!

Thanks Stephanie!!
This cake was outstanding. I could not be more pleased.   My Granddaughter ask for this cake on her 16th birthday, and I had never made this one before. So I was a little nervous about the outcome.
The only change I made was using  half&half for the whole milk. It was enjoyed by all !

Guatemalan friends have served  tres leches cake several times at parties and I fell in love with it ( as in, "where has this cake been all my life?!") Made it this weekend for my family and this recipe is the real deal. Fun and easy to make. I took advice to let it sit for a day, and reduced sugar in frosting by half.  I dusted with cinnamon sugar, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. This might be my new signature dessert for potlucks. Great recipe!

Loved this cake but it was waaaay too sweet with too much milk!  I followed the batter portion to a tee and it turned out well.  The same with the 3 milk portion, although I could see it was going to be a lot of liquid, i proceeded since it was my first time.  I bought a carton of heavy cream that had 2 cups and decided to go with that as opposed to the 1 1/2 cups that was required.  I ran out of sugar so only ended up using 3/4 cup.  This was way too sweet, even with the additional cream.  I mean I like sweet stuff, but this went too far!  People said the liked it but no one went for seconds and the host packed it up and made sure I took the leftovers home with me.  Overall I would make it again but  cut the whole milk portion down to 1 cup and cut the sugar in the heavy cream down to 1/4 cup.  I would also add some type of liquor, frangellico, kahlua or amaretto to the milk mix just for fun!

This cake tastes great. I didn't make any changes but I will the next time. I would use a smaller pan - 8x8 and also use 1/2 cup less whole milk. Might also add some cardamom to the cake and possibly dissolve some saffron into the milk for some added flavor.  My son will devour it as is though.

It turned out a lil bit too wet for me. Also, I would suggest cutting the sugar in half at LEAST, because it was way too sweet. Maybe also use unsweetened condensed milk? It's just sugar on top of sugar on top of sugar. Also, maybe use a Greek yogurt based frosting. Yogurt + whipping cream should do. Choose very tart fruit to put on top to balance out all the sweetness.

Could not get all the liquid to soak in, poured almost a cup off and the next day there was a lot of liquid in the pan.  Too wet for my liking.

This cake was perfection!! I made this cake for my dads birthday and he loved it but was a bit sweet. Really good but I would add less sugar to it just so it's not to sweet . I would do the same to the milk . But overall it's amazing and I would totally make one again!!

This cake was a hit, but I did make some changes.  First, I added 1/2 tsp baking soda to the flour mixture.  I also used coconut cream (not milk, but the cream that I use to make pina colada's) instead of the whole milk in the recipe.  I also heated the 3 milks on the stovetop until they were all blended together nicely.  Waited 5 minutes after pulling the finished cake out of the oven to poke holes (used a candy thermometer to poke the holes into the cake).  Once the holes were poked, I poured the milks over the cake and p laced back  in the over for 5 minutes (oven was turned off at this point, but was still warm).  The cake has a great flavor - especially after sitting for 2 days in the fridge.  Definitely a keeper!

It was wonderful. But I used only about 2 tablespoons of sugar for the whipped cream. The 1 cup sugar for the whipped cream must be a mistake a needs to be changed.
Yes I will make it again. I have added it to my repertoire.

I've never whipped cream before,  so that part turned out more liquid than cream, but it was still delicious and a perfect texture,and I had several coworkers arguing over who gets the leftovers lol Made it again and got the cream to whip this time, and it was even better. Great recipe!

My first time making a Tres Leches cake, & I was so PLEASED with the results! I made it at my hubby's request for his birthday, and he was very impressed. As far as I'm concerned, this recipe is perfect! I added 2T more flour for high altitude & it worked great. I made it the day ahead so it had plenty of time to chill in the fridge.

Cake was amazing!!! Heavy whipping cream frosting was way to sweet, I would suggest using plain old whip cream instead. The cake baked supper fast so I would suggest using a lower baking time than what the recipe calls for. I had to take out some of the milk mixture because the cake couldn't absorb so much. Over all, my Mexican family and I really enjoyed it.

I made this exactly as written, and it's absolutely terrible. I might try again with some of the revisions others made below. I tend to like to try a recipe as written first, before I change it. But this one is just not good. Okay I'm going to update this a bit. I realized this takes a longgggg time to soak up the milk. I guess I should've poked more holes in it. Also, I think that was too much milk in the recipe. I would make it again, but definitely cut back on the amount of milk, and the amount of sugar in the frosting. Otherwise, it wasn't bad, after it fully soaked everything up.

Made this last night. Turned out really nice. Only change i made is instead of whole milk i used coconut milk. I sliced the cake in squares so that all of the milk could soak in and left it in the fridge overnight. Enjoy!

Turned out great. Followed the directions exactly but added 1/4 tsp. Baking Soda and a little Kahlua to the milk mixture. 
Refrigerating as long as possible is the key. You can make cake day before and let it absorb the milk all night. Would recommend this to everyone!

I will make it again! This is the best recipe for Tres Leches cake.
When I baked it, it looked so dense, well , with the mixed milks added to the poked cake, it  becomes perfect! It is SO DELICIOUS!!! I didn't change anything in this recipe!

This wasn't as much work as I thought.  I didn't particularly care for it because I felt it was so fattening, but my children at it all up, which actually is unusual.  I am unlikely to make it again unless asked, because not something I would eat on my own.

I took heed of other reviewers and added the egg yolks and whipped whites separately. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for extra rise. I used half and half in place of the whole milk for a richwr taste. I used two cups of heavy whipping cream with 1/2 cup sugar and it was still too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup for the whipped cream portion. Still a great recipe.

This recipe was the closest to a recipe that I used to use which is why I tried it. The only thing that I changed was that I separated the eggs and whipped the whites. I added the yolks when the recipe  called for the eggs beat that together and then added the whipped whites. Followed the rest of directions. It came out wonderful. Lots of compliments. I will be making this again this time sticking to the recipe. Eager to see if the volume will be the same.  ENJOY!

The cake was very delicious. I made it twice, the first time I made it, I used a metal 9x13 pan and real butter. The cake soaked up all the milk ( like all of it). It was not as moist as the second time I made it using a pyrex glass dish and countrycrock  light ( the cake did not soak up much of the liquid. However, it seemed like the condensed milk was a little  overwhelming, very sweet for my taste. I would definitely reduce the recipe to 2 1/2 cup of milk. 3/4 cup of condensed milk and 3/4 cup of evaporated milk. I followed some of the suggestion and beat the egg separately and beat the butter for a while and then add the sugar and beat again. I replaced the cream with reddi wip can cream.

Made as described in original recipe except I substituted coconut cream for the regular milk and I didn't add cream topping. Came out sweet, very moist (all the milks were absorbed) and absolutely delicious. Everyone who tried it raved about it!

I am crazy for this recipe! I have made it at least 6 times. Friends and family request it for their birthday. I often make two rounds and stack them like a birthday cake with a whipped layer between and believe it or not, it stays together perfectly! I ice the sides as well. I have always done the milk soak overnight. A perfect recipe!

Very easy to make . Only thing i would change next time is add only half of the condensed sweet milk. It was a bit too sweet for my liking.

I halved the recipe and just watched for the cake to be done a little earlier since it was smaller.  Delicious... rich but feels light.

A great great recipe! 
My husband, who is Peruvian, loved it even better than the cakes in his homeland.
I just reduced a total of 0.5 cup of sugar (because my family doesn't like it too sweet).
The liquid was a bit too much (not all of it was absorbed in the cake) so the next time I will add only 1.5 cups of whole milk (instead of 2 cups) and then it would be PERFECT!!!

I used a boxed white cake mix for simplicity, but I can say that the blend of milks for the cake to absorb along with the cream topping was perfect.  I am not a big fan of cake, but this was surely a tasty treat for my family and I definitely will make it again.

I made this for myself and for work, and both times, they came out great! I love this with sprinkled cinnamon (can do some cool patterns to if it's done right) and fresh strawberries, blueberries and peaches. I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about making it!

I loved it! I made some changes however. I added 1 teaspoon of really good vanilla to the batter, instead of 1/2 a teaspoon, this helps with the eggy flavor. I added 2 cans of evaporated milk instead of one to the milk mixture. I also deceased the sugar  from 1 cup to 1/2 a cup in the whipped cream.  It is a super moist, delicious cake. Your ingredients matter. Just try it!

I have made this recipe many times now (it's my boyfriend's absolute favorite). It is not too heavy, not to light, and has a perfect balance of sweetness. The cake itself is a little dense, but that is okay because the milk will lighten it up. Don't be afraid of adding all the milk. It will all absorb! I've seen comments on it being very eggy, but that is fine because it allows for the right texture, and it also does not taste eggy once the milk has been absorbed.

The few notes I have are: 
I use half and half rather than milk to get the right thickness of the milk mixture.
Beating the egg whites beforehand seem to have no effect on the final product.
Let the cake cool before stabbing it full of holes with a fork. 
Let the cake sit in the milk mixture for 24 hours before icing.
You can use pre-made whipped topping if you would like to.

I used 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in the heavy whipped cream topping instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, because that is the way I like it.  Took this cake to work and it got thumbs up.  Not too sweet.  I just wish I'd put some sliced up strawberries on top.  That would have made it.

Ibe made this twice now. My stars rating is for this recipe exactly as it stands. I covered the top the second time round with warm dulce De leche instead of whipped cream. It adds a nice, richer element but whipped cream works well too. I make it a little differently. Seperate the eggs, beat the whites to a soft peak first with a bit of salt. Then add the sugar and beat til firm peaks. Then add the yolks (beaten with a fork beforehand) slowly under the beaters on low speed. 

Then, very gently fold in the other dry ingredients. That's how I was taught to make thie this cake and the way I prefer best. But, as I said - fantastic milk mixture - I've seen recipes that use all kinds of odd combos and this recipe is the best to soak the cake without it turning into a sloppy mess. 

Overall, a fantastic dessert to serve if you want something sweet, light and simple.

The sponge cake turned out much to dense and bland. The whipped cream was way too sweet. Followed recipe exactly and had to throw out the entire cake as no one could eat it.
UPDATE: After this attempt I was on a mission to find a good, authentic tres leches cake recipe. I live in Arizona and this is my favorite cake. There are many authentic Mexican food restaurants in my area that serve this cake so the bar was set high for finding a recipe that could measure up. I was able to find another recipe o this site for this cake and the difference was remarkable! Comparatively, this recipe calls for copious amounts of sugar, 1 cup for whipping cream is beyond too much. The other recipe I tried called for 1/4 cup and it was perfect at the lower amount. This recipe also calls for 2 cups of milk for the 3 milk mixture, this is way too much. Other recipes call for 1/3 to 1/2 cup of milk and this is the amount you need to not dilute the flavor of the condensed milk. Perhaps the biggest misstep of this recipe is not separating the eggs. Separating and beating the eggs really makes all the difference! Otherwise the sponge is too dense and the texture is completely off.  I decided to update my review after I tried the other recipe for this cake and it turned out so much better. Hopefully the tips in this review help guide those of you wanting to make an authentic tres leches cake.

I made this cake on Saturday and took it to a party on Sunday.  It was well received and delicious!  However, I had some leftover on Monday and it was even better, if possible,  than the day before.  But in the making I did have to pour off maybe one and a half cups of unabsorbed milk.   Will definitely make this again!!

I followed the recipe to a T and the cake turned out pretty good. However, the frosting was way too sweet. The cake itself is already sweet so the frosting shouldn't overpower the taste of the cake. Try to limit the sugar in the frosting by reducing the 1 cup of sugar to 2-3 tablespoon of sugar. It should be semi-sweet, only then will the cake be a five star cake.

I've made this a couple of times now, exactly as written, and it is delicious. It's requested whenever there's a birthday party.  I have never bothered to separate the eggs as I have seen in other reviews, and so perhaps it's not truly 'authentic,' but no matter, it is outstanding!

I made this with all the same ingredients and everything. The only thing I did that wasn't specified in the instructions was separate and beat the egg whites. I'm not sure if it made much of a difference. The recipe is good, but the milk sauce that you make is almost not thick enough in my opinion. Maybe more sweetened condensed milk, or less whole milk? Not sure what would make it work better.

I did not make any changes.  This cake was a big hit, even among people who think Taco Bell is a good example of ethnic food.  I felt the whipped cream was a little too sweet.  If I made it again, I would probably halve the sugar.

This cake has become the cake everyone asks me to make over and over, you could say I am now known for this cake. The dense cake holds the milks perfectly without making it soggy. The priest at church at our Spanish Catholic mass raved about it and the parishioners kept asking me how I learned to make this cake seeing that it is so juicy with the 3 milks and reminds them of the ones their grandmothers made in Mexico.

I made this and it was good except the whipped cream topping was way too sweet for my taste.  If I make it again, I will cut the amount of sugar in half.

I made this for the first time today and it was great! I took the hint from another reviewer and used white cake mix as my base.  Kept everything else the same.  Took at least 5 mins to get the cream to thicken (rookie) and also realized too late that once the milk is added you can't move the cake to another dish.  Oh well, it tastes great - even without the final topping

A bit soupy for my liking. The flavors are great though. After a day in the fridge I simply had so much liquid in the bottom of the pan making the cake very soggy at the bottom.

I have made this two time and cut down sugar each time.  I use 3/4 c with the cake mix and just 1/2 c with the heavy cream when whipped.  I have had rave reviews from anyone who has tried this before.  Such as "the best I ever had" and "better than the restaurants cake ".  One girl said her various family members make this for every holiday and mine was the best of all.

I kind of regret making this because now the family won't let me make any other kind of cake. I swear I get invited to my husband's x-wife's house (and they are all Mexican) every birthday because of your recipe. Lol!  Thanks, no thanks for sharing this recipe!

The cake was not very thick as if there was not enough batter for the pan. I am not sure what I did wrong but I had way too much milk for the cake in the pan.

DO NOT add sugar to the whipped cream! Maybe a tad, but certainly not a whole cup! The sweetness of the cake balances the pure, barely sweetened creamy topping perfectly.

Delicious! I did modify a little bit based on some of the reviews I read with the recipe. I separated my eggs before adding to the butter/sugar and I used half heavy cream and half whole milk for the 2 cups whole milk. I also reduced the sugar in the whipped cream and used powdered sugar instead of granulated. Sprinkled the top with cinnamon. Definitely NOT a low-fat dessert, but well worth it!

This cake is so easy to eat! And easy to make. I thought it would be floating and I even had 70g less liquid than it calls for but it soaked right in, even though the cake itself was rather dense once cooked. Turned out nice and moist and very, very tasty. Was worried it would be too rich but the 2c of whole milk I think cut down on the sweetness of the evaporated and sweetened condensed. Must put cinnamon on top, it topped it right off (pun intended)!

This is delicious, highly recommended!  I reduced the sugar (in cake and topping) and condensed milk (in filling) slightly but I followed everything else as-is.  I baked mine in a 9"x13" pan.  When the cake was done, it was thinner than I expected (about a little over 1".)  It was also a very dense cake, which I was told it's typical.  However, I let it soak in the filling overnight.  The cake expanded, the texture was softened up, and there was still plenty of milk filling left for drizzle.   Will make it again for sure!

This cake is a major disappointment if you want a cake to fill a 9 by 13 pan...it turned out about 1 inch tall...not enough batter for that size pan, would probably be fine in 8 by 8 pan..making it for a birthday and have to re-do...have not finished it or tasted it..seems like a huge amount of sugar for such a small cake..traditional tres leche cakes are not that sweet...going to try Chef JOhn recipe..which are very dependable...

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake didn't absorb all the liquid even after sitting in the fridge overnight. Instead of being moist the cake is just wet. The topping tasted good but the texture was grainy from too much sugar. Next time i will reduced the soaking liquid by half, and reduce the sugar in the topping by half and add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar.

I found this very easy to make, however, I forgot to buy whipping cream so I cheated and used the Reddi Whip, tastes delicious!  I also used Almond Extract instead of vanilla.

Giving five stars for the filling part of the recipe. It was perfect!  I used a boxed cake mix to save time but found that the texture is not the same. Needs the cake to be made with all- purpose flour as the recipe says.

The recipe was a real hit, though my one suggestion would be to use a smaller pan for baking the cake then stated. My cake didn't even fill up half my pan. It tasted great!

Awesome cake. Had it before years ago in the little bodegas and was having a total craving for it. Perfect amount of liquid, you just have to wait for it to absorb. You always want a little extra milk at the bottom of the pan and plate. That's how it's supposed to be. And it doesn't taste eggy at all. The batter is supposed to be very thick, if it was too soft a cake to begin with, it would fall apart. Also the cake may look small in the pan, but it's a sponge. By the time the milk is absorbed, it will fill out.  Delicious!

This recipe sounded really delectable.  But unfortunately it wasn't our favorite.  The cake was very dense, even after soaking up most of the milk.  It did taste better on the second day but it still had about 1/2 cup of milk that never did absorb in.  I do think what others mentioned about separating the egg whites to fold into the batter would make the cake part a little better than it was.  Overall it was good but just not our favorite since it was too dense and soggy for our liking.  Im sure this may also be an aquired taste and nothing wrong with the recipe itself.  Thank you for the recipe though, it was nice to try something different.

The cake turned out great, but the frosting never thickened enough to use. If I would have put it on my cake, it would have just been another liquid poured over the top. I used dulce de leche to top it instead which was popular with my family.

Good, not a fan of the extra liquid on the bottom of the dish. If I made it again I would use less liquid.

It was half an inch thick, and would not absorb the milk mixture. I followed the recipe strep-by-step.

I am going to make this again for family that is coming  from out of town but I will use cake flour instead and seperate the eggs and beeat the whites. The cake is very good this way, but very dense and thick. I think with the cake flour it will make it more lite and fluffy.

Followed this recipe to the "T" and it turned out horrible. The cake just did not absorb the liquid and turned out like mush-I choose to  let it set-up for maybe 4-5 hrs instead of overnight.....maybe that was my mistake! As a positive, the frosting turned out tasty.

K just made this 2 ways. First off, if you made this just as directed...slap yourself. I'm Mexican and I looked at this recipe as well as Spanish YouTube recipe videos (for authenticity verification purposes) and in YouTube the recipe was almost the same EXCEPT,  all the videos said to separate the eggs and beat the whites until thick then add yolks then follow recipe as normal. Difference is night and day I tell ya!!! I made both versions at the same time. The one where I beat the whites rose about 50% more not to mention so much fluffier. It even tasted way better. I had no idea it would make such a difference. I took a picture let me see if I could upload...

Love this! Perfect for a party because it was easy to make a day in advance. I used a box cake mix and then put the milk mixture on and refrigerated the cake until ready to serve. I whipped the cream with 1/4 cup of sugar and that was very sweet. I served it with brandied cherries on the side and it was a hit!

Yum!  The texture is a bit grainy, and the next day there was still quite a bit of milk that wasn't soaked up, but the flavor is great and the it's moist and yummy. I used salted butter because that's all I had and it was fine.  I also did not use 1 cup of sugar for the whipped cream topping.  I only used about two tablespoons.  Will definitely make again!

this recipe gets you a very moist and rich cake. The only thing I added was mascarpone cheese in the whipped topping. The frosting turned even better. Finally dusted with cinnamon powder.

There is way too much liquid and not enough batter to support it. The proportions need to be cut in half at least.

Instead of the icing I just use double thick cream and raspberries. I also love to put a bit of Kahlua in with the milk mix to add a bit of extra flavour :) another fun thing to do is use coconut milk instead of evaporated milk if you want to mix it up a bit :D

I also used only 1 c regular milk which was enough (I didn't want giant puddles). I added only ca 1 tbs sugar to the whipped cream. The cake was still very sweet, but my guests loved it. I found it on the dense side - would have been better to whip the egg whites as others have noted.

Made it for the first time today. I was afraid to use all the milk thinking it would be soggy, but the cake is firm and had I used it all, I think it would have stood up to it. In fact, I think when it soaks it up, the cake expands a little. But I had milk left and just poured some in the bottom of the serving dish with the cake on top. Next time I'll try some of the flavor suggestions from other posts, like pina colada or coconut. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and my only issue is that there was too much of the milk mixture.  It didn't all soak in after an hour and I had to dump out what was just sitting there.  Next time I'll go slower and not dump it all on at once.  Absolutely delicious though!

This was really yummy and it was a lot like the one I had at a local Cuban restaurant. Everyone liked it!  I followed the recipe, except used half the sugar in the whipped cream. It was still very sweet with the half a cup and a cup would have been too sweet for me. When the cake was done baking it was harder than I thought it would be and I had a difficult time getting the milks to soak in. When I poured them on top they only stayed there a minute and then ended up on the bottom of my pan with the cake floating on top!  I left it overnight but it still seemed like not much had soaked in so I tried to make my holes in the cake bigger and pushed the cake down so the milks came to the top.  Luckily, by the time we ate it later in the day, a lot of it had soaked in (or leaked out of my container, but that's a whole other story.  Be careful!). It was a pretty good consistency, though I might like it more if it sat another night and really soaked it all in. The flavor was great though!  I will make it again. Next time I may take it out of the oven a little sooner than 30 min to see if it's not as hard.

On day 1 the cake did not soak in any of the milk. The cake was floating in the 3 milk mixture...I left this cake in the fridge and sort of forgot but took it out two days later and all the milk was finally soaked in. It did taste good.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I changed was instead of pouring the milk over the cooled cake, I submerged the cool cakes in the milk. The cake turned out very moist but not to the point of falling apart.

Unfortunately I didn't realize the beater I had wasn't working so I had to forego the home made whipped topping, but store bought didn't detract from it at all! the recipe is wonderful; easy to make and tastes great! I got rave reviews. Tres Leches cake is the kind that's better after a day in the fridge...

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving two days ago. While it was fairly simple to make I felt the recipe was way too watery and I followed it closely the only thing I did differently was use cool whip topping instead of making my own. However before I even put the cool whip topping I noticed how mushy the cake was. Once I had served it although it tasted really good I was upset at how mushy it was. I will make it again but cut down the recipe a bit to make it less watery.

I made this today, it was very good BUT there was a lot of milk in the bottom of the pan.  It was not all absorbed into the cake.  Is this normal?

AMAZING!  Super easy!  My 9-year old made this!  Looked like a professional made it.
NOTES: 1) We added orange flavoring along with vanilla.  WOW!  2)  We put in fridge overnight and frosting firmed up.  Made it even more impressive!

I made this for a dinner party. A Guatemalan friend said they reminded her of home. Her suggestion for improvement was to cut off all the "crust" before soaking so that it would be absorbed better.

The recipe for the cake is not a good one, it hardly rises so you just get a very flat piece of cake.  Definitely have to divide the eggs. I did not like the recipe for the milks either.

I tried making it and some how it didn't come out fluffy like a cake. It was more of a pancake. However, I'm going to try it again to see if it was just because it was my first time.

This recipe has flavor and is overall a keeper. However, in years of Tres Leche Baking the Eggs definetly need to be seperated. Yokes mixed well with sugar then add the softened butter until combined. Beat egg whites and fold into the yoke mixture. Add flour little by little. Pour into prepared pan. I also add a little powders sugar to the milk mixture and top with cocoa powder. Family Fav!

The milk mixture is by itself veeerry sweet and the whipped cream was WAYYYYY too sweet for me.  I think the recipe is good and the milk-to-cake ratio was perfect. However, next time, I'm going to halve the condensed milk and sugar in the whipped cream.

This recipe is idiot-proof.  I mixed it using my bare hands only with a toddler crawling on my leg. The batter held up to me switching from 1/3 ratio and then just adding in another 1/3 when I realized I wanted more 
cake.  The cake came out beautifully.

Yum yum yum! Tres Leches cake is probably my favorite cake. I'm a Texas girl born and raised so I've had my fair share of Latin food. I've had this cake at restaurants and from the store and wanted to try my hand at making this myself. And it turned out AMAZING. I made a cake for home and for my husband to take to some of his coworkers and got a request for another one the next day! Delicious! Top with your favorite fruits. I love it with strawberries and pineapple. So yummy.

I really enjoyed this cake, it was a bit different because there's no milk in the cake proper before you put the sauce on, but no problem.  
I found this to be a bit sweet with so much sweetened condensed milk and will use less next time.  We also only used 2TBLS maple syrup to flavou and sweeten the cream and that was enough.  Will make again.

I didn't care for this recipe at all! Thank goodness I just made half the recipe. The milk soaked in almost immediately and I refrigerated for 4 hrs. The consistency reminds me of wet cornbread and the taste is very eggy.  I don't recommend.

This was a wonderful cake, my only complaint was that it was too sweet. BUT, I will say that's my own fault, I did not make a whipped cream frosting and instead used a Cream Cheese Frosting (also found on this website) but I think that overloaded the sugar. No matter, my family loved it anyways and it's very easy to make. I did indeed refrigerate the cake for a whole night soaking in the milk, and it was perfect. Will definitely make it again!

This cake was amazing!  I made it as written with the exception of soaking the cake overnight once I added the milk to the cake.  The only thing I did not like was the gritty-ness of the granulated sugar in the whipped cream.  Next time I will use super fine white sugar and see if that helps.
The cake was very milky but held its shape and the whipped cream rounds out the whole cake.  Simply divine - will make this again.

I've made this recipe twice for my hispanic co-workers and they rave about it.  This recipe is very authentic and super easy to make.  My only suggestions are to make sure that the butter and eggs are room tempeture, and I cut the sugar for the topping down to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  This makes the topping a little less sweet and you can taste the cake/milk more.  Very good cake...will continue to make it for special occasions, as it's been a huge success!

I was a little apprehensive about serving this "soggy" cake to my somewhat picky extended family, but it was a bit hit at our Mexican-themed Dinner and a Movie last night! I know I will be asked to make this again! With the exception of taking SERENA's advice (creaming the butter first and adding the eggs one at a time), I followed this recipe to the letter. I have had Tres Leches cake in Mexico many times, and this tasted very authentic.

Very tasty.  A little too sweet for my taste, but otherwise fantastic.  I did use Cool Whip instead of making the topping and added strawberries which helped to tone down the super sugary taste of the condensed milk.

This was a great cake. I made this for my mother-inlaws birthday party and everyone loved it. I only gave it a 4 because I used white box cake instead of the recipe because I was making a larger cake and wasn't sure how it would come out. I plan to make this again going through the whole recipe.

I love this recipe.. Very simple and delicious. Only thing I did was cut off the ends about an inch and placed in a glass dish so you can see the milk coat the entire cake.

I made two of these cakes for a Mexican luncheon we were having and they were delicious and even better, easy to make. I was amazed that the cake could absorb that much cream mixture and not be a soggy pudding. I think that one cup of sugar for the whipped cream topping was way too much. I doubled the recipe as I had two cakes to frost and used perhaps 1/4 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet enough. On the picture of this cake, what was sprinkled on the top? Frankie

I love this recipe.

What I've found gets a great reception is instead of using whole milk,  using heavy cream as one of the leches. It makes the syrup inside thicker and a delight to spoon over the cake!

MADE THIS FOR A PARTY LAST NIGHT AND I WISH YOU COULD'VE HEARD THE RAVE REVIEWS. ONE MAN SAID IT IS THE BEST DESSERT HE HAS EVER HAD. SOME OF THE LADIES SAID "YOU NAILED IT!". I NEVER HAD THIS TYPE OF CAKE BEFORE AND I WAS SO PLEASED. IT'S EASY TO MAKE AND IF YOU FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, IT COMES OUT PERFECT. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING. CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!!

The taste was good, but I had a bunch of extra milk mixture left over and the whipped cream was grainy - - should have should powdered sugar..  I'd try this recipe again but with a few changes.

Too much sugar! Next time, I'll cut the sugar in the cake by half. As for the topping, two to three tablespoonfuls of sugar is more than enough to sweeten one cup of cream. IMO, 2/3 cup sugar for the entire recipe should be PLENTY. Other than this, the recipe worked and I will do it again (Cinco de Mayo).

The taste was there but the cake was too dense. And the liquid mixture was also too much. It was good for my first try but I will be looking for a recipe with a spongier cake.

Delicioso! This was easy (especially with the video), and so, so yummy! I have never much cared for tres leches cake, but my husband loves it and wanted one for his birthday.  So I tried this recipe. I now love this cake, too. My one daughter that doesn't like any types of cakes, also loves it. It is a new household favorite!

Too much milk for the cake to absorb.  The bottom was soggy!  The top a bit dry. On the plus side it was devoured at the party I brought it too, but I was embarrassed to say I had made it.  Good taste,

Made this for a Cinco De Mayo party because it was the only dessert I could think of for my theme that wasn't flan. Since then I have been asked to make it again because these cakes can't easily be purchased anywhere. I think I will make it every year because I'm sure some of guest will be looking forward to it.

My daughter loves Tres Leches cake and wanted to make one to take to Thanksgiving dinner and found this recipe. I didn't think I would like it (soggy cake?) but let her make it anyway. Boy was I wrong!  It is so delicious and everyone has requested she make it again for Christmas.  She followed the recipe except for one minor change -- used only 1/4 cup of sugar in the whipped topping. This is NOT soggy cake -- it is heaven in every bite!  The only down side? There were no leftovers...

Very good recipe.  Since the milk mixture is quite sweet, I did not add the additional cup of sugar to the whipped cream topping. Sprinkling just a little cinnamon and sugar on top made it perfect.

I've only ever had Tres Leches at Costa Vida (Mexican restaurant) - so that's all I have to compare it to. Definitely not as good as that restaurant's cake, but I still loved this homemade one.

Everyone absolutely loves this.  I made this using a regular yellow cake with a few substitutions. Milk instead of water, butter instead of oil, and 4 eggs instead of 3.  I baked the cake according to the package instructions.  In the liquids poured over the cake, I reduced the amount of regulare milk to one cup. I also used 1% milk since it's all we had.  This cake is a huge hit.

This cake is amazing.  I made it for a Mexican-themed dinner party and everyone loved it.

This was the first tres leches cake recipe that I have tried and I bake and sell cakes on the side and the only change I made is instead of using unsalted butter I use salted butter and everyone that has eaten the cake say its the best they have ever had. Another thing I do just for fun sometime is instead of sweetened condensed milk I use la lecheras caramel and I mix it up really good then sift out the chunks of caramel it makes a good twist to the classic and everybody loves the caramel sweet flavor :)

Delicious!! I followed the recipe completely when making the cake. The first time I did use cool whip instead of the cream topping and it was good, but the second time when I made it with the whipped cream and it was even better. This cake is easy and so good!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but the milk didn't soak into the cake at all. Cake is dry and hard. I followed all the instructions to bake the cake for 30 mins at 350 degrees.  Any suggestion?

I've been using this recipe for years now and 1) It is super easy to make and  2) always gets rave reviews.

To make sure the liquid gets all soaked in I always try to leave it overnight (in the fridge) to absorb.  Then the next morning I'll put the whipped cream topping in.  Sometimes I substitute whole milk for skim or another variety if I don't have whole, and it always turns out great.  For the whipped cream I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup or else it is too sweet for my tastes.

This was so easy and the family loved it! I used a white cake mix and used dark chocolate soy milk in place of whole milk. To help the milk absorb into the cake faster, I used the handle of a wooden spoon and made a few holes in the cake and then poured the milk mixture over the cake and placed in the fridge. By the time I was ready to put the whipped topping on, all of the milk soaked into the cake.

Fantastic recipe! Just be sure to poke plenty of holes in the cake once it has cooled so that the milk mixture absorbs well.

I made this cake two weeks ago for the first time because my fifteen year old requested it for his birthday after having tasted one at a school event. Everyone at our house liked it, and I am now making one for Easter Sunday. When searching for a recipe I noticed many recipes call for separating and beating the egg whites before adding to batter, resulting in a more spongelike cake. I prefer this recipe because it's simpler to make and I like the density of the cake. Thanks for a simply satisfying yummy cake!

Overall the taste is delicious. The recipe was pretty simple and simple to follow. But I agree with a previous reviewer who said the cake tasted a little eggy and the whipped topping was too sweet. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of five. Next time I cut down on both. Just a bit to sweet for my taste but overall very good tres leches!

First time making it. I was nervous it wouldnt come out well. I used the tips with milk and using 1% instead of whole. When I poured in all the milk into the cake, it was all absorbed, no waiting and i thought it wasnt going to be enough. I did, however, poke the  out of the cake haha.
I let it set over night and just put faith in the recipe....And it was FABULOUS!
It doesnt need whip cream either.
Also must note, i was one egg short and you would never be able to tell. Will be making this for my Father in laws birthday! THANK YOU!!

I've never posted a review before, but this cake was awesome.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was absolutely lovely.  The biggest problem I have with it is that I have no idea how I'm going to avoid eating all the leftovers right this very minute.

Firstly, and that is not my baking skills - this cake is VERY sweet.  Too sweet for my taste, and I like sweet.  Secondly, not sure what exactly went wrong, but I followed the recipe and all the steps.  After all the fuss, ended up with watery, extremely sweet cake that looked nothing close to the picture.

It came out too heavy, waited 24 hours for the milks to soak up into the cake but it never happened! I guess I had too many expectations, because I recently tried a bakerymadet tres leches cake, and it was perfect; light, airy, not too sweet, very moist without being soggy... unfortunately it was everything this recipe was not.  I've tried this recipe twice, but they came out bad both times. Boo.

This was a good cake and everything turned out as it should but it tasted a bit to "eggy" for me. Next time I would do 4 eggs instead of 5.

Followed the ingredient amounts as listed but did the set up a bit differently. I poked holes in the cake immediately after baking. Used the stem of a regular dinner fork to make the holes so they were big enough to soak up the liquid. Pored the liquid over top of the hot cake, covered with foil and put in fridge overnight. next day milk was totally soaked and iced it with whip topping. Turned out great.

It wasn't awful but not "great". Very easy to make though. My husband and I had never heard someone use the term "white sugar" before but I've never used recipes before either. So I made the icing wrong the first time but then made a second batch immediately and used powdered sugar. 
The cake itself was good but too spongy for me. I didn't like the texture. 
I thought that the measurements were off a bit... the "milk" that you pour over the cake is too much. It made the cake too wet. I would have used half and been happy. 
Other than that it tasted pretty good.

Soggy...white...cake.  Sorry, I don't get it.  (Per someone's recommendation, I let the cake sit in the tres leches mixture overnight.  Maybe that was the problem?)

I absolutely loved the taste of the cake batter and the frosting, but when I added the milk my cake became way too soggy to eat.  I even waited 2 days as others had suggested, but it's still no good.  I may try this recipe again, but without the milk.

I had made this cake for my Spanish class, and I had some really good and bad comments. Someone actually went up to me and said, "That was horrible." I was so upset, because I thought it tasted good. I guess it was just a matter of taste because my teacher loved it so much she asked for the recipe. I started crying because I received so many negative comebacks. I am probably never doing this recipe again.

This was a unique cake.  When we tried it at first, we thought it was so-so, maybe beacuse we didnt know what to expect.  The next day after cooling down completely, it took on a new taste to the palate after the flavors blended together- much better and quite delicious.  The kids love it.  We'll make it again.

I separated the egg yolks from the egg whites, then beat the whites for a minute. I then added both to the butter mix  beat for 3 minutes.  I was careful to mix the dry and wet ingredients with a spoon, if you over mix it makes the cake dry. When mine came out of the oven it had a egg smell but once i added the milk and cooled it, it tasted great! I used ready whip. Everyone loved it!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. I followed the instructions exactly EXCEPT for 2 things: I did not sift the flour, used 1% milk instead of whole milk (that's what I had) and it turned out DELICIOUS. We had tres leches cake at a shower and my husband loved it so tried it at home. The only thing I would change is add maybe 1/2 the sugar in the topping OR make sure you add a lot of fruits to over shadow the sweetness otherwise the topping will be REALLY sweet. Enjoy!

Soggy. Easy to make, but really don't use that much milk. To me it tasted slightly eggy....but none of my guests notice. My husband LOVED it. But after it soaked I poured some milk out...soaked it with paper towels and even set it on a grate to drain. Didn't matter. By the time I served it, it was swimming in milk. WAY TOO SOGGY. So i'd recommend using less egg and next time I plan on only using the sweeten condensed and evaporated milk or at least halfing the milk content.

First attempt at tres leches, made it for a b'day/ father's day BBQ. Everyone really enjoyed the flavor.  I made it as directed but used half & half instead of milk & only one cup, still had plenty of liquid.  I cheated & used redi whip to cover & garnished with cherries in a shape of a heart.  Next time I will make with the whipping cream.  Thanks for sharing recipe.

I chose to not put on the icing, since I've never been a fan of icing, and it still turned out great!!! I followed just as the recipes said, except for the eggs (I used egg substitute), and it was just right!

This cake was delicious!  I used about 2/3 of the liquid and it was plenty.  I topped it with cool whip and everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

This was easy to make; i topped it with fresh fruit (mango, blueberry, strawberry, kiwi); the taste was right in terms of sweetness and the fruit was very good on it.  I guess it is the texture that I'm not crazy about. I'm not used to a soggy cake. (very wet sponge consistency). I had never made this type of cake before but had tasted one at a gathering recently. I don't remember the one I tasted to have been so soggy. It held together when cutting and eating but I definitely didn't love this and will keep looking for a different recipe or maybe try using half of the liquid.

This recipe was very easy, and was enjoyed by everybody.  My problem with it, though, is the consistency of the actual cake.  Something is just off.  I think I'll stick to Alton Brown's tres leches cake from now on.

This is a delicious recipe. 

The cake/milk portion is quite sweet in itself, so for the whipped topping, I use:

1.5 c heavy cream
1 tsp vanilla
1/4 c. brown sugar

I think it gives a better balance to the cake overall.

yum! super easy since i followed advice below to use white cake mix.  instead of whole milk, i substituted 1 can of coconut milk. cake with the milks was sweet enough so no extra sugar was needed in the whipped cream.  actually cake with milks was yummy without the whipped cream as well.

This was the first baking recipe I have ever tried.  I have always been intimidated by baking so it wasn't until my first pregnancy craving hit me last night that I felt motivated enough to give it a try.  Tres leches has long been one of my favorite desserts and I am delighted to report that this recipe is delicious!  It was simple to make, the directions were clear and easy to follow and the end result is amazing.  I can barely believe I actually made this myself.  I followed the recipe exactly, no variations.  Thank you for posting this!

The cake seemed to turn out fine...it rose well and tasted good, but there was way to much liquid.  It wasn't a moist cake, it was a sopping wet cake.  Out of six people nobody liked it.  Not sure what I did wrong or if it's just something that doesn't appeal to me and my family.

I've not tasted a tres leche cake prior to making it- but it fit with our luncheon theme and I wanted to try it but I had to make a few modifications- it smelled really eggy after it was baked, and the topping was too sweet, so I added a second batch of plain whipped cream to the topping and a teaspoon of rum extract in addition to the vanilla, and sprinkled with cinnamon and chocolate shavings- had a co-worker say it was better than her tres leche wedding cake.  It was moist without being soggy and the eggy taste wasn't apparent.  cake was refridgerated overnite.  would make again.  update: I've made this cake 4 times and each time it's come out different.  2x the milk did not soak, with the cake being dense and not rising (though i used baking soda which was successful previously), 2 other times the cake texture was different.  People liked it anyway, but frustrating for me...update: I've made this cake 4 times and each time it's come out different.  2x the milk did not soak, with the cake being dense and not rising (though i used baking soda which was successful previously), 2 other times the cake texture was different.

There was WAY too much milk in this one 8(  I also did not care for the flavour but that could be personal preference.  I have a few friends trying it and will rate again if they are different from mine.

This is really great cake and good for a group event. I skip the whip cream and bring a thawed bag of frozen (mixed) berries to spoon over each individual portion. Dee-lightful.

I found this cake at my local Kroger's store and had to have the recipe!  Everyone loves it! From the grandchildren to the grandparents - even college kids. They love it. I took this to my local hospice (where I volenteer) and it brought a smile to everyone that experienced this delight!

Very good cake. Not your "traditional" tres leches, it is less liquidy when you cut into it, but the taste is fabulous.

This cake was delicious. I've never had tres leches before I made it and two women (one from Bolivia and one from Puerto Rico) swore it was the best they have had! Be patient with the creaming of butter and sugar and add the eggs one at a time. That makes the batter much easier to work with. This was so so good and I will be posting my picture-- a great presentation. Try this recipe!!

GREAT RECIPE!!! My only change: I did separate the eggs and put it in separately...  I stayed away from extra calories by not adding the top filling   My spanish neighbors loved it as well!

This is an awesome receipe.  I made this cake for some friends at work and they loved it.  The only problem is that I deviated a little from applying all the required cream and the cake came out a little dry, so make sure you follow the whole receipe.

I made this receipe for my daughter's birthday party and it was a hit with 50% of the people.  I loved it, but for some it was too sweet.  To cut down on the sweetness, I would decrease the sweetned condensed milk by half...and cut the sugar in the whipping cream down by half and it should be perfect. But overall, it was really, really tasty and good.

Thanks Stephanie for a great recipe!  This was delicious.  I cut down the sugar in the whipping cream to 1/2 c and it was great.  Ihad more liquid (milk) than the cake could hold after 4 hours in the fridge.I will cut the 2 c whole milk to 1 c the next time.   The flavor and consistency of the cake was really wonderful.  This is a keeper.

This cake was great! I was a little skeptical, but very pleasantly surprised. This cake is soggy, but it is supposed to be. It is not extremely sweet like most cakes, but it is sweet enough. The cake was pretty straight forward to make & easy, the ingredients are stuff you usually have on hand. I made this for my baby's 1st birthday party for his Mexican Fiesta party & everyone raved about it & asked for the recipe

This got rave reviews.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was amazing.  I made it or my Dad's birthday.  It's kind of a tradition even though I don't bake.  Bad things usually happen when I bake but this recipe was very easy to follow. Dad was pleased!

This cake is awesome--I won a dessert contest with it! Obviously the receipe is not for those who are trying to avoid dairy, but it's a wonderful cake for those who are not. I chill the sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk the night before. I also use the smaller can of evaporated milk, reduce the whole milk to 1 cup, and reserve 1/2 c. of the whipping cream for the milk mixture. You need to keep this dessert refrigerated until right before serving, then make sure you are feeding a bunch of people because this cake does not keep well--leftovers don't work, you have to make sure it gets eaten up when you serve it. I like to garnish the cake with fresh strawberries. For those who might be tempted to take shortcuts and use a store-bought white cake and then pour the milk mixture on it--don't! Make the cake in this receipe, as it's dense enough to soak up all the liquid. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this with a yellow cake mix rather than following the cake recipe.  I used the filling and topping recipe just as written here.  It's very good, but I would try putting half the sugar in the topping next time.

This cake was great. I made a few alterations to the directions. I added the egg yolks, and beat the egg whites to peaks separately. Then folded in the egg whites. I also added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract to the milk mixture for some extra flavor. Turned out wonderful!

This was good, but it seemed to need to be eaten with something to give it flavor.  Milk is pretty bland.  Perhaps I'm being a bit unfair, because this is an ethnic food that I'm not familiar with, so bland is probably how it's supposed to taste!  I thought it would be very good with berries.  My husband wanted cream cheese in the topping.  I had a lot of extra liquid, even after letting the cake soak in the filling overnight.

I thought the cake had good flavor but way too sweet.  Tastes like a sugar cookie with whip cream.  It is definately a heavy cake in the stomach so don't make it as a dessert after a meal. Good for cake and coffee.

DEElish! Used only the sweetened condesnsed milk and evaporated milk with about 1/4 cup of heavy cream for the milk part instead of the extra milk and it was perfect! No leakage at all just the perfect amount of moistness. Also didn't sweeten the whipped cream because the milk to me along with the cake was sweet enough.  Used the cinnamon on top...hmmm,hmmm good

This recipe was excellent! I initially made it with all the ingredients called for however, I followed the advice of another reviewer and I combined 1 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of heavy cream instead of the 2 cups of vitamin D milk. As for the whipped topping I had used the entire 1 cup of sugar. After trying the cake out I decided that the 1 cup had been too sweet for me so I scooped whipped cream off of the cake and re-made it using 2 tablespoons of sugar.

I cooked the cake part in a 9x13" aluminum pan -- I followed everything to the letter although I used fat-free milks.  I didn't scrimp on the heavy whipping cream because frankly, cool-whip doesn't come close and you only live once, right?  I suggest making this for a party or a big group because it took my boyfriend and I about a week & dedication to finish.  I am also game for adding strawberries or cherries -- this is the best tres leches cake I've ever had!

Warning: if you bake this in round cake pans intending to make a layer cake, you _will_ have excess liquid that won't get absorbed, and the cake will _weep_ even after you spread the whipped cream on it.  Between the two layers I spread strawberry filling (thinly sliced strawberries, mixed with briefly boiled  water, grenadine, lemon juice, cornstarch, and sugar), which added some extra flavor.

Sooo delicious!!  Family and friends all loved it, even the kids cleaned their plates.  It is cold, creamy and even tastes great using skim milk.  The second time I made this even lighter, topping with light Cool Whip (instead of whipped heavy cream) and a sprinkle of cinnamon for additional flavor. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I thought this was very good, and very easy too. Followed recipe exactly, except used 2% milk. Definitely need to poke lots of holes, and allow time for the milk to soak into the cake, in the frig of course to keep the cake cold to prep for fresh whipped cream layer ( so heavenly ), I found that using super fine suger works better along to whip the heavy cream with. This is suppose to be a wet cake, so when you cut in, some milk is suppose to seeps out. That is why it is so good !

I took the advice of some of the others about whipping the egg whites and folding them into the cake. I also let the cake sit overnight after pouring the milk mixture over it. I am not sure if that was the problem. It just didn't taste very good to me. The bottom was pretty soggy and the top was dry. I am not sure if I did something wrong but don't think I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe though!

Wow! If your looking for a sweet cake, this is it. It's a spongey type of cake that becomes moist when you pour on the milks. It was interesting and will certainly curb a sweet tooth.

I'm not sure if it was me or this recipe ( I'm going to say it was me :) but my first attempt the cake barely rose and I had to make it a layer cake. That being said the overall taste was really good and I got lot's of compliments on it but I just don't understand why it didn't rise. The cake was insanely dense. I followed others and didn't add the whole cup of sugar for the whipped cream and I'm glad I didn't because I added a 1/2 a cup and I thought it was a little too sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth.  Overall a great cake to make. It's not your ordinary cake so it's an interesting thing to make.  I saw others had added fruit to the top of their cake and I did as well and  I think it was a nice addition. I also added cinnamon to the whipped cream.

Delicious.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a lot of potential to play with this cake to add different flavors, be it with some fruit or some alcohol.  It is a great dessert for when you want something sweet and light-tasting.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did different was use 1 teaspoon vanilla in the cake batter and 2 cups of whipping cream for the topping. Definitely let it rest for atleast one night before serving to let the milks soak through. My mom and I thought it tasted more flavorful on the third day. I'm only giving it 4 stars because my husband thought it was bland, but he had it the next day.

Yum! It was even better the next day. I would recommend refrigerating overnight before serving. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was a tiny bit too spongy for me, but excellent still.

I made this cake for part of our Easter dinner, and was a little leary of the finished product.  WELL, that quickly changed after taking the first bite!  I substituted a boxed white cake because of time restrictions, and used 1/2 whole milk, and 1/2 coconut milk in the 3 milk combo.  I do feel like the milk could have been reduced by about a cup.  The cake was a real hit.  We recently went to Punta Cana for my daughter's wedding, and 3 milk cake is very popular there.  This cake is right on up there with that cake!

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because all the liquid didn't absorb. But I just spooned a bit off and moved on. I used half and half as many reviewers recommended, & I used 1/4 cup sugar in the whipped topping, which was perfect. I can't wait to have another serving in the morning!

Loved it.  I think next time we won't use quite so much sweetened condensed milk and replace it with whole milk or cream.  Was very sweet.

This is the first time I have ever eaten Tres Leches Cake, so I have nothing to compare it to. Let me begin by saying that I used 1% milk and after reading reviews(which I should know to read ahead of time) I plan on trying half and half next time (it could have been a little richer..my fault there!) I found the whipped cream topping just a little to sweet for my liking and I will cut back on the sugar next time ( again, it pays to read reviews prior to making...I would have slowed down and tasted) Overall it was delightful! A totally new treat for my family and I intend on making again! Thanks for sharing and thank to all the reviewers!

Definitely a 5 star recipe ! I have never made a tres leche cake before although I have eaten many being my husband is Mexican. He has been asking me to find a recipe and bake him one for months now. Finally I did and this was the recipe I chose and I will look no farther. Thank you . I followed the directions exactly and it was perfect. My husband loved it. I can't wait to bake one for my inlaws. It was better than most that we have eaten at parties we've attended. Thanks !

I made this recipe for my husband who had recently eaten Tres Leches cake at a Brazilian restaurant and also at a Honduran wedding.  He said this one rated right up there with them.  It was even better the 2nd day.  Next time I may try adding some rum extract as part of the liquid.  I will absolutely make this cake again.

I made this cake last night for the first time and it was fantastic. The cake was delicious. This is one recipe I will continue to make. The frosting was so light and fluffy my dad told me not to rinse out the bowl it was made in. He cut up some fresh pears and used the remaining frosting on them.

very good! It was a hit, I took it to a large family dinner and it got gobbled up very quickly. I think I was the toughest critic, I thought the cake could've been a little thicker, I did not seperate my egg yolks and whites, but i think next time I will. Very good. I will make this again.

Very tasty! Changes I made were: I beat the eggs by themselves very well before adding them to the batter. Once cooled puncture the cake with a fork to help the milk mixture soak in. Used 2 cups heavy whipping cream instead of whole milk in the milk mixture which makes it a bit thicker. I used cool whip for the topping and squeezed caramel ice cream topping over the coolwhip for a nice presentation. Don't worry, the milk mixture seems like alot, but it is just right.  Once it is poured over the cake refrigerate it and it will almost completely soak in. The only person that didn't like this was my brother who "doesn't like soggy cake" everyone else loves it! Delicious!

Very easy! Very moist cake, but nothing exceptional. I did not find that it was too milky as in other reviews. You have to let it soak overnight to get the real juicy effect!

This was really good, but the recipe needed a few tweaks.  I used 1 cup 2% milk + 1 cup half-and-half instead of whole milk (was all I had on hand).  The cake didn't rise very much, and I think it might have been because the flour (gluten) was overworked.  Next time I will add all the flour, beating just until blended.  I read the reviews about the cake being too milky, so I added only half the milk.  An hour or two later, the cake had absorbed it all, so I ended up adding the rest (so for next time, I will add all the milk to begin with).  I mixed up a package of fluffy white icing (box mix) for the frosting.  Wonderful!  Served fresh strawberries and blueberries on the side.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good. I have made it twice, once with and the other without separating the eggs. You should do that. Also, I would not recommend  pouring all of the milk.

This recipe was super easy and turned out great! I made it for a group and only received positive feedback, and a lot of requests for the recipe! Almost everyone came back for seconds. I definitely recommend this tres leches recipe.

I made this to try and replicate a restaurant's quality. I never heard of res leches before. The milk mixture was good and overall the cake was tasty. It was a bit of an effort and the cake part didn't seem light enough and it wasn't enough cake (maybe use a springform pan). The recipe submitted by Monica was more like what I had at the restaurant.

Disappointing results.  I followed the recipe but cake itself was not moist and fluffy like a sponge cake, but rather thick and heavy.  Three milk sauce is tasty but the cake recipe needs improvement. I think I'll follow a sponge cake recipe and then use the three milk sauce in this recipe.

Great recipe however I made it easier.  I used a boxed of yellow cake, made as directed on box (added vanilla to cake mixture).  Poured the milk mixture as indicated on this recipe.  Created the whipped topping as indicated on this recipe, added marschino cherries and nut topping. Took less time and was great!!

Very good cake - the longer you let the milk soak in the better, otherwise cake can start out a little dry.

This was really good. I can't help to wonder how a little bit of Kaluha would taste with it or even a touch of strong coffee??? I think I'll have to try this again with my modifications.

I halved the sugar in the recipe because condensed milk is already so sweet, and I have a horror of eating too-sweet things...without the whipped cream topping, I think the cake is perfectly sweet. With the topping, it is sugar overload, BUT that's just me. I'd probably use waaay less sugar in the topping next time, or just not use it at all. Other than the sweetness, the cake is superb. I love the moist density and the milky taste. My son had his plain, but for the grownups, I grated Oaxacan chocolate on top and soaked the pieces in a bit of Kahlua. With a coffee or an espresso, it is a coffee-lover's dream. :)

I decreased the sugar, I always decrease the sugar in recipes because they are always too sweet. So, it was roughly 3/4 to 1 cup that I added. Also, the batter was way to thick to pour, it was starting to look more like cookie dough, so I added just a little half and half. For the milk mixture I did one cup of regular coconut milk (using the cream that separates, not the watery stuff, as much as possible) and one cup half and half instead of the two cups whole milk. I also added half a cup of hazelnut kahlua, but next time I would add more because I couldn't taste it at all. And, again, for the topping I decreased the sugar and added a touch of cayenne pepper. It turned out really well, but I wouldcdecrease the milk, because all of it definitely didn't soak in. But, it's  very tasty.

This was pretty good. Spongy cake with plenty of milk to soak it through. I thought it could have been a little sweeter to be like my favorite restaurants' Tres Leche, but still, pretty good. I might try other recipes to see if this is the one I like best.

I made this cake for my husband this past Valentine's Day and he LOVED IT! Once you complete your cake refrigerate it right away. I bake the cake in a 8x3 round cake pan & cut in half I put strawberries in the middle and put whipped cream all over it turned out GREAT!

This was way too sweet.  cutting the sugar in the cake and the whipping cream would take care of that.  Otherwise, it is straight forward and easy to make.

I took this to a dinner party and got rave reviews, especially from the hostess's husband.  He apparently dreams of the cake. Personally I don't prefer the cake and had to drain off some of the milk since it would not soak in. But overall a good recipe!

This is the first Tres Leches Cake I have made and so far it looks FABULOUS!  I did separate my eggs and beat the whites... but when I went to add them to the "flour mixture" as suggested, they had separated into foam and whites, so it was rather gooey, but the cake batter turned into a cake!  I cut the top off to make it flat and have been dipping the pieces into the milk mixture, and that's tasty, so I can only imagine what this is going to taste like in the morning!!!  Yay!!!

Very good! A little heavy on the sugar. We added some dark rum (splashed on top of the cake) which added some nice flavor. Wished we had added strawberries too.

I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs) and cooked it for 25 minutes in an 8x8 pan.  It was wonderful!  My mother, who doesn't like this at the restaurants, even enjoyed it!

Really good. I always pour milk over my cake and this is like that only better. I'm going to add fresh cherries to the next one and let the juice sink in with the milk. I wanted to try it just as written before I modified. It's a great "add to" recipe. Wonderful.

There is a local restaurant that makes the best tres leches cake. I have searched and no one compares. I made this recipe for a girls night and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. It was amazing. I have made it several times. I make it as is and it's delicious. I poked as many holes as I could to make sure the cake got really moist. People have even come up to me to say, "What dessert did you make at your dinner party? I heard it was amazing!"

Super Simple Cake. I was skeptical, but surprisingly the cake was able to absorb all of the milk. Initially, I didn't think the batter was enough for a 9x13, but after baking and the addition of milk, the cake turned out nicely.

This cake is awesome!!  I made it for my Mexican hubby and in-laws and they LOVED it!!  I knew I had a hit when my mother-in-law actually asked me for MY recipe...  The cake had the perfect texture to hold the milk, and it was just delicious.  THANKS for sharing!  :o)

This was so moist and delicious!  I'm not much of a baker, but I've had this cake before (different recipe) and wanted to try it on my own.  This cake surpassed what I'd previously had.  I had to make my own evaporated milk b/c I didn't have any, but it seemed perfect!

me and my fiance tried this authentic tres leche cake recipe and it was so so so good and what I did is I put a little bit of cream of coconut in the cake mix and baked it and then I put some in the milk mixture you pour on top and it gave the cake a coconut flavor, the cake soaked up the milk mixture like its suppost to with no problems, I will be making this cake again for sure and next time I'm gonna put toasted coconut on top after I put the whipped topping on, I give this recipe 5 stars

This was my first time ever making a tres leches cake, and i HIGHLY OPPOSE anyone that has not made one before to not make this. I can see that if made right, this cake would be good. I only let the cake sit a couple hours before eating. The taste was good, but the texture was not. It was mushy and had the texture of cottage cheese. I followed the directions very carefully even, and measured everything perfectly.

I made this recipe and took it to a work potluck.  Rave reviews all around. Also three Latino friends took all the leftovers home to give to their families.  Very easy to make.  Very moist, sweet and rich.  I topped half with strawberries and half with just the whipped cream. This recipe was very easy to make.  I poured on the milk mixture when the cake was warm but not hot. It soaked right in. There was a little milk at the bottom of the pan when I served it but that is how it is supposed to be.  Very good!!!

Wow! This is sooo good. We chose not to frost this cake(it is very rich without it). Instead we topped it with a dollop of fatfree coolwhip.

While i was making this cake, it seemed all wrong.  Pouring the milk over the top was so counter-intuitive that i was sure it was going to be gross.  WRONG!  This was really delicious and I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't like anything I had had before, but very delicious.  I followed the directions as written, but used Cool Whip because it travels better than whipped cream and I was going to a potluck!

Very good cake!  I have never had this before and I was not sure what to expect but it is very good.  I used a 9 x13 pan and followed directions with one exception; I didn't have whole milk so I used 1 1/2 c skim and 1/2 c heavy cream for the 2 C milk it called for.  My cake was done in less than 25 min.  I set the timer for 25min and when I checked it was done and probably could have come out a bit sooner.  My liquid was absorbed quite well nothing pooling at the bottom of the pan and the whipped cream on top, YUM!  I can see that fruit would be great with this for a change of pace, maybe peaches, strawberries or even pineapple.

Sorry, but for first time Tres Leches makers, this is not a great recipe.  Too poor information!!  There's no description as to how much time to let the liquid set with the cake.  I gave it 4 hours and the dish was still more of a cake soup than anything else.  I am not an inexperienced dessert-maker, but this recipe did not work out as listed.  Maybe the milks need to be added while the cake is still warm??  Maybe less liquid needs to be added??  Maybe the cake should be allowed to set for 24 hours??  I don't know what the magic cure is, but, as the recipe reads, for first time makers of Tres Leches, I would not select this recipe.

P.S. The actual flavor of this recipe is very good, so if you're not concerned with texture, the recipe, as posted, is just fine.

Living in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas (w/in a few miles of the Mexican border) I've heard about this cake for quite some time and finally tried my hand at making it myself.  I followed this recipe exactly and have gotten rave reviews.  A couple of people have even said that it was the best Tres Leches cake they'd ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this recipe for a baby shower and was very nervous about all the milk.  It soaked up pretty well and was a hit.  It had a sponge like texture which I really liked. My daughter says this is the only cake she wants for her birthdays!

This was too sweet and the cake was just okay.  I think I will alter this next time with a different cake recipe.  This one did not allow for much absorption of the milks.  This is a good place to start.

I was very happy with how this recipe turned out!  When I poured the milk mixture over the cake, I thought for sure that it would be too much.  Within less than 5 minutes, though, the cake had absorbed the milk mixture.  Everyone who ate it either liked it or loved it... no dislikes!  I sprinkled sweetened coconut over 1/2 the cake.  Delish.

I made this cake for Easter and my choir members loved it. One suggestion I received was to add another teaspoon of vanilla flavoring to the 3 milks, blending the milk and then pouring it over the cake. Instead of whipped cream for the topping, I used Cool Whip.

This cake is amazing! I refrigerated it overnight and then mixed cool whip with a little vanilla to use as an icing. I may try the heavy cream next time, but I won't mix a lot of sugar with it. The cake is sweet enough...and very moist. Lovely recipe! :)

Awesome Recipe. The cake was moist and delcious. The three milks mixed together were perfect for the cake. It created the right amount of liquid to soak into the cake. I loved the homemade whipped topping. I have had this dessert on numerous occassions, often times it is too sweet. This cake was just right.

Update 2012: I have been using this tres leches recipes since 2009. Living in Miami, tres leches can be found everywhere. This is still the best I have tried. My husband loves it and requests this every birthday. We even made it for my baby shower.

I loved it. Never had it before. I only had a cup worth of the heavy whipping cream.. seemed fine without the other 1/2cup. Was not eggy, I had quite a bit of milk still at the bottom of the pan to use with slices. Very Very scrumptious! Will make again!

I made it for my boyfriends b-day and it rocked! It teasted even better the second day. It was just perfect not too moist. The only thing that was not so great was my whipcream, I might have overdone it with the powedered sugar. It is better to make whip cream with splenda because it does now weigh it down, it comes out super thick. Thanx!

this was the most ausome cake.  i love tres leche and have never tried to make one myself.  i did not have good luck with the icing, but ended up adding a layer of strawberries (thawed in heavy syrup) and topping it with whipped cream. it was heavenly.  i also poured the milks over the cake while it was still quite warm, then refrigerated it.
can't wait to make it again.

I don't know if I made it right because to be so juicy it was really crumbly rather than moist I'm looking for a moist tres leche.

excellent!!! I just made this and does taste as if it was restaurant material.. The only changes I made was to top the cake with cool whip.  As per other reviews after the cake cooled I poked tons of holes in the cake and put the cake back in the pan and poured the milks on top of the cake slowly every 10 minutes or so...It is time consuming but so worth it. Thanks for the recipe...

The taste was accurate, but the texture was more crumbly instead of squishy.  Still searching for the perfect Tres Leches...

Everyone at my workplace loved it!!! My girlfriends birthday was today and I decided to make somthing that I knew she would enjoy and would be unique. I am hispanic and have had the pleasure of eating this cake from a very young age.... I have one gripe with this cake though.... there were still dry spots after dumping ALL of the liquid into the cake!!! I also poured it into the cake while it was hot as said by many people and it absorbed ALL of the liquid which leads me to believe that maybe it was too little liquid. Next time, I will increase the amount of liquid but besides that, it was a delicious cake!!! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

I have never made and have never had this cake before.  It turned out fine, not dence, i poured all the milk mixture on top of the cake after it cooled, my 5 year old son helped me make it and he poked a couple dozen holes in the cake with a wooden skewer.  after soaking the milk up I frostened the cake and set it in the fridge for about 2 hours.  Cut it and noticed some milk on the bottom of the cake pan, not much.  I'm not sure if that's normal or not.  But the family liked it.  It was deffinetly different kind of cake but tastey.  I will make again.  Thanks.

Super tasty! I baked the cake in a glass pie dish, so it was nice and thick. I also beat the cake batter a long time with the electric mixture, cuz others said they would like the cake more fluffy and less dense. The cake did turn out fluffy and airy. When I poured the milk over I had to pour some on, then wait for it to seep in, then pour more, then wait, etc. so it took a little while to do that. I actually ended up not using about 1/4 cup of the milk, and it turned out great. Just the right amount of moisture. And I didn't add as much sugar to the whipping cream, cuz I don't like it too sweet. I made it the morning of and kept it in the fridge all day, then served it that evening and that seemed to be plenty of time for the milk to seep in and everything to settle. I had never had tres leches cake before, so I really wasn't sure what to expect, but it was really good. And it's a fairly easy cake to make, with ingredients I normally have (just run to the store to get some fresh strawberries). Excellent cake, excellent recipe.

I'm not much of a baker but I love this recipe because it's simple.  I just made it today and passed it out to the neighbors and co-workers and they all loved it.  My boyfriend especially loved it because the leftover milk he got to use it in his coffee.  I cheated and used a yellow cake box mix for my cake.  I used a knife with pointy tips to scratch the golden brown top off the cake so that it could absorb the milk mixture better.  My topping was with the classic strawberry slices and whip cream.  It was sooo good!  This is what I'm making my mom when I go see her in Florida next week.

It was awesome.  I've always ordered tres leches for birthdays and now I know how to make one.  Thanks. I didn't change the recipe a bit except I didn't use all milk mixture since I don't like my tres leches to be drowning in milk.  Also, I used the marshmallow frosting instead.

i scared by the contrasting reviews, but decided to go with the recipe.  even more frightened when the initial cake turned out like bread.  but once i soaked it with the mixture, it was perfect.  i substituted the whole milk with 1% milk and it turned out fine.  some of my friends who tried it thought it too sweet, so people who do not like things too sweet could put less sugar.  i am a novice cook and the cake turned out great.  the recipe is good---just follow it closely and you will end up with a very nice cake.

Not bad. Skipped the whole milk (afraid it would be too much liquid for the cake to absorb) and topped the cake with unsweetened whip cream instead (to counteract the sweetness of the cake). Yum!! Thanks!

This recipe is very touchy!! The first time I made the cake it was so dense, it would not soak up any milk! I remade the cake this time adding 1/2 tsp. baking powder totaling 11/2  tsp. and also seperated the eggs. I added the yolks first and beat the egg whites and then folded them in. The cake actually turned out the second time, but I think next time I will try a different recipe, or stick with the box mix cke

The flavor of this cake is excellent. I could eat the whole thing myself! The cake turned out a little more dense than I wanted. 
Next time when I make it I will try separating the egg whites from the yolks, beating the whites until fluffy and then fold them into the batter. I had to drain off some of the liquid, but I don't consider that much of a problem. It's better to have too much than too little! This is one of my favorites!

They serve this cake at my favorite mexican restaurant, so I was excited to make it at home. I did something incorrect, however, and my cake turned out with a pudding-like texture  instead of a cake-like texture...I must have put too much of the milk mixture in. It had a good taste, but the texture was all wrong. Next time I'm going to make this as a sheet cake, and cut the milk mixture in half. Great start, though.

I made this earlier this week and it was okay. For some reason the cake didn't come out right but I'm not sure what went wrong. It took a long time to bake, almost an hour!! Thought that was weird. So anyway it didn't turn out as good as I had hoped but still was delicious. My family enjoyed it.

the cake came out too "dryish" not enough of the milk mixture absorbed. maybe it needs "cake" flour or maybe next time i'll try the cake mix in a box (like others have done) and hopefully it will come out better.

I was pretty disappointed with this cake. I baked for 30 minutes and let it cool. I added the 3-milk sauce but would not absorb anything. When I finally tried it, the texture was not spongy as I expected but stiff and had the consistancy of a poundcake. The taste was pretty eggy.

I made this for a dinner I was catering and it was a big hit with those who like tres leches. Personally, I don't care much for the texture (fault of me, not the recipe), but the flavor was good. I did make the whipped cream frosting with powdered sugar (now that was pretty darn good!). It looks like you're headed for a big, sloppy mess when you pour all the milks over the cake, but it actually sets nicely in the fridge. If I ever have cause to make a tres leches cake again, I will certainly use this recipe.

This did not turn out well at all.  The cake was not moist, just wet.

Although this wasn't my favorite cake, I made it for my husband's co-workers and they all loved it!  I made the cakes (4 of them all together) each in disposable pans, they baked up perfectly.  I did pour ALL of the recipe amt of milks over the cakes and it was completely absorbed the next morning.  The whipped cream icing was too sweet for my taste, even after cutting the sugar back to half, so if I were to do this again I'd cut it back even more.  Overall, this recipe was very easy to work with, turned out just like I expected, and was the perfect end to a spicey mexican luncheon!

I've made this twice now.  People LOVE it.  I ran out of time to make real whipped cream and used Dream Whip and it was still fabulous!

The cake was very good but a little too sweet for me.  I will make this again, but with less sugar next time.

I read the reviews before i made the cake and made some changes acording to the sugestions for ex.i separeted the eggs and beat the whites,also the whole milk i only used one cup. its good to let the cake soak the milk for around 2 hours before putting the topping which i made frosty it takes a lot longer but its better i also made less than sugested because i didn't want it to be too sweet. bottom line it was great i will make it again but its a lot of work so i will but not any time soon.

Very yummy cake.  Much the same as I've had in Panama and Mexican restaurants here in the States.  I thought it was the perfect amount of sweetness (many other reviewers have said that it's too sweet).  I will definitely make this one again.

I didn't actually get to try any of this cake, but I gave it to a Peruvian friend for her birthday.  She was missing home and wanted a traditional Tres Leches cake so bad.  She loved it and she even asked for the recipe.  I've never had Tres Leches cake so I don't know how traditional it was, but she loved it at least.

UNBELEIVABLE! I was skeptical the whole time I was making it. I kept thinking, "there's no way this is going to work"... but I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out literally PERFECT! I wouldn't adjust a thing. My Mexican grandmother kept raving about it all day!

I'd not made a tres leches cake before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was very moist and quite sweet.  I used only 1/4 cup sugar in the whipped cream.  I plan to make two cakes in springform pans and make a layer cake.  How does one use fruit to decorate or garnish the cake?
