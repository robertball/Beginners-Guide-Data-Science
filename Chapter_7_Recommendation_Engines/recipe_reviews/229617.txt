I just made this recipe and it is delicious although the proportions are way off! 2 cups of rice would have made enough peppers to feed an army. I made the sauce separately, including the tomatoes, separated 2 cups of sauce to which I added 1 cup cooked rice and that was enough to fill 4 big peppers. I had about 3 cups of sauce left, without rice, which would be more than enough for 1 lb. pasta. I also used homemade tomato sauce. In any case the recipe is very good tasting and will definitely make again

I cut the rice in half and still had enough filling for 8 peppers!  They were tastey but I added some red pepper chilies to spice them up.

this was GREAT, tasted just like my mom's. ...i used 1.5c rice and added a can of corn bc its how my mom made hers. i used pizza seasoning rather than plain italian seasoning also for a little extra punch, and it was fantastic! made 6 peppers, have enough filler to freeze & make another six later.  cook time was longer for me than in the recipe...it took 2hrs at 350, not 1 as in the recipe, to get the heat up to par and the peppers softened like they ought to be.

Yellow Pepper with Ground Turkey

I am making this for dinner, but instead of Red Peppers I am using Yellow Peppers. I used Ground Turkey instead of Ground Beef. I only added the onion and chopped garlic, sprinkled on Italian seasoning, Paprika, salt and pepper to the ground turkey, then I added the white rice (I am using white rice, because that is what I have in my cabinet). I didn't add any tomatoes/Red Sauce to my pepper as I do not like tomatoes. But I added Classico Spicy Mariana (spaghetti sauce) to the other pepper. (My bf loves spicy.)

Oven - 350 degrees - 50 minutes (only 2 peppers)

I have completed this easy recipe as it turned out good. I could have added more seasoning to it, but I didn't want to over do it. I followed Janeâ€™s recipe by following on how to prepare the meat and peppers and how long to cook the peppers for.

This recipe is pretty good with adjustments. A little bland for my taste. i think that I would add some hot peppers next time.

I followed the prevailing advice and only used one cup of rice. I also omitted the can of tomatoes. For seasoning I used 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp marjoram and 1/2 tsp basil. I added salt and pepper as well as cayenne pepper to give it a little kick! For mushrooms, I used a 4 oz package of shiitake mushrooms. The meat that I used was ground venison fried in coconut oil with a splash of worcestershire sauce.

I  had extra meat filling, but not too much. If I had slightly larger peppers, it would have been fine.

WE didn't have parmesan so we topped with grated cheddar.

I made this with red & green peppers cut in half & cleaned. I added 1/2 chopped onion to meat. Omitted the diced tomatoes. I also added a cup of mushrooms and a nice big handful of spinach. Next time I make these I would add another 1/2 pound or so of hamburg. Other than that they came out delicious :)

It's got really good flavour, but I am with everyone else, only half the rice is needed and I used chunky tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, the paste was a little too much tomato acidity for my liking.  Overall, I really good recipe, thanks!

I only had 3 peppers so i cut the rice in half but not the meat.  I like mine more meaty anyway.  I still have stuffing left over too so i just refrigerated it to use with another dish.  I enjoyed how easy this recipie was and you did not have to buy extra stuff to make them.  I had everything already and i like that it makes it easier.  Just pulled them out of the oven and they look awesome.  Also i bake mine with the tomato sauce poued over then some cheddar cheese on top.  I stick them back in the oven just for a few min after i turn it off with the shredded cheddar on top.  I am excited for my meal! Thank you!
