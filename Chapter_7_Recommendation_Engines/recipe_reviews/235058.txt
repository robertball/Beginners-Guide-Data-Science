Followed the recipe as is written. Very good, and easy to make. Just enough cinnamon and nutmeg.

This is a really simple and tasty dessert! I had alot of apples gifted to me and wanted to use them up so instead of my usual apple pie recipe i decided to try this one! My only changes were I added 1/2 cup additional sugar my apples were very tart and I made my own pie crust(chef John's Easy homemade pie crust) My Daughter really enjoyed this tonight! Thank you for sharing!

I rolled out the pastry onto parchment paper and just laid it into the pan. I mixed about 2-3 T of softened butter with the apples. then rolled out the top pastry onto more parchment paper and transfered onto the mix. slightly pinched edges together. then I brushed on a little egg-wash and sprinkled sugar & cinnamon on top.  Instead of all white sugar I used half brown & half white. still used the icing for the top :)

I made this for a family get-together. It turned out great. I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and did not make the glaze topping. Also, I used 3 Granny Smith, and 4 Golden Delicious apples. Everyone enjoyed it.

Stayed pretty true to the recipe.  Used mostly Gala apples with a couple of Honeycrisp.  I scattered a couple of tablespoons of butter on the apple mixture before adding the top crust.  I then used an egg white wash on the top crust and liberally sprinkled on a cinnamon, sugar, light brown sugar mix before popping it in the oven.  Went over very well at the office snack day!

Easy to make and my family loved it.   I skipped the frosting and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

Easy recipe to make.  I wasn't going to make the topping but at the last minute decided to and had an issue in that I had no vanilla--substituted a bit of peppermint extract instead and WOW-fantastic.
