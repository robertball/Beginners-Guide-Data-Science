This recipe was very easy, and came out quite well.  I did add extra coconut.  They freeze very well too.

My family loved this recipe.  The cake part wasn't crumbly, but spreadable.  They thought it was like fudge brownie with coconut on top.  I left out the nuts and just added extra coconut.  I am going to share this recipe with friends.

Rename this recipe. Yeah it's some kind of brownies with coconut goo on top. Very, very yummy. I left out the pecans and added 1/3 cup extra coconut to make up for it. I used a cake mix with pudding and found the base was not exactly "crumbly" but more like spreadable like, oh yeah, did I mention, brownies. Still five star good and the coconut topping added an interesting dimension to the, uhhh, brownies. Delicious. Hubby loved them too.

These are great! Very easy to make - I did have to cook a little longer than
called for and then slightly burned the edges. Next time I'll be more careful
and take them out a bit before the center is completely set.  They're definitely 
a keeper!  Thanks for sharing

I made these with a yellow cake mix instead of chocolate.  The almond flavor was great!

Great bars!  Next time I will probably add mini chocolate chips to the cake mixture to add a little more to it.  I also drizzled bittersweet chocolate on top, it went well with the sweetness of the coconut layer!

Knowing these would have a brownie texture, and that pecans didn't have to be added to make them successfully, I made these and loved 'em.  If they could only have lasted long enough for the bake sale.

These cookies were really easy to make. The cake mix makes a nice crust. I found them delicious, and I couldn't stop eating them. My husband found them a bit too sweet for his taste, but that was okay - more for me!

The cake below the topping is moist. The topping is superb. My crew loves coconut, so I use more than 1/4 cup on the top. This is a keeper for us.

I just made these cookie bars.  Instead of using the box of devil's food cake mix, I used a box of butter pecan cake mix, I added a tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon, and I didn't have any pecans on hand so I used chopped walnuts instead.  These cookie bars are to die for.  I froze half of them for when my son comes home for Christmas from Canada, and left the other half for my other son and husband, along with other family members to enjoy.  I'm very happy I gave it a chance...

This recipe was okay, but not great.  The bottom layer was dry and the chocolate overpowered the coconut.  My family wasn't very impressed with these, so I guess they're just not for us.

I was looking for a different bar recipe and found it.  Easy to make but you have to be VERY sure the centre is set- a little tricky.  I used a yellow cake mix then frosted the bars with a chocolate icing- they were good.  Next time thought I would add about another 1/2 of coconut to the centre because found 1 cup wasn't quite enough.

I was looking for something easy to bake for Christmas and these were a hit!  Although I made them again for new year's and added an extra 1/2 cup of coconut... this time the bars weren't overpowered by the chocolate.

just made this last night, simply delicious.I only changed 1 thing, I used coconut oil in place of butter in cake mix. I used a mixer to mix it all, so was crumbly, and patted well in pan.  would give this 10 stars if I could. can't wait to use another flavor cake mix .

As others said, crust portion was more like brownies.  Baked in time given, but I got in a hurry & didn't let them cool long enough before cutting...they didn't look nice but they tasted good...really rich, though, they should last a little bit! Got 24 out of a 13 x 9 pan.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These remind me of German Sweet Chocolate Cake. Delicious. Cake is very moist and chewy, topping set up perfectly. Remove this from the oven when golden brown on top and the filling should be set. I thought they were perfect. Follow the directions exactly.

These were so easy, and a huge hit at my office!  I think I bought the wrong kind of cake mix though, I forgot to convert to metric before I went shopping.  Either way, it was delicious.

While these do taste good, I found the cake layer to be a bit dry.  It does hold its shape nice after cutting and presents well, but I guess I prefer my other recipe using a brownie for the base (bit moister).

These were good but I wasn't sure I liked the consistency of the cake. It's more like a brownie than a cookie.

My hubby is a coconut freak, so I thought I would try this one out. I only had yellow cake mix though, and had to substitute walnuts for the pecans. Still turned out yummy...not quite a 5 star, but that could have been because of the substitutions. Thanks for sharing!

I tried the devil's food cake mix, as well as yellow cake mix. Both were very good. I agree w/ the other review which said it was not very cookie-like. It definitely has the consistency of a brownie...but still very yummy!

I didn't trust these when they came out of the oven, but they tasted really good!
