These have been a Christmas tradition in our family for three generations. We love to eat them while opening presents Christmas morning. We call them Angel Twists. We make vanilla sugar to use when rolling them out. Instead of my food processor, I use the dough hook on my mixer.  I have also mixed these by hand.  Works no matter which method I use.

We like this recipe.  It was very easy to put together and I did refrigerate it overnight as the recipe called for.  The twists were tender and delicious, not too sweet.  It really didn't puff up all that much for a yeast cookie, but maybe that was because this recipe called for no raising of the dough-just put it right in the oven.  tip; we used a ruler and a pizza cutter to cut the strips into even 1 inch wide strips and it worked well to keep them a consistent size for even baking.  Thank you for a great recipe-we plan to make it again for the holidays.

Delicious! These goodies taste like a yummy yeast donut. . .except better. . .because the texture is delicious! My food processor was too small to mix everything in, so I just split the ingredients. But, it worked out fine. The cookies are time-intensive, but Roth every minute! Would be great for a special breakfast.

Very delicious and a special recipe. It is a bit time consuming but worth the trouble for an elegant and festive cookie. Chilling the dough in the 2 wrapped disks worked out just fine fine for me. The first roll-out does not have to be a perfect rectangle, as the first folding of the dough into thirds takes care of the shape.

This was a little challenging and time consuming, but magically delicious. Out of all the cookie recipes I did this year, this one was by far the most loved.

Oh, my gosh! - Someone else has our "secret family recipe!"  ;-) 

We're in the third generation of making these also.  They always disappear first at Christmas.  I've never seen this recipe in print before.  Interesting to see that several others are familiar with it also.

I received this recipe over 50 years ago from my lifelong friend's mom who is now 85 years old. It came from her mom, who brought it with her from Sweden. It is spectacular and is part of Christmas for me. Her version split the butter into half butter/half shortening (I think because in the 1970s butter was very expensive). I will think of her everytime I make these at Christmas, as will my children.


Update: I notice  this version says to refigerate for 2 hours. My 50+ year old versions says at least 4 hours and up to 2 days. I think this may be why some had poor outcomes with the recipe. It really needs to solidify and 2 hours is not enough. I use overnight (dough one day, rollout/twisting/baking the next).

I made these for the Recipe Group's selection for this week.  I like these much more than my husband does--he doesn't understand subtle yeast flavor.  My family members also loved these.  I put together the dough last night and baked them this morning, following the recipe until I got to the second clump of dough because I used cinnamon sugar for that half.  My dough divided into two 1 lb 1 3/8 oz hunks.  I do think that when the dough comes from the fridge that it needs to sit for a while before working with it; my first one was much harder to work with than the second one.  I rolled it out on a Silpat with a sheet of parchment on top that had been lightly floured.  I kept losing track of how many times I turned and folded, but that didn't seem to matter much.  I used a plastic knife to cut the slices which took about 13 minutes to bake.  My family preferred the cinnamon sugar twists, but then we are crazy about cinnamon!  Thanks for a beautiful new way to enjoy yeast bread!

Recipe Group Selection for 11/15/2014 -  These are phenomenal.  My food processor was a little too small for this recipe, but I just finished it on my pastry board.  I love that you can make them as sweet as you want by the amount of sugar you add to the layers.  Thanks for sharing!

It's a fun twist (ha) on regular shortbread cookies, though I found that the dough was kind of hard to work with. Regardless they still ended up tasting good, and I'd definitely make them again.

I made these a couple different times over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.  They turned out great! It is a family favorite so will make again and again.
Fyi, I left some dough in refrigerator for a week before making the last batch. Turned out fine!

My mother made these but in a horse shoe shape when I was a kid (I'm 62 now). I love them and still make them to this day. I'm seeing some recipes putting icing/frosting on them. They truly don't need anymore sugar it would kill that delicate slightly yeast flavor.

These turned out very tasty!  They were light and flaky almost like a croissant.  Next time, I will drizzle some melted Nutella and raspberry jam instead of sugar.
