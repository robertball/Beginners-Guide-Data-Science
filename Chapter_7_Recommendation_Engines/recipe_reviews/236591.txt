The changes I made were only because of what I had on hand: whole milk instead of 1%, "Italian Blend" for straight Mozzarella and Reduced Fat Ritz. This recipe was delicious. My hubby, who usually wants nothing to do with anything that has the word "casserole" in it, proclaimed it a "Keeper"! (He even went back for seconds!) I made it exactly to the recipe. I don't think the ingredients I substituted altered the taste in any drastic measure. I was surprised how much flavor this had for just using salt & pepper for seasoning. I plan to serve the leftovers as a side for some baked Cod. I think it will go well together.     Update: Paired the leftovers with baked Cod and they went quite well together.  Baked the Cod with just a coating of melted butter, salt & pepper. Put the leftover casserole in a smaller baking dish, covered with foil. Put both in a 375° oven for about 20 minutes.  Deeelish!
Update: I wanted a pasta dish so I made this minus the Ritz crackers, using 50/50 Sharp Cheddar and Mozzarella and about 1/2 cup additional milk. I mixed it with a box of Penne pasta (half cooked - about 8 minutes) and put in casserole dish. I topped with a thin layer of Italian bread crumbs and covered with foil to bake. OMG! This is definitely a keeper!

My husband is so picky so i wouldnt tell him what i was making, as i was sure he would think it sounded gross. I had the ingredients on hand and wanted to use up some squash and ground turkey. It was faaaabulous! Even my 2year old was eating it..and she is just as picky as her dad!

I thought this was quite good.  I used Saltines instead of Ritz because that's what I had, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I was a bit worried that the squash wouldn't be soft enough, but it was fine.  It's pretty salty with the crackers, so I don't think you need to add the extra salt.

This was delicious! I made some substitutions to make this South Beach friendly. I added salt, pepper and some onion powder to the squash mixture while it was cooking. I subbed in Swiss for mozzarella because that's what I had on hand, but I think it was a crucial change. I omitted the Ritz crackers and subbed almond meal. I added garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to the almond meal, then tossed it with a couple of tablespoons of melted butter before topping the casserole. The sweetness of the almond meal was a nice compliment to the squash. So, SO good! I think turkey sausage would also be delicious. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I followed Kristen's recipe but used unflavored almond milk instead.  Also, when I bought Ritz Crackers, the new "Everything" variety (like "Everything" bagels) was on sale.   This worked really well and gave a little extra zing to the dish.  I made the casserole to take to a friend, but it smelled and looked so good, I made one for myself too!  Great "lighter" casserole with a lot of flavor.

I completely deviated from the original recipe. I sauteed the onion with the ground turkey, then added the butternut squash and a can of stewed tomatoes. I also added garlic and onion powder to the egg mixture, and covered the casserole with 2 cups of the mozzarella cheese and breadcrumbs since I didn't have the crackers. (Next time I would use crackers.)I had 2 servings.

Well i had to tweek this because of not having all the ingred. This probably would of been 4-5 stars had I used mozzarella cheese instead of Guyre. I also used vanilla almond milk and multigrain crackers
But overall it was tasty!

I was desperate for something to make so I put in ground turkey and butternut squash, thinking it was hopeless. I found this recipe first. I had already baked the squash, so I just cut it up and mixed it with the ground turkey. I used cream instead of milk, left out the butter and crumbs, and substituted Monterrey Jack for the mozzarella. I loved it, and so did my  husband.some of the kids did, too, but I wasn't quite as concerned if they liked it or not. I'll serve it with rice next time.

Could not imagine what these flavors would be like combined. Turned out to be a lovely sweet/savory combination. And easy preparation! Bought the precut squash from Trader Joes and cut them into smaller cubes.  Whole family liked it!

This was little more breakfasty tasting than I was expecting, but not bad. It’s a little bland, so could use some garlic or other preferable spices. Worth a try because I needed to use ingredients on hand, probably won’t make again. It was interesting.

I used ginger, curry and turmeric in the squash and turkey mixture. Also I used chicken broth instead of milk for dairy free version. It turned out great!

Just add vegi's as you see fit.  Any cheese will do.  I used the person's suggestion to use Almond flour mixed with spices and butter to replace the crackers to make this more carb friendly.

I made this tonight and it was delicious and easy to make.  I made it as written except I used a honey nut squash - a miniature, sweeter version of butternut.  I will definitely make it again.

Made with beef, Very tasty, but between the beef fat.and all the dairy fat in the eggs, milk, and cheese,  it was too rich for my tastes. Next time, lower fat turkey or beef, low fat milk, egg yolks, and low fat mozzarella.

I made this exactly and after taking it out I felt like it was a rather bland recipe. I ended up throwing in quite a few slices to salvage it. If I did it again I’d add more and perhaps a cheese besides mozzarella to give it more flavor.

No onion so I used red and green pepper. No mozzarella so I used 1/4 c. Italian blend and 3/4 c. Fat free Feta. The results were no less than spectacular. Super flavor, nice and firm. Gotta love butternut squash. This is a keeper. I would make it for company.

The recipe sounded so comforting that I had to have it...even though I didn't have the proper ingredients- so I substituted the turkey for chicken sausage and used a whole large butternut, also switched the crackers for a sesame cracker and it was still delicious, even better for lunch the next day.

I made it, my husband and I both loved it.  Made a few changes:  didn't have ground turkey on hand, but did have 2 cups of shredded leftover roast turkey in freezer, so i used that.  Didn't have to brown that, of course, so just sauteed the squash and onion, then stirred in the shredded turkey.   Substituted skim milk for the 1 percent, and it worked fine.  Had a bit more squash, so went to slightly larger pan.  This made 2 meals for the 2 of us.  Definitely a keeper, and great way to use up leftover turkey or chicken.

I used ground chicken because that’s what I had on hand. Also used saltines because that’s also what I had. We thought it was very good and I will make it again.

We LOVED this dish! I will admit, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but this recipe will definitely be on the repeat list. The adjustments I made were as follows: I did not add the extra butter to the sauce; I used a cheddar/Monterey jack cheese blend and also added some chiffonade-style kale; no crackers in the pantry, so I sprinkled the top of the casserole with bread crumbs.

Use what ya got. I used all, maybe 3 cups, of last year's squash, 1/8cup of sweet peppers and raw milk, fresh eggs.... I didn't have mozzarella so I used a bit of cheddar and some sweet white cheddar we had from Ireland. It's unbelievable how good this simple recipe was.

It was a tad rich for me, but I deviated on the ingredients. I think I'd try 3/4 cup butter next time all else being equal.

Other than using GF crackers because of Celiac, that was the only change I made.  GREAT recipe!  Very tasty and an easy way to use up leftovers from holiday.

I wound up cooking meat/onion/butternut squash for a total of 12 minutes to get squash tender enough(after cooking meat alone for 8 mins). Added fresh spinach to the skillet mixture and covered for another 3 minutes. Then put in the cheese mixture. This was a really savory casserole, perfect for fall! Next time will leave out the salt and add more spinach.

This was very good! I was loooking for a ground turkey recipe and also had some Butternut squash ready to cook so it worked beautifully!  I changed a few things, of course. I added some olive  tapenade from Trader Joes and changed the butter to coconut oil and it all was very tasty. I sure will make it again! Thanks for a quick, easy  & tasty idea.

I had to substitute a few things for lack of some of the "called for" ingredients in my kitchen...so, I didn't have a pound of ground turkey; but, I DID have two quarter pounder turkey patties (I figured: "as long as there is turkey in there").  I didn't have mozzarella cheese, but I DID have sharp white cheddar.  I only had "original" almond milk, too.  It turned out good.  Probably use mozzarella cheese and more turkey next time.
