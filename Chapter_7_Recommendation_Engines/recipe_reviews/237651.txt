I didnâ€™t want to loose the bubbles from the champagne, so I mixed the liqueurs first and then gently stirred in the champagne before pouring into the martini glass.  This made a lovely cocktail.

Tried this cocktail for Easter Sunday brunch instead of mimosas. It was delicious! Not too sweet, and a great use for champagne we didn't use during on New Years. I'd recommend putting the liqueurs in a shaker first, then topping off the drink with the champagne to keep the bubbles.
