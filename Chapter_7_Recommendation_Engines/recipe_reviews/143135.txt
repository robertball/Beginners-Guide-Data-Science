This was a big hit with the whole family.  I followed the recipe as it was - except... I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce & only about 3/4 Cup, instead of 1 1/2 Cups.
Excellent!

Probably the best BBQ beans I've ever made, but I added another can of beans, it had a very strong bbq flavor to it, and I usually like a very strong flavor, but this was a little too much even for me.

I only had a 14 oz can of beans and not enough bbq sauce, but the dish turned out very nicely anyway. My picky eater boys both devoured it, and hubby also enjoyed it. Not the prettiest dish, but delicious and family friendly.

Very good! I'd double the onion next time, because I love it and I think you almost can't have enough of them in baked beans :) My BBQ sauce and baked beans were both on the sweet side so I omitted the brown sugar and didn't miss it, though I'm sure that varies from brand to brand. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a tasty dish.  My family loved it and asked for 2nds and 3rds.  I did add hot peppers with the onions and 3 tsp of hot sause since my family likes spicy dishes.  Thank You so much for the recipe Yo-Yo.

Everyone should try this recipe!! Out of this world, and the best bean recipe I have ever eaten!!! AMAZING..I made few changes to it but used the rest of ingredient the same way. I used 2 lb Angus beef, and 1.5 {28 oz} Campbell Pork and Bean, I suggest to drain the liquid first before adding it to the beef if you want your recipe to be thicker & I used 15oz bottle of Sweet Sass BBQ sauce-garlic Fix from Busche"s market and it came out AMAZING I made it on Saturday one day before this Easter and on Easter day I put it in the crock pot an hour before serving on low and it thickened enough for me and everyone was raving and humming while they were eating it, so funny!! I am sooooo glad I found this recipe!! Thank you YoYo family for this delicious and rich recipe!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMEDED!!!
