Very healthy recipe! When I followed the recipe exactly however I found it rather bland. I found it helpful to replace the water with chicken broth and added various spices from my pantry in order to save it.

Not at all what I expected. Here's what I think I'll do next time: Make extra sauce and add whole-fat yogurt clarified butter (ghee) or cream. Might also substitute all or a portion of the above for ground cashews. I'll increase the amount of onion to two and also the amount of tomato. I'll up the amount of garam masala spice and skip the garbonzo beans. If I add anything more it will be the pul lentils or type used in toor dal -- these are the yellow legumes. I was surprized not to see lemon juice in this as it was a creamless masala.

Overall good recipe with a few changes. I omitted the garbanzo beans (didn't have any) and green bell pepper (don't like them). I added 1 15oz can of tomato sauce instead of the chopped tomato and only added about a half cup of water. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and finished the dish with fresh chopped cilantro (about 1 tbsp) and a splash of lime juice. I served it over brown rice. I think next time I will include the garbanzo beans and add even more tomato sauce/water.

I'm a carnivore by heart but I had tofu in my fridge and wanted to cook it up. I also had the rest of the ingredients so I was able to make a dish out of nothing. This was great for a veggie dish! I added a small cube chicken buillion and it was great!

I used olive oil instead of canola oil and later during the simmering process added two tblespoons of tomato paste because the sauce wasn't thickening up as I would have hoped. I also liberally sprinkled cayenne pepper over the simmering ingredients. Lastly I added several dashes of soy sauce for a little boost. Overall it was very good and I will make it again.

This came out really tasty! I used chicken broth instead of water and simmered it for 20 minutes to thicken the liquid a little more. I also ended up adding a bit of extra cumin cinnamon bay leaf and ginger because i only had 1 tbsp. of garam masala. It was a big hit very flavorful and pleasantly spicy (with a little bit of extra pepper)! Was great served over plain white rice!

I doubled the recipe and added 1 -28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I also substituted coconut milk for the water (14 oz). Topped with sesame seeds and scallions. 5 stars with my adjustments but only 3 stars as written

Pretty good! I had to make a few changes - I didn't have any chickpeas so used blackeyed peas (tasted great) and no fresh tomatoes so used some sundried that had a little Italian seasoning on them (was good too). Also did not add the additional TB of oil and no salt for health reasons. Very easy.

I changed a few things to make it my own and it still turned out great! Instead of firm tofu I used 1 package of TVP and I didn't have the masala so I used "all season" and curry powder instead. I would advise using a slighly less then 2 cups of water (I just drained the extra liquid out before serving). All in all a very good recipe that I will make again!

I found it to be tasty but after I altered the ingredients. Like one of the other users I substituted vegetable broth for the water added more Graham Masala (because I like to taste the spices strongly) and thickened it up with coconut cream at the end when it was simmering. The coconut cream also helped to sweeten it up just a bit as the masala is very bitter.

Garam masala spice can vary in flavor and strength and I found the 2 T. not enough flavor. Next time I will use broth instead of water and boost the heat with some cayenne pepper as another reviewer suggested. The sauce didn't look at all like the creamy red color in the picture so I will add some tomato paste next time as well.

I like the recipe in general but it needs another spice in addition to the garam masala to balance out the cinnamon/nutmeg flavor.

Great recipe which was easy to prepare and which we really enjoyed. We added just a tablespoon of tomato paste and used about 3/4 cup less water than called for just because I like thicker sauces. I will certainly make this again!

I doubled this recipe and used chicken broth instead of water. These were the ONLY changes that I made in the recipe and was very disappointed. Bland is an understatement. My kitchen had a wonderful smell from the pot as it cooked but the flavor was just not there. The family ate some of it but requested that we not have it again.

Made exactly according to recipe and served over Jasmine rice.  My husband likes his food spicy, so added a little red pepper flakes at the end.  If you donâ€™t have fresh tomatoes, use a can of diced.

Thank you for the recipe! For added flavor I substituted chicken broth for water (about 1 cup), added 15oz can no added salt diced tomatoes, splash of lime juice, and crushed red pepper flakes to taste. Delicious! My husband hates tofu...unless I make this recipe.

I give it 3 and half stars. I am a new vegitarian and not really used to eating tofu or many vegatable so this did dish did not make my taste buds sing but it wasnt bad either. Something to get used to tofu especially. I like the fact that its healthy. I followed the recipe almost completly I just added two papers instead of one. Cooking time was increased as well maybe 30 minutes more.

This was good. My family really liked it and said "You can make this again!" I started by making this exactly as written except I marinated the tofu in soy and teriyaki sauce and I used one can of diced tomatoes. Then it wasn't as saucey as I liked so I added an additional can of tomato sauce. Since that made it more volume I upped the garam masala some then tasted it and it seemed a little flat. (I cook without salt due to health reasons and I think salt would have fixed this) Noting the other reveiws I decided sour cream or yogurt would be a good addition but alas I had niether so added some cream and lemon juice. With these changes it was a Hit! I served it over white rice and I will definately make this again. Thank you for a great recipe.
