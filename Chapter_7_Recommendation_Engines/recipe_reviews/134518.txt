I halved this recipe, substituted the raspberries for blackberries and the mango and pomegranate juices for fresh squeezed orange juice.  It turned out simply amazing!  Make sure all the ingredients are super cold, if not frozen, to make this treat super great!

I thought this was delicious and refreshing!  To make it a bit frostier and thicker, I used frozen blueberries and one fresh mango instead of the mango juice, used nonfat yogurt instead of the milk, then thinned to desired consistency with a little soy milk.  Nice smoothie recipe to add to the collection! Thanks!

Delicious! I added a squeeze of lemon juice and also used just orange juice instead of the pomegranate and mango.

I only had cranberry-pomegranate juice on hand so I used 2/3 cup of that instead and it was fantastic!!  I highly recommend chilling the smoothie once blended to make it especially refreshing on a hot, summer day!

Nice combination of fruits. I omitted the honey and added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement strawberry flavor. I also used orange juice instead of promegranate juice because I didn't have any. Thanks Michalynn!

Delicious! I had to tweek it a little, I didn't have mango juice and instead of milk I used vanilla flavored pure coconut milk. It tastes great!

Great idea for breakfast. Been making this smoothie for a while, making variations on the recipe to change up the taste a little. Variety is the spice of life. As far as substitutions, this recipe is also good with frozen whole berries; saves on prep time. Also great with orange juice as substitution for the mango juice. Thanks for the idea.

I tried this without strawberries and used pomegranate-blueberry and peach-mango juice. I could easily finish the 2 servings myself, however it was not the thickness I'm used to, may add some ice or a frozen banana next time. Also had to constantly stir it because of separation.
