YUMM! Easter dinner for 12. Made exactly as written almost; subbed a round loaf of Hawaiian bread for the Challah ( it was cheaper than brioche and challah and listed as possible sub in my challah research). Subbed a little milk with cream too. Put together the day before and refrigerated until ready to bake next day.  Turned broiler on last 3 min at end to crisp the cheese  a bit.  Sooo good! The goat cheese is not overpowering said those who do not normally like goat cheese.  Will make again soon for a ladies' party.

Excellent! Half the ingredients (but keep spices @ same amount) is plenty for two.

I made this for Easter dinner and it went over really well. I would add more asparagus next time though. Otherwise it was great.

Delicious, but does take 2 bowls, a skillet and the baking dish!  I highly recommend for a special occasion!

Yum!  I made this recipe just as written only I cut the portion in half as it was just hubby and I.  It was delicious and even the leftovers heated up were good.  I'll definitely make this again.

Halved the recipe and substituted green onions plus clove of garlic. Fairly easy to make, but lots of dishes to do. Great flavor and delicious!
