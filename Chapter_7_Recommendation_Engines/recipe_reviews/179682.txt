Sounded really good, but its pretty bland. Something needs to be added to it, so keep that in mind, I'm sure it could be made into something really good.  PS - 125 grams is 1/2 cup :)

I thought this recipe sounded really good! I'm not sure if I did something wrong but the cream cheese stayed chunky. My boyfriend asked if there was cottage cheese in it! Not very appealing... Will not make again!

I made a few tweaks. I used olive oil for the chicken and I had a sun dried tomato and garlic pesto mix that I cooked the chicken in. I added onions to that. I only used 1 3/4c cup milk and added 1/4c sherry. Then instead of parmesan cheese I used 1/2c ahredded Italian cheese blend. My family loved it!

This was very good but it could use a little more seasoning.  I used half butter and half olive oil to cook the chicken and I seasoned the chicken with chicken fajita seasoning.  I used one cup fat free half and half and one cup 2% milk.  I didn't have any Parmesan cheese but I had a three cheese blend that has Parmesan, Romano and Asiago in it.  I added a dash of garlic powder but I forgot to add salt and pepper and I think that that made the difference.  I will most definitely be making this again.  I served it with homemade whole wheat spaghetti.

After reading a few reviews, I took the advice and came up with my own version. I used extra virgin olive oil, cut up partially frozen chicken it was easier to cut up this way. I added 4 cloves of crushed garlic, mushrooms (4-7 sliced), sea salt (a little goes a long way), sprinkle of Italian seasoning, and pepper. Cooked all of this on medium then low heat in one pan, drained the remaining olive oil and added cheese sauce with the chicken and mixed for about a minute just to warm the sauce and coat the chicken and mushrooms. Added the mixture to the already drained noodles. I used egg noodles by the way.  Family loved it and it's now on my list of family favorites. To my plate, I dashed on some crushed red pepper for a little spice.

My husband loved this! I did add a heavy sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and pepper. A smidge less milk and 2 tbs of butter. I kept it simple without the pesto and bell peppers, and seasoned the chicken with a little cajun powder. DELISH!

My fiance and I just finished eating this and it was delicious! We took the suggestions below and added some chopped garlic. I am a picky eater and he will eat anything but is rarely impressed with what he eats and we both said we'd make this again.

I was worried when the cheese started clumping, but I kept heating/stirring and it smoothed out.  The dish turned out pretty well, but my sauce was a tad bit on the bland side =/.  Maybe I'll try adding more pesto or some pepper/garlic next time.

My husband and I liked this.  I used frozen grilled chicken and cooked it in the microwave so it was pretty convenient to make.  Also used whole wheat thin spaghetti which was good and also alot healthier :)  Next time I will add more philly cheese.

I like it but it needs salt and pepper. I also sauteed some onions, mushrooms and garlic along with the chicken. Will make again but will add seasonings per our preference.

My boyfriend and I liked this very much. We made a few changes but not much.. I added more cream cheese and some tomatoes. I also added season salt and minced garlic to flavor the chicken. Neither him nor I am a fan of pesto so we omitted it. He said it was in the top 10 of recipes he liked and he's a very picky eater

Great recipe, but I added mushrooms and onions, aslo used herb philly cheese instead of the plain cream cheese, needed some salt and pepper. Definately will make this again.

I think I agree with everyone else about this being a bland dish. Perhaps some seasoning like garlic salt would make it taste better.  Also, I couldn't find any pesto sauce so I used tomato sauce instead, it was really good! Since I didn't think of any seasoning to use, I just used salt and pepper, and it ended up tasting good.  I cooked it for a bit longer than mentioned, I cooked for an extra 10 minutes to make the sauce thicker, so that may help.

It was good but kinda bland..... next time I think I would spice the chicken while cooking and maybe add some more veggies? It was a good base and I will try it out again but with a few tweaks!

Not my favorite.  It definitely needed more flavor and was very runny, so I tried adding a little flour to thicken it up.  It was good enough to eat, but not something I'd likely make again.

Very good recipe! I topped it off with chopped green onions and that really added to the flavor. I may double the cream cheese next time but it was very good as it was.

Used raw chicken and cooked in in garlic pesto; Instead of spaghetti I used Gamelli noodles, parmesano regianno mixed with half of the cream cheese and 1 cup of heavy cream along with Roasted Bell Peppers cut up!  I also added thawed Asparagus from Schwanns!
Then I baked in in the oven for about 1/2 hour!
