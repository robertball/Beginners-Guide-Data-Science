Well this isn't much of an actual recipe, but hey its *GREAT* idea if you're lady!!!ehehehe But you could spice it up by putting some marichino cherries in the cake as well if you DON'T have a Heart Shaped pan and DON'T care to fork out the dough to get one here's a *simple* way to make a heart shaped cake instead!!! 

What you need:

One square shaped pan&one round pan the 9x9(I think)and try to devide evenly. Then when its done just cut the circle in 1/2 and line the halves with the corners of the square(so the square looks like a diamond, then it will look exactly like a heart[unless you cut the circle unevenly!!!mwahahahaha])So there you go, yes, I have done this and it worked great!!!Could use only ol' cake recipe for it don't really matter!!!

God Bless ~Amy
