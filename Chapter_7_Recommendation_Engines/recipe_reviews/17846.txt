This was pretty tasty.  Instead of using frozen noodles, I used dried noodles with an extra can of broth.  It was ok but I think next time I will either try to find the frozen or cook the noodles separately before adding them to the mix.  My husband was very skeptical about trying this but was impressed.

This recipe was SURPRISINGLY delicious considering its simplicity.  My husband loved it, and even asked that it be added to our "regular rotation".  I used regular packaged egg noodles rather than frozen, which turned out great, and I believe required less cooking time.  I recommend adding a bit of fresh cracked black pepper, it really enhanced the flavor considerably.  The only semi-complaint about this recipe is that it does not "keep" or reheat very well at all, but with food this flavorful, if you have a hungry family to feed, leftovers will not be an issue.

Incredibly easy & good!  This went over without a problem, (well until my daughter noticed the mushroom pieces from the soup).  I used a 12 oz. box of Barilla egg noodles (eggless abc's for allergic baby) and it was perfect.  Next time I'll add some broccoli & carrot strips.  Thanks Tammy!

This is my recipe and everytime I make it, I remember how good it is.  It is real comfort food. This is thick and creamy and comes out perfect everytime.  It is great for a pot-luck dinner or to take to a sick friend also.

Great recipe!

My changes:

To reduce sodium and fat used 2 (10.75 oz.) cans Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Chicken and 1 (10.75 oz.) can Campbells Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom. Used Swansens Natural goodness chicken broth.

Used Reame's noodles- the 12 oz. packages really soak up the broth so added a 4th can of chicken broth.

Added freshly ground black pepper, although white would be better.

Easy & yummy meal.  I cooked the meal for 20 minutes, adding frozen carrots after about 7 minutes.  I also used dry noodles that I boiled separately for 5 minutes and then added to the mixture during the last 5 minutes of cook time.  My entire family liked it, even my very very picky 3 year old!!  Definitely a keeper. :-)

Just made this last night as it was very cold out and this was a perfect meal for the weather.  I had not noticed your own review and revision of this meal, however, until just now.  I was going to say that dried, packaged egg noodles are not the way to go but you have already corrected it with saying we need frozen egg noodles and that is very important.  I also needed more soup so they really should change this recipe as it is printed.  I just printed it out without noticing your adjustments and they are very necessary.  I needed it creamier, also, but will just adjust everything next time I make it.  I will also cut back on the amount of noodles used.  This was a bit much as this amount feeds much more than six, more like 8 to 10.  But it was wonderfully easy and very delicious flavor.  My entire family really liked it but we ran short on the "juice", as my little ones call it.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I bought a fresh rotisserie chicken from the deli counter at the grocery and stripped all the meat off of it. I couldn't find frozen noodles so I cooked thick Amish homestyle noodles for ten minutes, drained them and added them to the chicken mixture and cooked it all until the noodles were done. Served it over mashed potatoes. Really good comfort food!

A very good recipe, but I found that I needed to cook the noodles quite a bit longer (total simmering closer to 45 minutes) to get the level of doneness that I expected.  I used Reames brand frozen noodles.  We will make this again - thanks for the good recipe.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN TONIGHT. THIS CERTAINLY WARMS YOU UP ON A CHILLY NIGHT! HAVING MADE THIS TWO TIMES NOW, I HAVE LEARNED A FEW TRICKS TO MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER. TO REITERATE, BE SURE TO USE FROZEN EGG NOODLES (I.E. REAMS BRAND). THEY ARE AN ABSOLUTE MUST! SECOND, IN ORDER FOR YOUR SAUCE TO THICKEN NICELY, SIMMER FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES (I HAD TO SIMMER MINE FOR 40 MINUTES TO REACH A DESIRABLE CONSISTENCY). THIRD, ADD A TEASPOON OF GROUND CELERY SEED (IT ADDS A LITTLE OOMPH). FINALLY, THIS IS DIVINE SERVED OVER GARLIC MASHED POTATOES. TOTAL COMFORT FOOD!!! :) Not bad. While I liked this, I prefer my chicken and dumpling recipe a tad better (but it slow cooks all day so I have to plan ahead for it). Having said this, for a meal that is ready in less than an hour, I can't be too picky. :) Other than adding fresh cracked pepper (to taste), this is flavorful and in need of no major tweaking. NOTES: I used a 16 oz. bag of Ream's brand frozen egg noodles and am glad I did. They MAKE this dish. I think this would not have been nearly as good had I subbed plain 'ol egg noodles. As leedeeree did, I too cooked my chicken in seasoned simmering broth for 15 minutes, chopped it, added BACK to my broth and continued as directed. Served with a Caesar salad and biscuits, this was a warming meal on this chilly winter day. Thanks for sharing, Tammy! :-)

With the addition of a lot more seasonings, this is a really quick and easy dinner for those, "must run the kids around" evenings. We really liked it!

Great soup! I made a few changes. First, I used one can each of condensed cream of chicken, mushroom, and celery soups.  Then the 3 cans of chicken broth, plus a couple partially defrosted chicken breast and seasonings (including fresh-pressed homegrown garlic and black pepper), all tossed in the crockpot on low for approximately 4 hours. Then I added the defrosted noodles and turned the crockpot up to high for about an hour, with a sprig of rosemary tossed in too.    The smell was amazing, though I found the taste a little bland.  My guy liked it and didn't mind, so he took home most of the leftovers.  We served this with homemade biscuits. :)  I would make this dish again with slight improvisations.

This was really, really good and so easy! We used low sodium/healthy request soups and low sodium stock and added 1 low sodium chicken cube. Everyone loved it and this will be a regular in our home. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and yummy!  I made it in a slow cooker.  I used all of the meat from a rotisserie chicken (ended up being about 4 cups) and my two packages of frozen egg noodles were 12 ounces each (and I used them all).  I kept all other ingredients the same. Great consistency -- not too runny/brothy, but enough "gravy" to serve on top of mashed potatoes without being too dry.  I used lower-sodium chicken broth.  Will definitely make again!

This is literally the BEST chicken noodle soup I've ever had.  My husband LOVED it, too.  If you have a craving for homemade chicken noodle soup, with thick, substantial noodle and shredded chicken, try this recipe.

PS:  Regarding the chicken, I boiled three large boneless, skinless breastes and then shredded it for the recipe.  Awesome.

I'm not a fan of the mushroom soup but my boyfriend is so I wanted to try this recipe. Usually I just use cream of chicken. After I added the mushroom soup I felt like it ruined the flavor so I did everything I could to hide it. I used every last drop of cream of chicken, added lots of onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. I also added about 3/4 cup of chicken stock b/c I wanted to keep a more creamy base. I boiled 3 large handfulls of dry egg noodles and baked all together on 350 for 30 min. After all....my bf said it was the best he's every had. Served with cheese garlic bread. . .turned out to be a pretty good meal.

very good. I made it exactly as printed, and the kids loved it. This is very easy to prepare. BUT you cannot add the frozen noodles to the pot without defrosting them as instructed on the noodle package. The recipe just says "add noodles...." They must be defrosted first. This would be great over mashed potatoes, or eaten alone on a cold winters day. I served it with homemade bread and it made a simple hearty meal.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have any cream of chicken so I just used chicken broth and cream of mushroom.  I added some milK and flour to thicken it up a little.  I also doubled the onion and garlic.  It was excellent!

Yum, yum!  I threw this together in the crock pot in a hurry, used 3 frozen chicken breasts and one extra can of cream of chicken soup (we like our chicken and noodles creamy).  I also added about a cup and a half of diced onion and about a teaspoon of black pepper.  Cooked it all on high for 3 hours, then removed the chicken, shredded it and returned it to the crock pot.  I dumped in a bag of uncooked Amish noodles, let it all cook on high for another hour then served it over mashed potatoes.  Fantastic and definitely tasted like I had worked on it all day versus throwing everything in and walking away!  We will definitely be having this again and again.  :)

This was really good! I added black pepper into the mixture as it was heating together and then I cooked the egg noodles separately and added towards the end of the cooking time. I also threw in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (peas, corn, green beans, lima beans), which were good additions. We give it up two thumbs up!

Overall, very quck and yummy dish.  Was a little salty for my taste, so I will try and use the lower sodium versions of the condensed soups and seasonings.  Will definitely keep this recipe though.

I've made this recipe 3 times now. The only changes I made was to add some sliced carrets. The best thing is if there are leftovers I put them in a carrsole dish, toss some cheese on top and bake until the cheese is melted and bubble. So good.

This was not bad, but it tasted like soup out of a can (if you don't mind that, you will probably really like this).  There wasn't really anything fresh about it.  I was disappointed.

This was very quick, easy and tasteful.  I possibly would have given it 4 stars, because I would not consider it restaurant quality, but my kids LOVED it, which doesn't happen often.  Oh - and I used bow tie pasta instead of noodles, cooked them separate, and added them 3/4 of the way through doneness.  They were great in it.

So yummy!  When I think of chicken and noodles this is what I think of.  Thanks for sharing.  I made with all low fat low sodium soups and broth. Added frozen peas during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I will definitely make this again.

I am re-reviewing this because it came out MUCH better the second time I made it. The key for me was to let it simmer an extra 15 minutes. I'm not sure why that made so much of a difference in the flavor, but I'm glad it did! Cheese lovers: try substitiuting cheddar cheese soup for the cream of mushroom, it's delicious that way!

I used dry egg noodles instead of frozen. I boiled them first. I cooked the chicken in a skillet in olive oil with poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Then I shredded it and mixed with the drained noodles. Everything else about the recipe I kept pretty much the same. I also seasoned the soup with some parsley and thyme, and some salt and pepper. It was easy enough, and also good.

Awesome!  I used a fryer chicken seasoned with butter and I didn't have cream of chicken but used cream of celery instead and used garlic instead of the powder and it turned out perfect.  I added pepper, too.  My family loved it.  I'm adding it to my list of favorite recipes.

I agree with the recipe being too salty as is.  I would use low sodium broth next time and maybe even one low sodium soup.  Lawry's seasoned salt worked well.  I used regular dried egg noodles, cooked for 5 minutes on their own and about 10-15 minutes with the mixture.  Delicious! I served mine with broccoli, which also tasted good mixed in. And I also enjoyed the leftovers!

Easy and tasty both! I like chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes, this recipe doesn't leave your taters watered down with broth :) Have used a roasted chicken bought from the deli and chicken breasts baked at 350 for 35 minutes, turned out great both times. I subbed a teaspoon of minced garlic for the powder & used fresh ground pepper. My husband asked me to throw out my old recipe that uses just broth :)

This is a favorite staple meal in our house. I use the small dried Kluski noodles and a large family size cr of chicken soup can. I use plenty of seasonings esp when cooking the chicken. My family also likes it "juicy". This will warm up well but you must add water to it. I serve mashed potatoes to increase the carb count!! ;-)

Yes, it kinda has the canned soup taste (a little bit), but you are using canned soup! To me, it is not at all unpleasant. This is the most delicious chicken and noodles I've ever made.  Not bland at all- just the right amount of seasoning.  I am mexican, I do not like bland- this was great! Making it again tonite!

Delicious comfort food! I used dry egg noodles - I cooked them for ~4-5 minutes, then brought the sauce to a boil, added them in, and let it simmer until the noodles were done. It was probably soupier than if I had cooked them together but quite delicious.  I eyeballed the chicken and used three chicken breasts.  I'm a college student so I made a big batch to eat later. A bowl reheated from the fridge tastes great! I was worried because another review said this recipe doesn't keep, but I think the leftovers taste great. I haven't yet tried the portions I froze.

Super simple. This is the easiest chicken and noodles I have ever made. I made this for hubby to take to work for their Thanksgiving feast. I didn't sample it, but both my son and husband had a bowl and this got a thumbs up here. Thanks for such a great easy recipe! I'll be using this again for our holiday dinners! I used store brand soups, about 3 cups chicken since I had 3 small breasts to cook up and then half celery salt and half seasoned salt as directed. I couldn't find the frozen egg noodles here, our grocery only carried the flat dumplings by the same manufacturer (they were 12 oz. I still used two and added some more broth) and it still turned out just like hubby wanted. Thanks!!!

What a great, hearty dinner! My kids ate it well, which felt like a miracle. I used healthy request soups and whole grain egg noodles (dry) so it was pretty healthy. I didn't have to change the recipe instructions to use dry noodles. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  Easy and my kids loved it.  I did substitute dry noodles instead of the frozen.  I cooked them most of the way through, and then added them to the sauce and cooked for appx. 5 minutes. Delicious!

Umph, I don't see where there are any corrections to this recipe and there are reviews indicating Tammy posted them.  To get this thick you need to use frozen egg noodles (Reames) instead of dried.  If you are simmering this on low, you should allow 45 minutes to an hour for the noodles to be done.  I've been looking for a recipe like this that my mother made and this is it.  (I think she only used 2 10.75 cans of soup-whatever was on hand, and 4 cups water with bouilion cubes).

This recipe is the best and easiest Chicken & Noodle recipe I've ever found.  I've made it several times already.  

I generally use chicken tenders instead of regular breast meat (since they are more tender), plus I usually brown the chicken and simmer it in garlic and onion.  Then I slice the chicken up, and add it (along with the garlic and onion) to the soup mixture.  I prefer using more noodles (since I like my chicken and noodles to be a little thicker).
I try to make this whenever I have people over because everyone thinks it took me all day to make when in reality it only takes about 30-40 minutes!!  Thank you Tammy for the great recipe!!

One of the best chicken and noodles recipes I've ever tried! I've made one before on here with a slow cooker and it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. This was great!!! I boiled 2 chicken breasts and shredded them for the chicken in the recipe. Good stuff!!! Thanks so much Tammy...this was wonderful!!!!

I substituted another can of cream of chicken for the mushroom, as we don't care for mushroom flavor.  It was really good the first time around, but doesn't reheat well.  It is pasty and sticky as leftovers.  I also had to cook it longer (close to an hour) so the noodles would be done.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make.  It was also very good. I used broth from the cooked chicken to replace 2 of the cans of broth. Even with the lower sodium from my own broth ( I used no salt on the chicken) my husband and I thought it was too salty.  Next time I make it I will use less soup and add some milk instead.  Then it will be perfect for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to make.  I cooked one chicken breast and used the liquid as a substitute for 2 cans of the chicken broth.  I also added some water after the noodles were added because I thought it was a little too thick.  My husband thought it was great!  It made more than the six servings it stated - more like 8 to 10 servings.

I really liked this recipe...next time I think I will not use all the noodles and use another can of soup. I think it was wonderful but I would like it better if it were creamier.

This a fantastic recipe and almost as good as the cook-all-day-homemade-egg-noodle version!  DO NOT substitute dried noodles for the frozen egg noodles or you will not have that fabulous consistency and flavor.  I used 2 12-oz packages of Reames' frozen egg noodles and it turned out great with the same consistency my Great grandmother and Great Aunts always got.  I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded the breast meat which made it super easy and super tasty!  Thanks for a terrific down-home recipe!!

Yum yum yum yum yum. I used a "sticky rotisserie chicken" recipe for the chicken used in this recipe and it was to die for. Completely hit the comfort food spot. Makes a ton. Serve over smashed tatoes for feeding a large crowd. Delicious!!

Very good "from scratch" recipe for chicken and noodles.  I used a 26 oz. bag of frozen egg noodles and it worked out just fine.  Next time I would simmer the noodles 5-10 minutes longer for a total of 40 minutes and maybe add 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great, easy recipe that my kids love!  I make it whenever I have leftover rotisserie chicken, and I just use regular (dry) egg noodles instead of frozen ones.

I used one can cr. of mushroom soup, 2 cups chix broth and cooked the noodles seperately then added them.  I also used a lot more garlic powder and about a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I cut back and used about 1/2 of the noodles, too.

Fantastic! I typed the ingredients in I had on hand (that was about ALL I had,lol), this recipe came up-perfect. It was  quick, easy and very tasty.  I added a little milk when it stated ccoking down, I also agree with others-use (Reames) frozen noodles. I made mashed potatoes and cresent rolls (the other things I had) and had quick comfort food for Sunday afternoon football watching.

This was super easy. I followed directions exactly and it ended up really salty. I normally use a lot of salt so it is bad for me to say that! Overall, the flavor is pretty good but I would recommend low sodium broth and soup if you make this. I probably won't be making this again.

OK so this was good very easy to make and a great comfort food. I made a few changes as well as took advice from other comments. First I used my own chicken broth and used the leftover chicken from the simple whole roasted chicken recipe. Second I used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom. I did add a small can of sliced mushrooms and frozen carrots.  I used 1tsp.fresh ground pepper and served the dish over ultra creamy mashed potatoes.

My family and friends loved this...my 8 year old was asking for it again 2 days after it was gone. Changes I made: When I poached my chicken, I used a lot of seasonings; poultry, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and season salt. When finished, I used the water from poaching to make my own broth using boullion cubes. I also used home made frozen noodles....I will definately make this again and it will become a staple in our house. I have a friend that made hers with Amish dried noodles from the store and less seasonings; it was good as well.

REALLY good!  Instead of cream of mushroom, i did cream of celery.  Plus, I boiled the chicken with diced onion, carrots, celery and parsley.  My picky 4 year old LOVED this dish.

This was fantastic! The only thing I did was to add more chicken and more noodles, and to let it simmer for about 35-40 minutes.  Yum! I will definitely be making this again!

I used 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup and no cans of cream of mushroom soup. I also shredded the chicken instead of dicing. This tasted just like my grandma's chicken and noodles. It was good and not expensive to made. This is a real good recipe.

Really pretty good (more like 3.5 stars) and also a very quick and easy winter time comfort meal (Reason I gave it 4).  I cut the recipe in half as I was only cooking for two - and there was still enough leftover for lunch the next day. It is a little on the "canned soup" taste side but overall not that bad.  Im sure you can doctor it a bit to help mask that flavor.  I used hard noodles and boiled for 5 minutes (al dente) and added them and they came out fine.  I also wish I had gone with my first instincts and used a bit more chicken.  This would be a great quick meal if you got a rotisserie chicken from the deli and used that - the added flavor would be welcomed.   Very happy though and will make this a keeper for winter meals.

I made this using a whole chicken.  Boiled it, saved the broth for the recipe and shredded the chicken.  I also added fresh baby carrots when I added the noodles.  Was very good but I think a little more spices/seasonings would have made it better.

My mom gave me a similar recipe and I couldn't get ahold of her, so I used this.  I would definitely cook the noodles before adding them into the mix...they seem to take forever to cook!  Other than that, delicious.

My husband and children thought this was the best thing since sliced bread.  My husband even wants it again tomorrow night.  In over a decade of marriage, he's never said that before!

I thought this was OK.  I just didn't care for the flavor that the canned soups brought - they overpowered it.  Sorry

This was really easy to make, but tasted a little too much like the cream of chicken soup. My children really liked it.

My family LOVED this!  I used 2 chicken breasts, diced and boiled them before adding to the liquids.  I cut back slightly on the seasoning salt.  My husband has already asked for this again!

I thought this recipe was delicious. I am very health consious and was able to tweak a few things and it still was wonderful.  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom soup. I also used 100% fat free chicken broth with reduced sodium. I used the idea on here to cook the noodles first and that worked out great. I have a ton left over and my fiance loved it:)

very tasty! I made my own broth; added carrots and celery from the broth as well.  A little on the "thin" side, but would certainly make this again.

Did not use cream of mushroom.  Added one can of broth.  Used pot pie/dumpling noodles that I cooked in the broth.  Mixed all the other ingredients and added that to the noodles/broth.  I also added a small bag of peas with carrots.  Too easy.  Nice comfort food over mashed potatoes on a cold day here in Ohio.

Good, basic recipe. I decreased the amount of seasoned salt and added some basil and parsley. I also added quite a bit of ground black pepper as I like a peppery flavor. Finally, I chopped up some carrots and threw them in. The night I made this it was like creamy chicken noodle soup, but the leftovers were the consistency of a pasta dish. Tasty either way, but something to be aware of if you plan to eat the leftovers.

Super simple recipe! Very creamy and delish. I was looking for a quick and easy chicken and noodles recipe, and this one was a HIT! I bought a package of Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Tenderloins on sale for $2.50 and used a 24 oz. bag of Reams Egg Noodles, and they turned out PERFECT....and surprisingly inexpensive. Next time, I may add some celery and/or carrots for something different, but these were great as is. I added extra chicken broth as needed for desired consistency due to the extra noodles.  Some people mentioned they don't keep well, but for leftovers, I heated with a bit of water and they went right back to the creamy delicious goodness from the night before.  I served over home made mashed potatoes, and my family loved them.

This was a very delicious recipe my mom and I loved it I will definitely make this again. I used 4 chopped chicken breast instead of the of the diced chicken I might used the canned chicken next time. I also used the flat frozen noodles instead of egg noodles. It tasted just like chicken and dumplings!

I loved this chicken noodle recipe! I was looking for a creamy noodle recipe to put over mashed potatoes and this was perfect! I was feeling lazy the day I made this so I bought a rotisserie chicken and just pulled it apart and used it. The whole meal was ready in about 20 minutes using this method and it tasted great! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

We really loved this dish. I did not have a large can of the cream of chicken soup: used two 10.75 and one of the cream of celery (not a mushroom fan), and for our tastes it was perfectly creamy. I used raw cubed chicken breast instead of precooked, and the small chunks in boiling liquid were cooked through just fine after the 20 minutes. I also used a 16oz bag of dried egg noodles and thus added an extra can of broth. I don't think the recipe needed the extra liquid just for the dry noodles (especially if I had used all the cream soup in there), but as I also tossed in a 16oz frozen bag of mixed veggies it turned out OK. We loved the veggies (my boyfriend requested extra the next time in fact) but as written without them the recipe is good too, especially if you plan to serve roasted or grilled vegetables along with it (which is in the cards for us). Given how simple and quick this is I think the taste is amazing - five stars well deserved! Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe is very good. I mis-read the quantity on the cream of chicken soup so I used two small can's, and 2 small can's of cream of mushroom instead. It still turned out perfectly. I had dry egg noodles on hand so I used them instead of the frozen ones, and they worked out well. I will definitely make this recipe again. It is also easy on the wallet. :)

I make this every once and a while, because my husband loves it. Sometimes I'll change it up and use cheddar cheese soup. It's good with a couple handfuls of cheese thrown in, sauteed onions and chopped broccoli. It's one of those casseroles you can basically use what's in your pantry or throw in whatever leftover meat or vegetables you've got 
from earlier that week.

MUST USE FROZEN EGG NOODLES!  This was a great comfort food.  I must disagree with an earlier reviewer who said this didn't keep.  My husband and I both ate the leftovers for lunch the next day-and my husband does not usually eat leftovers!

This is pretty good! I only had about 5 oz of dry egg noodles. I also reduced the soups to only one can of cream of chicken, and 1 1/2 cans broth. Simmered about 18 minutes. I also left out the chicken because I just really had a craving for noodles. Came out great! Really good comfort food! Will have again!  :)

This was very good - I doubled the recipe for a pitch-in and it made a TON!!!  I think the frozen noodles are an absolute MUST and it did need to cook a bit longer than indicated in the recipe to get the noodles all the way cooked.  I also added a bag of frozen peas and carrots during the last 10 minutes or so of cooking.  It thickened up and tasted even better the next day!

I have looked for a recipe close to grandmas and this is it!  Didn't have frozen noodles so I used regular egg noodles and it turned out great.  I just add them to the mixture to let them cook. It has become a family favorite!

This was good. I used more cream of chicken and less broth, so it was a bit thicker and heavier. It was good for a cold autumn day. It was a bit salty for my tastes, but no one else seemed to mind. Very easy to make!

I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 3, both white and dark meat from a rotiserie chicken that I got at the grocery deli, and a good quality and thicker cut of (dry) Amish noodles that I cooked al dente before adding them to the sauce/chicken mixture.  Was very pleased with the result, particluarly considering that it was only 30 min from start to finish.  If it were just me, I'd saute some carrot, celery, and onion and throw those in, but the kids would have just picked them out enyway.

This was very good. I didn't use frozen noodles.  Instead I put all of the sauce ingred. in a saucepan to get it very hot. I boiled the noodles in a seperate pot, in water and chx bouillon cubes (since I wasn't boiling them in the sauce).  I didn't cook them the whole way.  Then I poured out the broth and added the sauce from the other pot.  Simmered and used cornstarch to thicken.  Tasty and makes a lot!

Incredibly easy to make and delicious. The whole family loves it, including our picky toddler. Update: I have been using the recipe for 5 years now and we all still love it.  This is the dish I make when making meals for new moms and housebound seniors. Everyone ends up asking me for the recipe!  I'm happy to share it!

This dish was WAY too salty for me.  I did not have low-sodium soup on hand so that might have helped but if you're sensitive to salt then this is probably not the dish for you.  I added some milk and then thickened w/ cornstarch but it was still way too soupy.  My husband and family thought it was good.  I wouldn't make it again.

I’m currently making this for the third time because it’s rainy and hailing outside, which calls for comfort food. The only change I make is to eliminate the mushroom soup, and replace it with another can of Cream of Chicken. Additionally, I use 2-10oz cans of Valley Fresh white meat chicken, and  I did add some seasoned pepper. The hard part is waiting for the frozen noodles to bulk up the dish! Thanks for an incredibly easy pot of goodness! (p.s.I recommend the thickness of  Reames Frozen Egg Noodles, or Grandma's; Aiello's weren't much different from dried noodles.

While not a "masterpiece" (I mean, c'mon... it's chicken and noodles!), this was really very good for a quick weeknight meal! I admit I made it my own and changed it up a bit.... I have made some similar variations of this recipe in the past that turned out quite bland, so I thought I'd ramp it up by starting with finely diced celery, onions, garlic and chopped mushrooms, which I sautéed in butter and olive oil to add flavor. So good! To this mixture, I tossed in some frozen peas and carrots for a one-pot meal. I also added a couple Tbsp of cream cheese to the hot mixture once simmering, along with a teaspoon of sour cream and a splash of milk for added creaminess. My husband and boys loved it and asked to keep it on the regular! Thanks for a tasty and easy meal idea! ??

Yummy! Very much like Grandma's (though her noodles were always homemade).

Here's an alternative for thicker consistency and no precooking the chicken: 

Boil 16 ounces of frozen noodles in water OR chicken broth (your choice) – stop just before noodles are real tender; drain most of the broth or water into a bowl for use if needed later.

Add 2 or 3 – 10½ ounce cans of condensed Cream of Chicken soup and/or Cream of Mushroom soup (kids tend to prefer just the Cream of Chicken – your choice). Stir in 2 cans and judge consistency; add more as desired. You may also want to add a can after judging consistency with chicken added next.

Add 2 to 4 –13 oz. CANS of drained and thoroughly rinsed, fully cooked chicken breast (“Daily Chef” brand from SAM's Club for example). Amount of chicken depends on personal choice. 

Rinse in a strainer to break up chicken chunks into even smaller pieces as desired, this makes sure there's chicken in every bite.

Season to taste and slowly add broth/water saved earlier to thin consistency as desired.

OPTION: for more nutrition, add 1 or 2 small cans of mixed vegetables (like peas and carrots) – again, your choice (gets the kids to eat their veggies!). Even small pieces of cooked cauliflower will work!

Simmer, stirring frequently, for a minimum of 20 minutes.

I'm confused, I've seen 3 reviewers reference the edits or changes that Tammy, the original poster made, but I only find one review comment by Tammy just saying how good it is. Have the edits been made to the original recipe now? I get that you should only use frozen egg noodles, the nice and thick ones, and longer cooking time, maybe more broth. Anything else?  Thanks! I'm making this this weekend for 12. Also considering preparing ahead of time and keeping in crock pot on warm.

This was very good, but as someone previously stated...way too salty for our taste. My advice is to not add any salt in the pot....I made my own noodles from scratch so even less salt there.  Excellent except for the salty taste...and I DIDNT add the season salt! I boiled my chicken breasts with onion and celery making my own broth, still again less salt...must be the soups?

If your looking for an easy chicken recipe this is pretty good, but I thought that it had that soup taste.  I made this last week and it was all eaten, and I will keep the recipe but it will be a while before I make it again.

I usually prefer completely homemade chicken dishes. However I remember my great grandma making a chicken and noodle dish and this is very close. I added thyme and turmeric then omitted the onion powder.  Hubby loves it so it's going to be a new meal for us

Just made this for a crowd, cut down on salt though as the chicken broth has plenty, and I'm a salt aholic! I always have to play with every recipe and I added whipping cream and used Reames frozen noodles.

Very easy and fast.  I think the whole recipe depends on the type of noodles you use.  I did use frozen noodles, but only one bag and that was enough noodles for my family.  I did not use the cream of mushroom soup because of my picky little one, but did use all cream of chicken.  This was comforting and good.  Of course it tastes like canned soup because that is what I used.  I did add a little celery seed for a bit more flavor.  Still a warm, quick weeknight meal.

The name doesn't lie.  Couldn't be any easier.  I started by sauteeing an onion and 2 stalks of celery, then added everything else.  I used the lg can cr of chicken, and then 1 sm can ea. cream of mushroom and cream of celery.  Reduced broth to 1 "box".  Didn't have the frozen noodles, so partially cooked the bag of no yolks in my pantry and tossed them in.  This worked out fine, and having used less broth/more "cream of" soup as a base made the outcome a perfect consistency.  Chopped up a bag of frozen Rotisserie Seasoned chicken breast strips and threw in some frozen peas at the end.  Very easy and yummy.

I don't normally do reviews, but this was SO good I had to.  Didn't change anything really, just omitted the seasoning salt and onion powder (didn't have any) and it came out PERFECT.  Working on my third bowl for the night!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this recipe!

Delicious and so easy! I used dried noodles, so I  cooked them in the broth I had from cooking the chicken for half the time indicated on the package before adding to the soup mixture.

Yum! This is comfort food to the max. This was delicious and made a lot - had plenty leftover for lunch the next day. This was very easy to put together (just as the recipe name says) and I loved the one-pot aspect - throw everything in and heat. I think the dish would be perfectly delcious as-is but I did make a few additions.  Sliced carrots and celery, some chicken base and poultry seasoning, and once the noodles were cooked I added a cup of half-and-half to make it rich and creamy.  We'll definitely have this again.  Thanks, Tammy, for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is not bad, but I'll never make it again; and it was quite expensive to make. Next time, I'll go with a good recipe from scratch.

I had twice as much chicken.  The sauce was too salty for my tastes.
I will try this recipe again...but I will either reduce the amount of liquid or double the noodles.
I am thinking
3 c. chicken
3 9oz pkgs Reames noodles
14-15 oz chicken stock
14 oz water
same soup, same spices

Perfect comfort food! I had some leftover chicken to use and this recipe was perfect! Used packed egg noodles instead of frozen and it worked out fine. Also added 1/2 c. frozen corn and peas. Hubby and kids loved it! I will be adding this to the rotation for the winter. :)

Great comfort food - incredibly easy...used rotisserie chicken from the grocery deli and frozen 
Reames noodles to make this a quick meal. Perfect for cool weather or when you're feeling under the weather.

This was delicious! I made dumplings and added them... made an amazing Chicken and Dumplings. :) Also added some Rosemary, Thyme, and Sage, to taste. I think they added a lot to the recipe. Overall, delicious.

This was delicious, your modern take on chicken and noodles super easy! I bought a store rotisserie chicken and added spices like savory and rosemary to enhance the home cooked taste! Agreed noodles need to cook about 35 minutes! Fantastic recipe!

My husband loved it. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken (reduced fat) because he does not like cream of mushroom.  He even took the left overs to work for lunch and he doesn't eat leftovers :)

We all really liked this dish. Even my picky 2 and 6 year old. It makes Alot of food. I agree with another reviewer that states it would be good for a potluck. I used dry noodles that i boiled separately till almost done then added it the soup mix to finish cooking. I did added a good bit of pepper and used 3 cups of cooked chicken to use it up.  My only complaint would be that it was alot more soupy then i thought it would be. I added some instant potato flakes to thicken it up. It didn't effect the flavoring at all. Next time i'll try to cut the recipe in half if it doesn't keep well. Great with Biscuits.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious!   I used rotisserie chicken and a 24oz package of Reames frozen egg noodles, added 1/2 of a small can of sweet corn and a 1/3 of a small can of sweet peas (drained)....served over mashed potatoes with biscuits.  Wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.  I finally have a "keeper" Chicken and Noodles recipe.

Incredible! I used a decent sized box of swanson chicken broth, 24oz package of reames frozen egg noodles, and a rotisserie chicken. Other than that I followed the recipe. Made a huge batch, added a little cayenne pepper for a kick. Amazing, wholesome!

This was a great recipe for chicken and noodles.  I boiled my chicken breast first then used the broth instead of the canned broth.  Then I added the called ingredients, but I also added some chopped onions, parsley, and pepper.  I cooked my noodles seperate then added them at the end.  Next time I think I'll add some peas for color.  Will definitely make this over and over again!!!!

This was really good, and easy enough for hubby to make. My only problem was that I used dried noodles that I cooked seperately, so the gravy was a bit thin. Next time I'll try and find the frozen egg noodles. However, there is an advantage to cooking the noodles seperately. I used the leftovers to make chicken and rice by substituting the gravy for the water (I used 2 cups gravy + 1/2 cup water, a boullion cube and 1 cup rice. Cooked for 30 minutes instead of the 20 that rice normally takes). The recipe is actually very similar to the way I usually make chicken and rice, but it's a bit easier and just as tasty. So now I've got two meals out of one great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe before with the following changes: dried noodles, and an extra cream of chicken because my family won't touch mushrooms.  I was in the process of making it tonight and realized someone had eaten one of the cream of chickens. All I could find was a cheddar soup in the cabinet. I was a little skeptical, but I tossed it in and it actually gave a nice little flavor. I think I'll keep the change next time.  My daughter and I won't eat chicken noodle soup from the can, but we both like this.

Easy and yummy. My son loves it. I didn't have frozen noodles, so I used dried wide Amish noodles. I had only small can of broth, so I used water and bouillon cube. I also added some celery seed and dried parsley just couple of shakes. Oh, and some fresh black pepper.

This is really quite good, particularly given how easy it is. It's a great recipe if you're one of us folks from the midwest who like their chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes. Sometimes I have to thicken it up a bit for that purpose, but it works for it and is quite tasty.  It also opens itself up to interesting additions like veggies!

Great way to use leftover chicken.  I scaled this down to half using what I had on hand...1 can cream of mushroom no cream of chicken.  I use chicken granules and water instead of broth. Lastly, 9 oz regular egg noodles.  This came out tasty so I figure it I could have followed the recipe closer it would have been very tasty.  My only suggestion is to cover the simmering noodles to speed up cooking time but stir often to ensure there is not sticking.

Hmm, well, there isn't much to this.  It's not bad, but it's a little boring.  I added sautéed onions, and Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup, so I left out the onion and garlic powder and added salt and pepper to taste.  One reviewer was right about the leftovers being less than appealing, but we ate them anyway; we're not too picky I guess.  I also used canned chicken.  This was certainly easy and inexpensive to make, not bad in a pinch, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

My family loved this.  I made it almost exactly like the recipe stated...with only a few minor changes.  I will keep this one for sure!

This meal was SO delicious. I used regular  chicken and seasoned with garlic pepper. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Dale just flipped over it!

This recipe is very good! The only change I made is that I added peas and carrots the last 10 minutes. It was thick and had a great rich chicken taste. I used chicken left from a rotisserie chicken I had bought and is was delicious. I always put our chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes - Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and was pleased with the results.  I did have to cook the noodles longer to get them to the consistency that we like, however.  I found it thickened overnight and the flavor was still great the next day.  We will put this into our meal rotation because it makes a lot and doesn't require a lot of expensive ingredients.  Thanks for sharing, Tammy!

I found this recipe too salty, and I didn't even have to add any salt. I used reduced sodium cream of mushroom. Reduced sodium chicken broth and cream of chicken probably would've helped as well, but I didn't have any. It just tasted like it was missing something overall.

This was so quick and easy. Perfect for a busy evening. I used a 12 oz pkge of dried dumpling noodles and it was perfect. Kids enjoyed it a lot. Will probabaly add a few veggies next time. Delicious.

This was yummy!  I used one can cream of chicken, one can cream of chicken with herbs, and a can of cream of mushroom with garlic.  I also added an extra can of broth because I had a 24 oz bag of frozen noodles.  Kept seasonings exactly as stated and it was great!  It did taste homemade.  Thanks!

I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with how this turned out. First of all, whoever submitted the picture had to of made changes to the recipe. I followed this to a T, and all I got was soupy chicken with a couple noodles floating around in it. It either needs to be updated to have less broth or double the noodles. 

What a disappointment and waste of money.

I really, really wanted to like this one.  My mom was requesting chicken and noodles and I had the ingredients to make this one, so I gave it a go.  It was too thin, so I ended up thickening it with cornstarch.  It also lacked a LOT in the flavor department.  I guess canned soup can only take you SO far.  I will keep looking for a chicken and noodle recipe that we all enjoy and probably won't make this one again.  Thanks!

This was really good and very easy! The only thing I changed was I put in 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth instead of 5 1/2 and it turned out perfect (I read on other reviews it was too runny with 5 1/2). I added a little pepper also when I served it and it was delectable!

This soup is such a big hit in my family! Nobody can get enough of them. I always follow the directions exactly as they are, no changes need to be made. At family get togethers, these noodles are the only dish that are completely gone at the end of the day. I think my whole family would like to thank you for such a delicious recipe :)

This was perfect! It was so easy and delicious - great comfort food. I added carrots and celery - and used 2 cans of cr. mushroom soup (since I was out of cr. chicken).

I loved this! Only things I changed were: added chopped celery and carrots, and I cooked the noodles half way separately, therefore using only half the broth. Was fairly salty still, even though I didn't add any and I used reduced sodium soups. Overall, fabulous though!

I took the advice of another person and substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup. I added frozen peas to the meal. I placed everything in a casserole dish and covered with Mozzarella and Cheddar cheese then broiled it in the oven. It was delicious.

Ehhhh....I didn't like it that much.  On the whole, it was good, but it was too fake tasting for me.  My boyfriend said, "I like it!  It's not the best, but it's not bad!" and ate it...but, he gobbled the asparagus I had made for a side.  Made a few changes, used 1 can of cream of chicken, a can of cream of mushroom, and a can of golden mushroom.  Also put in some half/half to try to lighten color.  I also had to use thickener to thicken the sauce up.  I had no frozen noodles, so I used dried...they worked fine.  Sauteed the chicken with red bell pepper, garlic, and onion.  There wasn't enough chicken...I'll have to double if I make it again.  Altogether, it tasted "poor." and I mean that in the literal sense.  It tasted like something that you'd find somewhere that couldn't use good ingredients.  Only thing that helped this meal for me was the glass of good red wine I drank with it.  I don't know if I will make this again.  The only great part about it was the one-pot-meal advantage.

True this is incredibly easy and quite tasty.  I made it just as written (except for regular egg noodles in place of the frozen).  It is comfort food at it's finest.  The problem I'm finding with "comfort foods" is that they are very high in all that is bad for you.  When you want the occassional nummy-food on that cold winter day, this would surely fit the bill.  Not good for the weekly rotation though because of the fat, sodium, etc.

Didn't have frozen noodles or all of the canned soups needed.  Looking through some other recipes and reviews though I used a little milk, white wine, and leftover french onion dip    (substitute for sour cream)to make my sauce.  All I can say is AWESOME and don't knock it till you try it!  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Ok so I changed tons of things in this recipe because I didn't have what it called for but it turned out wonderful!!!  Changes as follows:    1.  I grilled my chicken with onions since I did not have onion powder - I used about 1/2 of a small white onion salt & peppered them   2.  I placed all of the Soup like ingredients in the soup pan and didn't realize it called for 26 oz of cream of chicken soup so I only used one can, also replaced cream of mushroom with cream of celery also couldn't find salt so I used Ms. Dash instead   3.  Boiled ingredients and then added dry egg noodles (didn't have frozen ones) and let boil for about 5 mins, then I added the grilled chicken and onions and about 1/4 cup fresh sliced mushrooms and continued to boil until noodles where al dente (still a little firm but done).      Served over mashed potatoes.  The sauce had thickened considerably - like a gravy.  IT WAS HEAVENLY!!!!   My husband who doesn't like gravy even ate it and liked it (although I don't think it is his favorite meal) - he even said I could make it again, just not every week :)  ---He also ate the leftovers - which is saying alot for him, and they tasted just as great as the night before!

LOVED IT!!!  I served it over mashed potatoes just like we ate it in Ohio when I was a kid.  This was the best I've had.  It made a ton, but that's okay.  I froze the rest, and will happily eat the rest later!!

This is a great recipe! I add carrots and substituted cream of celery for the cream of mushroom. Make sure you do not get the precooked egg noodles, but get the frozen ones. The precooked frozen didn't cook as well.

I started with sauted onion, carrot and celery (and a bit of garlic). I added the soups (I used the condensed version with LOW sodium) and also used low sodium chicken broth. The only egg noodles I could find were the dry kind, but I bought a "homemade" style and the whole dish turned out WONDERFUL. I served it with hot bread and a salad. It was terrific and we ate it the leftovers throughout the weekend. YUM!

I probably would have given this recipe 5 stars BUT...I think using low or no sodium soups is a MUST. That way you can add in your own seasonings. I am a salt lover but this, in my opinion this was a little too salty. I think using low or sodium soups would take care of that. I added in a little sour cream too trying to balance out the saltiness. I will try to make it again using low sodium soups and re - rate at that time. Easy and the kids liked though.

I thought this was delicious.  I used cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom and I loved the flavor it added.  I also used extra wide noodles and cooked them before adding to liquid.  Looking forward to the leftovers.

YummO!  Comfort food at it's best.  My kids love the stuff. I added a half of stick of butter for an extra creamy treat.  Good stuff!  Oh and I used dry noodles instead of frozen.

This was wonderful!  I made a couple of small changes by using 2 regular-sized cans of Cream of Chicken soup, instead of the the large one,  and used a 16 oz. package of dry extra wide egg noodles.  This recipe is a winner!  Thank you for sharing it!

I was a little skeptical because I am not a fan of any recipe that calls for cream soups but this one changed my mind.  It was delicious.  The only thing I would add is some fresh cracked pepper!  Yum!

This is a good and easy to make recipe.  I used Reame's frozen noodles and they tasted great - had to simmer about 40 minutes.  I served over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

Really rich, thick, and yummy! I scaled the recipe to 3 servings but still had enough to serve 4 people because it is so rich. I might use less salt next time, but otherwise, this recipe is perfect.

Very easy!  Very good!  Even the picky eater in the family enjoyed it.  I did tweak it a little bit; I couldn't find the frozen egg noodles, so I added a whole package of the dried noodles after it came to a boil.  I also added two cans of green beans.  I WILL make this recipe again!

YUM!!!  This one is definitely a keeper!  I made a few adjustments to suit my family's taste:  added 1 more can of chicken broth to thin out the sauce, added 1 more cup of shredded chicken, and threw in some chopped carrots and celery.

Thanks Tammy!

I loved this recipe.  Having read previous reviews I decided to use low sodium broth and healthy request soup.  It was great!  I only used two cans of soup and three cans of broth.  The consistency was just right for my family.

I am in love with this recipe! It is a quick one pot recipe and tasted amazing and could not be simpler. I am not good with making homemade noodles there for I used Reames noodles in the frozen section which are pretty close to home made. This was my first time making homemade chicken and noodles and it came out fabulous!

I didn't have frozen noodles, so I just used a bag of dry egg noodles and cooked it before adding to the broth/sauce. I also added a pinch of poultry seasoning to give it some more flavor. This was a great way to use up left over rotisserie chicken and was family and kid approved.

Such a great recipe!  I wanted to have some veggies in mine tho so I saute together several carrots and celery stalks, diced, with diced onion. I didnt have seasoned salt so I added salt, pepper, celery seed and paprika and a teaspoon of Knorr chicken boullion to improvise.  I could only find the noodles in 24 oz bags so I went with that and added a little more chicken broth. Whether I made changes or not this recipe is very good, if you want to add some veggies to it or personalize it more the recipe as a base is easy to work with.

I needed something quick to take to a friend who just got out of the hospital. I made it and I was skeptical that it would taste decent I had my husband and daughter try it and they loved it. Not sure why it was so good, but I didn’t want to ask too many questions. I used canned cubed chicken for ease. I think next time I might put some carrots and celery in it just for color and texture but it definitely was not needed this time around.

I made this for the first time today because my family is getting over some 12 hour bug. This totally got the spot! Only difference I did was add 32 oz of chicken broth. I will definitely be using this recipe from here on out.

I loved this recipe,  I was looking for something extra for my chicken & noodles so I did so with the cream of mushroom soup. I used 2 cans & added carrots & celery,  parsley, and other seasonings to my taste. So from now on cream of mushroom soup is my secret ingredient, thank you...Dannigirl

Made exactly as directed, except my box of broth was 44 oz (4 ounces more than called for) and my frozen noodles came in a 24 oz package (6 oz more than called for). DELICIOUS and crazy simple! Be sure to grind some fresh pepper over it!

Great base for old school, southern style comfort food. I did realize I only had low sodium soups and broth so I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder and added celery salt, per another reviewer's suggestion. I also boiled, then shredded the chicken, threw in minced onions, finely chopped baby spinach, defrosted frozen peas and corn, and about 10 sliced white mushrooms.  At the last minute, and at the suggestion of another review, I added about 2 TB of butter a few minutes before serving, which made a huge difference in richness for the little that was incorporated into the gravy. I served it with Grands southern-style biscuits. My husband said it tasted like pot pie and I thought it was similar to my Granny's chicken and dumplings. So awesome! Next time I will add fresh carrots for nutrients, color, and a little extra sweetness.

The key to mouthwatering chicken and noodles is to cook chicken thighs overnight in a crock pot to extract the best flavors from the fat and bones into the broth. I make homemade egg noodles with mine. Takes a little longer but this dish is a favorite everytime I serve it. This is comfort food at it's finest. Not meant to be bold flavored. It makes my mouth happy.

This is such a versatile base. As is its simple fare but homey and good for cold nights. I did par cook Reams noodles for ten mins than added them to the pot. I also used fresh onions and garlic. You can literally use any veggie left in your fridge. Tweak as needed and add the salt last. I served it with a salad and multigrain bread. If you want a thinner sauce or more of it at the end add in more ckn broth, sour cream or even milk.

My family LOVES this recipe.  I tried for years to make chicken and noodles as good as my mother's.    Although I still think that my mother's chicken and noodles tastes better, (The recipe for her chicken and noodles is in her head!) I think it makes a close 2nd  and my family, (who has never tasted my mother's chicken and noodles) thinks it comes in first!

Added canned corn & mushrooms; steamed a small bag of carrots; totally spontaneous in the actual measurement of ingredients. A delicious meal and so grateful for such a quick and easy out of the can recipe for chicken and noodles.

I made it with 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of 1 chicken and 1 mushroom (just not a mushroom fan) and doubled the spices.  It may have been because of the soup change, but when I tasted it halfway through it reaaaally needed more seasoning.  But with those simple changes it was perfect for us!  Bonus points for how well it heats up; my husband never does leftovers, but with these he actually ate leftovers TWICE.  Really simple but really delicious.

My family requests this dish regularly and there’s always enough to freeze a few servings for later. It is delicious as is, but here are the changes I’ve made to suit us:  I use homemade chicken bone broth for increased nutrition and because it’s so inexpensive and simple to make and freeze. I substitute 3 regular size cans of cream of chicken soup for the large one and I buy the frozen noodles that are already cooked to make this easy recipe come together even faster. I add 2 bags of frozen peas & carrots for added color and nutrition as well, steamed in the microwave. Today I tried making in the crockpot and it turned out beautifully. I actually put the chicken and broth in frozen on high. When the meat was 165 degrees (a couple hours) I shredded it and whisked in the cream soups and seasonings, and let it heat up for another hour or so. Then added the veggies & frozen noodles. Another hour and it was done and ready to eat.  Next time I’m going to try adding a few Tbsp of butter just because it sounds good.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Easy, quick and tasty recipe. I used fresh boiled chicken then diced, and saved the broth using it instead of the store bought broth. I also added some frozen peas and carrots. Will make again.

Super easy and delicious! Overnight they got a little thick so I added some milk while reheating and they were even better after! Will definitely be making again

I used cooked egg noodles and added heated peas and corn. I only needed to heat it after adding the noodles and vegetables for 15 minutes instead of 30. It was very tasty and even my picky family loved it.

Tasted good. I added a little more seasoning than what it called for and I would add a little more broth but I didn’t have enough. It’s nice and thick as well. Added peas and more mushrooms. Tasted great!!

I didn't have the condensed chicken soup so I solely used all mushroom soup. I cooked all the ingredients till it was the consistency I wanted. Also, for flavor, I sliced up half an onion and used real garlic. As suggested, heavy on the pepper. Once the stock was done I added carrots and a piece of left over turkey sausage. LOL I cooked regular egg noodles on the side for 7 minutes then added noodles to stock. Let it boil back up for 5  minutes. Mine was thick but not too thick and not too soupy. Great tasting chicken and noodles!

I use these modifications for all my chicken "soup" style meals. Look around for CREAM OF CHICKEN W/HERB it takes the flavor up a notch. I used cream of celery instead of the mushroom (husband is weird) and I added a LARGE  chicken bullion cube (2 small). I used medium flat egg noodles cookes for 20 min in the sauce (husband had 2 bowls, I am working on my second and there won't be any left overs by the end of day tomorrow.

My husband and daughters loved this easy and simple soup. I used the low sodium versions of condensed soups. Next time I’ll make it with my recently homemade condensed cream of soups. Also thinking of throwing in some frozen veggies to make it heartier.

I didn't have all the right ingredients on hand so I had to improvise a little, but it turned out amazing! I used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, a jar of chicken gravy, and dried egg noodles but other than a little less cooking time for the pasta I followed the recipe. Added some canned corn and peas at the end too. Family loved it!

It was ok just by following the recipe. I added some other seasonings to fit my taste. Definitely need more broth or less of the condensed soup to cook the noodles. I used the prepackaged dry egg noodles. My hubby and son loved it overall.

This was a very simple dish to make. I did make a few changes instead of frozen egg noodles I used a bag of dry egg noodles that I had in my cabinet, cooked the noodles as directed and added to the chicken soup mix. Once it was all done I made cresent rolls and mashed potatoes to go on the Botton and the chicken and noodles to top off my husband and I enjoyed it very much and yes I will make this again probably when it gets a little colder maybe around October this is perfect for a tailgating party.

I used about 2 pounds chicken thighs, boiled (simmered) with salt, pepper, 1 cut up onion, 3 carrots cut in 2 in pieces, 2 stalks celery cut up in 2-3 in pieces, and a bay leaf.  When chicken was tender, took chicken off bone and used this chicken in the recipe with the soups, used 1 can chicken broth and remainder broth was home made stock I had in freezer, and added a can of mushrooms and cut up the carrot, onion and celery used in cooking chicken into the chicken and noodles.  I put the bones from chicken back in broth and simmered a little longer and then had broth to freeze, as well.  I used the seasoning in chicken and noodle recipe as cited, added some ground pepper and parsley.  Turned out delicious.

My family loved this.  I made a couple of changes only because I had looked at the recipe wrong and did not by the large can of cream of chicken soup.  I used 2-10 oz cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, then only 2 cans of chicken broth to keep the ratio about the same.  Also, I used one 16 oz. bag of frozen Reames egg noodles.  I only used a sprinkling of the seasonings and no salt. (cream soups are salty enough for me). I cooked the egg noodles separately then heated up the other ingredients and combined them.  It was great.

I used my crock pot to cook the chicken in the soups and broth. I added carrots and celery too. Then about 30 minutes before dinner I added the frozen noodles and some pepper! It was very good! Our whole family has been sick and this was great! We made some mashed potatoes and rolls too!

Added peas as did others probably will add some herbs next time as it was a tad bland. Used Amish style large noodles and leftovers were still great.

So easy yet incredibly delicious! Although I did add more mushrooms to it to enhance that flavor. I did use dried noodles to frozen because I couldn't find them in the store.

This was perfect comfort food. Delicious. I didn't have frozen noodles so got adventurous and made some from another recipe on this site. well worth the effort. This recipe really wouldn't be the same with boxed noodles. Will be making regularly.

I had cooked boneless chicken thighs in the crockpot that day and was looking for something quick and easy to make with them.  This recipe fit the bill.  I made as written, but only had I bag of frozen noodles so I cut the chicken broth to two cans and kept the rest the same.  I added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas and the taste was great!  My only complaint was that it was a little salty for me, so next time I would omit the seasoning salt or use low sodium soups and broth.  Overall a winner!

My family LOVED this! I dont usually change a recipe -- and then review the altered version (in fact that's a pet peeve of mine:)... but this time I made an exception. I chopped a medium onion, 2 carrots, and 2 celery stalks and sauteed just until soft in about 1 Tbsp butter... then added cream of chicken soup (subbed for mushroom soup), chicken broth, and 1 shredded rotisserie chicken, 2 pkgs Reams noodles and fresh ground pepper. (omited salt, onion powder and garlic). Served over mashed potatoes. I will definitely make again!!

Omgoodness....delicious!  My family loves this recipe.  The only change I made was adding a little more Cream of Chicken soup, as a personal preference.  I think by adding a few veggies like peas, carrots, and corn, it would add a wonderful flavor.  Kind of like homemade chicken pot pie!  I will make this again.

So easy. I was not feeling well and felt chicken and noodles would help. All the ingredients were on hand and just threw together in a few minutes. Perfect!

Love the flavor and simplicity of the sauce (gravy).  However, to make it a little more "homey" and more like grandma used to make, I added homemade egg noodles.  They are easy to make and a fun way to get kids involved.

This was really tasty, easy, and quick. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have noodles, so I subbed in bowtie pasta. I boiled the pasta first and added it to the soup for the last 10 minutes. I also added 1/2 a bag of frozen peas and carrots for some color. Will definitely make this again. Perfect comfort food.

I made this using homemade extra wide noodles.    It was delicious.  Very easy to make, too.  The only thing I did differently was I cooked my noodles to almost done...... al dente,,,,,,and added them once the chicken mixture was blended and hot.  Just like chicken and dumplings but a whole lot easier.  Some crusty bread and you've got a great meal.

Very easy!  I didn't add noodles as instructed. Boiled egg noddles per bag instructions 6-8min at same time as cooking chicken.  I wanted to save gravy with chicken to have with mashed potatoes and it worked perfectly! Also tasted great as "left overs."

Too much sodium! If I made it again I would add veggies and definitely use low sodium broth and soups and less or no seasoning salt.

I made this tonight and my husband really liked it. I did make changes. I added celery, carrot and Onion. I also added less onion salt and bumped up the garlic. It was my first time using frozen noodles and I surprisingly liked them a lot. All and all a great recipe for when you are craving comfort good!

This was so easy to make! My family loved it! I think the must do on this recipe is to get the frozen noodles (I found them at Walmart). It just wouldn't be the same with dry noodles. They were just like homemade! We normally have leftovers, but not for this meal! They ate every last bite! Great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I boiled 3 chicken breasts and then shredded them.  I only had two cans of chicken broth, which made it thicker, but is my preference.  Instead of the frozen noodles, I used 3/4 bag of egg noodles and also added a half can of mixed vegetables during the last five minutes  (normally I would use frozen veggies, but didn't have any on hand.  The canned veggies worked out just fine).  This was enough to feed a family of four with one leftover serving.  My husband and kids all loved it.   Definitely will fix again.

Delicious and easy.  Cooked egg noodles separately and added to bowls individually.  This way it doesn't soak up all the broth.  Simmered soup for about 10 minutes.  Talk about making a quick, on the run soup.

I needed to make chicken & noodles for a get together of 20-25 ladies. I had never made chicken & noodles before but this recipe appealed to me and the reviews were really helpful! I did add some cream of celery as well as the cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, used Essenhaus Amish Noodles instead of frozen, and used precooked grilled chicken strips and diced them up. I cooked the noodles in chicken broth and water while I mixed and heated the rest of the ingredients. At first I thought I had too much garlic so I googled "too much garlic in food". It said to add rice or pasta, well I was adding pasta! So after the noodles cooked I combined everything together and it did the trick!! I had them in a roaster pan to keep warm and they did get a little dry so I added some water but wished I had more chicken broth. The meal was a hit! People had 2nds and took some home!! I'll make this recipe again!!! I served the chicken & noodles with mashed potatoes but due to time and quantity I used Idahoan instant potatoes. Instead of water I used chicken broth and added butter to it. Brought it to a boil. Removed from heat. Added heavy whipping cream then the potatoes. Some couldn't believe they were instant! Happy cooking!

Good winter  comfort food recipe. I made no changes, though a dash of nutmeg might be interesting. Having just retired a few months ago, I'm able to try new recipes, and I've never done chicken and noodles before. After making this recipe, I won't need to try any other when the mood strikes me.

Didn't use the cream of mushroom soup instead used 2 cans of the cream of chicken (hubby doesn't do mushrooms).  Also used wide egg noodles cooked separately but only boiled for a few minutes then added to the soup.  Didn't want them to get mushy they were perfect!  Also warmed up nicely the next day.  My husband says this was the best soup he has ever eaten and wants this every week from now on!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful easy recipe.

No such thing as a 26 oz can of soup that I could find, so used three regular cans cream of chicken.  Used dry noodles and let them cook in the broth.  All other items according to the recipe....Delicious!   Will make again (and again)!

I expected this to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good! We made a few adjustments simply because of what we had on hand - added some extra chicken and some extra chicken soup (couldn't find the right size large can, so ended up with 3 x 10.5 oz cans).  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make!

This was very very good.  I tweaked it some according to our own tastes.  I first sauteed onion, carrots and celery in about 2 tbs. of butter and added them to the broth that was on the stove and simmering.  Simmered that for a few minutes until veggies were tender and added the garlic powder and pepper.  Then I added the soup (I used an extra can of cream of chicken soup) and incorporated that.  Added the noodles and cooked for 15 minutes and added already cooked chicken and simmered for about 5 more minutes.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to bring out the flavors, as I usually add some sugar to my soups, stews and casseroles, not too much of course but just enough to bring out the flavors.  It is excellent, and I will serve this on mashed potatoes.  YUM.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I also thought it needed some black pepper, so I added 11/2 tsp. I did simmer it the whole 30 minutes. I did also added 1 cup of chopped portabella mushrooms. I did use the Reame noodles. My son is not much on soups, but he did like this!

I just thought this was OK.  My mother loved it though.  I cooked it in the crockpot.  I put in 2 small cans of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans of chicken broth.  2 pounds of chicken breasts, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, no seasoning salt , 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I cooked on low for 3 hours.  I shredded the chicken, added 1 cup of frozen peas and 12 ounces of dry egg noodles cooked al dente to the crockpot and cooked another hour on high.

I made this lastnight and the whole family liked it a lot - even my picky 6-yr-old went back for a second helping! I sauteed the cubed chicken in a pan with butter, salt, pepper & thinly sliced onion. I didn't use onion powder or garlic powder - when I put everything in the pot I added a tsp of minced garlic (and of course i already had sliced onion in with my chicken) I used a bag of dry noodles instead of the frozen kind - so I waited to add them until the last 10 minutes. During the last 5 minutes I added 2 T of flour because it wasn't quite thick enough - maybe because I used the dry noodles instead of frozen. I will definitely make it again! This recipe is a keeper.

I followed the  general directions, but did add carrots, peas, and extra spices.  It was still kind of bland.  I'll probably try it again with additional adjustments.  Good recipe for people with small children who are picky or don't like too much flavor.

Have made this several times for large groups and it always gets great reviews.  I always use frozen Reams egg noodles - someone mentioned letting them thaw first, and I'm curious to try that next time to see what difference it makes.  I don't understand serving noodles over mashed potatoes, but I always serve with big fluffy homemade biscuits ... yummy comfort food at it's finest!

Made for dinner last night and it was so good my husband went back for a second and a third. We also had enough left over for lunch today. I boiled and shredded 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and mixed in dress pepper with the other seasonings. I let it simmer for 45 minutes rather than the 20-30 minutes, and I truly believe that made it as good as it was. I served on top of red akin mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again.

It tasted kind of bland. I ended up putting some extra pepper into it. 
I think it is a decent recipe that can be improved upon.

Good recipe! Had a few alterations so I couldn't give it 5 stars. I didn't have frozen noodles so I just used bagged noodles, which made it cook faster. I added diced carrots, celery, fresh garlic, doubled the onion powder and about 1 tsp black pepper. Once noodles were done, I added a bit of flour to thicken it. Also, I used canned chicken breast and didn't drain it, so I skipped the season salt. I'll definitely make this again! It'll be better with homemade noodles, but the family loved it. Very quick, 1 pot dinner that really hit the spot :-)

I made this for my husband (I am a vegetarian) an he said it was even better than what his mother made growing up. If you are looking for that "traditional chicken & noodles dish to put over mashed potatoes" -- THIS is the dish! I make it exactly according to the instructions. No adjustments necessary! Thank you for sharing this!

A nice alternative to regular chicken soup, though it was too salty as written. I used healthy request versions of the cream soups, low sodium chicken broth and only 1/2 the seasoned salt-had to add some milk to cut the sodium. Really great after being out in the cold and rain for my son's lacrosse game!

I used frozen dumplings instead of egg noodles and a rotisserie chicken and it turned out to be an amazing chicken & dumplings! I think I read that one reviewer mentioned using this recipe to bring to someone who is sick, just had a baby, whatever. Such a good idea!

I love this recipe! Sooo easy. I use left over chicken or canned chicken. I usually use the frozen egg noodles because they taste closest to homemade, but in a pinch I have also used the dry kluski noodles too and they worked equally well. This is a very forgiving recipe.

I just served this to my family and my son's friend and they all said it was delicious. We don't care for mushrooms so I didn't use cream of mushroom soup. I added another can of cream of chicken instead. Also, I had grilled 3 good sized chicken breasts seasoned with garlic and a variety of spices. I think that really added to the flavor. I used dried egg noodles and cooked them separately then poured the chicken and gravy over the noodles instead of putting the noodles in the pot. That way I could save the noodles and chicken gravy separately. I will definitely make this again and maybe next time try the suggestion I read that said to add cheese soup instead of mushroom soup.

This was my first time making this - I didn't really want the common water type noodle soup; so when I found this recipe, I thought that I'd give it a go. It is so delicious  and it smells divine cooking on the hob.
I made a batch of them and after a while cooking this, I froze them.  To re-heat them, a I place just enough warm water to cover the bottom of the pot, place in the soup (make sure that you have left it in the fridge overnight to de-frost), place on a lid and leave to simmer for 15 minutes.  Not forgetting to stir it often because it might stick to the bottom of the pan.
My only negative thing about this soup is that perhaps there could be a bit more soup? I found that there was just a bit more noodles and a little less soup.
I would definitely recommend this recipe - I can't wait to make more next week! :)

Comfort food at it's best. I added some frozen mixed veggie mix, used all Healthy Request cream of chicken since I didn't have cream of mushroom, and added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon base as well as some herbs de Provence. I also used dried noodles--cooked first, added at the end. It was the perfect dish to use the chicken meat I'd boiled as part of making chicken stock.  It was simple, filling, and tasty--I look forward to having it again tomorrow since it made a ton! :-)

This works for my husband. Used leftover turkey and home made turkey broth. Also used packaged noodles. (Since the turkey was brined before roasting, I did not add the seasoned salt.) Also added a bit of crushed red pepper.

Really yummy! I don't like mushrooms so I subbed a can of cream of celery. I used low fat soups, so it didn't thicken fully, but got plenty creamy. Definitely a must keep!

Delicious!!!  I used dried noodles, 1 package 12 oz. instead of 2 - 9 oz. and did not have seasoning salt.  I just added the onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper. I only simmered it for 10 minutes and took off the heat.  You might want to add some more chicken broth, it was a little thick, but had great flavor.  My kids loved it!!!  Will definitely make again.

I will definitely try this recipe again, but with a minor change. Reduce the salt! It came out a bit salty for my taste. I think using sodium free chicken broth, and halving the seasoning salt would make it perfect. Other than that a nice recipe. Thanks!

Thought this was a great recipe! I used Cream of Celery instead of Cream of Mushroom as we are not mushroom fans. I used frozen egg noodles, I can't imagine this would taste nearly as good with dry egg noodles. Made real mashed potatoes and served it over the top. Yummy!!!

pretty good.  made some changes.  only had cream of chicken so I used 2 of those, plus a can of mushrooms.  Then added chopped garlic, celery & carrots.  I cooked whole wheat 'egg' style noodles separately & added at the end.

it was a bit bland for me, but the kids ate it (picking out the veggies of course).  good comfort food & easy to put together with stuff in the house.  thx.

I made this for 25 people at a birthday party, and everyone - adults and kids included - went back for seconds! One guy even commented that he couldn't find the salt & pepper so he ate it without it - but decided he wouldn't have wanted it anyway, because it was perfect as is!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than to scale it to the amount I needed.

This was pretty good. I made my own chicken broth by boiling my chicken with celery, onions, and garlic and pepper. I added the noodles and cooked it altogether and added cheese at the end along with Ritz crackers. I will make again.YUM

This was very good.  Only had one can of chicken broth on hand, so just mixed 2 bouillion cubes with 2 cups water.  Added a bay leaf and some crushed pepper. Did not use seasoned salt as I though the broth would be salty enough, and it was fine.  Used dry noodles since that was all I had.  Don't see what the difference is between dry or frozen noodles.  Just dumped them in the pot to cook. Started out runny but thickened nicely as it cooked.  Also added a couple dollops of sour cream for a little extra creaminess.  Will definitely make again.

This is the perfect chicken and noodle recipe. I am not one for making noodles from scratch, but the frozen egg noodles are as close to home made as I've ever found. I found the seasonings unexpected, but created a perfect taste. I made this once with dry egg noodles, and didn't have nearly the results of the frozen.

Not bad, a little too runny for my taste. Next time I won't use as much chicken broth.

I use this recipe as a starter base.  I cook my chicken in the broth and add celery, onion and carrots.  When chicken is cooked I remove and shred, then return to the pot and continue to cook until veggies are tender, then add frozen noodle and cook.  Frozen noodles are what make this dish yummy and very comforting.  I always serve with real mashed potatoes!

I thought these were okay. I used dried pasta instead of the frozen kind because it's what we had in the pantry.  My husband liked them more than me. My 18 month-old liked them as well. I think it just had a strong broth taste for me, which I didn't care for. My tastes just prefer something with a little more flavor or variety.

I've been looking for a recipe that would come close to my grandmother's chicken and noodles. This was it. This recipe is definitely a "comfort food". A bit heavy but very tasty. The frozen noodles I used didn't work very well so when I make it the next time I'll try and find another brand.

I took this to a church potluck and a whole group of little girls came over to tell me how awesome my chicken and noodles were...nice!  A great rich flavor that is just plain filling comfort food.  The only adjustment I made was to use "No Yolks" noodles in place of the frozen noodles since that is all I had on hand.

I'm not a big cream of mushroom fan but this was good. My kids loved it which is rare because they normally only like butter sauces on noodles or pasta. I also used dry egg noodles. I boiled them for 6 minutes in salted water before added them to the sauce (it was ready to eat in no time). I didn't use any chicken because I didn't have any and I didn't add any salt. By omitting the chicken, this makes for a great side dish as well. Thanks, will make again.

I used cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom soup. I also purchased a roasted chicken from Walmart (around here they are right by the registers) and debone it for the meat.  My family loves it and I can have dinner on the table in about 45 minutes!

This is one of my husband's favorites. I use 2 (10.75 oz) condensed cream of chicken in place of the 26 oz chicken and 10.75 oz mushroom, 4 1/2 c. homemade broth and 8 oz dried egg noodles. Turns out great, but like another reviewer stated, it is thick and more mushy reheated. We like this enough to not care though! This works great with the Basic Chicken Stock recipe submitted by Logan on this site. I make it in a crockpot and have enough broth to make this and have some for freezing. Same with the chicken--enough for this recipe plus leftover for another quick meal.

I loved this recipe!  It was really quick and easy to make.  It reminded me of the chicken and noodles that my friend's German mom used to make for us as kids.  She rolled out her own noodles on their kitchen table.  Yum!  I did used the Rames 24oz frozen noodles and added some carrots.  I simmered for 30 minutes per directions but I think I could have gone a bit longer.  Noodles weren't as soft as I would like and the sauce could have been a bit thicker. Next time I make this I am going to double the chicken (per my carniverous husband) and add some peas, onions, mushrooms and celery.  This way I can sneak in some more veggies on the kids. I have a feeling this is going to be one of my most favorite cold weather dishes.

This is incredibly easy and very delicious just like the title.  I added a bay leaf in with the soups to give it a more homemade flavor and couldn't find the frozen egg noodles at he supermarket I was at, so I added extra wide egg noodles in for the last 10 minutes and a little more broth.  Good stuff.

This is very good comfort food.  Next time I will add some mushrooms that I first saute in white wine and butter for more dimension.  Also I added about 1 cup of onion per the recomendation of another reviewer.

Hit the spot last night after a cool, drizzly day.  I only used one 11 oz. pkg of frozen noodles as it was all I had. Came out more like a cream of chicken soup with noodles - but it was sooooo good!

This was yummy! I didn't have everything that this called for, but it turned out great! I had more cream of mushroom soup than cream of chicken soup, so I reversed it. I didn't have frozen noodles, so I used dry egg noodles. I also added peas and carrots to the mix for some color. It was delicious! My 3 year old who won't touch chicken, ate it all up! My 1 year old and husband loved it too! Thanks for a great recipe!

I give this recipe 4/5 stars because I did not like the frozen egg noodles.  I replaced them with hard egg noodles and added mushrooms.  Otherwise this is a very good quick and easy meal.

This was so good and super yummy. I had never used noodles like this before and so it was something really new for my family and we all loved it. It made a lot though so next time I will 1/2 the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Great comfort food!  I made this with dry noodles, sautéed minced onions and garlic instead of the powders and doubled the seasoning salt.  I also used low-fat soups, but (surprise, surprise) that made it taste a little thin. I added ½ a cup (ish) of sour cream in the last 15 minutes to thicken it back up and it came out great. A very good way to use up leftover chicken.

Made this the other night, everyone liked it. I did add some peas and carrots and used boxed noodles instead of frozen noodles. It was a little too salty for me because I have been on a sodium free diet but the others didn't seem to mind it. Thanks for sharing!

My family and I really enjoyed this easy recipe.  I used cream of celery instead of mushroom, added frozen onions, carrots, and peas, and used low sodium broth and soup.  I also used the meat from one deli chicken so it looked a little more like from scratch chicken and noodles than diced chicken.  Very good!

I made this last night in 30 minutes.....great fast and easy! I did add extra 2 cans extra of chicken broth and I also added some tumeric and poultry seasoning. I used can chicken, and a whole validia onion instead of fresh chicken and onion powder. It was a hit with the family...they all want to know when I will make it again.

I made this for my family and hardly had any leftovers!  My son ate seconds and talked about thirds.  I poured the chicken and noodles over homemade mashed potaotes and it was great!  We will definately add this to our list of family favorites.  It is great also because it made so much it would be perfect for the family gatherings and so super simple too!

Thanks, Tammy for a delicious recipe.  My family couldn't stop saying how good it was!  I didn't have a 26 oz can of cream of chicken, so I just used 2 (10.75 oz) cans. I also precooked dried noodles and then threw them in at the end. A great way to use leftover chicken!  I may throw in some frozen veggies next time too!  Thanks again!

Our family LOVES this dish!!  I boil chicken breasts with herb-ox and use that for the broth.  I use 2 cans cream of chicken instead of the mushroom.. and I use dried egg noodles instead of frozen.. I also omit the garlic etc and just use salt and pepper.  Thanks for this family favorite!!

Yum!  You can't beat this for a quick and easy meal.  I like frozen noodles, but I didn't have them on hand.  Dried ones worked fine.  I also didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used two cans of cream of mushroom.  Only had one can of broth, so I added two extra cans of water (filled the soup cans).  Definitely kid friendly.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Tammy.

This is just like Grandma's home cookin! I altered this a little, mostly because the frozen noodles were kind of expensive so I used less of them. But the frozen noodles tasted just like my grandma's homemade. Since I used fewer noodles I only used one can of chicken broth instead of three. Next time I would use low-sodium soups to cut the salt. But it tasted great!

This recipe was okay, not wonderful. I liked the taste of using frozen noodles; however, my finished product came out a bit too soupy for my taste of “chicken and noodles.” Moreover, we had a lot of leftovers. Don’t know if I’ll try again or test a different recipe.

This was an AWESOME recipe, everyone LOVED it.  I used the healthy request (low salt, low fat) in place of the regular cream of chicken soup.  I had to double the recipe, and instead of using 2 cans of the cream of mushroom soup, I only used one, because my family is not fond of mushrooms.  Since I only used one can, they couldn't even tell it was in there.  It turned out GREAT!  I will DEFINATELY be making this again, at LEAST on a monthly basis!  Thanks!!

My family really liked this one.  It was so fast and easy to make.  My husband thought it tasted like chicken and dumplings without all the work and my children said that it had a taste similar to chicken soup.  Will make this again for sure.

I mixed all the ingredients and put it in the fridge for my husband to cook one night while I was at work. When I asked my son how they liked it, he said it was great. My husband said all three kids cleaned their plates.  That's a keeper recipe.
