I am the submitter of this recipe and I am continually perfecting it.  These changes should yield a compromise between fudgy and cakey.  For 8x8 pan you can try these changes: (They won 3rd prize at the Minnesota State Fair in August-2009) Here are the changes:  2 eggs instead of one. 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar instead of 2/3 cup. 5 oz semi sweet and 1 oz bittersweet chips or baking bars (for about a whole cup total chocolate to melt) instead of 2/3 cups. 6 Tablespoons butter instead of 1/2 cup. About 4 inches of banana, then mash ( or a little more if you like strong banana flavor.)  1 Tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder mixed into the  flour and salt mixture.  Optional to FOLD into completed batter: 1/2 cup lightly toasted pecans and 1/2 cup semi sweet chips. No change to vanilla, flour, or salt.  Follow mixing instructions in recipe.  ONLY GREASE BOTTOM OF PAN. Bake at 325 for at least 35 minutes to 40 min.  Check at 35 min. You should get a shiny, crackly crust. Enjoy!

Fantastic and easy. I doubled these and made them in a 9x13 pan. I also added some extra chocolate chips to the batter right before baking. They took about 35 minutes in my oven and were chewy and delicious. They don't need frosting, but I was taking them to an event and dressed them up with the banana buttercream icing from this site. They disappeared very quickly!

These are the best brownies I have ever made.  I had to share them with our neighbors!  I doubled the recipe.  Instead of doubling the butter to one cup, I used only half a cup of butter plus half a cup of extra mashed banana.  The brownies are moist, delicious, and nobody missed the extra fat!

To the reviewer on 2-11-12:  You should not rate a recipe 3 out of 5 stars if you did not follow the recipe or the adjusted recipe as I mentioned below.  It is not fair.   1-18-12:   I followed the changes made by the submitter on July 1, 2009 on page 4 of these reviews.  First, I did NOT change the flour or salt or vanilla.
I used 2 eggs instead of one, 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar,  5 oz semi sweet and 1 oz bittersweet chips to equal 1 cup total to melt, 6 Tablespoons butter, about 4 inches of banana, then mash,  1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder mixed into the flour and salt mixture. Once batter was mixed I mixed in 1/2 cup toasted pecans and 1/2 cup semi sweet regular sized chips-NOT mini chips.  If you use mini chips, they melt into the batter and the top won't be shiny.  I can taste why these won a ribbon at the state fair!

I gave this a go and all in all, it's pretty tasty. My one banana is a bit overwhelming, but I think I just find the combo a bit strange. I will use less butter next time--1/2 cup is an entire stick and my poor brownies are a bit buttery still! The flavor is very interesting and keeps growing on me. The only real complaint I have here is the listed cook time--20 minutes? No way. I checked at 20...25...30...35...40 was the winner. 4 stars for flavor and ease of preparation!

Moist, tasty brownies.  I too had to bake them a little longer so that the middle was not runny.  The banana flavor is not too overwhelming, but is present.  Added extra chocolate chips at the end--YUM!

These brownies were so delicious that my 6-year old asked me to leave them a fifteen star review! I followed the original posters adjustments (explained under the first review), but doubled the batch. The one thing I changed was to add more cocoa powder (she suggests 1 tablespoon, I used closer to 1/4 cup). These are probably the best brownies I've ever had. They are moist and chewy, and not at all cakey. They have a rich chocolate taste that is accented by the addition of bananas, without the bananas being at all overpowering. I did need to increase the baking time to about 50 minutes, which was an excruciatingly long wait because they smell so good in the oven, but it was totally worth it. I'm already thinking about where I can take a huge batch to share--they're that good!

I tried making some changes that did not turn out so well.  First, do not use more banana than this recipe calls for.  Second, do not substitute wheat flour for the white.  The flavor was not good.  I will give this a try again with the original recipe and then re-rate.  I always end up with overripe bananas in my house so it's good to have a way to use them.

I love brownies & this did it for me.  Added chopped pecans, they came out perfect; chocolaty, gooey and crusty all at the same time.  Fantastic reheated with some vanilla ice cream....Thanks for posting!

My friend made these.  She didn't have chocolate chips in the cupboard so she used butterscotch chips instead.  Delicious!!!  Next we are going to try peanut butter chips!

These are tasty! I was surprised how much I loved them and couldn't stop eating them! Perfect for anyone who loves the chocolate-banana combo. They were great right out of the oven. The next day, they were pretty moist on the tops... like where it gets kinda sticky and messy when you pick it up to eat it...? But I didn't care, they tasted yummy!

The banana taste was too overpowering, it seems like it needs more chocolate.

I just made these - they were delicious. :] My family likes them better than regular brownies, and none of them were too thrilled by the concept of "banana brownies" at first! I read the reviews first and doubled the recipe but used only the original half cup of butter and added a half cup of mashed banana. I used milk chocolate chips, too, instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips and it certainly didn't have any adverse effects as far as taste goes. These were moist and fudgy and not cakelike (I'm not a fan of cakelike brownies.) The chocolate-to-banana ratio was perfect. I'll definitely make these again.

Easy? Yes  Tasty? Not really :o(  I love frozen chocolate covered bananas so I figured this recipe would suit me very well. It was kind of gummy (weird texture) although it certainly was quick to throw together. I used a 9 x 13 pan and doubled the recipe for a church function and only a couple of pieces were eaten. Kind of a waste in my opinion. Oh well, quite a few other reviewers liked this so maybe it's just me! PS: Didn't have any semi sweet chips so used milk chocolate chips, could this have been the problem?

I don't usually review recipes, but I feel like I have to review this after reading a negative review someone wrote based on their own bad alterations to this recipe. I made these brownies tonight, and these are great. I've made at least two dozen other brownie recipes through the years and many are too dry or cakey, but these are really moist and dense, delicious brownies. It's also a great alternative to boring banana bread if you've got a leftover, browning banana in need of a purpose.
I also must mention, I had to use whole wheat flour for these, since I bought that accidentally last time I shopped, much to my dismay. I do think you'd have to be completely nuts to think whole wheat brownies would be any good, but honestly, I cannot even tell they are whole wheat except for the texture. But that's on me, not the recipe's fault!

Wow! Great recipe! They're really good brownies. I used whole wheat flour and baked them a few extra minutes and they turned out perfect. The WW flour gives the brownie a nice texture.

Oh my goodness, these are so good!  I followed the original submitters changes posted in reviews on 9/1/09, doubled for a 9x13 pan, added 1 cup chopped walnuts, and they were prefect.  Didn't change one thing!  They did take 60 mins at 325 to be done, so next time I may play with the oven temp a bit, but other than that I would give 10 star if I could!

I made this the other night and they are wonderful.  I doubled the recipe except the butter and added extra banana and then put them in a 9X13 pan to bake.  They were excellent and kind of have a banana bread texture with chocolate taste.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I took the advice of the original poster in her updated review, plus Pelirojo Peligroso's suggestion to increase the banana rather than the butter. So I used 1/2 c. margarine, 1 c. choc. chips, 2 eggs, 1 c. brown sugar, 2 small bananas, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. salt, 3/4 c. flour, and 1 tbs. cocoa powder in a 6"x10" pan. They turned out great! I usually like my regular brownies fudgy, but being banana brownies, the slight "cakiness" seemed just perfect.

Good Moist brownie. I underestimated the time essential so they were a bit gooey but the overall flavour was awesome.

Great, easy recipe - I didn't even use my stand mixer, just mixed by hand.  The texture was nice & moist, but I would have liked a more fudgy texture.  Also, they were very sweet.  I think maybe some chocolate chips mixed in the batter before baking might add more chocolate flavor. The banana I used was very ripe and made the brownies not only very sweet, but added more than a hint of banana (good for me!).  I thought it was TOO sweet, though, so I frosted them with a Peanut Butter Icing.  Fantastic combination!  I WILL make again.

I made this twice - first time with white flour and second with whole wheat flour.  There was very little difference in taste, maybe slightly denser with the ww flour, but still tasty.  The bananas keep the brownies nice and moist.  The "girls night out" group all requested the recipe.  Thank you Gloria!

Great recipe!  I added extra vanilla, and for that shinny top; i added the sugar to the chocolate and butter mixture after i took it off the heat! Let cool in the fridge and cut into large squares and then cut them corner to corner for a triangle shape :o)

If you are looking for a brownie with a taste that is far different then any normal brownie you just found your recipe. Pretty yummy ;)

Absolutely love it! I used bittersweet baking chocolate instead, just grated it and measured that way. Turned out awesome. I'm a banana freak, so adding them to brownies is great. Thanks for sharing!

My family and dinner guests just raved over these brownies! They are delicious. I followed Gloria Lee's modified/perfected recipe found at the top of the reviews. Next time I will do the same, but decrease the sugar. Worked great using coconut oil instead of butter and all dark chocolate chips (needed to be lactose free).

These were great brownies, with that thick moist consistency that makes it hard to get out of the seat. However, instead of one banana I added two, whole, then mashed them with a fork to leave chunks.

So I slightly tweaked the recipe. Not on purpose more of, I suddenly forgot to pay attention. One I fully recommend using the pan size it says. I thought hmm that pans dirty right now... oh they just say that so you can have real thick brownies we'll us this one. No. They say that cause that's all the recipe makes. So double up for a bigger pan. Then I forgot to read melt the chocolate.. So I just put in the chips after adding the butter. All my slip ups aside the batter taste AMAZING! If you want "I just got dumped" pig out batter. I recommend this. They came out feeling a little squishy, probably because of my slip ups. Still it taste amazing. I love this recipe even with my mistakes.

These brownies were delicious. I made the changes suggested by the submitter of the recipe, and had to bake them longer than stated (closer to an hour). Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing! Replaced the butter by coconut oil (because of beef allergy) and cooked in mini muffin pan for 20 minutes to make brownie bites.

Can you substitute some of the butter with canola oil, since it's better for you? I realize all butter would taste the best, but how about half butter, half oil...would that work?

These were excellent. I'm always wary of "quick" or "easy" recipes because it sometimes means there isn't much to them flavor wise, but these were super moist and full of flavor. I used 2 eggs instead of 1 and used a high quality, dark chocolate for melting. I also added 1/2 cup of crushed hazelnuts.

This brownie is perfect!  For over a year, I've been trying several different brownie recipes a month... this is the best one so far.  The texture is absolutely wonderful.  I made the recipe exactly according to directions, except I added 1/3 c. semisweet chocolate chips to the batter right before baking.  So good!

These were super moist! The banana was delicious and useful! I brought to a friend's BBQ and they thought it was weird at first, then they tired it- and loved it! If you love bananas- try it! It tastes like a chocolate dipped banana! MMmmm

I thought this would be horrible!!  The only thing that is horrible is..........I am going to eat the whole pan.  These were really easy and are great with vanilla ice cream.  I made these more like blonde brownies, I did not melt the chips into butter I just mixed eveything together.

Absolutely delicious!!  I added some extra 1/3 cup chocolate chips -- perfect!  Definitely don't overbake them.  I took them out after about 25 minutes - they were slightly underdone and gooey in the middle!  RAVE reviews.  Great texture!

I double this recipe and bake in a 9x13 pan using the original poster's adjustments per her comment. It comes out to sweet glorious perfection every time! I think the only change I make is to use a little extra banana for the extra banana flavor (my personal taste). The double recipe in the 9x13 does require a little extra time in my experience; 40-50 has been the winner, testing every few minutes around the 40 minute mark. I have never been particularly good at baking, but this is one recipe I can handle that has never turned out less than perfect!

This is probably one of my favorite ways of using up an overripe banana! These came out chewy and chocolatey and delicious. I added a half cup of chopped walnuts and did as other reviewers suggested and added an extra egg. It took 45 minutes for them to bake completely. I liked the banana taste as a variation from every other brownie, but only gave it 4 stars because when I'm in that brownie eating mood and nothing but a fudgy brownie will do, I prefer a traditional "plain" brownie. But I will definetly be remaking these whenever I have a banana I need to use up!!

I did make a couple changes. I made these dairy free by using oil, but used only 1/4 cup. I replaced the chocolate chips with peanut butter straight out of the jar. I also omitted salt. I mixed the peanut butter and oil and followed the recipe from there on and only made one more minor adjustment before baking which was adding some chopped walnuts. I used a greased cupcake pan instead of an 8x pan. I baked them for a shorter amount of time. ( about 20 min ) they were delectable! They were nice and chewy and the walnuts gave them a very nice crunch to break up the smooth texture of the rest of the brownie! The flavor was very much so peanut butter with a hint of banana. Thank you for the recipe!

Amazingly moist, rich and delicious, as well as super easy.  They're even good without the walnuts.  Served with frozen vanilla yogurt.

I've only had a little taste so far as they just came out of the oven, but I would diffidently recommend if you have banana's that are going bad and you just don't care for boring banana bread (which I am so sick of). They don't call for much banana and I had over 5 banana's that are going old, so I added two banana's and didn't change the recipe at all besides that. I also put the brownies into a mini cupcake tin  which helped them cook faster and they become more crunchy (if you like crunchy food like me).  Diffidently would recommend.

I doubled the recipe as I did not have an 8x8" pan, I also mixed  ideas from another recipe, used cocoa powder instead of the chocolate squares and added baking powder. I am in Thailand so large bananas are not often available. Bananas here are smaller and thin skinned but often sweeter. I used 3 bananas, the result was good moist, slightly more cake like brownies.

The brownies were just a bit too dense and rich for my taste.

Too cakey. I was looking for a fudgier brownie. I don't know if I just eat too much banana bread or something but was tired of the banana flavour, just wanted straight ChOCoLatE! if u like a little fluff in ur brownie this is a nice recipe but i`ll keep searching for my perfect chewy bite..
