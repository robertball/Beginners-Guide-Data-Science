Just delicious. I didn't have lemon so I just used a little more vanilla in the cheese as well as more sugar and it was great. I also don't own a little torch so I put it under the broiler for a few seconds. However that didn't harden the sugar because the cheese started melting before the sugar crystallized. No matter. It tasted amazing anyway. Will make this again. I wish I had taken a picture because it looked so nice.

What a great dessert! I made the shortcakes from "Buttermilk Strawberry Shortcake" (also from this site), and used frozen strawberries and blueberries (as that's what I had on hand). It turned out delicious! I can only imagine how good it would be using fresh berries! The mascarpone/brulee really puts this over the top. Would make this again in a heartbeat!
