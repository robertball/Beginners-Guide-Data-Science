Good base recipe. Definitely take the time to read the "most helpful" reviews before making this dish. Changes I made to the dish (taken from the other reviewers) use only 1/2 of the noodles called for (6 oz), slightly undercook them since they will be cooking longer in the oven, half the broccoli, mushrooms and onions, roast the chicken rather than boil the flavor out of it, add about 1 cup of chicken broth to keep it creamy, double the cheese and mix it within the dish,add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, sautee all of the veggies (onion, garlic, celery, mushrooms, and broccoli) in a tablespoon of olive oil until just starting to soften, top with something crunchy (I used potato chips). I also covered the casserole for 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15. It is a great recipe as doctored-probably just okay as written.

My roommates LOVED this recipe, although I hoped that it would be saucier. I used frozen chopped broccoli (no mincing for me), and substituted a can of cream of chicken and broccoli soup for one of the chicken ones. I would recommend adding water like other reviews said, and sauteeing the onion first (unless you like it crunchy). Before baking I added seasoned bread crumbs for a bit of crunch. This recipe makes a TON of servings- good for big crowds (or very hungry ones).

This is the first time I've written a review, but I've been a member to site for awhile and I've tried a few recipes. The fact that I decided to write a review should say it all. My husband and I loved this recipe. I used chicken quarters (it was on sale) but I forgot to use the broth as some other reviews had mentioned, but I will next time, as I agree the original recipe doesn't make as much as a sauce as I'd like.  I added green peppers, more cheese (my husband loves anything with cheese) and added milk twice through baking. I also didn't boil my noodles that long because I knew I wanted to cook it a little bit longer. I can't say enough, this recipe is wonderful!

This was a huge hit tonight with the few modifications others had suggested. I used 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom AND 1/4c milk as the sauce would have been too thick otherwise. I also sauteed the onions, broccoli and celery along with minced garlic and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. Cheese in the sauce and on top... I will be making this quite often!

We LOVED this.  I halved the recipe since there's only my husband and I, and there was still plenty to fill a 9x13 pan.  I did add about 1/2 cup water because of the other reviews and it was SPLENDID.  I used the water that I boiled the chicken in.  Marvelous, subtle chicken flavor, and celery and mushrooms made a great addition.  (I didn't have paprika so I sprinkled parsley on top instead.)

I have made this recipie three times. The first time I did it as written, but it tasted too much like a can of soup to me. So over the next two tries I made a roux instead and tried different cheese combinations. In the end the winner is melting Kraft Italian blend cheese into the roux and then sprinkling shreaded Asiago cheese on top before baking. This is really exceptionally delicious when you make the sauce from scratch instead of using soup.

This recipe makes a lot! After reading the reviews I split it into 2 meals, and froze one batch. I used a large bag of frozen chopped broccoli, didn't have celery or mushrooms, but it was still good. A good recipe to serve to kids...they all liked it.

This was a good family pleasing recipe!  Everyone in the house loved it!  I did mix my cheese in and did not top with any cheese as my family does not like it when cheese hardens on a casserole-other than this-I followed the recipe and it was delicious!

I have been making this dish for a long time. It's awesome comfort food & my husband asks for it often! I do a little more cheese and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup.

This was so easy to put together because I made this entirely with leftovers. I had made a couple of roasted chickens with gravy the other night, so the gravy ended up taking the place of at least one can of soup. I agree that the recipe needed more liquid, so I added a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and some fat free half and half. Again, leftover broccoli, mushrooms and egg noodles filled the bill. Only had horseradish cheddar on hand which worked surprisingly well. I also topped the casserole with a bit of parm and some panko along with a bit of seasonings. This was so good Joanne and I thank you for not only a delicious recipe but an easy one to boot that helps so much with my busy Monday and Tuesday nights!

Very good tasting, but could have used a little more liquid.  I would add some water or an extra can of soup the next time.

Delicious! My husband says this one is a keeper! =) It was a little dry, but I will still give it 5 stars because it doesn't deserve 4! I think next time I will try adding a little more liquid, or covering it with tin foil as while it bakes! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

With the exception of omitting the celery (which I didn't have, and we don't like) I followed this recipe to a T and the result was less than favorable.  It was edible... but VERY bland.  We ended up adding a lot more seasonings to it, and it still was just okay.  Sorry, but this won't be one I'll make again.

delicious! i added an extra can of condensed soup, and i mixed the cheese inside, not on top. It turned out A LOT! i cooked it for my family of 4, and there will be leftovers... but I should have cooked it for my boyfriend and his roommate, and there'd be no leftovers, only 2 guys, bellies full and faces happy :)

I cooked the chicken in 2 qts chicken broth, and added the broth before baking. It turns out much juicier and has a great chicken flavor.

This was very good - I did follow some other reviewers' suggestions and added some chicken broth and some white wine to make it a bit "saucier." It was even better re-heated for lunch the next day!

I made this recipe with some of the suggestions of other reviewers.  Used the chicken stock to add to the Cream of Chicken soup.  Added garlic and some chopped green pepper with the mushrooms, onion and celery.  Softened the veges in a wok prior to adding chicken and  broccoli.  Used fettucini as I did not have egg noodles.  Suspect that it will be better tomorrow.

Definitely something you can play around with. I used 1 cream of chicken and two cream of celery (all I had), extra mushrooms, sauteed onions/celery, and probably 1 cup of cheese all together. I also baked about 15 minutes b/f putting cheese on. I think the cream of broccoli soup would be good next time. It takes a little while to put together but makes a lot of food. My b/f commented that he hoped it was good since it looked like we would be eating for a while. I have some for my lunch today. I will make again.

I would have given this 5 stars because it was very good but it did need a few things changed.  The next time I make it I will fry the onions and celery first in olive oil and perhaps add a little white wine more salt and pepper and poltary seasoning.  Then I bet it would get five stars.

Absoloutly fantastic! Wouldn't change a thing although I did cook the veggies before putting everything in the oven. I don't think it would have been cooked sufficently otherwise. Thank you!!

Kristi's Tetrazzini Haiku: "This was somewhat bland. Needed more than just 'pinches.' And more broccoli." Ingredient list said "two broccoli" which I could only assume was two florets, but I know that I used way more than that to qualify the green in this as our dinner vegetable. Boiling the chicken as well as only using a pinch of seasoned salt and a pinch of paprika resulted in a rather bland casserole. If I made this again, I'd have to saute the onion and celery 1st w/ some garlic, prepare the chicken in a different, more flavorful manner, and increase the seasoning.

This was pretty good but tastes very much like soup noodles.  The other flavors seem to get lost.  However, it's very easy to make and feeds a crowd.

i found this recipe to be a good one.  i also added extra cream of chicken and i didnt use mushrooms because of alergies. the only thing i will do different next time is boil the celery first because i dont like it hard and maybe sprinkle some italian bread crumbs on top.

I thought this was really good. It was real easy to make, it didn't take much time at all. I didn't put the onions in, and I think it tastes really good. I will make this one again.

This recipe was so easy to make and was delicious.  I don't cook much because I am very impatient but this took no time at all.

This dish was kind of bland . It was way better the next day. I would suggest adding  more cheese and also  whatever kind of spices you like. A little bit  of seasoning would  make a  Big difference.

Definitely a good recipe. Was hoping it would be a bit cheesier and creamier. I think next time adding in a can of broccoli and cheddar soup will move this up to five stars!

This is my favorite tetrazzini recipe.  I usually need to add more soup. I do saute the onions, along with red and green peppers, and shake a little crushed red pepper. We add garlic.  Parmesan is good on top, and we prefer fettuccini noodles.  It's worth it.

In all my years of cooking this is the first time I've ever made/had Tetrazzni, so I'm not sure how it is supposed to taste, but this was really good. It is a simple, everyday type meal that would be good on a cold night. Like another reviewer, I precooked the broccoli and celery until just barely tender.

I accidentally forgot to buy 2 cans of cream of chicken, so I substitued cream of celery. But the cream of celery was a bit dry, so I added a can of cream of mushroom. It was good, but a little too celery tasting for me (my fault though...).

My husband and I thought it was okay, but my 4 children were not impressed.  I probably won't make it again.
