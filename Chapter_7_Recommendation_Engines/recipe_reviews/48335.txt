This is excellent as is.
I live where White Fish is easily obtainable  fresh.  Like near White Fish Point near Brimley, Michigan in the beautiful Upper Penninsula.

I only have one extra comment on a comment.  PLEASE DO NOT COOK AT HIGHER HEAT as one suggested.  Fish do not need to be cooked at such high heat....an even 350*to 375* is perfect.  when fish is done, the coating turns brown, even in oil.  You do not want to over cook the outer, before the inner is done, or that "fishy" taste will come through.  be sure to skin it and remove the grey fat layer and blood line from it.  that is where any bacteria and fishy taste comes from, especially if it has been frozen.  take it from a 67 year old White Fish fisherman and connoisseur of fish chef......

I've used this recipe with snow cod several times and altered it a few times according to what I had on hand. I've ommitted the cayenne, used several different types of nuts and even none at all, used different mustards, sweetened coconut and black pepper, etc. Also, instead of baking it, I've pan fried it slowly until it turns crispy and golden. My husband is not a fish fan being from a state that doesn't get it very fresh while I crave seafood. We BOTH love this recipe and usually wish we had made more after it's done. Also, no matter the alterations, it's always tasty although the original is great as well.

Really unique flavor! Such a great, crunchy coating, but the healthiness of a baked (not fried) dish. I'll sub f-f sour cream for the mayo next time to go a little healthier. Uses on-hand ingredients, and is super-quick to fix!

I highly recommend this!  Fish is hard to cook, but this recipe was easy and it came out perfect.  I made a few changes to suit my family's taste.  I used tilapia.  I reversed the quantities on the breadcrumbs and mixed nuts (so there were more nuts and less breadcrumbs); I also added extra coconut.  It came out great, absolutely delicious, and the kids loved it!  Next time I may try Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe - this will be a staple in our household!

I mixed the dry spices with the wet ingredients instead of dry, and I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  Simply delicious.

I substituted Miracle Whip for Mayonnaise, used Zesty French's Deli mustared, used sweetened flake coconut that was 6 months expired, used just a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, used only chopped pecans (all I had on hand), used less sugar and salt than called for in the recipe, and baked it at 400 instead of 375 ('cause fish needs to bake at high heat.)  It still tasted great!  Whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night. WOW, this was awesome. My kids loved it. I sed chopped pecans as I did not have mixed nuts and I used paprika so it wouldn't not be too zippy for my little one. Also, I used mustard w/honey instead of brown mustard. Thanks for sharing!!

I love this recipe. I quite often substitute basa fillets for the cod and use almonds or cashews only for the mixed nuts. I also use dijon mustard with a low-fat mayo and it still tastes great.  This one is easy to make and tastes wonderful. I cut down on the cayenne pepper (to 1/4 tsp.) because of my children but would love to try it full spice.

I used catfish with this recipe and served with jasmine rice rice and coconut curry. I followed the directions exactly, and while the catfish came out perfect, I personally felt like the brown mustard was a little overpowering. I had to spoon my curry onto the fish to help mask the strong mustard aroma. It did the trick, and the coconut fish complimented the curry very well, but I don't think I could have eaten it by itself. I also was slightly put off by the texture, the batter was soft coming out of the oven- not crispy. Of course I should have known better considering that this was oven baked and not fried. I try to avoid frying at all costs, but sometimes certain foods are just best that way.

I liked this recipe it was fairly easy, I tossed the fish in a baggy with the mayo/mustard mixture to make it easier.  I also had to make a sauce with it otherwise I would have found it a bit bland.  I stirred orange marmalade, dijon mustard and horseradish to taste and put this on the side, very good

I used cornflakes in place of the bread crumbs and as I used sweetened flaked coconut I omitted the sugar, I also dredged my fish in flour before I dipped it in the mayonaisse mixture.  Everyone loved it.

I used haddock to make this. It is definitely a very interesting recipe! The flavour of the crust was incredible. Assuming the coconut would be sweet enough, I didn't add any additional sugar. I also used ground almonds instead of mixed nuts. I wanted my crust to be a nice golden brown, so I pan fried it in a little coconut oil instead of putting it in the oven. My husband and I both liked this quite a bit, but thought there was a little too much mustard flavour. Next time I'll cut that in half.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I made it with cod, and my friend called it a "keeper".   I'm going to try it with catfish next.

Too much salt and too much mustard.  I would cut them both in half and add more coconut to balance the salty/spicy with a little more sweet.  I ate it with a mango salsa which went really well.

This was Soooo Good!!! i changed it a little bit to make it healthier though.  first i threw it in some whole wheat flour, then into some beaten eggs with 1 tbl mustard and some pepper mixed in instead of mayo mixture, then into the coconut/ almond/ chile/ 1/4Cup bread crumb mixture.  I omitted the sugar and didn't have cayenne but crushed chile worked just as well. much healthier and everyone LOVED IT!
Thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  I love fish with a nutty coating.  I used Talapia and used more nuts than breadcrumbs.  I would cut down on mustard next time, but otherwise, fabulous. Highly recommend.

This was a very good recipe! I love the crispiness of the coconut and the blend of seasonings! The mayo/mustard mix made the fish ultra moist, which made me unable to stop eating it!! YUM! THanks! I will use this over and over !

PHENOMENAL! Restaurant worthy! I added a sprinkle of garlic powder but otherwise left the recipe as it is. I ended up using frozen Swai fillets.
Fish was juicy and tender while the coating, well the coating just MAKES it! A burst of flavor!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe is and my boyfriend and I fell in love with this dish, it is simple and very tasty!!  We had some apricot preserves that we put on top before eating, and it complimented the fish very well, we also on one piece tried some duck sauce we had on hand and it was very good with that also, I highly recommend this to everyone.  I am baking it again tonight for my dad, a true test!  I am taking the suggestion of another review and switching the measurements of the crumbs and nuts and adding more coconut.

Although a lot of previous posters thought the mustard to Mayo ratio was too much mustard I kept it that way...my dijonaise is usually half n half. I do use a mild grainy mustard though. I did cut the salt and red pepper in half though...not much needs more than a half tsp of salt to bring out the flavor and I did not want to overpower the delicate fish and coconut with too much heat.like many other posters...I put the spices in the wet stuff.

This was really good.  However, I would caution you on the heat of thecayenne and saltiness.  It was a little off-putting.  But minimizing that and upping the nut/coconut a bit might make it a 5-star next time.  I'll keep ya posted.  G-Man in Bellevue, NE :D

This is delicious. I left out the coconut and cayenne and used a dark stoned ground mustard. The salted mixed nuts with panko bread crumbs were just right. I used a captain cut cod and baked an extra 5 minutes as we like fish a little more done. I fixed it one night and my husband wanted me to fix it again the next night.

Very good recipe!  I used Panko Crumbs instead of bread crumbs and Dijon mustard... I couldn't find brown mustard.  My entire family enjoyed it!

Wow!!! This one is good enough to impress the most discriminating palate!    Definitely one for company.   Just the right amount of sweetness from the coconut, with a slight zing from the cayenne.   Thanks for a great recipe Missbic!!!

This was good, hubby says 3.5 to 4, I say 3 to 3.5!  Ued pickerel and baked at 400 for about 22mins.  I used ground almonds and had to make my own breadcrumbs.  As coconut tends to be sweet enough, I opted out of adding the sugar and also decided to leave out the salt as I didn't think it was needed.  Used a combo of yellow/whole grain dijon mustard and used Miracle Whip as I don't buy 'mayo'.  Despite leaving out the sugar, I did find this somewhat sweet.  Overall, decent recipe.

I tried this with whitefish, largemouth bass and walleye.   It was great but only after reduction of cayenne to a pinch.  I also increased the temp to 400 @ 18- 20 min

Very good recipe.  Since the mayo and mustard mixture are used primarily as “glue” for the crust, I used fat free Miracle Whip instead of mayo. No added calories and tastes great. I also recommend using very fresh, moist coconut. I agree with another reviewer to increase temp to 400 degrees. When the fish is done, the crust is lightly browned.

I prepared this exactly as the recipe was written.  The mustard flavor was extremely overpowering. We all ended up scrpaing the coating off to eat the fish. I may try to make it again and cut the mustard.

This dish has become a standard in my menu planning.  I modified the recipe by substituting horseradish for the mustard.  I used panko for bread crumbs.  I had a 2lb bag of frozen cod.  I "sliced" off the seal of frozen water and prepared the fish while still frozen.  I then placed the individual portions in a zip lock bag so I could have a portion as a quick meal.  Next time I'm going to try to use some wasabi.  The mayonnaise serves as an oil to cook the fish and gives it good flavor.  

This is a winner of a recipe

Delicious! OK, I've never rated a recipe, but because this is so delicious I feel obligated! 
Great Tips: use the sour cream instead of mayo. Panko bread crumbs are  best and I used 1/4 tsp cayenne (my family doesn't like as spicy)! 
Everyone from my 7 yr old  to my husband  enjoyed.

Both of my boys have braces so I substituted the nuts with panko crumbs - no other changes made.  Used on catfish.  If I were able to, I'd give it ten stars.  Deeeelicious.  Thanks Missybic!

This was way too salty for my whole family.  I do tend to cook low salt for health reasons.  I did measure.  So next time we will cut the salt in half.

This turned out SOOOO good, maybe the best fish I've ever made.  I thought I had prepared mustard but all I had was spicy Guldens so it turned out quite spicy, but it was awesome.  I used Panko bread crumbs and really pressed a good crust into the fish and it was crispy and sweet and SO easy.  This is my new favorite fish recipe - I'll make it at home before I'll go out for it!

Very yummy! I did make one change, instead of mayo/ mustard I just dipped the fish in one egg before coating. I will use more coconut next time because I really like coconut and I didn't find it very coconut-ty. The nutty flavor was good though.

The only thing I measured was the mayonnaise and mustard.  I used less bread crumbs and more coconut; just dumped to my liking.  I used what I had left of slivered almonds.  This was an easy, tasty and crunchy fish.

This was SO good! I used dijon mustard and almonds, since that's what I had on hand and due to a gluten-free family member, I used corn flakes instead of bread crumbs. I followed another reviewers advice and stirred seasonings into wet ingredients instead of dry. I reduced the amount of cayenne and next time I would reduce the salt some. I think more of the seasonings make it onto the fish, when included in wet ing. I made this with tilapia, but think it would work well with cod, too. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great base recipe. I added sesame seeds to the coating and also recommend a nice coconut-based lime sauce to finish it. Then it was perfect served over short grain brown rice. Healthy too!

This was superb! I used Talapia,didnt have brown mustard but instead used Boars Head savory remoulade cajun style mayo(yummy) along w regular mayo.Also used sliced almonds.I omitted cocunuts due to allegies so instead increased sugar to 6T.  This is a keeper in my home.

Husband helping, used Colemans Mustard, knew it needed toning down, so dipped in buttermilk, then the crumbs (Panco). It was wonderful. There went a $4 jar of Colemans.

Great recipe. And super easy. I used talapia instead of whitefish, pecans instead of mixed nuts, and panko bread crumbs. I did cut back on the mustard and cayanne a little. The combination of the coconut, pecans, and cayanne really works well. My entire family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

A wonderful "change" for a fish dinner.....It is also great for those "not fish" people.....there is so much flavor they forget that it is fish!!!!!!! I didn't have mixed nuts so I used peanuts.....still wonderful....

I used sole filets, and it was super delicious! I used chopped peanuts instead of mixed nuts, and all I had was the sweetened coconut, and I used dijon mustard, and they turned out extremely delicious! Will definitely make again, though it did have a bit too many points for my weight watchers than I would have liked, 11 per serving.

I was really looking forward to this recipe as the reviews were fairly good.  But I found the mustard a bit overwhelming (and I love mustard!), and the sweetness from the coconut was too rich.  I might make it again, but I'd definitely cut down on the mustard and the coconut.

This was good, but I was disappointed it was neither as nutty or as coconutty as I had hoped.  I would use less bread crumbs in the mix next time.

This was a tasty recipe for whitefish.  Different, but very good.  Didn't have any nuts, so left out.  I think I would bake at a higher temp next time to help the breading get a little more crisp.  Since I used sweetened coconut, I didn't add the tsp of sugar.  Didn't have brown mustard, so used yellow (think it would taste better with brown).  A nice, quick and easy recipe.

Loved the flavors of this recipe. I used frozen flounder and baked the fish for forty minutes or until it flaked easily, covering the baking dish lightly with foil for the last fifteen minutes.

I thought the base recipe was good. the mustard was a little strong. I'll make some tweaks for next time: less mustard, mix spices with wet ingredients, more nuts/less bread crumbs. but overall, very tasty!!

Made this last night for our friends on a casual dinner evening. It was a huge success. I used a garlic mayo aioli rather than plain mayo. My biggest issue was the mayo+mustard is really thick; when coating the fish I had to scrape excess mayo+mustard off each piece before dragging through the breadcrumb mixture. Also, this has a bit of a kick to it; if your guests aren't into spicy food you may want to cut back on the cayenne.

My husband really likes this dish.  I used walnuts this time and liked the flavor better than the last time when I used almonds.  I cut the mustard in half, otherwise follow the recipe as directed.

I used Cod and pecans and half mayo/half Greek yogurt.   I took another reviewer's advice and mixed all the ingredients in a bowl.  Absolutely delicious.  I will be making this again and again.  I made this in my toaster oven set to 400 and the top was beautiful and crispy.  I will be using this recipe often on various types of fish.

Excellent recipe; used it with lake trout and it was delicious. The only change I will make for next time will be to reduce the amount of salt. Thanks!

This recipe is one of my new favorites. The coconut & bread crumbs add a nice sweet crunch to the fish filets. Serve this with a salad & rice & you've got yourself a delicious healthy meal! Enjoy!

Very good recipe!  We would definitely make this again.  I followed directions exactly except I put it under the broiler for a minute or two to crisp up the top and I did follow another persons comments and used less dijon mustard.  I think I would use even less next time.  I would cut it in 1/2.  I served it with carrot rice from this site, but omitted the peanuts from that recipe.  I also used coconut oil instead of the butter.  *Note* My husband doesn't like coconut too much and he really liked it too.  The coconut offers sweetness and crunchy, but not too strong of flavor.

I used chitpole pepper mustard because it was all I had but still was just the right amount of heat.  Wasn't sure I'd like the nuts but it gave the breading a unique flavor.  Will make again.

ok, so I made this for the first time.  My fish was a bit on the wet side, so make sure you dry them off.  I think that was part of my problem.  I don't think 375 for my oven was hot enough, so I put it up to 400 after a bit as it was not cooking well.  I flipped the fish over loosing most of the coating which was my fault, but I like to cook both sides.  I will make sure my pan has more oil next time too.  Despite my frustration and mess it still tasted great.  My husband raved about it, and wants it often.  Thanks for recipe!

This is absolutely delicious, and tastes like it's much more complicated to make than it actually is! My poisson of choice: mahi mahi! I omit the salt, use all almonds instead of mixed nuts, and use panko bread crumbs instead of standard, and WOW, what a flavor!

I used homemade breadcrumbs from thin slices of sourdough bread, baking them at 375 degrees until they were golden and crisp. I recommend reducing salt by a team least half because the mustard & mayo also add salt; next time I'll try cutting the salt by half. My whole family loved this, thanks do much for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and like another reviewer I found the mustard to be overpowering and the coating did not get crunchy enough. Not bad, but just not scrumptious.   I made a lot and wound up using it for fish sandwiches.

I liked it however it was a bit too sweet for my taste.I have a huge sweet tooth but it didn't seem right with fish. I will make it again, cutting the coconut either fully or perhaps in half and adding more crushed nuts. The fish was very moist.

This fish dish was fantastic. I did omit the salt, and also used unsweetened coconut, with a ground pecan and almond for the nuts. I used a light white basa fish, and the taste was perfect. Will definitely be making this again!

This fish was so-so if you aren't one for strong flavors. My husband, who loves spicy food and lots of flavor, really enjoyed it. I thought there was WAY too much mustard (and I even left a bit out). Almost to the point that I had to scrape a lot of it off. I would have also added more coconut - I couldn't really taste it much. I will make it again, just will probably make some changes.

I don't know if my son and I have a problem with our taste buds but we could not eat this... I think it my fault because I added a little bit of honey into the mustard-mayo mix... anyway even without the honey this combination is just to weird for us...

This was good and very moist.  It would be hard to mess up fish cooked this way.

I will make it again,but I will tweak it.

1.  Dijon mustard instead of brown.  It didn't have the kick we were looking for.
2.  A lot more coconut.  I wasn't getting coconut at all.
