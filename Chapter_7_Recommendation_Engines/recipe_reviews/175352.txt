Okay, 5 stars based on how I made them.  Cut the buttermilk to 3/4C, used 1.25C flour, 1.25t baking powder, four bananas and about 1/2T honey.  Really, really good; lots of banana flavor, moist and fluffy.  This made about 12 6" pancakes.  Next time, I may add some oatmeal as well.

it worked out to be too liquidy and the flavour while nicely flavoured with banana was not favoured by the family....will not try this again.

I can't give full stars, since I did some tweaking, but this is a good base. I increased the flour by 1/2 a cup, I used whole wheat flour and added vanilla and 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the batter, as well as a pinch of nutmeg. The result was pretty spectacular. My family asks for these every Sunday.

Ok, don't know why this gets such poor reviews! I followed the tweaking given in the reviews, used 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1 1/4 tsp double acting baking powder, and 4 over-ripe bananas. These were fluffy, with the creamy banana in the middle and full of banana flavor, plus they smelled fricken' awesome when cooking! Here's a hint people: when mashing the bananas use an actual "masher", not a blender or food processor. Also mix this by hand with a wisk, not a hand mixer. That's how this becomes too liquidy. Don't over mix, just mix until all the dry ingredients are incorporated and the batter is lumpy. Let the batter stand while you get your skillet heated up ( 1-3 minutes). Also make sure you grease your skillet or pan and use low to medium heat, otherwise these will get burnt before they are done in the middle. Follow these tips and this recipe WILL be awesome! Next time I'm gonna put cinnamon and chopped nuts in it and it'll kick butt!

These came out way too runny! I would reccomend using 1/2 the amount of buttermilk or making them into crepes instead.   They did have great flavor though!

Batter was too liquidy so I added more flour.  There just wasn't much taste to it at all.  The only salvaging this recipe was adding chocolate chips.  Never again!

I made these pancakes mainly to get rid of bananas and buttermilk . . .now I have a stack of pancakes I have to do something with (I may freeze them) LOL!  I read through all of the reviews prior to making and I have to agree that there's way too much liquid in this.  So, I cut it down to 1 c like another reviewer.  I had four bananas to use, so I just mashed them all and added a bit more flour, baking powder, added sugar (about 2 tspns) and vanilla and cinnamon.  they turned out really good--tons of banana flavor in every bite, and not too sweet or too bland.  I have to say, though, that since I made so many modifications I'm not sure how close to the original recipe this is; it's definitely one you have to tweak to what works for you.  thanks for the recipe!

There is nothing awsome about these pancakes.  I evne followed the tweeks that some one else did.  Decrease the buttermilk, add honey and added baking powder. My husband said these are not a keeper.  But on a positive note the kids liked them alot.

Only 1 cup of flour to 2 cups of buttermilk made for a very soupy batter, and these pancakes were certainly not fluffy.  The addition of a little vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar helped a little with flavor,

i thought the flavor was great, i used the "most helpful positive review" tweeks, and it made really good crepes....not really pancakes though...but put some homemade gingerbread whipped cream in here and you've got yourself an awesome breakfast/brunch

There is NOT too much liquid.  That part is just right.  I added about a tablespoon of coconut oil, a good dash of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Used 1/2 teaspoon each of baking powder and soda.  These are very moist pancakes.  With my adaptations, I'd give this a 4 star rating.

These were not fluffy, they were soggy. Not enough flour and not enough baking powder.

Not sure what I did wrong, but it was entirely too liquidy--the first pancake came out more like a crepe. I had to more than double the dry ingredients to make the rest come out looking more like pancakes.  Other than that, they were OK. Won't use this recipe again.

Not having tried the tweaks I don't care for the recipe.  my pancakes came out, well, flat as pancakes.  The science didn't work this time. I guess I will stick to my buttermilk pancakes and springboard from there.  Thanks, however, for sharing!  This is how I have always learned to cook; trial and error!
