This recipe can be tinkered with-use 2 eggs to 1/8 c. of milk and cut back on the cinnamon to about 1/2 tsp. One way to mix the cinnamon in thoroughly is to mix all ingredients together EXCEPT the milk-add it last.

Not enough eggs and too much milk.

I gave this recipe a try and now I have to spend a half-hour trying to clean up the fried milk at the bottom of my skillet.

Soaking the bread for about 20 seconds a side will make the bread extremely soggy and impossible to toast in skillet. The final product was a doughy, messy substance.

If your french toast is soggy, your not cooking it all the way. Its pretty much impossible to cook it all the way on the stove top. Use 1 cup of milk and 3 large egg, add whatever else you like. dip each side of the bread in for 30 seconds, let it sit for 1 minute, then cook 3-4 minutes on each side. remove from pan, and cook in 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. 

The milk/egg mixture is just like a cuzstard. You have to cook it completly so its not a soggy mess!

This is a great, simple recipe that will work for anyone who chooses to actually read the reviews before trying it.  I have to laugh at everyone who experienced too much cinammon, or too soggy results.  You all should have read the reviews FIRST.

This recipe STINKS! It does not work at all. There is way too much milk and an outragous amount of cinnamon. Was this recipe some kind of joke or what? Whatever   you do don't EVER use this recipe. You will regret it.

This recipe is not worth making as it is written.  The cinnamon should certainly be a TEASPOON not Tablespoon.  Perhaps if you use a heavier type of bread 20 seconds in the egg mixuture might be OK.  2 thumbs down.

This recipe was horrible. It was so soggy and was so gross. I was looking for an easy french toast recipe. It wasted my time trying to make it. It didn't cook good at all because of the great amounts of milk. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.

Definetely too much milk and needs more egg. Another review was right... the first slice got WAY too much cinnamon compared to the rest. I made 3 slices, easily with the recommended amounts. TOO SOGGY!

Need to decrease the milk or increase the egg.  Also, I just dipped the bread to coat and didn't let soak.  Finally, I only used a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It was okay, but nothing to rave about.

First off, French Toast is something that really doesn't require  recipe. All you are doing is dipping very stale bread (although fresh is fine) in an egg milk mixture which should be more egg than milk. Some folks like their French Toast heavy on the cinnamon side, and others like it a little dry. I prefer my to have the texture of a custard which works even more if you use hallf and half, or light cream. I also recommend using butter in your skillet as opposed to oil.

This was an OK easy recipe with some glitches.  If you are using regular thin sliced bread, DO NOT soak.  Simply dip each side.  Reduce cinnamon to 1/2 Tsp per slice of bread but you might need to add more as the bread slices soak up the cinnamon floating on top.  Reduce milk to 1/4 cup per 2 slices of bread.  Fully cook on lower heat setting if it is burning on the outside and soggy on the inside.

Both my wife enjoyed this simple recipe.  Granted the bread is initially soggy however I just cooked it on a lower temperature and let it brown up slowly and had no problems.  If you don't enjoy a strong cinnamon taste, I would suggest cutting back on the required amount.

No need to soak for 20 seconds each side, they get very soggy. I'd suggest just brushing the mixture on to lightly coat. Otherwise tasted good (according to my husband)

Too much milk to egg ratio!  When I make French toast I use 4 eggs to about a 1/2 cream or half and half.  A teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Use a good heavy bread like French, Italian, Challah or croissants.  Dip bread in mixture about 10-15 seconds, then I press it against the bowl to press out some of the liquid.  Fry it in a skillet with canola oil or oil and butter mixture.

Mine gets nice and crisp without putting it in the oven.

If you only have white sandwich bread, cut it into 3 strips, and then dip it quickly, and put in hot pan.  Otherwise you will have a sloppy mess.  Cook them til they start to puff up and then turn.  You need more oil to cook them than other breads.

I did not care for this recipe. I've made this twice with the exact same results: it ends up caked in cinnamon, soggy on the inside.

Very quick and easy.  This is the basis for french toast and I have made it this way for years.  I do not let my bread soak, I just dip and fry.  My son asks for this all the time.

Okay, I SHOULD have read the reviews -- the one time I don't.  Flavor was good, but it definately needs more egg and less milk, or your toast WILL BE SOGGY.  Using thicker bread is also a good tip.

Rather hard to get fully crisp because it's on the soggier side, but it tasted really good. You really have to beat the liquid well before putting each piece of bread in to make sure the cinnamon is well mixed, otherwise it separates out. Next time, I'll probably try more egg and less milk, to see if it makes it less soggy.

I made it for my husband as he was bored from everyday's breakfast, he had just one and wasn't at all impressed. The result is really bland and not worth the hype. I doubt that this is the way french toast is meant to be.. Not recommended.

after reading the other reviews i decided to make a few adjustments.. i added another egg and cut milk to 1/2 cup. i mixed in the cinammon but it didnt mix very well. so after i placed it on the griddle i sprinkled some cinammon/sugar mixer on one side and it made it crisper and gave it alot more flavor.. my 3 yr old loved it.

I'm wondering if the "20 seconds" was a typo and it actually was supposed to be "2 seconds".  The inside was very soggy, so matter how long I cooked it.  I would suggest just dipping each side of the bread really quick, and using very THICK bread!  I used plain sandwich bread (like I usually do) and it did not turn out good at all.  I'll probably give it another whirl with my own  suggestions.

The title should be changed to French toast. I have made this very recipe several times for my family before ever seeing this recipe on here. I have made it with milk before and it cancels out the vanilla flavoring and neutralizes the cinnamon. Then all you taste is bread and egg. You don't want that. Take out the milk and you have a very delicious French toast.

There's 2 much cinnamon and milk in this recipe. The first 2 breads came out soggy that they fell apart (soaking 20 seconds) so I soaked for 2 seconds on each side.

I tried this recipe and there is way too much milk and not enough eggs. My toast came out all gooey when it was done. If there was less milk it would probably come out ok but otherwise it was the worst french toast I've ever had!

This was my first atempt at making french toast so I thought I did something wrong when my toast turned out soggy, but after now reading the reviews I know it wasn't my fault.  I will probably not make french toast by this recipe again.

I put the bread in the toaster first, used less cinnamon and did not soak it for 20 min. and still did not turn out well.  Will not make again.

Partially my fault for disregarding this recipe's rating, but I just had a terrible time making french toast. I've never made it before, and one of these days I really just need to copy all of my mom's recipes. I just wanted a simple, straightforward french toast. This looked like the one.

What's wrong with this recipe? The batter is way too thin. Soak even the stalest bread in this mix for 20 seconds on each side, and you will have a pulpy mess. I even used brown eggs and whole milk, so I imagine I had the thickest version of the batter. If you dare try this, make sure you have the heartiest bread you can get your hands on. Even a nice, thick 7-grain will fall apart if soaked more than a few seconds.

Can I give it half a star? I want to give it half a star.

I used 1/8 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup and only soaked the bread for 10 seconds.  I was worried it wouldn't be to good with potato bread, but it was fine.  It was soooo good with agave nectar.  I will make this again.

OK, but the only thing is that it says to let the bread soak for 20 sec.  That's WAY to long, and it didn't cook that well and turned out soggy when I let it sit that long.  Other than that, the others that I did not let sit for long turned out good.

I agree with one of the reviews in here. Take the Cinnamon down to 1Tsp, and when you put the bread in, do NOT leave it in for 20 seconds, that is WAY too long. Only put it in long enough to coat it. Depending on the size of the container you use, you should be able to coat the bread fully without having to flip it, and risking breaking the bread.   Recap: 1 TEASPOON of Cinnamon        Only leave the bread in for 5 seconds TOPS. Just long enough to coat the bread. Bon A'petite

I made the mistake of not reading reviews before making this.  Like a lot of people said, it was soggy, and even with a oiled pan, still tended to stick.  I would reduce the milk to about half a cup or so, and wouldn't soak it for more than 10 - 15 seconds.

However: the bread I used was partly stale, and the mixture actually did very well!  I suggest using staler bread and it would work much better.

Overall, I didn't like this recipe. I'm not sure if that was the correct amount of cinnamon, but two tablespoons of was too much for the recipe. No matter how long I cooked them, my toast stayed soggy. They were also very bland. I would not recommend this recipe.

Recipie is good although leaving bread to soak for 20 seconds is NOT a good idea! It leaves it soggy. So just dip the bread on each side and it will be really easy french toast! :)

I actually laughed when I read the quantity of each ingredient. I was even surprised that sugar was not an ingredient. Because I was making a lot anyway, I just used the same milk amount and did 5 eggs instead of 1. I also decreased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. You really need to use a mixer to get the cinnamon blended well. I added 1 tbsp of organic sugar, and I omitted the salt. I also like to dip mine in a little flour to get them crispy in the skillet! Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar, and YUM! I am surprised this recipe is even posted on this site. I have never had a bad recipe yet. Reading the reviews is what I always do first. It allows me to "play" with the recipe.

Too much milk.  Do not grill... or else your bread will be much too soggy.  Added more eggs (I normally do 2 cups of milk for 20 eggs...)

My Husband used the recipe

It gets a star for being easy.. but the end product is not good!! The bread is super soggy and there is far too much cinnamon. I was hungry and in a hurry and didn't take the time to read all the ratings, I wish I had.

i used this basic recipe and added my own twist besides only using vanilla i added a couple drops of ameretto and kahlua to make a tspn of flavor also eyeball the milk. 20 seconds is tOoO long to dip the bread for, just coat it on both sides thats all u need!! i enjoyed my breakfast! top'd it w/chocolate, maple syrup, powdered sugar and blue berries but make it ur own!!

This recipe is much better if you add one more egg. I would also suggest to just dip the bread in the mixture, not to soak it.

I found this recipe great.  I just used 2 eggs instead of 1 and I was able to cook about 6 slices of bread. If you tend to not like much cinnamon then don't use as much.  My husband really loved it.

This was not good at all.
Probably my fault for not knowing how to make french toast and looking on google for it. The amount of milk the recepie calls for must be a mistake, it's way too much.

I was so confused when my french toast was so soggy it wouldn't cook. I went back to the website to make sure I added the correct amount of ingredients. I thought to myself, someone really set out to ruin people's breakfast. So then i read the reviews. I guess that's kind of backwards but anyway...good thing i stopped after the first two slices.

Maybe I made it wrong, but just seemed like too much cinnamon.  Never got all the cinnamon to be absorbed by the milk.  First slice of bread had too much cinnamon on it.  By the third or fourth slice it wasn't too bad....

Yep, too much milk; too much cinnamon.  However, with a little more vanilla, a few more slices of brown bread and a recipe for blueberry sauce, it was great.  Don't hold the bread in for too long.  Count to 10 for each side:  that should do it.  I also used marg instead of oil.

try substituting flavored coffee creamer for the milk and leave out the cinnamon and vanilla.  It's the quickest way I know to make french toast.

To get the best results, I found that you have to use 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a pinch of salt. You must also remember to keep stirring as you put each ingredient in, and ADD THE MILK LAST! In addition, 20 seconds is a little too long to soak each piece of bread. I would recommend around 10. This revised recipe turned out perfectly, and it tasted great! My brother said it was some of the best french toast he has ever tasted :) It only took about 15 minutes, like it said it would. I would definitely make it again, only NOT how the original 2-serving recipe said!

if your franch toast came out soggy and doughy then someting is wrong with the way you are cooking it. i made mine it was ust fine. the flavor wasnt the best and i added eggs, used less milk, and added a little nutmeg and almond oil. this improved the flavor greatly!

Did not turn out right at all.  I made the mistake of not checking the reviews first before I tried this.  I found a better recipe "French Toast I" that called for 2 eggs and 2/3 cup milk and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla and salt to taste and I used texas toast.  My kids loved it and wanted more.

I have been using this basic recipe for years. I only use 1/4cu of milk and a1/2tsp of cinnamon and white sugar mix. Cook on stove top for 3-4 minutes on first side and 2minutes on second size. I also melt a little butter in the pan before cooking. Oooooh soooo good

This recipe could definitely use some improvements...  1/2 cup milk 2 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract 1 teaspoon Cinnamon, Ground 8 slices Cinnamon Swirl bread 2 egg  1. Beat egg, vanilla and cinnamon in shallow dish. Stir in milk.  2. Dip bread in egg mixture, turning to coat both sides evenly.  3. Cook bread slices on lightly greased nonstick griddle or skillet on medium heat until browned on both sides.

I've been making my french toast like this since I learned how to make it in seventh grade health class. To make it a little healthier, I use whole wheat bread and a little "skinnier" with fat free evaporated milk. I like to add nutmeg sometimes, too. French toast is just awesome, isn't it?

Today I wanted to make my Pop breakfast & this recipe came up. I wanted something easy & this really was a easy recipe. For me I used honey flavored bread & fat free milk to reduce the calories but they came out prefect & my Pop loved it.!

i was going to make a bunch for dinner this evening the ratio of milk to eggs is off. Too much milk made the bread very soggy and it stuck to the griddle. To much salt, i won't fix this again.

I found that for 2 servings, only half of each ingredient called for was needed, except for the egg. I also cooked each piece for around 35 seconds on medium heat. After adjustments, it was tasty!

Surely 1 tablespoon of cinnamon is an error in this recipe? I used just 1/4 TEAspoon...also I omitted the salt. Now that was easy french toast alright. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and served it with vanilla yoghurt and maple syrup. Yum!

Don't listen to the people who can't cook! I like this recipe as is - I'm single and don't cook for a lot of people. I made this in my cast-iron 8-inch skillet, and I don't like to waste my free-range eggs, being too expensive. I cooked my two slices of bread with the lid on my skillet, and it came out fine. I actually used the drippings from my sausage that I cooked, put the sausage patties on top of the french bread slices, and poured maple syrup on top of meat and all! Homemade McGriddles! Thanks for the easy, thrifty, and adaptable recipe.

My 8 year old made this for dinner tonight. It made 6 slices of french toast all told, and was wonderful with a dash of syrup!

Give it a try!Don't stress so much over the soak time, just plop it in the bowl of egg/milk mixture turn over and plop it on the griddle - perfect!

Not only does the bread get too soggy, but we did not care for the taste.  Check out the banana stuffed french toast instead.  Just omit the stuffing part if you don't want the toast filled.  I would have given this 0 stars but I have to select one.

This recipe was the worst french toast recipe I have ever used.  It was WAY too much cinnamon and soaking it for 20 seconds on each side made the bread too soggy.  Reduce the cinnamon by about 3/4 and only soak for 2 seconds and the recipe will be much better.

It turned out way too soggy.  Also the amount of cinnamon was way too much.

The pregnant spouse wanted French Toast, and I needed a quick and easy recipe for it.  20 seconds???!!!  Way too long to dip.  The mixture was very runny, and even after I barely dipped the bread, it still lacked much flavor.  Needless to say, we had cereal instead!  Go with the other reviewers' add-ins and then I am sure it will be great!

I used 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of milk (I used evaporated milk and it is great).  I added nutmeg. I will the next time. I was pleased.

This recipe is HEAVY on the cinnamon!!! When scaled to 10 servings, it called for 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon of the spice - horrible.  One tablespoon would have sufficed.  Use caution.

I've never made french toast with milk so I decided to try it.  Just no.  French toast does not need milk.  It makes it too soft and milky tasting.  Skip the milk next time.

Nice easy make. I used way less cinnamon, only one teaspoon, and this made breakfast a hit. I've never seen a toddler demolish 'toast' so fast!  Served with crispy bacon.

What 1tbsp. cinnamon-that's why too much.  3/4 milk, same thing.  this recipe supposed to be for 2 slices of bread, I used 2 pcs. and 1/2 of a mini baguette not to waste to mixture.  It tasted ok though.

Made it for Father's Day. Was tasty but changed the 20 sec on each side to dunking it in once and putting it on the pan. Also did 4 minutes each side before I actually took them off the pan and onto a plate.

Okay, I took some of the recommendations from a few of you and did this:  2 eggs, 1 can evaporated milk (which was a little bit less than 3/4 cup, so use milk if you have to), 1t vanilla, 1 lite teaspoon of cinnamon and 6 slices of bread.  (I actually forgot the salt, so add it if you like - it tasted all right without it.)  This was really delicious and i'll make this one again.

If you follow the adaptations in the reviews it would be much better. However if you follow the provided recipe without alterations it's way too much milk, as we are rating the recipe and NOT the review versions it just gets a 1. )=

Way too much cinnamon, too much milk, too much wrong. The bread was soggy and took a long time to cook. Even when cooked, it was still a soggy mess. Definetely not the fluffy french toast I was envisioning. All I could taste was cinnamon.

Way too much milk & cinnamon, to egg ratio.  Soaking time of bread depends on the type of bread selected. I find the use of home made or whole grain bread produces a delicious result and it takes longer to absorb a reasonable coating.

I just made this using sugggestions from the other reviewers. My 2 year old ate 2 slices and five year old, who is a little of a picky eater, ate one and asked to have it for lunch. I used 2 eggs, 1/8 cup milk, and only 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I didn't soak the bread for 20 seconds, just enough to coat both sides and it didn't seem soggy.

This recipe was not good.  Way too runny, way too much cinnamon.  I would not suggest soaking the bread for 20 seconds on each side.

This recipe really helped me out. Although some of the measurements are off, it really is easy and still turned out decently and I'll be able to adjust this to better suit my taste next time.   Thanks a lot~ :D

The perfect little recipe for Quick and Easy French Toast. I had this cooked for my husband and myself and eaten in about 20 minutes.

This was actually pretty good. my roommate and I are your typical poor college students. this morning we woke up starving and had only one egg, some bread, and milk. well this recipe was perfect. though we did use pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon. but that improv was great!

We didn't think this recipe was anything special. The kids only ate it because they have to eat, and I tried to eat it because I told the kids to. I'm not sure what specifically it is, but it's missing something.

Needs to modify. My suggestions are two eggs, one quarter cup of milk, and a teaspoon of cinnamon for two (2) Servings. Other than that, the recipie was pretty sound

If you like it SOGGY in the middle and burnt around the edges, this one is for you. 1 EGG to 3/4 CUP milk is absurd as is the 1 TABLESPOON of cinnamon.  Look through the other reviews.  It's definiately a LOVE-HATE thing on this recipe.  I would have given it a negative score, but that's not allowed, so the 3 star average is artificially high.  Keep searching, though.  There are better recipes on here.

There was nothing good about this one.  
Like many others, I didn't read the reviews until I was in the midst of making it.  This *sounded* similar to one I used to make when I was in middle school, but it's far from it.

This turned out done-looking on the outside, but absolute MUSH inside.  I cut back on the cinnamon and without it there's NO FLAVOR whatsoever.  

Don't bother.

Forgot to read the reviews... You people are so right. I also want to point out that it somehow has 3 stars (at the time of this writing) which is very misleading. Careful how you rate things.

I just can't get my French Toast to be crispy on the outside like it is when you get it in a restaurant. My French toast is never soggy, but it doesn't have the crispiness that I'm always looking for. I usually use Texas Toast, I've also used French Bread.

this was exactly what i was looking for. although, i did'nt soak mine for 20 seconds after reading others reviews. i was able to make 5 slices of french toast with this recipe by only soaking mine for about 4 seconds. they tasted great and were not soggy at all. maybe next time though i will add less cinnamon.
