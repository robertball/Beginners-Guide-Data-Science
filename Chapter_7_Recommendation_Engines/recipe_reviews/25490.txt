Simple and Delicious.
I did make the following changes from the recipe:
Rice - Do not use instant and cook in chicken broth before putting all ingredients together. (2 cups of chicken broth for every cup of dry rice)
Chicken - Instead of canned, I used the breast meat from a rotisserie by simply pulling it off the bone.
Broccoli - I used fresh broccoli, chopped it and steamed until tender.
Cheese - I used half shredded cheddar and half crumbled Velveeta.

Then mix all ingredients together and add salt, pepper, and garlic salt (I used Lowry's) to taste.

This dish turned out no where near bland!

**TIP: Don't skip the onion. It adds just the right amount of flavor!**

With some help, this is a winner.  A pound of processed cheese is enough to overwhelm any meal, and the canned chunk chicken is not so good either.  Here's how we make it:  Bake 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and shred.  Make rice in our rice cooker just like always, then scoop 2/3 of the cooked rice into the 9 X 13 pan with the chicken.  (Our rice cooker calls for 3 cups uncooked to be used so we save the rest of the rice to make rice pudding so nothing goes to waste.  It's also cheaper than instant rice)  Then I take 16 oz of whatever cheese I have in the house and shred it.  1/2 Jack and 1/2 cheddar work great.  Add a packet of onion soup mix INSTEAD of chopping onions, then 2 cans of whatever condensed creamy soups you like (we use 1 chicken and 1 brocoli), a cup of milk, the butter, and a bag of frozen brocoli.  Then we top with sliced provolone cheese which we always have in the house anyway, and bake as per instructions.  Between the soups, cheeses, and dry soup mix, no additional salt or pepper is necessary.

My husband and I love this recipe, although I did adapt it to use fresh broccoli, 8 oz each finely shredded cheddar and mozzarella, and half of a rotisserie roasted chicken. I have made it several times and it is one leftover that is gladly eaten.  It really does freeze well. I make several small casseroles at a time.

5 Stars because it is super easy, super quick, super yummy, and all 4 kids LOVED it, even my green-aversion kid who doesn't eat veggies.  To make it even faster and easier, I used a rotisserie chicken from my grocery store and just pulled that off the bone, did not pre-cook the rice (instead put it in the casserole dry and added one can of low-sodium chicken broth to the mix), and used 1 package of shredded velveeta and 1 package of shredded sharp cheddar.  A few grinds of the pepper mill, a loaf of garlic bread and a tossed salad...dinner was complete.  Great meal for a busy mom.  Thanks for sharing.

Quick and easy!!! These changes made it absolutely perfect: Half an onion, clove of garlic, and 3 chicken breasts cooked in a frying pan on low heat.  When chicken was cooked, i cut it up and dumped the whole frying pan, onions, garlic and all, into the casserole dish. Used 1 cup grated cheddar cheese, 1 can cream of Chicken, and 1 can Cream of Broccoli and Cheese *which is why I used less grated*.  Half cup milk, half cup sour cream, lots of pepper, a bit of salt, a few shots of hot sauce (we love it) 3 cups rice and 4 cups steamed fresh broccoli.  Cooked for 30 mins on 350, pulled out and crumbled Ritz crackers over top (the cheddar ones) And cooked for another 10 mins.  FABULOUS! Thank you!!

This recipe was good but needed a little adjusting. I decided to put a little less cheese and some more chicken because it was a bit too cheesy. One of my guests said "You may get a bite of chicken or rice but it all tastes like cheese" After the adjustments it was wonderful and simple to make.

Excellent.  My husband LOVED this and asked me to put it in our regular dinner rotation.  I increased the rice to 3 cups since I found 2 cups to be too soupy.  I also used 4 chicken breasts instead of canned and 22 ounces of broccoli.  Omitted the onion since we neither one like onion but did add onion powder since we like the flavor.

This recipe was delicious and extremely easy!  If you’re in a hurry, this is the casserole for you.  I did, however, make some changes.  I used 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese.  I also used cream of broccoli and cream of chicken soup.  Curry powder, black pepper  & paprika added a kick, and I baked it for an additional 15 minutes to heat it all the way through.  My husband loved it, and we had plenty of leftovers!

Pretty good meal.  Due to the "soupy" complaints, I added an extra cup cooked rice and instead of raw onions, I took the advice of adding a packet of onion soup mix.  Good mix of flavors and very filling.  Would make again.

Entire family went back for 2nds.  Cut the recipe in half but used fresh broccoli, cut up baked chicken, used extra cheese and only one can of soup, mushroom soup.  Also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  This was so good and the little bit that was left over was even better the next day.

Excellent meal, my husband loved it. I did make a few changes as suggested by others. I used Basmati rice because I love the flavor. I cooked it in 2 cans of chicken broth and 1/3 cup of water in a rice cooker. I used 1 and 1/2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces. I fried the chicken until it was no longer pink. I combined 1 can each cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli soup, 1 cup milk, 12 ounce bag chopped broccoli, 1 pound mild cheddar cheese and 1 packet Lipton onion soup mix in a bowl. I added the cooked rice and stirred until all ingredients was mixed. I poured the mixture into two 7 1/2 x 9 1/2 baking dishes. I cooked one in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and put the other in the freezer. It turned out sooooo good, I will make this dish one of my favorites.

I tried this recipe for the first time a couple of days ago.  My kids loved it.  For a different, I also added an envelope of dry Lipton Onion Soup Mix into the mixture before sticking into the oven.  It was very simple and not very time-consuming.  We really enjoyed it!!!!

This was really tasty!  I had a different recipe that I couldn't find so I used this one and loved it - going to keep it for next time too.  I had to tweak it a tiny - I used shredded cheese instead of Velveeta and I used my own cooked chicken breast.  Still yummy!  I also used a shallot instead of onion, but I think next time I might cook it a tad first - it was a little strong to get a piece of raw shallot in a bite.  =)  Overall, super tasty!!  =)  Thanks for the recipe!!

I gave it two stars because it was a good starting point on a better recipe.  After cooking this the first time, there were large pools of butter all over the top and in the corners. I skimmed off what I could.  Second time around was better with some changes. Omitted the butter, used long grain rice (used the rice cooker), instead of onions I followed someone else's advice and used french onion soup mix.  Mix that with the milk in a large bowl to dissolve, add two cans creamed soup (i chose cream of broccoli), about 10 oz shredded cheese of your choice (cheddar for me), then add the frozen broccoli and cooked rice.  Gently mix until combined then pour over the baked chicken breast (or roasted) and bake, covered, for about 35 minutes. Still high in fat and calories, but it's a nice indulgence once in a while. Really warms the tummy!

I cooked my rice (no instant), and cooked boneless skinless chicken breast in italian dressing (no canned). Overall it was fine, but a little too creamy for my taste. Just an average meal, but I might tweak it to suit my tastes a little better. Nothing fancy!

I really love this dish--it's one of my go-to weekday dinners, and I always split the casserole between two 9x9 baking dishes and freeze one, so we get two meals out of it.  I use different cheese mixtures every time, and it always turns out great.  I've used fresh and frozen broccoli, and both work well, I always use "real" cut up, seasoned and cooked chicken breast, and I always use brown rice for some extra nourishment.  It tastes delicious!!!

Very tasty! As recommended, I used regular rice boiled in chicken broth, made 3 cups of dry rice. Used about 2/3 of it. I used fresh broccoli, steamed it first. I used a rotisserie chicken, I cut the milk to 1/4 cup but used all the butter, it was just right. For cheese I used 8 ounces chedder and 8 ounces colby jack. I mixed everything in a large bowl first to make sure the ratio of ingredients looked right. After these modifications it came out very good.

This was way too cheesy and only had one flavor - cheese.  Try cutting back on the cheese and see if that helps...?

I'm giving this 4 stars, only because I altered the recipe (as others suggested). I cubed fresh chicken breasts and cooked in some bacon fat for flavor. Instead of fresh onion, I used 1 packet onion soup mix. I also subbed the 'processed cheese food' aka Velveeta for 1 can cheddar cheese and 1 8oz. pkg. of shredded cheddar cheese. Everything else I left the same. This dish was SUPER easy, and it's definitely a keeper!

I used chopped broccoli and unthawed it first.  I also used brown rice and only half the cheese.  It was a little runny, but had a very good flavor.  I will make it again.

Ok, so i tweaked this recipe a little for my own family's taste. I used brown rice b/c my parents are super health conscious, and ofcourse fress broccoli and Chicken. (no canned sutff for us) Also, I skipped the cheese because we're not big on it and i felt that the cream of chicken/mushroom would be creamy enough. Even with these little changes the casserole came out wonderful and healthy as well.

super flavorful and easy but i took advice from other reviewers and made some changes (added onion soup mix instead of onion, made the rice insted of using instant and used 2 1/2 cups of graded cheese instead of the processed stuff) it did come out a little too soup like so i added 2 additonal cups of rice which helped (total of 4 cups of rice).

This was a pretty good casserole.  I cooked fresh chicken and fresh broccoli and added a few garlic cloves and shredded cheese instead of processed cheese.  It would probably be bland with out the garlic and onion.  I would make it again.  Most of my family really liked it.

It came out ok, but a little dry.  Next time I will try extra can of cream of mushroom soup and a little more milk.  I added Lipton onion soup mix for extra flavor and two 8 oz. bags of cheddar and monterey jack cheese (1 mixed in and 1 on top).  I also added French's Fried Onions on top for texture and used fresh broccoli.  It was ok overall, but I need to add extra soup.

Loved this recipe. Was a little soupy, so I added some bread crumbs on top and broiled it. Next time I am sauteing the onions first. They were too raw-tasting for me. But I definitely will make this again.

Try Sam's Club brand (Member's Mark) canned chicken breast! It is the only really GOOD canned chicken I have found!

Use a different cheese. Try 8 oz. of cream cheese, mild cheddar, or co-jack.

Used Jasmine rice. Also used only half the onion, cooked w/ butter & 8 ounces mushrooms, before adding to casserole. Did not add any butter other than what was used in cooking onions and mushrooms. Used shredded mild cheddar and topped w/ Italian bread crumbs. Everyone loved it.

I was going to double recipe and so glad I didn't for my family of 6.  Changes are:  made 3 cups of rice and no butter (just because I forgot).  We still have alot of leftovers and if you do want to double it, you will probably need two baking dishes.  Oh, and everyone loved it!  Keeper!

Tried this and it turned out well.  I substituted corn for broccoli (since hubby won't eat anything with broccoli) and used grated cheddar cheese.  Skipped the butter and used instant brown rice.  Will be using this again.

It's okay if you don't want to put too much effort into your meal for the night but nothing that I would share with a friend. And processed cheese and canned chicken, really? Ick. I used some cheddar instead and an actual chicken breast instead.

I give it four star's because I had to tweek it a little.  I steamed frozen broccoli in my rice cooker as it cooked the rice.  I left out the butter and used about 1/2 cup of light sour cream, and used less milk.  And as others did used half the amount of velveeta, and shredded cheddar to make up the difference.  Also, I dont like cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery.  Topping it with cheese in the last few minutes gave it a nice appearance.  It was perfect consistency.

Opted out of using minute rice on this as well, used medium grain rice, makes for a much creamier consistency.  Used 2 cups, this made for a nearly-overflowing 13x9 baking dish full when combined with all other ingredients.  You DO need the onion for flavoring, DO NOT leave this out!  Opted for a 3-cheddar blend of shredded cheese instead of Velveeta or other processed cheese block, this and the extra rice completely took care of the possibilty of 'soupiness' in this.  I actually ended up pre-cooking the broccoli because it needed to be chopped better (I bought florets instead of just chopped broccoli so not so many stems in this), onion, and added all other ingredients in and mixed on the stovetop instead of just mixing in the baking dish to put in the oven.  I also added in a 14-oz can of mushrooms, drained.  I did bake this after mixing on the stovetop for everything to warm through comepletely.  Ended up not having to stir anything in the middle because of stovetop prep!  Totally make-ahead and freeze friendly, reheats great after thawed!

With changes: 3 large chicken breasts (diced), marinated in olive oil and onions, seasoned with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.  I didn't have soups so added 1 can cream of broccoli and 1 c. sour cream.  Melted the butter, used fresh broccoli (steamed in micro for 5 min) and 2+ cups of Mexican blend cheese.  Stirred together and topped with bread crumbs.  My 5 & 2 year old ate it up!  So rare--this is a winner.

This has always been a good combo of ingredients. like others I added/deleted. I chose fresh chicken and boiled them in water,thyme,basil Ground black pepper oregano and poultry seasoning. I cubed it after it cooled a bit. I sweated the onions and added chopped mushrooms to the butter and onions till heated. I used cheddar and Monterrey jack cheeses. Rice pilaf quinoa mix instead of instant rice.and used fresh broccoli rather than frozen

I didn't add the chicken, and I used sharp cheddar cheese. It was a little too sharp for this, next time I'll try mild. Very good otherwise!

Very good start to what I ended up making.  I changed a couple things to fit my taste and my fridge contents and it turned out wonderful.  I used chicken thighs which I boiled first, used jasmine rice which I also cooked first and shredded some colby cheese to mix in.  I also added a tad bit of milk to the mix and it tasted great!  It was moist as can be and was very tasty!

With some of the suggested revisions, this was very tasty! I used fresh chicken, a packet of onion soup mix, an extra cup of rice, and shredded cheddar cheese. We had leftovers the next day and they tasted just as good, if not better. Very easy recipe to make and good for a quick weeknight meal.

Yummy, but be sure to cook the onions first.  I also prefer to use real cheese over processed and to use regular prepared rice over the instant.

I made this just as directed and I did care for it.  The worst part was the raw onions-- maybe if they were cooked prior to mixing in with the rest of the ingredients it would not overwhelm it so much.  Also, I LOVE cheese, and even this was WAY too cheesy for me.

It may be my own fault for following others suggestions, but I made this using a packet of onion soup instead of an onion and it was a disaster. Using canned chicken for anything other than chicken salad is a bad idea. The texture was bad, using two cans of cream soup was hard to swallow, and even though I used a whole jar of cheese whiz nothing overpowered the onion creamy taste.

did not like this, it was so soupy and cheesey. i followed the recipe exactly. we mixed the left overs with more rice the next day and it was better, but i will not make this again. too  much cheese, and i think too much soup too. it was kind of like a pile of slop.

I used real cheddar cheese, Uncle Ben's chicken flavored rice, and sauteed the onions (and mushrooms) in butter and garlic salt. This was by far the best casserole I've had. It freezes well too!

This was delicious!  I added a whole lot less cheese, about maybe 3/4 c. of shredded Italian blend cheese.  Then I used cream of broccoli and cream of celery cause that's what I had on hand, but it still came out delicious!  I omitted the onion and used fresh broccoli, yum!  I used the microwave to steam the broccoli first so that it wasn't too raw after it came out of the oven.  I used only 1/2 c. of milk.  Came out perfect!  Yum..

This was good. I modified it to make it low fat. I substituted fat free sour cream for butter, fat free soups, and fresh steamed broccoli. I also used a half pound of real cheddar, and omitted the velveeta. The only change I would make is to season the chicken more before combining everything.

I liked this recipe.  It was so easy to make.  I used cubed cooked chicken,  and whole broc flowers.  However, I would used the chopped broc, because it took longer for the flowers to cook.  I also only used 1/2 lb of cheese, and it was plenty.  Great comfort food.

Super yummy cheesy comfort food! This casserole is our go-to easy supper for us to make on a day when we're absolutely exhausted from work or craving something cheesy. I do make a few tweaks though as my fiancé and I normally try to eat whole and fresh unprocessed foods. We do cheat a bit with this casserole thought with the canned soups! 1). I dice two large chicken breasts or 3 small breasts (depending on what we get from the butcher shop that day) into small pieces and pan fry them in a bit of olive oil, a few tbsp. of water, and S/P until they are cooked through but not dried out. 2). I steam 4 cups of fresh broccoli cut in small florets. 3). I dice a small sweet onion and saute in a bit of olive oil for a few minutes. 4). I use two cups of brown rice cooked in chicken stock to add additional flavor 5). Here is the unhealthy part… I use 1 can of fat free cream of something Campbell's Soup (we prefer cream of broccoli) and 1 can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup mixed with 1 cup skim milk and a bit of sriracha sauce. I mix everything together with a few handfuls of shredded cheese (usually whatever we have lying around the fridge). I bake for about 35 mins and then sprinkle  a 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs mixed with a bit of melted butter on top and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes. Not the healthiest meal but it freezes well and it's nice to splurge every once in a while with some cheesy comfort food!

My wife tweaked this a bit. We are not fond of instant rice. She makes a large batch of rice in our rice cooker to make another meal. She put all the wet ingredients in a bowl then 2 cups cooked rice ads the cooked chicken  and the broccoli holds the cheese for the top puts into 2 pans cook's one and freezes the other for another week no cook days . I love this one.

Good basic recipe, but I made quite a few changes. I stewed three large, fresh chicken breasts and shredded those, and used long-cooking Jasmine rice (made according to package directions) which I cooked in chicken broth. I steamed the broccoli to the point it was crisp-tender before adding it to the mixture. I added a cup of sour cream and omitted the butter. I added onion powder (instead of onion), celery seeds, garlic powder, poultry seasoning and Morton's Nature Seasoning. I used 8 oz. finely shredded Mexican Blend cheeses, not processed cheese food. I adjusted my seasonings by adding sea salt and fresh coarse-ground black pepper to taste. Finally, I covered the top with a sleeve of crushed Ritz cracker crumbs mixed with 3/4 stick melted butter, then baked. It was delicious using the "tweaks" of my own.

Was very good but I would change a little bit, use 1 cup of milk, dash of mustard & worcester & cook with 1 cup of cheddar cheese until bubbly. I would omit the processed cheese food.

I made this as instructed except I used chicken breasts.  I did cut back on the amount of cheese as it seemed excessive.  I'm sorry, but it just wasn't good.  I ate two bites.  It was way too cheesy and just not tasty at all.  My daughter and husband finished there's but asked that this recipe NOT be made again.

Needed a little more flavor, but a great base recipe.  I've made this a handful of times now and definitely prefer shredded cheese!  Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper, very good. I made a few minor changes based on getting rid of some leftovers in the fridge. I used 2 c cooked chicken instead of cans of chicken. I also used 2 c. shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese and threw in 1/2 c sour cream. I think next time I will add some buttered bread crumbs on top and a little salt and pepper.

this is the bomb!  I did make a change, though. I add 1/2 cup ragu cheese sauce instead of the cream of chicken.  I use 8 ounces of extra sharp cheddar instead of the processed cheese.  Thank you for the recipe, even my toddlers loved it!

Added an extra cup of rice and didn't use canned chicken; instead I cooked and diced 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I will add a fourth piece of chicken next time.

After following some other reviews & making a few changes to this recipe, it was delicious!  I used cooked & shredded chicken breast (instead of canned), and may use a rotisserie chicken next time.  I used instant brown rice (cooked in chicken broth), and sauteed the onion in butter.  Instead of processed cheese, I used about 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar & 4 Kraft singles (since that was all the cheese I had available without another trip to the store).  I did steam the broccoli for a couple of minutes so it was no longer frozen.  Also, I added some garlic salt & pepper.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe tonight, It was very good, however, I did tweak it a little. I didn't add any butter and I didn't add the chicken... I didn't have any chicken thawed! My mom has been making a recipe similar to this for about 25 years. Hers is slightly different and healthier. My husband and I really enjoyed this dish... it was very tasty. Oh... I did add half a pack of onion soup mix in place of the onion...very good flavor!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone... you won't be disappointed! Happy Cooking!!! :O)

The concept of this recipe is great...Quick, easy and tasty. I made some changes b/c I like my casseroles thick. Used cubed chicken breast, only one can of cream soup, 1/2 cup milk, 2TBS butter, onion soup mix and real shredded cheese. Came out super tasty and my 1 yr old loved it!

Such a delicious and creamy dish! I had both leftover broccoli and rice, and this recipe was just the thing to use them up! I didn't have any chicken, so I left it out and added a couple stalks of celery, and it was still amazing! I didn't even miss the chicken, even though I usually consider no meal complete without meat! Very smooth and creamy, and just the right amount of vegetables!   (I broiled it for a couple minutes at the end to melt the cheese better, and it worked great!)

Followed recipe precisely and came out soupy.  Even after letting it sit for about 5 minutes.  Tasted fine but came out more of a garnish for chicken breasts.

I can't give high stars because I doctored this recipe a bit based on other reviewer's advice but I really enjoyed the outcome.   I cut the velveeta down to 1/4 pound, and added a small bag of shredded cheddar and jack cheese. I omitted the butter, and added a pouch of onion soup mix. I bought pre-cooked grilled chicken breast which was a cinch. I used fresh pre-chopped broccoli instead of frozen, and I made 4 cups of texmati wild rice (I increased the qty because other reviewers said it came out soupy.) Last but not least, I had some leftover smoked bacon so I fried it, chopped it up and mixed it in.   My prep was simple.   I made the rice to the recipe on the container, and fried up my bacon. Then in a saucepan, I slowly heated the velveeta, milk, cream soups, and onion soup mix. Then I put my rice in a 9x13 baking dish, threw in the broccoli, chicken, cheese sauce, and fried chopped bacon.   It came out pretty nice, I would definitely make it again.

Was a pretty decent casserole.  I made a few changes: 1. Used 2 large chix breast that I cooked on the stove top with onion, garlic, spices and a little chix broth. 2. Used fresh broccoli 3. Used regular long grain white rice and cooked it with chix broth instead of water. 4. only used 1/4 cup milk due to other reviews on being too soupy. 5. Used shredded cheese. 6. Omitted the butter It turned out very nice, not too soupy or dry.  Would make again.

I have made this dish way too many times to count over the past 2-3 years! My family loves it - even my picky niece. When I plated it up for her she asked if she could only take a few bites. I asked her to just try it. Before I knew it she was asking for seconds!!  I do make a few changes... First I make regular long grain rice cooked in chicken broth according to package directions. Instead of canned chicken I sauté 2 chicken breasts over med. heat until the juices run clear or left over rotisserie chicken. Fresh broccoli chopped small and microwaved for about a minute, 98% fat free cream of soups and skim milk. I don't add the processed cheese at all but instead top the casserole with mild cheddar cheese. It is more time consuming the way I prepare it but in my opinion, it is better this way!

I made so many alterations to this that I'm not sure I should rate it anymore.  I chopped fresh broccoli and carrots and threw them it a pot with a cup of left over fat-free chicken broth and two cups of water.  I brought that to a boil and let it cook for about five minutes to give the veggies a head start before I added brown rice.  That cooked for five minutes, then steamed off the burner for another five.  While that was going, I diced up the white meat from a rotisserie chicken and then mixed everything together with a can of low-fat cream of mushroom and low-fat cream of chicken soups and a can of fat-free evaporated milk and a finely-shredded four cheese blend.  I topped it off with some whole grain bread crumbs and baked it at 300 degrees until it bubbled around the edges.  I didn't use any butter at all.  I can't imagine it needs it.  Everyone loved it and it was pretty nutritious to boot.

I was looking forward to making this recipe based on all of the 5 star ratings.  It was awful.  Soupy and too much processed cheese.  The kids hated it and I didn't bother to serve it to my husband.  Made him something else and threw the gross stuff in the garbage.

Mushy and bland. I sauteed 1/4 yellow onion in butter before adding it to the mixture. I boiled 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts,adding butter, poultry seasoning and garlic to water then cut it into bite size pieces. Sprinkled bread crumbs on top with shredded cheese for last 15 minutes in oven. I added cayenne pepper and garlic salt to my plate because it needed more flavor. Don't get fooled by the milk-it looks VERY milky in the pan but it cooks down. OK overall but I'm not sure what others are raving about.

I gave this 5 stars no mater how you may doctor this recipe it turns out to
be just as delicious as the original.I fix this for company and get raves, my husband told me the first time I made this to go right in and put it in my receipe box. Tonight
I will use canned green beans, and I always use sharp cheder cheese and not
cheese food. I will be making this receipe for a dinner and Bible study class that I will be joining soon. I know I can count on it to be a hit.

Mouth watering is so far from what we found for this recipe! Canned chicken and canned soup made for a very lousy tasting dish. After the addition of roasted green chilis and cayenne pepper, it was somewhat edible.

Although my family is a huge fan of broc, rice and cheese casserole, I wanted to try something a bit different. I opted for this one with chicken in it. WAY to cheesey!! This casserole would be excellent, but I strongly advise in cutting down on so much cheese.

My boyfriend loves this recipe.  The only recommendation I suggest is cooking the rice before baking the dish.  The rice was hard after cooking no matter how long I left it in the oven.  Overall, an excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe that I'll make again!  A little soupy, but with more rice it will be perfect!

I made this twice.  The first time it came out too soupy and I had to add more rice to soak up some of the liquid.  The second time I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and it came out perfect.  I also solved the problem of the crunchy onions by sauteeing them first before adding them to the mixture.

Great recipe, but like everyone else I made some modifications.  I did not use instant rice and cooked the rice in chicken broth.  Also used frozen broccoli, but cooked in water and drained it.  I also sauteed the onion, adding diced celery, one zucchini and one carrot - that's just me trying to sneak in more veggies for the family. Instead of buying canned chicken, I bought a ready whole rotisserie chicken, and shredded the meat.  I mixed everything in a bowl and then transferred into a casserole dish so I did not have to stir everything in the middle of the cooking process. I have also used cooked chicken breast and also have used 24 ounces of broccoli to stretch this recipe, and our family really likes broccoli.

I was looking for a chicken rice casserole dish and this recipe caught my attention. After reading the suggestions, I made the following changes.
I did use long grain rice and prepared it ahead of time using chicken broth instead of water. I also boiled 3 chicken breasts  and cubed them instead of using canned chicken. I sautéed the diced onion and added a bit of minced garlic to taste. I took the suggestion of one reviewer and added 8 oz. of shredded cheddar and 8 oz. of Monterey Jack. I also added about 1/4 cup extra milk because it was looking a bit dry.
After putting it in the casserole dish, it just looked a little naked. So...I crushed up some stuffing, spread it on top, and poured melted butter over the whole thing. Let me tell you...DELICIOUS!!!

Great recipe! Based on the recommendations, here's what I did:
I used fresh chicken cutlets (seasoned with seasoning salt and pepper, and boiled in water and onion to save on cooking time and I didn't want the chicken to dry out in the oven)
Brown rice (which takes FOREVER to cook), 
Switched the cream of mushroom for cream of celery (hate 'shrooms)
Added colby jack (my favorite cheese) to the soup mixture instead of using processed cheese.

Tastes very homemade and rich. I ate with oyster crackers the next day. Delicious! Boyfriend LOVES!! Definitely worth a try with modifications.

I tweeked the recipe a bit, because of the sodium content. I used fresh chicken, unsalted butter and nonprocessed cheese. Lowered the sodium consideribly. Was fantastic!! The other thing I used, which I change each time I make it, I used often is, with the chicken soup, is cream of broccoli and other cream soup flavors. Just to mix it up, like cream of potato, yum!

I just couldn't eat more than 2 bites of this. I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated except for cutting down on the velveeta & even used fresh broccoli as recommended in the reviews, & I added some shredded cheddar on top. It was soupy, mushy & very bland. I really don't understand all the raving reviews for this recipe. I'm sorry but, I will not try it again.

Super yummy and easy!!  I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta and 2 can cream of chicken instead of 1 cream of mushroom/1 cream of chicken.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This one is definitely going into the regular dinner rotation.

YUMM!! I halved this recipe (2 people, 2 days of dinner) I added some more seasonings and cut down on the velveeta, it was delicious.  Also I recommend adding a crumbly topping, I used seasoned bread crumbs, almonds & butter!

This is a good little casserole for a simple dinner.  I boiled my chicken and made the rice in the chicken broth. Reading the reviews i used scallions instead of onions b/c i needed to use them up.  I also added garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika as some of the tips mentioned.  I topped it with a dusting of bread crumbs

So delicious!!!
I did use a rotisserie chicken instead of canned, and about 12 oz of shredded velveeta cheese.  You probably could get away with 8oz.  

Brown rice and the healthy choice soups also make this a teensy bit healthier.

This was a quick and easy weeknight dish and will definitely be making it again.

Thanks for posting!!

Great recipe! Family loved it! I made some tweaks as I used fresh broccoli & chicken & shredded cheddar & mozzerella cheese.
I sauted the onions with fresh minced garlic & added the chicken to cook in a tbsp. of butter. I steamed the broccoli for 2.5 minutes - then followed the recipe. Lots of leftovers for tomorrow.

Made this recipe at my mom's suggestion as a way to use up leftovers. This turned out good. A few substitutions to use up what I already had: shredded roasted chicken instead of canned, fresh broccoli instead of frozen, regular rice instead of instant. I used an 8 oz. jar of cheese wiz and topped it off with a little sharp cheddar. I probably should have blanched the fresh broccoli a bit because it's still a tad crunchy and even though I fully cooked the rice before adding it to the casserole, it still came out well and not mushy. Even though I made this to use up my leftovers, it looks like I'll have even more leftovers because this makes a huge casserole. Fortunately, my mother had an ulterior motive in suggesting this recipe...she wants me to bring her half of it!

I used 98% fat free soups and brown rice in order to make this a little healthier.  I also baked and shredded chicken breasts rather than use the canned.  Other than that, I followed this recipe as is.  It was a little runny, but tasted ok.  Not high on my "make this again" list.

Easy and cheesy!  I only gave it a four due to the flavor being a little bland.  I will pump it up next time with some garlic.

Good stuff.  In order to make it more "my-kids-friendly", I left out the onion.  I, aslo, upped it to 20 oz of broccoli florets, and I added garlic powder & onion powder.  THE KIDS (& Hubby) LOVED IT!  I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 ONLY because of the fat content this dish must be packin', but NOT because it didn't taste good.  Delish.  I'll make it again.

This is a go-to meal for my family -- even my very picky three year old really likes it, proclaiming it the only way he likes broccoli. I use the hints from others to enhance it (nothing original that I add) -- it is easy and delicious.

This is a great recipe! Even the 10, 8 and 5 year old liked it! We put a few herbs on the chicken as we baked it (not from a can) which I think helped a good deal.

I checked out everyone's comments and did the following differently from the recipe:  -cooked the rice in chicken broth (2 cups broth:1 cup rice) -8 ounces Velveeta and 8 ounces shredded colby jack -"baby broccoli" sized frozen broccoli -rotisserie chicken breasts, shredded -1 package Lipton onion soup mix -sprinkled bread crumbs on top before I baked it.  Delicious! Thanks for all the extra ideas.

This was bland and tasteless.  The chicken tasted poached or boiled, with no flavour to speak of.  The consistency of the casserole was unappealing, and it's appearance was uninviting.

this dish was yummy! i only made a few changes. i used 2 large chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken and while i was cooking it i cooked it in a few shakes of tabasco and franks hot sauce for just a little bite! and i also used 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead of the processed cheese. this will definately be made again!

This is a great recipe with juust a few changes.  I cut back on the velveeta to a half of a pound and added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  We don't care for the canned chicken so I baked a few boneless skinless chicken breasts and cubed them.  Also, you can substitute any creamy soup.  I had only cream of mushroom on hand so thats what we used.  Turned out great!

Very good and super easy! I put casserole together on my lunch break then cooked it when I got off work. I used 3 chicken breast (seasoned and boiled them) shredded/pulled apart, don't like processed cheese so I used 1 8oz bag of casserole cheese and 1 8oz bag of sharp (however I think any type of cheese would do), I like yellow onions so I finely chopped and sauteed (I tried this once without sauteing the onion but didn't like the crunch texture in the final product), and I use the frozen bag of broccoli florets, mix together with the rest of ingregients listed on the recipe and put in casserole dish. I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, removed to stir casserole (it helps to make sure cheese melts evenly) then baked another 30 minutes. The last few minutes I crunched up some Ritz crackers and put on top. Yummy!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe. Changed a few things, I used fresh broccoli (steamed before adding) and cooked my own chicken breast and I didn't use instant rice. Besides that, I followed the recipe and it was yummy chicken, broccoli, cheese goodness! :-)  Update: I'm taking away a star because the 2nd time I made this I didn't really like it that much! Not sure why that happens - maybe I was just really hungry the 1st time. :-(

This was the best casserole that I've made in a long time! I made almost according to the recipe except for the following two things:  I omitted the butter (couldn't see how it would be necessary except for adding more calories) and I used boneless chicken breast, instead of canned, that I cooked first on the Foreman. My husband couldn't get enough of this, he wants me to make it again next week. Bravo on this recipe!!

So I just made this, and with a little tweaking, it came out pretty awesome! I cooked chicken instead of using canned, whole grain rice, I used a few slices of cheese and a good bit of shredded cheddar cheese, 2 cans cream of chix soup, 1/2 C. milk & 1/2 C. sour cream, broc & onion, seasoning salt & pepper.. The sour cream added some great flavor, this was really simple to make and very delicious!

Excellent! I stewed chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, used the broth to cook regular long-grain rice instead of minute rice, and used cream of mushroom and cream of broccoli soups.

Yummy and easy!  My family loved it.  Following other recommendations, I used whatever cheese I had on hand and shredded it (colby and cheddar, I think).  I mixed some of the cheese in with the other ingredients, and used some to top the whole thing off.  I cooked the chicken in a crock pot (just easier for me to do it that way) and shredded it.  I boiled the frozen broccoli a few minutes before mixing it in w/the other ingredients, and everything turned out great.  It was simple and good and I will definitely make it again!

I made quite a few changes to this recipe based on posted reviews. First I use boneless chicken breast (cubed) sauted in a skillet with minced garlic and salt and pepper. For the water I use chicken broth (14.5 ounce can), only 3/4 cup of skim milk, add 1/2 cup light sour cream, omit butter, instead of onion use 1 tbsp. of onion powder, add 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. black pepper, for the cheese I use half shredded Sharp cheddar cheese and half cubed processed cheese food, the rest of the ingredients remain the same. Combine everything in a large bowl, pour into a baking dish and follow baking directions. Turned out wonderful and NO LEFTOVERS:) Thanks for posting and for all the great help from the reviews.

4 stars, based on how easy and fast the recipe is, while still being tasty. Tasted even better the second day. Hard to mess up, everyone liked,...definitely "comfort food". A keeper for when you are feeding a large group of people, and a one-dish casserole is the easiest way to go. Served with salad and crusty bread.

I halved the recipe and added the onion and the kids loved the recipe.  I was going away for business so I mixed all the ingredients together and froze it.  My husband said it turned out great. I used a bag of frozen peas instead of broccoli (didn't have) and two chicken breasts boiled with a bay leaf and celery seed instead of canned.

For us "broke" people, I used everything I had on hand... can of chicken, rice, cream of mushroom soup, frozen mixed veggies and cauliflower, and shredded italian and mexican cheese (basically cleaned out the fridge and freezer!) and this turned out FANTASTIC!! Even my 1 1/2 yr old ate it! I made it up last night, and cooked it today.  Did use a touch of garlic salt and threw in some chives.  DELICIOUS!!!! :) Thank you!

This recipe was a hit in my home!  I made a few personal modifications: I cooked regular long grain rice in our rice cooker while I prepared the sauce; I mixed the cr of chicken and mushroom soups, 1 can (13 oz) chicken, 1 bag of broccoli, S&P, and garlic/onion powders until the broccoli was somewhat tender (based on previous reviews).  Once the rice was done, I sprayed a 9x13 pan with Pam, layered the rice, about a cup of montery jack cheese, and the soup mixture.  My husband hates plain cheddar cheese, so I placed 7 slices of american cheese on top.  Baked for 10 minutes, stirred the cheese into the mix, topped with seasoned bread crumbs, and baked another 10 minutes.  My 17 month old LOVED it (and she is not a rice fan) and my husband asked to put it into our weekly rotation.  That's all the thanks I needed!

This is a good basic recipe but uses too many "processed" ingredients for my liking.  I use fresh broccoli, cooked-cubed chicken breasts and real, grated, cheddar cheese.  Take the extra time to make this recipe with fresh ingredients- they are so much better for us!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a crumb topping the last few minutes.  The consistancy was perfect, and it wasn't too cheesy.  My family thought it was great.  Next time I make it, it may be without the chicken in it, as a side dish.

This recipe was amazing. My boyfriend said it was one of the best things I have ever cooked. I made a few changes to the recipe. I used regular chicken breast and cut them in pieces. I made chicken flavored rice instead of instant white rice. I also didnt use all of the velveeta cheese. In the end it didnt need all that cheese it was just perfect. Definitely will be making this again.

I used wild rice instead of white rice, and this was very good! I also tossed in a couple handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese. I bought a rotisserie chicken from the store instead of the canned chicken. Made for very good leftovers!

Would have given it 5 stars, but had too much tweaking to do.  I used cream of chicken soup but added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Instead of the white onion, I used green that were sauteed in the butter with some fresh garlic to add a little more flavor.  Next time I'm going to try and mix of long grain and wild rice for a change! Thanks! :)

This was a fast recipe and tasty too.  Some quick tips (substitutes):  I used fresh broccoli, 1 cup seasoned wild rice and 1 cup whole grain brown rice, low sodium/low fat cream of mushroom and chicken and 1/2 lb real cheddar.

My whole family loves this and it freezes perfectly.  The only thing I do different is cook my rice in chicken broth.  It adds to the flavor of the dish.

This was a very big hit at my sister's barbeque. Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I followed others' tips and substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of broccoli soup, I also used regular rice rather than instant rice, I left out the onion, used 1 lb. of velvetta cheese, and instead of the 2 can of chunk chicken I used 2 large chicken breast.  It was delicious and i will definitely make this again

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was quick and easy to make.  My husband loved it and it made enough that I could freeze the remainder.  I did add a touch of pepper.

Quick and easy comfort food.  I halved it, used swiss cheese and topped with cheddar (used much less than recipe said), added pepper, no onion, used small amount of both garlic and onion powder.

This is another example of a high-rated dish that just doesn't cut it. I found it to be watery and no flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. Very bland. Maybe it will taste better after sitting overnight but overall I was not impressed.

This is the perfect meal for cold winter days when you crave comfort food. It's also great for potlucks and feeding large groups of people on short notice. I did doctor the recipe up a bit. I left out the onions and used a whole rotisseri chicken instead of using canned. And I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 of cream of broccoli. Instead of using instant rice I used uncle bens parmesan flavored rice, I also used a mixture of chedder and montery jack cheese instead of processed. For flavor I added a dash of cayenne pepper and hot sauce and 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. I also topped with french's friend onions for a little crunch and it come out delicious!

This is a wonderfully good recipe. As well as tasting good, it is also easy, nutritious and even the kids love it. 

My modifications were that I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese, omitted the butter and added peas for extra veggies and only used one cup of rice to cut down on carbs.  Very good. Even my 17 month old loves it....

The best ever!  People always ask me to bring it when we're having a potluck. It's just like I used to have every Thanksgiving when I was a kid. Asbsolutely not just for holidays anymore.

Very tasty, even though I had to modify it here and there due to what ingredients I had on hand.  I cooked a mixture of regular plain and brown rice (didn't have instant), then added frozen mixed veggies (didn't have broccoli), then added a little cheddar/jack cheese (didn't have enough american).  Ha!  But it still came out very good.  Just smelling it makes you hungry.

This was very good, i changed a few things after reading the comments. I used one can mushroom soup, 2 chicken breast boiled in broth and seasoning and shredded, 1/4 that amount of cheese food and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, a bag of frozen broccoli cauliflower and carrots, and dried chopped onion, onion powder, garlic salt and cayenne pepper. Next time I will use fresh broccoli, but will definitely make this again.

I know this post is old but it's still one of my favorites. My family and I love this dish. We made a few changes. We don't use canned chicken (fresh chicken breast instead) and we cook it with about 1.5 tbsp of olive oil, salt and pepper. We also use fresh brocolli. We don't put any onion and we use cheddar cheese.

Made some slight changes & need to change it some more. Great recipe & easy, but would suggest pre-cooking the onion & broccoli (too undone/raw if not pre-cooked).  Also, added cream of broccoli & cheese soup, with 14 oz of shredded cheddar cheese.  Used 10.75 oz cans of condensed soup, but would use more soup & not dilute it, for better flavor.  Also used another's suggestion to increase the rice (I used 3 cups of cooked rice in chicken broth, not instant rice) & increased the amount of chicken used (used 4 cans of chicken breast).   Great recipe & will use again!!

I took the advice of other reviews. I boiled the rice in chicken broth. As other said, I used regular rice not instant. Next time, I will use instant rice so it will cook faster! I used 2 cups of chicken broth per 1  cup of rice. I boiled 3  cups of rice and used approx 2.5 cups of the cooked rice in the casserole. I used 2 cans of chicken of chicken. I don't like cream of celery, so I just two of the same kind or 1 large can. I used a lb of fresh chicken tenders. I fried them in a skillet on the stove with butter, fresh diced onions and minced garlic.  Then shredded the chicken and mixed it in with cream of chicken, montary jack cheese, milk, celery salt, pepper, and a little parsley. I didn't use the broccoli because my family had broccoli for the drinner the previous night. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes, stopping at 15 minute and stirring the casserole. Overall, this recipe was good, but a lot of changes were made.

Really love this!

I switched to all fresh ingredients and grilled my own chicken and used long grain rice and cheddar cheese... so... the prep time took a while but I just like fresh stuff so I guess it's worth the time to me.

It's a little bland so I put a diced jalapeno pepper in too. I tried adding shredded carrots once but that did nothing so I don't bother with them anymore.

I put bread crumbs on the top also to give it some crunch.

I always follow instructions first time and wasn't thrilled, a lot of the rice hard uncooked, no flavor and way too much cheese for my family. 
   Made it my way, used jasmine rice and cooked it, let broccoli pretty much un-thaw first while cooking rice,  used real chicken breasts boneless 4 of them (one i tried by their recipe did not have near enough chicken),cooked on george foremans grill about 10 minutes added a little bit of cumin spice to the chicken  (about 1 tsp), then cut into chunks, used only cream of chicken w/garlic,  & the milk and probably half the cheese , did half cheddar and half mozzarella cheese and onion, sorry not good with measuring always eye balled it like my mother taught me, and i never add salt to anything (healthy cooking reasons), if anything i would add ground black pepper.
   Turned out fantastic, everyone loved it, but thanks for the idea.

This was a easy recipe to make. I did not use instant rice I used regular rice but I cooked it in chicken broth. I used chicken breast that I had previously cooked on the grill.  For cheese I used cheddar and  montery jack. As I was making it I was thinking wow this seems like it is bland, where are the spices? I tasted a little of it but I thought maybe after it came out of the oven everything would have come together flavor wise. Sorry to say it was bland. To me it was cheese and chicken. Other family  members felt the same way. Next time I may omit the onion. And use a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix as suggested by others.

This is a good basic recipe. Once you add in your own blend of spices, throw some bread crumbs and cheddar on top and broil, it is pretty darn good! This recipe makes a TON of casserole, so I bagged half of it up before baking to freeze for another time.

With modifications I'd rate this 5 stars!  I cooked up bite size chicken breasts with the onion.  Put them in bowl with frozen broccoli florets, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 packet Lipton onion soup mix, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, milk, and cooked rice (rice cooker rice).  I then topped with a little melted butter, more shredded cheese and Panko breadcrumbs.  Obviously, I wasn't doing a diet edition, lol.  I think the Panko was a great addition because it gave a wonderful crispy texture to an otherwise, somewhat mushy dish.  Don't get me wrong, it would have still been a hit, but the Panko was a super addition.  Will definitely make this again soon!

Just excellent. Definitely will make again and again. I halved the recipe since there were only two of us. I used one can of cream of chicken soup (Healthy Recipe),half a left over rotisserie chicken and uncooked basmati rice. I served half and froze the other half although had I not done that we would have served for dinner the next day and happily finished it off.  The rice probably could have used another 5-10 minutes; it was just a tad crunchy but still very edible. I'll add a little milk when I heat up the frozen half and that should finish off the rice perfectly. I will add more broccoli next time since we really like it and there was enough sauce to handle it.

I adjusted a few things but I tasted it before even cooking it and I knew it would be amazing. I used about 4-5 cups of broccoli, 1 onion (I sauteed it first), I boiled 3 chicken breasts and just shredded them and used the chicken broth to cook the rice and then I mixed everything together. I used 20 oz of cream of chicken soup and onion soup mix along with about half a cup of sour cream and a table spoon of mayo. And then the usual salt, pepper, minced garlic, and about half a cup of cheese. The amount suggested seems like way too much.

I tried it with the following changes, based on read reviews:
-Fresh chicken (boiled before baking),
-Fresh broccoli (steamed until tender),
-Chicken OXO to the rice,
-Cheddar cheese,
-Used homo milk,
-Bread crumbs on top,
-No butter,

.What I would do next time?
-Saute the onion in butter,
-Add more broccoli (steamed until tender),
-Add more chicken (boiled before baking),
-Chicken OXO to the rice,
-Cheddar cheese mixed with other cheeses,
-Bread crumbs on top,
-No butter

.Decent meal to serve kids, picky ones still fish out the chicken and broccoli.......Freezes and reheats well for lunches at work.

I followed the recipe for 4 servings, but they are going to be HUGE servings.  I used a 13 oz can of  chicken, only cream of mushroom soup, mozzarella cheese, added pepper, onion powder and crispy french onions instead of fresh onion.  It was amazing!!   Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious!!  I made it  with regular brown rice and made the rice in my rice maker before hand.  Mixed it all in the casserole pan which I buttered before adding the other ingredients.  Also I added a can( 15.25 oz)  of Black Beans, and I grated cheddar cheese for the cheese.  Never stirred it while cooking either.     Simply delicious!  Everyone took seconds...even those that don't like rice dishes!  Will make again!  :)

Since it was my first time making it, I followed the directions.  My family liked it okay, but I didn't like the onion as it was still crunchy and it was Heavy on broccoli.  Next time I will make the following choices:  1) no onion, 2) half the broccoli, 3) add a can Rotel tomatoes, 4) half the amount of "cheese", 5) instead of the canned chicken put 2 large chicken breasts, cubed, and browned in skillet.  Makes for a lightly spicy, flavorful casserole that I know my family will love.

DH loved this dish! I cubed two chicken breasts and cooked them on the stove top. And, I only used a can of cream of mushroom gluten free, no cream of chicken. I would probably cut the butter in half next time.

Just ok for us... Mine did not turn out soupy at all so I'm not sure what all of those comments are about.  I finely minced a small onion, used fresh chicken and not canned (which I shredded and will cube next time), and precooked my broccoli as I was afraid not to, and mine turned out pretty good and actually a little more thick than I would have preferred.  That might have been because I only used 1/4 cup of butter and  not the entire stick which was by mistake.   The recipe did not specify whether to shred, cube or anything else for the processed cheese so I cut mine in very smallish cubes which did not end up melting all the way but was still good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfect yummy comfort food. My somewhat picky eater husband even liked it. I did make some changes. Usually I am a stickler for following a recipe exactly the first time, but I tweaked it due to ingredients I had on hand and tastes. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup because oddly I didn't have cream of mushroom. my hubs and I despise processed cheese so I used a guessimating helping of italian cheese blend. I also used fresh broccoli (no steaming necessary). I forgot the onion (but we're not fans anyway of onions in casseroles). Then I cooked cut up chicken breasts in olive oil and garlic. I mixed everything in the saucepan before putting it in the baking pan and put on the butter (I accidentally used the whole cube so I had to scoop out some melted butter, which might have been avoided had I remembered to stir in middle of baking time) on top. then lightly topped with more cheese. i had 2 helpings and my hubs had probably 4. Delicious. Usually I am horrible at casseroles but this one was excellent.

I was looking for a recipe that used canned chicken.   I don't like processed cheese so I used cheddar cheese.   I made half the recipe so I skipped the cream of mushroom soup and used the cream of chicken soup. Also I had fresh broccoli on hand I use that.  I would definitely make this again.

Easy and tasty. There's a good base here that can be played around with: the rice and the soup (like others have said, either up the amount of rice a cup or cut back on the amount of soup by a third) along with the butter, milk, and onion. The cheese is good, but a pound is a lot, and using real cheese instead of processed is probably a good swap. Broccoli is a good veg choice, but a pound of whatever mix of veggies are handy works fine too. Chicken is also a good choice, but this might be decent with fish if you've got some in the freezer. Adding a layer of breadcrumbs or crushed cornflakes mixed with a little melted butter on top gives a nice contrasting crunch to all the rice, as well.

Great, easy recipe! I made similar edits as other reviewers listed - using leftover grilled chicken, the Lipton onion mix, and real cheese instead of processed. Super winter comfort food! This recipe makes a large portion so next time I'll probably freeze half before baking or cut it in half. Super cheesey and yummy!

I loved it!  I made 3 cups of rice, and 2 1/2 cups of water, 1 each of the soups, and I used whole chicken instead of chunk.  But, I had to fry the chicken to get it done, had to cook the rice uncovered, and had to double the cook time.  But in the end, the taste was fabulous, hence, the four stars.

I made the recipe as written except I used cooked chicken tenderloins.  It was delicious.  While it was a bit soupy - at first, it was absorbed into the rice as it cooled.  

All together, just a wonderful dish!

Wow, this was the exact type of dish I was craving this weekend! I wanted something cheesy with rice, chicken, and broccoli and this had the exact taste I was after.  I followed the recipe very closely; the only changes I made were to add chicken breast I had previously baked and diced instead of canned chicken, and fresh steamed broccoli instead of frozen, and regular cooked rice instead of instant.  All the other soups and cheese types and ratios I kept the same, and I did not find this too soupy at all.  I topped it with diced green onions. So delicious and easy, it's definitely going into the regular rotation. My husband loved it, too, and said it was the best casserole he's had so far.

I kept the same ingredients but changed the method a little....Sauté a small onion in the butter until translucent.  Steam 1 pound of fresh broccoli florets until barely tender.  Chop into small pieces and set aside.  Whisk the soups together in a large sauce or sauté pan.  Whisk in milk until smooth.  Place on low heat until beginning to simmer and add cubed cheese.  Stir occasionally until cheese is melted.   Add 4 cups of cooked rice (warmed) to a mixing bowl.  Shred 2 cooked skinless chicken breasts by hand and add to rice mixture.   Add the cooked broccoli and the cheese mixture.  Divide into two 7x 11 inch baking pans and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.  I usually serve one dish for dinner and freeze the other.   It's easier to cook in two separate casserole dishes rather than trying to divide it up later.

I followed the directions to this recipe almost exactly. the only changes I made were to A.) not put in a full onion. I am not a fan of onions so I only but a small amount in for flavor. B.) Add salt, pepper, and some garlic powder to the mix. The recipe turned out great, everyone in my family LOVED it. Best chicken, broccoli, & rice casserole I've ever had!

This was fun and quite easy. I did make a few of the suggested changes by other reviewers, but I don't imagine it tasted super different.

I cooked my own two cups of rice, which allowed it to be stickier than the instant stuff. I also boiled a single chicken breast in chicken stock, water, garlic, and soy sauce, then shredded it. I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of broccoli. The final change was to use a half a pound of mexican shredded cheese mix, since I don't really like cheese. I really enjoyed it and my husband tolerated it-- which is saying quite a bit since he doesn't like cream of anything soups. I'm very likely to make this one again, thanks!

MY FAMILY LOVED IT with some of the tweaks suggested. I made 3 cups of regular rice rather than the instant.  And I used fresh chicken breasts that I seasoned and quickly fried and cubed small rather than canned chicken (which is always my last choice).  I used the French onion soup mix and 2 heaping handfuls of grated cheese (cheddar and jack mix because that's what I had on hand).  I usually always prefer fresh broccoli to frozen but again, that's what I had on hand so I used it and it was great with that.  

My husband ate so much he was uncomfortable after dinner.  And my boys loved it.

My mom makes a recipe similar to this with instant rice but I don't like the stuff. I used this recipe and subbed the instant with 3 cups cooked basmati rice. It was really yummy. My only complaint was the raw onions. The texture of them raw was a little off. Next time i'll cook them before hand.

Made recipe as stated & it was a little bland & way too cheesy. Made again and i have to say: Do NOT add dry onion soup mix like others suggested! This gives the dish an artificial taste. Wish I would have sauteed onions and added them like it called for. Used rotisserie chicken & shredded it. Cooked basmati rice in rice cooker while I steamed broccoli in micro.  Added 2 TB sour cream. Only used 8 oz shredded colby jack for cheese, but stirred in more milk for creaminess toward end.  Definitely needs more flavor, so I added Lawry's seasoning salt, garlilc powder, plenty of salt & pepper.  
Put some in a small dish to experiment with & added couple dashes of garam masala, cumin & coriander powder (Indian spices) and it added a nice flavor.

With a little tweaking, I love this recipe. I used a box of wild rice instead of regular, used less water and milk to make it less runny, and use shredded cheddar cheese instead of the icky processed kind. So yummy I made it two days in a row! I think the wild rice is the key to making it delicious.

This is a great dish. If you like mushrooms, add some chopped mushrooms in to cook and it's wonderful! Can't go wrong with this simple dish, plus lots of leftovers.

The ingredients are good but need to be a bit more fresh as a lot of reviews have said. I sauted the onions first, seasoned chicken (not canned) with salt and pepper and browned it in a pan, and used 2 cups of shredded casserole cheese instead. The microwave bag of rice was perfect to mix in the pan with all of those ingredients and some frozen peas,cream of chicken, butter, and milk. Old school comfort food, the family all had seconds!

Absolutely delicious!  I did use 2 cups grated cheddar instead of the processed cheese food mixed into the casserole, and then another cup or so grated over top, but other than that I followed the recipe.  It's just me, so I portioned out the casserole into individual servings and froze them, like another reviewer mentioned, and they were great! The flavours continued to mix together, and I found myself looking forward to these leftovers instead of making something fresh! Thanks Heather, I will definitely be making this again!

I am not much of a rice fan but I wanted something different and this was similar to Chicken Divan the way I make it so I thought I'd give it a try!  I loved it!!!  Like I said, this says a lot because I *barely* ever make anything with rice!

I love this! The main changes I made are using chicken breasts (boiled) and omitted the onions. I did however top with French's crispy fried onions!

This recipe was simply delish! My family loved it...it's definitely a keeper! I substitued the canned chicken for 2 large chicken breast.  I just diced it up and added it into the mixture and baked it for 1 hour instead of 30 minutes.  I also used fat free cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and dashed in some red crushed peppers and black pepper for the extra kick. Simply delicious!

My fiance and I both loved this.  It even works well without adding the chicken as a side dish.  I kind of dump and pour in certain ingrediants to whatever I think looks good.  Just experiment and make it how you like it.

This was ok...my daughter was not a fan, and neither was i really, but my hubby did like it. I think next time i will cook the broccoli a little longer as well as the rice BEFORE sticking everything in the oven, as it wasn't cooked enough for me and it was taking forever in the oven to finish baking. Also will halve the recipie next time to save from having soooo much leftover.

I followed this recipe loosely based on what others said they did... I used 3 cups of rice (regular, not instant), 3 cups of shredded turkey breast that I had cooked up, and only the can of cream of chicken soup and not the mushroom. I also left out the butter and decided to use red onion instead of yellow and only used about 1/3 of the onion. Instead of frozen broccoli I used fresh, which I steamed up ahead of time. I did use the amount of velveeta cheese it called for, plus I put some shredded cheddar on top. Next time I'm going to follow my version and also add either shoestring potatos or broken ritz crackers on top for some much needed crunch.

Very tasty.  Like others suggested i cooked regular (non instant) rice first and used fresh brocoli, and used half velveeta, half cheddar cheese.  The onion hovered somewhere between cooked and uncooked.  I think next time i might try sauteeing them first for a little bit before adding.  Very tasty recipe though!

I made several changes as everyone else did. I was really just looking for a broccoli cheese rice casserole like all the women in my family have made for years. They all have their own recipe, so I wanted to find a good one of my own. I omit the chicken all-together and use 5 cups of cooked white rice. I mix the soups, cheese, butter, milk, and onion soup mix (instead of chopped onion) all together in a pot over medium-low heat to make a sauce. Surprisingly enough, I actually use MORE of the processed cheese to suit my tastes - about 21 ounces total. Once everything is melted together, I stir in the broccoli and rice then pour it all into a glass baking dish topped with shredded cheddar. Bake until heated through, then put it under the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese on top is bubbly and lightly browned. Just what I was looking for... delicious! Now all the women in my family want to use MY recipe.

I love this recipe and so did my family!! I also added the onion soup mix instead of the onions, but to increase the creaminess, I added 2 heaping tablespoons of sour cream to it. Makes it extra rich and creamy!

I usually hate casseroles and don't ever make them. Except my moms tuna one during Lent because it has homeade biscuits on top. This was just as comforting as that. I am pregnant with my fourth and this was easy as pie. I did add 1/2 c extra water and 1/4 c extra milk because I used uncooked long grain rice. I cooked at 35O covered for two hrs and uncovered for the final 10 minutes. It was perfect. I didn't have chess food so I topped with kraft sliced cheese. Was so good I am going back for seconds.

This tasted very good! First time making it. Adjustments I made were: I didn't use the cream of chicken soup, used 1/2 a jar of Ragu Cheese sauce and 1/2 a cup of sharp cheddar cheese instead of the 1lb of processed cheese. I followed the rest of the recipe as it was. It's great!

Yummy and easy recipe!! We did alter it a bit. Instead of canned chicken, we used fresh boneless/skinless chicken breasts, seasoned with a little bit of salt & pepper, chopped them into pieces and fried them (next time I'll bake the chicken but I was in a itme crunch). We also added 1 cup of mayo and a teaspoon of curry powder. Gave it just the right kick! Next time I'm going to try adding fresh mushrooms!

This was a nice, warm meal. Used the suggestion of onion soup mix which was good flavoring, and used fresh broccoli. Will make again. Thanks!

Total hit in our house. I have made it twice already at my husbands request. The man who does not eat broccoli loves to eat this.

I was so excited to make this casserole on a cold winter Sunday, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. The onion was so strong and tasted raw. I should have known better than to leave it in the recipe. It really overpowered the whole casserole. I will make this again in the future without the onion.

It's a plus in my household! You can eat with with any dish: brats, burgers, hot dogs, ham, turkey, steaks. You can even eat it by itself, like soup. I like to make mine a little cheesier, and my husband likes to add shredded mozzerella cheese towards the end of baking.

It was very good, but I am not a fan of processed Cheese especially not that much!  Next time I will either substitute it for another kind of cheese or leave it out altogether.  I also cooked the chicken myself, and I recommend adding some salt and pepper and garlic to the ingredients.

Five stars after some edits to the original. Its a great base recipe - I used cooked brown rice, 3 cooked chicken breasts, 2 cans cream of mushroom, same amt. milk, frozen broccoli florets, one onion sauteed in 2T butter, and 8oz shredded sharp cheddar. Added pepper, but no extra salt.   Came out great! Rich, creamy, cheesy. I was worried about the "artificialness" of all the prepacked stuff, so I tried to minimize as much as possible. Will definitely make again - maybe with fat free soup next time to health it up a little more, and maybe with wild rice just for fun.

I had to make a few changes since I was out of some things and we are literally snowed in. I used brown rice (not instant) cooked in chicken broth. And threw in some pieces of left over rotisserie chicken. I made my own cream of chicken soup (I normally do this anyway: 3 tbsp. butter and one chicken bouillon cube melted over medium heat. Add 3 tbsp. of flour and 1/4 water. Add enough fat free milk to give it a soup-y consistency). I left out the 1/4 c. butter since there was already 6 tbsp of butter in the soup. I used a little over 1/2 c. of mozzarella cheese and 4 crumbled slices of american cheese. I topped it off with a few crushed up Wheat Thins. VERY GOOD!! My husband loved it and I really didn't think he would! My two year old son also enjoyed it! I will definitely be making this again!

I did improvise a little.  I don't like chicken in a can so I boiled three large boneless chicken breasts and set them aside and I used the 2 cups of chicken broth to cook the 2 cups of rice in.  While I was cooking the rice I shredded the chicken.  I used extra sharp shredded cheddar instead of the processed cheese food and I left out the cream of chicken.  It was fabulous.  Thank you.

Nothing short of a disaster.  I followed the recipe exactly.  In fact, I was just putting it in the oven thinking it looked perfect when I realized I had not added any water.  I added one and that made it REAL watery, so I decided to check on it to add the other.  I kept checking and checking and the water never went down.  I finally took it out and had to dump it in portions into a strainer, and soak it with paper towels.  After, I put it back in the oven with more cheese until it melted.  It tasted fantastic after that.  Well, except for the onion- I'm an onion fanatic, and added a whole medium onion and it was too much.  But besides those two things, this recipe is really good.  Just leave out the water.

Spectacular! i made a few changes though. I skipped the water. I used fresh chicken and poached it and cut into small cubes. i used only 1 can of cream of chicken. i used 3/4 of a pound of shredded chedder ( i didnt have a full pound). i used a packet of onion soup mix insterad of onions. and fresh broccoli and i just steamed it in the microwave. So quite a few changes but stil the same idea. And it came out wondeful! There was some complaints about a soupy texture, so thats why i skipped the water and the other cream of can. I like my casserole to be thick.

This was very tasty!  I used brown rice and cut up broiled chicken. I used a packet of onion soup and a diced onion, used colby-jack and sharp chedder cheese, no processed. Put a layer of cheese on top for the last 15 min. Next time I will add crunchy fried onions on top! Yum!

Very good - quick and easy for weeknight dinner.  Used 3 rotisserie chicken breasts (from 2 rotisserie chickens), 2 cups cooked rice from chinese restaurant leftovers, 98% fat free soups, 2% velveeta, skim milk, broccoli florets, and omitted the butter.  Great consistency, very rich despite no butter - can't imagine needing it.  I'm guessing leftovers will be even tastier.  Hearty and makes a lot!

This came out amazing. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and a half a can of campbells cheeder cheese. I added a little garlic and it was perfect. I even prepped it and the put it in the fridge for 6 hours and then baked it later. Still came out wonderful, thanks!

This is very similar to my Grandma's recipe:)  It is a wonderful recipe that my entire family loves.  The only difference is I don't add the chunk chicken.  We make it as a side dish and don't feel the need for the added chicken.  The chicken flavor from the cream of chicken soup is enough.  I also use 1 1/2 sticks of butter to cook the onion and broccoli instead of the 1/4 cup.  It adds a lot of flavor(and calories) but we prefer it this way.  I also use one jar of cheez whiz instead of a whole pound...a lb makes it a little too cheesy.  Overall a Delicious recipe. Thanks

i LOVE brocolli cheese rice casserole but i've definitely had better. 1lb of cheese is insane first off. and im not a huge fan of processed cheese anyway so i cut a few chunks up of velvetta cheese and threw those in. My boyfriend and i dont much caref for onions either so i put rougly 1/2 onion soup in and still got the flavour without the onion chunks. Other than those little changes it wasn't a terrible recipe.

I couldn't bear to eat canned chicken, so I used chicken breasts.  I also added some cheddar for a richer flavor.  This was a good simple dish that didn't take much effort.

I liked this stuff, 'cause I love Broccoli, Rice, and Cheese. My husband thought it was too cheesy (is that possible???) and too salty. So I'm giving it a 4 instead of 5 for those things.

This was great! I substituted a mix of cheddar and colby jack cheeses. I used low sodium soups and sauteed the onions. I also used fresh chicken instead of canned chicken because I needed to use up some chicken that I had defrosted. I will definitely make this again!

Big Hit in my household. I took a few other reviewers advice and took out the butter,cooked my own chicken breast and added 1/2 a package of onion soup mix. I also sprinkled crushed Ritz crackers on top and baked an extra 10 minutes. My 5 year son who never eats broccoli finally ate it. So thats a plus for me. It also served about 6 people a good size serving. This will definitely be put into our dinner rotation.

Well. My guy and I were disappointed/confused with this one. While it was very tasty, it seemed more like a side dish. Too much rice/cheese, hardly noticed the chicken in there. It was like eating a big bowl of rice-a-roni for dinner, left us wishing for an actual entree! What I would do next time: Make the recipe as directed EXCEPT, leave out the chicken, and serve as a side dish with whole chicken breasts.

I agree do not use all of the processed cheese.  Just eyeball it and use your preference.  Use a tiny butter.  Overall I think it is great because it is so easy and tasty!

This was good comfort food. Even my husband who was making noises about maybe having soup instead ended up having two servings. I did use leftover chicken from roast chicken made earlier in the week, and I used shredded cheddar, but other than that I didn't make any big changes. I did add a liberal amount of pepper, garlic and onion powder. This is a great way to use up leftovers, it's quick and next time I make it I'll freeze half of it. Thanks for a great dinner.

I used 2 1/2 cups of leftover roasted chicken and followed some of the advise of others here.  Used a quarter lb of cubed valveeta and some mozerella and swiss I had laying around.  Another reviewer suggested 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 sour cream.  Did that, along with 1/2 packet of onion soup mix.  Also added 2 tablespoons of Miracle Whip, a tablespoon of lemon juice and sprinkled Paprika over the top once it was put together.  This is a great base recipe to add whatever touches you like.  2 Adults and 1 5 year old ate almost the whole pan.  I couldn't stop.  With salad and garlic bread, this was a winner.

I pretty much made this exactly as listed (I'm a firm believer in trying the recipe as designed before making changes) but I added some garlic powder and some Fox Point seasoning from Penzey's Spices.  It was really good!  It is one of those dishes that will sneak up on you if you have seconds and feel kinda heavy in your tummy though, so be warned.  :)  Will definitely make again.

This recipe definitely needs some tweaking.  We only used 1/2 lb (8oz) of Velveeta, but it was still way too much.  Next time I will try with less or with a different type of cheese.  I also used fresh broccoli (no need to cook beforehand!) and some chopped chicken breast that I had made previously and froze.  Finally, I used brown rice, 98% fat free soups, 2% milk Velveeta, skim milk and margarine...made this just a bit more healthy!

My 2 small kids loved it, my boyfriend loved and even I thought it was pretty good. I used 1 can of cream of celery instead of mushroom Or cream of chicken because that was all I had. I also used several different kind of cheeses like sliced cheese, shredded taco cheese and some monterrey chedder. It was very tasty. I used boneless chicken breast also. Others who do the same may want to cook chicken half way(at least) before putting in oven because my dish took about an hour and 15 minutes because I placed casserole in oven with the chicken practically raw I just sauteed for a couple mins. It was very good and it was not soupy at all. It was thick and very filling! No leftover tonight!

I made this for my girlfriend for dinner tonight and it was fantastic. I have plenty of leftovers and am looking forward to dinner tomorrow as well. She loved this meal, said it was one of the best normal night dinners I've ever made for her (I've made some pretty spectacular special occasion meals). Desert was also fantastic.

I reduced the water to 1 and a half cups and still found the recipe to be quite soupy at first.  I'd likely decrease the milk by half next time I make it.  The taste was fantastic and my family enjoyed it.  I took it as leftovers for lunch the following day and thought it tasted better than the night before - primarily b/c it was no longer soupy?  Perhaps I'll allow it to sit a bit longer before serving it next time.  All in all, a good recipe that I'll make again.

My family really liked this recipe.  I let Costco bake my chicken for me and then added it to the recipe.  I sauted my onion and added 2 tsp minced garlic.  Turned out fantastic.  Will make again real soon!

This is a great weeknight meal for when you are stumped on what to cook! I used cooked and cubed chicken breast (leftover works great too) and added shredded cheddar to the top. Don't forget the onions. MMMMMM...

This was the first casserole I have made besides the green bean casserole.  I altered the recipe a little according to previous reviews.  Instead of canned chicken I diced up a pound of fresh chicken and cooked it in a frying pan.  I also used 1 and 1/2 cups long grain rice and cooked it in 3 cups chicken broth.  I combined all of the ingredients except for the broccoli, rice, and chicken in a bowl to make sure the binding ingredients were well mixed.  Then I added the broccoli, rice, and chicken and mixed well.  I put the mixture into a 9x13 pan.  I crushed up Lays plain potato chips really well and mixed with butter and spread the mixture on top to make a crunchy topping.  I baked the casserole for an extra 10 minutes.  My husband LOVES casseroles and I was worried that this wouldn't live up to par for him but he ate two helpings and had it for almost every meal for the rest of the weekend.  Great recipe with the few revisions!

This recipe was delicious. I substituted shrimps instead of chicken and I got rave reviews. I've made it a second time and it still did last long in my house. Found something that my hard to please children even liked. Thanks a million.

I tried to make this healthier by using brown rice, reduced fat soup, real shredded cheese, and added more broccoli than the recipe called for.  I also used fresh chicken breasts instead of canned.  I just cooked them on the stove on a lightly greased skillet and then cut them into chunks.  As many other reviews have said, it needs some tweaking, but once you make the changes, it is a 5 star recipe!!

I took the advice of other and changed the recipe a little.. First I add two cans of soup, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. Second I also per-cooked the rice. I only used 16 oz of cheese..8oz shredded and 8oz jack..I also add some curry,about a tbs spoon.. My boyfriend who only eats his mothers cooking ate two plate's and then ask when I was going to make it a again.. Great recipe, but you do have to change it around a little..

This recipe was really good with some small adjustments. I omitted the chicken to accomodate vegetarians and made it as a side dish for a BBQ. I did not use instant rice, but 2 1/2 cups normal long-grain rice cooked through. Also, I heated the butter, milk, soups, and cheese together over the stove until everything had an even consistency. This prevented too much of one ingredient being taken in a mouthful. I also added creole seasoning and fresh ground black pepper to the mixture. Then I just stirred in the broccoli and cooked rice, then spread it into a pan. I refrigerated it and then baked it off later covered with tinfoil. All in all, this recipe turned out really good with the minor method change and everyone love it.

This is always a great stand-by recipe. I left out the onion and mixed in half a can of French's friend onions. Baked for 30 minutes and topped it off with the other half of the fried onions. Yum!

Well, it's not my new favorite food, but overall, it was good. I made a lower-fat version with fat free cream of chicken soups and regular shredded cheese. I sauted the onion with some garlic in the butter, used some regular rice (cooked in the rice maker) and used fresh chicken, which I baked first in the oven in the same casserole dish that I used to bake the finished product. It was easy and comforting. I'll make this again.

I used 1/2 Velveeta & 1/2 shredded cheddar and it turned out great! I was worried the rice would be gooey from all of the cooking but it was perfect... When eating leftovers I microwaved some peas & tossed them in- it was really good that way! Thanks!

My husband and son love this dish but it is better when fresh brocolli is substituted and not as much cheese is used. I never use chicken out of the can so I think it is always best to use chicken cooked your favorite way then shred it for a yummy dish!

This was good, but very rich.  I used fresh chicken, cut the butter by half, used 1/2 processed cheese and 1/2 shredded sharp cheddar, and used the healthy request version of each soup.

This was very delicious... and was loved by my whole family, including the 13-month old (pureed) and a 3 year old. I sauteed some chicken breasts with paprika instead  of using the canned chicken. When they were almost cooked, I added the chopped onion and the butter. I used healthy request soups... and 1/2 velveeta 1/2 normal cheddar. I didn't have a full pkg of broccoli, so used 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 peas & carrots. Yum! Will definitely make again, but will probably only use 1/2 of the butter.

Overall pretty good!  I did take the advice of some other reviewers though.  I used brown rice and cooked it in chicken stock, sauteed my onions beforehand, and used cooked chicken breasts instead.  I did substitute the cream of mushroom for cream of celery (I think that made a big difference) and I did not add the butter or milk as the recipe calls for.  I also think that 1 lb. of cheese is way too much.  I used some shredded marble cheddar and about half of 1 lb. of velveeta and that was plenty.  My husband liked it -- so with the changes this recipe is a hit.

I am giving this 4 stars because it was really yummy and tasty and quite filling but even after seasoning it quite well I felt it needed more still. I made it with leftover chicken from a slow baked whole fryer chicken. That made it so good! Here is a tip though, follow the recipe about the rice! First time I made it I thought I could get away with not precooking the rice but it ruined the entire casserole! Be sure and cook the rice as it says! This is a really tasty and good home-cooked meal, would recommend!

COOK THE ONIONS BEFORE SERVING! I added raw onions which was a big mistake. The raw onion threw off the entire flavor of the meal. I had to throw the whole thing out. The flavor was great. I used fresh broccoli, real shredded cheese, freshly cooked chicken breast, and I cooked the rice on the side and mixed it all together at the end. I put it in a casserole dish and put it in the oven. I will make it again, but I will saute the onions before I cooked them. (I need to add that I used sweet vidalia onions, not the reccomended small white onions.

Good recipe. Next time I will leave out the canned chicken or cook chicken breasts and cut it up. The canned chicken tasted abnormal. Overall it was okay, but I will change some things next time.

Delicous. Thanks to the other users' tips, we used 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 regular cheddar, and added 1 clove garlic. My 21-mth-old asked for seconds!! Hooray!

My wife, children, and grand-children all loved it!  Everyone got seconds, and thirds.  My son doesn't like mushrooms, so I used cream of celery.  In addition, I left out the onion.  I will be making this again!

This was really tasty dish for being so simple. I did use the canned chicken but next time I think I will use leftover cooked chicken. I didn't know what to do about the butter, so I melted it in the microwave and then added it. I think this would be good with a topping of crushed ritz crackers w/ melted butter, may try that too. Easy, inexpensive, delish meal.

What a nice, versatile recipe!  My college chums all liked it, and what was left over was AMAZING baked with a little extra cheese in some store-bought crescent roll dough.  Like some others, I made some substitutions -- poached chicken left over from making soup instead of canned, 1/4 lb sharper cheese instead of "cheese food", not-instant white rice cooked to the packages specifications (later left out the milk to account for extra liquid).  Delish.

The recipe is easy and quick to make.  I left out the onion and added mushrooms.  When I make it again I am going to add more chicken.  My granddaughter went back for seconds and thirds.

This was a good comfort food type of casserole.  I used left over chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly...it was somewhat soupy after 30 minutes, but firmed up a little after 10 more minutes.  After sitting for a few more minutes, it was the consistency you would expect.  I did not think there would be enough cheese in it, but the flavor was really good.  Most of my family ate it and enjoyed it--but my 2 year old kept asking if he could have plain broccoli instead. 

Overall, a good recipe, but not outstanding.

I didn't like this recipe at all, it came out soupy and salty.  The onion wouldn't  have been so strong and overpowering if I had sauteed it first.  I will not make again.

This was a family favorite, every one enjoyed it. I did use 2 chicken breasts boiled and shreded. I also used 1 lb of velvetta cheese. Next time I make this I am going to use onion soup mix instead of onions. Other wise this was a really good meal. Serve with rolls and maybe a side salad and it would be perfict.

I use the frozen broccoli with cheese instead of processed cheese. I really like this recipe, but my husband does not like the canned chicken so we use fresh. I also use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and it's fab.

This stuff is FANTASTIC, with all the changes the other posters have suggested plus a couple more. I used 3 chicken breast halves, which I baked the night before in chicken broth with salt & pepper. I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to the water used to make the rice. I also added the Lipton Dry Soup Mix instead of onion and cream of broccoli soup instead of cream of mushroom. I used 8oz. Velveeta and 8oz. cheddar and monterey jack. SUPREME!! A keeper for SURE!

This is good. I like it mainly because I can have everything on hand and cook it and not have to thaw anything out.  I use the shredded Velveeta for convenience.

This was very good.  I used regular rice and poached boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I sauteed the onions in butter first, then added the soups, milk and cheese until heated through, added everything else and baked.  Yum.

This was very good, but I made a lot of changes - regular rice instead of instant, grilled chicken instead of canned, 1 can broth instead of soups, no butter, 
fresh broccoli (blanched) instead of frozen, real cheese (I only used a cup, I will probably use more next time), I also chopped a few jalapenos and put them in.  Leftovers were especially good for lunch the next day.

We really enjoyed this. I've made this as a side dish for years (w/out the chicken), and it's the only way I can get my kids to eat their broccoli.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and omitted the cream of chicken (I didn't have any.)  I also omitted the butter, but sautéed the onions in 1tbs. of butter.  I used 8oz. of velveeta cheese and then spinkled some shredded cheddar on top.  It turned out great!

Just Ok....I omitted the chicken and decided to make it as a side dish. I think I will use regular shredded cheddar cheese next time. It had an odd taste with that whole block of processed cheese. Thought it was too runny and didnt like the texture that much. Will try again with real cheese and less milk.

This was good but I changed to rice to basmati, cooked my chicken instead of the kinds of soup I used cream of broccoli and cream of chicken and added a little extra water, no milk. On top I used grated cheddar cheese, then added crushed potato chips and slivered almonds. Topped it with a dash of paprika. I made this for a Church potluck and everyone raved.  Thanks.

This was pretty good.  My husband didn't find it fabulous, but I thought it was flavorful and easy to make.  I tried to cut some of the fat and didn't use quite so much cheese and it was still very cheesy.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used cream of celery soup instead of the cream of mushroom - and also used cream of chicken with herbs instead of plain cream of chicken.  Also I found fresh brocolli works great in place of the frozen brocolli.  Thai Jasmine rice works great with this recipe too!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I took other suggestions and used a pre-cooked deli chicken and shredded into bite sized pieces. This turned out to be my husband's new favorite casserole. He ate a whole pan in two days! This will definitely become a regular with my family.

This was a very easy and very good recipe! Even my picky boyfriend ate it. I used cream of chicken, and cream of broccoli soup and added some garlic powder to it. I also cooked my rice in chicken broth instead of water.

This dish did not impress me.  It tasted okay... I ate my serving and my husband had seconds, but my toddler did not touch it.  I didn't think this dish looked appetizing, either, which may not matter to some.  I used Velveeta cheese and added the onion and it still seemed a little bland.  It was certainly edible but not something I plan to make again.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I am recently married and am trying to find things to cook for my husband.  He loved this.  I used Velveeta and I think next time I will use less cheese.  It was a little overwhelming, but Velveeta is pretty rich stuff as it is.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I loved the idea of this, but somehow it just didn't taste right. I'll stick to my plain old broccoli cheese casserole recipe.

My family loves this!  I like preparing one-dish meals because I can sneak the veggies in on my husband, although he actually knows they are in there!  I have gotten him to eat more vegetables by starting him out with them in a dish such as this!

Yummmmmm!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I prefer to cube boneless, skinless chicken breasts and with yummy seasonings.  I also use cooked brown rice, no butter, & less milk to make it healthier. Delicious - we make it twice a month at least!

It was extremely easy to make.  I too precooked the onions.  It took me maybe 10 minutes to throw this all together.  I bought canned chicken, frozen broccoli and all.  Only thing I had to cook was the onion.  Otherwise I tossed it together and that was the end of it.  Everyone loved it.  Definite keeper.  Goes well with any fruit side too...

Very good but next time I'll leave out the onion (they were too crispy and my hubby didn't care for that). Otherwise it's a pretty good recipe and will be keeper!

I thought it was excellent! I did also use the onion soup mix and had excellent flavor, didn't think it was too soupy. Used 8oz of cheddar jack and that was plenty of cheese.

I didn't use instant rice... I used left over rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken. Also used cream of celery and cream of mushroom. I used shredded Mexican cheese and melted the butter to make it easier to mix in. Used frozen broccoli florets so there's not a lot of stems. Added in green beans as well.... Was going to do carrots but didn't have any.

Very good, used half melted Processed cheese and half shredded cheddar cheese and mixed together. I put too much chicken in it and added more rice to compensate and a little water. Will make again. I refrigerated before cooking and cooked for 50 min when ready.

Just ate a goodly helping of this - it was good! We cooked the rice 1st in veggie broth. We also changed it up as follows, mostly just to use ingredients on hand: green onion, 10 oz. processed cheese + 4 oz. shredded sharp white cheddar, 1/2c sour cream + 1/2c broth (instead of milk), 2 fresh raw broccoli crowns, 10 oz. quorn chik'n cubes, and a squirt of sriracha. Will probably make again soon with no sriracha for the kiddos.

Five stars with adjustments... otherwise I would give it a 3 as is. Like a lot of people I cut the Velveeta way back, probably in half. I also used a couple of boxes of Uncle Ben's original recipe instead of instant white. The seasoning that came in the box complimented this recipe nicely. I also cut up a few chicken breasts and cooked them in a pan with the onion and I also added a few cloves of minced garlic. The hubs and I both loved it and will be making it again.

Very delish and easy to make.I cut the recipe in half. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, and used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the cheese food.  Seasoned with salt and pepper and only baked it for about 20 mins. Came out wonderful!

WOW, a new favorite. The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted cream of celery.  Everyone loved this recipe.

The recipe itself sounded ok, until the canned chicken. I made some changes based on what others said and it came out very good. Real chicken baked, 3/4 the cheese and onion soup. Tasty! 3 stars for the mods.

This was a great recipe. I changed it up slightly but pretty much the same. I cooked the onion and added 2 lbs of chicken tenders instead of canned. I added sea salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I used 2 10 oz bags of broccoli.  I also used 2 3/4 of a cup of rice instead of 2. Just added 3/4 of a cup of water extra. I also added more of the block cheese, about 2 oz extra. I added the milk butter and block cheese to the chicken in the pan so that they could mix with the chicken juices and melt together.  I mixed the soups together in the casserole dish and added the warm mixture of the cheesy chicken. Added the rice then the broccoli and topped with panko bread crumbs tossed with melted butter. (About 2 Tbs Butter to 1 cup of crumbs. I baked that bad boy for 35 minutes and it was perfect.

Halved the milk and butter, used 3 cups of rice, and only used part of a can of cream of mushroom since my enjoyment of mushrooms is very low. Also used shredded cheddar cheese on top just to cover the dish instead of a pound of cheese product. Very good! Got about 5-6 meals out of this dish.

This was great!  I really changed none of the ingredients but I did use fresh diced up chicken.  I used fresh broccoli and sauteed the broccoli and onion together then tossed them in the casserole.  I also used fresh grated cheese.  I'm sure it would have been just as good with canned , frozen, and processed foods I just prefer the fresh ingredients.  I highly recommend.

Made this tonight and it was a hit!! Even with my little picky eater. She actually gave me a thumbs up!! I did tweak it a bit. 1/2 cup uncooked rice makes about 1 cup cooked. I halved the recipe using 1 cream of mushroom soup. I used 3 mini cups of minute microwaveable rice ( for 1/2 recipe)Sautéed  mushrooms (a little less than half a pack of sliced mushrooms) and half of a chopped onion container and garlic. I  used baked chicken from Albertsons. 2 large breasts and cut it into small pieces. Used about 4 oz of shredded cheddar and 4 oz jack - maybe a little more instead of processed cheese. I also steamed the broccoli beforehand as well. Added 1/2 Lipton onion mix for half recipe. Stirred all ingredients in a bowl and then put in an 8x8 glass dish sprayed lightly with Pam. I then topped with shredded jack cheese and crushed Ruffles Potato Chips. Then watch in oven until bubbly! Great as leftovers  too! Enjoy!!

The only changes I made were based on other reviews. I used Colby Jack shredded cheese and chicken broth instead of water. Followed everything else exactly and it’s delicious.

This was ok, but not spectacular. But the potential is there for sure! I used Basmati rice, cheddar and provolone cheeses (not the fake stuff). I also boiled fresh chicken breast in water, broth, and seasonings including salt, pepper, italian seasoning,  powder, and onion powder- no canned chicken! I will use more seasoning next time, and fresh veggies- not frozen.

Next time; using more rice, more chicken, and WAY less onion. Even with the smallest onion I could find, it tastes more like an onion and cheese casserole. Plus up here above 5k feet I had to cook it for almost an hour.  I’m glad I married a garbage disposal that will eat anything - but I couldn’t finish mine

Great basic recipe! I made some revisions like others. I used fresh broccoli and cooked it with the onion to soften both. I used 2 cups I cooked rice with 4 cups chicken broth. I had 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs that I pan cooked in some avocado oil and salt and pepper then cut them up. I used a cup of coconut cream instead of milk which made it very creamy. I used an Irish block cheese that I grated for the cheese. It gave it a great nutty flavor. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this again for the family.

This is a perfect one-dish, busy-or-night-off great and so-easy recipe that you can, as you may have noticed, take some liberties with, which I did!  I did not vary from the basic instructions, nor did I leave out the onion but  I chopped and used the breast of a freshly-baked hen breast from a roaster we had cooked earlier that was in the fridge, used about 1/2 of the listed  Velveeta,  one each of the low-fat/healthier Campbell's Cream of Mushroom & Celery Soups, used two medium florets of fresh brocolli from my vegetable crisper which I just steamed in a small amount of water until crisp-tender and broke/cut apart upon which I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and squeezed half a lemon;  then used half the real butter listed here substituting the other half with a healthy alternative  "Melt Organic Butter".  It was easy to make use of a cooked frozen pack of seasoned Quinoa and a pack of frozen Jasmine rice from the freezer for the grand total of adapted ingredients.  I had recently topped a casserole w/ Parmesan and "Panko", or  bread crumbs, so I made use of the  ingredients as a finish before putting the casserole into the oven,  first dotting it  with some small pieces of the organic "butter".  This was still fine despite stirring at 20 or 30 minutes during the baking time, adding a light crispy part to the finish.  BTW, the Red Quinoa was in a frozen mix with brown rice and Asian spices so it adds great flavor.   I encourage everyone to use their ingredients from thei

This was a good basic recipe,  but we like a little more flavor so I added sour cream (2 cups) along with a bit more of the 1/2 cup milk. I added probably 2 Tablespoons (a little more?) of Tarragon which adds a very refreshing flavor.   I will try adding fresh mushrooms and sliced black olives next time.  Makes a lot...we empty-nesters  will be eating this for a week unless we freeze it in small portions.  
Thanks for a great starter recipe!

I made this with modifications. Half the processed cheese (Velveeta) and added some shredded sharp cheddar. I sauteed chicken chunks with onion and olive oil and added soups, milk and Velveeta. microwaved long grain white rice (10mins on high, 20mins on half power, cover microwave safe bowl with a dinner plate)

I made the following changes to the recipe- I baked some chicken breasts and shredded them, I used 2 cups of shredded cheese instead of the processed cheese, I used my rice cooker to cook the rice and after reading other reviews decided to make 3 cups of rice instead of 2 which definitely worked nicely and the recipe didn’t specify whether you needed to cook the frozen broccoli first or not so I cooked mine first before adding it to the mixture. With all changes it added some time to making the meal. Total with prep and cooking it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to make it and was well worth it. We all loved it and there are plenty of leftovers! I will absolutely make this again.

Steamed fresh broccoli. Used real cheese, pre-grated and a pre-cooked mix of quinoa and brown rice with seasonings included. These changes make for ease of preparation and improved nutritional content.

I looked for a recipe that used chicken, rice and broccoli. I only made it once but changed it slightly. The chicken was leftover from a store bought roasted chicken. To make it healthier I cooked brown rice in my rice cooker. The broccoli was frozen and thawed.  The onion was sauted in olive oil along with a green pepper.  To reduce the calories  I only used one can of cream of chicken soup and about 1/3 lb. of Velveeta cheese. I also added curry powder to taste.

This is a great base recipe I make often. I will often mix this up ahead and refrigerate or freeze it. I do not prepare the instant rice first, I just mix it in with the water, cream soup (I make SOS soup or sauce mix) and shredded cheese. I use fresh or dried onion, lawry’s garlic salt, and pepper to taste. I also us fresh shredded Colby jack, but no where near a whole pound. I also typically cook frozen chicken breasts in a crock pot with salt and pepper then shred it in my KitchenAid mixer, rather than use canned chicken. The whole family loves it. You can throw in whatever veggies, sometimes I just mix in leftover veggies but have also made it with frozen broccoli and cauliflower blend.

I liked this dish. Will make it again. Just like few other reviewers, I have made few substitutions, but overall I have followed the recipe. I have subscribed rice to cauliflower, can chicken to Rotisserie Chicken and whatever shredded cheese that I had in the house.

I baked 2 large chicken breasts for this instead of canned and  used the broth to cook rice in. I also used real cheddar cheese, and added a little sour cream! So yummy! Only complaint is the onions didn't soften all the way but I didn't mind too much prob could've cut them smaller or cooked a little longer. I will be making again! oh I also added salt and pepper!

This was really, really good! I used basamati rice and sharp shredded cheddar. I’ll be making this again. My husband hates broccoli, but I think he’ll enjoy this.

I usually make chicken divan from scratch...... fresh broccoli, poached chicken, homemade  cheese sauce.  It's time consuming.  I  had leftover long grain rice, and rotisserie chicken.  I put the rice in a casserole.  Placed a layer of broccoli florets, thawed, on top of rice.  I mixed a can of cr. of chicken, cheddar broccoli and some milk.  Poured on half and sprinkled with shredded cheddar.  Next topped it with chicken chunks, remaining soup mix, and a little more cheddar.  Topped with Italian bread crumbs.  This turned out quite good, and so easy to put together.  Will make again!

It was definitely very easy for a busy worknight. I used regular white rice but other than that everything the same. The canned chicken did not sit well with me and while I love cheese it was a little much. Definitely an easy recipe that will keep you full though.

We really liked this one. I did use actual cheese rather than processed cheese product. I used sargentos 2 different kinds of shredded cheese. I highly recommend using the onion, it adds a nice surprising crunch to a mostly soft casserole. I will definitely make this one again!

Kids, ages 9, 11, 13 really enjoyed it!  The next morning my son asked if he could take it in his lunch!!!  Music to my ears.

I did reduce the Velveeta cheese to 1/2 pound and used a rotisserie chicken instead of canned chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Score one for Dad making a dinner the kids liked!

Great casserole! Everyone loves it, even my 20m old daughter.

If you want to use fresher ingredients..
Steam 1.5 broccoli heads cut in pieces
Boil 2 large chicken breasts for 30 mins, cut into 1/2" pieces

For more clarification in the process..
Cook onions in butter for a few mins to make them not so crunchy.
Combine ingredients in a large bowl in this order: soups, milk, onion and butter (mix well), then add rice, broccoli, chicken and cheese (fold) then put in casserole dish.

Love the flavor! This was so easy to make and I usually have everything on hand already. I used about 3/4 of the cheese and added parsley and black pepper. Yum! I did wish it had another textural element as it was a bit mushy. But I will definitely make this again! Tip: Add the butter to the rice after it's cooked and still warm so the butter will melt well.

I didn't use the canned chicken and my family loves it I use the already cooked grilled chicken and cut it up into bite-size pieces.

I had to substitute 16 oz shredded cheddar, browned cut chicken breast, frozen broccoli florets, 1 cup cooked white rice, topped with plain bread crumbs. Delicious!!!

This is a great starting point.
I used my rice cooker for the rice  while I cooked two chicken breasts and cut them up.  Also I don't like Velveeta type cheese so I used about 1lb of shredded mild cheddar. 
My 5 yr old ate every bite on his plate!
That's a win in my book!

It was awesome. I followed a suggestion in the reviews and used onion soup mix instead of onions. Next time I will just use onions. It turned out just a little salty for my taste.

The calories and fat grams were kind of high so I lightened it up a bit by using low fat cheese (and not as much!) and heart healthy soup.  Used Jasmine rice because that's what we eat, fresh broccoli and my family loves carrots so added to it. Added some garlic powder, paprika and a little basil. Because I had to alter it I gave it a 4. Wasn't bad!

Mine turned out great. I left out the mushroom soup because I ran out of room in my casserole dish. But, I didn’t experience the soupiness like other reviewers mentioned. After the first 15 min stir, I added crushed Ritz crackers (1 sleeve) and baked uncovered. My boyfriend said it was deceptively delicious!

This is a super simple recipe that can feed about 4-6 people.  I made it the first time exactly how the directions say to and it was good, but I felt there was not enough rice in it and the canned chicken isn't the best flavor.  I made it again last night and I used 2 bags of the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice and it was much better. I think next time I will use cut up chicken breast. Even though that will take longer I think it will give it a better taste. Overall as is it is tasty and easy to make.

I did make this recipe however I did tweak the recipe, I don’t like canned chicken so I used boneless skinless chicken breast. I did use the instant rice however I swapped it for brown rice and still boiled in broth for that extra flavor. It came out great and my family loved it and have been wanting me to cook it again since!

Changed it up a bit. Used Cream of Broccoli Soup instead of the Mushroom Soup. I used real Broccoli, not frozen. Used Red Onion instead of White Onions. The Red has a better flavour. And lastly, I used shredded cheese instead of Cheese Food!
Now it is the perfect quick weeknight dinner.

Used roasted chicken instead of canned. Did not use celery instead substituted 1 can cream of celery soup. Used 1 cup heavy cream instead of milk since last time came out too runny.  Cream made it thick and rich!  Kids love it and it’s so easy to throw together on a busy day!

The picture made me salivate and then I made it and I was very disappointed.  It was just an average dish and while eating it, it came to mind that I had it before at a friends house years ago and my feeling was that it was just okay.  Instead of canned chicken, I bought fresh chicken breasts and it said processed cheese, didn't know what kind to go for so I just bought a mix of cheddar and whatever.  Easy dish to prepare, it makes a lot and is definitely filling.  Doubt that I will make it again, I saw another similar recipe that I will try next.

I pretty much followed the recipe as is. I was going to substitute the onion gravy packet for the onion like some of the comments suggested but then I completely forgot. It still turned out amazingly well. Definitely a repeat recipe.

Made with white rice that was already cooked when I threw the ingredients together. Topped it with sliced provolone cheese and put in some red pepper flakes to add a little spice.

So, my recipe is on the same principle, but easier and better. Canned chicken? No! I soften a stick of butter. Mix it with one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken. 1 cup diced  onion, 1 cup diced celery. 1 16 oz jarCheese Whiz, 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cups minute rice (not cooked-raw), and leftover chicken. NOT CANNED!!! Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Deliciousness!

This recipe caught my eye since we enjoy the frozen store bought version.  I hardly ever have on hand everything to make a recipe so I usually improvise.I used 1  cup long grain rice made with 2 cups chicken broth.  1 can of cream of chicken soup and then filled about 2/3 of the empty can with low fat Greek yogurt with more broth to the top of the can since I had no cream of mushroom soup.  A good splash of milk, maybe half a cup.  A 20 oz. bag of frozen broccoli and 1 can 10 oz. and 1 can 5 oz. of drained chicken breast.   Maybe 3/4 cup of chopped onions and a handful of shredded cheddar.  Mixed it all up with a few shakes of Old Bay in place of seasoned salt and a bit more black pepper.  Topped with a  cup more of cheddar, covered in foil and baked for 35 minutes.  Removed the foil and sprinkled French's fried onions on top and baked about 10 more minutes til browned.  Let sit about 10 minutes.  Made a ton of changes to use what I had but it came out very tasty!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for except added 1/2 tsp of ground pepper and substituted instant brown rice. Tasty, rich and filling. I'll probably make again.

It was a good idea. I changed it a bit. Used rotisserie chicken and I can't bring myself to use processed cheese so I used "real". Also added fried onion rings to the top.

Not bad for a quick and easy dinner. I gave it 4 stars because it's a good base that you can build/tailor to your liking. One important note for this recipe: I agree with other reviewers that the onion is necessary for flavor! But, the raw onion was still really crunchy after being baked. I'd recommend softening on the stovetop before mixing in the casserole. Then you get the flavor without feeling like you're eating raw onion. Now, I did make a few changes when making this - I used fresh ingredients instead of instant/frozen. Just because that is what I had on hand. If you do use fresh ingredients, here's a few tips: make sure you steam the fresh broccoli first, otherwise it won't be cooked all the way through in the 30 minutes. For the rice, I followed another reviewers suggestion and didn't pre-cook, just mixed it in raw and added a cup of chicken broth to the mix. It tasted great but needed to cook about 45 minutes to get soft, so it takes a bit longer. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Easy. I had to tweak a bit because of what I had/didn't have. Thank you for your recipe and all the other reviews- helped a lot. I used sour cream vs. yogurt, 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup cheddar. No japalenos. Didn't have them. Followed the rest exactly the same except no water- just added the taco seasoning and onions while cooking. Got 7 versus 6. Then after putting them in a 9x13, I poured a jar of enchilada sauce to cover. I baked at 350 for 40 minutes- til I saw the sauce bubble. Again, thanks for a great recipe! This makes 2 nights of dinner!

My boyfriend LOVED this meal!! I used two 12 oz cans of the chunk chicken, I would suggest using more than the recipe calls for, or changing to rotisserie chicken. This recipe has a lot of flavor but the cheese can be overwhelming, by adding more chicken and broccoli can help cut out the overall cheesiness.

This is a terrible recipe.  Bland, plain, and no depth.  Needs a lot more veggies.  I even put in  cayenne pepper - no effect.  

No amount of cheese can save this recipe.

I used fresh broccoli and cheddar cheese. Instead of canned I boiled a chicken and used that meat. I cooked Success rice in the chicken broth. Decided to use onion soup mix. The package said BEEFY onion soup, so Im not sure it was the right kind. It came out very soupy and didn't hold its shape at all. It did firm up some after sitting awhile, but it seemed like it needed something to bind it together. I didn't like the beefy onion taste. Unlike others I couldn't taste much cheese or broccoli at all. I drained the liquid and now I have to try to fix all the problems. Not optimistic though. Not sure where I went wrong.

Fantastic! This recipe is fast, kid-approved comfort food at its best. I doubled the sauce, added about 1 tsp of ground mustard and about 1 Tsp of garlic, added about 1 C more cheddar, mixed all together instead of layering, and sprinkled with panko bread crumbs. Delish!

3 Cups Water and 1.5 Cups Rice with a Dash of Butter in The Rice, Used Boneless Breasts of Chicken instead of Canned and Added Diced Potato to The Broccoli and Cooked Veggies  separate then Mixed, Chicken, Veggies and Onions Together, Then Assembled the Baking Dish. Took a Bit More Time cooking the Chicken and Veggies But More Flavor .

I cooked the rice in chicken broth rather than water, and I added the remaining broth in the box to the two cans of soup. Gave this a good hit of salt and pepper then stirred in half a jar of cheese spread. I used four chicken breasts (precooked) and added both broccoli and corn. Mixed it all up and threw it in the oven for 30 minutes covered and 15 uncovered. Topped with shredded cheddar in the last 15 minutes. Absolutely a winner and lots of leftovers!

I followed the suggestions in other reviews by using a few shredded chicken breasts,  real cheese and cream of broccoli soup. But the two things I will do differently in the future are 1)omit the butter  2) sautee the onions.  This was just way to greasy for my liking and the taste of raw onion overpowered everything.  I was able to pat most of the grease off with paper towel but those doggone onions are too small and too mixed in to do anything about which is a real shame.  I'd love to just devour a big bowl of this but I'm trying to pick my way through and avoid the onions.  I've learned for next time.

I will likely make this again. I love onions but starting with them raw may have been a mistake. Next time I'll saute them a bit before adding them.

Used sharp cheddar and asiago.  Added garlic salt, black pepper and salt.

Made again with cheddar cheese soup instead of mushroom, brown rice, cheddar & pepper jack and ham.  Yum!

I halved the recipe and thought it was a little soupy, so maybe cut back on the water a little bit. I also used cheese singles instead of a block of processed cheese, and it was perfect because it all melted in an even layer on the top.

I was looking for a chicken and rice casserole dish so I could use up some leftover chicken. I would never used canned chicken.. I halved the recipe. I omitted the onions, milk and can of chicken soup.  I  used one 18 ounce can of cream of mushroom soup that was ready to serve. I don't know how much cheese I added, but I used shredded cheese and eyeballed it.. Hubby enjoyed it. I thought it was okay but could use a little seasoning. I will make this again, but I will add garlic or sage or something..

Quick and easy recipe. Instead of canned chicken I used 3 breasts I had on hand sautéed with onions, celery, and a few peppers. I used 1/2 shredded cheddar and  1/2 Velveeta in the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I used the minute rice cooked in broth, and canned chicken because I was very short on time to make it to a party.  I made it gluten free by using Progresso chicken enchilada soup, which added a great flavor.  Use more than 1 can if you need the liquid.  I didn't use milk as the soup is not condensed, but added a 1/4 cup sour cream.  I think I could have added a bit more.  I also used cheddar cheese and (GF) onion soup mix.  People at the party really liked it.

I followed the directions exactly.  I really didn't care for this recipe because all the flavors seemed to run together. I would not make this recipe again. I don't care for recipes that call for canned soup. I just thought I would give it a try.

I'm one of those people who change the recipe so if you don't like that, you can move on or maybe expand your horizons. This was great though! I used quinoa instead of instant rice and regular chicken instead of canned. I did 3/4 lb of cheese, not 1, and subbed a little broccoli for corn. I cooked the quinoa before baking, so I didn't need all the milk. It was a little soupy, so next time I'll cut back to 1/2 cup. I also use almond milk. I didn't grease the pan and it didn't need it, which was surprising. I'll definitely make it again. The second time I cooked orzo and used cheddar cheese. So good!

Little too much cheese. Could probably be reduce by half at the most. I cooked up chicken breast and used that instead of the canned stuff and I used more chicken because meat is good. Its a pretty good recipe and fairly cheap to make.

Delish! Used soup on hand- cream of celery and chicken. Used shredded Monterey/Cheddar instead of processed cheese and about half the amount called for. Added panko bread crumbs on top and melted the butter and poured on top. A good hot meal for a winter night. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good as written! However, I made it second time using long grain rice and rotisserie chicken and it was great too.  So it's a win win either way.  Enjoy.

I did make a couple of changes.  I used long grain rice and 3 cups diced chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and loved it.

This is a quick and easy dinner recipe that everyone loved!  I didn't add the milk and it still came out great!  We have this about twice a month.  The chicken comes out so tender and the rice and broccoli are added treats!
Thank you for posting this free Great recipe.

no changes but  when you half the recipe you can use Campbell's chicken & mushroom soup to get the same flavor. I live alone so I use this often.

I made a few changes. I used 3 skinless boneless chicken breast, which I cooked on the stove until it was lightly cooked before adding to mix. I used fresh broccoli and carrots. Because my vegetables were fresh I steamed them for a few mintues before adding it to the pan with the other ingredients. I also used Jasmine rice instead of instant rice (only because I like that rice better than instant rice). Other than that simple fix and tasted great!!

Easy and quick to whip up but definitely bland. Might have to try some extra flavors next time. Also, I used fresh chicken breast instead of the canned stuff.

It was similar to jambalaya in consistency. Pretty good, but ricey and a little mushy.

Made it with a few exceptions: took the suggestions from other reviewers and added fresh chicken breast (diced), cooked the broccoli, cooked onion with chicken, and added provolone on top of casserole. I also seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. Turned out ok. Not bland, but not anything to write home about either. Probably wouldn't make again.

This was a really great dish EXCEPT for the fact that you should probably use real chicken breasts to make it taste better. I boiled it and seasoned it with pink Himalayan sea salt, garlic powder, garlic salt, and garlic sea salt (see a pattern here?). After letting it come to a boil and then bringing it down to a simmer for 15-20 minutes or so, I pulled it out of the pan and then shredded the chicken and continued to let it simmer on low heat while I prepared the casserole dish. After that the chicken was fully cooked through and it made everything much easier to mix, rather than if I cubed the chicken. 

I didn't use onions, but more than likely will next time. Hence, the major usage of garlic seasoning. 

I ALSO plan to use chicken broth with water to dilute it next time to boil it to give it more flavor.

Made like recipe except I used fresh broccoli and chicken and boiled chicken for 15" before putting in the casserole.
I cooked 50".
So good. Yummy. Keep checking for doneness. (Clears throat).

Didn't use the onion because I don't like onions very much, a bit too much cheese for this recipe. I could have used a bit less but not by too much. You won't need ANY salt. Especially with the Velveeta cheese. And I normally use salt in all my cooking. And cook and use real chicken instead of canned chicken because the canned chicken has a sort of tuna fish feel/taste. I also made 2 cups of regular long grain rice, not the instant kind. Tastes great though.

Amazing recipe! Went through the reviews before making and decided to make a few changes: 1.) seasoned & baked my own chicken breasts then broke them up instead of using chunk chicken 2.) used shredded cheese (3 cheese blend) instead of processed cheese 3.) topped with slices of provolone before putting in the oven 4.) 3 minutes before taking out of the oven I added more shredded cheese to the top and put the oven on broil

i followed suggestions in other reviews, like using chicken broth to cook the rice, used onion soup mix and adding curry powder and paprika.
 I used  cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I also used half a teaspoon of crushed garlic. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I didn't use instant rice, so that part of recipe took awhile. I used one cup of cheddar cheese; we don't have velveeta here in New Zealand. I still thought that was too much cheese. I will make this again, after I finish the leftovers, but will add more broccoli.

I have made this multiple times, I do not like the chunk canned chicken, we throw a couple extra chicken breast on the grill whenever we are cooking out or in a pinch get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I also prefer baby broccoli to full size and instead of regular Velveeta I use the Mexican style.  This has quickly become a family favorite.

Bland bland bland.  No flavor.  Needs major seasoning.  Hubby even wasn't thrilled & he loves just about everything I make.  He suggested swapping the rice for lasagna noodles, the chicken for meat, the sauce/soup for tomato sauce, and the fake cheese for ricotta & mozzarella!  But then it would be lasagna.

Quick and easy.  I didn't use canned chicken browned chicken breast with some salt and pepper.  I added Italian seasoning to the soup mixture and used fresh broccoli.  Chicken was very tender. My family enjoyed it.

Great recipe. I made a couple changes but they were minimal. I used carnation milk instead of whole milk, I baked 3 chicken breasts seasoned lightly and shredded instead of can chicken and used cream of mushroom instead of onions. I also cooked my rice in butter. Slight adjustments but it was awesome!

Thanks for a great, easy recipe. This is perfect for a working mom. My four-year-old ate most of it without complaining, and my 18-month-old devoured it, eating every bite on his plate and wanting more! I only adapted based on what I had on hand, using white and brown rice (not instant), fresh broccoli instead of frozen and using all cream of chicken soup, no cream of mushroom. Oh, and I left out the onions so my kids and husband wouldn't complain about it! This would be a great use of leftover chicken, but for anyone who is afraid of canned chicken, Swanson's chunk white chicken in a can is actually quite good in a casserole like this. It tastes fine — my mom used to keep it on hand for "emergencies" and use it in sandwiches sometimes, and you might be surprised how good it tastes. Obviously, this is not gourmet, made with Velveeta and cream of chicken soup, and canned chicken; and I'm sure it would be better with everything fresh, and a mix of cheddar and other cheeses  — but for a quick, satisfying dish, it was just what I needed. Served with a side salad, since I was a little short on broccoli, and to add some green to the plate.

For the most part I made this as written with 2 minor changes - I used brown rice instead of white (dietary concern), and used rotisserie chicken breasts instead of canned chicken.  It was easy to put together and turned out wonderfully!  No doubt this will be on the menu at our home whenever there's a rotisserie chicken lying around  ;)   Great recipe!  Thank you :)

This was delicious and I will certainly make again.  Instead of using instant rice I used black rice, an ancient grain. I cooked and chopped some chicken tenderloins instead of canned chicken. I used about 12 Oz of reduced fat Mexican cheese blend. I buy a container of onions pre-chopped at the grocery so about 5 oz ( hall the container).

Very tasty! Definitely use three cups of rice instead of two though. Two is super soupy and runny, but three is perfect. I too used onion soup mix over the raw onions, and I think it's better that way. Kept everything else the same though, and it turned out perfectly. Will bookmark for the future!

This recipe grabbed me because I love all the items listed in the title. However, I am not a fan of canned chicken and processed cheese food. I swapped out the white instant rice for a wild rice blend and cooked that ahead of time. I also bought  about a pound and a quarter of pre-cut chicken tenders and boiled them for about 30 minutes. Then I sweated the onion and added the cans of soup, milk and 3/4 lb of  shredded cheddar cheese to the mix. Once the cheese was melted and the ingredients combined I mixed everything together in a large bowl then transferred to my baking dish. I sprinkled on the remaining cheese before putting in the oven. It's delicious but could use some garlic. I'll try that the next time I make it.

This was so delicious.  However, I did make changes based on others comments.   I used brown rice instead of instant and cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese food.  Everyone loved it.

Here's how I varied the recipe to make it a bit healthier: 
 1.) used about 6 cups cooked brown basmati rice, 
2.) added 28 oz of broccoli florets, 
3.)1 cup  of 2% reduced fat cheddar cheese, 
4.) a low sodium, low fat version of the  soups,  
5.) & then  5 large raw chicken breasts instead of  the canned chicken - (which I  put in the casserole dish after adding the rest of the mixture to the dish).  
  I baked it at 425 degrees  and it  took about  90 min or so to bake due to the extra broccoli & raw chicken, but it was incredibly moist and was much healthier.  

Will certainly make this again.

Instead of processed cheese I used shredded and half the amount per reviews. I'm glad I used half the cheese. Everything else was identical. We didn't care for it.

Made this according to the recipe. Too salty, the texture of the chicken was like rubber. I was suspicious when I saw the canned ingredients and the processed cheese. This was just combining canned ingredients and then heating it up. Threw it away, not worth saving for a lunch. Every recipe that I have tried that has canned soup as an ingredient has been terrible. Either too salty or the taste and texture was bad. I will stick to real recipes from now on. As for the people that doctored the recipe, a good recipe does not need help, just a minor adjustment of seasonings and spices to suit the cooks taste.

This is very good but don't go by the cook time. I would triple the cook time. It takes a long time for cheese to melt. I even cooked it with foil on the top, Next time I would try cooking it in a crock pot for about 4 hr on low.

I baked 2 chicken breasts for 25 minutes, made my jasmine rice and used one can of cream of mushroom, one cup of sour cream, one cup of whole milk. Really good. I used 5 scallions plus a handful of chopped chives along with 8 ounces of shredded cheddar cheese. I added black pepper and then baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Delicious!

Nice and easy casserole. Added some garlic and black pepper salt for a little seasoning.  Used fresh broccoli steamed for 3 minutes for a stronger broccoli presence. Very filling and reheats well for leftover!

Just wanted to say thank you to Dagny21....omgosh I followed your instructions and it was DELICIOUS!  If you are making this, you owe it to yourself to follow her recommendations. You won't be disappointed:) 
Also, I had to use a 4 qt pyrex....the 2 qt (13x9) was WAY too small for all those ingredients! My only other advice is to mix in a bowl instead of in the pan/pyrex itself because you'll just end up losing half on the counter (if you're messy like me)

4.5 stars.  I used rotisserie chicken and fresh broccoli along with shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. I put chicken flavor granules on the water I boiled for the rice. Added salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

I made a few changes. I boiled 4 pieces of chicken and the frozen broccoli, but separate (Not in the same water). I used 2 cans of cream of chicken & mushroom soup and I fried up a small onion with garlic. I shredded the chicken, added the butter, soup, milk, broccoli, onions, garlic and shredded Cheddar & Monterey jack cheese instead of the Velveeta. I also threw a small can of mushrooms in there. I did a very thin layer of herb and garlic bread crumbs on top with more cheese. It was perfect. I have made it with Velveeta cheese and the family liked it better with the Cheddar and Monterey cheese.

Cooked 2 boxes of pilaf with chicken broth in rice cooker(used Far East Almond and Roasted Chicken and Garlic). Cut up fresh thighs (8) and breasts (2)and broasted  in oven with olive oil, lemon pepper and garlic slices till medium rare. Chopped 12 oz fresh broccoli and partially cooked with 1/4 cup chicken broth in micro. Mixed 3/4 lb of shredded mozzarella and sharp cheddar with lg can of cream of chicken with 3/4 cup milk, broccoli, chicken with juices, I can diced water chestnuts, small chopped  onion and 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix. Placed in baking dish and covered lightly with slivered roasted almonds and lightly with panko crumbs. Sprinkled lightly with garlic powder and blk pepper? Baked 350 for 40 minutes. This made double portion as I was making for friend, as well as us.  Should freeze well for quick  future dinner. No salt needed with pilaf spices and onion soup mix.    Will add more veggies and less cheese and meat and try broccoli  and mushroom soup, next time to make it less chicken flavor and healthier.

The foundation of this recipe is awesome! 

Modifications:
1. Used Chicken Breast and cut it in chunks. I seasoned and sauteed the chicken breast,
2.  Used long-grained rice
3.I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made a sauce out of the cheese, milk, and the soups. 
4. I mixed the sauce, rice and chicken together and baked it.

YUMMY! Making it again.

I read the reviews and I agree that this was a little bit watery (and it wasn't too bad it's just something that bothered me) and it didn't thicken up after it cooled. 
Changes: I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, which I boiled in 2 cups of water with salt, pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasonings, and then I proceeded to shred them (next time I will try chopped or a few more chicken breasts). I used 2 cups long grain rice. Added 3 garlic cloves; minced. half a large onion (next time I will mince, chopped made it seem like too much onion), I used the water from the chicken with all the seasonings. I used 8 oz of cheese, I think I should have used all 16. It wasn't cheesy enough for me.

Following the recipe, the cook time was not sufficient to cook the chicken thoroughly. I added 2 & 1/2 cups of chicken broth, as the mixture was very dry, and baked another 45 minutes.  Turned out great! I will try again with these changes at the beginning and see what results i get.

Very excellent recipe. I made few changes to make it more healthy.  I used organic broccoli clamp shells, and steamed it before putting all the items together. Organic milk. And used hormone free fresh chicken breasts (2), grilled it and then chopped it with knife to smaller pieces. This became one of our favorite quick meals for dinner. Thank you for the great recipe.

I cooked a wild rice blend in chicken broth.  While the rice cooked, I put cubed chicken and the broccoli which i had shaken in a bag with olive oil and fresh garlic with a shake of crushed red pepper.  I put that in a roasting pan in a 400 degree oven.  Meanwhile I chopped the onion and some mushrooms.  After about a half hour and one stir of the chicken and broccoli, I turned the oven down to 350.  Then I put the milk, about a cup of cheddar cheese and one can of mushroom soup on low heat after I whipped it together along with some pepper.  I added this to the roasting pan along with the rice and chopped vegs.  Mixed well with chicken and broccoli and put back in the oven for another 30 mins.  I realized I had forgotten the butter but didn't think it needed much more so I just put some pats of butter spaced out on the top before the final 30 mins.  Really good.  Thanks for the base recipe.

This was a great recipe, but it needed some help.  I added a roll of crushed Ritz crackers mixed with melted butter on top for a nice added texture (slightly mushy when it becomes leftovers, but still worth it in my book).  Also, thawing the broccoli before chopping it makes it easier.  Last, just a bit of salt added to the mixture helps immensely.

Tried this for the first time. Only added an additional 1/2 cup of instant rice since some were saying it was soupy. Cut the processed cheese by a 1/4 lb. it came out perfect! My husband and I both liked it. Sautéed the onion first but could not taste them. May try Lipton onion dry soup next time to kick it up a notch but it was good on its own merit. It is a keeper in our household.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight, it makes a ton! The only change I made was that I used half chedder and half Velveeta crumbles and didn't use the full amount of cheese. I also switched out the cream of chicken soup and used cheddar soup (cambells). It's a bit soupy but delicious. I think I would use less milk next time to try and make it less soupy.

I loved this.  I was leery because I'd never had canned chicken, but I decided to stick with it for the convenience.  This was an amazing dish.  It was perfectly moist, delicious, and definitely a keeper.  The only change I made was that half of the cheese was a shredded cheddar blend because I ran out of the other.  The one change I will make next time is cooking the onion a bit ahead of time or just using dehydrated or powder. I felt that the onions were still a little too raw for my taste (no one else seemed to mind though).

OK, second time making this: I skipped the onions, and I used the full amount of processed cheese.  I will go back to half processed cheese and half regular cheese for future makings.

Used wild rice, not instant, non canned chicken and fresh broccoli. Listened to reviews and put in less then recommended cheese and used cheddar. Added spices curry, chicken broth powder and some Greek spices. Came out really good.

Way overwhelming amount of cheese practically drowNing. I will probably use half that amount next time :) next time I make this I'll probably add more chicken and fresh broccoli otherwise this recipe is a new favorite!

I made it with oven baked chicken instead of canned. (3 breasts). Onion powder instead of onions (1.5 tsp). And shredded cheese over velveeta. Only used 1/2 cup milk. Turned out really good! Will probably make again. Made 3 small bread pans worth, ate one with the kiddies and froze the other 2 for later.

Pretty good.  I think I'll add some mushrooms next time to change the flavor a bit.  I have my mom's chicken and broccoli casserole recipe and this was very close to those flavors just with rice added.

I think this recipe is well written if you are short on time, otherwise I recommend using fresh broccoli,rotisserie chicken,and regular rice. I also subbed the processed cheese for a variety of shredded cheeses and added crushed cornflakes with melted butter as a topping. I gave it 5 stars because even though I changed it up, it's still the same idea. Thank you for submitting!

It's a good bas. I halved this because I wasn't serving many people. I cooked the onions and broccoli with the chicken before mixed together for baking. I used around 6oz of cheddar colby jack mix. It's a bit of a personal preference but I used a little sour cream as well. I will definitely try this again sometime.

This was pretty good but the raw onion was too strong. If I make this again I'll sauté the onion first. (I also used chicken breast instead of the can chicken per the suggestion of other reviewers)

This is great and simple. I make rice in my rice cooker rather than in a pot. We use shredded cheddar cheese rather than processed cheese food because we do not care for it, and we add stuff like corn and black beans and a touch of siracha to mix it up a little.

This recipe was great but what I did different was only adding cream of mushroom and not the cream of chicken since I read the reviews. I didn't want it to be too soupy . Next time I will not use minute rice. I will be using regular rice. Overall this dish was good.

I made it exactly as recipe stated.  I found I had to double the cooking time to make it look right.  It was way too rich for my taste.  If I make it again I will probably use 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 shredded cheese and skip the canned chicken in favor of chunks of real chicken breast.  I would also add more chicken since it seemed like each person got one bite of chicken per bowl.  My bf liked the onion flavor although I thought it was slightly overpowering.  I would probably saute the onions first next time.  It makes a ton so there is a lot left over.  I took it for lunch today but am still finding that it is too strong to eat much of it.

The posted version is quick but seems bland. I get some ingredients started in a skillet and use the following modifications:

1.  Cook rice in chicken broth or boullion
2.  Finely chop an onion, cook in skillet until translucent
3.  Put the cubed chicken with the onion and season to taste (parika, red pepper, cayenne)
4.  Toss the broccoli into the skillet with cooked chicken and cover a few minutes until tender.
5.  Use 1/2 lb processed cheese and at least 1/2 lb of real sharp cheddar

This is an AWESOME recipe ~ Loved it so much!  It was so easy to make and tasted so good! I made a few changes to the recipe, I used two baked chicken breast instead of canned chicken, fresh broccoli instead of frozen ones, and regular rice cooker rice instead of instant rice. It was really easy to make and it is a must-make again casserole! :)

I loved it! Even though I did make a couple of quick changes based on the stuff that was available to me.( I used 4 cans of the soup instead of six and also used regular rice.)  I made 24 servings (2) -9-13 pans 
for 19 people and it was totally  devoured. YEA! I also put some crushed nacho corn chips on the  top. It was awesome! 
               I Highly Recommend it.

Nice dish, the kids liked it. Anytime a recipe calls for "canned" chicken, I always use a rotisserie chicken, it just tastes 100 times better. I also only used cream of chicken soup. You also have to season this all. I used salt, pepper and garlic powder. I topped it with crushed up ritz crackers as well.

My very picky family loved this recipe. I was leery of the canned chicken, so browned some chicken breasts and shredded them instead. This was a bit more of a pain and took longer than I would have liked. Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars!

I would recommend sauteing the onions first and adding another half cup of rice. It was good, but the onions were strong and it was a little 'soupy' so we ate it over biscuits (which was good).

I also didn't use the processed cheese and used shredded mozzarella instead. Instead of cream of mushroom I used cream of broccoli and 2 chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken. Turned out really good . Thank you for sharing the recipe:)

I tried this and made a few changes. Used chicken breast that I grilled and seasoned instead of canned chicken, added one extra cup rice, and replaced most of the processed cheese with sharp white cheddar and Jarlsberg. Added in a liquid chicken broth packet (reduced sodium bullion alternative) Reserved about a handful of shredded cheese for the last ten minutes. Also wanted to point out it is a heaping eight servings, and will feed two people for days!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I did change it up a little.

I use boiled chicken breast instead of canned chicken. 2 large ones or 3 small ones. I add a bit of powdered chicken base to the water to add some flavor. The water then turns into chicken broth which I use to cook the instant rice. I also throw in the onion to cook with the rice to soften it up. Instead of processed cheese, I use shredded cheese. 

This recipe is always a hit for me! I even leave out the chicken and use it as a side dish at Thanksgiving and Christmas potlucks.

Used leftover turkey and it was delicious!   Added a couple dashes of soy sauce.  Swapped some of the processed cheese for shredded cheddar.

Loved this! Here's what I did: used uncooked instant brown rice put uncooked rice in buttered 8x8, placed 1/2 bag frozen broccoli florets on then a few handfuls of shredded leftover turkey from thanksgiving. Mixed 2 cups homemade turkey stock, 1 cup milk, some chopped garlic, and my own homemade version of cream of soup poured that mixture over everything. Sealed the pan with foil and baked at 350 for about an hour, uncovered for the last 10-15min. Will definitely make this again, perfect for leftover chicken or turkey...yum!

I loved this recipe.  I can't give it 5 stars because I changed it just a little bit.  I used shredded cheddar and co-jack instead of processed cheese food, added a little extra rice and cooked the rice in chicken broth  as others had suggested.  It was just as good or better as left-overs the next day.  Tomorrow night I am going to make again - this time adding mushrooms and water chestnuts.

I made this recipe but changed quit a few things first off I prefer to use fresh and all natural ingredients, so a healthier or freshier version would consist of low sodium chicken broth, mixed with half and half, chicken bullion which can be found at Super 1* in a small glass jar I also added garlic and pepper to this cream mixture. Also instead of  frozen brocolli I used fresh, and two boneless chicken breasts cubed and cooked then I add the cream mixture to the chicken. Instead of processed cheese I used organic cheddar cheese and crushed garlic and cheese crutons to top the dish, I use tomatoes in my rice, not instant.

Delicious but something is wrong.... there is way too much fluid in this recipe! I added an extra two cups of rice to this recipe and it still came out very soupy! Ps- I used Uncle Ben's ready rice, I didnt put it in the microwave just added it straight to the mix I used one package of "original" and one package of "chicken" rice. It's great!

Really great. I did make some changes though. I sauteed 1 clove fresh garlic, a small onion, and 1lb cubed chicken. Then I added all the ingredients to the pot before pouring it into the baking dish. I also used shredded cheddar instead of the velveeta and I put bread crumbs on the top. VERY tasty.

I halved the recipe, and I used a small bag of 3 cheddar mix instead of processed cheese and I cooked my rice in 3 tablespoons of  french onion soup mix. Great fix since I didn't have onion! Added great flavor.

This dish is absolutely delicious!!!  Easy to put together, smells so yummy while it is cooking and the taste is so worth waiting for. The family loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. You have got to try this. You will shine for sure, as a chef. They'll love you for it. Good Luck. Enjoy !!!!

It was delicious!  I cut the cheese amount in half, used campbells french onion soup instead of the cream of chicken, cut the milk in half and used fresh cooked chicken.

Very good, my husband raved about it, and said it was one of the best things I ever made him. I followed the recipe except added a bit less cheese (used shredded cheddar/jack), fresh broccoli, and added 1 cup more rice. Next time I will also use fresh chicken instead of canned, and my husband requested something crunchy to go on top. Very good!

My family has been making this for years. Try it with leftover turkey!  Add extra milk and you wont even have to cook the rice ahead of time.

I really loved this meal. I did not have the processed cheese and did have to substitute 8 ounces of shredded cheese. From reading this reviews, I think that this eliminated any "soupy" texture from the meal and still made it a great meal.

Thanks Heather for posting this recipe - it is exactly what I've been looking for. I just put it together & placed in the oven, but I know it's gonna be great from the taste & smell. I really like how you can take a basic recipe like this one & make small changes so easily as long as you keep the main ingredients the same amount. Since I didn't have can chicken I used a couple of chicken breast. Also, I didn't have a can of cream of mushroom but did have a can of broccoli cheese soup. Other than that adding a little spice, all the rest I had on hand. I think my family is going to love this!

Pretty good! We put asparagus in for broccoli. I believe this recipe can handle lot of tweaks. That was all I did differently.

I'm lactose intolerant so no velveeta for us.  Made this with 16oz. shredded cheese, fresh blanched broccoli, breast and thighs of a rotisserie chicken, and heat-n-serve white rice (I was in a time crunch). It tasted pretty good.  Had to a little salt and pepper for flavor and a little extra milk (1/4 cup).  Topped with a little extra shredded cheese and did not stir while cooking.  With a side salad made a nice dinner and leftovers.  We are happy with it.

Great flavors.  But, the cooking time is not even near right. I did not make any changes to ingredients and it came out fine, after cooking almost a 1/2 hour longer than originally stated. Next time I will probably cook the onions a little first, since they came out too crunchy for me. Otherwise...a keeper.

Made this and the processed cheese was not a hit with the family.  Did a 1/4 of the processed cheese the second time and used cheddar and it was great.  I also didn't use quick cooking rice but used long grain rice cooked in the rice cooker and it was super easy to throw this together!

It was good, but I changed a few things. I used 4 cooked and shredded chicken breasts instead of canned, 3 cups cooked rice, real cheese instead of processed cheese and 25 ounces of broccoli. It was yummy but I will be increasing the cheese next time

This is my 2nd time making this. The 1st time I did what the instructions said minus the onions. Today, I left out the chicken and of course the onions. I used velveta cheese. After I cooked it I decided to put popcorn chicken in it. It was actually tasty because the popcorn chicken was already seasoned.

LOVE this recipe! Didn't change a thing (except for a hefty sprinkling of pepper on top!). I make it often and my daughter LOVES it, as well! My Mom made a casserole like this when I was younger and I have been looking for something similar for YEARS (she lost the recipe). THANK YOU for sharing!

This is such a good recipe. I made it for some friends and definitely make it for my family in the future. I change a couple of things--I only used cream of chicken soup and instead of the processed cheese food I used real cheddar cheese. It was delish!

Great base for a wonderful recipe. I am on holiday with my boyfriend in Michigan and used this recipe to feed some real hungry men! Without some basic and much needed seasonings, the original recipe would have been very bland by itself.

I'm rating this based on the way mine turned out. I made a few changes by taking suggestions from other comments on here. Instead of canned chicken I used cooked chicken breast, I boiled them and then chunked and shredded them up in the casserole dish. I did use the instant white rice and the creamed soups (chicken and mushroom) but instead of the onion I used the onion soup mix idea. Instead of the processed cheese I used shredded sharp cheddar and shredded pepper jack (to spice it up a little). I put about 2/3 of each bag of cheese in with all the other ingredients and then I saved the other 1/3 of each bag to put on the top while baking (I did that about half way through). I added the milk and the butter like the recipe called for and I think it turned out great! My husband thought it was a little too much spice from the pepper jack so next time I might reduce the amount I use of it and replace it with more cheddar or another type of cheese but all in all it turned out pretty well and I would make it again!

This was a decent dish, but needed some kick.  Next time I will try the other variations out there.

Great recipie I used chicken breast and seasoned it, also I added 1 sleeve of ritz crackers (crumbled) mixed with 1 stick of melted butter and the last 5 mins of cooking a spreaded it over top. It's a keeper!

I like this recipe because the ingredients are usually on hand and it is an easy, quick dinner to make in a pinch.  Like other reviewers, I prefer to use a shredded rotisserie chicken and dry onion soup mix in place of the canned chicken and onion (although I have used canned chicken when necessary and it's fine). I use whatever creamed soups I have and I also add a generous amount of curry.  I find that this adds flavor to an otherwise bland dish, but still maintains the "comfort food" factor.

I used 3 chicken breasts - boiled and cut up into pieces and added on top of rice. Also cooked broccoli in pan with butter and garlic then added on top of chicken.

This was very good. The only thing I did different was to add some Ritz Crackers on top and skipped the Cream of Mushroom. And as with other reviews I added the onion soup mix. Didnt need any other seasonings.

This was good and easy. I picked it becuase I was easy. I made my 4 year old make it (with major superviosion of course) becuase she has been throwing food at dinner. It helped her realize food does not magically appear ont he table. I added some pepper hack for a bit more flavor though.

My entire family loved this! I made some suggested alterations. I pre-cooked a whole chicken and shredded the meat. I made my rice with chicken stock, I added 1/2 a package of savory herb with garlic soup mix instead of onion, and I ditched the processed cheese for a less amount of Colby/Jack. I also used I can chicken soup and 1 can mushroom.  Although I did use the entire amount of butter called for, next time I will reduce it. The chicken stock rice adds enough flavor and it isn't worth the extra fat for us. Add a tossed green salad and it was perfect!

My family loves this stuff but I change it up just a bit. I use leftover chicken from rotisserie chickens because it adds good flavor. Instead of using onion soup mix, I use dried onions and cook them with the rice. Then I sprinkle the top with french fried onions. My family loves it this way. I also add a bit of garlic powder and pepper. No salt is usually necessary.

This was ok, but was rather bland and unmemorable.  The onion was the only real flavor in the dish.  I might try to make this again in my own way without the soups.

We loved this recipe. We made it just as directed, but used 12 oz of shredded mild cheddar. We stirred half way through cooking and topped with last 4 oz for remaining 20 minutes. It does make alot for a family of 3 but the leftovers are great! I'll be making some to freeze and save for a rainy day!

tweaked the recipe using dagny21's suggestions for onion soup mix, but just used sharp cheddar to mix in, and put bread crumbs on top.  Turned out delicious, and everyone loved it. I will make this again.  I have a vegetarian daughter so I made a second smaller casserole and omitted the chicken.  I may try adding some water chestnuts next time for added crunch.  Very good!

I took the advice of the first reviewer, except that I used one 8 oz. package of cheese, two cans of cream of chicken soup, and a package of onion soup mix. In the future, I would use less onion soup mix or just onion powder. The soup could almost be cut back as well. I used the canned chicken, and while the canned taste was masked, I'm sure regular chicken or rotisserie chicken would be better. I topped the casserole with crumbled ritz crackers with some of the butter on them. Not bad for a spring picnic/potluck.

This was really good. I used left over chicken breasts from dinner the night before instead of canned. Even two of my picky eaters finished their whole plate. My husband liked it too!

My husband loved this recipe. I took the advice of a couple reviews. I used shredded colby jack and white sharp cheddar. I also cut up chicken and cooked it in pan, before mixing it together with the cheese, brocoli, soups onion, butter and milk. I also added some paprika and garlic salt for taste. Yum!

I made the following modifications: 1) I made the rice in a rice cooker since I don't have instant rice 2) I took one lb of chicken breast and diced it instead of using chicken from a can.  I sauteed garlic, 1 small onion, and one rib of sliced celery in olive oil and then added the chicken.  I sauteed the chicken and cooked it completely.  I seasoned it with some black pepper, paprika, and a small amount of cayane pepper.  3) I shredded about 1.5 cup of cheddar cheese 4) I layered the soup, broccoli, chicken, and chicken in the baking dish. 5) I served the dish by pouring the chicken mixture on top of the rice. 6) I mixed the soup with 1 T of mayonaise.  I skipped the butter, and milk.

Thanks for a recipe that was easy to cut in half! (It was for just my boyfriend and myself.) It was a good basic recipe, but judging by the ingredients and the reviews, it sounded like it would be a little bland for our tastes. I added 1/2 tsp of chicken bouillon granules (remember, for half the recipe), some minced garlic, paprika, and a LITTLE cayenne pepper. I also used onion powder instead of onions - bf isn't a fan. I used shredded cheese and mixed half in the rice and put half on top as well as some parmesan, put the chicken (used breast strips) on top, and covered it with bread crumbs. BF said it was "awesome" and "warm and comforting." I had to agree!

I wasn't so sure about this recipe at first, but after making the adjustments that others suggested it turned out great!  I added Onion soup mix instead of the onion, brown rice to make it a little more healthier, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and left out the butter.  It was really good!  Will make again!

This was a tasty recipe, however, I did make a few changes, and would still make another change next time I make it.  I used regular, long grain white rice instead of instant (I just like it better).  Also, I combined about 1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs with about 1 tbsp. melted butter, and sprinkled the mixture on top of the casserrole (for an au gratin type of topping.)  The next time I make this, I will not use an entire pound of processed cheese - it is way too much.  I'd probably cut it in half.  Otherwise, this was a good, easy recipe.

Everyone who has tried this has asked for the recipe.  It is easy and never lasts more than one day.  I have begun to add mushrooms, a family favorite, and I top the casserole with crushed doritos for extra texture.  The best part is my son who hates vegetables does not even notice the broccoli!!

NOTE: The main issue with this dish is the rice. Depending on what kind of rice you use you could end up with too much rice, or a little extra liquid. If the kind of rice you use doesn't "expand" as much as what the directions call for, you may need to make more. The first time I made it I think I had too much rice- it was hard to find the chicken! But I discovered the hard way it's better to add more chicken and broccoli than to mess with the liquid ratio. I also always use the 16 oz of half jack/cheddar instead of processed cheese (sounded too fake tasting). Small changes, but the flavor was spot on delicious, every time. A keeper!

This recipe was easy to make and delicious, although I did make a few changes.  Added more seasoning, less cheese and didn't use instant rice.  It makes ALOT of food...we had to throw some of it out, we couldn't eat it all, so next time I think I am going to half the recipe.  Will definitely use this again.

This recipe turned out great!  I added carrots to the top of mine to add a little color.  I also used long grain rice (cooked that first) and baked my own chicken (broke it up).  It make more than enough.  Great for ones on a budget.

I halfed it, used 2 lrg chicken breast sauted with coconut oil and some various seasonings. used cream of mush, omitted velveeta (yuck) and added about 1/8 cup goat cheese for a more grown up taste. seasoned the mixture as well with various spices. cooked my rice 3/4 way done in chicken broth as well.  Good base recipe though. My 2 yr old devoured it too!

This was a good recipe.  I made some changes like using chicken breasts cut up instead of canned and I sauted the onion first.  I think it would've been nice to have some sort of crunchy top to this recipe too.  I think next time I will add some cracker crumbs.  But really, thanks to the poster- this is a keeper.

Here's what I did: I chopped the broccoli/onion up very fine, sauteed the onion in a skillet until translucent and then added the finely chopped broccoli. After 5 mins I added the butter. I used GROUND MEAT seasoned soulfully.  I used 2 bags of Success Boil-in-a-Bag Rice. After everything was ready I used a 9x13 dish and poured  meat/broccoli/onion/mushroom & chicken soup along with two (2) jars of Cheese Whiz together, stirred it placed in the oven for 10-15 minutes. It is GREAT!!!!!! By the way, I never used milk at all.

This has been thrown into the rotation and made almost weekly. I do some variations on it though. I NEVER use canned chicken meat. I do not like the flavor. I use either a whole chicken or chicken pieces, boiled and meat taken from the bone. I also use peas and carrots instead of broccoli sometimes too. This is a great and easy recipe that the whole family loves!

I make something very similar. I agree with the others that fresh chicken and less cheese is the way to go. I also add a bit of Dijon mustard and half the butter.

This is a good recipe. I didnt use canned chicken though, I used boneless chicken breast that I seasoned and sauteed and also I used about 6 oz. shredded fiesta blend style cheese instead. The only problem i had with this recipe was that the broccoli was a little crunchy. I don't like crunchy veg. so the next time I make the dish I'll cook the broccoli down a little before i add it to the mixture.

I made some changes: a little less processed cheese than called for, used brown rice instead of instant, didn't add butter, used onion soup mix instead of chopped onion, and added browned buttered bread crumbs on top for last 5 min. My husband enjoyed it, but I didn't. This is a recipe worth playing with until I get it right. I'll try some other suggestions others have shared. The buttered bread crumbs on top was a good addition though.

This was a huge hit at my house. I love how cheesy it is. I made this ahead and froze it, it was super quick to bake (after thawed). It was good as left overs as well (since it made so much), but they didn't last long. This is my family and I's favorite casserole. Thanks for posting

This is a lot of great food, with a lot of great ease! However, I agree with others that some adaptations need to be made. Next time, I will either saute the onions first, or use onion soup mix, as someone else suggested.  Also, I will use shredded Cheddar, rather than the processed cheese. I think a can of mushrooms would be great in this, too.

I gave this a 4 because it would probably have been great with the modifications mentioned in the reviews.  I did not read them before making it and it was WAY too cheesy!  Cut out a lot of the cheese.  I think it would have tasted great if I had done that.

I too took this recipe and changed it up a bit. I added some carrots, used chicken breast instead of the canned meat. And just used Mexican mix cheese, and only put enough to cover the top of it, along with salt and pepper. Oh, and only half a cup of milk. That seemed to satisfy me and my husband. A very good and simple recipe that can be modified as the person cooking it prefers.

Although I thought the flavor of this dish was excellent, the consistency was too soupy for our taste, even after increasing the rice to 3 cups as suggested by another reviewer.  If I make it again I would omit the milk and cut back on the cheese (i did use 16 oz of shredded cheddar rather than velveeta).  Some toasted bread crumbs or french fried onions on top might also help to give it a little crunch.

This was really delicious, but I made some changes to the original recipe. I used half the Velveeta, 1.5# of chicken tenders (chunked and cooked in the skillet), and 16 ounces of fresh broccoli florets. I also used a cream of chicken & mushroom soup(2 cans). This is a favorite around our house and is nice on busy weeknights when we want a hot meal but I don't have a lot of time. Next time I think I will substitute regular Cheddar cheese and see how that works. Great stuff!

I'm not sure what the fuss about this dish is.  I thought it was great.  The only change i made was that I used a lb. of pepper jack velveeta instead of the regular.  My husband says it is a 4 but what does he know?

Added some celery and onion sauteed in the microwave, used cream of chicken soup only, some fat-free sour cream, a small can of mushrooms, and a poached chicken breast.  Also used grated cheddar in place of the velveeta.

UPDATE: USING MY SISTER'S BROCCOLI, RICI & CHEESE CASSEROLE RECIPE AS A GUIDE, I DECIDED TO GIVE THIS ANOTHER TRY. THIS TIME, I DID A FEW THINGS DIFFERENTLY (BASED ON HER RECIPE). INSTEAD OF DELI OR CANNED CHICKEN, I CUBED THE BREAST MEAT OF A STORE-BOUGHT ROTISSERIE CHICKEN (PERFECT!). I ALSO SAUTEED MY ONION AND A CLOVE OF MINCED GARLIC (MY ADDITION) IN BUTTER UNTIL CRISP-TENDER AND THEN ADDED MY FROZEN BROCCOLI AND DID THE SAME. THIS ELIMINATED THE "RAW" TASTE / TEXTURE I EXPERIENCED BEFORE. MY NEXT CHANGE WAS ADDING AN ADDITIONAL CUP OF RICE. FINALLY, I SUBBED CHEEZ-WHIZ FOR CUBED VELVEETA. THE TWO ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AND SINCE I DIVIDED THIS BETWEEN TWO 9 X 9 IN. CASSEROLE DISHES, I KNEW STIRRING TO MELT THE CHEESE WOULD BE TROUBLESOME. MY SISTER'S RECIPE CALLS FOR LESS MILK, BUT I ADDED AN ENTIRE CUP ANYWAYS (WHICH WAS FINE). NOTE: IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE REGULAR LONG-GRAIN RICE. INSTANT RICE IS PERFECTLY FINE, BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY HANDY, GO AHEAD AND USE WHATEVER YOU HAVE. WITH THESE CHANGES, THIS ROCKS! I did not care for this recipe at all. :( My casserole was soupy and my veggies were undercooked. I don't know what I did wrong.... Other than subbing cubed deli chicken for the canned stuff (seemed and halving this, I made no significant changes. I believe this has potential, but because of my bad experience I'll never find out. Being that I'm on a budget, I'm too afraid to waste good ingredients again. Thanks anyways, Heather. :-)

Creamy, cheesy, and very good! I used a California baby blend of frozen veggies, and shredded cheddar (of which I also topped the casserole with). My only complaint was that it was a little on the bland side, which was easily fixed with a little salt and pepper.

Very good.  My only deviations were that I used a boiled chicken breast because it was on sale and my local grocery store didn't have chopped frozen broccoli so I used frozen florets.  A little oniony for my taste but my boyfriend really liked it.

pretty good! i used fresh steamed broccoli, cubed leftover chicken breasts, and regular cheddar (mainly because that was what I had in my refrigerator!) and it was pretty tasty.  I think I would like to try it with the Velveeta as instructed though, or use sharp cheddar (it needed some more cheese flavor)

One of the best cheese/broccoli casserole recipes I've tried! There's a little more prep work involved than your standard recipe.  I also substituted the canned chicken for fresh cubed chicken breast, just brown it in a skillet until the pieces are cooked through, with a little paprika for color. Instead of boiling water to cook the rice in, I used canned chicken broth, which really put a lot of flavor in the rice.  This is a great dish, my one-year old and I loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Recipe is great, with a few changes made.  I substitute boneless skinless chicken breast, and use shredded cheese.  This has become a staple dish in our house, I've made this several times already.

This was very good and simple.  I had to make several batches and was easy to multiply.  I did add a generous dash of tabasco and used grilled chicken - I also used shredded cheese which mixed in really well.  I cooked the rice in the microwave.  On my second batch I added a little salt (not too much).  I will make this again.

This was okay.  I like that it has everything in it that the kids love to eat.  I think it needs a little more flavor with the recipe as it is.  Next time, I will cook the rice in chicken stock and add more seasoning to the cream soups mixture.

Just like my mom used to make except for the lack of topping. I added bread crumbs and shredded cheese to the top the last 5 minutes or so of cooking for a crunchy texture.

Very good!  I used poached chicken instead of the canned, which I then chopped up, and used two cream of chicken soups instead of the mushroom.  I also used less cheese than called for (I can't remember how much, sorry!) and it still came out very cheesy.  It's not the most attractive dish once cooked, but it was tasty.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is so good and easy. I just use cream of chicken soup for both b/c I am allergic to mushrooms, and it still tastes great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!  I only made a half size though cause it is rather large.  I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup rather than one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom and halved the size of everything else.  Lets just say leftovers were not a problem this time.  Thanks!!!!

Kids loved it, they all cleaned their plates and asked for more. When asked if this recipe was a keeper there was a resounding YES!! The only changes I made was boiling the chicken breasts in broth instead of using canned chicken.

Great recipe!  I made this for a friend recovering from chemotherapy and she greatly appreciated it.  It was very easy for her to eat!  I sauted chicken breasts with a small amount of greek seasonings then chopped up into small pieces. Also sauted chopped celery (one stalk) and one red bell pepper.  Then used 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar in place of the processed cheese.  Very well received and even liked by my husband who rarely eats any "one pot" recipes!  Thank you for sharing!  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is great!! I used 2 pounds of cut up chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken and I used cream of brocolli instead of mushroom. I love cheese, so next time I'll use a little more.  :-)

This was a delicious recipe that my husband and children loved.  I cooked 2lbs of chicken instead of canned, but otherwise followed the recipe exact. It was the main dish, served along with salad and rolls.

This recipe was awesome! I used the cream of broccoli soup instead of the cream of mushroom and the dryed onion soup instead of the chopped onions. I also cooked the rice first and bought 2 8oz packages of the shredded casserole cheese. It turned out perfect and my boyfriend loved it. I will be sure to use it again!

I don't like mushrooms so I used cream of broccoli soup instead... Also I used cut up chicken breast (boiled chicken with bouillon cubes and cut it up) and it was a big hit. I loved it and it was very simple to make! I will make this one again!

I am a fairly new cook, and this recipe was an easy way to make a great meal for my very hungry family.  Instead of using chunked chicken though, I broiled 2 large chicken breasts, and added that instead.  I also completely dismissed the butter.  Thanks Heather!

Not a "wow" dish, but good and a hit among the family.  Easy to make too.  I will probably do less onion next time.

Pretty good recipe.  I left out the broccoli and it was a little soupy.  Next time I will add a little more rice to thicken it up.  I will also use cooked, cubed chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken.  I didn't care for the canned taste.

This was ok. It needed to cook a little longer. I also used fresh cooked chicken. I didn't like the instant rice it got too mushy.

I made this for my fiance. He doesn't care very much for rice, so I substitued rotini pasta instead. It tasted very good with the pasta. I didn't have any processed cheese food, so I used 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese in its place. Overall, a wonderful recipe that we both very much enjoyed. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks, Heather!

Very good.  I had some split chicken breasts already cooked and a can of broccoli cheese soup and was trying to find a good combination.  After cooking the rice, I cut the butter on top of it so that it could melt while I put the other ingredients in the mixing bowl.  I cut this in half and used a can of broccoli cheese soup instead.  I also used evaporated milk.  I cut the velveeta in pieces and mixed it all up.  The cheese melted into yummy pockets throughout the casserole.  This would actually work with tuna too.  It's very cheesy this way.  I did not add onions.  I would agree with the other review, I think that if one were to add onions to this, they would need to be sauteed first.  They wouldn't cook enough while in the oven.

I used cooked chicken instead of canned, but followed the rest exactly. This wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be but was still very good. I will make again but next time I will leave out the butter and use less milk so that the casserole is thicker.

Okay recipe... My hubby didn't really care for it, but he isn't the biggest fan of casseroles. I thought it was kind of lacking in flavor. I'm not sure what to add to make it taste better, and I doubt I will be making this again to find out!

Very tasty.....even my picky 11 month old loved it!  I used fresh chicken that I sauteed with the onion in a little olive oil, regular rice that I cooked in beef broth, omitted the butter, and used probably about 2/3 lb of Velveeta.  Excellent dinner!

Very good, and easy to prepare! Instead of rice, I boiled short tube pasta and added it to the mix. I also used fresh chicken breast like many others, par-cooking it before adding to the casserole. I thought 1 lb of cheese was a lot, so I just used half. I didn't realize that I left out the butter, but it still came out creamy. This is a great pack lunch entree! A great way to get broccoli into my diet.

This recipe was wonderful!!!
I made this for my husbands grandparents and they loved it.  I used 94% fat free soup and I added extra broccoli, chicken.  I also cut the rice in half since my grandpa is diabetic.  I also used real cheese and It was wonderful.  My 4 year old son really loved it too.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

My husband loved! this recipe.  I made a few substitutions however before I made it. I used Jasmine riced already cooked and cooked fresh chicken breast cut into cubes. I also used fresh brocolli and red onions instead. I added 1/2 cup of chopped basil (or cilantro.) and used three kinds of cheese instead. I added crushed french fried onions to the top before baking as well. Delicious!

With changes it is a great dish!  Definately cook the onion before adding to casserole, I used a mixture of mozzarella/cheddar, used a rotisserie chicken, and fresh broccoli.  We tried the original recipe and threw it out, ick.  With changes we had friends asking for the recipe.  NUM!

I just made this casserole for lunch for my one year old daughter and myself.  We both loved it.  I made a few minor changes based on some other reviews:  I cooked my own chicken instead of using canned, I used a four cheese blend that included cheddar which gave it a nice flavor, and I added about a cup of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  I'm always looking for something different to offer my baby to keep her interested in healthy foods, and this one was a hit.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a nice meal for the whole family.  I used fresh chicken breast cut into tiny pieces.  I used garlic salt and pepper and stir fried the chicken in a little bit of butter instead of can chicken.  My very picky husband and two year old loved it and they even ate the left overs.  I also used frozen chopped onion since I do not like the chore of chopping.

This recipe was ok, but wasn't great. I used stewed chicken rather than canned chicken, and I left out the onions. It's fairly gooey. It would probably have been better served with a bread of some sort. A little lacking in flavor. Could be tasty with some experimentation.

This was a very good and easy casserole.  I cut back on the amount of broccoli some since the amount called for in the recipe seems like a lot.  Will make again.

I'm a kid at heart, but my kid still wouldn't try it.  My wife and I loved it.  Very convenient to make and save for leftovers or for a good church dinner.
