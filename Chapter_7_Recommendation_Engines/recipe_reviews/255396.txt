This is delicious. Definitely will be made in my house again and again. 
I did fully cook the squash in the oven then just mixed into the pan with the other ingredients. I did add a dash of red pepper flakes and served with a spicy Italian sausage.

Made this with a few changes and it was delicious!  Have 4 stars because I think without my tweaks for me it wouldn’t been as good but the recipe has all the right ideas. I had a very large squash and microwaved for 8 minutes. It was easy to cut and a little tough to shred but in the end it worked out. I was able to cook it to my preferred taste in the pan. I reordered the way I cooked the other ingredients to get the doneness i desired.  Onions first, then peppers and green beans, then zucchini, diced tomatoes last. I wanted mine more red so I used 3 cans of diced tomatoes. This allowed me to also have more liquid to finish cooking the squash. I added artichoke hearts but I had so much squash they got lost.  In terms of spices this squash takes a lot of seasoning so I was very generous and did a couple of taste tests.  Loving every bite!!!

Squash needed 40 minutes to soften and then an hour all together to cook. I added much more seasoning.

I changed it up a bit but everyone loved it!! I didn’t use the zucchini, used green instead of red bell pepper, used 4 cloves of fresh garlic,  and added mushrooms. My husband added white cheddar to his and really liked it. I love this because it is so versatile! You can make it a little differently every time. Plan on making it agin this week and inviting my mom over.

We made this for our family of eight and it went over well. It wasn't the greatest meal ever but it is a solid dish and will be made again!

I made the recipe.  The squash absolutely needs to be cooked longer the first time than it states.  I ended up cooking it for the 25 minutes, then having to throw it into the microwave for longer.  
However, it is absolutely delicious!  
I also altered it to be a one-pan meal.  Just aded the ingredients to the pan, covered, and finished that way, instead of the oven.  Everyone over it.
Next time I will just cook the squash in the microwave.  Saves energy and is much quicker.

Sorry, but this didn't work for me. Rather tasteless and the green beans were way too crunchy for me. I think it would have worked better with black beans and a bit more spices.

I had a small squash so i cut the recipe back. I also added my own sauce instead of the diced tomatoes. Added fresh minced rosemary and basil.Makes a nice light meal. 
Thank you for the recipe.

Squash definitely needs to cook longer prior to cutting in half and scraping out. I also used ground Axis meat (venison) with a tomato basil pasta sauce. The squash was still a bit crunchy and my kids didn’t care for it but I thought it was pretty good.

Fresh green beans weren't available and I didn't want canned or frozen green beans. I substituted a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) which tasted phenomenal. I'm sure the green beans would taste good too. The seasonings were spot-on. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the more complicated steps of partially cooking the spaghetti squash and then putting the entire finished dish into the oven. The spaghetti squash was more difficult to cut in half, plus I was unable to scrape as much squash out because it was undercooked. I will definitely make this dish again but next time I will cook the squash entirely in the oven, then scrape it into the skillet at the end, toss and serve. Then it will be unnecessary to put it all back in the oven. Thank you for the recipe!
