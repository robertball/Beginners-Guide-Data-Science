amazing dressing. i've been unable to find Ken's "sweet vidalia onion" dressing in the store for over a year and can replicate it EXACTLY with this recipe! I put the onion in a food processor to really pulverize it, and i only used 1/3 cup oil. ALSO - halving the entire recipe is enough (for me) to dress a salad made with an entire head of romaine lettuce. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!

Delicious.  Easy.  Flexible.  What more can you ask of a salad dressing?  I've tried variations, which this recipe handles with ease.  Mix brown and regular sugar for the 2/3 cup.  Add fresh orange juice along with the lemon juice.    I haven't tried the papaya seeds because purchasing a papaya almost doubles the cost.  When I make this recipe, I find myself ignoring all other dressings for weeks at a time.  It's wonderful.

This dressing was a big hit in my household. I definitely will make this again. I've been looking for a good sweet dressing to always have on hand. This is it. Despite giving it a good review I did give it a four instead of a 5 just because it was sooo sweet. I will probably use just a 1/2 C of sugar next time.

I really liked this dressing.  As did my wife and in-laws.  It was very easy to make (I used Vidilia onions) and went very nicely with my Hawaiian themed dinner I made on mothers day.

I made it exactly as listed (I'm not much of an improviser).

It made us want to go back to the Islands!

Sweet and mildly tangy salad dressing.  This has a nice flavor and is quick to put together.  My only issue is that it is pretty thin, and that may be because I didn't add the papaya seeds.  We also enjoyed this as the dressing for coleslaw.  When I make it again, I'm going to add finely diced onions after I remove it from the blender to give it a little texture.  Thanks dawny for sharing your recipe.

If I could drink this dressing out of the container I would...that's how good it is!  I made this tonight to go with a simple green salad and I am officially declaring it my favorite dressing.  It is a little on the sweet side, but I didn't mind it, and you could always decrease the sugar to taste.  I expected the onion flavor to be overpowering, but it wasn't.  It had a mild onion flavor with a hint of sweetness.  None of the ingredients overpowered another one, but instead made the perfect blend of flavors. This is definitely going to be one of my go to dressings.  I see a lot of salads in my future!

Just the sweet onion dressing I was looking for.(no papaya seeds available) It is very versatile and can be used on a variety of salads. Last night I used it on a salad of spinach, orange pieces and toasted walnuts. Perfect!

I was so hopeful that this would be close to the sweet onion dressing that was my family's favorite for several years before it totally disappeared off the shelf.  It is a good starting point but will need some work.  The garlic flavor was very strong (and I put garlic in just about everything), the lemon flavor was too noticable, and the consistency was off (too thin).  I'm not going to give up though - thanks for a starting point.

Uh-mazing. I used cantaloupe seeds that I salvaged from breakfast and toasted at 250 degrees...not sure whether they're the same, though :/

Definitely cut the oil and could have cut the sugar (although my sweet tooth didn't complain!) Otherwise, I honestly didn't want to change the flavor at all, at all, at all!!

Sooooo delicious.  Definitely add in the papaya seeds.  To keep it seasonal for my neck of the woods, I substituted the lemon with lime.  I mixed the dressing with greens, papaya chunks, toasted pine nuts, and celery.  Next time I may cut down on the sugar a bit.  Thanks!

Whenever I make dressings, I make a few different kinds at a time, and this is always one of them.  It's really, really delicious.  I make some changes though:
Twice the garlic, less sugar, wet mustard instead of dry, and sometimes a red onion instead of white.  

This tastes great on other things too. I put it on burritos, use it as a dipping sauce for potato croquettes and french fries, and put it on sandwiches (not too much or it gets messy).  

I find that the longer it stays in the fridge, the more intense the onion flavor gets, which is something I like.  But we eat it so fast that it rarely gets to that point.  This dressing is highly recommended.

I really enjoyed this dressing - is light and sweet with a sweet onion flavor.  Especially nice for lighter mixed greens - like herb mix or californian mix.  I substituted Splenda for Sugar and it was perfectly fine.

Thanks for sharing!

I'll give it 4 stars 'cuz it sounds so good...before I try making it, though...where can I find papaya seeds?  I've never seen them before...not even in the int'l foods section.  I'd hate to omit them as the recipie calls for a good amount of them and one reviewer says not to skip the seeds!  Help!  Would love to give this a try!  Thanks!

This was good.  We used olive oil to make it a bit healthier and did 1/2 cup of sugar as some other reviewers said it was too sweet. We used the papaya seeds, a little more than recommended and added a little papaya too. My 12 year old even enjoyed it.

Reminds me of the Dole Sweet Onion Citrus dressing. Add some tapicoa starch (flour) to get it thicker.  Just a spoonful. Not quite as good as Dole's but still yummy.

My husband loves fresh papaya and I just bought one for a treat. My sister-in-law mentioned seeing a recipe for a dressing that used the papaya seeds. As soon as I read this one, I knew we had to try it, and I am so happy that I did!   Using a Vidalia onion and juice from a fresh lemon, I followed the recipe closely, but I did use a lot less sugar and omitted the mayo. Fabulous! The taste of the onion comes through, but in a nice tangy dressing. Mine came out nice and thick, maybe including some pulp from the lemon helped, plus the papaya seeds.  This recipe makes a lot of dressing, I will probably halve it next time, depending on how well this batch keeps in the fridge. Thanks for this fun recipe!

Love this.  My new go-to dressing.  I did alter it a little, can't remember how, exactly, but I mostly use recipes just as guidelines, anyway.  Mostly by not measuring but by eye-balling.  But also try to use healthier oils, fresh ingredients, healthier sweeteners, and increasing things I really like.  Thank you for this yummy one!

This salad dressing is addictive.  After I make it I am guaranteed to eat a salad once a day until it all disappears.  I didn't have a sweet onion on hand, so I used a regular yellow onion and the onion flavor was quite strong.  If you like onion flavor it is delicious.  I will remake with a sweet or mild onion too and I might have to give it a 6 star rating!
