If you enjoy food with a bite, be generous with the red pepper flakes.  Also, you can use plain diced tomatoes and season with your own basil and oregano.

A quick, easy, and tasty dish; as good as my North End grandmother's recipe, but much simpler!

Just tried this recipe for the first time, it's amazing! I used a Pino Grigio, added a few capers, and fewer red pepper flakes. Came out incredible

I thought the wine was a little overpowering. If I make it again, I would probably try 1/2 cup of wine instead of 1 cup. Besides that, I liked it. It was the perfect level of spice and I added a splash of lemon juice to give it an added kick.

This recipe was so good. I also thought the wine was a little too much, next time I may just do half a cup.

This was a fairly simple recipe to follow.  It is hot but that's how we like it.  I only had cooking white wine and I found it a bit strong, so maybe a 1/2 cup would have been better.  Besides that, everything cane out very well.

Made it with spaghetti squash and topped it with fresh grated Parmesan.  Excellent.
