The meat turned out very tender and moist. I made some changes: #1. Didn't boil the ribs first. #2.Cooked for 9 hours #3. Didn't use the sauce that was created because it was too onion-y. Next time I'll only use 1/2 an onion.

After the ribs were done I transferred them to a cookie sheet and brushed them with BBQ sauce. I then baked them in a 400 degree oven for between 5 and 10 minutes while I set the table. We were able to pull the bones out (and they were clean), and then ate the meat with a fork. The meat was so tender we didn't need to use dental floss afterwards. It made a really good meal with coleslaw and corn bread.

Five stars, although I did change it somewhat.  I used 1.5 times the brown sugar and used 1 cup of ketchup in place of the tomato soup, as I didn't have any on hand.  I then also ended up doubling the whole thing for 4 lbs of ribs.  We put it in the oven uncovered at 375 for 30 minutes before serving.  It was AMAZING!  I will use this again and again.

Very Good, Very Easy. I WILL make this recipe again. After boiling the PORK ribs I put them in the crock pot, but my crock didn't work so hot today for some reason. (Time to get a new one), So instead I had to put the ribs in a "Reynolds Oven Bag" (plastic) and they turned out perfectly yummy! I followed the cooking times that come with the bag which was 325 for 1 1/2 hours, meat is done when fork tender. Thanks for posting your recipe

We loved the ribs--except I would definitely take other people's advice by not using a whole onion--and maybe about half as much garlic. It was way too oniony! I used BBQ sauce instead of soy, and steak marinade instead of worcester because I didn't have any on hand. I cooked for 8 hours and took the advice of someone else by brushing on more BBQ sauce and cooking them for an extra 10 mins in a 400 degree oven. Perfection! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think I would like this recipe because of the tomato soup. I doubled the sauce ingredients and cooked it for 5 hours. I was in for a surprise. My husband and I loved this recipe. It's not too sweet - just right. And the meat just fell off the bone. I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks Clayton

Loved this recipe and I will use it every time ribs go on sale at the grocery store!  I always felt overwhelmed by ribs because I don't have a grill and they can go wrong so easily.  I was delighted to come home from work to a pot of PERFECTLY cooked ribs!

These are alright. I made them in my quest for a good rib recipe that can be made in the crock pot. Maybe that is my mistake because I feel that they were too tender. They were falling off the bone and then I had a crock pot full of bones and watery greasy sauce. Did not "look" appetizing in the pot.

Great flavor. My husband doesn't like soy sauce, so I substituted 1 tbsp mustard & 1 tbsp honey for the soy sauce. Turned out delicious!! Will definitely be making this one again.

I'll give this five stars but only because it's a easy recipe. I love garlic, but this is a bit much.  Also, when you use canned tomato soup, you get exactly that taste ... canned soup!!  Instead, just use your favorite BBQ sauce and forget all the other ingredients.  It's a no-brainer.  As for boiling the ribs before adding them to the slow cooker, it does help render some of the fat so you don't have greasy ribs.

This version is very bland & way too much onion. Also, you don't need to boil the ribs first. All I do is cut the ribs in strips & place them into crock pot. I add my favorite barbeque sauce to the crock pot & cook for 4-6 hours on high or 6-8 hours on low. They are the best & very tender. Much more simpler to make.

OMG! This was fall-off-the-bone delicious! This dish made me look like a fabulous cook. I made a few adjustments thanks to other reviewers. I did not boil the ribs. I used a cup of ketchup instead of the tomato sauce, beef ribs instead of pork ribs. I used a very small onion, and a bit more than a tablespoon of brown sugar. I put everything at once in a slow cooker adding about a 1/4 cup of water to make sure there was enough liquid in the slow cooker. Cooked it on low for 8 hours. Then put beef in a foil-lined baking dish with some of the sauce on it in a preheated oven at 400F for 10 minutes. It came out great! Thanks everyone!

I cooked them in the crock pot for about 8 hours. I just poured enough Sweet Baby Ray's over to cover.  I didn't mess with the other ingredients.  Once they had been in the crock pot long enough to be tender, I carefully placed them on a pan, brushed them with my Tastefully Simple Smokey Bacon Grill Sauce, and broiled for a few minutes.  They were Fantastic!  I will most definitely use this recipe from now on.

This recipe is AWSOME! I threw it together in minutes in the morning before work and let it cook on low all day (9 hours.) I did a few things differently, I didn't boil the ribs first and I added a little ketsup and bbq sauce to the tomato soup (I had more than 2lbs of ribs) I took the ribs out and put them on a foil lined cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 25 minutes just to crispen them a little. The meat fell right off the bone. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

I skipped the pre-boil and placed them directly into the crockpot. Set it on high for 1 hour followed by low for 3 and ended up with great ribs.

Trim your spare ribs, don't boil as it leeches the favor.  Put in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes while preparing sauce. I used marmalade instead of brown sugar,pomegranite vinegar in equal amounts with soy and worchester, added a litte ginger less onion, reduced the sauce (which was doubled) and coated the ribs well before covering--smelled terrific all day long and the precooked ribs came out nicely browned and moist!

I have yet to try this recipe but I just know it will be awesome. The one thing I won't do tho' is boil the ribs, as they sit in their own fat. I always pre-cook them, no matter how I cook them but I steam them as there will be no water on them and steaming rids them of extra fat.

I did not boil these first and 9 hours was wayyy too long to cook them.  They fell off the bone at 6 hours.  So tender and juicy - I will definitely make again.  Make sure you trim the fat before cooking.

This recipe turned out tender and very flavorful!  I made these for Father's Day and my husband was very happy with them!  I did not boil them, I put them straight in the crock pot and cooked them for 6 hours on low (with about 45 on high midway through because I was concerned I put them in too late).   I did watch a video of how to trim spare ribs first and I believe the key is in the trimming and the removal of the outer membrane.  I used half the amount of onion, as I usually do in most recipes!  I will make this again!

I took the advise of some other reviews and took them out of the crock after 6 hours, put BBQ sauce on them and baked them in the oven for 10 min. They were very good.

wow.  how easy and delicious! I tried this one day after I sprained my ankle and needed a dinner that wouldn't require much standing in the kitchen.   I did make a few adjustments.  I doubled the recipe of sauce, but not the onion.  I also added some tabasco, as my husband & I both love a little heat.  I will def. be making this again!

This recipe was my very first attempt at making BBQ ribs and it was met with resounding success. I used a commercial BBQ sauce for convenience as some others did  but now know I prefer my own homemade sauce.  Brilliant idea to parboil these first.  The aroma while cooking was virtually irresistible. The meat was fall off the bone tender, rich and deep BBQ flavor, not just a glaze.  In a family of known picky eaters, there was not left.  Thank you, Claton, for sharing this excellent recipe so that we may all enjoy the benefit of your success.

Great recipe - I did make some changes - I doubled all the ingredients except the onion and used stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato soup. After removing the ribs I scooped out the remainder of the cooked ingredients and served over the ribs. Even our picky son cleaned his plate.

I am not the best cook (according to my husband) so if I can pull something off that the family enjoys, then it's a winner!  I followed the changes I recently read, and added the ketchup, cooked it later at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, and thickened up the sauce with cornstarch.  It turned out pretty darn good!  I'm a teacher, so coming home to this already done was not bad!!!  Also, someone wrote about greasy sauce in the pan...mine was too until I thickened it on the stove...and it was so good, that I just stood there eating it with a spoon!!!!  Husband approved!!!

I made this recipe once, following it exactly. I expected to be a bit bland, but it turned out really nice. The meat was very tender and almost fell off the bone. Hubby and I liked it. We used the leftovers to make sandwiches the next day. Pussy cat licked the bones clean. Will make this one again.

Firstly, we took the advice of other members and cut back on the amount of onions the original recipe called for.  We have to say this recipe was amazing.  The meat literally feel off the bone.  Everyone loved it, kids included.  The only negative was I made the mistake of using country style pork ribs. There was a lot of fat.  I would definitely recommend using a better cut of ribs like baby back or St. Louis.  Otherwise, this is a phenomenal recipe.  Thanks so much.

Wow! Fabulous recipe. Used beef short ribs and didn't boil them, cooked for 10(!) hours. I personally hate tomato soup but as another reviewer stated the same problem and loved the recipe, I gave it a try. So glad I did! (Yes, the meat falls off the bone. Yes, there was a lot of oil on the top -- sucked it off with a turkey baster.) The taste was out of this world. My boys rated it a 10 out of 5!! Terrific recipe and one that will become a mainstay in my kitchen.

These were very good! I also only used half an onion but everything else to a tee. Took some of the sauce and thickened it on the stove and pour them on the ribs and put in the oven for about 10 min. They turned out great! Served over rice and used the non thinkened sauce also straight out of the crock pot to pour on the rice. Will make again

I have made this recipe three times now and every single time it has been outstanding.  My family has requested I make it every night.  I did not alter the recipe and it turned out great.  I highly recommend this recipe.  You'll be glad you made it.  Enjoy!

Hard to know how to rate this because I used a completely different sauce...but I used the boil/slow cooker method to cook the ribs and they were a-MAZ-ing...I could hardly get them out of the crock pot they were so tender. Would definitely make them this way again!

This recipe is great! It's packed with flavor and you can't help asking for seconds. Unfortunately, i only gave this 4stars because the it doesn't really taste exactly like barbecue because you can still taste the tomato sauce. But overall it's a wonderful recipe. Used double the amount of brown sugar and added a little honey mustard; we like our barbecue sweet. I cooked for 8 hours on low in my slow-cooker and the meat was literally falling off the bone. Don't know if that's a good thing, maybe for most people but it's a little too tender for my taste. Next time i'll cook it for only 6 hours. Will definitely make again and again and again.

It was excellent. The whole family loved it. I'll definitely make it again. I followed it exactly, and felt I could do with more onions and garlic. I used the red onions and it was very sweet.   One thing I've got to share - never omit Step 1. I read how some reviewers skip step 1 but this is what I've been told. Slow cooker takes a long time to heat up and cook the meat. Therefore, your raw meat would be sitting at room temperature for too long. In hot climate countries, you could easily get food poisoning. Therefore the advice to boil and cook the meat first is a good suggestion.

This was YUMMY!!!  I used BBQ sauce in place of the tomato soup.  One word of caution...boiling the ribs is really messy.  Use a larger pot than you think you'll need because there will be tons of foamy fat that rises to the top.  Except for the unwieldy process of boiling the ribs, once the crockpot got involved it was a breeze.  Made the house smell incredible.

The meat was fall-off-the-bone perfect, but the mixture left a LOT to be desired for my taste. We added some bbq sauce and it worked out just fine.   I cooked in crock pot of HIGH for 4-5 hours. I noticed that it smelled like chili when it was cooking, but the taste didn't translate so well.  I'll look at other people's suggestions when I do this again in the future, and certainly try to make the mixture more hearty and sweet.

No knife required! This meat comes clean off the bone. I only wish that the sauce had some kick to it. I will definitely make this again, but I'll use some bold spices or hot peppers to liven it up a little.

Love this, nice and easy.  I made minor changes, doubled the sauce, used half the onion.  After they were cooked, brushed them in bought barbeque sauce and cooked 10-15 mins at 400 to "dry" them up.  I also added a little bought sauce to the cooked sauce before serving, to thicken it up.  This a wonderful recipe, will definately make again.

Sauce was very bland, I would suggest adding more brown sugar, and we also added some HP sauce afterward just to make it less dull. Also, I followed other reviewers' advice and didn't boil the ribs first, and stick them in the oven afterwards, and they came out great. I would also suggest using a far shorter cooking time.

Fantastic ribs! It was my first time attempting ribs and it couldn't have been easier. They were falling off the bone and my husband and I couldn't get enough. I also used half an onion and doubled the sauce (I used ketchup as I only had 1 can of tomato soup). I cooked on low for 8 hours and then used some of the extra sauce on them and put them in the oven on 400 for 10 minutes. Will make them again in a heartbeat. I added a picture as well.

I did not care for this sauce at all-I had my doubts based on several reviews that there wasn't enough flavor, but figured I'd try it since I had some ribs on hand and it seemed simple. I put them in the crockpot and followed the ingredients exactly and they came out tasting bland. After pouring Sweet Baby Ray's over the top and baking for another 10 minutes, they were somewhat more palatable but not worth wasting good ribs. Sorry, just didn't care for this at all.

I did actually make this recipe as written the first time, and I would give it 4 stars as written but 5 (to our taste) when onion is reduced by half.  I have used this MANY times for boneless country style ribs and even a couple of times for a whole pork butt which I shredded for pulled pork sandwiches.  
For the people who are complaining it turns out greasy-  are you boiling the ribs first?  This step removes much of the fat.  And for the people who are complaining that their beef ribs did not taste good-  this is a recipe for pork!

Did as others suggested and used 1 c ketchup, 1 small onion, diced, 1 clove of garlic, 1 1/2 tbsps brown sugar, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp soy sauce. Cooked as directed for 7 hours. Removed ribs and placed in baking dish in oven for 20 min (375 degreesF). Did not preboil ribs either. At about noon mouthes were watering waiting for dinner tonight. Excellent recipe with awesome suggestions.

Our family loved this sauce.  The meat fell off the bones.  Like others mentioned, I did not boil the ribs first because I knew they would be in the slow cooker for longer than the cooking time suggested. This was an easy throw together & eat when you get home kind of meal!

I doubled the recipe. I also used 2 cans of Trader Joe's Tomato Sauce instead of the condensed tomato soup. I also boiled the meat for about 25 minutes to get out as much fat as I could. It was a rousing success! I served it over Asian noodles and 4 people finished it off - no leftovers! The meat was tender and moist. Excellent recipe and I will certainly cook this again!

My husband raved about this recipe!  He's a meat and potatoes guy- and this was a first for me, I'd never made spare ribs before.  I've been married for 12 yrs, and there aren't many firsts left!  It was easy, just prepare and leave them until they're tender.  I seared the ribs with a rub instead of boiling them, and added 2 cups of chicken broth to the crockpot.  After they were done I boiled down the liquid to a sauce, even with the cornstarch I added our favorite BBQ to thicken it more. Potato salad and deviled eggs made a very fun fresh meal on a mild day with spring on it's way!

This is the best spare rib recipe I've tried.  I used country style spare ribs and followed the recipe exactly.  I was also skeptical about using tomato soup but it turned out wondeful!  I served it with mashed potatoes to soak up the juices and even the kids asked for seconds.  I will be using this recipe from now on!

I loved this recipe and will use it again.  I would use the sauce with a pork tenderloin instead.  Plus, it would have been nice for it to have a little "kick."  Next time I'll add a dash of tabasco.  Otherwise, very easy adn very delicious.

This was my first attempt at cooking dinner in a slow cooker (and my first attempt at homemade ribs).  The meat was so tender it fell right off the bone and my husband loved it.  I added a little chili powder to the sauce for a bit of a bite.  Delicious.

This recipe turned out great! I did not have tomato soup, so I used two cans of tomato paste as a substitute. I was not particularly tied to quantities in the recipe and certainly used more garlic and onion than the recipe called for. I didn't need to thicken the sauce even after about 10 hours in the crock pot. I'm saving the leftover sauce (abundant) because it is too savory to toss, although the ribs are long gone! Make the recipe your own with preferences that match your family's tastes...the foundation of the recipe is very good.

Best slow cooker BBQ rib recipe I've tried so far. I deleted the rest. :) I used 2 Tbs of brown sugar because I like it sweet - other than that, this recipe is prefect.

I made the recipe as directed except used tomato bisque instead of regular tomato soup.  I was generous with the brown sugar too.  The meat is tasty - it did cook thoroughly in 6 hours, I think 8 hours is a bit much for only 2lbs of meat.

OK but nothing great.  Used can of Manwich and a tsp of Liquid Smoke to replace everything else.  Put in 400 oven for 10 minutes with BBQ sauce after the slow cooker.  Very tender, falling apart, but flavor was not nearly as good as they smelled .

these are wonderful with a few changes:  i used the large can tomato soup. i added a packet of sloppy joe season mix, a pkg lipton onion soup mix, used more garlic and used chicken or beef broth in place of 1/4 c water.  furthermore, i followed others suggestions to omit boiling ribs at first. the key is to bake them at the end. brush with plenty  of bbq sauce and bake at 400 for 10 mins. this will make these ribs taste like restaurant quality!  also, DO NOT  make the mistake and buy country style ribs. you must use either spare ribs (cheaper) or baby backs. my family loves this recipe buy we like things sort of salty so it needs doctoring.

Great recipe, I did not precook teh ribs. I served over mashed potatoes. They were a huge hit. Only thing was they were a little fatty. I'm new to cooking so maybe it was the type of ribs I bought. Everyone loved the flavor and was very satisfied.

Tried this great recipe last night for dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Very tasty. As an accompaniment to this dish, I added some cooked egg noodles and a tin of Asian vegetables, i.e., baby corn, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts, during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

I doubled this recipe and took the advice of other reviewers to cut back on the amount of onion used.  However, I found it to be EXTREMELY garlicky when all was said and done.  Don't know if I just had large cloves or if the recipe is meant to be that garlicky, but even for someone who loves garlic, it was almost too much to tolerate.

this was good.  A little too tomatoey...probably because of the tomato soup.  Next time I will use V8 instead for the extra flavor.  I used ribs cut in half lengthwise and then cut between each bone.  Only needed to be in the crockpot for 5 hours and still fell off the bone.

I took the suggestions of all the other reviewers (substituted ketchup for tomato soup, 1/2 an onion, and finished the ribs in the oven) and we loved it.  We will definitely make this again.

Loved the flavor of the sauce however I didn't think there was ENOUGH sauce. I cooked them on low for the amount of time specified but there was very little sauce left and the edges of my ribs were a tad burnt. I suggest adding a little more water to the recipe. Otherwise great! Thanks :)

These were tasteless. I followed the recipes exactly. I was skeptical when I saw the ingredients. I used country ribs and cooked for 7.5 hours. The meat was very tender and falling of the bone but very bland. I am now wondering how this recipe  got so many good reviews. I ended up putting some bottles BBQ sauce on the ribs for flavor.

This is awesome - you gotta try it!!  So easy to make and so worth it!  I sauteed the onions in butter and browned my spare ribs before I placed them in the slow cooker.  I also changed this recipe to make 10 servings (i have boys) and had so much sauce left over.  I put the excess sauce in the freezer so I can use it the next time I make these ribs.  I'll cut the sauce recipe in 1/2 when I make it again.  Other than that I would'nt change a thing!!  thanks for this awesome, easy & delicious recipe!

These are the best ribs I have ever had! I did modify the recipe a little bit though. First of all, I changed the amount of servings to feed 6 people. Second, instead of using 2 cans of tomato soup, I used 3/4 can tomato soup, and 1/2 can of ketchup. Third, I only used one onion and about a teaspoon more brown sugar. Finally, I used country style ribs instead of spare ribs. I made these for a dinner party I had, and everyone raved over them. Everyone who came, left with the recipe. They are awesome. Enjoy!

Good recipe!!  I used a 2 qt. crock pot and changed the ingredients to 2 servings.  The amount was just perfect.  No over eating and no leftovers.  Be sure to cook it on low for half the time stated in the directions.

We love these....we use pork country style ribs and they just fall apart. I use more brown sugar about half a cup  and more garlic. But overall the recipe is great we make it frequently.
Thanks for sharing it!

This recipe caught my eye because you don't use BBQ sauce.  My husband hates BBQ sauce, so I made this last night and it turned out well.  Six hours is plenty of time to let it cook.  I made the recipe exactly as it said.  Next time though, I would add more tomato soup.  After it was served it could have used more sauce.  It had just the right amount of flavor for my family.  We aren't big on robust or spicy flavor.  I would definatley make it again.

Made these as directed, however used a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard as I was out of worcestershire sauce. 
I also followed on reviewers comment about putting a paper towel between the lid of the slow cooker so as to not water down the sauce with the steamy condensation...worked like a charm.
Excellent ribs!

I always peruse all the reviews before I make or keep a recipe and this was disappointing. I have been using the same recipe for over 50 yrs so perhaps our systems got a jolt. My husband didn't care for it either but this doesn't mean it isn't agreeable with someone else's taste buds.
On another note I really object to those people who grade a recipe depending on whether it is heart healthy or just plain healthy. If they are so conscious of this fact they should ignore the recipe period or have the expertise to do the conversions to make it heart healthy! I'm sure that most would agree. Even the most health conscious of us all tend to slip for special occasions or seasonal events! Merry Christmas.

Never made ribs before, honestly I'm not a big rib guy.  But I got the itch to try to make some after seeing the recipe on here.  I added about 1/4 cup of honey to the sauce and otherwise cooked as directed.  I was going to save some for my wife to try when she got home, but... you don't get much ribs with a 3lb rack when they are this good, looks like I'll be making this again and again and again.

These ribs were 'fall of the bone'.  I added just about 1/2 cup of Honey BBQ sauce, but otherwise I followed the recipe exact.  Delicious.  These will be in my family forever.

This is the perfect recipe for ribs if you have children who are sensitive to spicy foods. It tastes like barbecue but it's not spicy. Most recipes for ribs turn out quite spicy because they're cooking in spicy sauces for hours and hours! These were just perfect. Will not be needing another spare ribs recipe ever!

I had to fight my 10 year old son away from the crock pot so I could get these on the plate.  HUGE hit at my house.  Ribs fell off the bone.  Will definitely do this again.

Excellent recipe!  Used can of crushed tomatoes for tomato soup (what I had in the pantry) along with brown sugar, worchester, soy, vinegar, salt and pepper.The ribs were excellent. Succulent, juicy, perfect. Thanks!

This was a great recipe and I thought the flavor was wonderful!  My problem was that I had to turn on the slow cooker early in the morning (7:00) and by the time I got home (4:00), some of the sauce was burning in the crock pot!  If I could have started it later, it would have been fine.  Perhaps I will double the sauce recipe the next time so it won't all boil away by the time I get home.  The meat was PERFECT and just falling off the bone!  I will definitely make this again.

Last week I put country style ribs in the slow cooker and added 2/3 of a bottle of Hunt's Honey Hickory BBQ sauce for 8 hrs on low.  My 6 y.o.-who wont put sauce on anything-wanted the leftovers in her lunch at school for the rest of the week!  So easy and very delicious.  I served them with artichokes.

I didn't care for the taste of the sauce. The taste of tomato soup was very prevalent.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I might make this again, but add Sweet Baby Ray's BB sauce next time.  Thanks for sharing

Very good recipe! Like other reviews, I doctored sauce a bit. Added 1/2 of a bottle of BBQ sauce and squirted in some catsup. Grated 1/2 an onion and used minced garlic. Had no brown sugar, which I thought was ok because of BBQ sauce. My house smells wonderful while it's cooking!

Fabulous! But I tweeked it a little.  Doubled the recipe...except used 1 can tomato soup and 1 cup ketchup.  Not a whole onion. Used 4 tbsp. of brown sugar and a splash of vinegar.  Loved it.

The ribs were nice and tender, but the sauce needed some more flavor.  Perhaps I should have read the past reviews for some ideas.

I made this with boneless country style ribs. After 3 hours they were falling apart, reminded me of pulled pork. I add a dash of liquid smoke for a nice smokey flavor.

I used 1 T of molasses instead of the brown sugar, and a bit more garlic - but these would probably be quite tasty as is.  The condensed soup sauce worked out much better than I expected.  In my crockpot on low, 8 hours was really pushing it - I'll go for 7 at the max next time.

I used a 4 pound slab of spare ribs, cut it into 2 rib pieces, and cooked them in a 6 quart slow cooker.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and cooked them for 6 1/2 hours.  The meat was so tender and juicy that it fell off the bones and the flavor was fantastic.  The recipe is so easy that I don't think that I will ever do ribs any other way.

This is a very good recipe. I put my spare ribs in the oven for a little bit til they brown a little and some of the fat is taken out then put them in the crock pot. Very good recipe. Thank you.

Added a very small amount of liquid smoke and added some southern hickory seasoning plus some ground black pepper. Doubled the sauce and added 4 chicken wings (for 2 servings). Next time, I think I won’t boil it before hand but then again I used baby back ribs (the only ones I will use) instead of spare ribs.

This certainly made for falling-off-the-bone ribs but it didn't have much flavor and too much fat floating on the top. The liquid was flavorful and too runny. However, I used it later to make a very tasty soup. A better solution would have been to wrap the ribs in foil covered with barbeque sauce and baked for several hours. Not bad, but needs work.

I was afraid that there would be too much onion and that they would need BBQ sauce, but I ate them all before I got a chance to add the sauce. The meal was perfect after a cold, rainy day. I'll definitely make this again.

Just delicious and super easy.  I made this the other night when I bought the ribs on sale.  I wasn't sure what to do with thme and I stumbled on this recipe.  I didn't have fresh onion or garlic on hand so I substituted dried minced onion and garlic powder.  Still came out great.  I could tell my hubby loved it because he stopped talking and only grunted a few times while he skarfed the ribs down.  That means it was delicious.

This recipe is amazing!!! The ribs just melt in your mouth and have a wonderful after taste as well.  After the ribs were done we kept on dipping the bones into the remaining sauce and sucking it off them. I followed the recipe exactly as it appears here and the ribs were done in 3 hours, bu then again I could only buy tiny, little ribs at the time.

This was very tasty and was a hit at my monthly cooking club.  I did refrigerate the sauce before thickening it so that I could remove most of the fat.  It's not anything out of the ordinary, but is a good, easy recipe that I will definitely make again.

Used 2.5 lbs of baby back ribs & marinaded in the sauce overnight, using only 1/2 onion.  Added tad of sriracha sauce - no Tabasco sauce available. Needed a bit more of a kick, though.  Next time, will add some hickory smoke liquid and ginger. Not too tomatoey or too sweet. Drain the sauce & had to skim off the oil/fat. Even tho baby back ribs do not have much fat on them, after cooking for so long, there's bound to be fat.  Cooked it on "low" for 5 hrs & meat was falling off the bone when I tried to pick them up with a tong. Next time reduce the amount of cooking time to maybe 4 hrs. Overall, flavor was not bad but could use a tinge more of a kick to it.

Tried it and liked it, tho slo cooking for 10 hours is far too much, the ribs are and were cooked after about 6 hours, and were really good.  The big extra was 1/2 cup of Jack Daniels, which really boosted up the flavour and the aroma..

I hardly ever rate recipes on this site, but I had to do this one. These ribs are PERFECT! I was a little hesitant to use a can of tomato soup, but it was amazing. I didn't boil the ribs first either. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. The ribs were so juicy and tender.. I don't think I'll be using the grill for ribs anymore! :)

These ribs are very good but not the best recipe I have tried. They could use a bit more flavor. I think next time I would use barbeque sauce instead of tomato soup.

This was a DELICIOUS recipe! Made a couple tweeks here and there based on what I had on hand, but overall this dish was a hit! Will definitely be making this again.

This was a quick to make, tummy warming recipe.  My hubby loved the tender ribs.  I changed it just a bit and used OJ in place of water.  Served with Microwaved Sweet Potatoes 7 minutes, and a quick tossed spinach salad while the potatoes cooked, and after a long day at work, I had little to do to have dinner on the table.

I couldn't believe how amazing this was! I was cautious about all the rave reviews but they were right on the money! I doubled the recipe and used catchup (instead of soup) and only added 1 onion.  It slid of the bones and melted in our mouth!! AMAZING!!

This was easy and the ribs were super tender. The meat just fell off the bones. I only used 1/2 the amount of onions as others had suggested. I agree the sauce is a little bland. Next time I will add some more spices.

This reciepe was great for a bunch of crazy spare ribs that the butcher gave us. The sauce was just a little bland but I'm also 9 months pregnant so my taste buds can be off :)  My husband and mother loved them!!

It was ok...I think it was a little bland for my preference. BBQ sauce would of been better. I also used pork ribs which didnt agree with me because of the fat content. I will use beef ribs next time.

UPDATE: I now have two kids since my first review. Our daughters 6 & 3 eat these ribs right to the bone. It's a meal that we all love!!

I'm not a big meat eater and I LOVE these ribs. My husband and I used to have these almost every Sunday during the winter. They are the perfect meal for two. If you have to feed more people than that, you may want to up the poundage. The only change we've ever made is subbing tomato soup with Knorr Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup, for a little extra kick (not extra spice, just extra kick)

The eaters in my house all thought it was too sweet.  They didn't even touch the leftovers. I liked the ease of preparation, may try this with a different sauce.

I made these spare ribs and they were delicious. I put them in the slow cooker on my lunch hour. Before going to bed, I took them out, put in fridge and finished them off in the oven the next night with the barbeque sauce.  My teenage daughter is already requesting these for her birthday dinner in August.   They fell right off the bone.

I did not care for the taste of this sauce. I was hesitant because of the tomato soup. Maybe it depends on what 'brand' that you use. The meat however was very tender. Thanks for letting me give this a try.

I used around 6 lbs of pork spare ribs. The ribs just slid off of the bone..I guess we are having pulled pork sandwiches instead of pork ribs.The sauce is a little bland, so I added more Famous Daves Rich and Sassy barbecue sauce. The meat is VERY tender. I did boil the ribs before putting them in the crock pot to help remove some of the fat. I've never made ribs this way before..but I was feeling for them and the weather was not good for outdoor barbecue..I'll probebly make this again..just not sooooo much of it..

This was too good for words! I made it as written, except for using 3 lbs of spare ribs instead of 2. Tender, flavorful and delicious so if you don't have a high risk of heart disease - get cooking!

The meat fell right off the bone! I think I will use a favorite BBQ sauce instead of the sauce in the recipe. It did not taste like BBQ, but rather meat with lots of tomato sauce....

These were great IF you forget about the cornstarch and add a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce. Also, left out the soy sauce b/c we didn't have any but that was just less sodium anyway. I over cooked by an hour. Try not to. Falling off the bone is nice but too much is just too much.

Very, very good and tender! Simple!  I used ketchup in place of the tomato soup.  I thought the soup would make the sauce too runny.  Excellent turn out!

Awesome Ribs!!! Meat fell right off the bone.  I use ketchup instead of tomato sauce as sugguested in other reviews and I loved it.  Will definitely make again.

The meat was tender, but the sauce was so bland.  Next time, I'll just use a bottle of barbeque sauce.

These were so good and tender. Since so many people said the sauce needed help, I tried the Bar-B-Que Sauce by Debi K on this site to pass at the table.  It used a lot of the same ingredients and was also quick.  Fantastic!

The ribs were very tender, moist and really easy to put together. I found them to be a bit on the bland side but my husband really enjoyed them. A nice meal for a lazy Sunday but I think next time I will add a bit of hot sauce to spice them up a touch.

I used western style ribs that I had in the freezer and browned them first, then added approx. 1/3 c. water to the sauce and cooked for 8 hrs.  Turned out perfect!  All three of my kids ate every bite - quite unusual in my household!

This has become our standard spare rib recipe.  The ingredients are all on hand and it's easy to throw together.  I haven't experimented much with other recipes though.  This one suits us just fine.

I didn't care too much for this recipe. The onion and garlic taste was overpowering and the sauce was too thin. If I had to do it over again, I would cut down the onion and garlic by half and add a tablespoon more brown sugar. I don't think I will be making it again though.

I thought it was very good. I did boil the ribs for 15 minutes. I do not like tomato soup so I used tomato catsup, brown sugar, honey (no Worcestershire),3/4 of an onion but I don't think a whole onion would have been too much, 3 garlic cloves. I cooked them on high for about 30 minutes then on low for about 5 hours. They were very tender.

Other than adding some hot pepper sauce and onion powder, I followed this recipe and the ribs were delicious.  After thickening the sauce at the end, I poured it over the ribs on a baking sheet and put them in the oven for ten minutes.  As for the initial boiling of the ribs, I think it is a good idea to do that because it removes a lot of fat that would otherwise end up in the crock pot.  Great recipe, thank you Claton.

The meat was wonderfully tender but the sauce was too bland so I added 2 TBSP garlic chili sauce before pouring it over the ribs.  Also put the cornstarch in at the beginning so sauce was perfectly thickened.  When it comes to the onion, I used one that made about 1-1/2 cups diced.  Perhaps the recipe should say volume of chopped onions instead of 'one onion' as sizes vary widely.  I plan to make pulled pork using this recipe!

Mi first meal with Pork Spare Ribs. My in-laws really loved it. I had 3 lb of pork but did not change any of the ingredient. It was perfect as is. Just like others, after 6-8 hours in the slow cooker, I put it on the tray, put some bbq sause over it and let it stay for 10 minutes in 400 degree oven. That was it was a bit dryer, and more appealing to eat. Also, the sauce was really good with mashed potatoes. Not too strong, not too blend...just perfect.

We have made these twice now.  The second time I shredded the pork and made sandwiches out of it.  I took the pork out and put the juices in a pot on the stove.  I added flour and simmered it for a few minutes until it was thick.  I mixed the pork and gravy and put it back in the slow cooker.  Awesome meal for the Packer game.  Everyone loved the sandwiches.

I was surprised I liked it.  I thought tomato soup sounded so weird and it didn't smell good the first few hours!  Followed the directions, except that I only had Tomato Parmesan Bisque on hand, but you can't go wrong with cheese.  Will make this again!

I made this recipe for my in-laws (I'm a vegetarian).  I followed the other recommendations and doubled the recipe.  I substituted V8 juice for the condensed tomato soup. I left out the soy sauce and cornstarch. After the spare ribs were cooked, I coated them with BBQ sauce and baked them in the oven at 400F for about 20 minutes.   Everybody thought the ribs were very tender. It looks as though I will be making this again.

I love this recipe! I made this for a super-bowl party which was also my husband's birthday.  I didn't use the corn starch. All I did was leave the slow cooker on warm and remove the lid so the sauce could thicken. Also, since we like spicy food, we added about 2 tsp of Tabasco sauce.  It gave it a good zing and everyone was raving about it!

it was ok but i probably won't make again.  i had to doctor up the sauce after it was cooked because it didn't have enough flavor for me.

Preparation was very easy, but the finished product was a wet mess.  Sloppy, saucy, floating bones... Flavor was mild and tomatoey (I would suggest adding something a little spicy to give it kick), meat was tender but fatty.  Won't be making this again.

I was very nervous about making these esp since none of like tomato soup.  However, all of us, including 2 fussy children devoured them.

Pretty good. I could see myself making it again. I might add some salt and peppers. I like it to have a little more zip.

These turned out ok ... I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce but my fiance seemed to like it.  Don't know if I'd make these again.

These were great! Nick is a professed ribaholic loved the sauce and said how tender the meat was, it fell off the bone.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

Oh my gosh these are so good! I followed the recipe to a tee and thought it was wonderful, not to mention super easy. The sauce was thin at the end but the meat was so flavorful we didn't even need to pour more of the sauce over it, I just served straight from the crock pot with corn on the cob and biscuits. Delicious and easy which makes it a keeper in our house!

I did so much cooking today that I didn’t feel like eating.  My kids and husband didn’t have that problem.  They raved about these ribs so much and said they are even better than the ones my father does on the grill.  I finally did try a taste and they were pretty good. I followed one reviewer’s suggestion and I put them in the oven at 400 degrees to let them finish cooking for 20 minutes.  This helped “dry” them out and made them less saucy.

Made exactly following directions.  While this was tasty, I'd probably use less onion and less garlic next time.  A little too strong on both.  Certainly was easy enough to make.

I really loved the recipe.  Very simple and the ribs were so moist!  But, the sauce is definately on the bland side. I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll make it again for sure, but will check out the advise of others and look for ways to add some flavor.

I thought they were wonderful!!!  I made them for my family (including 2 kids) and they all loved it.  There were 7 of us, and I made alot of side dishes to go with it.  Next time I will double the recipe, because everyone fought over the last peice!  I did not make any substitutions to the recipe, wonderful just the way it is!

I used the modification that someone else used and liked... sloppy joe sauce instead of canned tomato soup.  My husband who will eat ANYTHING didn't even finish his first plate.  This was the first recipe that ever went in the garbage.  I'm going to make it again, but using tomato soup this time and will hope for better luck

i definitely digged these! They hit the spot. this was the first time i used a slow cooker to cook. i left them all day and was quite pleased to come home to this amazing dinner. the meat just came off so easily. i absolutely LOVED the sauce too but i prefer a thicker sauce though. other than that they were outrageously yummy!

I thought this was wonderfully easy. I put the ribs together late on a Friday evening and let them simmer until early Saturday morning. It made Saturdays dinner a snap!! Great taste and simple clean up. I will use this often.

This was a great recipe for ribs, however, my boyfriend thought that the sauce was a little too tomato-y.  Next time, I'll add a little more Worcestershire and soy sauce.  Other than that, very tender ribs with VERY little work!  Thanks!

very easy recipe especially for someone who has little time.  The meat came right off the bones but it definately needs something else.  Will make again but will put in a baking dish with bbq sauce and bake for about 10 mins like another person did.  Maybe this will give it the kick it needs.

THESE WERE AWESOME!! My boyfriend and I lovvvveeddddd these ribs....Didn't take as long as 6 hours. About 4 worked for me...
Didn't need the cornstarch....I think I used a little less than 2lbs of ribs (AND they were boneless) which could account for the changes in recipe...These will stay in my recipe cards forever :-) Thank you so much!! MMMMMMM!!!!

This was pretty good. It does taste like swiss steak. I cooked this all day yesterday and we went on a family outing. On our way home we stopped and got Taco Bell, forgetting we had dinner cooking. So maybe i cant fairly rate this because i had put it in the fridge over night. My husband says he would give it 3 stars but i think it deserves 4. I might make this again.

Very tender.  I added about 1T of yellow mustard and 1T of honey.  The ribs came  out delicious.

My husband and I enjoyed this for dinner tonight.  I used about half an onion and didn't bother boiling the ribs first but followed the rest of the recipe as written. I cooked for 6 1/2 hours on low and that was perfect for us. Someone posted on another recipe that you can put the crock pot lid on top of paper towels to keep the sauce from getting too thin (the paper towels absorb excess moisture).  I tried it tonight and it really seemed to work. No need to thicken the sauce.  I am not a tomato soup fan but I thought this sauce was excellent on the ribs.

I've made this recipe twice now and my family loves it! I didn't boil the ribs first, used the sauce in the recipe, cooked all day while I was at work. My husband told me to keep this recipe.

This is why I love this site!  So delicious. A few changes madevwere: 1/2 onion, little more brown sugar, ketchup instead of tomato soup.  Cooked for 6 hours, then broiled a few minutes. Thanks to all the cooks out there who help me feed my four teen sons and husband. This was great.

I can only give this recipe 4 stars because the sauce was bland. I even added crushed red peppers and cayenne pepper. I will, however, adopt this cooking method (15 minute boil before the slowcooker) for spare ribs as they fell apart when I tried to grab them with tongs!

Very good - I added some liquid smoke and made it very tasty. Not sure if it would have been as good otherwise. Used a very small onion and it wasn't too oniony as others stated.

they were tender enough, but maybe would be better if cooked first in another pot to drain the fat from them.
sauce was an alright flavor. i will keep searching for a recipe.

The ribs came out perfect! Fall off the bone. The only thing we will do differently is use some of our own sauce. The sauce was a bit bland.

This recipe was fabulous. The meat was tender and flavorful. I was stuck with spare ribs that were on sale at the grocery store and I had no idea what to do with them. The other ingredients were all on hand and it turned into one of my husband's top 10 favorite recipes of all time. We let the meat cook for the full 8 hours so the meat fell apart with the touch of a fork. If you like it less done, I would cook it for 6 hours--it was still firm at that point.

It was very nice. The only change I made was I cooked it a little more than 15 mins to start with, and I did not add cornstarch. It took a little longer than 3 hours in the slow cooker and I served it with noodles.

Did the recipes as written and it was fine and that is what I've rated it as.  Not great, but fine.  But after making a few.... ok, more than a few tweaks, I landed on something pretty good.
1) no boil.
2) slashed the cook time to around 5 hours (might even cut down another 30 min next time)
3) removed the tomato soup and brown sugar, and replaced with a combination of about a cup of bbq sauce (homemade if possible but store bought is fine), and 1/4 cup of sweet chili sauce (I used Mea Ploy).

The ribs ended up delicious and the resulting sauce is great.  Could put it on a shoe and it would be good.

The flavor was great. I skipped the boiling step advice other reviewers shared. It’s easy to find all ingredients and make the ribs. The ribs and onions got a little burnt on the edge. I’ll definitley cook it again for the good taste but will experiment  with more evenly paste instead of pouring the paste over the meat

Pretty good overall. Definitely 'fall off the bone', but the flavor wasn't all that potent.

My whole family loves this recipe just as it’s written! Partially cooking the ribs prior to slow cooking helps with the cook time for my schedule. The tomato soup sauce is a welcome variation to bbq sauce. (And we’re onion lovers - there is never too much onion!) Also, the sauce tastes good with rice served on the side. I always make a double batch for leftovers!

My husband loved it, it was not as spicy as some barbecue sauces as they can be overpowering. I used boneless country spare ribs and roasted garlic. The sauce was an addicting got too have more flavor, worked well with pork. This is our new slow cooker barbecue sauce.

Found this recipe because I had just bought country style ribs in the morning. Followed the recipe just as written and they were great. Tender, moist and very flavorful. I was a little worried about the amount of onion but it just enhanced the flavor.

I think the tomato sauce killed it.  Ribs did fall off the bones very nice but was missing that barbecue rib taste..

This had a very nice flavor.  Not exactly a barbecue flavor, but still very good.  The ribs were very tender.  I would make this again!

I have made this recipe twice and LOVE it.  My kids like it and that is alone is amazing!  Instead of serving the whole boneless rib I make pulled pork.  I pull the pork and put it back in the sauce.  The sauce is mild and if you like it a little more tangy add your favorite bbq sauce as a topping along with cole slaw on a kaiser roll.  I also don't pre-cook the ribs, just add them to the slow cooker with all the ingredients. EXCELLENT!

I followed this recipe to a t with the exception of using Boston butt pork steaks instead of spare ribs.  I cut the meat off of the bone after boiling the recommended time.  The only thing I added was a green pepper and the recipe turned out great.

I liked this better than my husband did, but I have to say the country spare ribs were very tender and tasty.  I added a little basil and a can of cream of mushroom soup.
