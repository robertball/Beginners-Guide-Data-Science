These looked fabulous!! When microwaving the sugar cones, use your judgement regarding the times. I put the cones in for 20 seconds then another 10 seconds to shape them. Worked out beautifully!! My family thought they were very cute & I loved reusing sugar cones from a summer party. Thank you for the wonderful idea!!
