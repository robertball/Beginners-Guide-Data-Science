Overall a pretty good potato casserole.  However, when I tasted the cheese sauce before adding it to the casserole dish, I found it to be really lacking in flavor so I added parmesan cheese, paprika, a 1/2 tsp of curry powder, a few dashes of worcestire sauce and a small handful of fresh oregano from my garden.  That helped alot!  I also used fresh cauliflower - about a half a head chopped in big pieces and scattered on top!  Nice flavor and smelled great while cooking!

The kids don't like cauliflower much, so I just left that out and added a few more potatoes.  This is a great easy recipe, and I will make it again.

I did this for a potluck and my friends absolutely loved it. They finished this dish first. I substituted Swiss for some Italian cheese. I think it still tastes good. Cauliflower and potatoes are amazing combinations!
Will do it again. It's so so simple.

Oh my! Oh my! I love this stuff! I omitted the cauliflower for my picky husband and used Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes. It was awesome. I bet it's unbelievable with the cauliflower. I think next time I make it, I'll add cauliflower to my side. It's soooooo goooooood!

easy enough to make - i think the next time i make it i would use an extra sharp cheddar and add some spices - fresh ground pepper maybe. i would also leave out the ham - as a side dish i think it's too much with the meat - maybe add a bit more ham and it could become a lunch cassarole.

A really great side dish(no ham). We loved the flavour, added a little cayene to the cheese sauce to zing it up a touch. Will make this again and again.

I also had trouble getting the potatoes to cook completely.  Even after an extra 20 minutes cooking.  The flavor wasn't bad, but instead of cornflakes usted french fried onions.  I think they added enough flavor to keep it from being too bland, as my family also found the cheese sauce to be rather bland.  Might try this recipe again with already cooked potatoes, and jazz up the cheese sauce a little.  Thanks for sharing though.

Very delicious and easy recipe. I didn't have the cheeses the recipe calls for on hand so I used Parmesan and mozzarella and it turned out great. I also did not have cauliflower so I used frozen peas instead. I left out the cornflake topping and just let the cheese sauce brown a little. I will definitely be making this again.

Very Good!  Used a cup of cubed spiral ham out of the freezer (thawed).  Also, used mixed cheese:  half swiss, half cheddar.  Microwaved sliced potatoes with just a splash of water to get them started - then added other ingredients and baked as directed.  Didn't even notice the cauliflower.  After dinner a guest asked for the recipe, and it wasn't until then that I remembered the cauliflower was even in there!

I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions: sub'd Ritz for the cornflakes, and added more seasoning to the cheese sauce. I also sliced my potatoes on a mandolin, so they were not 1/4-inch thick, and I am glad that I did, because even that thin, they weren't cooked all the way. Great one dish dinner, will definitely be making this again.

This was a good and hearty casserole.  I used broccoli instead of cauliflower for the added vitamins.  I also use red-skinned yellow potatoes because that's what I had on hand, and precooked the slices some since they are a more dense potato.  Since a couple other reviewers mentioned that the cream sauce doesn't melt downward, I layered the sauce in three times between the potatoes and meat and the meat and broccoli (and then on top).  The sauce recipe is a great consistancy and makes a good amount, but next time I will add more flavoring to it - salt, pepper, garlic, and maybe some other herbs.  A person could easily substitute other meats or cheeses for different flavors (or whatever is on hand!)

Would make a good breakfast casserole too, in my opinion!

This is very tasty, I did add a few extra ingredients like broccoli, mushrooms and ham that really added flavor.  I also used real pressed garlic instead of powder.  I didn't have corn flakes but it turned out great anyway--definitely one to keep on hand!

Great recipe!  I used broccoli instead of cauliflower & fried onions instead of the corn flakes.  I had no trouble getting the potatos cooked - just slice them very thinly.

This was a good casserole.  I used fresh broccoli and sharp cheddar cheese and added some garlic, oregano and a dash of cayene pepper.  Everyone had seconds...  leftovers were a bit dry.

Really tasty. I partially precooked the potatoes and the (fresh) cauliflower in the microwave to make sure that it would be ready in less than an hour and I didn't bother with the cornflakes. I also left out the ham.

I had some ham to use up and tried this.  It was pretty good - nothing sensational but enjoyable.  I used fresh cauliflower and had no trouble with the potatoes and cauliflower being fully cooked - they were done perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe Ersta!

Turned out great.  I used this recipe more as guide while trying to use up what was in my fridge.  I steamed the potatoes & cauliflower prior to adding them to the cassarole.  I used cooked bacon instead of ham.  For the sauce I just mixed together 1&1/4 C Plain Yogurt, 1/4 C Cream Cheese, 1 C milk,  shredded mozzarella & parmesan, 1/2 tsp thyme, salt & pepper.  Then I poured the mixture over the layers allowing the cheese to melt while cooking.   Used crushed saltines instead of cornflakes for topping.

I was dissapointed in this casserole.  It took a lot of preparation and cooking time and di not turn out that great.  The potatoes stayed raw and hard at the bottom...they never fully cooked through.  The corn flakes did not really give it added taste.  We only ate the cauliflower and ham mixed with cheese sauce (which I thought was too thick and only used half of it) off of the top.  I would not waste my time making it again.

The cheese sauce was amazing before I added it to the dish. After it cooked it lost some of its flavor.  I think it had to do with the bland uncooked potatoes at the bottom(they weren't soft enough for me)... I will try this again, but i think i will season the potatoes add green peppers, onion, and butter and let them bake while i prepare the cheese sauce... then i will continue with the steps in the recipe.  I had higher hopes for this recipe... so I hope it ROCKS MY SOCKS with my changes.

This was a really good cassorole. Since many people complained about potatoes that took forever to bake, I boiled them first for about 20 minutes. Then they only needed about 25 minutes baking time. The onion was very sharp, and my kids kept picking it out. Next time I'd saute it. I left out the ham. I also used broccoli instead of cauliflower since that's what I had and it was great, added color too.

My husband LOVED this recipe. He kept telling me I can make it any time. The only things I did different were that I used frozen broccoli/cauliflower mix rather than just cauliflower. I also didn't have swiss cheese so I just used 1 1/2 cups colby jack, and it worked great.  I also microwaved the potatoes first so they were done before I put them in the casserole. It still took an hour to heat it all through. Fabulous recipe!

This turned out great, even though I was unsure about the combination of ingredients.  No one that ate it even realized it had the califlower in it!  I told them all after they had finished eating.  It cooked up so soft that everyone thought it was just more potatoes. So if you or your family are not big califlower fans, this is a great way to work the veggie in without tasting it.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added more seasoning, and didn't use the cornflake topping.  I also cooked it longer (about 2 hours) on 350 degrees.  In my experience potato dishes don't cook through that fast.  Overall, this is a great recipe.  I will certainly make it more!

This recipe is really good. I substituted crushed potato chips for the cornflakes and my family loved it. You could also use cheddar cheese soup if you don't have shredded cheese on hand.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I have never eaten a better casserole.  I did make a couple of changes, but nothing major.  I seasoned the potatoes before layering them in the dish with garlic and onion powder, paprika, and seasoned salt.  I added the same seasoning to the cheese sauce.  I omitted the cauliflower due to nobody in the house likes it.  I also added some more cheese on top when I added the corn flakes.  The whole thing was gone by the end of the night and there are only 3 people that live here! Thank you for an amazing recipe.

Great dish! I always love the combination of cheese sauce and cauliflower.  Just enough flavor to make it a simple winter dish.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it as the original recipe called for. I feel like the ingredients of this recipe will combine to make a delicious casserole, but this recipe calls for such substantive reworking that it should not be listed as more than 1 star. I made it exactly as written, and the cheese sauce was so thick it just sat on top, didn't coat the other ingredients, and ended up rubbery, the ham dried out, and the potatoes needed more time to cook. Unfortunately, I don't have time to read through all of the reviews each time I try a new recipe, and I figured that since this one was rated so highly, the original prep would work. I WAS WRONG!

I wish when I was making this I would have went with my gut and used broccoli instead of cauliflower. It seemed like that would have gone better with the ham and potatoes then the cauliflower did. The cauliflower to me seemed out of place and didn't really add anything extraordinary. The cheese sauce was good and it did cover the casserole without tossing which I was worried about from other reviews and our potatoes cooked all the way through in the bake time stated but I do think I did slice them a little thinner than called for. Overall, ok but would probably try other recipes before having this one again.

I thought this was very tasty and easy to make.  I did use crumbled bacon rather than ham, used a combination of colby, cheddar, and swiss cheese, and also added some cayanne for a little kick.

The name says it all--The best!!  I made the cheese sauce with half and half and doubled the spices.  From other reviews I sauced and seasoned each layer of potatoes with Mrs. Dash and combined the rest of ingredients with reserved sauce before pouring all over the potato layers. I added mushrooms and chopped ham to the cauliflower and onions. I used one head fresh cauliflower.  I will definately make this again and again!  My husband wouldn't let me take it to work for a pot-luck, it was that good.  Thanks!!

THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE IT AGAIN. I WAS OUT OF FLOUR SO I USED CORN STARTCH INSTEAD. I USED 4 TBSP OF IT, STILL TOO THICK. NEXT TIME I WILL ONLY USE 1 OR 2. ALSO, I LAYERED THE POTATOES AS DIRECTED, BUT I SHOULDVE SEASONED THEM AS I LAYERED THEM. NEXT TIME I WILL WITH SALT, PEPPER, GARLIC, AND ONION POWDER. IF THEY WERE MORE SEASONED I THINK IT WOULDVE GOTTEN 5 STARS. THEY WERE ALSO A BIT UNDER COOKED. I ALSO THREW IN A PACK OF SLICED MUSHROOMS BEFORE I PUT THE CAULIFLOWER ON. THEY WERE VERY GOOD ON THERE AS WELL. MY HUSBAND WHO DOESNT EVEN LIKE HONEY BAKED HAM, LOVED THIS RECIPE. HE EVEN WISHED THERE WAS MORE HAM IN IT. I ALSO TOPPED IT WITH THE FRIED ONIONS. VERY GOOD!!!!!

This turned out pretty well! The cheese sauce was a little too thick; it just sat on top & didn't melt down to the potato layers while cooking. I may cut down the flour next time to make it slightly less thick. Family loved it!

I didn't have any cauliflower so I just stuck with the potatoes and ham, however, I enjoyed this dish, although it took longer to cook than it stated on the recipe.  Mine took about an hour and 20 minutes... still, it was worth the extra 20.

I didn't use ham but added some chopped green bell peppers.  Could use a little more spices and I was not accustomed to the texture (cauliflower and potatoes?) but it was still pretty good. I might experiment with this more in the future.

this was a great recipe. My dish was too small when I started to layer everything so I found a bigger one. Well then it was not layered very nicely. all the potatoes and broccoli was mixed up oddly with the ham. but it was still good. I added steak seasoning to the cheese sauce and some peppereka. this is a budget meal.

Great dish.  The cook time is a bit off, needed to cook for an additional 45 minutes because the potatoes weren't done.  Other than that, it was a hit at my house.

4.5 star recipe. Easy to adapt to personal tastes. Added parsley, onion powder, & extra garlic powder to improve flavour. Used gouda in place of swiss, brocili in place of cauliflower, & croutons in place of corn flakes. Cooking time was fine but I cut the potatoes approx 1/8 inch thick.

Cheese Sauce was awesome!  Easy and tasty.   Califlour and potato needed a little more time to cook, next time I will boil briefly before adding to the casserole.  A great winter all in one dish great for my picky little eaters.

This was just ok. I used leftover spiral honey ham and thought it might be better if it didn't have the sweet flavor. I liked the sauce but if I try this again I think i will mix everything together instead of layering it. I didn't use cauliflower.

This is going on top of my list of favorite casseroles.  It was absolutely delicious and easy to make.  The only change I made was to use crushed ritz crackers instead of corn flakes, and to leave out the cauliflower.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used 3/4 cup montery jack cheese, and 1/2 cup asiago which created a tangy flavor to the potato.  I also added 1 tsp.white pepper and 1 tsp garlic powder to give it a kick.  Sampling the cheese sauce itself was almost enough for me.  Try topping it with Frenches fried onions.

This was really good.  Only made a couple of changes, which was to omit the onion (personal preference), to divide the cheese sauce into two portions, one of which I poured over just the potato layer, and the other I poured over the top as per the recipe, and I used breadcrumbs instead of corn flakes.  Was a little on the salty side due to the ham, so next time wont add any additional salt, but was tasty and will make again.

This is excellent!  I forgot to put the cauliflower in though...oops!  Still wonderful!  Even my 2 year old son who hates potatoes and hates cheese of any kind, begged for seconds!  It will definitely be a regular dish in our house.  Though I did find the cooking time to be very inaccurate.  I cooked it for an hour and a half and the potatoes were still not 100% cooked.

I think I'd have to say I'm giving it a rating better than I might give it if I didn't take into account the 3 other people who enjoyed the dish with me.  It was a great combination of sweet and salty, but the 1/2 cup of butter was way too strong.  All I could taste was the butter.  However, my guests loved it, so it could just be my overly infused taste buds!  Will try again!

Tasted good.  Could have used a little more flavor though.  I should have added some mushrooms to the recipe.  Think that would have helped.

I took this casserole to a dinner party and everyone loved it. I was a little nervous about it because I've tried other casseroles in the past and I don't always seem to get them right but this one turned out perfect. I didn't have any cornflakes so I left them off and it was still really nice. I would recommend adding some different seasonings to the cheese sauce just to make it more exciting. And even better --- the leftovers are great for breakfast, scrambled up with some eggs!

This recipe was delicious and reminiscent of a casserole my Grandma used to make. Big hit w/ the guys, but with the girls it was pretty rich. It keeps well, and I've had it for lunch for a week in small amounts. Don't even try it w/out ham! It loses all the flavor. Also, needed extra salt and some oregano to lift the swiss flavor. Will make this again!

Delicious - this was a hit with my family.  I especially liked that it baked in the amount of time the recipe said. (I've always had trouble with other recipes with the potatoes not being done.)

I made a few adjustments and it turned out very tasty!  I did double the cheese sauce which was a little more than I needed.  I added 4 minced garlic gloves and a pinch of white pepper to the sauce as others had stated it lacked a little spice.  I used fresh cauliflower that I cooked for a couple minutes first.  Lastly, I crushed up some garlic cheese croutons for the top.  Yummmy!

This was delicious but I only gave it 4 stars because of the cooking time. It took almost 2 hours for the potatoes to get soft enough (and even then a few in the middle were a little hard). I made this for dinner, and we couldn't wait any longer to eat. I used a blend of cream cheese, ricotta and mozzarella, because that's what I had on hand. After all the waiting though, it was very tasty. Maybe next time I need to use a bigger pan so that the potatoes can spread out more.

It was awful.  It said to put the cheese sauce on top.  I did that and  that is were it stayed.  It was awful.  Had to toss it.  I had company and was so embarrassed.  Thank goodness it was just  a family member.

Used what I had - broccoli instead of cauliflower; 4 cheese mexican blend cheese instead of Cheddar/Swiss; panko breadcrumbs with olive oil and spices mixed in instead of cornflakes.  Needed more ham and less potatoes and needed more veggies.  My family liked it though and I will make again.

Great Great Great Meal.  Used All different kinds of left over cheeses from the fridge to make the cheese sauce.  We used fresh Cauliflower instead of frozen, and DIDN'T pre-steam it. Did have to cook for an extra 30mins because we doubled the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except I slightly increased the milk and cheese to make sure there was enough sauce.  I didn't put any ham in it.  This was worthy of the name "best".  We all loved it!

This was a yummy recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I thought Swiss cheese was too potent and used shredded cheddar cheese, which I already had on hand.  I also had some leftover beef summer sausage from Christmas that I used instead of ham.  I think most meats would work.

Love the taste, but I will change a few things for next time.  I will dice the potatoes instead of slicing them(make it easier for the kids and us to eat!)  I will also double the sauce and make it cheesier(it doesn't seem to be enought sauce, especially when it is reheated for leftovers!) and I will also tack on 20 minutes of cooking time, as the potatoes were not done by following the times given(my oven even runs hot!)  I did substitute half whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour and also added 2 tablespoons of soy flour for protein(which worked out wonderfully).  Once the potatoes were done, it was a yummy meal!  My family wasn't too happy about the extra wait time though....

It's just ok. If I were to ever make it again I would omit the onions and make a richer cheese sauce.

Definatley comfort food! I used fresh cauliflower and small potatoes and the cooking time was about 15 minutes less. Next time instead of ham I'll try broccoli for the veggies in the family. So good, but this makes more like five or six servings in my house not the 10 that the recipe claims.

I adapted this recipe to use small red potatoes, red onion, margarine, skim milk, and fat free cheddar cheese. It cut out about 100 calories, 90 fat calories, and 6 saturated fat. However I used less ham as 4oz looked to be enough when mixed in with everything else. My husband and I both enjoyed this and will try again but with more cheese, seasoning, and cauliflower. This was filling enough to eat just for dinner.

Awesome. Cooked fresh onion and garlic into the cheese sauce and added a pinch of cayenne as per suggestion.  Also used fresh broccoli. Didn't even need the topping!  Works even when scaling down.

I loved this dish!  I used broccoli, cheddar cheese,  sliced deli chicken, and French onions as substitutes.  I used Yukon gold potatoes as well.  It was very tasty, and I'll definitely make it again!  I didn't have a problem with the potatoes not cooking in an hour.  The cheese sauce was delicious.  I could see using that part of the recipie for other dishes. Everything came out perfect!

I loved the base of this recipe, but I did do a few things to cater to what I wanted and the previous reviews.  I put the potatoes, onion, ham (doubled the amount), caulifower, fresh sliced mushrooms (I added) and 1/2 cup diced celery (I added) in a large bowl.  When I made the cheese sauce, I let the flour cook for a minute before adding the milk, added a little cayenne, dried mustard and increased pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  I increased the milk by a half a cup, used 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.  After it was all mixed, I poured it over all the food in the big bowl and stirred it to get it all covered.  I then baked it and put my cornflakes on top as directed.  I doubled this, and I am glad, and froze it.  My husband loved it.

I tweeked things here and there. I made a smaller portion-less potatoes-with the same amount of cheese sauce. I baked it for 1.5 hours and it came out great. Very tasty!!

Not so hot.  Made as directed.  Could have used more ham less potatoes and would have benefited from something to color it up, brocolli, perhaps some peppers.  Edible.
