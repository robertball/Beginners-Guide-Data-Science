These are good.  I added coconut, omitted nuts.  Also subbed 1 cup brown sugar for 1 c. of white.  They are very chewy, moist, etc.  I found cooking time needed to be extended several minutes.  I baked ~8 min. bottom shelf and 8 min. top shelf.  Mine weren't dry at all.  Next time I would add more cinnamon, more raisins.  Also, I got 4 dozen good sized cookies.  Can't imagine how large they'd have to be to get only 3 dozen, they filled the cookie sheet as it was.  Will make again.  I have toddlers, hence omitting the nuts and I like the fact they are getting some fiber/nutrition (raisins, oatmeal).  They were a hit with the kids!

I am making these right now, waiting for the second batch to come out of the oven! The aroma of these cookies is wonderful, as I'm Baking them, all you hear is, mom, are they done yet? I am not an oatmeal fan like my husband and sons but now I am, the taste isn't too sweet and they turn out great. I was out of walnuts and added coconut instead, just wonderful, thanks for this great recipes, my cookie jar will always be full until hubby and kids get to it!

Absolutely delicious! Crisp and chewy, and a great combination of flavors. I threw in 1/4 cup ground flax as a sub. for 1/4 cup of oats, and toasted the walnuts before adding.

My boyfriend's father happens to love oatmeal cookies, so I got this recipe off this site and whipped up a batch. Once he ate them, he told my boyfriend that he had to marry me because my cookies were "astronmical". THANKS!

Just made these cookies with no nuts or raisins and substituting honey for molasses. They were delicious and very chewy - almost fell apart when I picked them up because the were so soft.

I thought the flavor was good, but the cookies were dry - even when I reduced the cooking time.  My husband and children liked them even so.

I am not much of a cook, but everyone raves over these cookies every time I make them!  I substitute extra raisons and chocolate instead of the nuts.  These cookies are among my favorites in the world!

Absolutely delicious. Used 1 c. of margarine as I didn't have any butter left, cut the sugar down to 11/2 c. (and the cookies were still sweet!) and cut the oatmeal down to a little over 1 cup. I didn't have any walnuts and was out of chocolate chips so I basically made oatmeal raisin cookies, but man, these will be made again!
