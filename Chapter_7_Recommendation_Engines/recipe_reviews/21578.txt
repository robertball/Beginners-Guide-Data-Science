While this is good and pretty refreshing, I didn't need a "recipe" for it and it's not really new.  I made it because of the raspberry sherbet & thought it would be different.  But I got one of those raspberry/lime/orange combo's and also tried it with the other two flavors of sherbet.  All of them really tasted about the same - it basically tasted like the Sprite I used.  Years ago (before I cut back to drinking very little soda), I used to pour 7up over orange sherbet in a mug.  This tastes pretty much the same.  For those who need to worry about how many servings this really makes, this will not fit into 10 8-oz glasses.  If you divide it down, that's just short of 7 oz liquid and bit over 3/4 c. sherbet per glass.  And that doesn't even come close to fitting an 8 oz. glass.  This will fit more like 16 8-oz glasses, or 8 16-oz glasses since a big glass makes a nicer float.  (Approximately.)

I used raspberry and lime sherbet in the floats. Really tasty and pretty as well.

I used Fresca soda. Absolutely delicious. All four of us fell in love with it.

8.18  I used Blue BellÂ® lemon-lime-strawberry sherbet and diet lemon-lime soda.  I put my glass in the freezer last night, but as soon as it hit the Florida humidity, it defrosted, not that that really matters that much, the glass still was chilled.  This was sweet and refreshing, and I can see this really hitting the spot on a hot summer day!
