Oh yum!  Since others said the recipe made a lot of frosting, I took the that part of the recipe and followed the amounts used for 8 servings.  This works out to be 5 ounces cream cheese, 1/3 cup butter, 2 t. each lime peel and juice, and 3 1/3 cups powdered sugar.  That was still plenty of frosting, and we thought the flavors were just perfect!  Thanks, Tori for a fantastic recipe!

This cake is yummy and I plan to make it again for this year's Cinco de Mayo party at our office.  I only wish that people wouldn't give recipes bad ratings when they change the ingredients.  The overall ratings are then skewed.

I tried this recipe with cupcakes.  I think with a little tweeking, they could be good but I ended up over baking them.  I'll definitely try them again and start testing them at about 20 minutes.  The icing was too thin for piping though.  I tried adding more sugar which helped some but it just never seemed to get thick enough to actually pipe.

I made this as cupcakes and went by the recipe just as written.  I couldn't find the frozen Bacardi mix so I used 10 oz of Jose Cuervo Margarita Mix from a bottle we had and it worked just as well.  The cupcakes only took about 15 minutes to bake.  I also thought the frosting was wonderful and had just enough for the cupcakes (I don't skimp on frosting).  I think using real lime zest and juice and real lemon zest make the taste so great.  Everyone who ate them said they were the best cupcakes they ever had.  Will definitely be making these again.

I got raves for these cupcakes.  I used zero calorie margarita mix by Baja Bob and replaced the oil with equal amounts of no sugar added apple sauce.  I made my own low calorie cream cheese frosting and added a little margarita mix to it.  I did not use any lime juice or lemon juice .  They were awesome, making them again tonight!  Not everyone at work got to try them others had 3 or 4 cupcakes them self.

This cake is delicious!! I had so many rave reviews, super moist! If I had any complaints, it would be because of the moistness it fell apart easily, but who cares when its the taste that matters, and this recipe definitely did not dissapoint!

I tried this recipe the other night and they were fabulous!  I substituted applesauce for the oil and put 2 oz of tequila in the cupcake batter.  I also but a little of the Bacardi mix in the icing.  Will definitely be making again and again!

Flavorful, moist cupcakes.  Great dessert to finish off a mexican dinner.  This recipe did yield me 24 cupcakes, not 12 as listed in the recipe.  I made no changes, and have actually used the frosting for other cakes....it's very good!

One of the few recipes where I followed the directions and it turned out perfectly.  Others said it made too much icing, but I used a large or extra large 1m Wilton tip on cupcakes and had just enough.  Follow he directions and you will not be disapointed.  I couldn't find the frozen mix but bought a mix that already contained the tequilla and skipped the thawing stage and it worked out perfectly.  I garnished each cupcake with a lime wedge and sugar crystals and bendy straw.  It was too cute!  Thanks for an amazing recipe!  The taste was light but it was there, not overpowering.

I made this recipe for Cinco De Mayo and it was such a hit that I have had it requested several times but only made it once more.  The icing is more than enough for one cake so I made sugar cookies and used the KeyLime icing as decorations for the cake.  I definetly give this recipe 2 thumbs up!

Most awsome cupcake I have made in a year. So glad I gave it a try. Daughter was empressed with the moist cake, before I added the Cuervo via injetor. I made two kinds for my Birthday a doz. with tequila and a doz. without for non-drinkers. 
I went a little out on a limb with the tequila ones and added salt on top with a wedge of lime as garnish and just green sugar for the non alcoholic ones ,I had to use grated lime peel in the frosting because I had on lemons. The taste did not suffer. Will make again maybe for the southern round-up.

Fun to make and decorate, and fun to eat too. Tart and sweet both, and very tropical, citrusy tasting.  I was a little non-believing about the small amount of oil, especially with no egg yolks in the batter, but it worked.  I backed off to four cups with the powdered sugar and I was happy with that. Creative and a sure "conversation cupcake."

absolutely PERFECT! I made cupcakes with the recipe and didn't change a thing. I did beat the eggs whites separately and then add to the batter. I made a lime butter cream frosting because they were for an outdoor party and I didn't want cream cheese in the sun. The lime buttercream was delicious with this cake. Unfortunately, I don't measure, but I did use 2 sticks of butter, 2 tsp vanilla, the juice of two limes and then added powdered sugar until I got the taste and consistency I wanted. I added a little green food color and used crystalized sugar around the edge to give it a 'salted margarita" look and added a small wedge of fresh lime. They were a huge hit!

Yum! Very moist cake! If you are making cupcakes, bake the day of use because they will pull away from wrappers. Frosting is incredible!

The cake was fluffy and moist, but it didn't have the "bite" of margarita, which I found disappointing. Not sure what to add to give it that...these were just citrus cupcakes in my mind. However, my husband asked for them again after he polished off the first batch, so it gets four stars instead of three. Edit: I just remade these and added tequila to the frosting. MUCH better...now they actually taste like a margarita.

Awesome! It does have a strong citrus flavor but for the summer time and the mexican themed dinner I was having it was perfect.  The frosting was the best part. Yum

Very yummy recipe.  I only gave it 4-stars because I could not find the frozen margarita mix.  After 4 stores I gave up and used a can of limeade.  Took these to our Girls Night Out dinner and they loved them.  I made them in my little muffin tins and got 65 cupcakes from 1 batch.  The frosting was great.  I added liquid margarita mix instead of the lime juice.  I have about  1 1/4 cups of frosting leftover.  It will taste great on graham crackers.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Tori Belle.  The waiter and waitresses liked the cupcakes too.

I just made this recipe (cupcakes) for the first time and I WILL be making it again several times this summer!  The cupcakes were to die for and so easy to make pretty. I attached a picture.  They looked and tasted gourmet and everyone loved them! My only thing was, the recipe did not make 24 cupcakes.  I only got 18 and I didn't overfill them.  Next time, I will double the recipe. Also, the cream cheese frosting is delicious, however, they shouldn't call it "key lime" since key lime juice (which is different from regular lime) is not used. For decoration, I used a thin, half slice of lime, a pinch of coconut and lime colored sugar sprinkles on top. Beautiful if I do say so myself!

SO GOOD! I really loved the flavors in both the cake and the frosting. I didn't change a thing besides making them into cupcakes and they went over really well with everyone. Decorated with Nerds candies (colorful & a little sour) and lemon zest. Thanks!

Great party pleaser.  Too much icing though - very sweet.  But over all a winner, and will use again.

I just finished making these cupcakes for a Mexican theme party tonight and I had to give one a try first.  OMG, they are fabulous!  I followed the recipe except I used tequila in place of lime juice in the cake batter.  I also used tequila in the frosting.  Is was the perfect consistency and amount of frosting for 24 cupcakes.  Everything is so delicious I can hardly wait to take them for everyone to enjoy.  Thanks, Tori, for a great recipe.  :D

Great frosting! The cake consistency was a little "off" from the margarita mix...and a little too tart. I think just the lime zest and juice would be lovely. I also agree with others, it needs the tequila to taste like a margarita...otherwise it's just citrus cake.

OMG! We couldn't stay out of these. My husband even loved them and he isn't a big sweet eater! I will definitely make them again.

This rating is just for the frosting. This frosting is AMAZING!!! I put it on a lemon cake a while ago and it was a fabulous lemon-lime mix. I froze the extra frosting and it still had the smooth texture--I halved the frosting recipe and integrated that into my stored portion with amazing results! This frosting is not too sweet; it's a wonderful mix of tangy and sweet. It is my go-to frosting now for vanilla or non-chocolate cakes. Thank you so much for sharing it!

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday since he loves margaritas. Turned out great! I couldn't find any frozen margarita mix, so I just used a blend of some pre-made mix with alcohol in it and frozen limeade concentrate. No problems with consistency of cake or frosting. I made cupcakes and there was extra frosting left over, but I still wouldn't change the amounts since I don't need a chunk of left over cream cheese sitting around. I topped with decorator sugar to look like salt and a small lime wedge. Super cute and tasty!

Perhaps I should not have refrigerated so long prior to serving, so I will not give it the 1 star that I feel mine was worth.  The cake was dry and crumbly and the icing seemed like a separate item to the cake.  I wanted it to be chilled and refreshing - if I try it again I will not refrigerate prior to serving.

Well, we'll see how it goes over at the office tomorrow.  I found it to be really sweet, really rich.  The frosting is amazing, though!!  I added a little green food coloring.   I also put it in an 8X8 pan to make a little cake and 6 cupcakes.  The cake really sunk in the middle....maybe I just divided the batter into the wrong sizes. I guess if you like margaritas, you'll like this!

I used limeade concentrate instead of margarita mix, and maybe that ruined it. It was soooo sweet I couldn't eat more than a bite.

Made this for a Cinco de Mayo party at work - very good and enjoyed by all. There seemed to be a lot of frosting, but I made it in a 9x13 pan and kept it in this for serving, so this may be the reason.

Really good and I just used MOSTLY what I had on hand so people don't get upset that we rate with tweaks people need to know they can replace ingredients and I find most suggestions helpful.  SO I didn't have lime so I used sweat & sour and some triple sec!  I didn't make the frosting just because but I did add a little bit of sour green candy just to make it look more festive and it really worked.

I made this cupcake, along with another cupcake, for a party.  This cupcake, sadly, did not get eaten until AFTER the other kind of cupcake was devoured.  The other cupcake was chocolate, though, and I think folks just prefer chocolate cupcakes.  I liked this cupcake; it just doesn't appeal to as many people as other kinds of cupcakes.  I increased the margarita mix, added lemon pudding to the batter, and decreased the sugar in the frosting.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Disappointing.  These were nothing like what I had imagined.  I added 3 T. of tequila, which made the frosting very runny.  I don't know what I did wrong, but won't be making these again....

family liked these. I could not get frozen margarita mix so I just used 10 oz of premade liquid margarita mixer and it worked fine. I did not use the booze in the frosting so hubby thought they just tasted like citrus cupcakes though we did like them. I didn't use the booze in the frosting at first with kids eating them...but later added 1tb of tequila to the half batch and it was better.more like a margarita.

made only half recipe of icing.  made 12 cup cakes and 3 mini loaf cakes from recipe.  after icing I sprinkled with kosher salt on the icing.  as icing was very sweet I believe I'll cut back on confection sugar to 1 3/4 cup for half recipe.  I noticed that the cake mix calls for a 18.25 oz box mix ..please note that only 15.25 oz box of cake mix are now available.  I added 2 oz of flour to make up the difference.

I made 12 cupcakes with this recipe but they needed to bake about 30 - 35 minutes which is the same time as quoted for 9 x 13 cake...found that odd.  I may make again.

Made them as is, took them to a party, and they did not go over well. They were very heavy in texture and over the top sweet. I won't be making them again. Sorry!

Made this for my sister's "Beach Theme" bridal shower. We didn't change a single thing from the recipe. I actually doubled the cake batter and made in two sizes of springform pans so I could make a layer cake. We used one batch of frosting and dyed it blue like the ocean. I got SO many compliments on the cake - on how it fit the theme, on how great it tasted and looked. Even my husband wants me to remake this. I used the frozen Bacardi Daiquiri mix (same as margarita, since the difference is the kind of alcohol). I will definitely make again - this was a huge hit!

I made this cake into cupcakes for a Cinco De Mayo party at work. I could not find Bacardi frozen mix so I used just a margarita mix and it worked perfectly . I also took the time and filled each cupcake with key lime pie filling after they completely cooled. They were an absolute hit!

Taste of cake/cupcakes/frosting very good. Very disappointed with the presentation of the cake/cupcakes they both fell in the middle every time I made them. Yes I used a fresh cake mix . That is a must. And no I did not change the ingredients.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Not sure what to it yet because I haven’t tasted it yet. BUT, where do you buy an 18.25 iz box if cake mix???  All of them are 15.25 oz. 

Also, I’m pretty sure because of the  size issue, therevwas way too much liquid from tge whole can if margarita mix ... the cake had to cook longer in order to cook all the way and the middlenof both layers is depressed. 

I really think something is wrong with this recipe.

What an awesome cake! If you want to bring a cake that will get the rave, this is it! I did a two layer cake and had the perfect amount of icing. I did add one drop of food coloring and some lime zest to the frosting for affect. Will make again!

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and almost everyone loved it! The one person who didn’t was a friend who doesn’t like lemon at all. But my husband still liked it even though he’s not the biggest lemon/lime fan either. This cake is very moist, which people love, and my husband said “Wow, Honey, you really know how to make good icing!” And all I did was follow the recipe; I didn’t make any changes to it.

This recipe is absolutely incredible!  I have made this for parties, get togethers,  and a Mexican  themed dinner party I had.  Hands down, EVERYONE loves these cupcakes!  I add 3 shots of tequila to the frosting,  sprinkle lightly with Kosher salt,  and garnish with a small slice of lime.   I don't bake them as long as suggested.   I start checking at about 15 minutes.  You will have extra icing that is really good on sugar cookies! Great recipe!

I didn't get a chance to taste this cake but my daughter (I made this for her birthday), who doesn't do cake, said she wanted it again.

Most people raved about the frosting on this cupcake more than the cake itself.  I added a bit of tequila and extra lemon zest, but only made half the recipe which was plenty to frost the 2 dozen cupcakes this made.

YUMMY!!!  I made this recipe with only one change - added 2 Tblsp. tequila to the batter.  Also added tequila to the icing, as suggested by Tori Belle.  AMAZING flavor!  I do have to agree that the icing is uber-sweet (too sweet for my taste), so next time, I will most likely add more cream cheese and less powdered sugar.  But there WILL be a "next time!"  Very tasty and a fun treat on the right occasion!  Thank you, Tori Belle!

Awesome flavor, cake and frosting. I made this for Cinco De Mayo and took to the office.  I followed the recipe as written.  I was not sure what they topped the cup cake with, sugar or salt.  I was not able to find sugar crystals so I used Margarita salt, just a pinch.  It made me nervous so I only topped it to half of them.  The taste was not bad, but I would not put salt on it again.  You should also add the topping the day of.  I made them the night before and the salt crystals did not show up as much.  There was a lot of frosting, but I was glad since I piped it on the cupcake.  I will be making these again.

Another hit with the fam. I know I need to work on my icing skills but the cake tastes just like a Margarita. I added a little Cuervo silver to both batter and butter creme icing. The cake is really light and fluffy which adds that classic 'Rita taste.

Absolutely yummy! Must try this receipe. When making this receipe into cupcakes make sure you adjust your cooking time. my cupcakes only took 12 mins at 350 to cook.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes and followed the recipe exactly as written (except for modifying the baking time for cupcakes.) As some other reviewers have said, the cake texture was very crumbly. In fact it was so bad, even once cooled, the cupcakes couldn't even be taken out of the pan without completely falling apart. There's no way they could have been frosted.

I made the cupcakes and they were a hit at Mexican Potluck at the office.  In Canada I was only able to find a 250 mL (1 Cup) Bacardi Frozen Mix.  Used that and no other changes to the recipe.  I doubled it and made 36 cupcakes.  LOTS of frosting but I spread with a spatula.  It was so yummy, piping it on would have been a better idea.  I garnished with very thin slices of lime right before serving.  Watch the time as they were a bit too brown on the bottom after 18 minutes.

Lovely blend of flavors, neither frosty or cake is too overwhelming. The citrus zest is purely perfect for this lime lover.

I made these for a New Years Eve party so I added 3 shots of tequila to the frosting. AMAZING! I can't wait to make these again. The cake was so moist and flavorful and the tequila in the frosting made it taste just like a margarita. I did have about twice as much frosting as I needed to frost the 16 cupcakes it made.

Made this for a summer party; cake is moist, nice uniform & dense crumb, and tasty with the lime flavor; overall a fabulous easy recipe.  The glaze is lovely too, BUT it overpowers the lovely flavor of the cake itself.  I also added a full TBSP of tequilla which may have a bit to do with the overpowering nature of the glaze!  LoL... I would highly recommend this recipe, but would switch out the glaze for a much lighter version (no cream cheese, just a simple light glaze, or even just a light dusting of plain old powdered sugar!)

Made this for Cinco de Mayo.  I made cupcakes instead (made 17) and they turned out great.  Others were correct....it made a lot of icing. I think you could just use 4 cups of powdered sugar and it would be plenty.  The only modificiations I made were to add 3 Tbs of lime juice to the icing instead of just 1, and to add a drop of green food coloring to the icing. Oh, and I candied some lime to put on top. They were really good!

I have made these a few times and people love them.  I usually half the frosting recipe and use mini cupcakes.  I inject them with a bit of tequila before I frost for an extra hint of margarita goodness.  They bake really quick and don't turn brown just have to watch carefully.

I made this for a gathering tonight and it was very well received.  I used lemon zest from a bottle, which was fine for the cake, but not a good idea for the icing as it gave it a slightly strange texture, so in the future I would make my own zest.  When I was about to add the egg whites, it seemed strange to just pour them in, so I beat them first, somewhere between frothy and soft peaks.  This gave the cake an almost angelfood texture that was very good. Excellent recipe and fun to make.

Everyone but me loved this cake.  I made it into cupcakes  exactly as written and they were perfectly done in 18 minutes.  I added extra lemon zest to the frosting because you can never have too much lemon.  My only complaint was the texture of the cake.  It was just "off", kinda gummy even though fully baked.  But no one but me seemed to notice.  So 3 stars from me and 5 stars from everyone else.

Made this recipe today as cupcakes, they are delicious!  I added 2 oz of tequila to the frosting so I had to add about 2 more cups of powdered sugar but I think the tequila made them true margarita cupcakes.  Definitely will make these again.  I added sugar crystals, lime slice and a straw to decorate them, very cute and great taste!

Wow. Wow..Wow.. These are absolutely amazing.. the zest really sets it off.. I did use Key Lime Juice instead of regular Lime juice.
