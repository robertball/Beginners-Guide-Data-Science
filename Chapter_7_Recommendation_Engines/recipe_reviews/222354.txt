Prepared this precisely as written, except that I couldn't find my Indian chili powder and had to substitute cayenne.  We think it has at least as good an Indian flavor/savor as anything you'll find on most Indian restaurant menus. (Just needs a pinch of salt.) The method for preparing the corn is unique so far as I know, and really adds to the dish. The only drawback is that fresh curry leaves aren't readily available, and they add noticeably. One word of caution:  if a corn kernel becomes detached, it becomes a little bomb waiting to fire hot oil all over the place.  Cook this outdoors if possible.

This was absolutely delicious! The sauce tastes great with corn. It was pretty easy to make and very tasty!
