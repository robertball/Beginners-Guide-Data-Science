This was excellent. I did follow some other reviewer suggestions, though: I used much less oil - not quite a 1/4 of a cup, I coated the beef in seasoned (cumin, pepper, cayenne pepper) flour, and I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. As with most sauces/stews, it's even better the next day.

Works well with the Indian Basmati Rice on this site, and would probably be good over noodles as well.

I'm giving this only 4 stars because I used the recipe only as a base, adding variations suggested by other reviewers.  I used leftover grilled lamb kebabs from Easter, which were already well spiced with cumin and coriander.  To that base I added canned tomato and chickpeas, as suggested by others, plus the rest of the recipe ingredients.  It made a great stew that was wonderful over the basmati rice and was not too spicy for the kids (I added harisa to mine to pump up the heat!).  Thanks for a good recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for making it great!

Excellent - I made a couple of small adjustments.

I am trying to cut down on oil, so I used just a short pour of oil(worked fine, you don't need it to cook the onions and the fat from the meat is more than plenty to add the richness)

I dredged the meat in flour before browning it to give it a bit more caramelizing (and because it helps the meat to hold it's juice, it is every bit as tender). 

I added Chick Peas. I added a bit of the chickpea liquid as I went on because the sauce was getting a bit cooked down, and it helped both with making more of a sauce, but also the starch thickened it nicely.

I think both the Cilantro and Spinach could be substitutes with any non-sweet leafy green - I like the bitter green in things like this, but I am sure others prefer the less assertive spinach.

Good flavors but it came out too watery...I recommend to cut down on the water just a little bit.

First off, to anyone who might be turned off by all of the oil called for in this recipe, it is DEFINITELY not necessary.  I used about 2 tbsps for the stew and another 2 tbsps for the rice and it came out DELICIOUS!  I love this dish!  Lamb, spinach, cilantro?  How can you go wrong?   Five stars!  Six, if I could because it's also low in fat (if you cut out all the oil which, like I said, isn't necessary).

This was a huge hit! Followed recipe only doubled the spices.  I cooked the lamb mix the night before then next morning put in a crock pot to simmer the day away. Added the spinach and cilantro about half an hour before serving...AMAZING!!

This recipe was very good.  I had to use beef instead of lamb because I couldn't find it at the store.  I can't wait to make it with lamb next time.  I'm sure it will be even better.

I thought this was fantastic!  Made it with full oil too.  Great as is, but may try the tomatoes and even potatoes as suggested in other comments for a different taste.  Also, might want to pump up the cayenne as it wasn't very spicy dish at all.

This is a great recipe. I was worried about it being too watery at first so i let it cook  an extra 10 minutes. once it was finished i put the rice on a platter and poured the meat and gravy down the middle making a straight line. i added some cilantro around the side for decoration

I can't remember if gave a review for this recipe. This is a wonderful recipe. The ingredients are staples in my home. The flavors are subtle. I used chicken for this recipe and cook it for the same amount of time. I eyeball the spices everything is in harmony with each other.
I toss in fresh spinach but, frozen spinach goes over just fine too. *chomps licking good*

Pretty good hearty meal.  I added potatos, and it was really very nice.  The spices seemed odd, but complimented the lamb nicely.  The only thing I'd do different next time is add some broth or tomatos, or something with more juice.  It cooked down a little too much for my taste.  I will definately make this again.

Solid.  I didn't have any cilantro, used half the suggested oil and used a cup of water and half a cup of milk.  Ended up adding quite a bit more spice than recommended, and about 2 tbsps of lemon juice.  Also threw in 4 stems of mint.  Everyone liked it, and I'll be making it again.

Very easy and very tasty. I cooked the night before and added the spinach and cilantro the next day. I will suggest to cook the veg for only 5 min so it won't get soggy. I also heat the cumin seed, haharat and pinch of salt in a sauce pan and then add them to the stew with the veggies. It's really a very tasty dish!

Absolutely wonderful. While I was eating it I said, "This tastes like something I'd order at a restaurant!" The modifications I made were to cut the water to 1/2 cup and add 8 oz. of tomato sauce. I also added a dash of poultry seasoning, two dashes of paprika, cornstarch to thicken, a lot of chopped mushrooms, a handful of snowpeas, and a couple handfuls of fresh Italian parsley. I served it not with rice, but with Indian Naan bread (from a recipe on this site) Wowie! Thank you for this gem.

We loved this recipe.  I rarely cook lamb, so it's nice to have a good recipe.  However, like most of the other reviewers, the oil was a problem.  My sisters said, "It's enough oil to kill an Eskimo!"  Next time, I will use just 2T oil to saute the vegetables & meat, then use plain rice rather than fried rice.  That will be 2T rather than 3/4c oil!  We didn't have fresh spinach, so I thawed & drained some frozen spinach & it was fine.  I will use fresh next time.  I think I will also try the seasoned flour coating for the lamb to see how that turns out.

We really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe with two small exceptions. I used a little less oil and I thickened it a little with some cornstarch. Great flavour.

This was nice. It has a very mild flavor and the cayenne (I used red pepper) adds a nice little kick. However,It was not too hot for my one year old. Its a nice balance. I took the advice of other reviewers and floured my meat. It caused the meat to stick a little but it did not burn. Once I added the water it made a wonderful gravy for the meat to simmer in.

Very good. The oil was little much, so I cut back on that, and I used ground beef, of course. Overall it was a very, very nice change from typical dinner fare. Filling and hearty, as well.

This was very good. Rather different for my family, who isn't used to eating lamb, but good. I was skeptical about the spinach addition, but it worked well, the lamb was VERY tender. I served it over rice. I accidentally grabbed parsley instead of cilantro but it was still good!

Decent dish, sub ground beef, pork, or lamb and it's as economical as it is good.

Yes I will indeed make it again. Used ground lamb 2 lbs browned with onions and celery. Added canned tomatoes, three small chopped potatoes and beef broth. To stretch it I added 1.5 cups cooked rice added with the spinach. Used salt, pepper, garlic, cumin and coriander (cause I hate cilantro but love coriander). It was delicious everyone liked it a lot. Thanks!!

I doubled this recipe & used much less oil (about 1/4 c. to saute the onions & none for the rice since I had leftover cooked rice). I had leftover lamb shoulder & shredded it. I left out the cayenne pepper, as many in our family do not like the added heat. This was very tasty. I would definitely make again!

I really liked this recipe. It's a nice break from the typical dinner because the taste is quite different. Next time I make it, I'm going to add more cumin, cayenne, and pepper because I thought it was a little bit bland as-is.
