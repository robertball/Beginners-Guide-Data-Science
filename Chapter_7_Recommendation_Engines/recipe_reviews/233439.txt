mmm, flavorful, moist and very spicy! I did add a bit of extra adobo sauce to the burger mix, and instead of banana peppers, I used some canned mixed hot peppers to the onion mix. I wasn't convinced the spicy and blue cheese would be a hit, but it definitely was great. We cooked these a little rare, and I didn't use quite as much blue cheese. Oh, and made them into 8 patties - they would have been huge otherwise.

We fell in love with these burgers at first bite!.  I used a combination of ground bison and ground mushrooms with an egg white to bind.  Added  the chipotle and blue cheese plus a bit steak seasoning and mesquite seasoning; perfect!  Served some with blue cheese dressing and others with a spicy bbq and we loved them both ways.
