I used a whole can of pineapple juice in this smoothie because that was all I had and I used "lite" strawberry yogurt. Kids thought this was tasty. Thanks.

This is a good, refreshing fruit juice based smoothie.  I used 2 generous tablespoons of crushed pineapple instead of 1/4 cup chunks since that was all I had.
