Years ago. Back when gas stations gave away promotional gifts along with S&H Green or Blue Chip Stamps. One such gas station was giving away recipe packets as their promotional gift. Each packet had five or so recipes. This recipe, or something very similar was included in one of those packets. It quickly became my signature dish.
Unfortunately, I lost the entire recipe box many years ago. I have been looking for this recipe ever since. I am so glad I found it again.
I made the dish exactly as described using sauvignon blanc for the dry white wine and 1/2 pound of fresh white mushrooms.
I don't think this recipe can truely be called Coq Au Vin since the Classic dish is normally prepared with red wine. Call it whatever you want. But TRY IT. It's delicious!

I followed the recipe to a T and didn't turn out as good as I'd hoped. 

Unlike the picture, the bacon is complete soggy due to it simmering in the broth. If you want crunch bacon, I would suggest sprinkling it over the top of the chicken once you've plated the food. 

Additionally, the bacon grease was a bit too much for my personal preference. Both my boyfriend and I thought the chicken was too greasy. I'd pour some of the bacon grease out before browning the chicken. 

Last by not least, the white wine was too prominent for my tastes. 

Despite all this, the flavoring is very good. Going forward I will reduce the bacon grease and wine, and only put the crispy bacon on the chicken once the food is plated.

This dish has tremendous flavor but is easy to make. I did not read the reviews until after I made the recipe but I like the suggestion of holding back the bacon pieces until the end so that they stay crispy, although when I shared this with my husband he said he didn't notice the soggy bacon. The mushrooms added so much to this dish. I also loved the idea of serving this with mashed potatoes, it was a great way to enjoy the sauce.

This recipe was delicious!  I made this for dinner 2/1/16, and I only made some small changes.  After browning the chicken, I removed all but about 2 TBS of the bacon fat; I used fresh herbs from my garden; I didn't need a cup of broth; because I didn't want the chicken to overcook, I removed it when it was done, and allowed the liquid to reduce at that point, before adding the butter and flour; and when the sauce was thickened, I added the chicken back to the pan to stay warm.  I served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This is a definite repeat!  I halved the recipe even though my chicken package had four skinless boneless thighs.  I didn't have mushrooms, and those were optional in the recipe but would be a very nice addition, so next time.  This is easy, delicious, and a winner!  Thank you so much!  EDIT:  If you are using boneless skinless thighs, you will not want to cook the chicken for the time given.  Remove and cover it until the sauce has reduced and then add it back in.  The second time I made this I added mushrooms, and I highly recommend that addition!
