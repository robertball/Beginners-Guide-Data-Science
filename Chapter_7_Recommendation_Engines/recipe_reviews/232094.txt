I liked this and I will make it again. I gave it a four star rating because I thought it was too sweet. Next time I make it I will only add half of the sugar, adding more to taste if needed. I used a mandoline to cut zucchini in julienne strips and other vegetables in thin slices. I made ahead of time and refrigerated it for about 5 hours. I think next time I will only let sit for two hours so zucchini will be firmer. Mine was a little too soft because it was such small strips. With these small adjustments I am sure this will become a family favorite. ( served it as a side to chicken gumbo pot pie, perfect!)

I'm so addicted to zucchini salads. The only change I made with this is to use a Spirooli with the zucchini and red onion. This is quick and easy.
