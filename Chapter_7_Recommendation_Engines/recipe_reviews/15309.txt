These have such a buttery good flavor.  I didn't even have a butter mix, in fact, I had probably the cheapest mix on the market...a yellow cake mix from ALDI'S and they still came out wonderful.  I also had a store brand butterscotch pudding (3.5 oz) so I did remove a tbsp. of the flour.  Just tossed in a combo of choc. chips and M&Ms.  What I loved about this recipe is that the dough is not sticky, and therefore, can be shaped so uniformly.  A great recipe even with cheapo, cheapo ingredients.  A snap to whip up.  In my case,  SUPER-DUPER economical cookie to give to the neighbors.  I would recommend waiting a minute or so before removing from the sheets.

These were the sweetest cookies I have ever made.  Unless you are a butterscotch fanatic, I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

I have made these twice and my family 
loves them. I did not have butterscotch
chips so I used chocolate chips instead.
Very good. I want to try chocolate cake
mix with chocolate pudding for another
time, maybe with peanutbutter chips?

These cookies turned out great.  Just the right taste of butter.  My husband loved them.

Followed the recipe to the T except used white chocolate pudding instead of butterscotch because it's what I had. These cookies are very crumbly and a bit grainy when eating. Not really my cup of tea.

Both my family and I have serious sweet tooths, but even we thought these were much too sweet!  If you make these cookies either eliminate the butterscotch pudding mix or the butterscotch chips.  The two together are just too much.

These were amazing!!  I made them for my boyfriends birthday cookout and they were gone so fast.  Everyone commented on how delicious they were.  I ran out of veggie oil so used butter for 1/4 cup.  I'm making them again this weekend to sell at a dance recital!

This recipe got a lotta love from my co-workers but I thought it a little dense. Of course, I did find out mid-recipe that I didn't have enought oil and substituted melted butter but that should've made it better, right?  I also had to pat them down as soon as the came out of the oven so they wouldn't look like mounds...lol. All in all, they had a good flavor though.

This recipe is great. I don't think I had butter flavor, I just used regular cake mix and it was still amazing. I made these for work one day and everyone loved them!
