Spicy Baked Tofu Haiku: "Tasty tofu treat. Crispy, browned on the outside, that's how I like it!" I marinate and bake tofu once a week and keep cubes of it in the fridge for tossing in my mouth cold, or reheating to top on a lunch salad, or occasionally to serve as an hors d'oeuvres, as I did these, alongside salted seaweed chips and Sriracha mayo dip. This recipe does not indicate to drain and press the moisture from the tofu very well, but I went ahead and did so (paper towel-lined plate, under another paper towel w/ cast iron skillet on top, replacing the soggy paper towels occasionally) to ensure maximum adherence of marinade. I baked mine, as mentioned in cook's notes, for closer to 30 min. to get them even crispier, and I was delighted w/ the texture.

I didn't love this preparation of tofu, it was "ok," just not amazing. I'm glad I tried it out but won't likely make it again. 

I think it would have been better if I had served it with white rice and some of the marinade (thinned) and drizzled on top.

It tastes really good but the sauce is a little too thick.  I made it again and added some water and used it for cold noodles.  It was really good, especially the second day.

much more flavourful cold than fresh out of the oven. I added a dollup of mayo for dipping and it was delicious.

This was okay, more of a 3.5/5. I doubled the cayenne and sprinkled some chopped scallions on top before serving. I can't help but think this would be better stir-fried, because I found this really dry. (But I have never baked tofu before and didn't know to expect it, so I did not dock stars for that.) Overall the flavour was good, but perhaps some tweaking would make it excellent. Thanks for the recipe.
