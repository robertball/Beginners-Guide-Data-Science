This cake is wonderful!!! There are a few changes I made.  I added a teaspoon more of the almond and only put 1 1/2 teaspoons of the vanilla.  Next time I will double the glaze (but not the almonds).  I gave half this cake to my friend and she wants this recipe.  My husband said,"It is
absolutely delicious."  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious cake and very easy to bake!  The hardest part is grounding the almonds.  I used the recommendation of putting in a little bit of granulated sugar to grind up the almonds in a blender so that the ground almonds wouldn't stick together to form a paste.

I also followed the suggestion of using 2.5 teaspoons almond extract & 1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract, giving it a delicious flavor.

I also doubled the glaze amount (doubling the milk, confectioner's sugar, and almond extract, but keeping the same amount of toasted almonds).  The glaze didn't stick to the cake as well, so as I poured the glaze on and it ran off the cake, I scooped the glaze up a few more times and continued to pour it over the cake some more.

I baked it for about 50 minutes and it turned out quite well, but next time I will probably bake it 45 minutes so that it doesn't turn out as dark of a brown.

To toast the almonds for the glaze, I laid out the almonds on a cookie sheet and baked about 6 minutes at 350 degrees.

Great recipe - will definitely make again!!

If I could rate this more than a 5 I would.  Followed directions exactly.  As I was reading reviews, I noticed that some people had problems getting the cake out of the bundt pan.  When ever I use a bundt pan, I spray Baker's Joy which can be found in the baking section of your local grocer.  It is in a can and it is a no-stick spray with flour which you just spray in the pan.  I have never had a problem with sticking or crumbling.  Hope that helps.  Very mosit.  Thank you for the great recipe Judy!!

I used 1/2 cup butter + 1/2 cup apple sauce, and only 1 cup of sugar for the cake, and it turned out moist and heavenly. Thanks!

Supreme.  Some tips:  I ground my almonds with my food chopper... easy.  Increase almond extract to 2 tsp.  1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Use powdered sugar NOT granulated for the glaze.  Double the glaze (not the almonds).  Cut the milk down a bit or increase the sugar.  Bake for about 40 minutes.  Toast the almonds under the broiler for a couple minutes.  Fill center cavity with fresh raspberries and WOW the crowd.

Whew...I'm so glad I rechecked the reviews for this recipe after 50 minutes of baking because the cake looked done. I have a dark bundt pan so that might have been a reason it cooked in less time.  It still was a little dark so 45 minutes seems appropriate.  Good almond flavor, a little crumbly and it's difficult to get it out of the pan so more butter and flour on the bundt pan may be helpful.  The icing is good but I think I'll stick with the confectioner's kind if I make this again.

I made this yesterday and took it into work today.  It was completely gone by 2:00 and two people demanded the recipe.  I used confectioners sugar in the glaze as granulated would be grainy (unless maybe it would be cooked to dissolve it).  The glaze was very runny though, next time I'll probably start with 1-2 Tbsp milk and then add more if needed.  That would probably make the almonds stick better to the cake, as is they just run down the sides with the glaze.  I might try this with pecans or walnuts too.  Yum!

This cake was great. Before turning it out of the pan I poked holes in the bottom and poured some glaze over it that way it soaked throughout the whole cake.

this is a delicious cake.  It is very moist and looks incredible.  The taste is fabulous if you are an almond lover.  It only took my cake about 45 minutes to bake, and next time I would probably poke the cake with a skewer before pouring glaze over.

Wonderful Tasting cake! Pretty also! Because of reading some reviews, I did change the amount of almond extract to 2.5 teas. and vanilla extract to 1.5 teas. GREAT taste! I gave it only 4 stars because I made the frosting exactly as written and it was SO runny. I thew it away and made my own with powdered sugar, milk,  real butter and almond extract - I did double frosting amount. Bake it only 45 min. and came out golden brown and completely done. As for the cake sticking to the pan, I used room temp. (real) butter to grease and then instead of flour (which causes that white powdery look) I dust with white sugar - It makes it brown to a golden lightly crispy surface. Thank You!

I made this cake for our Christmas Eve dinner; I wasn't so keen on trying out a new recipe when we were going to have a guest but when the BEAUTIFUL cake was set on the table and sliced oh-so-cleanly, I was stunned.  This cake had fabulous (or should I say perfect?) flavor & a fluffy, soft, and slightly moist texture.  I was afraid of getting a dry crumbly cake but was pleasantly surprised.  MY MODIFICATIONS: I used margarine in place of butter, only 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar (which was still a lot but tolerable), 2 teaspoons of almond extract, and in the glaze I used confectioners' sugar (and I used a bit more than the recipe called for since it was a bit runny).  I made the cake in the morning and let it sit all day, and it wasn't dry.  It's just as moist and tasty after a night in the fridge.  Oh yeah and MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHECK ON THE CAKE about every 10 minutes after the first 30 minutes.  Mine was cooked to perfection a long time before the recipe claimed it would be done. THANK YOU for this stunning recipe that I'll use over and over again!

This cake made everyone in the family come back for more! It was so good that my picky mother in law took one taste and said that she would no longer be baking or ordering deserts from a local french bakery and would instead place orders with me for this cake! We followed the recipe except instead of adding the ground nuts to the batter we added thinly sliced almonds so the cake had some nuts inside. The only thing I will change next time is the glaze. It tasted great but was sort of granular/crunchy and runny. I think next time we'll use powdered sugar and less milk. Excellent cake!

I’m so pleased with this! It’s dense, fluffy, moist, and overall lovely. Despite what looks like a lot of sugar, it’s not very sweet, and it really does need a glaze, but I didn't use the glaze in the recipe because of the ambiguity about what kind of sugar to use.  I improvised a bit – halved the recipe, used 1 tsp. vanilla and ½ tsp. almond baking emulsion, since that’s what I had (which is, I think, a little weaker than almond extract), added a tablespoon of poppy seeds, and baked it in a loaf pan. I sprayed my loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray instead of following the instructions to grease and flour the pan, and I won’t do that again, haha – definitely grease and flour! For the glaze, I combined 1 cup confectioner’s sugar with 2 tablespoons of beer – sound weird, I know, but it SO works.

I have now made two of these beautiful cakes, and I believe the answer to the glaze is to heat it long enough to dissolve the sugar. That thickens it a bit, and it dries beautifully, glazing the top of the cake nicely with almonds staying in place. To richen it a bit, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup evaporated milk in place of the milk. For a party tomorrow, I will fill the center with sliced strawberries and serve it with whipped cream. Great recipe, thank you!

I made this as a layer cake for my grandparent's 70th anniversary party.  It was fabulous, and will make it into our normal rotation.  One of the best cakes I've ever made, and I make a LOT of cake.  My grandpa, who is pretty short on words, said it was especially good.

Followed the recipe exactly - except as so many had posted - I used 3 tsp of almond extract and checked the cake @ 40 minutes, and took it out of the oven @ 50 minutes. Cake looked beautiful and easily came out of my bundt pan (prepped as suggested). Now... up until this point all is well, and I’m pleased as punch as I’m more of a cook than a baker. On to the icing I go.  The icing (I used powder / icing sugar) calls for wayyyy too much milk. Double the recipe BUT use 2 tsp of milk. I kept re glazing and still couldn’t achieve the nice white contrast shown in the picture. My icing was pale and translucent  (cake was cool so not sure why). In the end, I just sprinkled more almonds on  and it still looked fine, but cooks be warned - pick a better icing recipe!  I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the icing - though the cake on it’s own truly deserves a 5. I will make this cake again - great for meetings / events / bridge etc.

Absolutely delicious. I wouldn't change the recipe one bit. The combination of granulated sugar in the glaze with the toasted almonds was perfect. Definitely start checking for doneness by 45 minutes. 
The best way to grind the almonds is to pulse them in a food processor with a little bit of the flour. Be sure to use pulse, and be sure to use flour so you don't end up with almond butter instead of ground almonds. You can also use a coffee grinder (if you've never used it on coffee) or your blender.
I served this warm with raspberry coulis and an Amaretto hard sauce. Delicious.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated, except for the increase of vanilla and almond extract as stated by other reviewers.  I don't have a bundt pan so I made a 3 tier cake instead.  Frosted the inside with pure raspberry jam (smuckers), and outside with unsweetened whipped cream, toasted almond slivers & fresh raspberries.  Yummy!

I just made this to bring to my boyfriends parents house for Christmas and I'm seriously considering skipping the entire event just to keep this bundt cake to myself.  It is absolutely amazing.  I followed the suggestions to double the almond extract and to use 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and it was just perfect.  It finished cooking in around 50-55 minutes and is just perfect.  This is an amazing recipe.  With that said, go make it!

Since I've discovered this recipe, i've baked this cake thrice in three weeks. My son never liked nut cakes of any kind, till he met this one!! I made a few changes- a third the quantity of sugar and twice the quantity of nuts. Can't get enough! 5 stars for sure!

Great cake!  I baked it for 60 min, maybe could have done 55.  I made my own glaze with just confectioners sugar, a little milk, and more almond extract.  No problem with ground almonds- Trader Joes sells ground almonds along with all the other nuts, etc.

I haven't yet tried this recipe as a bundt cake, but I did use it to make 96 mini-cupcakes which I frosted with chocolate buttercream. Went down a treat at my garden club. I added a bit more extract (I am always upping the extract) and I did double the almond meal because I had bought a lot on sale that I needed to use up. I would say the double almonds made the texture a bit gritty - more like a shortcake than a regular cake, but the taste was excellent. We also ate some of the unfrosted cupcakes in a bowl with "canned in juice" peach slices and heavy cream and that was absolute heaven. I think next time, I will make this recipe specifically to use as a shortcake. The almond flavor is just right with peaches and cream and strawberry season is just around the corner.

Thank you Aaronsmom for posting this amazing recipe!!!!!  I didn't funk up your recipe with substitutions, I just increased the almond extract to 3 tsps for the batter and 1 tsp for the glaze, added another 1/2 cup of almonds to the batter and a little more for the glaze because we love almonds. The cake was moist and the taste was just amazing!!  I have finally found a cake that my whole family loves!!! Thanks again for sharing!!

Loved this cake! My only complaint is the icing, wasn't necessary since the cake was so sweet. Substituted applesauce for oil.

Wow! It had a nice buttery almond taste to it. Did not make the icing, but we served the slices with some coconut pudding, sliced strawberries, and sliced almonds. Very nice texture, not too crumbly as other reviewers have stated. Would make a good addition to a gift platter, sliced up with other breads. Next time I think I will make two loaves as opposed to the bundt cake. 2nd day and it is just as good!

I love this cake!  I do cook the glaze which helps it not be grainy!  I have served it lots of times and everyone always raves about it.  I've been asked for the recipe several times. I love how easy it is, and yet how beautiful it turns out.  If you can find ground almonds, it makes it even easier!

LOVE this cake!!  I just made it the other day, and boy, was I a happy camper!!  The fragrance this cake gives off is to die for!!  I guess it helps that I'm an almond fan.  My co-workers and family were in heaven eating it.  I don't use the glaze given on this recipe, but thank you AaronsMom for sharing this awesome and delicious cake with us.  You guys won't be disappointed!

Wonderful cake! Mine was done in about 45 mins did not come out as dark as I thought it would but it was still very moist. I decreased the milk in the glaze to about 2 tbsps to make it thicker so the almonds wouldn't slide off. Delicious!

I have just enjoyed a slice of this cake! I will cook again. I increased the almond extract over the vanilla in the cake, and liked that very much.  Do not overbake (mine took 42 min.), and do not overmix.  I doubled the glaze, and liked that (poked holes in the top only).  For ground almonds, if using a food processor, do small amounts at a time with a little sugar or flour taken from your recipe.  This absorbs oil and keeps the almonds from going to paste.

I adjusted this recipe slightly - 45 minute bake time was plenty and I poked holes in the bottom and poured some of the glaze (made with confectioner's sugar)on it. The top glazed perfectly with some liquid adjustment. After cooling, I wrapped the cake in plastic wrap and stored it at cooler (not refrigerated) temperatures for 2 days before it was eaten. It kept perfectly -still very moist and with pronounced almond flavor.

Loved this!  I made it for a coworkers birthday and served it with a homemade raspberry sauce (recipe on this site) to mimic an almond shortbread/raspberry thumbprint cookie.  It was very successful and easy to follow.  Beautiful!

I made this glaze to another pound cake recipe and according to my client, the cake and this glaze was fantastic! Another client to my client list.  This client is a Gospel DJ and has offered me free advertisement.  Praise God for good people.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe.  Can't wait to try the cake and the glaze together.

I made this cake for Easter and everyone loved it. I used powdered sugar for the glaze. This is definitely a recipe that I'll make again. So good in fact, that I just printed off two copies of it for my coworkers.

I followed a combination of suggestions.  I decreased white sugar to 1 cup, increased almond extract to 2.5 tsp.  I also attempted to put 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce but neglected to add the applesauce.  I didn't discover that until after I reviewed the recipe with my mom after my family enjoyed this cake.  I thought it was a little dry but adding that applesauce would have cured that!  I baked for 45 minutes and sprinkled the bundt pan with sugar rather than flour to create a crunchy topping.  Excellent cake!

Wonderful, moist, dense texture with intense almond flavor!  Everyone raved about it!  I made the following modifications:  increased almond extract to 3 teaspoons, substitute almond paste for ground almonds, and substitute sour milk/buttermilk for the milk in the cake.  Substituted powdered sugar for white sugar for the glaze.  The cake baked perfectly golden in a standard bundt pan and looked so pretty topped with almonds and glaze.  Absolutely wonderful and this will become a staple in our family!

This cake is delicious.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added more almond extract to the batter.  I did 2 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1 1/2 vanilla.  I have made this twice, and the second time with more almond was much tastier.  Also, the second time I used four mini-loaf pans instead of the bundt pan and baked them for 50 minutes.  They turned out perfect. I poured the glaze over the top of all four loaves on plates and let them soak up the extra on the bottom.  Delicious!

I was looking for a cake recipie for Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I had to make it twice.  Please grease your bundt pan generously with butter first.  My first cake stuck and was ruined, however my kids agreed that it was delicious and that was before the glaze.  I did feel the first was a little dry so here is what I did for the second.  I did not change the cake recipie at all, I hate when people rate a recipie they change first.  The cake only needed about 45 minutes.  When it was removed from the oven I immediately poked holes and poured some glaze on the bottom, while still piping hot.  I unmolded the cake and drizzled remaining glaze over the top and topped with chopped almonds.  I did make a different glaze only because I prefer to use powdered sugar.  You need about a cup and a half of sugar and a couple T of milk.  I also added some almond extract. Yum

I used the chopper attachment on my immersion blender and had no problems grinding the almonds. My daughter likes a heavy almond tasting cake - almost like and almond snowball if you've ever had one in New Orleans - so I put 2 Tablespoons Almond extract and no vanilla. I also brushed the warm cake with Amaretto. She decided this was her favorite cake, and is the recipe she wants me to use for her Sweet 16 party. It does work well in a 11 x 13 pan, but I reduced the time to 45 minutes. The Baker's Joy tip worked perfectly. I think I will use a parchment paper pan liner when I do the one for her party.

Excellent bundt cake!! The almond flavor is right on & the texture is moist! I did not use the glaze, I used the vanilla glaze from this site, making it w/almond extract instead of vanilla & just drizzled it over the top. It made a beautiful presentation w/a taste to match! Definately adjust the cooking time-45 min in my dark bundt pan was enough.

This was a very good cake. It reminded me of some almond thumbprint cookies I make at Christmas. I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site. It was a nice combination. I'll make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't actually use the cake recipe, I had one of my own, I used the glaze part of the recipe, only I doubled it, and added about 1/4 tsp more vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of almond extract, and 1 Tbls of butter. It was fantastic!

I listened to others and cutr the vanilla and incrteased the almond extract. Also I decided since people were having trouble with the glaze to skip it. I dusted the cake with powder sugar, then made a lemon sauce and served it warm over the cake. It was a really big hit. The alomond and lemon flavor was outstanding. It is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I made this with a group of kindergartners and it all went off without a hitch.  We crushed the almonds by putting them in baggies and letting the kids smash them with blocks.  This is a really easy and kid-friendly recipe with an incredible outcome!  The glaze is the best!!

OK- only make this cake if you want everyone that eats it to ask you for the recipe! It is so wonderful that we almost ate it before we got to serve it! It is equally as good with as without the glaze (although the glaze adds a special sweet spot). Try it - you'll love it!

Fantastic recipe!  Very moist, not too dense, very nice crumb.  I substituted sour cream for the milk and I used a little over 2 tsp almond extract.  The cake was done in my convection oven in 55 minutes.  Tasted great with sliced strawberries as a topping.  This recipe is a keeper!

This cake is just wonderfully moist and easy to make.   I saw a lot of comments about grinding up the almonds.   If you have a Trader Joe's by you, they sell "Almond Meal" in the nut aisle which is exactly that -- finely ground almonds.   I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of upping the amount of Almond extract by another teaspoonful.   If you love that flavor anyway???....DO IT!   I also chose to stick with the white sugar (over powdered sugar) in the glaze recipe.   I heated it until the sugar just started to dissolve so it wouldn't be too watery.   Then carefully spooned it on the cake to minimize run off.   It was excellent and I would still do it this way again next time.     Using a silicone bundt pan, it took exactly 60 minutes to bake perfectly and it came out of the pan with ease.   I bought the silicone pan about 5 years ago and would NEVER go back.   Always had sticking issues with my old metal bundt no matter how much I prepped it.

Really yummy almond cake.  Moist and flavorful.  I used 2 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, otherwise didn't change a thing in the cake. Made my on glaze from butter, powdered sugar, milk, almond and vanilla extracts, and a pinch of salt.

Moist and Delicious!  After looking at various almond cake recipes, I did modify this slightly.  I only used 1/2 stick of unsalted butter, 8 oz. plain nonfat greek yogurt, and a brick of 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Also upped the almond extract to 2 tsp.  I didnt grind the almonds, only added slivered to the batter.  For the glaze I combined 1 c. powdered sugar, 2 Tb. milk and a tsp. almond extract.  Drizzled over the cake and then topped with more slivered almonds.  Baked at 350 for about 50 minutes in a bundt pan.  Very yummy!

This is a great cake for those who don't want gobs of thick traditional frosting.  It is moist and full of flavor, but not too sweet.  *This is also great as a coffee-cake type of sweet.  Great with coffee or tea or for a sweet breakfast treat.*  It tasted even better the next day! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 teaspoons almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract to the batter.

This is a wonderful cake--beautiful to look at (golden crust and crusty top). It is a tender, light cake--not at all heavy. The suggested cooking time was too long for me. I used a thermometer to test for doneness and I pulled it from oven at 200 degrees--that was at 50 minutes for my oven--so watch closely and test early.  The glaze didn't sound right--so I used powdered sugar instead of white sugar. It was still too runny so I added more, but I still had to scoop up the runoff and reapply. It still tasted great. As many have suggested, it would make a great shortcake.  I will serve it with whipped cream to the side tonight.

Delicious but VERY sweet. It doesn't take much of this cake to satisfy a sweet tooth. I used a tube pan. I wish I had added more almond extract to my cake batter, though. I like almond pound cake like a certain company's Absolutely Almond Pound Cake Mix...still trying to find the recipe to replicate that boxed mix. Oh and I also added a bit of the flour I measured out to the almonds when I ground them in the food processor. Worked great.

This was a terrific recipe and was just what I was looking for! I made a chocolate glaze to go on top instead of the traditional white glaze....it was heavenly and barely made it 24 hours in my house before the whole cake was consumed!

I made this to go along with the traditional Thanksgiving desserts.  It got rave reviews from those with a more "sophisticated" taste!  I only gave it four stars since the little I had leftover seemed to lose its "moistness" if not eaten up fairly quickly.

Everyone loved this cake when I made it.  To help with the thin glaze, I put it in the fridge while the cake was baking and cooling.  Perfect for big family gatherings and I will definitely make it again.

We cut down the baking time to 50 min. Next time I'll cut down the amount of milk in the glaze because its way too runny. Overall a very good recipe, will make it again.

This cake is so good, and I didn't even make the glaze.  I made this in two loaf pans and made a "tulip garden" cake for my mom for mother's day.  This pound cake was very easy to make- I'm currently in Europe and I bought a bag of ground almonds here for about $.60 which made the recipe even easier.  I want to try the glaze next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

SPECTACULAR CAKE!!!!!  I
ve made it 2 times now and I didn't change a thing about this recipe, except the cooking time.  In my Bundt cake pan this cake is done at 45-50 minutes...and I don't think my oven is "off" by that much.

I substituted Silk vanilla soymilk for the milk in the recipe.  I also substituted 2 1/2 - 3 Tablespoons Silk vanilla soymilk in the glaze and 2 cups of powdered sugar for the granulated sugar.  Good recipe!

Served this tonight for guests, looks very impressive and tastes great - very almondy (is that a word).  I only added in 1/2 a cup of milk as it was at the "right" consistancy for a bundt cake.  Thanks for the recipe, every one loved it, including my non sweet tooth cousin, Karl.

Excellent cake!!  Came out of the pan perfectly and looked so pretty with the toasted almond glaze.  This cake has a fine, tender crumb and a delicious, subtle almond flavor.  Very pound cake-like.  Would be delicious with fresh fruit.  This one goes in the keeper file for sure!

This cake was excellent!  I love the almond flavor - and my husband was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't do the glaze, as we were going to be traveling with the cake, and I didn't want the sticky glaze to get on the seats in my new truck.  It was good even without the glaze - we just needed a big glass of ice cold milk.  I will make this again, and do want to glaze it next time.
Thanks for the recipe, Judy,it is a keeper!

Great cake.  I subbed the vanilla extract for pure vanilla and subbed the almond extract with rose water.  This resulted in an exceptional alcohol free cake.

MMM...YUMMY! I didn't have almond extract so I substituted with vanilla. I turned out great with the perfect cake consistency. Super easy and very delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

great tasting cake, very nice with coffee. however cooking it for 60 -70 min. is way too long. i cooked it for 60 and almost burned it, as a result it dried up a bit. another reviewer had suggested 40 min. that reviewer was right. anyhow i'll definitely make it again because it tasted yummy!

Tried this recipe as well as three other bundt cake recipes which, for a different twist, call for alcohol in the cake mix and in the glaze.  The glazed almond cake is the absolute best one!  It may not be as moist, but it tastes much better than any other cake I've tried.  Will make this cake again!

Cake was great...very disappointed with the glaze.....was clear and did not show on the cake.....first time I did a glaze that called for white sugar not powdered sugar...tried to thicken it up with powdered sugar but still looked nothing like the picture for this recipe....would like a good recipe for a nice glaze.....so simple but hard to find....

As is this recipe is probably 3 1/2 to 4 stars.  With adjustments...delicious! After reading reviews about the dryness I didn't add the ground almonds to the batter.  I added extra almond extract & used almond milk.  I greased my bundt pan with butter & sugar & when done it literally fell out of the pan. USE CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR FOR THE GLAZE! I really "played it by ear" for the glaze & just mixed the sugar, extract, & milk until it got the consistency I liked.  The cake was light, airy, & fluffy. One relative said it melted in your mouth.  I've only made cake from scratch 2 or 3 times in my life & this one is a keeper!  **Oh & as far as for cooking time, 45-50 minutes should be sufficient**

Delicious!!  I have made this a few times.  I am always making treats for my co-workers and this was a hit!  I have even made little mini bunt cakes with blueberry filling in the middle.  Tonight I made this cake but added 1cup frozen blueberries to batter.  Added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.    Baked 1 hour.  I too used confectionary sugar for glaze.  Awesome!

Great, simple cake.  Like many reviewers, I used icing sugar instead of white sugar for the glaze, and also triple the amount of sugar for it.  And like others, I adjusted the amounts of flavour extracts; using 1 1/2 teaspoons of Almond and 1 1/4 teaspoons of Vanilla.  Baking slivered almonds in the oven at 350 F for the topping worked out nicely too.  Next time I'm going to try the fresh raspberries in the middle though :)

Meh...I was somewhat let down after all the rave reviews...A bit dry.  However, as an almond lover, next time I'll cut back on the baking time.  And that glaze recipe was like water.  I'll try adding some cornstarch and more almond extract  I'll also try a gluten free version with rice flour.

I was really disappointed in this cake and you can't be more of an almond fan than I am.  As others said, the bake time was way too long - it was dry and heavy.  The taste was almost bitter - not sure if it was too much almond extract?  It may be better if you reduce the time and make adjustments, but for me it's just not worth trying again..

I really liked this. I made extra glaze and added a bunch of almonds and covered the cake with the glaze so the cake tasted similar to a biscotti or Italian breakfast cookie. I have a convection oven and cooked at a lower temp and took it out early but earlier would have been even better. I definitely would not substitute margarine for butter in this recipe.

As modified below, it was dry but tasty. If I did it again, I'd replace half of the butter with applesauce.  Recipe changes: I ground the almonds with some granulated sugar (to prevent them from turning to paste), used 1 more tsp of almond and 1 tsp less of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup less sugar, and cooked for 50 minutes MAX. Also, the sugar for the glaze should be confectioner's, and the amount of milk for the glaze is WAY off - I used one tbsp only, and it was great. I would suggest doubling the glaze but leaving the slivered almonds as-is. Toast them for 6 minutes at 350, if you bought raw :)

Gorgeous cake! I used half a cup of melted butter and half a cup of applesauce.  I also used almond milk in place of the regular milk and reduced the sugar to 1 and half cups of brown sugar, but if you like a sweeter cake stick with 2 cups.  I substituted half a cup of flour for half a cup of flax meal.  Instead of creaming the butter and sugar I just melted the butter and mixed all the wet ingredients together and then gently stirred the dry ingredients in- like I do when I make muffins and it turned out truly AMAZING! I didn't bother with the glaze just dusted it with powdered sugar. I'll be making this cake again and again and again ..............

I did not care for the texture of the almonds in the cake batter.  I am a huge lover of almond and I was very excited to try this.  I would never make this again. This is not a light airy almond cake.  The almonds in the batter make the cake grainy.

This was excellent! It tastes like my favorite christmas cookies my mom used to make!  Easy, pretty and delicious!  One note I would not call this a glaze in the typical bundt cake fashion, it soaks into the cake making it super lucious!

My 6 year old granddaughter found my fairytale house bundt cake pan and wanted to use it for a Christmas cake.  We used this recipe and the cake came out beautifully. The flavor is wonderful. We just mixed butter, confectioners sugar and half and half together to make a glaze then drizzled it over the cake and added some edible pearls. It was a great Christmas Cake.  Will use the recipe again the only change I made was to use almond flour in place of ground almonds.  Almond flour is just ground almonds so not really a change.

this cake was so good. The batter was so fluffy and light and the cake was so delicious and almondy. For the glaze I didn't even measure any of the ingridients i just did it to taste. The outside of the cake browns while it bakes, but it is still delicous, fluffy and moist on the inside. I think I am going to try this again with vanilla extract, and I will add some berries so i can make a berry bundt cake.

This cake was really good even with my substitutions...I didn't have almonds so I just used almond extract for both the cake & glaze (& not real almonds). For the cake, instead of using vanilla I used almond instead (so it about double almond extract than it called for). I also only had multigrain/wheat flour and not white flour and the cake still worked out really well! The glaze I found really sweet so I added some water and watered it down a bit...maybe next time I would leave out the sugar and just do the almond extract not sure - and I heated my glaze on the stove. It was a good cake and I will definitely make it again. It didn't stick to the pan either and was easy to get out.

This recipe is so good that people always want me to make it for bdays and events. I describe the flavor as "light and delicate" if that makes sense. Perfect. I always add extra almonds for the topping! It makes for a beautiful cake- perfect for mother's day, easter, o any time of year!!

Phenomenal!   A huge hit with everyone that has tasted it.  Even when I ruined the first attempt by not greasing/flouring the bundt pan enough, I just turned it into a trifle by layering cake cubes with whipped cream and berries.  I do poke holes in the bottom right away and pour the glaze into the holes.

This cake is AWESOME!.  My boyfriend asked me to make this cake for his Thanksgiving Brunch he was having at work.  So I decided to first try it at home.  I read the reviews.  Yes..added more almond - and decreased the vanilla by 1/2 tsp.  Was not happy with the glaze recipe that this cake offered so I surfed this site for Vanilla Glaze  - found this one ---  and  - so I used this glaze recipe instead but just added some almond extract.  I did read the reviews on that one as well..so watch the milk - but I'm telling you..it was the best combination.  I have submitted a couple of photos of my cake.  Good Luck and Happy Baking!!! :)

Overall the taste was not bad but I wish I had read the reviews before baking this one. It was very crumbly, stuck to the pan even with the oil and flower, and I fould the recipe to be a bit confusing because it calls for white sugar and doesn't state powdered or granulated. Wont be making this one again.

This was excellent!  I added more almond extract to the cake and glaze and doubled the glaze to have enough to drizzle all over plus pool some in the center of the cake for presentation.

This is one of the best bundt cakes I have ever made. My family went crazy over it. The almond flavoring was perfect! I toasted the almonds before I added them on top of the glaze and it went perfectly with the cake. It was gone in less than a day- and my family is picky when it comes to new recipes.  The only change I made was with the glaze- I used confectioners sugar and not as much milk- added some cornstarch to thicken it up, and heated it until the cake was cool enough to remove from the pan.  Will use this again!

this was absolutely delicious! i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. just one thing; adding the almond glaze will make it pretty sweet; without it, it will be perfect for those who hate sweet things.

A`keeper for sure!!
It's the perfect cake! Moist but not oily.
I cut the sugar to 1 1/2cup coz the glaze is pretty sweet and it's just right on spot for my non-sweet tooth.

Make sure you use powdered sugar in the glazed (i use 70gr confectioner sugar mixed with 1tbs milk, 1tbs lemon juice n almond extract) and it's just the perfect consistency. 

Oh, btw, i check my cake after 40mnts coz the other reviewer said it takes them 40-45mnts, but in my oven it takes 60mnts..so just make sure to poke it with a skewer to test the doneness coz i think every oven are different.

Sorry, this was just ok for us. Followed recipe exactly, had some almond flavor, but other than that was rather bland. Also interestingly enough, although it looked moist, it was a little on the dry side. Won't be making this one again

Amazing.  My family's favorite cake. I bake it in my Pampered Chef Bundt pan and it comes out perfect.  It just falls out of the pan when inverted. Cake is very moist and delicious.

This cake is excellent.  The only changes I would suggest are 40-45min. bake time and powered sugar & a tad less milk for the glaze.  I use a small coffee grinder to grind nuts and that works well.

I'm not a baker at all and I need a breakfast cake in a hurry before my bible study. I logged on and typed in bundt cake and came up with this one. I read three positive reviews and started putting everything together. I started at 08:55. Bible study was  to start at my house at 10:00 am. The cake was done just in time. 10:00. e had our bible study 1st. I cake was just warm to eat. everyone enjoyed it include mother! 

This cake was a hit.

Thank you so much for putting it out there!!

I made this cake in 6 individual Bundt pans.  I baked it for 40 minutes, but I think that was a bit too long.  Very tasty cake though and the flower-shaped Bundt pans made a beautiful presentation.

This cake comes out perfect. I am not an experienced baker and I got many compliments on this cake. It is a good base cake recipe that can be made with many modifications. I made it with 2 tsp lemon extract instead of almond extract and an orange glaze and it was really really great. Will make again.

This cake was delicious but a little dry.  I took it out of the oven in 50 minutes but should have read the other reviews first and taken it out in 45.  The recipe called for "white sugar" in the glaze.  I used granulated sugar, which I think is a mistake.  I should have used confectioner's sugar (aka powdered sugar).  Was I supposed to use confectioner's sugar in the cake as well?

1) I only cooked it 45 minutes and it was completely done, 2) I used 2.5 tsp Almond Extract and 1.5 tsp Vanilla Extract, 3) I adapted the glaze recipe by using 1/2 cup milk, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp Almond Extract, 1/2 cup toasted almonds, and added 4 tablespoons melted butter.

I made this recipe (with a few tweaks) this morning and it was FABULOUS. So buttery and nutty and the perfect cake crumb. First I reduced the sugar in the mix to 1 1/2 cups.  I made half mini Bundts and muffins. On the bottom of the mini Bundt pan I sprinkled some chopped almonds and also sprinkled them on top of the muffins. I baked for 18 minutes on 350 and they are heavenly.

Turn out dry. I think the issue is that only 1 stick of butter, needs 2 sticks or some oil combination.

What happened to the recipe! Two or three weeks ago it was callin for castor sugar and the ingredients were by weight! Was 5 star, now 4.5 +1 star! I was singing the Donna summer song MacArthur Park because I thought it was gone forever!! But I know this one is right because it calls to cream the butter and sugar together and it's three steps including the glaze.  It was immediately a staple recipe in my heart! I have rested every bundt 10 min up, 10 min down since! Please don't get rid of this recipe!

It was very tasty, but as some said, a little dry. I did increase the vanilla and almond extract, and thickened the glaze by adding more powdered sugar. It tasted very good, but I would add some oil or applesauce next time to make it more moist.

This cake is fabulous! The only changes I made was to increase the almond extract to 2 1/2 tsps  and used half and half for the milk. I used confectioners sugar for the glaze . My family loved this cake!

I made this last night. I had  ground almonds I needed to use up.  I opted for more almond extract and used two 9" round cake pans. It turned out beautifully. This cake is excellent and doesn't even need a glaze. It is great with coffee or tea.

Lawd, have mercy!!!! This cake was the worst thing for weight loss!!!! I had to refrain from eating the entire cake by myself!! I'm going to use this recipe for the rest of my life. I added a little more almond extract because I love almond so much. Luv it!!

Delicious! It was incredibly easy to make and everyone loved it! It did come out a little bit darker than in the original picture and the glaze was clear...other than that, perfect!

I made this for my book club and for a potluck, and it was a big hit both times!
Based on other reviews, I made the following changes:
- greased and sugared the bundt pan (instead of flour)
- 1  1/2 C sugar (reduced from 2 C)
- 2  1/2 tsp almond extract (increased from 1  1/2 tsp)
- 1  1/2 tsp vanilla (reduced from 1  2/3)
- began checking cake after 45 min (but usually left it in for 60 min as per recipe)

For glaze:
- doubled the glaze recipe (but not the almonds)
- to toast almonds: place on parchment paper & cookie sheet; toast @ 350 degrees x 6 min
- used icing sugar (instead of white)
- used less milk (2-4 Tbsp total for the doubled recipe)
- haven't actually done this, but liked idea of poking holes in cake so glaze goes in!

I am not a big fan of baking but this cake is  easy to make and delicious. I added a bit more ground almonds and also increased the almond and vanilla extract. I think it pays to buy the best Vanilla extract you can find.
I also changed to baking time down to 50 minutes. You can use this batter to make a 3 dimensional Bunny cakeor for xmas get a Christmas tree pan. Decorate however you wish.

Loved this recipe! My husband thought it was too sweet and wanted me to only use half the recommended amount of sugar. He also didn't like the glaze. Again be said it was too sweet. I likes the cake a lot but I did have problems getting the cake out of the pan. My mother-in-law gave me a new pan, so next time I'll try that

I'm not much of an almond fan, but I decided to make this because I got fresh from the orchard almonds.  It was delicious.  This would be perfect for a brunch or at breakfast with some coffee.  I would say the glaze is a must to keep it sweet.  A very dense cake.

Like other reviewers I added extra tsp almond to the cake batter and felt it could have even used more.  I baked in a nonstick bundt pan for 45 mins and it was definitely done and came out easily.  I followed my own confectionary sugar frosting and wish I had made more to completely frost the cake as it needed it.  This cake was ok, but definitely didn't touch Tastefully Simple's...

This cake was mmmm delicious. I followed directions very carefully and it was wonderful. The only thing, I do agree with others, you have to grease and flour your pan real good. One section of my cake did break, but it was still sooooo good. This is the first made cake I made from scratch, so I'm very happy and proud of myself. My mom was very proud. The color and the shape of the cake was so pretty, and the almond flavor hit the spot. I will and plan on making this cake for the holidays. I even shared it with my friend. Thanks so much.

Very good, I made this for an office party and it was a hit. I used powder sugar in the frosting instead of regular sugar and definitely alot more sugar than milk so it wasnt watery.

I make this cake a few times a month. This has also become an office staple as I get many requests for this. The office will contribute to the "cake kitty fund" for this cake. This is a fantastic, moist and delicious cake for any occasion.

This cake was difficult to remove from the pan.  The sauce should have less milk as it's very runny.  Maybe the vanilla glaze recipe from this site would be better. Finally it is a very crumbly cake.  In all the taste was good but too many other negative factors.  I would not make again. Oh the glaze is confectioners sugar!

I made this to bring to a family gathering.  I left out the ground almonds and sliced almonds because my father can't eat them.  My family memebers liked it, but I thought it tasted to extract-like.

Really moist, even with ingredient changes (soy margarine for butter and soy milk for milk).  I also added a little soy margarine to the glaze for extra buttery flavor.  This would be great with a raspberry sauce, and I'll probably make some sort of topping for it when I bake it again.  Downside is that it's not nearly as soft and moist the second day, even though I baked it late at night.

My husband made me this cake for my birthday and it was fantastic. We loved the almond taste. The only thing he found was that it broke apart a bit when taking it out of the bundt pan and he didn't find that the almonds stuck very easily with the glaze. Next time he wants to try an amaretto glaze that we used on an amaretto cake recipe (submitted by Shawn) on this site.

We love nuts so we love this cake, I did add 1 cup of ground almonds, the only thing I changed other than that I kept everything the same and loved this recipe, thank you so much for sharing this with us.
