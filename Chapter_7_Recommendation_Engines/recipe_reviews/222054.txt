This is a nice black bean salad.  I like that it's not cilantro based and really dig the chili powder.  This would be a great way to repurpose leftover rice!  I plan to use my leftovers (and this makes a lot) to freeze in wraps for quick easy future lunches.  Thanks for the recipe, Chelsea!

Absolutely fantastic,and everybody loved it. For colour, I usually use 2 cans black beans and 1 can red kidney. With the corn, that gives me red, yellow, and black.... sometimes I'll add carrot.

People eat with their eyes!

Tastes really good, but little to oily for me. I only used 1/2 cup but still to much. Next time I'll use 1/3 or a 1/4 & see how it goes

Good base recipe but I made a ton of changes. I needed more vegetables so I added celery, red bell pepper, and a small amount of red onion. I also used cherry tomatoes instead of canned and more corn. I followed the suggestions of others and reduced the oil, and I used lime juice instead of vinegar.  Personal preference:  I reduced the cumin, since Iâ€™m not a huge fan.  Oh yeah, and I used leftover brown rice. A great light main dish summer salad.  It makes a ton, especially with the added vegetables.

Very good!  Will make this again but I think I will add green onions.  I think that will make a really good recipe even better!

Reduce the oil, added kidney beans with the black beans, a small can of kidney beans and chopped some jalapeno peppers for a little kick to it. Everyone ate it up .

Good wholesome recipe with simple instructions. I would recommend using less red wine vinegar and oil than indicated... add in to taste. This is a very nutritious recipe.

Great summer salad. I made it with brown rice and less oil, and fresh herbs.I also sprinkled tortilla chips on top which I highly recommend. I will definitely make this again.

I agree with other reviews; cut back the oil to 1/2 cup or less. I used olive oil instead of canola oil. Added diced green pepper for color and a bit of crunch. This recipe is great for summer bounty; especially with lots of corn available. I usually cook with reconstituted dried beans, so about equal parts bean to corn works well. The chili powder and cumin works really well as a break to the easy cilantro summer salads.

Great recipe, but too much oil. Used 1/4 cup olive oil instead and I love cilantro so I used it instead of oregano. Also, cut down on the vinegar. One could also use wheat berries instead of white rice for better nutritional value.

This was a quick easy dish with high impact!  I added a touch of habenaro sauce and some fresh basil, but really the recipe would be fine without changes!
