I used this recipe for a slightly different dish!  I made the "glaze" - but only used 1/2 tsp. of the dried mustard, added a tbsp of brown sugar, and 1/4 c. apple jelly.  I put this mixture in the slow cooker and added two small packages of diced/fully cooked ham.  Cooked on low for about 3-4 hours and served with cooked broccoli and buttered french bread.  Great for cold weather!!!!  Thanks!

This also serves well as a sauce directly served on the meat.  It is a has a tart flovor with a hint of the horse radish. AWESOME!

Just used ham slices, grilled them, and topped with the sauce. Was very good, a little spicy for me, but my boyfriend loved it!

Wonderful flavors and can also be used on grilled pork chops or chicken - very versatile.

Really simple and flavorful! Loved the way the apricot came thru, and the rest of the flavors melded wonderfully.

I made the glaze w/o the horseradish, only because I didn't have any.  But the rest of the ingredients made a delicious sauce.  I love horseradish and look forward to making the recipe as is next time.
