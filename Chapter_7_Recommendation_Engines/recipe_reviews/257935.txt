We discovered a few things trying to make this. First, you don't want to just cook the agar-agar flakes and chicken stock on low. Instead, bring to a low boil. Otherwise they will not set. Second, we ran out of filling. We would recommend you increase the dough portions by 50%. Drizzling some high-quality balsamic vinegar over the top before serving made them excellent.
