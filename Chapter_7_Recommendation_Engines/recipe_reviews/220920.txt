This dressing is pretty much how I fix my salads every night, though I do use lemon olive oil.  I think my only problem with this is that I would like to have a little more crunch to the salad with the addition of other types of greens and maybe a vegetable or two.  There is a wonderful bite when you roll up a piece of the meat with the perfect amount of arugula!  I would not have thought of this combo before now, but it is something I will do again.  Thank you, Vikil!
