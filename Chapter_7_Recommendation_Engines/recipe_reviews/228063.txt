Made this for New Years and it was delicious !! The only thing I changed was instead of can black eye  peas I used 2 bags of frozen purple hull peas and increased the cook time by two hours ... Delicious will definitely be making these again !!

I left out the bell pepper for my husbands sake and these were still really good. I would have not thought to add butter to black eyed peas but it really made a difference in the overall flavor. I recommend refraining from stirring too often or you will end up with mushy peas. Great flavor and super simple to make!
