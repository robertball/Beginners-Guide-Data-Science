The cake taste wonderful, but be sure to actually grease and flour the bundt pan, using a spray to coat just doesn't work.

This was really easy to make and turned out great!  V. Wilkins is correct in the review... GENEROUSLY grease and flour the pan!  Mine stuck and broke in two as I was turning it out of the pan :(.  Also note in step 1... it instructs to you mix the crushed cookies with the nuts and coconut, but in step 2 you add them separately.  I added them separately.  Very yummy recipe!

My family went crazy over this cake...and, it only took me 10 minutes to throw together.  It is VERY sweet and VERY dense...and VERY yummy.  I frosted mine with a simple cream cheese frosting. Note: you do not need a bundt pan...I made mine in a 10in round cake pan and it worked just fine.

FABULOUS! The picture associated with this image does not do the recipe justice. Mine turned out so much prettier and when I realized I forgot to take a picture it was practically gone. Love it.

Wow! Simple yet just delicious. Very dense and sweet. I didn't frost and I'm glad...would have way too sweet that way. However fresh whipped cream would be perfect. Made for a luncheon and everyone loved it.

WOW is all I can say about this simple but tasty creation!  It all started with a coupon for a free box of vanilla wafers.  I RARELY buy these, but thought, what the heck.  I'll check Allrecipes and find something to do with them.  After checking reviews for this recipe I decided to give it a go.  The package of coconut I bought only came in 7 oz. so I was short 1 oz.  Folks in my house aren't crazy about coconut or nuts, so I ground both up fine in my food processor.  They gave the cake a smoother consistency while still maintaining great flavor.  I took one reviewers advice and GENEROUSLY GREASED AND FLOURED my bundt pan.  I normally use baking spray but another reviewer advised against it for this recipe.  I also took yet another reviewers advice and let the cake cool in the pan about 12 minutes before flipping it out.  PERFECT!!!!!!

First of all the cake is very tasty. The problem was after I generously greased and floured the bundt pan the cake when turned out was stuck to the bottom of the pan. What a mess. Maybe I should have let it COMPLETLY cool before turning it onto a plate. I do not know. The cake was very yummy and I could not stop eating the messy top that was stuck to the pan. I hate to throw anything out so it will go into work with me today and I am sure the girls will enjoy what I have salvaged from this mess. I will try it again some day and let it sit for hours before I take it out of the pan. It is very yummy.

Absolutely delish!!!! I recommend you GENEROUSLY GREASE AND FLOUR PAN, AS WELL AS LET COOL IN PAN before removing. I did that, and it still broke in half, which was ok, because I just sliced it and set it on a plate, versus leaving it whole. The flavor was amazing. I baked in an angel food cake pan instead of a bundt, due to other reviews. I'm glad I did. I am making this again for Easter, I wish I hadn't of gave away the rest of the pieces of cake!!

this turned out so moist!

i'm glad i followed the suggestion to grease and flour the heck out of the pan because it came right out after being cooled.

i served this with fresh strawberry puree and it was awesome.

i followed the suggestion of another user and ground up the coconut and pecans. i really liked the way the texture came out. 

definitely making this again!

Hey! This is a great cake. I have made this cake for everyone.  I first saw the recipe on Southern Plate, Christy Jordan site.  The most common comment about the cake is "you don't mean vanilla wafer cookies, do you". We love it with a warm strawberry sauce.  You know, I think I will go and make the cake now.

Absolutely Wonderful Cake!!!!!  I made it this week and my entire family loved it!  I did bake it in my angel food cake pan instead of a bundt pan and it came out perfect, I had no trouble getting it out of the pan.  The only thing is that I had to bake it 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  This is a super easy to make and delicious!  I will definately be making this again.

Just as wonderful as I remeber. If you love coconut and pecans...this is the cake. Had been given this recipe years ago. Looked and looked but couldn't find it. Was very happy to find it here. Only changes I made was : (1) not to ground the pecans, I used chopped. (2) I added vanilla to egg and butter mixture.  (3) I didn't mix waffers with coconut and pecans.  I added waffer crumbs alternately with milk and then folded coconut and pecans in at the end. Everyone loved it...even the skeptics!

This is a great office cake!  I did, however, change the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/4 c of sour cream and a tbsp of vanilla extract.  Came out great, used bakers joy spray and had no issues with sticking.

I made it today but without a bundt - I used a regular pan for 1 hour and muffin tin (30min only) - it's good I let it cooled and my husband is working on making it disappear - it's very dense not a light cake. I also reduced the sugar to the 1.5 cup.

Great recipe,I had lost one very similar that my mother used to make. The only thing i do add is a tablespoon of vanilla. Always a huge hit and very simple to make.

The texture of this cake was definitely different--very dense.  It got mixed reactions from my family.  I was expecting it to be sweeter based on previous reviews on this site...I liked the coconut and ground pecans, but if I made it again I might add cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves and make it more of a spice cake--it seemed to be lacking something.  Cream cheese frosting might help as well--I used Cool Whip since I was concerned the cake might be too sweet.

I put this in a 9x13 because I was afraid of the bundt pan.  I think I should not have been afraid, as the entire cake was 'sliding' around in the pan!  It had a good flavor with the coconut and the nuts.
