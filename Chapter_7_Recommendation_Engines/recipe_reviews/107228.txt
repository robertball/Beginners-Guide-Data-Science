This recipe got RAVE reviews from my middle eastern husband.  After dinner he was eating it directly from the pot.  It's the real thing for sure.  I didn't have shortening so I used butter and a touch of olive oil.  I was really unsure about the cloth bit but I just tried it with a doubled tea towl under the lid.  I'm glad I did.

Umm...yes!  This is incredible!  Did everything just as the recipe called for, except used ground cardamom in place of the seeds.  It was hard to stop eating this.  I served it with the Indian Tomato Chicken recipe listed on this site and me and fam (including husband and 3 little kids) were in heaven.  I'm not sure what to say about folks who found it bland.  I thought it was anything but.  Subtle, maybe, but REALLY tasty.  Eat it as a side dish to make sure you get enough "flavor" out of your dinner!  (By the way, I'd cut the recipe in half next time - this is two dinners' worth of rice for a family of 5.)

Finally an awesome Indian rice recipe! It was absolutely awesome! My husband also loved it and I'm keeping this recipe handy!  I used the saffron AND the ground turmeric (the turmeric was put in with the other spices). I also added a chicken bullion cube to the spices and it turned out awesome!!!!  It was good enough to eat by itself.

I made this using brown rice and quartered the recipe. I also goofed and forgot to add the yogurt. I used 1 c. brown rice, and 2 c. water, and baked the rice for an hour without the whole cloth thing. Baked brown rice always comes out much better than stove top. All the spices I used were ground. And I used oil instead of shortening. At first it seemed bland, but after a few spoonfuls, I really grew a liking to it. The flavors are subtle and it works great as a side dish.

Excellent rice dish for Indian Meal of Grilled Chicken Thighs Tandoori and Raita also from AllRecipes.com.  The Cardamon is an expensive seasoning. I could not find cardamon seeds at my grocery store, so I used ground cardamon. Also added 1 teaspoon of chicken bullion along with the water and yogurt in lieu of the salt. Used olive oil instead of vegetable shortening to cook onions and spices. Did not use saffron threads because I do not like this spice. Saffron is too over powering for my taste. Used Indian Basmati rice in  place of regular long-grain white rice.  I cooked the rice in my enameled covered cast iron dutch oven with three terry cloth towels tucked under the lid to absorb moisture; this worked well.

This was so much better than serving plain rice with Indian dishes, like I was doing before. I'll be making this from now on!  I halved the recipe, used turmeric instead of saffron and used butter instead of shortening.

This rice is easy to make but very bland. If you are south Asian you will not like this rice. I would skip this recipe and find a more authentic recipe.

Sorry but I was expecting more from this dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written, I think the problem was the cloth because it wasn't as moist as I expected to be.

I definitely made only a variation of this recipe due to not having many of the required ingredients. I simply wanted something to spice up the rice. I used jasmine rice (1 C); chopped onion (1/2 med onion); 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon, cumin, garlic powder, and ginger. It was very good and I will use it again and again. The flavor was just enough to spice up the plain rice.

I halved this recipe.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I used the saffron AND the turmeric (added the turmeric in with the other spices) along with 1/2 tsp chicken bouillion.  I also used 1/2 tsp ground cardamom, as I didn't have cardamom pods and I used a combo of unsalted butter and olive oil instead of shortening.  This cooked perfectly and turned out so great, we loved it.  We did have a lot left over even though I'd halved the recipe, I'm glad I didn't make the full amount.  The leftovers are delicious though, thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

Came out great. The perfect complement to the lamb marinated in yogurt, garlic & rosemary. I will cut the recipe in half next time. 4 cups of rice is a lot of rice.

It wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as I'd hoped!.. Lots of effort! Makes a lot too!  Luckily I also made plain steamed rice and it was better with my main course.  Cooks up somewhat dry, probably because the towel soaks up extra steam in the pot.

followed the recipe but I put chicken stock in my water to add more flavor. excellent recipe. Use the cloth over the pot. It pulls moisture and the rice will be light and fluffy instead of runny.

The towel on the top threw me off and I overcooked the rice. Check before the 20 minutes.  Like the other reviewer I felt it was a little bland or missing something. Itlooked gorgeous as it was sauteing and the aroma was wonderful-but that first bite let me down. Perhaps I did something wrong.

The rice was good, but a little bland.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any cardamon pods, so that didn't help at all.  I halved the recipe, but next time I'll just halve the rice  and water and keep the extra spices.

This was a good recipe. We did not know exactly what to expect but thought it was slightly bland but otherwise had a great texture. I served it with garbanzos and chicken curry and it was wonderful. Thanks!
