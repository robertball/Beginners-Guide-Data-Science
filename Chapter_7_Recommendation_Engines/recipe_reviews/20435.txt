This was delicious! Very cool and refreshing! I made the six servings (not realizing how much it would make) and drank it all (which is alot for a thirteen year old)! It was a nice change from the usual mango lassi I make.

I turned this drink into a fruit lassi by adding some banana and mango. I used about 2 cups of yogurt.  I also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water and added some cardamom and rose water to give a little more flaovr.

Delicious.  Great way to eat dairy products. I had this for breakfast made with banana.  I will definitely make it again but I think I'll reduce the sugar a little.

Too watery.  It's way better with ice-cold milk than water.  Water is used only by Indian restaurants for profit.  Real lassi is all milk and yogurt, no water.

I used a tablespoon of sugar, added a 1/2 teaspoon of rose water, and didn't add the salt. I used about a 1/2 cup of water and the consistency was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to add 8 teaspoons instead of just 2 to make this taste like authentic Indian lassi that I've had. If you add about that much sugar, it is just like the real thing!

I would not recommend using non fat yogurt! I had to add something to make it taste sweeter and went with chocolate syrup for the flavor and then it was okay. Next time I will stick to regular yogurt.

This was fast, easy, and delicious.  I put a banana in, as it would have spoiled within a day, and garnished with cinnamon.

I followed the recipe for my hubby and I, but added some frozen blueberries at the end. Delish!!

Then, I customized it for our child by adding a dallop of natural honey to make it sweeter. The result was a healthy version of the "Yop" drink that kids like. All the taste but none of the fructose glucose!

Super refreshing!  I added 3 tsp. sugar, and only 1 cup of water- it looked like it would be way to thin with all the water.  I am definitely going to make this more often!

This tasted nothing like the lassi's I've had at Indian restaurants. It is very sour, there isn't a hint of sweetness with only 2tsp of sugar. Adding 4 TBS of sugar made it sweet, but it still didn't have the flavor of a lassi. It needs rosewater and perhaps something else. I hope I can find a better recipe.

This is a really good basic recipe. I followed another reviewer in substituting milk for the water, and added a half cup of pureed pineapple and two tablespoons of lime juice, and then sweetened with Splenda to taste, along with a shake of cardamom. Sweet-sour pineapplelime deliciousness we'll definitely do again.

Add some cardamom for a citrusy finish!
