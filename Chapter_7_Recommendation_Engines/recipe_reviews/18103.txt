Baker Beware. One reviewer wrote that it was too watery. I suspect she made the same mistake I did and thought the whipping cream was for a topping after baking. However, I realized (too late) that it's the "light whipping cream" that needs to be added with the ingredients. I'm going shopping for more ingredients and will give it another go. I'll review again upon successful completion. I'm sure it will be delicious! :)

Once again I've messed around with this recipe right from the start, so I have no idea how it would have come out in it's original form.  The inclusion of the 2T lemon juice is worth 4 stars all by itself.  Genius!  My variation; 1 40oz can of Yams, no butter, a 12 oz can of no-fat evaporated milk instead of milk and whipping cream, 1/2 c brown sugar 1/4 c Splenda instead of white sugar, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 t mace, 1/2 t nutmeg, 3/4 t cloves, 1 t ginger (or more of any or all of the foregoing, to taste, the desired outcome is a highly spiced gingerbread flavor).  This is far, far better than any pumpkin pie although it doesn't have the dense texture for which I was originally looking.  Next time I'll double the quantity of yams and add another egg, adjusting the sugar, lemon juice and spices accordingly aiming for a 2-pie yield.  If you prefer a fluffier pie seek no further.

I became in charge of the pie, after my family had their first SW. POT. Pie 4 yrs. ago, and the place I got them went out of business this year!  This pie is awesome!  My brother said that if I hadn't told him that it didn't come from the same restaurant I had been getting it from, he never would have known! I didn't have the whipping cream, and added a heaping T of flour (for 2 pies--I doubled the recipe) when I saw water pooling in the batter. The lemon juice makes all the difference!

I really like this pie. The conversion from 2 cups of cooked mashed potato is more like 450 g. The pie shell should be uncooked although next time I will pre-cook at 170 c. before adding the pie mixture. I like my crust a bit more crunchy.

Very good pie. Very similiar to a recipe my mother gave me - we just omit the whipping cream and use cinnamon and allspice along with the other spices mentioned. I will be making this for years to come!

This was so good!  I have never made sweet potato pie before in my life.  And this was really easy.  I used Ono sweet potato (I'm in Japan and they are really good).  I also added a bit more nutmeg and added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon just for fun.  The commissary didn't have an light whipping cream so I had to use reg. whipping cream but it turned out fantastic!  I will be making this again.  In fact is was so good, that we're skipping dinner and just eating pie!

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg and it turned out great!  The mashed sweet potato had some extra water in it, so I just added a little "instant mashed potato" and it soaked up the water without changing the flavor

Now that's what I'm talking about! My mother always told me NEVER forget the lemon! This is the first time I saw lemon included in a sweet potato pie recipe , and I've seen many. She also added just a pinch of salt so it wouldn't taste flat. She also didn't use cream. Instead she used Carnation canned milk. But, I'm sure substituting the cream makes this pie delicious and I'm going to try using that in my Thanksgiving pie. This sounds great!

This pie is most excellent! Changes I made were to use a 26 oz. can of sweet potatoes.  Since I am not a fan of white sugar I substituted 1/2 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinammon. I used a deep dish pie shell.  I poured the leftover filling in a bread loaf pan.  This one is a keeper.

This is a very good pie, my friend who don't like traditional sweet potato pie, like this one.  

For a twist I substitue the lemon for orange juice and a teaspoon of orange zest.  Try it you will love it, also.

I followed the recipe except I cut the sugar 1/4 cup.  I am not crazy for the sweetness to this pie.  The pie texture is very firm and love how it cooked.  Can not test the lemon so do not know if that made a difference.  I would make this pie again just need to cut the sugar more so i can taste the potato.  Overall goo pie

i just made this pie. i cannot have sugar so have been trying different recipes and using splenda instead of sugar. this one turned out the best! i think it was a combination of the lemon juice and cool whip (i used organic lemon juice and cool whip free). this was the best! and, no one knew it was a healthier version. woo-hoo!!!!!!! thanks!!

The very first time I had sweet potato pie I was 12, and it was delicious! Flavored nicely with nutmeg, vanilla and lemon juice. 
My family and I over the years have asked for the recipe numerous times and never received it.
I've tried so many recipes in the last 35 years to try to recreate that pie, but never found the flavor to be right.
Sorry, but not sorry... cinnamon and allspice dont have a place in sweet potato pie.
This! This is that pie! If I didnt know, I'd swear you're related to the Mayes of Niagara Falls.
Thank you so very much for posting this recipe. I will make it again and again. Much love!

This pie if certainly very good. Not too sweet which I like and the nutmeg is not too strong either. It did make way more than one 9" inch pie but not enough for two and that's the only reason why I only give it 4 stars.

I AM SO SURPRISED MORE PEOPLE HAVE NOT TRIED THIS! This was a great pie. It was the first time I made sweet potato pie!! Instead of nutmeg and vanilla, I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon which gave it a nice taste. I cooked it under 350 degrees for 60 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!
