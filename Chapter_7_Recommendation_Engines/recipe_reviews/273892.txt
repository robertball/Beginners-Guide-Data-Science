I had a few of issues with this recipe. First, it does not state to peel the peaches. I have made desserts like this before and I know that the peaches need to be peeled. Second, the topping did not crisp up. I knew this would happen so I removed the lid during the last hour. And third,  a paper towel needs to be placed along the lid to prevent the moisture from dripping down onto the crisp. I accidentally set my slow cooker to high and this was done in 2.5 hours. Thank you for the recipe. It was tasty and we enjoyed it.
