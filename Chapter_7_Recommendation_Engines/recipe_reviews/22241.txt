I made this for our Friday before the Super Bowl Steeler party at work.......  The whole thing was gone before lunch!  Everyone LOVED it! Everyone wanted the recipe too ( even several doctors asked for the recipe).  I did make  few changes.....  I added an extra apple and added brown sugar to the apple mixture.  It was a real hit!

Turned out lovely.  I took out the fat and used 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup applesauce. Added a pinch of salt to the batter too.  This is a dense coffee cake.  Don't expect light or fluffy.

My Dutch boyfriend loves this cake. He says it tastes better the day after it's made.
It also doesn't take as long as the recipe says in my oven.

This is a recipe that appeals to all ages.  The prep of the apples is the hardest part, but is easy if you slice them using a cuisinart.  Enjoy!!!!!!!

I baked for 1 hour (10 min less than recommended). It was still a bit over-baked. My family ate the apple middle and left the "burnt" outer layer. Also, I drizzled a powdered sugar icing on top. The baked apple middle tasted yummy, but I doubt I'll use this recipe again. Wasn't worth the effort.

I LOVE this recipe. I just made this tonight and am already thinking about using other fruit in place of the apples. The cooking time was right on for me - 70 minutes. I was really worried about the cake sticking to the bundt, but it ended up slicker than a trout and slid right out!

Made as directed. Like other users have stated, 70 minutes is too long. I baked it for 65 minutes and the outside was still a darker tan. Next time I will try 60 minutes. The taste itself was great. Next time I may add a little more vanilla and cinnamon. Another cook added 1/2 cup of sour cream. This may help make the cake a little more moist. For the topping, I used leftover cream cheese frosting (cream cheese & powdered sugar). Definitely will make again, but decided on four stars because the oven time seems off and no topping was suggested.

This recipe was easy to make and taste good it was a little heavy to me for cake but not as heavy as a bread. I used my kitchenaid food processor to cut the apples so they were more like thin slices than wedges. Waiting for the husband to taste it to see if its a keeper (he's allergic to dairy) but me and the kids think its great.

Here's the deal with this recipe.  It tastes great, and is easy to put together, but it is pretty difficult to get the middle baked without over baking the outside.  I made it twice and the first time the outside was perfect, and the inside was gooey.  The second time I baked it for 10 minutes longer and the inside was perfect, but the outside was way too tough.

I give this 4 stars because everyone loved this cake but i'm not a huge fan. It's not super sweet (which is why everyone else loves it) but i've made this cake so far 2 times. Keeper recipes for family events.

It was ok but kind of lacking something.  Maybe use some brown sugar and more cinnamon in the batter next time.  Some people say it is better second day, will try a piece tomorrow.

I made this recipe in an aluminum disposable baking pan, 10 x 12 inches in size.  It took 60 minutes to bake, was golden-brown in color.  I used 4 golden delicious apples, which are sweet, so I used half lemon and half orange juices.  I added 1/2 tsp salt, used 1/3 cup brown sugar on the apple slices instead of the 5 T sugar, and added 1 T molasses to the cake batter.     The recipe directs to use the large bowl for the eggs, sugar, liquids; but then, the dry ingredients which were set aside (in what?) are to receive this wet mixture.  I mixed the dry into the wet in the large bowl and went on my merry way.      I haven't tasted this cake yet, but it smells scrumptious.  I plan to take it to a bridge group tomorrow, after I decorate it with cream-cheese-icing flowers spaced so that each sits in the center of a small square serving.  The top surface is perfect for minimalist icing.    I'm certain it will be enjoyed.  

Four stars because a bit of work on the recipe would make it easier: 3 tsp baking powder = 1 T; use a scant T of vanilla and put it in the OJ so you won't forget it and the vanilla bottle gets safely stowed away; since the apples vary a bit, what's the harm in using 1/3 cup for the sugar that goes on them?

This recipe is very simple to make, and people are always impressed with the cake. My neighbour even referred to it as "the best bundt cake he had ever had." I generally bake it for 55 minutes, and then check to see if it needs more time. Just like every other cake, the baking time will vary.

Thanks for sharing your recipe. I've made this a few times now. Like the others, I find cooking time to be a bit less than stated - 50mins in my oven.    As I made it this time in a castle shaped silicone bundt cake mould, I had to increase the volume and didn't want big lumps of apple. I grated the apple instead of slicing. I also added a tsp of bicarbonate of soda and added a little more liquid.    This does make quite a heavy but delicious coffee type cake and in my opinion is well worth trying.

Although I have not yet tasted the cake, the smell is fantastic! ***I used a 10" - 12 cup bundt pan and the batter almost came up to the rim and as it baked it came up about and inch above the pan.  Can't wait to taste...birthday cake for my husband.

Great recipe! I diced the apples, reduced the sugar a bit as I was  using sweeter apples (not green), and I replaced the OJ with 1/3 c rum.  What a nice moist, flavorful cake!  It sliced beautifully--we had it at church for coffee hour. I have a dark bundt pan, so it took less than 70 minutes to bake.  I made again, added some allspice, nutmeg, almond extract instead of vanilla, walnuts, and spiced rum! Delicious!

Really good cake and easy to make. I used a combination of pears and apples with added spices like ginger. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and baked the cake for only 50 minutes. The cake came out perfect! I will definitely use this recipe again.

At 60 minutes the top looked almost burnt so I removed it from the oven. After letting it cool, I turned it out onto a plate it was completely undercooked in the middle.

A very moist cake but was disappointed in richness and flavor.  I added a few pecans to the apples (we have more than several pecan trees in our yard so I add pecans whenever possible) and my husband liked it.  Don't think I will make this again, but then again my Dad and husband have ate over half of it in 24 hours.

I live in Poland and I need to stick with recipes that have simple ingredients, because we don't have such an array of readymade products. This turned out well. 65 minutes in the oven. WONDERFUL texture.

Definitely glad I read the reviews before I made this, as it went a total of 55 minutes in my oven which was perfect baking time. A bit on the bland side.  I did add a bit of salt to the cake batter.  Salt in baking is often overlooked but is important to enhance the flavors in baking as well.  I didn't dislike this, but I wasn't in love with it.  I thought it would be tastier after sitting a day or so.  Wasn't real moist, wasn't dry neither.  It just needs something but not sure what.

I used apple pie filling instead...about a can and a half. I used the remainder for some apple cream cheese danishes. It's delicious! It's become a staple dessert in our house.

This cake is delicious. I only baked it for 55 minutes, not 70 as the recipe said, and it could have even come out a minute or two earlier.  I didn't have orange juice so I substituted skim milk.  I will definitely make this again.  They key to this one is making sure you slice the apples thin.

I enjoyed the flavor. I gave it a three star because it is dry and hard to eat as an after dinner desert. I can see myself eating this with a cup of coffee in the morning.

My hubby wanted this for his birthday cake, and he really liked it. A bit bland for the kids, though. I did as another reviewer suggested, and replaced the oil with half buttermilk and half applesauce, and I thought this made it nice and moist. Also used gluten-free flour, and it turned out to be a nice batter.

I love this recipe because it's delicious and I have the ingredients readily on hand ... I like that it uses oil instead of butter and my friends always love it!  It seems like a fancy cake but it's still pretty easy to make.

A Keeper... I rated this a 4 because I made some changes. I only baked it for 53 min.  as per the reviews and people saying that 70min was too long.  It came out perfect.  I also added 3 tbsp. of greek yogurt, extra vanilla, 4 apples with extra brown sugar and extra cinnamon.  I also added a cinnamon crumble to the bottom and served it with a caramel sauce to give it a little extra sweetness.  It is not a sweet cake but my family loved it.  I will save this recipe.

Very dry and not much flavor.  The cooking time is way too long, I cooked less than 70 minutes and it still came out super dry.  Even if it hadn't been overbaked, the cake lacked any real flavor.  Very bland. The apple filling was tasty, but it left a weird texture to the bread surrounding it, not really moist, but more soggy.  Won't make again.

I made it today...it turned out perfect and simply delicious. I did add one cup of walnuts and 1/2 tsp of salt.
I baked it as directed, then added sprinkled icing sugar on top of it while it was still hot...I then printed the recipe to add to my recipe binder. This recipe is a keeper!

Oh, my goodness.  This is an amazing cake!  I made it exactly as presented, and it was perfect.  I was worried about the cook time because of the reviewer who said it was overcooked at 70 minutes.  I checked it at 50 minutes, again at 60, and left it in for the full 70 minutes.  It was perfect, not too dry or overcooked at all.  I used a simple powdered sugar, milk and vanilla glaze on it after it came out of the oven.  My entire family loves it, and are just amazed at how delicious it is.  This cake just entered my family's recipe book of repeat recipes, a rare and unusual honor.  Thank you for sharing it!
