Five stars for the actual fry bread.  I did make a few small changes.  My mom learned how to make fry bread from a Navajo woman and she gave me a few suggestions.  Add a little bit of fat to the actual dough to make the fry bread tender- I used about 1-2 tsp. olive oil (not authentic, but oh well).  Also, instead of just a depression in the center, she always makes a small hole.  This allows it to cook evenly.  I fried in a mix of canola, olive, and coconut oil (ran out of canola).  I made 6 fry breads out of this recipe (some smaller than others).  I used my instant-read thermometer to measure the the temp of the oil.  These turned out perfect, and so yummy!  The topping was only 3 stars, at best- it's a little bit bland.  Next time I would just make my own thick chili to top these with.  I thought kneading the dough would be difficult, but it really wasn't.  It was a little sticky, but I only added a couple pinches of extra flour and it handled just fine- turned into a nice, silky dough.  I enjoyed making these!  I ate too many, and I don't make fried foods often (harldy at all) so I'll probably wait a little until I make them again, but I really enjoyed them!

These are awesome for just the Fry Bread alone!  Best Bonus:  I found that they make up quite large and only 1 taco filled fry bread can easily satisfy my teenage sons! Everyone like the taco's that way for a change.  Yummy too for doing a dessert with the cinn/sugar/honey & also try it with ice cream.  **Update** I have made these several times per the resquest of my teens--the first few times I struggled a bit with the dough.  Hints to help make the dough easier to handle:  1) I scalded my milk before adding to flour mixture.  2) Make sure you knead it at least the 5 min. 3) Make sure your oil is a 365.

This review is for the fry bread portion:
Oh my this recipe is soooo good! This tastes like the "chalupa bread" from Taco Bell only BETTER!! 
Taco's never tasted so good! No more hard shell or flour tortillas for our family. Once you try these you will never go back. They are easy, tasty and so chewy (I could go on & on!). I made these 2 days ago and used the bread like regular tacos(they fold in half nicely after they cool)and filled with regular taco meat and toppings. Well, my husband already asked me when I was going to make them again! So we are having then again tomorrow! 
P.S. If you have any fry bread leftover try them with ice cream (unbelievable).

Oh what an ordeal to make...but boy were they worth it. I think I must have done something wrong in the frying process (I've never really fried anything before). I used a big sauce pot, filled it with oil and heated the oil to the temp the directions told. Only thing is when I fried my bread the whole house filled with smoke. By the time I fried my last piece my fire alarm was going off, then my security system went off, then the fire department came, then all the neighbors came out to see what was going on...and I'm just like 'what...I'm just making fry bread...'. After the smoke cleared we sat down at the dinner table and enjoyed a wonderful and yummy meal of fry bread tacos. Everyone LOVED them. I will for sure make it again, though, next time I will have to figure out a way of doing it without involving the fire department.

HELPFUL TIPS: This makes 3 (using the suggested 3/4C dough) & I can't imagine ANY adult eating more than 1 since they take up the entire plate (as my pic shows). It's necessary to make this as PAPER THIN as possible as they thicken up a lot.  I like to make this for company & use a little less than 1/2C so they're the perfect portion size.  I fry these about 2-3 min. on each side.  By the time you flip it, it shouldn't sink into the oil.  I also used a knife to pop any bubbles that formed so there would be a nice flat surface. You can make these ahead, and heat up in oven (temp 200) for guests or even microwave! I layer mine w/refried beans, then the ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, green/red/AND white onions diced, followed by cheese, salsa, sour cream.  This is truly the best and as mentioned, wonderful w/ice cream.

AMAZING!!! I was so nervous about making this, as I've never made any sort of bread or tortilla, and I have only fried like 3 things in my entire life. Very easy and so delicious. I made the entire taco, per the recipe and it was just awesome. I served my boyfriend first while I finished frying the bread and I peeked out of the kitchen at him to get his reaction to them (I'm an insecure cook... and a dork). I was thrilled when I saw his eyes widen and he got the 'wow' look on his face. :) Thank you so much, I'll be making these often. They were fun to make and SO good.

You really do have to be certain the oil is hot enough before dropping in the flattened dough, or it won't cook through before turning golden brown; once you drop it in, though, the fry bread is done in a flash, and it really is wonderful. If you aren't a big salsa fan (like my husband), try substituting a can of diced tomatoes and some fresh chopped onion, garlic, parsley and cilantro. I've also noticed several people noting that taco seasoning is too strong; I would suggest seasoning your beef (or ground bison, if you can get it!) with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, chili powder and paprika to taste. A great recipe, and versatile; it reminds me strongly of the Indian Tacos I used to get at the great State Fair of Oklahoma as a child!

I have so enjoyed reading the reviews of this recipe, especially the lady whose smoke alarm went off, then her security alarm, then the fire department came...  At Native American gatherings, here on the West Coast, there will always be an "Indian Taco" booth, and one Indian Taco will fill you up, and then some!  Indian tacos usually start with a layer of refried beans on top of the fry bread, then a layer of crumbled ground beef, followed by the shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, diced onions, and then any topping of diced black olives, sour cream, guacamole, and picante sauce.  Just set out a table with all the fixings, and let your family/guests make their own, according to their likes/dislikes.  I add a hint of sugar to my frybread dough, and while I'm waiting for the oil to heat (seems to take forever!), I'm testing it every so often by dropping a tiny ball of dough into the oil.  If it sinks to the bottom and just lays there, your oil isn't hot enough.  Once it gets hot enough, you will probably need to turn it down a bit, or eventually your oil will turn black because it can be too hot as well.  I dedicate one large, cast-iron skillet as my frybread skillet, because it will get messy and is really hard to clean.  I cover and save the oil between batches, saving and reusing the oil as long as possible, even draining the oil and filtering it through coffee filters to re-use. Finally, frybread is terrific just as the bread for any soup or chili dish.

This is one of my favorites!!! I have never tried this meat mixture, but the bread is fantastic, think a 100% better homeade version of the taco bell chulupa, soft yet crunchy and rich. normaly I make mesquite grilled chicken breast, chop it up, and top with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, & a bit of ranch. the best! I always get huge raves!!

This was good,but i prefer to buy authentic Indian fry bread mix.
Named"ha-pah-shu-TSE"...can be found at most large grocers.It's already mixed,i just add a bit of warm water to the mix in a glass bowl,cover with a damp towel and place in a warm over or a warm spot for 2 or 3 hours. (makes the bread lighter and fluffy).Tear the dough into 4 seperate pieces and roll them out pencil thin before deep frying. YUM!!

Marvelous.  SO SIMPLE!  My instant read thermometer was essential.  Oil must be at 365 degrees to make a perfect texture.  NO colder.

Greetings from South Dakota, Thanks to my Grandma I know how to make fry bread. I roll the dough out, use a fork to make holes throughout the bread (like pie crust) before frying it, it will lessen the big bubbles, and dust the flour off as much as you can before frying so the oil doesn't burn. This is a nice recipe. Once you get the hang of kneading and rolling out it gets easier. You'll be a pro like me in no time.

I was not going to review this recipe because I thought all the excellent reviews were covering it nicely but when I read the reviews about the bread having no taste and the tacos being messy, I just could not resist.  This is "bread" What kind of flavor are you expecting? and as for being too much oil, if you fried it correctly there there should be minimum oil absorbed and they are fried. As for the messy comments, all the fry bread tacos that I have ever had were served on a plate with a knife and fork.  I was very happy to find a recipe that I had wanted for years on this site.  Keep up the good work and thank you to all the people who take the time to post.

Dear ones I am Shoshone and the "queen of fry bread" I love that I can top anything on fry bread-at Powwows we call them Indian Tacos---but I love the Navajo recipe the best--I add a little sugar to the flour--how is how I was taught---

**HELPFUL TIP- NdN frybread was something i grew up on, frm both sides of my family. Each tribe has its own tricks up there sleeves when it comes to making frybread lol Just wanted to add a lil' helpful tip for all you trying this recipe. ** As your dough sits to rise a lil" you want to pinch off a ball size of dough, you ONLY want to use the rolling pin to roll out your ball of dough once forward once sideways. You don't want to flatten it, the whole concept is for it to be fluffy. After rolled you use both hands stretching it out working your way in its circular motion pretty much making it into a circle. After, you stab the middle with a fork leaving 4 tiny holes or u can make a lil'slit for sum reason it helps it breath while cooking, hope this helps. ALSO another favorite is empanada's its like a frybread hotpocket lol same steps as if you were making frybread or ndnTaco's? Instead of frying the circle dough patty by its self you can fill (1) side with your choice of flavor some use meat,beans & cheese or hamburger& potatoes ect. You then pull the other side over pinching the dough closed & your left with a 1/2 circle pocket then drop it into oil cooking the same as if you were a frybread (both sides)? An then "Boom" you got a tasty treat of awesomeness lol Good Luck & hope this was helpful...

Fun and delicious. Salsa is key. Here in New Mexico we have lots of choices in our International aisle at the grocery store.  Try crushing your pinto beans while simmering on the stove and maybe add a little garlic Powder. Omitted taco seasoning in ground beef and only added salt, pepper, and garlic Powder. Fry bread dough is very thick after kneading for several minutes. Roll or make by hand Very thin discs. Another reviewer said cut a little hole in center of each bead to fry, and also another reviewer who didn't have a thermometer said they tested a few small amounts of dough until they fried right-both were INVALUABLE pieces advice! Quit worrying about making them perfect circles - they're still yummy. Everyone had great fun adding fresh ingredients and North of the Border Green Chilie Salsa.

Use masa instead of flour, then cut it open (after you fry it, of course) then stuff it and you have a gordita!

Im Native American, raised on fry bread and yes have made it 1000 times or more in my life. I found the dough (if you follow recipe exactly) to be too sticky to handle, they put too much salt in it (I made a double batch and only put 1 tsp in and the dough was waaaay to salty, couldnt imagin how it would have been with 2 tsp.... Ick). They ask to put in way to much milk. The recipe I make and most Natives use is with powdered milk then the wetness is from warm water. The dough is soft, easy to handle and just a pinch of salt and suger..... This was nothing of the sort and no one would eat the fry bread. So after all that I ended up making my usual fry bread that every one chowed and enjoyed. 
As for the taco part, I didnt even attempt after the failed frybread. But we normally do one of the two. Make simple chili and put taco toppings on top or just make your favorite home made taco meat then with all ur fav. Taco toppings. Yum.

This is pretty authentic.  I learned to make fry bread from some Ute indian gals almost 40 years ago.  Recently had a dinner party and served this. I made up the meat, beans and some green chile and put them in crockpots.  The other toppings:  onions, chopped tomatoes, lettuce, guacamole, grated cheddar and sour cream were in serving dishes.  Folks could top them any they wished.  It was a complete hit!  My husband manned the blender for the margaritas and I served a caramel cheesecake flan from this site.  A friend who used to live in New Mexico actually made the fry bread as I was quite busy!  What a fun evening it was.

I've made this recipe so many times it's hard to count. For all of you out there with little experience with Indian Tacos, the bread is not supposed to be folded, it is to be puffy and you layer your toppings on top.... Absolutely delicious!!!!

We all enjoyed the fry bread...(especially my 4 year old), but I thought it was a bit too much for tacos.  My bread was really thick and heavy despite my attempts to roll it out very thin.  I made mine about 1/8 of an inch thick and about 6 inches in diameter. I got about 7 out of one batch. I did have one left over so I brushed it with butter and sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar.  I think I enjoyed these more as a dessert rather than a "taco shell".  Thanks for sharing.

I'm reviewing the fry bread only. Great! Easy! Except for cleaning up the oil afterwards. =) I made the dough in 6 pieces, that was a good size for my taco. I used my Kitchenaid with the dough hook, let it go for 5 minutes, turned it off and let it sit 5 minutes, then dropped it on a floured board to cut into 6 chunks.

This is awesome!!  Closest thing to Taco Bell chalupas you can have at home!  I didn't use the filling part of it. I just used ground beef with Taco Bell taco seasoning and everyone made their own with sour cream, cheese, tomato, salsa, lettuce, etc.  I used about 1/2 c. dough for each and rolled it very thin with a rolling pin.  I fried it in my deep fryer on one side then kind of bent it in half when I flipped it. I did do what a couple people suggested and add 2 t. oil to the dough.  Was amazing!!!

Not bad, just not great.  I was a little skeptical that the bread would have much flavor, but I was swayed by the glowing reviews.  It turned out that I was right.  The bread was pretty flavorless and never got crisp on the outside.  I think it would be better used as pizza crust, because that's what it tasted like to me.  On the plus side, it was extremely filling.  I divided the dough into eight pieces instead of four and still, no one could eat more than one taco.  It was fun to try, but I don't think I would make this recipe again.

OMG. This fry bread recipe is SO GOOD!!!  Sad to say, but my hubby and I only had 1 left for the actual tacos!  We couldn't stop eating these things before dinner was ready! We stood there like little kids thinking of all the things we could use this for... "oh, my Spinach Dip!" "Ooooh, french onion soup!"  "Mmmmm, garlic bread!"  This was fun!!! Thanks!

I was looking for a ground beef recipe that I could make on short notice (today) with a tight budget and nobody would believe how easy and inexpensive this was!  I didn't find the fry bread any more difficult than any of the baking I've done, and although a little messy (both preparation and eating), the results were well worth it!  The only complaint I got was that although I doubled the recipe there still wasn't enough!

I've been making this recipe for my kids, ever since my husband came home from a business trip to New Mexico, some 19 years ago.  He described it to me, and I pretty much took it from there. It's a wonderful recipce and makes a great meal.  You cam make these as plain or fancy as you like.  I've served this recipe or variations over the years to a lot of people.  Everyone has always liked these.  My kids always request these when they come home for a visit.  Try it; yours will love them too.  It's a really great recipe.

Super good.  I was a little nervous about the dough being sticky and difficult to kneed, but it came out perfect.  It was really easy to make.  In Oklahoma they are called "Indian Tacos".  For the people that complain about the bread being too thick to fold into a taco.  Duh, that is not how you eat them.

This recipe was great!!! I used the exact recipe for the fry bread but for the topping I used taco meat, shredded mozzarella and cowboy caviar (corn, black beans, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, cilantro, lime juice, cumin and garlic). It was wonderful!

This tasted just like the Indian Taco's that I used to get when I went to the Oklahoma State Fair.  I would suggest patting the dough out to 1/8 inch thickness as they puff up.  As far as the previous comment about the dough being hard to work with, be sure to dust the dough ball with flour before handling and make sure to keep your surface dusted with flour and your hands too as long as you are patting out the dough.  I added chopped green onions and tomatoes also.

I made another recipe right before this one that I was very disappointed in, but not these.  These are even better than what you can get in a restaurant.  I followed the recipe to a T and am very pleased with the result.  Awesome recipe!

These were good and easy to make.  Wanted something different than our typical taco meal and this fit the bill.  Didn't change a thing to the fry bread but added our own taco toppings to our preference.  Thanks for the post.

This was awesome.  I made my own toppings but used the fry bread part of the recipe and wouldn't change anything on that part. For those that found that the dough was way to sticky what I did was add about 2 tsp of evoo to the mix and it made a huge difference. I had 1 fry bread left over and sprinkled sugar and cinnamon and put whip cream on top and my kids loved it.  I will def make again.

Very good, reminds me of home! The fry bread is good only when fresh, so don't try and make the frybread early before.

First time making this.  So easy and so good, although my fry bread was not too pretty.  Also misread the instructions and added water instead of milk to the batter.  Still tasted great!

Reviewing the fry bread only.  Made it tonight to serve with the Pork Chalupas recipe from this site.  Everyone loved the fry bread (and the chalupas).  My son asked if he could have the leftovers for breakfast with   jelly.  What leftovers??  Frying isn't my favorite thing to do but I think we will be making these a couple times a year as a special treat.

A favorite at our house. These are a really good twist on tacos with the fry bread. YUMM-O! In Oklahoma these are known as Indian tacos. Very filling, a lot more so than a taco with a corn tortilla. Fry bread is great sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar too or served with honey (sort of a sopapilla) if you have any left over. *Use bill echols' taco seasoning I recipe or "seasoning for tacos" by sue gronholz found here instead of the package mix!

Delicious fry bread recipe.  My Grandmother would make these and the old way was to poke a hole in the middle.  Indian women would turn the breads using a stick.  My Grandma still did it that way!  Try drizzling melted butter on the breads and spreading with Salal or wild huckleberry jam on them.  A sprinkling of powdered sugar on top - so good!

These are called indian tacos and not meant to be folded like mexican tacos. Put the frybread on a plate then the meat sauce,cheese,lettuce and whatever else your little heart desires. we always used diced fresh tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, black olives, sour cream. Need to use a knife and fork....enjoy.

Fry Bread Tacos are my favorite way of serving tacos. I am not a fan of taco seasoning so I leave that out. In its place I add salsa to the meat after it has been drained and cook the meat until the salsa is warm

Very good and tasty!  I divided up the dough into 8 portions so they were easier to serve and eat.  I also omitted the beans and salsa step and just threw black beans into the meat after it was browned.  It's a keeper!  =)

Hot roll mixes work the same way and MUCH easier!  Make according to package directions and roll out to 1/4" thickness and cut into squares.  Deep fry (one trick for the perfect puffiness is to splash a little of the grease onto the top side as the shell floats, then flip... until golden)  Slice open one side and create a 'pita' type pocket for your taco fillings.  I grew up eating these and they are a family favorite!  Use butter/cinnamon/sugar on leftover shells for a dessert.

Sounds Great. Fry Bread was a staple in Albuquerque. They sold it on the side of the road. They even had a booth at the state fair.  The only comment I have is that you need to drain and rinse the pinto beans to get rid of the calcium chloride.

Whew. This was a serious ordeal for an end result that was not that great. It was a ton of work - and the bread tasted like fried baking powder to me. Very bitter. The taco ingredients were also cumbersome and just ordinary. I will never be making these again!

I can't believe some of the reviewers compared this fry bread to the chalupas at Taco Bell!!!  Are you kidding me?! There is nothing that compares to the horrors found at Taco Bell. That is an insult to the person who submitted this recipe. I found the fry bread part of the recipe to be pretty good - much better than anything found at the above mentioned fast food restaurant. As far as the whole taco concept - I think you could adapt the recipe to whatever your tastes are: some like spicier taco meat, others prefer beans. Some like fresh veges, others only meat and cheese. Some like condiments such as salsa/hot sauce, others like black olives. The point is eat it however you like it. And if you have a sweet tooth, the fry bread is delish sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon or drizzled with warm honey.

I have made these several times and they're wonderful. My kids love them. I always (as many others have) use my own meat/beans mixture (I don't use canned beans, rather make my own refried beans because the taste is just so much better) and the toppings my family loves. The bread is very good.

Very good. The dough was a little sticky so I had to add a little more flour. Our family also liked it with a little sugar added to the mix to give a hint of sweetness. Wowza!

I only used the fry bread part of this, but it is delicious! The kids loved them and I did too! I think they would be good sprinkled with some cinn/sugar like another reviewer said! Make sure to make a small hole in the middle of them before frying or you get a big bubble! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really only saved this recipe for the fry bread recipe, as I wanted to make my own taco meat/bean mixture. I took suggestions from some of the other testers and added a tablespoon of lard
to the fry bread mixture. I also kneaded this in my Kitchen Aid mixer, which speeded up the process. These came out perfectly and made two large breads and 
three medium. Just enough for my family.
My oldest son scarfed this and asked 
for seconds, which surprized me. Really great dinner. I'll for sure make this 
fry bread often. Worth the work put into it.

I made this recipe in my Bosch mixer.  If you choose to do this, put the milk in first, then add the other ingredients.  My first batch tasted bland and was quite wet.  I added more salt and flour and they were perfect!  I loved how quickly these came together.  I had leftover chili, so I didn't use the rest of the recipe, but the fry bread was great.  I made extra and tomorrow I'm going to heat them in the oven and sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar and then top them with icecream and chocolate syrup for a get together with some friends.  Thanks for the recipe!

I actually fried the bread in my deep fryer and they puffed up in the middle. So what i did was cut them in half and stuffed everything inside them so that they were like gorditas. A big hit!

This was okay for us.  I made the dough as suggested, and thinned out the bread in the center and made a little hole in the centre of each round as well.  I made this into 10 smaller fry breads based on reviews claiming these were huge--I'd make the smaller breads again, if I make this again.  There was nothing wrong with the recipe, just wasn't "special" to us.  The fry breads covered in sugar and cinnamon were a big hit though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is for the fry bread only  , here in the desert southwest taco season is never used by the native Americans! it came out so good my husband said it came out so close to his mom's(she was full blooded) he was proud of me!The only thing I did different was increased the dough resting time of 1 hour because his mom did!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I put all of the bread ingredients in my bread machine and let it do all the work. I did add about 1/2 cup extra flour because the dough was to soft to work with. Thank you for the great recipe.

Oh my!  I made this bread as a quick lunch to use up some leftovers in the fridge with my kids.  EASY and YUMMY!!  I doubled the recipe and then left some dough raw to see how much I really needed.  Needless to say I had to go back and finish cooking the rest!  It was great for lunch AND for dessert with whipped cream and fruit!  THUMB'S UP!!

The fry bread was really good - especially with cinnamon and sugar as a dessert.  I found it very easy to work with and made just the perfect amount for a family dinner for 2 adults and three young children (5-9).  I will definitely be making some home made doughnuts out of this in the near future.  The topping was a little bland, but can easily be changed to suit your family's tastes.  Overall I recommend this recipe.

We made just the fry bread from this recipe and then made our own taco toppings. The fry bread is amazing! I don't think I'll ever make tacos any other way. Like some of the other people that commented, we put a slit down the middle of each piece, and they cooked perfectly. This will be a new family favorite!!

Yum! I didn't used ground beef but followed everything else to a "T". Very good, will be making this again.  This recipe is a definite keeper for the frybread alone, the taco is like tacos always should be and that's however you like them best!

Ok, so I'm reviewing the bread, like everybody else. i was going to make the whole taco, but my plans changed. Anyways. The bread is delicious and easy to make. I haven't tried it yet for dessert, but it is good even plain, or with herbs and dipping oil. My only problem with it is that I have trouble making it flat enough. It puffs up a lot in the oil so you have to roll it out as thin as possible, and even then it seems to puff up quite a bit. Also i don't see how it could be used to wrap up a taco without breaking. It is soft, but not pliable, so I don't see how it could be used as a 'chalupa' bread. But this is just my experience. But all that said, it really is quite good!

I made these for New Years Day lunch. Everyone liked them. I rolled some of the dough in between parchment paper and it worked great. The others I rolled in between waxed paper and that didn't work so great! They stuck and were very hard to get off.

Way easier than I thought it was going to be! I tried frying it without pressing down the middle first and it came out like a puffy little doughnut (I coated it in butter and sprinkled with sugar...delicious). When I fried them for dinner I depressed the middle and made them a little larger to hold more toppings.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I have never had fry bread before so I have nothing to compare it to....all I know is that this was great!!! I followed all the directions and added a little sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg into the milk. To incorporate the milk I made a hole in flour mixture and slowly mixed the milk into the flour bit by bit which made it very easy to work with...to tell you the truth these may stop me from ever using store bought bread again.

These were just "OK" for me. A slight disappointment, but not terrible either. Having said this, I do think practice makes perfect. I have never been a pro at deep frying or baking, two things that certainly can't hurt to be good at when attempting this recipe. My hubs and I agree that tostadas serve the same purpose and are just as good as these - maybe even better. I'd be willing to give these another try, but would only do so if I had plenty of time to ensure a better outcome. Other than mixing my beans and meat together and adding a LOT more flour to my dough (it was too sticky to handle otherwise), I made no changes. I got exactly 4 tostada-sized fry breads out of this recipe. My hubs and I ate all of them, so unfortunately I had none left to sprinkle with cinnamon sugar for dessert. :( Depending on your appetite, 1 of these might fill you up, but we were satisfied (and full!) with 2 each. Garnished with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato & green onion, Mexican-blend cheese & guacamole, these were not bad at all. Chips, salsa and Coronas completed our casual meal. Thanks for sharing, Robyn. :-)

We have a local parade/carnival every year and they have these for sale.  This is the first recipe that makes the fry bread exactly the same way. Been looking for this for quite awhile.  Thanks.  After the bread is done, we just have all the topping layed out on the table and it is a "build it your own way" meal.  Everyone is happy and full.  Great meal!

This was a big hit at our house!  I used Terry's Texas Pinto Beans recipe from AR for the beans.  They were a perfect match.  I was able to get six decent sized "shells" from the dough.  Thanks for sharing!

I only gave this a 3 star rating as I love the fry bread itself but changed the topping completely. I made my own refried beans for topping by using 1 can of pinto beans drained and rinsed, then put 1/4 cup of olive oil into a sauce pan and heating over med heat then adding the pinto beans, 1 tbsp chilli powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder and s/p to taste. Stir and mash until heated through. Also, I used spicy shredded beef instead of ground beef. Use a 1 lb chuck roast cut into cubes, 1 small onion finely chopped, 3 garlic cloves peeled and grated, 2 tbsp chilli powder, 2 tsp ground cumin, 3 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 cup beef broth and s/p to taste. In a slow cooker combine all ingredients, add beef stir well to coat, cover and cook for 4 hours. Remove the beef shred and return to the pot for another hour. Then top the fry bread with bean mixture, shredded beef, shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa and sour cream. Delicious, thinking about listing this as fry bread number 3! Thank you for sharing the fry bread recipe, I would definitely make them again.

I make these for my family as a special treat due to the deep frying of the dough. We call these Indian tacos and they make a huge hit at pow-wows. They are also called Scones (sk-ons) For every cup of flour, I use a table spoon of baking powder. Eg: 4 cups of flour and 4 Tbsp of baking powder. I just eyeball my salt, only a pinch or so, and I also put in about (eyeballed)  2 Tbsp of sugar in as well.  You can omit the milk and use warm water to mix it. Add a little at a time until the desired consistency is met.  Mix it with enough water until it is like a very thick pancake batter, where the dough will move like molasses out of the bowl if turned sideways. Use a large metal spoon (slotted is best) to scoop out a spoon full and as you drop it in the oil, press it out a bit to shape it. Done when both sides are golden brown. Make sure, as others have said, that the oil is hot. I also use my own chili recipe to use as a topping along with any taco fixings on top. I am going to try the idea for the left over fry bread. You can nuke them the next day, but they are not as good. Plain fry bread cut in half with jam or peanut butter is great. You can also put in a hamburger, fried egg and cheese, or what ever you enjoy. Warning-this is a very filling recipe. :)

I cheat and use frozen bread dough! Family loves loves loves FB Tacos - sometimes called Ufta Tacos, Indian Tacos.  Leftover fry bread, if there are any, dip in sugar and enjoy! Hubby adds butter to his plus the sugar. Favorite way to have tacos!

I had some leftover taco meat in the fridge so I decided to try this frybread for something different. It was excellent, just as written. The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Will definately make again.

Really, really good!  I made the fry bread only and we topped it like a taco.  The bread is so tender and light.  It was so good, I almost wish I hadn't made it because I'll want to have this more than I should!  I actually ended up having to add about 1/2 cup more flour and let mine rest while I was making the toppings which turned out to me about 20 minutes.  Dinner was perfect!

The bread in this recipe is PHENOMENAL! I had heard it would be extremely difficult to make a good fry bread, but I have never had any problems with this recipe. And it ALWAYS turns out super yummy!!

I don't know about the rest of the recipe, but this fry bread was incredible.  Super easy to make and tasty!  I suggest making tehm a bit thinner that stated.  Wonderful!  Thank you for sharing.  PS. I'm going to make these with cinnamon and sugar next.

I am truly sorry,  but the fry bread was not very good at all in my opinion.  Nothing like fry bread I have had at fairs and so on.  It was dry and not fluffy or crispy.  Seemed like a fried biscuit.  Just totally not what I was looking for.

We love Indian Fry bread. We usually make it once or twice a year. We have always just used a white bread dough recipe. This one is sooooo much better! My husband made them and they turned out great! Just way too much salt for me. I would at least half the amount of salt.  They make a great dessert too with honey or powdered sugar.

Well worth the effort!  Don't be intimated by the dough....I'm not a bread maker and I thought it was easy and not overly time consuming like some other reviews led me to believe.  I followed the recipe to a T and even husband who doesn't like beans thought they were great.  I will never eat another taco shell.  The dough was very sticky when kneading (I used my kitchen aide) but I turned out on floured surface and it was superb.  Only took about 2 minutes to fry on each side.  I fried in Crisco oil using my wok (we don't have a deep fryer and I'm not into frying...this is the 1st thing I've ever fried in my home and I will do it again just for this treat!) After I realized i didn't need perfect circles and could just fry up I was much happier.  Thank you for sharing...this might be my favorite recipe on this site!

This recipe is so easy, and it is definitely a nice change from taco shells and tortillas. The suggestion to enjoy the leftover frybread with cinnamon sugar and honey is great! Like a sopapilla but more bready. My advice is to really roll these out thin - they puff up nice and thick! I didn't have a thermometer so I just tested the heat with bits of dough. When the bit of dough rose up right away I turned my heat down one notch and started frying. We love, love, love this recipe. We are a 40 year old mexican man, a 31 year old irish woman, a 10 year old boy, 7 year old girl, and 1 1/2 year old boy. Great for everyone!!

Like others I'm reviewing the fry bread (used own taco recipe **Update** Used Tasty Lentil Tacos from this site - PERFECT together!).  It's awesome, and should be featured for how to stretch a dollar - I was able to cut the amt of meat for our family of five in half! (Now, with lentil tacos, NO meat!) Woohoo, great, TASTY, bargain food!  This will be a go-to in our house for sure.  Also, I double the recipe & the leftovers don't stay leftover for long - these are GREAT with honey as dessert or warmed in the microwave for a second for breakfast.

This fry bread is absolutely awesome!!! I made this for my boyfriend and my brother and sister-in-law and five kids aged two through fifteen and everyone loved it! I would suggest serving the bread with all of your favorite taco toppings, not just what is called for. One note though, my fry bread didn't stay in the cup like shape, they all just puffed up into mini loaves when fried. Still delicious though!!

What a great new take on the average Taco.  I really liked this.  The fry bread reminded me of peroshki's and I love those.  Be careful while shaping the dough and make them as flat as possible.  When you fry them they shrink up and puff up alot.

These were delicious!!!  I used Pace Picante Medium and it gave things just enough of a spice for our family. My two year old and four year old scarfed these up, as did my husband and I.  Definitely a keeper!!

I was very skeptical at first site of the bread while cooking, it looked like a hockey puck...but it did end up being very tender and light.  (My husband commented that we need to have these more often!) I ended up using an additional 1/4 cup flour for a nice roll out consistency and poked a small whole right in the middle with my finger to allow them to cook without the puff. I enjoy a salt taste but these have a very strong saltiness, I will probably cut back on it the next time.

Delicious!... A new family favorite!  My 12 year old ate 2 and would have ate another if I hadn't stopped him!  The only change I made was to use refried beans because we love them!.. I will make this probably more than regular tacos now!

Didn't make the meat mixture as I am a vegetarian. I just used two cans of black beans + shredded zucchini and green onions and added some spices in. I also made guacamole. The bread itself was pretty good, though I think the recipe called for too much salt. I would go as far as using half of the salt called for. Overall this recipe is a nice treat but not something I would eat regularly.

These are really good. We get these at a local Pow-wow and these taste quite a bit like the ones served by Native Americans. The meat isn't quite right...but still really good!

VERY tasty & VERY easy!  I had no idea what to expect but wanted to give this a try.  My husband and I both really liked this.  I used black beans instead of pinto beans as it just sounded better to me for a mexican dish.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks for posting...

Just a hint, the secret is to not to over knead your dough and to fry in pure lard and nothing but!  Also the other poster was right, you put a hole in the middle and lard in the batter!  Where I'm from the fry bread is called bannock.....also if you want to "lighten" it up press onto a pan and bake at 350f for 25 mins.

These were great. The only changes I made were that I used black beans and sour cream, but no lettuce (didn't have any) The fry bread was *awesome*. I think I didn't make mine thin enough, but the dough was really hard to handle, really sticky. So next time I'll try to roll them out better with some flour. I put some cinnamon sugar on one for dessert. *Yum*

The only real change I made was to add some finely diced onion to the ground beef as I was browning it. I wish I'd rinsed the pinto beans like I usually do though - I really didn't like the somewhat slimey texture. I gotta admit, the fry bread turned out AMAZING. It could have done with a little more salt and maybe a shake of garlic powder too, but it was so good. All in all, this was a quick and easy recipe. Thanks, Robyn!

I had a Navajo taco at the 4 corners in New Mexico when I was a kid and loved it so much that I have always wanted to try and make them myself. The only thing that held me back was the frying. I don't have an instant read thermometer, just a candy thermometer but that seemed to work fine. 375* was achieved at medium high heat and I used my large cast iron skillet. Definitely make either a small hole or a good dent in the center otherwise they'll puff up too much. Really roll them out, I think 1/4" is too thick, they shrink a little when frying. These where very close to how I remember them. I tried to recreate the meal that I remembered so I spread the fry bread with refried beans and topped with shredded lettuce, kidney beans, sour cream, tomato and cheddar cheese. I served with a jar of Tapatio sauce.

I ran out of my commercial fry bread mix and needed more, so I used the bread portion of this recipe for a quick fill-in.  Puts together in a flash and was better tasting than the commercial mix.  I will not be buying the mix again.  We all have our preferred toppings, so I just cut everything up and let everyone top their own taco.

Great Fry Bread recipes. Choose your own toppings and get creative, but this is definitely the bread to use.

i too only made the frybread portion

This is always a favorite treat of mine, that i usually only get around the 4th (get some fireworks, and frybread! every year)

i made this and, after i got done smoking out my house with overheated oil, it made GREAT frybread
I added a TBSP of sugar to this as i topped them with butter and jam, sooo good, and so filling (1/3 of the frybread could make a  good breakfast)

I have never made fry bread, and my family was skeptical (my husband had tortillas on hand for an emergency fix) but these turned out to be yummy.  I did not use the entire recipe, just the fry bread with regular taco ingredients.  I was scared that they were not going to be done because of how fast they turned golden, but they turned out perfect.  Caution though: Very sticky when trying to  shape them.  Thank you for a great recipe!

The first time I had this was in New Mexico with our Laguna Native American hosts...this fry bread is just as good as the ones they served us! yum! 

I use scalded milk, it improves the texture of the bread.

Indian Tacos are a popular "fair" food in Oklahoma.  Since moving to Texas, I haven't been able to get my fix.  This recipe was perfect.  I made the fry bread and topped with homemade chili, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, onions, and sour cream.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Yummy! I was in the mood for Indian Flatbread tacos, like I get at the fair. I made the fry taco bread and added my own mix of seasoned ground beef and diced potatoes. It was delicious topped with with cheese, sour cream and chopped tomatoes.

OMG---this were GREAT!!!! I loved them so much, so much better than store bought tortillas (how we usually eat tacos). My husband made the taco and beans mixture, so we didn't exactly follow the recipe for the meat, but I did use the fry bread instructions/recipe. Had this for Sunday lunch with the inlaws and they raved! Thanks so much!

I only used this for the fry bread recipe..it was awesome..ande EASY!!  I topped  half of them with barbequed pork and coleslaw, and then did the others with powdered sugar and cinnamon--delicious, thanks for such a great recipe.  The only thing I had to do was keep adding flour, because the dough was very sticky, but that is probably because it is so humid here in Florida.

My picky teenager actually said "That was really good, Mom!". If that wasn't enough, my hard to please dad asked for the recipe. If those two liked it, you'll love it! Everyone made me make extra bread so we could have sopapillas for dessert. YUMMY!

These were a different twist on regular taco's for sure.  I rated this recipe only 3 stars because I found the "fry bread" to be too much for one serving.  I may make this dish again, but will use may 1/2 cup portions of dough for each person.

These were good.  The kids loved them!!
Didn't have taco seasoning so I used my Pampered Chef Southwest Seasoning and other spices.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes to the beef and also the beans to save a step.  We didn't have picante so I used salsa.  Spiced this recipe up too!  The only disappointing thing I found is that the fry bread was tough and chewy.  Will try again and if they don't turn out light and puffy will try another bread recipe for them.

This was awesome! The fry bread turned out good, although it didn't turn golden brown - I think either my oil was not hot enough or I didn't fry it long enough, but they were still puffy and delicious. I topped it w/ homemade chili, cheddar cheese and lettuce.  Will be making this again.

I absolutely love these! They are always a hit and are easy to make. I love using black beans instead of pinto beans, and adding sauteed onions, avocado, and black olives as well. Definitely one for the recipe book. Thanks!

We loved the fry bread but before you put your first piece in, drop a small teaspoon sized piece to test your oil. It should fry up right away but not brown to quickly.

Use Blue Bird flour instead of all-purpose.  It's easier to work with and is what all the Navajos use to make their fry bread.

These tacos are so good I had to let you all know mid-bite. These are tacos of epic gnarly-ness such as the world has never before seen. I made mine with a few tweaks: Almond milk for the fry bread with just a dash of garlic and cumin powder in the mix, chorizo instead of beef, and different toppings including queso fresco, purple cabbage, red pepper. Fried in refined coconut oil, and I made depressions in the dough with a spatula during the first half of frying each shell. AMAZING. Seriously. I'm eating one right now. Insane. My 2 and 1 year olds are also devouring their tacos. Again I say, AMAZING.

This review is mostly for the fry bread, since the taco part of the recipe isn't really a recipe (since it is using a store bought taco seasoning mix...although if you are looking for a seasoning, I suggest Taco Seasoning I from this site).  Ok, so the fry bread is actually pretty good.  I made this twice; as written, it yielded us 4 breads.  The dough was a bit sticky, but I just added a little bit more flour, and it came together well.

Rating is based on the bread alone...I used my normal taco fixins to top it.  Before the second bread was out of the pan, there was a unanimous decision that it was wonderful...and that the taste resembled funnel cake without the sweet.  So I rolled the rest of the dough out to about 1/16 th of an inch and cut into strips.  Once brown we sprinkled half with powdered sugar and the other half with cinnamon sugar.  I had a houseful of very happy kids!

These were great!  We only get them at the fair every year.  I did follow recommendations of others and only used about 1/2 cup of dough and rolled them VERY thin (1/8 inch) and they turned out beautifully.

I used my new Fry Baby to make these. I used to make fry bread tacos with homemade bread dough but for some reason hadn't made them for years until I made these. They were so easy to make and my family loved them. I used Terry's Texas Pinto Beans as a topping and no meat. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was skeptical at first- I have never really loved the "Navajo tacos" I've had in the past, and I've tried making the traditional Navajo fry bread before and just not really liked it.  I am happy to say that this fry bread was DELICIOUS!  It really is just like the chalupa bread at Taco Bell. I rolled them out as thin as I could, and made one and a half times the recipe.  This yielded me about 10 good sized discs.  They are really nice and pliable so they easily fold into a taco instead of having to use a fork to eat them. This will be my go to fry bread from now on.  Really so good and so quick and easy.  Thank you!

These were great!  The only complaint from my husband was that the bread was a little thick, he ended up slicing his in half.  Will definitely be making again.

This was an amazing recipe for fry bread. I didnt follow the directions to the t the first time so I had to start from scratch. Make sure you have enough oil in your pan and cook them at a med heat. I love fry bread and this is by far the best I have had thanks for sharing!

Nice recipe. The only change I made was to put a little olive oil in the dough. I think next time I will add some seasonings to the fry bread. Maybe some cumin - then instead of topping with  ground beef mixture use shredded beef instead. I think you could do a lot of variation with this recipe. 
Just don't fry the dough in shortening - I didn't have enough oil so I did half oil and half shortening and the end result was good but it left a coating of shortening on the tongue.

These turned out quite well, but I've had better. I had some fabulous fry bread tacos in New Mexico and was hoping these would turn out the same. The fry bread was a little too dense for my taste; it wasn't filled with air bubbles like the authentic ones are. All in all, it was a good dinner but I'm not sure I'll use this exact recipe again.

This is an awesome recipe for fry bread.  My family loved it.  However I=it says that it makes enough for 4.  They must mean 4 fully grown men that haven't eaten for 2 days!!  I doubled the recipe because I wanted to make sure that we had enough for dessert.  We had so much extra that we are having it for lunch today and I have a family of 6!!

I am so glad I found your recipe for fry bread. My grandma's church used to have an "elephant ears" booth at our county fair in Oregon every year. This was close to the recipe they used! They served it usually with a honey butter sauce, or some sort of local berry topping. Thank you for sharing this. It brings back fond memories of the crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside "elephant ears" I grew up eating every summer!

I love this fry bread!!!  It is wonderful, I made it for breakfast and my family gobbled it up quick!  I did add more flour because the dough was sticking to my hands so I just kept adding more and more until I could flatten it out without it sticking to me.  For breakfast we did honey butter and powdered sugar.  You could put fruit on this or whatever. Yum Yum Yum!

Lovely.  This is the first thing that I have ever tried to fry.  The instructions were very clear.  Wait till the oil gets to the right temp for wonderful yummy goodness.  I will be making this again. I can't wait to try it with ice cream.

This fry bread was really good.  Reminded me of the Indian Tacos I used to get at the fair.  I doubled the dough and it made enough for 7 of us with 3 left over.  Very filling, just doped it up like our regular tacos.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. The only thing I changed was adding Rotel to the pinto beans. The bread recipe was very authentic tasting. Will definitely be making this again!

The fry bread ended up being a little too dense, but other than that it was delicious.  Definitely a recipe to try again.

This was delicious. Keeping the oil temperature at 365 is important so that the bread doesn't soak up the oil. I followed hwiggins review on what to top mine with...chuck roast in the crock pot and the beans...delicious!! I heated up the left over bread the following day in the oven for about 10 mins at 400 and it was just as good!

Growing up, I truly enjoyed the fry bread my friend's mother made (they were Sioux).  Everyone gobbled it down in minutes….Yummmm, great memories!  I'm a novice at frying, but the first try came out pretty well.  Maybe I over-floured because the bread was dense.  I also prefer more salt.  The next time I watched the flour (although the dough was very sticky), increased the salt by a 1/2 teaspoon, also added 2 teaspoons of sugar per my husband's request.  Couldn't really taste it, so if you prefer sweeter, a Tablespoon should do it.  Instead of topping the bread with the taco recipe, I made this with DeeDee’s Black Bean Vegetable soup.  Added 1 extra can of black beans, cut the broth to 2 cups, increased the garlic to 3 cloves and increased the chili powder.  The combination is incredible!!  I will definitely make this again!

Thank you for a perfect recipe. It is quick, easy to prepare, with ingredients found in my pantry/freezer, and takes us back to New Mexico. There is nothing finer than Navajo Tacos and this may not be exactly the same, but certainly closer than I thought I could ever get! I am already plotting to make them again, with variations.

I have to say that I only used the recipe for the Fry Bread because I was all out of taco shells/wraps! The only change i made was to add about a teaspoon or 2 of olive oil into the dough mixture as reviewed by others. For the filling, I browned 1lb ground beef, drained, seasoned with Taco Seasoning recipe found on this website, some water, and added about a cup (or however much you prefer) of chili beans with sauce. Let it simmer, and then serve with the usual taco condiments :) yummy!

I give this 2 stars because the fry bread was incredibly easy to make. We had a problem with it bubbling up so bad that it was super thick. I think I will make the fry bread itself and do as others suggested sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on them for a treat.

This was an "okay" recipe for me.  I liked it,but the kids said, "oh yummy, scones!"  So I ended up using the fry bread as scones with honey butter and putting the seasoned hamburger in tortillas.

i used this recipe for the bread. it was extremely gooey and i had to add 1/2 flour just to make it come together. it was very difficult to work with and i planned to give it low stars...until i tasted it. it is the most tender, perfect fry bread i've ever had.

My 5th recipe to try (3 in one day) This was by far the BEST. Fluffy, golden, tasty, very easy, and closest to what I ate as a kid. Excellent recipe!

I made the fry bread only, and it was sooo good! I divided the dough into 4 parts and they came out HUGE!. Next time I will divide the dough into 6-8 parts. I added a bit of olive oil into the dough as well. I dipped some into cinnamon sugar and was delicious. Maybe dessert will be cinnamon sugar fry bread with ice cream on top and a drizzle of chambord....yum.

We also only use the Fry Bread part of the recipe. I have made it several times and every time is WONDERFUL. We have eaten it as a side to taco soup and chili. We make any type of meat (shredded, ground, chicken, beef) with Mexican seasoning to top it and we love it with powdered sugar and honey for dessert. We probably eat it too much but its so easy and delicious.

I only make the Fry Bread part of the recipe, and use whatever my wife and I feel like for the taco part of it. I've been looking for a Fry Bread recipe and this fits very well.

The fry bread was sooooo good! I used a packaged taco seasoning for this instead. This is definitely a keeper!

The fry bread is amazing. Took some trial and error to get the oil temp right (ran right out and got a thermometer for next time) and had to use a rolling pin to not end up with dough rounds, but it was well worth the effort! Thanks for sharing!

We have been making this for years got the idea from the AZ State Fair. I use frozen roll dough, thaw it out, flatten with my hands and fry. Easy, especially when I have to make 40 taco shells to feed everyone. Yes the left overs get honey.

These were really good.  My husband said they tasted like a Taco Bell Chalupa.  I made these for supper tonight at my mom's house.  The first couple of fry breads we made were too thick so we  divided the dough into 6 pieces instead of four and pressed them very thin and then fried.  This was perfect for us.  Other than that, we followed the recipe.  Everyone loved them including the kids.  It made a nice change from using plain soft tortillas or corn shells.

Wow! My husband asked for these again a week later! He said it reminds him of his favorite chalupas from his past! GREAT! If you make them thin and big enough you can actually use them as a shell!

This rating is for the frybread alone.  I used my own taco stuff.  My husband (who is native american and kind of an athority on frybread) says this is a very good frybread recipe and everyone in my house loved it.

I have made this twice, both times only for the fry bread and not the taco bit.  I had made some chilli the day before and I made some mini chilli bites frying mini versions of the fry bread.  The next day, being addicted to the taste of the fry bread I used it to make a dessert.  I followed the suggestion this time to make a hole in the fry bread, and this time I used soy milk.  Both worked out great.  The hole allowed the ice cream to sit well in the bread (wouldn't use it for tacos as things would fall out!).  I topped it with some berries.  It made a great dessert!

TIP: Buy Rhoades Frozen White Rolls for the scones. Let them unthaw for about an hour, roll out and fry up. Also, instead of hamburger. I use chili (either homemade or in a can). Ranch instead of sour cream is great also. I have grown up eating these and they are a favorite of my own family now.

I loved the dough. Easy to work with and very tasty! I rolled it out and threw it in my fry daddy-next time I think I will use the skillet so I can make the fry bread thinner.

I thought this was a good meal but my wife thought the bread was too heavy. It was heavy but it was a welcome change from light bread. I don't know much about making bread and perhaps I should have kneeded it longer than 5minutes.

These were good, my family did like them.  But we agreed that we like the original way to eat tacos better and it's less ingredients and less mess.

Good!  Family enjoyed it.  I added 2 tsp oil to dough, it came out very tasty.  Used the remainder for dessert, with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled over it.

the dough was a bit difficult to deal with but was tasty! i really liked when the dough was just cool enough to eat, it had a crunchy outside and chewy inside. After the breads cooled, they were mostly chewy but still tasty, especially with all the fixings on top. (I used seasoned shredded chicken, iceberg, tomatoes, grn onion, sour cream, cheese, blk olives, beans & spanish rice.)That said, I had used all recipes to double the recipe and all was good until i added in the last 3rd cup of milk. it made the dough very sticky and so i had to keep adding flour. probably another 1/2 - 3/4c, to which i didn't add more baking powder or salt, which i probably should have. Im wondering if this is the issue of why, even though i pressed them into 1/8" thick or less - they puffed up to about an inch thick in the fryer. ? I also found the dough difficult to make a disc with the indentation. so they were just bumpy delicious dics. I used a small cast iron skillet and fried one by one so, i think next time i will use about 3/4" deep of oil. I found the recipe was more than needed. (i made a splash mess, putting the first few in) i ended up making them about 6" around, and everyone ate one, except my 16 year old nephew who ate 2 & 1/2, and they all said it was really good! :) I have leftovers so i'm going to try to warm them in the oven with other suggested toppings. Will make again, work on my dough skills, this was worth the work!

These were a great alternative to taco shells. I don't think I'll ever buy the shells again. I did use refried beans instead of pinto beans, and you def need more than 2 cups of flour. Maybe 2 1/2 all together. I will definatly make these again.

I should have known I would not like this recipe b/c it is fried in so much oil.  I will have to try it again but this time I think I will brush the dough with oil and bake it.  I just didn't think the dough had all that great of a flavor, it just tasted fried and oily.  I am not sure what I was expecting but everyone else loved it so I thought I was going to be tasting something other than what was on my plate last night.  A disappointment to say the least. I usually agree with the majority of the ratings on this site, but not with this recipe.

tasted great...but i think i did something wrong along the way, because mine puffed up pretty thick. i decided to cut them open and use it like a taco shell and found some of them to be doughy in the center. it must be my mistake, because no one else seemed to have this problem. but being the improvisor that i am, i pulled out the stick centers and served them anyways! the outsides were perfect and my husband said he didn't really even notice that i had to alter anything. i really liked the texture. i had 3 left over so i cut them into strips and sprinkled the suggested cinammon sugar mix and that was a HUGE hit with my 4-year-old. (she's quite picky) in fact, i caught her sneaking the container of them into her room. really great recipe, so versatile. what else can you make for dinner and turn around and make a dessert out of it?? nothing i know of. next time i'll roll them out thinner and fry them longer. all in all, excellent!

Rating the fry bread only.  Great fry bread recipe.  I use corn oil to fry it and I sub 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of white flour.  My family prefers the whole wheat version.  I hate frying so I usually double the recipe and freeze a ton of fry bread at one time.  These are also fantastic served warm brushed with melted butter and honey...similar to (if not the same as sopapillas)

I made these the other night and I was afraid what my husband might think. He had thirds. My nephew was also begging me to make them again this week. I think because I drizzled honey and sprinkled powered sugar over the leftover one. I had a hard time getting the balls of dough to turn out how I wanted them to at first so the first ones were small and puffy. I got the hang of it shortly. Yum!

I was able to whip this up while the kids were still at school to "try" it out. I used 1/2 wheat flour 1/2 white flour. They were so yummy!!! I let the kids eat them after school for a snack w/ butter & honey and then we had them for dinner as tacos. Very, very delicious! The wheat made them a little bit heavier, but still very good. I did roll them out very thin, because they seemed to thicken up a lot while frying. Very simple and very good!!

Good and easy. I actually double this not realizing it made some many. We sprinkled some with cinnamon and sugar while still warm and had dessert first. Then ate our fry bread with all the toppings. YUM!

Everything I cook is a five.

Seriously delicious fry bread. I agree the 'taco meat' was very bland..but this is why we cooks taste as we're cooking.

So delicous, we like using the left overs for desserts. Add some chocolate sauce, or jam.. Wow.
All three of us Loved it.

Great frybread recipe - just like my Lakota friends make it!  I added a bit of crisco to the dough (1tsp) as suggested and it turned out great!  They are perfect for tacos - but also make a perfect dessert base: Top with fresh fruit and sugar, wojape or even chocolate for a sinfully delicious dessert!

I am only rating the fry bread. It turned out really yummy, but I had to add a lot of extra flour to the dough. It was far too sticky for me to knead without that additional flour. Maybe it's supposed to be like that? The bread tasted great, and I topped it with my own meat and vegetable concoction. Thanks!

I am rating the bread, and i LOVED it i will never buy shells again.  They were perfect, i used my own taco mix and i just thought wow they took my taco to a whole new level.  With leftovers i did sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on them and that was very tasty too.

I actually use this recipe solely for the fry bread!  I started out using it as written but have since used my own taco recipe and toppings and used the fry bread as stated in this recipe.  My husband doesn't really want tacos any other way!  And although we don't always do it this way because of the time and the nutritional value, it's a very big hit with the whole family and very filling!

These were pretty good.  I've used frozen dough balls to make fry bread in the past, and I think they tasted pretty much the same as the ones in this recipe, and were way easier to make.

Have made this several times since getting the recipe, and have just had a blast with it. It is very good both as part of the main meal and as being used(fry bread) as a desert. As Dessert, I used Homemade vanilla icecream,, fresh picked strawberries and a drizzle of chocolate.

Like some of the other reviewers, I substituted the taco seasoning because my kids find it too strong in flavour - instead I used some Manwich sauce! I had trouble making the tacos thin enough but I didn't burn any and it was still SO good. I piled my meat on top, put shredded cheese and some sour cream - yummy! However...given the "nutrional info" for this recipe, it will be a special occasion meal only :)

I did my own thing with the ground beef and toppings but the fry bread was excellent. I doubled the recipe and it made enough for 3 adults and 3 kids to have the tacos AND desert with honey and cinnamon on it. Perfect for a small group and quite filling. Def will make it again. Thanks

This was very tasty! I followed some of the other suggestions and made my frybread a little smaller and thinner. It was easy to make (my 4 year old helped roll out the dough). We will make this again!

Very easy and tasty recipe!  Even making the fry bread didn't take much time or effort.   Ended up making 8 fry breads from the recipe (made them small) and everyone ate one with taco stuff on it and one with honey.  Yum!  Thanks!

I must have done something wrong b/c my fry bread puffed up and was hollow on the inside. The flavor was still good though so I just made a deep taco bowl!

The frybread is delicious, with cinnamon and sugar on it, but I don't know how you'd make tacos out of it - unless I did it wrong - because it was waaaay to puffy.  Would be great in the dessert category, though.  Just sprinkle cinnamon sugar on it directly out of the fryer, and it's grrrreat!

I did not find this recipe that great.  The fry bread was difficult to make and, although it tasted good with the sweet stuff, I was unable to make it into a form that would hold taco stuff.  It was also challenging to make the meal on my own since the bread required so much extra attention.

Made this recipe according to directions. Mix was very sticky so had to add more to be able to knead it. Taste was good but not the best I have ever had.

Thank you so much for this Native American recipe! We had a local restaurant that made this type of taco shell, but it closed and I’ve been looking for this type of fry bread ever since. This recipe is delicious!!! 

I did add 1/3 cup sugar to this recipe due to a few reviews complaining it was “just a bread”. No, this is NOT just a bread! Top it with your favorite taco toppings and it is so doggone delicious! The sugar did add a hint of sweetness to it. I also floured my hands for kneading and had to add a bit more flour during kneading to make a nice workable dough that wasn’t sticky - just like many bread recipes need. 

I mixed up the recipe at lunch time and cooked mine right away. The remainder I wrapped in wax paper and put in the refrigerator to keep until hubby got home 8 hours later. So if you want to serve at a party, you can mix it early and fry it later. I would wrap each serving individually so you can just pop in whatever you need later without working the dough too much. 

I had wondered if my hubby would like it because we have different styles we like. I like things crispy and he likes things softer. I just cooked mine a bit longer (deeper browning) and his a bit shorter (lighter browning) and he surprised me by saying he absolutely LOVED it!

Do make sure your oil is at the specified 365F, or it will be in the oil longer and will soak up the oil instead of fast cooking a perfect flour fry bread (taco shell). 

Thank you so very much for this recipe!!!

It was okay. If I did a round two, I think it would be about 20% better. Make sure to make them thin. Mine was okay but didn't rival the franchise equivalent, which is what I had hoped.

I thought these were okay.  My family ate them and said they would like to have them again sometime.  I divided up the dough to make 6 scones, so they were smaller.  the puff up a lot but don't spread out.  When (or if) I make them again I will
roll them out thinner and see how they are.  If, meaning for the many calories they are, I didn't think they were worth it.

I have made this twice already but I must be honest and say that we always use my grandmothers taco meat recipe. I only use this recipe for the fry bread, simply because it is delicious. I do not usually rate a recipe unless I make the complete recipe but, I thought it deserves a 5 star simply for the fry bread. It comes out delicious every time I make it. One of these days I will use the entire recipe and update as needed. Until then, thank you for sharing, it is great!

I have always loved fry bread, but I had never made tacos with them.  I made my taco meat with my own seasonings.  I spread sour cream on the fry bread, then the taco meat, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  It was great, the whole family loved them.  I will definitely make them again!

Oh my heavens made the fry bread from this just for fun. And wow what a hit with the family!!! Great to snack on cold too or dipped in Italian dressing! When they were hot I drizzled Hershey syrup and sprinkled confection sugar before serving.

Like others, my review is just for the fry bread part. I made the bread for dinner. It's super easy and super fast. I think with a little tweaking here and there it could be a lot better. I found it to be a lot heavier and not as soft, light and fluffy as the Taco Bell one. I did see another recipe that said to add shortening. I got the taco shape while frying by rolling it out and holding it in a U shape while dipping it half way in the oil then letting it go after about 40 seconds. Over all taste was not too bad and I think I can definitely make changes for improvement.  I will make this again.

This review is for the fry bread only.  WOW !!  I cannot believe that only 4 simple ingredients could come out tasting so delicious. This is my first attempt at making fry bread but I know for sure I will be making it over and over.  I ate it with a beef fajitas filling. Can't wait to try them with cinnamon sugar. Thank you for sharing.

i just made the fry bread, it is soo good! i didnt have any milk so i used half heavy cream and half water, it worked perfectly! then i made the breads half the size and only cooked each side for 2 minutes. on some of the breads the center was lighter than the rest of the side so i let them cook for another minute. they were so delicious! i will definatly be keeping this recipe.

I saw an article on MSN that talked about these, among other recipes. I had to try them. I made mine just like this recipe says. They are great. the only thing I would do different is the size of the bread. Once cooked, there are pretty big. I only got 4.  We both like these enough to make them again, but I'll made the bread discs half the size, because we couldn't finish the whole thing once the toppings were on it.

I used the other two pieces of bread to coat with cinnamon and suger. Very good! Reminded me of the funnel cakes we get at the fair.

I made a half batch of the fry bread and it made 4 shells. They are amazing! Crispy outside with random crispy bubbles and an inside that's soft and slightly chewy; they remind me of chalupa shells. After siting out they do get a little softer if you want to do a folded shell. 

The dough is very soft, but just have lots of flour around while kneading and it will come together in no time.

The hardest part of this recipe was frying the bread so it didnt burn, once the oil was hot enough the dough cooks very quickly. The fry bread tacos we made were delicious!

The fry bread is really good with taco stuff. I only made this for the bread. Make sure you flatten the dough quite a bit otherwise some parts are still not cooked. I made about 6 balls of dough with the 2 cups flour which was more than enough for us. For the heat on my stove I had it up to 5.5 (low to 10 range) and that was pretty close to 365f. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe. Simple and easy. My family is native and we've heard and seen so many different ways to make it but I'm not in to the over adding ingredients . Thanks for sharing!

Note to others: this recipe makes about 10 good sized so if you cut down ingredients you won't be left with a lot of dough.  Usually 1 per person is what we all eat since size is pretty good but that depends on you. Also great alone ; with a little sprinkled sugar & cinnomon

This is my third try making fry bread & it is why I kept on trying... to get to this! It is awesome!!!! I didn't make tacos. I am currently sitting here sipping on spiced chai & having fry bread with Nutella. :) 

I used the recipe's ingredients with these minor alterations: 
I used 1 cup and 1 tablespoon of flour.
1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup tepid water.
*I may not have had to add a tbsp of flour if I hadn't added the water, but I am not sure to what degree I would add either one ingredient, and I wanted the dough to be more sticky. 
1 tbsp melted butter
Seasoned salt instead of plain salt.
Same amount of baking powder as called for in the original recipe.

I let the  kneaded dough sit in a warm place for an hour. 
I only had olive oil so I used that to fry. The dough was very sticky so I oiled my hands thoroughly, doing so between every dough ball. I couldn't really get a 'ball', and definitely couldn't shape it properly, but it stretched and it kept together in the oil. It could fairly fast (2-3 minutes per side) 

It is SOFT on the inside, slightly crunchy on the outside! I need to make some soup or sauce to sop it up in!!! 

Thank you!

Perfect! we use this for tacos or a fast dessert.  Keep the oil at 360, cool on a grocery paper bag.  Always add a tsp Bacon Grease To the Flour mixture ! Yummo, everyone loves them.

Have made this recipe twice now and the flavor is spot on. I did find that the dough is a little bit hard to roll out thin, next time might try with hot milk like previous poster said. Will be making these again, husband and kids love it!

Loved this and so did my family. The only thing I changed was that I added a few tablespoons of olive oil (made the dough silky and after frying came out fluffy) and about a 1/4 cup more of flour. Will definitely save this recipe to make again.

You get 5 stars from us. The fry bread is one of the best I've had. I only added 2 teaspoons of oil on the second batch which we really loved.

This was so good!!! I didn't think it was difficult at all. As per some suggestions, I did add solid coconut oil, about 2 tablespoons to keep it moist.

My family loved these. I did make a change but just a minor one because I didn't have pinto beans on hand so I used a mixture of kidney beans and black beans. Definitely would make again.

OMG so good. I used salsa instead of picante sauce. Also I didn't have a thermometer so I just eyeballed the oil. The first fry bread was burnt but the rest turned out GREAT! So delicious. Will make again for sure.

I grew up with fry bread being native american.. as the dough recipe is similar to that used in sopaipilla.. adjustments can be made.. but we used 1/3 tsp salt and we make our own taco seasonings.. so no excess sodium. we also went a healthier way.. we use a mix of fine corn flour and chickpea (garbono bean) flour to increase the nutritional value.. as well as olive oil. we also made them with blue corn flour.

I wanted to like this more because it was some trouble.  But the flavors weren't that remarkable. That said, it was very different (the kids said it was like Navajo tacos) which was fun.  One is sufficient per person.  I needed to add quite a bit of flour, maybe 1/3 cup, to keep it from being sticky.  I made golf to racquet ball-sized balls and rolled them with the small Pampered Chef roller.  It took a while to get the hang of it for someone who doesn't fry, but I will do it again.  I think other more flavorful ingredient would be better; chopped chicken in chipotle sauce?  Even a fajita-type steak would hold up well in this "shell".

These were amazing!  The bread turned out great.  We paired it with black beans, ground hamburger, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, hot salsa and sour cream with shredded cheese.  My husband loved them as well.

This review is for the fry bread only. It is excellent and very easy.  I make a very simple vegetarian chili to go on top, then put on ranch dressing and shredded cheese.  I find having meat in the chili makes is an extremely heavy meal.  My 4 yr old daughter calls these "happy cakes".  When asked what he wants for dinner, my husband always mentions these.

When I first saw this, I thought I would use the recipe for the fry bread, but just top it with my normal taco go-to's.  Then I decided to follow the recipe exactly, and I am certainly glad I did!  YUM!!!!  Wonderful, delicious recipe!  The only thing I may do differently next time is spice it up a bit, but this is truly 5 stars as is!  Thanks Robyn Bloomquist, for sharing this gem  :)

Best Fry Bread EVER!  I’ve never had good luck with fry bread, but this one had so many positive reviews that I just had to try.  It did not disappoint.  Wonderful flavor with a light, tender texture, yet firm enough that you could “hold” the taco firmly without it falling apart.  That’s my biggest frustration with some fry breads is that the bread is so dense or chewy that you have to eat it using a knife and fork or they’re soaked with so much grease that the bread is mush.   Can’t say enough about these.  It’s a KEEPER!

These were delicious! I only used the recipe for the bread though. My husbands Mom makes these, and mine were as good as hers (after I got the kinks worked out). I didn't have a thermometer or deep fryer last time I made them. They got really puffy! A little too puffy from how big they are supposed to be, but still delicious.

I have to admit I totally make the taco part of this my own way, I only use this recipe for the fry bread. It's a five star recipe for that alone I think. Everyone in my family LOVES this bread even the pickiest one. We love it with tacos or even with chilli. 
I always make extra because we use it for dessert with cinnamon and sugar. If you top that with vanilla ice cream it tastes a lot like fried ice cream.
Obviously you can tell we love this fry bread recipe. It's super simple and fool proof.Everyone always thinks I did something amazing and when I share the recipe they are amazed at how little goes into it. So definitely make the fry bread and I'd say just do the tacos your own way!

I've made this recipe so many times now. It's wonderful-- even as is. I have made an adjustment and found it to me a little more moist... I add just about a tablespoon of crisco to the dough to keep it moist during frying. Turns out beautifully! I also keep the heat between 300-350, not quite as high as the recipe calls for.

Excellent recipe. Just loved the fry bread tacos. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. Fry bread for tacos and a couple sprinkled with cinnamon sugar for dessert, we were in heaven!

What can I say that hasn't been said before.  These were incredible!  Just made the bread part and used our own taco topping but the bread was perfect!  My kids loved them as well.  Definately a keeper.

So easy compared to the fry bread I grew up on. The toppings can be changed to suit your taste. Personally I like it as a dessert covered in honey!

In my home these are called Indian Tacos, and yes they are a treat to have. My sis says to add 1 egg which makes it golden and crispier. Also great alone with strawberry jam!

These are great.  Particularly the fry bread (which I'd never made), it came out perfectly.  The leftovers I had with raspberry jam, which I liked even more!

This was really great.  I have a hard time working with dough and oil in general, so the scone part was a little bit challenging (and time consuming) for me.  I wasn't sure if I had the temperature too hot, or not hot enough, but the end result was still really delicious.  I really liked the bean/salsa mix and will probably add this to other things I make, like taco salad or tacos.  Has anyone tried making the scones in a fry-daddy?  I would make this more often if I had an easier and less messy way of doing it.

this was the first time I've ever deep-fried anything and I really enjoyed it!  My breads looked small and funny, but the texture and taste were good.  I made the tacos as written and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup water (I doubled the recipe) for the frybreads and this is a recipe I'll make over and over again.  Topped with plain Greek yogurt  and the whole thing was delicious!

This is a review for the bread only...very good base but wasn't what I was looking for.  I'll use it for a dessert base instead - really good leftover toasted with cinnamon/sugar!  Directions as given were very easy and made perfect sense!  Kneading the dough for 5 minutes is an absolute MUST to get a smooth dough.  Thanks for the recipe Robyn!

make sure you make the bread thin before baking  - 10 times better than the 1/4 inch.

I was hesitant to make the fry bread...I love corn tortillas,and my husband likes flour.So I came across this today.I decided to try it even though I couldn't find a thermometer.Fry bread for him, corn tortillas for me.Haaa! I was so shocked how good these turned out...the corn were untouched.Light, fluffy wonderful.Maybe some other reviews didn't knead enough.I did it in my mixer for 6 minutes.I can think of other things these can be used for.I haven't been this excited about a new recipe in years.I just never heard of this before.

I made these for my whole family and we also bbq'd some chicken. We ended up boxing up ALL of the chicken to reheat later because these were gone as fast as I could make them! My niece had a great time rolling out the dough for me, and the kids liked the assembly line of food they got to put together. Afterwords, I made some more and topped with honey and powdered sugar. Yum.... definitely a keeper.

I only made the fry bread, but it was amazing!  This was my first attempt at frying anything, and it was easy, and the instructions were great.  I followed one review and put a hole in the middle, but I also did a few without, and they turned out fine.  I will definitely make this again!

These are great! Have made these twice.  First time, kept the dough thicker and loved them.  2nd time, hubby wanted the dough a lot thinner, so they cam eout crispier, like a tostada.  Those were excellent, too!  Thanks for the variety for taco night!

Thank you for this recipe! I have been looking for a good fry bread recipe to rival that of my late aunt's. I was only a child when she made these for me, and it brings back so many warm memories!

The whole family went back for seconds; and all of us felt so full afterwards - we didn't use the topping; did more tradional 'taco' toppings without the beans, etc; but wouldn't mind trying twice-baked beans.  Used chicken rather than beef; as we simply had more chicken.  Very nice bread; though; even the bread recipe by itself is five stars...

These were great! I didn't have the beans, so we did without, but next time I'll be sure to add them, as I think it would have "held" the taco meat on the fry bread. I was having some trouble keeping the meat on the bread without it :-) We really enjoyed this, it was definitely a nice change of pace, however I think we might do this on recipe on a less frequent basis b/c of the heaviness of the bread and the frying.  But we'll definitely keep this recipe for future use!

I just used the fry bread in this recipe, and it's soooo good. I was worried they wouldn't be cooked through since they were done so fast, but they were perfect. Hubby is a picky eater, and he LOVED these! I put maple syrup on the leftovers and ate them as dessert. Delish!

I am reviewing the fry bread only. It's fantastic! I fried the dough in canola oil in my deep fryer and it was done in a flash. Then we all just topped our fried bread with beef and our favourite taco toppings. I can't believe how easy and delicious this was. It was extremely filling. I live with three men ( Husband and two brother in laws) and my 2 year old toddler so I doubled the dough recipe. I really didn't need to as one was plenty. I still have three left over. My picky daughter gobbled it right up. I'm going to make her one for dessert with cinnamon and sugar and a small scoop of ice cream. This fry bread recipe is definitely a keeper.

This review is for the fry bread (as I made a different filling for my tacos).  Very good!!  So yummy as the shell for chicken tacos and also when used as a dessert.  We sprinkled leftovers with powdered sugar like funnel cakes.  We even made one into a sundae by sprinkling on some cinnamon sugar and topping with vanilla ice cream and chocolate-caramel drizzle.  Yum!

I only made the fry bread part of the recipe, and I tweaked it so that it became a cross between Navajo fry bread and Chinese scallion pancakes.  I increased the salt to a full tablespoon and added about 1/4 cup of chopped scallions (green onions).  Oh and I also added a tablespoon of olive oil before mixing, as suggested by another reviewer, even though olive oil is neither Navajo nor Chinese.  I prefer the taste of Chinese scallion pancakes, but the texture of fry bread, and this was PERFECT.  Yummers!

My first time of making fry bread and it turned out great!  I had to add about 1 extra cup of flour all together for it to be the right consistency.  I wanted to mention that I took the suggestion of making a hole in the middle for the bread to cook evenly, and on the last one I just made the indentation. The one without the hole turned out the best I felt so I'll just do that when I make these again.  I really surprised my husband with these last night!

The fry bread is so perfect!  Just don't do like I did and not roll it flat enough, your fry bread will end up a bit thick.  (good for dessert if you mess up).  Add your favorite taco toppings and instant dinner hit.

MMM! We buy these on the reserve during pow wows. This is JUST like the ones we get there... They're great with some cinnamon and lemon juice too, if you save some for leftovers(very filling, you will I'm sure) they taste very good if you just pop them in the microwave

This is just for the fry bread part.  It is really good.  My husband and I like it for tacos, but the kids like it with honey.  My 2 year old won't eat, but he eat this like crazy.  It's a fun alternative to tortillas every once in a while.

I am only reviewing the fry bread portion of the recipe, as we made our own topping.  This made some decent fry bread!  It was a little heavier than I am used to...I think it needs some sort of fat added (shortening or butter, maybe?).  Overall, my family was pleased with the results!  Thanks!

Wonderful!    The fry bread was lovely, and very easy to make.  I did mix it up with the toppings based on preference.  My sister is a vegetarian so we just used refried beans, tomato, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.   They were fun to eat and tasted great!

The idea is great, but I felt like it lacked flavor. Also, some reveiwers said you could fold these like a taco, but we couldn't... they broke EVERYTIME. They were fun to make, but I doubt I will ever make these again.

It was okay, but my family prefers taco meat over chips instead of the fry bread.  The bread was a little greasy and we like the saltiness that tortilla chips or fritos have.

These were really delicious and filling! I had never eaten fry bread tacos before making this recipe, but had heard many great things about them. First of all, be sure to make the beans as the recipe suggests, it really adds to the flavor. I am one that always rinses the beans before using them to remove the salt, but in this case I advise refraining yourself. The fry bread was thicker and less crispy than I expected, but that was probably my fault. I got the bread pretty thin, but we do not have a thermometer, so the oil temperature was more than likely off. I predict this to be an oft requested dinner in our home! Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't very impressed by this recipe...  I made the fry bread and we used it to make tacos (like one reviewer suggested).  I made the discs thinner than 1/4 inch and they still blew up much bigger in the oil - much too big to 'fold' into a taco with toppings inside.  I also added a little oil to the dough (as suggested by a reviewer).  I had to add flour every 30 seconds or so while kneading (very tedious for 5 minutes!!) because the dough continued to get sticky as I kneaded it.  After all that work, the fry bread didn't really have much flavor.  I prefer regular taco shells, which is strange, because I LOVE Taco Bell chalupas!

5 stars for the bread alone!  I was a little skeptical when I was making the bread but it was fantastic.  I am not sure I would eat it would the taco fixings again but will make the bread again!

5 star taste, but lost one for me with how sticky the dough was.  Next time will follow advice and let the Kitchenaid do the work.  Got so frustrated I actually scraped one of these off the work surface after it stuck for the nth time and threw it across the room...  Taste was wonderful, but needed a TON of flour to be workable, and yes, I made bready things quite a lot.  Will make again because it was so good, tho.  Made my own taco meat so only rating the fry bread.

These fry breads were terrific, the only reason why it got four stars, is I found i needed alot my flour. It was very sticky at first, but once i got it, they turned out terrific. I didnt try the powdered sugar on the leftovers, but I will the next time. a very nice change of pace to the ordinary taco... Very good and very easy!

The fry bread is so tender and tasty.  My family loved them and it has now replaced my old stand-by.  Thanks for the recipe!

We've tried MANY recipes for Fry Bread and this is the best we've come accross. So easy to make and quick, too (no rising).  We usually just use canned turkey chili for the topping with lettuce, olives, onion, tomato, salsa and etc.  Pretty quick and it is a family favorite!

Oh yeah.  These were good.  If you are putting in the effort to make these double the dough amount.  You will want some to put powdered sugar or honey on.  I found that 230 degrees F was a much better temp to cook these at.  The slower, the softer.

I used this recipe for the fry bread only and added my own taco toppings.  I made it for a family weekend at the lake and my in-laws told everyone back home how great they were.  Such a wonderful way to change up the ordinary taco.  I did find that I poked several holes in the bread to keep it fromforming bubbles.

I have never been a person who could make any kind of dough, but this came out perfectly.  The directions were straight forward, the ingredients were easy and everyone loved it.  I added a little sugar just to give it a little sweetness, but it would have been fine without it.  Great recipe; I'm glad I tried it.

I prefer to use kidney beans in myne. The Fry bread was good, where I live we also have a recipe called pop overs which is just where u put the meat mixture inside the dough than fry it, But I haven't mastered that. I love indian tacos though they're my favorite. Thanks

We really didn't care for the bread/taco combo.  It reminded us strongly of taco meat on top of a funnel cake.  The bread was good and i think i will sweetnen up the leftovers with powdered sugar but from now on taco meat will go in shells or tortillas.  sorry.

I used the fry bread recipe only. It made 4 plate size. These were messy but worth it . Both kids and adults liked. Watch the heat on the oil. Next time I will make 8 out of the 4, because then it will be easy for little hands.

It was ok. It would be better if the Fry Bread came out lighter...or maybe only as a winter meal. Still, part of me just thinks "Why not just Tacos?" Less hassle, less mess.

Wow!  I've always loved Indian Tacos at Pow Wows but I've never been brave enough to try to make the fry bread.  Thanks so much for putting up this recipe.
It was easy and great!  My husband told me to never buy tortillas again, as he only wants fresh fry bread tacos:)   I used my own taco sauce recipe and all the trimmings.  Really great, again thanks.

I also did my own thing with the toppings and meat. The fry bread was great. We also had it as a dessert (after the tacos) Having it prepared FRESH makes all the difference. Awesome.

My husband LOVED this recipe and he is a super picky eater. He hates everything, unless it's burgers or pizza, but he absolutely loved this and he was full after just one serving. What a great recipe and super easy too.

I think I was expecting too much due to all the great reviews. That being said, it was still tasty. It just wasn't any better than other fry bread recipes I've tried.

This fry bread recipe is delicious.  I used a taco seasoning recipe from this site instead of the suggestion listed here.  This is a very filling meal.

They are really fun and tasty.  The fry bread is wonderful and leftovers are great as a dessert with honey on top.  The meat mixture is okay nothing special.  I will make the bread again for sure, with my own taco meat recipe.

I made this for a group of people at my house for dinner.  It's so easy but people were so impressed.  They loved it!  I didn't try the dessert option but I can tell it would have been great!

The bread is quick and easy to make.  I replaced the canned beans with beans I made in the crock pot.  I also used kidney beans.  My kids love it!

we just tried the fry bread with my own taco recipe. It was AWSOME. We left our fry bread flat and added the taco on top. Then cut it up and ate with a fork. I will be making this again soon.
