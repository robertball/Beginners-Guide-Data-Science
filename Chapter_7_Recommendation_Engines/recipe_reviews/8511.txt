Very good!  My husband & I loved it.  I cubed the chicken instead and served it more as a stir-fry style.  It works well with a can of diced tomatoes too - I tried that when I realized I had no fresh ones.

This is a nice change from the run of the mill chicken dishes. It is even better the next day.  The only thing I had trouble with was that the peppers and tomatoes cooke up into nothing.  But overall this was very good.

I thought this recipe was rather bland to be considered "New Orleans". I had to add cajun seasonings. I don't think I would make again.

This was wonderful!  A big hit for dinner!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into a little larger than bite-sized pieces.  I also used one pound of turkey kielbasa.  I did not add the rice to the pot, however, as my family prefers their rice separate.  I had no problem with it thickening without the rice either and that was with using two cups of fat-free chicken broth.  One can of diced tomatoes worked perfectly well as a substitute for the fresh tomatoes as mentioned by another reviewer.  It was amazing!  I couldn't get enough!  Definitely making this again!

Very tasty. My whole family loved even my little ones. My husband like a little spice so I added a little ground cayenne pepper to his plate. It was delicious, i will definately used this recipe again.

I was intrigued by the name (because I'm from New Orleans) but there is no heat in the dish. Easily added trust me! I swapped out the smoked sausage for Andouille and added cayenne pepper and the bottle of tabasco on the table. 

I thought the preparation was easy and the addition of the Allspice was a very nice touch. 

Other slight modifications I made were to nix the tomato (my partner doesn't like them) and used a green and red pepper instead of 2 reds. 

My daughter has already asked me to make it again this weekend!

Different taste than the usual.  For New Orleans to be in the name I was expecting a bit more cajun spices.  It was great but I did add some cajun spices into mine and I was generous.

This dish was pretty amazing! My sister and I made it for our boyfriends, who also really enjoyed it.  We did make some variations to the original recipe.  I used a can of tomatoes and added cayenne pepper, as a few of the other reviews mentioned.  Instead of 2 bell peppers, I used one and then used a large jalepeno in place of the omitted one.  I cubed the chicken up so that it would speed up the cooking process.

Overall I would highly recommend this dish and would definitely make it again.  It was spicy yet very flavorful and was a great comfort food.
