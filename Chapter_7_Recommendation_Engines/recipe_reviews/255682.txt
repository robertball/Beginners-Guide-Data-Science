I used a potato obrien mix instead of the potato rounds.  I would make it again, but maybe a little less potatoes.

This breakfast casserole was by far the easiest and flavor-filled I have ever made. I did adjust to the recipe by, changing a 1c. of milk to. 1/2c.  Vit.D milk and 1/2 heavy cream, also I cut in half and sliced about 10 red potatoes (sm. to med. sized) , soaking them in warm salted water for 20 min. while I prepared the bacon, sliced sausage links.

It was fairly good. I did it with chopped potatoes instead of rounds, but otherwise made it as above. The potato layer was pretty bland. I think next time I will season and butter the potatoes, and/or mix everything together instead of layering. But I made it to have a ready to go breakfast for the week, and it works fine for that.

I made this casserole for the first time when we had guests for Sunday brunch.  It was easy to make, beautiful presentation and delicious!!  Next time I will be sure to add more salt and pepper but otherwise, it was awesome.

We used turkey sausage instead of pork sausage and turned out just as good. Plus instead of the bulk sausage we used links. I thawed them and cut them into little rounds making spreading easier. For potatoes we used Ore Ida diced hash browns. Turned out fabulous and it is actually a very lite recipe.

I used the Ore Ida hash browns with onions and bell peppers since that was what I had, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  It took a little longer to cook than the recipe suggested but this is great for when you have company and need an easy fix breakfast.
