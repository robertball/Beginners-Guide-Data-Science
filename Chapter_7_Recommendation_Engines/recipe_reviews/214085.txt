I'm reviewing this reluctantly, as clearly the submitter and her family, and others enjoy this.  But this was really not very good, and after doing some looking, it seems that the proportions are "backwards" from  most  michelada recipes.  This had  one part beer to 3 of clamato -- the  majority of recipes  are showing 1 part clamato to 3 or 4 parts beer!  No offense, but to me, this ended up being  bizarre tomato juice, rather than a beer cocktail. I think I will try a more "straight" version, and honestly, I hope someone posts "the usual" version so that there's  better representation and choice regarding this drink.

The only changes I made are to use worchestershire sauce and fresh key lime juice instead of lemon and soy sauce.  You may also want to try it with an authentic Mexican beers like Modelo Especial or the like.  Great way to beat the Texas summertime heat!

A friend of mine made this for me from scratch using these ingredients back when I first started drinking, only she used worchestershire sauce instead of soy and lime juice instead of lemon juice. It's sort of like a Bloody Beer, only clammy. It's a must try at least once in your life. I have this at least once a summer. It's an acquired taste, but really a great spin on your usual summer drinks. NOTE: You can cut out the middle man and use Bloody Mary Mix, if you're low on ingredients.

This is actually a Canadian drink originally.  Up hear we called it a "Red Eye" Only we use a whole beer, fill the remainder of the glass with clamato and spice it up.

We make one similar to this, but we use worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, limes instead of lemons and instead of salt we use cajun seasoning.
An oyster bar we go to takes an additional step and adds one raw oyster and one cooked shrimp. It tastes better than it sounds.

I have had many versions of this ranging from just Clamato and beer to this well seasoned and flavored version. What I liked about this was that it tasted like a Bloody Mary, but more refreshing, and you can definitely drink more of them! i would say that the proportions are a little off - certainly it equals 16 oz, which is right for a mug, but after you add the ice, there is leftover. For two drinks, I doubled and mixed all the ingredients for the seasoned tomato juice, and split about 60% of it between two mugs that were filled with ice, then I had the seasoned juice on the side for the next round!

Instead of the soy sauce, a little pickled green olive juice or also have tried with a dash of red wine. Along with the lemon or lime, and the clamato & dash of tabasco.... proportion to taste.

We didn't have Clamato so substituted jarred "Better Than Boullion clam base" for these.  We used about 1/8 tsp to 1/4 tsp per michelada and mixed that up with the rest of the ingredients. They were delicious!

Made as written and it was awful.  Too salty with the soy and salty rim.  Wiped the salt off the rim and poured some into another glass and added way more beer.  Still tasted weird.   I prefer it made with Clamato, lime, Worcestershire and a dash of Franks Red Hot and a whole beer!

I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers that it's a must to use Worcestershire sauce and lime juice in place of the soy and lemon. Use your favorite beer.
