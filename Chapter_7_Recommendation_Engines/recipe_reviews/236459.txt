I doubled the vanilla extract and used 1/3 cup of powdered sugar. These are amazing!  Take note, the graham cracker gets mushy in the fridge, but still tastes great.  If you plan to refrigerate them, consider adding the graham cracker after.

I didn't have graham crackers (couldn't get any either since we are currently snowed in) so I just dipped and drizzled Godiva milk chocolate on them. I also mixed the filling in my food processor adding the hulled part of the strawberry. I suggest serving with a side of whip cream.

I found this recipe last spring. I've made them many times since and everyone loved them. A friend of my bf even wanted to pay me for making a couple of dozen for him to surprise his daughters. They are a little time-consuming but well worth the work in my opinion.

very good quick treat but take the time to wash and pat dry, then cut a flat spot at the bottom of the berries so they can stand upright, use a little more extract and a bit more cream cheese to make a not so "sicky sweet" finished product the  refrigerate.
I added a semi sweet ship in the center of the berry as an
unexpected surprise.

one thing I would do is to twist a paper towel and try and dry out lightly the inside of the strawberries before filling that way the filling doesn't slide out

Yummy, didn't use the graham cracker crust instead dipped base in chocolate, then added chocolate drizzle.   Amazing!!   For chocolate melt 1 1/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips with half tablespoon shortening in a double broiler.  Dip and refrigerate to set chocolate.  Use remaining chocolate for drizzle.

These are now a family favorite, the only thing I changed is I added mini chocolate chips to the filling, and skipped the graham crackers for me it got soggy to fast. Delish!

I have made these several times and have used different extracts. All of which turned out amazing. This week I am making a wedding cake for a friend, it is going to be a white cake, filled with strawberry cream, iced in fresh whipped cream and decorated with Choc. dipped cheesecake filled strawberries. I just know that she is going to love it.

These were delicious. But I did make a few adjustments. I used vanilla wafer cookies instead of graham crackers and dipped the base in milk chocolate. I would suggest tasting the filling before piping the strawberries. Because depending on the ripeness of the strawberries you may need to add more sugar to the filling.

I like someone's idea of drizzling them with chocolate, either milk or white chocolate (who cares... it's chocolate and strawberries and cheesecake!). This would make a nice valentines day surprise.

I made these and they were wonderful! They also looked really pretty!  This is a great way to have strawberry cheesecake without making a whole cheesecake, or for a party where people just want to nibble rather than having a whole piece of cheesecake! I dipped some in chocolate and drizzled some white chocolate over some.  Yum!

I wanted something cold for an appetizer/dessert for a Memorial Day BBQ.  These were perfect because of the color as well.  I do not like cream cheese, but I knew everyone else did.  All I can say is that they were devoured!  I added the mini chocolate chips like another reviewer suggested instead of the chocolate drizzle or graham crackers.  My husband said they might be his new favorite dessert.  Also, the hostess was packing up "to go" bags of salads, etc but said she was not including the couple of left over strawberries!  I did have quite a bit of filling left over, so no need for extra if you use more strawberries.  Thank you for this recipe - I will be making them often!

this recipe is very good and super easy. it took me a little more prep  now its time since i was just using a paring knife to core the strawberries, food processor to mix the cream cheese and sugar, and a ziplock bag for piping the cream. now its time to kick it up a notch and add some chocolate

I LOVED this recipe and it was so quick and easy to make! I doubled the vanilla and added more confectioners' sugar to my liking. I had to make sure the cream cheese was very soft, when added with the sugar it'll clump up if its not. I'm definitely going to make again!

I love this recipe it's so quick and delicious! I followed the directions and tips so I put it in the fridge for a bit, but instead of graham crackers I used brown sugar. It was really sweet!

Made these for 3 separate events now...they are a huge hit! Everyone has loved them!
Gonna make them again for another party tomorrow, but this time I am going to dip them in dark chocolate then dip the chocolate into the graham crackers before filling them with the cheesecake mixture.

YUM!  Have made this exactly by the instructions.  The next time I made it I added a tablespoon and 1/2 of high quality blue cheese crumbles which gave it a sweet, salty, and tangy flavor.  Really GOOD.

I plan on making these for tomorrow, July 4th.  The recipe seems foolproof enough.  I plan on topping with a couple of blueberries for the red, white & blue, instead of graham crackers.

I have made these. You can use flavored whipped cream cheese in a hurry, or just plain if you like less sweet.

I prepare berries & cream cheese in advance, refrigerate, then serve on a tray with a bowl of crushed graham crackers for dipping when ready to eat. Prevents soggy grahams.

I made these for a birthday party. They were amazing and a big hit!  Takes a little time but it is easy and fun and well worth it! I used large berries and it was easy to scoop out the middle with the melon baller.  Graham cracker topping can get soft so dip/dust them right before serving.

I made these today but instead of doing the hollowed volcano I cut the berry lengthwise and hollowed them out like boats, and filled them with the filling. Instead of using the crumbs I made gramcracker crust "sails" (actually just pieces of crust broken off a whole sheet I made). Plus im hopping this solves the problem others mentioned inregards to soggy crumbs they are going to sit for a night in the fridge and I won't be there to add them later. Oh I also squeezed a splash of lemon into the filling too just so it wouldn't be to sweet or cheesy.
Update: the crust didn't get to soggy, but these Dont look as pretty the next day so i recommend making day of otherwise the berry drys out a little bit.

I just made these this evening as a test for a tea party. I saw this recipe and just happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I will definitely bring these to the party.  They are delicious.  I did add a tad more sugar for my taste. I am going to make variations, chocolate covered, and also dipped in nuts.

Amazing Mother's Day Hit! I made 3 trays for Mother's Day and They were a smash!  I used 16 oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla and more than a cup of powdered sugar (to taste).  I drizzled/dipped with chocolate almond bark. Put the bottoms of the strawberries on the top of some just because I thought it was cute.  My 10 yr old helped and we made 2 lbs. I'm making them again for Father's Day because not everyone got some!

I just made 50 of these in a little more than a half hour.  After I piped the cheesecake mixture in I dipped each in mini chocolate chips.  They are for a high school class snack tomorrow if they last--the one I tasted was excellent.  

This is a great spring dessert treat.  I can't wait to try them when the local strawberries are in.

These are simple and delicious. Instead of regular graham cracker crumbs I use chocolate graham crackers and break them into small pieces then I stick them in prior to o serving. Yummy!!!

I didn’t use graham crackers because I’m not a fan of them. But they’ve been a hit at church dinners! Never have any left to bring back home.

I loved the creamy taste of the sweet cream against the tart strawberry that was a good collaboration. And the crumbs added a nice crunch to the fruit not too crunchy but not too soft.

Made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. I substituted the vanilla for 2T cointreau and drizzled melted chocolate over the finished berries. He loved them, and they came together really quickly, which was great for me.

Absolutely loved it. Tried making my own piping bag out of a zip lock gallon size bag and maybe the filling wasn't soft enough but it blew out the side of the bag so I used the tiniest measuring spoon to fill the strawberries. Tasted amazing will definitely make it again:-)

These were easy to do, very tasty and well received.    I served them on a huge tray along with other white and dark chocolate covered strawberries.    Would send a photo, but I don't know how.

I actually made chocolate covered strawberries and left the graham crackers out. I just made the cream cheese filling. Per other reviewer’s suggestions I only added 1/3 cup confectioners sugar and I’m so glad I did - it was already sweet enough with just 1/3 cup. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1/2 tsp. Delicious! It complimented the chocolate covered strawberries so well!! Was a hit with my dinner guests!

These were a hit at my 4th of July barbeque.  I didn't have graham cracker crumbs so I drizzled chocolate on them.  I did like others suggested and let the cut strawberries dry and cut the bottoms off so the stood.  I had more filling than I had prepared strawberries so I cleaned a few more.  Those few strawberries that were not allowed to dry were harder to fill because the cream cheese would not adhere.  Presentation: 5  Taste 5

WOW!!!  just..  WOW!  made them for a small gathering and they were gone before the entrée was!!  even my die-hard cheesecake fan hubby was impressed!!  this is going to be a staple in my house every strawberry season.  made one small change... didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up several LORNA DUNE  cookies, and dipped them in the crumbs,, they didn't get mushy as some other reviewers aid,, and were very pretty.  definitely a keeper!!  thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! my only recommendation would be to core the strawberries before you make the filling and the gram crackers are not necessary, they're still just as good without them. Ill definitely be making these again!!

Full of flavor! I added the graham cracker crumb on top of the cheesecake stuffing and topped it with a blueberry.  Was exactly what I was looking for, for the 4th of July BBQ.

Very popular at the house. I added a little extra vanilla extract and a 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk to make it a little thinner. I then dipped it in chocolate almond bark and let it harden on wax paper. It helped to keep the strawberries from rolling around and tasted great.

Didn't change a thing.  Didn't need to.  Easy and spectacular.  Better once they sit in the fridge for an hour or two.

Forgot to even read the recipe thoroughly...whoops! I didn't add vanilla and just folded the sugar into the cream cheese, stuffed the strawberries, and topped with pre-crumbled crumbs, and it was delish!

It's delish!! I drizzled the strawberries with Chocolate Hard Shell after filling them and placing in the frig for about 30-45 minutes. Then returned them until ready to serve. These have become a popular staple in our house.

I cheated and bought a piece of real cheesecake, whipped it up with a little almond milk and piped it into the strawberries. Delicious!

I cut the strawberries in half since they were large, this made them easier to eat. These were surprisingly easy to make. The taste was very good. I tried them drizzled with chocolate and found it overpowered the great taste of this recipe as it is written. My guests loved them both with and without the chocolate.

I doubled the vanilla, and added a little extra powdered sugar, plus drizzled a melted Hershey bar over them. Yummy!

This is so delicious! I made the recipe as written, but I was using it as a dip for my kids' Popchef creations, so I had to add a little milk since it was too thick for a dip.
Amazing, big hit!

And since the strawberries were delicious dipped in it, I'm sure stuffing them with this would be just as yummy. :)

Yummy little morsels! Instead of vanilla I used a few drops of lemon extract and a bit of orange bakery emulsion.
