This combination of shrimp and avocado was great! I used uncooked shrimp instead and incorporated some S. TX necessities. I cooked whole shrimp in the chicken broth along with diced onion, garlic, celery, red pepper and 1 habanero pepper (seeded). I removed the shrimp when cooked and set aside and diced. I then added the whole milk and brought the temp up slowly cooking the the veggies. I then added the diced avocado (more than called for) and  shrimp and used the stand up hand mixer in the pot itself to puree about half of the ingredients. I added in the following spices along the way: Salt, Pepper, Old Bay Seasoning and Cumin to taste. I also added in a dollop of sour cream and minced cilantro to the bowls. Yummy!!! Boyfriend was dubious of the combination but LOVED it!

A very nice soup to play with - I added 1/4 tsp of Cayenne, 1 tbsp of dried cilantro, used cream instead of milk and then pureed it

Great recipe William! I added a little twist to the original recipe.  I put the cut avacado,and cooked shrimp in the food processor till it became a paste and then put it in the sauce pan  together. the flavor of your recipe is great! And I can't believe how fast and simple it was! Just my kind a cookin!! thanks!

I love avocado and shrimp together, so I was really excited to try this recipe. The bright green color was nice but the taste of the soup left much to be desired. Nobody in my family would eat a full bowl. 
I am only giving it two stars,  because it may have potential as a cold soup. Warm, not so much.

Used 4 avocados, sauteed onions with one whole jalapeno and one serrano, diced small, then added 1/2 t cumin and the broth and the milk. After it came to a boil I added chopped imitation crab (on hand) and diced tomatoes.  Pureed that BRIEFLY with hand blender, and served it with lemon sour cream and diced tomatoes.  I did just about triple the salt and double the lemon as otherwise would have not been "bright" enough in flavor.  This one is a hit.

Overall, a very good soup.  I'm always on the lookout for creamy soups that aren't loaded with butter or other thick dairy products.  With a few minor adjustments, this soup fits the bill.  If you're trying to make this a little bit healthier or lower cal, skim milk does work.  Made as directed, I found the soup bland, so I added some fresh cilantro and old bay seasoning.  I did not puree the mixture, but I mashed the avocados thoroughly before heating, and I enjoy the chunks of shrimp - gives it texture.  Tasty soup!

I added old bay, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper  and some fleur de sel to smooth out the taste.  I also used 1 lb of shrimp and pureed half of it into the bisque.  1/4 pound I cut into chunks and put it into the bisque.  The remaining 1/4 I butterflied and grilled it,  basting with cilantro oil.

This was surprisingly good, I too used a food processor for the avocado, onion, and I used crab.  I also added some cayenne pepper, and hot sauce for some kick.  Hubby liked it, but kids didn't. I did and will make it again.

Not very flavorful, but rich.  Needs more salt and perhaps a touch of garlic.  I may experiment with this one more.

Its green colour makes it a very exciting and unconventional soup. I used crab flakes and a sprig of parsley to garnish. I also used a handblender an pureed the shrimp/avocado mixture in the pot while cooking, until smooth and you can't see anymore shrimp.

Delicious recipe! And very original!  Follow the recipe as read and add to your taste.  I recommend extra cilantro and garlic, but that's just me. ( :   If serving for a party recommend such garnishings on the side.

Very good, althought the number of servings is way off.  I scaled this recipe down to 4, and it MIGHT have made 2 servings, if they were small.  As it was it was a big bowl just for me!  I added cayenne to it for a little kick, and I mashed the avacado before putting it in, but everything else stayed the same.  Very good, thank you for a quick, easy, and delicious lunch!

This recipe is a little strange.  I followed the reviewers' advice and pureed the soup before adding the shrimp which turned it an unappetizing green color like pistachio pudding.  The taste was okay but very different. 
I think it would be better to just have chunks of avacado in the broth but even then, it's just a weird flavor to have in soup.

It is a pretty good recipe, but I think next time I'll make it I'll do some changes to it. First, the recipe definitely requires more spices - I added Italian, basil, garlic powder and more lemon juice then the recipe called for. Second, final result had too much chicken taste - that was, in fact, the dominant taste in the meal. So, next time I'll make it, I will use vegetable broth and add more avocados.

I'm not sure what happened to this dish for me, but it was really bitter when it was done. I was so excited to have a creative use to avocados, but this just didn't taste good. I'm giving it two stars becauses I'm pretty sure it was something I did wrong preparing it (any ideas?) but this was not good at all when I made it.

I wont make this again. I followed the advice of other reviews are pureed the avocado and the shrimp in my food processor...I think this was a mistake. I couldnt taste the shrimp at all! It would have been better off left in chunks...same goes for the avocado. I loooove avocado but I felt like both the shrimp and avo were wasted. I also didnt have any lemon juice on hand so ommited that. Also, it came out very thin and runny so as an attempt to thicken it up I tossed in some left over mashed potatoes I had in the fridge. This helped with the consistancy but maybe it was my fault. It probably tastes much better left alone.

I, too thought the soup was bland.  I pureed the ingrediants and added crumbled bacon to it. I will try it again with crab meat instead of shrimp.

I came across this recipe while searching for a different way to use some avocados I purchased as an impulse buy in our local price club--would have never thought of it on my own--thank you for a great recipe-literally took less than 5 minutes to make and its nutritious and yummy--two things that can be hard to come by. The only thing I did was substitute the whole milk with a little less than 2/3 cup organic plain soy and it still tastes great!
Again, thank you for sharing!

This was just an okay recipe for me.  I substituted lite coconut milk for the regular milk as it was what I had on hand.  Perhaps this made a bigger difference than I expected?

Tasted pretty good....but remember that avocados are a fruit...too many will make your tummy upset. We found out the hard way. I pureed the avocados in the bisque.

WONDERFUL!  Like other reviewers, I used a hand blender to puree all the incredients in the pot.  I added extra onion and lemon juice.  It had an incredible flavor and texture.  My guests couldn't get enough.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks so much!

Odd...there were chunks of avocado in the bisque.  Bisque's are silky, not chunky.  There was an overbearing flavor that stole the great taste of a bisque that sounded realllllly good.
On the flipside, my friend loved it.

This looks good; haven't tried it, yet, but i'd like to note, that, the avocado in a soup can add some bitterness to it; i have a wonderful avocado soup, and sometimes it has a bitter taste to it; couldn't discern if it's because of the avocado itself, or the cooking, which brought it. When it's w/o this bitterness, it's simply delicious. I'll try this one, cause i love the mix (shrimps & avocado). Dan.

Since I had to cook my shrimp, I reserved the resulting broth and used it instead of the chicken stock.  I used lime juice instead of lemon.  Since my avocados were really firm I puréed most of them with the milk and broth then added back the rest of the avocado and chopped shrimp.  I added a bit of cayenne as it simmered.  This is very rich and tastes decadent, but actually quite healthy.  Thanks!

I made this as written except I pureed the whole thing as other reviewers suggested.  I used whole milk and 10 oz avocado.  The next time I make it I might puree the half pound of shrimp and then add another half pound that isn't pureed.  I definitely did NOT get 12 servings.  I got 8 EXTREMELY small bowls.

This was a very delicious soup. I made some changes to it though. I added about 2 tsp minced garlic, used ground cayenne pepper instead of black, squeezed a lime as well as using 2 tsp lemon juice to it, used 1 tsp curry powder. AND I added a shot of clear tequila (no preference to clear, just what was on hand). And I used about 1/2 cup diced onion. I added all ingredients excluding milk, to blender and pureed until smooth and silky. I then transferred to a pot, mixed in the milk and heated it. It was DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for the recipe. I was very glad I used it as a base bcuz with my tweeking it was fabulous!

Thanks, William, for this delicious recipe.  Like many others, I pureed the avocado and most of the shrimp first.  The soup came out really well and was very unique.  I posted a summary of my experience with the soup to my food blog, At Our Table, at http://atourtable.blogspot.com, of course crediting you for the recipe.  Really good and different.

I pick the recipes, my husband cooks.  For this one he said, "This is the best soup I've ever made".  (And we've done quite a few!)  Just follow the advice of others and make sure to puree the mixture.  We also added a bit of seafood seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper.  Yum!

A very good soup.  I too, pureed the soup and it was smooth with a mild flavor - a bit like guacamole soup!

I really wanted to like this. When I had finished cooking it as directed, it had a strange bitterness that I've never tasted in either avocado or shrimp before, and was also very bland. From the flavor at that point, I would feel guilty serving it to people. I added a bunch of other seasonings as well as a little orange juice and lime juice to give it a bit of kick, and it improved the flavor enough that I felt comfortable putting it on the table. I heated up a couple of canned soups as well to make it a "soup bar" because I still didn't feel good about making this soup the only option. At the end of the meal, no one had eaten more than a single bite of this soup, preferring microwaved canned soup over this homemade soup with fancy-ish ingredients. I didn't even save it as leftovers. Again, I really wanted to like this soup, and figured it would be hard to go wrong with avocados and shrimp. Somehow, this soup is worse than the sum of its parts.

It's not terrible... but it's not great at all. The texture and flavors make a weird combination. It's good with something, like dipping bread into. I dont think I'll make it again though

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I subbed cream for milk and added a dash of garlic and cayenne for kick.

It's alright, but it needs a bit more oomph, IMO. I'd go richer with a roux and heavy cream for some of the milk, add some cayenne and some fresh chervil, and serve garnished with the reserved shrimp *and* some chopped smoked salmon. Because nothing goes better with avocado and shrimp than smoked salmon.

The only thing I left out was milk because it doesn't agree with me.  Soooooooo nice to eat a creamy soup without the cream.  This is a keeper

Shrimp and avocado = already the perfect combo! Blending it into a soup? Yes! I should have brought out some crumbled tortilla ships to add to the mix for a bit more texture. Very refreshing and seems to be served better chilled rather than hot. Would love to make these again as soup shooters!

Not bad once I added another avocado, added some seasoning, served it on bruschetta bread with sauteed shrimp and topped it off with lump crabmeat. Excellent appetizer!!!

This is a creamy, deliightful soup that I can see myself making again - repeatedly.  I did make a few small adjustments - added a bit of garlic salt, switched some of the milk for cream, and pureed the soup with an immersion blender before adding the shrimp.

I really loved this recipe but I added more ground black pepper and red pepper.  It gave it just the kick it needed.  I would suggest purple onion over white or yellow and make sure to puree the avocado and chop the shrimp for a smoother texture.

This was delicious!  After reading the reviews about blandness, I decided to make a few changes.  I sauted onions and garlic in olive oil before hand and added course salt, plus cut up the avocados in small pieces so there wasn't a big chunk without any flavor to it.  I would definately make this again!

It was okay. I may make it again, with some changes. 

As for what other reviewers have said - yes, try and add a little more flavor and it's probably best to puree the mix before you add the shrimp. 

Also, substituing coconut milk for milk... You didn't really expect that to turn out, do you? XD

A beautiful avocado, wasted.  We actually threw the pot of soup away.  It had a strange, unpleasant taste to it.

We liked this a lot. Even my guests who don't like avacado liked this, and were surprised to learn it is "avacado soup."
