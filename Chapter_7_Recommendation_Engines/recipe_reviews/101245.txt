My ex grew up in Hawaii and ate SPAM and eggs all the time. I developed a taste for it, but had only had it as SPAM and eggs. I never thought of grating it...thanks for the idea.

Its SPAM.  If you like it, you'll love this recipe.  If not, then it probably won't convert you. I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

I grew up on something similar to this.. I call them 'Spammiches'...... You grind or grate the Spam (or Prem, a Canadian version) and then mix in mayo, relish, onion, and other similar tuna- or egg-salad ingredients. Spread on hamburger bun halves, top with cheddar, and broil until toasty. My mom always served them open-faced. Yum!!
