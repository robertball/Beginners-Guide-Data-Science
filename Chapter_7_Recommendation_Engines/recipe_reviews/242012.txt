I used this for the steak seasoning called for in the Balsamic Roasted Pork Loin recipe on this website. Delicious!  Can't wait to try it on actual steaks on the grill.

I made a half a recipe, because I wasn't sure how we were going to like it. We liked it! We used it on rib eyes tonight, that hubs grilled to a perfect medium rare. I think this would be really good on chicken or ribs too.

Too salty as is.  The salt over-powered the other spices.  This recipe makes a huge amount, so I'm going to have to add more of  the other spices to thin out the salt rather than dump the whole thing.

I added 1 tbsp of Cayenne Pepper and 2 tbsp  of Hot Chili Powder  I will be making this again but will be trying it on pork chops or pork steaks. Maybe even some country style pork ribs.  At any rate, the next meat I use this on will be Pork.

I BBQ'd some rib steaks with this recipe.  Its easy, inexpensive, and tastes excellent. Its one of those rubs that you can keep around pre-mixed for a quick BBQ night and as good as a premixed supermarket steak spice.  I brushed on some olive oil on the steaks first to get some good adhesion and applied the rub with a shaker.

My family went crazy over this recipe which I used Top Sirloin and pounded to 1" thickness and grilled...  I decreased the salt 
 2 T vs. 3T and I have a great supply for future meals.

This was too mexican-ish tasting in my opinion.  If I make this again I will leave out the oregano and cumin and add my brown sugar.

I have to confess I didn't really measure ingredients on this one, but just used the list of ingredients and sort of tossed it all together.  It was super.  Zesty and delicious.  I look forward to making this again soon.

Amazing delicious rub!  We used it on prime rib tonight and we all loved it.  I made the spice mix without salt and pepper and seasoned the meat with salt and pepper first then added a generous amount of the spice mix after so I could control the salt content more easily.

NOTE: The ingredients and the amounts are NOT for two steaks or even four steaks.  It is for many steaks.  That's why you place all the spices into a salt shaker.  You mix the ingredients together to blend and then add them into the salt shaker.  You shake the shaker into the steaks and then follow the directions.  It also says kosher salt NOT table salt.  I think the problem some of the people thought that the 3 tablespoons of salt were actually being put on those poor innocent steaks.  Yes folks, 3 tablespoons of salt will kill you if it is being put on one or two or four steaks.  It is meant for many, many times of use.  So if you want to eliminate some of the salt, so do it.  This rub is meant to be used many times, not won time.  Good blend of spices compliment the steak..

To those that said this was too salty, you most likely used the wrong type of salt. This recipe calls for kosher salt and due to it's crystalline structure calls for a greater volume as opposed to finer sea salt. Even different brands of kosher salt vary. Diamond Crystal is what most seasoned chefs prefer and so 3 tablespoons is appropriate for this recipe. If using fine salt you should use 1/3 the amount but it's harder for dry rubs. Fine salt is for boiling applications. Never use iodinized salt either as it makes foods taste metallic.

Very good,  the entire family,  well everyone except a picky 4 year old little girl, loved it.   I'm usually skeptical of rubs on here,  but this tasted like something from a restaurant.

The rub was excellent. I made it for a roast pork recipe that called for a balsamic vinegar/steak rub mix marinade. Turned out perfect with a light smokey flavor to succulently tender meat.

used this recipe to marinate my sirloin when making cheese steaks. came out delicious! I went with the opinions of others and used half the salt and half the cumin and I could still taste the cumin a lot but it was perfect in taste. Adding more salt and more cumin would have made it way too powerful in cumin which is why I'm giving it a 4.

Excellent rub! One complaint, however. Three tablespoons of salt is just insane! WAY too much. I used one TBSP and it still was a bit saltier than I like. Otherwise this wonderful combination of ingredients really enhances a nice steak. I will use this again and again, I'm sure.

Amazing! Have used this rub on Steak and chicken and zero complaints here! Made a lot, we were able to use it many times before we ran out. Didn't use the entire mixture, lightly coated and let sit several hours-overnight (for steak).

The cumin overpowers everything else. Had to add more of the other ingredients to compensate. Once that process was done, it was quite tasty.

Made the rub for a t-bone steak on the grill. The cumin over powered everything except the salt. Because those were the only 2 ingredients I tasted which made this rub not very good in my opinion. So obviously I would drastically reduce or eliminate the cumin and reduce the salt by a third. Now I have to figure out how much of the other ingredients to add to save the rest of it.

Personally I loved it. I used top sirloin steak on the grill. I added about a tbsp of chili powder and did no brown sugar (I didn’t have it) and the outcome was amazing. I already ate one top sirloin and can’t wait to show my buddies at a house party! ?????? recommended

WAY, WAY too much salt. 
  
I try to always make a recipe exactly as written the first time, but this was disappointing...I questioned the salt quantity, actually wondered if it was a typo but went ahead with it.   Nearly ruined some very nice sirloin but managed to make it edible by scraping off most of the rub. 

If you make this GO MUCH LIGHTER ON THE SALT!!! Might be flavorful but hard to tell, the salt obliterates the rest of the seasonings.

Some reviews said it was too peppery and I'm not a big fan a lot of peppercorn, so I substituted them with cubebs. Outstanding favor, the smoked paprika had enough hotness and the cubebs gave a nice peppercorn flavor without the competing hot spiciness that peppercorn would give.  Diffidently sharing this with my friends.

Cooked this over the campfire this past weekend... Best steak I've had in my life, and at least 5 other people concurred. Definitely needs to be done on the grill to lock in that perfect smoke flavor. I used a tenderized rib-eye and due to some of the other reviews I only put in 2 Tbsp of salt. I also used a spicy smoked paprika to give that slight bite and extra smoke flavor. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this rub

Yes I gave this 5 Stars even tho I changed a few things. I didn’t use the oregano or the cumin & I used dark brown sugar.  This fit my family better & all the adults remarked about how good it was. I’ve since doubled this recipe, put it in a jar for the next time we have steak. And added plus, I used it on burgers!

The amount of salt proportional to the rest of the ingredients seem to be right.  The application instructions made our steaks way too salty.  The seasoning stays on depending on the thickness of the meat. OR, just use less of the seasoning, i.e. don't cover the meat.

I used the rub on my strip loin steaks and loved it. My girlfriend doesn't like spicy food that much so I used half the Cumin and half the pepper, it still gave a great flavor throughout the steak!!!

I give it 5 stars for versatility!  I've used it on steak (delicious) and also on pork (also delicious).  It may sound strange, but I also use it in a dressing for a quinoa/kale/black bean/corn salad I make - I combine the spice rub with a bit of oil, lime juice, water, and maple syrup and pour over the salad, let marinade a few hours.  Super good.  

The only thing I would mention is that, yes, as is it is probably too salty - I use about half or less of sea salt.

Very satisfied with this. Like some have said it is a little salty but then again I use this season very liberally. I've been using kosher course grain salt. I've used it on beef and chicken and me and the family loves it. I've made this about 5 or 6 times really enjoy the flavor.

As I didn't have sea salt on hand, I eliminated salt.  I used this in place of store-bought steak seasoning called for in the balsamic pork loin recipe, and it was perfect! :-)  I have some in a sealed glass container, which I'm thinking I might use to season hamburgers. :-)

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very tasty, but just a little too salty for my taste. Next time I'll use half the salt. Full disclosure: I have to reduce sodium intake for health reasons, so perhaps my taste buds are overly sensitive to salt. YMMV.

This is the 3rd time I've used this recipe and I feel like I've finally perfected it. The amount of ingredients calls for enough dry rub to rub down and entire slab of meat. I've cut the portions into 3rds and still have left over seasoning when feeding only 2 people. I also drastically reduce the amount of cumin because I'm not a fan. Overall, this is a recommendation!

I used this mix to grill thick, boneless pork loin chops and the flavour was amazing. The brown sugar caramelized beautifully creating great texture. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing.

This batch will last for a while, but it's a great steak rub. It's a bit spicy, but my husband and I liked it a lot.

Awesome!! I didn't have any cumin on hand so I used a few shakes of chili powder instead but kept the rest of the recipe exactly the same. My new favourite way to cook steak :)

Excellent dry rub! I normally use A-1 steak sauce on my steaks, but because of the dry rub, sauce wasn't necessary! I plan on using this rub again, but the salt can honestly be cut in half. Too much salt and it's a little overwhelming. But with that minor change, this dry rub is great!

Great steak rub, can really be used with any meat for grilling. After putting on Theron, I let the meat set for about an hour before cooking to let it soak in a little. Brush steaks with oil before throwing on the grill and you're good! Keeps really well in the cabinet. Just used the last of my first batch and will definitely make this again!

We would half the salt. Otherwise, tasty.

Used this on some tenderloin tails I had left over. Great flavor but I will definitely use less ground pepper than the recipe calls for. I don't mind the pepper so much because of the heat it brings, just that it seems to overpower the other spices. This is definitely a keeper though. I've used it on burgers and chicken breast since then with awesome results. Very versatile mix.

Delicious rub! We used it on 4 New York strip steaks and had tons left over. Can't wait to use it again the next time!

Great recipe! Used for the balsamic vinegar pork loin recipe as well . Have a batch on hand and use it in burgers. For Christmas, after brining a bone in pork roast, brushed on a mixture of mustard and ketchup. To this recipe, I added a half teaspoon cayenne pepper powder, and 1 tablespoon ground pure chili powder and quarter teaspoon Worcestershire  powder . Patted this on to the wet mustard ketchup. Smoked roast until done. It was fabulous!

Very tasty on a couple river steaks we made. I may tinker with it and add a little heat, but it is good as listed. Definitely a keeper.

I made this and there was enough for eight NY steaks plus leftover.  I will definitely be saving this recipe.
