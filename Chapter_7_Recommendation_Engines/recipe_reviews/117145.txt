Basic and dependable.  Just a few simple ingredients so you can feel confident this will complement just about any main dish rather than compete with it. Cooking the beans for just  five minutes was perfect. Left out the onion powder.

This was great!  We love green beans in our house.... and I love making them with mushrooms...and aside from this, whenever I sautee mushrooms for steak, I always do so with garlic.  I can't believe I never thought of combining both recipes!  I think I had more beans and 'shrooms than the recipe called for... so I had to add more seasoning and butter... but boy was this was awesome!  I used the stated 2 cloves of garlic despite my extra beans etc (our main dish was REALLY loaded up with garlic and onions so I wanted to keep this milder) and rather than the salt and pepper, I tossed in about 2 tsp of seasoned salt... that with the salted butter I used was enough... my kids gobbled them up and so did hubby.  Thank you for such a tasty idea!!

This was excellent.  The flavors of the green beans, mushrooms and garlic were very distinct.  I used olive oil and steamed the green beans (takes a little longer).  So in the future I will saute the vegies right before the beans are done.

Tasty, easy recipe.  I would like to try it with exotic mushrooms rather than the plain old button kind and maybe a little fresh onion.

I made this for my family, but i used 3 cloves of garlic, and it was wonderful. I recommend this very highly. Easy to make, and very enjoyable.

I've had this recipe for awhile and it's scrumptious. I especially like it in the summer when green beans are in season. Not something for a first date though - garlic breath is guaranteed! One tip - I always save the cooking liquid when I boil the green beans (or any other veggie), then freeze and use it to make soup stock later.

This was flavorful and delicious!  The only thing I would do different next time would be to put in only a pinch of salt.

Loved this one! Doubled this one to ensure leftovers. Steamed beans until crisp/tender, also used a butter/olive oil combo for cooking the mushrooms and garlic. Great flavors here and super yummy. Will most definately make again. ps...I hate trimming fresh grean beans....but this was so worth it. Thanks!

Not very often does the vegetable get all the compliments at dinner time.  This one did however, very tasty.  Used a mixture of white and baby bella mushrooms.  I also left out the onion powder.

Love this recipe because the beans remain the star of the dish with the other flavors subtly in the background.  Only thing I did differently was to cook the beans for only 6 min. and used olive oil instead of butter.  Wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  Green beans weren't in season when I made this recipe so I used frozen and it still turned out great.

I used portabello mushrooms and fresh green beans from the garden and my family thought this was fabulous.  I used some gourmet seasoning mix (Mt. Elbert All Purpose Seasoning from the Savory Spice Shop in Colorado).  It was a perfect recipe for precious garden green beans!

Very delicious...everyone raved about these green beans.  I liked the fact that I could make favorable green beans without using any type of meat to season.

I made a few changes.  Replace water with chicken broth for more flavor, added a little garlic powder for more garlic taste and also a splash of teriyaki sauce while the beans were heating through.  This will be one of my go-tos from now on.

Sat. April 07, 2012, I prepared this recipe for myself. I added fresh sliced up white onion. I substituted Smart Balance Omega for butter. I steamed my fresh green beans or "snap beans" and boy oh boy those tasted great. I have never cooked green beans before. This is a very easy recipe and cleanup was OK. I ate the whole thing and I did not get belly swelling from these fresh ingredients. Allrecipes.com, I will be using your recipes. I like very much the PRINTOUT OPTIONS. I used extra large print and that was really nice to read. I give this recipe 5 stars. Signed: shirley73yrs

we enjoyed these beans! i think 5 minutes of boiling/steaming is plenty, and 8 leaves them too mushy.  i also would double the garlic next time for added flavor.  these are very simple to make and it's a flavorful recipe that doesn't destroy the nutritional value of the vegetable.  thanks!!

Loved the simplicity! However, I added more mushrooms (for protein) and more garlic cloves and pepper to give it a kick.  Served it with herbed tomato whole wheat pasta in olive oil :)

We made this in lieu of the traditional green bean casserole with mushroom soup and it was a hit!  I think we have just created a new tradition.

I thought I reviewed this last night....whoops. I cut this recipe in half and used the full amount of garlic and a mixture of butter and extra virgin olive oil. I did not add the salt.  I really liked this but I think this would have been better with a bit of sliced onion sauteed in with the rest of the vegetables. My family didn't care for it much. Even so, I'll make this again maybe just for me. Using fresh beans is crucial.

I really liked this recipe!  I didn't change a thing...because wouldn't it be a different recipe then?? I tend to favor recipes that have lots of reviews so I was hesitant to try this.  However, since it had 2 of my favorite ingredients (green beans and garlic), I decided it was worth a try. It had great flavor, but it was not overpowering...and it didn't taste like it came off a corporate website.  Simple and delicious!  Thanks for sharing it...I will make it again!

Unlike the other reviewers, I was disappointed with this. I found it greasy and bland. Not terrible - just not great either.

Very easy and tasty!  A few changes I made:  canned mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh, garlic powder because once again, no fresh on hand, and I added a little extra butter once I added the green beans to the mushrooms because it didn't really seem to coat.  It's great for a quick side dish!

Excellent! These are so good. I will be making these again. Green beans are among our favorite veggies, and I am always looking for ways to change them around instead of just the same old southern style, and steamed and roasted. The ingredients went together so well. It was a marriage made in Heaven.

I made this for myself with a much smaller amount of freshly picked beans, and I microwaved them for a minute instead of boiling. I used onion instead of onion powder and Smart Balance instead of butter. They were just wonderful. I will make this again for company.

Wow! .. this was a Fabulous... my teenaged son said "OMIGOSH!, those are good... I know your'e making them for the picnic.. but can I have some with dinner?!?"   I added extra garlic and pepper... and instead of butter- I used expeller pressed coconut oil !(the kind that doesn't have any nutty smell)

I loved this dish and will make it all the time now instead of plain old BORING green beans!  I steamed the beans and added a little olive oil to the mushrooms.  Served at a dinner party and got many compliments.  Thanks :)

Doubled the mushrooms, added a little olive oil.  Tasty, relatively healthy side dish.

Delicious and really simple to do.  Seems like it would be really easy to alter too.

Altered just a bit. Used 4 cloves of garlic because we love garlic. Olive oil instead of the butter and added a sprinkling of crushed red pepper to taste. Great ingrediants and flavors! Definitely worth trying. Will make again.

Wonderful and easy. I used baby portabella mushrooms and added a tad more garlic.  Delish!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I didn't love this recipe. But I think it just might not have gone well with my other side dishes.

I changed it up because I did not have all of the ingredients available.  I did not use mushrooms, added diced onions and some leftover marinated tomatoes.  Yummy!
