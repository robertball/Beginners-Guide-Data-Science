This was REALLY good for being so simple (I didn't go the low sodium route, but used the same basic ingredients). I used ciabatta bread and pressed it in my waffle iron--who knew?! This will likely become a standard in our house.  Curious about adding tomatoes.

Great recipe! Its quick and easy and cheap for starving college students such as myself.  I also added tomatoes to it.
