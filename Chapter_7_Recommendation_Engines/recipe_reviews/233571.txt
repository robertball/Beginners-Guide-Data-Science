These turned out really great. I only had one 8oz. package of cream cheese and that was plenty, honestly I think too packs would be too rich for our taste. I always use my pressure cooker for cooking the chicken when making enchiladas, so much easier and chicken turns out so moist and easily shreds. I put some of the cumin in with the chicken and used a bit less in the mixture. I did top with black olives, more green onions and cilantro. These were full of flavor and my husband said to make these again.

This is really creamy and really good!  I too only used one package of cream cheese, and I substituted jalepeno for the green chilies, but only because we like a little heat.  I only used about half of the can of diced tomatoes, but that is just a personal preference as well.  Very tasty...Mexican food is my "comfort food", and this definitely fills the bill!

Delicious, but I tweaked it based on what I had in the house! Very forgiving recipe. You could alter it to be much hotter or very mild for little kids. I love that! I only used 8 oz. of Cream Cheese (all I had) and then added 1/2 cup of Non Fat Greek Yogurt. I forgot the Cilantro and green onions. Didn't miss either. I used most of a Costco Chicken that I had pulled the white meat off the bird and shredded. I used Costco Shredded Jack and Cheddar Cheese, (all I had)! I made the filling mixture earlier in the day and refrigerated it until I was ready to assemble. It let the flavors come together. You could absolutely make the whole thing in advance, drop to room temperature, and then bake for dinner! I'm really happy with the way it came out. DH ate two huge plates. I served it with Mexican Rice and a Fresh Corn, Red Onion and Tomato Salad with Goat Cheese and Garlic. Tons for left overs. This was really good.  Thank you for a recipe that was totally different from what I usually make!

The cream cheese really overpowered the dish. I do think the cream cheese added something to the enchiladas, but it was too much. I will make again with only one block. I think it would taste much better.

I had some leftover chicken mixture so I added some sour cream and enchilada sauce and turned it into a yummy dip. I also made nachos with tortilla chips and shredded cheese on top baked in the oven.

I wish I had read the reviews first! I used the full amount of cream cheese and it was too much. I also feel like it could have used more chicken. Otherwise, the flavor was good and it was super easy to make! I didn't use cilantro because I dislike the flavor. And I agree that the green onions could use a slight sauté beforehand. It was a bit abrasive to bite down on one.

Okay so I'm not really a recipe follower, I usually just use them as a guide and this is an excellent recipe that you can adjust to your tastes. I was craving some Mexican and this hit the spot. I followed other reviews and only used 1 package of cream cheese, which was plenty. I also boiled my chicken with a bouillon cube and some cumin. I had a bell pepper so I diced that up with a small sweet onion and cooked those down and added it to the chicken mixture. It really added to the flavor and I would recommend doing that if you're interested. Lastly I used a lot more cilantro just because why not? I didn't have any chiles or canned diced tomatoes so I just added salsa to keep it mild. It was delicious and we gobbled these up with sour cream, Mexican rice, and refried beans. My husband said these were better than the restaurant we usually go to and I have to agree. This makes 10 good sized enchiladas so we had leftovers for the next day, which were even better! Even my toddler liked them! Thanks for the great recipe!

It was delicious I made it just the way the recipe told me to. Despite the other reviews I would not change a thing. If you like the Slight Chrispness of fresh green onion and cilantro you will love this recipe.

Great recipe but didn't give 5 stars because a bit too rich for me. I think next time I make it I will follow others advise and use 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and add some sour cream. I will make again.

I tweaked this recipe a little due to my family not liking peppers. But I was very impressed!  Super easy and super good. Def going to save and make again.

My wife has been the enchilada maker for decades. But I've branched out and have made them a couple of times. These are so delicious they are going into my "make again" file. All of the flavors pop. The green onions, the cumin, the garlic - these get a full-throated five stars!

Easy to follow. I substituted corn tortillas for the flour and added sour cream to the green enchilada sauce.

Way too rich for us. I would cut back the garlic from 4 to 2 as the garlic flavor was way overwhelming. Would also only use 8 oz cream cheese.

I work 8-5, so the only thing I did differently was I put a package of chicken thighs in crock pot on low for 8 hours.  The meat came out great!  The recipe just gave it the right spices and the meal turned out Awesome !  Thank you!!!

I halved the cream cheese based on other reviewers. I also only used 3 cloves of garlic and about half the onions. The cream cheese portion was good, but the garlic was over powering and the onions a bit too intense for me.

I may try again with no garlic or just 1 clove. Also, in hindsight, I shouldn't have used the white parts of the onions or cooked them a bit first to take out some of the harshness.

Overall it's not a favorite of mine, but I that's probably more my taste than the recipe's fault!

I loved this recipe.  I used cream cheese with chive and onion because it was all I had and I used more cheese.  Other than those changes, all was great.  I will make these again.  Thanks

I followed the advice of some reviewers and only used 1 block of cream cheese. It wasn't enough for me. I would have liked it to be creamier, so next time I'll follow the original recipe. The only other change I made was to substitute salsa for the diced tomatoes. It was delicious and will definitely be a regular addition to my recipe rotation.

Great flavor, but mine turned out drier than I like.  I did use red enchilada sauce instead of green chile, maybe that is what did it.  Will make it again, but with more sauce.

This recipe is delicious.  I followed the instructions as written with the exception of only using one block of cream cheese.  That seemed to be the consensus of the reviews.  Additionally, I used low carb tortillas and they cooked great.

This is by far and away our favorite Enchilada recipe. I prefer to mix 1 can of red enchilada sauce with 1 can of green sauce, it is just a bit tastier to us. Delicious and quite easy to make.

Excellent.  Only two of us so we had left overs for the next day.  It was hard to stop eating more than one or two servings, because it was so good!  Only changes I made was using one block of the cream cheese as suggested and used corn tortillas instead of flour. I'll definitely make this again.

Good basis! I did make additions so I couldn't give it 5 stars since it wasn't exact. I added taco seasoning to the meat, I only used 1 package of cream cheese, I mixed all sauces together except 1/4 c green sauce. I also added all the cheese except a small handful. After filling, I topped with the remaining sauce and cheese, along with jalapenos! Delicious!!

Delicious! We have made it several times. It freezes well and I heat up my serving in the toaster oven to crisp. I add some Herdez Salsa Verde when serving.

I used red sauce instead of the green sauce because thats what was in my house.  I made the recipe exactly as written other than that.  it really was just ok.  I was actually disappointed. it was too creamy and not spicy enough for me.  I think adding some taco seasoning would have helped.  Anyway, probably won't make it again.  My family wasn't that impressed either.

It was a hit with my family! I will definitely make it again. The flavor was perfect and I wouldn’t change anything. I actually forgot to put the lime juice in, so I sprinkled it over the top with the enchilada sauce and it still turned out great. Maybe those who want to reduce the recipe to one block of cream cheese were using small chicken breasts. My chicken breasts were huge - about the size of two small breasts each.

The only change I made to this was that I used fresh pablanos from the garden and fire roasted them first.  I also boiled the chicken in some tequila and lime juice - used the leftover broth for the Mexican Quinoa recipe also on Allrecipes.  Both were great.  This enchilada recipe is very good and my family enjoyed it a lot!

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo church potluck and everyone loved it!  I did make a few changes to use what I had on hand.  I used salsa instead of the canned tomatoes and green chilis.  I used regular onions instead of green onions.  I also only used one block of cream cheese to make it healthier and the consistency was perfect.  Two blocks would have been too much.  I added a can of drained black beans to increase the health factor.  I will definitely make this again!

I agree with the other reviewers that the cream cheese was a little much. What was much worse then that was the salt. It was so so salty I had to throw them away.
Next time I will use 1/2 the cream cheese and 0 salt.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used 1 8-ounce block of cream cheese, and I added some olives on top.  This was a great way to use my home canned chicken breast - I just mixed one pint of canned chicken with one 15-ounce can of black beans to use in place of the cooked chicken in the recipe.

I have a standard chicken enchilada recipe I have used for over 40 years. This recipe has made its way up to the top of my 'favorites' list. The green enchilada sauce and cream cheese are the additional goodness to a popular recipe..

The "cream of chicken soup" version of green enchiladas are so much better tasting.  They have much better flavor and consistency. I usually love cream cheese but it wasnt good in enchiladas.

I also used less cream cheese, about a quarter less. My family loved the recipe. I have made chicken enchiladas before but they always seemed to be lacking something. All these ingredients are perfect. It is even better the next day.

I cut back on the lime juice to about a Tablespoon and added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also only ended up using about 1 & ~1/2 chunks of cream cheese instead of two full ones.

Great recipe.  For the chicken, I marinated it in Mojo.  I highly recommend 24 hrs.  The longer the better, but 4-6 is do-able.    Can be found in the ethnic aisle or sometimes with the other marinades, usually on the top shelf.   I cooked the chicken in a skillet rather than poaching per the directions. My sister made a Mexican Cheese Ball for a family get-together the Sunday after Christmas.  It was one of those pre-packaged mixes that you just add to cream cheese or sour cream.  There was so much left, I took it home  with the intention of using it for my New Years Eve party.  Well when I came across this recipe, I decided to use it since the cream cheese was already flavored (and it was a tad over 8 oz and after reading reviews seemed it was the perfect amount - I changed the recipe qty to 8).  I did add the cumin, but omitted Salt & Pepper.  I also sauteed a half finely chopped onion to add to the chicken mix and  used an additional can of green enchilada sauce on the bottom of my pan.

Fixed this for company tonight.  Used only one brick of cream cheese.  Used costco roast chicken. Company raved about it, and ate everything. No leftovers.  A keeper.

Really good. I used leftover chicken and because it wasn't 3 lbs I cut back on other stuff. Its pretty hard to mess up when you just adjust to your own taste. Cut back on lime, hate cilantro, used jack cheese instead of cheddar.If I would change anything maybe a bit less garic.

I thought this was good. I agree that one package of cream cheese is enough. I think that the onions and garlic need to be blanched prior to adding them in. They are two raw.
