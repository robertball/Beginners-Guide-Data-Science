We added cut up left over pork roast. If you add a tablespoon of cornstarch, the eggs do not spread as much. Very good!

This was great...just like we had at a restaurant!  I thickened a can of chicken stock, garlic, and parsley for gravy.  Using a can of Chinese veggies was easier than chopping everything, though.  Very tasty!

I tried this recipe on a whim without any real expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I revised the vegetables to my liking, but kept everything else the same, made some gravy for on top and YUM!  Just like my favorite restaurant.

This was great.  The celery, onion, and especially the bean spouts keep the calories down.  There is no cheese, so it is extremely low fat.  My kids looked at it with a great deal of suspicion, but wolfed it down after a tenative taste.  We found it was best with a bit more salt and some garlic/chili sauce to give it a bit of kick.  The bites with more fresh ginger were also better, so in the future, I will probably add more.  I've also considered some fresh garlic.  Give it a try for a great low-calorie start to your day.

Very good! I did not have any cooked ham but I did have some char siu (Chinese-flavored barbecued meat). I used half of a green bell pepper and half of a red bell pepper, chopped, for color and texture. I grated the ginger instead of slicing it to fry in oil. I also added a little hawaiian sea salt and fresh ground black pepper for taste. I cooked about 7 good size omelets total. These were easy to prepare and tasty. You can use other vegetables in place of these and add different types of meat or use shrimp. Usually egg foo young is served with chinese hot mustard mixed with soy sauce instead of soy sauce or gravy. This defintely tastes like the ones I grew up eating only better!

Come on. Be honest. Isn't there just something inherently FUN about fixing something that is fun to SAY? Anyway, as three added bonuses, this was easy, quick, AND tasty. We had this with Thai chili sauce. Nice blend of supper/breakfast tastes. So, what would that make it? Supfast?

My kids' first encounter with egg foo yung, and they loved it! Looked elsewhere on the Internet for a brown sauce recipe to serve over the omelets. Hit the spot! (Next time, will add more beansprouts -- we love beansprouts!)

Excellent dish.  Some think it will have a strong onion taste but it did not.

When I lived in Hawaii I often bought dinner from the local Chinese cafe and they always offered hot mustard mixed with soy sauce for the egg foo young. I still use it to this day on egg foo young it gives it that extra zing.

Excellent.  Have made following recipe exactly and have done it with using random veggies.  Always good.  Also, use the ginger in the tube found in produce dept.

Loved it! Only minor hassle was in the skillet cooking  the omelets. Perhaps 1 more egg added would have allowed the veggies to stick together better, or had I used a small skillet (rather than medium size). Nevertheless, great taste, great calorie count.

Very tasty and filling. I only used 3 egg yolks to help cut the cholesterol and nobody noticed the difference. Will definately make this again.

This was really good. My family LOVED this dish. The only change I made was to substitute red bell pepper for green bell pepper. I will be making this again for sure.

Sounded like a wierd combination, but actually very good. I loved it with the suggested sauce of spicy mustard and soy sauce on top! Also, very easy to make!

I cut the recipe in half and did not use mushrooms; otherwise made as directed.  We have never eaten Egg Foo Young before, so cannot make a comparison.  It seemed to be a different variation of an omelet,  we did enjoy the fresh ginger root and bean sprouts.  Served with homemade plum sauce on the side.  Thanks for sharing something new for us to try, INDIT.
