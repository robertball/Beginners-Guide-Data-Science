Really good! I halved the recipe and got 17 balls. Next time I will use half the sugar, as dates are really sweet already.

These are excellent. My husband doesn't like dates and really liked them too. I did cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup, as dates are sweet, and may cut even more next time. I did use unsweetened coconut, that's all I had, and didn't miss the extra sweetness. I will be making again, often.
