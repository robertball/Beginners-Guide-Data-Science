Tangy Pork Chops Haiku: "Marinate all day, let that flavor seep on in, then I had to bake." Too cold to grill and I couldn't subject my gorgeous, thick Costco pork chops to the George Foreman, so I 1. marinated them in the above ingredients for 8 hrs., 2. quick browned them 3 min./side in cast iron skillet, 3. moved skillet to 350 deg. oven for 20 min. til temp reached 145, and 4. removed and let them rest for 10 more min. b4 serving. O Mmmmmm G, these were really good pork chops; can't wait for spring and to be outside on the patio grilling them!

I didn't have time to marinade, so I  just pan seared the pork chops with salt and pepper, then poured the marinade on them like a sauce,  so delicious !!  Also I was out of apple juice so I substituted half lemon juice and half orange juice.

It was delicious as a marinade. I let the marinade sit for 45 minutes and baked the pork chops at 400 deg for 15 min instead. They were juicy and tender, and delicious.

Really good!  I left out the garlic powder, but did sprinkle Weber Steak & Chop seasoning over the tops while grilling.   Quick, easy and ingredients that I always have on hand!  Due to the time of year, I grilled them on an indoor grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe if you like chops with a great flavor and short prep.  10 minutes to get the marinade mixed, then let sit the longer the better....

Found this on Sunday, made the marinade and marinated them overnight for Monday’s dinner.  Didn’t do it on an outdoor grill cause I like in an apartment so I did it on my counter top grill thing...... WHOA! SOOOOO GOOD! I’m making them again tonight (Tuesday) lol Can’t wait till I can actually make them on a BBQ.

A  pretty good marinade but I would like a bit more zip to it.   I doubled up the recipe because I thought more was needed to bath the chops in.   I marinated overnight and I added in about 1/4 tsp of pepper.   I found the ketchup to be a bit distracting and would have preferred less sweet.   Maybe tomato paste?

Great marinade. I left them overnight and, grilled, they were incredibly juicy. Next time I'll increase the vinegar and the Worcestershire by a tbsp and add the same in sugar. I like a strong tanginess. Having said that, this is a really, really good recipe and I recommend it?

Really delicious sauce. I cooked in in a cast iron skillet, since my  grill was out of commission, but delicious all the same.
