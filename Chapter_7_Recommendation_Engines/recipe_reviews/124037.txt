i made this twice.  the 2nd time i made slight changes and everyone liked it much better.  i simply added 2 big pieces of garlic minced, and a tad more salt and cheese into the mixture.  i also baked the pie shell for a few minutes before putting the mixture into it.  delicious!

Outstanding on flavor, aroma, looks! I substituted lo fat cottage cheese, and fat free 1/2 & 1/2, and used just a pinch of salt.  I also  precooked the pastry shell, then protected the edge with foil while baking the spinach pie so they wouldn't burn.  Next time I'm trying it with egg beaters.  I think one of the nicest things about this recipe, for those of us who must restrict our diets, is that it uses healthy ingredients that aren't loaded with salt & fat (like sausage) & the heavier ingredients can be exchanged for similar lo fat or fat free without taking a hit on flavor.  Thanks Pam!

I love spinach and this was tasty!  I didn't have the nutmeg, cream, butter or onion so I just omitted those and made it without.  I added extra parmesian and used skim milk instead of cream, and used a homemade crust.  It came out really delicious.  If you wanted to cut calories you could make this without the crust as well, just use some non-stick spray on the bottom of the pie pan.  I will be making this healthy dish again!

yum! i made this for brunch at a baby shower and it was a hit. several people asked me for the recipe and there were no leftovers. i made individual ones in muffin tins but using a cup to cut circles in the pastry dough and fitting it down inside before adding the filling. one batch made about a dozen muffins.

EXCELLENT Spinach Pie recipe.  I am a big fan of spinach pies and I'm glad that this one is healthier than most.  I did not use cream because I didn't have any and it turned out great.  I also used a pound of fresh spinach with I sauteed, instead of frozen spinach.   I will use this recipe again.

WOW! Soooooooo good. I made this for christmas... i should have made two! My husband normal reaction.... "why? why can't you ever make normal people food? It's always gotta be vegetable health stuff" He tasted it smiled and said it was so bad he had to protect the kids by eating the rest. Ha. He loved it and so did I. Perfect, it's going in my personal cookbook for good.

Tasty and simple to make. I used low-fat cottage cheese and taste and consistency was not compromised.  I added mushrooms which complemented the spinach well.  I might experiment with different seasonings but by itself, it worked quite nicely.

Easy, crowd-pleasing recipe.  I used about 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese and just a dash of nutmeg.  Delicious!

Very good and very easy.  I made with skim milk instead of cream to lower fat content, and consistency came out fine.  Also put in only a dash of nutmeg.  Really good!

This was so good!  It definitely needed a tablespoon or two of garlic, plus I added a cup of grated cheddar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onions. Other than those two slight changes I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit at Easter. You can bake this ahead of time as it is just as good at room temperature as it is hot.

I can't believe it! I had this exact same thing in a cozy little tea room for lunch one day and had been craving it ever since. This tastes just wonderful! It needs to bake for quite a while, but the prep work is very quick so your actual time in the kitchen is very short. I can't wait to make this again!!

This was very nice and light tasting. I believe I have made a recipe just like this in the past without using the pie crust. Thanks for sharing!

I made this over the weekend.  It turned out great.  I am not a big onion fan but they added a nice flavor.  Easy, quick and healthy!

This was a wonderful dish for a Sunday lunch.  I served with a green salad but it would go well with a fruit salad as well.  Like others, I used just a dash of nutmeg and some extra cheese.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I didn't prebake the pie shell, but I can how that is a good idea.

I made this when my vegetarian friend came over for a movie night. It turned out to be a big hit, and I will make it again. After reading other reviews, I decided to use fat free cottage cheese and fat free half and half in place of the cream. I also added garlic to the onions when I cooked them. 
*Note- This filling makes enough for two regular pie crusts.

This turned out really well. It makes about enough to fill 2 pie shells if you want to have 2. I made 2 additions: I added fresh sliced mushrooms when frying the onions in butter and added that to the mixture. I also added 1/4 cup of cooked white rice.
