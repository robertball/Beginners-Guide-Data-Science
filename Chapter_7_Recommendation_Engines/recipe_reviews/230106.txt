In making this recipe, I goobered and forgot to chop the cherries, no biggie. All in all, easy recipe, but still to me tasted of more condensed milk with almond cherry flavor(and I'm basing this off of not eating much white style fudge). The batch should be lined in a pan with a sheet of foil that has been buttered, because I buttered my dish very well, but it was still very hard to remove out of a pan that wasn't lined so. I normally line all my pans with foil, if I'm making fudge, but didn't on this instance. While I thought it tasted nice & it's flavor was rich, I could see making again, however the person I made them for, loved it very much.

I just tried it today, but I went with her suggestions for substituting some ingredients. For instance, I didn't have any almond extract, so I used Mexican vanilla. Because I had about a cup of milk chocolate chips around, I used it, plus two cups of white chocolate; figured that milk chocolate is as sweet as white chocolate, so it wouldn't be throwing sweetness off. Don't be tempted to add sugar! It's not disgustingly sweet like some of the recipes here, and it gets more than enough from the sugar in condensed milk and these types of chocolate. Next time, though, I'll try it with all white chocolate, just as it's written. I know that almond extract will be superior to vanilla in this recipe because it's perfect with cherries, so I'll buy some of it for next time. 

It's fast and super-easy to make, because it's not a real fudge, which is tricky, demanding, and takes some skill. It's a tasty candy, though, and it's quite good enough to give to friends or take to work.

This fudge had great taste, but did not set. I am not a candy maker, but after making six batches in one day, utilizing several different recipes, I figured out that candy is affected by altitude. So, I altered several recipes by adding powdered sugar to help the candy set. Unfortunately, for this particular recipe, it was too late to attempt to correct it by the time I figured that out. Maybe next year.

Just made this and omitted the cherries and almond and opted for plain white chocolate with rum flavor instead. It's cooling in the fridge now and I am already impressed with the results. Always good to line a fudge pan with either non-stick foil or parchment for easy removal and cutting.

To R&B - Regarding your question, if you cut this in 8 1" rows in each direction (7 actual cuts along each side to create 8) it should give 64 1" pieces if you use an 8 X 8 pan.

Loved it and received rave reviews from family and friends. I will definitely make this one of my staples for Christmas goodies. Used bags of white chocolate chips & dried cherries from the bulk foods section.

I made 1/2 batch cherry and 1/2 batch with dried cranberries.  Both are delicious but the cherry is my favorite.  I buttered parchment paper like recommended and it worked well.  Thanks for  the recipe.

I have made this two ways, one as is, and then substituted dried cranberries. The one with cranberries was even better because of the tartness contrasted with the sugary white chocolate. Handed out the recipe at Christmas last year.

This recipe was easy to make, I used a double boiler and lowfat sweetened condensed milk so I think it made it a bit softer in consistency, I also substituted vanilla extract for the almond, probably would use a little less extract next time I make it. My husband took one bite and replied "This is good...this is really good"
I will definately make it again.
