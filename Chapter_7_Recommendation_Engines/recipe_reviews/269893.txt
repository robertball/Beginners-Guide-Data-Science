These cupcakes were fantastic.! I doubled the recipe and followed the directions exactly.   I took 23 to an event (one escaped before I left the house) and came home with only 3 left.  :)  The flavors of nutmeg, vanilla, and lemon all come together nicely.

Easy to make, I used vanilla extract instead of the paste because that is $16  a bottle- very sweet, didnâ€™t care for the frosting or the nutmeg flavor in the cupcake. Will try a different recipe next time.

I made it as is, though I added much more lemon then it calls for. I don't think I'll use the cream cheese based frosting again, I may stick to a lemon buttercream instead. The cream cheese frosting is delicious, though.
