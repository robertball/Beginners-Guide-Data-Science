Made this exactly as the directions dictated early Thanksgiving day and then refrigerated it.  When it came time to reheat it, I had no burner available so I put it in a chaffing dish and put it in a 325 oven for 45 minutes. The sauce thickened and had a rich onion flavor.  Everyone raved about it.  Baking it elevated this recipe to the next level and yes, it is extremely easy to make.

This was the easiest version of creamed onions I've ever made, and it tastes just like my Nan's... I used chicken broth like a saw in a review (vs. Water) and it added so much flavor. That was the only swap. Excellent! Will be so enjoyed during our Thanksgiving dinner! Thank you!!

I was pleasantly surprised! I was thinking this was going to be boring but the flavors came through. The only thing I would add is black pepper which can be added at the table. I didn't use Wondra since I didn't have it on hand so I used AP flour and mixed it with the milk using an immersion blender to avoid lumps. I used fresh onions.

Boiled onions in unsalted chicken broth. Removed onions and topped off remaining broth to make half a cup. Lightly sautéed onions in butter, added AP flour. Then milk and broth. Season with pepper and salt. Will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I recommend using jarred onions. You may want to order them in advance though.

Really Nice - I made it on Thanksgiving  Eve.  Having read another recipe that added White Pepper I experimented one spoonful at a time.  I decided I didn't like the White Pepper much.   This recipe is great just as written.  I am usually light on the salt so I needed to add just a little more.  Thank You.  P.S.  Birdseye Frozen Foods no longer seems to sell Creamed Onions so I am glad I learned how to make it myself.  Thank You, again.

Great recipe. I used frozen pearl onions, cooked them first and made the sauce in a separate pot to taste, using regular flower (takes a bit longer to boil out the flower taste) Added a little white pepper, lemon juice and sugar.  Also added 1 teaspoon of crême fraîche. Then mixed all together and let the flavors blend.

Larger sweet onions were used; boiled and skinned them.  Used whole milk, pepper and Ritz Crackers as changes.  It was an great add to Christmas dinner!
