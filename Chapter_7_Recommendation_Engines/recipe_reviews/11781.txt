Very tasty. I skipped the pasta. It really didn't need it.

Great recipe! I made some changes based on what we have in the house and personal taste. Instead of chicken, I used sliced sausage, which complemented the spinach flavor well. I doubled the garlic and used 10 oz. fresh spinach that I sauteed with the onion/garlic mixture. Another Stracciatella recipe uses lemon juice, so I added a scant Tbsp. which really perked up the soup. A plus for us: adding 1/3 C. milk/cream just before stirring in the eggs gives this a whole new look and flavor. YUM!

This soup was great! My daughters enjoyed it too, although my husband originally stuck his nose up at it because he doesn't like spinach. After watching us enjoy it (while he ate left-overs) he decided he'd try it the next time I made it. 

I did make a few changes. I used garlic chicken broth, since that was all I had on hand, and decreased the amounts of chicken and spinach used due to what I had available. The parmesan makes it really yummy. It's definitely something I'll make again!

Good, but not as good as the Stracciatella II recipe on this site. It did, however, give "tweaking" ideas for the latter dish.

I really liked this - even though I'm not usually a fan of soup. Used a touch of fresh lemon juice as suggested in another review. Based on ingredients I had on hand used: fresh spinach and penne pasta. Penne worked fine but had to boil soup a bit longer. Loved the flavour that the cayenne pepper brings to the dish.

My family loved this soup! Instead of using frozen spinach, I sauteed fresh baby spinach in olive oil and garlic. Delicious!

My family loved this! I used the chicken from a leftover roaster. And instead of frozen spinach, I sauteed a bag of fresh spinach in olive oil with chopped garlic, salt and pepper. Left out the cayenne because I didn't have any. Perfect for a cold night!

I love stracciatella.  I make it very similiar to this recipe, but usually without chicken, and add additional spinach.  Sometimes I will add rice rather than pasta, depending on my mood. I have never added cayenne to this soup, but was pleasantly surprised by its addition.  Thank you!

I was amazed at how much my husband and I enjoyed this soup. I used less chicken then the recipe called for, and broken dried homemade pasta. I also didn't use any water, but half chicken half vegetable stock. We'll definitely be having this soup again.

Delicious!  I was looking for a recipe using spinach, pasta, & egg, and this was perfect!  I added a large finely diced tomato and used fresh baby spinach finely sliced and a bit of olive oil with the butter-it was a hit.  My three young boys loved it-simple, good, and very filling.

I love this soup! It was easy to make, even for the first time, and it tastes excellent. My family loved it, and I'm glad I doubled the recipe, because now we have plenty of leftovers. This is my new favorite soup. Highly recommended!

I thought this soup was wonderful! I did add more garlic than 1/2 a tsp and used fresh spinach in replace of frozen. I wasn't even hungry when I made it, but after I tried it, I couldn't put my spoon down! It was quick and easy, too. Now I just need to figure out how to pronounce the name! Haha!

I prefer soup to be a little more flavorful.  This would be good as an addition to a meal, but it wasn't substantial enough to be a main dish, as I intended.

I really enjoyed this made just as written. Quick and easy and I couldn't stop eating it.
next time I would chop the chicken smaller for my own preference.

I was underwhelmed (no mention of salt in this recipe?) but if I were to make it again I would use fresh spinach and chicken breast that had not been previously frozen.

This was pretty good. My boyfriend, who is really into healthy food and chicken, was even more of a fan of the recipe than I was. I did think it was a bit bland, but some extra black pepper and added salt took care of that issue. The chicken stock and spinach were definitely the dominant flavors. It all tasted very fresh and healthy, despite the frozen spinach.

I made a few small changes:
-Full teaspoon of garlic
-Used 16 oz of chicken and cut it into cubes
-Used about a tablespoon and a half of butter
-4 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup water

This soup is wonderful to make after a long day of work and you don't have much time. I shredded my chicken so there was a little in each bite. I have co-workers asking for the recipe every time I bring some in.

I used a little bit of hot sauce in place of cayenne pepper, I don't like spicy hot food but a bit of hot sauce adds flavor without making your dish spicy. 
Fresh baby spinach is better than frozen if you have it on hand.
For the eggs, I prefer this to be more creamy like a Greek soup rather than scrambled egg like a Chinese/Japanese style soup. To achieve this, remove a cup or so of broth before bringing it back to a boil and let it cool so it is still hot but not so hot it's going to scramble your eggs. If you can sip it without burning your tongue, it's cooled enough. 
Wisk your eggs separately, then SLOWLY add eggs to the cup of cooled broth, whisking constantly as you go. This will temper your eggs rather than cook them immediately. Once your eggs are incorporated into the cup of broth, you can add that to your soup as the last step. This will make a huge difference in the style of soup.

Really SHOCKED! I worked the overnight and NEEDED to use up my chicken before it went bad. I just wasn't in the mood for much effort. This fit the bill - until i saw the eggs. GAG. I decided to try it anyway. And it was worth it. The pepper makes it. Its like a homey feel without the hours of slaving. I even - GASP - avoided chopping! I used pre cut garlic and onion seasoning. (Told ya - i was exhausted). And i used 1 cup cooked rice instead of pasta because i think it holds up better for left overs. Next time i will def use fresh spinach. Frozen was fine but I only used half the box because I felt it was too overpowering otherwise. I still think raw egg in soup is sacrilegious but I'll make an exception here! Thanks!

This dish has it all. I took out the eggs due to personal taste and used all broth instead of water. I topped with fresh cracked black pepper and made a Parmesan crouton with some Italian bread to sop up those yummy juice. New family favorite !

My family loves soup! This was hearty and tasty. I doubled the recipe and shared it with my son & daughter-in-law who try to eat healthy - so this was a winner for them too. Added it to my recipe box.

Fantastic! I made the recipe exactly as stated above. The only thing I added was a frozen rind of Romano cheese (a TV chef does this a lot, you can use the rind of either Parmesan or Romano), it made the soup so flavorful and creamy!!

This is a great, quick soup!  I used canned chicken (what I had on hand), and I only used one egg, but the whole thing was done in about 30 minutes.

I took some of the suggestions added by other reviewers. I used fresh spinach and added lemon juice and milk. I made it with the chicken and used fresh picked herbs (basil, Thyme, Bay Leaves etc). I added mushrooms to the saute mixture. The result + Exquisite!!!   Served with small salad. Success!

Awesome recipe!  You can season it to your liking.  I have used all types of pasta, even turned it into a meal by reducing the broth.
