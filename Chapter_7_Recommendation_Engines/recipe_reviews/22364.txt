I'm rating this a 5, but I have to admit I changed it dramatically.  First of all, I used brown rice instead of pasta. I used 12 oz. organic sausage, and added a can of diced green chilis, mushrooms, 3 tomatoes, a larger quanity of a fresh  mixture of olives, and quite a bit of garlic. I cut the cheese way back to less than a cup.  The end result was delicious.

Love this recipe!!  5 ingredients and tastes gourmet.  I halved the cheese as others did and used a can of well drained diced tomatoes...and I added a little garlic just because.  Served with garlic bread and salad - yum!!!

I was shocked at how easy this was - my 14 y/o daughter did the whole thing her self.  She followed the recipe, except for substituting colby for cheddar.  (I would also recommend seeding the tomatoes.)  The colors were visually appealing and the food was ooh, so tasty!

This came out really wierd.  I would say it tastes more like a pasta slad than a regular pasta dish.  I only used 2 cups of cheese and it was too much.  My kids were looking at me like I was crazy.  Won't be making this again.

Had some sausage from a fundraiser and was looking for recipes and came across this one. I knew from the ingredients that my husband would love this, and I was right! I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes and cut the cheese two 2 cups. The olives really complimented the dish well.  I served it hot and it was great! Will make again sometime!

This was awesome. But I changed it a bit, didnt have everything on hand. I used whole wheat pasta, garlic, pork sausage, japaleno slices, mushrooms, tomato's, and a tiny bit of olive oil and about 3/4 cup of mozzarella cheese. Ok, so I guess I changed it alot. Im sure both ways are Fantastic!!

Pretty good, and very easy.  Not sure if the pasta and sausage were supposed to be hot or cold, so I did the pasta and sausage first so they could cool for a while, then added everything else.  I added a small amount of olive oil to the pasta and mixed it, then added the sausage, veggies and cheese.  As a result, it worked as a cold pasta salad and that's how I served it along with some Irish Wheaten bread.  Although I'd like a little more flavor so garlic, salt, and pepper would be welcome in this, it was surprisingly flavorful for not having those ingredients.  I added in some chopped cucumber just because I had some on hand.  It added some additional color to the salad.  thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make and delicious! My husband loved it, I will definitely be making this at least once a month. I did half the recipe and put only 1 cup of cheese, and the whole can of olives. Even tastes great as leftovers. Yum!

I never really had spaghetti without some kind of sauce so I was a little leary, but, we both really enjoyed this. I used 1/2 of the cheese and it made it nice and 'creamy'.  Not liquidy, but creamy. I love black olives and they complimented the dish really well.  Was simple and quick to put together.

This is the perfect easy meal.  I didn't have any tomatoes, so I chopped up a yellow pepper instead.  I had an assortment of shredded cheese that needed to be used up (cheddar, parmesan and mexican blend) and it still tasted great.  This will be a regular in the rotation!

This was really good. I went with what I had at home and used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of fresh and omitted the olives, and served it with garlic bread and  roasted asparagus, it was great!

I made this because I thought my husband would like it, and was surprised when I liked it, too!  I don't normally like olives, but this recipe is really good and simple to make.  I only used 2 cups of cheese.

Loved this!  I made it just to use up some sausage and I had all the ingredients except the black olives.  I cut the cheese in half as previous reviewers, but next time I will use it all and get the black olives too.  It's one of those recipes that you can get addicted to, tastes better every time I have it.  If you leave out the olives, add a little salt.  This is one to share.

We loved this!  Husband couldn't stop raving.  Amazing that is is so quick and easy and delivers great flavor. Neither my husband or I even really like black olives, but oddly enough the olives give a lot of the flavor. Yum. I used a can of italian diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomato as didn't have any.  Cut the cheese back to 2 cups instead of 4. I only used about 1/4 of 14oz box of spagetti. I also threw in a couple cloves of garlic while browning the pork. Re-heats nicely.  This is gonna be in the rotation from now on.

Super for a weeknight meal!  Used a can of diced tomatoes versus the fresh and about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Also added garlic salt, garlic powder, basil & oregano.  It seemed a little dry sitting in the pot so added about a cup of chicken stock and let that soak in.  Yummy busy night meal :)

I made this recipe but made a couple teeny tiny little changes.  First thing was I doubled the tomatoes.  I used a 28 oz can of plain ol' petite diced tomatoes.  Second, I cut the cheddar cheese to 2 cups, which was more than plenty for this dish.  And third, I drizzled a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over the whole thing just before serving.  This dish was simple and YUMMY!  My adult daughter, who won't eat anything pork, loved it.  It's surprising how delicious this is with only these several ingredients.  The olives are a great touch.

It was delicious. The second time I omitted the olives and replaced it with a table spoon of Pesto and 1 cup of cream cheese instead of cheddar(with a bit of broth to dilute the cream cheese).

It's a very nice and easy dish, when you are stuck.

It was just okay. I made it just as written. I think I've never been a fan of pasta unless there is some kind of sauce on it.

Not a fan of this one.  It is too plain and needs a lot more added to it for it to work for me.  Very easy to make but I will not make it again.

We love this recipe! It only takes about 20 minutes to make, and we normally have the ingredients for it. It's a new classic in my family!

This recipe was great.  My roommate and I tried it last night and both went back for seconds.  I didn't add as much cheese as it suggested to the dish (I probably used about half), but I kept the remaining cheese on the side so that we could have as little or as much cheese as we wanted.  I'm definitely going to make this again, but I think I will add a little more of the ingredients, other than the chesse, because I think it would help balance out all the noodles.  Can't wait to make it again!

Simple to make, basic, but very good taste.  Followed directions as given since it was the first time I made it (except I used Trader Joe's canned diced tomatoes since I didn't have two fresh ones lying around).  Kids picked out the olives, but everyone in my "somewhat picky and pretty used to gourmet food" family agreed we should make this again.  I think next time I might do what another reviewer did and add some spinach.

It was okay...nothing to rave about but would make it again if I didn't have a lot of time and had most of the ingredients.
Used kalamata(sp) olives and spicy, hot pork sausage and 2 cups of frozen spinach. However, I did use half   cheddar and half mozzarella because I did not have enough cheddar. I think this may have altered it because the mozzarella makes the ingredients stick together.

This tasted even better than I expected.  We used canned crushed tomatoes, less cheese, garlic, and no olives.  My family loved it.

This is a really good recipe, simple and tasty. I cant have cheese, so I left that out, used canned diced tomatoes and gluten free noodles.

This recipe was good because I was able to just use things I already had in the house. Except I did not have any olives, so I just used a green pepper instead. Also, the sausage that I used wasn't really fatty, so I didnt drain it, and I also mixed my veggies in with the sausage when it was just about done so they would be cooked a little and I think this made it better. I also only used a little less than 1 1/4 cups of cheese because 4 seemed like a lot (plus I didnt actually have that much cheese on hand). The amount of cheese I used was perfect. I'll definitly make this again, and next time I think I'll try it with the olives and peppers. Some banana peppers might also be interesting, but I'd homestly put them on anything.

I might of used the wrong kind of sausage. You could only taste sausage.   Might make again with different kind of sausage. Thank you

Pretty tasty number!  I added mushrooms and five cloves of garlic. As recommended, I halved the cheese but next time, I’ll skip the cheese. Also, I recommend using kalamata olives. I think some fresh basil would go ice on top, too. But, it’s a yummy dish as is, thanks!!

I made it the other day. I used mozzella and 2 lbs of sausage, it came out extremely good.  There were no left-overs.

This was such a simple yet flavorful dish!  Definitely a "make again" dish!

Note: I cut the cheese in half and sautéed zucchini to add in.

I added a can of green chilis, garlic and onion, decreased the cheese to one cup.  Added black pepper, a little salt, garlic powder.  We loved it!
  Next time I want to add mushrooms, shrimp, and maybe some cajun spice.

It was a great quick meal but I felt like it was missing something. We added some Hot sauce which help a great deal. I would also recommend garlic salt, or fresh basil. These items will give a little extra flavor boost. Other than that it was an amazing recipe.

This was just okay. The only changes I made were using bowtie pasta instead of spaghetti.  The result was something between pizza-flavored noodles and homemade hamburger helper.  Not bad, but not great. My kids summed it up - "We'll eat it, but can you not make this again?"
