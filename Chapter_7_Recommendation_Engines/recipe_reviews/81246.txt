I did not care for this. I know it wasn't a mistake on my part since it was an easy recipe to follow.  It was just way too rich.  INSTEAD, I recommend a WHITE CHOCOLATE MARTINI (1.5 oz godiva white chocolate liqueur, 1.5 oz clear creme de cacao, .5 vodka, 2.5 oz half & half.) Place all your ingredients in shaker with ice and strain into a martini glass with a Hershey's chocolate kiss  placed at the bottom of your glass.  Dust cocoa powder on top and there you have it.  This is the best recipe I have found for this martini and just wanted to share it.  Apparently this is one of Christina Aguilera's favorite drinks at some fancy club so I searched online and made 3 different ones-not a cheap thing to do.  But this one is a keeper that my girlfriends love to drink. The Hershey's kiss at the end of your drink is my favorite!! ENJOY!

I used Smirnoff Whipped Cream Vodka and homemade irish creme. Quite good. I think I might try this as a float next time and use club soda in place of the milk to make it fizzy. EDITED: I made this the next night the same way I did before BUT I omitted the milk and poured club soda over the top. Even better. It really was like a float like you'd get at a soda fountain!
