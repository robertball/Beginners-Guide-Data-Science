I won't make these again.  They were very heavy and dry, and they didn't have much flavor.  Adding lemon or almond flavoring may help with the flavor, but they would still be dry.

Definitely needs more moisture in the batter… I thought it needed more flavor so doubled up on a number of the flavor ingredients so the flavor was definitely very good but still to dry… I will try it again with more moisture components... I want this recipe for my version of this recipe to work because I love poppyseed and I wanted to make it healthier with rolled oats as part of the ingredients… I did mill my rolled oats so it was more like rolled oats flour
