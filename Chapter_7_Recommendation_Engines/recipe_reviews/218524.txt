I reduced the recipe to 6 servings and made one pizza, following the instructions exactly.  I baked it for 20 minutes at 400F.  The dough came together and rolled nicely.  However, it did not rise.  When I left it to rest 15 minutes, it stayed inert.  When I cooked it, the bottom crisped up, but the rest stayed thin and doughy.  I'm not sure if it was the requirement of cold water that did it... doesn't yeast (even instant yeast) usually need warm water to grow?  Maybe I'll try this again with warm water.

This is such an unbelievable, probably best tasting pizza dough I have yet made. With some minor modifications this can be one of your favorite pizza dough recipes as well. I didn't have instant rise yeast so I used a package of rapid rise yeast instead, since I did this alternation I used warm water instead of the cold. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the dry ingredients and after kneading the dough I covered and let rise for about 2-3 hours until the dough doubled. I then divided into 4 balls and refrigerated remaining dough I wasn't going to use.  When I have baked this at a 525 degree oven for 10 min my white pizza came out better than an authentic brick oven pizzeria (thats what my husband said). Overall just amazing! I never tried parmesan pizza dough before and now it will probably be my all time fav!! A must for a white pizza recipe!!! Try!!

Good recipe but the directions are vague.  For anyone new to cooking, 
Quick-Rise instant yeast is the same as Fast-Rising, Rapid-Rise and/or Bread Machine Yeast.  Also, the directions don't tell you to pre-bake the crust before you add the toppings.  I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes at 400*F, topped the pizza and then baked an additional 8-10 minutes.  I didn't taste the parmesan cheese, so that could be eliminated if you don't have any or need to make it milk free.  It's a good recipe for when you want pizza but don't have the hours to spend waiting for your dough to rise.  I will definitely make this again.

It is a great recipe but I altered it slightly to suit my needs. I have made this recipe three times already and I used normal yeast (no such thing as instant or rapid in my local shop) and so I used warm water and let it rise for a couple of hours. I also came to the conclusion that other types of cheese (emental, cheddar etc.) are equally good. I found this out when I ran out of parmesan and I was too lazy to go buy just the parmesan when I had other great cheeses at home.

This was the best pizza crust I have made to date. My family and friends loved it! I wasn’t sure about the yeast amount as I didn’t have “quick”, so I added about 2 1/2 tsps to warm water, let it sit for about 15 minutes then added the dry ingredients. I let it rise for about an hour before dividing it up. I refrigerated overnight to use the next day. Oh, I doubled the recipe, so made 8 pizzas total. I’m not sure I could really taste the Parmesan cheese, I may try it next time without....one other thing, I made the crust on parchment paper and heated my pizza stone in my 465degree oven, this made a huge difference in browning the bottom crust, it made it nice and crispy.

Delicious! I added an additional 1 cup of flower; 1/4 cup granulated garlic; 1 tsp+ each of  dried basil, oregano, rosemary, and thyme; and a 1/2 tsp sugar. Split the dough in half, rolled both out to about 1/4" thick. I put one on a lightly greased pizza pan and let it proof for about 45 minutes, then baked it at 350' for about 10 minutes, took out and cooled. We added our cheese and toppings and then cooked at 350' for about 10 minutes and at 450' for an additional 4 minutes. I sprinkled about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella on 3/4 of the other dough round, then rolled it up tightly (starting at the end with cheese on) into a log, then I cut the log in 2" pieces  and set them out on a pan with lightly greased parchment (I wasn't taking any chances on these sticking), so they looked like cinnamon buns or pinwheels. I let those proof for about 45 minutes  and then baked at 350' for about 18 minutes. Whole family loved this pizza dough!

I've been making my own Parmesan Pizza Dough for years and I wanted to try another recipe. Although I increased the amount of cheese, we couldn't taste it.  Sorry but I'll stay with my old one!

I cut this recipe in half and used warm water instead of cold. Then I let the dough rise for about an hour before I rolled it out. It was good. The Parmesan adds  nice flavor.

Would make it again but will certainly try to make it thinner.  The taste was great but I did add some garlic granules to it.

This makes a nice crispy thin crust. However, if you want a thicker and less crispy crust, use more yeast and be sure to use warm water. 
 
Finally, I found using the grated Parmesan cheese didn't add to the flavour.  I would suggest the shredded cheese in bags (or freshly grated) would improve the flavour.

I make pizza dough regularly and I thought this recipe with Parmesan Cheese would be really interesting.  Because I only had regular yeast on hand, I did use warm water and let my dough rise for about an hour before rolling it out.  I though the parm added a nice flavor and I would make this recipe again.

I halved it to make 2 crusts but I wish I had made the full amount as it was a little too thin crust for us. I doubled the yeast and used warm water, dough came together nicely and I had to add very little extra flour. Baked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees which was perfect. You cannot really taste the Parmesan cheese in the crust so it is a waste of expensive cheese. #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't say the Parmesan flavour comes through very strongly.  If I make this again, I'd try increasing the Parmesan to get a cheesier taste.

I made half of this recipe the day before I planned to use it and stored it in the fridge as per instructions. I took the dough out one hour prior to using it to bring it up to room temp. Other than decreasing the portions I made this exactly as written.  The crust had a very faint parmesan cheese flavour, mainly in the outer crust, so I probably wouldn't use the cheese the next time.  I made two, medium size, thin crust pizzas. This was very easy to make. Thanks.

To me, it didnt look completely right. It didnt seem to rise correctly ( to me, the cold water in the recipe was probably the reason). 
The Perfect Parmesan Pizza Dough did turn out , just not how I pictured, and not the type of crust I like. It was a crispier crust, not airy. 
I did like the tangy of Parmesan in the crust!!
Will I use this recipe again? Most likely not in the current form, but as a launching recipe for other versions, and definitely with warm water.

I made Chicken Souvlaki pizza for dinner tonight using this pizza dough recipe - and it was outstanding!! Although I did follow the recipe exactly, the next time I would use rapid-rise yeast and let my dough rise for 2-3 hours for a nice, fluffy crust.

We really liked this and will male it again.  I followed ingredients exactly, but did use warm water, and sprinkled the yeast on the water, and let it sit in a warm kitchen for 15 minutes before tossing in the other ingredients.  As per my picture, 1/4 of the recipe made a nice 13 inch thin crust Pizza. Very nice with the Caramelized Onion and Arugula Pizza topping.
