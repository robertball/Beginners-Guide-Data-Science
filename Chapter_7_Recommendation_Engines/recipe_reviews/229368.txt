The outstanding ingredient in this is the wasabi which gives this a real punch of flavor.  However, the shredded cheese just gets lost; I wouldn't even bother with that if I made again.  And don't try to pipe the filling into the egg shells because the bacon clogs up in the tip (probably should have known that).  Nice and a little different.

I agree with the first reviewer, the cheese just gets lost in the other flavors so I'll omit it next time. My bacon had a strong smoky flavor which overtook the wasabi so I would probably use less bacon or a milder bacon if I make this again. The wasabi really does add a yummy kick to this recipe. It is easy to put the thick filling back into the eggs with just a tablespoon.

Made this a few days ago for the family...first time my egg dish had leftovers!  Personally, I didn't care for them a whole lot -- the filling was too heavy.  I prefer my "rigged up" recipe which includes sour cream and horseradish.  Guess my family just prefer mine better!

I followed this recipe exactly. My family loves Bacon Deviled Eggs, and they love spicy stuff. But Wasabi is NOT the way to get the heat. I had doubled this recipe, wasting two dozen eggs and leaving a gap on our appetizer table on Thanksgiving afternoon. Disappointing is an understatement. I will not be making these again.
