Very rich, but delicious! I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. It was requested again for Christmas. I didn't use seedless jam, I used regular and it didn't make a difference.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it for guests last night and they loved it, I made a few changes, I used pecan instead of walnuts in the crust, and I added Kahlua instead of the raspberry jam.  It was awesome.

This turned out wonderfully!  I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and he loved it.  It is rich, so small pieces are enough!
