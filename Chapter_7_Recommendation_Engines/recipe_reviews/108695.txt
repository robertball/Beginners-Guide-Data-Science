Update again: If you like SWEETER drinks, use the orange sherbet as Austin suggested. If you like less sweet, more of a sour taste, use the orange juice. I have tried both ways and both are wonderful! Have made this smoothie about 10 times. My 4yo LOVES it! Update: I have made this smoothie several times & we really love it! Today I subbed mandarin orange segments for the oranges and I really like it that way, provided a little extra sweetness. (see posted pics) Thanks, Austin, keep up the great recipe work (: Original review: Very tangy, refreshing! I did add a little sugar to mine. Thanks so much for the post!

This just wasn't very good. Too sour, for starters, and the orange segments were soggy and left pulpy pieces in my smoothie...ended up dumping the lot of it out.

You have to make sure the fruit is ripe when you make this. I let the fruit ripen on the kitchen counter.
I make protein shakes everyday and never add a sweetener. I add, maybe, some vanilla and cinnamon.

Even though I haven't tried this if you like banana this is a great way to use those ripe to over ripe ones as they work as a natural sweetener.  Bonus!!
