These were very moist and soooo tasty.
Recipe can also be baked in a 9x5" loaf pan in 350 deg oven for 40-45 minutes. Any flavor cake mix can also be used.  It's great made with a German Chocolate cake mix.

These were delicious!  I added some fresh grated carrot- maybe 1/3 c along with the zucchini and then craisins instead of raisins and baked them in mini muffin size!  My little girls LOVE them!

I gave this a 4 only because it's a tad on the too sweet side for my taste.I know that's from the carrot cake mix though. This recipe was SUPER easy. I added walnuts instead of pecans and the muffins were yummy. I also had to cook about 5 minutes longer than suggest but that's normal with this type of batter. My 22 month old has been gobbling these up. I made a tin of mini muffins just for him. He eats them and says "mmmmmm..nummy" so that's a big thumbs up from us both!

My family loved these muffins, but I have to give them 4 stars because I didn't make the recipe exactly as written. I messed up and bought spice cake mix instead of carrot cake mix. I went ahead and used it though, and actually really loved the result. I omitted the raisins, and used 1 cup of zucchini and 1 cup of grated carrots to make up for the fact that I had the wrong cake mix. I also frosted the muffins with some leftover maple cream cheese icing. Fantastic!!

These were pretty good.  I did add 1 t. of baking powder, as my cake mix was a little old, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I only made 12 muffins. I also used sunflower seeds in place of the pecans, as that's what I had on hand. I am going to try this again using a spice cake mix, too.  Can't beat this one for simpliticity!

Moist and yummy.  Kids love them and they are very simple to make.  I made them as mini-muffins and baked half the time.

My family loves this recipe!  Every time I make it I have to double it, since one batch barely makes it out of the oven without being instantly devoured.  I've tried varying the ingredients by using shredded apple instead of applesauce and replacing 1/2 cup of the zucchini with shredded carrots, with good results.  I like knowing my kids are getting some vegetables instead of the empty calories of a regular cupcake or muffin.

I had alot of zucchini I was trying desperately to use. I didn't have a carrot cake mix but I did have a spice cake mix, so I changed it up just a bit. I used a spice cake mix and craisins. These muffins were light and fluffy and made me think of fall (which was a welcomed thing on a hot 90 degree day). The kids loved them and it will make for a few easy morning breakfasts for me this week!

Very moist and tasty.  Nothing beats the simplicity of this recipe.  I made it according to the recipe, omitting the raisins and nuts (the kids hate raisins in baked goods and one has a nut allergy).  I would prefer to have both included.  I added a bit more zucchini,  because I had a bit extra leftover.  I'd make it again.  They are a bit sweet with the cream cheese frosting.

This was super quick and easy - and delicious! I made mini-muffins and it made 40 muffins. It took mine 14 minutes to bake. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg to make it more like a zucchini bread and we love it! They'll be devoured in no time.

Very good.  A bit sweet for my taste, but as another reviewer said it is from the box cake mix.  I made this as a cake in 9 x 13 pan and I used 2 eggs instead of 1.  The flavor did improved after sitting in the refrigerator about 24 hours.

These are amazing. Instead of the raisins & nuts - I just add an extra 1/2 cup Zucchini & 1 cup of shredded carrots. They are so moist!  I've made it with spice cake mix too, just as good.

I had really good results.. but only by using this recipe as a base idea.  I didn't have the carrot cake mix I thought, so used a spice cake & used grated carrots in place of the zucchini.  I also increased the applesauce by the amount of oil & omitted the oil completey.  it ended up a little on the thick side, so I added about 1/4 cup water.  I added cinnamon chips instead of raisins.  I chose not to frost, altho if I did, I would use cream cheese frosting.  instead I just sprinkled extra cinnamon chips & halloween candies on top of the muffins before baking, to make them seasonal.  the muffins were a hit at the party!

These are soooooo yummy.  Definitely 5 stars.  They are really moist.  The only change I made is I used unsweetened applesauce because that's what I had on hand, and walnuts instead of pecans.  I am glad I used the unsweetened applesauce though cause they had the perfect sweetness, but not too sweet.

I love this recipe!  The last time I made it, I added some ingredients that we all enjoyed.  I didn't have enough zucchini so I used 1 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup shredded carrot.  I had some dates so I cut up 1/3 cup and mixed it with 1/3 cup raisins and 1/3 cup of craisins but omitted the nuts.  I also added 1 tbl spoon of wheat germ to the mix and sprinkled oats on top of each muffin.  Healthy and yummy!

Not what I was expecting.  Tasted like spice cake not carrot cake.
