O.M.G.  This is INSANE.  No really...it's so incredibly good.  Sadly, I'm left to eat the entire thing by myself, something my waistline regretted before I took my first bite, as my husband finds the very idea of this  concoction to be disturbing.  His loss, my taste buds' gain.  Seriously....it's amazing.  It's the only thing I've eaten today.  I made it for lunch.  I ate it as a snack.  I ate it for dinner.  Odds are I'll finish it off for breakfast.  PHENOMENAL.  The only changes I made were to use the entire 8 oz. of the package of cream cheese and also the full 8 oz. package of krab.  I used imitation crab because I was wary of investing in real crab for this project and to be honest I think the imitation was just as good.  I mixed the ingredients with the mixer so that the imitation crab wouldn't have any chunks, but would just be flaky and lend flavor like real crab.  After I tasted the end result I ended up doubling the sweet chili sauce drizzle.  THIS IS A KEEPER.  I wish my husband was brave enough to try it because there is no way I need to finish this off by myself.  My taste buds, though?  They're relishing in the hedonistic joy of finishing this entire pizza off by myself within the course of a day.

Made this last night and I’m making it again today! SO good even though I had to used canned crab and pre-made naan bread as the pizza crust. (it was so late that I didn’t have time to make pizza dough). My teenage sons fried the wontons and helped assemble as they LOVE crab rangoon. The whole fam devoured these pizzas! (Even the skeptical 7yo). I added a tiny splash of Worcestershire sauce to the cream cheese mixture.

Delicious!!! ohh my goodness, seriously yummy!!!!! I'm addicted!!  I used our Blackstone pizza oven my husband got for christmas to cook this on a 3 day rise dough. I added a little soy sauce & sweet chili sauce to the mix and also topped it with 5 spice broiled shrimp after it was done cooking.  In an attempt to "skip a step" I bought the wonton strips you find next to the croutons and I accidentally bought flavored ones, so I didn't use them, next time I'll make sure I buy the plain ones, the texture would be a great compliment.
 Fantastic idea, thank you so much for this recipe!! I can't wait to make this again!!  I will making this for super bowl.
Note: this recipe is fantastic as it is posted, but I always seem to add extra stuff, thanks again for the recipe! Also I used fat free cream cheese.

I adapted this for a cookie sheet to take to a potluck.  I picked up dough from a local pizzeria. Doubled the crab, doubled the cream cheese. Every bite was like biting into the center of a rangoon. I cut them into very small squares.  It was the first dish to disappear.

I found the cream cheese mixture impossibly dense, but stuck it out. I did sprinkle a lot of onions on it.  Next time, Ill add half the crab to the mixture, and then sprinkle the rest of it on like a topping with the onions, before covering with cheese and baking.

Omg. Omg omg. This pizza is AmAzIng! Well worth investing in a pizza stone if you don’t have one. Crispy crust is key, or it turns into a taco form. Which is still amazing. So worth making with FRESH crab, we found ours at the seafood counter already pressure steamed. Will be definitely making again.

I liked this - it definitely tastes like crab rangoon!  I think the thin crust as mentioned in the recipe is key.  Very delicious - and, would make a great appetizer.

Oh, my AR friends! This is a decadent, indulgent pizza recipe, definitely one for the mature palate! The toppings are spot on. The changes I made were out of personal preference only, and slight they were. We used my husband's killer pizza dough, added 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon white sugar to cut the fishy taste of the crab. Out of convenience, I used another brand of lump crab. Lesson learned. I will only buy Chicken of the Sea fresh lump crab from Costco. While I did fry my own wonton strips, I can see that buying the ready-made from the produce dept. would be just fine. Next time, we will add the wonton strips after cooking to avoid scorched skins. Nicely done!

Omg, this was awesome.  Only change I made was that I added garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture and left the chili sauce off (and those who wanted some just put it on their pieces).  

Notes:  if you use store bought pizza dough, don't use all the dough if you use a round pan,  go for a thinner crust, if possible.  Also, make sure you pierce the dough before baking.  We used canned crab for the first try, and it turned out well.  We will be trying lump/claw meat on the next one.  And finally, the plain store bought already fried wonton strips worked great!

Delicious!  I used more cream cheese and crab because rangoons and cream cheese are some of my favorite foods.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make again!

this was as delicious as you would think. i used way more crab than recipe called for. I also used the premade wonton strips you find in salad dressing isle at your local grocery. Both  me and my husband thought it was fantastic. I even reheated leftovers in oven next day and came out delish also.

Yum! Made it with GF crust and wontons. Tastes like the real thing! Definitely choose frozen crab over canned. I'm making it again this weekend.
