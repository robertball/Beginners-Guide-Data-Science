These were fantastic but I followed another recipe on how to cook them.  After rolling, I lightly brushed with oil and baked them in the oven @425 for 20 minutes.  Turned them over after 10 minutes.  Same great taste without the added fat of frying.

I also have filipina descent in myself, and it is so great to finally have this recipe.  If you like eggrolls, you will absolutely love lumpia!!

I tried lumpia for the very first time after making them tonight, and they were delicious!  I changed the recipe a bit by leaving out a couple of the veggies and adding a vegetarian meat substitute (crumbled soy "beef").  I'm not sure what dipping sauces are traditionally used for this dish, but I used satay sauce and soy sauce, and both were very good.  I think the leftover filling will be great in lettuce wraps tomorrow.

Being of Filipino ancestry, I love eating lumpia!  I did take it for granted while living in Hawaii, since it was available everywhere.  I now live in Tennessee and haven't found any Filipino restaurants.  I did make it for a potluck at my office and everyone just LOVED it!!!

I love this recipe! So easy and delicious. I leave out the celery (personal preference) and jicama (because I can never find it). It's great for entertaining!

Haven't had lumpia in many years, my ex's mother used to make them and I loved them.  I will try this recipe out and post again afterwards.
