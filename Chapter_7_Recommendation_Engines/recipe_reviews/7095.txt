This is our favorite Soda Bread. The only tip I can offer is that chemically leavened breads should sit out at room temp for 30 minutes or so in the loaf pan following the mixing to allow the soda and powder to do their jobs. This will create an airier loaf - this holds true for pancakes, biscuits, etc...

From the photo of this bread, it does look irresistible. However, there is one ingredient that is not listed and probably makes this bread irresistible, and that is Raisins.

Having never made soda bread before, I was confused as to which recipe might be "the best." I tried this recipe as well as "Amazingly easy Irish soda bread" (submitted by Megan).  I liked this bread, but my husband thought it was really plain and boring.  However, I LOVED the "Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread" recipe.  So, while "Irresistible Irish Soda Bread" was VERY EASY and quite good, the "Amazingly Easy" version produces a bread with a tender, flaky crust and a slightly sweeter bread.

This isn't traditional Irish Soda Bread, more like a sweet breakfast bread. I think it is better suited for a brunch or tea than St. Patrick's Day Celebrations! It was tasty, if a little bland. Adding currants makes it less bland (because it isn't like soda bread) and more like a homeade raisin bread. It was hard to reconcile the fact that the bread is both sweet and savory. If you want authentic Irish Soda Bread, check out the "Irish Brown Soda Bread" recipe on this site.

Wonderfully soft and moist. Everyone at our St. Patty's Day party loved it. I put the batter in two aluminum loaf pans (the kind you can throw away) and they baked up beautifully. Thanks!

Very Good.  This bread is a soft dough, so you must put it into a bread pan, unlike other soda breads that you can shape into a loaf.  This as with all soda breads is a dense bread.

This was very quick and easy to make.  I wrapped it in foil overnight and the next day it was so good.  It's a good bread for soup or chili or stew.  I will definately make this again.

I served this at my annual St Patrick's day party and it was a hit.  Yummy, moist and the perfect accompaniment to Irish stew or corned beef and cabbage.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It has become part of the tradition!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  It develops such a beautiful crust, with perfect golden color, and has a perfectly balanced, toasty flavor.  It's my new go-to bread recipe for everyday use (I am allergic to yeast, so this is a fantastic alternative and not something I merely "settle for").  Some variations I've tried (and loved):  I used white whole wheat flour, which added some nutrients without changing the texture (I'll stick with this).  I also baked it in two 3.5x7" professional loaf pans and reduced baking time to exactly 50 minutes; this worked out perfectly, and I'll stick with this method, too.  Finally, I made a batch with raisins and layers of cinnamon sugar.  Yummy sweet treat!  (But I prefer the plain for everyday use.)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE.  Have fun with it, and thank you so much, Karin, for sharing!

I have been making Irish soda bread for over 30 years.  This recipe is the best one I have made, just don't forget the raisens.  I used about 3/4 of a cup.

I can't decide which I like better, this or Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread.  Both are good, this one isn't traditional looking and is a bit sweeter.  I added 1 cup of raisins to the batter, however most of them landed toward the bottom during the baking process.  The crust on this one is really nice.  Definitely toast and serve with butter!

This was very easy, but NOT the traditional Irish Soda bread one thinks of.  By reading the comments (re: overflow) I poured into one regular loaf pan and 1 mini loaf pan - this was perfect!  And it gives me a small loaf for my enjoyment and a reg. size loaf for my office!  Honey butter is wonderful with this.  I added 1 cup baking raisins, but next time will use 1 1/2 or 2 cups.  For fun, I sprinkled green sugars over tops before baking, which gave a nice result overall.
IF USING MINI LOAVES BAKE FOR 45 Minutes.  Good Luck!

A lovely bread, for sure, that's easy to make, moist, delicately flavored and pretty to boot.  And a bread, for sure, I wouldn't hesitate to make again.  Still, it was just a tad too sweet for me, which is no criticism of the recipe, just an individual taste preference.  For Hubs, on the other hand, it was just right.

This was great.  I had never tried Irish Soda Bread before, just kept seeing it mentioned with the Irish Lamb Stew recipe http://holiday.allrecipes.com/AZ/IrishLambStew.asp .  Am so glad I tried them together.  What an easy recipe that is so good!  Please do try, not only w/the Lamb Stew, but with ANY stew, or anytime you would like a good think (and so EASY) bread to go w/your meal!  Thank you!!!

I added 1 cup raisins to flour mixture.  I also added lemon juice to skim milk (usually use whole milk when I do this, but skim was what I had--as I never have buttermilk in house) to create buttermilk effects for recipe.  Those were my only changes.  This was really good bread.  My husband asked about it and wants to have it more often.  It had a sweetness to it, not sure the raisins contributed to that as all bites were good!  Reminded me of bread I had when I toured Ireland.  Went well with our Irish Stew tonight!  Will make this new find often!  (FYI if you don't have buttermilk you can add lemon juice or white vinegar to milk, let it set a few minutes before adding to recipe, it will work just as well as buttermilk).

I grew up eating the "traditional" soda bread  but my family much prefers this recipe to the old fashioned dry loaf. An Irish penpal of mine sent me a virtually identical recipe years ago so this must be authentically Irish too. I served this bread at our St Patrick's Day party a few years back and my guests argued over who got the last slice!

I'm a stickler for reading all the reviews and trying a recipe as is before I make any changes. This bread is delicious! You don't need to change anything. I think raisins would make it dessert-like. Was looking for something for sandwiches and breakfast. 

My husband just developed a yeast allergy and I was looking for a yeast-free bread recipe. Decided to go with this instead of Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread because of the simplicity as it required no kneading. It's nice hot, just a bit crumbly so wrapped it in foil overnight (after my husband ate half the loaf) but have just had a slice now with butter and it's absolutely awesome! Give it a go I say! I'm just contemplating going to the shop to get some more buttermilk! Thanks for sharing!

This was moist, dense and sweet on the inside, crusty and hearty on the outside.  It also held together well.  Half whole-wheat flour and half all-purpose, with a teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup of raisins mixed in the batter made for an excellent flavor.  I also lessened the salt to a scant half-teaspoon and topped with crumbled brown sugar and cinnamon before putting it in the oven for 70 minutes.

I bake bread for a living. I love my job to the point that I even do it at home, I even teach others (family and friends) how to bake. Soda Bread is one of my favorite "easy" recipes to pass on and this recipe is the best. The only thing I ever change is what I add  for flavor. Sometimes I mix in raisins and caraway to give it a boost but I love it plain with jams and/or butter.

This was good, but it did not taste like traditional Irish soda bread.  The traditional verson is denser and drier.  There are no eggs either since the bread comes from a time when famine was a huge problem.   I am disappointed to say the least.

This is the easiest, most delicious bread that can be made.  There may be better breads out there in the world but definetly not this low maintenance.  Just make sure to wrap in foil while it cools, otherwise, it won't be a moist and delicious as it should be.

Great recipe.  I didn't have an egg, so I used 1 scoop of mayonnaise and 1 scoop of sour cream, equalling 1/4 cup.  Also used craisins.  I didn't use any salt.  I microwaved the butter so it was hot when I mixed it in - giving the bread a very nice crust.  Again - a great recipe - will use it again and again ...

Easy to make.  Taste so good that you didn't even need to put butter on it.  It also wasn't dry - something Soda Bread can be known for.  The key is wrapping it in the Foil and allowing it to absorb moisture overnight.    
I am totally hooked on this bread.

I followed the recipe exactly, and planned to take the suggestion of letting it sit for 30 minutes. Due to a personal emergency, I had to leave the house, so it actually sat for 1.5 hours before I could get back and bake it.  I baked for 65 minutes, and it turned out delicious!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, not crumbly at all, with just a touch of sweetness.  Easy and delicious!

This turned out great--I will definitely be making it again. Note: I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk and it still turned out really nice.

For all those wishing to make an authentic-style Irish soda bread, use another recipe.  Just because the recipe calls for soda and buttermilk does not make it Irish!  Too Much SUGAR!!  This is more like a sweet American biscuit bread. That said, the recipe does come out crusty and flaky, and would be good for a breakfast bread but that wasn't what I was trying to make!

My family loved this bread.  It has a slightly sweet flavor and is a nice change of pace and so easy.  I don't normally have buttermilk so I just put 2 tablespoons of white vinegar in measuring cup before adding milk to bring to the 2 cups and let it stand for 5 minutes before using.

This is an excellent soda bread.  Soft light texture and slightly sweet flavor.  I was short on time, so I baked it in jumbo muffins for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  Each person had their own for dinner.  On another day, I made this again in jumbo muffin form, but used them for strawberry/blueberry shortcakes.  Divine!!

This is the best Irish Soda Bread recipe I have made.  It is moist, flavorful and slices perfect.  The only change I made was to increase sugar to 1/2 cup (used equivalent of Splenda/Sugar blend) and added a couple sprinkles of cinnamon.  Served warm with butter. No need to look any further.

Very delicious, especially w/ the addition of raisins! Mine turned out a bit heavier than I expected, but that was most likely my fault. As APAETH said in her review it's important to allow 30 minutes for the chemical reaction needed with quick breads. I will definitely be making this again!

quick, easy and quite successful: I served it with a tomato salad and grilled fish, but my little one doesn't want the fish so she had cheese. The kids were enthusiastic about it, she even wanted a bit more to mop olive oil with up from her plate:-) Hubby said it tastes too sweet, so I'm glad I didn't put raisins, but I'm sure that they would be a great addition. I omitted the butter, but it didn't suffer a bit from it!

I have made this recipe for several years and love it!  We are not big fans of raisins baked in things so it suits us better than most traditional ISB recipes.  I usually make it in 3 mini loaf pans and bake it for about 40 minutes.

This recipe is fantastic. I have taken it to many potlucks and I am always asked for the recipe. Do let it rest in the foil before eating it really does get better with age.

What an easy recipe.  I made a double batch the day before my party and wrapped in foil overnight.  My husband and I had a slice for breakfast and it was great!  Everyone at the party loved it.  I added 5 tablespoons of fennel seed to the double batch and the flavoring was perfect.  I liked it so much with the fennel I don't know if I will ever make it without it but I will be making this a lot.  Such an easy recipe.  Having it be a batter instead of a dough meant I had plenty of time to do other things I needed to do.  Thanks for this submission!

This is an excellent and EASY recipe.  It does not have the traditional texture of soda bread (dry like a tea biscuit) more like a quick bread texture.  I added a 1/4 cup of caraway seed and baked in mini loaves adjusting the bake time to 45 min for the mini loaves.  Very tasty and moist and the caraway gave it an excellent flavor.  However, I disagree with some reviewers, it tased great right out of the oven and great the next day.  I will make this again, thanks

WOW! This is the first time I have ever made bread before, and I loved this recipe! it was sooo easy! (hint: since others mentioned that it overflows in a 9x5 pan, and thats all i have, i made a recipe and a half and used that to fill 2 9x5 pans. it worked wonderfully!)

Ok, don't get me wrong...this is really good bread.  BUT NOT traditional Irish Soda Bread.  Even my 8 year old said, "This is too fluffy, I wanted to make the heavy bread we had at the Irish restaurant."

Not Irish, nor is it a Soda Bread, it's a quick breakfast style bread.  Soda bread doesn't have baking powder or sugar.  It's simply flour, baking Soda, salt and buttermilk with optional caraway.

I didn't have buttermilk so I pout 2tblsp vinagar in 2cp milk for 15 mins (stir well). I put some brown sugar and cinnamon mixture on top like another reviewer suggested. Came out wonderful! I enjoyed this bread and will most likely make again. I imagine rasins (if unlike me, you like them) would be good in here too; about 1cp.

Delicious! I substituted the egg for half of a banana (mashed) and added an 1/8 cup more of sugar and raisins. I ate it with a little butter on top and it really was irresistible! I could eat it all myself!

I made both the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread and the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread the same day.  Even though the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread was good the Irresistible Irish Soda Bread won all the votes. I did not have the buttermilk so I substituted with sour cream.

This bread is very tasty and moist.  You definitely need raisins to make this bread complete.  I like my bread a bit on the dense side so I tried not to overcook it.  I baked it in a loaf pan at 350 for 1 hour and it came out perfect!  My coworkers who never had Irish Soda Bread are now a huge fan!

Delicious and easy to make.  Because I didn't have any buttermilk, I used sour cream. Will definitely make again.

I am not a fan of traditional Irish soda bread, despite being part Irish. It is just too dry and tasteless. Therefore, I was excited to see this recipe. Well, I've made it twice this week, and what can I say, it's a hit! I've served it with and without green food coloring and prefer the non-moldy-looking color-free version. I served it at work and it's gotten the stamp of approval from this multicultural bunch.  We don't like raisins too much but we do like moisture, so I added 3/4 cup Zante currants. Moist, sweet but not too sweet, great snacking cake!

THIS IS THE SECOND ST. PAT'S DAY I MADE THIS BREAD. IT IS DELICIOUS. I USE A ROUND 9 INCH CAKE PAN AND BAKE FOR 70 MINUTES AND IT COMES OUT FANTASTIC. IT HAS THE ROUND APPEARANCE OF A TRADITIONAL SODA BREAD.

This bread is excellent and easy to prepare.  Much different texture than traditional irish soda bread - moist and delicious!  I added caraway seeds - would be great with raisins as well.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Made St Paddy's Day 2011 ...  - this is the best ever!  I added a handful or so of raisins.  After mixing I put this into a 8.5" springform pan that I had lightly buttered and lined the bottom with parchment paper..  As per someones suggestion I let it sit for half an hour before putting it into the oven.  It rose a lot in the pan and stayed high the whole time.  It was absolutely tasty, not crumbly or sodden ... had to put butter on each slice to keep it from floating away!  It went well with a glass of Guiness!  Perfect match to the corned beef dinner.  Thanks to Karin for posting it!  It is my new "heirloom" recipe!  Wish I could give it 10 stars!

It was good, did not put any raisins or currants in it.  I've been looking for a recipe that copycats an Irish Pub in Tacoma, WA called Paddy Coynes, this is close in flavor.  My sons like it and that is a compliment.  A bit dry compared to what I've had before but best internet recipe yet...  Will make again!

Well, this should be interesting.  My bread rose beautifully - even at high altitude (7220) and using 1/3 whole wheat flour; but seemed to bake pretty fast.  I divided the dough into two smaller bread pans, as one reviewer suggested.  Then I discovered - about half an hour later when I checked the bread - that I left out the melted butter!  Still tastes okay, especially with marmalade - and anyone who wants to can spread butter on it themselves.  I'm satisfied.  Since I was making this to go along with an Irish breakfast/brunch, I think it'll still be great.  I did add a splash of currants.  Next time will also add some caraway.  Ha!  Lowfat bread!

I loved this bread. No idea whether or not it's "authentic" as I've never had Irish soda bread before, but I really liked it. It has a slightly sweet taste, almost like a cake or a doughnut, but not as sweet. It crumbled a lot when I tried to slice it. I served it with slices of Guinness-infused Irish cheddar and pear as a snack before dinner on St. Patrick's Day. I would definitely make this again, if not for authenticity then for taste.

I made this today and it was great, threw in a handful of raisins.  Put some flour in my hands and put it on a cookie sheet with parchment and it came out just fine. Has a great taste.

For 3/17 I tried a neighbor's recipe for Irish soda bread and it was great - but I thought that buttermilk might give the bread a better taste. My next mistake was not using a loaf pan, as directed. I used a shallow tin, as I did last time, but apparently the buttermilk causes the bread to rise and it spilled all over the oven.  I rescued it as best I could, and it came out tasty, but somewhat crumbly. Probably due to the interruption in baking when i had to clean out the oven. So if you try it, use a deep pan!

Two very important items that are traditionally in Irish Soda Bread are missing and VERY important. Raisens and Carraway seeds. Add 1 cup raisens, and  2 teaspoons carraway seeds and this will turn into a great recipe! Another option is to cook the bread in a caste iron skillet.

Awesome & so easy!  A 5 star for sure!  I did add 1 1/2 cups of raisins & baked in a round 8" baking pan (spring form works well too) I made 2 loafs (one with raisins and one without) to take to work.  Both were big hits and I was asked for the recipe by 4 co-workers. It does get better with age and is excellent toasted with butter.  Karin, thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is different than any other Irish soda bread I have made...in a good way though.This bread is more moist than other recipes that I've tried. I used currants instead of raisins because we like the delicate flavor and the fact that they are smaller than raisins and disperse better in the batter.I used 1 cup of winter white whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup all purpose flour. It was great and added more nutrition too. All of my family enjoyed this bread. They'd toast a slice and eat with butter or jam while warm. A real comfort food.

My 12 year old daughter made this herself which speaks for the ease of this recipe.  All ingredients commonly found in hand with the exception of buttermilk which we substituted with plain yogurt, and had good results.  This came out of the oven-in anticipation for St. Patricks day.  It never lasted and was gone within an hour of being baked.  What a wonderful bread!  Never had it before so the texture was somewhat cakelike, slightly sweet and a pleasant surprise. Can't wait to try this recipe again with raisens, only I better make it on St. Patricks day-not the day before!   Thanks Karin!

This was my first time ever eating irish soda bread, and it was wonderful! I didn't have buttermilk so, as another reviewer suggested, I put a tablespoon of vinegar per cup of milk to substitute.  I made the bread one night, wrapped it in aluminum foil as the directions stated, and served it with corned beef and cabbage the next evening.  My husband,daughter and I all loved it!

This was my first time making soda bread, and it turned out well.  The consistency was somewhere between cornbread and pound cake.  That may sound a little off, but I don't believe I've ever tried this before, so I'm not sure what to compare it to.  I did add 2 small boxes of raisins to the battter per other reviewers recommendations.  Mine came out really moist...I'm assuming because of the buttermilk.  I didn't have the patience to wait several hours before doing a taste test...and it was really good right out of the oven.  The rest of the loaf will have chance to "age" a bit before I try it again and I'll see how much better it tastes.  Thanks for sharing Karin.

I added 1 Tbsp of caraway seeds and 1 1/2 cuo of plumped raisins to the dry ingredients before combining with the wet ingredients. This addition made this Irish Soda Bread perfect for breakfast.  

I've tried other recipes for irish Soda Bread but none of them have been as moist as this one. My husband approved and he is a tough critic.

I took the advice Apaeth and left the bread at room temp for about 40 minutes before putting it in the oven.  The bread baked perfectly.  It turned out light, fluffy and moist unlike other Irish soda breads I have had.

This is a fantastic and easy bread to make. We have eaten it with all sorts of soups and stews, as well as by itself with a little strawberry jam. As long as it isn't over mixed it's the best simple bread I make!

Just made this and it is fabulous.  I divided the batter (looks a lot like cake batter not dough) between two smaller loaf pans.  I put raisins in one half and left out of the other.  They baked in about 30 minutes which would mean the recipe bake time for one large loaf is right on target. Soft interior with a nice tender outer crust.  One reviewer said they were similar to a muffin and I would agree.  We spread whipped butter on it while it was hot.  Awesome!  This is the only recipe I will use from now on.  It's that good.

This was very good and my family liked it, but I am giving it four stars because it did not taste like my idea of traditional Irish Soda bread.

I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, 1.5 cups all-purpose flour; doubled the sugar (husband likes it sweet) and double the butter. Also took the other reviewer's advice and let sit for 30 minutes before baking to allow the leavening agents to work their magic. very nice recipe.

Made this for the first attempt turned out very good. Wish could do something to cut down on the taste of the baking powder and baking soda. Did not add the raisins will do it the next time. Should say it is a realiable recipe.

After reading all the reviews claiming that the bread was far too bland, I added 1/3 cup of brown sugar, two extra tbsp of butter, 1 tsp of almond extract, 1/4 cup walnuts, and 1/2 of dried fruit mixture. It came out moist and delicious and perfect to have with coffee for breakfast.

Great recipe.  I did let the batter rest for 30 minutes while I preheated the oven, as suggested by APAETH.  The batter was very dense and almost filled my 9x5 loaf pan, but I did not have any overflow problems.  I followed the recipe as written with one exception, I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  As for the naysayers who balk that this isn’t “traditional” Irish soda bread, “Variety is the spice of life.”,  and I’ll take “Irresistible” Irish soda bread over traditional any day.  This is a terrific recipe to build on, or make as written.  Thanks Karin!

Husband and I loved it!  As recommended by another reviewer, we let it sit 30 min prior to baking and it came out GREAT.  I would normally have thrown in raisens but in an attempt to get my kids to eat it, I left them out.  Big mistake, they didnt eat it and my husband and I missed the traditional version with the raisens.  Next time, I will add the raisens and not worry about the kids!

if i wanted sandwich bread, i wouldn't use this. I love the cake like texture and sweetness that came through with the raisins which I normally LOATHE but I soaked a handful of black raisins in warm warm water for about 5 minutes, and threw those in. as for buttermilk, I really didn't want to leave my apartment so I did the milk and vinegar/lemon juice thing (per 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of an acid) so moist! happy st. patricks day!

I don't know what irish soda bread is supposed to be like, but this recipe was really easy and delicious. I decreased the amount of sugar a lot, because I wanted it more savory. I also baked it as a big round on a parchmint paper lined cookie sheet. Delicious, just a bit crumbly.

I've never had soda bread so I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. I didn't want it to be sweet so I omitted the sugar. Followed everything else exactly and it was delicious, basically like a biscuit in loaf form. And it was really easy, all ingredients most people have stocked in their kitchens at all times except maybe for the buttermilk. I'll definitely make this again.

My God... it was incredible.  Everyone was raving over how delicious and moist it was.  After adding the melted butter, I added some green food coloring for cheesy St. Pat's goodness.  I needed somewhere around 15 drops to get the desired color.  Just fine without raisins, which apparently aren't traditional anyway.

Really, really delicious.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2c. milk with 2T. vinegar.  I added about 1 cup yellow raisins to the batter and about 1t. fennel seeds.  I also sprinkled green colored sugar all over the top before I baked it.  Festive and yummy! Really good warm with butter....

A good, moist Irish Soda Bread. Some notes, however: 1. The photo shows raisins in the bread - there are no raisins called for in the recipe.  An inexperienced baker would not know the technique for adding raisins. 2.  My bread was done in 60 minutes. The bread was moist and wonderful.   3.  Additionally,it is great eaten shortly after baking, and does not need to be "wrapped in foil for several hours".  Just give it a little time to cool slightly. Thanks for a good recipe!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I used the irish soda bread in the Irish Breakfast recipe.  I also used 2 teaspoons of caraway seeds and a 1 cup of raisins suggested by other reviews for the bread.  The raisins and caraway seeds really go good together with a unique taste I haven't had before.

I was extremely interested in trying this bread because of the lack of yeast which isn't something I have exactly perfected yet and I am so glad that I did! I have tried another Irish Soda Bread recipe and I ended up w/ a hockey puck but this one came out perfectly. This bread is so delicious warm with butter and jam or toasted to go along with soups or stews. I did change a few things based on my own preferences though. I used all whole wheat flour and canola oil instead of butter to cut down on the saturated fat but other than that everything else remained the same. I would highly recommend this bread to anyone because it is fantastic.

Delicious!  Buttery, short, slightly sweet, very moist.  Devoured!  Easy recipe.  I used powdered buttermilk reconstituted with water; added about a 1/2 C. raisins.  Fantastic recipe.  Thank you.

Wow, was this good!  I highly recommend it!  I have an Irish background, so this bread piqued my interest.  It is a cross between a fluffy biscuit and sweet cornbread.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness, and baked up moist and fluffy.  I didn't think it needed raisins, as others suggested.  It is super versatile - could be served with a hearty soup, as a snack, or with a cup of coffee for breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT recipe! I've made it many times and people love it. You can cut it in thick slices and freeze them for weeks. I put the slices in the toaster till they are light golden brown and spread jam or butter on them for breakfast. I love it!! Thank you!

After reading a whole lot of the reviews (whew!), I decided this was a recipe I should try.  I regularly make whole wheat yeast bread, but my horrid cold made me unwilling to spend the time and energy on it today.  Our family has dairy allergies, so I have to re-vamp recipes to fit that need.  This one came out great!!!  I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour (a lighter texture than regular whole wheat flour) since we prefer whole grains, 1/4 c. honey instead of the sugar, Ener-G egg replacer powder for the egg, 1 T. lemon juice in Silk soymilk rather than buttermilk, and substituted 2 T. light olive oil rather than 1/4 c. butter.  I doubled the recipe and my 7- and 10-year-old boys and I just about finished one loaf with lunch!  Wow, was it GOOD.  One son made a sandwich (lettuce and soy cheese) and the rest disappeared with a "butter" spread and honey.  Hope my daughter and husband like it as well when they take it in their lunches tomorrow.  Guess if I don't feel up to yeast bread after that, I'll make some more of this!

Excellent bread.  Try adding garlic & shredded cheese to one loaf, and chopped apples, brown sugar, cinnamon as a topping to the other.  Freeze extra and heat in oven, excellent and really easy

I love this recipe!  I have been making it for the past 3 years and everyone always wants the recipe.  It is moister and a little sweeter than most soda breads.  Sometimes I put dried currants or cranberries for a little twist. YUMMY!

MMmmmmm. Tastes like a fresh scone in every slice. Delicious and so moist. Would be wonderful with some raisins. I'll try it with the addition of raisins next time.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted fine, but it DID NOT TASTE LIKE SODA BREAD.  It is a fine basic bread recipe but it is not authentic and does not have a soda bread/crumbly taste.

Absolutely Delicious!!! The best Irish Soda Bread 
recipe by far! Nice and moist and makes a nice, high loaf. I added raisins and caraway seeds and a tsp. of vanilla. My family loved it- a definite 
keeper!!!  Thank you Karin!

Idiot-proof!  GREAT bread!  I HATE raisins and seeds in my Irish bread - I know that sounds crazy but I was glad to find this recipe. VERY EASY to throw together, EXCELLENT when smeared with butter. This will now be my standard Irish Bread recipe! Thank you!!!

I've never made or tasted Irish Soda Bread before, so I don't know how authentic this recipe is, but it tasted wonderful.  It was extremely easy to make, and very attractive.  Taste wise, it was very good, especially toasted with jam.  Next time, I would add caraway seeds and golden raisins to add some extra flavor.

The soda bread was good.  Not as sweet as we expected, based on the soda bread from our favorite Irish resturant, but still really good.  It made a LARGE loaf, but fit fine in my 9x5 pan.  I was a bit worried about the taste, but as others suggested, I let it sit over night and it was better.  Will surely make again!

I usually follow a different recipe for Irish Soda Bread, but decided to try this one since it was in the Feb/Mar '15 AR magazine.  I was unsure how I'd like it since egg is not traditionally in Irish soda bread.  Maybe it's because I live at a slight elevation (~3400') and the egg helped it not get as dry and crumbly as the other recipe, but the texture of this was FABULOUS!  Of course, I added a heaping cup of currants as well as some caraway seeds. Delish smeared with Kerrygold Irish butter. Will be making again for sure!

IRISH soda bread DOES NOT have raisins. Brack, scones or other sweet cakes/breads do, but plain old (white or brown) soda bread does NOT. Stop messing with her recipe, it's absolutely perfect. One tip to keep from over-kneading is that when the dough feels like your earlobe, it's ready.

I do a Foodie Friday night, where I cook for 12 to 18 people.  I have served this bread 3 times.  People rave about it.  I had never tried it before this past St. Paddy's day and now it is in the regular rotation.  Thank you for this great recipe.  I am going to try to make it in cupcake tins this time, to get individual portions.

YUMMY RECIPE!!!  My entire family approved (from the hubby, to the pre-teen, to the elementary kid, to the toddler!)

I made this recipe as-is except for one thing.  I didn't have any buttermilk.  Normally, I would simply make my own (mix in 2 tablespoons to 2 cups of milk and let it sit for a few minutes until it begins to sour).  
This time, however, I had sour cream.  I'd read that you can replace buttermilk with 3 parts yogurt and 1 part milk.  So I used sour cream instead of the yogurt.  Basically, I used 1-1/2 cups sour cream and 1/2 cup milk.
The bread baked with the creamiest texture I've had from a bread in a long time.  It was absolutely delicious!!!

For years I have tried different Irish soda bread recipes in an attempt to replicate the wonderful bread my Irish grandmother used to make.  But, they all came out too dry.  When I saw the high ratio of buttermilk to flour in this recipe, I decided to give it a try. I substituted a cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all-purpose flour and decreased the sugar to 2 tablespoons (else I though it would be too sweet). When it was done cooking I turned off the oven and let it sit for an additional 10 minutes to get a nice, crunchy crust.
The bread was delicious. Not as dry as most recipes, not too sweet (given my alteration) and with a crunchy, nutty crust.
I also dusted the pan with a little cornmeal after buttering it, as I think my grandmother used to do that. This was perfect and my family is loving it whether or not it is 'authentic.'

Made this bread for part of our Easter dinner, and everyone like it very well. It was a little sweeter than what I normally like, but still, very good. Didn't change anything at all. Will make again because it is so simple, fast, and easy! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Karin.

Yum!  I didn't have actual buttermilk, so I made my own (using the vinegar + milk trick).  Very delicious and super easy.  Will make this more often and not just 3/17!

I thought this was very good, but it isn't the "exact" recipe for Irish soda bread, so thats why i gave it 4 stars. Other than that I would recommend making it! I did add a little more sugar (i have a sweet tooth) and let the the batter sit for a half hour in my fridge before putting it in the pan and baking it. Enjoy!

This is a really good recipe for Irish soda bread. I have another one that I have been using for years that calls for more sugar than this one. I think I'll up the sugar in this one to 1/2 cup next time, just to give it a little more sweetness.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it turned out great the very first try. I did add 1/2c raisins but will probably add 3/4c next time. I used not quite 2 tbs caraway seeds based on a recommendation of a friend but I may use either less next time or leave it out and try it that way. Very tasty and perfectly crusted, etc.

I havn't tasted this yet as it is still baking and I am not looking forward to it. The dough was way too soupy I had to add about 1 c of wheat flour and it smells like it is way too bland. I will be very surprised if this si good, but will edit my review if it is.

Add raisens or currants, let sit after mixing so chemicals can work for about 30 minutes.  Cool in pan and store in airtight container once  cooled.  Soda bread is meant to be served with stew and is rather plain.

This was great! Easy to prepare- I did add raisins, and the whole thing tasted lovely. My Irish mother found it more authentic than the last soda bread recipe I tried, and it tasted better, too.

I thought it was delicious as did the rest of my family.  I even took some to work and was told it was the best Irish Soda bread they had ever eaten.  I did add raisins, and before serving just a little smear of butter.  It was yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make it every St. Patty's day.

Five stars. Didn't change anything and bake time was spot on. I did have to sour my own milk with lemon juice and did add golden raisins. But would be good without raisins if you dislike. I did like one reviewer's tip of leaving the raw dough out for 30 minutes to let the baking soda/powder react for a lighter loaf. Worked well.

I added 1 tblsp caraway seed as well as 1/2 cup raisins.  I think next time I will let it set for the 1/2 hours as recommended in order to assist in the rising process.  However, it was delicious!

This bread is delicious!  Very quick and easy.  It turned out lighter than the soda bread I've had at our local Irish pub, and I'm not sure why, but it was still very good!

Recipie worked great, even in my convection oven.  Only critique is that the ingredients are missing rasins.  I added 1 cup of golden and a dash of cinnamon in with flour to enhance the rasins taste.  Would also try with dried cranberries or even dried cherries, dried blueberry.

I made this for a crafts group and 4 out of 6 of the women wanted the recipe!  It was delicious.  I added about a 1/2 cup of raisins - next time I will add a bit more.

Pretty tasty!  This was my first attempt at soda bread and I liked it a lot.  I had to change it a little, I used 1 cup of homemade buttermilk (skim milk and vinegar) and 1 cup evaporated milk.  Also I didn't add the butter.  Not too sweet but a good flavor.  Will definitely make this one again.

Woweewowow!  This might not be a "traditional" soda bread but boy oh boy is it ever tasty.  I've made it with & without currants & it's equally delicious.  Tastes even better after a couple of days - if lasts that long.  Definitely a keeper.

Love it.  Very easy and delicious.  My son had to make food representing another country for a school project.  He picked this recipe and made it.  It was a hit.  Everyone loved it and now we make it every year on Saint Patrick's Day.

Very good, nice and moist! I tried this and Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread (another recipe on this site) at the same time. Personally I prefer it to this recipe, (it has more of a bread texture and this recipe is a bit sweeter and more cakey) but some of my family liked this recipe better, both are delicious! I used whole wheat, and it was wonderful! I did add rasins. Yummy!

Fab recipe. First time I have ever made it.  We don't get buttermilk in the UK so readily so I used white vinegar in semi-skimmed milk to make it sour. Very very nice!!

This is great, quick and super easy bread that uses ingredients you probably have in your pantry. I'll be honest - I didn't have buttermilk so I just used regular skim milk and it still tasted great - I can only imagine it tasting better with buttermilk.

This was a fantastic bread! I made this in my Kitchen Aid mixer and took less than 5 mins. I did add in about a cup of dried currants to add some sweetness plus I had some sitting in the pantry from another recipe. I followed the advice of another reviewer and let the bread sit for about 30 mins after mixing and pouring into the pan prior to baking. Then I let it sit overnight after baking before slicing. Served with Myers Lemon Curd and a cup of coffee (sorry, I can't do tea in the mornin') and it was DELICIOUS! Thank you *so* much for sharing!

Before making this, I'd never had Irish soda bread, so I can't comment on authenticity. From what I've read though, this is probably sweeter than traditional soda bread. Anywho, this is really tasty! I made it last night (wrapped in foil after cooling) and tried it this morning. Really good toasted with a dab of butter on top. I did let the dough sit for about 30 minutes in the pan before baking. Thanks for sharing this! :)

This was the worst bread I have ever made, it was in the oven for almost 90 minutes,and it still never really got done, not only that, but I followed the recipe, and only put in one loaf pan (big mistake, as it seeped over the pan on the oven floor)  Also the recipe picture showed raisins but never mentioned it in recipe. I put a 1/2 cup of raisins in anyway, after boiling them in water for a while.  The raisins went to the bottom of the pan.  After I took it out of oven, it started to shrink in the pan, when I did try ant taste it,( the next day) it was greasey at the bottom and that is when I found that it was not done in the middle.   Never going to use this recipe again. Which is a real shame as most of the recipes turn out really good on this site.

This is a wonderful recipe. Served it for lunch today along with Irish Bacon and Cabbage Soup from this website. All the other soda bread recipes I've tried have been rather bland & dry but this one was a huge hit with my guests. Nice & moist with just a touch of sweetness. I noticed the picture that was with the recipe looked like it contained raisins so I added about 1/2 cup of them to the flour mixture & it was just about right. This recipe will definately be added to my favorites!
EDIT: March 16, 2010 Just a note to tell you that you really should bake this in 2 pans, not one. I forgot about that, baked it in one larger pan & the middle did not get done, even though it tested done with a toothpick. I put it back in the pan, back in the oven for another half hour & it still was a little "doughy" so I sliced it & put it under the broiler until golden brown...YUM..wonderful!! Served it with Colcannon Soup & fresh fruit for dessert.

What a disappointment. From the reviews, I expected a dense, moist, loaf and what I ended up with was a dry, hard, flavorless hunk of bread that overflowed during baking despite following the recipe exactly as written. Will not make again.

I cannot eat bread, I have a gluten allergy, but I live to bake, it is a passion and my family always loves it when I make something different.  I had 1/2 a container of buttermilk in the fridge form a gluten free bread I had made for myself and I didn't want to throw the rest away.  My mom loves her Irish cakes and breads so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  She couldn't stop raving about it, my brother in law wants me to make more.  I made 2 loaves, one with currents and raisins and another just plain.  Both are getting gobbled up, this will be a holiday staple for all occasions now. Thanks so very much for your wonderful recipe!

This was just ok. I like the flavor of the store bought ones better. It was easy to make, but I took off an extra star because I made the recipe exactly as written and it overflowed in the pan. After reading the reviews, I see others have had that same problem. If you need to read the reviews before preparing the recipe to avoid mistakes there is a problem with the recipe as it is written.

i did not measure too closely and had some trouble with my oven but the bread still turned out very well. I like it much better than the last store-bought soda bread i had and feel confidant that it will turn out even better next time i make it.

This was my first attempt at making Soda Bread and it turned out wonderful. I know the recipe says to let it cool overnight before eating it, but it smelled so good in the oven as it was baking that I couldn't resist. I was not disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and unlike other reviewers, I thought it was perfect without raisins.

I originally made this recipe for my daughter's 3d grade International Food Day. I have since made this recipe dozens of times.  It tastes the absolute best on the 2nd day!  Now when I make it I don't even cut it the 1st day, just wrap up and leave overnight!  I serve it with a cup of fresh brewed black tea.  Our  favorite topper is lemon curd.

WOW!!! This is a great and easy soda bread. The only change I made was I used dark brown sugar in place of the white. We ate it right out of the oven still hot. It smelled so good that we just couldn't wait. It has that nice dense texture of soda bread but with fluffyness to it. A snap to make. I will def. be making this again and again. I love soda bread and have been looking for that right recipe. I know this is not exactly traditional but who cares when it's this good. The ingredients are very traditional but it has more liquid then usual making it a batter like bread which is an idea i love. Next time i might add rasins and caraway seeds for a real authentic taste. My husband is European and we only use European butter wich is much tastier then American butter. Try to find it in your supermarket...it's worth the price. This is what really makes it taste just right.

The bread comes out too moist.  This soda recipe tastes more like a cake - moist and little too spongy.  It doesn't toast up well the next day since it's a bit too wet, but unlike other recipes, this one probably taste best out of the oven.  But if you're looking to keep one on hand for a few days to make toast, this is definitely not the one.  I made the recipe as is and added 1 cup of raisins. I prefer the Irish Soda Bread I from this site instead - which is outstanding.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted two cups of milk plus two tablespoons cider vinegar. I also added a little brown sugar, 2/3 cup of raisins and 1/3 cup chopped chocolate.  It came out awesome (though obviously more like a dessert bread than traditional soda bread).  I'll definitely be making this one again.

I don't know a thing about authenticity when it comes to Irish soda bread, but regardless, my family really enjoys this bread.  I do add raisins or chocolate chips to the batter and we love it fresh from the oven, so I don't know why the recipe says to wait a day to eat it.  We eat it like a dessert, warm with butter.  Yum!

Great soda bread!  I've baked it in a 10" cast iron skillet and a round stoneware casserole dish, and it turned out great both times.  Be sure to grease the pan if not using well-seasoned cast iron.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I make again and again!

This bread is very good. The recipe shows the picture with raisins, but they are not listed in the recipe as the other irish soda breads are. I put them in after I coated them in Irish Whiskey. It turned out very good. I like the slightly sweet taste and the moist texture.

Couldn't be happier with this recipe. I  use an oiled clay plant saucer for the prepared pan. I think it gives it more crust which is what my husband likes.  Impresses the in-laws! Great with crockpot soups and stews.

My inlaws who hail from Dublin seemed amused by this "Irish soda bread" and informed me it's nothing like the stuff they grew up with there.  However, they loved it and I wouldn't be surprised if this is even better than the "real" thing! I have another recipe I use which is also called Irish soda bread and is made with whole wheat flour.  My inlaws call it something else. Whatever.  This is easy and delicious and I served it with clam chowder to rave reviews.

I chose this recipe because of the 5-star rating, and it lived up to my expectations.  The directions were easy to follow, and most importantly, it was delicious.  The light flavor & texture of this recipe has made this my favorite soda bread. Thanks for submitting this, Karin!

I must admit that we did not care for the bread. As an avid baker I know that it is of the utmost importance to follow the directions to the T as I did with this recipe. After seeing the mixture I felt that it needed more flour and less liquid. However, I baked it exactly as directed. We found it to be to moist on the inside, almost doughy; to crumbly on the outside, almost to dry. The flavor is not too bad on first bite, however, leaves the after taste of baking soda/baking powder which is terribly unpleasant and tough to shake.

This recipe is quick, easy, and VERY tasty.  I added carraway seeds. Next time I make it, I may get bold and add golden raisins, as some people suggested.

While not technically "The" Irish Soda bread, this bread is actually very tasty! It's much moister and less dense than traditional soda bread, more like a quick bread texture. But the taste is the same, and some people I gave it to enjoyed the moister version better. Hint: If you don't have buttermilk, you can sour regular milk with 1 tbsp. lemon juice per cup of milk.

This is the best tasting soda bread that I have ever made.  Very easy.  Will make again and add golden raisins next time.  This will be my "regular" soda bread recipe.  I will pass it on to my Irish sisters.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Karin, 
We (friends at work) really enjoyed your recipe.  I made 2 different Irish Soda Bread recipes for St. Patrick's Day and preferred yours; it was light and delicious.  I did not add anything extra (I usually add raisins and caraway) and thought it was tasty just the way it was. I wrapped it in foil overnight and it was moist the next morning. Thank you for sharing.

Good, but not what I expected.  This is the first recipe for Irish Soda Bread that 
I have tried.  It was sweeter than I expected and the texture reminded me of a
pound cake.  For wall1971, a Weight Watcher who wrote a review 3/16/02, I used
Splenda for the sugar, used nonfat egg substitue for the egg, and reduced fat
margarine, bringing the point count down to 3.  I also found the slices quite thick.  
I was satisfied with thinner slices producing 20 servings, 1.75 pt per slice.

This is much better that my old recipe of soda bread. I made a few subistitutions, though.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups of regular flour, and used brown sugar instead of white. Very good, moist bread.

This recipe tastes more like corn bread then soda bread. The egg and sugar dilutes the slightly sour taste which is soda bread. A good bread recipe, but lacks the 'soda' quality I was looking for. I will keep looking.

I have tried this recipe several times and it is wonderful! I needed to bring bread to an Irish dinner. In planning the dinner, the group said "Let's avoid Irish Soda Bread. It's always so dry and tasteless." This recipe changed everyone's mind!
Recommend the largest bread pan you have. When I used 9x5 it spilled over. When I used 9 5/8 x 5 1/2 it was just fine.

THIS IS NOT THE TRADITIONAL IRISH SODA BREAD (WHERE YOU SHAPE IT YOURSELF - NO PAN) BUT ITS DELICIOUS. I USED DRIED CRANBERRIES INSTEAD OF RAISINS (1 1/2 CUP) FOR CHRISTMAS AND ALSO SOME ORANGE RIND FOR COLOR AND FLAVOR.

My first time making soda bread, and I am so happy I chose this recipe! It couldn't have been easier to throw together. It baked up perfectly in 65 min for me. The hardest part was giving it time to sit after baking. Finally tried it today, and it is delicious, moist and just a little sweet.

This recipe is amazing! I thought the dough was a little wet and had to add more flour. I ended up putting the dough in muffin tins and made rolls. You can not mess this recipe up! I FORGOT about the rolls in the oven, and they were in the oven for who knows how long. They were still perfect!

I've made this several times with great results. The last time I decided to add in some leftover cheeses from a party. I crumbled white chocolate raspberry cheese, merlot cheese and blueberry goat cheese. It probably totaled 6-8 ounces for a double batch. Fabulous!. Now I will find other leftovers to add in to make unique creations.

Great recipe.  It may not be traditional but it is so much better than any other soda bread I've tasted.  Sifted dry ingredients. Mixed dry ingredients and wet only to the point where some dry was still visible.  Let batter rest 30 minutes before baking.  Mixed some melted butter with buttermilk and brushed top before baking and halfway through.  Everybody loved it!

I've tried several Soda Bread recipes and this one is by far my favorite.  I always follow the advice of the reviewer who suggests to let the bread sit at room temp for 30 minutes before baking.  My loaves are always light (for Soda Bread, of course) with a beautiful crust and crumb.

I have no idea if this bread is authentic or not, but the taste fit perfectly with the corned beef and cabbage meal.  Didn't even need butter.  I made as directed -- the evening before --  and wrapped in aluminum foil overnight. I can't speak to recommendations that it needs raisins because I hate raisins in bread -- Will make again.

I will start by saying that I made both this recipe and the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread recipe.  Both highly rated and both lived up the hype.  I did add raisins to both as it seemed traditionally correct, having said that I'm no expert on Irish Soda Bread tradition.  I followed the recipes as listed with one exception.  I baked on a tad bit lower heat and baked for a tad bit longer.  Not sure what some posters meant when they said it didn't turn out good.  I'm no baker, but these 2 recipes have to be as easy as it gets.  Gave them both 4 stars as they both came out great.

i was so happy to find a recipe that did not add raisins! most soda bread recipes are much more sweet than traditional irish soda bread - i have reduced the sugar in this recipe but its just as good with the 1/3 cup. this goes together quickly, and you can substitute 2 tbsp. lemon juice and enough milk to make 2 cups for the buttermilk if you don't have it on hand.

I saw Irish Soda Bread on a Julia Child show on PBS, and it looked so easy, I thought I would try it! This bread is delicious...honestly the dough has a very thick consistency that tasted like pancake batter (yum) and the end result reminded me of a cornbread consistency. I hope that's what it's supposed to be like! (haha) Bottom line, this is a very quick, very easy bread..even my boyfriend liked it and he's not a bread guy. I will definatley make this again!!! 
P.S. I did let the dough sit at room temp for 30 minutes, before baking

I hate to go against all the five stars, but this bread was just average. I substituted one cup of white whole wheat for one cup of AP flour. We ate it warm last night and it tasted like corn bread. Today, now that it's cool, the bread is rather bland and there's a strong baking powder aftertaste. If I made this again, I would definitely decrease the amount of baking powder. I have made better soda breads and will probably not make this again.

Made a delicious, moist bread.  I don't know if it is true Irish soda bread, as every one I have ever had has been dry and not very flavorful.  This was so good and sliced beautifully.  Thank you for this recipe.

I make this for our church's Wednesday Night's meal. I calculate it for 65 using more buttermilk and butter so that I can bake it in 2 huge flat cookie pans. That way I can cut it into bars. Then I rub melted butter over it!!! Delicious and a huge hit!!! Leftovers stay moist!!! Love this!!!

Traditional or not, this bread received rave reviews at our St. Patrick's Day meal. It is similar in texture to a muffin---soft, yet substantial. I did not add raisins, but that is up to the individual. Very easy to prepare! I recommend trying this recipe.

I made this once.  And then I made it nine more times.  Friends and family drop not-so-subtle hints when they're ready for their next slice.  Serves up beautifully with sweet and savory dishes and is utterly easy to whip up.

This was easy to do, took only one bowl to mix up, and was delicious.  Would make it again.  Not too sweet.  Buttermilk flavor is subtle especially a few hours after it's made.  Nice accompaniment to dinner.

Super easy.  Super delicious.  I had never had this before and was surprised to find it tasted like a cross between cornbread and a biscuit.  Great warm with butter and honey.

I made this and added raisins, it was awesome!  It did have a different density compared to the Irish soda bread I've had at Irish restaurants, but I still loved it and so did everyone else who tried it.

I made this with the help of two 3-year-olds during a play date on St. Patrick's Day.  It was fantastic!  It reminds me of a dense version of corn bread.  It was moist, yet sweet and delicious.  I had to make my own buttermilk using lowfat milk and vinegar, and I had to substitute Smart Balance butter because I didn't realize I was out of regular butter until we had already started.  Neither substitution seemed to have a detrimental effect.   This recipe was extraordinarily simple and delicious.  This one is a keeper for sure.

This is the first time I've ever made Irish soda bread and I used this recipe and can I say, OMG it was so good!!!! We ate it very shortly after in came out of the oven it was so yummy with butter that just melted right into it and I drizzled a little bit of honey on my slice and it was like biting into heaven. I made the recipe as called for and it does not need any changes whatsoever!

Mmmmm! Great texture, easy recipe. I added 3/4c minced dried cherries and 1/2t almond extract, so my version was more of a breakfast bread, can't wait to make french toast out of the leftovers (if there are any). I will deffinatly be making this bread again, but for savory applications I will cut the sugar in half.

Awesome bread.  I didn't find it sweet or "cakey" at all, unlike some of the claims here.  I did use Splenda instead of sugar and I added 1 cup of raisins.  My bread was done in 57 minutes, nice and golden brown.  It tasted like a dense yummy biscuit with raisins.  Divine with a smear of butter.  I'll be making this more often, not just for St Patty's Day!

I thought this was great, I loved the flavor the buttermilk gave it.  I didn't think this was sweet at all and I don't care for raisins so this was perfect with our sheppard’s pie.

This bread was so easy to prepare and with common items found in most everyone's pantry and refrigerator. It baked beautifully and tastes even better! I will definitely be making the bread again and again! Thanks Karin for submitting this great recipe. :c)

Fantastic! Everyone said this was the best Irish soda bread they had ever tasted. Not dry and bland like traditional recipes. Don't forget to add at least 1/2 cup of raisins.

Turned out excellent! I baked it the night before, and served it with corned beef and cabbage. Very moist and cozy bread.

Tasted like sweet biscuits in loaf form.  Not at all like "real" soda bread.  For an authentic loaf try Irish Brown Soda Bread.

OMGOSH! This really is irresistible! I haven't ever made soda bread, and I am so happy I tried this recipe!  It was so easy and fun to make and in my gas oven it only took 50 mins to bake. It smelt so good right out of the oven that I just had to try some. It is amazing right away! I can't wait to see how it is once its sat for a bit since the recipe calls to let it rest for a few hours or overnight to help improve flavor. I'm so excited about this recipe. I'll be making this for more than just St. Patrick's Day!

I've made Irish Soda Bread every St. Patrick's Day for the last several years.  We liked it, but never had the desire to make it more than once a year.  Well, 4 recipes later, I've found a recipe that is made it into my family favorites!  This recipe is so much more MOIST and flavorful than any other recipe I have tried.  It has a flakier texture to the crust (like a biscuit,) which makes the bread different from your typical yeast breads, but oh-so-yummy.  No more waiting until St. Patrick's Day--we're adding this one to our regular culinary repertoire!

This was great! My favorite soda bread yet. I did adjust a few things to our taste (less sugar, part whole wheat flour, added dried fruit and caraway seeds to the top). The texture is fine and moist, not dry or biscuity like I am accustomed to. I think perhaps this one isn't very traditional, but I don't mind. It's delicious. I particularly liked the melted butter blended into the dough, it sort of fried itself from the inside out, which was a wonderful touch, and I'll try that with my favorite beer bread recipe sometime. I served this warm with room temperature butter; I'm sure it's equally good at other temperatures! Thanks for the recipe, we couldn't even wait until dinner to try this, lol!

This bread was DEVOURED at a recent Irish inspired family dinner.  I added raisins to one loaf and I liked that one better, but the plain one was delicious, too.  I followed the recipe exactly, and then left the batter in the pan on top of the oven for 10 minutes before baking it.  So.  Yummy.

This is a great recipe. It was easy to prepare and smelled like buttermilk biscuits as it baked. Easiest way to make great tasting bread. No yeast, rising or kneading required. Love it!

Pretty good.  Served it with honey butter.  I'm not sure if I failed to knead it long enough but it came out with a biscuit type of texture, which was good but not quite what I was expecting!

I made this as directed, without the raisins.  The store didn't have buttermilk so I just used regular milk with vinegar in it.  It is FABULOUS.  I have always found Irish Soda Bread bland and boring but this one isn't at all.  It has a great moist texture too.

This was a very nice and easy-to-make bread.  I did guess on the raisins and added about 1/2 cup, but next time would add a bit more.  Took the advice - wrapped it well and put it aside till the next morning....great warmed with butter and served with coffee!

So easy to make and my husband loves it! Its moist denseness is reminiscent of cornbread. I divided the batter into two loaf pans because there seemed to be a lot of batter for just one standard size loaf pan. In retrospect, one pan probably would have been fine. I will definitely add this recipe to my arsenal of quick breads.

This was excellent! So easy to make, and so delicious. It had a nice crunchy crust on the outside and was soft and moist on the inside. The texture reminded me a bit of cornbread. Was perfect with the stew I made for St Patrick's day. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe.  Try substituting some Guinness for part of the buttermilk.  You can also bake it in a 10-inch cast iron skillet and decrease the baking time (should take about 45 minutes).

this bread is absolutely delicious. it is like a slightly heartier, less cake-like and less sugary quick bread. perfect if you want something satisfying but not overly sweet. i prefer it with raisins added. a life-long keeper!

I love homemeade bread so for St. Patrick's Day, I decided to make this as part of my Irish themed dinner. Very good with a slab of butter. I added 1 cup of raisins. This bread reminded me of Cinnamon Raisin Bread without the cinnamon. I gave some to my 1 year old for lunch. While cleaning up her mess, she found a piece of her bread and tried to run away! So funny! Of course I didn't let her eat it but gave her another piece after she stopped crying.

So easy, and absolutely delicious!  My only problem was filling the baking pans too full..  this recipe gets real height, only fill the pans 3/4's full or less!  Ohh and only taste the batter if you want to eat a dangerous amount of it ;)

It might be irresistible but it is not soda bread. I'll skip the heritage lesson and say that if you reduce the liquids by half, knead the dough and add a cross hatch then you will have a decent version of soda bread that a non-Celt could love.

This is a crowd-pleaser. I substiuted two cups of 1% milk with two tablespoons of lemon juice( letting it stand for 5 minutes) rather than buttermilk. The recipe produced a moist, flavorful, delicious bread that two of my guests requested the recipe for. This may not be traditional soda bread, but it certainly is a great rendition.

I gave this two stars instead of one, simply because it doesn't actually taste bad.  But there is no way that this is Irish soda bread!  It tastes like a big sweet muffin.  Had you put this in front of me for a taste test, Irish soda bread wouldn't have even entered my mind.  Sorry.

I made the recipe exactly as stated. It did not overflow the pan as others have stated. The bread was done about 11 minutes before the given time. I think it could have used some sprucing up as the flavor was not quite there and the texture was all right. I would not make it again as given.

It was like a fluffy scone, and honestly, I'm not really into scones that much. However, I do appreciate their regional authenticity.

Very good.  The picture shows raisin's but the recipe didn't call for it so I didn't use them and the bread is suppose to have a plain flavor to it but this wasn't too bad!

The taste was similar to the soda bread I grew up with, but the recipe is definitely lacking raisins and used a bit too much sugar. Soda bread shouldn't be so sweet. Also, after one day, the bread became quite crumbly and difficult to slice.

I tried this one, with the addition of caraway seeds and rasins, for St. Patty's
Day and loved it so much I am making it again for Easter! REALLY easy and very, very tasty. My grandmother was from the Isle of Mann, so I know this is not a traditional Irish soda bread, but that is ok...All you have to do is add an eggs worth of buttermilk, delete the rasins, caraway seeds, egg, and sugar and you are pretty close to the soda bread my Nanna used to make!

Raisins are a must for this delicious, moist, slightly sweet loaf.  Super quick, easy and it rose beautifully.  I used a 9x3 instead of 9x5 and it worked fine.  Definite make again.

Absolutely delicious! I really want to give this recipe a 5, but like another reviewer said, it's missing one key ingredient: raisins. I'm not a huge fan or raisins, but I'm so glad I added them (a little less than 1 c., next time, I'll add a heaping cup full). Not Irish Soda bread whatsoever, but really really good.. think banana or pumpkin bread texture. Thanks so much and I will be making this again and again!

It's ok, but nothing special. I added 1 cup dark raisins to the batter as some of the reviews stated. It looks beautiful, but lacking flavor. It's kind of like a loaf of biscuit-raisin bread. Maybe adding some cinnamon would give it more flavor.  Sorry, but I won't make it again.

Very good.  Served with "Guinness Corned Beef," "Fabulous Fried Cabbage" (both from this site), and some roasted root veggies.  I made the bread the night before and let it sit overnight (wrapped in foil).  I did have trouble with it spilling out of the loaf pan as it started to cook, so I quickly put a cookie sheet on the rack below to catch any more spills.  The top wasn't neat looking, but I served it sliced on a plate and nobody knew the difference! Thanks!

Fantastic. Only change was to use 1/4 c of egg substitute instead of the one egg. Also added some raisins. This is some of the best bread I've made.

Followed another review and added 1 1/2 c. raisins.  I am not a soda bread expert, but I think it was pretty good.  Husband loves soda bread abnd thought this was great! My only mistake was cooking for 60 minutes and finding the middle still gooey.

Bread is usually not something I attempt to make as it takes so much time and effort.  However, this bread is incredibly easy and fast to whip up--although it was hard to get the bread done in the middle if you use a loafpan (I kept it in the oven about 10 minutes longer and put foil over it to prevent the top from burning and it finally got done!) I made it for a St. Patrick's day dinner and everyone seemed to like it.  I personally was not too sure about it--it is a little bland and dry.  However, I did not have time to let the bread sit longer than an hour and a half, and also I think that adding raisins to it would have made it more flavorful.  I will make this bread again and write another review at a later date.

Delicious and super easy.  I added dried cranberries to mine and served with the "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" recipe along with boiled Yukon gold potatoes, fresh kale and golden beets.  The bread soaked up the juice from the beef and veggies on the plate and it was fantastic.  Looking forward to using the leftover bread for other creations!

This is an awesome recipe! I put all ingredients into my bread machine to mix together.  During mixing the dough was more like a batter, as other's have mentioned.  I added about 3/4 c more of flour to give it a little more consistency.  The dough still was not a typical bread dough consistency but firmer, so that I would be able to lift the bread pan out of the machine without losing the batter through the bottom mixer hole. I added dried blueberries, soaking them prior to adding, and the blueberries give a nice sweetness, a change from raisins.  The loaf sat on my counter overnight, before I removed it.  It is a nice dense high rising bread with a nice brown outside crust and very moist dense inside.  My husband snatched a piece before I could and he loved it. We were going to go out to eat for breakfast but he commented he would just make the bread his breakfast! Will definately keep this recipe to make again. The addition of flour and blueberries made it perfect!

I accidentally doubled the butter by using a whole stick, and it was still great!  I really liked it hot out of the oven, but when I tried ot the next day, it tasted like cornbread, as others have stated.  I also poured a little butter over the top before cooking - makes a great crust!

Who knew it could be so eay.  I also add rasains.  It was yummy.  And it's true the longer it sits the better it taste.  I had to taste it right away cause it smelt so good.  But it taste way better after it sat.

I baked this last night for a St. Patrick's party and it was the first food item to go.  The smell coming from the oven was that of soda bread it tasted like proper Irish soda bread so all in all not bad for my first attempt at soda bread.  Out of this world...

Great taste, texture, and very moist.  I've never made soda bread before, so I'm not sure if this is authentic or not, but it's so good, it doesn't matter.

This was very good.  I added golden raisins and baking raisins.  I baked it at a lower temperature, but I think my oven may run a little hot.

This bread was amazing! I can't say if it was "authentic" or not, but it was so delicious that I immediately baked another loaf to share with relatives for Christmas. This one will be in our Keepers!

I found this recipe very good. Similar in taste and texture to corn bread, (which I love)and extremely easy to make. The recipe makes two 8x2 1/2 loaf pans perfectly. Just spray some cooking spray around the pans before baking, and when they come out you can easily pop them out of the pan and onto a cutting board for beautiful presentation.

I absolutely loved this recipe!! I wouldn't change a thing. I followed the recipe exactly ( except i added raisins ) and put it in for the time called for and it came out perfect. I had doubts whether it was done because it was very moist, but i guess that is how it was supposed to be because it tasted fabulous. Tastes best when it set out for a little while and warmed up and topped with jam or cream cheese!

This was okay, but I thought it was better warm.  Not all that exciting and I don't think I'll make it again.  We didn't even finish the loaf.

I don't like Irish Soda Bread, I just "don't get it" although I keep trying it from time to time to see if I "do".  THIS ONE though is totally different, not boring as the others I've tried have been.  My husband likes all bread toasted the best and it toasts up great, too.

Outstanding!  My boyfriend's teenage boys are crazy about this Soda Bread.  When I made the second time, I used four mini loaf pans, baked for about 25 minutes.  Then cut each loaf in half to make a muffin-sized piece.  Perfect for a take-a-long snack for their athletic events!

I thought the taste and texture of this bread was similar to cornbread. A little sweet, but not overdone. A good bread to go along with a main course dinner, or also a very good dessert bread or even just a wonderful snack! I was very impressed... I had never had Irish soda bread before. It was also very easy to make. Be sure to let it set as per instructions. It doesn't have the density just out of the oven. I always let mine sit overnight.

Amazing! The texture of this bread was really dense and rich, like a cross between store-bought-bread and cake. The flavor was really light, like there was kind of a sweet aftertaste. My parents both loved it and I can't stop eating it. I'm going to make it all year round, not just for St. Patrick's Day.

As a pure bred Irishwoman I have suffered through some really bad renditions of Irish soda bread.This is by far the easiest and best I've ever had. Dinner company and family raved, glad I made two loaves.

This was GOOD!  I was hunting for a traditional soda bread recipe, but when I read several reviews that described this a more cake/scone-like I decided this might be more to the kids' liking. We followed the recipe exactly, and served it with the Golden Potato Soup. (also from Allrecipes) It was a hit!  It came out soft & slightly chewy... much like a sweetbread, and tasted absolutely perfect.  We will be making this again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

"Just like Mama used to make".  The "cake-like" texture and golden brown color makes this a real treat at any meal.  Use for dobbing up soups or gravies or just plain or with a pat of butter.  You can't miss with this Irish favorite.  Ron

I don't normally have much luck in baking bread, but this recipe was so easy. The bread has more zing than the usual soda bread, which made it much more interesting and tasty.

Second year in a row I have made this one.  I think it'll be a yearly thing.  It is always better the next day.  It so filling, so I only get to eat a little of it.

This recipe was delicious! It's easy to make and is moister than traditional irish soda bread which was a welcome change. I also added raisens and caraway seeds. Thanks Karin!!

Talk about easy! Made this for my early St. Pat's day dinner. Popped it in the oven with the corned beef that was already cooking. Can't wait to try it toasted today at my coffee break! Thanks Karin!

Different type of texture from the traditional Irish bread, but still very good.  Kinda eggy and buttery, would be a natural with fruit or jams.  Went over very well with the entire family.  Very easy to prepare.  Recommend.

Really liked this recipe- it was incredibly easy and fast to whip up. I'm in total agreement in the waiting till the next day to sample. In fact it gets better each day! A perfect starter to my day with strawberry jam on top.

This was definitely a great bread for sopping up stew!  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup but felt that it needed to have been cut down a bit more.  I made 2 loaves for our St. Pat's dinner and everyone had several slices, including the kids.  (They were happy just to have it warm with butter!)

I was very dissatisfied with the recipe I used for soda bread last year. This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I made it a day ahead and wrapped it in foil as suggested; is was SOOOO moist and tasty.  My whole family loved it.

This recipie was very simple to make. . . it just took a little while to bake.  It's not what I expected, but tasted very good.  I think I expected it to be more bread-like, instead it is more like a cake.  I just made it last night, and I can imagine that it will taste better the longer it sits.  I am on weight watchers and I was suprised to find out that a serving of the bread is 4 points. . . a little on the high side for bread.

I have had other soda breads but this one has to be my favorite.  I loved the texture.  More like a cake which is how we served it the next day.  Topped with strawberries and ice cream.  Yummy!

I was surprised and pleased at the moist texture and mild, sweet taste.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!  I made it in tiny loaf pans for gifts on St. Patrick's Day, and not a single loaf went home...they gobbled them up on the spot!

This bread was a great addition to our corned beef and cabbage. Even my son who is really picky loved this bread with some butter on it. We will make this again. I'm thinking it might taste really great with Navy Bean soup as well.

I had never had soda bread before, let alone make it, and it was very good.  Initially I found it a little too cakey and bland tasting even after waiting a day, but after several days the bread was awesome!!!  Great as a make-ahead bread and very easy too!

After a previous attempt at Irish Soda Bread turned into a "hockey puck," I did not think I would ever try to make Irish Soda Bread again. However, when I read the reviews for this one, I decided to try one more time. I was not disappointed. This bread is wonderful! It is quick to make, and delicious. We had it warm shortly after it came out of the oven and it was enjoyed by all. I don't know if there will be any left to try tomorrow, when it will supposedly be even better. A definite make-again.

This bread was very easy to make.  The flavor of the bread does taste even better the next day, as suggested.  I would also use a bigger pan than the 9 x 5 (overflow problem!)...I should have heeded this advice.  But it was delicious!

Ummmmmmm, delcious, I have already made
this bread a number of times, and had
rave reviews about it each time. Even
old fashioned Germans, who have eaten
hard balck breads their whole lives,
and referred to it as cake, gave their
approval!

This bread is FABULOUS!  I have made Irish Soda Bread in the past, with caroway seeds, but did not care for it.  I decided to try this one and absolutely loved it!  It was very easy to make and has gotten consistently better over the past few days. A definite must try!!

I didn't realize this bread would be quite so sweet, but except for that surprise, it was really great.  It has a cake-like texture... you could even go as far as to serve fruit over a slice of it for a quick dessert.

I didn't make any changes.  Baked it for 60 minutes (my oven runs hot) and it turned out very moist and flavorful.  My tip would be to put this in 2 bread pans as mine spilled out and made a mess.  Will make again.

I was planning an all Irish St. Patrick’s Day dinner. This was the first time I have made soda bread use this recipe and it turned out unbelievably good. It was great with honey and I hope tomorrow it will be wonderful for dinner easy to make and turned out really well as you can see by the pictures I would give it five stars.

Fantastic soda bread! For those asking - authentic traditional Irish soda bread does not contain raisins (or seeds, or anything like that). It's just an every day sort of bread, which is (presumably) why this recipe has none. I imagine you can add as much (or little) as you like, as others have done!

I added craisins. Did not hear the oven timer so left it in oven longer than directed and it was still great! Will make it again. Love the simplicity of the recipe. I used a glass loaf pan.

Husband loved this... I liked it just fine. Buttery, dense, but not dry. I've never tried Irish Soda Bread, so I have nothing to compare it to. Very easy to make. Stayed true to the recipe.

This was really good. I wanted to use all sprouted wheat flour but serving to company so I made a back up loaf--all whole wheat. I had to add 3/4 cup more buttermilk in the sprouted loaf. Both turned out equally well. This recipe has a higher liquid to flour ratio than most other soda bread recipes, hence pouring into the loaf pan. Per my custom in recipes like this, I grated the butter in, gently coating shreds in the flour as I went. Only stirred until just combined and then let the batter sit in the parchment lined loaf pans for about 20 minutes before baking. Great rise, really tender. I used a wireless thermometer and took the bread out at 190* The sprouted loaf took about 30 minutes longer. Don't know the science probably just from the extra buttermilk. Served with honey butter and beef stew.

I've personally never had Irish soda bread before, but this bread is sweet and tastes like pound cake with the texture of bread. My whole family loved it and it was gone before I could have a second slice. 
I served it with shepherds pie and it was a really nice contrast between sweet and savory.

Love this recipe. I added 2 Tbs fresh rosemary and 1 cup parmesan cheese and I suggest to make it the day before you want to eat it the bread is best the second day. I also happen to find Irish butter which was cool so I use that and plan to make Irish stew to go with the bread. I also read a review and let the bread sit 30 minutes and it was beautifully risen an golden when it came out!

Yes, for all who say this is not a traditional ISB recipe, this may be true but, my husband, born and raised in Ireland loves and prefers this recipe.  It is has gentle sweet notes, and a more substantial texture and moist.   Slathered with a knob of butter is the best way to enjoy this "Wanna-Be ISB"  with a good cup of tea.  I add 1 1/2 cups of raisins to mine. Since this bread rises quite a bit I also divide the batter/dough into two 9x5 glass loave dishes.  Important to note, because it's divided, it is golden brown and done in 50 minutes. Perfect every time...I've made this many times.

I made this bread on St. Patrick's Day this year. It was very good. I did let the dough sit out for 30 minutes or so, I believe it helped the texture. Very good, it's a keeper!

My first time making Irish soda bread, this is a very good recipe.  I made a couple of alterations, currants in place of raisins (we are not fans of raisins) and added lemon zest (had some on hand.)

This came out like a sweet quick bread.  Think banana bread without the bananas.  I'm used to soda bread that's more of a savory bread, that's a dough not a batter bread.  This was okay for a quick bread, but not for a soda bread.

Tastes a lot like a biscuit! I followed the directions exactly, and it's a pretty tasty bread, though I wasn't expecting it to be so biscuit-y.

This makes a nice looking loaf with a crisp crust and absolutely NO FLAVOR. The texture is all wrong. It is more like a chewy cake-bread than the dry, dense and crusty round loaf that is traditional Irish soda bread. Toasting it doesn't even make it better. Never again.

It was so easy and so delicious. This is going to become a regular part of our dinners. I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I added 2 tsp. of lemon juice to my almond milk. Worked!

There are no words.... Just absolutely delicious bread. It's torture if you don't eat carbs! I think it is just sweet and moist enough that you could use it for strawberry shortcake. Also, I wrap it in foil and eat it the next day.

The texture was dense but still crumbly.  I was hoping for a softer bread.   It was better for breakfast the next day.

My husband and I are totally addicted to this bread.  Have made it twice already and will put in another loaf tonight.  Followed the recipe exactly but added lots of raisins.  Wrapped the bread overnight and each day after it became better and better! Easy and delicious!!!!!

I have tried Irish Soda Bread recipes where you have to knead and shape the loaf and this is much easier..  However, I added some caraway seeds and raisins to make it more traditional.  I worried about having the raisins sink in the bread but that wasn't a problem.  I didn't measure the amount just added a handful. This is a very moist bread, not dry at all.

I have never had Irish soda bread before so I really have nothing to compare it to however I really didn't like it. It was a little on the sweet side and tasted a lot like a pancake with a bad texture. I really didn't like the lack of flavor. I made it for a St. Patricks day party and not one finished their slice of bread. I do have to admit it was a very moist bread and that was good. The texture is a bit unsettleing and it is way too sweet for my taste.

I have never mastered the skill of baking homemade bread, but as this one did not have to be kneaded and rolled out.....just pour in the pan kind of deal......I decided to give it a try. And boy was it good! LOL! It looked just like the picture. And I have never had soda bread before ......I thought it tasted like cornbread....is it suppose to? I served it with chili. And I heated up a slice the next day and ate it even without butter....a good snack.I'll definitely be making this sweet soda bread again. Maybe with raisins the next time.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it for St. Patrick's Day yesterday and it was a huge success.  So easy to prepare. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and did not change a thing. It was so moist and tasty. This will be the only recipe I will ever use for Irish Soda Bread. Make sure to watch the video as the dough is very sticky!  Try it, it's a real winner. Thank you Karen Christian for a super recipe!

I loved this recipe. I don't like raisins in baked goods, so this was perfect for me. The bread was moist and tasted wonderful. It's great for toasting or even to make a sandwich with.  I followed the directions to a "T". Even waited to eat it after wrapping in foil for a couple hours. I'll make over and over again.

Very delicious and moist! I doubled the butter and instead of melting it I cut it into small pieces and worked it into the flour mixture with my fingers before adding the buttermilk.  If you don't have buttermilk on hand just add 2 T of lemon juice or vinegar to milk and let it sit until thick (about 10 minutes). This was my first time making Irish Soda Bread and I will certainly be making it many times again using this recipe.  It was great paired with my Dublin Coddle dish!

I have never made this before. I read reviews and after bread is in the pan I let it sit for 30 mins at room temp before I baked it. I only baked mine for 62 mins.

I made this bread again last night and this time omitted the sugar altogether. Based on this change, 2 stars (with sugar) is now 5 (without sugar)! You really need to let it sit overnight to enjoy the full flavor. While it was hot, I rubbed the top with real butter. It's dense and moist and yummy.

This is delicious! I didn't change a thing except I let batter sit in pan for 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested. This bread is soft and moist and has good flavor. I've never had Irish soda bread so I don't know if this recipe really mimics what Irish soda bread is supposed to be like. It doesn't really matter to me- the bread is great and I'm making it again in a couple days to share at a soup, salad, and bread dinner at my church.

This was a delicious recipe! I used 1Tbsp. lemon juice to 1 c. milk substitute for buttermilk. Also, I made muffins instead of bread--made 18 muffins, and baked for ~20 minutes.

A hit with our corned-beef and cabbage dinner!  Easy to make; I confused two recipes and turned this out on to a floured surface, kneaded some more flour in and shaped it in to a rough, country-bread style loaf.  It was fantastic this way.  (Though if you try it, don't expect it to knead well, it's very loose as dough, almost batter-like. Just use additional flour - enough so it doesn't stick to everything, and mold with your hands.)  I baked it on parchment paper.

I don't care what you call it; we love this recipe.  Since my DH doesn't like sweet things, I just cut the sugar in half.  I don't like raisins which makes it perfect for me.  Love the texture and ease!

If you do not have buttermilk you may use 1 tablespoon of vinegar for each cup of milk. This recipes was very easy to make and delicious. I did not need to make any adjustments, perfect the way it is.  Thanks for sharing it!

I made this for St Pat's day and it's delicious and SO easy to make. I am a very novice bread baker so I followed the instructions exactly. The loaf is almost gone and the bread is delicious with orange marmalade or cinnamon butter on it, too!

This is NOT a traditional Irish soda bread because it has sugar, eggs, and butter, and traditional bread has only four ingredients: flour, buttermilk, salt, and soda. However, this is an amazing bread. I have searched for ten years or better to find a soda bread (traditional or not) that all my kids like, and that balances the traditional flavor with a bit of richness. This is it. 
I did make one tiny change, which I think really added some character to it. No, I did not add raisins, as they are strictly forbidden in Irish soda bread, but when it came to stirring in the melted butter, I stirred in half, then poured the batter into my pan, and poured the other half all over the top of the bread before I baked it. The crust came out buttery rich and delicious while the crumb is soft, only slightly sweet, and is very rich tasting. The BEST soda bread I have found.

Cooked many new first for this Saint Patrick's day and everyone loved this bread recipe.  Hubby loved this more than the chocolate mint brownies.  Seeing that his sweet tooth is huge and the brownies were delicious as well, we will be having this again many times.  Thanks for sharing.

This is wonderful. I let it set in the loaf pan for 30 min to let it rise a bit before baking on the second loaf. both ways is good.

I loved this recipe and so did my kids!  We eat it as it is originally on here with dinners and  I modified it to make a desert bread out of it   .  All the ingredients from the original except add 2/3 cups sugar, 1 tsp of cocoa when adding the liquids add 1 cup of of diced maraschino cherries with 1/4 cup of the maraschino cherry juice.  Let sit for a while to let the baking soda and buttermilk react.  Once baked pour powdered sugar icing over the top....found recipe on here as well:
http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/vanilla---chocolate-powdered-sugar-frosting/Detail.aspx

2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 tablespoons milk
2 tablespoons cocoa powder (optional)

This was the best Irish Soda Bread I've made! Traditional Irish soda bread does not have raisins, fruit or nuts in it! It was a simple soda bread either made with hearty grain flour or white flour on special occasions.. Trust me, this is amazing just as it is!

Thick and slightly sweet, this bread is similar in taste to corn bread.  I'd recommend with butter.

This is a good bread, but nothing spectacular.  What was really good was using it as toast and putting some homemade apple butter on it.  Now THAT was very yummy.

Made this with our corned beef and cabbage dinner yesterday and it was fantastic!  I did add 1/2 cup of raisins and as one reviewer suggested, let it stand in the loaf pan for 30 min. before putting it in the over.  Extremely moist.  Kids loved it.

Really great bread.  Having no buttermilk, I soured some skim milk with vinegar (1T vinegar to 1C milk).  Light, easy to slice, great texture.  Went great with dinner.

I give this a 4 out of 5 but I am not quite finished with the bread yet. I didn't have buttermilk around and haven't really used it in baking before so i through in a half tsp of vanilla with regular milk. I guess I should have looked up buttermilk substitute before I made it though bc I have lemon extract. I also increased the sugar some to make it sweeter. I'm also surprised to see that no one else had said this in the comments I read, but I added green food coloring to make this a real st. patty's day bread! I wonder how the bread is going to come out. I'll let you all know!

This was my first attempt at making soda bread and I ended up making 2 loaves and everyone at work loved it!!! I also added about a 1/2 cup of raisins to each mix and let them sit about 30 mins before baking.  Will definitely make this every year going forward!

This was excellent.  I did not refrigerate before baking, did not have it stand.  Right into the oven.  Great taste and so versatile.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup currants.  Yummmmoooo!  Will make again and try with optional minced dry cherries or 1/2 tsp. almond extract or chocolate chips or walnuts.  Very versatile recipe and absolutely scumptious.

Bland, tasteless,  served this to guests and most were disappointed.   I even received a few complaints.  Also the picture depicts a loaf with raisins or currants in it.  The recipe does not call for them.  I put them into the bread and the fruit was the most flavorful exciting this in it.  Also it is not even a traditional loaf, as others have even mentioned.  Will not make again, we were not impressed

I agree with the other posters that it needs raisins.  I also used oil for the fat.  If you eat this plain, it tastes like cornbread without the corn-y taste.

Big hit, it got cleaned out right away at our St. Patty's day gathering.  I did not change the recipe a bit.  It was easy and good!

I made this recipe for my Irish hubby who lives in the States now and has childhood stories of homemade Irish Soda Bread. He LOVED it and said it was just like he remembered at home. FANTASTIC the next morning toasted with butter *yum* only thing I would change would be to double the amount of raisins!

Lacee, age 17:  This bread is AWESOME! I tried making Irish Soda bread before from this site, but I think this recipe's the best. I baked it for 1:05, and about ten minutes before it was done I put shredded cheese on top.

Maybe I did something wrong.  This was just a dry biscuit-bread with raisins in it.  I will not make again.

YUM YUM YUM! I have never had soda bread before, so I can speak to authenticity, but this was great. Tasted so good! There seemed to be a lot of batter, so I baked it in a 9x9 dish instead of a loaf pan. I also added a handful of raisins to it. So delicious! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This was the best Irish Soda Bread I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except the cooking time was a bit off for my stove. But with that said, it was AWESOME!! I will be making this part of my yearly St. Patrick's Day dinners...thank you for a great recipe.

Interesting to try.  Cornbread consistency and strong soda taste weren't really to our liking so will not make this again.

Great right out of the oven, why wait a hour, a day for HOMEMADE bread?! My Husband and Mother loved it! I had to give the rest of the loaf away so I would not eat it all! We did not use raisins, and I prefer it that way as well. I had no issues with flavor, or recipe at all :D

Best recipe ever! even better if you brush the loaf with the butter mixture while it bakes, (from the amazingly easy Irish soda bread) 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup buttermilk. I brushed the loaf every 15 min, and baked it for 60 minutes at 325 in a conventional oven.

Good flavor but it is not like the Irish Soda Bread I am used to. I prefer it more like a scone and a rustic free form loaf.  And it usually has raisins in it.  This one kind of reminded me more of a beer bread. I bet it is good toasted.

Thought the dough itself was really moist and yummy.  Added raisins based on others suggestions and was really not impressed. If you're not a raisin fan....then don't add them.

Yum!!  This recipe is SO awesomely easy that it was wonderful to make with my 1 and 3 year olds for St Patrick's Day.  It smells so great in the oven that our house still smells wonderfu.  We weren't patient enough to wait for awhile with it wrapped up for the flavor to increase, but I'm excited to have some more tomorrow and try it that way.  :)  We did add a cup of raisins when we made it, but no other changes and it turned out great.

I've only had Irish Soda Bread once before, so I don't know if this tastes 'traditional' or not.  I can only offer my (& my husband's) opinion.  My first thought was that it had a biscuit-like taste.  He thought it tasted similar to cornbread-in fact after one bite he got up to put butter on it.  (And a glass of water to wash it down) It was nice and moist; I added raisins, and liked that a lot...but I don't think I'd make it again.  It just doesn't suit me.  Nothing is ~wrong~ with it though, I baked for 65 minutes and the loaf was just beautiful.  If you know you like Irish Soda Bread, I'd definitely give this recipe a try!

I have never made bread in my life, and though ugly and bumply, it is delicious. I made 2 loaves and I am cooling one on a rack and one in foil to note the differences. I am very pleased with myself and this recipe especially since the dough seemed sticky, clumpy and impossible.

Good flavor  and moist but too cakey for my taste. I was hoping for more of a biscuit texture. Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread is better. Sorry.

I first made this a few years back for St. Pat's day, and we loved it so much I now make it on a regular basis.  It has a slightly sweet taste to it and will make in instead of a sweet cornbread to go with chili or bbq for a change of pace.  Also great for breakfast!  I always follow the recipe to the T the first time around, and this is one that I still follow to the T.  No need to change a thing.

This was o.k. Definitely better the next day. I tasted it fresh out of the oven and it had a very eggie taste to it. The next day that flavor all but disappeared. However, this is made very similarly to beer bread and I would rather eat the beer bread.

OK, so this isn't the authentic Irish Soda recipe, but it is very delicious made with raisins, and the Irish lasses at work loved it as much as the rest of us. This is the one I will keep!

Good bread; easy to make but why hasn't this recipe been revised to include raisins as shown in picture and is typically in soda bread??  Caraway seeds are optional.

I was looking for an Irish Soda Bread recipe that would appeal to my wee ones (ages 6 and 4) and this is it!  It's not your traditional isb, but it is very good; moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  I also added 3/4 cup of raisins with yummy results.  Can't wait to have it toasted with butter for breakfast this morning.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect. I also added almost 1 full cup of currants and I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer that directed because I'm at a high altitude. We had this with coffee after dinner and we'll probably be having it for breakfast tomorrow too.

Really loved it.  Nice and moist and cakey.  If you don't like your soda bread this way you may not like it.  We served it warm with butter for dessert on St. Patrick's Day. Loved it!!  I used a cup of raisins and I also used an 8x8 glass pyrex dish (was afraid of what one reviewer said about it overflowing a bread pan).  I baked it half way between 300 and 325 for 40 minutes--it was perfect!

Gotta give this recipe props for the fact that it is still delicious even though I forgot to add the sugar!  I will definitely make it again... the right way!  Very good topped with jam while still warm.

Very good, only needed to bake about 50 mins. Better the next day if wrapped in foil or plastic wrap.

I had never ate an irish soda bread before so I had no idea what to expect.  This was excellent, very moist.  I made it for my family and everyone loved it.  We'll be making this one again very soon.  Next time I may use raisins as others have suggested.

The bread was very good and tastey, but it's not what I traditionally think of Irish Soda Bread tasting like.

This was very good but not exactly what I'm used to in a soda bread. It was lighter and moister while I'm used to a denser bread. I like how moist it is, though. It baked evenly and formed a nice crust. I added raisins and just a little bit extra sugar, which didn't make it too sweet. I enjoyed this one, but I wanted to note the difference from the type you can form into a loaf without a pan.

Am I the only one who had a problem with this recipe?  One TABLESPOON of baking powder made my bread spill over and made my house smell of burnt food.  I even measured the pan to make sure it was the correct size.

This is the greatest. I'm not Irish so I can't say how "authentic" it is or not. But either way it's a great bread and I always get asked for the recipe when I take it somewhere.

This was a very moist and tasty bread - a bit crumbly and less firm than typical Irish Soda Bread.  My family really liked it, but my husband suggested that it's more of a "dessert bread."  It probably would make a good base for strawberry shortcake.

I followed the recipe to a T except I added raisins and caraway seeds.  It rose in the pan without overflowing creating a delicious, crunchy top.  The only problem was that it was raw in the center causing me to discard the two center slices.  I would definitely make this again, however, I'd use a 8 x 8 pan.

This is a simple recipe, and very tasty. I believe the nutritional data may account for the addition of raisins or currents, even though they are not listed in the ingredients. I used cranberries in place of raisins and did the math for nutritional value, which came out to 185 calories (using 1/2 c measurement on the cranberries).

My son and I made this together for St. Patricks day and, except for addition of a cup of raisins, we followed the recipe exactly. This is different than any other Irish soda bread recipe I've tried before. I don't know how traditional it is, but I will say this is the first time  I've made soda bread and the whole loaf was eaten. Usually soda bread has such a hockey puck type of texture that it's only good the first day. This was good the next day too. It has a bread, almost cake-like texture. I was going to try making french toast with it, but it was eaten up too quickly!

this is a really delicious, moist bread - but not quite how I envision irish soda bread. still, definitely worth the bake! I think dried cranberries or another fruit sweeter than raisins does it best justice.

This was great!  Definitely not your typical irish soda bread.  It had the right flavor but a much moister texture.  It was delicious alone and spread with butter with dinner.  I used 2 mini packages of raisins and sprinkled them on the top before I baked it since I knew some people do not like raisins in their bread.  It was a hit.  Oh, and I doubled the sugar :)

I have made soda bread but none tastes like this. I added a cup of raisens also. I like other reviewers suggestions about using the caraway seeds and currants also. It is very much a cake like bread; almost like Challah in flavor and texture. Since Easter is coming I may just make it again next weekend. I live alone and bring baked goods into work and everyone loves this bread; no one has complained yet. Corned Beef and Irish Soda Bread are not made in Ireland from what I understand. The Irish Soda Breads I am used to eating are biscuit hard and dried out. I never cared much for them. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was part of my St. Patrick's Day themed meal last night. I'd never had Irish Soda Bread before, so I didn't know what to expect. It was good, but it's just bread. I didn't think it was sweet like people said in other reviews. Adding the raisins would give it a unique taste.

My family and I really liked this. Half the bread was eaten before it cooled completely. Nice moist bread, not overly sweet, with a pleasant texture. I made a double recipe and added 1 cup of raisins to one loaf; mixed in with the dry ingredients prior to adding the buttermilk. The raisins added a touch more sweetness and we all agreed we like the loaf with the raisins best. I wouldn’t really call this Irish Soda Bread. It’s not at all like the typical hard, hockey puck type Irish Soda Bread I’ve had in the past. I will definitely make this again, with the addition of the raisins.

This bread definitely has more of a cake-like consistency, which is deceiving when you taste it since it's not sweet. I wasn't sure what to expect considering the whole time I was in Ireland we were never served bread like this. Overall it's okay and might be something I'd make for my husband and me at home, but I wouldn't serve it to others, as you'd probably have to be familiar with this bread to enjoy it.

I have a wee bit of the Irish in me, so I enjoy serving this on St. Patty's Day for a family tradition. I love it with currents (or raisins), but some people I've served it to prefer it plain. Personally, I think the sugar amount is just right. Yet, everyone has varying sweet tooth levels.

Super easy!  Other then using margarine, I didn't change a thing.  I used a 9x5 inch loaf pan and covered it with foil after 45 minutes because it was getting brown.  I baked for a total of 65 minutes and it smells wonderful!

Every year I cook a special St. Patrick's Day meal for my family.  This will definitely be a keeper for years to come.  It was very easy to prepare and my boys loved it.  They asked if they had to wait until next year for me to make it again!

I made it without the raisins.  This was more like cake and less like bread.  It was very tasty though, and moist, and easy.

I followed the recipe exactly, also adding a large handful of raisins.  It turned out perfectly.  Spread with cream cheese, it is even better.

I really loved this Soda Bread!  I baked it in a slightly smaller loaf pan and just baked it for about five minutes longer.  I also added some raisins.  It tasted great right out of the oven, but it tasted even better the next day!

Honestly, I had no idea what soda bread was.  I tried this recipe and found it quite good.  I followed the recipe but omitted raisins since I was making it for other people... and we know how few raisin lovers there are.  ha!

This bread was moist and very tasty.  I don't like raisins so was glad to find a Soda Bread recipe without them.  It is even better the next day toasted with butter.  My husband raved about it.  Will make this again and again.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day.  The whole family loved it - toasted with butter or jam.  I enjoyed it with peanut butter, but I like that on everything!  I added raisins as well.  Thank you!

I was disappointed in the texture of this bread.  It was more cake-like than I would expect soda bread to be.   Amazingly Easy Soda Bread is better.

I have never had Irish Soda Bread. I was a little uneasy, but eager to try. The recipe was easy and the taste was great. It almost taste like a cornbread, but its not. My brother ate half the loaf. Diffently a keeper. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this - I, too left out the raisins.  Very easy and delicious, comes out perfect if you make sure it sits a while.  We'll make this year round, and especially next time company's over.

This made a DELICIOUS bread! I followed the recipe exactly, and even let it sit overnight. It made a great toast to go with eggs over easy the next morning, and my 2 year old daughter kept grabbing pieces to eat with peanut butter. Will definitely make again!

Yes, this is great bread. Much softer and lighter than other soda bread I've had. I did add raisins; other than that followed exact recipe. One thing, this is really not a sweet soda bread.

I had never heard of Irish soda bread... It's very easy to make and both my wife and I give it five stars. I'm glad I tried this on St. Patricks day and now I'll make this any time of the year!

I added 1 cup raisins and it was fantastic, very moist.  It could even be eaten as a dessert.

This bread is so easy to make and so good.  It's very moist and flavorful. Definately store overnight, it's worth the wait.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I'm very pleased with the results. This bread is clearly a great accompaniment to meals, but I also adore it as a snacking bread.

not sure what all the fuss is about...this is just regular old bread as far as I could tell.  It was very easy to make and just as good as yeast white bread (but no where near the trouble).  I did add a few raisins

I think I may have undercooked this, because it was kind of soggy in the middle.  I am a seasoned breadmaker, but this just did not come out quite right.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I made a few small changes to make it healthier, but overall this s a keeper. I don't have buttermilk, so I subsituted 2 cups skim milk and 2 tablespoons vinegar instead. I also used 2 tbsps of roasted garlic olive oil instead of the butter...MMMMMM was it GOOD! Next time I'll add raisins too. Sprinkle some poppy seeds in for a pretty treat.

I give two stars because first, it was incredibly easy to make, but honestly one of my daughters loved it with apricot jam, the other 4 of us found it be be plain, boring and nothing special.  Unfortunately, not a keeper for us.

Incredible, tasty moist and dense bread.  I don't recall ever having soda bread this tasty when I lived in Ireland, but who's complaining?  Tastes a bit like a moist tender American biscuit from the South, in loaf form.

Fabulous!!  I am on an anti-yeast diet, and this is a great no-yeast bread solution (especially if you have high quality flour).  Because of my diet, I used Splenda instead of sugar.  This bread is *so,* *so,* good.  Soft, great texture, slightly sweet.  Just yummy.  I'll be making this regularly.

This is an excellent soda bread recipe.  I can't understand anyone challenging its authenticity... And it's easy because, after all, it's supposed to be!  Last time I checked Irish recipes weren't the most complicated!  As per my taste, I added about a cup of currants (better than raisins for a little "tarteness"), a tad (really not more than a tablespoon or so) more sugar and the slightest dash more salt, just because the thing I love most about soda bread is its sweet contrast with nice, salty butter.  Definitely holds up better the next day.  A million thanks for this recipe.

An excellent recipie for St. Patrick's Day or any day. I made this with 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups regular flour and it came out really good. I also substiuted the sugar for splenda. Everyone here at work is really enjoying it.

This was good, but it did not taste like traditional Irish soda bread.  I believe due to famine in Ireland, that butter and eggs were not even available, hence the traditional Irish Soda bread tasted more like a scone.
This bread was good though, very moist, like a moist raisin cake . (i added raisins)

Made one loaf yesterday, tasted it today, and I just had to make two more loaves to hand out for St Patrick's Day.
I added one cup of golden raisins to the recipe.
This is definitely moist. The best I have ever had.

MMM! good. I really like it.  I'm not sure how soda bread is supposed to be. I suspect that mine might not have turned out quite right. It's very thick and SUPER moist, almost like it didn't get done, but the top was brown and the tooth pick came out clean, so maybe it was. The only change I made was to add a bit more sugar.  Really good, try it!

This bread is Really good! At first we used powdered buttermilk and we didn't use whole wheat flour.  It was Iky! But, we decided to try it with REAL butter milk and The flour and it was AWSOME!  This is also good with raisins! serve with Irish Salted butter!

I have been looking for a recipe like the Irish Soda Bread served at my favorite Irish pub and this one is really close. I found it was too much batter for one pan and it got a little too brown and crispy on the outside(my oven is tempermental). I will make again in 2 smaller loaves and watch a little closer. Thanks for the Recipe

A good tasting, easy recipe just as the blurb says. BUT is it soda bread? My inclination is no. It's much more cake like in texture not soda bread like at all! Never the less, it is a good recipe. I would just rather call it "buttermilk loaf cake" instead of "Irish soda bread."

I enjoyed this bread very much.  The only things I did different from the recipe was to use 1/4 cup of egg substitute instead of an egg, 3 tbsp of margerine and 1 tbsp of light margerine instead of the 4 tbsp of butter.  Also added a handful of raisins.  I had two cups of buttermilk to use up and this was a great way to do it.

Ok, so I made this recipe with burnt butter (i messed up, and didn't want to waste butter) and confectioner's sugar (was out of regular) and it was STILL great! I did use 2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of white. This was not like the "traditional" Irish Soda bread I have gotten used to, but it was still pretty good. And baking it in the loaf pan made it great for toasting with butter, and even for PB&J sandwiches!

This was a surprising treat.  From the very few ingredients, I didn't think it would have much flavor. I was wrong!  It WAS irresistible and I loved eating it with tea.

fantastic recipe. an irish friend told me it is more authentic if you cut a big X in the top of the dough before baking it. it lets the top become more crusty and the X on soda bread is an irish tradition.

Terrific recipe!  I have made many types of bread, but never Irish Soda Bread.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  My loaf turned out nice and high with a nice crispy (not tough) crust, and a slightly sweet flavor.  I didn’t have any buttermilk so I added about 1 tsp of white vinegar to 2 cups of whole milk in substitution.  Next time I make it, I’m going to double the sugar and add about ½ cup of cocoa powder to make a chocolate desert loaf.  Thank you very much for the recipe Karin!

This was fabulous! I made it for St. Patrick's Day and it was a big hit with our guests! The only reason I gave it four stars was that it really wasn't an "Irish" soda bread. But it was delicious, and I'll definitely be making it again!

I am only giving this two stars because it was so easy to make and seemed very "authentic".  The taste however was awful.  My husband said it was really good but its been two days and we still have over half a loaf... obviously he was just being nice.

Pretty tasty although not totally impressive.  I was all excited about this original bread but nobody else really seemed to care.  In fact, one young guest to our St. Patty's Day Dinner commented on the bread, "That's not yummy".  Nobody agreed with her but it wasn't all that.

Wonderful taste and easy, too.  My 21 month old daughter loves this.  I had slight overflow using a 9x5 pan, so I will use a second small loaf pan next time.  Certainly worth making.

Excellent bread, wonderful taste...I even cheated and used 2 cups of 1% milk with about 2 tablespoons of white vinegar.  I never made or  had soda bread before, but it was so good and easy to put together that I'll probably make it often.  Lots of compliments from the Irish folks having beef & cabbage at the in-laws.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for my office potluck on St. Patricks Day and instead of putting the bread in a loaf pan I kneaded the bread first (I also added a little bit more flour) and shaped the batter in a round loaf and cut a couple of slices in it.  Everyone loved it and are demanding the recipe!

I made this last night for the third St. Patrick's Day in a row.  I am currently on WW, but couldn't go without soda bread, so I made a few changes to make this more Points-friendly.

I used splenda for all the sugar.  Only used half of the butter and used applesauce for the other half.  I rarely have buttermilk, so I used vinegar and skim milk.  Instead of greasing the loaf pan, I used parchment paper and a little PAM.  I cut the parchment to cover the bottom and two of the sides and left the flaps hanging up the top -- they helped with removal.  Then I sprayed the remaining two sides to guarantee it wouldn't stick.

I made this for my St Patrick's Day dinner party and it was a big hit.  I had to make 2 loaves. I made one in a regular loaf pan and one in my Pampered Chef Stoneware loaf pan and have to tell you that they were both very good, but stoneware is the way to go. Will definetly make this again!

Great recipe! After reading all the reviews (whew!) I decided to try a couple changes. I plopped 1/4 c scoops of this nice, thick batter onto baking stones and so the bread bacame little round 'soda buns'. I also used the butter/buttermilk mixture from 'Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread' and brushed the tops of my 'soda buns' twice when they were near the end of their 20 minute baking time! They were delicious and will be the base for our 'Make your own Irish Sandwiches' at a college ministry group tomorrow night!

Wonderful bread, with a wonderful consistency (I haven't had any soda bread before, so I cannot compare to another similar bread). The only complain I can make about this treat is that it didn't rise as high as I expected it to.

Absolutely to die for!  Made mine a little more moist like one review suggested and it was devoured at my St. Patrick's Day feast.

I thought this recipe was easy to follow and it didn't taste bad, it just wasn't what I was looking for. It's more of a cake than a bread. It is sweet and tastes alright, just not for me.

I've never had Irish Soda Bread before, let alone baked it, so I don't know whether this bread is traditional or not. I do know that it is fabulous. I followed the directions exactly, baked it for 70 minutes, then wrapped it in foil overnight. It turned out moist, dense, and delicious. It was like eating pound cake! I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent soda bread.  Reminded me of a traditional shortcake, so I think this would be a great recipe for topping with strawberries or peaches and whipped cream.  Easy and tasty!

I had never tried Irish soda bread and this recipe looked good, so I gave it a try. Wow! It was incredibly easy and very delicious. My 10-year old daughter took a bite and declared it "awesome". It was good with butter, my daughter dipped hers in honey. We'll definitely make this again.

I really liked this recipe, and it was a big hit with my husband too.  Very easy to make, and delicious.  I made some modifications to make it dairy- and egg-free (vegan):  Use Ener-G Egg Replacer instead of the egg, 2 c. rice milk (or soy milk would probably work too) + 1 T. white vinegar instead of buttermilk, and margarine instead of butter.  It still turned out very tasty.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup because some other reviewers had commented on the sweetness. It was very good with less sugar.  I think any more than this would have been too sweet, and next time I might even put in a little less.

Wow what a great bread!  I had tried baking a few breads before this one, but had always been disappointed.  This one came out great the first time.  I'll definately be making this one again and again.  Thanks, Karin, for sharing this treasure with us!

Very delicate and sweet bread. It belongs in the catagory alongside Banana bread. Ate the whole thing in one sitting. For a liitle less sweet;try taking the sugar down to 1/4 c. for sopping up stews and soup. Orgasmic!!!!!!!

Very nice, since it is a little sweeter than I had expected you might as well add more sugar and soak in some rum or add artificial rum flavoring.

Excellent moist bread.  I added some caraway seeds which gave it a wonderful flavor.

Being of Irish descent, I have had many types of soda bread in the past and this was by FAR the best!  No caraway seeds to fool with, and the flavor is ideal for warming and buttering for a yummy breakfast.

Even with my Irish heritage I have never
tried Irish Soda Bread. I loved this 
recipe. It went well with Corned Beef and
Cabbage and was quick and easy to make.
It reminded me a little of cornbread but
not exactly. I will make this bread often
with a main course or soup. Great recipe!!!

Added fresh chopped jalapeño and shredded cheddar, and accidentally used 1/2 a cup butter, but it turned out fantastic. Served it on the side of a cheeseburger chowder, everyone raved about it!

A sweet, delicious bread. Butter was a must, and warm it up in microwave if the bread has cooled. Would easily accept cinnamon or other sweet ingredients. Definitely is not authentic Irish soda bread though. The biggest difference I notice is the crust is too soft. Very easy!

*11/17/19:  I've made this three times now.  The first two times I plopped the dough onto a cookie sheet, and this third time I put it into a loaf pan as directed.  It's been great every time.

I absolutely love this soda bread! It is easy enough to allow my small kids to help make it. I use shortening to grease to pan and the bread slides out so nicely. The bread is done around 58 minutes and gets a bit too crunchy on the outside for my liking at 65 minutes. I have made this several times and it always turns out great.

Tried yes, but true, no! This is unlike any soda bread I’ve ever had, it’s not soda bread at all, you could possibly call it Irish Soda Cake. It’s quite a nice cake though, for a plain one. I buttered it and put strawberry conserve on it. I can’t use any of it for what I’d hoped to, which was to fry or toast it and have it with egg, bacon and tomatoes, it’s far too sweet for that

Simple and tasty as-is. I split into two loaf pans and baked for about 45-50 minutes, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Great for stews or chili, or with butter and jam.

I wasn't impressed with this.  However my company loved it.  I don't know if I have ever had soda bread before, so it could just be that I don't care for soda bread.  It was easy and I was impressed with the appearance.  My first baked from scratch anything.

Excellent recipe! I made a few batches, and when I gave a loaf to a friend of mine that had never had soda bread, he asked me what to do with it. I told him to put some butter on it and eat it.(LOL) He did just that, for a snack at night, his picky kids caught him, and they ended up eating the whole loaf on a Saturday night. They asked for more, and so did everyone I gave a loaf to. I suggest using the buttermilk already made, instead of adding vinegar or lemon juice to milk, it really makes a difference in the flavor.

I like this savory so I add 1/2 chopped saute onion and 1/2 tsp garlic plus cup of Gouda cheese.  Today I add chopped ham I had left over. Nice light fluffy tasty bread, great for work.

I didn’t have any buttermilk, so I just added vinegar to my milk.
This recipe was nice to work with, quick and easy.
I will definitely make it again.

So easy and ingredients you probably have on hand. Moist and delicious. I  made it in my stoneware loaf pan. I brought it over my parent's house on St. Patty's Day as my Dad made corn beef and everyone loved it. I just made buttermilk by adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar per one cup of milk. This is definitely a favorite.

This soda bread was the hit of the St. Pat’s potluck even though I made it with a dairy free milk. I used oat milk plus the juice of half a lemon in place of buttermilk. I also substituted non-soy earth balance margarine instead of butter. My 2nd effort,  using gluten-free flour, failed but still tasted pretty good.

This loaf was easy to make and baked up well. I followed the recipe but put less sugar and added plumped raisins.we found it extremely dry,even after wrapping in foil , thought the raisins might moisten it ,to no avail. Would never make this again !

Great for automatic breadmaker! Add wet ingredients to pan first, then dry. Choose "Batter Breads" setting. Before final kneading, scrape flour from sides of pan & add 3/4 to 1 cup of raisons. Remove paddle before baking begins.

I’ve been making soda bread for 30 years and this is the best texture yet. I added about a cup of currants just after icing in the butter; let the batter rest for about 25 minutes before baking. It rose beautifully. My Irish mom would’ve loved it.

I always make my moms Irish Bread recipe but decided to try a new one because this one seemed similar. I was not impressed I’m sorry to say.  It was moist but tasted like it was missing something. My moms is better!  Sorry mom. I’ll never stray again.

Great bread. Decided to try this recipe for my sons as they don’t like raisins.  They enjoyed it very much. I followed the recipe, but made my own buttermilk. I would like to try again with real buttermilk.

I will definitely make this again. My wife loves Soda Bread and we can never find it in the stores except for around St. Patrick's day. 
4.5 stars from me, but I don't have the option for a half star.

I have made this many times and love it! Although not the traditional drier soda bread with raisins, I like this much better. Add raisins if you like, but I prefer it without. This is great with honey or jam, and can be used for sandwiches as a nice substitute for yeast bread for those of us with a yeast allergy. Enjoy!

I was looking for a sweeter version of soda bread to use for dessert (my family and friends love soda bread with ice cream and strawberries) and this worked perfectly.  Came together quickly and produced a light, almost cake-like sweet bread.  Great toasted with butter and jam for a morning treat too!

I followed the recipe completely and I will make it again, I smoked Brisket before making Corned beef and cabbage and also made pastrami I used the Smoker to cook the bread and it turned out awesome, Our company said it was the best Soda Bread they have ever had. I did use a bread Pan but took this photo to show my friends
.Smoking the brisket  for about an hour before making the Corned Beef and cabbage gave it fantastic flavor

Gluten-free Version - I tried to make this recipe gluten-free for my son-in-law.  I used four cups of brown rice flour instead of the regular flour, added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 8 tbsp dried buttermilk powder.  The rest of the ingredients were the same.  This made two shallow loaves in regular bread pans.  I baked them for about 45 minutes and they came out well.   The next time I will probably use this recipe to make one regular size loaf and one half-size loaf.

Excellent! I always use 1/2 wheat flour which worked great. I didn’t have enough buttermilk so I used 1 1/4 c buttermilk and 1 c Greek yogurt and it turned out beautifully. The texture is very close to yeast bread but with the time commitment of a quick bread, will definitely be making regularly!

Very good recipe as written. Don’t expect this to be a traditional soda bread as it’s sweeter & more moist. This works well for a breakfast bread when lightly buttered & toasted.

An easy way to make a delicious Irish soda bread!  I made a loaf to take to work for a group of us working overtime on St. Patrick’s Day 2018 and served it with Kerrygold Irish butter.  Everyone loved it!  I liked that it was made in a loaf pan and prep time was so short.  Will definitely make again!

I added raisins and really liked them.  Made it exactly as written, let it sit about 15 minutes before baking  and did find it better the next day, even though we had some as soon as it cooled enough to cut.  Couldn’t wait to try it, the first time I ever made bread with buttermilk.

It is good. We liked it but we do have others we like better. I used powdered butter milk which I added with the flour, then added water . It worked well. I do recommend it.

This was my first time making soda bread but sounded like it was perfect to have with our Saint Paddy's Day feast so I thought I'd try it.  I followed the recipe as written and while this bread is good it's a little bit to sweet for my taste.  It has the texture of cake which was a surprise to me but since I've never made Irish Soda Bread I thought that must be how it's suppose to be textured.  I Love how fast and easy it is to make and I will try it again but next time I will be decreasing the sugar in it if meant to be used as bread.  If making as a dessert bread then I will of course use the amount listed in the recipe plus add raisins and maybe even nuts and cinnamon and make a light glaze to drizzle over the cooled loaf.

I changed a few things, instead of buttermilk I used 1.75 cups milk and .25 cups apple cider vinegar. Increased the sugar to .5 cups. Added drained soaked raisins to the batter last and it was just amazing. Soak raisins over 1 hour I only had a cup on hand. Turned out perfect. My mom likes to add a glaze on top. It doesn’t need it though. Sooo good and kid approved

That IS NOT how to make soda bread. I am Irish and I should know. Half a cup of sugar? White flour? Butter? All rubbish. The recipe calls for stoneground flour, bicarb of soda, a little salt to taste, buttermilk, that's it. Is this an American recipe? I had to give it a star to post my review, but in reality I give it no stars

I used this as a base recipe.  Great on on it's own, I'm sure because it's a great bread recipe. I added 1 cup shredded colbyjack cheese and 1/4 cup chives, reduced sugar to 2 Tblsp and it is wonderful. Thanks for such a great "base" recipe for me.

Love this recipe. Ever since I first made it I get requests all the time. I always use Bulgarian buttermilk so I think it gives it a slightly different flavor than regular buttermilk. I also don’t like raisins so this recipe is perfect for me. It turns out amazing every time.

I never leave reviews but this was gross.  It was dry, and so bland.  My daughter doesn't like raisins so I usually make one with and one without. This was gross both ways.  I followed it exactly as written.

I made it with whole grain flour but it turned out wonderfully. Cooked for 10 mins at about 375 and then 50 mins for 325. I did not add raisins but definitely will next time! Fresh butter on this warm bread is completely delicious. Fiancé was won over after one bite.

This was my first time for making this bread & it was yummy.
It is a nice variation from a yeast bread . I used bread flour as all purpose flour seemed to close to cake for me. This seemed to give it stability & although I had to switch it in the middle  of the bake to a conventional oven from a convection  it still remained stable & beautiful to look at.almost hated to eat it & yes I will try it again but next time with raisins.

Made just as shown.  It is quite good. difficult to cut cleanly when fresh. I agree it is better to wrap it up and leave it awhile before cutting,  The crust will be soft and cake-like.  It is not like a sturdy crunchy yeast loaf but it is good.

I found this soda bread to be a bit bland. I usually make soda bread in two round loaves. My recipe uses 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/8 to 1/4 tsp cardamom and 3/4 cup raised.

I didn't make any changes other than making a double batch and making 6 small loaves.  I wrapped them in foil, just like it said and left them on the counter to mellow for overnight.  The next morning I walked into the kitchen with yummy soda bread for breakfast on my mind, but all I found was pieces of tin foil and Irish Soda Bread Crumbs all over my kitchen floor.  I slowly turned with squinted eyes to find my Labradoodle, Marley, with this hangdog guilty look on his face.  He apparently loved it.    On my second try I put it out of the reach of hungry jaws and it turned out moist, just a bit sweet and oh so delicious.

Really tasty easy quick bread.  I used 1 cup white flour and 2 cups wheat.  Lovely texture. I will make this again.

This is the best soda bread that I've ever made.  It was moist and flavorful.  I made it early in the afternoon so that it was cool by dinner, as the recipe stated. I will definitely make this again.  I also like that it was in a loaf pan.

I have never had Irish soda bread before but decided to make it and serve with chili.  It was like a dense loaf and wonderfully sweet.  Will definitely make again.

This  recipe didn't work for me at all. The bread came out oily, soggy, and looked more like cake. I've made Irish soda bread before and this is the only recipe I've seen that instructs for melted butter mixed in with the dough. Maybe if the recipe called for softened butter or margarine, it could work.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party where guests were asked to make something Irish.  I am still getting rave reviews from the party guests who said it was the best they've ever had.  It was super easy to make.

Excellent. I didn't have enough butter so I used canola oil - I'm not sure there is any difference - bread was still lovely. Looked exactly like the picture.

I was pleasantly surprised with this bread.  "Soda" bread has always brought to mind a dry bread and this was anything but.  Moist and extremely dense with a semi sweet taste.  Will definitely make again.

I made this and we absolutely loved it! After reading over some of the other reviews, I upped the sugar by about 1/4 cup to give it a bit sweeter flavor. I also left mine out to rise for about 30 minutes before baking it. It turned out so beautifully! It was light and tasty. My husband raved over this bread, and that is certainly high praise.

This recipe was great.  I had never tasted sod bread and
was glad I chose this recipe to try.  I did not substitute 
anything, just followed instructions.  Bread is so good
with butter!

Made this bread yesterday. The best I've come across. The only thing I did different from the recipe was after pouring into the pan, I let it rest 30 minutes before baking as suggested by APAETH.

Easy to make and love the "pour" method. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2 cups of milk with 2 T. vinegar added.  Next time, I'll back off on the sugar a bit. Was a little too sweet. Great recipe, quick and tasty. Thanks for sharing.

This was great! I undercooked it, my own fault, so put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes, totaling 65 minutes and it honestly could have taken another 5.  I took the advice of others and let the batter sit for 30 minutes to gain full activation of the baking power.  I think, had I baked it long enough, it would have been lighter. The taste was fantastic, even though I used regular milk with 2 TBSP of cider vinegar in place of buttermilk.

I was SO DISAPPOINTED!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and cooked it EXACTLY as written in a 9x5 glass loaf pan.  The bottom 1/4 was soggy when I took it out after 1 hour 5 minutes.  The cake tester came out clean.  I cut off about 2 inches and put it back in the oven for another 20 min.  IF I try it again I'll put on a baking sheet as noted in other soda bread recipes.

It was not a bad recipe, and it is a soda bread. But, it is not  like your traditional Irish soda bread; it is more cake-like in batter, and it came out moist.  It was tasty.

The recipe was easily prepared. I lined a 9*5 loaf pan with wax paper for easy removal. Baked at 58 min. Used reconstituted buttermilk from powder and Kerrygold butter. Made a lightly flavored quick bread type of soda bread. I plan to make the regular kneaded type bread for the authentic  crust & flavor for St Paddy's Day.

Came out very sweet.
As I was making it, I thought 1/3 cup of sugar seemed a bit excessive, but added it any way. It's very good, but less Irish Soda Bread, and more dry, under-sweet pound cake.
If I were to make it again, I'd try reducing sugar by at least half.

Very good, and super easy to make. I did as one person suggested and allowed this to rest for 30 minutes prior to baking.

Easy and fast to make. Way too sweet. This is more like a breakfast bread. Probably taste better to add fruits and nuts. And cut down on the sugar.

I made this late last night. I have never made or tasted Irish Soda Bread before. I followed this recipe to the "T" and was very pleased with the flavor and texture of this bread. This recipe was very simple to follow and I had all ingredients on hand. I am glad to have chosen this recipe, and will be making it again. I encourage everyone to try this recipe, and thank you for sharing it with everyone here on allrecipes.

Love this bread! I've made it many times for family and friends. It's perfect as is, but is also excellent with added chopped and seeded jalapenos plus cheddar cheese in the batter before baking.

This is our favorite soda bread recipe now. I let the batter rest for 30 min. prior to baking. This makes it lighter. Everyone who eats this loves it, especially my 7 yr old very fussy eater grandson.

This is a really easy recipe and it turns out great every time. I live in Florida and sometimes the humidity can really change the texture of breads and cookies. This one is awesome. I made it to go with my corned beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's day. My mother in law was so impressed she asked for the recipe!!

Great receipe!  While deciding on this receipe I saw some others that used raisins in their soda bread ingredients.  I added a 1/2 cup of organic raisins to this bread.  My family loved this bread.

I used left over bread at breakfast.  Toasted and Buttered!

I will definitely make this again. Quick, fairly fool proof and easy to make with incredible and unexpectedly moist taste.  I made no changes to the recipe but would consider an oversized bread pan the next time as it came over the top and spilled on to the oven floor. I recommend sliding a tray under the pan as it kept rising for over 1/2 hr while baking.

Yes, liked it very much and it's easy peasy too. To make it little more rustic I added a half a cup of whole wheat flour. Looking some other recipes for soda bread, I'm not sure why it calls for baking soda as well as baking powder. Oh well, the whole fam enjoyed!

I'm sooooo lazy in the kitchen. This recipe was made for me (and people like me.) It was easy and the bread came out perfect - fluffy, light, crumbly with the most amazing golden yellow crust.
I don't like sweet breads, so I used just 1 tablespoon of sugar, and it was still amazing.

I have made soda bread before and been disappointed.  This one was excellent.  I usually always try to make a recipe exactly as written before I decide if I will tweak it but I had to make an exception here as I misjudged the amount of buttermilk I had on hand.  I only had about 3/4 cup so I filled the rest of the measuring cup up with milk and added about a tablespoon or so of lemon juice.  It did not detract from anything.  I will make this again but will be sure I have enough buttermilk next time!  This one is a keeper!

Not really a fan. A bit too fluffy and spongy.  I did use raisins and it did give it a bit more flavor.  I think I would have not liked it at all if I had omitted the raisins.

Never having eaten Irish Soda Bread, I didn't really know what to expect. Thought it might be a little drier, or "breadier." It reminded me of corn bread - next time I might add a little fresh corn. I give it a 4 for flavor. And it is SUPER easy!
However, it didn't rise much at all - there was a thin gooey layer on the bottom. Checked everything - then looked at the expiration date on my baking powder - 6/14. Today is 3/20/16. Think that might have been the problem - joke, joke?
When I make it again - properly- I'll consider rating it again!

The cooking time is way off. A toothpick came out dry and I baked on convection oven setting the appropriate amount of time. Came out doughy, heavy and flat.  We were able to eat some of it by slicing it very thinly and then broiling each slice separately on each side.

Yum! A little more involved than I am used to for a soda bread recipe (not that it's difficult) but great flavour and texture. This took an hour to bake in my oven and I did let the batter sit in the pan for about 30 minutes before baking to allow the baking soda and powder to activate, as someone else suggested.

Really easy, great sweet bread. Too sweet to be a true Irish soda bread, but with raisins added, a delicious treat. Let sit for 30 min prior to baking, did rise pretty high out of the loaf pan.

Looks nothing like the loafy, craggy soda bread I'm used to seeing. It creates a batter--not a dough--and the cooked result is more of a cake :( 

The taste is mildly sweet and it has a nice crumb, much like cornbread without the corn, so it's actually very pleasant to eat.

I am not a big fan of Irish Soda Bread, and while this one may not be traditional or authentic, it is very yummy. It is by far the best soda bread I have had - and very simple to make.  I will be making this again!

I added 1 cup of raisins that had soaked in warm water for 30 minutes. Also, I made this with self rising flour. Most quick breads are improved by the extra lift from s.r. flour. Made mine in a 9 inch round cake pan because I love the boule shaped bread along side the platter of St. Pat's day foods. Nice flavor and easy to make.

I made this for St Patrick's Day for my family. They had never had soda bread before, and loved it. I added currents to the recipe, but otherwise didn't change anything. I'll be making this again!

Should be called amazingly easy AND delicious. I've made this as written exactly and it's wonderful. Goes nicely with corned beef and cabbage or with stews or lightly toasted with some butter. If you find yourself without buttermilk (like I frequently do) on hand, just use milk with a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice and let sit for 5+ minutes... does the trick nicely and still tastes amazing.

Made exactly according to recipe and turned out wonderful. The only thing I did differently was we ate it as soon as it came out of the oven and it was delicious!! Thanks so much for the recipe, and it was so easy too!

My favorite recipe for soda bread.. The sugar helps with the taste. Texture is not to heavy. Outer crust has a crunch. Perfect with corn beef.

I make this bread all the time to go with soups and stews. It is so easy and fast, and so crusty on the outside, tender  on the inside for a non-yeast bread.

I decided to make this version of Irish Soda Bread today.   I am so glad I did.  It was very easy to make.  I did add a cup of raisins and let the batter sit in the pan about 30 minutes before baking as suggested.  I prefer this version over the traditional Irish Soda Bread because it isn't as dry and crumbly.

This is the best homemade bread I've ever made! The only change I made was to substitute baking powder for the baking soda. With no yeast involved, It's quick, and the taste is amazing! I've made it as a regular loaf, and also as cinnamon bread by adding cinnamon and extra sugar.  I think it would make a great cheesy garlic bread with some tweaking, and I plan to try it this way soon.

I've made this bread at least eight times. I always allow the bread to cool a bit in the pan and then set it on a wire rack to cool. Next I wrap the loaf in a 100% cotton towel and leave it on the counter. After it's cut I re-wrap the loaf and place the cut side down.  This works wonderful to keep the bread from drying out for at least 3-4 days, keeping in mind I haven't made this in the humid summertime yet. That may make a difference in storage. And I haven't tried freezing it yet. A loaf never makes it past 3-4 days, lol.

This is now my go-to bread recipe! My husband and I LOVE it!

I made this bread last night then wrapped it up in foil to set as instructed in the video. It has a lovely flavor and texture. I have issues with yeast so I cannot have regular breads. This is now my bread recipe. Thank you for sharing the recipe and the video showing how easy it is to make.

Perfect! I didn't change a thing, with the exception of brushing the top with butter midway through baking and again at the end. I made dinner to take to a friend who had surgery and I needed a bread to go with my homemade jam. This looked and smelled so good that I made a loaf for us too. Quick, easy and delicious! And it looks impressive too. Thank you for a great recipe!

I love this recipe. The only thing I've done different is double the sugar to 2/3 cup and the butter to 1/2 cup.  A few chefs have said it's the best ISB they've tasted. The kids gobble it up!

Good, but didn't taste much like soda bread....seemed to us that the flavor was somewhere between beer bread and a light, sweet cornbread.

Delicious! I had 2% milk that was starting to go bad (just smelled and tasted a bit off). I didn't want to throw it away, so I made my own buttermilk. I added 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to 2 cups of milk and waited 10 minutes.  I prepared the recipe with 1/2 cup of sugar instead, since I like it really sweet. I let it sit in the loaf pan for 15 minutes before putting it in the oven. 

It came out delicious, so soft and moist. Doesn't taste like soda bread though, more like a sweet cake. I prepared it in the past using buttermilk and I have to say, it's much better this way, with my homemade buttermilk!

Wow! This was fantastic. All I did was decrease the sugar EVER so slightly so it had just a hint of sweetness. Read a tip that proved quite good. After putting the batter into the pan, let it sit for 30 min. before placing in the oven to allow the chemical reactions to occur. Wrap in foil as directed. Moist, flavorful and amazing!

This was incredibly delicious! It smelled wonderful while it was cooking and tasted so good. I used kefir instead of buttermilk and accidently added a little too much butter. I also used wheat flour instead of white flour. It was very crumbly, but very moist. We unanimously voted to replace this recipe with our other Irish bread recipe that we have been using for years.

I made the recipe exactly as described and it is delish! Never made soda bread before but this was super easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and add raisins but overall- super easy and yummy!

This was just not what I was looking for. It comes out VERY cakey, almost a cornbread texture, not really bready at all. It was very easy to make though. Thank you anyway for the recipe.

I had my 8 yr old grand daughter make it for St. Patricks dinner,  she had no problem, we watched the video and then followed the recipe.  Was very easy, and my sons family ate the whole loaf everyone loved it,  
This is one the the best Irish Soda bread recipes I've found.

A moist, different twist on soda bread. I think the key is making the bread a day ahead as the submitter suggests. We liked this one as it didn't contain raisins.  It paired nicely with 'Braised Corned Beef Brisket' 'Cream Cheese Colcannon' and 'Buttermilk Coleslaw' all AR recipes.

Not sure if you should not call this Volcano Bread instead of Irish Soda Bread.  It really overflowed my bread pan.  So I highly suggest a cookie sheet below the pan.  Other than that, it tastes quite good and it appears that the recipe can be easily modified.

Have made yeast bread & buns for many years, but never anything as easy as this! Very soft & light.Paired it up with Chef John's beef stew yesterday for dinner. Went great together. Will certainly make this bread again.

Best soda bread I've ever had.  Someone mentioned another recipe called "amazing soda bread" which I had made and didn't like at all. This one was much better IMO but everyone has different tastes. Edit: I've made this a few times with much success. This last time I added some raisins and, although I don't normally like raisins, they made this into an incredible bread. The little touch of sweetness from the raisins took a great recipe and made it even better.

Yum, yum! I made per recipe letting bread rest for 30 mins before baking. I brushed the top with melted butter before, half way through and when I removed it from the oven. I made two loaves and they were quickly eaten. Very moist with a crunchy top.

I've made this four times now and it comes out fantastic. So easy! You can also add raisins to your personal taste - I used 1/2 cup dark raisins and 1/2 cup golden raisins. The only criticism I have is that when I baked it in the 9 x 5 loaf pan as specified, the batter puffed up too high and spilled out - fortunately I noticed and slid a cookie sheet underneath to catch the goo! After that I used a slightly larger loaf pan, 10 x 6, and it came out perfect.

I know this is supposed to be a very simple, dense bread, but it still didn't turn out the greatest. The picture shows a vivid white loaf, but I ended up with a yellow, cornbread-looking loaf, and the texture left something to be desired. It also took much longer to bake than the recipe called for (At least another 25-30 minutes, if I recall correctly). It tasted just okay, and I didn't have trouble eating the whole loaf by myself (I live alone), but I don't think I would make this again. For best taste, spread some preserves or jam on it. Spreading some butter on it was good, too.

Great recipe!
I'm from Greece, so I don't know whether this the original Irish soda bread or not, but I really liked it.
The only reason I'm giving it 4 out 5 stars is because I've changed a couple of things to suit my family's tastes, so I don't know what the original recipe would taste like.
We wanted it to be like a cake, so I've used one cup of sugar and added some raisins and chopped dried appricots...It tasted great!

Simple and fabulous. I added golden raisins and it added just a yummy sweetness. It's moist and has a great texture.  Great with coffee or and afternoon tea.

Very yummy; my family loved the bread, it was easy to make I would agree to leave your mixture out for 30 minutes before baking. Not bland at all everyone had seconds and my Father-in-law had thirds YAY!!!!

I thought this was really great, I made it just like the recipe said.  Didn't even need butter!  A heavy bread that kinda sneaks up on you and fills you up pretty fast and it tastes like it was made out of Bisquick, which I'm a fan of.

Definitely going to make again.

I had never had soda bread or corned beef & cabbage but my mom wanted some for St. Patrick's Day, so I tried this recipe and the recipe for slow cooker corned beef & cabbage. Wow! It was delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe! I should mention that it overflowed in my oven, so make sure your loaf pans are big enough!

My severely handicapped class made this bread for their St Patrick's Day party.  It was so easy and everyone was able to add something to the mix.  We baked it in a convection oven with a glass door so they could see it rise. It was fantastic!

I don't know what I did wrong.  It tasted great but it fell apart when I took it out of the pan -- I did oil and flour the pan but it got stuck anyway.

Yum!  I made this bread a few weeks ago after searching for a recipe to use up some left over buttermilk.  It is SO good!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  Since then (I've made it twice more), I now add large handful of golden raisins to the batter prior to baking.  I also follow the advice of a previous reviewer and let the dough/batter sit in the loaf pan for about 30 minutes before I bake the bread.

Thanks so much for a great recipe, it is quickly becoming a favorite (and a reason to buy buttermilk)!

I made this bread to bring to a St. Patrick's Day party at a friends house.  It brought RAVES!!  It was so easy, and turned out so perfectly.  I served it sliced with slices of sharp Dubliner cheese--Divine!!  Highly recommend this bread.  Super delish.

This was my first ever Irish soda bread. Doubled the recipe for two loaves and added craisins to one loaf, raisins to the other. Got rave reviews both at home and at work! Yummy and easy, easy.

Amazing! Love it! I have never made Soda Bread myself before but I have tasted it. This was a perfect texture, very moist. I made it with Special Irish Beef Stew and the two didn't really go together. This isn't really a dipping bread. If I wanted to make it a dipping bread I would cut back on the milk or add and extra 1/2 cup of flour and cut the sugar down to maybe 1/4 cup and not add craisins (which I used because I didn't have raisins). Hubby and I both think this is a keeper and next time I think I'll make it for a breakfast bread and add a tsp of cinnamon and eat it cold (make the night before) with jam. I boost the sugar to 1/2 cup this time and for a sweet bread that was perfect. Cooking time was also perfect. 325 for 70 minutes and it was amazing. Thanks for the superb recipe!

This was much better than another recipe on here. I wanted more of a "scone" type texture and not cakey but it was very good with 1 cup of raisins. Thank you

Made this exactly as written and it was great.  Very easy to mix up and bake in the loaf pan.  Wonderful texture and moist.  The butter and buttermilk made it very rich and it was not too sweet.  I keep going back for another slice!

I have made this recipe many times and have reviewed it before. It is a great recipe, but the photo looks nothing like the bread when I make it. Although raisins/currants are often in Irish Soda Bread, this one doesn't have them and doaesn't need them. That's part of the goodness of this recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Nice & Moist!  I cut down on the butter and used Splenda instead of sugar to make it 'healthier'.  I also added a cup of raisins.  Very moist, light & fluffy!

Not the TRUE traditional soda bread I'm used to, but it was good. Made 2 small loaves to try it- one with raisins and one without, which is how I usually eat it. Again, good and moist, but I still prefer our original family recipe. Also good to play around with.

I was a little disappointed in the bread. It came together easy enough and smelled delicious while baking, and it had an OK flavor (I did let it sit overnight in foil). The bread is very crumbly though, to the point I couldn't pull it out of the toaster but needed to fish it out with a knife [unplugged, of course :)]. And while the flavor is decent, I was hoping for more of a bread-y flavor. This is more of a cross between corn bread and sweet bread. Thanks for sharing, though.

Excellent recipe! My family and I loved this bread. It says this bread tastes best after sitting for a few hours but we thought it was so good fresh out of the oven. Nice and warm with melting butter...very good!

Delicious!  I didn't make this until later in the day and so it didn't get to sit much before we ate it . . . but it was still so good!!  I will make this often.  It was so easy to make and tastes very good, very moist.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best Soda Bread I have ever made, I included raisins. Most people didn't want to try it, till I coaxed them, that it wasn't dry. Now they want me to make it every week. 
Thanks

Easy, Quick, Excellent flavor and texture. It was a perfect accent to
Ita's Irish Bacon And Cabbage Soup.  Both made a very hearty comfort meal with raves from our guests.

This is a biscuity bread that tastes fine but it is NOT Irish soda bread -- though it bears a small resemblance to special-occasion Irish cakes.  We had both soda and "wheaten" or brown soda bread in Ireland, and they were hearty, heavy, and earthy.  A previous reviewer was right to bring up the famine -- eggs, butter, and sugar were ingredients used for festive occasions only.  Perhaps this recipe needs to be renamed as a tea-cake, but shouldn't be associated with the everyday staple food of generations of Irish peasants.

I was worried that this bread would be bland and tasteless, but when spread with real butter it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.. I served it an Irish dinner party I hosted and it was a huge success! It is also best a couple days after making it.

This is a convenient bread with a nice flavor although it doesn't have the  texture that kneading gives an authentic soda bread.  I will make it when I'm in a hurry.

Absolutely fantastic! This is easily and without a doubt the best soda bread I've tasted outside of Southern Ireland. Make sure you really beat the batter to ensure a light fluffy texture. Even better the next day, warmed with a little butter. Thanks so much, Karin!

Very good, especially when toasted with butter.  The consistency reminds me of cornbread, and it is somewhat a dense bread.  I've never made soda bread before, but wanted to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  Wrapping it and leaving it overnight really does add to the depth of the flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Very fresh tasting.

I made this on St. Patricks day with Corned beef, cabbage and potatos. I wanted to try something new with a meal I have been making for awhile now.  My boyfriend ate half the loaf for dinner, and finished the loaf the next day.  He wants me to make another loaf for him today, two days after St. Patricks day. So to say the least it went over well.   I followed the recipe exactly, I did not add rasins like some suggested. I highly recommend this bread!

Moist and delicious, I followed this recipe exactly and I don't think it could have come out better! Next time, I will add craisins for a different taste.  A perfect complement to the Irish Lamb Stew (also on allrecipes)

This was a great bread.  SO easy to make, and a great texture and taste.  Will definitely be making this for more than just St. Patty's day from now on.

I just made this with my kids for St. Pattys Day and it came out great! I had to make my own buttermilk, (1 tbsp vinegar to 1 c. of milk) I used 1/2 whipping cream in my buttermilk because it was about to go bad, and I made 4 small loaves instead of 1 9 inch. I also added crasins to it and yummmm. I just made a second batch to give out to neighbors as a gift! We will be making this again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Yummy.  I made this before going to bed and wrapped it up in foil, then in the morning just popped it in the oven to warm it up.  Very good and easy breakfast, topped with a little butter and jam, and fresh fruit on the side.  I did add twice as much melted butter then the recipe called for, but I think it turned out just fine.

My daughter needed to make an Irish recipe for a school project.  This one sounded easy and I went ahead and made an extra loaf for us while I was at it.  I wasn't familiar with Irish soda bread, so I wasn't sure how it would taste.  It actually wasn't too bad.  We ate it the next day and it was nice and moist, although a little bland.  Very easy recipe.

Totally loved this receipe!!! I am no whiz in the kitchen by any means but this soda bread looked like something out of a magazine when it came out of the oven.  I added 1/2 cup raisins & 1/2 cup golden raisins - it was so tasty.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks Karen.

Every year I have a St. Patrick's Day Party and am always looking for new recipes.  This year I tried the Irish Soda bread and what a hit.  I made gralic cheese bisquits because I wasn't for sure how this would go over, I have already rec'd requests to omit the garlic cheese bisquits and make more Irish Soda Bread!!!  I believe this will be a family favorite!!! Thanks!!!

Love it. Simple, easy, tastes GREAT when smeared with butter or dipped in gravy. This is an idiot-proof recipe.  The only thing I gotta remember to buy is the buttermilk because I usually have everything else on hand.  I hate raisins and carroway seeds in my bread (Hey I'm only HALF Irish) so I love this recipe.
