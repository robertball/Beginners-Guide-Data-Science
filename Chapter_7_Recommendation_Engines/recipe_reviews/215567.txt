This should probably be chilled before serving, but it is SO good, we ate it immediately.  I'm a recipe-tweaker - and this needed nothing!  It is an excellent summer soup, just as it is.

This was very nice, but I was surprised that even with the ginger it seemed bland. However, I did add a good amount of cinnamon, and after that, it was very good.

Excellent recipe but I added a cup of apple jc and about 1 oz honey and it tasted amazing just strain it to get out the grittiness
