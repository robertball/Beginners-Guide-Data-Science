This was just o.k. Too much prep required for what I consider to be an average recipe. Since this site has many much better halibut recipes, it's unlikely I will make this again.

Would have rated this one five stars, but the onion and cilantro in the salsa were a little overpowering... gave more spice than flavor, we thought.  I'll make it again but will probably decrease the onion and cilantro and increase the mango and pineapple, maybe add in a little cucumber as well.  It did, however, turn my seafood-phobic husband on to fish, so that alone deserves four stars!

I use the Salsa with any grilled fish.  We love it with Salmon!  If there is any leftover salsa, I will add a bottle of my home canned salsa and we eat it with corn chips.  I took this 'modified'salsa to a BBQ and it was the hit of the party!
