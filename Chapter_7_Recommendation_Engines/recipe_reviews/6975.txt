Being predominantly Swedish
by nationality, this is my
favorite bread.  My grandmother
used to make this often (it
was best hot from the oven).
My recipe that I have used
for several years is almost
identical to this one.  Occasionally,
I skip the orange zest and spices--then 
it is exactly like my grandmother's,
who came from Sweden in
her teens.

I thought bf would love this--I was sure he liked rye.  He's not so sure about this one.  Says it's "weird".  Why, I don't know.  So, I say to him, "I made it for you.  I thought you liked rye".  Him:  "I do".  So there you have it.  Bf, who likes rye, thinks this is a weird bread, goodness knows why.  It tastes like a light rye bread to me.  Nothing weird about it in my opinion.  Men.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe!  We have a weird household--don't worry so much about bf and his weirdness.  ;o)

MMmm this bread is really yummy. I am doing a report on Sweden for one of my classes and wanted to test this recipe out before I make it for my class. I didn't have caraway seeds, but I used everything else and it tasted good still. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I love trying different cultural cuisines and I am really glad I tried this recipe!

A satisfying, flavorful bread. Not having an orange on hand, I left that out, but was still very pleased with my results.

I have some great tips and have baked yeast breads for 35 years. Just making some simple healthier choices is a plus. First, always proof your yeast. Just use a half cup of the water called for to do it. I stay away from white flour in most bread recipes if I can so if using whole wheat you will only need about 4 cups. I used the rye flour called for, great texture. No egg yolks, so I used 3 large egg whites beatened with a fork. I love oranges so I grated two whole navel oranges and rinsed grater into pan with the water in recipe to get it all. Use everything else called for. I enjoy mixing my bread by hand. Will bake this wonderful bread again!

The first time I made it exactly as the recipe instructs and I loved it.  The second time I added 15g of ground cardamom and doubled the orange zest; it is even better (that might make it less authentically Swedish though)!   The best part is that it is so easy.

We decided to go Swedish one night: Swedish meatballs, braised red cabbage, and I found this recipe for A Swedish bread. I love the light rye flavor with the hint of orange.  It went very well with the meal, but the big surprise was how good it was toasted for breakfast (especially with cream cheese) and as a  sandwich bread. It also makes an incredible grilled cheese.

I am Swedish and have made Limpa breads in the past, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  While very tasty, it did turn out rather dry and dense, despite letting the dough take some extra time to rise.

My favorite rye bread is probably Jewish, but this recipe sounded delicious.  Everything seemed text book, though instead of needing more  flour, it seemed dry so I added a dab of butter--and I'd used another ounce of warm water to proof the yeast, so that was strange.  I think it came out exactly like it was supposed to, but I don't think I'd make it again.  A bit heavy, not that flavorful--and I added extra orange peel--and pricy after I bought new caraway and fennel seeds, etc.  It's making a good chicken salad sandwich with the crust cut off, though.

I cannot attest to whether or not this is true Swedish Limpa, but it is excellent rye bread. I followed the instructions, but is it really necessary to boil the orange and seeds?
