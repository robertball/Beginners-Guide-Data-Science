I researched chili recipies on this site and found this one that I especially liked. We were having a Chili cook-off at church and I wanted to enter. I made this recipe exactly as it is written and I won 1st place. I was so excited. I was totally honest and told them where I found the recipe and the name of it. I won a little chili pepper cowboy. Thanks for the great recipe: everyone at church wants it. This chili had the most outstanding taste of any chili I had ever eaten.It isn't too hot either; just right. Thanks again!!! I will make it over and over!

I've always heard that when having a party, never try a new recipe. Well, I'm glad I went out on a limb to risk trying this chili for the first time for a New Year's Eve party my husband and I had. I followed it to the letter, and thought the beef was going to be too tough to eat when it was done (the cubes were cut by the butcher and were quite large). As it cooked, however, the meat got very tender and all of the spices and the rest of the ingredients melded together for one of the best chilis I've ever had!
Thanks for posting this one--and thank daddy for us! It's a keeper!

This was amazing! It had a wonderful smoky flavor- not too tomatoey. I made it with stew meat (beef chuck cut into small pieces so it wasn't too tough) and no beans. I wasn't sure what type of mild chili powder/ground chile to use, so I used some ground New Mexico chiles (rather than the store-brand chili powder that already has the cumin and garlic mixed in) and just a little cayenne (not the full amount of ground red chile pepper that the recipe calls for) and it was plenty spicy with a fantastic flavor. I also did not add the full amount of flour as it was plenty thick, but the masa also added a very nice flavor. Goes very well with Amusement Park Cornbread from this site.

OK folks, I've Judged chili contests and have a number of chili recipes that I use for contests and gatherings. I made this recipe for an Engagement Party last night and had numerous compliments. Three adjustments I made, double the cumin, increased the jalapenos to 1 and 1/2 and finely chopped them and cooked it for 3hrs. The increased cooking time took the meat from OK to melt in your mouth tender and the consistancy required no masa. No one had less than two bowls. Great recipe for those that don't like beans. Thanks "Daddy"

Yum!  Nice and spicy, but not over the top.  Great flavor.  One of the best chilis I've had.  I scaled to use 2 lbs. beef, and used lean ground beef.  Here are the minor changes I made:  I added a bit of liquid smoke, used V8 instead of tomato sauce, used regular paprika, left out the jalapenos, and didn't need the flour as I just estimated the water.  I added a little ground black pepper, forgot the oregano, and cooked in a crock pot on low for several hours instead of simmering, for convenience's sake.  Also--I'm Texan and agree about the "no beans" rule, but my waistline disagrees so I added one can of ranch beans and one can of kidney beans, drained but not rinsed.  My husband loved it, said he could eat it every week.  It was too spicy for the kids.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an excelent chili. I didn't do anything different to it but just eat it. I believe if I had of been at the Alamo, I would not have participated after eating this chili because I would have found a pillow and went to sleep. That's how great it is. I rate it a "10".

It has been unusually Cold in So Cal. lately and I needed a warm chili to warm up my family. We loved this!  I used beer in place of the H2O since there is more flavor in beer. I also cut up skirt steak and Yes, I added beans too! My hubby Loves beans so he gets them:) I used a couple different ground chilies for this and the longer it sat, the hotter and Better it got!  I made some toasted sourdough garlic bread to round out the meal. Thank you KiKi I will for sure make this again.

A big "THANK YOU" to your daddy! We loved it! Next time I will buy better cuts of stew beef from a local butcher. (I wasn't pleased with the stew beef I purchased.) I think I'll play with the recipe by adding different types of peppers to it as well, but as written it was very good!  Personal family preference dictates that I add the bacon in this household! Thank so much for sharing.

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, only I made it for 5 servings instead of 20 (2 lbs beef). Then after a bit of tasting and pondering I added a couple splashes of lime juice, a generous pinch of sugar, chopped wild onions and some fresh cilantro, and upon serving topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese, a few bits of wild onion, a thin half-round slice of lime and a spring of cilantro. Excellent aesthetics combined with great flavor!

Delicious!!  I didn't have time to simmer it at all but it was still great.  The flavor was a little too mild but I'm not sure if that's just because I didn't let it simmer at all.  You may want to double the spices.  Also, I used cut up bacon instead of bacon drippings. Great recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

I had to give it 5 stars because not only did I love it, but it won first place at a chili cook-off tonight (against more than 12 different recipes).  I made two omissions while making this--jalapeno and masa harina (didn't have either on hand).  I also substituted regular paprika for sweet Hungarian (store was out).  I did add more cumin to suit my taste. I also added more tomato paste also to taste.  After cooking on the stove, I put it in the slow cooker for several hours on low--I think this really  made the flavors meld together.  This is not too hot, and what heat there is comes on at the end.  Thanks Daddy for finally sharing!

Something must have went wrong. This is not the Chili others have reviewed. I tried to follow the recipe to a "T," but made the following mods. I cooked it in a Roaster over 2 burners. I don't think that made a difference. I added 1 TBSP of Butcher's Pepper (I love pepper). Substituted Beef Broth for Water. Regular Paprika instead of Hungarian. Regular Oregano instead of Mexican. Corn Tortillas (ground) instead of Masa Harina. The Chili is plenty spicy. I like spicy food, but this Chili was borderline too hot. The consistency is too thick. Perhaps I should have used less or no Masa. The meat came out too beefy. I used Chuck Steak. Maybe it could have been browned longer. I followed the directions, but 8lbs is a lot of meat. It probably would have been better had the meat been cooked longer. The meat is very tender, maybe the beef broth was overkill. The Chili was fun to make and everything seemed to go according to the recipe. I can't understand why it tastes...So...Blah. I mean it tastes like hot beef not chili. That is my best attempt at describing the taste. If, by reading the other reviews, you are inclined to make this Chili, consider the following: A) Try half the amount of Ground Red Chili Peppers. You can always add the rest later. B) Make sure the meat is good and brown as stated in the recipe. C) Use half or totally eliminate Masa.

The absolute BEST chili!! I scaled to 10 servings and it made about 5 quarts of chili which is plenty for us.   My only substitutions were organic smoked paprika instead of Hungarian paprika, Tarragon instead of Mexican oregano and a 1/2 tsp. of cayenne red pepper instead of jalapeno. I used organic tomato sauce & tomato paste just for better quality.   You will regret it if you substitute the masa harina flour - this hominy and corn flour gives it the best, authentic, "Texas" taste!!! Plus, it's also gluten-free!

I am a transplanted Texan living in Boston.  You can't find good Texas Chili here.  This recipe certainly hit the spot.  The recipe author is correct REAL Texas chili does NOT have beans.  You can't find coarse ground chili beef hear either.  I bought stew meat and gave it a few pules in my food processor and it was perfect for Chili.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I tweaked the spices only slightly to suit my familiy's tastes.  I sued cayenne pepper for the heat and did not use a jalepeno (You can control the heat a bit better this way.)  I used quite a bit more cumin--probably around 4 tablespoons.  I like the smokey flavor of the cumin.  This is a great recipe.  I don't think you would go wrong sticking to it exactly.  If can also be adjusted to suit your personal tastes very easily.

I won a chili cook-off on Halloween with this recipe!  The only changes I made was that I used smoky paprika instead of Hungarian paprika.  I used a combo of New Mexico chili powder,  California chili powder, and Ancho chili powder.  The store was having a sale on sirloin so I used that and had the butcher use the chili grinder to make it coarse.  I got rave reviews!  Thanks Daddy!

This is the BEST chili I have ever made! My husband and son cannot handle beans in chili so I was so happy to find this recipe.  Changes: Scaled recipe to five, so don't use my changes unless you account for that!! I used olive oil instead of bacon drippings, chipotle chili powder instead of ground red chili pepper (also I DID use the regular chili powder called for), regular paprika instead of Hungarian, dried cilantro instead of Mexican oregano, 1 can of French onion soup, 2 t. salt instead of 1 1/2 t., one can of ro-tel pureed instead of jalapeno, and when I added the masa harina flour at the end I added one can of CREAMED corn.  I tasted before and after the corn and there was a HUGE difference as far as my personal preferences go. Also, if you have children or anyone sensitive to the spiciness, the cream corn seemed to take the edge of the heat from the pepper.

I've made this twice, no beans, it's fantastic! For my own little flare I add in vindaloo and curry, but not much, just enough that people kinda notice, and it's a major hit. I call it Bombay Texas Chili

I've never cooked a chili before, but thought this one looked good for an entry into our Church Chili Cook-off.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter.  I did add about half a cup of Youth Juice (fresh berries & seaweed), a little red wine, and one Habanero chili.  My wife did the shopping, and my daughter was the official taster.  We cooked it Friday nigh, let it sit off heat until Saturday noon, then re-heated & added the flour.  Result?  First place in the contest.  

Great chili Daddy!

This was  really good. My husband and kiddos really liked it, and my husband does not like chili. This converted him, though.  I have made it with chili meat, stew meat, and ground beef, but I prefer the ground beef (or game)  because chili meat is too gristly for me. It makes alot, by the way, but freezes well!  Be sure that your ground red pepper is NOT cayenne unless you want to blister your mouth! :) Cayenne can be added for more heat, though. I could not find ground red chile pepper, so I assumed ground chipotle pepper would work, and it does. I added about 3 tablespoons of that and it added a smoky flavor. It kinda reminded me of hot dog chili due to its consistency. I took a poll of who wanted beans in the chili, but nobody did. True, being from Texas, we just don't typically add beans to our chili. All in all, pretty easy to make and filling. My kids even asked for me to send it to school with them so they could heat it up for lunch! They are young and don't tolerate too much heat, but this is perfect for them. If it is too hot, you probably added cayenne pepper instead of another type. Lastly, it does well in a crockpot if you are not home during the day. I usually let it simmer on low.

This is a WONDERFUL chili.  I subbed a can of beef broth for an equal amount of the water, chopped up the jalepeno, used smoked paprika and simmered it for 3 hours.  My husband loved it and was so glad we found a good recipe!!!

I made this recipe for a chili cookoff at work last year. I left out the jalapeno (didn't have any). I cooked ground turkey in beef broth, didn't add salt or water because it was in the beef broth. I doubled the garlic, cut the ground red pepper in half (some people don't like it really hot). I used tomato puree instead of tomato sauce. I came in third. I think if I had added beans I would have ranked higher. I'm making this again this year with two kinds of beef and other changes. I can't give away all my secrets yet but will post again if it is a success.

My husband liked this.  I felt it needed more tomato taste, but I may just use crushed tomatoes next time.

Excellent Chili!  Made this for the first time a few years back for Christmas Eve dinner and it has become a family tradition since.  I have followed the recipe as called for but have let the chili on low for 3-4 more hours.  As another reviewer noted, the meat goes from OK to melt in your mouth tender.

I made this chili a couple weekends ago, almost as is, and am just getting to review it.  My familyand I are meat lover's. This chili is definately for the meat lover.  I used chuck roast instead of stew meat and it turned out to be a perfectly meat choice for this partucular chili. I used California Red Chili powder because it's more mild than other types.  I guess one thing I could have done without was the grainess from the masa harina.  I had never cooked with it before so I didn't expect it.  Next time I'll add a small can of beef broth to make up for the extra water need for the masa to absorb and get soft. Maybe that'll help with the grainyness  Overall, though, 5 star for taste, ease of assembly, and hearty goodness. :)

This is awesome chili! I made some slight changes based on other reviews. I halved the recipe, then halved the spices, doubled the cumin, and left out the jalepeno. I'm sort of a spice wimp, but this left it hot and flavorful but not scalding. If you're not a big fan of super-spicy foods, the recipe as it stands will probably be WAY too hot, so start small and adjust later. But the flavor was still amazing! I also used much less liquid because I cooked it in my slow cooker (8 hrs on low after browning the meat). I combined the tomato paste, sauce, and beef broth (instead of water) and just guessed, and ended up using about half of what was called for. Another thing that affected the amount of liquid I used is that I did not add the masa harina because I'm on a grain-free diet. My boyfriend has never had good chili and doesn't like beans, so I'm hoping this will convert him!

A little dull in taste and the beef wasn't as tender as expected.  Might be me but I followed pretty much the full recipe.

Tastes like home!  This recipe was great, but I like my chili a little more spicy, so I doubled the jalepenos and added cayenne (about the same amount as the chile).  Turned out great, and I will definitely be making it again.

Substituted ground beef (80%) and less poundage per serving. Think I used like 2-1/2 lbs on a scaled to 10 servings. Also didn't use jalapenos's (kids don't like hot) nor masa harina flour. Still came out pretty good and going to make it again tonight!

This was pretty good stuff.  I think that it was actually better the next day.  Don't skip out on the masa harina.  That really pulls it all together.  I used a combination of New Mexico chili poweder and California chili powder.  It didn't seem to have enough cumin taste for me.  So I added quite a bit more after tasting it.

We really liked this chili although I have to day that I reduced the amounts because there are only 2 of us here.  I think that the biggest change that I made to this recipe was to not add any water.  Everything else I did as instructed.  I just did not think that any water was necessary.  We loved it.  Served it with hot dogs cheese and green onions.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

I cut the recipe in half and it was way, way, way to hot. Even for a crowd that loves spicy. It might be my fault since the recipe called for 1/2 a jalepeno, which meant cutting it in half...if you do try this, maybe still keep 1 jalepeno whole.

I added 1/2 green bell pepper, two cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles and two cans of pinto beans.  I used HEAPING measurements of cumin, red pepper and paprika, more garlic and onions.  After cooking for just 1 hr, this chili got rave reviews. Took the jalapeno out after the first hour since it was pretty spicy at that point.  Added the beans and finished cooking.  It was great!

This is the real deal- I'm a homesick Texan and we loved this recipe.I tried it because a "real Texas" chili does not have beans- only as a optional topping. My 6 and 8 year olds were leary at first, we told them it was enchilida stew and then they devoured it. I made a double batch so that I could use the extra as enchilida sauce, but there weren't any leftovers!! This is chili contest material, thank you so much!!

This is the best chili I have ever had - and I lived in Texas for two years.  I do a couple of things - most notably ¼ cup of dark chocolate.  It really adds some complexity to the flavors.  I came in 2nd in a neighborhood Chili Cook-Off with this recipe - everyone raved about it.  I think I would have won if the winner didn't bring their entire, extended family to vote for theirs - but shhhsh - told tell anyone I said that...

This is our new favorite chili recipe. I've made it several times and it always turns out beautifully.  For the reviewers who cannot find red chile powder, look in the mexican foods section or go to a mexican market. I'm in Texas so it's not hard to find, but I can imagine it might be in other states. Cayenne is not red chile powder! They are not made from the same type of chile.

Anyway.. I have a family of 5 with 3 teens and we rarely ever have any leftovers. If we do get lucky, it's even better the next day.  I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of occasionally using jarred diced garlic packed in oil instead of fresh.. but you cannot tell the difference. I also use jarred diced jalapeno when I don't have the time to go pick up fresh. Masa harina is usually not necessary because this is a thick, thick chili.  My family loves it!

This recipe created a very bland, overly 'beefy' chili.  We (both Texans, by the way) followed the recipe exactly and didn't even save the leftovers.

I've made this recipe twice.  Once using the chopped beef, and once using the coarse ground beef.  We liked the ground beef better.  This is the best tasting chili I have ever made. We took it to a football tailgate party and not a speck of the chili was left. It is really, really good!

let me say that I was scared to cook chili.  I thought there were only 2 kinds, good or bad, and this one is GREAT.  I cooked it and served at work, I cut the recipe in 1/2 but there was no need because it went FAST! Way to go DAD! As a fellow Texan...thanks for the recipe ya'll!

Absolutely the best chili I've ever put in my mouth. We are taking it to a Church Chili Cook Off tonight and I think we have a winner. We cut the recipe in 1/2 and had a full crock pot. We'll be making this again. We backed off just a little on the spices, but not much and chopped the jalapeno fine and added the whole thing(no seeds). Thanks for the GREAT RECIPE

I needed a good batch of chili for canning so I based the recipe on this one.  For canning purposes, I made it soupier with the addition of 2 quarts of tomato soup base I had already canned. 
 I left out the jalepeño because my chili powder mix is  already  pretty hot from the serrano pepper powder I put in it.  Also for canning purposes, I omitted the masa harina.  But, that will go in after we open a quart jar the next time we eat chili for dinner.  What a fabulous, true-Texan chili this is!  FYI, with my changes, the recipe yielded 7 quarts, 3 pints, plus enough for a light lunch for me and the kids.

This is a wonderful and flavorful chili! I am originally from Houston, Texas and while it is true that most Texans do not use beans in their chili recipe, making chili is all about what you have on hand and what you prefer.  Thanks for the posting and keeping it real with the ingredients!

Your Daddy might raise an eyebrow at this variation, but damned if I'm gonna let a health issue that keeps me away from meat keep me from a bowl of Texas Red.

Here's the subs for vegetarians who want this excellent chili:

For bacon grease: fry veggie bacon and then crumble into coconut oil as you melt it. Liquid smoke and jerk rub can be added optionally if you want to emulate sweet and smoky bacon.

For the stew meat: I used beefless meat of wheat tips. 

Otherwise follow the recipe to the T on the old abandoned cafe sign just outside Sealy on I 10 towards San Antone.

I loved the flavor of this chili, but I didn't like the consistency the masa harina gave it. Next time I'll make it without the masa. Otherwise, I followed it to a T. Excellent chili. I'll reduce the cayenne and omit the jalapeno to make it a little milder for my kids.

I made this chili last night for Men's Night at our church. I was skeptical about making such a hugh amount. The crock pot left with 6 quarts in it and came back empty. I still had a lot left over for my family and then some to put in the freezer.I did omit all of the hot ingrediants, used 8 TBS of chili powder,regular paprika and regular oregano and no jalapeno. It is the perfect chili for myself because I cannot tolerate spicy food. This is the first time I have made Chili from scratch so please tell your Daddy thanks so very much. I do believe if they had this at the Alamo we would have won!!!

I followed the directions to word by word the first time I made this. It was delicious and went over very well with my family, but it was missing something for me. I grew up eating my grandfather's chili and for the life of me I cannot reproduce it because he never measured anything, just taste and add. So I tweaked this recipe with chili ground brisket, added some Italian Seasoning (basil, oregano, rosemary mix), added a touch of finely ground cilantro, and a lot more chili powder.  Almost got grandpa's chili, but I highly recommend this recipe for any chili lover.

This came out way too dry.  There was no sauce at all.  I look at the photos and do not see how there can be any liquid floating around with 8# of beef and only that small amount of water and tomato sauce.  It's not possible.  I did a 1/2 recipe and still had to add an entire can of beef broth plus another 8 oz of tomato sauce. ..and it's still not got much sauce relative to the meat.   Man, I wish there were a way for folks to respond to each other here.

As a central Texan, we have no limit to good Mexican food but this chili was a bit much. Too spicy for me and I like spicy food. I even cut back on all the spices since some reviewed it as too spicy. The taste was OK but... it overshadowed the meat which should be the star. Could have just swallowed a bunch of spices. I had to add some cheddar cheese on top to make it easier to get down.  After the second time we had it, that was all we wanted and the rest was thrown away.

Very delicious. Didn't have all the specialty spices, but the regular ones seemed to work. Didn't have the red peppers but it didn't matter, still tasty. Used the left over brisket and cut it into chunks and made it so meaty. Will definitely make it again.

Had to scale down the recipe, but the flavors were amazing!  I actually modified a little because I wanted more smokiness so I used 1 lb of cubed beef and 1 lb of fully cooked smoked brisket. My wife & I loved it! Thank you for sharing!!!

WOW!!!  This recipe is AWESOME!!  It took a little time to prepare but the overall outcome is truly tasteful. I did make some additions and changes. For ground red chili pepper I used ancho chile pepper and smoked paprika along with sweet paprika (quantities halved). I also added garden fresh red and green bell peppers to the mix but waited until all ingredients were already simmering. If you do not have a garden then any top quality red and green bell peppers will work. As mentioned in other reviews this recipe has just the right amount of heat. Not to much and is absolutely delicious!!! Even my seven year daughter, who is a VERY FINICKY eater LOVED IT.

This is wonderful. Hubby couldn't take the  chili powde or jalapenor. Too sensitive to peppers. This time I halved the chile pepper, deleted the jalapeno but added some finely diced bell pepper to onion and it was great for him. Thanks Daddy!

Won second place with this in chili cookoff!  Used 1/2 of a large jalapeño and it was quite hot.  Didn't need masa.  We did use angus, cut in small chunks and course ground chili meat.  Definitely a keeper!

I wanted to make an authentic Texas Chili and this was a GREAT guide! I made changes because I'm not good a following recipes....I always want to make it my own In a way. I added more cumin and white sugar, bay leaves and layered the main spices with beef broth throughout the cooking process because I wanted it to cook longer. It was finished by the end of the Texans game. We lost but the Chili was a winner! My husband said it was the best I had ever made :)

I made this in my slow cooker on low for 5-6 hours. I made it without beans but added some bell peppers to give it some veggies. It turned out really well and my husband had multiple helpings as did I. I think the bell peppers added a bitterness that I wasn't expecting so added a bit of sugar to round out the flavor. I also pulled out the jalapeno after a few hours since I knew the heat would increase with time. Thus recipe is a keeper!

Good as is.  I cut the cayenne by half and added 1/4cup lemon juice.  cooled it to degrease, then came back and added the masa, with a touch more water.  The masa adds a subtle corn taste. I also doubled the cumin. I got 12 pints.

I didn't make any changes, this is my favorite chili recipe.
 I made it three weeks ago adding beans, I'll not add beans in future batches.

I would recommend having beans as a side dish.

We made it as the recipe stated.  For the Red Chili i found this already chopped up in a tube in the organic produce section.  I reduced the recipe down by a 1/4 because it was only for my husband and myself.  It was definitely better the next day, much more flavor!  Ours was pretty thick and we didn't need the mesa flour.  Next time I may make a full batch and freeze the rest for freezer meals.  This is our new chili recipe, thank you so much for posting!!!

Texan hubby said this is the best chili I've made (and we've made a LOT)! The only thing I did different -- only because of what I had in the pantry -- I used a regular sized can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Left out the flour and used dehydrated red jalapeno since I didn't have a fresh jalapeno. I also roasted the three chili pepper powders (I was out of cumin) first, which brought out the smokiness a little more. Great recipe -- I'm headed back for seconds now! :)

Born and raised in Texas, moved to Minnesota, needed a Texas fix.... I substituted ground red chili pepper for pureed red chilie (frozen) from New Mexico (they sell at Kroger in Texas. I stock up when I'm home). This chili is awesome awesome awesome. The name of the chili is almost more awesome. When I poured myself a bowl, I added cheese and sour cream, and that put it over the top! Entering in a (MINNESOTA) chili cook-off tomorrow... I'll keep you up to date on the results!

I added kidney, black and pintos to this. Habanero, jalepeno, and Serrano peppers as well. I tossed in some bakers chocolate and a couple of dried chile de ristras to the crock pot as well.  Oh,  a can of habanero Ro-tell. It's in the waiting overnight stage right now, can't wait!!
I would love to try your Dads chili, I bet it was the bomb!
Thanks-

Delicious.  I had to modify the recipe a tiny bit for the palate of an 8 year old.  Had to use just a pinch or two of the chili pepper and used anaheim pepper instead of jalapeno.  My kiddo, who is not a fan of ground beef even ate this.  I have made this twice in the past 2 weeks.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

I made this the night before, reheated it, and took it over to our friend's chili cook-off. It won first place, beating 13 other entries! The chili was wonderfully thick and hearty with just the right balance of chili spices and heat. I think the masa harina flour is a must, giving the dish another dimension of flavor. Definitely my new go-to chili recipe. Thank you so much for posting!

My absolute favorite chili.  Usually I make internet recipes by looking at 3-4 different recipes for the same thing and then sort of blending them into my own creation, but this chili is just right as is.

This is some of the best chili I've had! I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings, using 2 pounds of beef. It reminds me a bit of the chili sauce that comes on top of beef enchiladas at Tex-Mex restaurants. Muy bueno!

I see several posts saying be sure to use ground red chili pepper and not cayenne pepper.  Can someone explain the difference?  I went to the store looking for red chili pepper but could not find anything labeled that.  I found red pepper--searching the internet says that is the same as cayenne.  I also found chili powder which is red - but nothing labeled red chili pepper.
