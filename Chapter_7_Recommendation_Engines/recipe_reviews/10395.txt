These cookies were awesome...I don't know what the other raters did to make them taste so bad but I did exactly what the recipe said and they came out really good...They weren't too much like cookies, more like little fluffy breads, but I sandwiched two with cream cheese and it was soooo yummmy!

This would make a better muffin than a cookie.  Add 1/4 cup of applesauce to sweeten it up a bit.

My rating for this recipe would be "0" stars if possible.  I will have to agree with Sheila; there is something missing in this recipe.  "Taste"  There is none.

Belatedly realized after i made it.. why should be baking soda? Baking soda makes the cookies more like muffin than cookies. Just add 2 tbs of palm sugar, vanilla essens and don't add baking soda.

Definitely more of a muffin texture.  Not cookie-like at all.  I searched out this recipe because I had a LOT of leftover cooked sweet potatoes.  They lack in sweetness and adding raisins was a big help, but when finished I also felt they needed something.  The cream cheese icing recommended would have been great, but I made a powdered sugar glaze that also brought up the sweetness level.  My husband declared them quite delicious, so there you go!

I goofed and melted the butter, not being much of a cook, I didn't realize that softened butter and melted aren't the same thing. It was a good mistake to make. They made wonderful muffin cookies! Everyone loved them. Also, as I cannot eat wheat, I subbed Bob's Red Mill Wheat and Gluten Free Flour and had great results.

After making the first batch we thought raisins might add a bit of sweetness. That was fantastic! Next batch added some Chia seeds and even better!!!
