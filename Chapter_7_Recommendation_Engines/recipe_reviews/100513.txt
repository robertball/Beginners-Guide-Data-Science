This is a great recipe!!i don't the Worcestershire sauce; try black pepper instead !! With the hamburger and when put in the bun!!  It is a staple here in Nebraska , too.  You could add a slice of cheese too for a cheese(any kind)  runza!!  ( best version of all) Pasta/spaghetti sauce makes a great italian runza when used instead of broth, too.

I was hesitant at first to try this recipe, but I sure am glad that I did.  My wife doesn't usually like to try new things and since I do all the cooking, I am always trying to serve something different that she would enjoy.  It is surely something that I will make again.  My wife even loved it.

I grew up with a recipe very much like this one. I was raised by my Polish grandmother and my Russian grandfather and meals like this were just about always a staple food. I'd almost forgotten how good these tasted. We'd have these over macaroni when my Grams didn't have time to bake. Sometimes my 'Djeda' (Russian for Grampa)
replaced the fresh cabbage with saurkraute because he loved to cook even more than my Grams. Any which way that was decided to eat this meal, it was always fantastic. 

Thank you for bringing back many cherished memories with this great recipe.

I added a small can of tomato paste, which I think improved the flavor a great deal.  I can't pinpoint it, but it tastes familiar somehow.  Good use of cabbage!

I did not have beef broth so I used water instead. I also used a rather large head of cabbage.  My husband cannot eat gluten, so we ate this plain -- and loved it!  Next time I will try to use beef broth and more meat (or perhaps less cabbage). The barbecue-ish smell (the simmering combined mustard and Worcestershire sauce smelled fantastic!) inspired us to add a touch of ketchup on top.  We couldn't stop eating it!

My husband was a little skeptical about the combination but had two burgers and commented how good it was several times.  My teenager liked it as did my picky 11 year old.  I will make it again!!!

Today (1/17/10) I made it using venison burger.  It was just as good.

Our ratio of meat to cabbage was way off (it was mostly cabbage) but it was delicious. Served it over bread like sloppy joes, but I actually preferred it without the bread. Will definitely make this again - we'll try to have a better meat/cabbage ratio next time.

We enjoyed these.  They're essentially just Runza (also called bierock) filling piled on a bun rather than inside dough.  I did up the mustard, add some garlic powder, and add a few tablespoons of ketchup.

I would be more inclined to say these originated with Russian immigrants in Nebraska.  I was not raised in either Iowa or Nebraska, but the Runza restaurant chain originated in Lincoln, NE.  And their are entire neighborhoods labeled "Russian bottoms".  It's a great fast food chain if you happen on one in the midwest.  Their sandwiches are yummy and this is a good one.  Thanks!

These were just ok for us... much prefer the traditional dough runzas even though they are more work.

This recipe is replacing my old bierock one. My old recipe was always too bland, but this recipe solves that with the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, broth and garlic. Also, the proportion of cabbage and onion to meat is just right. I like the idea of steaming the buns--very clever!

On my next try (and there will be one!) I'll probably dial the mustard back to 1 tablespoon, but other than that it's going to be by the book. Thanks for sharing.

My husband is from Nebraska and really loved this recipe. I added two slices of American cheese and a spread of mustard to toasted buns. I warmed the buns on an oiled griddle. Yummy!

I love Runzas. This is great when you don'the want to go to the trouble of the fresh bread dough route. Be sure to use a soft fresh bun, no too big or thick. We use potato rolls. Also use black pepper, a lot of it makes the flavor.

I made it exactly as called for in the recipe, except I used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard because that was what I had. It was wonderful and will make again.

My whole family loved this recipe! Made the recipe as written, but used a tougher bun than suggested. Bought Jimmy John's sub bread (a local sub shop), brought it home, and loaded it with this filling.  Yum!

Based on the reviews, I was hopeful this would be a good winter rib-sticking and flavorful meal.  I tasted it near done and my tastebuds nearly died of boredom!  Tastes like boring cabbage with a little beef (yawn).  Luckily, I thought fast and dumped in a 6 oz can of tomato paste and it seemed to salvage the investment (along with a little hot sauce).  Would probably be better with real Kraut instead of bland cabbage.
