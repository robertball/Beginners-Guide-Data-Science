Oh boy! I'm not 100% certain I prepared this as it was intended but if not, my interpretation was excellent too. There are many types of crabs so I'm not sure which kind you are supposed to use here. Blue crab maybe? I don't know? I used the kind available to me and they did not disappoint. The sauce is excellent and I think it would be good with shrimp too. There was just the right amount of sweet, heat, and tart and then you go adding cilantro and MMMMMMM!  Messy yes but 5 stars all the way! Thanks for sharing!
