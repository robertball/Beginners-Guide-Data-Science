This was a wonderful change from Lemon Chicken. Not sure what some of the other reviewers did, but this was not only simple, but very yummy!
A couple things I did different:
Along with the juice from the 2 limes, I added about a 1/4 cup of concentrated lime juice. I also blended the mayo and the parmesan with a hand mixer for about 1 minute on low. TIDBIT: 12 tablespoons parmesan is equal to 1 CUP.

Very good recipe and my Husband really liked it - he cleaned his plate!! However I was a little uneasy using 2 cups of mayonaise so I used 1C mayo and 1C APPLESAUCE!!! Then for an extra measure of lime flavor I added a "dash" of roses lime juice to enhance the real limes I did use. I am glad I cut the mayo - it would have been too strong otherwise. We'll have this again though I have to recommend it to others! - J

This dish is totally disgusting. Flavourless and greasy.

My family really enjoyed this and it was very quick and easy. I did alter the recipe as I thought that 2C of Mayo was too much. I cut the amount in half and also reduced the parmesan (still left plenty to cover the chicken) I also added a thin layer of bread crumbs and topped with fresh Cilantro which gave the chicken a nice crust. Definitely will make this again.

The chicken was flavorless and the mayo/lime mixture chunked up. It was like eating hot mayo drenched in lime juice on a flavorless chicken.

Although this dish was very easy and quick to prepare the mayo/cheese marinade chunked up after cooking and kept sliding off the chicken (like a skin) when cut into. I may as well have cooked the chicken breasts plain!

Love it but would definitely lower the mayo amount in half. I use the parm in a jar. it gives it a nicer texture.

This recipe came out great.I rubed the chicken with the mayo mixture and let it stay in the fridge for 20 minutes and then cooked it. Came out tasty.

I thought this came out really well. I loved the mayo/parm mixture on top and the lime flavor was just enough to add a little tang. Quick and simple to make and my family enjoyed it. Will definitely make again.

My daughters loved this chicken. I didn't have lime so I used lemon. Also I used boneless chicken thighs and cut them up in bite size pieces. This was so good!!! I cooked it on a cooking stone.

My family really liked this recipe. I cooked the chicken on a rack so it was not so greasy. I've already been asked to make it again.

I adjusted the recipe for two chicken breasts and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. It was good, although I might use more lime juice next time.

Very tasty. I followed some of the changes made by others such as using concentrated lime juice and also added one of my own. I zested the two limes into the mayo/parm mixture. Added a little extra kick! Will definitely make it again!

The chicken was very moist. I only used 1/2 of the mayo and 1/2 the parmesan. I added some garlic powder and parsley. If your chicken doesn't brown at 17 minutes broil under the broiler for a few minutes.
