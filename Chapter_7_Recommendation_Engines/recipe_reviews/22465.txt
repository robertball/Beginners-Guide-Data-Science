This was easy to prepare, and delicious! The chops were very tender. I took advice from other reviewers, and baked it covered until the last 20 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!

This receipe was delicious. My husband and daughter just loved it. The porkchops were amazingly tender. I did change the receipe a little. Instead of 1/2 cup of ketchup, I used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup tomato sauce, only because a few reviews said the chops tasted to ketchupy.

I overcooked my chops a little, but they still came out really tender and flavorsome. If I were to make this again, I would cut the onion into thick wedges - I sliced them quite thinly, and most of them baked away to nothing. A very simple, inexpensive and tasty meal. Thanks, Cindy!

These are really good. Thinner chops need less cooking time. I add a bunch of spices to the sauce, and the chops come out moist and delicious everytime.

these chops were VERY dry. I even cut the cooking time down by 30-40 mins. The recipe didn't indicate whether to use bone-in or not so I used the boneless.  I think the sauce was like a BBQ sauce.  I could've used a bottled sauce and taste the same.  Sorry, I will not be making this again.  I don't seem to have much luck with pork...

Good flavor (I omitted the sugar and added 1/2 t. Worchestershire), but the chops were not very tender.  I didn't cover the pan because the recipe didn't say to.  There was plenty of liquid in the pan at the end, however.  If anyone else has success with this recipe, I hope they'll post a review saying how they did it!

I agree with another reviewer; this is too "ketchupy" & not enough spice. I tried adding some zip to it with some minced garlic but will keep searching...thanks anyway!

Love these!  I'm not usually a big fan of pork chops as they can be kind of tough.  These are awesome - nice and tender and so flavorful!  I make these often.

You have to really, really like ketchup to enjoy this one. I agree with some other reviewers that tomato sauce would be better. After making alot of changes, which I wouldn't be able to repeat again, it come out pretty good but nothing like the orginal recipe.

I made these for dinner.  I should have known better.  Very thick boneless chops cooked for an hour in a covered dish and they were dry and near close to tough.  No flavor-- the sauce slipped off the chops into the baking dish.  At minimum, salt and pepper should be added.  I guess this just isn't a recipe for me and it certainly didn't do anything for my desire to make a decent pork chop.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Flavor was great.  I made lots of extra sauce. I used red wine vinegar and a little chopped garlic and half ketchup/half tomato sauce.  I was disapointed though -  it was dry.  I used 3/4in boneless chops and cooked them covered for 1hr uncovered 15 min....   to long for boneless (I guess).  I will try this one again since I like the flavor, but definately shorter cook time.

Thanks Cindy B.  Great flavor, and you can cut the chops with a fork.  I gave this recipe to a new cook, and her family loved it.

It was really really good. My picky 8 year old nephew even loved it. The chops were very tender which is sometimes hard to accomplish for me. Wanna try the sauce over some chicken next time!

This was an absolute melt-in-your-mouth dinner!!! I reduced the ketchup slightly so as not to be overpowered and everyone loved it! Very easy to prep and produce. Definitely something i'll cook again.

These chops are so tender they fall off the fork.  I started with (last minute decision) completely frozen solid pork chops.  I sprayed the pan, placed the chops in, put 1/2 inch sliced sweet onion directly on top of each chop.  Then I put the ketchup sauce on top of each chop.  I covered & baked for 1 1/2 hours.  Then an additional 1/2 hour uncovered.  Try it...you won't be sorry.  Nancy F

These were really good, I wanted more sauce since I was serving with rice, so I double the ketchup and 4X the other  sauce ingredients. Baked in tin foil to keep all the chops juices. Very tender and tasty

My family and I loved this recipe.  The pork had a great flavor and was very tender after cooking for 2 hrs.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The best thing is that this recipe only rates as 4 points on a Weight Watchers scale.  Highly recommended.

Recipe is pretty good as is! Easy! We have made this three times in the past 6 weeks, each time we make a few changes. Made it last night for dinner, with a few tweaks, and probably found a family fav!! Here is our version: Cooked it at 425 for 30-35 mins. Covered w/ foil first then remove with about 10 mins left to cook. Sliced onions into rings. Covered bottom of pan with onions. put pork chops on top of onions. Used 1 tsp. of vinegar, 1 tsp. of honey, 1/4 cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup of tangy bacon salad dressing, 1 tsp. of yellow mustard and 1 heaping tsp. of brown sugar.

As a new mother-in-law visiting her son and his wife I felt it my responsibility to try this recipe.  It was quite delicious and very easy.  I did follow the advice of several reviewers and make more sauce.  In fact I tripled the ratio of liquid to pork chops, then baked the whole thing for 1 and 1/2 hours covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  The result was moist and tasty pork chops that could be cut with a butter knife.  I used tomato paste, diluted with water of course, instead of ketchup, and added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made. I made 8 think boneless, covered for 1 1/2 hours then uncovered for another 1/2 hour. I did have to double the sauce and I used only half the ketchup and replaced it with tomato sauce. It came out perfect! Will make again and again!

It was pretty good. Felt like something was missing, but I'm not exactly sure what. It needs some type of spices added to it though. Next time I make it, I'll be trying some out.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this much. It just tasted too ketchupy. I only put in half the ketchup and it still had too much of the taste. I won't be making this again.

I thought these were pretty good but not outstanding.  My 13 yo son said "Ok but nothing to make me want them again".. which means never again, lol.  The flavor of ketchup was pretty much reminiscent of meatloaf,...

This recipe was the answer to my search for tender pork chops.  Not only can you cut them with a fork, but they fall off the bone.

Sue's recipes:
Oct. 19, 2014 11:37 am
I cook the pork chops in a skillet on stovetop; I only use the ketchup, onions and water. Salt & pepper the chops if desired, lightly brown in skillet, add the sliced onions and plop some ketchup on top, add a little water and let simmer with lid on. You will have to guess on ketchup and water amounts depending on how many you are making. You will end up with a nice red sauce/gravy-like, more than this picture shows. The onions will just about cook down and disappear. Simmer until chops are fork tender. --- Serve with boiled butter potatoes, (use salt & pepper)add dry parsley. Drizzle the red sauce over the potatoes.

It was good, but I have just 1 question.  WHERE IS THE SAUCE.  I took advice from others and doubled the sauce but there was nothing in the pan when I pulled it out of the oven. We all thought it was okay, but I wont make again. Could really taste the ketchup.

This was very delicious.  My husband really liked it.  Based on other reviews, I made more of the sauce and also used tomato sauce with the ketchup.  I used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.  I doubled the rest of the ingredients.  Baked it covered, and when done, threw it over white rice with salad.  Very easy meal.

We thought these were really good and super tender, however, I didn't have any *liquid* in my pan at all. In fact, I'm gonna double the sauce next time and brush it on the chops because the sauce sort of just stayed where I put it. I used bone-in chops, which I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder prior to topping with the onions and sauce and they turned out nice and brown, just not very *saucy*. They did taste great though I just wish I would have made more sauce, but I definately will do that next time (yes, I will be making these again)! Oh, and I baked them for 1 hour and 15 minutes and during that time the house smelled heavenly. Thanks for posting. :)

The taste of these were great, and I will definitely make them again. However, I could not cut them with a fork, so we'll have to see if I can figure out how to get them more tender.

This was really good! I used seasoning salt, garlic powder, and red cayenne pepper to spice the chops up a little bit before adding the sauce.  I made the sauce as others suggested 1/2 ketchup & 1/2 tomato sauce and kept everything else the same. Cooked only for 1.5hrs and they came out moist & tasty!!! My family loved them. I will make them again. AWESOME!!

THis was okay, pretty good. I cooked my on the stove. I used red onions, instead of plain, and i used balsamic vinegar instead of the plain. I carmelized the onions and browned the chops on both sides then added the sauce with 1/4 cup of water and covered on the stovetop for 35-40 minutes until tender. My family liked it, it was very easy, i added minced garlic and red pepper flakes, salt & pepper, and that was the ticket. only use 1/4 of the ketchup.

This recipe was great!  I cooked it for two hours and they were perfect.  The only difference was I used butterflied pork chops and just put some of the sliced onions inside.  They were great with french cut green beans.

I prepared this dish with it covered until the last twenty minutes.  I only cooked it for an hour, yet the meat was dry, tough, and overcooked.  I would advise those that have thin chops to be careful to not overcook.  The sauce tasted, not surprisingly, like ketchup.  I added a garlic clove, but it did little.  I think the next time I will try with garlic and some soy sauce, more mustard, and less catsup.

These were pretty good.  I baked them for 1 hour.  I covered them and baked them at 350 for the first half hour and then removed the foil the last 30 minutes and turned up the temperature to 400.  The sauce was pretty good, but I think next time, I will add more brown sugar.

The chops were very tender and good but just a tad too sweet for my family and guest. Will probably try tomato sauce instead of catsup next time.

I learned this recipe about 23 years ago from a Better Homes and Gardens book. My husband and I like alot of sauce and serve it over rice, so I add alot more ketchup and brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of vinegar and I cover it the whole cooking time. I cut the cooking time to 1-1 1/2 hours depending on the thickness of my chops. We serve it with rice, sauce on the rice, and green beans. Enjoy!!!

Very similar to what my mother called 'Spanish Pork Chops'.  I put pork chops in the roasting pan, squirt some ketchup & mustard on each one and mush it around with a fork.  Top with thick slices of onion topped with a bit more ketchup and mustard.  Bake for an hour...it'great!

This is a good recipe, especially for last minute, because you usually have most of these ingredients on hand.

The sauce for this is basically the same thing that goes on top of meatloaf. With that said, the chops did come out tender and everyone ate them up. Super Easy.

Sorry -- this didn't go over well with anyone at the table, particularly the cook!  Think the recipe would need to be seriously "tweaked" for me to try again -- but I won't be coming back to this to find out what it needs.

My boyfriend loved the sauce! I am not a fan of pork, but no one eats chicken here in Germany because of this whole Bird Flu, so that is what we've been eating! I am not very good at cooking meat yet, so the pork was a little overcooked. I also was using a counter-top oven because my apartment doesn't have one!! (I live at a med student dorm at the hospital). The sauce was very yummy. I also added some Chinese hot sauce (the one that is dark orange and comes in a clear squeeze bottle with a neon green top)for some extra spice! I will make this again when I get home and have a normal oven!

Best pork chops ever. I will definately make them again (and again, and again). I added more brown sugar than called for (about 4 tbl) because I like a sweeter sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a great and easy recipe.  My four-year old loved it, and she's very picky!  I added a dash of ginger, and sprinkled some brown sugar on top of it right before I put it in the oven.  Turned out great!  Also, I covered it and let it cook for about an hour, then uncovered for the remaining time.  Came out perfectly tender!

My husband loved these pork chops. He loves onions and ketchup so I knew I couldn't go wrong with these. They were very tender. One out of three of my step-children loved them. The other two just said they were good. I'm not an onion or a ketchup fan but I did think they tasted good. My picky husband loved them so I will make them again.

This was quick and easy, which was nice.  And the chops did come out very tender.  I just thought it was sort of boring.  Doesn't look real appetizing either.
