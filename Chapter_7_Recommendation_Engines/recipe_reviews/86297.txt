This recipe was wonderful! I used ketchup instead of BBQ sauce and it tasted just like my hamburger meatloaf. Thanks! We have recently become vegetarian and were just craving something like this!

This recipe can be very very good or very very bad....depends entirely on the barbeque sauce.  Be very careful

I really liked this -- and I'm a meat eater! I didn't use Parmesean cheese (no preference for it), added two small diced mushrooms (because I had extras), and added an extra egg-white to make sure it wasn't too dry.

My only recommendation is to use a food processor to chop the green bell peppers and onion into fine pieces, otherwise it might be too chunky for some.

WOW!  We have ditched red meat for about 3 years now and my daughter missed meatloaf the most.  This was a fantastic substitute!  I only used about 1/2 the amount of BBQ sauce and used ketchup in place of the other half.

Good, but too much BBQ sauce. Next time, I'll either use half the amount (or even less), or I'll try using gravy instead. Otherwise, good recipe!

Ok, I added additional bread crumbs and an additional eggwhite, I used ketchup.(and it's a good thing I did) however, the outside when done was nicely browned, but the inside ..not so much, it was very TASTY, but it completly falls apart, so I then sliced it into individual slices and put it back in the oven to crisp them up, I will make this recipe again. but this time, I will NOT use a loaf pan, I will make individual slices from the get go add some oil to the roasting pan, then cook...also, I needed to leave it in the oven much longer then the cook time says, Oh, and if u do use a loaf pan, make sure you grease that sucker up good, I only gave 4 stars because of presentation not taste. it does taste quite good, but I was trying to go for a nice solid loaf, this would also be great for meatballs!

This turned out like mush. It never set, even after baking 10 extra minutes. It also was not enough to fill the pan. Otherwise it tastes good.

This was tasty, but it did not set very well for me.  I would advise to switch the bbq sauce for ketchup as the bbq sauce was too overpowering in my opinion.  Also, it may be useful to put the veg crumbles into a food processor to make finer crumbles.

I really enjoyed this! I used Ketchup instead of BBQ sauce just because that's how I had it growing up. I also used Boca vegan patties instead of the crumbles. I also used a half cup of shredded mozzarella instead of parmesan.

2 hours later and it still has not set up!!!! I have made many recipes off this site, this is the first failure. I even used less sauce and cooked it on 350 for the first 45 min.. What i tasted was great, to bad its not edible. I'll try again in the future but I might precook the morning star crumbles and bell pepper to remove some of the moisture first and cook it at higher temp.

Mine did not stay together either and so I put the meat on top of half a hamburger bun (the thin ones) and it was sloppy joe like.  Tasted wonderful.  Guess you could say I made lemonade out of lemons.  Its a good taste and that's definitely deserving of some stars.  I did not use bbq sauce, but 
and omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any.  Thanks for sharing!!

Good flavor but you can easily cut the amount of sauce in half. Unlike other reviewers, we had no problems with the loaf staying together.

Thank you for this great recipe!  I am vegetarian (not vegan, yet!) and missed some of those comfort foods I grew up on.  I did change one thing which was that I did not use any BBQ sauce.  Most are far too sweet and I didn't want that kind of flavor. My mom always used tomato sauce so I used an 8 oz. can of organic tomato sauce mixed with 4 oz of organic ketchup.  I used half in the mixture and half on top.  SO delicious!!  I think I'd even use a little more sauce in the mixture though.  I cooked it in the toaster oven at 325 for like 30 minutes then 15 more w/sauce on top.  It didn't come out very firm but it tasted really good. Even my non-veggie boyfriend loved it.  I'd say for a firmer "meat"loaf add a second egg.  Enjoy!!

My first attempt using this recipe produced a rather loose loaf with good, but strong flavor.  I liked it well enough to try again building on the reviews of those that had ventured before me and am very pleased with the latest production. Using the advice of reviewers, I made the following changes.
Used only 6 oz of BBQ sauce (Jack Daniels)
Added one egg
Used a cup to cup and half of croutons/bread stuffing (eyeballed the amount)
Used 1/2 Bell Pepper 
Raised the temperature to 375 for the last 15 minutes 
The result was a loaf that set up nicely and is very tasty.

This recipe made me sooo sad.  Mine looked like the picture when mixed but it came out the texture of chunky baby food.  It did not hold together despite the fact that added half the liquid.  I tried ketchup instead of bbq.  Bbq plus garlic onion and spices it just seemed like too much.  My husband liked the flavors but not the texture.  I couldn't get past the texture.

My whole family really liked this recipe- even my carnivorous- closed minded parents really liked it it turned out a little mushier than I would have liked to see - next time I may add more bread crumbs really good though!

Recipe calls for WAY too much BBQ sauce, and to be honest meatloaf isn't supposed to have BBQ sauce in/on it anyway (eggs make it moist enough, and ketchup should be put on top - that's how they do it in Ohio!). I found this recipe to be too sweet and taste like pure BBQ sauce. Also, the oven timing is way off, needs to be in oven MUCH longer to set - I added about 40 minutes onto the end and it still didn't end up setting until it was refrigerated.

I would probably give this five stars, but I'm not a vegetarian, so I prefer the genuine article. That said, this was very good and both my wife (an aspiring vegetarian) and a guest (a longtime vegetarian) loved this dish. I didn't change a thing.

This dish was excellent! I used Yves ground round vegan crumbles and Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. I added twice the amount of seasoning, plus oregano. I omitted the cheese. I used dry bread crumbs and I didn't use BBQ sauce to top, instead we used ketchup as we needed. Oh the way to get it to set is to cook at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. I cooked it in a rubber bundt pan. It was a beautiful ring loaf!! Very impressive and held up perfectly. I will post pics next time as it was eaten way to fast my family got three helpings!!! Great stuff thanks for the recipe! It is a keeper!  Next time I will make it totally vegan with egg replacer.

I thought this was terrible. The whole bottle of bbq sauce made it sickly sweet and took away the nutricional value of the veggies.

Just made this for dinner, it was yummy.  If you're not a big fan of BBQ sauce, just use ketchup. I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce and the BBQ was still an over powering flavor. I think next time I will just use the Ketchup. This is a very good recipe. It stayed together well and baked nicely. My husband is not a vegetarian but he at it and loved it. I used Morning Star Grillers Crumbles. They are by far the best out there.  Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

this meatloaf was amazing! i did make some modifications though. I substituted most of the ketchup for a smokey bbq sauce and cut the amount of sauce used by almost half. Other than that this is the best faux meatloaf i had since becoming a vegetarian.

This is a great recipe.  It really depends on which BBQ sauce you use...I mixed mine a bit with ketchup so my kids won't complain about it being too spicy.  Extra yummy with creamed corn and mashed potatoes...a nice comfort meal on a cold night..

Yum! Absolutely loved this. I pureed the veggies and added a carrot! My 5 year old and 4 year old ate this and enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was a great substitute to the meatloaf of my childhood. However, the thyme and basil gave it a "twang" that gave a weird after taste. I think the next time I will make it without those two spices.

A great way to please the vegetarians in your house.  It smells as good as it tastes (which is a good thing).  And it was easy to make (major plus for me)!

I suggest not using any barbecue sauce. Made this for dinner and everyone loved it...non-vegetarians, vegetarians,even the kids!  But we all agree it would have been terrible with barbecue sauce...especially a whole bottle! My changes: no barbecue sauce, used 2 eggs instead of 1, used Italian breadcrumbs and skipped the spices (since the breadcrumbs had spice).  Family can't wait for me to make this again! We topped it with ketchup in the last 10 min of baking. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I added one extra egg to see if that would help bind the final loaf, given the reviews.  I also turned the heat to 375 and went for a full sixty minutes.  Also, I tried to eliminate as much moisture by using paper towels to wick liquid from the vegetables: I used onion, red and green peppers, and a small amount of carrots -- all minced. I also chopped the soy crumbles much smaller. I substituted ketchup and used no bbq sauce at all. Given the higher heat and longer time, the bottom did get a little dark (I used spray oil on the metal pan) -- but my family loved it all!  The loaf held together pretty well. Not quite as "tight" as meatloaf but more put-together than several reviewers note. I served it with Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake and broccoli. It's a great recipe - fair amount of work but well worth it!

I substituted tomato sauce (see Allrecipe's "Easy Tomato Sauce" recipe) for the barbeque sauce and only used about 6 ounces. I sauteed the onion and green pepper until fully cooked. This made an excellent vegetarian meatloaf. I will definitely make this recipe again with the above modifications.

Delicious and easy to make. My boyfriend, who is a fairly new vegetarian said meatloaf is a meal he misses... so, for Valentine's day, I made this and he loved it!!!

This was definately interesting.. my very pro-meat bf had asked for meatloaf, and since I dont cook meat this was a compromise. I used the Canadian version of veggie ground that I have access to called "st. yves", it turned out with a nice flavour but I would finely chop the vegetables in the future... I made it with mashed potatoes and beans... I think next time Ill stick with shepherds pie.

I liked the taste of this recipe. It was delicious. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it did not have the consistency of meatloaf - meaning it didn't hold together at all. I will cook this again, but will serve it as sloppy joes.

Excellent alternative to the traditional favorite.  I took the advice of some of the other members and used half ketchup hald bbq sauce to cut down on the tanginess.

This is a favorite in our house and has been served many times. Even my meat eating husband requests it! The only thing I do differently is to only use barbeque sauce for the mixture. I use ketchup for the top instead. It's just too much barbeque for our tastes otherwise.

Delicious! I had never eaten any kind of meatloaf before but my meat-eating fiance loves it.  I tried this and we both truly enjoyed it!!! I added a little ketchup to the bbq sauce, and some cooked rice to make it a little lighter-and I used crumbled boca patties.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  We used a 14 oz tube of Smart Ground Veggie Beef crumbles and Baby Rays bbq sauce.  Probably 4-6 oz of that in the mix and half ketchup and bbq sauce on top.  We also cooked it at 350.  We used a spicy bbq sauce on top as we ran out of the Rays.  We followed the rest of the recipe.    In our family some loved it, some liked, and one of our kids didn't like it, but it he ate it all and left his mashed potatoes, so I'm guessing he liked it.    As a vegetarian this is something we haven't tried before, but everything about it was great for a cold winter night.  Definitely will do again.

Awesome! My meat loving husband and step-father gave this rave reviews yesterday! I agree with those who thought the barbecue sauce on the top was a little overwhelming, I'll probably only use 1/2 next time. Added about a cup of corn and a few ounces of diced cheddar cheese to punch it up. Overall, just a really yummy, really easy, relatively healthy dish that will definitely become a staple in my kitchen!

LOOOOVED IT! But made it with ketchup after reading varying reviews of BBQ sauce use. Made it for a potluck. Some people didn't see the "vegetarian" sign and were surprised when I told them it wasn't real meat. I had to cook it for an extra 20 mins for it to set properly, though.

Wow, my experience didn't mesh with the other high ratings given to this. I used Morningstar Farms crumbles and Sweet Baby Ray's for the BBQ sauce. I used a different recipe for the topping, because I happen to prefer it. The loaf tasted fairly good, but it never set. If I baked it any longer, the topping would have started to dry out. So, it had a mushy consistency. The loaf was 5x9 (like the pan) but not even an inch thick, which was also strange. Yes, I used soft bread crumbs (not dry) and all of the other ingredients.

I cut the BBQ sauce in this recipe in half- putting 6 oz. in the meatloaf.  I then topped the meatloaf with ketchup.  I also left out the parmesan cheese, which cuts down on the fat content a little bit.  It turned out to be a very tasty dish!

Believe all those reviews that say this meatloaf doesn't "set". It LOOKED great! but we had to spoon it out of the baking dish - has the consistency of dog food. It willl only taste like meat to you if it's been a long time since you had meat.

Just made this meatloaf tonight and we love it!!! I did made a few adjustment on the recipe. I used 2 egg replacer, extra parm and extra bread crumbs. The meatloaf stayed intact. If you want it extra crisp on the outside, you may want to cut it  into loaves and pan fry it just like the other review said. And I only use half of the ketchup. I do suggest read the reviews, it does help you on what to do with your meatloaf. Thanks for the recipe!!

I was disapointed with this.  The loaf did not stay together in dense slices like I was used to with other meatloaves.  I did use homemade bread crumbs instead of really dry bread crumbs.  Other than that I don't think I did anything wrong.

Please make sure that, if you really want a 'vegetarian' dish, make sure that the Parmesan is actually vegetarian (MOST CHEESES ARE NOT VEGETARIAN). That aside, this wasn't too bad with a few substitutes (I used reconstituted TVP instead of the more expensive crumbles), left out the parmemsan, and bell pepper (nothing wrong w/bell pepper - I don't care for it :).

VERY disappointed... My meat loaf didn't turn into a loaf! It was just a pan full of mush... I even baked it for an extra 45 minutes. If I were to make this recipe again (which I probably wont), I'd probably add more breadcrumbs and/or drain the liquid from mincing the vegetables.   On the other hand, the mush tasted really good.

This was the first culinary failure of 2010 for me.  As many other reviewers, my "meatloaf" never set up.  It remained the consistency of somewhat dry sloppy joes, even after baking an extra 15 minutes.    Perhaps the recipe needs to specify a specific brand of faux crumbles and whether or not the crumbles should be thawed first.  In addition, bbq sauces come in several different consistencies.  Some are very thin (open pit) and some are very thick (chunky style).    Perhaps I would try the recipe again if there were more direction in those couple of areas.

This recipe is great! I have a family of four vegetarians to cook for, two of them are really big guys, so I'm always looking for something hearty, healthy, filling, and easy for me. This recipe will become a regular in our house, but next time I will try what one reviewer suggested and use half ketchup, half the amount of BBQ sauce. I think that will make it better, the BBQ sauce was a little much for myself and for my daughter, although the guys loved it.

Awesome recipe with my own changes of course. No offense to the poster but I do that with every recipe. I used Morningstar Farms crumbles and JD steakhouse BBQ sauce. I basically doubled it with half ketchup and half BBQ sauce. I also followed someone else's suggestion and cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.

The taste was very good.  I used Open Pit bq sauce, which is on the sweet side. The only problem I have is the consistency.  It was really soft and mushy, which was disappointing.

I liked it, but my meat-lover husband didn't like it.  I actually made this recipe twice because the first time I made it I used Boca crumbles and didn't care too much for it.  The second time I used Morningstar Farms crumbles and I thought it was much better-- my hubby still didn't like it, though and made a sandwich for dinner instead. I think it was better the second time around, but I also added some garlic and cumin the second time.  This gets 3 stars because I have a vegetarian meatloaf recipe that I like better and that my husband will actually eat.

I used ketsup rather than bbq sauce, and added applesauce, applesauce spices, chopped apple, and a bit of milk (essentially I made my usual meatloaf recipe, but replaced the meat with meatless ground crumbles--Beyond Meat and Gardein). You should be sure to thaw the meatless ground crumbles before putting this all into the loaf pan, BTW.

Really tasty! I would recommend an extra egg to help hold it together. I've always used ketchup instead of the BBQ and it is great! I've missed meatloaf since I moved in with a vegetarian and this scratches that itch.

You can use any sort of spices you want to change up the the flavor. I often sub some salt for soy sauce and add extra onion. I also add extra veggies (like carrots or mushrooms), but you have to add more wet ingredients if you do.

This came out great! I tweaked this recipe a bit: I used 1/2 bag of crumbles, a cup of mushrooms, one whole onion, and chunks of red, yellow and orange bell pepper. I substituted ketchup and used WAY less than they called for. Everything else was the same as the recipe. I ran the onion, garlic, mushrooms and pepper through a chopper for a smooth consistency. It sets as it cools, so remember to give it time to cool before trying to slice. (I had previously incorrectly assumed that longer baking time would allow it to firm up.) Served with truffled gnocchi and peas for a fancy twist on an old classic.

Very tasty and held up well! I'm the only vegetarian in the house so I scaled down the ingredients and made a small one for my dinner. I didn't use the BBQ sauce and I made a sauce for the top made out of brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard. It made a tasty glaze to the delicious meatloaf.

This was great, but I think I will sub ketchup for the bbq sauce next time.  I miss the more savory taste and it was a bit sweeter than I would have liked.  My 2 year old and vegetarian husband loved it!

The flavor was pretty good, although if you aren't NUTS about bbq sauce you may want to half the mixture with ketchup. I also added 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper for some extra flavor without making your mouth catch fire. I don't know what i did wrong because with the exception of the cayenne I followed the recipe exactly and it still ended up mush. My family ended up eating it like sloppy joes. Maybe if I try this one again I'll use much less sauce.

Edit: (this might be a duplicate... issues editing) Use two eggs and it'll set great! Tasted wonderful. Like most, I used 1/2 - 1/2 ketchup and BBQ in the actual loaf. I only added a few tbsp of BBQ on top after 45 min and baked for another 15-20 min. Never set. I would recommend another binding agent. Maybe some mashed potatoes or flour? Not setting was my only qualm.

I've done this before. Sometime fresh bread soaked in milk and thoughly mixed through makes it hold better. Also, I used Mrs. Dash and italian herb mix in the meatloaf and tomatoe sauce instead or barbeque. Topped and baked with herbed ketchup. Yum!

I couldn’t find the meatless crumbles. So I used veggie patties..  I will try again.  TASTED great. But, way too mucky.  Paired with mashed cauliflower.

Based on the reviews, I made the following modifications. The end result was very tasty and had a good texture. First, I used chopped up Boca burgers (6 patties), because that was what was available. Second, I chopped the pepper and onion fine. Third, I used 1 cup of dry bread crumbs, instead of 1/2 c soft. Fourth, I used 2 eggs instead of 1. Fifth, I used a combination of BBQ and ketchup (using up leftovers) with the ratio weighted toward ketchup. The combo was good, but if I had to choose, I'd go with all ketchup over all BBQ. Sixth, instead of baking in a loaf pan, I baked in a jumbo muffin tin. It made six individual servings. Last, adjusting for the different tin, I baked for 30 minutes at 375, then added the topping sauce and baked another 10 minutes. It held together well and had excellent flavor.

We are veggies that hate how everything that mimics meat, is mushy and soft.  Don't get why meat eaters think this is ok.  Anywho...Double the bake time to get a firm meatloaf.

After years of trying to find a good vegetarian meatloaf, I found it with this one! It is a great substitute for the carnivorous version. I make it regularly. I do use ketchup instead of barbecue sauce, because that was the traditional way I had it growing up. And I leave out the green bell pepper because I just don't like it.

Didn't change anything and it was  good. My very picky husband, who's never had meatloaf of any kind before, enjoyed it.

Wonderful taste, although I made such significant changes that it might be a new recipe. Omitted the onion due to allergy to it. Omitted barbecue sauce as other reviewers suggested and substituted less ketchup. Omitted green pepper and substituted celery stick. Used 4 sautéed garlic cloves. Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup kale. Added extra egg. Patted into thin layer on cookie sheet. Topped with ketchup. Baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Cut into rough squares.

The flavors were good but I think next time I would use a mix of A-1 sauce and ketchup as the BBQ sauce overpowered the other flavors. And also cut the amount of BBQ down; using one whole bottle is A LOT! Next time, I think I will try adding more bread crumbs and another egg to get it to set.

I made this last night and my 14yr old vegetarian daughter loved it and my meat-loving husband thought it was okay. I thought it was pretty good but next time I think I'll leave out the thyme, just personal preference. Other than that, I didn't measure the bell peppers, onions or ketchup (instead of BBQ sauce). I just used the amounts I thought my family would like after reading the reviews of it not setting well. Mine set perfectly in the time according to the recipe. I'm sure I used less ketchup than the BBQ sauce listed but didn't measure. I will be making this again without the thyme. Yum!

After over a year of being vegetarian, I am so happy to find a recipe to replace my hamburger meatloaf! I substituted out the egg with 1Tbsp cornstarch + 2Tbsp water and it came out perfect. Next time, I will do half BBQ sauce, half ketchup, so it's a little closer to my old recipe.

We absolutely loved this recipe. We used Boca brand veggie crumbles and famous daves sweet and tangy bbq sauce. We've already made it a second time!

The flavor is good, but I would use less BBQ sauce next time, and it crumbled even after an extra 20 minutes of cooking.  That is not good, which is why I gave it 3 stars... I will try it again and hopefully find the error in my ways.

This is one of my favorite meat-substitute recipes! I don't make a lot of "sub" recipes, but this one is just perfect. The only thing is that you don't need a whole bottle of bbq sauce. The mixture is pretty wet as it is before the sauce, but the flavor it adds is incredible. This doesn't hold it's form well like traditional meatloaf, but it's still delicious!

This was delicious! It didn't turn out as a firm loaf; it was more like a casserole but I rate it on how it tastes, not how it looks. This is a wonderful vegetarian dish that I'll definitely be making again.

Perhaps it was just my interp of the recipe, but I would add more bread, less green pepper, and switch out the bbq sauce for catsup next time  around.

This recipe is a keeper. My kids loved it. I just made a few adjustments I used half the amount of bbq sauce and replaced it with ketchup. I also added alot more veggies
