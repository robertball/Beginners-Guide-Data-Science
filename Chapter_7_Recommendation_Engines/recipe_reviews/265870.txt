Be sure to let this sit for 5-10 minutes after mixing.  The alternative flour blend needs time to absorb moisture and it will bring the texture to a scoop-able dough (you won't be able to pick this up and roll it).  I used a large cookie/cupcake scoop to make mounds on a parchment-lined cookie sheet.  These were light and fluffy and full of flavor!  I created an "everything bagel" flavored version and they were DELICIOUS.

They tasted wonderful but mine were full of air holes.  Not sure where I went wrong. But great to use as burger buns when grilling.
