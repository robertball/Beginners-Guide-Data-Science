There are a couple of "secrets" to making the perfect gooey Rice Krispie Treats:  (1) the stovetop is THE way to go (the pan washes out easy w/hot soapy water) (2) you HAVE to melt the butter sloooowly and make sure it doesn't turn brown at all.  (3) mix in the marshmallows and melt them just as slowly. If the butter gets brown, the treats will be dry.  We double our recipe and it still fits fine into a 13x9 pan (grease the pan w/butter).  To make them truly gooey use the following measurements: 11.5 cups Rice Krispies, 1 whole stick of butter, (1) 16oz bag of mini marshmallows. (I always use Jet Puff brand).  I've become the neighborhood "treat" maker because the neighbors say theirs never turn out like mine.

These are great!! I went a little crazy throwing stuff into them, lol. I added a few chocolate chips I had left from another recipe, a couple Hershey bars broken up, and a big spoonful of peanut butter. Yum! I didn't butter the pan, I used cooking spray. Another helpful tip, if you spray your hands with the cooking spray, you can press them into the pan without getting all sticky!

Who doesn't like these? Heck, even the major coffee shops carry these in their bakeries, and charge too much for them too! I vary the measurements slightly (1/4 c. butter, 50 regular marhmallows or 5 c. miniature marshmallows, 6 c. Rice Krispies) but the result is the same--ooey, gooey good! I like them thicker, so I make them in a buttered 9x9" pan. For extra decadence I often melt an 11 oz. package of milk chocolate chips and spread them over the top. Absolutely out of this world!

This is a basic easy recipe. Pretty much the same as all the other Rice Krispies recipes. The reason why this one is getting 2 stars is because YOU CANNOT SUB MARSHMALLOW CREME, your treats will NEVER set up. I have faithfully tried this recipe 2 times with Marshmallow creme and each time they NEVER set up, you have to eat them with a spoon. Needless to say I have wasted time and ingredients, and I have come to the conclusion that you just can't sub marshmallow creme. I have no idea why this lady is suggesting this to you because it will not work, maybe she never tried it but it just dosen't work. USE REGULAR MARSHMALLOWS!

Great Recipe! I of course added my own spin to it ;). I used the same measurements for the butter, marshmallows, and rice cereal. However, I added a capful of milk, splash of vanilla, heaping spoon of peanut butter, and then to crown it off some peanut butter m&m's!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING. I aslo used the microwave suggestion....excellent. I would suggest either using a smaller pan though or doubling the batch as others suggested. Have fun with this classic recipe!

This can easily be done in a big microwave safe bowl in the microwave. Melt butter for 30 seconds. Add marshmallos , cook on high for 45 seconds, stir and then add the crispies. I also like to add a big spoonful of crunchy peanut butter to the marshmallow butter mixture-then continue as before-delish!

This recipe was great!  I used non-colored rice crispies, then as the marshmallow was melting I added red food coloring to it.  I also laid them out on the pan a little thinner than instructed.  Once they were dry, I cut them into heart shapes, and put two hearts together with peanut butter in the middle for a little "marshmallow sandwich".  They are adorable and taste great!  Plus, they are pink for Valentine's Day!

This is a very standard recipe, but definetly a good one! I usually use marshmallows over the creme. At easter, we use a lamb mold and fill it with the rice krispy mixture. One great tip is to wet your hands before transferring the rice crispy treats to the pan. it prevents a lot of sticking and mess. Use can also add 2/3 cup peanut butter to the melted butter and marshmallow. Yum!

So good! I scaled this to make 36 servings (I had a 10.5 oz minimarshmallow bag=6cups mini marshmallows). Per other reviewers, I added 2 tsp milk, 1 tsp vanilla (added a little before marshmallows were fully melted) and this really made it!!! Oh, and 7 1/2 cups of cereal along with the marshmallow mixture was NOT going to fit into my saucepan. So, I put the cereal in a large metal bowl, and poured the melted marshmallow mixture over it, mixed and voila! Put it in an 11 x 7 and forced myself to clean up so I didn't go and eat the whole thing at once!

Awesome. I usually just use a 10.5 oz bag of mini marshmallows. I don't butter my pan or utensils, I just spray with buttered flavored cooking spray. We love these.

Rice crispie treats....loved these when I was a kid.  Now I add milk chocolate chips or M-n-M's to them.  The kids love it (and adults do too.)  Thanks for the post.

These are great but a few tips, if you want the gooiest most marshmallowiest rice krispies then use 5 cups marshmallows and 5 cups rice krispies.  It makes the sweetest, gooiest treats in the world! Another tip is when you're evening out the treats in a pan, you can just wet your hands (don't dry them) and press it down that way! They don't stick at all!  This is a great recipe and whenever I want to make these treats, I always use this recipie!  I love it!

Used 1 stick butter, 1 box (12 oz) rice krispies, and 1 large bag jet puff and followed directions exactly, melting butter and marsh slowly -  turned out great as others have said. Using these same proportions and directions I have found that you can use (and kids of all ages LOVE) different cereals (i.e. reeses, oreos, etc.).

I made Christmas Trees out of this batch. I got about 10 using a 3.5 tree cookie cutter. Follow directions as is, don't forget to butter a 9X13 pan, press the rice crispies down "firmly" with "buttered hands", place in the refridgerator for about 15-20 minutes. You should get 7 trees first, then you need to take the leftover rice crispie, press firmly together, until you reach as many trees as you can get. I placed them back in the refridgerator for another 20 minutes, heating  up white premier chocolate morsals, then dipped only 1 side of each tree, immediately decorate each one as you go by. Place back in the refridgerator so the chocolate can firm up. Place in holiday cello wrap/ribbon. All set! I added a picture so you can see the final result. Picture #49

Perfect! it's a normal bag of the big marshmallows if you get the bigger size. I switched up 2 cups with golden grahams to give it a change.

Great! FYI: One 12 oz box comes out to a little over 11 cups. I used the whole box, 1 stick of butter, and one whole bag of mini marshmallows. I like mine the old-school way so I didn't add anything extra.

I have used this for Popcorn Balls as well. Just substitute the cereal with popped corn. And you can add food coloring or flavoring to the butter & marshmallows. Then just form into balls with greased hands. You will probably want to double or triple the recipe. Much tastier than the Karo syrup kind!

Great basic recipe for krispy bars! You can add in anything you want, or change the cereal to chocolate or fruity krispies... This recipe in a 9x13 pan makes bars less than an inch thick. If you're wanting really thick bars, a 9x13 pan could easily hold a double recipe.

Good ratios and easy to follow directions...however, use a smaller pan unless you want thin bars. I used a 8X8 and it was just full.

Double the recipe and after putting it in the pan quickly while the mixture is still hot but spread across the 9x13 pan sprinke with about 2 cups of mini m & ms.  Or sprinkle with a combination of milk chocolate morsels and white chocolate morsels.  Press them firmly into the rice crispy mixture and let cool....cheap, easy, and very yummie...kids love it.

Very good, but I didn't give this 5 stars because I actually think it needs more marshmallow. I like my treats chewy, while I will definitely try this recipe again I will add about 2 cups more marshmallow.

Gotta love a classic!  Although, I have to disagree with the suggestion of also being able to use marshmallow creme.  Tried that in college and it never hardened up.  The marshmallow creme stayed creamy so it made for gooey, drippy, limp marshmallow treats.

These are super easy to make. I used marshmallow fluff instead of marshmallows, and changed my proportions to 5cups fluff & 6 1/4 cups of cereal. I probably could have added more cereal, there seemed to be more fluff then cereal! :) I also thought about adding in some peanut butter when you melt the fluff...next time!

I used the tips by other viewers (added 2 1/2 tsp milk, 16 oz mini marshmallows, 1/8 tsp vanilla) only thing is i used 9 cups of rice cereal :) DELICIOUS!!! Huge hit @ wrk. Thank you for this recipe!! Note: I cooked these on low heat & stirred the butter until it was entirely melted as well as the Marshmallows and when they were almost melted added the milk (like the suggestion)w/ the rice i added little by little waiting until the rice was entirely coated then added more. mind u i stirred from beginning to end :) The damp hands for transfer....AWESOME heads up!!!

This is the basic recipe, nothing extraordinairy.. but delicious none the less!  I use 40 large marshmallows, 5.5-6 cups of krispies and 1/4 cup butter. A splash of vanilla extract is also lovely.

I added vanilla  and pink die.  Thank you "makeiteasy4me".  I have always made hard as rock crispy treats but with your tips this was awsome.  Cook everything on low low low and just be patient for the ingredients to melt.

Not to be over-dramatic, but I just made the best batch of Rice Krispie Treats that I've ever made in my 40 years!  I followed the tips of the first reviewer and warmed everything slowly on the stove top.  I also also added a couple teaspoons of milk to make it creamy.  Simplicity never tasted so good!

A classic childhood treat!  I added a splash of vanilla.  I prefer to make these on the stove as well, the marshmallows seems to melt better that way.  I put orange coloring in the marshmallows, shaped into balls, and added tootsie rolls stems and green icing leaves for the fall.  Cute and festive!

Great basic recipe that you can add your own twist to. For anyone that is using homemade marshmallows you will want to use 8oz of marshmallows.  I also like using a smaller pan as I like the treats thicker then what this one will turn out to be.

These were great. Instead of the traditional peanut butter or chocolate chip, however, I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. It was a slightly different taste but completely delicious. My recipe was as follows:    1/4 cup butter  1 tbs milk  2 tsp vanilla  1/4 tsp cinnamon  1/8 tsp nutmeg  4 cups mini marshmellows  5 cups rice crisp cereal    I also used the microwave method and they came out perfectly.

Very easy to make, and rave reviews from my taste testers.  I doubled the recipe...used 1 stick butter, 1 16 oz bag of mini marshmallows, and 11 cups of cereal.  I found that I think they come out better if you press them into a greased 10x15 jellyroll pan instead of a 13x9.  Using a 13x9 made them too thick.  I made three batches last night...one with plain Rice Krispies, one with Cocoa Pebbles that I topped with mini chocolate chips, and one batch of Fruity Pebbles.  They're all great!

I made these with Cheerios rather than the Rice Krispies and added a little bit of vanilla extract (about 1 Tbsp) for a 4th of July family party.  Hubby tried a few out (lol) and LOVED them!!!

Ooey and gooey.  Oil the pan to keep from sticking and oil your hand to push the treat into the pan.  Never gonna buy this again.  I will always be making it.  Thanks for the formula.

I don't understand why mine came out super hard! First I thought that maybe the cereal was stale , but that wasn't it. Does anybody know what could have caused this? It hurt my jaw just chewing them!

I needed to make a birthday "cake" for a 4-year-old who doesn't like cake.  This was a fantastic solution.  I put the rice krispy treat into a jelly roll pan, cut 5 inch circles and layered them with pink icing as I would a cake.  I even was able to make a rice krispy dress for a 4 inch princess figure and iced it white.  My granddaughter was thrilled!  And of course she ate the princess piece and then gave the toy a bath before she played with it.  

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe for a creative alternative for a fun birthday cake.  I'll do it again for sure.  I've posted photos #83 and #84 on this site.

These are incredible!  I have never made rice krispy treat before, and now I may never buy the packaged ones again.  I made a couple additions after reading the reviews - 2 tsp. milk and 1 tsp. vanilla, added at the point where the marshmallows are almost completely melted.  I also added an extra cup of marshmallows because I like them extra gooey.  This will be a hit when the kids get home from school, I doubt there will be any left tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good!! Way better than the original rice krispies recipe! Even my parents who think rice krispies taste like cardboard thought they were great!Oh and here is a tip: I lay out some wax paper and then just press the treats into whatever shape/ thickness I want, it makes clean up a lot easier because as soon as I'm done cutting up the  treats, I just wrap them and store them  in the wax paper.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  The off brand cereal and marshmallow package usually don't carry the recipes so this is a nice reference.  I also add a teaspoon or so of vanilla to the melted marshmallow/butter mixture before adding the rice krispies.  Then I top with various sprinkles after pressing in the pan to give it a festive appearance.

Yum yum yum!!  These were great!!  I made several batches of these for my Christmas dessert platters, and they were definitely a hit.  I upped the mini marshmallows to 5 c and the cereal to 6 c...I followed another reviewers suggestion of adding a capful of milk to the melted marshmallows before the cereal is mixed in.  I also drizzled some red and green candy melts over the top before cutting for decoration. They looked so festive! :~)

I made 2 batches just as told and didnt change a thing.I added green food coloring to the marshmellow of one batch after it was melted in the pan,then after it was all put together and done cooling,i used Christmas tree cookie cutters to make Christmas trees.I sprayed cookie cutters with cooking spray before cutting so it wouldn't stick.The other batch i left white and used snowflake cookie cutters.It worked really well and looked nice for my daughters Christmas concert class.

I think I needed to pack the marshmallows in the cup, because they weren't quite gooey enough. I also added 1 t. vanilla.

Delicious! I recommend melting the butter very slowly, as well as melting the marshmallows very slowly.  This recipe makes a very thin layer in a 9 x 13 pan, You should double if you like thicker treats.

I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  These are great!  Makes the store bought ones taste like cardboard.  And pretty good on the calories also!

A trick I've been using lately to press them: take a hand-sized piece of plastic wrap and spray one side with Pam.  Use it to press them..nothing sticks. I used Kraft cinnamon bun marshmallows and they were great..I also mixed in coconut -flavored m&ms.  Both the cinnamon and coconut flavors were mild.  Everyone loves them!  I also use 6 cups of marshmallows and they are still a little gooey and yummy.  To get a good height on the bars you need to use a smaller pan or use 1.5 times the recipe....

I had leftover marshmallows from a campfire roast and wanted to make these.  I couldn't find the recipe anywhere (on the marshmallow bag or cereal box) and I knew I could come to Allrecipes to find it.  This recipe turned out great and tastes just like what I remember from childhood.  Thanks for posting this here.

Added a bit of milk to the melted marshmallows and they turned out perfect. Next time I'm going to try adding M&M's.

The original recipe was good but, whoever suggested adding milk, bleech. Since I add a bit more marshmallow and cereal to the original they came out stiff. My niece suggested the milk to make them "creamy" (like another reviewer said). They came out loose and not very marshmallowy - infact, they won't really hold together.  All I can say is I'm happy that these are being given to the 4 & 6 yr olds that made them.

Seriously amazing. Super easy to make and quite delicious. I increased the recipe to 5 cups of marshmallows to 6 cups of rice krispies and only 2 tablespoons of butter, just because 1/4 cup was just too much and because it would fill a little more into my 9x13 in baking dish. It filled about half way up my 9x13x3in pan. I had to throw in a cup of marshmallows and a big handful of chocolate chips after adding the rice krispies!! So delicious! I also added a tiny splash of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of milk to the melted marshmallows. I've tried a batch with the milk and another without. They both taste the same to me as well a their textures. This treat has a nice chew to it. It's light, airy, crispy, sweet & chewy. I made 3 batches already since I found this recipe like 2 days ago and I plan on making many more for my neighbors and friends! But seriously, once you eat one, you're hooked! This recipe has worked EVERYTIME. I honestly don't know how you can fail this recipe. Thank you so much!! Simply amazing.

I made mine according to another's tip of using a whole stick of butter, 16 oz. marshmallows, and 11 1/2 cups of crispy cereal and it turned out beautifully with nice thick treats which is how I prefer them.

I actually followed the measurements from first review. They turned out awesome but after trying them the next day the crispies were stale. I froze them since they are for 140 guests and I needed to make them ahead. I believe I had stale (no brand) rice cereal to begin with. I have been struggling to decide to serve them or not. I read that you can "save" your stale crispies by putting them in the oven. I tried it and it gave it a crunchy almost carmel like coating on the outside. If you take them directly out of the freezer and put them in the oven at 350 for 3 min you can improve the crispies by 50% I would say. They turned out pretty good so I am going to serve them at the party.

I made this using another users suggestions:  To make them truly gooey use the following measurements: 11.5 cups Rice Krispies, 1 whole stick of butter, (1) 16oz bag of mini marshmallows. (I always use Jet Puff brand).  They were awesome!  I will be making it many more times!  I decorated them with the icing found in "Sugar Cookie Icing" and they turned out great.

I'm not sure what went wrong here as I followed the recipe exactly.  I sprayed my hands with vegetable oil as suggested, but I still couldn't keep marshmallow off of them.  The treats were impossible to cut as they completely stuck to the knife and NOT to the pan.  I will just pay the extra money for the pre-made ones form the store.

These were so good and gooey. My kids and I couldn't stop eating them and they were a hit our cookout. I followed the tips some of the others suggested and ended up using the whole bag of marshmallows and rice krispies with a whole stick of butter. Which was great so I didn't have half a bag of marshmallows hanging around in the cabinet. Thanks for sharing will be making this alot this summer.

Yummy! If using a 9x13, I recommend to double the recipe. I thought mine were a little flat but still really good though. Next time I'm trying coconut marshmallows!

I made a double-portion and it turned out really good. One thing was weird though: there are some crispies that are really crunchy. Overall delish.

Good stuff. I doubled the recipe. I used a full 16 oz bag of mini marshmallows, a full stick of butter, and lost count of how much cereal because I kept having kids come up and talk to me, so I just poured it in about a cup at a time until the consistency looked right. I also added two big spoonfuls of chunky peanut butter, a tablespoon and a half of milk, a couple teaspoons of vanilla, half a bag of milk chocolate chips, and half a bag of Heath Toffee chips. I also used the microwave method that was suggested, but needed to cook the mixture a full minute longer than recommended. No big deal, though. I used a cookie sheet, lined with waxed paper, and just pressed the mixture to the thickness I wanted them to be. Tasty and fast!

I like add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to make them taste even better!!  My Grandmother used to make these all the time when we went to visit her.

These ones actually worked for me! Definitely cook them over an oven and make sure its really on a LOW heat. Like, ridiculously low even, otherwise the marshmellows will automatically burn when you put them in.

Followed makeiteasy4me's advice (first review on recipe page) and it worked like a charm. I added mini colored ball sprinkles after I started stirring in the rice krispies, cut them out in the shape of a star and used a lollipop stick to create a fun "magic wand" for my daughter's princess party. Yummy and adorable. Thanks!

I made this exactly as the recipe was written, except I put them in a 9 X 9 inch pan because we like them thicker.  Also, I did not press them down in the pan.  They were delicious, but I would have preferred more marshmallow. The next time, I will add an extra cup or two.

Another tip for those of you who say your treats go hard.  When butter sets up it gets hard.  Right?  Use the soft tub butter. It never gets hard.  Works great and your treats will never be hard again.  I promise!

I used marshmellow cream because I needed something kosher for my jewish youth group. It worked great because when it melted, it was uber sticky and was easy to press down even without a buttered spatula. I'm so pleased. It's a little grainy before it melts, but it's fine once its in there with the butter. I also used vanalla like others suggested. I love it! I hope the kids save me a piece!

Basic goodness.  Added splash of vanilla extract with the marshmellows and then some PB M&M's along with the cereal.  

I also have the idea of using 1/2c rice crispies & 1/2c cocoa pebbles.  Then along with the marshmellow to add 1/3c to 1/2c of Nutella.

This is always a satisfying sweet treat. I was craving a chocolate snack, so I melted 1 (1 oz) square of unsweetened chocolate in with the butter (used only 2 tablespoons to cut down on the fat).

So good!  The key to making sure they don't turn out hard as rocks is to take them off the heat when marshmallows are about half way done melting. I always use the regular size bigger marshmallows, not the mini.  I swear the mini mallows cook to quick or something, because they never turn out as soft when I use the minis. Then just stir off heat the rest of the way until melted fully.  I even leave a few clumps in when pouring in the cereal. They will be so soft this way :)

This was my first time making crispy treats and they turned out soft and delicious. I've always been turned off because most are hard, I'm so glad I gave this recipe a try! I'm going to be making a few batches later this week for my daughter's class for a spring treat.

Great recipe.  I added an extra tablespoon of butter and used heaping cups of the mini marshmallows so that it would be more gooey.  That tweak definitely did NOT make it TOO gooey; in fact, I may lean even more gooey next time. :)  I think the part of the instructions that said to keep heating it for a minute or so once it's melted was great instruction.  Seemed to really bring out the buttery and sweet flavor.  And of course, the warning to not brown the butter was a good reminder that kept me on my toes to watch that temp and stir like a mad woman.  ;)

Excellent. Especially after reading others tips. I used 1/4 cup butter, 5 cups mini marshmallows, 6 cups Rice Krispies and added 2 1/2 tsp. milk when marshmallows were almost done melting. Came out perfect! The only thing I would add is cook everything on super low and slow UNTIL you have removed from heat and are adding cereal, then stir quick!!!

Since marshmallows contain animal gelatin, I use marshmallow creme or fluff from a jar instead.  Follow this recipe but substitute a 13.5 oz. jar of creme/fluff and cook on the stove for a full five minutes (cooking will make the marshmallow creme/fluff chewier in the end).  I also reduce the butter/margarine to 3 tablespoons as I find them too greasy otherwise.

Absolutely delightful! I used 6 cups of Cocoa Krispies, 1 bag Jet Puffed Chocolate Royal Marshmallows, 1 cup Jet Puffed Regular Marshmallows, and 1/4 cup butter. I had a medium sized pot, none bigger, so I poured the mixture into a large mixing bowl and mixed. I used an 8x8 pan because I like super thick treats, but cut them smaller. This was super, duper good and I can't wait to make more. I may make the recipe straight next time with the addition of a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I have eaten 4 and I need to stop for dinner but I don't want to it's so good. Very good recipe and please, please read the reviews because the tips are amazing. I grabbed the tips of melting the butter super slow, so I turned the burner on simmer, or warm, and allowed the butter to melt super slow. I then added the marshmallows and turned the burner up a bit to low and added two tablespoons of milk. Really gooey and the best I have ever made.

So good as others have stated.  I added 2 TBL of maple syrup to mine....OooooH MY GOODNESS,  they were so rich and gooey.  
Also pressing them down with a piece of waxed paper makes it really easy to spread them out in the pan.

EASTER VERSION: I used one stick of butter, 1 10.5 oz bag of marshmallows, 4 cups of rice krispies, and 1 6 oz bag of chow mein noodles. Melted the butter, added the marshmallows and melted, then added the rice krispies and chow mein noodles. I lightly buttered a 24 mini muffin pan. Scooped about 1 heaping teaspoon of mixture into each mini muffin. Pressed in the middle with my thumb, added two candy robin's eggs or jellybeans. pressed each one with the palm of my hand, let cool and then removed with a knife tip. I made these for tomorrow-my little nieces and nephews will love them.

For some reason, my Treats didn't turn out as sweet as I expected.  I'm not sure if I'd have needed to use more marshmallows or less crispy rice?  ... I'll try the 'more marshmallows' first, next time.

I have used this recipe for years, using one bag of mini marshmallows and 6 cups of cereal.  This year I substituted the new pink peppermint marshmallows for a different taste.

I made this for Christmas dessert for the kids and they LOVED it! I took advice from different members and I let the butter and marshmallows melt very slowly while I stirred constantly. Then just as it started to really melt I added 2 tbsp milk (for gooniess factor) and then added the rice krispies. I added M&Ms to the top and wrote merry xmas on it which the kids (and adults!) loved.

I made mine using 1/2 plain and 1/2 chocolate krispies. Added milk choc. chips and peanuts. My version of Rocky Road treats. Even the people in my family that don't like krispie treats, love these.

Yum-mo! Thanks, makeiteasy4me, for your helpful suggestions! I followed your recipe, but added some Kraft Jet-Puffed Funmallows Miniature Marshmellows along with the regular marshmellows, and my treats tasted yummy and more flavorful!

Very good and simple recipe by itself.
If you want something different and festive try doubling the batch and adding a 3 oz package of any flavor jello after marshmallows melt. Then stir in rice cereal like normal.
Also, dont dirty a pan. Just plop the mixture onto a sheet of wax paper, butter your fingers and shape with your hands. It's simple to do, quick, and will make cutting the treats into bars much easier/neater. plus you dont have to clean up a pan.

Love the treats!  My easy trick for solving the only downside to these treats is for cleaning up the pot. After making the treats and leaving them to cool, I roll up my sleeves to clean up that sticky pot and spoon! I put in a dose of vinegar ( any kind), and a squirt of dish soup into the pot on top of the burner ( turn up to high) I then add hot water from my tea kettle.  The acid unsticks the remainders ( like deglazing does) and I stir the pot with the sticky wooden spoon I use.  As soon as it comes to a boil- I shut it all off- and leave it to cool. All it takes is a short rinse under the faucet!

I doubled the ingredients, but I didn't change the ratios. I also added 2 tsp milk to the marshmallows just before adding the cereal as some reviewers said. This filled a 9 x 13 dish perfectly. They were the best I have ever made.

Very close to the original, just a cup off the rice cereal.  I preferred this a bit more since it's more gooey.  Today, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp cocoa powder to the marshmallow treats as they melted.  Then I added half Rice Krispies and half Cocoa Krispies and some chocolate chips.  To die for!!  Use wax paper - never sticks for me.  Put the pan in HOT water after and clean-up is a breeze!!

Really simple to make!  I followed the reviewer's advice of melting the butter and marshmallows slowly to prevent browning.  I noticed that the rice krispies were thinner than I had expected using the original ingredient quantities.  So I would suggest either upping the ingredient quantities by 1.5 or using a smaller pan to make the krispies more thick.

Great recipe, perfect ratio of ingredients.  My husband and I can't stop eating them!  I also tried it with marshmallow creme but it didn't set up and only fell apart when I tried to lift pieces out of the pan, so I don't recommend it.  Stick with marshmallows when making this recipe!

Even more perfect with M&M's!  I doubled the recipe for 9 x 13 pan to make them thicker and used the following measurements:  1 stick unsalted butter, 16 oz bag mini marshmallows, 10 cups Krispies. The key is to melt the butter and then the marshmallows VERY slowly.  Don't let it brown or get too hot.  Should NOT be bubbling.  Stir constantly. Once you've pretty well mixed in the Krispies, add FROZEN M&M's.  If you time this right, they will not melt and will mix in perfectly.  Add as little or as many as you like!  Yummer!

great recipe! for this recipe I recommend doubling this recipe for a 13x9 pan. Also be sure to add 2 1/2 tsp. of milk it makes these so gooey... I have made this recipe once before and doubled the recipe with out adding the milk and they were way to dry..trust me the milk does wonders!

I've never made homemade rice krispy treats before and I followed the directions to the letter but mine turned out tasting almost stale so I double checked the cereal and it was fresh so any suggestions as to how to make them not taste stale.  I gave the recipe five stars because it was really easy and my boyfriend didn't think there was anything wrong with them...so maybe this is how they're supposed to be and everyone else is just using the term "gooey" instead?

These treats are absolutely WONDERFUL. I always melt the butter, followed by the marshmallows, on the lowest possible heat; the treats will come out super gooey and absolutely delicious if you do so. I always double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan - everything fits perfectly!

This is the real thing - simple, classic, Rice Krispie squares. You can't go wrong with this recipe. I DID add another cup of Rice Krispies to mine because I don't like tons and tons of marshmallows, but it's really up to you how crunchy you like yours.

I love rice krispie treats! This is pretty much the standard recipe. I just wanted to comment because I followed a previous suggestion, where it says to add milk after the marshmallows are melted, I did this and my treats aren't sticky at all!! They aren't sticking together, and aren't cut-able. We will have to enjoy them with a spoon. The flavor is nice though, and they are creamier. Just thought I would give everyone a heads up.

Used the same measurements but added a big sccop of p-nut butter and 1/2 C butterscotch chips to this. Divided the recipe in two and placed a layer of melted choc chips between the two layers. They are fabulous!!

These are much better than store bought! This is only my second time making rice crispy treats and I followed the advice of a member named Katelyn. Adding the 2 1/2 teaspoons of milk when the marshmellows are almost melted, really does make them creamy. I think I will do that from now on!

Yum! I was unsure about how these treats would come out so I cut the recipe in half. About 30 minutes later I ended up making another batch. Yes! It's that good! I will never go back to eating those packaged Rice Krispie treats! Yuck!   

However, I would cut down on the butter and put more marshmallows. =) 

Also, I added a small splash of milk to the melted marshmallows to give it a more "gooey" texture. 

I'll definitely be making this again!! Thanks!

I love marshmallow treats! The only change I made to the recipe was that I used Smart Balance Light butter instead of real butter because it's healthier. It still tastes the same as real butter though.

This is a standard rice crispy treat recipe with lots of potential.  I warmed up some ready made chocolate frosting and drizzled it over the top of my marshmallow treats.  In the future, I might add chocolate candies or butterscotch chips, but they're fine without those too.  Also, I like my marshmallow treats a little thicker, so I didn't quite fill up a 13 X 9 pan.

This is a good start, and usually Allrecipes is my go to for any recipe but, I wanted a little more flavor so, I did some research. Once upon a chef lady, Brown's the butter, ads some salt and vanilla extract and these treats turn out so Flavorful!
Browning the butter adds some Amazing flavor to these!
I use a silicone spatula to press it into a casserole dish then, when it's cool, invert it onto a cutting board and cut it into squares.
The box of rice crispies that I had from Aldi, had smore rice, m&m, and peanut butter rice crispy squares!
I've made peanut butter before and they're tasty!
They're Also great with coco crispys!!

Excellent basic recipe that can be easily adapted with add-ins, flavors, colors, or other kinds of cereal.  I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter and then dipped the top of the treats in melted chocolate before sprinkling with sprinkles for Valentine's Day.

This is a great recipe. I used 1/2 cup of butter melted slooowly, and I added, 2 bags of miniature marshmallows, stirring constantly. As they were about melted, I stirred in 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, along with 1 tablespoon full of milk. Removed from heat and stirred in 10 cups of cereal and mixed quickly dumping into a lightly greased 9"X 13" cake pan. Cooled for about 30 minutes. Cut and serve. Awesome!!!

Great basic recipe. I make these treats all the time! To the reviewer who says she can't sub marshmallow creme & this recipe recommendation is wrong, go to the rice krispy website. Even the manufacturer says sub marshmallow creme. I believe the secret to success with the substitution is to warm the marshmallow creme til it is more like the marshmallow/butter mixture, reduce or omit butter, increase cereal amount til they hold together. (The amount of recommended marshmallow creme is 7 ounces!Measurements matter here.) Press mixture firmly in the pan & cool. This should resolve the problem. I make these treats as written and, at other times, with additions for variety. Chocolate chips, chopped nuts, chopped dried fruit, other types of cereal, peanut butter. Can be topped with microwaved chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, etc. Thanx

I loved these Rice Krispie treats.. I followed the reviewers advice using 1 stick of salted LOL butter, 1 1/2 bags of jet puffed mini marshmallows, 10 cups of Rice Krispies.... adding 1t. vanilla and 1 1/2t. of milk to the marshmallows and butter after melted...using my non stick pot to cook them in.  Press them into a 9x13 pan sprayed lightly with Pam. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! My clients were in LOVE with these!!!

Ok, let's be realistic, no one eats a 2x2" square of rice Krispie treat. Plus, the extra cooking time is superfluous. One standard bag of marshmallow is what you want.

Best marshmallow treats I have ever made! Took advice of taking it loooww and sllloooow. And I used 1.5 bags of leftover smores larger marshmallows not cut up and they melted perfectly. I also used cocoa Krispies--so good. Def. recommend to fully cool.

It's really good and easy to make, however the cereal part is hard and more crunchy than the normal rice krispy treats. I noticed If you let them sit for one day the marshmallow softens them. Other than that it's perfect

Came out pretty good!  I followed advise of other posters and added a little milk vanilla and peanut butter+ peanut butter m&ms!  My hub had a hard day and these were a nice, quick, easy treat (kids had a lot of fun helping with) to lift his spirits.  Never been successful at making these before!  Thanks!!  :)

This a very good recipe.  If you want to kick it up a notch, try adding from 1/4 to 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter.  If you have kids around, you don't have to think about storing them.

I recently found puffed quinoa at the bulk store, and substituted it for 1/4 of the cereal in this recipe. It has no taste, and provides protein! Yummy and safe to take to school for lunches & snacks (no peanut butter).

I have always made these for my egg allergic son.  One of the few treats (marshmallows & Rice Krispies) that does not have egg or peanuts in them.  I had no Idea that people used fluff/ marshmallow creame in them ...   "albumin" AKA egg whites are in Fluff and Marshmallow. 
Always assumed safe  - glad I dodged that bullet! FIVE STARS FOR  ALLERGY AWARENESS!

I melted 1/4 c. butter SLOWLY. I added one 10.5 oz. bag of mini marshmallows and when melted, I added one cap of milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. I added 6 cups rice krispies since 5 seemed too gooey. I put it in a buttered 9x9 pan. I used a buttered ziplock bag to press the treats in the pan. Delicious, thick treats!

Use Cocoa Krispies instead !!! You`ll never go back to the originals LOL.  I prefer these slightly non-gooey so I up the cereal to 6cups and add a bit of vanilla to the melting marshmallows. Here in Costa Rica the locals never had tried rice krispie treats - I am now `expected` to bring them to any party I go to.

Turned out nice and gooey, just how I like them.  I followed advice of others and melted on very low heat, completely melting the butter and marshmallows, I then added 2/3 cup peanut butter and blended that together.  Took off the heat and stirred in 5 cups of rice cereal.  Patted down in a foil lined 9 x 13 pan and let cool.  The result was a blissful gooey treat!

Made these for a party and everyone loved them. I was lucky that I got one. The only thing different that I did was I used crisco butter instead of butter.

This is the fastest, easiest, tastiest recipe you could ever make. If i would have known it was this easy i would have been made it. It is very cheap also. I didn't have marshmellows so I used fluff which was so much easier cause it's already creamy.

Great recipe!  I added 3/4 t. of peppermint extract and red food coloring to the marshmallows.  Then added the rice cereal.  Once cooled I drizzled dark & white chocolate over top.  Perfect peppermint marshmallow treats.

who doesn't like rice crispie treats!? around the winter holidays i add peppermint candy canes.. you can crush them in a ziploc bag with a rolling pin, or food processor if you have one (i used my Ninja and it chopped it up perfectly) if you dont like the crunchy chunks, just crush it into a fine powder... add this AFTER the rice cereal so it doesnt get too melted... and if you leave it a little chunky, the red specks make it festive...  ive also used the little cinnamon red hots, but they can be a little spicy for the kids... oh, i made them once with peppermint extract because i forgot to get candy canes and they were just as good without the color...

These are perfectly simple. I agree with the other reviewers on being patient! Melt the butter and marshmallows slowly on very low heat to get the best results. Also, definitely spray or butter the pan the treats will set in, it helps immensely. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Just like the recipe on the Krispies box. Please, please, please--do NOT try to substitute the butter with margarine or smart balance--it doesn't really work.

I don't know if it was 4 cups or not, but I had a 10 oz bag of big marshmallows which I used and I put 5 1/2 cups cereal in. Yum! Also, I had to grease my waxed paper with a little bit of Crisco shortening and that worked like a charm! Nothing stuck to it.

Great for kids w/ food allergies!! We are allergic to eggs, nuts and dairy - so this is our "treat" staple - using Earth Balance soy  spread instead of butter. We use a loaf pan lined w/ wax paper, invert when cool, and serve like cake!

A classic - always good.  I changed it up by using the new vanilla caramel marshmallows and adding some Halloween sprinkles.  The new marshmallows are very good in these, a new twist on a family favorite.

Added 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter to the melted marshmallow.  Added an additional cup of cereal.  Topped it all off with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" and melted semi-sweet chocolate on top.

Very easy! My only problem is that the recipe only makes a very small amount. I substituted Fruity Pebbles instead of the traditional Crisp Rice cereal, and my kids and husband love them! I followed MAKEITEASY4ME's "secrets" and they turned out great! I also nabbed another tip from one of the reviews that said to wet your hands to press the mixtures into your pan...it worked like a charm!

soooo im sure it would have been better if i hadnt assumed that 1/4 cup butter is a STICK of butter... they turned out very creamy and rich on the plus side ;) not worth the extra 8000000 calories though!

My treats came out perfect. Melt butter on the lowest stovetop setting. Add in the marshmallows to the same temperature, and just follow the directions from there. It may take more time, but your treats will be crispy, moist, and wonderful. :)

This recipe was a hit for my little preschoolers class.  We made them for 9/11 and added red, white and blue sprinkles on top.  They turned out really cute.  Adding a little milk once everything was added together really helped to make them chewier (is that a word?). :)

The real secret to perfect krispie treats is to only use real butter with the krispies and marshmallows. And as others stated, cook on low heat, stir constantly. Also, use butter in your spreading pan and on the spatula that you mash them down with. NEVER use cooking spray as this will make them sticky and they will fall apart when cut and picked up. For a change, make them using fruity pebles, my family loves them.

These are perfect and always turn out WAYYY better than the prepackaged kind. I've substituted different cereals for rice krispies- cocoa krispies, cheerios, and corn flakes- with equally wonderful results. During Christmas, I dye the marshmallow mixture green, use corn flakes, and shape small wreaths, topping with red hot candies for decoration.

Very good traditional treat. I loved adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix. I did not add milk as some suggested because I preffer a more solid bar than creamy. A big hit at our house. Wetting my hands to pat down the mixture was another fantastic idea...worked like a charm.

I doubled the recipe and increased the rice cereal by about 1.5 cups.  I put half in a 9x13 pan lined with buttered waxed paper, put about 1.5 cups of mini chocolate chips and mashed down, then covered with the other half of the cereal mixture.  I covered with wax paper and let it set overnight.  Liftout was a breeze, the squares stayed together, and everyone loved the chocolately surprise in the center.

Super easy. After reading a couple of reviews I just used one bag of regular cheap-o smore sized marshmallows, 1 whole stick of butter and cheerios on hand just to use them up. I measured the cheerios to 7 cups just to see what they were. Next time I would just eyeball it. Too easy.

Yum! I recommend baking in a slightly smaller pan or just not spreading it out all the way... it will result in a thicker, tastier bar. --I also followed a recommendation to dampen hands and then press mixture into pan. Oh my goodness that is SOO much easier than any other method I've tried in the past--wish I would've known sooner!! =)

I use stick margarine instead of butter, and add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tbls corn syrup to the marshmallows.  After I add the cereal and take it off the stove, I add 1 cup of large marshmallows cut into quarters.  They look and taste awesome!

I used this recipe when i made dessert for easter, But we wanted more color so I used Captain Crunch Berries instead of the Rice Krispie. It was so good, and looked colorful and bright I found it had just a touch to much butter, i will remember to add less. I also put in some vanilla because my niece and nephews are sugar lovers! It is was DELICIOUS and I WILL use this recipe again.

Amt of ingredients is perfect. However, to pass on what I've learned...using the larger/regular size marshmallows (full bag) works fine. Using colored marshmallows turns the whole thing gray but adds a somewhat fruit flavor.

Tasted great, but I didn't have near enough marshmellow mixture.  Now I did double the recipe and my marshmellows were a bit melted together so that may have had something to do with it. Next time I will just do a single recipe and use fluffy marshmellows and see if that changes things.  Can't believe I've never made these things before! I'm just trying to think of good snacks that hubby can take to work that aren't packed w/ preservatives so thanks!

Wonderful! Used 1/4 cup butter, 5 cups marshmellows, 6 cups rice krispy treats, and 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp milk to make ooey gooey krispy treats. YUMMY will make this again.

I used spreadable butter w/ canola oil - melted pretty fast. Added 5 fun-size packets of M&Ms and a dash of vanilla extract - yum. For some odd reason I couldn't find a pan and ended up wrapping large spoonfuls into individual pieces of saran wrap, then squished them into balls. They are quite portable little snacks!

How can you not give these 5 stars...they are such a classic. Obviously these are very easy to make and just as tasty. For a nice variation, I will add 1 cup of peanut butter and a couple extra cups of rice cereal...depending on the texture.

I followed the suggestions of makeiteasy4me on 3-24-08, and this is the way to go, EXCEPT I didn't use 11.5 cups of cereal.  Mine would have been too dry.  It was more like 10 cups.

This recipe makes treats that are only 2 cm high in the recommended pan size. Double the recipe or use a smaller pan for taller treats. I added a tsp of coconut flavor into the melting marshmallow mix. I also added drops of various food colors into the marshmallow/crispies mix and then stirred for a tie-dye effect. I think using colors with matching flavors would be fun, for instance orange treats with orange flavoring.

I had lost my recipe and this one helped me in a pinch, its just like I remember.
Had to make to batches so on the second one I took half and pressed into the 13x9 and then spread a layer of Nutella and then another layer it turned out great.

Oh My flippin' Heck!  I won't even tell you how my DH described them... *wink*
I doubled the recipe, added vanilla, a tsp of milk, 1 C crunchy peanut butter.  Used a 9x13 pan.  Drizzled milk and white chocolate on top.  Looks impressive too!  A stand by with dazzle!

I haven't had a real Rice Krispies treat in years, and I'm glad I found the original recipe. I did remember that there usually was not enough marshmallow mixture to go around, so I cut the rice cereal content by 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup of marshmallows. I love this recipe because it takes less than 5 minutes to make! It also doesn't have those preservatives, etc, that packaged treats carry.

Since my son is allergic to rice, milk, and peanuts (among many other things), I used this as the base for an alternative recipe.  I used a dairy- and soy- free margarine, marshmallows, puffed millet, and sunbutter (sunflower butter--tastes like a mild peanut butter mixed with honey).  The result was excellent!  The millet and sunbutter actually cut the syrupy sweetness of the marshmallows and create a mellow, tasty treat that my 23-month-old gobbles like candy!

From somewhere deep within me, I realized I love Crispy Rice Treats and this recipe is the perfect consistency.  I added a bit of vanilla and then covered with melted chocolate and sprinkles and it was awesome.

I tried adding the marshmallows after the butter have melted and it takes quite a while for it to really melt. When i took it off the heat, and pour in the crisps, its so sticky and it hardens quite fast. Can you tell me what am i doing wrong? I followed every single instructions of yours.

Who doesn't love these???  I add peanut butter when using the chocolate rice cereal and my mom adds a drop of orange flavoring to the regular marshmallow treats.  The orange is definately better than the vanilla flavoring.  Add mint at Christmas.

Yes, this is a classic, basic recipe, but I love it so much.  I've loved it since I was a kid and to this day I could eat an entire batch of these in one sitting (if I allowed myself to do so)!

To make these treats special for Christmas, add green food coloring into the melting marshmallows. After adding the rice crispies, form the treat into palm sized wreaths. Place cinnamon hearts around the wreath for decoration. After all of the wreaths are decorated, using red icing, form a small bow at the neck of each wreath.

I made these "Marshmallow Treats" for volunteers and doubled the recipe. A single bag of marshmallows weights 1 pound (454 grams). A large box of Rice Krispies weights 640 grams. According to the Allrecipes Metric Converter, I could make 109 servings with: 260 g butter; 910 g marshmallows (2 bags of marshmallows); and 635 g Rice Krispies (1 large box). I heeded another review and add the melted marshmallow mixture to the Rice Krispies (instead of reverse order). This was an "ooeey gooey mess" with the brand of marshmallows I used (SELECTION). I could have fixed it with more Rice Krispies; however, I had used the whole box when I doubled the recipe. There was no way I could cut this into shapes as I had wanted to do, and it was too sticky to wrap into individual portions for the volunteers. It would have been okay for home served out of the pan.

This recipe is a classic and is still very much loved in our house. With a little time and patience this comes out perfect every time. Just melt the butter slowly, as well as the marshmallows. I doubled this recipe and poured into a buttered 9x13 baking dish and pressed it down with a sheet of parchment paper. The next time I make these I am going to experiment with a bit of vanilla extract and some mini chocolate chips. Thank you for sharing this, brought back a lot of memories and we all loved them!

If you are using regular sized marshmallows,  you need about 40.  Also I stirred in 1-1/2 tsp of vanilla in the marshmallow mixture before adding the rice krispies.

These were gooey and delicious. I increased the recipe amount, using about 5 cups of marshmallows and 6 cups of cereal. My kids like adding mini chocolate chips on top and/or sprinkles. A popular potluck treat!

These taste exactly like the ones I used to get in school, super quick to make and taste so good! A quick tip is to put water in the pan that you heated the marshmallows in and heats slowly to get rid of any residue

My daughter at age 46 loved these as a child and loves them still, so I made them for her birthday. I added 2.5 tsp. of milk and a tsp. of vanilla as suggested in a few  other reviews. They came out tasting absolutely great. I’d eat them all myself if I hadn’t made them for her. I’ll have to make them again soon. Thank you for this fun recipe.

Perfect proportion of butter to marshmallows. Marshmallows melt quickly and don’t leave a sticky mess. Such an easy, quick, delicious treat!

I made 3 changes.  I added 1/4 cup Hershey's cocoa (unsweetened), 1 tblsp Sadaaf cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract. I added it when the last few marshmallows were about to melt. Please note that I also DOUBLED the recipe so adjust accordingly. Yummy treat and lovely aromas. Perfect for me!

The recipe "as is," is fine and good.  Just let me add echo another review:  YOU CAN NOT USE MARSHMALLOW CREME as a sub for the marshmallows.  It has to do with the chemistry of the two - the sugars are cooked longer with more moisture driven out in the marshmallow in comparisson to the creme.  They are not interchangeable.  For a really tasty spin, make original treats.  When mostly cool, melt 1 cup each chocolate chips & butterscotch chips.  Spread this on top of you pan of treats.  Let cool until very firm & cut into bars.  (You can wait until fully set, but then it is much more difficult to cut.  Similarly, cutting too soon means the cuts with meld beack together & need to be redone.)  When my mom first started making that topping only semi-sweet & butterscotch chips were available (more than 50 years ago).  I like that combo best, but my millenial nieces always favored milk chocolate chips melted with peanutbutter chips.  When young, they called them Reese's Treats.

This was a little dry for us.  Next time, we will (1) increase the marshmallows to 5 cups (an equal marshmallow to krispie ratio), (2) once the marshmallows have melted into the butter, remove from heat and stir in the 5 cups of krispies, (3) use a 9x9" pan for thicker slices, (4) use a buttered piece of wax paper to press the mixture into the pan.

My kids say I have mastered marshmallow treats and they taste like the ones at Noodles and company :) So i add a dash of milk to the melted marshmallows right before i add the cereal. I also melt about a cup more of marshmallows when I am done spreading them out in the pan and pour the extra all over them like a drizzle, makes for even gooier treats! Thanks for the starting point!

I read the  reviews and tips.  I used 1 stick of butter to 1  10 oz bag of mini marshmallows.  I added the teaspoon of milk & vanilla to the melted batter. I used 7 cups of Rice Krispies and it was perfect and tasty! The tip to wet your hands before spreading in pan, was great- NO sticking.

Awesome! I did everything the same, except, I added an extra cup of rice crispies. After I mixed it all, I let cool for a minute or so and then stirred in a few more Marshmallows to where they were slightly melted and very pretty when spreading in the dish. 
At the end I let them cool for a couple more min. Then I topped them with mini m&m's. They are the best, ever!

This recipe is the bomb.  I use it often with the microwave, but today I followed someone's advise and used the stovetop method.  I often end up with a cup or so of several types of cereal.  Today I had Cocoa Krispies, Jiff Peanut Butter cereal, and a few cups of Kellogg's Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory cereal.  It looks pretty amazing.  How can I possibly go wrong with the chocolate stuff, right?

Exactly right measurements on this one. Have always wondered why my made-to-spec bars were never gooey and buttery, adding the additional Tablespoon of butter really helped out. Microwave or stove top, they turn out the same way as long as you watch while cooking and don't burn the mallow or brown the butter. One note is to slowly fold the mixture together to ensure total saturation, it's tough if you just dump the cereal right in.  Great job on this one!

This recipe is SPOT ON!!!!!!!! I love it and my family loves and wants me to make it ALL of the time. Taste way better than the ready made ones in the store. I've made this recipe with both salted and unsalted butter. In my opinion the salted butter taste best in the recipe, helps bring out the sweetness of the marshmallows. Thanks for sharing!!!

My 92 year old Grandmother LOves, LOVEs, LOVES these! And they were so easy to make, too. The only thing I will keep in mind for future mallow treat making is that when you press down the treat in the baking dish, make sure you PRESS LIGHTLY. I pressed too hard and they ended up like little slabs of concrete. They are supposed to be light and fluffy, so remember to just press lightly.  Also, I put icing on mine and they were delicious!

I remembered the ingredients but forgot the measurements so thanks.  This is an excellent standard recipe for rice crispy treats.  It makes nice thin treats which is good for fewer calories and you get a treat that's about the same size as the boxed name-brand ones from the grocery store. It's the perfect consistency as they hold up well for my son's school lunches throughout the week.  To put them in the pan, instead of a spatula, I put vegetable or canola oil on my hands and press them down until they're flat.  I find it easier and faster.

I am in Albania for a 18 month church mission so it was a real thrill when I happened on Rice Krispies and Marshmallows in the same week! Anyway, I used Nutella with the marshmallow and butter mix - it was wonderful to have the peanut butter & chocolate combo to complement the other ingredients.What a grand old nostalgic cookie bar to have in a strange land!

These cookies are not very filling although a tweensy bit well flavored. They should be great with sweetened cream or milk free coffee which I've not had them as I've been a low carb dieter for years. When I did eat them I was quite young and this treat was MUCH better than an apple or a glass of milk for a snack, e.g. kids love them. Don't get me wrong they are not bad, just a little bland. What I love is the capacity to mold the cooling cookies into forms or shapes, so cool to do, and decorate or frost. While I'm thinking about it I'm interested in building a three layer Krispie Cake treat -- sound good? I think my family would really be fascinated with a cake creation like this.

Melted very slowly, and they were hard as a rock a few hours after making them. My treats are normally perfect, so I was concerned about cooking melted stuff 2 extra minutes. Huge mistake!

Greasy and uses less cereal than the usual recipes found on marshmallow and rice crispy rice cereal products.  That makes this recipe defective and incorrect and ruining many many batches of treats.  Daughter used this recipe to make a batch for me of which I got ingredients.  I was disgusted by the results and told her she was never to google a recipe on the web again when the real recipe's can be found on the packages.  This recipe needs to be corrected or replaced.

This is the ONLY way to make these treats... by far the best!!  Although this recipe is perfect as is, I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for a little extra deliciousness.  I also double the recipe, but keep it in a 9x13 pan... just press it in really good.  Absolutely outstanding!

Classic! To just easily add flavor, just add anything you like - chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, nuts, m&ms, reese bits, pretty much anything can be thrown into these.

Used the jar of cream instead of marshmallows worked out fine. But I didn't use the butter. I think the added moisture from the butter caused the other person to have a unset batch. Also i did put it in the fridge for a while to cool it. Was great used one jar of cream and the vanilla and then fruit loops instead. Will use on any of our stale cereal.

Great, classical recipe. It was nice to have it typed down somewhere where I could adjust the servings. I used 1/4 recipe to make a balloon cake for my sister's birthday- it worked great! Hint: The treats are best when they're warm.

This was really good! I took the suggestion of adding a some vanilla in after the butter melted. ( I also accidently put some almond extract in but it tastes awesome- I suggest it for those feeling "wild") I also think that 1/4 cup butter is a little too much, next time I'll add 3 tbsp. Like other people I suggest doubling the recipe- it only came about 1/3 full of the 13 x 9 in pan. :)

Very easy. On the box it calls for 3tblsp. of butter so, we did 3.5. My daughter and i continued on to dip a few in ghiradelli dark chocolate and she put star sprinkles on (the treats and floor......and table) sadly this is the first time I've made these. I have always noted the, "its SO messy" "so drily" "not worth the mess ............" Well, glad I know that unless you leave your 4yr. Old alone to tend to the production of your pretty safe. U literally rinsed my pan with hot water and 98% rinsed right off... Perfect!

These were pretty good. Everyone liked them, but I'm not crazy for rice crispy treats. But I still liked them.

This is such a classic. I like to use marshmallow peeps to make them too. Pumpkins at Halloween give you an orange treat, pint at Easter, etc...

These are DELICIOUS! I read some reviews and  make sure you don't brown the butter and constantly stir the marshmallows. Also add in a capful (2 or 2 1/2 tsp?) of milk and half a teaspoon of vanilla. Just for the people with those jumbo/regular marshmallows, 4 cups = 40 marshmallows :) yummy

Here's my take: Used 1/3 c Smart Blend Butter, 3 cups marshmallows, 4 cups cheerios, added 4tbsp low sugar pnt butter and 60 choc chips. Divided into 12 servings = 107mg sodium 20carb 8fat per serving. Granted, the serving size is a little smaller, but along with a glass of milk after school, it's just the right sweet treat for the kids without ruining dinner. I won't ever buy these from the store again! Great recipe!

Made them for the 4th and they were wonderful! Used 1 1/2 bags of marshmallo's (about 16 oz). Yesterday I made another batch, using the left over marshmallos, they were terrible. Hard as rocks. BE SURE TO USE ONLY FRESH MARSHMALLOWS!

My personal variation is to add a teaspoon or two of vanilla, and about a cup of shredded coconut. The added flavor really makes them a hit!

For a small batch, use 3T butter, 3 cups marshmallows, 3.5 cups cereal and a 9*9 pan.

I love these! Next time I want to try a variation mentioned in other reviews.

I love to make marshmallow treats and they turn out great. I made some yesterday but this time I used Fruity pebbles and the fun mellows ( the fruit flavored marsh mellows) I thought they would be really fruity for the kids well they really didn't work that well. I think the problem was with the marsh mellows more then the fruity pebbles. Maybe next time I will try to mix the fun mellows and regular mellows.

We doubled the recipe, using 80 large marshmallows instead of the mini's.  We also added 5 tsp milk and 2 tsp vanilla to the butter before adding marshmallows.  We also, melted 1 lb dark chocolate and poured over the treats!!!!  Okay can we "heavenly," alright my 10yr old said, "WOW these are the BEST!!!"

I make the recipe on the box (3 TBP butter, 1 pkg marshmallows (about 40 large), 6 cups cereal.  Also use the microwave. But this sounds so similar, I'm sure it's great!    My two tips:  (1) You can make these into shapes by hand (I did hearts for Valentine's), seems easier than cutting them out; and (2) DO NOT use off-brand marshmallows.  Totally different results, much harder to work with, at least for shapes.  Bummer!

A classic, simple recipe. The kids loved helping with this one. We used the jet puffed strawberry marshmellows (valentine's edition) so we ended up with pink treats. Yummy and fun!

Yummy! I followed exact recipe and heated everything super slow on the stovetop. We added red dye to make pink treats with white sprinkles for V-day. My three year old says "I love it, I love it!!" Thanks for sharing!

I veganized these by using gelatin-free marshmallows (it took about one and a half 8.5 oz. containers of Sweet & Sara's vegan 'mallows, but you could probably use Ricemellow Cream instead) and Earth Balance margin and they turned out delicious. I used parchment paper to press the stuff into the pan -- it can be tossed directly into the compost bin afterwards.

This is the first recipe that i make and i have to say, its awsome! The recipe is very easy to follow and thanks to the other suggestions I added little twists here and there. Instead of using marshmallows I used the creme, and it was not messy, I also added the 2 1/2 teaspoons of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of "mexican" vanilla. To top them off I used recess peanut butter chips. I also used the oven just enough time to allow the chips to melt and now they are sitting on a rack cooling down. Thanks again for such a great recipe =)!

I formerly could NOT MAKE Rice Kripsy Treats.  They would turn out dry and hard or too marshmallowy.  THIS RECIPE IS PERFECTION.  You really have to use LOW-3 setting and do things slowly (which annoys me, but it works!)  They could NOT be better.

My treats turned out moist, and gooey. Just like they should. No teeth busters here. I did follow the suggestions in some of the other reviews. And used 11.5 cups of cereal to a 16 ounce bag of marshmallow, and a whole stick of butter. This worked out so well. Everyone has loved them. Will make again and again.

I used the ratio of ingredients listed by a review. I used the 1 stick of butter and 11 cups of cereal. Pretty much close to this recipe. I also added food coloring to the marshmallow and butter mixture and made GREEN rice crispy treats for my little goblins for Halloween. My mom suggested cutting them into shapes with cookie cutters but I haven't gotten that far yet. If I do, I will re-edit this review. TFP!

We made these Marshmallow treats and used the "secret tips" by makeiteasy4me and they were soooo good! We also added orange food coloring to make them orange for Halloween! You can add food coloring of any color during holiday seasons. Kids Love to eat stuff when it is a color!!

I used the microwave version, and they turned out great. Coworkers gobbled them down in minutes. Thanks.

Made this recipe twice now and got the same results both times.  The marshmallow treats are crumbly and taste stale when eaten.  I would revise by using less butter and more cereal.

I used homemade marshmallows, and they worked perfectly with this recipe. I would only advise people to go easy on the vanilla, as it can overwhelm the pure flavors of the rice krispies and marshmallow. A great recipe - right now, almost no marshmallow treats are left!

I make this recipe by melting the butter first in the microwave. Once butter is soft, I add the marshmallows and heat on high for 1 min. Stir immediately. Add the Rice Crispies & stir. Add to a square pan, let cool, et voila. Ready to go :) Great, simple recipe.

Try adding a teaspoon or more of cinnamon for a change - very tasty.  Also sprinkle and little extra cinnamon/sugar mix on top while they are cooling.

The recipe contains the essentials to make a good treat, worthy of five stars. But, the flavor will be improved by adding a little vanilla extract. Make certain to melt the butter completely, and very slowly without any browning. Then add the marshmallows, and again heat very slowly. More time spent melting is so worth the final result.  Always use a glass dish for best results. When ready to press into the dish spray it with cooking spray first, dump the mix, then spray your pressing hand to keep it from sticking while shaping the treat.

These are delicious. I used a 10.5 oz bag of mini marshmellows and they were perfect. I also added a little vanilla to the melted marshmellows.

This is a great receipe...if you spray pam on a cookie cutter, you can cut them into individual shapes.  They frost like cookies, using your favorite icing reciepe and a icing bag.  They turned out great for my best friends daughter's birthday!!!

GREAT RECIPE! I enjoyed reading others to get some tips. Best "gooey" tips I've taken are to use 1 stick of butter, 11.5 cups of rice krispies, and 1 bag of mini marshmallows. I did not quite have a full bag so I used about 10 big marshmallows and they still turned out FABULOUS! Awesome recipe..my whole family loved them and we are not much of a marshmallow bar family!

These marshmallow treats were wonderful! My very first time making them so the recipe is definitely good for a beginner. The treats kinda fell apart when I picked them up, but maybe I should have let them cool for a little bit longer. Otherwise, good recipe.

WOW. These were so good! I normally don't like the storebought ones because they're always too too too sweet, but and I gave these a chance and good thing I did! I added a little bit of vanilla extract to the melted marshmallows.  If you have a hard time packing them tightly into a pan, use a sheet of parchment paper to really pack the mixture tight into the pan. Even when using a silicon spatula, it stuck too much, and the parchment paper didn't stick to anything!

great recipe!  for easter my daughter and i used fruity pebbles instead of rice crispies!  they are very colorful.  i have also found that you can use many different cereals.  love it with crispex too.  just dont use something REALLY sweet like cinnamon toast crunch or frosted flakes.  you will feel like you get instant cavities!  its just too sweet.  Want chocolate treats? use COCO Pebbles! Yumm!

I followed the review of another member. I slowly melted 1 stick of butter and 16oz. of mini marshmallows (Jett Puff). I added a capful of vanilla extract and 1 1/2 tea of milk.  Then I added 10 cups of rice crispies and spread it out on a 9x13 Pyrex pan.  It came out gooey and delicious!!!!

Very tasty -- hard to stop eating.  I molded an animal with it for a birthday cake, and I accidentally ate the ear - had to make more. (That's a shame.)  I used cocoa rice cereal and added 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup chocolate pieces to color the marshmallow.  Very good result.  Thanks.

I used the new jumbo rice crispy cereal Kellogg's recently came out with...yummm! My entire family loved them. The cereal has a hint of honey in them and that is what I think made them even better.

Yum! Melting slowly on the stove seems to be key-I've made these several times in the microwave and they get rock-hard after the first two hours. Followed others' advice and added 2 TBSP milk and vanilla. Thanks!

Perfectly makes the typical rice krispie treats, but for my own tastes I'd recommend using the same amount of marshmallows as rice krispies (example: 5 cups instead of 4 of marshmallow, based on the 5 cups of rice krispies). They tasted fine as made, but I prefer a little more marshmallow to 'em.

I really enjoy these when they are gooier, so I decrease the cereal amount to about 3 - 4 cups (depending on what I have). They are REALLY good this way! Another tip: instead of buttering your hands, you can dip them in cold water, then shake off to press into the pan. Works every time, without a greasy coating on top.

Really good and super easy.  I can make just about everything, but for some reason I have such a hard time making these, they always have come out stale.  I melted the butter really slowly and then melted the marshmallows pretty slowly.  I added a tbs of milk to make it really creamy. They came out perfect!

VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS! After stirring in the rice crispies I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and gently stirred them in.  I sprayed non-stick spray in the pan and after I poured the mix in the pan I sprayed foil with the spray and gently pushed the mix into place.  My hands never touch the mix!!!

This is a good basic recipe!  I added two spoonfuls of peanut butter and about 1/4 bag of chocolate chips at the end of the melting process for a chocolate/peanut butter type dessert instead!  It turned out really good!  I also added about 1T. milk after the other extras so it stirred better and made it more creamy!  Yum!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used one stick of salted butter, one bag of regular marshmallows and one 12oz box of rice krispies cereal.  They turned out great and fit exactly in my 9x13 cake pan.  This was the first time I've made these treats and they couldn't have been better.

The treats were a hit with my two toddlers!  One suggestion...I used a sheet of waxed paper to press the treats down into the pan.  I tried spraying my hands with non-stick spray, but the treats were too hot!  The treats were nice and even and nothing stuck to the waxed paper!

I used one of the other suggestions for more gooey treats. I used one stick of butter, a 16oz. bag of mini Jet Puff Marshmallows, and 10 cups of rice krispies. Used a 13x9 pan, they came out nice and thick, and especially gooey. Absolutely delicious!

Just the way I made them as a child!  As another reviewer mentioned, you need to double the recipe otherwise they are too thin and hard to spread out into the pan.

I have made these 3 times now.  Every time that I make these, I always end up printing out this recipe for the Mom's!  Nice easy classic treat.
--UPDATE. I added some milk like some of the others suggested as soon as the marshmallows melted, and boy.....AWESOME!!

I have not make them adding peanut butter.  I tried M&Ms but they melted and were messy.

I use a fruity rice cereal sometimes.  Tghe kids love the confetti colors, and it tastes really good for adults too!

I think it could have used a little more marshmallows, but other than that it was great. I sprinkled in some mini m&m's.

I definitely should have heeded the advice of others and used the microwave to prepare the marshmallow/butter goop- my saucepan is going to soak for a few hours before I attempt to scrape the toasted sugary mess from the bottom of it.
In anycase, the taste of these treats are divine. I used 1/2 cup butter, 4 cups marshmallows and 5 cups of chex cereal (3 cups wheat, 2 cups corn). The combo of these 2 different chex flavors is  near perfect!

I love this recipe.  My mother has been telling me forever she'd make me rice crispie treats and hasnt.  I went to bake cookies today and realized I was out of flour, so I came on here for ideas of what to make.  As soon as I saw this recipe I decided to make them for my family and the family of the girl I babysit.  It was so quick!!!!!  I was able to watch Emily and cook all at once.  Thanks for the recipes!!!! You're the best!!

We just made these for my daughter's b'day snack tomorrow at school. We added food coloring to the marshmellows as they were melting.  We did one batch and realized they looked kind of thin in the 9 x 13 so we did another batch with a different color and added m 'n m's and put another layer on top!  They look super cool and she's so proud of them.

A good classic.  I shaped these into footballs then piped chocolate frosting on to resemble the markings of the ball.  Used at a superbowl party with kids.

Rice Crispy treats that you expect homemade.  Not like the yucky store bought, which is what you get when you use marshmallow fluff.  Wetting hands with water was a good tip.  Wish I knew that years ago when my mom and I made these for school.

For a healthier treat, I use brown rice cereal, add unsalted nuts, and 1/3 cup flax seed to the batch. The taste is the same, just nuttier. Sometimes I add sultanas too.

I loved this recipe, but changed it just a bit to my own tastes.  I used the microwave as did another reviewer, but I used Corn flakes instead of Rice Crispies and added some green food coloring.  And instead of pressing it into a pan to cool, I dropped it onto the waxed paper in bite-sized bits and added some small red candies and Voila!  Holly to decorate my Christmas cookie trays!!

I followed this recipe minus the marshmallows. I also added about a cup of coco rice krispy in one batch and crushed some fruit loops that was a big hit amongst my audience. I also sprinkled some festive colored crystals for fun!

I will never use marshmallow creme again!! I used marshmallow's for the first time and it makes so much sense now why my r.c.t never stuck together with the creme. With the actual marshmallows this was amazing!!! In my nonstick pan there was no sticky mess!!

Wow, the best I have ever made.  I added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the melted butter before adding the marshmallows.  May not make "regular" rice krispies ever again!

This was a great recipe! I made it for a Basketball game fundraiser and they sold out! I did add three things though, the first was a large spoonfull of peanut butter into the marshmellow and butter goo.  The second is that I added a half cup of butter instead of a fourth. The third was I addded white and milk chocolate chips in with the peanut butter, marshmellows, and butter.  This is definately the recipe to try!

I think it is better with 6 cups cereal, but maybe that's just me!  I couldn't make marshmallow creme work as a substitute but the marshmallows work great.  A classic!

This was my first time making these and they were really easy!  I replaced one cup of the rice cereal with fruity pebbles for a little bit of flavor and color.  They were yummy.

I had a heck of a time finding this recipe, because I kept calling them "rice crispie treats." These are yummy and easy. Using butter instead of oleo is definitely a plus. A teaspoonful of vanilla helps a lot, too.

We made these in a 8x8 pan sprayed w/ Pam.  Like another reviewer, we microwaved approx. 2-3T of vanilla frosting & drizzled it over the marshmallow treats.  Very easy & tasty snack.

This was soooo delicious! I made a bigger quantity, using 10 c rice crispies and almost 10 cup marshmallows with a stick of butter. I think the little "extra" marshmallows were wonderful for it. Husband loved it and it disappeared in less than 3 days!

If you want to avoid dairy, refined coconut oil is a great substitute. You can also make the marshmallow mixture in the microwave 30 seconds at a time on height stirring really well each time until it is incorporated and super light and fluffy. The volume increases significantly, so be sure to use a large enough microwave safe container. It took 2 minutes total in my microwave.

I doubled the batch added a teaspoon of vanilla and a splash of milk. Also added 1 cup semi sweet choc chips and one cup  M&M baking chips. They were a huge hit with my family and friends. Thanks for all the tips.

These rice crispy treats are so easy to make and so delicious. The clean up is easy and fast. I would definitely make this again. These are the best rice crispy treats I’ve ever had! Putting chocolate frosting on them makes them even better!!!

I did add a splash of vanilla, and 2 tsp of milk, per other reviews.  Used an 11x7 pan.  Will reduce the amount of cereal next time, for a gooier version.

This recipe is awful. I added an extra cup of marshmallows and one less cup of rice Krispies and it still wasn't right.  It's like the healthy version of rice Krispies, which no one wants.

I really liked this recipe, I'd never made rice crispy squares before and this was a great starting point. I did make changes since I only had LRG marshmallows, so I used about 45 added a tsp of Canned carnation milk and a tsp of vanilla just cause I love the flavour. They Turned out YUMMY

The best recipe I have come across for this treat. I did use 1 stick of butter for a standard size box of cereal. I also added additional miniature marshmallows when mixing up the melted marshmallow and cereal.

I'm sorry, but this is just normal rice krispie treats. Nothing different or special. And you cannot substitute marshmellow creme, it is not the same at all.

I will not make this recipe again.. It does not set up with marshmallow fluff.  You need the actual marshmallows for it to set up. It does have a great flavor though.

Great recipe!! I added my cannabis butter which added a little extra kick if you know what I mean ;) . This is a treat for the adults only haha. If you add some marijuana be sure to crush it up very fine and to cook it at a very low heat with the butter or else you could damage the thc. I say cook it on low heat for 12 hours if you can but 1 hour will do too if you really are in a hurry.

First of all I used Marshmallow cream fearful though because of one review here.  I didn't have marshmallows but I did have a 7 oz. container of store brand cream.  I followed the recipe exactly using the cream, then pressed it all into a small square pan then tossed it into the fridge for 15 minutes because my son wanted them now!  He took them out and cut a big hunk and they were perfect.  He loved the way they tasted, so original.  Thank you.

Such a wonderful treat for kids and adults alike. Everyone loves them. I followed the recipe exactly...except...I added green food coloring to the marshmallow mixture for Frankenstein’s monster. Then I dipped the square into melted dark chocolate candy melts (hair), added candy eyes, and piped a crooked mouth below. Perfect for Halloween!

This is a childhood classic recipe.  Tip, when forming the Rice Krispies treats into the pumpkins, spray your hands with non-stick cooking spray.  I used Tootsie Rolls for the stems and green Fruit Roll ups for the leaves.  They are both cute and tasty and a huge hit with the kids!

Used 3 cups instead of 5 cups of rice crispies with the same amount of butter and marshmallows, and white chocolate chips and melted white chocolate drizzled on top. The white chocolate really made it, but I thought the recipe could use some more marshmallow.

Low heat over the stove and adding a splash of milk improves an already delicious, classic treat.

I like this recipe, but instead of the mini marshmallows, I use approx. 40 LG ones, and I add approx. 1/2 - 1 Tsp of Caramel Extract.  For variations,  you can add food coloring to the melted marshmallow mixture to make mini pumpkins, apples, snowmen, etc, or you can shape them into balls and insert popsicle sticks in them.  When cooled, you can then roll  the bottom half of the marshmallow balls in melted chocolate, then immediately roll them in candy sprinkles OR oreo cookies crushed in a blender.  So many ways you can decorate these, and it makes it super fun for the kids to help make.. AND EAT! :)

Our family loves these.  This is one recipe I do use my microwave to make.  Super easy! The kids love the way I make them, adding a tsp of real vanilla to the melted butter and marshmallow mix before stirring in the rice crispy.

Super easy!! And tastes really good and fresh... Better than store bought. My 11 yr old daughter helped me and she was surprised at how easy it was. We followed the recipe exactly as it said, and added a bit of vanilla.

Amazing how easy these were to make! Although this was the first time ever making them. Tasted great weren't dry! Not sure if others have said this but I used parchment paper to smooth out the mixture. Smoothed out evenly and easily. Thanks!

I just finished making these, and they're delicious! They were super easy to make and came together very fast. I followed the recipe as it was written. After putting them into the pan, I threw some colorful sprinkles on top for a fun spring look. A classic, tasty rice krispie treat recipe!

So yummy! Instead of using 4 cups of marshmallows I used a 10oz bag which is like 6 cups of marshmallows. They were soft and flexable..but I like them like that.

I made this recipe and they really are the best marshmallow treats.  I have made some really bad marshmallow treats in the past, couldn't get the marshmallow to krispie ratio right, and this is the winner.  Great recipe, thanks!

Truly easy! I wanted something with chocolate then it occurred to me to use chocolate rice krispies. Perfect solution for me since I had the chocolate ones on hand and gluten free.  Yum!

I used 6 giant marshmallows and only had just over 4 C chocolate crispies. Had to get the kids to eat this cereal before it started to go stale.

Love rice krispy squares but I would for sure double it. I don't know how you could yield 24 2" square treats, I doubled the recipe and still only got 16 treats!!

A classic... I make these all the time for group events and for some reason my kids friends say mine are the best. I usually just stick to the basic receipe posted here. I do however use salted butter and always buy fresh name brand ingredients for this receipe (be sure to check the date on those marshmallows in the market)

I had Fruity Pebbles on hand and used 1 cup of FP and 4 cups of Rice Krispies.  Gave the taste a slight twist.  I also followed the suggestion to melt the butter and marshmellows slowly an add 2 1/2 tsp of milk.   So good and so easy

The stove top was really easy. I took it really slow like another reviewer said and I also sprayed my hands with pam when I pressed it into the pan and it worked really good. I also made a chocolate drizzle to spread on half of the loaf and it turned out great.

I think the recipe on the rice crispies box calls for 6 cups of cereal, but other than that it's the same recipe, which I have been using for years.  Doesn't get much better than that!

Yummy, I should have read reviews though as mine were quite stiff and not gooey like I would have liked. Next time I'll try adding the splash of milk. This was super easy and quick - perfect for a sweet craving late at night ;-)

This is a great starter recipe, I sometimes add raisins, pecans, cinnamon, peanut butter, chocolate chips. I have so far not made a batch the kids wont eat. I might make some today with some dried mango.

These marshmallow treats are the best I have ever had!  Very easy and takes maybe 5 mins.  I do a little something extra and put sprinkles on top for some fun color.

This is a great recipe! The treats stay soft days later.  That is if they last that long!

When I mix in the rice cereal I add 2 peanut butter cup bars (4.25 oz each) that are cut in small chunks.  Most of the chocolate/peanut butter melts but some remain slightly in pieces.  (You can find the bars typically in the candy aisle or cake aisle or just use miniatures).  So yummy!

I think I may have been off the measurements, because I mostly eye-balled it. They are so good and so easy to make but I truly think my pot will be soaking for a month after making these.

So good & simple.  I used 1/2 stick butter, 1 (10 oz bag) mini marshmallows, 1/2 teaspoon milk and 6 cups rice krispies.  Then sprinkled them with heart shaped confetti candy for valentines day.  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and took someones advice and used cooking spray on my hands too.

This was perfect!  The recipe on the box of Kellogg's rice crispies calls for 1 extra cup cereal, but the result was too dry.  This will be my standard recipe from now on.  Just make sure to melt the butter and marshmallows on a semi-low heat.

I prefer a litte more marshmallow for a gewier treat.  I also will sometimes add peanut butter before adding the crispies or chocolate chips when adding the rice krispies.  It's best when the chips just start to melt.  :-)  yum!!

LOVE THEM!! Leave a cup of rice krispies off to the side, just in case you want yours gooey-ier. You can always add in some more, but you can never take them out once they've been mixed in :)

Like makeiteasy4me; I wanted to make a bigger batch.  I only had a 10-1/2 oz. bag of marshmallows, though.  I improvised using the whole bag of marshmallows, 6 T of butter, and 10 cups of cereal.  I also added 1-1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  Came out perfect......the only problem is that I live alone and will probably eat the whole batch myself...lol!

I bought the generic cereal and there wasn't a recipe on it, so as usual I knew I could rely on this site. They came out delicious and were gone before they cooled.  P.S. It helps me to put butter on my hands and then push the treats in the pan...no sticking!

I have a big box of corn flakes left over, so, I crushed it, and used that in place of the rice cereal. Turns out awesome, reminds me of this treat I had when I was little. Wonder if all bran cereal would work too..hmmmm... Oh yea, I did add milk as suggested by the reviewers. oooey gooey yummy!

Simple and good. Next time after placing in the pan I may sprinkle on a few chocolate chips.

Perfect and so easy. I did double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan so they would be thick. Will try adding toppings (M&M's etc.) as I make this again and again.

Very Very easy to make. Took me like 5-7 mins to do. Very tasty and easy to chew on. Will definetly do them again soon but will add choco chips to them next time.   The best thing about this recipe is that u have room for creativity to add any additional ingredients :)

Turned out perfect and then I mixed one cup of chocolate chips and I cup of butterscotch chips and melted them in a pan and spread over the bars.  My kids just ate half the pan in the last 10 minutes -- so good!

Nice and moist.  Used Jet Puffs new vanilla caramel swirl marshmallows.  They gave an interesting flavor.  Also used the multi-grain "big" Krispies.  Not sure they were wonderful, but not bad.

They were awesome! And my aunt actually liked them! LOL, I made two different batches, one plain and one with some crunchy cereal and raisins. They were yummy! Next time, I'll try in some m&m's, raisins, other cereal and milk. Oh, and probably peanut butter too. LOL, Thanks for posting! They're affordable and yummy and I'll ALWAYS make these from now on!

I followed all the suggestions + made it a fruit loop krispies.  They turned out delicious!  I kept eating spoonfuls before they were even cooled!  1/2c butter, 1 bag (10.5oz) mini marshmallows, 5c rice krispies, 5c fruit loops, 2 1/2 tsp milk, splash of vanilla and I layed them on parchment paper in a 9x13.  Fruit loops are perfect for making little designs with the colors while they're being cooled for special occasions.  I used a small piece of parchment paper to press it flat with my knuckles.  It works out perfect because nothing sticks!

Followed this to a T.  Perfect amount for a small family.  Marshmallow Treats are best when fresh, and the larger recipes just get stale in our house!

another great variation of these can be made by using fruity pebbles or chocolate rice crispys instead of the plain kind. it mixes it up a little and tastes delicious!

I cut the recipe down to serve 6, melted everything in the microwave and used a loaf pan to chill the treats in. Then took and melted 4 squares of Baker's Semisweet chocolate (chopped into smaller chunks, stirring every 30 seconds after the first 45 for about 4 minutes on high) and topped it all off with that. Took about two hours to chill into yummy chocolate coated goodness. Super simple recipe, in all (including the chocolate topping) it took me 15 minutes to make this. Can't beat something that simple.

Yummy! These are SOOO much better than the premade ones you buy in the store!  I melted everything very slowly (using lite butter) and added a tsp of vanilla and a heaping spoonful of crunchy peanut butter to the marshmallow/butter mixture. I also agree you need to either double the recipe or use an 8x8 pan unless you want REALLY thin treats!

These were very good. Next time I will make sure to add more marshmallows.  I used another's advice and added a spponful of cruchy peanut butter and then poured chocolate on the top.  A nice change!

Usually I just guessed on the amount of butter, marshmallows and cereal and I was never consistant.  I never added enough butter, no wonder my treats never were as good as my mother's.  These are perfect.

It is what it is and that's enough for my four kids!
 A simple easy to make with the kids recipe.  I did have a minor issue with it but it is easily rectified.  I believe the squares should be bigger so for those using the 9x13 pan should definitely double this recipe.

This recipe's pretty good.  I felt like there was too much butter, I'd cut it down next time.  I threw in ~1 c. of chocolate chips with the rice cereal and it melted right in.  Sprinkles went on top for fun!

Great recipe! I used the marshmallows, not the cream. I also cut the cereal down to 4 cups instead of five and added mini M&M's. They turned out great!!!

mmmmm

I added a cup of mini chocolate chips with the cereal so they melted and made them chocolatey! Very good...
I also made them in the microwave.

These were okay but nothing spectacular.  Next time I may have to take the advice of others and add fruity pebble's or something

It was ok. I substituted a 1/2cup of fruity pebbles for 1/2cup of the rice cereal to try and add some flavor. It just didn't seem sweet enough to me or the kids, will make again and try something different, like m&m's.

Great, of course.  I made these with 1/3 cocoa krispies and 2/3 rice crispies.  That added just enough chocolate flavor!
