I actually chunked up my banana the night before as I wanted to eliminate the ice from the smoothie. My banana was quite large. To say that my kids loved this smoothie would be an understatement. My youngest boy drank his and asked for seconds. I will make this again tomorrow.

I love this recipe and my younger siblings love it too! I found out you should put a little more peanut butter in and put a little less honey in. But other than that it was perfect! :)

This is a very yummy and very filling recipe, so it is great for an afternoon snack.  This smoothie is also very easy to make.  It's sweet enough to fill your sweet tooth but nutritious too.  The kids at my house from 5 to 15 love this one!

I followed the directions on this but used a frozen banana. It tasted like a not really sweet peanut butter banana shake with the frozen fruit. I then added 1 packet of Truvia and it was 5 stars or just like a shake. I may experiment with this recipe again using less peanut butter and using just the Truvia packets to lower the calories and sugar. It seems easy to modify or lighten up. Thanks

Mmm! I used plain yogurt instead of milk for some extra protein, but otherwise made it as written. Easy and tasty!

I haven't had this exact recipe. I make mine with greek yogurt and a little bit of water (depending on how thick I want) , I also use frozen bananas instead of fresh. You really can vary the amounts and this smoothie always comes out delicious.- Lisa

It was too thick so I added a little more milk. It was so smooth and creamy. This is a very good and filling smoothie.

Made it as a snack for my 7 year old son using almond milk and he loved it!  I added a little more almond milk than the 1/2 cup of milk listed--maybe 3/4 cup.  I also think next time I'll use less honey. Was very creamy.
