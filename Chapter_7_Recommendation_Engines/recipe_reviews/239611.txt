I absolutely hate giving a bad review but these just were not edible. 1 cup flour is not nearly enough. I mixed up the batter as directed and cooked one - it was thin but would not cook through. I added another 1/2 cup of flour and that helped a little but still the middle never set - I think the amount of oil in the recipe caused that problem. I am so sorry Michelle but these just didn't work for me.
