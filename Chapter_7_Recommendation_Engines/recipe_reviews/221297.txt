These are really good. I made them in advance and then froze them for work lunches, so i didn't try this until today. A very nice change from turkey or chicken all the time. My only change was using broccoli instead of corn since I cannot have corn.... oh and real garlic!

My kids whine every time I fix tuna.  So I'm always on the lookout for "different" tuna recipes.  They loved this.  Thank you.

This is great! I love tuna, but I didn't know how it would go in Mexican, but the spices blended it in so well. I left out the wing sauce because I don't have any, but it was very yummy nonetheless. I'm going to have to figure out some way to modify it, though, because my husband hates beans and corn. But I loved it as is.

it was ok but WAY too salty. It might have been ok if not so much garlic salt was added.

Used minced garlic instead of garlic salt to reduce salt content.added one extra TBSP of hot wing sauce..3 instead of two. transferred from skillet to foil lined cookie sheet into 300 degree oven to keep warm. Husband loved these!!- another Beth

These were super easy, fast, and tasty. I added an extra spoon of Buffalo sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's. I substituted guacamole for the sour cream (which is really telling because I LOVE my sour cream) and fresh minced garlic as opposed to garlic salt. I also cut out the butter and used coconut oil to fry the tortilla in. I served them with fresh pico de gallo. Aside from being a bit messy they're super flavorful. I used garden spinach tortillas instead of wheat. I like how a littke can go a long way here as the tuna and black beans are quite filling. I'll be recommending these to everyone!

This was pretty good, but not really pretty looking lol.  I was expecting it to be more flavorful, considering the rave reviews and the title.  Was nothing a small side of Frank's Redhot for dipping couldn't fix.  The only change I made was to use Garlic powder and a pinch of salt (instead of garlic salt-1 tablespoon seemed like a lot) to cut down on sodium. It was certainly easy for a weekday meal, and I could see it being a great way to get kids to eat tuna.  But, since I don't have kids, I am not sure this would be a "go to" over a simple bean/chicken/spices/cheese filling for quesadillas.

Loved these.  Followed recipe as much as I could.  I couldn't find refried black beans so had to use refried pinto beans.  Also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt due to health reasons and used Franks hot sauce.  I also added some minced onion.  The filling was really delicious.  Just the right amount of heat.  I only made one quesadilla yesterday so with the left overs I can't wait to make another one for lunch today.

I was very skeptical but these turned out great! Used 1/2 c. Refried black beans (on accident) and minced garlic. Also added 1 more tbls hot sauce and kids loved them! Always looking for more kid options! Thanks!

I think this person put the wrong measurement for the garlic salt they put a tablespoon I think they meantto say teaspoon. But it was good if you caughtthe mistake

An interesting combination of flavors and very easy to make but VERY salty. I would reduce the amount of garlic salt by at least half time the next time I make this.

Just made it tonight! Interesting ingredients, and turned out good! I substituted Tapitio for the wing sauce and I added green onions to the mix. Oh and mashed up whole black beans instead of Refried black beans. Will definitely make again! Great way to get protein and fiber while getting rid of canned goods.

Very good As others did used garlic powder added some cayenne pepper since I didn't have hot sauce. The only problem i had was flipping the tortillas -- I might try filling only 1 tortilla and folding in half-- if that makes sense.

Wow!  I thought the combination of ingredients sounded strange, but oh my-delish!  I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, used real garlic and Franks redhot for the Buffalo wing sauce (because that's what I had on hand). Garnished with fresh avocado. New favorite!!

Mixing tuna with refried beans didn't sound very appealing at first, but after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a go. My family LOVED it! Even my 9-year-old and his friend couldn't get enough. I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I substituted an avocado instead. Worked perfectly! Maintained the creamy texture & added some additional vitamins. I also used garlic powder instead of salt to cut down on the sodium, and top with salsa.  I make these at least once a month now and the family still loves them!

I basically followed the recipe, just a few minor changes based on what I had on hand. I used italian cheese blend and canned black beans. Then I baked it all in one big quesadilla pie type thing. Super delicious, the toddlers loved it..will be a keeper for sure.

A favorite!  I usually double the recipe, and use minced garlic, and 3-4 tablespoons of hot sauce.. depending on the brand.

Excellent! I did as other reviewers said and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also added a little extra hot sauce as I like that and added some green onions for color.

It was OK, but I would have used more tortillas because they were overstuffed. And I don't know where you get black refried beans so I used the regular red ones. Couldn't taste much tuna, so I'll try this again with chicken or beef. I like my tuna dish to taste like tuna.

I gave this 4 stars because it was VERY salty the first time i made it.  However, the second time i used fresh tuna steaks instead of canned tuna and did not use the garlic salt and it turned out AMAZING! Big hit in our house, the second time!

Too much sour cream. Had to add another can of tuna. Way too salty. I hadn't bought garlic salt in years, so I really didn't know what to expect from a tablespoon. It's way too much. I'll probably make this again with 1/4 cup sour cream and no garlic salt, maybe just some minced garlic.

This was such a happy surprise,..and very tasty! I thought it would taste fishy but the combination of seasonings made it just really yummy.
I had some topping left over, the next day, I heated it with some left over rice and Monty Jack cheese on top, a dollop of sour cream and ate it with corn chips! Muey Sabroso!
 2 meals in one!!

This was surprisingly awesome (I didn't use a full tblsp of garlic salt...that seemed like a typo). The ingredients may seem odd, but they really do work well.  I plan on trying to replace the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt next time which would make these extremely healthy.

Sooo good! New way to use can tuna! I didn't have refried bean so I just used a can of whole black beans, and added a chopped tomato and poblano pepper. It came out delish!

A real surprise, these were wonderful, except for the excessive salt. Cut the garlic salt down to 1/2-1 tsp instead of 1 tbs and enjoy.

These are TOO SALTY! I will make again but will reduce the amount of garlic salt to 1 teaspoon from 1 tablespoon. I did not have sour cream so I used jalepeno cream cheese.

I thought this is an excellent way to get tuna and beans into the kids. It was not thier favorite but everyone ate it all gone. They re heat very well. In fact I think they may be better the 2nd day.

Didn't care for the taste.  Any other meat and they would be fine.

I was looking for a different way to use up some canned tuna and this worked pretty well; it sort of reminded me of a cross between a tuna melt and a quesadilla.  I didn't have every ingredient on hand, so I used what I had and made a few changes.  The changes I made were: I used 1/4c mayo, 1/4c regular sour cream, dash of curry powder, tbsp of cilantro, used a can of seasoned pinto beans unmashed(sort of had a smoky flavor) rather than the refried black beans and corn (I have a hard time eating corn), used 1/4c of chunky salsa and a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot to replace the wing sauce, I used fresh minced garlic rather than the garlic salt, added salt and pepper to taste, and added a handful of cheese into the blend.  I mixed everything together, spread it on half of the tortillas, topped meat mixture with colby-jack cheese, folded the "empty" side over, and stuck them under the broiler until warm, melted, and crisp.  The tortillas that I used were actually spinach wraps that I had on hand, but they tasted just fine.  I served these with sour cream.  Overall I thought they were pretty good, and think the black beans and wing sauce might have made for a nice combo if I would have had those items.  I definitely think the added seasonings would have been needed either way, to meld some of the flavors together.  And like other reviewers, I think the author made a mistake in measuring their garlic salt, and they likely meant to say "one teaspoon".  I would make this again.

My family was dreading this dinner . . . "Tuna?  In a quesadilla?"  But I told them to keep an open mind.  And I was quietly skeptical about combining tuna, black beans, and buffalo wing sauce, but it all worked well together and we all enjoyed these immensely.  They even asked if we could have this again.  Like others, I only used 1 t. garlic salt, instead of 1T.  Plenty salty with that substitution.  Also, I had not seen refried black beans before, but found Old El Paso at one of the larger grocery stores in the area.  Great recipe!  Keep an open mind and give it a try!

I must say that the oddness of this recipe is what piqued my interest, when I received a daily e-mail.  I was looking forward to trying it ever since and made it for lunch, yesterday.  I, like many on here, also altered the recipe a bit.  Rather than use wing sauce, I used chipotle Tabasco sauce.  Instead of refried beans, I used whole beans, and I definitely held back on the salt.

The chipotle flavor really set this thing off and made the 'dilla what it was.  I was just having a hard time envisioning tuna with buffalo sauce and thought that chipotle would be more fitting.

I halved the recipe, though I did go a bit heavy-handed on the sour cream, and it still made enough to completely fill two-nine inch tortillas.  It's something that I will surely make again -- possibly even today!

Ok, just finished this and already thinking on what I would change.  This is a GOOD base recipe.  Right from the start I thought 1 tablespoon of Garlic Salt seemed a little much for my taste so only added a teaspoon, same thing with cumin 1/2 teaspooon (instead of full).  Hot sauce measurement seemed fine.  I used refried black beans with Jalapeno so the quesadilas had a little more kick.  I think 1/2 cup of sour cream should be cut to a 1/4 (I used greek yogurt) and used butter spray rather than butter.  Next time I think I will add some more shredded cheese as well.  You could easily swap tuna with cooked chicken.  Overall will keep this as a quesadilla recipe and tweek.

My family rated this a10! The tuna was not overpowering which was a bonus (I used albacore tuna) I added a little bit less of the mixture as it stated and ate the leftovers the next day! Terrific!

This is very good! I don't like substituting ingredients when I first try a recipe, but I see why you would tweak a couple things. And so SIMPLE!  When you work all day, you want "easy" when you get home. Or I do!

I loved this recipe, with a few tweaks....I used a teaspoon of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt, mexicorn-instead of plain sweet corn, and just regular black beans.  I also made a sauce for either putting on the top, or using as a dip....using the wing sauce and sour cream....adding as much wing sauce as you like to taste.

I agree with lovetotry... Any decent cook takes a recipe and makes alterations to their liking. I cut back on the salt and added some fresh veggies. It was fine! Keep your food-police comments to yourself. Check out the nutritionals on fast food sometime - and don't tell me you never eat that at all. Great recipe Supertim99!

My husband LOVED these, and so did I! The kids liked them too! I tried to find "refried black beans", but ended up making my own. Next time I won't add as much of the canned black bean juice, made it kind of soupy, but it thickened nicely. Other than that, they were AWESOME. I love AllRecipes, all kinds of great things! And the app is great!

These are fabulous, but I did NOT add 1 tablespoon of garlic salt. That is waaayyyy too much sodium for no good reason. I suggest garlic POWDER instead and reduce the amount to one teaspoon, then adjust to suit your taste. You will get all the good garlic flavor minus the unnecessary sodium. Beyond that, this is an easy recipe to tweak to your liking.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, and it made for a delicious tuna salad alternative as well!  I did not use garlic salt (none in the house) but substituted garlic powder and a bit of salt.  I particularly like the flexibility; you could add lime juice, more corn, beans of a different type, etc, to adjust to what is in your pantry or to your own likes.  I tried this pretty much as described in the recipe, and it was great just as is!

Loved it!  We omited the hot sauce cause my family have sensitive mouths but used spicy black beans instead and it had the spicy taste but not the burn.
