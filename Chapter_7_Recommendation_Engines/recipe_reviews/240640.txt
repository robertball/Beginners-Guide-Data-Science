Love these!  I did roll the balls of dough in sugar before baking.  These were the first to disappear from my cookie trays this Christmas.  I think I finally learned to make sure the balls of dough are small - I tend to get lazy, and use more dough each time I roll out a batch, but a 1-inch ball is perfect for these.

The only way this recipe is different from Hershey's Peanut Blossom recipe is Hershey's calls for an additional 1/2 tsp. almond extract, which adds more flavor.

This is the perfect recipe for peanut blossom cookies....so soft and delicious!  It is the recipe from the back of the Hershey's Kisses bag.

These are always a great addition to a cookie tray. My daughter requested these to take to school tomorrow for one of her clubs. So good, and so easy to make. A classic!

I use hugs instead of kisses since my family does like chocolate! Great recipe, reminds me of my mom. Thanks for sharing.

Added almond extract at last minute and definitely can taste it. Add if you want for that extra almond flavor but maybe less than a 1/2 tsp.

Excellent!! I made these for the first time and they came out perfect. I baked them on parchment paper and rolled them in sugar too!  They looked a bit crumbly once I started putting in the kisses but after they cooked, they hardened up. Love them. Now we just need a dairy and egg free version thatâ€™s just as good.

This recipe is great to make with kids.  They unwrap the kisses while I cream the wet ingredients.  Then, they help with the sifting and the final mixing.  We roll the cookies into balls and they help press in the kisses when the cookies come out of the oven.  Great fun!

I explored many recipes before finding this which will now be added to my growing list of Christmas cookie traditions! I doubled recipe and added a 1/3 cup of powdered sugar which I read here would keep them from spreading. It definitely worked!! They look and taste delicious!! Thanks so much!!

These are more soft and not as dry as some recipes I've tried. I did have to use imperial margarine instead of shortening because it's what I had on hand.
