Very good,but I tweaked the recipe.  The butcher suggest a ratio of 2:1.  Therefore I used 1 1/4 pounds ground pork and 3/4 pounds ham.  Also used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Used  a generous 1/3 cup measuring cup to make consistent loafs to get 14. Next time would use 1/2 cup.  The smaller 1/3 loaves I flip at one hour and tested temp and they were already done.  I left in oven so glaze could caramelize on both sided.  Then popped under the broiler to brown.

I wanted to use up Christmas ham pieces and have a delicious appetizer for New Year's Eve. I didn't have any ground pork or ground beef but I did have ground elk. My daughter and I rolled them into little cocktail meatballs. I baked them until brown then covered with sauce and finished baking them. THESE ARE DELICIOUS!!!!

Six mini ham loaves (half recipe) = six delicious portions of meat.  With 3 of us eating I just halved the recipe.  The one change I made was I brought the glaze to a boil on the stovetop before adding it to the raw meat.  I saved part of the glaze to add after the meat was cooked and basted 2-3 times while the meat was cooking.  This is a delicious recipe that my family really enjoyed.  I served this with ‘Spinach and Sweet Corn Mashed Potatoes’ another AR recipe and a simple salad.  I’ve made ham loaves many, many times, but this was the first time I formed them in mini loaves.  I liked it better than making 1 large loaf.  Thanks, Deb, for sharing your version of Ham Loaf.

This is the recipe my mother always used. It is wonderful! She always glazed it with a brown sugar/yellow mustard glaze and served it with a sour cream/horse raddish sauce. It was an Easter tradition at our house!

This was a delicious! I could not find ground pork that was not mixed with ground beef, so I used that along with the ham, next time I would use more ham than the pork to give it a more authentic "ham loaf" taste. The sauce was perfect how it was. I made the "mashed cauliflower" with it and it was a hearty meal! Thanks again for sharing this recipe!

This is the best ham loaf recipe I have ever tried. I make the recipe as written and freeze half for later.

This was very good and very easy, but I would prefer a different sauce for the top.  It had a good ham flavor.  Next time I will make it and use a topping from some of my other ham loaf/ball recipes.

They are delicious! I had more than enough of the glaze so I'll cut that in half next time. Also, looking for a 'sauce' to serve with these...but they are a winner!

I used lean ground beef and made 15 loaves (3 rows of 5).
