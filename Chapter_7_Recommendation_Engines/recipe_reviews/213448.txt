I love the name! It totally suits this recipe,and we loved it! I used grated cheddar-mozza mix instead of the velveeta, it was great! We had this with a salad to feel somewhat balanced.

Holy Yummy this was good.  I spread an 8oz package of cream cheese to the bottom of the pan, then added the meat, sprinkled sharp cheddar, added the tater tots and added some queso after it was on our plates.  We all really enjoyed this and we'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was good but i used the veletta, big mistake. It didn't mix in well. Next time we try this I will be using regular shredded cheddar and putting it under the tater tots so it feels more mixed in.

This was a big hit in my house!!! I used graded cheddar instead of velveeda and mixed it all together instead of layering it. I like some heat too so I added some jalapinos too! Will make this yummy dish again!

Just what I expected, gooey, cheesy, greasy, yumminess.  Not for the faint of heart, though.  We were all miserable after consuming.  That's the point though right?

My boyfriend thinks I should rate this 4 stars due to the unhealthiness of the dish. But that's the entire point of the dish! I did make some modifications: I added some pickled sliced jalapenos (dotted them over the meat mixture in the baking dish). I also omitted the Velveeta like other reviewers did, and substituted 1 cup of shredded cheddar and about 1/2 cup of shredded Gruyere (it was leftover from another dish). I put the cheese down after the jalapeños and placed the tater tots on top. So good!

My son and I loved this recipe.  My husband was so so about it.  Only thing different I did was slice the Velveeta and layer it on top the last 5 minutes of baking and it melted just fine.

If you make this, leave the Velveeta off, and just use shredded cheddar or whatever you like. One person I made it for, said the chili with beans, Hormel, had WAY too many beans, so she will make it using chili with no beans. Don't think this is a wow recipe for my crowd, but the teenagers loved it.

This was sinfully delicious! Yummy! I hate canned chili w/beans so I was a little worried, but they were so good in this combo. Everyone in my family liked it, will be making it again!

I cut the recipe in half and opted out the bacon and beef since the chili I used had plenty of beef already. Topped with shredded medium cheddar, sour cream, and green onions, this was great!

Followed directions up to browning beef, mixing in chili, pouring in pan and then putting tots on top.  Baked at 450 uncovered for 20 minutes...then poured shredded cheese and chopped up pre cooked bacon on top and simply covered with foil and cheese melted nicely on the way to my friends.  That being said, would love to add some diced onions and jalapenos to the meat mixture as another variant!

This was awesome!!!!!  I made a couple of changes - used queso instead of velvetta, omitted the bacon and made my own chili (ground beef, diced tomatoes, kidney beans, onion, green pepper, jalapeno and seasonings).  Everyone LOVED it.

I made my own version of this because we don't care for any canned chili.  I used tomato sauce and chili seasoning in my meat mixture.  I also didn't bother melting my velveeta, just sliced it and covered the top with it and crispy chopped bacon and put it back in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.  My family enjoyed it more than I did, but it was a nice change from the same old thing.

It was okay, a little dry. Don't know that I would make it again.
