I don't know how to give NEGATIVE stars.  These were SO bland and boring.  I guess I should have known when it's sponsored by Ragu.  Yuck.

Very good recipe! I added some Italian seasoning and parsley to the cheese mix. For the crust I melted butter and added garlic powder and basil to it. (before I put it in the oven) It absorbed into the crust making it very flavorful!

Wow these were so good & easy! I made them last night to have during the super bowl. My family loved them and were looking for more. I brushed them with olive oil mixed with Italian spices before putting in the oven. The purchased dough made 3 medium sized calzones.

I added a scant tsp. Italian seasoning and a few shakes of garlic salt to the cheese mixture.  I also brushed the tops with egg whites and sprinkled with a little more garlic salt.  Yummy!

My husband, daughter and I enjoyed these and they were so easy to make.  Next time I will add pepperoni for my son.

I was really disappointed in how mine turned out... First of all, the dough I bought was square, so it was difficult to fold over properly. Some parts of the edges were too thin and the cheese mixture leaked out. Other parts I had to trim off entirely. Also, I think the temp. was too high. They started getting real dark and I still had 7 minutes to go. So I took them out, which meant the center wasn't totally hot. Also, I think next time I'll lessen the cheese and add Italian sausage and black olives. Although the cheesy was good, it was also boring. My kids loved it though! Overall it was good, but not great.

Very easy, cheesy, and delicious! I didn't follow the recipe to a tee but it was a great base. I heated some garlic, basil, broccoli, and sweet peppers in a pan prior to adding in to the cheese egg mixture. These calzones really turned out great!

Good start, easy to modify to your tastes.  Too plain for adults but good for kids.  I liked when we added alfredo sauce instead of ricotta.

I gave these guys a shot, despite the poor reviews. I added garlic salt and italian seasoning to the cheese mix, along with bits of pepperoni. The pizza dough I used came from a can so it wasnt round at all. To fix that I just cut them into 4 squares and just folded them in half over filling. Before placing the calzones in the oven I brushed them with olive oil and more italian seasoning. The first batch was a little too crispy, they def don't need 20 minutes to cook. Over all, they weren't bad at all. My husband ate them up (he is a sucker for anything cheesy).

Good but not very flavorful.  Added pepperoni but made no difference.
