This makes a great summer lunch, dinner or picnic salad.   The recipe as written is a great launching recipe - add anything you want or delete anything you don't want.   You can make it vegetarian or add the meat and tuna.  I added some chopped onion and a pinch of red pepper flakes for more flavor, and some chopped celery and red bell pepper for 'crunch.'  I used frozen peas and frozen corn.  Equally good hot or cold

The Insalata di Riso was loaded with good ingredients.  I made this unique cold dish for a late afternoon lunch.   It could have used a bit more zing, though.  I wish I had added the miracle whip (I am not a Mayo fan), that I usually add to cold pasta/rice dishes.  Or a small amount of Italian dressing.
Otherwise, the dish was well recepted, enjoyed by all.
