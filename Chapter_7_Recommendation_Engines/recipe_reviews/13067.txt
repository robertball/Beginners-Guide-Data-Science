Very good Chili!  Unfortunately, it was missing the "kick" my husband I love.  So, I added the following ingredients and if you like it spicy try adding these:
2T Garlic Powder, 1T Cayenne Pepper, 1T Salt, 3T Brown Sugar, 2T Honey, and 1T of extra Chili Powder.

Oh yeah, a suggestion to thicken up the chili is to use 2T of Corn Starch with 4T Water.

Hats off to Wendy for creating this dish.

I have been using this chili recipe for a year now, and it's been accidentally tweaked (I was too lazy to write this down and my printer was out of ink and I lost the original copy I had printed) I never use as much vinegar as the recipe calls for anymore (2 tablespoons is plenty) and I add more than a dash of worcestershire.  Also, I never addedthe  red wine since I havent found one I like cooking with that isnt expensive.  When I brown the beef, I usually use up whatever onion and garlic I have left in my fridge and I have omitted the celery and bell pepper before (I have also added more than the recipe calls for the empty out my fridge)  All in all, this is a great recipe, and especially good when it's been sitting in the fridge a day or two.

The wine is what makes this so outstanding.  I have made this several times and I thought I just have to let my fellow cookers know how good this is.  I added onions, minced garlic and a small can of green chili peppers at the same time I added the other ingredients.  Try this, you'll like it.

With some additions, this is a nice chili. I HAD to have onion in my chili so sauteed, on the stovetop, 1-1/2 onions (what I had on hand), and added it to the mixture.  Also added cayenne pepper, 3 fresh garlic cloves and 1T garlic powder, 1 or 2tsp salt, 2T brown sugar, and a 4oz can of diced green chiles.  Went with the advice of another reviewer who wanted to kick it up for spiciness, but her recommendations were WAY too high when she suggested adding 1T cayenne pepper.  I used 1tsp and it was way too hot, and we like spicy food.  Next time, I'd bring it down to 1/4 to 1/2tsp.  I drained my beans, and so did not find the chili was soupy as some experienced, but as a result of the too-spicy effect, I did add 3 extra cans of beans and a medium can of tomato paste to tame it a little. I recommend "squishing" the tomatoes as they don't break down in the crockpot process.  I did use black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans for a little variety and that was a nice touch.  The red wine addition added such a nice flavor to the dish.  Served with French Baguette from allrecipes and had a lemon sorbet for dessert with a touch of lemoncello to cool off our palates! ;-) Thank you, Wendy!

I have learned from making chili recipes off this site that I do not care for the taste of red wine vinegar - to tangy for chili - personal preference - depends on what kind of chili you like - I like spicy and meaty tasting chili - not tangy.

I knew this chili was going to be good because it has cumin in it. That ingredient, in my opinion, is a must for good chili (the basil also added a little something extra). I do not think more meat is necessary at all. 1LB of meat is plenty & this recipe has a nice soupy consistency.

I omitted the celery & the red wine vinegar (didn't have any).  I added 1 onion, 3 cloves of garlic, & 1/2 tablespoon of crushed red pepper (for a little heat). This chili is delicious & will offer a nice alternative to my meatier chili recipe this coming winter. (lil hint: I normally squish stewed tomatoes thru my fingers to break them up before adding them to the pot. I thought the slow cooker would take care of that but I was wrong so will presquish next time)

My first time making chili!  Thanks for the easy recipe, the flavor was fantastic.  The only changes I made was 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black bean, 1 can pinto beans, just to mix it up.
The texture was a little soupy, anyone have ideas on how to thicken it up?  Otherwise excellent recipe!

I added extra chili powder and cumin, as well as a half can of beer and this recipe was wonderful!  a definite keeper.  I made it in a crock pot and it was nice to come home to the aroma!

Wasn't a big fan of this one, and I have made more than a few batches of chili in my day. I think the red wine vinegar was not a good addition and that this recipe could benefit from some more spice/ingredients. The red wine addition wasn't bad, but it could not save this chili by itself. Mine came kind of sweet and spicy, but something about the aftertaste just didn't settle with me. Also, use diced tomatoes instead of stewed, unless you like tomato quarters floating around in your chili.

This is the best chili I have ever had. It was easy to make. My kids love it because it's more like a stew, and my husband loves it and took leftovers to work. His co-workers raved over it.

This chili was fantastic!  To bring down the 'heat' a bit I cut the chili powder to 1 tablespoon and added one can tomato paste for more density.  Best chili I ever had and so EASY to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know what the people did that state this dish has no kick? I think they have no tastebuds! I love my chilli hot and this certainly has a huge kick and plenty of flavour, very tasty indeed. I stuck to the recipe here and it was lovely, next day was even better.

TIP.
For those that found it had no kick. Throw out your old chili powder and buy some new chili powder - it can lose all its heat and flavour when stored for a month or more!

D'uh!

(Thanks Wendy this is a lovely recipe)

Excellent recipe!  Like others, I added 2 tsp. of brown sugar, more chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I also thickened the chili using two tsp. of corn starch.  My wife loved it! My recommendation is to also make Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, an excellent recipe from allrecipes.com.  It's easy to make and can easily be done while the chili is cooking in the slow cooker.  Good luck!

This chili was wonderful. I brought it to a mixer and it was a huge hit! I did make a few changes though. I suggest you make this one day before serving. It really taste better the next day! 

I did add some onion and diced green chili with the celery and red bell pepper. I sauted these all together with seasoning salt and garlic before putting them in the slow cooker. I also fryed the meat with garlic and seasoning salts and drained all grease before adding to slow cooker. I cooked it on low for about eight hours. Then I let it cool down and placed it in the fridge to eat the next day.

Note: Give yourself a few hours for it to heat up again in the slow cooker. It does take a bit to heat up again once it has been in the fridge. You want it to be plenty hot by the time 
dinner starts!

I LOVED this recipe. I used regular stewed tomatoes and left out the cumin because I didn't have any on hand. It's really easy to make and tastes delicious. It's easy to add some kick by increasing the amount of chili powder or adding a bit of red pepper flakes. I also thickened it with two tablespoons corn starch dissolved in two tablespoons water. So good!

This has been a staple in our home for a few years now and we LOVE it!  I have made it as is, I have substituted things when I didn't have the exact ingredients (red pepper for green pepper, red for white wine, worcestershire sauce and salt for soy sauce), etc and it has always came out so yummy!

This was a great recipe but I changed it somewhat for my husbands liking. Instead of the Mexican-style stewed tomatoes I used 2 cans of tomato sauce to make it thicker. Instead of the red bell pepper I used two Serrano peppers to make it extra spicy. I added some minced garlic and left out the red wine because I didn't have any handy! It turned out wonderful! The peppers make it very hot, so beware if you aren't used to really spicy things.

This was excellent... My family and I have wanted chili for a few weeks now and it was delicious, Im 9 months pregnant with my 3rd and I get nauseous easily but I ate 2 bowls of this! And my kids are super picky and loved it!  Though I use one less can of the mexican style tomatoes, they were a bit hot for my kids :-)

An awesome chili recipe, it is now one of my favorite all time chili recipes. I added a small splash of Tabasco sauce just to give it a little kick, almost everything taste better with a splash of Tabasco. I also replaced one can of dark red kidney beans  with one can of pinto beans, just for a little color, (and besides I only had 2 cans of kidney beans on hand.)

We are not chili people but I needed a new recipe for the crock pot so I tried this one. We all loved it, I thought it was even better the next day! Like some other reviews I have to have onions and garlic, also I like adding the brown sugar. Very good!

This has been our favorite chili recipe since I first found it in December of 1999.  I make it every Christmas Eve!  It makes the evening hassle free.  I do everything pretty much to the recipe.  I often forget to put the wine in and it still tastes great!

I was craving chili & this hit the spot! I actually prefer my chili on the soupy side. I did have to add hot sauce cause I like it really hot!  It was really good, however, it's not quite the chili I am in search of. It's a great start though, I might experiment with it & who knows I could possibly make it "the one"

For any chili recipe, I always add a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up!  And I always usechopped onions!

tasty!  I used 1 can dark red, 1 can black and 1 can pinto beans.  Also, a chopped onion and 2 large cloves of garlic, and at the time we had just a red table wine to put in.  Tasted very good!  Oh, and only 1 T. of chili powder.
Made it again and used 1 can of RoTel tomatoes, 1 can Italian stewed tomatoes and 1 can diced.  A can red kidney beans, 1 can, red beans and 1 can pintos.  Also about 1 1/2 T. chili powder, onion, red and green pepper.  Delicious.

I couldn't follow this recipe exactly because I didn't have the red wine but that was the only thing I left out. I got mixed reviews on this one. Me personally I thought it was very good but my husband did not like at all. He said it was too sweet tasting. Kids weren't all that impressed either but they did eat it (loaded with crackers and cheese) where my husband would not take another bite. I would like to try it again for sure but maybe change it up a bit.

I spent years working as a cook in a restaurant that specialized in both green and red chili, and this is awfully close to the recipe that we used.  Couple differences:  use white pepper instead of black, add a small can (maybe 6 oz) of golden corn, and add about a Tbsp of chopped garlic to the beef for a the last few minutes during the browning process.  Excellent recipe, and nearly foolproof.

This one is a non-starter.  At 6 servings the yield here is 2-3 oz meat per serving and 7-8 oz of beans per serving.

I have been using this recipe for a while and I think it's the best I've ever had.  I reduce the red wine vinegar to 1-2 tablespoons, and I add a whole sweet onion.  I'm really into the flavor more than "heat" and this one has great flavor.  I normally make this on the stove top instead of the crock, and I have used ground turkey or pork sausage and it comes out great either way.  Thanks for this GREAT recipe!

Fantastic flavour and so easy to prepare!  I browned the meat the night beforehand and put it ready in the slow cooker with all the other ingredients so had to just flip the switch in the morning.  We came home to a fabulous smelling house and a wonderful, healthy meal.  Will be making this one A LOT!  Thank you!

We expected to like this, but sorry to say, I've liked my husband's chilis made with a mix better than this!  We added onion and garlic, and left out the vinegar (all reviewers' suggestions), but it was still missing something important.  Very disappointing.

This is a great recipe for the slow cooker (though I must confess I didn't follow it exactly)! I used only 2 cans of tomatoes and beans, substitued one can of chili hot beans for the kidney beans, added some granulated garlic and a chopped up jalapeno for heat. I also added only about a quarter-cup cooking wine, and no other wine or vinegar (I'm personally not wild about the flavor wine gives food). I didn't have any trouble with it being runny - though I also drained my kidney beans just in case. I also used green instead of red pepper for some color. 

I would not hesitate to make it with the full 3 cans of tomatoes and beans next time, I was just concerned about it fitting in my crock pot. I also suggest using pre-chopped tomatoes, then they are already a nice size for eating. Great recipe, easy, filling, nutritious!!!

Made this in my crockpot for a barbeque and it was a hit! Make sure your lid is slightly vented so everything can cook down properly.I made mine overnight and in the morning it was very soupy. I just removed the cover and let it cook for another hour and it was perfect!

Great recipe! I added a chopped onion to the ground meat. Also added a can of diced mild green chilis. Made for a superbowl party - and everyone asked for the recipe. Topped with grated cheddar, the best! Make a day ahead, tastes even better.

Fantastic Chili, have made it numerous times and always have loved it. I have learned to cook it longer, add three chopped chili's or jalapeno's and wait to late in the cooking to add the wine. Can't get enough.  Update for 2005, I've also added more beef the last few times, doubling the amount and I've also doubled the wine.  Love it.

UPDATE
Have been making this now for years. Two years ago my wife and I became vegetarian and I now use Worthington brand canned veggie burger in place of the ground venison I used to use.  Brown in pan just like burger and add to chili.  People eating it have not realized it was not ground beef.

Excellent Chili, however, I add a large can (52 oz) beans (drained) use a potato masher to crush some beans when the wine is added and stir it up, this helps thicken it, so it's not so soupy. Increase spices by about 1/4 measure and add at least two whole chopped jalapenos. A little extra wine doesn't hurt either. I have made it numerous times and still love it. My wife loves it too.

Great recipe for a busy day!  I substituted Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage for the ground beef, and it was great!  The sausage and the wine added great flavor!

I just made this for the second time.  This time I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian Sausage.  It was Great!
I highly recommend this recipe, especially with the Johnsonville sausage --It adds such great flavor!

This was loved by the whole family. I though it was spicy enough using the exact spices listed.  I used 3 different kinds of beans and skipped the vinegar. I also added a bit of brown sugar to tame the kick. Served with sour cream, onions, and shredded cheddar. YUM.

The longer you cook it the better! I strongly suggest nothing less than low for 8 hours. High on 6 leaves the meat too tough to taste like authentic chili

This was good! We used ground turkey, used both green and red bell pepper, 86'd the red wine vinegar, and added corn (our kids love corn). We also used a bit more than a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Aside from that, we followed the recipe exactly. Very satisfying, everybody loved it. Served with a dollop of sour cream, some minced onion and shredded cheese, sliced avocado, and cornbread. Yumm-o!

This was my very first ever homemade chili... It was very filling.went good with a garden salad (even my husband likes it) I only had 1 can of the stewed tomatoes (which was not mexican style) so I added some tomatoe paste and mix that in..... now i can have left overs as well

Awesome!  This recipe won me top price at my company's annual chili cook off.  There wasn't enough to satisfy the demand.  Great stuff!

Have to say, my family and my co-workers love this chili, with some variation.  I eliminated the red wine and vinegar completely.  I use the Course Ground Beef instead of the regular.  This gives it chunkier and thicker texture.  Because I like to experiment, and we like spicier foods, I decided to double the spices.  This made the chili fantastic..  I also added a small can of tomato paste to thicken the chili somewhat.  It's fantastic on those cold weekends or if you need to bring something for a potluck at work.

Awesome chili recipe! I am not a big cook, but this is a very easy to follow recipe. And it made my house smell so good! I served it in bread bowls. Delicious, highly recommended! Myself, my husband and our friends would've liked it to be more spicy, so next time I will add a little cayenne pepper.

Made it the first time at my son's 3rd birthday party.  It was a cool day, and I set up the crock pot outside on warm setting with sour cream, chopped green onions, and cheddar cheese as toppings.  It was GONE in like 20 minutes!  Absolutely delicious.  I always make it with ground turkey, and it just feels so healthy and filling.  The wine is really key.

Although the flavour is terrific, this was too soupy for our liking.  I scooped 4 cups of liquid from my double batch, because we had to travel with it.

I doubled the recipe and cooked it the day before. Refrigerated it and reheated. It was excellent. I used 1/2 ground meat and 1/2 cubed meat. Had to add extra chili powder, but that is personal preference. It is great that you can do it in a slow cooker, and just let it go. Thanks Wendy.

I would definitely leave out the vinegar and reduce the wine--the finished chili had a weird sweet/acidic taste that I didn't like. I couldn't find Mexican-style stewed tomatoes, so I just used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and that worked fine.

My husband made this chili, for the first time, with only a couple of changes, and it was great.  Since we are Weight Watchers, he used extremely lean ground beef (less points) and added some minced onions and a couple of chili japones.  I took a sample to work and it received rave reviews. Thanks

We made this chili pretty much as written, except that we realized at the last second that we didn't have red wine vinegar, so we subbed white wine vinegar instead. My husband is a little picky and likes his chili more traditional, so as we were making it he mentioned that he didn't think he'd like it, but he ended up loving it as well! It's definitely a unique flavor, but it's a nice combo of sweet, tangy and spicy. Next time we'll probably use the diced Mexican style tomatoes, but other than that we won't change it!

This chili wasn't bad, but it was pretty meh. I couldn't find Mexican style stewed tomatoes, so I just used regular stewed tomatoes and added 2 little cans of diced green chills. I think the stewed tomatoes were a mistake. This chili tasted sweet and bland, which big chunks of tomato. It would be better with Rotel style diced tomatoes, and a lot more seasoning.

Tried this recipe for the first time today, just because it was different. Cut the red wine vinegar in half and still a little too strong, and I like red wind vinegar. Also, changed the parsley to oregano, I prefer the taste. All in all, an okay recipe, but I can see that further experimentation (add some cheese, maybe a little brown sugar, so many other ingredients are raising their heads!) is required.

I made the recipee for 12.  Received three persons for dinner.  With Michele and I we were five.  Laid the chili on a bed of rice.  They loved it.  And we have four frozen recipients good for three to four persons each.  Great recipe.

This chili was not my cup of tea.  The vinegar made it taste too sour, I thought.  Vinegar lovers would like it, though.  I'm just not one of them, I guess.

This was good, but the spices needed to be enhanced.

I used a bulb of garlic, 1 tsp salt, 2 T Brown Sugar, 4oz can of green chili's hot, 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1 onion.

Even though I added the ingredients above, it was still not enough.  I added more spices and Worcestershire sauce.  Even then, my fiance still added more chilli powder at the table.

If I make this again, I will triple the ingredients.

I ended up making this on the stove top and it turned out pretty good.  The red wine vinegar left it a little bit too tangy for us so I added some beef bouillon to give it a little meatier flavor and that seemed to counteract the vinegar to suit our taste.  Will definitely make this again.

Used frozen tomatoes in place of canned, used green bell peppers in place of red. Used frozen parsley in place of dried. Added 1/8 cup beef broth and 1 (4 oz) can tomato sauce.  Added some small sliced onions in last 2 hours of cooking after pureeing. Pureed the bean mixture towards very end. Also added some green chili (about 1/4 cup) from a local restaurant.  Lined a bowl with tortilla chips. Placed chili on top along with a dab of salsa, some cheddar cheese and a dab of sour cream. Also added a sprinkling of lettuce and a leaf of cilantro. The chips gave back the texture that was removed upon pureeing and added a lot of flavor.

This is the greatest chili recipe!! It is a little different than my traditional recipe and it has almost a sweet taste. I do add twice the meat and use black beans, kidney beans, and pinto beans. All the different beans make it interesting. I also add some cayenne pepper since we like things HOT! This chili freezes well, we had some this weekend after going to the pumpkin patch along with the Homesteader Cornbread from this site. Even the kids liked it!

I made this exactly as the recipe says...LOVE IT!!  I almost excluded the wine so I wouldn't have to open a new bottle, but I'm so glad I didn't...it adds so much flavor and depth to the chili!  Delicious with my cornbread and cinnamon/honey butter.

Perfect! One of our favorites and will be making this again. I added half pound of spicy sausage, large chopped onion and five cloves of garlic to the sauté mix. Also, as per the review of Jill, I added the following ingredients:

2T Garlic Powder, 1T Cayenne Pepper, 1T Salt, 3T Brown Sugar, 2T Honey, and 1T of extra Chili Powder. Oh yeah, a suggestion to thicken up the chili is to use 3T of Corn Starch with 3T Water.

Served with Marie Calendar’s Corn Bread.

Normally I use the recipe titled "Slow-Cooked Chili" which we all love in the house and I tried this one for a change of pace. For this recipe I omitted the beans, and at suggestion from other reviewers added garlic and onion, used tomato w/mild green chiles. Cooked in a crock for 8 hours on low. It turned out quite bland. It does need extra kick and heat. If there is a next time I would add about 1/4 tsp cayenne. Not sure what else but it does need something. I may go back to my other recipe and add the cumin and red wine +rw vin to that one. It didn't work out for me but ty for the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe!  I have used it for a couple of years now, and keep adapting it when I feel saucy.  I wanted this to be as healthy as possible, so here are the changes I made: Added 6 large carrots, sliced, replaced two cans of kidney beans for two cans of black beans.  Also to change the spice, I take different peppers (jalapeno, habenero, serrano, etc) make a slit in each one and cook them with the chili.  I remove them before serving and it adds a nice hint of spicy to it.  This is such a great recipe for chili that can be modified or is awesome on its own.  The red wine is probably what does it. =)

This is really good chili. My husband and I both loved it. I will make this again, though next time I will probably use a little bit less worchester sauce.

This is such a yummy slow cooker chili.  Everyone who has tried it loved it.  I used venison in mine and actually used almost 2 lbs - my hubby likes his chili really meaty.  It was absolutely delish.  Just made up some corn muffins to go with it.  It smelled so good cooking all day!

Not bad! I omitted the wine vinegar and doubled the chili powder and it came out very well. This chili had a distinctly sweet flavor. Next time, I will leave out 15 ounces of beans and add at least 1/2 lb more of ground beef. It was a bean-heavy, meat-light recipe so if you like a meatier chili, definitely add 1/2 lb more beef.

I liked the tang of the vinegar!  I couldn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't have all the ingredients on hand) so made the following adjustments:  2 cans red kidney beans & 1 can  black beans (all drained & rinsed), 28 oz can plum tomatoes and 1 can Ro-Tel (I like chili spicy!), orange pepper rather than red, 1 onion (couldn't imagine chili without an onion!), added the red wine at the beginning since I thought I'd forget it, and did forget to put in the Worcestershire sauce. It was very attractive, tasty, and easy!  Will make this again!

My husband won a chili cookoff using this recipe, hands down!  The only modification he made was to add a little pasta a few hours before the chili finished cooking.  This chili smells so wonderful while it's cooking that the real challenge is in actually waiting until it's done!  Thanks, Wendy!

Made this for some friends at a pumpkin carving party in October.  This is an excellent recipe.  I made some modifications.  Skipped red wine vinegar and used some old wine I had for cooking.  I also used 3 different beans (kidney, Chili, and plain vegetarian beans).  Finally, I recommend adding some Frank's Red Hot to taste.  I think I threw in some powdered cayenne pepper.  I love my chili HOT!

I was quite disappointed in this recipe.  There seems to be too little meat for the amount of tomatoes and beans and the chili seasoning was rather pedestrian.  Now I'm from Cincinnati, so my viewpoint is suspect, but I've had much better flavored chili.

I made this the other night and its a keeper for us!  I did not add the red wine vinegar as the others said, I did not see how it could have added to it especially after I tasted it.  Not sure what to do about the liquid though, the first day it was almost souplike but the next day it was nice and thick.

Awesome!!! Love the wine! I just buy those small one serving bottles so I'm not wasting a whole bottle( im not a red wine drinker). I add a ton of garlic, 2 tbl spoons of tomato paste, a bay leaf, a jalapeño  pepper or two, onion, cayenne pepper, paprika, and a zucchini.  I serve it with fresh cilantro, lime, sour cream and cheese. The best chili I've ever had!

Made this chili as per the recipe, no changes.  If you try it right out of the crock pot, it is a little bland. It taste better the next day after the flavors have melded.  Also, I froze the chili in 2 cup increments using plastic containers and I am still enjoying it 3 months later.  I defrost the frozen chili in the refrigerator then hold it one more day after it is defrosted.  Excellent taste.

I made just a few tweaks to this recipe.  I like a meaty chili, so in addition to the pound of ground beef, I added a pound of stew meat.  I left out the red wine and vinegar and added an extra can of tomatoes to make up for less liquid (I used diced instead of stewed tomatoes).  I also added a can of diced green chilies.  It was excellent!  I froze some for later meals and it's even better than the first time around.

This recipe is amazing, all the comments about it tasting better the next day are spot-on!!  It was absolutely delicious, although I accidentally put the wine in immediately instead of the last 2 hours.  I will try that next time.  I think I might also add some onion, and it was a bit TOO "beany", so I might reduce the cans of beans by one.  Honestly, though, it was great as-is.  Big hit in the house!

With just a few adjustments, this was the best chili we have ever made!  I added 1/2 of a medium-sized onion, 3 garlic cloves (which I cooked with the beef),only 2 cans of stewed mexi-tomatoes and beans (I used a tri-bean variety, it had red kidney, pinto, and black beans), just a splash of the red wine vinegar, and 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper (it could have used the whole pepper, or substituted another variety).  It was divine!

Thought I'd experiment and try this in lieu of the chili recipe the family loves.  Disappointing!  No punch, and this is even after we added two of our own garden-grown dried chili peppers (which will usually save ANY recipe).  Recipe was also done long before the time given for the slow cooker.  Will not make again.

I followed The basic recipe fairly closely. Even to adding the cornstarch and water for thickening however we did Add 1 teaspoon of cayenne,some additional Kosher salt, A can of Rotell diced, mild, tomatoes plus the two cans of stewed tomatoes; a tablespoon of additional cumin, an diced , browned onion, with a dash of LOVE! A great recipe !!!

We loved this recipe! I made it exactly as described. My only change was substituting ground turkey for ground beef as we try to avoid red meat. I did not mash the stewed tomatoes as some suggested nor did I thicken it with cornstarch.  It was perfect! We liked the seasonings & thought it had just enough heat. My husband raved about it! This is definitely a winner in our house. Thanks for sharing it!

This is a great base recipe in which you can put your own twist on.  Here is what I add/change to the original recipe.

1 - chopped onion
1 cup - bown sugar
1.75 lb ground beef instead of 1
1 - can black beans instead of 3 kidney
1 - can chili beans instead of 3 kidney
1 - can kidney beans instead of 3 kidney

I tried this recipe - adding from other reviewers - 3 Tbsp. vinegar, 2 Tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 Tbsp Cayenne, 3 Tbsp. brown sugar & 2 Tbsp honey.   This is the absolute best Chili recipe you will ever make. 
No one - but no one can top this.  NO restaurant can begin to touch it.  The title "The Ultimate Chili" - is 100% on the mark.

I always read reviews first, but seeing nearly 5 stars I just went for it.  MISTAKE.  If you read all the positive reviews most have added additions to them, too.  We love chilli and are not in any way chilli snobs.  I like to try a different recipe each time and usually even the worst recipe is still alright.  This was just... odd.  The celery was pointless.  I didn't really taste it in there, so it was an added step.  No tomato sauce made it very watery, more like a beef soup broth instead of the thicker tomato base of most chilis.  No onions was just sad.  The stewed tomatoes were WAY too big.  The small amount of chili powder was very lacking.  Picture a bland chili in beef broth with giant tomatoes.  I saved it by adding tomato sauce, onions and tons more chili powder.  There was an under lying weird taste to it.  I'm thinking it was the red wine vinegar or the red wine.  It was edible before my additions, but I'd never ever make this again.  My chilli loving husband who will eat any kind of chili in a can with a smile tasted this and said it was gross.  Yikes!

I've been making a "signature" chili for years but made this for the family one day to mix it up. My wife immediately said it was her favorite, haha! Really good, acid really works. And just because there's no heat doesn't mean you can't bring it.

This was awesome. My ground beef pkg was 1.6 lbs. I omitted the bell pepper because I don't like them, added half a large diced onion to the beef when browning, omitted the red wine, cut the chili powder to about 1/2 - 3/4 T, and added about 3/4 T of white sugar. I didn't have Mexican Stewed tomatoes so I used petite diced. I also added a small can of Tomato sauce. I didn't have any canned beans so I used a bag of dried small red beans that I cooked in plain water the previous night. This really hit the spot!

Really good chili, just a little soupy.  I took the advice of one reviewer and made it a bit more spicy and everyone loved it.  Also tried adding the cornstarch to thicken it up, but it wasn't nearly enough.  Might add less liquid or add more cornstarch next time.  I also used ground turkey.  Try this with the Mexican Cornbread recipe!

I loved this recipe! This is my first time making chili. I read the suggestions and the changes I made were I used 3 diffferent types of beans: Black beans, Jalapeno Pinto beans and Kidney beans. I also used Rotel tomatoes for the Mexican stewed tomatoes (same thing, smaller cuts of tomatoes) to give it kick and added garlic and onion when sauteing the meat. I didn't drain my beans because I like my little a little soupy. I had no red wine vinegar or red wine, but added half a bottle of beer. My husband LOVED it and asked my to double the recipe and make it for his work! THANK you for a great base!!

I think it is a great recipe, but my complaint is that my slow cooker cooks in half the time that the recipes call for.  If anyone has an answer for this, I would appreciate it as the makers of my unit cannot explain it.  My suggestion is keep an eye on your unit.

I don't add as much brown sugar, maybe just a sprinkle at most.  I add more of the spices too. Everyone loves my chili! I serve it with buttermilk corn bread.

Very easy and really enjoyed it.  Did use a mix of beans and slightly increased the vegs.  Did add some tobacco.  At the end a bit soupy so keep the lid off the last hr and that did the trick.  This is NOT a spicy chilly and has a bit of a sweet touch with good depth of flavor.  The wine does really make it. If looking for spicy, I don't think trying to spice this up hot would work very well with the tough of sweetness and wine.

This was my 1st attempt at making chili & it was wonderful. I changed it a little however. I used lean ground turkey instead of beef. I added white onion & sauteed the onion & celery in garlic & olive oil before putting it in crock pot. I used 1 can of black beans, 1 can of pinto, and 1 can of red kidney beans to add variety. I added 1 can of green beans, 1 can of corn & 4 oz of green chiles. I used only 2 cans of mexican style stewed tomatoes. I cooked it on high in the crock pot for 3 hours. Then served with diced white onions & grated cheddar cheese...yum!

This is the first chili my kids have ever eaten.  I was a little wary at first about adding the vinegar and red wine, but wasn't able to taste either once the flavors came together.  It had a nice, mild flavor, so if you like it hot, you'll want to add your own heat.  Only changes I made were to add only 2 cans of beans and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  Thanks for a great simple chili recipe!

This was great!  High is protein and fiber low in fat.  I added Cayenne Pepper, Crushed Red Pepper, extra cumin, 2 clovers garlic and onion.  The entire rest of the recipe was followed and it wasn't liquidy.  I also cooked on the stove top.  I topped it off with shredded cheese and sour cream.  I also had French Coconut pie for desert!  YUMMY!

My family and I absolutele LOVE this slow cooker chili recipe!!!!  I did alter it a bit, though.  Instead of the three cans of kidney beans, I used one can kidney, one can black and one can garbanzo beans and omitted the red wine at the end of the recipe, as it was juicy enough.  BOTH my picky children ask for leftovers as a chili frito pie.  It's ever-so-easy!  I highly recommend it!  ENJOY!

Very good. Not a lot of fuss. Just good ol' chili. I also omitted the vinager, but kept the wine. I think the wine gave it that little something extra.  I also added onion and garlic, which I cooked the meat in (I used ground turkey). Next time, I will add more garlic directly to the pot. I will be making this chili again, probably for my next football party.

Very good. I added zucchini, carrots, and some other veggies sneak them into my husband's dinner without complaints :-) but it only made it better. This is my new chili recipe.

I substituted 3 cans chili hot beans for the kidney beans, and 3 cans chili tomatoes for the Mexican stewed tomatoes. I also used 1/2 Lb sausage and 1/2 Lb ground beef the result was excellent.  The only minor complaint was it could have been a little thicker.

I made a few changes...added 1/4 cup flour & water mixture to thicken the chili, used lean ground turkey breast, and then let it simmer in a dutch oven on medium for 45 minutes.  This chili hit it's peak of tastiness 5 days later so this is a great leftover dish! VERY YUMMY!

I adapted this recipe to our preferences. I eliminated the red wine vinegar and the wine. Added a chopped onion when I browned the ground beef and drained the grease. Also I added a heaping Tablespoon chili powder. We like celery & bell pepper, but if I’m out of it, then don’t really miss it. Also, I sometimes substitute 1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes for the diced. When I use diced, then I try to “smash” them more so the tomatoes are less chunky. But this is a great base recipe for chili.

It's my go to chili recipe!  Usually increase recipe:  meat x 4, rest x 3 except 2x peppers/wine, to have leftovers, always increase chili powder adding more just before serving.  This recipe has won 4 friends/family chili cook-offs!  Everyone loves it!

I tried this and liked it very much. As with many dishes everyone has their own preferences.  My additions and deletions to the recipe might not be to everyone's taste. I sample the dish before I serve it and add whatever I think might appeal to my family. If there is an ingredient we don't like I don't add it.  For example, I cannot tolerate garlic, therefore never use it.

Really like this recipe! I like the use of the red wine vinegar to brighten up the dish. I'm also a big fan of cumin. So, I tend to be generous with it. Just yesterday I made this chili but used a Belgian stout instead of the wine.
**Just an update to advise not to be tied to the 6 hours in the slow cooker. Since the meat is already browned, you don't have to cook it that long. You can make this on the stove top. Just let it simmer for an hour or so. The longer time in the slow cooker will definitely give you a deeper flavor, but it's still delicious! The longer time also cooks down the veggies so I saute them in a little of the beef drippings before adding.

This was delicious. Only change I made was instead of all kidney beans, I used pinto, northern and kidney.  It is a soupy chili which was just what I was looking for.  Served with corn muffins it made an excellent meal on a rainy, dreary night.

I would give this recipe 5 stars for flavor, but we like our chili a little thicker. I added 2 cups of cheddar cheese to thicken it up a bit and it came out great.

I love this Chili recipe.  I used to make my chili from scratch and it was pretty  good.  This is so easy and has a really good flavor.  I love that I can put it all together in the slow cooker and then go fishing for a few hours.  I come back to a kitchen smelling so good it will make your mouth water.  Great job!

Wasn't crazy about this one.  Something about the combination of ingredients gave it a weird taste and aftertaste.  But hey, that's the great thing about chili; you can always tinker with it!

This is just an okay recipe. I realized after simmering for a bit that the tastes just weren't there and had to modify it so much that it became another recipe entirely. I have another recipe I like much better, I thought I'd give this a try but it didn't cut it.

Excellent Chili! Loved the wine vinegar and red wine for the extra flavor..... We fixed this chili for supper bowl Sunday..and served it with tortilla chips and guacamole we felt complimented the chili very nicely. This chili moves to the top of our list for our chili recipes.

Any chili recipe will have a great deal of flavor and spice if you use some pork chorizo added to the ground beef.1/2 pound pork chorizo fried a long with the ground beef in this recipe would work well.Beef chorizo would work well all so.I like using pinto beans for my chili.If you like bean burritos use this recipe a long with some green whole chiles.Add chiles when pouring beans into the tortilla.You can freeze the burritos for the micro wave,after school snack for your children.Did this for years until children grew up and left home.

Thank you for sharing for your recipe.  I did not have all the ingredients for the chili so I improvised.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 3 cans of dark red kidney beans, 2 fresh jalapeños (no seeds), garlic and onion powder, and 1bottle of chili sauce.  Oh, I added 3/4 of a bottle of beer. I took the advise from another viewer. And if you are wondering what happen to the rest of the beer.....it was put to good use.  Bon Apetit ;)

I made it for mine and my husband's 5 year anniversary and he said its better than anything he's had before. Needless to say this will be the recipe my children grow up on. Its also really good with chicken. Just need two big size chicken breasts. Just cook them up before and rip them apart using two forks.

I added a dash of cinnamon and a few thai chili peppers- but aside from that I wouldn't change a thing.  Dumped all the ingredients into a slow cooker and left for work.  Came home to the most amazing chili- the red wine and vinegar definitely give it a nice and different kick!!

Where's the garlic, hot sauce or onions etc. ?

This is a fantastic basic chili recipe and is not spicy, so you can add what you like as you go. I added 4 sweet italian sausages (out of casings and browned) and used 2 28-oz cans of tomatoes. It's a hit!

I made a couple of adjustments and forgot the vinegar, but it turned out AWESOME! Only did 2 cans of beans - 1 dark red kidney bean and 1 chili beans in chili sauce, and used "Chili Ready" canned tomatoes instead. I'm guessing that because I used already seasoned beans and tomatoes, it didn't matter that I forgot the vinegar.

Never made chili with red wine vinegar. Does red wine vinegar actually have any alcohol content? Also does anyone know what would be a suitable substuit for red or white wine in recipes?

Good basic recipe but too many flavors fighting for attention. no HEAT. Gotta have some heat! Leave out the basil and add a little fresh finely chopped cilantro.
If you don't have fresh tomatoes and peppers try using "Rotel" tomatoes to suit your taste.
This not a competition chili but is easy to make and experiment with.

This chili was outstanding - the next day.  When I ate some the day I cooked it, it tasted like there was something missing, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  But, I am having the leftovers now for lunch, and wow!  Perfect!

This recipe is great, this was my first meal ever cooked in a slower cooker and it came out perfect. Although next time I prepare this I will be adding more spice! I did modify the recipe slightly by only using 1 can each of the kidney beans and stewed tomatoes, also I added 1/4 a sauteed onion, 1 spoon full of diced chilis & 1 spoon full of jalapeños. I did this because I could not find "Mexican-Style" Stewed tomatoes.

This chili is so flavorful and unique.  I've been making it for a few years and have tweaked it a little bit by adding a 1/2 tsp. of garlic and substituting beef broth for the red wine.  I found it was a little bit too sweet using both red wine vinegar and red wine.  I still use the red wine vinegar and it's perfect!

I thought this was a really good chili. however I did think it was missing some spice. So next time I will try making it adding 1 diced jalapeno. Also drain the beans before adding them in the pot, Hopefully that will help the chili to not be too waterie. I also used ground turkey in place of beef.

Excellent!  I first made the recipe exactly as written -- it was the best chili I've ever had!  The wine adds a deep richness that is just delicious.  I've made this recipe several times, and sometimes I didn't have all the ingredients (ex: celery, bell pepper) -- it's still good.

Love this recipe. I've made it dozens of times, but always with ground turkey instead of beef. A hit with a crowd. Not spicy, so i have Tabasco and chili flakes at the table for people who like it hotter. Serve with cornbread. yum!

Not my favorite chili. It was good, but the red peppers added a sweetness that I'd forego in favor of a more robust, hearty chili.

I followed Jill's advice and added the extra seasonings and the corn starch to thicken it. It was great, but a little too spicy for me! Maybe next time I'll cut back a little on the 'heat' or just follow the original recipe. :)

I am a vegetarian and this is so delicious made veg-style!  Instead of the ground beef I used Morningstar Farms Veggie Crumbles.  I sauteed the crumbles with onion and garlic.  I also added some summer squash and used kidney, black and chili beans.  Since I have kids and they don't like spicy things, I only used 1 tbs chili powder and that was plenty.  No one else in my family is a vegetarian, but you cannot tell that real "beef" isn't used.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good, just enough spice and heat.  I did some adjustments.  I used red beans instead of Kidney (personal preference) and did 2 lg cans of tomato sauce and 1 large can diced tomato's w/chiles, but added spices as directed.  I left out the wine, again personal preference. will keep intial recipe, thanks.

really good chili, with some additions and subtractions.  way too many tomatoes, i ended up spooning out a lot of them.  i added cilantro and two cans drained black beans.  i also cooked the hamburger with onions and added crushed red pepper added some kick.  overall wonderfull recipe will be using in chili cook off tommorrow, wish me luck!

Excellent recipe with a little bit of personal tweaking depending on taste.  I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious but next time I will try using one can less of beans and maybe more ground beef.

To many beans, to much vinegar taste, not enough heat. Add 1/2 pound of burger, eliminate wine vinegar, add a couple fresh diced jalepeno.

This chili was edible, but nobody wanted seconds. Next time I will omit the wine and add more meat, and more chili powder. Like a previous review, it was missing that "kick" that big chili lovers want. I also used half the amount of tomatoes, which helped. It's a good recipe, just change it up to your personal taste and it's really quite good.

This is a great chili recipe.  I follow it pretty closely, but I cook the beef with some chili powder, cumin and onions to give it more flavor.  I've made it several times and my husband says it's the best he's had.

This is a great chili recipe. I have used it as a launching pad for making my own recipe to use to compete with my friend who claims his is the best chili! Each time I make it it tastes better. It also freezes really well!

This was very good.  I only used 2 cans of Mrs. Grime's Chili Beans as we don't like that many beans in our chili.  This had a nice, well-rounded flavor and the correct consistancy for soup.  Thanks for a great recipe, Wendy.

Very good chili!  I used ground turkey rather than beef, 2 cans of kidney beans and reduced the rest of the ingredients by half.  I too noticed the chili to be a bit "liquidy" so I added an equal amount of cornstarch to the red wine, which was chilled, to thicken it a bit.  I also added 4 dehydrated asian thai hot peppers for a spicier chili.  The chili turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

love this recipe make it frequently.  I like to add an onion and some chili peppers or even jalapenos.  And if I'm looking to make it nice and hot I add crushed red pepper.  It is a lovely, easy chili recipe.

This chili was excellent and easy! It is sweeter than most, but I like it like that. My fiance likes it spicy, so he added hot sauce to his and he loved it as well. The only thing I'm going to change next time is to delete the celery...my fiance feels that celery just doesn't belong in chili. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't think it was spicy, even after adding 2 jalapenos and the called for chili powder.  All of the slow cooking mellowed it very nicely.  Next time, I'll leave out the vinegar and wine, keep the onion, garlic and green chilis I added, and double the jalapenos and add a little habanero for more kick.  FYI, my wife loves it and cannot stop raving about it the way I made it.

My husband and I loved this chili.  I made a couple of changes though.  I only added one stalk of celery instead of two, it seemed to be plenty when I was chopping it.  Also, I used ground turkey instead of beef and used mixed chili beans which had kidney beans, black beans and pinto beans.  I omited the red wine vinegar but still added the wine.  At the end I added 3 tbls of corn starch to thicken it. The house smelled so good by the end of the day, you could even smell it from the garage!  Very tasty chili!  My husband already wants me to make it again :)

I'm a novice cook and this was so easy to make. This receipe was great with a few modifications.  Per people's reviews I deleted the red wine vinegar.  I added 6 oz of mushrooms, a head of fresh garlic (I love garlic, make sure you mince or chop it up real fine), added two more dashes of Worcesterershire sauce and corn starch.  You'll have to just add corn starch until you get the consistency you want because without the corn starch it is really soupy. I added the wine at the onset.  I don't think it ruined anything.  Next time I'll add the wine the last couple of hours and see what it taste like.  I'm not a chili fan but my husband is and we both thought this receipe was great.  I also cooked cornbread and crumbled it into the chili and it was awesome it made it a sweet/spicy chili.

This makes a wonderful chili! I'm not a big fan of the beans, so I added elbow noodles about an hour before the chili was ready instead of beans. Has an excellent flavor!

Wow!! What a great chili!! I did omit a couple of things(only because I didn't have them on hand) which was the wine, vinegar, and celery. It didn't matter the chili was awesome!! I took someone's advice and added a little sugar. I cooked it last night, put it in the fridge overnight and then put it in the slow cooker all day. My husband kept raving about it!! Thanks!!

I've made it twice, added mushrooms the second time also had to substitute mixed chili beans since the store was out of kidney beans- EXCELLENT!  (Adding a half of habanero helped add kick too but be careful!)

I thought this recipe was great.  I cut back about a 1/2 TBS. on the Chili Powder because I don't really like hot food.  I also made it once using Chicken and it was great.  Super easy and smells great in the crock pot!

I love the ease of preparation for this recipe, but the flavor was too sweet for our taste.  I am hoping that it really is better the next day!  If I make this again, I will need to adjust the seasonings to make it a little spicier and will include fresh onions as well.

I have yet to find the "perfect" chili recipe but did enjoy this version.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added some garlic powder and brown sugar.  This was good after an hour of simmering, but the longer it sat, the sweeter it got.  I do not recommend adding the sugar as I did, unless you prefer.  I chopped up one onion and threw it in with the beef and used one less can of beans and tomatoes.  I cooked this on the stove-top rather than the slow cooker. I did add a few splashes of Frank's Hot Sauce and a can of chopped green chilies to spice it up a bit.  My father-in-law, who is very easy to please, had a bowl and really enjoyed it.  I topped each serving with shredded cheddar cheese.

This is a killer chile.  I use too old wine instead of vinegar, and lots of it.  Needs extra chiles for my taste.

I’ve used this recipe several times, and it’s one of the best out there. I always double everything and freeze some.  Following the recipe as is, does the job, but I like to add stew meet as well, and a bit more spice to give it an additional kick.  Definitely a five star Chile in my house.

I have been making this chili for years and make it exactly as stated but I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. I have also made it with ground venison. It gets rave reviews every time and has won chili cook offs! I serve it Texas style with shredded cheddar and sour cream with a side of whole wheat beer bread. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!!

It looks gorgeous however the taste is meh. It is probably because I had to leave out a few items.. the wines, the beans, and the parsely &basil. I had it in the crock pot for about 6 1/2 hours and I started smelling its taste about an hour in. Very easy to make!

I stayed pretty true to this, but substituted ground turkey for the beef, and balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar.

Also I left the celery out because it just felt wrong.

I did not use a slow cooker for this recipe, just a large wok. I fried the hamburger, onion and garlic added the remaining ingredients let the chili simmer for a while for a great winter meal.

This was delicious and not too spicy. But the stewed tomatoes were too big and chunky for my family. They ended up picking them out, and no one really wanted the leftovers. If I make it again, I'll opt for diced tomatoes or blend the stewed tomatoes.

This is a great and easy recipe. The only thing I changed is I used celery flakes instead of celery (2 tablespoons). I have made this many times and it is always a huge hit.

I love chili! This recipe is wonderful! Thank you!! I’ve made it many times now!! I omitted the celery (not a fan) used ground pork instead of burger, added  sautéed baby peppers in 3 colors because it’s so pretty, 3/4 cup sautéed (frozen) corn, some beef bouillon (equivalent of 2 cubes, but used the  “Better than bouillon” variety) for flavor depth and a nice heaping tsp of sambal oelek for some heat . Garlic is a must with ev.ry.dish... I added 2tsp minced, sautéed with 2 diced sweet onions! I always pour in some extra red wine because, hey...it’s wine!!

I wasted a lot of ingredients making this.  It sounded good except for the red wine vinegar, but I made it verbatim, because sometimes the person who posts  the recipe knows something that I don't. It was a mistake! Why? Why would you add red wine vinegar? It just gave it a terrible taste that I could not fix. Had to toss the entire batch out.  No one liked it and it takes a lot for my family and friends to criticize my cooking. 
 Please note that I am an old guy who has cooked quite often for many years and different chili is my passion.  I wanted something new, not something yucky.

Loved the ease of this recipe and the great chili taste. I left out the wine entirely and didn’t miss it.  Also after  noting that many previous reviews said the recipe needed more kick I added a tablespoon of my new favorite souce - smoked paprika.  And added chopped onion because I love onions.  End result was fantastic!

Although the flavor was good, I wouldn't call it chili.  It was more of a stew.  And not that great of a stew.

Added a bit more spice to kick it up and I used random cans of beans from my pantry - Good basic recipe - loved the additional tang of vinegar - I'll be using that trick in other chili recipes.

I guess I was brought up thinking a good chili was a spicy one.  This one doesn't cut it for me.  I added sriracha and onion for a bit of a kick.  It could also use some garlic.  I cut up the stewed tomatoes into bite size pieces.  The wine added an undesirable after taste IMO.  Except for the wine, my bride likes it.  She isn't a spice person.

I did only one can of beans, added onions and a lot of garlic, but this Chili is a hit! I was skeptical, how can you have Chili without tomato sauce, but that has been my complaint for a while, Chili I had been making only tasted like tomato sauce., no matter what else I was adding, so I decided to try it.  So glad I did. Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing.

I sautéed a diced onion and threw it in the slow cooker. I also used beer instead of red wine vinegar.  I ended up adding more spices at the end. Thanks for the recipe.

Chili recipes are easy to manipulate a bit.  I used this one fairly close.  Left out the celery.  Two of the three cans of chili ready tomatoes were 10.5 oz,, so I threw in an 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  Mixed up the beans - one can black, one red kidney, one chili ready kidney hot.  Everything else the same.  Turned out very good with just the right amount of heat.  Keeping this recipe!

I made it today and it was a hit. I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow!??I made some personal taste changes:
No red wine vinegar or wine, peppers or celery.Added lots of garlic, onions and heat ( cayenne, chipolte flakes, plus the hot chili pepper)and added some farm corn.

Tasty! I left out the red wine (simply because I didn't have any), and I added a purple onion, 2T brown sugar, 2T honey, and some minced garlic. I also sautéed the celery, red pepper, onion, and garlic together in a little olive oil before adding it to the rest of the chili.  Very simple to make and very flavorful! I will definitely be making this again.

I used only one can of tomatoes and  one can beans and halved all the seasonings and it was perfect for my family of  5. I also cheated and made it on the stove top in 30 minutes, but I can imagine it would have been even better if I would have cooked it the way I should have. Great easy meal.

It was a good recipe on its own. I added Italian sausage and extra chili powder for more flavor. I think it needed more kick. I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Thank you for the recipe!

Just had a bowl. Yummy!! I used 2 cans beans that was plenty. I used 2 cans of regular stewed tomatoes. No wine vinegar and no wine. My own preference on those. I'm happy with this chili.

The red wine vinegar base does add a wonderful flavor. I'm having difficulty finding "Mexican-style stewed tomatoes" at Kroger's (they do carry "Italian-style stewed" - have to check some other outlets like Wal-Mart) so I had to substitute Rotel diced with habaneros/green chilies).

the vinegar and wine sound like strange ingredients, but, this is an absolutely wonderful combination of flavors. It is a milder chili, and having a mexican husband, I thought it wouldn't be hot enough, but he loved it too. This recipe is a keeper!

This chili was very flavourful. I substituted 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar because I didn't have any. I didn't have Mexican tomatoes so I added about a 1/4 cup of salsa to my diced tomatoes. I will be making this again!

Made a few alterations to the recipe by adding 3/4 of a yellow onion (1/4 to the ground beef before cooking,  1/2 straight in the crock pot), a diced shallot and a small handful of crushed garlic cloves (whole). 

I used a packet of chili mix in addition to the chili powder the recipe called for as well as a couple sprinkles of garlic powder when the meat was cooking. Then I added some spicy pork sausage to cook with the ground beef.  In the crock pot I also added a packet of tomatoe, basil mozzarella chicken meatballs (cutting each into halfs), along with 2 bay leaves; then I let it all simmer in the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  

To top it off once in serving bowls I sprinkled the chili with 4-blend Mexican cheese and a dollop of creme fresh. It was absolutely fabulous!!!

This chili is very simple to make as after browning the ground beef, you put everything in the slow cooker. I love making it ahead of time and coming home to the smell. It's got a really good taste to it, and if you add all the suggested ingredients has enough kick for me. However, I reduce the amount of chili powder because my kids don't like foods too spicy. I find it a bit watery for chili though, so if you plan on using the liquids ie. red wine vinegar and the red wine, I'd drain most of the kidney beans and tomatoes before adding (maybe just have one can with the liquid but drain the rest). I agree with another review that stewed tomatoes are a bit chunky so go for diced instead.

The Ultimate Chili Haiku: "I'm with Crabby here. Red wine vinegar, no thanks. Killed the taste for us." Everything should've been perfectly good in this chili (and I try to aim to make a new chili recipe nearly every week, so I'm always on the prowl for new and unusual ways, or ingredients, for preparing it), but the red wine vinegar was just too much for us.

First time I made chili and really loved it. I added half an onion, 3 garlic cloves, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, a dose of honey and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It was a little spicy for my wimpy family but perfect to me.  It was soupy as others mentioned but tasted great!  Next time I'll probably drain the beans and tomatoes before adding them.  Was going to refrigerate overnight but we ate most of it immediately!  Thanks for the great recipe and all the comments that helped me out.  Will definitely make again.

We actually make this a little different and we are in love with it!! We add three or four cloves of garlic and we don't simmer it for six hours so we skip the red wine. We cook it for maybe 45 mins not counting the time it takes to brown the hamburger. It has the most delightful sweet taste to it. We also use one can of Rotel hot with habaneros. SSSSOOOO GOOD!!

For anyone who does not use the wine in this recipe because of being unable to find an inexpensive bottle that tastes great, may I suggest BAREFOOT brand.  I believe this wine is one of the best on the market, and it has several award winners, yet it is under $10.  I was taught by a friend of mine that anyone can buy a great bottle of wine for over $50 but it takes talent to find a great bottle for $10.  You will not be disappointed using and drinking this brand.  It is delicious.

Not sure I'd term this the "ultimate" chili, but it was good.  I have a hard time conceiving of chili without onion, so I did add that, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. The wine and the touch of vinegar added a nice touch. I did find this needed more seasoning, but that's a personal taste.

I made this as described except I used celery flakes instead of fresh celery (I really don't like chunks of stuff in my chili).  I ran the pepper and tomatoes through the food processor.

The chili was very well received by the family and looks like our new "go to" chili recipe.  It is has a little heavier tomato flavor and personally, I would go a little heavier on the chili powder next time, but everyone else liked it the way it is, so I guess I'll leave it alone, other than adding a little more meat.

I don't know how much everyone else eats, but we had 4 adults and 3 kids eat this last night and probably still have 4-6 bowls left, so I don't know that I believe that it is only six servings - there are six cans of beans and tomatoes alone!

Great recipe.  I used fake meat because I am veggie.  I used a green pepper, instead of red, and replaced one can of kidney beans w/ black beans because that is what I had on hand.  I also added some green onions because I had some that I had to use up.  I also drained and rinsed the beans.  I only cooked it for 3 hours before serving because I got a late start and didn't think my family would be happy waiting until 9 for dinner.  My 7 year old daughter loved this recipe and ate two big bowls full and said it was the best chili she has ever had.  This is definitely more than 6 servings.  I have plenty left over for dinner tomorrow.

Maybe I shouldn't give this 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but that was because I didn't have all the ingredients and just used what I had on hand.  But this recipe was the base for some of the best chili I have made in awhile so I'm giving it 5 stars.  Changes I made: 2 pint jars of home canned plain tomatoes, 2 cans of beans (one kidney and one cannellini), 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar and added some onion and garlic, no red wine or bell pepper. And after I browned the ground meat (used venison), I used the pan to saute the onion, garlic and celery in a little olive oil before adding to the crock pot.

My first time making chili and I was looking for one that I could use as my template. I didn't make mine very fancy, skipped the wine and added onion and garlic. Turned out thick and very yummy!

I'm very happy with how it turned out :)

Sorry, but I found this recipe to just OK for chili - I've had much better. I made it exactly as written, using 93% lean ground beef, and cooking on "high" for 6 hours. I found it fairly watery (the recipe didn't say whether to drain the canned vegetables, so I didn't). I also thought the addition of celery to chili a bit odd, and the omission of onions to be a big minus. The red wine and red wine vinegar flavors might have been a plus in a better recipe, but here they didn't help enough.

This is is good chili, I made a few additions that I feel move it into a five star- one onion diced, a small tin (213 ml.) of tomato sauce to make it less watery and more tomatoey, a few dashes of hot sauce, and a tsp. of ground chilies. I made this for a group for a football game afternoon, it is perfect for that along with corn bread or a bowl of nacho chips. Thanks for the recipe, Wendy. I liked the addition of cumin, which wasn't it other chili recipes I've used.

This chili was great!  I used a little bit of oregano along with everything else and gradually added more cumin, chili powder, and oregano as I went.  I will definitely be trying this again.

This is an excellent chili. Our church family enjoyed the slightly sweet flavor when I served it at the fellowship dinner. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, I did not add the vinegar, added more than a dash of Worchestire, and substituted Rotel diced tomatores/green chiles for the stewed tomatoes. Highly recommend for a cold evening.

This recipe is so easy and quite delicious.  I made a batch for after trick or treating last Halloween and it was quite a hit.  It's perfect on a crisp fall evening with a hearty beer or robust red wine.

This is perfect chili!.  By that I mean that all the flavors are perfectly balanced; you can taste everything and the long ,slow cooking gives that wonderful depth of flavour.  If you want spicier, you could add, if you want meatier you could add, but as it is it is the best chili recipe my family of 'Foodies' has ever come across.  THank you so much

I made this for my husband and he loved it! I even liked it and I am not a chili person. It's not very spicy so if you wanted that you should add something to spice it up. I used more meat than the recipe called for and added some salt, because it was a little bland without it.

This is THE BEST!!! I only added 3 cloves chopped garlic and one medium sliced onion while browning the beef, drained it, then added two jalapen`os and two 4 oz. cans of Ortega chiles while cooking. And it's true; every day afterwards, it tastes better. I'm making it again this week-end. Wonderful, wonderful. Thanx, Wendy. A real keeper!

Ooops, didn't have a bottle opener forgot to add the wine. I don't think it would have mattered much anyway, beacuse this chilli was very juicy, it wasn't thick and hearty at all. My friend and I weren't very pleased, my roomate thought it was great though.

this recipe is awesome! i've made it many times. the flavour is great. though i do leave out the vinegar and red wine. and i add onions, garlic and cayenne pepper to get a really hot chili. also adding some cornstarch near the end is good too to thicken it. i cook it on the stovetop and it works great.

I followed others' advice: omitted the vinegar, and added mushrooms, onion, and garlic. On day one, it was ok.  After sitting overnight, it was AMAZING!!!  Without question, make this the day before!  A keeper.

Outstanding!  After 15 yrs. of making my same old chili recipe, I've finally found one I like better!!  This was terrific!  I did not put in the vinegar because other reviewers found it to be to bitter, but did add the wine.  I also uses crushed tomatoes instead of mexican and added 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

This chili was average for me, not bad but not the best. I used 2 x 19oz cans of the beans and 1 28oz can of the diced tomatoes rather than stewed tomatoes. I also substituted ground turkey for the ground beef. I like mine REALLY spicy so I doubled the chili powder and cumin and added some crushed chili peppers as well (if I had added any more it would have been too much).

A bit too spicy for us, and we usually like spicy.  Next time I'd cut down on the chili powder.

I doubled this chili and served it at a party. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe.  I love the extra taste the red wine brings to this chili.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe but I used Turkey instead of ground beef. I also used some pintos that I cooked the day before instead of the kidney beans. Flavors are well balanced.
