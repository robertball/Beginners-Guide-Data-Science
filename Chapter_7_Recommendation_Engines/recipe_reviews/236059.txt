I was very disappointed.  I expected it to be moist, but it was pretty dry.  I won't be using this recipe again.

Very moist. Lots of flavor. Used the chocolate chips and low fat cream cheese too.

I would probably add more banana and add some vanilla and cinnamon the next time I make it.

I found this recipe in a Southern Living cookbook several years ago. It's the ONLY banana bread/muffin recipe I make now! I think the cream cheese keeps the bananas from turning brown. So, not only is this recipe fantastic tasting but it looks really good too!

I sprinkle about a 1.5 tablespoons of sugar on the top before putting it in to bake. This gives it a crunchy top. We love it.
