My fiancé, son, and I enjoyed the recipe. The sauce is great on it's own. However, I was out of onion soup mix (which I always have!). I used The Dry Onion Soup Mix recipe since I had the ingredients on hand - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Dry-Onion-Soup-Mix . I was sad that my small town grocery store didn't have any boneless pork shoulder roasts in stock (or anything similar to substitute), so I substituted boneless/skinless chicken thighs. It wasn't my original intention to use chicken, but it turned out awesome! It was very easy to shred and the guys in my household enjoyed it. The sandwiches are even tastier with raw onion slices and pickle slices (if you like). Great to stuff in a loaded baked potato the next day, or in a quesadilla with cheddar and a few black beans. The filling really works (and it would with the pork as well!). Thanks!! :)

It was good, but a little bland. Makes a great base for a sauce, but I added extra garlic and onion for more flavor. Plus I needed to add salt. It was sweet, but needed something more.  Overall with the changes it was good.

I wanted so much to love this recipe. It smelled so good while it was cooking, and of course, it was really easy. It was just so sweet, though! Way too sweet for me. My hubby and friend didn't like it either. I gave it three stars, though, because I love the cooking method and the general idea. I would suggest adding less brown sugar, though.

Great Recipe! I needed a pork barbeque recipe for an upcoming family reunion. I also needed to feed 30-40 people. Lots of flavor and very easy to make! Put the pork in a crock pot, mix up the ingredients listed and let it cook for 7-8 hours. It pulled a part with a fork. Have one more roast to do and then will freeze it for next month! Will use it again!

Excellent! I accidently pulled a beef roast out of the freezer but it was delicious. Tangy and flavorful. I was a little short on ketchup but had a little leftover pizza sauce so used that.

This was just a bit on the sweet side otherwise a good recipe. Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar and up the hot sauce a little.

Great fast dinner for a family on the go.  I used three tenderloins and cut the brown sugar in half to match the cider vinegar amount.  I wasn't too sure how much 1oz onion soup mix was so I used 2tbsp.  I chose to prep the night before so the meat marinaded over night.  Then I cooked on low for 10 hours. My toddler and schoolage kid both approved.  4 stars due to the minor changes to the recipe.  This is plain recipes but the taste was perfect.

All in all, this is a good recipe for pulled pork that even a novice cook could pull off with ease. I normally use Coke or Root Beer to add to the pork in the crock pot to tenderize the meat, so using the apple cider vinegar was new to me, but it worked well.  The pork fell apart after about 5 hours on low in the crock pot.  The sauce was a bit thin, so I added some barbecue sauce to the buns to give it some "oomph".

This was a great recipe... I only made minor changes... half cup ketchup/half cup bbq sauce and instead of apple cider I used balsamic. Also I only used half the brown sugar.

I added FAR more sauce than the recipe called for, seemed kinda looking dry in the crock pot and it turned out good.  Save the sauce to pour over the meat when serving, that kept it moist

This is seriously delicious!  I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup bbq sauce and then reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also seasoned the pork with pepper and garlic powder.  Super yummy!  Highly recommend!

Turned out very good and tender! My changes to cut down on the sweetness from the reviews: 1/4 c more ketchup, 1 onion, jalapeños, and 1 small can green chilis. I set my crockpot for 10 hours on low, left it alone; perfect! Will definitely make it again!

I didn’t have a pork shoulder or butt, so I used a larger pork loin knowing it could turn out a bit dry.  

I almost wish that I would’ve added some extra water to compensate for using a loin instead of a shoulder or butt.  

Actually, I was pleasantly surprised in that after shredding the pork and mixing it into the sauce it didn’t seem as dry as it originally looked.  

I served it over a baked potato that I’d previously put butter and cheese on and it was quite yummy!!

Next time I’ll use either the pork shoulder or butt.

Made according to recipe except reducing brown sugar as recommended by many reviewers.  It was pretty good but for about the same money could get better take out from local bbq joint.

First time trying the recipe. Turned out amazing!!!!!!! 
The only thing I would add would be real onions since I didn't taste the onion soup mix at all.

Used diced onion instead of onion soup mix. Personally we prefer saucier pulled pork but the flavour was great!

Made it as is. You have to watch the amount of fat on your roast or it will over whelm the flavor.  We used the Hawaiian sweet roles as our buns.  Very good. I am making it again tonight  with a mac n cheese recipe  we found here.

I use BBQ instead of ketchup.  Much better flavor.  Also used pork loin country ribs, rather than park shoulder.  Makes it easier to pull or eat right off bone like normal ribs.

Made this for the family yesterday & everyone enjoyed it! I added salt, pepper & a clove of garlic. I also made a horseradish mayo to put on the sandwich as well. It was incredibly easy, smelled amazing in the house all day, & nothing beats "set it & forget it" I love slow cooker meals! I will def make this again...
