This is the best recipe for red beans & rice on this site. It does need tweaking for your individual tastes, though. To make these red beans taste like the ones I grew up on in Louisiana, I did the following: Omitted the jalape√±o. Cut the bell pepper by half. Used a generous amount of Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning. Subbed chicken broth for water & cut it down to 7 cups. Used the back of my spoon to smash up enough beans to make the whole pot creamy. Must! Use! Andouille! even if you have to order it online this is the ONLY way to get the authentic and unique flavor of the sausage right.  Regular sausage just isn't seasoned the same way or contains the same amount of spiciness. My central Texas grocery store has started carrying it, as does Whole Foods and other "specialty stores". I only had ham scraps instead of a ham hock but the andouille adds smoky flavor so I didn't miss the hock. Normally I'd use both the andouille & the ham hock.  For those omitting celery, you really need the "holy trinity" of onion, celery & bell pepper to call it authentic. Mince it finely and sautee it first if you have to.  Me, I just do a fine dice on the veggies and let them cook down in the pot.

This isn't a Louisiana recipe, must be from Texas--jalapenos?? never!  My mother cookd red beans & rice every Monday, always two bay leaves (left in the pot) whoever got a leaf was lucky.  Usually there would be sausage in it, but if had been a good week we would have fried pork chops. There was no such thing as Creole seasoning back then, if you wanted it hot you add Louisiana Hot Sauce (not Tabasco) to your bowl not the pot.  Red beans were usually cooked on Mondays so mothers could do the laundry without worrying about what was cooking on the stove.

In N'awlins, everybody has her own touch for red beans and rice, so whatever works for you is great.  They are ALL creamy, though, accomplished  by smashing beans as noted by several folks.  Most restaurants serve smoked sausage on the side and season the beans with ham or a little andouille. One tip--don't add the salt until the end or it will prevent the beans from getting soft.

If you can't find andouille sausage, smoked keilbasa is a great substitute.  We always add a bay leaf or two to our pot of beans.  
Got to have the bay leaf....

Good recipe.  I like slow cooker idea.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been looking for a real red beans and rice recipe ever since I visited New Orleans a couple months ago. This is the closest I have found to what I had there. I liked it much more the second day. Next time I will make it a day before I want to eat it. I also had to add more spice (cayenne pepper) to get the heat my family likes. Other than that, this is an excellent recipe that I will definitely make again!

I live in Louisiana and have never attempted to make red beans..this recipe tasted so good and just like all the red bean recipes here in Louisiana! Next time I would cut the water back to 9 cups, it was a little thin but the next day it thickened up. I also would not cook te sausage ahead of time and just put in the crock pot and it will cook up in there. I added just a little cajun seasoning for an extra kick! Thanks for the great recipe I will be making for years to come!

This is really a pretty good recipe.  I adjusted the spices to suit my families taste, and made a couple of substitutions due to location and price.  I subbed hot sausage (from Hillshire Farms) for the andouille sausage, and I used ham boullion instead of a ham hock.  My only thing is that in the slow cooker the thing would not thicken- so I ended up pouring it into a pan and simmering for about 20 minutes to reduce the liquid.  Next time I'll just use less liquid- probably more like 7-8 cups of water.  Over all though it is a really tasty recipe that is pretty forgiving when it comes to adjusting here and there for your own taste.

Tasty, with some nice bite to it, but has too much liquid. I used 1/2 lb beans and 4 1/2 cups water, but next time I'll use only 3 cups water.

this was the first time that I made this recipe. It was very good but only because I read the reviews first. I only added 8 cups of water which was stock from the turkey meat that i boiled before i added it to the crock pot. and i substituted pork for turkey

A little too bland for me.  I added chopped green onions and celery.  Threw in some cayenne and white pepper too.  Served with Tobasco on the side.

I really like this recipe and changed only a few things due to what I had available and some of the recommendations from other reviewer.  I used 8 cups and liquid (3 cups chicked stock left from another slow cooker dish and 5 water).  I used Conecuh sausage as I live in Alabama and that's the norm here ;).  I used dried herbs and minced garlic and of course a lage amount of Tony Cachere's Seasoning. No jalapeno or ham hock but the sausage more than made up for that.  I found that after 8 hours the mixture had not thickened well enough and I placed in a pot on the stove for 10 mins and it was perfect!  I really wish I would have made 2 lbs of beans because these were gone so quickly!  ENJOY!  Tip for rice:  Add a large amount of water to the pot with a few splashes of vinegar.  Wait until this mixture comes to a rolling boil THEN add your rice.  Mix to make sure there is no sticking but the rolling boil combats that.  Cover and your rice will be done in less than 15 minutes and will be perfect!  My grandma taught me this and it is a perfect no measure, no mess, no screwup method for a newbie like me.

This was my first ever try at making Red Beans and Rice, and it turned out great!  I did leave out the jalepenos, as my children are not spicy eaters, and I used Italian sausage instead of Andouille (my grocer didn't carry the Andouille).  It still tasted wonderful.  I think next time I will try adding some crisp bacon, as a friend of mine does in hers.

Tremendous! I don't know authentic, but I know delicious... I've always loved red beans and rice and this is the best I've ever been able to make at home. Ten cups of water is way a lot.  Seven or Eight would do it.

Wow this is an amazingly delicious recipe! I did not have any sausage, so I used one lb of ground beef. Also, I used a hambone with lots of ham left on it in place of the hamhocks. Another reviewer said to mash up some of the beans to add to the creaminess and I am glad I did that. Next time I will reduce the water to eight cups as mine was a bit watery. I added two tablespoons of New Orleans Seasoning and one tablespoon of chicken bullion.

I followed this recipe just to see if there was something I was missing. 
1. It doesn't contain the Trinity of cajun/creole cooking; celery, onion, and bell pepper. That should be a major red flag to anyone reading this. I guess 2 out of 3 aint bad?
2. Red beans don't have jalepenos in them. Don't know where they got that from. If you want them hotter, you use hot sauce when they are served.
3. This is way too much water. One pound of beans cooked on a stove top would use 8 or 9 cups, and you can expect to use less in a crock pot. This recipe didn't come out creamy, but rather soupy. 
4. That isn't nearly enough meat. All recipes call for a pound of sausage for every pound of beans. No one will complain that they got an extra piece of sausage.

I do not know what I did wrong....I have never used dry beans in anything so, when it said soak overnight I assumed it meant for about 8 hours...did it mean 24 hours?!? I soaked for almost ten hours and then followed the directions exactly...21 HOURS later with the slow cooker set on low, my beans were still pretty hard.  I cranked it up to high and left it for 2 more hours, then the beans were edible and actually not bad. However, after all that time, the meat - well lets just say the meat was interesting. We just picked the meat out and ate the beans with rice. Way too much time for something that should be easy....

Other than using the quick soak method on the beans, I followed the directions exactly as listed and did have to slow cook it on low a little longer and raise the temperature to high with the lid off for the last half hour as recommended.  We liked it but I needed to add a bit more zing.    Second attempt:  We like spice, let's emphatically state, we like heat and herbs so I did double up on Tony C's Cajun and the fresh basil at the start.   We adjusted the seasonings the last half hour - meaning added more of everything to taste.   I also used thick bacon (3 slices crumbled) along with the sausage and a left-over lamb leg bone instead of a ham hock.  I cooked the veggies in bacon grease before adding it to crock pot.  For the liquid, I used half chicken broth and half beef broth.  This was my second stab at this old favorite and I have to tell you, it was delicious.      I feel this basic recipe is very good and with our special family touches, it rises to excellent.

I did not care for this recipe.  It was bland, tasteless, was sort of grey in color, pasty and had the consistency of gruel when done.  There was no flavor at all and the rice turned to mush.  I was so disappointed!  Scratch this one off the list!

Forget about the stars, read the reviews.  Everyone who rated this 4 stars made drastic alterations to the recipe.  I made it as is (with the exception that I cut down the water), and ended up with bland, beans in water.  The beans do not cream at all, and there's no spice.  As recommended by other reviewers, I put this on the stove for awhile to let the water boil out.  I also added hot sauce and some more spices.  It ended up edible, but nothing special.  There are so many other red beans and rice recipes available, skip this one.

This was a little bland to me. No one in the family really liked it. The sausage added nothing to the flavor, and there wasn't enough ham hock. It was very watery, even reduced to 7 cups of water. And 8 hours on low did not cook the beans. I had to put it in a pot on the stove and boil it for about an hour to reduce the liquid and finish off the beans.

I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this....it smelled pretty beanie while it was cooking....but it was FANTASTIC! Like others have already said it is pretty watery but the broth was delicious. My 9 year old had 2 helpings. The only substitution I made was smoked sausage instead of andouille. I will definitely make it again!

I think I'd use the Authentic Red Beans and Rice recipe submitted by Miami Beach instead of this one if I were to make it again.   Far too watery, and sausage was overcooked in the broth.   The other recipe calls for less water (I substituted chicken broth), and to put the sausage in over the last 30 mins which I highly recommend!  Sausage was like rubber by the time we ate it.

Too watery.  Maybe would be better to specify 6 -7 cups water instead.

Great recipe I added 3 oz of Tasso (southern smoked pork) which added a lot of flavor and used 4 cups beef stock(2 beef boullon cubes) and 4 cups water.  1 tsp basil. The Tasso and andouille sausage really make the recipe.

I would say this was certainly a healthy dish, but bland. A little too much water too.  The good thing is you can adjust this recipe to your taste.

10 cups of water is way too much in this, and I didn't even use that much.  I had to turn my crock pot on high for over 2 hours after I got home without the lid, AND add flour to thicken it up a bit, and even that didn't help much.  However, this does have potential.  I used about 6 cups chicken broth, and 2 cups water as the base, I used smoked sausage b/c it's what we had on hand that I needed to use up, and I left out the jalapeno.  Lastly, I used 2 bay leaves, and omitted the basil b/c it just seemed more authentic that way.  I am thrilled with how it tastes, and will make it with my changes again, however with less broth/water.  Maybe a total of 5-6 cups.  If I made this as written, I would probably rate it less (so I guess I'm cheating) b/c I don't think the basil would be the same as the bay leaves, and I think the broth added a lot of flavor, but with the changes I made I am giving it a 4 even though I would like it less "soupy".

Should have read the reviews.  Made as written except for doubling the creole seasoning.  Needs way less water and much more in the way of seasoning.

These were some awesome red beans.  I made no substitutions, except for how long they cooked in the slow cooker; and that's only because I forgot about them and fell asleep.  They cooked for like 13 hours on low and were super duper creamy!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good.  I omitted the sausage since my ham hock was very meaty.  I used some cornstarch to thicken at the end.  Very good and authentic.  I might try to cook the rice in with the beans next time.

it most definitely can't be authentic of it doesn't have the holy trinity of onions, green peppers and celery. And I have never seen an authentic Louisiana Red Beans and Rice Recipe that had either basil or creole seasoning in it. Authentic cooks don't use creole seasoning mixes, they use the individual herbs and spices.

My Crock pot must be smaller than most because i could only use 4 cups of water, after adding the ingredients. I didn't really change anything except the andouille sausage. I remember the last time i ate this sausage it was like eating a lit match!!!(just a little too hot for me) so i used smoked sausage and kielbasa. Turned out great!!!

This is a good recipe!! I did do a bit of tweaking -- used tinned kidney beans, drained/rinced well; added diced celery; then used oregano, thyme and bayleaf in place of creole seasoning. I also used hambone left from Sunday dinner bone in ham -- worked well. I also used half chicken broth, and half water. Finally, I cooked rice nite before, then added to crockpot when I got home. Turned on high; then while the Jiffy Cornbread was cooking -- rice combined with rest, got warm and was perfect. Husband said -- "this is very good; please make it again!" and then helped himself to another bowl.

Being a Nawlin's Girl this is definitely authentic, but I do add to it,based on my family's recipe to make it the right flavor for me. I add the following: onion powder, minced garlic, finely chopped celery, celery salt, a pinch of thyme, a pinch of cayenne pepper, hot sausage (new orleans style or hot links if that's all I can find). I also mash the beans a bit at the end, which thickens up the roux. This is a definite rainy day or Sunday Supper meal!!!

Normally I find recipes to be a bit bland, so I double up on the spices. This recipe in my opinion is the same. Making this once a month for Sunday's dinner, we add both smoke n beef sausages when I am unable to find a nice smoked ham hock. before adding any of the sausages I mash a few beans on the side of the cast iron to give it the extra creaminess. and if you have a rice maker I find for the firmest rice the ratio is 1 to 1. that is if your press for time that is. I too am from  Da' South and I tell everyone you used what was available to you in the region, so if you want to add jalapenos to your beans n rice then do so. Its all about ones taste. ENJOY

I like to use Camellia brand beans; they cook like no other and I have never had to smash them to create a creamy 'sauce'.  I add just enough water to touch the top of the beans after everything is in pot.

Salut, cher....j'aime tu! I made this recipe for TrueBlood's season finale and it was on point! I listened to some of the Louisiana natives and used the Holy Trinity and Aidell's Andouille sausage. Also used broth instead of water and did a mix of Creole seasoning and Mrs. Dash....It was awesome! BTW, listen to the others and use only 6 cups of liquid instead of the full 10. Even lessening it to 8 was too much but it did give me extra cooking liquid to use for another dish. Will sooo be  making this again as soon as I can :)

I was looking for a recreation of the wonderful red beans and rice we had in New Orleans.  This nailed it!  I added a couple stalks of celery to the veggies and reduced the water to 7 cups, but the rest as written.  It still was a bit more liquid than I'd like.  Next time I'll reduce it another cup or two, or take off some of the extra at the end to use to cook the rice with.  Make sure you get some good french bread to dip and sop up the sauce with!

We loved this recipe! Made it exactly as directed but had to sub another sausage (jalapeno/chicken) for the andouille and using beef broth for half the water. This makes such a hearty, flavorful dish for minimal effort. I did find it to have way too much liquid and next time I would cut back on the liquid to 7-8 cups. I pureed some of the beans to thicken it slightly and give it some body. The flavor is awesome, thanks Melissa!

Recipe calls for too much water.  My beans never turned "creamy," and I cooked them in the slow cooker almost 24 hours.  Next time I'll only use enough water to cover the beans and a bit.  Other than that, they're delicious!

Oh sweet heavenly goodness of red beans and rice! I used bacon instead of ham (just didn't have any) and loaded up on the sausage (can't go wrong with andouille sausage). Also, add more cajun seasoning and a bit less garlic (unless you're wary of those crazy cajun vampires). Can't wait to make it again!

The flavor is good, but having made this several times now, I too have to cut back on the water, all the way down to 6 cups.

Oooh, mama, this is good!  Just like my ancestors in Looosiana made!  I too, cut the water by 2 cups.  Instead of andouille sausage which is expensive and hard to come by at the typical grocer here in Alabama, we used Conecuh sausage, cajun style, which is an Alabama product.  Not sure if you can get it in other states but it is an awesome substitute and super flavorful.  I doubled this recipe and froze 2 gallons of it for more meals later this season.  Not only a flavorful recipe, but an economical one for a family on a budget!

Ok, this girl is my new favorite cook, please tellm e you have more recipes to put on here!  I tried these tonight, and they were so good I had to get on and review it right away!  I know that red beans and rice is one of those dishes that is personal, and not one size fits all....but this is very close!

Very Good! I followed others suggestions and used 7 cups of chicken broth (home made) instead of 10 cups water.  As I'm not crazy about the Creole seasoning I have found in stores, I made my own using a recipe I found on this site.  I also doubled the amount.  Next time I may triple it.  Also added cellery and used Pasqual peppers instead of green bells to spice it up a bit. Next time I plan to add some prawns as well.

Added about a tablespoon of creole seasoning and skipped the jalapeno. Added hot sauce at the end and mashed the beans some :) really good!

Okay, some of you might just be out of your minds, this was great! I made it with the jalapenos and that added just enough kick so that my younger sons could stand it. I also reduced the amount of water to 3 cups + 4 cups chicken broth. mmmmmhm it was good. Winner!

I've been cooking these for 10+ hours and the beans are still hard as a rock.  I didn't even add the salt or other spices yet.  I can't believe I haven't seen more reviews with the same problem.  My slow cooker works fine.  I used it often.  I'm leaving it on all night.  We'll see how it is then.

this was very savory but i prepared it differently after reading many other recipes. after placing the soaked beans and 2 small hamhocks in the pot i added enough water to cover the beans plus 1 inch. i also added a cube of mexican chicken bouillion, i tsp liquid smoke and 1/4 cup miced garlic. i added everything to the pot but the andouille sausage and cooked on low for 6hrs. i removed the ham hocks, mashed 1/3 of the beans with a potato masher,then added back the hock meat and sliced andouille to cook for 2 hours so it wouldn't get all shriveled up.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this recipe didn't turn out like I expected. I followed all the directions and it just wasn't great. I'm from Louisiana and had high hopes after all the high ratings. This wasn't bad, just not "Authentic Louisiana."

Yum! I used dried black beans instead of red, 1/2 stock & 1/2 water and doubled the spices & this still turned out awesome! Thanks for an easy and great recipe.

I'd take out the jalapenos and put a bottle of Louisiana hotsause on the table to be used by those who want it hot.  Also, I've found that Bay Leaves, instead of Basil makes it all the better.  Other than that, it's perfect!

this is a good recipe, although being from new orleans we always did it on the stove.  but one trick to thick, rich, red beans that restaurants do is when it is cooking watch for the beans to split.  that is about and hour or so into it, maybe more in the crockpot, then add 1/2 to 1 whole stick of butter.  makes a world of difference.

If you soak the beans over night you will probably not need that much water. I usually cook beans with about an inch of water over the top of the beans/ingrediants. If it is too thick you can always thin it when it is done. In a slow cooker you will lose little water during the cooking process. 

Creole seasoning is like Chili Powder no such creatue exists. Make your own if you must have something premade but skip the salt. The skin of the beans can get tough if you salt it to early and ALL commercial creole seasonings contain a lot of salt.

Tried this last week and it was super.  Since my slow cooker isn't big enough to hold everything, I cooked it on the stove in a large kettle on low for about 8 hours.  I did find it a bit salty so will reduce the Cajun seasoning a bit next time.

I followed the recipe. Don't know what went wrong.  Came out quite flavorless & runny.  It had heat due to the andouille sausage I used.  Other than that no flavor at all.  Needed salt.  Was very bland but I could taste the fatty flavor of the hock (which I do not like).  I even let it sit in the fridge overnight to become more flavorful but that did no good.  Mashing up some of the beans may have helped thicken it a bit but it tasted so bad I figured why bother.

This is a great recipe! I used 2 bay leaves instead of the basil, just because we like the taste. I only used 6 cups of water and cooked it on the stove for about 4 hours. The only sausage I had was deer with jalepenos. My cajun seasoning has a lot of salt in it so I didn't add any extra salt. Very, very good. It made a good thick "gravy" for the rice. My daughter's boyfriend loved it and his mom is cajun so he grew up with this dish as a standard in their home. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband always cringes when I pull out my crock-pot because for some reason most things I cook in it taste a little off.  Not so with this dish, it was superb!  I soaked my bean overnight and I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used less water.  I added a bay leaf and I also followed Ernid‚Äôs suggestion of ham bouillon in lieu of the ham hock.   My kids loved it too.  Thanks Melissa for a great recipe.

Substituted turkey sausage, 1 tsp dried basil for the by leaves) and chicken bouillon (1.5 tsp to replace the lost flavor of the ham hocks..)  very delicious, second time cooking this recipe this is now one of our favorite.  Was a great surprise coming home and finding this dish coming together in the crockpot!

I made this recipe yesterday in my slow cooker and it was wonderful!The only thing I changed was to use less water. Highly recommended - thanks for the recipe :-)

I get the broth creamy I add a can of vegetarian refried beans instead of crushing whole beans from the recipe.  Works like a charm also works well with chili which is where I first learned to do that.

This is a great recipe. I used 7-8 cups of waterand transfered them to a pot and heat them on the stove to reduce the liquid.

 I substituted 2-3 stalks celery for the  jalape√±os.I added  more spice, 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning wasn't enough for me.

This was way more than 8 servings.  I thought the water was overkill and the Celery was missing.  If I make this again, I will not include the rice, either.

FYI...  Redbeans and rice has been a Monday dinner tradition since my great-grandmother (probably before even) why? Monday was wash day so while the women spent the day doing the laundry for the week the beans just cooked themselves! Very important to salt at the end Not the beginning. And for creamy beans smash beans on the side of the pot as others have mentioned. No need for cornstarch. Also when serving be careful to not put too much rice. We always had cornbread with our redbeans. Crumble some over the top! Yum! Sjb, Louisiana

Great flavor but the recipe needs some tweaking.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.  So simple to put together.  Ten cups of liquid is WAY too much, though. It was pretty soupy even after I mashed some of the beans.  I had to add corn starch to thicken it up and then let it cook with the lid off for a couple hours longer than the recipe says to get it to the right consistency.  Next time, I'd go with about 6 cups of liquid instead of 10.  I used chicken stock instead of water which gave it a really nice flavor.  I would definitely make this again, just with a few changes.

Modified slightly. 4 cups of water, 1 cup chicken broth since I don't use ham hock. Also use dried basil. Still amazing.

It was good, but 10 cups of water was waaaaay too much. It was like eating bean soup instead of red beans and rice. The next time I make it I will use half the amount of water.

If you're going to accidentally leave your crock pot on "high" for 12 hours, I would suggest that you use the entire 10 cups of water.  Although quite overdone and therefore not at all appetizing in appearance, this meal was absolutely delicious.  I will make it again, hopefully without the crock pot snafu.  It was pretty salty, but I'm not sure how to avoid that as I didn't add any salt.

Recipe is fantastic.  The only adjustment I made was to use chicken broth instead of water and decreased it to six cups instead of 10.  I like my red beans a bit thicker.

Very disappointing.  Even though I cut back on water and added extra spices, it was still watery and blah.  I'll go back to the packaged red beans & rice with andoille and some fresh onions & peppers.

I slow simmered on the stove for about 4 hrs and it ended up very creamy. I had no problems with watery-ness at all. I was very happy with the texture but found that i had to add a lil more seasoning than recipe called for. I think I will make this with chicken stock next time (if there is a next time) Overall it was good.

Very good and easy to make. I used a smoked turkey leg instead of a hamhock and only half an onion was plenty. The only changes I would make next time are: definitely decrease amount of water - I had to transfer to a pot and boil on the stove and add cornstarch and it was still watery.  I also would prefer to cut the sausage into small pieces, and make double the amount because my husband ate it all up!

Great way to use up the Easter ham bone. I pre-cooked my beans first so only added about half the water called for. Also upped the seasonings after reading reviews; some hot pepper sauce, worcheshire, thyme and cayenne pepper.  Also added some chopped celery. I still had to take lid off crock pot last hour so it would thicken a little more. Wonderful hearty dinner!

I added celery. Flavor was good but it was watery - I had to put it in a pot to cook down.  Next time, I would either cut down on the water to 6 cups or cook it on the stove.

My wife was from near to New Iberia, La.  We ate red beans and rice on a regular basis.  She liked to coarse chop some jalapeno pepper along with the bell pepper, onion and a little celery.  She parboiled the slices of sausage to remove some of the grease before adding.  When the beans were softened, she mashed about a third of them to give a gravy-like consistency.  Sometimes  she added a little rough chopped tasso or partially fried sliced salt pork to enhance the flavor.  Everyone (including me) loved her beans.  She also cooked dried white beans in a similar fashion and they were spectacular!

Where's the bean gravy? Too watery! Next time go with 8 cups maybe. Flavor wise, it needed something else, not sure what, since I'm a southerner new at cooking. Plus I would leave out the ham-hock; something about the smell of the ham hock didn't work for me. But I'll try again soon!

Good recipe, yet not specifically "authentic" to Louisiana.  I substituted the basil for bay leaves (only 3) and added celery, but otherwise stuck to the recipe and enjoyed.  I liked the extra touch of heat with the jalapenos.

I added a ham hock, used quality Smoked Sausage and used the Jalape√±o in mine. Was a hit. Lots of thumbs up and "Awesome Job" from guests.

I love this recipe.  I did not use a slow cooker but on the stove top, nonetheless, the recipe was spot on.  The flavor was so lightly spicy and tasted just like the red beans and rice I've had in New Orleans.  I used Cajun style Andouille sausage, a bit spicy, and they flavored the sauce so that I only needed 1/2 of the Creole spice called for.  One tip:  Save the bone from your Easter or Christmas ham dinner and freeze it to use in this and other bean recipes rather than having to go out to buy ham hocks.  The ham tasted wonderful in this dish.

This was delicious. I didn't use any ham hock and I added the sausage near the end. I substituted 7 cups of chicken broth instead of 10 cups of water. This was still too much liquid. I'll try 5.5 cups next time. Also, I left out the jalapeno (only because I didn't have one) and I used Tony's and some extra red pepper. Also, I mashed some of the red beans to make it a bit creamier. Like I said, it was delicious. I don't know if I've found my perfect recipe, but maybe with some more tiny tweeks it will get there.

I made this recipe exactly as is and my family loved it!  A nice bit of heat and spice, but still enjoyable to a couple none heat loving family members.  I think the brand of slow cooker may be the reason some people are finding the recipe too thin.  I have owned several slow cookers and seem to cook hotter than others, hence using up a bit more of the liquid in the recipe.  Not sure, just my guess.

Don't forget the roux, if you really want the no shortcut, Louisiana style red beans. Everyone has their own method of thickening, though. See Allrecipes article, "How to Make Roux, Step-by-Step." Love to read everyone's tweaks to this good, basic recipe!

The one thing my Grandmother taught me about thicker liquid in beans was to a small peeled potato into the beans. I guess the potato acts just like corn starch, because the potato is starchy and thickens up the juice in the beans. The jalepeneos, in my opinion, should be added in individual servings. Thanks for the recipe.

Good stuff. One thing though, halve the recipe if you're going to do this in a 3-quart crock.If you can fit 10 cups of water + ingredients in that size crock, you are a magician! LOL Enjoy this tasty recipe.

I am making it for the second time today.  Just about the best I have ever made the first time around.  Too much water in the recipe so I cut it down to 8 cups this time. I put some green onions in the mix.  I didn't use the creole seasoning mix but rather used individual seasonings of my choice so I wouldn't get the salt. Crock pot cooking works great for this dish.

Another touch I do is remove the ham hock towards the end, cut away the fat, and chop up the ham hock meat to add back to the pot. I suggest adding a bay leaf and about a teaspoon of cumin.  Cumin is a great seasoning for bean dishes.

If you happen to wake up and find you didn't soak your beans overnight it is not really necessary for this recipe. The long cooking time in the crock pot will get the beans tender. If you must, a couple of hours soaking in the morning will work too.

Outstanding, makes a lot four of us ate heartily for two days and we had a full meals worth left after that.  Great flavor with just the right bite.  Did cut the water a touch and added the bay leaves as someone suggested.  Thanks for the recipe. Very good.

Loved it. I did not have ham hock (forgot to buy it when I went to the store) so I used 3 cups chicken broth and 7 cups of water. Also added a red and yellow pepper for color and used dried basil a good palm full. I knew I could tweak it because I made it before following the directions.  Either way is fantastic. Dragonfly

This was very easy and had great flavor.  I agree with many of the reviewers in that you only need half the water the recipe calls for, if you're looking for that authentic red beans and rice texture.  During the final cooking stages, mash some of the beans against the inside of the crock pot with a spoon and it will be perfect.

Mine were a little too watery, so I added a can of Blue Runner red beans, they made all the difference...the beans were creamy, and was not watery at all.  Overall, the recipe was very easy and turned out great.

Too much water - had to scoop out 2 cups, and still put in pot, bring to a boil and cook in rice. It then lost a bit of flavor.

WOW what a great recipe!  I cannot attest to it tasting authentic as I am not from Louisiana but I can tell you my family loved it!  I couldn't get my hands on the andouile sausage and used Conecuh Cajun flavored sausage and still think it was great!!

I‚Äôm giving 4 stars because I made quite a few changes to the recipe.  I didn‚Äôt have all of the ingredients so I made some substitutions.    First off did a quick soak on ¬Ω a package of small red beans (followed the directions on the bag).  In a dutch oven I browned 1 lb Portuguese smoked sausage (doubled the sausage since I didn‚Äôt have the ham hock).   I then set the sausage aside and saut√©ed 1 diced yellow onion, 1 diced red bell pepper,1 diced yellow bell pepper, and 6 cloves of garlic.  Then to the veggies I added, black pepper, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, and Creole seasoning.  I also added chicken stock granules and beef stock granules.   Continued to cook the veggies with spices till tender then added 5 cups of water, beans, cooked sausage and 2 bay leaves, let it simmer and tilted the lid and let it simmer for about 3 hours till the liquid was absorbed and beans were soft.  Mixed with cooked long grain rice.    I cut the beans, rice and water in half since its just me and I don‚Äôt want to eat red beans and rice for a week but left the rest of the ingredients the same measurements if not more and added more seasonings since a lot of the reviews suggested it.  I had also planned to make it the crock pot but ran out of time and went with my trusty cast iron Dutch oven, worked Great!  Will def make again.

Great, great flavor.  However, there was way too much liquid.  I followed the suggestion of putting the crockpot on high without the lid for an hour, but all that did was overcook the sausage.

I'll definitely make this again, but with less water.
