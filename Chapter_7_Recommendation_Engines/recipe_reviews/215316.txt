This was so easy and delicious!  If you don't want to use a slow cooker, simmering it for 1 or 2 hours in a big pot works great.  I also added some sweet corn to the chili.  I served it with sour cream, cilantro, shredded mexican blend cheese and a wedge of lime.  Tortilla chips would also pair well. :)

A little too spicy, by the recipe, for my liking but easily fixed. I also didn't use the beer (gluten allergy) but used a hard cider and it seemed to work well.

GREAT chili recipe! There is just a hair too much spice. Excellent flavor and easy to make. I modified it slightly and its now a fall/winter staple in our household. Thanks!

I made this for my kids and they ate it and thought it was okay.  The verdict was:  You can make it for us again if you lower the spices to 3/4 of what the recipe calls for.     I liked it.

I made this for my family and they all loved it. I served it with corn bread muffins and my very picky son asked for seconds! I added a few touches of my own such as sweet corn niblets, fresh green and red peppers, and a chili mix packet.  It came out great and I will make it again.

We like hot, spicy food, but this one was over the top.   It was so HOT that I couldn’t even eat it and my husband, who loves hot food, didn’t care for it because he couldn’t taste anything chili.  It’s a shame, too, because this turkey chili recipe is good enough that it doesn’t need to hide behind a ton of pepper.

This is a fail proof simple recipe for a nice, low-fat turkey chili. In preparing it I didn't use the called for amount of cayenne pepper and didn't use any black pepper, because I knew my toddler would be eating it with us and that would be too spicy for her liking. No beer on hand and nothing in its place, but the chili remained tasty. I added the rest of a TJ's frozen bag of corn and tossed in some northern beans I had soaked the night before. This was a tasty chili with texture and flavor. Thanks!

The recipe is a little confusing, adding salt and black pepper twice. Not sure if that's a typo but I would definitely stick with one teaspoon of each, it was EXTREMELY salty with two. We added some Tabasco too, it was HOT but that's the way we like it. If you don't, cut the Cayenne in half.

This was very good, but I cut down on the spices....a lot....after reading other reviews. I skipped the cayane, and only put in about half of the amounts of the other stuff. I also didn't add more salt, pepper, or chile powder when i put the rest of the ingredients in. I didn't feel like getting the crock pot out, so I just cooked in a pot on the stove. I put the ingredients together on Sunday and didn't cook it until tonight (Friday) so I figured the ingredients have had plenty of times to "marry" (haha, I hate that word when used in cooking!) so i only cooked for about an hour. I rated it 4 instead of 5 since I had to cut so much of the spices out. It was really good though. Will make again.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe! I used two lbs of ground turkey (because my bf is a beast and eats a lot) and threw in a little extra of all the spices (we like spicy food). I omitted the chicken broth to make it a little thicker, simmered on the stove for an hour an presto--we had a delicious fall meal!

It's good, definitely, though I don't think it's anything special and out of the ordinary.  I rated a 3 because of everything I changed, though now that I am eating it, a four is in order. Nice heat to it now!!

Based on a number of other reviews saying it was too spicy, I cut the spices in half, but then there was no spice at all (I didn't have cayenne on hand, so maybe that was the difference?)! So I then added in the other half, and again didn't think it had much heat (Note: I am not a spice person, so if I think it needed more, it definitely wasn't spicey).  So in addition to using all of the spices listed here, there were my modifications: a lot more chili powder, more flower pepper (Trader Joes), more paprika, tad more oregano, added lots of red pepper flakes, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, completely omitted the beer, and added some celery, a couple jalapenos and 3 amarillo chilis.  I also used a tad less chicken broth an it was still too watery, so added a couple TBLS of corn startch.

I make this all the time but I add 1 green pepper and 2-3 jalapeños chopped, only one with the ribs and seeds. Also I sub tomato sauce for the stewed tomatoes. My son doesn't like tomato chunks. I add one more can of beans and any kind of full bodied beer. Also I cook it on low for 8 hours or however much time I have. Love it.

There's a lot of stuff that works well about this recipe; there's also a lot that makes it less awesome than it could or should be.  My major problem with this recipe is the amount of vague instructions included. Step 1 is fine with me.  It's step 2 that just includes a lot of missing information, in my opinion. If the step says to pour " ... the diced tomatoes with chile peppers, stewed tomatoes, kidney beans ..."does that include the juice along with the main contents? My experience has lead to the flavor being a little funky, especially after the kidney bean juices.  Moreover, while cooking the meat in those spices is a really pleasant idea, adding four times the spice to the actual liquid component of the chili makes the recipe unpleasantly spicy.  I can't be mad about the spicy component (it's in the name of the recipe afterall), but it relies too much on the spice rather than the actual flavor.

This a very tasty soup. I did take into account what other reviewers said and dialed back the spicy spices (chili powder and cayenne) by about half, then added a bit more to taste and desired "hotness." Entire family enjoyed this. Used regular beer and pure lime juice since I didn't have the other as called for in the recipe. Used one soup pot in preparing it. Simply heated the oil, browned the garlic and softened the onions, then browned the turkey and added the other ingredients. Let it cook for approximately 30 minutes on stove top. Turned out yummy with minimal clean up.

I have to admit I used this recipe because my name's Sarah and I thought it must be the best out there... I made this dish for my company's chili cookoff and pretty much followed every step. Left out the cayenne because I thought it might be too spicy for the average tongue... just put more paprika. I didn't use the beer but added my own wine/sherry (I like taking a walk on the wild side) and it turned out great. Added cilantro/shredded Mexican cheese about an hour before serving. Paired it with sweet cornbread bites and named it Sweet 'n Spicy (since it was anonymous of course)... everyone was raving about it and I won the cookoff! Will definitely make it again.

I had to write my first review on this recipe. So easy to make and tastes so good. I love spice and this recipe came out very spicy, so not for my kids but i loved it.
