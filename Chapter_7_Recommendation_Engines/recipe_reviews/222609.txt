The refrigerated pizza crust works well as the flat bread base.  I did not have Parmesan, so I used 3/4 cup Romano in addition to the cheddar.  I crushed the garlic and even though I am a garlic lover, I think I will cut back by at least one clove the next time (personal taste preference).  Some black olive slices would have been a nice addition to this cheese blend.  This was so easy to make it's almost sinful, and the topping possibilities are endless.  Thanks, Brent, we liked it!

Hubs and I gave this the old college try but in the end we agreed we just didn't like it.  The crust, unlike the recipe described, was soft, not crispy.  Beyond that there just was too much...of just about everything.  I used two small cloves of garlic and that was plenty - I can't imagine using three times that much! Three quarters of a cup of Parmesan/Romano is about 2/3 too much.  A sprinkle, even 1/3 cup, would have been more palatable.  Also, mozzarella was a better choice, at least for us, than cheddar, and parsley, a reduced amount,  a better choice than basil.  The bottom line, unfortunately, was that this was a soft, thin, bread-like "crust" with an overload of Parmesan/Romano and garlic.

Made for Recipe Group. Cheesy, tasty, and easy, what's not to like?! I used a thin crust pizza instead of the regular. I think it would have been better with a regular crust. Thanks for the recipe.

Recipe Group Selection:  02, November 2013 ~ My husband and I loved this bread.  It is almost like our favorite garlic cheese bread from one of the pizza restaurants near us.  I did read the reviews from fellow AR members about cutting back on the garlic.  I cut it down to 4 (3 small & 1 big) but the next time I will only use 3.  I had fresh basil that I froze, so I grabbed a few leaves and cut them up over the crust.  I baked this for 11 minutes and it was the color I was looking for.  Thanks Brent for sharing your recipe, it will be made again in our house.

Made this for Recipe Group...Very good! I agree that the garlic could be reduced a bit, but other than that, this went great w/ our dinner tonight and couldn't have been easier. This would alos be great w/ parsley in place of the basil. I could not get a pic b/c of bad lighting, lol, but I will be sure to next time. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I could not find pizza dough so used tortillas. I used Asiago as I didn't have Romano.  Turned out great.  Thin and crispy the way we like it.

Delicious!  I made it using mozzarella instead of romano since the store was out of romano and a bit of mild cheddar. We added marinara sauce for dipping.  My husband and I both approve.  Thank you!
