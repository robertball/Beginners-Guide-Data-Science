As far as I can see, the only flaw in this  recipe is the combination of the temp and cook time. I dropped my time to 9 minutes at 400 degrees, and they were perfect. I tweaked it a bit, due to what I had on hand. I used coconut oil - which was a new experience. Other than it being super solid, and having to beat it down (= for a long time to get it to incorporate, it worked well. And I used chopped pecans, instead of the walnuts. I questioned the "1/3 tsp" measure on the baking soda and vanilla - but found one in ONE of my sets of measuring spoons. [I forgot the vanilla, by the way - and it was fine (=] I did roll them into balls and flatten them into patties, after reading sassyoldlady's review. I did 12 as is, then added a heaping 1/3 c chocolate covered craisins for the second half batch. It yielded 23 cookies. But I was picking at the dough [which was so yummy!], and I bet I ate my 24th cookie raw (= I brought them to work to share, and these got RAVE reviews from my coworkers!

Recipe Group Selection ~ 12, January 2013 – I really enjoyed this oatmeal cookie.  Crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, just like I think oatmeal cookies should be.  I thought the order of the listed ingredients and the directions were a mess.  Usually the listed ingredients are in the order of the directions – not with this one.  I tried baking these 2 different ways.  Fourteen minutes at 400° would have been too long in my oven.  After flattening the cookies, just a little, they were done at the 9 minute mark at 400°.  I also tried baking for 11 minutes at 350° without flattening at all.  This resulted in my favorite baked cookie.  I think this is a great tasting cookie that kept well without losing the crunchiness or softness.  Thanks Bryan for sharing your recipe.  I think this was a great pick for “Recipe Group” this week.

YUMMY!  I used 100% natural whole grain old fashioned Quaker Oats and followed the recipe leaving out the walnuts due to diet restriction but baked for 9 minutes.  I also used parchment paper instead of greasing a cookie sheet.  Perfect!  I would have loved to have added the walnuts as I feel that would have put it over the top.  I made 24 cookies so they must have been a little smaller than called for.  I did notice that I ran the mixer a little longer than I do with other recipes, so it was really well mixed.  Thank you Bryan for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!!  We LOVED it!

Made these for Recipe Group 1/11/13. The cookies were really very good. Baking time was about 9 1/2 min to perfection. The order of ingredients, as written, & the directions are a mess. IDK whether it's the submitter's write up but it should've been corrected/simplified by AR before being published.

Recipe Group selection from 1/11/12.  I followed the process and ingredients with the exception of omitting the nuts (allergies) but the baking time and temps were not compatible with my oven.  The tbs measure for the cookies was too small, at minimum it should be a well rounded tbs and that would still yield a rather small cookie.  I used a #40 scoop, just shy of 2 oz and got 21 cookies.  I realize different ovens may not run true to temperature, but 400F at 13 minutes gave me a seriously over cooked very spread cookie.  9 minutes gave me raw centers and almost over done edges and still very spread.  375 was still too hot.  I finally settled on 350 for 13 minutes which gave me evenly baked cookies with just a crisp edge and a chewy center.  And they didn't spread as much as at the higher temperatures.  They do taste good, though, so thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made these for recipe group.  My 12yo made these with me with no problems.  Mmmm....big, soft, chewy oatmeal cookies.  Subbed butter for shortening so cookies spread more but still very good.  9 minutes baking time is spot on.   Used a medium cookie scoop and yielded 23 cookies.  Thank you Bryan for a yummy recipe.

Made for Recipe Group. I made half a recipe using one whole egg and pecans. I used a small cookie scoop first and just put a few on parchment. They barely spread and still seemed a little doughy in the middle even though the outsides were crispy. Went up to #40 and flattened them a little, they spread to about 3" cookies. Just about right. A tablespoon is not going to make a very big cookie! I got a dozen regular size cookies after the first two balls. Halfway through I added some craisins to the rest of the batter. 400 at 9 minutes is just right (thanks for the tip bigcountry!)Good flavor, nice and crunchy and chewy in all the right spots. Thanks for the recipe.

Great texture !  And, the yield is perfect for our family.  Enough to enjoy but not so many that we are eating them for days.  14 minutes was far too long in my oven, 9 minutes resulted in a perfect cookie.  Crisp edges and chewy middle.  We will definately make again, maybe adding a bit of cinnamon the next time.  Thanks for recipe, it's a keeper.
