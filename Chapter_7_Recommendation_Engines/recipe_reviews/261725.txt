These are really good. They need some extras, though. I added vegetables like written in the notes. I also added soy crumbles, which didn’t affect flavor; just nutrition and texture.

Sometimes I use sugar then I just add the sauce of what every meat I choose. And it just gives of this savory taste. Been cooking since 5years old.

I left out the onions because my daughter has onion sensitivity. I also added some soy sauce someone’s suggestion on here. I wish I left out the red pepper flakes and used Frank’s hot sauce instead for a more muted hot flavor. Other than that it was delicious. It was my first time using toasted buckwheat and I really liked it.
