We absolutely LOVED this! As soon as I saw the recipe, I knew I wanted to do this sandwiched into a warm pita, and that was perfect! I did cube my chicken and marinated it a few hours in the marinade before cooking, which gave these a great flavor. I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The chicken came out moist and flavorful. I would make this chicken again.

My family is not a fan of the garam masala seasoning, but, I really like the cooking method because it is perfect for summer.  No heating up my kitchen and no mess!  I tried one packet with the garam masala seasoning and the other packets using a marinade of whole grain mustard, olive oil, brown sugar, lemon juice, & fresh garlic.   We did not like the packet with the garam masala.  We don't like the flavor and thought it was bland.  We did like the packets with the mustard marinade.  I did not care for the vegetables because I don't think steamed vegetables have a lot of flavor and I think the texture gets a little mushy. However, my husband did like the vegetables.  We both thought the chicken was very moist.  I would use this cooking method again, but, switch around the flavors and ingredients in the packet.

This was okay but needs more salt. After tasting it I topped it with salt as I was eating this! For some reason most of the onions and zucchini burned. My grill was set to medium and registered 450 degrees F. I grilled the foil packs for 22 minutes. I seasoned the yogurt sauce with parsley, dill, salt, pepper, garlic powder and a splash of cider vinegar. I'm so glad I did that because I think it helped.

Next time I will make my own spice minus the cloves. The store brand was over powering clove flavor. It does have potential and will try again.

as i went to preheat my oven i realized i didn't have any foil.. ugh! so i decided to pan fry this dish.. like AlanaKadas i used the recipe for Easy Garam Masala on this site.. i subbed garlic powder for fresh and totally forgot the onion.. didn't have any yogurt on hand so i left that out all together.. i felt like the pepper overwhelmed everything and wish i had some yogurt laying around.. i added a bit of bottled lemon to cut through the pepper to no avail.. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the dish.. just wish i would have had that yogurt! ty for the recipe

Shared the results with some friends, who all really liked it.  The flavor was good, the chicken was moist, and clean-up was a snap!  
I did bake it in the oven, following the directions in the notes section.

This was a very good and very easy dish.  Clean up was a snap!  Not too sure about the seasonings, so I'd give it a 3, but hubby liked it a lot, so a final 4 rating.  A great way to cook chicken to keep it moist and tender.

This recipe went together very easily. Having never tried garam masala, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, the flavor in this fell short for my family. It was very overpowering! I loved the use of the Reynolds wrap. It made clean up so easy. I will definitely use this method more often.

I really loved this recipe and so did my family!  I couldn't find garam masala spice blend, so I used this recipe to make my own: Allrecipes Easy Garam Masala. 
It was easy to prepare and cook and using Reynolds foil made the cleanup super easy!
I used the yogurt on my own chicken, but no one else in my family did. I think I preferred it without the yogurt as well. But I will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed this dish.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and we created a moroccan-inspired tomato salad to add brightness to the meal.  Enjoyed the ease of incorporating the garam masala to create new flavor profiles.  And you can't beat the fast clean-up.

I had never tried garam masala before, but had been wanting to try it for a long time, so I was happy to give this recipe a try.  It was good, but I don't think the garam masala flavor is for me.  I did LOVE the Reynolds foil method of preparing it, though.  One change I made was to add sliced red bell pepper to the mix for both flavor and color.  I would have used less garam masala and more salt uin the seasoning, but that's just my personal taste.  The other thing I changed was to add a couple of thing to the yogurt - a little garlic powder, some dill, some salt and some lemon juice.  Basically making it a yogurt sauce instead of just plain yogurt.  I used parsley instead of cilantro because I dislike cilantro.  I recommend this recipe for anyone who wants to try garam masala, or who likes the flavor.  I especially recommend the Reynolds Foil method of grilling for this recipe or any other you may be thinking of making.

Five stars for ease of cleanup. Three stars for a slightly bland dish. Definitely needs a bit of something else.....? I served this with a lovely saffron rice.

I doubled the recipe and, instead of making individual packets, I layered it in a 9x13 pyrex, covered tightly with foil, and baked for about 55 minutes. Easy, healthy, and Dee-LISH!!! I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced salt by 50%.  I added Bok Choy, not greens. Dill to Yogurt was a plus (actually sour cream). Cooked in oven for 30 minutes. Breasts were 3/4 to inch thick. Very tasty.

Very good flavor, good portion sizes, and easy. We used a store brand of garam masala (Spice Islands) that we knew to be salty, so no additional salt was needed other than that in the recipe. Great way to get your veggies, a keeper.

Loved how easy the clean up was for this :) But I wasn't a fan of the flavor of the chicken. Loved the veggies. I thought that the chicken was missing something but I am not very familiar with the spices so I couldn't quite pinpoint what it needed. My husband and my youngest son loved it though. The chicken came out nice and juicy which is a big plus. Served this with brown rice.

A light and healthy dish, but it’s a little on the bland side. Next time I would increase the seasoning to kick it up a notch.  I cut the chicken into medallions, gently pounding them to a uniform size and then brined the medallions.  I warmed the olive oil and added the garlic, salt & pepper an hour before preparing to allow the garlic to infuse into the oil.  I love the clean up – it’s a breeze.

Although I loved using Reynolds, making my clean up a snap I did NOT like this recipe.i was turned off by the smell of the garam Marsala alone.

The hubs & I enjoyed this recipe for the simplicity and flavors. Paired well with brown rice and green salad. Next time we're going to add some red bell peppers. Clean was a snap for me too, another bonus!

Wow!  This elevates the mundane chicken breast to a whole new level.  Sweet, juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  I coated each piece of chicken with the olive oil mixture, then layered the vegetables and drizzled with the remaining oil.  Since it was windy outside, I put the packets on a cookie sheet and baked them in the oven.  I coated and wrapped the onion slices separately as I didn't want them to overpower the rest of the flavors going on.  The garam masala spice and garlic combo is a winner!  And to think you can cook this dish in individual serving packets made out of Reynolds Heavy Duty Foil.  Easy preparation, easy clean up.  Thank you Reynolds kitchen masters for this delicious recipe!  I will make it again and again.

The best thing about this was the ease of clean up. The recipe was pretty good. I had to cook it much longer than suggested and my chicken was still not done. I think next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces or chop the chicken and vegetables up and top them with the sauce mixture. Perhaps may serve it over rice. The flavors were good; especially with the yogurt and cilantro topping. I think it could have used a little more of something....just not quite sure what. Salt maybe? I will give this a second try.

If you like the sweet and spicy taste of South Asian cooking, you will love this recipe that includes Garam Masala. You can buy a big plastic jar of it at Wal-Mart for about one dollar. It's a nice twist on the traditional chicken. What I loved the most, was how EASY it is to cook with foil! Just chop the ingredients, put them in the foil, wrap them up in a neat little pouch, cook an toss it out when you're done. Clean-up is minimal with Reynolds!
