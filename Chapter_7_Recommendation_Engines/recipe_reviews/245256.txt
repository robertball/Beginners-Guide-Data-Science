I used skim milk, so I used 1 cup of milk (instead of 1/2 cup) and 1 cup of water (not 1-1/2 cups).  This soup surprised the heck out of me because its “skinny” ingredients (and I even used skim milk) tasted a bit decadent and was filling.  I used Wondra® flour and whisked it into the water-milk mixture to be sure I had no lumps in the soup.  My cubed potatoes were small size, so they were tender in fewer than 20 minutes.  The bacon on its own is a subtle layer of flavor, but this is just a good combination of ingredients.  This was lunch today, and my hubby enjoyed it as much as I did.  We love mushroom soup, I’ve tried a lot of recipes, and this one ranks right up there with the best  where I’ve used heavy cream or half-and-half.   And thanks, yajuwen, for quantifying every line item for this soup (well-written), so there’s no guessing involved; this one’s a keeper!  ••••• UPDATE 4.18.17 •••••  Had no fresh thyme, so I just used dried which worked fine.  Whenever I get a craving for decadent cream of mushroom soup, I head to this recipe.  It simply never lets me down, and yet, I can enjoy it guilt free!

Wow! This is really good and your right, it's very creamy.  It's great as it is, it's also good using vegetable broth instead of water.  Thank you for sharing.

It is good, but not much flavor.  I did use much more than 1 cup of mushrooms. I also did 1 cup milk 1 cup water and added water as needed.

My mistake. Followed recipe closely except did not have any potatoes, so used boxed mashed.  Added far too much and the soup turned to mush!! I now can see how a few chopped russets would be far more tasty!  Well,  will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this a couple days ago for Christmas and will definitely make again! The only changes I would make are adding vegetable broth instead of water and putting in many more mushrooms for a complete flavour. Not much taste otherwise, though, in all, very good, skinny yet creamy soup!

Delicious soup. One would never know that this is 'skinny'. Quick, easy and simple to make.

This soup didn't agree with my taste. I shared the soup with 3 coworkers who typically enjoy cream-based soups.  They said they really loved the soup.  They said it was very tasty and flavorful which i why I gave the recipe 4 stars.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I tripled it so I would have some for later in the week.  I agree with some reviews that it was more of a bacon-potato soup, so I will change it for next time by using half the bacon and twice the mushrooms.  The flavors blend well, and we enjoyed our bacon-potato with-a-bit-of-mushroom soup.

Not a fan of mushrooms, but I like to be adventurous. This is very good, but a few more shakes of garlic powder and salt made it even better.

I needed to add quite a bit more seasoning for this recipe.  I found the mushroom and potato to be too earthy.  I added some hoisin sauce to it which gave it much more flavor and a richer color.  Will make again.

I used John Morrell Diced Ham, instead of bacon, (2 handfuls). A 1/4 teaspoon of Onion Powder, instead of 1/2 teaspoon. I also used 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of Thyme, as I had no more sprigs.

I found the potatoes, cooked slowly, and chopped small, were perfect on cooking time. No added milk, needed.

Best, inexpensive, low-calorie Mushroom Soup, Ever!!!

A better name for this soup would be bacon, potato  soup with mushrooms. The strong tast of bacon and even the tast of potatoes over took the delicate flavor of mushrooms. Also I'd keep the potatoes out and the flour and use instant potatoes for thickener.

I made this with a variation. I am in Japan so I used shiitake mushrooms and other local mushrooms which I sautéed in real butter first and set aside. Boiled the potatoes separately then scooped most out and added the bullion & milk and put that mixture in the blender. Combined everything and added spices. For spices I added garlic salt, celery seed, rosemary and thyme. It is very flavorful! The potatoes here are delicious. I did not use bacon or meat in this.

It seemed like more potato than mushroom soup, even after I added extra mushrooms.  Next time I'll mash up the potatoes and add a little more seasoning.  My husband gave it thumbs up.

I made this with 1/2 cup less water and substituted for cream of mushroom soup in a pork chop recipe.  Way less salt as well as low-fat.
