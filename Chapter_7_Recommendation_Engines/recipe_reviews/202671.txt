Great way to use up the shredded wheat and have a little something sweet too. I added 1 additional cup of cereal for a total of 4 cups, did not pack the brown sugar, added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and replaced raisins with semi-sweet mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top. For the stove top method, I brought the brown sugar and honey to a boil, removed from heat, added peanut butter and vanilla, stirred until smooth, poured over cereal, mixed, poured into pan, sprinkled with chocolate chips. Yum!

I needed to use up some Shredded Wheat cereal that no-one was eating so this recipe was perfect!  because of my changes I felt I should only give 4 stars.  I didn't have any honey so i took my 1/2 measurer and filled it almost all the way with light corn syrup, then the rest of the way with a few T of maple syrup for flavor.  The cereal gave a nice crunch , the raisins made them a bit chewy and the peanut flavor was mild imo...   I had trouble trying to cut them into bars since they were a bit soft and gooey; maybe the honey would have made them firmer!  I may add some chopped peanuts next time as well!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Delicous.  I did have to cook it on the stove to get it set into bars though, the microwave did not work for me.  I brought the brown sugar, honey (which can be replaced with corn syrup if need be) and peanut butter just to a boil in a small pan on the stove, stirring often, and then dumped over the ceral and raisins in a mixing bowl.  My favourite is to use special k.

Boiling instead of microwaving definitely makes the difference in this recipe. The mixture came out a clay-like consistency, and I packed them into a mini-muffin tray to make bit sized cereal bars! If you decide to use chocolate chips  like I did, be sure to mix them in at the very end or they'll melt and stick to the spoon.

I made this because I was given a box of shredded wheat & no one was eating it. So before it expired I came on this site & looked up ideas of what to do with it so it would be eaten. 
I made alot of changes to this. I basically kept all the ingredients the same but instead of using raisins cause no one likes them, I  used cranberries (Ocean Spray), added more peanut butter & honey. I kept it covered in the pan overnight & put it on a cake board then used chocolate raspberry sauce drizzled over top. I then cut it into bite size pieces. Everyone loved them! The kids didn't suspect a thing (17&3 yrs) 
I'm sure u can more or less of anything, but I'll be definitely be making this again & probably change up the ingrediants :)
5 Stars from me!

This tasted pretty good and was a nice way to use up shredded wheat.  I added 4 cups of shredded wheat instead of 3 in order to use up 2 full pouches.  The bars were pretty messy to eat and never really set up, which wasn't too bad since that means it stayed soft but don't expect a granola bar consistency.  It's not exactly healthy either.  You could add most anything to it and it would be good:  chocolate  chips, nuts, cranberries, cheerios...

This was super easy to make and tasted so good. I didnâ€™t have any sugar so omitted that completely and they were great. I will definitely make them again.

I decided to press the mixture into a muffin tin instead of a square dish because it eliminated the need to cut the bars (and  dirty another knife). The mixture was super sticky so I had to dust my fingers with flour in order to do any pressing. I will make this again too, mayb with nutella instead of peanut butter!

I made this exactly as written and just got sweet goop, even after leaving it in the fridge for an hour. The taste was fine, if heavy on the honey, but what a waste of sugar. The reason shredded wheat goes uneaten is that it's unsweetened. I wish I'd just added sweetener to a bowl of cereal instead. It would've meant eating much less sugar overall and enjoying the cereal more.
