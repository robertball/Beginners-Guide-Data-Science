Ok, so I really changed this recipe.  I put bread crumbs and cheese on top over every level of the eggplant.  I  also used white wine in place of the vinegar.  My husband thought it was "incredable".

This was excellent!  I'm surprised the previous reviews have not been 5 stars.  Definitely, an all-time favorite now!  To reduce the fat, I baked the eggplant slices rather than frying them in oil.  I also separated the half rings of onion when I layered them.  I used homemade Italian-style breadcrumbs, too.  I  chose to serve it on the cool size of room temperature--perfect!

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was terrible.  The individuals who favored this dish added different components.  As is, this dish needs some work.  I will not make this again.

I did not like this at all, and neither did my husband.  It has a very strong vinegar flavor.  I love eggplant, but I couldn't even taste it.  And for an 8" pan, I think that 1 cup of breadcrumbs is too much.  There was a thick layer of the crumbs just sitting on top.

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  I added a little sauteed fresh garlic and bell pepper.  I also put 4 slices of provolone cheese under the bread crumbs.  Yummy!

Excellent! Our family loved this. I was tempted to put more seasoning on, but I am glad I didn't! After I made this, my husband's comment was, "Well, maybe there is life after meat!"  I added some parmesan cheese to the topping, but it wasn't necessary for the taste.

This is really tasty.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I added maple flavored balsamic vinegar, just because that's what I had.  Cut the onions and tomatoes very thin!  It was great.

This recipe was pretty good! It was easy enough to make, but personally I think it needs more than 3 vegetables. Next time, I'll be sure to squeeze more of the excess water from the eggplant, it came out a tad soggy. I sauteed the onion with added garlic and curry powder, just to make things interesting. I'll probably make this again, but with more veggies next time. This is an easy recipe to play with.

I followed this recipe exactly and I wish I'd added some sort of sauce.  In general the dish comes out too dry and the seasoning doesn't get a chance to be absorbed by the vegetables enough.  I haven't played around with this recipe yet so I don't have recommendations, but if anyone has a good solution, please let me know.

This recipe was delicious! I actually modified it somewhat. I briefly sauteed the eggplant in a spoonful of coconut oil instead of olive oil, but only on one side (I was in a hurry!). I layered them with the onions and tomatoes, but also added thinly sliced potatoes and patty pan squash. I used a really nice, fresh olive oil from a specialty store and then...totally forgot the balsamic vinegar. However, I stuck just a tiny handful of little bits of smoked gouda in the top layer. I baked this for 30 min or so and it was AWESOME!! Served it with cheese tortellini.

My family loved this recipe! I added more olive oil,garlic,salt,fresh pepper and parmesan cheese.  The next day I made it again but chopped the eggplant and put it over pasta! This dish was amazing both ways!

This was very good, but i think i would prefer to serve it as a side dish instead of the main dish. To avoid undercooked onions, i sauteed them a little in some cooking spray. I did the same with the eggplant (no oil). I used a lot of onion, too. On the top, i sprinkled basil, paprika, and cayenne pepper (you could just use italian seasoned breadcrumbs). Then i drizzled it with pumpkin seed oil, instead of mixing it with olive oil. Very good, but a kind of weird texture. Not to serve to guests, i don't think. Just a family meal.

I read the reviews and did not make it with vinegar.  I just added the cheese.  I used a combo of shredded cheddar and parmasen cheese.  I also used fresh garlic and herbs.  It turned out very well, I think it is very important to season the eggplant before browning and season it well while browning!! I also, peeled the skin off! My family very much enjoyed it and I will make it again.

The whole family just loved this dish.  The balsamic vinegar was terrific in it and made it so flavorful.  I oven roasted the onion slices and the eggplant slices before assembling the casserole the second time I made it, and it made it eve more flavorful.  I made this two nights out of four............we liked it so well!  This recipe will be part of my favorite vegetable dishes  Thank you so much for a really terrific recipe.

I found this recipe to be mediocre. I used prepackaged Italian bread crumbs for the topping, and I think fresh bread crumbs might've worked better. And more oil or butter added to the breadcrumbs. The onions weren't very tender after a 30-minute bake. I wouldn't make the recipe again.

I made this tonight and it was good . The only thing I did differently was lightly brush olive oil over the eggplant, then layered without frying the eggplant (I was in a hurry and trying to cut a step out). I really enjoyed the combination of the tomatoes, eggplant, and balsamic vinegar. The breadcrumbs toasted up nicely on top and gave the needed texture. I topped with grated Parmesan cheese but I don't think it would be necessary.

I think I would have liked it much better without the balsamic vinegar. Way too strong tasting for me. I think I can play with it some and make a few changes and it will be just fine.

This is so good! I did not fry the eggplant I just put the eggplant in raw then layered the onions tomatoes and added layers of mushrooms. I did not use much oil when mixing the bread crumbs. We avoid oil! I also added some vegan cheese into the breadcrumbs and baked at 365 for 35 mins and covered it the last 10 mins. I also plashed some white wine in the vinegar to cut the acidity. We all loved it and will make again.

The family did not like it, so I had much more than my fair share over a few days. I didn't love it but it was something different.

Didn't think it will be that tasty! Just I started the layers with thick onion slices in the bottom of the pan, then eggplant topped with tomatoes repeatedly. Also, I added sweet corn and Italian herbs, and grilled the eggplant after merely brushing it with olive oil. Finally, I topped everything after coming out from the oven with yoghurt based gravy. The gravy ingredients are 200 grams plain yogurt mixed with 3 minced cloves of garlic, salt, pepper, paprika and vinegar.

This was delicious! Changed it up a bit...placed sauteed onions and peppers in the casserole dish,  added Parmesan on the eggplant slices after  frying in oil, fresh mozzarella on top of the tomato slices, then more Parmigiano Reggiano on top with the breadcrumbs.

Recipe didn't work well. Frying the eggplant turned it too soft and the skin was too tough. Ended up peeling it and putting it in the casserole raw, so had to cook it longer. Made it at work and it doesn't plate nicely. Won' t be making it again!

I loved the flavor of the balsamic vinegar. This was delicious and no changes.

We loved it!  I went to the farmers market and was looking for a great recipe to incorporate some of the veggies I bought. This was it! I ad-libbed a little by adding a layer of sliced (oblong) yellow squash, and I didn't have balsamic vinegar, but I did have balsamic vinaigrette dressing, so I used it instead and it worked fine. I wanted it to be as carb free as possible, so no bread crumbs, but I needed something to top it off, so I searched the fridge and found sliced low fat Swiss cheese, and used that. One criticism, I didn't think 350 for 30 minutes didn't cut it, so I adjusted 10 more minutes at 400, and it crisped the cheese perfectly, and the result was scrumpdiliumptious!!! I will be making it again!

I used Italian Breadcrumbs, and realized my balsamic was actually a balsamic vinaigrette, and added cheese on top.  Loved it.  I was pleasantly surprised after reading the negative reviews since I haven't eaten eggplant in years.  It was just a small homegrown eggplant so only 1 layer of everything.  But I loved it with Rosemary/Thyme Roasted Chicken and a sprinkle of Parm on the top. I think the vinaigrette took the heavy vinegar taste away.  But will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!1 If you don't like Balsamic Vinegar, don't try this. I also browned my onions while browning the eggplant I ended it with pouring the vinegar all over eggplant, tomatoes & onions.. then put my breadcrumbs...than added Slices of Gouda cheese. Added bread crumbs on the gouda. It doesn't quite melt just browns...This recipe is a keeper!!!

Right off the bat one can see this could be more flavorful so I added garlic and cut some fresh cilantro into the dish before baking and yes, it's a winner!
