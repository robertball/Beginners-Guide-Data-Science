Just a quick comment to the readers that had sugary caramel... NEVER under any circumstances scrape the pan. The tiny sugar crystals on the sides of the pan can and will crystalize your caramel, resulting in a grainy, yucky caramel. Return it to the pan and boil it on medium-low just until the sugar crystals are dissolved, about 5-10 minutes.

Rich and creamy! I think the secret is to melt the butter, then add the sugars. Add the condensed milk last, when the sugars have mostly melted.   Also, I used dark brown sugar instead of light, and only used 3/4 cup of white sugar.

If you heat this long enough it can be good to make lollipops.  Only thing I changed was I used less white sugar and more brown sugar, I eyeballed it so maybe difference of taking away a third of the white and adding 2/3 more brown.  And I sprinkle kosher salt with the brown sugar it gives that sweet salty taste like in those expensive seasalt caramels.  It didn't come out grainy at all.  Very tasty

I'll admit that I am a first time caramel (candy) maker, but I did not care for this. I mean... how do you get the sugars to melt to 250 degrees without burning the sugar? (Yes I have a candy thermometer.) Stiring obviously made it worse. Not only was it grainy, but it had burnt chunks it it.

Linda,
Thank you for this recipe! I am a really busy Mom that needed to adjust my candy making time but keep the quality as good as the longer versions.
These caramels are excellent! Easy to cut and smooth and rich to eat! BUT the best part is these are so easy!  Thank you!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this recipe didn't work for me at all.  It turned out very hard, crumbly, and way too sweet.  I had better luck with another recipe.

I'm not sure why other reviewers didn't stir their caramel mixture while cooking?  It doesn't say not to!  Anyway, my caramels turned out delicious!  I turned off the heat once my mixture hit 245 degrees F because the temperature keeps rising once the heat is off.  I poured my mixture in a buttered glass dish and refrigerated.  I will definitely make again!

I *love* this recipe and make it with my own condensed milk to keep it corn-syrup free.  It looks like a lot of the reviewers didn't make this right!  The trick with most all candies is to leave them alone ... stirring or scraping is what makes grainy candy that doesn't set up.  Also - do not trust your thermometer, they're frequently inaccurate and cannot account for environmental factors.  The cold water in a cup is a much better gauge and never fails me!  Next time, just let it cook then dump it out in the pan; it's absolutely perfect :)  Excellent recipe, can't wait to make more for Christmas.

I was glad to find this recipe because I didn't have any corn syrup on hand. I followed the directions and even used my candy thermometer but was disapointed because they turned to sugar - grainy, not chewy at all.  I have never had caramel do that before.  Tasted okay but won't make again.

i followed  the recipe and while the caramel was hot, it looked good. i did the water test multiple times and each time the caramel resembled actual caramel, but when i poured the caramel to cool it started to look less shiny the cooler it got and by the time it was room temperature, it was caramel flavored FUDGE. i did not find it very enjoyable, i couldn't even get the little kids to eat some. they were not happy.

This recipe didn't blend very well - we have brown specks throughout. My daughter checked the temperature with our new candy thermometer - but it just didn't ccok up as nicely as we expected.  While it tastes good - we won't use this recipe again.

I was really unhappy with the results of these caramels, they are sugary texture and I threw out the whole pan.  Use the recipe that has corn syrup in it!!!  I learned the hard way...........

Best caramel recipe ever! My light brown sugar was a bit chunky so after adding all the  ingredients together in the sauce pan I put everything in the blender to smooth everything up. After that, I returned it to the heat and cooked as directed. It was amazingly creamy! Easy to do, to cut and didn't last long! Definitely making more! Thanks you so much!

Wish I had used a double boiler. Sugar burned to bottom of pan and I got hardened caramelized sugar throughout the mixture. My fault. I don't use thermometers.

Even though I don't have a candy thermometer, I have never had a problem making caramels. I always just judge by ball stage. This one turned out grainy and I had to avoid scraping the burnt sugar off the bottom of the pan. It doesn't melt the sugar before it gets to the point of burning, no matter how slowly to heat it.

Recipe is too sweet and does not taste as good as other caramels.  Cooked it to 260 but never got hard enough.  Go with a recipe that calls for cream and corn syrup (it will be much better and not as sweet).

This is my favorite caramel recipe because it's so much faster than the original that calls for cream.  I've been making this for years and it's never failed!  A must for the holidays - good for caramel apples too!

I love this caramel super simple and dont need karo syrup. I did a couple things differently I used 1/4 cup less white sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla after all ingredients were melted together. My only mistake was pouring hot caramels into a wax paper lined dish. Opps but caramel is delicious

Loved it.  I used about 3 oz. less of condensed milk because I don't like a milky caramel.  I thought it was great.  Did not stir during boiling and used HEAVY bottomed pan.  The type of pan is crucial and is called for in the recipe.

Should have better instructions especially for first time caramel makers,you have to melt the sugar on a low temp. and slowly.You also have to scrape up the bottom of the pan before the sugar burns otherwise you will have black flecks of burnt sugar in your caramel

I wish I had listened to the reviews that it turned out grainy. I saw a review saying that theirs did not, so I gave it a try.  I stirred mine almost constantly and it was grainy. It also just had a sweet flavor, not really a caramel flavor.  This is not what I was hoping for at all.  I won't make this recipe again.

I loved this recipe and I was so happy because I had all the ingredients on hand. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the mixture, and a little bit of water (maybe 2-3 Tbs). I was using it for dipping apple slices in to make caramel apples at an activity. I stirred it almost constantly, and I turned off the heat as soon as it started to get a little sticky (no thermometer) instead of just runny. I was worried at first because I didn't think it was supposed to boil, but then I realized that it needed to boil a bit first. It is a little sweeter than most caramels, but that's good to me cause the other ones make me gag. Even my husband, who isn't a caramel fan, said it was one of the best he's had. I took it to the activity, along with the traditional melted square caramels dip, and this one was completely gone at the end, and I still had most of the other one.

This recipe didn't turn out for me at all. I too noticed a grainy texture in the final product, and weird flavor. I ended up throwing all of it out.

i found this recipie to be way too sweet and it never became the correct texture.  Perhaps i did something wrong.
