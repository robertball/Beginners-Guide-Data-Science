I made these with organic light brown sugar and organic corn syrup (no gmos in our household). It made 48 mini muffin sized tartlets.  To be honest, the corn syrup taste was too strong for me, they tasted just like pecan pie, without the pecans.  If you like pecan pie, you will love these, but it wasn't really the "butter tart" flavor I was looking for (way too sweet for me, although I think my guests will like them).  I am glad I tried them, but I probably will not make them again.

Tastes like I should have just opened a bottle of corn syrup and started guzzling.  Not very impressed with this recipe for butter tarts.

Delicious!!  I added chopped pecans to some.  Found I needed to decrease the cooking time quite a bit.

If you want a non runny, no raisin butter tart, this is good.
