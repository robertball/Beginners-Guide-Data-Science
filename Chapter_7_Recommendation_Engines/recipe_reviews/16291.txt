What an awesome dessert!  I made it in an 11" torte pan and glazed it with a chocolate glaze that I found on this site ("Satiny Chocolate Glaze").  After glazing, I cut the torte into 12 slices (next time I will make 16 slices) and put half a large strawberry, cut side down, on each slice by the outer edge.  My book club gals loved it and everyone wanted the recipe!!!  This is an easy winner!

This is a truly delicious cake, Passover or not!  I am as intense a chocoholic as they come and this cake has now become my favorite, bar none.  I made it last night and I got scared towards the end of the baking time because the top looked dried out, so I took it out about 7 minutes shy of what the recipe called for.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It turns out I should have trusted the recipe, because the center was more than gooey, it was undercooked.  However... that is not the end of the story.  My husband and I both had a piece while it was still warm, we couldn't resist after smelling it baking!  As described above, the center was hot and very gooey, too gooey, actually, but towards the outer edge it became incredible... dense and moist and chocolatey.... perfect, in fact.  I put it in the refrigerator overnight and today it is FABULOUS... even the undercooked inside is now more like the inside of a truffle, and then it gets cakier towards the outside.  I am baking another one tonight and will follow the recommended baking time religiously... otherwise, I won't change a thing.  I used my coffee grinder to grind the sliced almonds my husband brought home from the store, so, if you're wondering how to grind your almonds, that worked perfectly for me.  Turned the almonds into a fine-textured meal, almost like flour.

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a rich, decadent and VERY chocolatey dessert.  It will not disappoint.

This was just fantastic, much better than any other dessert at our passover party! It didn't last 5 minutes before it had totally disappeared.  I didn't frost it, and it was so rich and chocolatey on its own, I was glad that I left it "natural." Thank you Leah.

Although the crumblies that came off the top taste good, it fell apart after trying to get it out of the pan. Once i finally did get it out it was so moist that i could actually take a knife and spread the cake over the cracks to fix it. Hoping to get the pretty top it origionally had (which is now on the bottom after flipping it out) I stuck it on a cookie sheet and put it in the oven for 20 more minutes. It seems to have sortof worked. I'm bringing it to my family tomorrow, hope it tastes as good as people say it is!

This was such a hit at passover. I did use the chocolate glaze that others recommended, I think that made it look beautiful. Next time I will serve with berries on the side, esp raspberries or strawberries. I made it in a 9 inch round pan, still using the foil, and the Pam spray with flour and it worked great. I also roasted some raw almonds and ground them in my Magic Bullet. I was even asked to make it for shabbat the next week. Yum!

If I could put 10 stars it would still be too little. Leah, what an amazing receipe! So easy to make and so divinly mouthwatering to taste. You were right! There was not a piece left (shame for me running around seder and not getting any!) Thank you ... Chag Samaech

Excellent! Perfect for Passover and my gluten-free daughter! The only down side is it is very high in calories, and I have trouble staying away from it...Plus it's best with no glaze, but heated and served ala mode! Yum!

Yummy! I made this for Passover, and it was a huge hit! I had some almond flour (which is just ground almonds), so it made it SO very easy to make! I topped with Vanilla Glaze (this site), and it was perfect! Thank you VERY much for the great recipe...easy to make, and so delightful to eat!

This is a fantastic passover recipe - and a  darn good recipe for year round use.  I made it yesterday for the first time and have another one in the oven right now!  Follow the directions exactly as written - nothing needs to be changed!

This is incredible! I love chocolate, so with some ganache, it is delicious. The cooling is very important to get the full fudgey-ness.

Just tried this for the first time.  (My first torte even). They came out perfectly. I substituted regular butter for the margarine.  Delicious. Will use every Passover.

My family loved this.  It was yummy, but the almond disturbed the texture more than I would have liked.  I'll try again using my coffee grinder instead of my food processor, and see if I can make the almond more powdery.

The cake was good but I should have baked it longer. I put it in for 45 minutes and the outside of the cake was good but the inside/middle part of the cake didn't have the desired consistency or taste that I was looking for. Another tip is to make sure you grind the almonds to a flour consistency. My almonds weren't ground good enough and you could taste them in the cake. I served them with fresh strawberries but I think itwould go well with a rasberry sauce. I think the tartness in the rasberries would compliment the chocolate very well.

Oh YUM... but NOT for those who don't like chocolate!  Dense, dark chocolate flavor and the ground almonds add a nice texture.  I think I may have overbeat the egg whites a little, and/or overbaked a little, but it was still delicious! Chilled it for a few hours, then "frosted" with Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site, and served with halved fresh strawberries.  A huge hit... will make again, and not just for Passover!

A perfect dessert! Light and chocolatey, and the almonds created a nice texture and flavor. Sprinkle confectioner's sugar on top and slice a few strawberries on top. I will make this recipe again and again.

A really wonderful cake, soft and rich but not too heavy.  A big success at the seder, but I could also see serving this year-round.  By the way, when I made this recipe I used 100g of ground almonds (I bake by weight instead of volume).

This torte was fantastic.  I mis read the recipe and cooked the torte in a water bath instead. The torte cooked all the way through. My daughter helped make it and the recipe was so easy.  We love chocolate and this is almost exactly like a flourless chocolate cake.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake for one of the Sedars. I was worried about making a cake without flour but i had no choice there dessert, my family forgot to get one. It was a hit. My mother who is a very critical cook loved it and that she would rather eat this than any store bought cake. The Glaze that was suggested in an earlier review was fabulous. I have to admit though that when the cake was done in the oven, it looked odd. However since it was flipped over it didn't matter. It was great. This will definitaly be a dessert used on occassions other than Passover.

I had to make this totally diary free for a family member and semisweet chocolate has dairy fat in it. So I used 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon cocoa powder and 8 tablespoons coconut oil and 9 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar, mixed that with the dairy free margarine and put them in the micro for 10 seconds, instead of step 2.  It turned out perfectly. To make a pretty presentation I made a coulis of 1 cup frozen pineapple, 2 big slices mango, 1 banana and 1 cup almond milk (buzzed in the blender)and poured some on each plate before placing a piece of cake on it. Then I sprinkled toasted sliced almonds and coconut on top. For those who could eat dairy I added a squirt of ready whip on top. It was a huge hit.

This is a great Passover cake.  Moist and the taste reminds me of Brownies.  At the suggestion of other reviewers I topped it off with confectioners sugar and raspberries.  It received high praise from my brother-in-law which is rare.  Will definitely be making again!

Best passover dessert ever!  Tasted like the "flour less chocolate tortes" you would have in a nice restaurant.  I used Bob's red Mill almond flour.  I beat the egg whites by hand which was a huge holiday stress reliever!

I just made this the other day for the first time in a long time, so I thought I would review again. This time I decided to upgrade to 5 stars because it turned out better and some of that was because of technique (as in I realized the poorer result before was my fault) rather than the recipe. This time I was sure to grind the almonds very fine in small batches in my coffee grinder, which made for a nicer texture, and I baked the torte until a toothpick inserted into the middle came out nearly clean (about 55 minutes), which eliminated the too-raw centre but still remained moist and slightly fudgey. I forgot to cover with foil for the last 20 minutes but I actually really liked the crust that developed as a result, and kept it as the top since it looked appealing. I used coconut oil instead of margarine to make it dairy free. I added 2 1/2 tsp instant decaf coffee to the chocolate mixture while it melted which made for a lovely, deeper chocolate, slightly mocha flavour. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze again, this time with 2 tsp instant coffee added while melting which was such a lovely combination. The torte received raves and disappeared quickly; I will definitely be making it again, sooner this time.

Old review: I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could, but went with 4. It was quite tasty. I baked 45 minutes and it should have been more because it was runny in the middle, but it still tasted good. I ground slivered almonds in my coffee grinder, which worked pr

I made this for the 1st seder and it was a huge hit. i made this with butter (not parve) and iced it with the chocolate ganache recipe from this site (also not parve) and topped with sliced strawberries.
it's very rich and the perfect dessert for chocolate lovers! thanks for the recipe - i'll be making it again!

Great cake - everyone loved it, though I did not make it for passover, so I used butter.  I also substituted dark chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chocolate and decreased the sugar slightly.  Served it with homemade coffee ice cream.

Was pretty good but not stellar.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it didn't set up as firm (even in a very cold refrigerator) as I'd hoped--was pretty messy to serve.  Still, it tasted good.

I found some ground almonds near the 'use by' date as I was cleaning out the cupboard.  The all recipes search showed this, what a find!
So simple to make but so luxurious, definitely a recipe to keep.  Didn't have quite enough almonds so I scaled the quantities down to use 4 eggs and 6inch pan.

I should preface this by saying I am NOT an experience baker, so my problems with this recipe could very well be due to my own lack of skill.  I thought the torte was fine, but not anything special.  I could have made brownies from a box and they would have been a lot easier and possibly tastier.  I threw away the leftovers after the party.  Here is what I had problems with:
      The torte ended up being pretty flat and fell apart when I released it from the pan(Not enough grease on the foil?  Didn't let cool for full 10 minutes?  Why the tin foil anyway?)
       It took a lot longer to bake than stated to get the center to be "set" and not gooey (maybe too long?  Edges seemed a bit crispy, but the center was just no longer gooey when I took it out)
        The ground almonds did not grind very fine in my chopper, so it looked like it had bits of cous cous in it (I do not own a coffee grinder)
I tried to follow the recipe pretty closely, except I did use real butter instead of pareve margarine (yes, I know it defeats the purpose of it being a "passover" torte).  Also, I don't know if it matters, but I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of squares.  The torte just didn't have the density and rich taste I was expecting.  I will probaby not make this one again.

Followed the directions, exactly. It turned out beautifully--great texture and taste. I may not make it again  soon because the water bath is a bit of a pain, but it's definitely worth it. I used 60% chocolate  chips, and it was perfect. I served it with fresh whipped cream, made with a bit of vanilla and honey.

Made this for my first Passover and it was a huge hit. I served with rasberries and blackberries and the satiny chocolate glaze others have mentioned. I also ground my almonds in the coffee grinder - I didn't think they were quite fine enough but I seemed to be the only one who minded.
