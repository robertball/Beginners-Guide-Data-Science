Great little breakfast bread that's delicately spiced and not to mention moist! I did cut back on the sugar a bit and used 2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of melted butter.  I also subbed nutmeg for the ginger and added some raisins. I sprayed a 9x5 glass pan with Pam for baking and baked this at 350 for 55 minutes. Like others,I do think the baking time is off.  It smelled wonderful and was perfect with a cup of tea!

Maybe it's me, but I found the 9x5 pan waaay too small. I opted to use instead the only other option I had on hand: an 8x8. Still had to leave out a cup of the mix. Probably use a 9x9 next time. Other than that, very moist, great taste. Will definitely make again.

The cake was very moist and tender, with a very crunchy top.  As a 13-year-old boy I think that it's good enough to say "kids" love it (I do).  It was extremely easy to make, and took about 30 minutes to make.

Pretty darn good. 
I had enough batter for a large loaf pan and a mini loaf pan. To add some variety (rather than having two identical loaves) I added some thawed, frozen blueberries to the batter for the smaller loaf. Very nice addition!
I also added water to the powdered sugar to make a drizzle. Both loaves needed every bit of 30 minutes to bake plus a little more.

This is a great recipe for those in-the-clutch breakfast situations in which unexpected guests have stayed the night. All ingredients on hand and it goes together quickly.

Easy to make and tastes very good. The recipe makes more batter than will fit in one pan. I divided it between two 9x5 pans to make smaller loaves. I added a little water to the confectioner's sugar (to make a sugar glaze) and drizzled it over the top.

There were a few problems with this recipe. The baking time was way off for starters. 20-30 minutes for a 9x5 loaf? No way. I did check it at 30 minutes, but it was still liquid in the middle. I baked it for an additional 15 and it was nice and moist, but even a bit gooey at the bottom. The outside was a little dark at this point as well. The amount of sugar in this recipe is escessive. I cut each type of sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet. I opted to skip the powdered sugar because of this. This cake did sink in the middle as noted by another reviewer (see my photo). I'm not sure why others had a problem with the pan size. Perhaps their loaf pans are the smaller 8x4. I have both sizes and made sure to use the 9x5.  There was no danger of overflowing the pan. I'm sure it would easily have accomodated the 1/2 cup of sugar I left out. Possibly these reviewers added a large amount of raisins. I did not. In short, if you make this recipe, cut back on the sugar, make sure your loaf pan IS 9x5, bake 40 minutes before checking, and leave out the raisins if you want it to fit in the pan. You'll end up with a tasty coffee cake that doesn't need the additional powdered sugar.

This recipe made an enormous amount of batter, took awhile to put together and like others mentioned did not bake well.  Finished cake was very thick and heavy.  I won't make this again.

I thought I must have incorrectly measured the flour because after 30 minutes it was still liquidy in the middle. After reading review, I see that others had the same problem.Then put it bake in covered with aluminum foil for another 30 minutes. It was edible, but not very pretty. Sorry, but I definately will not make it again.

Added nutmeg rather than ginger (also used more cinnamon) and used a 9X9 pan to make it in. It was good that day and the next, but becomes very soggy after that.

Tasted great except I found it didn't cook in the 9x5  pan and the time was way too short. I cooked it for 42 minutes in a 9X9 pan and thought that worked great. And only used about half the powdered suger suggested.

After reading all the reviews, I really stressed about making this and it turns out I had a reason to.  I have not tasted this yet, but my kitchen smells delicious.  I used a 9 x9 baking dish and I had no problem with spillovers, but it took FOREVER to bake.  20-30 minutes..ha, more like 45+ and the center sunk in and I swear that the tooth pick is still not clean!!

Recently tried this I listened to other reviews about the bigger dish and it still made a mess of my oven. The flavor was good however the dish has to be experimented with. The middle took for ever to cook and the edges got real hard and crunchy after they ran over the edge and into the bottom of the oven.

This cake was very tasty and moist. I found it easy to make. I added a teaspoon of the spice mace and then topped it off with powdered sugar icing: cup of white powdered sugar, 1/3 cup of water, juice of 1/2 a lemon, fresh lemon zest, and a teaspoon of orange extract.  I had no problem using an 8x8 baking dish.

The only problem I have with this recipe is that it does produce a large amount of batter-- but I found that it's perfect baked in a 13x9 baking pan for about 35-40 minutes. That said, I loved this cake! It is very moist and the crunchy top is delicious. I left out the ginger (not a ginger fan) and thought it tasted great!

The 9x5 pan was way to small.  It sank in the middle, didn't cook all the way through, and after all the effort I put into making it, I will not make this recipe again.

I agree with a previous cook that 20-30 min was not enough for the glass loaf pan I used. It was at least 45 min and then the edges got overdone/crusty and the center sank too. I also found the taste to be ho-hum, like it was missing something. I don't think I'll try this again.

First time I made it, it didn't rise in the center plus had to leave it in for 45 minutes to cook through- which resulted in sides getting overcooked/burnt. Taste was good. Made it again today and this time substituted the brown sugar with white (as I had run out). It rose perfectly! Also decreased the butter (2Tbsp less). Cooked it for 45 min again. Batter remains lumpy and baked bread (yes- it's a bread- too dense to be cake) has a polka dot appearance which tastes raw when fresh but by the next day is great. It's not the best but think I'll keep this recipe- I like that it uses only 1 egg and is easy to mix together. Also, used 9x5 loaf pan both times with no issues.

My kids thought this made a great snack!
I doubled the cinnamon & nutmeg and used a 9x13 pan - baked for 20 minutes.
Yummy!

My husband is diabetic so I used his sugar. He loves apple anything so I put in only 1 diced apple since it was just one loaf, and threw in some raisins.  Nuts would have been great in it but I'm out. It rose nicely and is moist. Tastes good according to the hubby. I'm making a couple more loaves with real sugar tomorrow for my family. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe because it was one of the only ones that didn't call for sour cream.  I had already had a 9 x 9 pan prepared so that's what I used and it turned out perfectly.  It stayed moist, very flavorful and a great morning treat.  I added pecan pieces before baking it and it was a nice touch.

My husband and 4 children love this coffee cake!  It is super moist and stays that way for over a week. I did make a couple of minor changes, I bake this in a 9x13 pan for about 50 minutes and then when it is partially cool I drizzle it with a simple milk/powdered sugar glaze.  It is amazing, I hope you try it!

So, I made this because I had a BUNCH of kids coming to my house early in the am on short notice and I happened to have all the ingredients. Needless to say, it was a huge hit! Feeds 7 hungry kids and three harried moms nicely.
