May I make a suggestion?  Try filling with SOLO brand fillings instead of jelly.  They have poppyseed, lecvar, apricot, nut etc....The absolute best cookie my mom made for Christmas.

These cookies are great and remind me of my Grandma's recipe.  If you're having trouble rolling out the dough, be sure to use it cold.  If it is refrigerated before rolling out, it won't stick to the rolling pin and will be much easier to work with.

Thank you Della, these were divine!  I rolled them in red and green crystal sugar instead of icing sugar (which I find too messy), and they were very festive for Christmas.  Make sure you seal them well before baking so the jam doesn't leak out.  I found the dough quite easy to work with.

Wow, these are fantastic! I kinda got obsessed about trying to make sure the jelly didn't leak out during baking--at least at first. Then, I realized it didn't matter. If you almost immediately roll in sugar/cinnamon mixture--the mixture "spackles" the leak. These cookies just melt in your mouth. The make a great holiday cookie.  I used blackberry and raspberry preserves. Yummy!

Everyone loved these. I recommend chilling the dough before rolling out and filling to avoid a sticky mess. I used blackberry jam to fill them, and they turned out absolutely delicious.

This was worth the time & effort to make these little pastries!  Not being sure of how they would turn out (they were added to my annual Christmas cookie list) not having any sugar in the recipe......you'll never miss the sugar (unless you roll them in sugar after baking)!  The recipe was what my boyfriend has been trying to explain to me that his grandmother made when he was younger.....I'll be experimenting with different fillings next time (walnut; poppyseed, etc.)!  This even prompted me to explore the internet on the origin of Kolacky which is quite interesting in itself.  Thanks for sharing such a tasty recipe, Della!

These weren't that great.  I only made half the recipe and had to add more flour because it was too sticky.  I also added more sugar to dough.  I filled it with my homemade cherry jam which was the best part of the cookie.  They do melt in your mouth - but I don't like that kind of texture in a cookie. Probably won't make again.

This recipe is great and I think the low reviews are very unfair.  Most bakers know if cookie dough is too soft, you just put it in the fridge a few hours.  Also, most kolacky dough does have cream cheese in it and is not sweet.  It is not supposed to be.  Also, the raw dough does taste very different than the baked cookie.  If you have never made kolackies before, you should look over a few recipes before making them so you know the tips.

I had a little trouble rolling the dough too, but in the end it was all worth it!  These cookies were an absolute hit with some very picky eaters.  I used red plum jam.  Fabulous!

What did I do wrong?  The dough was too soft.  I refrigerated it twice, added additional flour to keep it from sticking and still no luck.  I felt guilty throwing it out because of the 4 sticks of butter I used!

This made a nice cookie.  I sprinkled them with both cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar.  It made an attractive cookie plate.

Made these for our youth group last night, instead of jam or preserves I used a can of peach pie filling, just chopped up the peaches so I could put about 1/2 teaspoon in each cookie.  Everyone loved them.  My daughter has celiacs so I'm going to make some c gluten free flour, let you know how they turn out.

I did half of the recipe but I had to add more flour to it but I would suggest putting the dough in the fridge for at least 45 minutes. But otherwise a really great recipe to build on!

Something went wrong. Everything was going great until I cooked them. The dough was quite pasty and didn't seem to cook properly. I tried a few adjustments to my cooking time but it didn't work.

I tried this recipe after my daughter sent a few of her cookies made from her mother-in-laws recipe
and I think that the person who submitted it forgot to add any sugar for as one review stated it would make a great pie crust.  I didn't cook the whole batch and added some sugar to the last of it and they wre very good.  I just dropped them with a cookie scoop and dusted with cinnamon sugar from a shaker bottle.
