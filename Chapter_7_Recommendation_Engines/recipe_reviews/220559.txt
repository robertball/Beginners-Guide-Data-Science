This was good! I did tweak a bit (= I thought I had a can of diced green chilies - but, instead, had a large bag in the freezer - which I didn't want to mess with, to use 2 tbsp. I used cilantro jalape√±o tortillas and added sriracha and chopped cabbage that I needed to use up. I layered cheese, beef, cabbage, cheese, sriracha between the tortillas. Next time, I would add a layer of glue [cheese] between the beef and cabbage. I liked the crunch the cabbage added. The sriracha worked well [since I didn't have available diced green chilies]. I would definitely make this again (=

I used Swiss cheese, perfectly great way to use up leftover corned beef.

This was very good, and we enjoyed the kick from the green chilies.  The flavors blended well, but the next time we have these, I am adding some well drained sauerkraut to the mix.  Served these with tri-colored gnocchi with 'Creamy Alfredo Sauce' from AR.

What a neat way to use up left over corned beef.  I wasn't sure how these flavors would mesh, but these were really pretty good.  A nice change from the standard quesadilla.  Thanks.

Easy, delicious meal for almost any leftover meat. I had some leftover corned beef, which was delicious, and some leftover shredded beef. That was great, too!

I really enjoyed this!  Surprisingly, this went super well with Trader Joes Garlic and Chipotle salsa.  I just dipped it right in and it was delish!
