These were a big hit with my niece and nephews! Green Booger cookies for Halloween and they taste great! And now that I know what they look like when they're done, I can make the next batch look like eyeballs by using vanilla pudding mix and white chocolate chips, colored frosting in the thumbprint and a chocolate chip in the center. Plus a little red frosting drizzled on the white cookie part to look like a bloodshot eyeball!!!

Easy and fun to make, taste great! Next time I make this I will add green food coloring to the cookie dough, before adding the food color to get a greener cookie. Also make large thumb holes so that kiss fits all the way in, if you force it in then cookies will crack.

Had to amend from my original 3 stars.  My son took these to school in his lunch one day, and the boy sitting next to him asked that I make them again so he could have more.  Good reviews from the kids, I just wasn't big on the powdered sugar frosting.  May use frosting in a tube next time or none at all.

I love the taste of these.  My husband and I made them and used both Hershey's Kisses and Rolos.  The Rolos on top were delicious.  The only thing I might do differently next time is use orange frosting.  All the green made me think of St. Patty's Day - I realize it's the "booger" theme but I still thought orange rosting might make them seem more Halloween-ish.  Great recipe!!!!!

These are really cute but lack in taste a little. Not sure why or what but it needs something. Cute idea though.

Easy to make and tasty. The size suggestion for rolling the dough into 1" balls was a little off - it's somewhere between 1-1/2" to 2". I would suggest getting more kisses and making 36 1" balls. Also, I was left with a lot of icing to get rid of. I'd suggest halving the icing and making more, if needed.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! My daughter got a kick out of the name of the cookies of course but they were delicious. I was worried about the taste based off the ingredients. I packaged some as Halloween gifts for kids and co-workers. Everyone asked for the recipe. Will definitely be making these again soon. Cool thing is, you can play around with different pudding flavors.

My sister had made these & my 2 yr old loved them & so did I. I wasn't sure about the pistachio, but once I tasted them they were delicious. Definitely something different to mix it up when in a baking rut.

These were ok - pretty cute but taste wise they were kind of flat.  Perhaps a bit of salt as the pistachio pudding mix I used had very little salt. The kids I fed these to were excited and liked them a lot, but they are cookie fiends.  The idea is very cute, if I try again I'd used the idea/method but try a different base recipe for the cookie.

THESE ARE GREAT!!  I can't believe they don't have more ratings.  I made them for Halloween last year, loved them so much made them for a cookie swap for xmas and got best cookie!  One change I made for the swap was to put in chocolate chips instead of one big hershey kiss.

Oops yes I used real butter, but always use it anyway. Oh and since not being a milk person, I used 2 Tablespoons of Pumpkin spice coffee cream! Took them to our church carry-in supper and they were a huge thumbs up except the name. 
ha  Happy Halloween everyone....patsy

I have a very similar recipe that I bake all the time and love. I just think that maybe adding on the green frosting not only adds too much sweetness but makes the cookie look weird. On the bright side they still taste amazing.

We made these cookies for St. Patrick's Day and they were a hit. Substituted the frosting listed with a cream cheese frosting to add a more flavorful punch.

Who can resist a cookie with this name.  Easy and quick enough to make with kids. Very fun and can be adapted to make other colors for other occasions. Kind of like a light green sugar cookie with candy on top. Followed the recipe and got about 36 cookies.  Will definitely make again.

Made these fun cookies today for my daughter's neighborhood Halloween party tomorrow!  They are yummy and super cute!  I did substitute butter for the margarine!  (Haven't used that stuff in years!)  I'm visiting the family in Colorado so my baking skills are being tested!  I had to increase the heat a bit and they took a little longer to bake.  My grandson gave them a thumbs up so I'm happy with this recipe.  Thanks!

Eh..  Not impressed.  I loved the idea and thought they would be great.  But the were bland.  plus they needed to bake a lot longer than the 10 to 14 minutes as suggested.  Maybe a little less flour if I make them again.
