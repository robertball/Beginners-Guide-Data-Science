We really liked this dish! I pounded out the chicken and then rolled the Brie and sage inside. It is definitely on the rotation menu!
We’ve made this several times and even with pork chops! It’s great!!

This was delicious! I did make it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. There are only two of us, so this made enough for dinner and two lunches. LOVED the glaze!

The sage is overpowering. Would recommend using way less.

Excellent recipe. I used fresh basil instead of sage and it tasted fantastic. I would recommend using less salt on the chicken as the prosciutto and Brie are both salty to begin with so extra salt is really not needed. Will definitely make this again!

This was easy and delicious! My son and husband were crazy about it. The sweet sauce, ham, and Brie cheese are a  great combination. I cooked it in the oven for 25 minutes. Next time I would put foil underneath the chicken because it kind of carmelizes on the glass baking  dish.

This is a tasty dish. Very good. The sauce is a must to help balance out to the flavors. I'm a bit of a cheese geek so using brie was fun...and delicious. This recipe gets added to my favorites.  Thanks for sharing it.
