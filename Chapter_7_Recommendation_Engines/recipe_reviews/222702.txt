This recipe is wonderfull. BTW if you can't make the recipe like it is printed first time around then don't get on here and give a review. Nobody wants to here what you would do so get over yourself.

Great recipe but I did change a few things. As we are only two of us, 8 servings was a bit much. Here is what I did: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 tblsp each balsamic vinegar and soy sauce, 1 tspn brown sugar, pinch of salt and pepper, 2 zucchinis, half each green and red bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic, half a small onion and four mushrooms halved.

Boiled five small potatoes, quartered. Pan fried potatoes in a tablespoon butter, added marinated vegetables and pan fried them for about 15 minutes on medium heat. At the ten minute point, I sprinkled a pinch of rosemary over the vegetables. Served with sirloin steak off  the grill.

This was a great recipe to start with but I just can't follow a recipe to the letter.

Yum!!! Made these this weekend and they were devoured. I threw all my leftover veggies in - carrots, squash, zucchini, broccoli, red onion chunks, green onions. Only change I made was to add a teaspoon of brown sugar.  I marinated them for a couple of hours. My grill basket was a little too large for the veggies, so put some alum. foil down. Delish!!

Wowee this is good.  I marinaded all day in a ziploc.  Just threw in a bunch of veggies that I had in the fridge...peppers, baby bella shrooms, asparagus, onions.  It started pouring down rain just as I was stepping out to grill, so cooked in oven...worked fine.  Single layer of veggies, 425 dgrees, 12 minutes total, flip at 6 mins.

Great side dish. Since I was cooking chicken in the oven at 425 degrees, I decided to cook them simultaneously. To marinade the vegetables, I cut peppers, onions, squash, butternut squash into squares, put them all into a gallon size plastic bag and poured the marinade in. After shaking the bag vigorously I laid it on the counter, turning it occasionally for a couple of hours. I removed the vegetables, spread them on a cookie sheet and baked them for 8 minutes on each side. Turned out wonderful.

Made this yesterday and it was excellent. All I had was 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash and a few red and yellow mini bell peppers.  Followed recipe as written except vegs marinated longer because we had a later supper than I planned. Great go-to recipe with easily available ingredients!

This is a great recipe for summer.  I grill the veggies early and just let the platter sit until dinner. Fabulous at room temperature.  This recipe is at the top of my "summer favorites" list!!

Great recipe as is.  Have also made modifications that I think made it tastier - simply adding a tablespoon of sugar and a bit of garlic &/or onion powder, but great with or without changes.

I've made this multiple times because it's easy, tastes good, and doesn't overwhelm the flavors of the vegetables.  However, I don't use the exact vegetables called for in the recipe; I just use what I have on hand.  Therefore, this review is based solely on the marinade, not on what it's mixed with.  The original recipe does state any vegetables can be used, though, so I feel like it's still fair to add my review!

I've made this countless times with minor/major revisions and it always comes out great! I put them on pans in the oven at whatever temp whatever else in the oven is cooking at for as long as it takes for them to be done and although not as crazy good as when grilled they're still fantastic. Fool proof recipe!

Nice concept, though I agree w/ other comments re: too much oil and too long in the marinade (a quick toss will do), but the soy and balsamic are nice additions.  We use this approach for nearly all our veggies during grilling season: broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, onions, potatoes -- all come out great.  Also, we use a basket-style metal container right on the grill -- it makes cooking much simpler and you can cut the veggies into similar size pieces for equal cooking time.

I just used zucchini, red pepper and red onion since I didn't have eggplant & hubby doesn't like it anyway.  Well we both loved it and he went back for seconds.  Thanks for a simply delicious recipe!

The balsamic vinegar makes the dish and adds a nice sweetness to everything.  Add tablespoon of Chipotle Tabasco sauce for awesome flavor.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of the vegetables I chose--squash, zuchini, onions, mushrooms, bell peppers).  I tripled the recipe because I was cooking for my husband's volleyball team.  It turned out great!

This is simply a fabulous, delicious recipe! I have made it several times using a variety of vegetables (mushrooms, onions, orange peppers, yellow peppers), but a huge hit was the sweet potatoes I added.  The only change I made was using 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Always a hit! IF any are left, they are the first thing people want to wrap up and take home,

Very good flavor!!  I added some sliced portobello mushrooms which soaked up the marinade nicely!  I put these on a grill pan so they would fall through the grates.  YUM!

I followed the recipe. The eggplant soaked up a ton of oil. Rather just grill the vegetables plain if you really want their flavours to shine.

Great recipe!   I omitted the soy sauce and used cut the olive oil to 1/4 c.  We used a veggie griddle on the grill - it was delicious!

Great recipe. I cooked on a cast iron grill skillet since I don't have a grill and I wound up adding a little red wine because it smelled like it would be good with red wine. It cooked down more than I thought it would post-wine but 100%, definitely making this again. It would be good with any vegetable, it's a great recipe for using up whatever vegetables you have left at the end of the week.

Was unable to use grill tonight so followed other reviewers suggestion and roasted at 425 for about 7 minutes per side.  Flavor was good.  Will try again on the grill.  I might consider skipping the salt and pepper in the marinade and just seasoning the veggies before cooking as well.

We loved these!  I used the vegetables I had on hand which were zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, onion and mushrooms.  I made half the amount of marinade, but cut the oil to 2 T.  I used all of it to marinade, so I didn’t have any leftover to serve along side.  But no problem, the flavor was great.  Hubs grilled these for 7 minutes over high heat.  The only change I would make next time is to add a little  brown sugar, maybe 1/2 t. for my half recipe, as others have suggested.

I followed the recipe very closely except for using yellow squash instead of zucchini (I prefer them), adding crimini mushrooms, and onions, and substituting red and orange peppers for the green peppers (also a personal preference).  The marinade was spot on.  I served it over quinoa.  Will definitely fix again.

I look for easy and healthy dishes for the summer.  Grilled veggies are the perfect choice.  This dish was easy and tasty.  It is nice enough to serve company.  I find that whenever I serve grilled veggies I have to double the amount I prepare.  Everyone loves them.

This recipe is simple and delectable. I added a capful of lemon juice for taste. I used olive oil instead of sesame oil and skipped the sesame seeds. The only downside of this dish was that the sauce burned and sticked to the skillet.

Marinade was so delicious.  Any veggies you have would work.  Be sure to cut them about all the same size so they get done at the same time.

This is a great recipe for grilled veggies.  I omitted the egg plant and did the grilling in a grilling basket.  I cut the corner off my marinating bag to save the marinade for the cooked veggies.  I didn't brush any on while grilling.  My wife and I loved them.  This is on the summer recipe list now!

Oh my gosh, this is good. I love veggies and this is perfect for me. I didn't put as much basalmic vinegar and oil in it as it calls for. Course, I cut the recipe. The soy sauce adds a lot, as does all the seasoning. Will definitely keep this one handy.

i've been struggling with veggie marinades lately.  All the top ones rated highly in google sort of suck ,...but i decided to try this one.  It's  SOLID.  It's very strong, FYI, so not your every day marinade. but if you want super-tasty properly cooked veggies, this is a great one to add to your repotoire.... Especially great with Red Onions, Mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes cooked in foil on the bbq. These veggies just soak up the vinegar and become a bit caramelized. ;)

Veggies were fine maybe too bland, we were unimpressed with the marinade. Would have been better with just olive oil balsamic and some garlic salt.

Apparently I don't like eggplant. More zucchini, red pepper, and mushrooms would improve this for my taste.

It just needs a little more salt, but other than that, excellent!  When I can't do it on the grill, I spread the vegetables on a cookie sheet with sides, and cook it in the oven @ 400 for about 15 minutes.

I made the marinade exactly as stated in the recipe but roasted the veggies at 425 for 12 minutes.  It was perfect, and I plan to add different veggies next time.  The eggplant was especially good.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It felt as if it was missing something to really make the flavors come together.

Made the marinade exactly as described but omitted the eggplant in favor of some mushrooms, purple onions, a blend of sweet peppers and some zucchini.  Really, really good!!!

Made the recipe, pretty much as written. The vegetables were too hard for my husband to eat so I ended up putting them into the oven to cook for more time. I don't think I will make again.

Loved it! Used mushrooms and added a dob of bacon fat (I'm still cooking in 1970) and my family was over the moon. Great for critters who don't normally like veggies.

Great recipe for my first time making grilled vegetables.  I used zucchini, red peppers, mushrooms and onions.  I made the marinade in a sealable plastic bag then added the vegetables.  This made it easy to rotate when marinating.

I mixed up the marinade, and placed it in a ziplock bag.  I needed to clean my fridge out before vacation, so I used green bell pepper, red bell pepper, purple onion, and a head of cauliflower.  I rinsed them cut them into large pieces and placed them in the bag.  I rotated the bag several times to make sure the marinade soaked into all the vegetables.  This recipe caused a bit of a fire on the grill from the oil, so make sure you drain off the marinade well before putting veggies on the grill.  The vegetables were amazing, and we can't wait to try this recipe again with a variety of vegetables.  We don't like egg plant, so probably will never make it, but we will be using this recipe again with vegetables that suit our taste.

Delicious!! I've always hated aubergine... at least, until now. I recommend that nobody skimps on the marinating time, although the fresh flavours alone are also wonderful. Thanks for sharing!
