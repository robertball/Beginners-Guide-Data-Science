I browned cubes of lite kielbasa in the pan first, then used the little bit of grease they gave up to saute the onion.  Used a 16oz bag of coleslaw mix instead of carrots and cabbage.  And added a couple handfuls of frozen peas at the end.  Some steamed broccoli on the side made this a complete meal.

This was good, although I really modified the amounts of the ingredients.  I felt it was way too heavy on the sausage.  I diced 8 oz. of fully cooked kielbasa, fried it, drained it, and then blotted out as much grease as possible--my 1/2 lb. turned out to be 4 oz.  For this amount of meat, the other things I CHANGED were: used 1 medium onion, 2 large carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, 9 oz. (by weight) of cabbage coleslaw mix, and 2 cups of pre-cooked rice.  This made 2 large main-dish portions that were not at all greasy.  Serve it with a sweet fruit, such as red grapes or cantaloupe.  A very fast, simple, and good dinner, esp. if the meat is prepared ahead of time.  Yum.

Really good...however I made a few slight changes; I used Turkey Kielbasa, brown rice and a whole bag of preshredded Angel Hair Cabbage. I also cooked the egg seperately(fried/scrambled) before assembling the final dish.

This is a dish we make more often these days.  I would re-emphasize using left-over rice as opposed to fresh rice.  Also, you probably don't need the oil; the sausage we use has enough oil so I brown the meat first and then fry everything in the sausage oil.  The trick is getting flavorful, spicy sausage (if you don't use kielbasa), which adds more flavor because otherwise it's bland.

They modified this recipe before they posted it. One of the MOST important things with fried rice is to use rice that is a day old. If you use fresh cooked rice, it makes the recipe mushy.  If the rice was cooked a day before, it is a little firmer and fries up better.

Made this with chicken instead of Kielbasa!   WAS GREAT!   Def scramble the eggs ahead of time and then just mix in - so easy!   I added some peanut sauce as another review suggested.  Will def make again!

If I were to do this recipe again, there are many things I would change including cooking the eggs first, it made the rice super sticky to cook it all together.

This recipe is outstanding!  I was looking for something to use my supersized head of cabbage for this week other than the usual coleslaw...  I did not have kielbasa on hand, so substituted chicken breast.  I used rice noodles instead of rice.  My family ADORED this combination!  So.....PLAY with this recipe!  (I even added my last zucchini on hand!)  HINT:  A smathering of Padang peanut sauce for those who like it spicy is delightful!!

This turned out very good and even my picky 5 year-old ate some!  I have always made a similar recipe, but liked the addition of cabbage.  The only thing I did different was to pull the veges to one side of the pan, add a bit of butter to keep them from sticking, and cooked the beaten eggs before mixing them with the veges and adding the rice and soy sauce. Like another reviewer, I tried it with chicken and loved it that way.  It would also be very good with the kielbasa.  I will try it that way when I have some.  I like adding frozen peas at the end as well. Very good way to use leftover rice!

I really enjoyed this.  I saute'd the veggies in about 5 tbsp of evoo.  Added kielbasa (turkey), then scrambled the eggs separately.  Added the eggs and rice to the skillet and simmered for about 5 minutes.  I only added about 1 tbsp of soy sauce.  Yummy!

This was a great recipe to use up the leftovers I had from previous nights dinners. I didn't use the sausage this time since I used leftover turkey breast instead. I also didn't need the eggs because the rice I used was the sticky calrose I had leftover from making sushi (which is also where the shredded carrots came from). It reminds me of the fried rice from the vietnamese restaurant with the chinese sausage and shrimps (instead of kiebasa).  My kids absolutely loved it, so I will definitely be making this again.  (And I won't wait for leftovers from other meals either).

The kielbasa gave the rice an off taste. I gave it 3 stars because the rice tasted really good by itself without the meat. Next time I will try it with chicken or shrimp.

The Kielbasa Fried Rice is absolutely DELICIOUS!! Instead of using a whole head of cabbage and large carrots, I used a cole slaw mix-since it does contain cabbage and carrots. According to the recipe, the eggs are supposed to be cooked with the rice, but I didn't follow that step. I wanted the sausage, onions and garlic to brown first, and then scrambled the eggs. Once I added the rice, the eggs were already cooked. Since I didn't have time to cook the rice the day before, using fresh rice wasn't mushy. I served the fried rice with some egg rolls. I will definitely make this recipe again, but continue to use a cole slaw mix, and fresh rice. :-)

Awesome! I am not a huge fan of sausage but I wanted to follow the recipe first before I made changes. The family LOVED this! I have added this to my recipe box and will be making this again.. maybe I'll try chicken or shrimp next time.
I had a broccoli/carrot mix (like a slaw mix) on hand so that's what I used. Excellent! Oh - and you can never go wrong with the Padang Peanut Sauce!!

I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of using brown rice instead of white rice. I found the recipe benefited greatly upon serving with the addition of copious amounts of tabasco sauce. It was good, but it was soooooo much better with a healthy dose of the elixer from Avery Island. My mouth waters as I type. Call me Pavlov's dog.

It was pretty good, but not amazing.  My husband absolutely loved it and took nearly all the leftovers the next day, leaving me no lunch!  But my kids were not impressed.  One ate it, but only gave it a 5 on a 1-10 scale.  My littlest one took a bit of prodding to eat it. I thought it was good, but the ingredients just didn't seem to "go together".

My husband loved this and I thought it was very good also. I cooked my rice earlier in the day and let it chill in the fridge. I used frozen peas and carrots, cabbage and green onions, only because I didn't have an onion. It turned out very well! Thanks!

When made for 6 people, you'd need a VERY large skillet to fit it all in!  I used a bit less cabbage and rice than the recipe called for and it still turned out great. About 2 Tbsp of soy sauce is good. Next time I might try frying the rice with soy sauce separately, then mixing together with the kielbasa etc.

This turned out better than I expected!  I used a combo of brown/white rice, bagged cole-slaw cabbage/carrot mix, and added extra chopped carrots, onions, and celery.  I'm really glad I added the extra veggies.  Also, I scrambled the first egg, dumped it in, and it seemed to disappear (my rice probably wan't hot enough).  So I scrambled and cooked the rest of the eggs in the microwave before i added them, which worked much better.

You'd think that this was a really weird combo of ingredients. It isn't. I stumbled upon this looking for uses of leftover rice-- and decided to try it. April Jr. has texture issues w/ fried rice, so I thought that all the vegetable matter would counteract the rice texture-- and it did.

My two substitutions: 1) turkey kielbsa instead of regular 2)instead of the 1/4 head of cabbage grated, I used pre-shredded broccoli slaw. I grated the carrots, and put in equal volume of the broccoli slaw. Also-- I ended up cooking this dish in a wok, because our lidded skillets were too small to hold all the ingredients.

A final note: don't worry if you find things sticking to the bottom of the skillet/wok during the stirfry process. The lid on (and stirring every 2 min) in the final 10 min. of cooking phase does wonders for loosening up whatever had stuck.

We love this recipe! I don't really modify it that much. I made it exactly as the recipe reads the first time and pretty much every time. I just use a bag of coleslaw instead of chopping my own cabbage.

I wouldn't call this an exceptional dish, but it is an easy, tasty way to use up leftover white rice from Chinese takeout. And, since leftover white rice means I've had Chinese food recently, I appreciate that the kielbasa changes the flavor profile a bit.

My wife told me I need to cook more often after making this. :) I used less cabbage, fewer carrots and substituted white rice for jasmine rice. What a wonderful meal that I will definitely make again!

This recipe was ok, but adding eggs into the rice is completely unnecessary. It did not add to the dish's quality. My wife hated the egg. Other than that, it's an ok recipe.

I have always wanted to make fried rice and this recipe worked beautifully for my novice skill level.  I was going to make it with the kielbasa but had some leftover salmon I needed to use so opted for that.  I also didn't have cabbage so I added a little chinese 5 spice powder for flavor (don't use much, my light sprinkle was almost too much).  It turned out awesome. I love recipes that make good foundations for many dishes, and this is my new favorite recipe for leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

I doubled this and instead of doubling the meat, I just added more chopped veggies. Like baby bell peppers and shredded zucchini. I also used brown rice, which I cooked in chicken broth, then cooled. I didn't add the zucchini until the very end, with the cabbage, as I didn't want it to get mushy. My husband ate a double portion at dinner and then went back for the rest that was leftover at the end of the day. My son inhaled his, then ate his brother's. This one is a make again because not only was I able to cook on the cheap, I got most of my men to eat veggies. NOTE: If you're like me and struggle to cook the eggs with the fried rice without them coming out undercooked, cook them seperately. I cook mine in sesame oil, scrambled, until done on both sides. Then, I shred into bitty pieces. Works perfectly. No undercooked eggs!

I did change a few things. I used low sodium soy sauce, and scrambled the eggs before adding them. We like spicy, so I added 1/4 tsp of Paprika and about a tablespoon of red chili powder. I also diced a small can of pineaple chunks, and added them slowly till I liked the flavor. I only used about 1tsp of the juice. It was fantastic!!! No leftovers tonight:)

This is going into my "Favorites" list.  The only changes I made was to brown the kielbasa first, substituted 1# of sauerkraut for the cabbage, and scrambled the eggs separately before adding them.  It was even better the second day!  I might add some peas to the mixture next time.

This is a great quick and easy put together meal. I browned my rice first as I enjoy the nutty flavor it brings out and used green onion plus a few more seasonings. Family enjoyed this one and thank you!
