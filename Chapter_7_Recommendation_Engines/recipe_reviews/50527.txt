This was really tasty. I used boneless chicken breasts and browned them for a few minutes on each side in crushed garlic and butter. I simmered the sauce in a separate large pan and threw in some chopped green onions, red pepper flakes, orange zest, cornstach for thickness, and omitted the cranberries. Then I put the browned chicken in with the sauce and cooked it till it was no longer pink inside. Then I sliced the breast up and served in on a bed of rice, topped with a little extra sauce. It was really REALLY good. The leftovers tasted even better because the orange flavor soaked through the meat.

Update:

1.Use boneless chicken (bones are a hassle).
2. Marinade the chicken in some soy sauce and chopped garlic.
3. If you want the sauce thicker, add a little cornstarch.
4. Optional: Too sweet? I like sweet food but for those who want to cut the sweetness, a) reduce the OJ and add some low sodium chicken stock or b)add a splash of rice vinegar...however this changes the recipe to a sweet and sour recipe.

Super recipe! And soooo easy. My husband & I both loved it.  The only thing I changed was the cranberries.  I had dried Michigan cherries in my fridge so I used them(finally a use those cherries) and am glad I did because they were a tad tart.  Also, I took about a cup of the juice and thickened it a little for a sauce which was also a hit with the Mister.  This is a keeper.  Thanks, Jaynine!

Pretty good recipe, very unusual. I like my chicken crispy, so after 45 min cooking in Dutch oven I took pieces out of sauce and placed them in a Pyrex baking dish - another 15 min at 450 - 500 F. Also added fresh cranberries at this point - added a little tangy flavor. The chicken formed wonderful crust, and all cranberries mixed together into sweet-and-sour clusters. Saved orange sauce was used to pour over the rice. If you follow these instructions, keep the sauce in a separate container - this way chicken will stay crispy.

My family loved this! First I lightly browned 2-1/2 lbs. boneless, skinless thighs (trimmed of excess fat). For the sauce, I cut the orange juice down to 1 cup and simmered the chicken in the marmalade/juice/cranberries for 10 minutes. Then I stirred in 1/2 tsp. salt along with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp. orange juice, and simmered the dish for 5 minutes more. It was perfect--moist, sweet, and delicious. I served it with long grain and wild rice, salad, and bread for a very tasty meal. Thank you for a wonderful new family favorite!

I used freshly squeezed orange juice, mixed alittle cornstarch into the sauce after the chicken was cooked to thicken it up, & served it with Jasmine rice, & steamed veggies. Huge hit! A very easy & extremely tasty recipe. Thank you!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sauteed boneless breasts with a little garlic.  Thickened the sauce with some cornstarch/OJ, added some red pepper flakes and orange rind.
It was not overly sweet this way.  Served over rice.  Big hit!

My husband and I enjoyed this chicken. My kids did not like it, but I was pretty sure they would dislike such an "unconventional" chicken. I have used the left-overs in a spinach salad and it was excellent!

My family and friends love this recipe! I add garlic, soy sauce, boneless skinless chicken breasts and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it up. I like to add a little more orange marmalade because we love the orange flavor. This is a keeper.

This is very sweet and delicious. I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit more and use chicken breasts instead. The sauce rehydrates the dried cranberries really nicely while it boils.

This recipe is very flexible, and still turns out great! Instead of orange marmalade, and orange juice, I had apricot jam, lemonade concentrate, and  some orange juice box type snack drinks. it turned out quite well even with a lacking inventory.

We loved this recipe.  I did a brine on bone-in chicken breasts for 2.5 hours which may have been overkill. The chicken was almost too moist, if that's possible.  The huge chicken breasts were done at 30 minutes with the lid on the pot. I put craisens in with 5 minutes to go and they were just right.  I added a concoction of 2T water and 2T corn starch (mixed) to the remaining liquid and boiled it on high for just a few minutes.  The gravy is slightly sweet but probably not too overpowering since my husband enjoyed it; he doesn't like anything that's remotely too sweet. Without the gravy, the chicken barely hinted of orange flavor and needed extra seasoning or ketchup, if you're one of my children.

Just tried the bbq sauce of this submitter last week and thought I would try the another of her recipes this week. It was very good, I like the tartnees of the cranberries (especially when they plumped up) and the sweetness of the orange. I did season my chicken with a little Adobo, but other than that I kept the recipe the same. I served over white rice. I will definitely make this again.

This is truly the best recipe I have found so far. I love this chicken and I make it often!
There are a few small changes which I prefer and find easier.
I use chicken breasts instead of chicken on the bone.
I also used jarred cranberries and omit the orange marmalade. Don't forget the cranberries though as they add the perfect tang to them! I did once and I noticed right away. The cranberries are the "secret" ingredient for this recipe.
Like other posters suggested, it tastes delicious served on rice.
Slice a few oranges or lemons to add while simmering...yummm!
I would eat this every day of the week if I could :)
Thanks so much for the recipe, I am definitely keeping it!
P.S. to the people who found it too sweet: use natural unsweetened orange juice!

I will say that my 2 year old son was all about this chicken!  I was not a huge fan ..had to add some red pepper flakes to tone down that sweetness.  Maybe what I was looking for was a sweet and sour recipe?

I loved it.  I used chicken tenders (the little strips of chicken) and used 1 cup of orange juice instead of 1 1/3. I thickened it up with some flour and water.  I would make more gravy next time. I served it over couscous.  Very yummy!

I played with the recipe a little.  I used chicken breasts and pan fried them.  I also added a little bit of red pepper flakes for some heat and cornstarch for a thicker sauce.  I found it a little too sweet and it seemed to be missing something.  I probably would make it again and play with it a little more.

This was an excellent great tasting and easy recipe.  I added extra orange juice and 1/4 cup of marmalade so that I was sure the chicken would get done enough.  Then I followed the advice of one of the reviews and thickened the sauce with cornstarch after pouring out some excess orange juice.  I cooked the chicken a bit longer to make sure it was done and it came off the bone really easy when we ate it which actually made it easier to eat.

Did not have orange marmalade, so I just substituted in chicken broth to my taste. What I also added was pine nuts to the brew. Delicious! I then added a side of pre-packaged Stove Top Stuffing and when you mixed the orange/cranberry/pinenut sauce with the Stove Top Stuffing, oh, yum-yum! Very delicious!

I thought the sauce was a little too thin so I reduced it quite a bit before adding to chicken tenders.That didn't help much so I added cornstarch. I browned the tenders first then added the sauce. I added garlic, ginger, salt and pepper to the sauce. In the end I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. I liked this but my kids didn't.

This tasted pretty good with a few modifications...I omitted the marmalade and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I also sautéed  a tiny bit of onion and garlic in some olive oil, then added the chicken breast.  Meanwhile, I simmered the orange juice and cranberries and added some corn starch to thicken.  I too served it over rice.

This is ok, but just ok. Not good enough to put into the regular rotation. It was too sweet and there wasn't enough of any other flavor to balance that out. Again, it wasn't bad, but we likely won't be making it again soon.

My family loves this one!  It's so easy to make... I can throw it together in no time.  I always add a tbsp or two of cornstarch mixed with OJ at the end to thicken up the sauce.  Goes great with wild rice!

Good for a quick, simple meal.  Left as is for the kids.  Followed others advice for the hubby and for me (added red pepper flakes). 

For people looking for sweet and sour chicken, this is not it.  Keep the ingredients in mind before making if this is what you are looking for (remember you need vinegar when making sweet and sour chicken)

Always a favorite. Tastes great as leftovers. I cook this on med-low for  a little over an hour and always add some cornstarch. Very tasty! The flavor is subtle, but the chicken is tender as can be.

I didn't think it was sweet enough and the sauce wasn't very thick.

This was easy and great!  To add to the cooking directions, I boiled the sauce, then put the lid on and cut down to med-low heat for about 20 minutes.  I whisked in 2T of flour and let simmer without the cover to thicken the sauce.  It would be delicious over rice.  The only addition I made to the recipe was that I threw in the tail end (1T) of fatfree huckleberry vinagrette.  I doubt this changed the flavor much, though.  The marmalade I used is on the tart side, so that might account for the difference in the sweetness.  A sweet marmalade would be too sweet overall, imho.

I really played around with the recipe.  I  used chicken breasts, and baked it at 350 for about an hour.  I also added red pepper flakes.  Served with peppers and onions, on a bed of rice, and poured the gravy over everything.  Very good.

I really liked the sauce after I reduced it.  We served it over rice and I thought the chicken was good, too.  I'm giving this three stars because my husband asked me to never make it again.  Maybe he's just not a soggy chicken kind of person.

Easy and very good. Use any dried berries, or white raisins. Add slivered almonds, orange slices. Sauce is good over rice.
