Sorry, I can't bring myself to give this more than two stars. Let me see, canned pizza dough, a jar of Ragu and cheese and pepperoni. Simple, yes, tastes OK. (for which it earns the two stars) as long as you like Ragu, but this is not a recipe... its the kind of thing you would find on the side of a jar.  I am disappointed that this got "Kitchen Approved"

Yum, very good recipe! We also made them with ham and pineapple, also very good. We also had ranch for dipping.
