Delicious flavor but a bit dry.  FYI I substituted 1/3 c molasses for syrup and concentrate, and used 1/4 c. gr. flax seed (instead of 1/2) and  3/4 c sliced almonds (instead of 1/2 soy nuts).

The dryness is an easy fix. Just use 1/4C butter and 1/4C applesauce, rather than 1/2C butter. They turn out nice and moist that way.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!  The only change I made was to substitute dried cranberries for the raisins.  I will be making these on a regular basis.

This recipe was a great starting point for making delicious healthy bars.  Instead of butter, I used Sunbutter.  Instead of sugar I used Stevia (2 teaspoons) Instead of corn syrup, I used honey. Instead of ground coconut, gluten and oats, I used homemade muesli.  Instead of wheat flour, I used coconut flour (2 tablespoons).  Instead of soy nuts, I used a mixture of crushed hazelnuts and almonds. Instead of all flax seed, I used half flax seeds and half chia seeds.  Instead of apple juice, I used fresh squeezed orange juice.  The whole family thought they were delicious.

these were good!  They were actually quite moist... perhaps it's because I used a type of butter made from olive oil.  I substituted molasses for the apple juice, and used white cane sugar instead of brown.  I also left out the coconut powder and ground the flax.  I didn't have any gluten, so I omitted that as well.  Almonds replaced the soy nuts... and were wonderful!  These are not too sweet, but could use something... maybe something tangy... Thanks for sharing!!!

Good recipe for kid helpers! We substituted honey for the corn syrup , and added coconut oil. We crushed up almonds and pumpkin seeds... might have been too much... who knows. These bars can also be crumbled for a kid size bowl of granola.
