Bed & Breakfast quality - moist, tender and sweet!  I followed recipe as written. Be sure to allow 30 minutes prep time.  Also, if you do not have the 1 Tbls. pumpkin pie spice, substitute: 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, 3/4 t. ginger, scant 1/2 t. allspice, scant 1/2 t. nutmeg.

Don’t use the streusel topping.  The muffins are already very sweet.  In fact, I may cut ½ cup of the sugar out next time.  But they were great and everybody at work gobbled them up.  I used all whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and I also used a full can of pumpkin puree because I didn’t want to waste any.  I used ½ cup applesauce instead of ½ cup vegetable oil.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, ½ tsp. ginger, and ½ tsp. nutmeg as one review suggested.  The end result was fantastic!

We made ours into a 9 x 13 coffee cake & it was very moist. We used other suggestions given about the use of brown sugar instead of white sugar for topping & used suggested portion of spices for the pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger, all spice, & nutmeg).

I loved these muffins!  I added extra pumpkin and substituted applesauce for the oil, which made them low fat a delicious!  I will be making them again soon.

This is a fabulous recipe!  The only substitution I made was using brown sugar whenever it called for while sugar.  I do this with most of my dessert recipes and I think they taste better.  I also doubled the recipe for the streusel.  My family absolutely loved these muffins.

One of the best muffin recipes I've ever made. I used cinnamon and nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice, and I used half white/half brown sugar. I also added vanilla and nuts. This recipe is already in my recipe folder at home, and I am planning on making them again over thanksgiving for my whole family.

This is a fantastic muffin recipe that holds up well when 1/2 whole wheat flour and some wheat germ are used.  Really nutritious and tasty.
Thanks!

I substituted 1/2 cup of melted butter for the oil and prepared these in 8 baby loaf
pans. I gave them out as gifts and got rave reviews. A great recipe!

Wonderful! I admit I also added the rest of the can of pumpkin puree, it didn't hurt the muffins at all. I made different types of mini muffins for holiday gift trays and they were the favorite! I will be making these lots!

A true winner, and "make-again-able" recipe.  Instead of muffins, I spooned the batter into a 10" greased tube pan, and sprinkled the streusel over.  I baked it at 350 for just under an hour (58 minutes).  What a fabulous coffeecake!  Moist, deep flavor, and with melt in your mouth texture.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My whole family Loves these. I leave off the streusel to reduce some sugar and fat. I made a few other changes just to get a slightly healthier result. Only 1 1/2 c All purp. flour, 1/2 cup quick cooking oats, 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Everything else the same. Sooo good!

I have been making these at least twice a month since I found this recipe back in the Fall.  I've done jumbo, regular and mini muffins and often freeze them for a grab and take snack.  They are wonderful and the kids devour them.  I don't even add the streusel topping.  I do make a few minor changes.... instead of the pumpkin pie spice, I make my own variation - 1 tbsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ginger.  Also, I'll occasionally divide the basic pumpkin recipe in half and add apples to one half and chocolate chips (no apples) to the other half.  Not sure which I like better and they are both delish!!

These are absolutely delicious. So moist that it's hard to eat only one. You can also definitely taste the spices. They give it a great flavor without being overpowering. The only modifications I made were to substitute 1/2 of the oil for applesauce (to make them a bit healthier) and to add 1/2 tablespoon more butter to the streusel (it wasn't crumbly enough). I don't think you can notice the change in oil but next time I make them I'll do it with the full amount and update. They keep well and can be put in the freezer for future use. I like to defrost them in the fridge then toast them, yummy! Also, just so you don't go crazy  peeling/cutting apples then realizing that you have too many, 2 cups is approximately equal to 2 medium/large apples. Also this recipe makes more than it says it does. I got 12 good sized texas size muffins (about the equivalent of 24 muffins). Enjoy. Thanks Jan for the recipe!

Added a bit of vanilla, swapped the sugar for a cup and a half of brown sugar (still a little sweet so i may go down to a cup next time), used some frozen pumpkin puree that i made in the fall and swapped out the oil for applesauce.  My toddler loved them, and i snuck quite a few myself!

These are great! I made these with all whole wheat flour, Splenda for half of the sugar, and apple sauce instead of the oil. I didn't have any pumpkin pie seasoning so I used the spices recommended by Joyful Heart. I also didn't add any streusel topping because the first time I made the recipe as stated and I had a hard time telling when the muffins were done because the streusel seemed to be done sooner than the muffins. I will make the healthier version of these muffins on a regular basis!

Moist, tender - just the right mix of spice and sweetness.  A few notes: 
1) Previous reviewers who pointed out the prep time issue were right; plan on about 1/2 hour to get everything ready.  

2) Substitutions/changes: instead of pumpkin pie spice premixed, added 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp ginger, 1/2tsp ground cloves, sprinkle of fresh grated nutmeg; increased pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups; 1 1/2 cups Splenda for the white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar; Subbed brown sugar in streusel topping.  

3) I know every oven is different, but 35 minutes would have burned these in mine; baked for 24 minutes - came out beautifully, making 18 good sized muffins.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

These muffins are really good, and very moist! I used half whole wheat flour half all-purpose (next time I will use all whole wheat), used apple sauce instead of oil, and half white sugar half brown sugar. I left out the streusel topping and they were still good. Thanks for posting!

These muffins were perfect! Few changes: I used whole wheat flour, 1/2-3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 C white (highly recommend you do this; it still came out perfectly sweet b/c of the topping), grated in a little fresh nutmeg, and I also threw in the whole can of pumpkin puree (I never end up using the leftovers), which I believe made it even more moist. Overall, these were sooo easy to make, yet they came out perfectly moist, not overly sweet, and they made me look like a skilled baker!!! Make these. NOW.

Very good.  Another reviewer said that she baked the batter in a tube pan.  I only had a bundt pan and it turned out very nicely.  I put half of the topping in the bottom of the pan and then used the remainder on the top of the batter.  Another reviewer said to leave the apple in larger chunks.  I agree.

These muffins were great.  I didn't find them too sweet, as other reviewers had, and I followed the recipe exactly.  The only problem I had with this recipe was the oil.  I think 1/2 C is too much, so next time, I will sub applesauce for at least half.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe ! I did make some changes to this recipe. As other users suggested, I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I used apple sauce instead of oil, and I used 1 cup of splenda instead of 2 cups sugar and I sprinkled the tops with white sugar before baking (The apples and apple sauce add some sweetness too). I grated the apples and that looked really pretty once they were baked. Also, I set the timer for 30 minutes, and watched them very carefully. They were ready to come out around 28 minutes at 350. They came out very moist, spicy and pretty !

These were fairly quick to throw together. I added raisins to the batter in addition to the apple chunks and omitted the streusel topping. (The kids don't need the extra sugar). I served them with homemade soup and it was a good Sunday night meal. The recipe made 20 good sized muffins and baked for about 30 mins total.

I substituted 1/2 c. melted butter for oil, sugar in the raw for white sugar and made just 12 really big muffins.  I didn't do the topping.  These were just okay.

I replaced half the flour with whole wheat, and couldn't tell the difference. Swapped out the oil for applesauce, and added a tsp of vanilla. Left off the topping. So good.

These are excellent muffins! I did make some changes - I used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the all-purpose flour, I cut the sugar in half and used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and they came out great! My husband is trying to cut back on sugars and fats and this worked out perfectly. So for his batch I left off the streusel topping. These muffins are very moist and smell so good while baking. Thank you for a great recipe!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! The muffins came out wonderfully moist and delicious, with a lovely balance of sugary sweet, earthy, and slightly tart flavors. These are the BEST muffins I have ever had the pleasure of making, and they get even better after a few days - if they last that long!

Absolutely a terrific treat - best muffins yet.  I used freshly prepared pumpkin (substituted eggbeaters for the eggs), sprinkled top with slivered almonds and then the streusel topping.  Topping is worth the little extra work required.

This has turned into my favorite muffin recipe.  Everyone who tries one wants the recipe!  I substituted 30 oz. Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie Mix for the 1 cup canned pumpkin puree.  This increased pumpkin causes the muffins to rise very little but allows for the moistest, flavor packed muffins ever!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is the best muffin recipe I have found the masks the Gluten Free flour off putting taste.  The pumpkin masks the GF flour and the apple keeps the muffin nice and moist. I did not have pumpkin pie spice on hand so I just did a combination of ground cinnoman, ginger, clove, and nutmeg.  No other modifications made.  AMAZINGLY delicious.  Excellent cold or warmed up the next day!

Fabulous!  I made this in a baking dish and drizzled with some butter creme frosting before serving.  The pumpkin purée added just the right flavor and made the cake so moist...Definite winner in my house!

Fantastic! Just finished baking and, of course, eating these and have decided they are my new 'Go To' breakfast recipe as well as dessert, snack, and anytime! The only change I made was substituting applesauce for oil, but I'll definitely experiment with whole wheat flour and brown sugar next time. The chopped apples are a great little surprise in each bite. After the rave reviews I got from my family, I know I'll be making these at least once a week!

This is a really good base recipe. I made a few changes... I missread the recipe to begin with and only used 1 cup of sugar and I am glad I did! I added 1/2 tsp additional of the following nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, all spice and lemon juice. I subed the oil for applesauce and added a tsp of applesauce to the crumble as well as a tsp of cinnamon. I made a glaze to drizzle on top during the last five minutes of cooking out of 2 tbs half/half, 1 C confectionars sugar, 1 tbs butter, 1 tbs lemon juice and 1 tbs of applesauce. The glaze really makes this recipe POP! Thanks for sharing.

These are fantastic. I made them for my first grader's class party and they were gobbled up in seconds. They are moist, yummy, and pretty healthy too! This recipe will definitely be a winter staple in our house from now on! Thanks!!!  BTW- I used half white sugar and half brown.

Great flavorful muffins.  Only change I made was to grate the apples instead of chopping them.  I got 21 muffins and they were done in 24 minutes.  I think that 35-40 minutes would be way too long to bake these.

I make this muffin every fall, and everyone I know begs for more. I change a few things to make it a little healthier and less calories. I use 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all purpose. I use 2 cups applesauce and 1/8 cup oil. Applesauce is just easier! I also use egg beaters instead of whole eggs. All in all a very tasty treat!!!!

Delicious muffin!  I used 1-1/2 cup of sugar and only 1/3 cup of oil which was just right.  Only took 30 minutes to bake.

These were just delicious!  I actually made mini-muffins, so I had to double the topping.  Me and my sister half of them right out of the pan!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but used a recipie for it from a book using ginger, nutmeg, and a couple other spices and it works great.

Made half batch using fresh pumpkin mash and homemade applesauce for half of the oil.  Absolutely delictable.  I didn't make the topping - just sprinkled a little sugar on top and they were fine.  I *do* wish I had used my muffin tins (jumbo) -  I used cupcake tins and ended up with 18 (not the 9 I expected).  Note to self:  Fill almost to top as they don't rise a great deal.

I made some changes, as recommended by reviewers. I used one cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I usually always cut down on the sugar amount in baking recipes, and usually its fine. I found with this one though I should have used all 2 cups of sugar. I also would have added more spices, as I felt it was lacking some umph. My husband though they were fine, but I have tried a lot better recipes. I think with all the sugar and a bit more spice that these would taste better. Also, I might try shredding the apple, instead of big chunks (they look a little funky to me!)

These were fabulous! To make them more healthy, use half whole wheat flour, cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups using half brown, and substitute applesauce for most of the oil. Also, I found that they baked in under thirty minutes, so keep an eye on them.

I wish I would of read what the other reviewers had to say before baking these muffins.  Please take the advice and cut down on the sugar, they were way too sweet. I am giving it 4 stars because these definately have potential and I will bake them again using whole wheat flour and I will only put half of the sugar needed especially if you decide to replace the oil with apple sauce. By the way my house smelled wonderful and of course my son loved them.

These were wonderful and didn't last long.  The few changes I made include: Used 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar plus 1-1/2 cups Splenda.  Used entire 16 oz can of pumpkin and used shredded apples for moistness and flavor with not gooey clumps. Used half brown & half white sugar in topping & drizzled baked muffins with cream cheese glaze.

These are delicious! Great for those who aren't crazy about pumpkin but want a taste of autumn. My husband hates pumpkin, but he really enjoyed these. I doubled the batch and gave some away in  Halloween baskets. No problem with the recipe at all. Moist but not soggy. If you had that problem you might want to try dicing the apples smaller (apples give juice during baking so big chunks may make the muffins wet, I'd think.) Thanks for the recipe.

I had a cup of pumpkin that I needed to use up so went searching. These were moist and sweet and easy to make. I was glad that I did not do the streusel topping as the muffins are very sweet as is and it saves the extra steps and calories. You don't need the topping unless you have a really really sweet tooth.

AWESOME!!!  I used the whole can (15 oz) of pumpkin and put the batter in 2 loaf pans.  Baked them at 350 for just under an hour.  Moist, scrumptious, and easy to make!!!  You have got to try this!

I tweaked and instead of streusel, I used Hawaiian Sugar Crystals on top.  Sprinkled a few before baking and a few more right out of the oven.  So yummy!

Changes due to allergies:  2/3 C homemade applesauce to replace eggs, EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  These were okay as I made several various pumpkin muffins and I have my favorite.    My DH thought they were the best he tried but he did not try all the various muffins I made.  I think he really liked the topping.  Of course, my children gobbled them up.

I made these into gluten free/egg free muffins and shredded the apples rather than chopping them.  Definitely 5 stars.  This is a fabulous autumn recipe!

These were awesome!  I omitted the apples because I wanted just a pumpkin muffin.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I added the spices separately.  I tossed in the whole can of pumpkin rather than just a cup.

Lovely taste and I normally don't care much for apples. I made these as loaves rather than muffins and I skipped on the streusal topping.

Excellent Autumn Recipe! My husband and I loved these. They were moist, flavorful and unique. I added cinnamon and nutmeg  to spice it up a little more.

I made a healthier version of these muffins by using whole wheat flower, 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup Splenda and substituted the oil with 2/3 cup apple sauce.  They turned out so moist and delicious!  I will definitely make these again.

Delicious!  I went ahead and used the whole can of pumpkin instead of just 1C and used 50/50 whole wheat/all-purpose flour.  And I added 2 TBS milled flax seed to the recipe.  I also subtracted approximately 2TBS of the all purpose flour and added 1TBS wheat germ, 1TBS oat bran, and 1tsp powdered dry milk in it's place to add to the protein and nutrition content (idea from Ruth Yaron's Super Baby Food book).  My husband, who usually does not like pumpkin, really liked these muffins.  I took them to a friend's house this morning, and she asked for the recipe.

CAUTION:  DO NOT BAKE THESE FOR 35 MINUTES UNLESS YOU LIKE BURNT FOOD.  The recipe made 24 muffins which I cooked for 35 minutes like the recipe said.  I had to throw them out because they were all burnt!!!!  Very disappointing!!

I followed the exact recipe and they were great!!  No substitutions, but I did some with the topping and some without... Without are just as good especially if you want to save calories.  Mine only needed 30 minutes in the oven.  The apples were so soft you could barely tell they were in them.  Will make again!

I modified slightly (to help ease a bit of the guilt, who can really eat just one of these?): INSTEAD OF 2 1/2 C ALL PURPOSE FLOUR- 1 1/2 c all purpose flour and 1 c whole wheat pastry flour INSTEAD OF 1/2 C VEGETABLE OIL- 1/4 c unsweetened apple sauce  and 1/4 c vegetable oil These were moist, delicious and spicy. Everything you want from a pumpkin muffin. The next time I make these, I will dice the apples instead of chopping them. That will help make the apple more uniform throughout the muffins. I'll also use a little less than a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, it was a little spicy for my taste. Thank you again, these were delicious.

Delicious muffins. Made as written only using brown sugar in the topping and reducing the baking time. I've made these a second time without the streusel and they are just as good. Great recipe for cool fall days.

These are so easy to put together and really moist and delicious.  I made them once exactly as the recipe stated and then I made them again with part wheat flour & a splash of vanilla.  I think the vanilla added wonderful flavor but the wheat flour, although undetectable by taste, I'm sure it added some nutritional benefit.  One thing that I can't understand, is how can you distribute such a little amount of streusel on all of the muffins? I doubled the streusel recipe and it came out perfect. BUT, my muffin batter filled 23 regular size muffin cups - not 18 like the recipe states.  I definitely think the streusel recipe needs to be doubled.  I also suggest that you don't cut the apple chunks too small because they seem to kind of disappear when cut too small.

I used the recipe as written but baked them in mini-muffin cups for a community meeting.  It was a little tricky figuring out the correct baking time, but between 15-20 minutes depending on your oven seems to do it.  These are very moist and delicious and I will make them again, this time regular size.  I would also like to try the substitutions others have suggested using brown sugar for the white and applesauce for the oil.  If you make the mini-muffins, you really need to chop the apples in very small chunks.  Yum!

So yummy!  Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves...and in a higher quantity than called for, but turned out well.  Used streusel topping on some and made a cream cheese icing with a hint of cinnamon for the others.

My kids LOVE these muffins! I did make a few changes just to be healthier, I used whole wheat flour instead of white and applesauce instead of oil. I also made a double batch and used a whole can of pumpkin puree. Since I was out of pumpkin pie spice, I just used ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. My kids take these to school for snacks and have them for breakfast and my 15 yr old daughter even shared some with a classmate who loved them, too! I just made the second batch tonight, and the kids wanted one for dessert as soon as dinner was over, and my kids RARELY like things that are "healthy" for them. This recipe is a keeper!

These were quick and easy to make.  And did I mention delicious!  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added walnuts to the streusel topping.

If I used a different apple, these would've gotten the fourth star... My Mods: Full can o' pumpkin, lots more pumpkin pie spice, a bit of apple pie spice, Shredded ONE FUJI apple, chopped up another 1.5 apples, Unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil, Cut the white sugar to just under 1.5 cups.  For the topping, I doubled it using BROWN sugar (a touch less), 2 tbs oats, 1 tbs less flour, and more cinnamon.  Baked for 22 minutes.  They were good, but not quite what I was expecting...I think next time, I'll use a more tart apple, than a sweet, as the Fuji flavor got a bit "lost" in the pumpkin.  And, I must've over-mixed because they were just a teeny bit tough.

This recipe is delicious, and I agree with everyone, 2 cups of sugar would be too much. I doubled the recipe so I kept it at 2 cups of white sugar, and mixed in around 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Only when mixing the brown sugar doesn't appear to blend in very well, and you can only mix by hand, and not too much, so it does create a dilemmna. Don't base how much sugar you put in on the taste of the batter. The batter tasted overly sweet but the result was just right. I found the pumpkin taste and the spices weren't very prominent, and I like the spices so next time I'd put in 2 tsps of cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, 3/2 tsp allspice, and some more pumpkin. I also pulled out the muffins/loaf around 20 minutes in and sprinkled with more streusel.

I did the recipe as written, and after tasting the super thick batter, I knew that it was too sweet for my taste so I barely dusted them with the topping. Coming out of the oven, the muffins were a wonderful mix of apple and pumpkin pie flavor so I will most definitely make these again, but I will most definitely be cutting back on the sugar.

My kids loved these!  I did use the entire can of pumpkin and was happy to know that the batter would be really thick ... otherwise I would have thought that I did something wrong.  They were wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are great for breakfast. They also freeze well. I make several large batches at a time. Substituting applesauce for some of the oil (use the same amount) works very well with this recipe and makes it much healthier.

I made these muffins this time last year for a chuch bake sale, and they sold out.  I ended up making several batches and using the big Texas-style muffin tins.  They came out so big and beautiful.  I am making them again this week for another bake sale that is on Saturday (I actually had someone disappointed at a sale a few months ago because I hadn't made them!)

Substituded 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 white flour...apple sauce instead of oil...left apples chunky...while I was in the process of mixing the ingrediants my son asked, "Why do you always make muffins? I want a cake!" So, I pressed the streusel topping into a bunt pan, and it was a picture perfect...my son was happy as a clam, and this bunt cake was delicious!!!

FABULOUS! FABULOUS! FABULOUS! THESE ARE DELICIOUS! 
I TWEAKED THE RECIPE A BIT, AND USED 1 CUP WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, 1/2 WHEAT GERM, ONLY 1 CUP OF SUGAR, CINNAMON APPLESAUCE INSTEAD OF OIL, AND USED 3 CUPS OF CHOPPED APPLE. I TRIED THE STREUSEL TOPPING AND I FOUND IT A BIT SWEET AS DID MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, AND INSTEAD WE JUST SPRINKEL SOME QUICK OATS ON. THIS IS ALSO A GREAT RECIPE FOR THE KIDS TO GET INVOLVED IN THE KITCHEN! MY DAUGHTER HAD A BLAST! BUT BEWARE, PREP TIME TOOK OVER AN HOUR! THIS RECIPE YEILDED 5 DOZEN MINI MUFFINS!

Fabulous muffins!  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so I used 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and they turned out great.  I will definitely make these again!

These muffins are really superb!  They have a cake-like consistency and are perfect for cooler weather. I prefer these the next day as they seemed to get more cake-like after sitting out overnight.---Changes to Recipe---I did use a whole can of the pumpkin puree and brown sugar (instead of white) for the topping.  I also used 1 3/4 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar in the recipe itself.  Finally, I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.

One word...HEAVEN! I used a mini loaf pan and was able to get 4 mini loaves out of this recipe. This is ten times better than the regular pumpkin bread I make.

These muffins are quick, easy and fabulous!  The first time I made them I was in a hurry so I didn't bother sifting the ingredients and they turned out great.  Now, I don't bother sifting.  I have made them three times and they literally disappear.  Thanks for a great recipe.

VERY sweet and down-right mushy. I baked 35 minutes and a knife came out clean but they seemed not done because they were so moist. I made exactly 18,as indicated, and wished I had made 24 smaller because the tops were like chewy, very sweet,"lids" and broke off very easy from the wet muffin part; so a third of them fell apart. I think the recipe needs some changes. I do like the mix of pumpkin and apples and one reviewers suggestion of adding raisins.  Maybe I will play with the ingredients and try again.

The finished product is very good. Nice and moist, and the apples do add a different flavor.  They taste the best when warmed.  I tried mine without the topping though, and I bet they taste just as great without it and the extra calories.

These are very good muffins - great with coffee.  I have made them twice and was asked for the recipe both times.  I used the little mini-muffin pans and baked them for 15 minutes.

Excellent muffins!  These will be made many times again!  However, don't believe the 15 minute prep time.  They aren't hard to make, but take a good half-hour to pull everything together at a minimum...

This is a wonderful muffin recipe. It has great flavor and the spices are just right. I didn't have any apples so I added 1 3/4 cup applesauce instead. I wasn't sure if the batter would be too runny but it turned out perfectly. I think I'm going to try it the coffeecake way next time.

I used apple butter and increased the Oatmeal to a cup and decreased the flour and the sugar.  I also used Coconut oil in the muffins and butter in the topping.   They came out great

YUM! I used unpacked brown sugar in place of the white sugar, added 1tsp baking powder, used apple sauce in place of oil, used 3 cups apple chunks, and skipped the streusel (I hate making streusel). Made 12 large muffins. Baked at 350 for 30 mins but next time I'd take them out at 25 mins.

This was recommended by allrecipes. In fact, it was a staff pick. I'm a little confused. The muffins had no flavour. I thought it would be a little sweeter. I don't know how to describe it. They were sweet, but all you could taste was sugar. The apple seems to be an useless addition because you can't taste it. It just tastes like the inside of a pumpkin. I ended up having to make a cream cheese icing to put on top just to give it a little oomph.  I followed the recipe exactly. I made half with the streusel and half without because some reviewers said the muffins were so sweet.  Just a bit disappointed because I get fabulous pumpkin muffins at the bakery and I thought I could duplicate them at home. Bummer.

YUM! Made this exactly as stated, only ran out of streusel topping (I was being generous) after topping about 12 of these and made 1/2 a recipe more to finish off the muffins. I would recommend doing this as the crunchy streusel topping really made this muffin! I would make more streusel (1 1/2 recipe) again - and there will be a next time because these were wonderful. :-) Oh, and they go perfect with thick bacon. And coffee.

There were unbelievable! They were actually so good that I blogged about them, and having never blogged, this meant creating a blog, just for these muffins! I made a few changes, outline in my post, which are why I didn't give this one 5 stars - I wanted to make them a bit healthier.

These were good, but way too sweet.  I think you could cut the sugar to 1 - 1 1/2 cups and still be plenty sweet, especially with the streusal topping.  Will make again, but with less sugar.

This recipe is perfect as is. I've made this as muffins and mini loaves. It's a moist sweet delicious bread! I used whole wheat flour and just threw in a whole can of pumpkin like many other users suggested. Yum!

Excellent recipe! I made double! I did make a few adjustments on the second round though. I made a 9 x 13 coffee cake. I cut the sugar in the cake in half and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also quadrupled the streusel since I love a sweet crunchy topping on my coffee cake. Delicious, and even better the next day! I highly recommend making it the day before to allow the cake (or muffins) to moisten even more. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm fairly certain I owe my PhD to this recipe. I've made them 3 times: once for my Mom, a second time for my committee when I proposed my study, and a third time yesterday when I (successfully) defended my dissertation. Always wonderful, and I always get requests for the recipe. I make only 1 change: whole wheat flour instead of white flour gives it a REALLY nice texture. Nutty almost, which pairs very well with the earthy pumpkin. For those of you worried about the thick batter &/or the quantity of apple: they balance each other out. The batter is thick compared to your typical muffin, BUT the apple adds a great deal of moisture. It's no wonder that the very few people who had trouble with the recipe messed with one or both of these factors.  Don't mess with it. DO use a good cooking apple. I found Honeycrisp worked well.  You can trust me on this.. I'm a doctor! ;)

These were fantastic EXCEPT... mine only took about 17 MINUTES to cook, not 35-40 minutes!  So my first batch was ruined. This setback did help me realize halfway through that these muffins needed a touch more salt than called for and a little extra pumpkin pie spice.  The salt gave it some dimension it had been missing.  Doubling the topping is always delicious to me!  I'll make them again for sure with these adjustments :)

These were really delicious! I didn't change anything in the recipes and they were moist and tasty.  I used Ambrosia apples, worked wonderfully.  I ended up with 23 muffins though.  I was worried I would overfill them if I made only 18.  Yum!!!!!!!!

Tasty. Subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used half as much sugar and omitted the streusel topping. I probably used a less spice because I didn't have my mix handy and had to grate my spices (note to self: make your mix!). Mine stuck to the paper liners, probably because of my fat sub. Next time will make it without subs and use the topping.

I brought these to work (at a physical therapy clinic where everyone tries to eat healthy) and they were all gone before noon!  Being a critical baker I think if I made these again I'd add more spice-I love spices!- and only bake for 30 minutes.  I did my first tray for 35 and thought they were a tad overdone.

These are great muffins for fall. They taste best when warm. I suggest being generous on the streusel topping (the recipe makes quite a bit). The muffins look more attractive (magazine-like) when they have planty of topping. Otherwise, they get a melted-sugar-look. I mixed by hand to make sure that I didn't mash the apples.

Wow delicious!  I used a stick of melted margarine (hate the taste of veg oil in baked goods), 1 c white and 1c brown sugar, and 1 1/2 c whole wheat and 1 c all-purpose flour.  I diced up 1 Granny Smith and 1 Gala apple into pretty small pieces.  Baked them without the streusel topping for 30 minutes.  I got 17 delicious muffins out of this!  They have just a little bit of crunch around the edges, the yummy pumpkin and spice flavor, and the little surprise sweet bites of apple.  This is going in my recipe binder for sure!  A word of advice: the batter takes some mixing to get everything moist.  I almost added extra wet ingredients because it wasn't coming together right.  I'm glad I didn't- these came out perfect as written!

These were amazing! The only thing that I did different was too add some walnuts and they came out amazing! I made half in regular sized tins and the other half in mini muffin tins. Next time I will chop my apples up a bit smaller, especially if I make the mini muffins again. As soon as they were gone my boyfriend asked me when I would be making them again and asked that it be very soon! Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  I actually subbed squash for the pumpkin (to use it up) but kept everything else the same.  Loved the apple chunks, and while it was a bit oversweet, loved the streusel topping.  May decrease the sugar next time and keep the topping.

I made this recipe with a few minor substitutions based on preference. I used 1C whole wheat flour (1 1/2 C white),cut sugar in half, and added 1t orange extract to liven up the pumpkin flavor. Since I had just made banana nut muffins with a streusel topping, I opted out and sprinkled with coarse sugar instead. The muffins came out moist, just fluffy/dense enough, and full of bright flavor. The apple is a great idea and I think pear would be just as lovely.

yummy!  I added a 1/2 cup more  of the pumpkin instead of adding the vegetable oil.  I also put it in a bread pan instead of making muffins.

This recipe is really good!  I deducted a star because I think it could use a little more of a pumpkin flavor, but maybe that wouldn't work with the apples, I'm not sure.  They were still excellent.  If you don't like strong pumpkin flavor, it would get a 5.  I used granny smith apples and they turned out amazing.  I will definitely be making this again later this fall.

These are delicious muffins and taste just like Fall.  After reading many of the reviews, I made a few alterations to make them a bit healthier.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, used applesauce instead of oil and think they are probably better for it.  I used only 2/3rds of the sugar and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  I did not make the streusel topping and am glad I didn't.  The muffins are plenty sweet without it.  
Awsome recipe!

These had a great flavour, great texture, but I found that they were a little greasy on the bottom. That's the only reason they didn't get 5 stars.

These muffins are spectacular!  This is our new Thanksgiving day tradition.  I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, which contributed great texture.  I like to make jumbo muffins, rather than the smaller variety.  This amount of batter works well in a 6-muffin jumbo tin.  The cups fill nearly to the top....and the muffins rise perfectly in 35 minutes this recipe calls for.  They look and taste like something purchased from a bakery. Deeeelicious!

Like many other reviewers, I used applesauce instead of oil and cut the sugar in half (1/2 c brown, 1/2 c white).  I also used fresh pumpkin, dumped in about 1/2 C pecans and just like when I make pumpkin pie, I don't settle for the minimum of spices.  My muffins have nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, cardamom and coriander (between 1/8 tsp and a shake, generally).  I used a gala and a granny smith apple, too.  Delicious, but a lot of changes to make it so.

This is the first time I've reviewed anything in this site but I had to write and say that these muffins are AMAZING!  After reading suggestions of other reviewers I did use the whole can of pumpkin plus added some applesauce (maybe 1/2 cup) and 2 grated apples, but everything else I kept the same.  I will be sharing this recipe and making them again and again.

The smell alone from these is unreal. I think it's the combination of the apples and pumpkin, it's like Thanksgiving pies rolled into a muffin. Extra, extra good with brown sugar substituted for the white sugar. I used 1 1/2 c. spelt flour in place of white. If you've never used spelt, you can find it at your local health food co-op and it's perfect for baking--so subtle in flavor. I didn't even do the streusel topping, it would've been too sweet for me. Instead, the tops of these got ever so slightly chewy, like a nice brownie edge. The insides are super-moist and flavorful.  Mmmm....I'll make these again and again in the fall season.

Delicious! I baked it in a 9x13 lightly greased glass pan as opposed to muffins, and it turned out excellent.  Baked for 34 min, but should have added 2 or 3 more minutes for center doneness.  Would have doubled streusel topping for this style also.  Used brown sugar in the streusel, a tad less oil and a bit more pumpkin than called for were my only changes.  So moist!  My family didn't even want to share at all!  Will definitely be keeping this yummy recipe!

These are great! I've used several different apples, all taste great. Applesauce and brown sugar make them amazing. I tend to add more pumpkin spice and cinnamon and such. Tis a great breakfast with scrambled eggs and ham. Yummy!! ^_^

I thought that these were great!  They could use about one more tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and they will be perfect.  I made two changes and that was to use 1/4 cup of dark rown sugar in place of white sugar and add a tablespoon of white sugar to the topping.  Also instead of cold butter I used melted butter. This is def a keeper.

Good- I made a healthier version and used 1/2 cup applesauce and less than 1/4 cup of canola oil. Used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of oat bran. Also only used 1/2 cup of baking splenda. Would make again!

I can't say enough good things about these muffins.  I add pecans to the topping, and they come out toasted and delicious.  These taste like something you would buy in an upscale bakery.

I had leftover pumpkin and apples, so I made these even though it's not fall.  They are yummy.  Great flavor and texture.  The only problem I had was that they sunk in the middle.  I'm not sure why, but I think there was too much batter in each cup.  Next time I will make 24 instead of 18 muffins.

I made this in a 9X13 pan as a coffee cake and baked it for 45 minutes and it came out great! I used half oil and half applesauce and had to use a little more butter for the streusel topping in order get all of the ingredients mixed in and it came out amazing! I brought it to work for my breakfast day and everyone loved it! Next time I'll try using all applesauce and no oil, egg whites, and whole wheat flour and/or oatmeal (I didn't want to make too many changes the first time I made the recipe!) to make it a little healthier. I might also try foregoing the streusel topping and just sprinkling cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar on top instead. All in all a great recipe!

I made this into a loaf instead of muffins, and except for the struesel topping being a bit hard to cut through, it turned out very well. A nice change from my usual banana and pumpkin breads.

If you like pumpkin and apples, this is the recipe for you.  I made a couple of changes - I only used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I used the whole can of pumpkin puree and about 3 cups of apple, partially shredded and partially chopped.  I also used brown sugar in the streusel.  Instead of muffins, I made this into a bundt cake with the streusel in the middle and baked for about an hour at 350 degrees.  I then drizzled a glaze of 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 2 tbsp. milk over the baked cake.  This was a very autumnal recipe and it was quite popular at my afternoon tea.

I did some trial and error with this delicious recipe and found this was the best way: 1.5 cups white sugar and .5 cup packed brown sugar instead of the 2 cups white sugar; .25 cup vegetable oil and .25 cup applesauce instead of .5 cup oil (perfect since apples are already included); add 1 tsp vanilla. For the streusel topping I used 1 tbsp flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp butter - prepared the same as in recipe. 
My friends at work have already asked me to make them again. A new fall favorite.

Very good! I made these using fresh pumpkin from my garden and it turned out yummy. The streusel didn't work for me as it was a little warm and it got all melty before I put it on the muffins.

I didn't get to try these as my coworkers ate them all, but everyone said only good things about these muffins. I left the skin on the apple because I'm lazy and everyone can use more fiber, and the texture was fine.

These turned out wonderfully! I made a few changes... I only used 1 cup sugar and used shredded apple and a mashed banana in place of the oil. I also used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour. I made 12 big muffins.

I think this is one of the few recipes that i have ever given 5 stars. It was awesome. This is the first time i have made muffins too. For some reason i was thinking that pumpkin muffins sounded good so i went searching for recipes for it. This one was a little more exotic and i'm glad i made it. I was thinking "what would make these muffins even better". I didn't try this but maybe if you made some cream cheese frosting on the top after they come out of the oven would be very good i bet.

These were really good - my kids LOVED them, and I made them without the streusel topping even.  I upped the healthfulness a bit - used spelt flour instead of white, half brown sugar instead of all white, and I replaced the oil with the same amount of applesauce.  They were super-moist, and even without the topping very yummy.  We're trying to eat a lot more pumpkin in my house, and with this recipe I'm happy with the nutrition and the kids think they are getting a fabulous treat.  What a deal!

These muffins were overall excellent.
I used a cooking apple, McIntosh, so the finished product was not overly sweet.  The warm muffin was a little difficult to remove from a paper cupcake insert, but was easy with just a non-stick cupcake pan lightly greased.  My family and friends raved about the texture and flavor.

I had taken the advice of other reviewers and left off the streusel topping and this still rated 5 stars.  However, next time I will try the streusel as it wasn't as sweet as I had been led to fear.  This recipe is wonderful-the apple just gives it a little more moistness and a little more taste than just plain pumpkin muffins.  Thank you for a kid pleaser recipe that not only tastes good but makes the house smell wonderful while it's baking!

These muffins are delicious!! I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and they were still very sweet. May cut back a bit more next batch. In any case, these were gone in a flash.

Excellent flavor and moistness.  The amount of pumpkin pie spice is just perfect; not overpowering but just right.  I did add 1/4 tsp. cardamom, 1 tsp. vanilla, and couple handfuls of raisins to the batter.  Thanks for the headsup, Schellybean on mentioning that the batter is extremely thick.  I had to go back and make sure I didn't omit something from the recipe, then read the reviews and saw you mention this.  I used Gala apple; fine chopped 1 cup, and shredded the other cup.  This made 11 Texas size muffins.  I omitted the streusel as well.

This recipe was AMAZING!  Some others mentioned that they altered the recipe, but trust me...you don't need to!  I doubled this recipe with no trouble, and they came out moist and delicious!  The batter was a bit thick...but please don't add any liquid...it turns out great the way it is.  I will make these over and over again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...my husband thanks you too!

First off let me say there is way too much butter in the streulsal topping. Here is the one I use for everything: 
Oatmeal Streusel: 3/4 c all-purpose flour, 1/2 t ground cinnamon, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 3/4 c rolled oats, 1 t lemon zest, Start with 2 T and go up to 1/4 cup butter if needed (i usually end up using about 1/4 c). 
In a medium bowl combine flour, cinnamon, brown sugar, oats, and zest. Mix thoroughly and cut in butter or margarine until mixture is crumbly and on the dry side. 
You can leave out the lemon zest and switch out the cinnamon to a different spice if you want. Also if you have left over you can freeze it. 
I also added 1/4 t ground cloves to the recipe. They came out with a good taste.

I have found a new favorite muffin recipie!  Really good flavour and texture.  I must add though that I halved the amount of sugar... 2 CUPS, plus the additional 1/4 in the streusal topping, is way too much!!

These were very moist muffins with great flavor.  I also added the entire can of pumpkin instead of just the one cup.  I didn't fill the cups the whole way to the top, as I thought they might rise too much, so the recipe made more muffins for me.  Next time I'll fill the cups to the top, as they don't rise that much.

I made the following changes:  added a WHOLE large can of pumpkin (3.5 cups) instead of the one cup it called for (This was a bit of an accident but it turned out great and I love us getting the extra veggie serving), subbed one cup of whole wheat flour for one cup of the white flour, split the sugar 50/50 with white and brown sugar, and reduced the sugar about 1/4 cup. To half of the batter I added some walnuts for crunch.  I made the streusel but honestly found it just too much work.  Next time I will just sprinkle the top with some granulated sugar before baking - much quicker and the same effect, I'm certain. This is a delicious, low-fat recipe I will definitely make again!

tastes great! i used red apples but i think next time i will use green apples for the tartness. Also I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups which i'm glad i did because the struesel topping is very sweet itself. but overall this recipe turned out wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly. I was surprised at how thick the batter was but they turned out great and they were absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

MMM!!! was the sound as family and friends bit into these delicious muffins.  I've been requested to make these again soon.  
As an alternative to the streusel topping, I mixed pecan pieces with cinnamon.  It was a nice different nutty topping.  Thanks Jan for sharing.

This has become a new family Fall favorite.  I put the mix in a bundt pan and added some chopped walnuts to the streusel topping.  My family loved it and my Mom (who is a great cook) even asked for the recipe - she wants to add it to her Thanksgiving spread.  Awesome!

This recipe is wonderful.  I just made these for my 2 year old's playgroup and their mommies.  Both moms and kids loved them.  This is a great way to sneak in some fruits and veggies to the little ones.  I didn't scale the recipe, but it ended up making 21 big muffins instead of 18.  I will absolutely make these again.  Yum!

Very easy recipe that produced delicious, moist muffins.  Cut down the sugar a bit and didn't bother with the topping, just some chopped nuts on top.  Used the whole can of pumpkin.  I'll definitely make these again.

Great for 10 o'clock breakfast at work.  I froze them in small snack bags and grab one out of the freezer in the morning.  All thawed out and ready to eat at 10.  Just the right amount of sweetness and goes great with coffee.  The apple and pumpkin combo seem to work really well.  Will be making these for breakfast for quite some time.

Yummy muffins...added some oats to the streusel topping to give a little crunch texture. Only thing I can’t figure out is the baking time. That is WAY too long to produce a moist muffin. I checked mine at 15 minutes & they were perfect. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars

I married the pickiest man in India. He loved these muffins,  though he hates pumpkin! I grated the apples coarsely, used 1/2 a cup less sugar, and improvised with mostly whole wheat flour. I added a little buttermilk to the muffins,  and a little cardamom to the struesel topping with the cinnamon. Yummers!

I loved these! I'm so thankful to other reviewers who give great advice on recipes.  Here are the adjustments I made:  I used half & half all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I made the muffins extra big, so my yield was only 11, but I always think bigger is better! 

I'm never sure which apples to use when baking, so I chose honeycrisp. They were perfect.

I did not do the streusel topping  but instead made a drizzle for the top. The drizzle consisted of 1 cup of icing sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tbsp. of melted butter, and 1-2 tbsp. of milk (add slowly until you get the desired consistency).

Mmmmmmmarvelous!!

I have made this recipe now 3 times and just had to write a review because they were so good!  The first time followed the recipe exactly as is, and then the next 2 times I modified it a little bit.  I like using brown sugar where it calls for white sugar, and I also tried several different types of apples.  I used golden delicious, honey crisp and gala and they were all good.  You can also use this same recipe and make mini loaves of bread or a regular loaf of bread, just cook it a little longer.  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe. I used 1/2 whole wheat and white flour and 1/2 brown and white sugar. I think I'd prefer all white flour but wanted to try a healthier version. They are moist and flavourful and I like the addition of the apple. I didn't do the topping and I didn't think it was necessary. I got 18 muffins plus had leftover batter so I put it in a loaf pan and got a small loaf :)

Simple adjustments make it healthier: I used 1 cup shredded apple and 1 cup shredded zucchini. I also halved the amount of sugar, and added raisins, ground flax and pecans.

I have made these many times, since I discovered it last fall. First time I made it using the exact recipe. Then I tried different ways substituting  brown sugar for sugar, carrot, sweet potato, even acorn squash purée for pumpkin and adding  raisins , cranberries, no matter what I did, I couldn't go wrong. I also liked with whole grain white wheat flour.

The batter was so dry that I had to add a cup of applesauce. Not much pumpkin flavour. Only used about 1/3 of the struesel topping and that was lots. Would not make this receipe again.

Made a few deviations. I only made one change to the batter by adding fresh grated Nutmeg. After filling the cups I put a small dollop of Apple Jelly in the center and then covered it with the topping. I also used brown sugar instead of white in the topping. I then topped it all off with some slivered candied almonds. Awesome.

Very good.  We substituted whole wheat flour and applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and this was still very tasty.  Rating 5 stars as the regular version has to be even better.  This will be going into our recipe book to make again.

I had pumpkin leftover from another recipe that I didn't want to waste. Also still had apples from the fall crop. Win-Win! Made these muffins without changing a thing. (Drives me nuts when others rate a recipe with a zillion alterations!) My kitchen smelled heavenly while these were baking. Yum!

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because the original recipe called for far too much sugar.  I cut the sugar in half because it seemed ridiculous that the sugar was about half of the dry ingredients!  The final result was yummy!  You don't need to use that much sugar!

Yum! I did use brown sugar for the topping. Will probably use applesauce instead of oil next time. Think this would be good with or without the apples/topping. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and accidentally put the whole can of pumpkin puree.. I was planning on adding more flour at the end but forgot.  They still turned out amazing, super moist.  I will use the whole can (500ml) when I make them again.

These are amazing, I follwed the recipe as is. I did substitute turbinado sugar on top instead of the streusel for some, and that was good too. It's easier than the streusel if you don't feel like mixing that together.

So yummie!  I used a bit less sugar (about 1.5 cups), and added dried cranberries with the apples.  So moist, and delicious.  Will make again.

These were great muffins, although I made some changes to make them healthier. I cut the sugar by half and they were plenty sweet! Used half whole-wheat flour and added some wheat germ to lighten them.
I also skipped the strussel because I knew we wouldn't eat most of them the same day. They were really yummy and relatively healthy after the changes.

This is one of my favorite muffin recipes...and I make a lot of muffins!  I reduced sugar to 1-1/2 cups (3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar) and omitted the topping.  Next time I will reduce the sugar even more.  I also reduced the amount of oil by using 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, and then topped it off with oil to make 1/2 cup.  For the flour, I used all whole wheat flour that has been run through the food processor for about 30-40 seconds to make it finer.  I have also made it 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 whole wheat.  I can't tell the difference, as long as the whole wheat flour is ground finer!  Only had 1-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice so I used the recommended spice substitution.  DELICIOUS!!!

I have made these muffins twice within the last week, and everyone who has tried them has been as pleased as I am!  I appreciate how quick and easy they are to make, as well as how delicious they taste.  Changes I made:  1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil; 1 c brown sugar + 1/2 c white sugar instead of 2 c white sugar; no salt; no streusel topping.  I used four medium Honeycrisp apples and ended up with 24 muffins.  I plan on making these muffins over and over again.  Thank you SO much, JES55!

This is a great base recipe.  I had a lot of apples that needed to be used, and was looking for a healthy muffin recipe.  I doubled the recipe, and it made 18 large muffins, cooked at 325 for 50 min, as the size was significantly larger than the standard muffin tin.  

All I had on hand was a large can of pumpkin pie filling, as opposed to regular pumpkin puree, so I cut back on the sugar and pumpkin pie spice by about 25%.  I also used NO oil, just an extra cup of the pumpkin pie filling (extra pumpkin puree would work fine too).  This makes them slightly more dense instead of light and airy but still delicious and so much healthier.  I did make the crumb topping as a treat, but they would have been tasty without it too.

I just made this recipe & it's delicious!   I did make some modifications like,  cutting down the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Using 1/2 white, 1/2 brown.. omitting the oil completely & using cinnamon applesauce.  I also used less sugar in the streusal & added quick oats & using the whole can of 15oz.  Pumpkin..

Wonderful recipe! We had some surprise guests show up last night and I needed something for breakfast so I thought I'd give it a try. Tasty, fast, and delicious. The only tweak I made was to substitute in brown sugar in the streusel.

very yummy, I made a double batch and got 4 dozen muffins. only problem I had was running out of the streusel about halfway through, but that usually happens with me and streusel :) the only thing I changed was that I added some quick oats to the streusel (about 1/2 cup, more or less). this was an attempt to make it go further, but it also made a yummy little crunch! oh, and I added a few dashes of cinnamon into the batter, too :) om nom nom....

Replaced oil with applesauce. Replaced half the white flour with whole wheat flour. Also, skipped the streusel topping so they'd be lower in sugar. Everyone loves them!

Good but not spectacular...I used a full can of pumpkin and applesauce in place of the oil.  I'll try something different the next time I am looking to make pumpkin muffins.

I completely agree with the comment about the streusel not being necessary, even a bit too much.  I also prefer to replace half of the oil with an equal amount of apple sauce so as to make it a bit healthier.  I've made these a few times now, and people keep begging me to make more...especially when autumn rolls around.

This recipe was very easy and VERY good, so I can't give it less than 5 stars. I'm really glad I tried it, but I'm not sure if I'll make this exact recipe again. For me it was too dense for muffins and would have been better as a bread or cake. I did love the Pumkin and Apple together though!

Yummy! Moist, great texture and flavor. I used pumpkin pie mix and added cinnamon, but it needs even more spice than that. Next time I'll add a lot more.

Wow! This was a really good muffin. I really like being able to see the chopped apples inside the muffin. Made as is with the exception of adding an extra 1/4 cup of sugar for the streusel topping. I'm really big on streusel topping and am so glad I added it.

These where really good but a little sweet. Next time I will use 1 cup brown sugar. I also sub the oil for apple sauce and mashed bananas for pumpkin. The batter was super thick and wasn't sure if it was my fault so I added 2 tbsp of milk just to calm my mind. The muffins came out super dense and gooey on the top; I cooked the for 35 mins do I know they were done. I'm not the best baker, do not sure if I made a mistake. I like the flavored so I will play with the recipe to better suit me.

Pretty good. I did make some changes: instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 cup white; however I think it could be just a touch sweeter so next time I'll use 1 cup brown and 3/4 white. I added some extra ground cinnamon (about 1/2 tsp) after putting in the pumpkin spice. I only used one huge apple and chopped it up very finely. Used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce. I omitted the streusel topping altogether and just sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top before baking. These were VERY moist, great for grab-and-go breakfasts.

I made a lot of changes and didn't add the streusel topping- they are fantastic!

I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour, half of the oil with applesauce, and half of the sugar with Splenda for baking. Splenda doesn't brown as much as sugar in baking, but the whole wheat flower kept up a golden brown appearance. I got 18 tasty, aromatic, lower fat and lower sugar muffins :)

Very good. I made these with a little apple sauce in the batter because my eggs were small, and it was a little stiff. They turned out delicious, and I will be making these again and again. Thank you for sharing!

Oh my, how fantastic. Followed the recipe exactly. Perfect. I might look into adding more apple and pumpkin next time. They went so quickly! I did NOT use muffing liners, just a good amount of PAM and they came out great!

These muffins turned out perfect and that should count as alot since I never have my baked itmes turne out right. Just the right blend between pumpkin and apple. I used Pumpkin pie puree and skiped the pumpkin pie spice, because that is what I had on hand. I am going to make them again very soon.

Pumpkin spice as suggesteed by others, will substitute whole wheat and applesauce for oil next time. Sprinkled with pumpkin seeds instead of streusel for a healthier breakfast option.

Love this recipe!  I adapted it slightly, I used 1 cup white flour, 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, I replaced the vegetable oil with apple sauce, I also added more pumpkin spice mix.  They turned out really well. One batch made 24 regular size muffins

These are delicious.  I'm on a low iodine diet so I substituted 4 egg whites for the eggs and they still came out amazing.  Also since I can't have butter I used 4 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil for the streusel topping.

These muffins are great! Very moist and flavorful. The only change I made was substituting 1/2 cup of applesauce for the vegetable oil to cut back a little on the fat and calories. I will make these again.

These turned out well but I took many liberties with the original recipe in order to use what I had on hand and to make them lower in fat and calories. Substituted 1 1/4 c. mashed buttercup squash for the pumpkin (leftover from dinner), cut the sugar down to 1 cup, reduced oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Without pumpkin pie spice on hand, I used 1 t. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. clove, 1/4 t. allspice. The crunchy and sweet streusel on top worked really well on these muffins, which came out moist, tender and dense, and not too sweet.

I loved this recipe!! we only had one cup of apple so we used chunky homemade applesauce for the other cup, only used 1/3 c. oil and added 1/3 c. chopped walnuts!! These make an excellent fall snack!

This is a great recipe. As I was going through the steps, I got nervous when I saw there was no mention of baking powder! It did not need it!! These are wonderful!  Fluffy and not dense at all! Try it!!

Very good.  I made it as two cakes in round 8" X 4" baking dishes, and passed it off as birthday cake.  Reduced sugar by 1/2 C, and used half brown sugar and half Wheat flour.  Added ginger. Was a big hit with my kids who didn't catch on that it is not really cake!  I baked it 350 about 1 hr

OMG!!!  I just made this tonight and it is the best quick bread I have ever had in my life!  

I left off the streusel because of comments that it made it too sweet.  I agree, it would be too sweet for me with it on and I like my sweets sweet.

Followed the recipe to the letter using Honeycrisp apples.  They were a bit cooked down, but blended in nicely with the texture and super moist bread.

Made in my Pain de Mie (Pullman) pan without the lid for about 1 1/2 hours at 350, but my oven tends to run cool.  Made a georgeous, tall loaf that will be perfect toasted tomorrow morning for breakfast!

Thanks so much JES55, this recipe rocks!!!

Very delicious!  I substituted whole grain flour and whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour...using half and half.  I cut down on some of the sugar, used about 1/4 oil, and 1/2 C applesauce to make up for some of the extra moisture needed for the whole grain flours.  I also used buttercup squash instead of the pumpkin as I wanted to use what I already had in the freezer.  I did use the streusel and was glad I did!  Now the kids have a grab and go breakfast, and I can feel good that they have a healthy one at that!!

Tried these today and was surprised with the result , didn't use the apples as I didn't have any and used cinnamon , mixed spice , ground ginger and ground cloves instead of pumpkin pie spice. Didn't make the streusel either as I didn't want that much sweetness. The result was great ! Will keep this recipe in my file for sure !

I made this as written. The muffins were good, but took nearly an hour to be done (and my muffins weren't huge). My husband had no idea they were pumpkin muffins. They tasted more like gingerbread to us. I'm guessing this might be b/c of my pumpkin pie spice. So they were good gingerbread apple muffins.

I'd give these more stars if I could.  They were delicious, sweet, moist & just wonderful!  My only very minor complaint is that you can't taste the pumpkin very much but they are still great.  I used fresh pumpkin & omitted the salt (simply because I forgot it) & used very finely chopped Granny Smith apple.  I got 24 regular size muffins.  I added a little bit of rolled oats to the topping, which I'll definitely do next time because it was delicious.  Next time I'll double the topping because there wasn't quite enough for my 24 muffins.  These keep well for a few days covered in plastic wrap in the fridge.  I'll be making these year after year!  Thank you.

Very good. I used 1 cup of real pumpkin, not canned, brown sugar instead of white, whole wheat flour, and skipped the topping all together. A little hard to combine the wet and dry, but delicious and not too sweet for breakfast or a snack. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin, but I don't care, they are so good anyway!

Yummy! That is my one-word review of these muffins. I followed the recipe exactly and they are delicious! I have made them several times and always get compliments. I have used pink lady and honeycrisp - I think you could use any apple and have these muffins turn out great!

Perfect with some minor changes. I used brown sugar rather than white, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. That was plenty for my taste, particularly with the sweetness of the apples. If you use a tart apple you might want to adjust the sugar accordingly. I also used 75% multigrain flour, which created a lovely texture. A delicious fall treat!

These totally satisfied my pumpkin craving. I used whole wheat flour, added some oat bran and halved the sugar and oil. The batter was thick (probably the oat bran) so I added some apple cider. Also skipped the streusel topping. Yum.

Would taste better if it had more texture.  Going to add some nuts next time.  Overall good . . . a little more modification to be great.

Although very moist,I am quite dissapointed with the bland,blah flavor of these muffins,despite the full TB of pumpkin pie spice...which I thought would be ok with 2+c of flour.The pie spice was not outdated,which can happen incidentally.But remember,pumpkin itself IS very bland! I too,cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and doubled the streusel topping.If you're looking for true spiced pumpkin-apple muffins,for an autum treat or breakfast,then this is not the one.I'm an excellent baker and cook too...Maybe I'll find something I like better,and post it!

This recipe was very tasty. I followed some of the recommendations and substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 brown sugar where it called for flour and sugar.  I also used almond oil instead of vegetable oil.  I forgot to peel the apples, but I think they turned out just as well.  I will double the streusel recipe next time as it didn't cover all of the muffins, but the ones with no topping were still tasty too just not AS tasty.  :-)

Good....should have cut my apple chunks a bit smaller.  Cooking time seemed way too high to me...I only baked about 25 minutes and they were perfect.

These are a good fall muffin.  I used the whole small can of pumkin which was about a 1 1/2, could not use that much sugar so cut it to 1 cup, added more spices (my preference) and had to make more streusel.  I baked in my jumbo muffin tins and made 12 muffins.  I too was worried about how thick the batter was but they do turn out great.

These were some of the best apple muffins I have ever tasted. I added a bit more spice, but other than that, that was the only change. Excellent flavor and moistness!! I will continue to make over and over again.

Streusal was 1/c whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1tbsp margarine.

Very good! I think I will take the advice of another reviewer and try wheat flour but I will definitely up the pumpkin and pie spice to make sure it doesn't make it bland. I also might use a pinch of cayenne with the pie spice to really bring out the flavor!

These were great! I did sub unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  I also lessened the sugar to a cup 1/2 and put in cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any... Biggest difference is I only baked them for 25 mins. and they were done!

This muffin recipe was successful, even though I didn't do the streusel topping. The muffins are very sweet, next time I will cut down on the sugar by maybe 1/2-3/4 cup. Good taste, but not outstanding. Could be more pumpkin-y.

Oh so delicious!   The store was out of canned pumpkin puree so I halved a sugar pumpkin and baked it in foil for an hour, then scooped and pureed the insides to make my own.  I'm sure they turned out better than if I'd bought it in a can anyway!  I also substituted brown sugar for the white. Added bonus of the smell of fall pumpkin and apple spices filling your home while the muffins bake!

These were the best.  I tried them without putting the streusel on and I put them in a muffin pan without paper cups. I also added all the pumpkin. I would definitely make these again.

Great use of leftover pumpkin!  I didn't make the topping, but they were still great.  My 3 year olds loved them too, thanks.

Quite good and really moist! the first time i made them, i completely forgot to add the apples, but they were a really good pumpkin muffin, second time with apples...fab! i did not put the struesel topping on, since there was already so much sugar in them.

Super easy, a snap to make and clean up after, and GORGEOUS tasting! These deserve six stars. Also, a big thank you to the other reviewer who gave those of us without pumpkin pie spice the measures for the alternative mix. Great. All around this is a 'wow' recipe.

I highly recommend this recipe as well as using the streusel. I accidently used an entire can of pumpkin like someone else did, but the recipe didn't turn out any differently or take any longer to bake. They came out perfectly moist. The only minor thing I tweaked, was that I added a lot of cinnamon and some cloves, allspice because I love that fall spice taste and usually the pumpkin pie spice isn't enough for me. I used my silicone cupcake pan so I didn't need any liners. They are great because I can just pop them out and they are ready to go.

I tried this recipe because my Banana Streusel Muffins were a bust. I cut the sugar back by a cup, used a full stick of butter and added a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Other than that, I made no changes. I'll update my review once we've tried them in the morning.

Really good! I agree with others that the streusel might not be needed since they're pretty sweet to begin with. I would sub applesauce for the oil next time, possibly cut back on the sugar in the muffin mix & maybe even add some chopped nuts. I misread the directions & used the whole can of pumpkin instead of just one cup & thought they turned out great- maybe more pumpkiny than they were supposed to be, I don't know!

I made these for my in-laws ... AWESOME! I followed the recipe .... excellent! One thing I did change was the length of time to cook, they only took 25 minutes, any longer & they would have been dry. They were nice & moist!!  I'll make these again!

This was pretty tasty. But, it was also too bland for our tastes! I will make these again with extra cinnamon and some ground cloves, as well as even more PP spice. Maybe if they sit for a day or two (not likely around here!), they'd have a more robust flavor. The topping was perfect, and they baked up beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved these!  I didn't make the topping for personal preferences.  Other than that followed the recipe as written.  I never buy pumpkin pie spice, always make my own.  I used the recipe on here by Penilu called 'Pumpkin Pie Spice I' and typed in one serving which equaled the 1 tablespoon called for in this recipe.  

Also, 2 apples was about 2 cups.

My family gobbled them up!  Will make again tomorrow with left over pumpkin from pumpkin pies!

Yummy! I used a 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of 1C listed & cut back sugar to 1.5C but will go with 1C next time because they were plenty sweet. I skipped the topping and they were excellent as is! I will definitely be making these often.

This is a wonderful recipe! It takes like the fall harvest. Made them in a the mini baby-loaf pans (approximately the size of 1-1/2 muffins), and they came out soft, moist and very good! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but enjoyed them with just a dash of all spice, cinnamon and all spice.

When figuring how much sugar to use, you have to consider any sugars already added to the pumpkin (if using canned pie filling and not just puree), the type of apple used, whether the applesauce is sweetened (if using), and the sugars present in any other ingredients, e.g., raisins, which are very sweet. I made the following changes: used applesauce instead of oil; added rolled oats to the streusel; folded golden raisins with the apple; used 1/2 whole wheat flour; used brown sugar instead of white in the streusel; substituted white sugar with Splenda (0.5 cup per cup); cinnamon and nutmeg instead of pumpkin spice. With these changes, the muffins were close to being too sweet, so I think that next time I would use still less Splenda.

These are FANTASTIC!  I made them for my sons preschool halloween party, and they were devoured.  Even my picky eaters loved them.  The apples and streusel add some nice texture, as pumpkin alone can seem a bit mushy.  This is what I did:
I made mini-muffins.  This recipe made about 72, and cooked in 15-18 minutes.  I used a whole can of pumpkin; this made them very moist and crumbly,which i liked.  If you want them to hold together well, maybe follow the recipe or split the difference.  I doubled the spice, which I would definitely do again. It does taste almost like a spice cake though, so if you want more pumpkin flavor then just follow the recipe.  I doubled the streusel for the mini-muffins, since you have more surface area.  
Note that the streusel recipe calls for 4 TEASPOONS of butter, not tablespoons!  I made that mistake the first time, and the topping melted everywhere.  My guess is that other reviewers who complained about the streusel made the same mistake.

These were just wonderful!  Used brown sugar for the streusel topping instead of white & about 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin for a more pronounced flavor.  Does anyone have any tips on keeping the topping crispy?  You're forced to cover them up to keep them from going stale but the topping goes all soft no matter what method you use (believe me, I've tried everything).

These muffins are absolutely delicious! 

I did make a few of my own changes as well. 
I am vegan so instead of eggs I used egg replacer.

Wonderful!!  I added extra pumpkin, used raw sugar instead of white, 1/2 wheat flour and olive oil instead of canola.  If we had nuts I would have added them.  I baked in an bundt pan and it took longer, but is really really good!

I did not peel the apples, and I'm glad I didn't.   I would only do that if I were serving them for company.  
Good recipe, and these went quickly!

Great recipie i just altered it a bit.  Too sweet so I used 11/2 C sugar.  Personally i will use 1 cup next time and used 1/4 C applesauce with 1/8th C plain yogurt and 1/8th C oil to replace the 1/2 C oil.  I also subbed out 1/2 C of reg flour for quick oats for a little nutrition.  Excellent.  I also added walnuts to the strussel.  Yummy.  Definetly will make again.

I don't like muffins.  Never have.  Never thought I'd find a recipe that would make me change my mind.  These are SOOO good.   Straight up - no changes needed to this recipe.  They are moist and light and freeze amazingly well - just pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds and they're steaming and fresh.  I found them when I was pregnant, and they were one of the few things I craved...  Update - this is still my absolute favorite recipe on the site.  I make them ALL THE TIME.

Excellent.  The amount of batter perfectly fits a 6-jumbo muffin tin plus a 9" round cake pan.  Bake both for 30 minutes.

These are very tasty and moist.  Both my husband and teenage son said they were great.  Follow the recipe and you can't go wrong.  I would suggest chopping the apples more finely than coarsely.

Love these, I used real pumpkin not canned (as canned is not found here in UK) they turned out great, only thing I didn't like was the time it took to dice the apples but in the long run it was worth it. Even my husband who HATES pumpkin really liked these.

I made some changes to make these a little healthier. I used half whole wheat flour, half Splenda and applesauce instead of oil. I also added 2/3 cup of toasted walnuts. I didn't use the streusel topping. They were moist and very good. I questioned the TBS of pumpkin pie spice, but it was the perfect amount. This is a keeper.

After reading several reviews that claimed the muffin was too sweet as it, I decided to use 3/4c brown sugar and 3/4c white sugar instead of 2c white sugar. I used 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce in place of the 1/2c of veg. oil. I used half white whole wheat flour and half unbleached all-purpose flour. I used an entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin. I used all brown sugar for the topping and baked for 36 minutes. They baked up beautifully and were moist and flavorful but not as sweet as I was led to believe. I may consider keeping it at 2 cups of sugar next time. There was also an aftertaste that reminded me of tea. My friends said it was good though but I'm not sure how I feel about them. I think it may have needed the full 2 cups of sugar to blend with the pumpkin, since it is a squash after all.

These were very good muffins but I made a few changes which is why I only gave them 4 stars.  I used one cup of sugar and they are plenty sweet!  I also substituted fat free sour cream for the oil and omitted the streusel topping.  Still very yummy!  I used pumpkin that I had cooked and pureed fresh, still good!  A yummy muffin, smells and tastes like fall!

Yum! The family and I loved these muffins!! I did tweak a little (it's impossible for me to follow a recipe exactly!) I substituted the oil for 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce and per other reviews added 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup flaxseed.  Turned out great!Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are really good. I didn't do the streusel topping (I figured it was already enough sugar!) and I used applesauce in place of oil. I also added about 1/4 cup each of wheat germ and ground flaxseed and you couldn't even taste it in the recipe.  Next time I think I would use three apples instead of two, because the apples tast so good in it and everyone wants the ones that have the most!
I found the cooking time to be long, I took them out after only 20 minutes. (only 10 minutes for the batch of mini-muffins I did)
Thanks for the great recipe!

These ended up being a little more work than I expected, not too bad though. I made cute little mini muffins and the streusel makes them look so professional. They were delicious! I will have to make them again!

These are good, hearty muffins. I went really healthy and substituted whole wheat flour, used softened real butter and virgin coconut oil for the oil, and date sugar instead of white sugar. I also added a swirl of honey and a few spoonfuls of pure molasses and some raisins. I only had cinnamon so thats the only spice I used, and I left off the struesel topping. Mine are slightly sweet and very moist and smell great. I think made this way they are great for a healthy snack on the go, and great for kids. Good recipe to play with.... I may make the regular version for T-day breakfast!

Very dense muffins. It tasted o.k. Nothing magical. The streusel topping was the best part. If you're looking for something to use that can of pumpin on, I would suggest pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. This is too time consuming and messy to make. The family liked them, but, I (who love pumpkin) was not that impressed. Good recipie if you're not looking for the "perfect fall recipie".

YUM! I loved these muffins! I didn't bother with the streusel topping and I cut the sugar to 1 cup (plenty sweet enough). The apples were a nice touch. Wonderful.

Really good recipe.  I usually look through the reviews before cooking.  So, I baked my apples before chopping, untill all extra juice was gone.  As well, I substituted oil for butter and added 1/4 cup of chopped wallnuts and the same amount of raisins.  I made 24 muffins: half with topping and half without.  Think, it is just slightly better with the topping.  Definately, would try making it again. Thanks!

This recipe makes a delicious cake.  I used the whole can of pumpkin, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I frosted my cake with cream cheese frosting and it was so good.

Absolutely delicious!  I left out the apples, and they were still very good.  However, they do call for a lot of sugar.  Has anyone tried making them with applesauce instead of oil?

Wonderful flavor!  I followed others' advice and used the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin, substituted applesauce for half the oil, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar in the topping.  These were *much* better the next day, by the way.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this muffin is 5*'s, but I agree with the other reviewers when they suggested using brown sugar for the topping. This topping was a bit sweet for such a hearty flavor muffin. I would have given a 5 if it hadn't been for that.  A perfect bkfst muffin..  Thank you! I will be making many more batches.

These muffins were definitely yummy, but I only gave them four stars for a couple of reasons.  First, the prep time isn't quick.  I gave up sifting halfway through and just dumped the dry ingredients together (it still worked fine).  Then there's the wet ingredients and chopping apples... it dirties a lot of bowls & utensils.  Also, I had issues with the streusel topping.  Maybe my butter wasn't cold enough, but it wasn't crumbly - it was a solid mass of soft butter and the other ingredients.  Because of this, I only put it on 12 out of the 18 muffins.  It turned out okay, but the butter from the streusel left puddles in the bottom of the muffin pan.  I didn't have a problem with the muffins being too moist, they were a great consistency.  I also got exactly 18 muffins, just as the recipe stated.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice.  Mmm... good!

Delicious.  I lightened up the recipe with applesauce and ended up with a very dense, moist bread.  It was good enough even without the streusel topping.  Wonderful comfort food.

These came out great!  I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I made a double batch and used applesauce to make up for the pumpkin I needed since a can didn't quite make it. I made muffins and a loaf of bread.  It froze great too!

Very good. I made one half of the recipe, just to test it out. I used applesauce instead of oil, and I made mini muffins instead of big ones. Also, instead of the topping, I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Even with these changes, these were still really good, but perhaps a tad too moist for my taste. In any case, they have the added benefit of making the house smell great!

Delicious! I didn't have any pumpkin puree so I just scooped out and mashed up a cup of roasted pumpkin, and I used what in Australia we call mixed spice instead off pumpkin pie spice, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written.

Absolutely delicious. Try this recipe right now! If you find them to be too moist, try not including the apple -- when I made these the second time using a scoop of apple preserves in each muffin instead of the chopped apple, they were significantly drier. (But tasted great either way!) I also find they take less time to cook than is stated, even though I fit all the batter into 12 instead of 18 muffins.

I also baked this in a bundt pan and it was really easy to prepare and smelled wonderful as it was baking.  I was able to taste it and it was really good and was very moist, however, when I went to go put it on a platter, the cake fell over on the floor and fell apart before anyone else was able to try it.  I will definitely make this again so that next time others can also try.  Instead of using pumpkin puree and pie spice, I used pumpkin pie filling and it turned out just as good.  Next time, I may also try adding pecans or walnuts to the batter.

Muffins were a hit; my daughter asked for the recipe to make them for her card club.  The preparation time given in the recipe is, at best, optimistic.  It might take the time given if your apples are already chopped, and your streusel already mixed.  Total prep time for me was closer to twenty minutes.  Baking time in my oven was 35 minutes, per the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and there's really nothing I'd change in it.

Nice and light muffins. I put 1,5 cups of sugar and didn’t do the topping, and it was still pretty sweet for me.

Absolutely wonderful - perfect for autumn or winter holidays when family gathers. Streusel topping, pumpkin spice, and fresh apples make this a five star recipe. I added 1/4 cup finely chopped hazelnuts and 1/4 cup cut raisins  to the recipe for breakfast  muffins that please children and guests of all ages.

These are delicious ! I thought that the 35-40 min baking time was appropriate; they definitely weren't done in 20 minutes as a few other reviewers said. For the apples, I used the gala variety and they worked great. I actually didn't realize that the pumpkin pie spice was supposed to have been a dry spice... I had a liquid version instead. It still ending up working out well, but if i used it again I would add in in with the pumpkin, egg and oil rather than the rest of the dry ingredients. The only other modifications I made was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I only added the streusel topping to some of the muffins.

I used the full can of pumpkin, as others suggested. I did add some old-fashioned oats to the flour mixture.  I did not add the streusel topping.  Hubby and brunch company loved them!

I made bread from this recipe.  I used home made pumpkin and I used the cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger instead of the pumpkin spice.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I didn't have fresh apples, so I used can of stewed apples from my pantry, and I added about a half cup of roasted chopped pecans.  I baked two loafs at 325 degrees for an hour and the bread is moist and delicious.  I like this recipe because substitutions can be used and it does not effect the outcome of the texture.  I didn't use the  streusel topping, I just sprinkled sugar over the top of the batter before baking.   I will keep this recipe close.

These were delicious!  When I saw 2 cups of sugar, I was turned off, but tried the recipe anyway, substituting brown sugar for 1/2 the amount and using whole wheat flour for one cup and white flour for the other one and half cups.  I like walnuts in muffins so I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts.  The recipe made 18 muffins, filling the cups to 2/3 full.  The streusel is just enough for all 18 and sets off the flavor deliciously. Also, I changed the pumpkin pie spice to 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Bake time was  a little less.  I checked them at 30 min. and they were done, using toothpick method.

This is a lovely fall muffin! I didn't put the streusel on and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. I think the next time I make them I'll add the streusel for the perfect amount of sweetness!

I substituted a half cup of whole wheat flour, brown sugar in the streusel and a quarter cup of the oil for apple sauce. They came out AMAZING!! Will definitely make these again. I just might add a tiny bit more butter in the streusel though.... :)

I'd rate these about a 4.5.  I've made them twice already and I'm going to make another batch today.  Even with measuring out all the dry ingredients the night before, It definitely takes more than 15 min. prep  but well worth the effort.  They freeze well too.

These are quite good, but they need a bit more texture, in my opinion. I added chopped walnuts, which helped considerably. Love the addition of pumpkin-so moist! As previous reviews suggested, I cut the sugar to 3/4 white and 3/4 brown, but frankly I would have preferred a little more sweet like the original recipe. The streusel topping adds so much visual appeal and flavor! Glad I didn’t omit it as some suggested. The recipe made 24 generous muffins. Only took 25 minutes in my oven, so watch the time. Thirty to forty-five minutes seems too long for muffins. Will definitely make again.

I made the recipe with 1/2 of the sugar called for since I don't like pastries too sweet.  Flavor was good, but didn't tasted the apple. The only way I knew apple was in them, was the texture. I would make them again.

I altered it because I had a few ingredients that needed to be used up and I also wanted to see if I could make a muffin that would be equally tasty and satisfy my families need to feel full after eating just one muffin. The orginal recipe was a great guide. I did not use the topping just the muffin batter. Love the flavor, a good recipe for sure. 

The changes I made are indicated by an * symbol.

~~~
*  2 cups all-purpose flour
*  1/2 cup powdered peanuts
[Find it where peanut butter is typically located in your store. It tends to keeps you fuller and I did not taste it in my final baked muffin batch.]
*  1 cup brown sugar (I didn't have white sugar)
-   1 tablespoon Pumpkin pie spice 
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
-   2 eggs, lightly beaten
-   1 cup pumpkin puree 
*   1 apple, w/o skin, core removed graded though 
*   A half-cut Zucchini w/o skin, graded through 
*   2 med-sized carrots (not thick), graded through

Damp out with a towel all the moisture from the food gratings. I suggest you have them all in one bowl.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease or use paper liners.

Use two bowls- one for primary all the 'wets' and another for all the 'dry' ingredients. The food gratings bowl ought to be your 'wet' assigned bowl.

Once you have all your measured ingredients.. pour the 'wets' bowl into the 'dry' one and fold in with a spoon. Fold until it becomes batter-like.

Use spoon to place batter into the muffin tin.

Used all white whole wheat flour.  Used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and only had 3/4 cup of pumpkin purée. Used brown sugar rather than white and 1/2 what recipe called for.  Added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  Baked for about 25 min.

Will make again!  I followed the advice of other reviewers, and used Brown sugar in place of half of white.  Very good!

These were delicious! While the recipe reports it yields 18, I made 24 muffins just fine. The streusel is amazing and the pumpkin and apple combo is fantastic. Definitely would make again!

I cut the white sugar to half, used whole wheat, almond flour and about 1/4 to 1/3c. of white flour , 2 T. of chia seeds.  Real butter enhanced them as a warm out of the oven dessert  with herbal tea. Great way to use up some leftover pumpkin from a can and some aging apples off the orchard trees.

I've been making these every year for 8 years now. everyone loves them and requests them over and over again! I have a mini muffin tin and this recipe makes about 24 "mini" muffins, which is enough for my family, the neighbors, and a few friends =]

Made this in a bundt pan and added Crasins for a mire festive look.  Baked it at 375’F for 45 mins with 10 mins cooling in the oven.  I did reduce the sugar by a half cup and replaced it with more pumpkin.  Also used 50/50 unsalted butter/veg. oil to give mire substance to the batter since I’m making this into a cake instead of muffins.  Instead of the crumbled topping, I dusted it with icing sugar  The cake was moist, moderately sweet, and the flavour was mild tasting.  Glad I added the half cup of dry cranberries as it gave the cake a bit more flavour.  Will give it another try for our Christmas lunch, but will add a tsp of cinnamon to boost the flavours.

I added an extra cup of apples because I had them and wanted to use them before they went bad! They weren't Golden Delicious and were sweeter so I should have added less sugar since I changed the apples.  Otherwise I loved them! Am taking them to my daughter's house so she can enjoy them too!

Had to alter recipe to make it vegan. Reduced sugar by 1/2 cup, used ground flax for eggs, and refined coconut oil instead of butter. Added a 1/4 cup more pumpkin puree. Also didn't have brown sugar so for the topping, I used demerara sugar and it was good! And added a maple glaze over them before baking. Kids ate them up.

AMAZING!!!! these came out perfect! though I did make 2 minor changes, I thought 2 cups of sugar seemed a bit much so I only used 1.5 cups, still really sweet. I used a whole can of pumpkin. and I did not use the streusel topping.

This review is mostly about the sweetness. I didn't enjoy the streusel topping much--made it too sweet even though I halved the sugar in the batter. Used applesauce and butter instead of oil and about half whole wheat and half AP flour-- this worked well. The pumpkin flavor comes through, but maybe I don't really like nutmeg, so I didn't find the flavor 100% pleasing. Will play around with the spices next time.

These are very good, very moist and flavorful. I used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour also used applesauce instead of oil and added 1/2 cup pecans. I made the streusel using brown sugar instead of white sugar. I will add a few finely chopped pecans to the streusel next time. This one is definitely a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious.  Only changes were I made two loaves and doubled the strudel topping and added oatmeal to the strudel.  I will definitely make this again.  Even my husband who hates apples in anything gobbled up half a loaf.  Thanks so much.

These came out great! I used all fresh ingredients from a local market I really like: pumpkin puree from scratch and fresh Macintosh apples. Well worth the effort! Only recommendation on this recipe: add WAY more flour to the streusel--2 tbsp was definitely not enough as the streusel was a paste not a crumble.

I made these for my grandsons, and we all loved these!!  I put about a half cup extra pumpkin in them, sand used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour. I also cut the sugar in the main part of the muffin by 1/2. They were moist and flavorful and the streusel added a lot!

We really liked this !  Followed others tips and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar (and less than called for) in batter and all brown sugar in the topping.  Also did the 1/2 oil/1/2 apple sauce thing and cooked all in a bundt cake pan.  Really yummy recipe!

These turned out so moist! I have to make a double batch each time because my family loves them so much.   The only chances I made, I reduced the sugar by half cup, added all spice, and for the topping I subbed the flour for oatmeal.

Great recipe! I loved these! Just the right amount of sweet and spice without going overboard on either. I didn't add the streusel topping as I thought it would be too sweet if included and I didn't miss it at all. In the future, I would sub apple sauce for all or part of the oil to make them a bit healthier.

This is a very good, dense muffin. I swapped applesauce for the oil, as I usually do, for the healthy aspect. And as someone else suggested I used less sugar, 1 1/2 cups as opposed to 2 cups. They're sweet, but not too sweet. I also did not put the streusel topping on them because another reviewer said they are very sweet. Also I'm transporting them for a weekend event and driving seven hours to get there and I thought it would be less messy without the streusel. They're very good!

This was very good and moist.  I made applesauce so I could use that instead of oil. I used other's suggestion of cinnamon,  nutmeg and ginger, I grated my apples and I used a stoneware loaf pan. When it was done and I had a slice, the outside "crust" had such a nice unexpected crunch, but the following days, lost the crunch, but remained moist throughout. Try a piece fresh for the perfect combination of crunch and moistness.

The first time I made I cooked for 35 minutes as per directions & they burned around the sides & were way overdone. The second time I cooked for 25 minutes & they were perfect. Probably could’ve gone 27 minutes, but 35-45 is way too long.

Yummy! Based on other reviews I did substitute 1/2cup apple sauce for vegetable oil and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. I used the pumpkin pie spice DIY recommended by another poster: 1 Tbls. pumpkin pie spice, substitute: 1 1/2 t. cinnamon, 3/4 t. ginger, scant 1/2 t. allspice, scant 1/2 t. nutmeg.

I got this exact recipe from my mom about 20 years ago. Since then, I made it every October for my growing office (1st one batch, then 2 and finally 3, at which point it was first come, first served). The buzz would start about a month in advance. The annual treat became a "diet cheat" for many. This muffin tradition has been continued by one of my daughters in her own home. These are delicious and always a hit.

Since becoming pregnant, I've been craving sweets and this recipe is the perfect balance of sweet and wholesome for breakfast.  I had to cut down the sugar by half since the recipe is a little too sweet for breakfast.  I also tried subbing the oil with applesauce.  The streusel topping is a must.  These are delish!

I made this with a couple changes.  I (accidentally) doubled the amount of spices, but this ended up being a good thing, as I love cinnamon!  I left off the topping since I already had too much cinnamon.  I made some into mini muffins (cooked for 12 minutes), and the rest were regular-sized muffins.  The mini muffins turned out perfectly - I had been worried that the apple would be hard, but I cut them into such small pieces, that it worked out ok.  The larger muffins actually got too done after just 35 minutes. I wish I had checked them at 30 minutes.  They weren't burnt, but the tops are a little too hard for my liking.  I still give it five stars though, as the over-cooking might just be my oven.

This is a really good recipe, I loved the idea of adding chopped apples to a pumpkin muffin. I am always looking for ways to reduce the sugar in recipes, so I halved the sugar with cane sugar and they were still sweet and delicious. Next time, I will do a half a cup of sugar and half a cup of honey I think. I will also add nuts, but overall a really good moist muffin, the family loved them. Note- the directions say to cook for 45 minutes, I've never made a muffin that required that long in the oven, I cooked mine for 20 minutes and they were perfect.

If you like spice aroma this one is right for you. I cant manage to find instant pumpkin pie spice i had to mix by myself but i cant manage to find allspice. It is very good and easy. Ill try to make it again if i can find allspice and see how much the smell different.

Absolutely Delicious.  Made it for a lunch I had for friends. Everyone raved about them.  I served it with "Missy's Candied Walnut Gorgonzola Salad" and a breakfast bacon & hash brown casserole. For dessert "Key Lime Pie VIII"( in "Graham Cracker Crust" ).  Everything turned out great.

These muffins turned out very oily..  I used muffin cups and the grease bubbled over into the pan and the cups were oily as well as the muffins.  If I make them again, I will cut the oil in half..

My crew loved these! I do not use pumpkin pie spice so I added cinnamon and nutmeg in its place. I also did not add the streusel  topping and it was plenty sweet. I will be making these again.

Moist and sweet, though I added a bit of unsweetened applesauce as my pumpkin wasn't very moist (not from a can). I would add even more spice next time. Maybe even some raisins or cranberries because I like bits in my muffins. I put oatmeal in the streusel and reduced the sugar and flour.

Absolutely delicious!  I made some substitutions, but I'm sure it's delicious as is too.  Instead of 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice I used: 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp apple pie spice.  Instead of 1/2 cup veg. oil I used: 1/4 cup veg. oil and 1/4 cup natural applesauce.  I did think my batter looked a little too thick before putting the apples in so I added 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup pumpkin puree, which made the consistency perfect.  For the streusel, instead of white sugar I used dark brown sugar and I also added more butter because it wasn't as crumbly as I typically like it.  Winner muffin recipe for this family!

Really good!  I made this in a 9x13 Pyrex.  I baked it 37 minutes at 350 degrees and it came out perfectly.  Following other reviewers, I used 1/4 C. oil and 1/4 C. applesauce; added 1 tsp. vanilla; used 1 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup brown sugar; and used a whole can (14 oz?) of canned pumpkin puree.   I did not put the topping on - it was already sweet enough ( and I love sweet desserts).     Will definitely make this again.

I made these for my grandson's 1st grade class the day it was his turn to bring snack.  The class loved them, especially when delivered by Grandma.  I then made them for my granddaughter's kindergarten class on her turn at snack day. I could not stay that day, but she told me they ended up having seconds.  These turn out moist and tasty.  I used a bit of brown sugar in the streusel out of habit.  Considering they are kindergarten and 1st grade approved, the recipe will stay in my favorites!

Taste was not bad, but the thickness of the batter made it difficult to make anything other than small muffins. I even added about a half cup of milk to make the batter thin enough to stir in all the flour. A good idea if you have a leftover cup of pumpkin puree, as I did. They are getting eaten, but I'm not really that happy about how they turned out.

Great recipe, though I excluded the streudel topping because I did not want the extra sweetness. I used slightly more canned pumpkin and slightly less sugar than called for in the recipe. I added walnuts and dried cranberries, which worked very well with these flavors. I want to try the recipe again with dark chocolate chips and/or walnuts, or make a basic cream cheese frosting for a topping.

These were killer. I used the full can of pumpkin and halved the oil to make it a little healthier, and they still came out dense, moist, and perfect.

This recipe is perfect as is--delightfully spiced, not dry, lots of flavor!  Each time I have brought them in to work they disappear very quickly.

I followed the recipe except substituted 1/2 cup oats for 1/2 cup flour and I found them a little dry...next time I will add 1 banana and chop the Apple in the food processor to evenly distribute moisture in the muffins

Seeing the ingredients, I treated this as a dessert. We served it ala mode with pumpkin ice cream and pumpkin whipped cream on top, and it was AMAZING! The only possible upgrade would have been if we drizzled caramel on top.  Maybe next time.

Substitutions: I used olive oil, because that's what I had in the house.  To prevent that olive taste, I used orange infused olive oil  for about 1/4 cup and Mission Manzanillo for the other 1/4 cup. I think that orange flavor added that little extra "something" for the tastebuds.  I also improvised on the pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any, and I don't measure, but tend to be a little heavy handed with the spices.  But the result was incredible!

The family loved these. They were moist and not too sweet.
I substituted 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. ginger and 1/8 tsp. ground cloves for the pumpkin pie spice and the flavor was perfect.  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar for the topping and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans also.  Definitely will make again!

These were a hit with my family, my 16 year old daughter loved these! I did make a few small changes as I always try to get the most nutritional value out of all recipes. I used 1 cup of ww flour & 1 1/2 cups of white, used only 1 cup of sugar instead of two and for the streusel topping, I used brown sugar instead of white. Enjoy!!

This is a pretty tasty muffin. I've had better streusel on top of muffins before. Next time I'll use a different streusel topping.

I don't do the streusel topping, but I follow everything else and these come out great.  I ran out of apples so I'm going to try making them with raisins today.  I also use homemade pumpkin puree instead of canned.

These were excellent.  I used less sugar and the whole can of pumpkin.  I only had olive oil so I used that.   My apple was only about 1 1/2 cups.  I skipped the topping, too.  I'm going to make again and cut the sugar down to 1 cup.  I got 28 muffins.  Moist and rich from the pumpkin.  This is a somewhat flexible recipe.  It would be good with golden raisins, and if I had chopped dates I think that would work and keep the sugar down to compensate for the sweetness of the dates.  Loved the spiciness, perfect for a chilly autumn day.

I made these without the topping and with a little extra apple and they were delicious!  They don't even need the topping - although I'm sure it's good.  I'd make these again for sure.

These were super easy to make and came together very quickly.  I made the recipe exactly as  is, so I could rate it that way.  My family loved these muffins!  And so did my neighbors , as we sent some over to their home as well. They were a perfect way for the family to  wake up to on a  beautiful autumn morning, with the lovely smells wafting through our home. We did not think the muffins were too sweet, and we loved the streusal on top.  I will make a few changes next time, I will add some chopped walnuts, just a personal preference. And I will use brown sugar in the streusal.  I do agree with other reviewers that the baking time needs to be watched carefully, 35 minutes was too long.  Check the muffins before that timer or you will have overdone muffins.

These are great-- don't hesitate to give them a try-- white sugar or brown, white flour or wheat, it all works. They don't really need the topping if you're short on time....

I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used apple pie spice.  I used a little more apple than it called for (maybe 2.5 cups).  I hate it when recipes say to use only a cup of pumpkin - what do you do with the leftover???  So, I used the whole can.  I also always use KA white/wheat flour to add a little fiber.  

I ended up with 24 good sized muffins.  They would have been too big for us if I only made 18.

I used white whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil, maple syrup instead of sugar but only half as much as the sugar called for. Healthier version but still very good. Left off streusel. Will definitely make again. Family loved them.

My pumpkin hating husband loves these!  I made a second batch to take to church and he wanted to keep them.  So, I will have to make a third batch to take to church. I don't know if this batch will make it that far.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the muffin batter.

Wow. Just wow. The texture is perfect, they are full of flavor and very moist. 

I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar. They were still plenty sweet. Used butter instead of oil and 100% whole wheat flour.  Also used the whole can of pumpkin.

I really enjoyed these muffins. The only changes I made were using one cup brown sugar and one cup white and then using applesauce instead of oil. I also used the pumpkin spice recipe that someone else posted. I took a batch of these muffins to a women's breakfast and they disappeared very quickly.

Dude! So good! I switched the flour out for the gluten free flour (from this site) so it was coworker friendly and had no issues with the change. I used a lot of apple, used applesauce instead of oil and added chocolate chips to some. The worst thing in the regular ones was the sugar, so I even let the kids eat them for breakfast so I could convince myself they were eating fruits.

I made this recipe. I made it in a bundt pan. Yum. I did cut the sugar to a cup and a half. And.. used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I substituted applesauce for the oil. What an awesome combination of pumpkin with apples. So moist.

These were fast to put together and delish! I cut the sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 and they were still fine. All 5 of my kids enjoyed them. They were nice and moist and the chunks of apple were the best!!

My family and I really loved them. They were moist and delicious. I increased the  apples to 3 cups because I peeled too many apples and didn't want them to go to waste.  I used 1/2 applesauce for the oil.  I will use all applesauce for the oil next time. The recipe was a winner and I will be making them again.

Very good. I cut the sugar by half a cup, and topped only half of them with streusel. Made a dozen large. Will definitely make again.

This is not a pretty muffin but oh so tasty.  The recipe sounded like fall & after eating one, I realized they taste like fall.  There's just a  hint of pumpkin, and they are moist, fluffy and delicious!

I've made these multiple times and they always turn out perfect. With the serving size set to 18, I used 2 large gala apples and substituted applesauce for the oil, a little extra cinnamon and added vanilla. I don't think a topping is needed. It made 12 large muffins and 22 mini muffins.

I made no changes at all - this is a very good recipe. And the streusel makes it even better!  But the next time I make this recipe I will put 1/4 to 1/2 cup less sugar in the mixture. It was a bit too sweet for me. I'm also going to try applesauce instead of the oil.

Good recipe, I made a few alterations to suit my needs. I lowered the sugar by a half cup, I think it could be cut down a little more as they were still pretty sweet. I added an extra half cup of pumpkin,  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. I added 3/4 cup of oats to make them more breakfasty for my kids, and I omitted the topping.  They were yummy, and my kids ate them, so I will for sure be making these again.

When I first read pumpkin Apple streusel muffins, I wasn't quite sure how it would turn out. I read all the great reviews though, and thought, let's give it a try! I am sooooo glad that I did! They are a new favorite in our house... I would highly recommend these muffins

These are excellent!  We doubled the batch and in the same mixing bowl did 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose white....1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce instead of the oil, and  topped 1/2 with streusel and 1/2 without.  My kids sought out th streusel muffins first , but ate them all up!  On our second time making them now!  Perfect fall flavors!

I followed the recipe exactly as directed. The muffins were absolutely  delicious. I cut the apples into fine  pieces so as not to have big chunks.  Because I divided batter into 24 muffins, I watched the time carefully ...reducing the baking time a bit.
I will definitely be making these again and again! ??

I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar , instead of 2. and it is great!!! Possible to even reduce the sugar further if you use a sweet apple as I did.

I found them to be just okay, especially after the amount of time it takes to put the recipe together.  I'm glad that I took one cook's suggestion of substituting one of the cups of white sugar with brown sugar so that it was half white, half brown.  Otherwise, they would have been too sweet.  I wish that I had taken another cook's suggestion of adding some nuts.  I think that that would have given the muffins some oomph.  I wouldn't bother to take the time to make these again.

These muffins are absolutely delicious.  My husband loved them, which says a lot, since he is very picky.  I used coconut oil in place  of vegetable oil, and coconut sugar in place of granulated sugar.

Everyone loved them. The only thing I would do differently is substitute brown sugar for the white sugar on the crumble top, then it will be a 5 star for sure.

I made my own pumpkin spice, since I couldn't find it in my country.  Also, I substituted the eggs for 2 tablespoons of firm yogurt per 4 tblsp in total. Great recipe!

I made these muffins according to the directions and they were DELICIOUS!!!  The batter seemed thick, but the apples made the muffins very moist.   My husband found them very sweet - especially with the streusel topping, but friends and I enjoyed them.  I would say that it took me at least 30 minutes to prepare and not 15 as stated in the recipe.  I will definitely make these again!

very tasty!  I omitted the struedel topping for a lower calorie version and my kids still ate them.  I would have put in a little bit more apple so that flavor would have come out more.

Delicious! I made these without the topping per recommendations of others. They were moist, flavorful and made my house smell like Fall! My kids likes them but picked all the apples out so next time I may make a 1/2 of the batter without apples.

Well a dozen of these didn't last but a day and a half in my house! I left out the streusel since they are sweet enough as is. In fact the next time I make them (which will be soon since I've already gotten requests) I plan to reduce the sugar by *at least* 1/2 cup. Just thinking about adding more sugar to them in the form of streusel makes my teeth hurt. I also added 1/4 cup chopped pecans. I used 1 really big honey crisp apple which came to over 2 cups chopped. It made the muffins really moist so I might omit the oil next time as well. This recipe is the epitome of fall flavors. I will be baking these all season!

They were very sweet as is...but really good!

It was very moist and tasty.  Just like I like my muffins.  My 10 year old daughters made this by themselves with the exception of coring and peeling the apple.

These were super easy to prepare. I used the whole can of pumpkin. Didn't want to waste it. They are in the oven as I type this. Will edit my rating after tasting them.

These are ok.  Might try with brown sugar next time.  Like the combination of apples and pumpkin.

These were terrific and will be a fall favorite for sure! I omitted the topping completely and did some tweaks to make healthier but they came out so good, and healthy enough that they can be considered a decent breakfast option for kids on a rushed morning:-)
Changes I made: Subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour, coconut oil for liquid, halved the sugar.  All in all they were very tasty and a nice treat without extreme sweetness- plus they are filled with good things, too! Next time I might make a loaf out of the batter. Thanks for the recipe!
One thing to note: I noticed the recipe said bake 35-40 min and I generally only bake my muffins for 15min so I checked at 20 min and they were fully cooked around 22min. Just FYI for bake time.

These were good. Used whole 15oz can pumpkin purée and I shredded about 4-5 small apples to make up about 2 cups apples. Substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil but also added about 1/4cup melted butter since the batter seemed a bit dry. I also used 1 C brown sugar and 1 C white and and added a splash of vanilla to the batter. I made mini muffins and added chocolate chips into half the batter. I only put the streusel on the non chocolate chip ones but next time I'll skip it all together as it wasn't necessary. Baked at 350 for about 20-25 mins. Yielded about 4 dozen. My 2 & 4 year old really liked these!

Very tasty, very moist, and a good use of that lonely leftover can of pumpkin purée in my cupboard. Mine came out a little flat, but I freely admit I might need fresh baking powder. ;) I got exactly 17 muffins.

Good recipe! This was my first time cooking with pumpkin. Very moist and flavorful. I admit to adding raisins and vanilla (because I put vanilla in everything I bake). I think next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll use craisins but YUM!

Decreased recipe to half and did not use streusel topping. It was good enough without it and maybe would be too sweet with it. Added a tsp of vanilla to bring out the pumpkin flavor more and did not use egg because I didn't have any. After combining wet and dry ingredients, there wasn't enough wet so added a little more pumpkin and oil and a little more pumpkin pie spice. Used about 3/4 can of pumpkin purée total (for halved recipe). These muffins were delish and my 4 year old and 2 year old loved them! The missing egg didn't make a bit of difference so this recipe could be used for those with egg allergies.

These are very good muffins.  Great flavor.  I really had to decrease the amount of sugar though to 1 and 1/2 cups
(1 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown sugar), especially since there is a sweet streusel topping. The apple makes these muffins different with an additional layer of flavor. I didn't like that the muffin papers were quite oily. I may decrease the amount of oil next time or replace all or part with apple sauce. I will definitely make these again though!

I have been making this recipe for about 20 years.  My kids have loved these from the time they were small.  Over the years I have adjusted the sugar down to one cup and they are still yummy.  The topping is so delicious I would never skip it.  I am getting ready to put a batch in the oven now.  Can't wait smell them baking.

Just finished making this wonderful recipe and the house smells amazing! I had frozen apples so I compensated for the extra moisture by throwing in a handful of quick cooking oats. I also added a handful of raisins to the mix to give texture. I also added some oats to the mix for the topping of the muffins to pair with the oat meal that was inside. Very happy with the outcome, not the best for you with all that sugar but they were a wonderful way to use up the extra pumpkin that I had left over from another recipe. Very yummy!

My family and I have made these muffins multiple times, every fall, since I found this recipe a few years ago. I have made it exact and with substitutions, but no matter what you do, these muffins are delicious! I usually half the white sugar, and add brown sugar for the other half. I prefer not making the topping, because the muffins themselves have great flavor. I've used canned pumpkin and fresh pumpkin, and prefer fresh. It does take awhile to make, (a good half hour or so) but they're SO good! The first time I made them, I was surprised that they were pretty dense, but now, the kids know as soon as I start dicing apples what I'm making!! Thanks for a great recipe!! These muffins freeze well, and make great lunch box additions!

The only reason I gave this recipe four stars is because I thought the recipe had too much sugar and needed tweaking. I substituted white whole wheat flour for the white flour and used 1 1/2 C unpacked brown sugar instead of white sugar, but I think I can still cut that back.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, but next time I will use applesauce, which I usually do when making muffins..  Since the white whole wheat flour tends to be a bit dry, I added 2/3 C milk (that's all I had left and wanted to use it up) apple juice or water will work.  I made 1/2 doz. muffins without the streusel topping and 1/2 with.  I really don't think you need the topping, since the muffins are plenty sweet on their own.  If I had some finely chopped walnuts, I would have added them, too.  Next time.

Delicious! I made the muffins as is but omitted the topping.  Glad I checked them at 30 minutes because they were perfectly done by then. Very moist and full of flavor. Will make again!

I thought this was very good!   I don't like rating a recipe with my changes, but the changes I made were very minor.  I used only 1.5 cups of sugar in the recipe instead of two and used brown sugar for the topping.  I put it all in a 9x13 because I didn't have time to do individual muffins--baked for 30 minutes and it was perfect!!!  I will make again.

Okay, my husband and I LOVED THESE... But only because we made some healthier choices: I used one cup white flour and a cup and a half of whole wheat. I substituted Apple sauce for the oil and threw in a quarter cup extra as well as a quarter cup extra of the pumpkin to make up for the extra absorption of the whole wheat. I also cut out a whole cup of sugar, which, with the sweetness of the apples and applesauce we didn't miss. I also left off the streusel topping. Finally, I felt the cooking time was a little long. I put mine in for 25 min. and they were perfect. They are fabulous! I haven't even finished my first one and I'm writing this review!  My husband remarked that they'd be excellent sliced, dipped in egg, and cooked as French toast... And you know... So healthy!! ;)

This recipe is totally awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly and my rating is the full 5 stars.  I made another batch and added a teaspoon of nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon.  I also added a full cup of chopped pecans.  Next time I will add a little bit of vanilla.  I am going to use applesauce in place of the oil and will use the whole can of pumpkin.  The streusel on top puts the whole thing over the top!  This recipe is so flexible with spices and nuts and can be made into muffins, bars, tube cake, etc., brown sugar can replace white sugar.  It's all good.  This is a full fledged keeper in my house and will definitely be a holiday special!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Be sure and try this one.  It's easy, too.

Delicious pumpkin flavor. I substituted  applesauce for the oil. I do not recommend using muffin papers though.  They really stick to the muffins and are hard to peel off .

Too much sugar means the outside gets a little tough and chewy when done. They're still tasty, despite that.

Very delicious, makes a nice sized muffin.  Used spray for pan and they come out super nice.  My 14 yr old daughter made these and they are the best tasting muffin.  Family loves them!

Awesome recipe. Will definitely be a regular in our house. I cut the sugar by half the first time. Second time cut it out completely and added 4 packets of sugar twin for my diabetic hubby and his brother.

So moist! So good! I personally prefer my streusel with brown sugar. I grated apple instead of chopping it as I was in such a hurry this morning and cranked the oven temperature to 400 degrees for 25 min. It still came out awesome! I will be making this again!

Just took these out of oven.  Made almost as recipe states; got 12 regular size muffins and 24 minis.  Used one large Granny Smith apple, grated, and cut sugar by 1/4 cup.  Everything else I followed as recipe states.  Super moist and delicious.  Keeper.  :)

This made perfect muffin-top muffins with only the following changes: I used fresh pumpkin, not pureed. I use the medium roasting ones; maybe they're not so fibrous to need puree. Also added one egg. This muffin is very sweet with the struesel topping; I'd save this recipe for special occasions (autumn tidings, pot-lucks, etc). I wonder if the topping is necessary to achieve that perfect muffin top I got, or if it was the egg. I used paper liners to deliver these in boxes. They were a hit. Noting that I also used organics: cane sugar, pumpkin, coconut oil and organic apples.

I doubled the recipe but only used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4, which would have been too much.  Also used less spices.  Muffins are great with these changes.  Got 36 muffins with a double recipe.  Will definitely make these muffins again soon.

Very Good! I followed the recipe to a T and my family loved it. I might play with this recipe a bit as my family really enjoys pumpkin and the pumpkin flavor in this was very mild.

Very moist and yummy. I read other reviews and used 1/2 cup less sugar and skipped the streusel topping. They taste delicious.  My husband even commented they taste "healthy". Will definitely make again.

Great recipe. The pumpkin flavor really comes through. The only change I made was using 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 and it was plenty sweet. I will use 1 1/4 cup next time.

These are amazing! I used whole wheat flour and 1/2c less sugar and they were moist and sweet. Next time I make them, I'll use 1 to 1 1/4c sugar. The batter was actually too thick and I added 1/2c low fat milk. I also added chopped walnuts and my husband loved them. There was enough batter for nine large muffins.

Great muffins but I made some changes to make them healthier. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour, cut sugar in 1/2 (can't imagine using 2 cups!). Used fresh roasted pumpkin as it is the season. Also, used fresh made apple sauce instead of oil and omitted the streusel. Also made a 2nd batch with chopped walnuts. They were great! I'd suggest using a pie pumpkin instead of canned pumpkins. It is so simple to roast one and it tastes so much better. No need for all that oil either, apple sauce works great and sweetens it up allowing you to reduce the white sugar. I will try again with even less sugar.

these turned out amazing!!!! I used homemade pumpkin pie filling I made with maple syrup and heavy whipping cream and I added a homemade caramel drizzle on top that i made using an evaporated milk recipe. The drizzle makes the muffin in this case!!!! i can't give this enough stars! I will be making these again for sure!!!

V. good. The pumpkin flavor got overtaken with the apple streusel flavor. Perhaps more pumpkin spice next time.

I made these this morning.  They are almost gone.  I used 1 1/2 Cup sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon.  Next time I will make the crumb topping and add pumpkin seeds as posted in a picture, they looked so nice!  I will definitely be making these again and share the recipe.  Thank you

Super easy to make. Would absolutely lower the sugar amount and add toasted salted pecans to the topping.

I liked it. I substituted the pumpkin spice for 2t of cinnamon, 1/2t of clove, 1/2 of nutmeg. I would do less clove and nutmeg next time but it brought a lot of flavor to the muffins. I also substituted the oil for apple sauce which mad them a little more dense. And I did half born sugar half white not sure if it made much of a difference taste wise. Oh and besides the streusel I added cream cheese frosting with pecans. yum. I would not do the streusel again either.

Made these for a quick breakfast for our son.  Easy to make and delicious.  I did cut the sugar by half a cup and they were still sweet.  Omitted the crumb topping also - but still great and kid approved.

These. Are. Amazing. I substituted melted butter for the oil and didn't bother with the streusel topping--another reviewer was right, they are plenty sweet without. I used my home canned apples and added walnuts to it too. Unreal how good these things are. Seriously unreal.

I used this to make apple pumpkin bread! It was a huge hit! The only difference I did was I used 1/2-1 cup of applesauce instead of 2 cups of apples. It turned out amazing! Thank you thank you thank you!

Love this recipe (with sugar reduced to our taste), but if I had baked them 35-40 minutes, they would have been burned. Standard size muffins took about 25 minutes.

Delicious.  I used much less sugar, applesauce instead of oil, and half whole wheat flour.  I also used less apple and added raisins (and I didn't bother with the topping.).  Despite all that they were still delicious.

Delicious!  I gave the rating 4 instead of 5 since the topping was weird. I had to add about a 1/2cup of quick oats to the topping to make it crumbly enough to add to the muffin tops. In the end thy were tasty and smelled great while baking!

Made these for the first time and baked them into 12 "muffie" muffin tops. Very moist, yummy, and filling. Even better than Panera's pumpkin muffies.

I am conflicted on this recipe. The batter is very thick and sadly the final result made a dense doughy muffin. The flavor though was good, I would double the pumpkin spice though. Then amount of sugar is a bit much, reduce it for less sweetness. I did find the muffin a bit sweet but I was okay with that. I liked the streusel topping but again it's mostly sugar. Not sure if I will make again due to it being so dense, I like fluffy muffins.

I used pears instead of apples. The flavor of the pears blended beautifully with the pumpkin. Everyone who tried these loved them. I received numerous complements on these. Very moist and delicious.

There is too much flour in this recipe. The batter was very difficult to stir towards the end. The texture in the end was dense and doughy. I love pumpkin and apples but there is something wrong with the dough recipe.  The streusel on top made it more edible.

I used this recipe to make healthy "cupcakes" for a kids party.  Instead of the streusel topping, I made Cream Cheese Frosting II (from this site).  I also used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour in place of regular, but changed nothing else.  Excellent!  (Should have made a double batch!)

I omitted the streusel portion only because my boys are finicky. No apple chunks either. Used applesauce instead of oil, added about a 1/4 cup of water to mix easier, and a dash or so of cinnamon. Baked 25-30min instead... my house has never smelled so yummy! My boys truly enjoyed this!!!

I liked this recipe with a few changes of my own - I used a mixture of unbleached AP, oat and whole wheat flour; added chopped pecans; used brown sugar instead of white. Please keep an eye on the cooking time, I  had to reduce mine.  These turned out moist and fragrant with the aromas that tell us the holidays are upon us. They are great with morning coffee or as a snack with hot tea. Hubby loved them, so I will definitely make again.

Very tasty! I followed the recipe pretty closely but might substitute brown sugar for some of the white next time. I made mini muffins so chopped the apple quite small and it was great. Made approx. 48 mini muffins. Definitely saved this one for holiday breakfasts.

These were some of the best muffins I've ever made!!! I did as some reviewers suggested and replaced the oil with an equal amount of applesauce. I also subbed the white sugar for brown with excellent results. Taste was amazing, the muffins were perfectly moist and the struesal was a wonderful touch! I did use paper muffin liners and the muffins stuck to the bottom so I'll try using cooking spray and putting the batter straight into the muffin pan next time. This recipe yielded 24 muffins for me (I filled each about 3/4 full with great results). Thanks!!

I have made this both with and without the streudel topping, and it was delicious both times. Extremely moist. The first time I had to use 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter because I ran out of oil, but I imagine that it makes little difference using one over the other. Love it - now my go to pumpkin baking recipe!

These muffins are awesome! Took them to a gathering and everyone loved them! I used half portion of brown sugar and half white sugar for the muffin batter and all brown sugar for the crumb. Also I used fresh pumpkin, not canned. Will be sure to make these again!

Seriously the best muffins I've ever had. I didn't have apples, so I did 3 cups of pumpkin - fabulous.

I didn't think I would like pumpkin muffins, but I made these for my daughter, and they were YUMMY!  I used 1 1/2 c. sugar instead of the 2 cups, and I substituted butter-flavored Crisco instead of the vegetable oil.  I didn't use the streusel topping, either (I thought they would be plenty sweet without it).  They were moist and soooooo good!  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks.

Used the ingredients called for but did cut back on the sugar and it was still sweet.  I am going to make them again today for hubby to take to work but will make them as mini muffins.

Best muffins EVER ... made twelve instead of eighteen and got the biggest tastiest muffin tops ... just cook about five minutes longer due to the larger size ... and DO NOT skip the streusel topping... it's well worth it

I really liked this. I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin I mashed with potato masher. 1 apple cored and chopped. 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 carrot shredded, 1 1/4 cup of white flour, 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. I did away with the streusel top because I planned on serving these for breakfast :)

These muffins were GOOD! Only thing I would do differently is to make sure to chop apples smaller..they seemed to add too much moisture and so these muffins were ALMOST too moist!

These turned out burnt. I should have taken them out around 20-25 minutes, they didn't even make it to 35. Also, all I could taste was sugar.

Wow, wow, Wow! Made these today for a middle school party. I used individual spices in lieu of pumpkin pie spice. I did not use muffin liners the first time, sprayed the cups instead & they did not come out of the cups well - so that was the family's batch. Second try I added a little more cinnamon & nutmeg (2:1- 2 tsp cinn, 1 tsp nutmeg) then added a pinch of salt to the topping mixture & used muffin liners. Each batch tasted like Autumn - so smart & out of this world! My teen said finding the apples inside was like finding little treasures. Brilliant recipe; thank you!!!

This was a great recipe - I followed the advice of others and made the following changes:

Change - to 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of white sugar (not 2 cups sugar)
Change - 1/2 cup apple sauce (not 1/2 cup oil)
Add - 1 tsp vanilla extract
Add - 1/2 tsp almond extract

I also did not make the topping and found them still sweet and delicious. Will definintely be making this again.

Great recipe. I love to make this with fresh pumpkin or butternut squash. When made with fresh pumpkin or squash it is easy to reduce the sugar without losing the flavor. I reduce the sugar to 1 cup and substitute some of the oil with applesauce. I omit the strudel topping because the muffins are already sweet enough.

I followed the recipe as is + 1 tsp of vanilla in there. It made 24 muffins perfectly.  Very filling muffin that will make a grab 'n go for breakfast. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Delicious, wouldn't change a thing. The spices were a wee bit overpowering though... I know my mom would probably back those down... but I love it.

Delicious muffins, perfect for the fall! I changed the sugar to 1 and a half cups instead, and they are still very sweet. Next time I'll try just a little more than 1 cup. I added a small handful of raisins, as well as pumpkin seeds (about 1/4 cup of each). I filled one regular and one mini muffin tin, which used up all the of batter perfectly! Now there are some little ones for the kids' lunches and bigger ones for breakfast at home! I also skipped the streusel part, no need for it as there was so much flavor in the muffin! Very good recipe, will definitely use again!

Absolutely delicious!  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil, plus a little extra pumpkin, and they were unbelievably moist and delicious. I may try to decrease the amount of sugar next time to make them a tad healthier, but my family absolutely loves them!

Easy to throw together and great result.  Big hit with kids and adults an so I will definitely make again.  I made a half batch and it was perfect for a full pan of mini muffins.  I made only the muffin part and not the streusel so my reivew is for that part alone.  The muffin was very moist, flavorful- being more pumpkiny than applely but the apple chunks were delicious and made it more than just another pumpkin muffin. Definitely sweet enough that I don't think they would need streusel.   I finely diced my apples by hand, so they were appropriate for mini muffins (and toddler mouths) and they were perfectly cooked.  My mini muffins took about 18 minutes to cook.

My daughter is allergic to eggs and nuts.
To adapt the recipe for her issues and our taste, I used cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice and a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin to make up for the egg I left out.  The muffins have a moist, a little denser than cake-like consistency (not crumbly like some muffin-without-egg-recipes) and they taste delicious.

I loved these muffins-but I DID alter the streusel topping by using 1/4 Cup real butter, room temp, 1/4 C flour, 1/4 Cup white sugar, 1/4 Cup brown sugar, approx 1/4 Cup oats, and some cinnamon. I don't usually measure, but these are pretty close. Enjoy! Oh, also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice but used a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and ginger.

Moist and delish! Halved the recipe which made 6 regular sized muffins and 5 mini's. I took the suggestion of reducing the sugar by half which turned out to the the perfect amount of sweetness for us. I added 1/4 c. raisins and will try shredding the apple next time. Walnuts would also make a wonderful addition. Make sure to fill your muffins to the brim to get the perfect muffin top. Before you pop them into the oven spray the top of the muffin tin with spray so the overflow doesn't stick. Will make again!

Great recipe!  Because I had an acorn squash to use up I baked it then made puree with it and used that instead of the pumpkin.   Left all other ingredients the same, then baked in a bundt pan instead of muffins.  (55 mins at 350.)  Perfection and rave reviews.  Will make again soon I'm sure.

Perfectly delicious. I do not add the streusel topping and they taste just fine. Save a few calories that way!

I was looking for a great, moist pumpkin muffin recipe and I came across this one.  I couldn't have found a better one.  When I cook muffins I only use the large muffin pans and a single recipe makes me 12 large muffins.  I've made this recipe twice now and the first time I followed the recipe exactly but the second time I only used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of ground cinnamon.  The flavor was more mellow.  I also added a full bag of white baking chips and about a cup of chopped pecans. The white chocolate is not overpowering and gives the muffins a touch of vanilla with each bite.  This is definately a favorite of ours!

Seriously the best of the pumpkin muffin recipes I've tried.  I subbed in half wheat flour and half brown sugar, both of which I think improved an already good recipe.  This recipe is practically fool-proof.  I chopped the apples in my food processor, to varying sizes.  The time on my oven was 35 minutes -- exactly as stated on the recipe.  However, my oven seems to run slightly slow, so I would check at 25-30 minutes if you have a fast oven.

These were delicious! They are definitely a heavier, more substantial muffin. I think these were festive and tasty and my kids loved them! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

These are amazing! I made them for my family and co-workers and granted I've inherited the great baker gene from my grandfather these flew off the plate so fast I had to bring in a new batch the next day! If you decide to make them I assure you, you will not disappoint!

My family loved these.  I used brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping and fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned.  You would not even know that there was pumpkin in them (good way to sneak in a vegetable).

Made these tonight.  I used gluten free flour (2 cups) and corn meal (1/2 cup).  I also added ground flaxseed (1 tablespoon).  I also used applesauce instead of apples. These muffins are yummy!!! 

Gave it 4 stars since I had to work some magic to make them gluten free.  But all in all, a great recipe.  My 9 yr old enjoyed helping as well.

I baked it in a bundt pan without the topping.  I made a vailla orange glaze from powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and a touch of triple sec.  Pour that over cooled cake. Family loved it.

Loved these. I halved the sugar and used dark brown instead of white. I also skipped the streusel topping, because I find such to be messy and overly sweet. The apples made these sweet enough for me, yum!

These were absolutely amazing, super moist. My changes: added only 2c of flour, more than 1c of pumpkin, used store-bought egg replacers (I'm a vegetarian) and used half white sugar - half brown molasses sugar, less than 2c. The muffins had just the right amount of sweetness and are super tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good!  I loved them, hubby lovved them, and my coworkers loved them.  Instead of pumpkin pie spice, I used cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used a whole small can of pumpkin, which I think made them really, really moist.  Also for the streusel topping, I used brown sugar instead of white.  The first time I made them I chopped my apples pretty chunky style, second time around I chopped them in my food chopper - I definitely liked the chunky style better.

Good.  Used all whole wheat, 1.5 cups of sugar, extra pumpkin, 1/4 cup flax, and 1/4 applesauce instead of the entire oil.  Kids ate them, which is important.

I followed the directions exactly (except cooking time) and even added a cream cheese filling, but they were a little on the dry side for me and my family. I cooked them for 30 minutes and I feel like it was about 5-10 minutes too long. Maybe that's why they were dry. I also thought they were a little bland. I probably could tweak it, but I think I will just try some different recipes. They're not horrible, but not the best either.

Easy and tasty recipe. Like most folks, I tweaked as I went (and accidentally set the oven too hot!). Other than some burnt bottoms, the muffins were moist and taste like autumn!

Great recipe, super moist.  Added an additional 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice along with 1/2 tsp cinnamon, like it spicy.  Also, I did not top the muffins, thought that might be a little over the top caloricly.

Delicious! Very moist, tender and not too fatty muffins. Being on Weight Watchers, I am in a constant search of relatively low-fat recipes that would satisfy my cravings for baked goods. These muffins definitely hit the spot! I used the "Change Servings" function to make just six muffins, and it worked very well! I also used brown sugar instead of white, and decreased the amount of sugar in general. The muffins came out with just the right amount of sweetness, and the streusel was a great addition. Will definitely be making them again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These are great and my kids loved them- very moist!  Only complaint is that they are too sweet (and I LOVE sweets!).  Next time I'll cut 1/2 cup sugar.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, added ground flax and raisins.  I didn't do the streusel topping because I was lazy and just sprinkled with turbinado sugar. Will definitely make these again!  Thanks!

Very good muffins except as usual with muffin recipes, I cut the sugar in half and it's still plenty sweet.  Also, I wasn't quite sure how much "1 can of pumpkin puree" was because here in Canada, there are  different sizes of canned pumpkin puree.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and I have to say that these were good, but not amazing.  I don't think there was enough "spice" in them... pumpkin anything needs a good dose of spices to really offset the flavor, and I don't think the 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice does that here.  I am always hesitant to use pumpkin pie spice anyways, rather than mixing my own, and in this case I wish I'd used spices more akin to what you would use in pumpkin bread. I think cloves would add a wonderful touch to this recipe.  Other than that, they baked up fine and the streudel was delicious.  I didn't have a problem with sweetness like some others said, but I enjoy sweet things so that may be why.  I thought they were just barely sweet enough.

All in all, I would make again using the same base recipe but switching out the spices for pumpkin bread spicing instead.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1 T cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp clove, and 1/2 tsp ginger.  I used granny smith and left the peel on.  I didn't have enough cinnamon, so I substitued nutmeg in the crumb topping, and added chopped pecans to the batter.  I wouldn't change a thing from this variation.  Muffin was moist and flavorful

Best muffin recipe ever.  Excellent! Made these twice.  Once according to the recipe, and the next time I tweaked it. Changed:  Cut sugar to 1 C, added 1/2 C chopped pecans, 1 full can pumpkin, generous on the spices, no streusel, & used 2 heaping cups of chopped apples.

VERY good muffins! Great muffin texture, wonderful flavor and very moist! I made the muffin part exactly as printed. But for the streusel, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, added about 1/4 c. chopped pecans, and used about 1 1/2 times the amount of ingredients the streusel called for. Perfect!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Overall, these are pretty good muffins. I did notice that mine were done after 25 minutes, so watch your cooking time. I think they could be improved by adding extra pumpkin or spices, as others suggested.

SO GOOD!  I used a whole small can of pumpkin instead of just 1 cup, and 3 teaspoons sweetened applesauce instead of the apples (I don't like chunks), then I doubled the streusel recipe - delicious!

Delicious!  Made them with the intention to freeze the leftovers for quick breakfasts, but none of them were left to go in the freezer!  Hubs and I ate them so fast--they were sooo good!

Great muffin - moist and flavorful - but the streusel topping was very messy before and after baking.  The sugar granules didn't stick.  I will make these again, but omit the topping.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1/2 cup additional pumpkin and also added 1/4 cup ground flax seed.  They were moist and I though perfectly seasoned.

I almost couldn't wait for them to cool enough to try!  I subbed homemade pumpkin puree for canned pumpkin (shortage of the canned, and it's surprisingly easy to do yourself!). I also eyeballed the spices and went heavy, as I prefer spicier pumpkins. I used Granny Smith apples which are tart and juicy. I also didn't do a streusel topping because I personally hate streusel. Uck.  Overall: I'm keeping this recipe and using it again and again. So tasty!

I did not have the same reaction with my family as others here did.  The apple seemed lost and you couldn't really taste it.  They were not sweet at all, which some people mentioned. I followed the recipe exactly.  They were "okay" but I don't think I'll be making them again.

I love these muffins!  They are fantastic.  I used whole wheat flour and substituted one cup of brown sugar, because I only had one cup of white.  Likewise, brown sugar was used for the topping.  Otherwise, I had a 2C. frozen bag of pumpkin puree that I used because I could not find the canned in the store at this time of year.  I was skeptical to double the pumpkin, but it seemed to need the moisture.  It cooked fully through in the 40 minutes, and they are wonderfully moist.  Yum!

Super yum!  I doubled the recipe and used applesauce instead of oil, 2 c. white flour and 3 c. wheat, subbed about 1 1/2 c. honey for the sugar, and also added about 3/4 c. splenda (this was PLENTY sweet.  I only added the splenda because I had some lying around that really needed to be used up).  I didn't quite have enough apple but I added some extra applesauce and it was great!  Will make again for sure!

Really yummy! We cut the apples in chunks and they were delicious to bite into! Used mostly whole wheat as well (as usual with most recipes) and cut the sugar in 1/2 and the muffins were just great. Could have been a tiny bit sweeter but my kids still loved them.

These are GREAT!! I did make small changes based on my families preference(I don't like PP spice). I always make a double batch with 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce, 1-1/2 tsp nutmeg, T cinnamon, 1 extra cup sugar for the double batch(we like sweet) and fresh pumpkin(I don't used canned-the trick to fresh is to put it in the blender or food processor after baking to avoid stringiness).  I have made it with steusel and with plain raw sugar on top, both are great!! Just depends on my mood for the day ;)

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe ingredients list exactly and couldn’t be happier with the results.  My muffins were soft, tender, fragrant, and had high, beautiful crowns!  Here are some tips to help you achieve great results:  First, I used fresh, green Granny Smith apples.  I always bake with tart apples so that the final product doesn’t come out too sweet.  They complemented the pumpkin wonderfully.  I filled my muffin cups nearly all the way to the top and used muffin liners for easy extraction from the pan.  Rather than making 18 muffins I made 12, plus 2 mini loaves to give away to friends.  I took the muffins out of the oven at 25 minutes but left the mini loaves in the full 35.  I lightly greased the mini loaf pans and the bread came out with no sticking.  One more thing, make sure that your spices are fresh.  Some reviewers stated that their muffins didn’t have enough spice flavor, but perhaps the spices were just old.  They lose their potency over time.  Happy cooking!

I used half the amount of sugar, whole wheat pastry flour, half oil and half apple sauce, and used honeycrisp apples.  Delicious and a little more healthy.  I didn't need the streusel topping.

Very yummy! I took suggestions from others and used applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 c sugar instead of 2 cups, and also skipping the streusel topping.  Took them to work and they were gone before noontime!  I will make them again!

Wonderful!! I goofed at the store and bought "pumpkin pie mix" instead of pumpkin puree so I had to go easy on the spices, but they still came out great! I did use extra of the mix. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of white. Baked for about 25 minutes and were PERFECT. Great recipe!

After bringing back a whole bushel of apples this past weekend from a family apple-picking outing I looked high and low for different ways to use them.  I was SO please with this recipe!  I never really thought to add apples to anything with pumpkin, but it is a wonderful fall mix.  These muffins turned out extremely moist and the streusel made them just perfect!  Next time I may use more apples though!  I'm going to give some to my neighbor and make some more for my family!  Yum!

Great, easy recipe.  I made this recipe as loaves and cooked about 50 mins.  I made one batch with apples and one with raisins.  For the apple one, I made the streusel topping but took the sugar for it out of the sugar that went into the batter.  I also substituted apple sauce for the oil and brown sugar for half of the sugar.

I thought these were yummy and unusual. Everyone liked them. Personally, I liked the apples chunkier, the first time I cut them too fine.

I really enjoyed these muffins. The pumpkin/apple flavor combination is great. The kids weren't thrilled with the chunks of apple, though. Maybe next time I'll just substitute applesauce for the oil and forego the chopped apple.

Made these for my family and was asked to make again.  They don't stay long.  Made again for our church Sunday morning cafe. They sold so fast. Great recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

4.5 stars.  Love both pumpkin and apples - a nice blend of fall flavors.  Next time, I may shred the apple or else chop up smaller because I made it a little too chunky the first time around.

These are very good.  I made mini muffins because I wanted fewer calories per serving, and it's easy to pack a couple in my lunch each day.  Will make these again!

Great recipe. I left off the streusel topping and used 1/2 of whole wheat flour for a slightly healthier recipe.

I gave this 3 stars only because I used another muffin recipe(country pumpkin muffins) but I used the Streusal topping part on the other recipe and it was great!!! I made these for a Thanksgiving brunch we had and the family absolutely loved them!!! The only reason I didn't just stick to this recipe is because I'm not a big fan of the apple and pumpkin taste together but the Streusal topping part sounded so yummy!

Delicious muffin, I didn't change anything. They were just out of the oven when my daughter came home from school and she and I tried them for the first time. She immediately had a second. Thanks for a good recipe. By the way, since this only uses 1/2 can of pumpkin you could either make a double batch of muffins and freeze some, or try the "Pumpkin Cookies V" like I just did, with a caramel icing, wonderful!

I made the recipe as written. They turned out great. I loved the apples even though their flavor was very mild. I mixed in candied pecans and sprinkled some on top too.

It seems this recipe is great but maybe I did something wrong because my muffins came out small and very dense. I did reduce some of the sugar and used half brown and half white sugar, added chopped pecans and brown sugar in the topping. The taste was good but the texture isn't what I was expecting. I might have over-mixed the batter and that's what made them chewy instead of fluffy. Better luck next time!

These muffins are wonderful! I used fresh pumpkin that I baked earlier in the day, and the muffins had a very healthy taste to them (although I'm sure they aren't). The recipe made 22 medium sized muffins.

I thought these were okay. I made them per the instructions and tasted a little bland and on the dry side. I do like having the apple chuncks in there and my daughter really enjoyed them. Will make again and try making a few tweeks to the recipe to our liking.

Make sure to fill the muffin cups to the top; these don't rise very much.  Delicious, very moist.  I skipped the steusel because I ran out of sugar.  I doubled the batch & had to substitute half of the white sugar for light brown.  (Who keeps four cups of sugar around?!  Haha.  Beginner's mistake.)  Still came out great.

I'd really give these 4.5 stars, if that were an option.  They're very good, and my husband loves them, but I wish the streusel topping were more crumbly.  Mine ended up as a fine powder-like coating that melted together to form a sugary crust on top of the muffins.  I also learned the hard way that muffin liners are a must.  The moist apple chunks (which are great!) prevent a firm crust from forming, making it hard to release the muffins in tact without a liner.  I substituted oat bran, wheat germ, and wheat flour for some of the flour -- still tasted great.

These muffins are great!  I used whole wheat flour - it doesn't have any negative effect on the taste, and it gives them a nice texture.  I also reduced the sugar to one cup, and added 1/2 c. honey, and substituted yogurt for the oil. Fresh pumpkin is better!  After those alterations, these were healthy and delicious.  No reason not to make them a little more healthy, and they come out great every time.

I have made the recipe twice and everyone has loved them.  Used substitutes like many others:  1 cup of whole wheat w/ 1.5 cup of white flour, apple sauce instead of oil and 1 cup of brown sugar w/ 1 cup white sugar.  I was able to get two recipes out of 1 can of pumpkin.  This will be a fall favorite from now on.

These are excellent when they are fresh.  I don't like them as much after a day or two, but they are great again when frozen.  I make some healthier changes: I use 1 cup wheat flour plus 1 1/2 cups white (I might up that in the future), I use 1/4 cup oil plus 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and I use 1/4 cup Egg Beaters plus one egg.  I think I may have put in more than 2 cups apple because I forgot to measure and I ended up with 24 muffins.  I also left the apple chunky.  Everyone at church loved these!

Superb I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose. I used baby squash pureed instead of canned pumpkin and it turned out marvelous. I will add it to one of my favorites!

We really loved these! I used fresh pumpkin that I puree. I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Other than that I followed the recipe. My picky 4 year old couldnt get enough of these. Wonderful way to kick off the fall season!

I love baking pumpkin recipes in the fall and this one will definitely be on my list of favorites!  The apples add such a great compliment to the pumpkin and the whole combo just screams autumn!

These were wonderful!! my husband and my daughter loved them... they were moist, flavorful, and yummy.  i will definitly make them again.  the only thing i did not care for was the topping i think i will modify it next time.  but it might have been my fault it didn;t turn out right.  i would definitly recomend it.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed it exactly except that I used 1 and 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree and only used 1 cup of apples instead of 2 cups. 2 cups would have been way too much. This recipe was not sweet and not tasty at all. The muffin batter was really thick, so I don't know if I could have done something wrong-but like I said I followed it exactly. The streusel topping was a disaster! It never turned into crumbs. I'm so disappointed and mad, because now I have to stay up half the night making something else to take to the playdate tomorrow.

These are delicious muffins! I love the unique combination of apples and pumpkins. I used Granny Smith apples, and it was the perfect taste. I followed the recipe exactly, and my family was very pleased with the results! Thanks for sharing.

Substitute 1/4 of oil with pumpkin - except put in another 1/4 cup by mistake. Decrease sugar to 1/2 cup Splenda and 1 cup sugar. Added flax seeds and oat bran. To make it healthier. :)

Next time around, I'm going to reduce the sugar to 1 cup. Was still a bit sweet.

These were excellent!  The only change I made were substituting half of the flour with whole wheat flour, and I added finely chopped walnuts to the streusel.  Next time I will use more pumpkin and cut back on sugar as suggested by other reviewers.

I have added wheat germ, cut back on sugar to 1 1/4 cups, using a mix of white and brown sugar, reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and increased the pumpkin by 1/4 cup, and increased the butter used in the struesel.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp ground cloves and a bit of fresh nutmeg.

This was an amazing recipe as the muffins were moist and tasty.  I wanted them to taste more like pumpkin than apple based on the other reviews, so I added only one cup of chopped apples and I thought the pumpkin taste was prominant.  Delicious recipe.

These are really nice muffins.  I made them exactly as listed, except used brown sugar for the topping instead of white.  They're a little on the sweet side, and not too strong of a pumpkin flavor, but everyone who had them loved them.  The recipe made 24 muffins for me, and they took about 22 minutes to cook.  I'll definitely make them again, probaby again at Thanksgiving time.

This is a great muffin recipe.  I substituted whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup more pumpkin for more fiber, and the muffins were great-tasting and very moist.  Kids and adults both loved them!

I made these for a 4th grade pumpkin celebration & doubled the batch so I'd have some leftovers for us.  Cutting up all of the apples added to my prep time but it was worth the effort.  They are on the sweet side and my kids have been enjoying them as snacks.  I made mine with 1/2 all purpose 1/2 whole wheat flour and they came out great.  My child reported that all of the muffins she brought to school were grabbed and loved by her friends.  The left overs were even better on day #2.

Maybe it is  my oven but the bake time seemed off. My muffins were done in about 25 minutes. Even being slightly over baked they were tasty and I will make again.

Way too oily.  The oil sank to the bottom and the paper cups were soaked!  It does have good flavor.  Think I'll try substitute half the oil with apple sauce as some have suggested.  Oh, make sure your apple chunks a pretty good size or they'll disappear when baked.  I tossed mine in a litte flour and brown sugar (like making an apple pie) before adding them to batter.

I made these this morning for breakfast.  They were very good, but something was a bit off.  I want to try making these again using brown sugar instead of white, and see if that was it.  It lacked that warm, homey flavor you want in a pumpkin recipe.  Just a bit too sweet.  Aside from that, it was the perfect balance of chewiness on the inside, and crispy crunchiness on the top!  I may even make these for Thanksgiving breakfast!

Nothing truly spectacular, but a good basic muffin recipe and versatile enough to handle the changes I made: I used 2 cups of fresh cooked and pureed pie pumpkin, an extra 1/2 cup of flour, and an extra egg white, only 1/4 cup of oil. and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar instead of the 2 cups of white, individual spices (2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. nutmeg, and a dozen or so crushed buds from whole cloves) instead of pumpkin pie spice, and I added splashes of lemon juice and vanilla to add some perk and richness.  I doubled the topping but there was really no need--it's good and I wouldn't leave it out because it's attractive and adds interesting, but it's not the kind of topping where more is better.  With the changes I made, I got 12 muffins (done in 25 min) and a regular loaf pan (done in 45 min).  They're moist and flavorful, not too sweet for breakfast (and wouldn't have been sweet enough without the topping, but I did decrease the sugar and increase the pumpkin and flour).  If I make them again, I'll probably use whole wheat pastry flour, add raisins soaked in orange juice to the batter and add toasted walnuts to the streusel--that might be a five star muffin!  Also, if I don't add more pumpkin and flour, I might take the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups because they were just the right sweetness this time.

Very good! The flavor of fall. I liked the crispiness on the outside and the moistness on the inside.

These were very good and moist.  I cut down on the sugar and it was still good.  Definetly tasted more like apples, couldn't really taste the punpkin but they were delish!

The kids loved these..they were tasty and moist. I changed a few things after reading comments: reduced sugar to 1 cup sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar; instead of 2 eggs = 1/2 cup egg beaters; instead of pumpkin spice I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1 tsp vanilla.

Really awesome muffins. So easy to make. My only warning is to watch how long you bake them. 35 minutes is way too long. 25 minutes was perfect for my oven. They are a real tasty treat!

Thank you for the recipe and all the useful advice from the reviewers.  I did not have any pumpkin pie spice so I used the substitution provided by “boringmama.”  I also decided to make it in a bunt pan and used to cooking suggestions of “chefjeff.”  I put the streusel topping in the middle and drizzled a vanilla glaze on the top after baking.  Of course, I also added some diced walnuts to the streusel topping, because I love nuts in just about anything. It was beautiful and yummy.  Perfect for a weekend family treat.

I made this recipe into a bundt cake which turned out delicious. It baked for 45-50 minutes. The only change I made was to cut the sugar down.  Everyone asked for the recipe and I will be making it again.

I made this for a work breakfast party and everyone loved them.   People even asked me to the recipe!  I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but thought with this being the pumpkin season I would make something festive.  I didn't change much, just added more pumpkin spice and apples and doubles the streusel recipe.  But that was just a personal preferance because I like it extra sweet.  I also made these the night before and they were still so moist and yummy the next day, I will make these again :)

Absolutely delicious! I used real pumpkin instead of canned, and went heavy on both the pumpkin and apple. For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white, and added some oatmeal. They came out perfect - moist and yummy!

They were a little TOO moist for my taste.  Next time I will use less oil I think.  After a day of sitting, they tasted raw because the muffin was so wet.

I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and apple sauce in place of the oil as suggested. These came out very good, nice and moist, do not seem low fat. I did not make the topping. I am not sure if I didn't use enough batter for each muffin but I only had to cook mine for about 25 minutes.

I love these muffins.  They are a little work to make, but they are always a hit.  Whenever I make these and bring them to work they are devoured within minutes, followed by requests for the recipe.  This is a definite keeper

This definitely my favorite muffin recipie now! I did make a few modifications though. Instead of a cup pumpkin, I use a whole 14 oz can, and I substitute cinnamon applesauce for the 1/2 cup oil. It tastes wonderful!!

Delicious! I made these on Christmas morning and they were a big hit. The amount of pumpkin pie seasoning is just right to add flavor without being overwhelming. I ended up filling 18 muffin cups, and also a tin of mini-muffins. I will definitely be making these again!

Very moist, not too overwhelming on the pumpkin.  Left the apples a little chunky, which everyone enjoyed.  Made them in the oversized muffin pans and they turned out great.

These muffins were done in less than 20 minutes. My only change was adding half a cup of whole milk to thin out the batter.

Fantastic!  I used the strusel recipe suggested by another reviewer, but they would probably be amazing w/o it. 

The batter is very thick - so don't worry.  The apples keep it moist.

These are great muffins.  I like them better after they cool off.  And my 4 yr old son and I did 1 cup apples and 1 cup raisins.  I really like how moist they are, perfect with coffee.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh so very good! The batter is thick, but resist the temptation to add more liquid. It turns out fine as written. As far as the topping goes, pay attention as the recipe calls for 4 teaspoons of butter. I suppose if you put in 4 tablespoons, it would be too much. Thank you Jan!

These helped my craving for some "fall" flavored food.  I did make some changes to make them healthier for my kids.  I used honey instead of sugar in the batter, half whole wheat flour, and applesauce instead of oil.  My kids liked them and I like warming them up a little before eating them.

These were good!  My 3 year old son and I made these this afernoon and sent them over to a new neighbor.  The streusel topping adds a bakery taste and look, and the apples are a nice addition to a favorite bread in this house...pumpkin spice.  Thanks Jan!

This is a fantastic recipe. I will defenitely make again and again. I didn't have pie spice, so I used 1 tsp cinnamon and pressed about 2 tsp of fresh ginger root to substitute. Used about 1 and 1/3 cups sugar which was very sweet, would not use more. Also used full 15oz can pumpkin and two medium apples chopped but not pre-baked. These came out perfect. Streusel was a nice touch.

I made these for my sons lunches.  But substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 of the cups of all purpose flour.  They are delicious - but a little too sweet for me.  I think I'll reduce the amount of sugar.  But a very moist, dense and flavorable muffin!

I liked these hot out of the oven the best.  Once they cooled, the muffins lost some of their yummy flavor.  All together a pretty good recipe.

These are awesome! I made them a day ahead to eat on Thanksgiving morning.  They were gobbled up right away.  I did however, use an entire small can of pumpkin and added a little more spice than the recipe calls for.  I have been told that I have to make them again for Christmas morning.

I tried these twice, both times they turned out horrible. Maybe its just my baking skills. I just found them dense and not very sweet. I wont be trying these a third time.

Incredible.  So moist and delicious.  My only change was to add a little extra pumpkin, but I'm sure the recipe is just as great without it.

This is a very moist, long-lasting muffin with plenty of flavor. After reading other reviews I too substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for a cup of all-purpose, as well as 1 cup of Splenda, 1/2 cup white, and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the sugar.  I also added a tablespoon of flax seed.  I'll make this again!

These were good, however, I think next time I will try cutting the pumpkin pie spice to 2 tsp. and add 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I think the flavor would be better.  Very good fall recipe.  Thanks!

These Muffins are great. I Love all things pumpkin and these were no exception. I did not use pumpkin spice I just used a 1/2 tsp or so of ginger cinnimon and all spice. They are moist and an awesome flavorand they made the house smell great all day. I will make them again and serve to friends and family.

I followed several suggestions and made it as a cake, but it's definitely too heavy and dense to be a cake, or even a regular muffin.  It's much more like a bread.  The taste was good though.  It was very moist, as others have pointed out, so I finely diced the apples and pre-baked them in a shallow pan at 200, for about 1/2 an hour, then I "squeezed" the juice out with a sieve.  This adds a lot to the prep, but it prevented any mushiness that I read about in other reviews and my cake was nice and moist.  Next time I will bake it in a loaf pan and serve it as a pumpkin bread.

Wow - what a lovely little taste of Autumn. Will definitely make these again. As per others suggestions, I used light brown sugar instead of white for the topping. Worked out nicely.

Really delicious & moist (not soggy).  I made them into mini muffins & gave them to my son's teachers for Thanksgiving.  The only changes I made were to use 1 cup applesauce & 1 cup finely chopped apple. Also, sprinkled tops with cinnamon sugar instead of streusel.  Will trying making it as a bread with the leftover pumpkin.

Loved this recipe!  I made exactly 18 muffins and followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and diced the apples very fine.....they came out moist as she said..definitely not soggy.  The first 12 came out of the oven roughly 20 minutes ago...there are only 5 left and there are only 3 of us here!  This recipe will be printed and placed in my recipe binder for sure, thanks for sharing!

I made these for teachers at my daughter's preschool- I got no complaints, but I have to say I wasn't extremely impressed - I was prepared for a muffin that would blow all others out of the water. Maybe it's just my tastebuds...

The best muffins I have ever made!  My husband, 9 year old, 6 year old and even my 1 year old can not stop eating them.  This is all the best things of Autumn baked into a muffin.  Thanks for the recipe!
