This was really yummy and easy to make, but I feel the amount of flour and corn meal should be way less.  I tried to use as much as possible but only so much will stick. I had a ton left over with six 2 oz. fillets,  but the breading was just the right thickness and super crispy.  My family loved it too!

This recipe was very tasty but it all broke a part in the pan when I flipped it.  Mine turned out to be "chopped breaded fish" my fault on the devastating flip but indeed a tasty and great recipe.

I adjusted my Serving Size to reflect 2 Servings, versus the Original 4 Servings, and the Dry Ingredients were adjusted lower.  After dipping my fresh Atlantic Haddock, which I cut into serving size pieces, into the Egg White I had no problem getting the Dry Ingredients to stick.  We liked the Tasty Outer Coating and the way it Browned up very nicely.  The trick is to use good, and fresh, Vegetable Oil and to heat this up at a high temperature (and cover the pan while cooking).

This is a great recipe! I made a couple alterations, but am confident that I'd get a great result without them. Mine were using the whole egg, not just the whites. I used milk instead of water, and let the fish soak in the egg/milk wash for about 5 minutes. I also added onion powder and paprika to the dry mix--which for me was einkorn flour and milled corn. The batter stuck to the fish, and cooked up nice and crispy. My husband loved this, and we will likely stick to this one from now on!!!!

This was a very easy recipe, and the fish was delicious, flaky and crisp, without too much coating.  I will make this again for sure!

Delightfully simple - a crunchy and subtle pedestal to show off the flavors of the fish. I used tilapia and left out the salt, it came out great!

My mother used to make this when I was a kid! She also added fried onions and hot crushed peppers cooked together then added to the fish. Delicious !
