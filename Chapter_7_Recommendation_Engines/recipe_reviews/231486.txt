Omitting the brown sugar still made comfort food at it's best!  Because of using custard cups, I baked my puddings in a pan of water.  After 90 minutes, I turned off the oven, and left the puddings in a closed oven for the next 1/2 hour.  That was plenty of baking time!  Wonderful recipe---made on the day my wild roses bloomed out!

Made this exactly as is.   Needed a Native American recipe and this seemed more authentic than the other recipes I had seen and seemed a little more special.  I was so glad I made this.  It was surprising how good it was.  It had such a great warm flavor without feeling to heavy.  This would be great as a change up from thanksgiving pies or just when you want something warm and familiar for the fall season.  I would also recommend this to go along with be a thanksgiving or fall breakfast.  Will be making this again.

Just made this recipe for the first time this year. Not my Grandmother (Greenleaf) Whittiers family recipe from the early 1800's. hers was a stovetop recipe with pearl tapioca. Probably lost to the ages.

Made this for Thanksgiving and I added raisins to the batter, and walnuts on the top when there was an hour left to bake.  It was a big hit and some guests asked for this recipe which I was more than happy to forward to them!

I've loved Indian Pudding since I was a little kid. We got it in a can to take home or as a regular serving from Howard Johnson restaurants/motels. This recipe is delicious and better than what I remember the other to be!!!! Easy-peasy to prepare - the hardest part is simmering the milk and cornmeal until thickened, only because it takes so long. What a Thanksgiving dessert! Hot or cold, with or without a bit of cream or ice cream on on top. I use the ginger & cinnamon as called for, then put about 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in as well. (The pie spice contains cinnamon and ginger plus allspice and a  couple of other things.) It's fabulous! I start sampling it for "doneness" right out of the oven...

I didn't use all the brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Next time I'm going for all molasses and maple.

My Aunt used to make this with raisins. I added them and this reminds me so much of "the good old days"' delicious.
