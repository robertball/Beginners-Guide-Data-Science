I used dried, pitted figs instead of fresh, and sprinkled pre-sliced almonds on top, and it was still absolutely tremendous! Plus, it was only a matter of minutes to prepare and a breeze to serve.  This will definitely be a new "go to" recipe!

Don't plan on this recipe before you find out if figs are in season. I used dried, but I'm sure they tasted nothing like they were suppose to. Who knew figs weren't available all the time....

This is simple and delicious.  The only goat cheese I could find was sweetened - with honey.  It all worked well together.

I always sprout almonds before cooking with them - that is, I wash and soak them in water and a dash of sea salt the night before, then rinse before using.  This makes the almonds creamier and tastier!

I forgot to put use the balsamic vinegar on but I recieved complements on these "gourmet appetizer" at the wine and cheese party I brought these to! I also used plain goat cheese because that was what I could find. I will be making this again!

So easy! The figs are in season right now so this recipe was a timely find. I took these to a party and everyone was raving!  Salted almonds work best. They travel well, too! Now my favorite recipe!

Heavenly.  Our tree produces very big figs, so I needed more goat cheese.  I had a Late Harvest Reisling Vinegar that I used in place of the Balsamic.  So easy and just outstanding.

These were just ok for me and my party-goers.  You must really love fig to be a fan of these.  I liked the concept but found the fig texture to be somewhat off-putting as did my guests.  The warm fig as a cracker was just sort of odd and unappealing.  I would make these again but I would make a fig spread instead and layer the remaining ingredients atop crostinis.  I also used a balsamic vinegar glaze instead of straight balsamic vinegar which people liked.

Simple, delicious,decadent and easy to make, I used sliced almonds and frozen figs I know that's why they came a little soggy so next time I'll make sure I use fresh, didn't have goat cheese  only plain feta so I had to make my own herbed feta using fresh herbs from my garden( basil, oregano and thyme) dried parsley and rosemary.I put it in a small bowl and mixed it into a paste with  the back of a spoon .They are so good Even my 3 1/2 yr. old like them! Thanks Christina for sharing your delicious recipe! Elvira Silva.

Simple and delicious - Costco had a large package of beautiful figs and I wanted to experiment - and luckily I had all these ingredients already on hand! Heating the figs brings out the sweetness, the goat cheese is nice and tangy, and the almonds add crunch. The balsamic and honey are a nice touch, too.

VERY, very yummy! A girlfriend of mines fig tree was overflowing so naturally she had to share. We had an abundance of fresh figs to eat and cook with. I just happened to have all the ingredients in house and made this as an afternoon snack for the kids and I. The taste is amazing. You have the sweetness from the figs which is cut by the tartness of the cheese. We used whole raw almonds and the broiling brought out its nutty flavor. Then topped with the sweet n sour combination of balsamic vinegar and honey. What a great combination of warm, lush, sweet, tangy, and a cheesy treat. The kids devoured it and asked for more!

I had some goat cheese & some fresh figs wanted to use them, glad I found your recipe, I think if the figs were not so ripe this would have been better, everyone enjoyed them anyway. Thank you for sharing

This got rave reviews at the dinner party I took it to.  I used sliced almonds instead of whole because I thought they would be a better fit texture wise.  I was able to take them quite a ways to the party in a thermal bag with a heated brick and then pour on the balsamic/honey glaze when I got there.

This was very easy and a really great combination of flavors and textures.  I had 8 rather than 12 figs, and didn't alter the amounts of honey or balsamic.  I went heavy on the herbed chevre (probably more like a solid teaspoon+), and used cashews, because we are not huge almond fans.  My husband wanted to know if there were any more when he finished his, high praise indeed.

I signed up JUST so that I could rate this dish. I am so hooked on it. The overall taste is like nothing I've ever had before. If you have fresh figs this recipe is a must try. I thought the honey wasn't necessary.

I ate something similar to this at a party so I was glad I found this recipe...so simple yet so divine!  I didn't use almonds.  Another twist would be to wrap some proscuitta around the fig...I would probably put it in the oven for a bit verses under the broiler though.

Made exactly as directed. Thought pretty bland and boring.  Same night also made the recipe with arugula and figs (and substituted  the pArmesean cheese with goat cheese) and it was a much bigger hit with everyone.

Delicious! Easiest thing in the world to make!
Used Marcona almonds and an herb chevre.
Served these at a party yesterday and totally forgot to put the honey/balsamic on. Didn't matter. Delicious without. (Will try to remember next time). 
 
Thank you! Amazing recipe.

Update: made again, this time with a black pepper chevre. Also good. Herb chevre maybe my preference. Remembered glaze this time! Very Nice! My 3 year old ate the black pepper chevre ones before we even cooked them! Yum!

These are heavenly. Made exactly as written. I set them up a few hours before the party and left covered in the fridge. I baked them once my guests arrived. Easy as can be and everybody was so impressed to have a "fancy" appetizer.

My husband an I just moved to house with a fig tree- loaded with figs. Last week I bought some Chipotle Chevre from the farmer's market, so when I saw this recipe i had to try it. It was the BOMB! The chipotle added a little kick to the flavor that we loved. The toasted almond on top added a nuttiness that really brought the flavors home. I ate 4 halves myself and don't think I need dinner tonight.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you for such a simple, delicious recipe.

A wonderful appetizer recipe. If you don't like figs, you probably won't like this but for us fig lovers, this is the bomb!

I really liked these, they were even better the next day after they'd soaked in the balsamic/honey sauce..just plopped them on top of my mixed green salad for lunch...

my husband is not fond of figs, however, and my niece is not fond of blue cheese....(I suggested feta to her which she likes)...

I'll still make them, though, they're so easy and so worth it!

We love these ingredients separately but together they really didn't work for us. Sorry to say. Easy to prepare though.

This was so easy and so delicious. This would be perfect for a wine tasting...or as an appetizer to a nice meal with friends! I used fresh, local figs, goat cheese, and honey from the market - the goat cheese was an "ash" kind and it still tasted delicious together with the figs. Yum!

This elegant and delightfully presented dish is a treat to serve and to enjoy as one hears the inevitable sighs and compliments of "Delicious!" The mixture of honey with the balsamic vinegar drizzle is an outstanding combination! Excellent! I highly recommend it!

I have a fig tree and have been looking for a simple recipe to use my fruit in an enjoyable way.   This recipe is the ticket. 
 I made it as indicated.  Didn't have Marcona almonds but regular almonds were great..  I baked it a little longer than recommended; perhaps closer to 6-7 minutes.  It was wonderful and well received.  Will definitely make again.

This was very popular.  Some notes: The  recipe should list  "salted" almonds, not just almonds.  Watch the almonds closely under the heat, so they don't get burned.

I used green figs as apposed to black.  I like all of these individual ingredients, but I don't really know that they helped each-other be something better than their parts.
