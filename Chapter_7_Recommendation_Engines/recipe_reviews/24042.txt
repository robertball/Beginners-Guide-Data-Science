How easy is THIS?!  As long as you have ice cream in the freezer you're set for a spontaneous dessert, since I'm sure most home kitchens generally have these few, simple ingredients on hand.  I used half and half rather than evaporated milk and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I did not add the nuts, preferring just a smooth sauce.  I served this over brownies and vanilla ice cream.  Delicious.  A very worthy use of a bag of chocolate chips!

This would have been 5 stars if I didn't add the nuts. They overpowered the chocolate sauce. I did only 1/2 recipe and got about 4 servings, so unless you eat a lot of topping on ice-cream, it is actually double the servings suggested. I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave on high for about 1 minute stirring after 30 seconds and then stirred in the rest of the ingredients. The sauce without the nuts reminded me so much of "Magic Shell." I did try it on some ice-cream and it firmed up some slightly after about 3 minutes. But, I can't ever get magic shell to the crack stage, because I am too impatient to! I wish this would have said pecans (optional). I may try to make again, in the future without them, and report back. Defintely a very rich ice-cream topping!

My husband said "definitely a 5!" The ingredients are so simple but the result is rich and chocolatey and addictive. I had never thought about mixing the nuts into the sauce--DUH--great idea! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of evap milk and added 1 tsp vanilla. The sauce doesn't harden like a crackle topping--it firms up nicely and is delicious. This will be a repeat at our house. Thanks for sharing Susan.

If I could give this more than five stars, I would. This is DANGEROUS. Everyone loved this. I did take Becky's suggestion and added 1 tsp. of instant espresso powder and it was an excellent addition. Either way, this one's a keeper. NOTE: Toasting the nuts for this recipe would really take this over the edge. I could see that toasted slivered almonds would be a good addition, too.

WOW!  This is GREAT!  The only thing I changed was adding about 1 tsp. of instant espresso powder as the chocolate was melting - it just deepens the chocolate flavor and does not add a coffee flavor.  Also, next time I will toast the pecans before adding them to the chocolate mixture.  MMMMMMM!!!

We do love this sundae sauce! We had a banana split party and this was a huge hit... my husband wants to eat it out of the jar!! It does sort of harden a bit on your ice cream... it is amazing!!

This is a great base recipe for a nice velvety chocolate sauce. I did add a couple of things:
 1 tsp. instant espresso powder
 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

Excellent flavor! Really easy! Thanks!!

As someone who grew up eating the original and loving it's delicate milky sweet flavor this was a HUGE disappointment!! Too cloyingly sweet. It didn't harden like gold brick eith.

this is yummy! I made it once with milk chocolate, once with semi sweet and then a combo...all times it came out thick and creamy and decadent! I think i will try white chocolate or butterscotch chips next.

A decent flavor, but did not live up to promise of hardening "as soon as it hits the cold ice cream." I'll keep looking for a Magic Shell stand-in that I can make at home.

THANK YOU! This is one of my fondest memories from my childhood.  P.S, we also have frenchies!
