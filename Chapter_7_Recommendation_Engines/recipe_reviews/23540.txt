So easy and delicious.  I can't believe how many people asked me how to make it.  I threw in a bunch of frozen raspberries to make it look prettier in the punch bowl.

Grandpa made these for me all the time as a kid. Now I made them for my kids. I agree with lovestohost, we like it best with cranberry pomegranate but we make it with the whole cranberry family. NOTE: You can make this with diet soda and unsweetened cranberry juice, too.

I remember drinking this as a kid all the time. I recently made this for a cookout my husband & I had and it was gone in the 1st hour! Everybody loved it & couldn't believe how simple it was.

This is awesome; I make it regularly w/all varieties of 100% cranberry juices (cran-pom is my current fav).  Cranberry juice is great for preventing UTI's, but I HATE it, so addling some diet sprite/sierra mist makes it taste a lot better.  And it gives it bubbles.  And I love bubbles.  I don't usually measure, though, just pour about 2/3's juice and 1/3 diet soda.  This would be a sneaky way to get kiddos to drink cran juices, too!

This is really good! You could really use any kind of dark colored juice for it! I will make it again! Thanks!

This is a delicious combination! I made enough for 1 serving. I did 4oz of 100% cranberry-pomegranite juice and 4oz Sprite zero. It strangely improved the flavor of both. I will definitely be making this again. I bet it would be great with gingerale to.

LOVED IT!!! I served this drink at my 2 year old's birthday party. Everyone loved it- children and parents alike. I used 7up. The soda softens the strong taste of the juice and is very refreshing. Now i have to fight myself to not drink it all the time! :)

this drink is very good! i was looking for cocktail ideas on the new years party ideas section of this website, and found this under the "mock"tail section. i really liked the name and decided to try it and add a little alcohol to mix & it was fantastic! i used sprite zero & added a lime wedge to it & a splash of vodka because thats what i had on hand and i loved it. i will be serving this drink every chance i get! thank you!

Such an easy and super simple idea. I added a lime wedge to spice it up a little.

Seeing this recipe made me smile... my grandmother's late husband had one of these every day at 4pm with some cashews, and called it his "cocktail." It made us kids feel really "grown up" to have "cocktail hour" too. :-) Making it for my Mother's Day party this year!

My kids love this.I made it cran-raspberry juice the first time, and it was a little tart for my son. so, I just make it with whatever cranberry juice flavor I feel like when I go to the store. It is very refreshing and very easy. Thanks for a great recipe.
