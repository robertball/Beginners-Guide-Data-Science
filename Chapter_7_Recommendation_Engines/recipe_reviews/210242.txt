OMG!!!!  Thank you JIF.  This recipe is AWESOME!  It is so quick to make....and tastes absolutely scrumptious.  I made it exactly as stated...I used the assortment of mixed nuts that my husband and I like.  I didn't try the cayenne pepper yet...but will  set some aside and sprinkle with pepper.  PS....The honey and nut cereal is made by Chex.

This is very good. I didn't have honey nut cereal so I used four cups Rice Chex. I used dry roasted peanuts instead of mixed nuts because that's what I had on hand. My family really enjoyed this.

Yum!  This was a hit with my kids for an after-school snack.  I had run out of vanilla and subsituted orange extract, which went well with the cinnamon.  And I added some brown sugar to the butter mixture, because I didn't have sweetened cereal - just used Chex.  I didn't put cayenne on all of it, because some of my kids wouldn't have liked that part.  But I did!
