I "hate" to be one of THOSE people who see a recipe and change most EVERYTHING about it but here goes.  I hope this helps someone?
I used 3 "medium" ripe peaces and cut into bite size pieces.  I used 1/2 c. of water and only 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch....a healthy "pinch" of nutmeg and used brown sugar instead of white and NO almond extract.  It was perfect with loads of fresh peach taste.  This recipe is a GREAT "base" recipe and sometimes that's more then you need.  THANK YOU SO MUCH for posting this!!  By the way....we used it on pancakes and will use the small bit left on ice-cream.

This is a great, simple, homey recipe. I use it on both French Toast and pork chops. I make  few changes -- If using sweet fresh peaches, I cut down the sugar to 1 Tbsp Splenda, use 3 cups fresh peaches instead of 1 cup, use a dash of cinnamom instead of nutmeg, and omit the almond extract (a personal preference you may not share). When making this for a dinner sauce, I add a splash of white wine to peach sauce as it boils down.

I think this will freeze OK, tho I haven't tried it yet. But sounds like a great way to preserve those wonderful, local, late season peaches into winter.

Very good! Aside from using frozen peaches, I followed the recipe. The sauce was very thick so I ended up adding more peaches (which were pretty juicy). We had this on waffles with whipped cream - and will have the rest with coffee cake. Thanks!

This was great as a topping for vanilla bean ice cream!  The only thing about the recipe I changed was that I used lemon juice instead of almond extract.

made this to put over an angel food cake.  It was a bit bland and almost too sweet, but still yummy.  Next time I wont put as much sugar in it and may put more peaches in. We served over the angel food slices and covered with whipped cream.

Great sauce for crepes or waffles.  I added a bit of cinnamon and a smash of peach flavored Vodka.    *Made this again and used brown sugar, no cinnamon and more peach vodka.  Let the vodka boil off so that only the flavour is left behind.

This recipe was good except that it was to thick so I had to add more water. I would cut the cornstarch in half down to 1 tablespoon (for two). I might also think of omitting the nutmeg, gave it an odd unexpected taste. I added Pecans as a toper to the sauce and poured it over Grouper Fish. Outstanding!

Flavor wasn't very good, and i had to add so much water to counter all the cornstarch since, it turned into goop. Overall, not a good recipe. If you're looking for something that tastes like peaches and is more like syrup than this is not the recipe for you!

The almond extract made the peach sauce taste kind of weird.  I'll try it without it next time.

This was great - but I made changes.  I didnâ€™t have cornstarch so I added a little lite maple syrup.  I also used thawed fresh frozen peaches.  I simmered all the ingredients for about 30 minutes while I cooked everything else.  This was great on whole wheat French toast.

This was really tasty.  It ended up being a little thicker than I wanted, so I added another 1/4 cup or so of water (next time I'll probably just cut down on the corn starch).  The almond extract adds the perfect touch.  Delicious!

Ah, so good. Not too sweet, great flavor of peach... it was great with crepes! I added some sliced almonds on the top. 
I made it with 2 peaches. I forgot to peel one of them, and it was ok.
When I was boiling the water/cornstarch mixture I thought it was too thick, but then it turned our ok. Love the taste. will make it agin. thanks :-)

A good sauce to serve with Belgian waffles and whipped cream!  I used white grape juice instead of the water and sugar mixture, and added just a touch of Splenda to sweeten it up a tad bit more.  I also added fresh mango.  My peaches were not very ripe, so I cooked them a long time to soften them up.  I think ripe peaches are the better way to go.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night with a few changes.  I used 1 tablespoon of corn starch, used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and vanilla instead of almond extract.  Then spooned it over vanilla ice cream.  It was out of this world delicious.  Next time I'm going to have to resist how good it smells and wait a little longer for it to cool down so I don't end up with melted ice cream again.

I've never made a sauce like this before. They only part of the recipe I didn't follow was the nutmeg and almond extract, simply because I didn't have either, or a suitable replacement. All other measurements and directions I followed to a tee. I love the kinda weird consistency and the flavor was AMAZING with buttered sweet biscuits I made to go with it. I can umafine this with all kinds of fruit.

Reduce the cornstarch to 1 1/2 TB, and watch it closely, it will boil down to a thick goo. It's supposed to--but 2 TB cornstarch to 1/2 c. water is too thick of a goo. I increased the almond extract as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. It is thick, as one reviewer noted, and I had to stir it while cooking so I wouldn't get lumps. I added more than 1 cup of peaches--probably more like 3. I did that both because I like more fruit and because I had 3 fresh peaches I needed to use up before they spoiled.  I just boiled the peaches for a minute, then the skin slid right off.  We enjoyed this over pancakes; thanks!

Fantastic!  I used only 1 T of cornstarch and had to add some extra water to improve the consistency as it was still too thick, but this was outstanding and incredibly easy for a sunday morning breakfast (I spooned it over buckwheat pancakes).

I think that this is a good base recipe, although I usually use a little more water and fruit for the same amount of sugar and cornstarch. I try and use equal parts white and brown sugar instead of all white. I like using chinese five spice instead of straight nutmeg and vanilla extract instead of almond. I have found that if I do these things, this recipe works well using ANY fruit. My daughter loves when I make this sauce using bananas! But I have also used strawberries, apples, peaches, blueberries and plums!
