This is a very good rub.  It's good to see that someone else shares my opinion that BBQ rub doesn't need to have sugar in it!

Yummy!  We made ribs today and this rub was great.  After I put it on the baby back ribs I stuck the ribs on a rack in the pan, put them in the oven on about 225 degrees and cooked them low and slow.  Once done,I generously brushed Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on them and stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes.  Great flavor!

The overall flavor of this was fine but WAY too salty for us.  It really overpowered all the flavors.  Sorry I really wanted to love this rub.

This stuff is the shizz! I'll admit to cutting the amount of black pepper in half but left the cayenne as written. I used it on boneless ribs and it permeated the meat really well. Chicken is getting this rub next. Love, love, LOVE! :o)

Cut wayyyyy back on the salt and used fresh, crushed garlic and fresh, grated ginger.  Good rub for spare ribs on the grill, but I do miss that touch of sweetness from a more-traditional rub that includes some form of sugar.

Great basic rub. The rosemary gives it that certain Je ne sais qua that  that makes it unique! I prefer less salt because of my blood pressure and I found half the salt to still produce nice flavor. Grinding the rosemary is key!

Good rub that is not salty and no sugar. I let the rub marinade on the ribs overnight and they were great! This is great on chicken also; love the seasoning blend.

Very good basic rub. Followed others advice and halved the salt. Will try on chicken next time.
