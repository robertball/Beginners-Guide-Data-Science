I am not going to badmouth this recipe too badly.  The idea behind it is fantastic, but the subtle sweetness of squash is what makes it a summertime favorite and the amount of sugar in this recipe blankets that natural sweetness in the squash with an overwhelming sweetness that makes this dish almost a dessert as is.  If you half or quarter the amount of sugar and maybe replace it with a little cornmeal, this fried squash is simple and amazing.  This way the sugar carmelizes and accentuates the squash rather than candy coating it.

Sounds good! I make something similar, except I dice the squash, dredge in cornmeal, salt, and pepper.  Then I fry in olive oil.  Delicious!  There are never any leftovers no matter how much I make.

I grew up in the south and this was a summer staple for us.  My favorite way to do it is to use dry pancake mix instead of the flour.  It adds a little extra sweetness without being overpowering.

I usually make fried squash the traditional southern way, dredging first in milk/egg mixture, then in corn meal. Tonight I was out of eggs, so found this recipe and it turned out nicely. While I still prefer my traditional version, I wouldn't hesitate to make this again for a change of pace.

Simple and tasty.  My garden squash are coming in quickly and needed a recipe that was quick to prepare.  Added a dash of onion and garlic powder to the flour.   However, sauteed in 1 tablespoon butter and 2 tablespoons of EVOO.

Very nice recipe.  I changed things a little by adding a little more salt and some pepper to the flour mix.  I also added a little paprika.  I used olive oil in a skillet and also used canola oil in a deep fryer.  The olive oil came out the best.  Lastly I topped my with some churizo.  The sweet and spicy play was amazing.  Good job on this one!

Excellent recipe, I just added salt and pepper to the squash before I dredged in the flour.  This is the way my mother made squash when I was a child.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

At first I didn't like this, but as the first batch turned to the third, then fifth, then eigth...We liked it.  I found that I needed to keep adding shortening.  I also cut the slices thinner and added cooking time to make it more crispy.  My husband loved this and so did I.  He preferred them dark brown, they were like potato chips!
I will say, when they sit, they get soggy so make them and eat them.  They really are great.  I will make again!
Thanks for the recipe!

This was YUMMY! I've done the salt/pepper/cornmeal many times over and thought this was a very nice compliment to the squash. I did cook mine longer than "golden brown" though, I liked it crunchy!  Being from the mid-west, I am not afraid to eat me some shortening!

I've always made these living in the south-leave out the sugar completely-you don't need it. Just cut thin & give squash time to release it's moisture-so flour will stick (not long at all) salt & pepper to taste before you flour), & then fry in a deep fryer in vegetable oil until golden brown.Drain on paper towel & eat while still hot-so good. I promise! You can use up your abundance of zukes & make zuke fries using this same recipe just cut into fry shapes & remove seed.

These are so good! It's not like eating squash at all, (in fact, I have to wonder if it negates the nutritional value of the vegetable, but at the same time, it's so good that I don't care) it's more like candy! I have done them twice and while we prefer them fried in olive oil, doing them in canola in the deep fryer is so much easier. I put the dry ingredients in a zip lock and coated the squash that way and then stuck them in small batches in the fryer for about 7 minutes, stirring them up about four minutes in. Also, I found that putting additional salt on them when they first come out of the fryer, brings out the sweetness. Really good reheated in the microwave for about 20 seconds, as long as they are caramelized nicely when you fry them.

It was ok.  I don't think I like the sweetness.  I might try fried squash again but make it more savory instead of sweet.

I'm putting this in my rotation. I love squash and this was so much easier than dipping in egg and getting your hands all sticky. I also decreased the sugar to 1/4c and instead of a pinch of salt I added 1/4 tsp and then salted them right when they came out of the oil. I fried them in a deep fryer and they turned out great.

I ended up having to tweak things so much that it was an entirely different recipe by the time I was done with it.  When I followed it exactly, we had mushy squash with a too-sweet grainy coating.  After frying one up, I added cornmeal, some more flour and salt, and double-dipped the squash in egg and the flour mixture, and got a nice, thick, crunchy crust that was perfect.  It was a good base, but definitely liked my version better.

Only 4-stars because of necessary changes.  It needs MORE than a pinch of salt.  I used 1/4 cup sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  On my first taste, I thought it was yucky and too sweet.  Then I salted it and that balanced the flavors and was just right.  After those two changes my family tried it and thought it was great and told me the recipe was a keeper.  Next time I will add more salt to the flour mixture.

This was very yummy!  We gobbled them up.  I did make some changes - some worked, some didn't.  I reduced to 1/4 c. sugar, and used a mixture of flour and cornmeal.  The batter didn't stick well though, so next time I will try dipping in egg/milk before I coat them.  Will definitely make them again though!  They were delicious!

I enjoyed this recipe but use a little cornmeal as well. I always add fresh ripe tomato slices, couple pieces of bacon and use mayo on the bread.  What a fantastic summer treat.

I will definately try this and also the other readers way with cornmeal.  I have fried the squash (diced) with diced zucchini, diced onions, salt and pepper and my family loves it this way.  So will try some new ways.

Good recipe.  I cut back the sugar by 1/2, and added 1/4 cup of cornmeal and a dash of kosher salt like a previous reviewer mentioned.  Was very good.

I agree with others that there is too much sugar in this recipe for my taste. I personally just cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and left the flour and the rest as is. I also found that leaving the chips in the pan longer and getting them nice and brown left them with a better crisper texture. After they cooled a bit, sprinkling some powdered sugar and Vietnamese Cinnamon really set off this unique and delicious little treat!

Very sweet and a great way to use up summer squash.  I used a mixture of cornmeal and flour which came out very nice.

Just didn't add any taste. More like oily little pieces of squash.

The way most of the reviews on here show, is a whole new recipe.  I think that changing anything would be to use brown sugar instead of white.  Otherwise, omitting sugar of any kind and adding other ingredients is a whole new recipe.  Just saying!

These were fantastic. Kinda stinks up the kitchen though with all that oil. Just make sure to try to slice the Squash pretty thin. My husband and I loved these.

Pretty good. Similar to how I make mine. I just use some margarine or butter in the pan and dredge just in flour and salt and pepper while frying in the pan. YUM.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I also made a batch extra crispy and didn't like that as much.

My family loved these! And a great way to use all those garden squash. Not low-calorie, but delicious!

I did not care for the sugar in it.  If I made it again, I would leave the sugar out.  I think it would be good without the sugar.

VERY tasty! It's the best when eaten fresh though, and not reheated later. I will want to make this again!
