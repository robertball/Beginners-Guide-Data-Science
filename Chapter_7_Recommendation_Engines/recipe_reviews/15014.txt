These are excellent!  Here are a few suggestions:
1) Use lower fat cream cheese - it cuts calories and tastes great.  Also, I didn't need two packages - one was probably enough. 2) Use a rolling pin to flatten the bread after you remove the crusts but before you cut it.  It will roll up much easier! 3) If you flatten the bread, you can cut each slice of bacon into thirds.  Don't be afraid to "stretch" the bacon out before you wrap it. 4) If you are looking to cut your costs or calories even further, you can cut each slice of bacon in half lengthwise before you cut it in thirds.

I made this recipe for a Bunco party I hosted early last week.  BIG hit!  They were gone before I could get everything on the table, with several attendees wanting the recipe.  I then made them as a snack treat/appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Again, a BIG hit!  My 9-year old nephew asked for more when they were gone, and asked that I make him is very own bag to take home with him when he left that upcoming Saturday.  My other nephew's friend who was in attendance asked for the recipe to take home to his mother.  Now...my friends have requested this to be made for 2 separate Christmas parties I will be attending during the month of December.  Sooo...I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Note: While making my nephew's "personal" order, the day after Thanksgiving, I was unable to find the Pepperidge Farm Sandwich Bread because my grocery store was out of it due to the holiday.  That bread makes a definite difference...a must!  Also, I spread the cream cheese spread on the bread slices BEFORE cutting the pieces of bread into 3 separate sections.  This just saved some time and made the process a little easier.  Thanks for an awesome, most unique appetizer!:)

Really good - super easy!  I cut the bread in half instead of thirds and I precooked the bacon in the microwave for about 4 minutes first.  Still took about 30-40 minutes to bake enough to get the bacon a little crispy but after that, they were gone!  My family loved them!

These are really yummy, if you love bacon, you will love these! I could not find the Pepperidge bread (I am in Canada, maybe they do not have here?) I just used plain white sandwhich bread and instead of making the cream cheese mixture I used Philly Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese, Yum!

So, I wanted to LOVE these, but actually found them to be quite bland.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  I made them for our family Christmas party and they were not a hit.  Everyone ate them, but no one asked for the recipe or clamored for more. They are freezer friendly and it was nice to keep the extras on hand for Christmas Day snacking.

I thought the ingredients in this were quite good, but, I didn't like the cream cheese spread warmed up. I loved it cold though as did my husband. I added sliced olives, green onions & mushrooms to the spread. I'm going to make this again, but I will put the spread on toasted bread squares then chill, then I will top with crumbled bacon and serve. Yum! I can't wait!!!

These took a little long to prepare but were very good. I used fresh garlic and they turned out delicious.

I used multi grain bread, cream cheese with chives, and peppered bacon (yum yum). I'll be trying different breads and flavored cream cheeses.

A delicious treat! I made these for a family Christmas party and they were gone in minutes!  I had to cook them longer than the recipe said to make the bacon crispy but everything went smoothly! It's a keeper!

Made these last night for New Year's Eve and they were delicious!  I added a little chive and spread the cream cheese on the bread before cutting into thirds. I used a pizza cutter to slice the bread.  Very tasty and family loved them. Thanks for great recipe!

Love this recipe! It is a hit everytime! Of course, like everyone else, I tweak it a bit to suit my taste.  I like to add a dash of dry ranch mix to the top of the cream cheese before rolling with the bacon. Also, for a less greasy version - try the precooked bacon...cook time is cut in half with a lot less grease!

My husband LOVED these - he ate most of what I made!  The best part is that you don't have to cook the bacon ahead of time!  Definitely want to use a lean cut of bacon or they could get soggy.

This was AWESOME...everyone loved it.  I followed some of the other tips: used garden veg flavored cream cheese, used rolling pin on bread, and 1/2 way precooked bacon to rid of extra grease, especially since I used thick cut bacon. These were all great time savers. Will make many times again...Thanks!

I really only needed one package of cream cheese.  Have a package left over which will do tomorrow with another pound of bacon.  I did not use a full loaf.  I played around with this and either cutting bread ahead and putting cream cheese on or putting cream cheese on and cutting were close to the same time.  Cream cheese tended to stick a little more when cutting so might be better to cut then put cream cheese on.  And I have made these tons of times and have been trying to prefect getting the bacon crispy without being a fatty chewyness. I elevated the bacon rolls above the pan so they did not sit in their grease.  It still seemed about same amount of time to get crispy which was like around an hour in at this temperature.  Though no matter how they turn out my family loves them even with a picky 37, 19 , 18 , 5 and 2 year old in the house!!

Some people loved them.. some thought they were okay.. I used lower fat cream cheese and mixed it w/ Garlic, Worcestershire sauce, green onions, salt and pepper. Spread it over the bread, cut it in thirds and then wrapped in bacon. Next time I'm going to try to use a better bread. I just used whole wheat. I think it will make a big difference.

These were excellent! They were a huge hit at our super bowl party...everyone was disappointed when they were gone. Just a note, I used thick cut bacon and I had to bake them for about 30 minutes. Half way through the bake time I dumped the grease because I didn't want the bread to soak up too much of the grease. Next time I will most likely use a regular cut of bacon. So delicious, if you love bacon and cream cheese, you will LOVE these!!!!

These are great!  My husband and I brought them to the office holiday party and they were a huge success.  We dressed up the cream cheese with diced green onions and roasted red peppers, and used rye bread instead of white bread for extra flavour.

my family loved them.i followed some of the suggestions.flattening the bread and spreading the cream cheese layer on the whole slice of bread and then slicing into thirds.only change i made was to season cream cheese with a half a pack of dry ranch mix instead of ingredients listed .it made it easy and tastey.

I read a poor review for this recipe that said it had no taste.  I have to disagree.  This was an extremely tasty appetizer. I found it to be very unique, although not very pleasing to look at, I'm not sure that I would serve it at a fancy party.

Wow, these were wonderful!  I was surprised, they didn't look like they would be that good during preparation.  I did cook them until the bacon was crisp.  They were a big hit and very easy to make

I made these for an early thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved them. My husband hinted that he would eat these for dinner if I was ever inclined to make them. I did a bit of experimenting since I never can follow a recipe exactly and found that the thick-sliced peppered bacon works beautifully. I also added some chili powder and minced garlic.

Tried this recipe out on a women's group that met at my house.  I prepared the roll-ups in advance (adding finely chopped green onions, mostly the green tops) and froze them.  It was very simple to pull them out on party day and have them hot and ready in a flash.  I ended up broiling them, however, to get the bacon crispy enough to suit me.  They were gobbled down and one by one, everyone there has now asked me for the recipe!  A hit!

Very tasty and delicious! My husband picked out this appetizer for Christmas dinner.  I thought that the cream chees spread was tasty on it's own, to be used on crackers or something!

I also used one cream cheese and two lbs. bacon. Probably because I bought the large loaf of sandwich bread.  They are delicious and freeze well too.

This was good, I couldn't get the cream cheese to spread easily.  I don't think I would make it again, just not my taste.  My company did enjoy it though.

These are delicious! I use very soft white bread (the kind that comes in the package with balloons) and after cutting off the crusts I use a rolling pin to flatten the soft bread.  I then cut the bread into thirds--long rectangles, spread the cream cheese mixture on the bread, roll them up and wrap with the bacon as said in the above recipe.  Again, these are so good!!

Just made this for our annual "Soiree" holiday oyster roast and got rave reviews from all the guests!  I'm a very unambitious cook, so I loved the simplicity that packed a good punch :-)

I like these.  The only thing I did different was to use crescent rolls, triangles cut in half lengthwise, precooked the bacon, mixed everything else together and then put about 1 teaspoon of the mixture on the larger end of the crescent and rolled up then baked until golden.

Everyone loved these!  They were said to have the taste of a "BLT" (obviously without the L&T).  I added finely chopped green onion, garlic powder & a bit of chopped fresh parsley.  I also cheated quite a bit & used already cooked bacon (from market day) so that cut down on the oven time & grease and I used "Iron Kids crustless bread to save in that area as well.  Thanks Austid!!

These are so addicting!  I followed other advice and only used 1 package cream cheese and added some onion powder.  I cut the crusts off Pepperidge Farm white sandwich bread, then used a rolling pin to flatten, spread with cream cheese and then cut into 1/3.  My 2yr old son loved the extra cream cheese on bread.  I ended up cooking for longer than suggested, closer to 30-40 minutes so the bacon crisps.  Cool to almost room temperature (they are not as good hot from the oven), and watch out.  We eat them as a late night snack, and then left overs for breakfast the next morning.  Yummy.

This is an awesome recipe!  There was plenty for all.  I made the roll ups and then froze them.  I defrosted them in a bag on the counter for about a half hour and then popped them in the oven.  They were awesome!  I recommend that you make a batch just to keep on hand in case of company.  :o)

Take your favorite dip mix (I used Chipotle) and mix it with the cream cheese.  I also used thick cut bacon at 350 (cook for 30 min) and Sourdough bread.  It was the hit of the pot luck, the entire batch was gone in 10 minutes

These are actually better than I expected them to be.  I used wheat bread and it worked out fine.  I also used pepper bacon which is delicious but was too thick to bite through easily.   Lesson learned - use thin bacon.

I personally would give this one 5 stars but because they sat around for so long and I pretty much finished them off I have to go for 4 stars.  I used the peperidge farms bread which honestly is a bit pricey and it still crumbled a bit while rolling up but luckily the bacon hid most of the damage.  I also found that cuting it in halves rather than thirds was much easier.  Also, i actually ended up throwing some of it away because I ran out of the spread....perhaps I was too generous?  Either way, I'm sure I'll make these again, even if I'm the one finishing them off.  :)

These turned out great. I didn't use Pepperidge Farm bread, which didn't seem to make a difference and I also added in a spinich and herb spice mix to give these a little more flavor. I served them at a party and everyone loved them.

I made this following others' suggestions of using flavored cream cheese and flattening the bread slightly.  I also cooked it for about 35-40 minutes to crisp the bacon.  The final product was truly dissappointing.  The bread and cream cheese just absorb all of the bacon grease during baking.  Tastes like lard wrapped in bacon.

INgredient combination was good.  I just used two tortilla's for each roll up....Spread cream cheese mixture on first one, roll up.  SPread mixture on next one...roll around the first one-then wrap with bacon.  It was great and the bread was nicely crisp too.  I did cook longer only for fear of undercooking bacon and it was still great!  Thanks for a great starter recipe

These were very easy to make, and I liked the fact that you could freeze them ahead of time.  My husband really liked them, but I thought that they lacked a certain something.  Maybe next time I may add some spices or chopped chili peppers or minced onion (haven't decided yet!)to the cream cheese mixture.  Because they were so easy, could freeze ahead of time, and were pretty tasty, I will definitely make them again.  Also, I had too much of the cream cheese mixture leftover!  I had four slices of bread left and not enough bacon.  Next time, I will buy two loaves of bread, and two pounds of bacon.  I will have bread and bacon leftover, but will use all of the cream cheese mixture. (I can use leftover bread for sandwiches, bacon for breakfast, but wasn't sure what to do with leftover cream cheese mixture??).  They're really nice to have a bunch in the freezer anyway.  I know this is long, but lastly, I found it easier to spread the cream cheese on FIRST, then slice the bread into thirds.

Very tasty. I used thick sliced bacon, so that will change how I do it next time. The other commenters were correct that thick sliced bacon should be partially cooked before wrapping the roll ups. I didn't do that and it took about 40-45 minutes before the bacon was cooked, so the filling ran out some and burned. After breaking off the burned part, what was left was delicious. Next time I will half cook the bacon before wrapping the roll ups and I expect they will be awesome. This recipe is going in my book to make as both appetizer and breakfast.

I personally wasn't really impressed with this. It seemed to be missing something, and I had a hard time getting the bacon crisped but not overdone. However, I tasted these fairly soon after they came out of the oven. I never got to taste them at room temperature because our party guests snatched them up so fast. So they must have been good. I'll try them again but may add some more seasonings to the cream cheese.

These were pretty good...an easy simple appetizer for a party.  I only used half the mayo suggested and they were perfectly moist.  A change I would make next time would be to use less biscuit dough.  Another reader suggested cutting each biscuit into fourths and rolling them out...that's what I'll try next time so they are more of a 'mini' appetizer.  Thanks!

This recipe was ok.  I followed it as reccomended.  I cut the pieces of bread in half instead of thirds, and gave it to my two boys for lunch (4yrs & 2yrs).  They liked it very much!  I don't know if I will make it again though.

Great recipe! I made these for two holiday parties and they got rave reviews at both.  I needed two packages of bacon per loaf of sandwich bread.
