We've made this pie several times.  It is always good and a holiday favorite. It has just enough chocolate to get a flavor of it without it becoming overpowering. We used it as an auction night at an "arts" (including culinary arts) night and it went for $12.00!

This pie is excellent! No one guessed it was made with Splenda instead of sugar. I had to make it a day in advance, so I served it cold. I can only imagine how good it would be if served warm....yum!
