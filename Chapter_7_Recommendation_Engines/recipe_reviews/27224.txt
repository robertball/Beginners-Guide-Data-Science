I had higher expectations for this considering all the seasonings going on here. It was not nearly as full-flavored as I thought it would be.  All I can say is that it was better than just plain cooked beans with nothing on them.

I made these beans for a dinner party and they were GREAT!  I made the dressing earlier in the afternoon and when first made, I didn't think I was going to like it.  Tasted bland. However, after a few hours of the flavors combining, it was very, very good.  The only thing I might do different next time is to halve the recipe.  I didn't need as much as it made.

A little too much onion and perhaps a little too heavy on the herbs...this just didn't turn out for me.  I love green beans and this was actually better cold than warm and perhaps it was because it marinated for a bit.  Not something I'd make again.

After my previous green bean disaster, I thought that I could make a recovery with this. As I was a little skeptical, I made the dressing for 2.  I liked it, but didn't even tempt to serve it to my picky family.  I think I would like it more so if it were cold, maybe hubby would also try it then.  Thanks A&A!!

The sauce was very flavourful but way too much oil it made the dish greasy and too high in calories.  I will make again but 1/2 the oil.  I let the sauce marinate for 4 hours.

For those who had too much "onion" taste... chop the white parts off and just use the green tops of the onions which are more mild in taste.

This is a great simple recipe that dresses up plain old green beans for a totally new taste! This is about the 4th or 5th time I've made it - both my husband and 3 yr old as well as myself love it! Also, I don't keep dry mustard on hand, so I just use regular or dijon and that works just as well!

This is delicious!!!  I did not have marjoram so I used fresh thyme in it's place.  I will make this again no doubt!!!  Even my 16 month old loved it. Thanks for a great recipe!!

So, I kinda estimated the amounts.  And I used dijon mustard instead of dry.  And I halved the oil and about doubled the lemon juice.  But it smells and tastes great!

this recipe is good, but not great considering all the spices which was somewhat of a disappointment.  i really thought this recipe had the potential to take center stage in the green bean department, but i have other more flavorful recipes i'll stick to using far fewer ingredients that come together beautifully for that WOW factor.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. It's a great combination of herbs, and I took the advice of other reviewers and let it marinate for a few hours. The flavor was perfect. I also used slightly less than the requested olive oil, and found that a little bit actually goes a long way! My beans are a little shiny in the flashed photo. Next time I will use still less olive oil and I'm sure they'll be better.

This was awesome! I added too much sugar by accident (a clump ell in) so mine was a little sweeter than I like, but if you use the right amount is should be perfect. This is good hot or gold.

Delicious!  I like green beans, but they are a little boring.  The dressing gives a great flavor.  My husband doesn't really like any vegetables, and he had two helpings.  I chopped a tomato to add before serving.  Yum.

Very tangy sauce--exactly what I wanted! I bought one of the 'steamer bags w/whole green beans' from the freezer section of the grocery store. I steamed the green beans in the morning and then poured the dressing over them and let the sit in the fridge for about 6-7 hours. I LOVE IT! Tangy and crisp...I've had similar tasting green beans @ a nice restaurant...but I do believe these were better! Ooooh and I didn't use as much olive oil as called for.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving once, and it worked out okay. I think it is a good concept overall, but the flavour is not quite right. Maybe I will try it again with less olive oil.

I'm sorry to say that this recipe was just plain awful! All it tasted like was olive oil and salt- I threw the dressing out before putting it on my green beans, and just kept to my old recipe- butter and dill.

Using the whole 1/3 cup of olive oil was unnecessary. I only used a couple of tablespoons. I only used a pinch of salt as we're watching our salt intake. I think this would have been better if I'd roasted the green beans and I'd omitted the sugar. It was good, but not great. I was hugely disappointed. If I make this again, I'll double the spices.

Whoever created this recipe must really love onions. I only used 2 instead of 6 for 24oz of fresh green beans, and we couldn't taste the green beans. If I were to make this again I would probably cut the onions down to 1 and double the garlic.

Wow! Definently not just a Thanksgiving dish ... we had a very yummy steak (marinated with Doreen's Steak Marinade, also on this site) and I needed a quick dish that complimented it and this was it! We even used the leftover dressing to dip our bread in!

I am saving this recipe.  i made some variations due to my ingrediants on hand as follows: I substituted garlic powder for the garlic, walnut oil in place of the olive oil and 1 well diced purple onion in place of the green onions.  It was just beautiful.  Next time I make this, I will dry the blanched green beans on a towel after cooling. Using the purple onion made the presentation beautiful.  I hope to hear what others think of the variations.  I also may try pecan oil.  :)  Joy Kee

Pretty good...definately easy.  I think letting the marinade sit for a while helps.

I left out the onions and used frozen green beans from my mother's garden, and they were still great! They were very tasty and a new twist on green beans. Highly recommend!!!

Beautiful addition to our Christmas table! I made this exactly as written with one addition: I added some diced roasted red pepper on top. Everyone enjoyed it! We ate the leftovers cold and found them equally delicious.

I have been trying various green been dishes for years to go with my family's Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve dinners in the off years when we have to travel an hour or more by car.  It's hard to bring a warm vegetable dish long distance and not have it end up overcooked or soggy. I like this because it is simple and savory, and the dressing can be made beforehand.  All you need to do when you get there is steam the already prepared beans.  I would like to tweak the spices, maybe trying fresh versions.  The olive oil, lemon, and mustard are a very workable base.

I liked this recipe but the second time I made it I tried out a variation, which everyone loved. Omit mustard, cut down olive oil to 2 tbsp., add 1 tbsp. sesame oil and 2 tbsp. light soy sauce. My boyfriend's two teenagers had three servings each!If you wish you can also add 1/2 c. toasted sesame seeds.

This recipe went over very well. I actually mixed in sugar snaps with the green beans. They were delicious!

This dressing is fantastic.  I won't make green beans without it.
