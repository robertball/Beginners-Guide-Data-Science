Made changes instead of butter I used blue bonnet. I added cardamom 1/8 teaspoon. I did not roll the whole cookie in sugar only stamped the top in the sugar. Came out more like a scone than a cookie but the hubby loved it.

II used fresh ginger and added about 4 tsp of it to the recipe. The cookies definitely smelled like ginger but didn t taste much like it. This was my first time baking with stevia and none of my family were able to tell the difference versus only sugar so do go ahead and experiment. I wonder if ground ginger would render a more intense flavor. I think I will up the other spices as well next time
