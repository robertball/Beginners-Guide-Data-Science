These are a very simple mashed potato recipe that my family enjoyed. I did peel my potatoes due to a picky eater but other than that the recipe was made as written. I could have used some more chicken broth while mashing but the potatoes still turned out well. I seasoned with a bit of seasoned salt, probably less than a teaspoon (I used unsalted broth).

Simple mashed potatoes without the cream (that I'm used to adding). I liked the addition of chicken broth which added more flavor. The butter still made it very creamy and went well with the pork chops. Will make this super easy recipe again!

I really liked all the added flavor using the Swanson broth. I used this recipe to go with a shepherds pie meal and it went very well all together. Four stars instead of five though because it tasted a tad too salty. I only added a pinch to the entire dish.

This is a super simple and completely delicious method to make mashed potatoes. I left the skins on (diced the pieces somewhat small) and used a hand masher with a little of the broth left in the pot (drained off most of it, and reserved in case I needed it). I didn't add salt or anything - they were delicious with just the broth.
