To those folks who complained about blandness: This is a biscuit. A quick bread devised in a time of dearth in order to survive. It's not a cookie nor a main course. It's easy and filling and tasty and a good foil for a myriad of savory foods if you happen to be fortunate enough to have something else for an entree.

If you add buttermilk to the recipe, it makes the dough more pliable, also the griddle must be at a very low temperature.My granny used to make these when I was growing up in Ireland, and she always added butter milk.I add crushed garlic to mine now, and sometimes basil.You can even add mashed veg to get your kids to eat them, taste good too.

We had these with the Ulster Fry-Up, and although I had told myself beforehand that I'd have only one wedge, I ate so many that I'd hate to admit to the actual count. Fantastic!

These were delicious!  I added a little onion powder to the dough mixture - this was a BIG help!  I used bacon grease to fry the second batch instead of using flour - this was also quite tasty.  They were good either way, really... thanks for sharing!

I was raised on these but we just called them potato pancakes because my Mom and Grandmother made them into individual cakes. I add a little onion and garlic powder and always serve with a little butter on top. By doing individual cakes they are easier to spoon on the pan and flatten and 1/4 of flour is just enough.

My family learned to make these years ago when we moved to Canada from Northern Ireland. Also Soda Farls because you can't get either here, lol. These are actually made to griddle, but then fry in bacon grease or lard, then we put HP sauce on them. Yummy! Same as the Soda Farl, after grilling you fry in whatever grease you want and either eat with an egg on top or HP sauce. This is a family favorite for us. The soda farl tastes good just eating right off the griddle, but these I have always perferred them after you fry them. (but you still have to griddle them first before you fry) Anyways, that is just my two cents, lol. Enjoy. Oh, and the key to these turning out is to dry your potatos after boiling as the OP said. If you don't dry out your potato, it will be too mushy with the flour. And with these and with Soda farl, you need to be willing to adjust how much flour you use. There can be lots of different factors that affect how much flour goes in. And the soda Farl is the same thing with the buttermilk. Sometimes it is say one cup and other times you might use 1 1/4 or even 1 1/2 cups. Once you get to know what the dough for either should look and feel like, you just make your adjustments with the ingredients. If you ask some of the older generations that made these for an Ulster Fry, they will tell you that you can't always count on the exact same measurements.

Fantastic! I moved from Northern Ireland to Canada in 2003 and this is what I missed most! They taste exactly as they do when you buy them from the shop. I prefer to toast mine with butter dripping off them. I use a 10 pound bag of potatoes so that I can make extras for freezing and share with the rest of the family I have over here. Thank you so much for posting!

Farl's are wonderful and this is the perfect recipe. I notice a lot of people saying they needed to double the flour - I find that it depends on the water content of the potatoes.  The dryer the potato - the lesser the amount of flour.  You are after all making a dough.  it is very important to let the potatoes dry on a warm stove.  I've been known to put mine in the oven for a bit on warm. I do also add a bit more butter - and thats just for personal taste (and in case I over-dry! :)) These are a wonderful comfort food and in these days - this recipe can be used as a base for a wonderful main dish add a veggie over top with a bit of meat a bit of gravy, sort of like a pot pie YUMMY a very very economical and delicious meal! or for breakfast, add crumbled cooked bacon to your dough and serve with fried eggs over top! I've even tried rolling this dough around pre-cooked hotdogs and I got to tell you, it was wonderful! (but thats just me :)) - for changing the recipe up - Try adding rosemary, or dill.  Plenty of Garlic... and yum onion! Grate and dry your onion with the potatoes. instead of butter try butter and sourcream - or sour cream alone.  The sky's the limit.  Thanks Ita for the perfect Farls recipe!

I usually make boxty for our StP's dinner, but I saw these and thought I'd give them a trial run. I can't say I liked them. I found I needed WAY more flour to make the dough pliable, and they really didn't achieve the light fluffy texture that farls should have. I think I'll try my luck with Ita's farl recipe that uses buttermilk.

This can go into the 'Penny Pincher' column.  We always save left-over mashed potatoes (refrigerated, of course) to make our version; we call them potatoe cakes, sort of the size of crab cakes or small pancakes.  Additives welcome: onion, peppers, spinach, carrot, celery, spices, etc..

I used about twice the flour butter and salt, and they turned out great. I also put a pat of butter on each piece before I served them, We all really liked them.

I'm not patient enought to boil fresh potatoes so I used instant mashed potatoes and mixed in rice flour because I'm gluten intollerant. My husband keeps trying to get me to make them because he loves them so much. We "Americanize" them by adding shredded cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and for me, sour cream. OMG so good.

I make mine a little differently.  I use left over mashed potatoes, add a little baking power and then start adding flour until it has the consistency of pie dough.  After rolling it out, I fry it in margarine until brown on both sides.  When they are done I put some butter on top.  I usually make a lot so I freeze the extra, uncooked potato bread on cookie sheets and then put them in zip lock bags to cook later.  So very bad for you, but so, so good.

Tried making this for St. Patrick's Day this year.  What an epic fail!  Just a huge potato and flour mess!!  Went straight from the cutting board to the trash.  No matter how much flour I added while trying to make a "dough" and knead it, it did nothing.  Was attempting to try something new but I won't be trying this again.

My mom made these with the left over mashed potatoes when I was a kid. We called them potato cakes. My dad was Irish but I just thought it was another way not to waste food. With 11 kids to feed nothing went to waste.I make them and like some of the others, add a little onion.

This recipe is a good basic platform to start from. From this recipe, I went about milling around the kitchen to make it easier and a bit quicker. What I came up with:  1 pouch of 'instant' mashed potatoes following the box's normal cooking directions worked great. I added about 2 tablespoons more butter. I started with adding a cup of flour, and from there, I kept adding 1/4 cup flour until the mix reached a consistency similar to bread (but still slightly sticky). I hand patted out larger rounds (make sure you have extra flour on hand) and fried them up in a mix of oil and butter. *Make sure the 'patties' are thin, because they really solidify and puff up a bit, which makes them kind of thick to eat*. Other than that, added herbs and bit more salt helped. You can butter the end result to taste.

Made this on St Patricks Day as part of an Ulster Fry-up  breakfast.  My husband really liked them and my 4 year old daughter and I thought they were ok.  The recipe was very easy but I did  have to add quite a bit more flour than the recipe called for. Might try adding some onion and herbs next time.

These taste delicious but, and this could be because I used cold leftover mashed potatoes, they didnt hold together like a biscuit. They were like I plopped some mashed potatoes in a skillet and fried them.

Maybe I did something wrong...mine were practically impossible to cook. I thought the taste was good (because I added lots of seasonings), but the dough was so sticky, even with extra flour, that they would not stay together or form a shape for anything when I cooked them.

this turned out good. However I did add spices such as oregano and pepper after I read the comments noting they were bland. my biggest problem was that the cooking time was way off. each side needed 10 minutes and not 3 as noted. this is a big difference it changes the recipe from quick and easy to long and tiring.

I made the recipe using whole wheat flour, and it worked fine.  I used the onion powder suggestion.  I also cooked the potatoes in chunks with the skin on; it peeled off easily.  Great on a cold day.  We had them with sardines.

My first batch wasn't working.  I think my potatoes where larger than medium so I had to keep adding flour to make it dough-like and then it worked out.

These potato pancakes don't have any flavor. I tried making them in a pan with flour, then I tried frying some of them in oil. The fried ones had a little flavor, but overall they were really blah.

I make these, but never used a recipe; a friend showed me how to make them 18 years ago when we first moved to Ireland.  They are bland, they are intended as a food carrier, not as a food by themselves and are usually eaten with breakfast or another meal.  In Northern Ireland they are sometimes deep fried after cooking as part of the "Ulster Fry" they are good that way too, but I prefer just the griddle version.  To reheat just place under a grill, in a toaster/toaster oven or use the griddle again.  You can also stick between two damp paper towels in the microwave for about 20 seconds but any longer may make the tough.  They are very good with canned beans also with jam, honey, melted cheese or bacon.

As another reviewer wrote, I always add buttermilk. My son loves them both warm off the griddle or then fried in the bacon grease when we're having an Ulster Fry.

I used leftover mashed potatos, added a bit more flour then recommended and added some buttermilk and they came out alright.  I think next time I'll try some garlic and parmesan, or maybe red pepper flakes to give it a bit more flavor.

I followed the recipe but it either did not turn out right or it just was not the best, nothing like my dad use to make.I even tried to do it again with double the flour and butter... I will probably try a differnt recipe next time.

The way I made it, which may or may not have been accurate, since I am very inexperienced in the kitchen, it can out nice and doughy and browned on the outside, but the inside was more of the texture of a regular old potato. It was delicious!

This is very close to my great-grandmother's recipe..  I use an Iron Skillet over a med-high heat and that works best for me. Thank you for this recipe and a touch of Ireland!

Hubby makes these all the time from cold potatoes.  That is the key.  It changes the starch and blends nicely with the flour added.  Sometimes, he adds dehydrated onion bits.  Buttermilk is a great addition. don't try to flip these until one side is firmly cooked or they will fall apart.  Cook them slowly and well.

A good simple authentic tasting recipe.  Some might say bland, but think about where and when it was invented.  In Ireland, in the grips of rationing and limited ingredients.  Salt and pepper are the only spices needed, and real butter melted over it.  Yum.

I made these farls yesterday to stretch out our dinner.  My husband who doesn't like anything ate every single bite.  He asked what they are - I told  him - 'whatever they are make them again.'  Now that's a five star rating.  I made no changes - I do need to gather a few skills turning them over so they aren' just big globs...Yippee - great..

These did not turn out at all. This is definitely a recipe where the amount of potatoes you use matters down to the T and thus requires a more specific measurement than just 4 medium potatoes.

I cheated: Based on other users, I added 1 tsp Italian seasoning (instead of salt), 1 clove of garlic, and 1 more tbsp of butter. I added the Italian seasoning with the flour (I used Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Gluten-free baking flour for a gluten-free dish!). I chopped/sliced the garlic then melted it with the 2 tbsp of butter the night prior, letting it set in the fridge overnight. I followed the rest of the directions and was super in love! I also recommend an olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping sauce, as it was fabulous together. This was a definite hit! Thank you for this lovely recipe!
