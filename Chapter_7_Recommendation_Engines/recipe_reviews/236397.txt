This is my family's new favorite recipe!! Took it to a family BBQ and everyone LOVED it!! Made the recipe as directed (using frozen corn instead of canned, because I had that on hand) but thought it needed just a little more color so added grape tomaotoes (halved) and some red onion. I mixed all the ingredients except the cheese and avacado the night before and let it "marinate" (stirring occassionally up to the party.) Added in the avacado just before serving and put the cheese in a bowl on the side to be added as an "optional topping" to accomodate dairy allergies in the family.  Note: You can use the pasta type of your choice to meet dietary needs (i.e. whole-wheat, gluten free, etc.)  Will definitely be making this one again!!

This salad was Awesome! ! Didn't change a thing cuz if it ain't broke, don't fix it!  Instead of canned corn,  I used a leftover corn on the cob.  I served it with Mexican beef tacos. Thank you Barilla

OUTSTANDING!!!  I didn't change anything from the recipe except I couldn't find cotijo cheese so I had to sub feta.  This was outstanding!  We added some pre-cooked and diced chicken breasts and made it a meal!  I will absolutely be making this again, won't change a thing!

The recipe is okay, but it calls for way too much pasta! I have enough pasta for another recipe.  The tastes are good, but I also used feta cheese as I couldn't find the Mexican kind used. My store had every other Mexican cheese, just not that one. I used a feta that had the lowest sodium content so my salad could take a bit more. I also ground it up so it was less chunky and went farther through the salad. I gave this three stars because of the over use of pasta.
