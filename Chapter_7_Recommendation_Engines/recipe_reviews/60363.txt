I froze the grapes and omitted the ice. I also used one packet of Truvia in place of the granulated sugar. This was okay. Drinkable but not my favorite.

great, cool and refreshing.  Only added 1 tsp of vanilla, and used lemon yogurt since that was what we had.  I omitted the sugar and ended up with a great smoothie that even my two yr olds loved!

My 7 year old was a little nervous as I made it but loved it.  It is light and very peachy.  I think it would work with any yogurt. Followed recipe exactly. Thanks.

This smoothie was very good! I love to make it when I don't have ingredients like strawberries on hand (which a lot of smoothies call for). I will definatley continue to make this!

Pretty nice - I used banana yogurt because that's what I had.  Kids raved.

the smoothie was okay. it had WAY to much vanilla though. So it was more like a vanilla sugar smoothie with a hint of grape. If I ever made this smoothie again, I would change some ingredients. Instead of doing peach yogurt i used strawberry, because that is all we had!

I didn't care for this, I didn't think the combination of grape and vanilla went well together.

It sounds like an odd combination but this is one of the best smoothies I've made yet.   I cut out the sugar, extract, and ice by simply using a couple scoops of low fat vanilla ice cream. I had no peach yogurt so I replaced the milk with the juice out of a can of peaches and threw in a few of the peaches as well.

left out the sugar altogether and part of the iced actually because i froze the grapes beforehand and used them for both (I hate a watery smoothy) yunnnny and good.  thanks! bet it'll be even better in the summer (and cheaper grapes are pricey now).

I used vanilla yogurt and left out the ice.  I felt the sugar was unnecessary, since the yogurt is already very sugary.  I also felt there was too much yogurt and that's all you could taste; 1/2 c would have been fine.  There were not enough grapes, so I tripled them.

One of the most delicious, light-flavoured smoothies I've ever made. I prefer it over store made smoothies !
