The flavor in this was really good. I ended up only needing 4 cups of chicken broth and even then it was still on the runny side. The recipe only calls for the asparagus to be trimmed but if I were to make this again I'd chop it into more manageable pieces. Overall this is a really good recipe with a great flavor combo.
