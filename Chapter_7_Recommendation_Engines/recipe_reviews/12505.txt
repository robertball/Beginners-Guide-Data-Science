This recipe is fantastic. It is almost the same as my mom's original only hers didn't have the alcohol and she used a graham cracker crust. Otherwise it is the same. It is wondertful and worth the extra effort. There is really nothing like it available commercially or by a simple recipe. It is a delicate but rich from scrath recipe. An old stand-by that gets easier each time you make it.
