Sauteed the mushrooms with some sliced green onions for just 5 minutes to release some of the juices before putting into the baking dish, then topped the flounder with panko/parmesan mixed with a little Smart Balance lite margerine.  It was really good and light on calories too.

I've made this a few times, and it's a big hit with the whole family.  Instead of green onions and mushrooms, I've used onions and green pepper.  I also don't usually have the low-fat ingredients but use regular cheese, etc.  Quick, easy, and delicious.

Easy and delicious!  I cooked with 2 T each white wine & broth and 1 T lemon juice.  Put fish in prepared dish, poured wine mixture over and sprinkled with Italian seasoning.  Topped with the cheese and crumbs, then as an afterthought pulled out the parmasean cheese and sprinkled lightly across the top.  drizlled with butter as directed.  Cooked for 10 minutes and then put in broiler to toast top.  Used fresh sole and family loved it.

Why add the cheese and butter if you are trying to make it low-fat and low calorie?  This recipe is fine without adding these fattening ingredients. Would be good with any mild, white fish.

I used sole for this & marinated it in lemon juice for .5 hour(while making everything else).  Didn't have the white wine so i just poured the lemon marinade over the fish then topped with the marjoram & pepper...then 1/4 breadcrumbs & 1/4 wheat germ & parm cheese mixture.  My family raved about this: "this is the best ever" raved my "pickey solefish eater husband"!!  My 3 yr old devoured it & my 5 year old thought it was "fair"....WOW, i loved it...definately a keeper!!!---thanks!

This dish was good although next time I will try actually dipping the fish in the white wine/lemon then rolling it in the bread crumbs before placing it over the vegetables.

Mmmmmmm. This was really tasty. I didn't have marjoram so I sprinkled some oregano on the fish. Other than that, everything was prepared as written. A lot different than just dotting with butter and paprika! LOL! Will sure do this one again! Thanks for the post!

This recipe is very good.  As suggested I saute the mushrooms and onion first.  I also saute some chopped red pepper and sprinkle on top before baking.  This adds some extra flavor and color!

This was good but not quite 5 star.  I used flounder.  Next time I make this, I think I am going to saute the mushrooms and green onions just a bit.  They were too crunchy for my liking.  Maybe that will make it a 5 star recipe!

Made this tonight and it was amazing. I sauteed the mushrooms and green onions first but I added a juicy plum tomato, chopped cilantro and Mrs. dash and garlic powder. Then followed the rest of the steps, I used panko and omitted the butter but used a little bit of Italian blend shredded cheese. Oh and I used both flounder (hubby's fav) and salmon (my fav).  We loved it, the salmon was amazing and moist. Will make this one very often.

Super easy recipe that uses a lot of ingredients I keep on hand. I bought flounder, having never made anything with it before, and this recipe suited my fiance and I perfectly. The mushrooms are delicious and the fish takes on lots of flavor.

Yum, this is a great, easy way to prepare fish.  I only made a couple changes- I didn't use the mushrooms since I hate them, I squeezed a little bit of lime juice in place of the lemon and I cut out the cheese since it didn't seem necessary to me.  I also put it under the broiler for the last couple minutes to crisp up the breadcrumbs.  It was very flavorful and super easy to prepare.

I made this recipe using White Wine instead of chicken broth and did not have the green onions handy. Also, I did not have wheat bread crumbs but used Italian bread crumbs. This dish was EXCELLENT, I am recommending to my friends who are looking for something different for fish. I will make this again.

Out of marjoram, seasoned with Old Bay, used shredded sharp cheddar and italian style bread crumbs, also used sherry instead of white wine.  VERY VERY GOOD and SUPER fast to make.

We didn't like the cheese on top. Italians never combine cheese and fish. We did make it that way the first time but couldn't find a reason for it to be there. Next time we make it, we will make it without the cheese.

I made this but also sauted 1/2 a red onion (what I had) and the mushrooms in a sauce pan with olive oil spray.  I added salt, pepper and about a tablespoon of white wine to the onion/mushroom mix.  Otherwise, I followed as directed, except I used Fleishman's light butter with canola oil.  It was excellent.  Will definitely make again.  I

I made this as directed with the change of chicken broth and Parmesan cheese. My daughter can't have any thing with a fat gram more than a single digit. The flavor wasn't bad but it was so mushy. I had such nice flounder filets too.

We all loved this recipe.  I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms first.  Since my husband has to eat glutten free, I used crushed rice cheks instead of bread crumbs; and parmesan cheese.  I also lightly sprinkled the fish with garlic powder.  Will definately make again.

Followed other reviewers advice to saute mushrooms first and marinate flounder in the lemon while prepping other things ...also used parm cheese. My 9 year old daughter who typically dislikes fish ate it up ...SUCCESS!!and the whole family loved it. Thank you!! This will be added to the regular rotation!!

I made this for dinner for my 5 year old daughter and I last night.  Follwed the recipe exactly except scaled the ingredients down for just the 2 of us.  It turned out really good and we both enjoyed it.  The fish had a lovely flavour and there were some nice juices which we ladled over rice. Very tasty and I would definitely make it again.

I gave this 5 star because this is a really nice recipe to jump off from. I had some flounder, but since my husband is dieting I knew I couldn't bread and fry.  I sprayed the pan and then put down a layer of green beans and carrots.  I put the flounder on top, then used the recipe for spices.  2 Tbl wine and 2 Tbl melted butter, 1/4 cup shred cheddar and 1/4 cup french friend onions.  Baked according to recipe.  It was really good, and I really don't like fish so this is high praise.  My husband and teen sons thought it was terrific.  So there's a great low calorie, healthy recipe that everyone liked and was easy.  That's 5 stars in my book!!

Made this for my husband and he loved it. I used 1 nice thick and fresh flounder fillet, used cayenne powder instead of marjoram, husband's preference, white wine and italian bread crumbs. I did cook it a little longer due to the thickness.

The fish needed to be fired or something first to make it crispier.  Cooking it on top of the veggies made it get soft.

I used flounder.  It was a bit fishy and my kids did not like (ages 12 & 15).  I did not have mushrooms and had to use homemade bread crumbs. Still no left overs!

I am always looking for a good baked fish dish and this one hit the spot. It's tasty, has texture, and is healthy. But most imporant my husband raved about it. And I consider it one of the most easy dishes I've made in a while. It takes less than 30 min, Thanks to who ever came up with this meal. Jeanna in TX

Very good and easy to put together.  My whole family liked it.  I used 8 oz of fresh mushrooms and cornflake crumbs in place of the bread crumbs and butter.

My fish came out incredibly mushy and hardly edible. It was touching the broth and lemon juice underneath it, despite the presence of the mushrooms and onions.  Flavors decent, but the texture was by far the worst with any fish I've ever had. Oh well!

Different than any fish I've made before, turned out great! I changed it a little. Baby Portabella mushrooms and green pepper, flounder marinade in white wine with little bit of lemon for 15 minutes. Salt, pepper, oregano. Cover lightly gluten free bread crumbs and cheese. My husband gave it his star of approval.

I was really hoping this would turn out well, but the fish just didn't seem to taste as good as when we've used other recipes.

Seasoned with Penzey Spice's "Greek Seasoning" as it was the only marjoram I had.  That, topped with feta as well as the cheese mix was AMAZING.  We loved it!

We live on Dauphin Island and eat a LOT of fish.  This is a nice change, really liked it. Prepared by the recipe but may spice it up a bit more next time.

Great recipe.  If worried about calories, you might want to cut back on the butter.  I served with the spiced quinoa on this site and it was very complimentary

Very good.  Served with brown Basmati and wild rice and a salad.  Best with a Sauvignon Blanc.  Tasty dish that can be served when other activities are planned for the evening.

Good. Substituted onions for mushrooms (kids don't like them). The fish was a little bland. Next time I'll add some spices and salt, but there will definitely be a next time.

All I have to say is both my kids like it.  One will eat anything and one will eat nothing but junk if I let her.  I have left out items like no green onions since kids will not eat and they still like it.  They call it the flounder with the cheesy crusty stuff on top.  Hubby thinks it is “OK” but eats every bit.  Not 5 stars but I love it for those nights when I don’t want to hear “I don’t like this” but want to be healthy.  That in our house mean more then anything.

Very good.  My family usually won't eat fish but they actually liked this dish and said they wouldn't mind if I made it again - that was a shock!  I skipped the butter and used sharp cheddar instead of Mexican cheese because that is what we had in the house.  I also seasoned the bread crumbs, but that was just out of habbit.

instead of using butter I used butter flavored cooking spray to coat the bread crumbs further reducing the fats and calories for my husbands diet.  loved the taste of this recipe.

I too have to watch my fat intake and this was really tasty, my husband even liked it and he is a fairly picky eater.  I was out of marjoram and used oregano instead but it still turned out really well.

I did saute the veggies and used Old Bay seasoning per other reviews.  It was good, but next time I'd cut down the lemon just a little bit. Served with Onion Rice and steamed carrots.  YUMMY.

Giving this three stars because it may not be the fault of the recipe that ours turned out horrible.  We couldn't even eat it because it was so bad--very bitter.  I am hoping it was just the fish as I'm not sure how the ingredients would have given it such an awful taste.  Glad the rest of you enjoyed it though!
