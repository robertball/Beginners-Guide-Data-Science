I typically doctor up recipes to my liking, this time I used the recommended ingredients.  Only needed 2 minutes on each side to sear on med high cast iron, 3 minutes would have overcooked.  I used a lot more red wine than called for, which really hit the spot as the ribs were roasting.  I also added the stock over time - only about 2/3 of recommended- to allow it to reduce.  I have tried several of the rib roast recipes on this site, and while all of them have been good this one is the absolute bomb.  There are lots of ways to roast a rib, but the cast sear is THE way to go.  And the from scratch gravy is basic but it dominates - I recommend adding it to everything you serve.

A cast iron skillet makes for a great stove top to oven roasting pan.  I disagree with the instruction, "130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for rare, about 2 more hours."  If you cook this to 130 and then let rest you will not have a 'rare' roast. After roasting and resting a final temperature of 130 - 135 is medium rare.  I like the slow roast method but I should have seared the top fat cap longer than I did.  It didn't have that crispy 'crust' that I like so much.  Also, I didn't use wine in the gravy because we have a couple of people who don't care for the taste of red wine.

Of all the prime rib recipes I've made, this is THE BEST.  Easy one-pan method that makes an incredible gravy.  Don't expect the gravy to be thick, it's more like a very pourable "coat the back of a spoon gravy."  Don't be afraid to add the beef juices to your gravy that accumulate from the resting (foil covered) rib roast.  I didn't sear the roast dry, but added just the thinnest layer of canola oil & a pat of unsalted butter to create a nice brown sear before going into the oven.

One of my dinner guest said this was the best tasting, fork licking prime rib he ever had!

The meat came out fantastic. I rubbed with sea salt, thyme, and a touch of rosemary. 4lb roast, and I cooked it a little less than the specified time... it came out of the oven at 140F in the center, which scared me but was just right.

The gravy on the other hand never thickened. I think I will use less broth the next time I attempt this one... it tried to thicken, it never did.

Amazing recipe. I've made this now for the second time, and once again, was not disappointed!  The only thing I had to adjust was the cooking time as the roast was only 2 lbs, vs the 4 in the recipe. Absolutely delicious. And, the best recipe I've ever had for a roast.

Great recipe, hard to mess up, the only change is that I used my own seasonings. But as far as the process, easy easy easy.

The cast iron skillet cooking method worked really well. It was simple, gave the outside of the roast the browning needed, and kept the inside so moist and tender with the low, slow roasting. I already had the roast in when I realized I'd forgotten to pick up beef broth, so I had to substitute a package of au just mix and water. But otherwise I followed this pretty closely, just adjusting for the size roast I had.

Omg my mother in law said it couldn't be done making gravy out of a prime rib! Thanks for proving her wrong! It was sooo good she only took leftover gravy home! We also had some good fun while making it with the chunks of onions and thyme sprigs she looked at me like I was crazy! I said no worries if it fails I have package gravy! Lol no packets needed! Definetly a keeper!

I don't think any recipe will overcome my poor judgement on when to remove meat from the heat source. I always seem to overcook it and this method did not change that.

al99 knows of what he speaks!  I made this recipe and for that meal, I was the world's best chef. The prime rib was tender, rich and full-flavored; therefore the accompanying gravy was perfect.  I cannot wait for the next "occasion" (dinner?) to have an excuse to make this absolutely out-of-this-world meal.  Everyone loved it and I was asked for the recipe by all who shared the meal with us.  I gave all the credit to al99 and allrecipes.com!  Thank you!

I would give this more stars if I could.  Made this for Christmas dinner and it was AMAZING!  I usually tinker with recipes but I didn't change a thing with this.  Hubby said it was the best prime rib I have ever made.  I used a meat thermometer and took it out at 130 degrees and let it rest for about 25 minutes while I reheated the twice baked potatoes and made the aus jus (which was delicious, by the way!)  I would highly recommend this recipe.
