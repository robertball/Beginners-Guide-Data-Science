I found that the pie was quite runny even after it cooled. If I had of cooked it longer, it would have burned. The taste was very good, it just would have been nicer if it had set properly.

I tried this recipe and the pie didn't
 set.  I'm wondering if it should have
 had an egg added.  It may have set
better.
