I thought this was the best greek pasta salad I have tried so far.  There was exactly the right amount of dressing.  You must let it sit for at least 3 hours for the flavors to develop completely.  I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry because they taste just fine after being in the fridge and added a smidge more feta cheese.  Make sure you add salt and pepper to the dressing as well as the again to the salad after mixing.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this one.

This was so delicious, and satisfying w/ greek marinated grilled chicken.  I, too, added more feta along w/ 1 tsp. of dill weed.  Dill is common in Greek cooking, and it was a nice added touch as it balanced the harshness of the oregano.  This will be a nice change of pace this summer and many summers to come!

I made this last weekend when I was having a Greek meal weekend and it was amazing!  I hate it when reviewers change the whole recipe, but this one was perfect the way it was.  The dressing was an exact Greek dressing that complimented the pasta.  Very good!

My mom gave me an extremely similar recipe that is one of our favorites!  The only difference is that it adds chopped pepperoni -- YUM!  My version doesn't call for cucumbers but I'm going to try putting them in next time, because it sounds delicious!  This is to die for with the pepperoni in it!

Yummy!!! I used 1 cup feta cheese (I LOVE feta) and the tri-color rotini. It would also be good with some grilled chicken.

This past salad was awesome.  It really held it's flavor overnight.  I added a little chopped pepperoni and I substituted clamata olives for the black olives.  I also cut down on the olive oil and replaced some of it with the oil from a jar of sundried tomatoes.

This is a wonderful pasta salad!  I made pretty much as is except I doubled the recipe.  I also added artichoke hearts.  I didn't add the green pepper because I do not  like it.

Gorgeous and Delish.  Don't rinse the pasta - pour the dressing on the warm pasta and it will absorb more flavor (just like you do with potato salad).  If you are in a bind (or feeling lazy) use Paul Newman's Balsamic dressing.  This is a fabulous combination of flavors and textures.

Similar to mine but I like to use orzo.  I like using white wine vinegar so it is not so sharp and the lemon comes through. Halved grape tomatoes, crumbled feta, diced cucumber and green pepper , GREEK olives (all balck olives are not equal...please do not use canned ones)

Delicious.  I used a box of rotini, powdered garlic instead of fresh, more tomatoes, more cheese, totally forgot the cucumbers and it was still great. A really nice change from regular macaroni salad.

The dressing is what makes the pasta salad, and this dressing mix is a five star dressing. I did use a whole 12oz. box of Rotini noodles, which is 3 cups dried and it seemed to be the right match with the amount of dressing. I did add more black olives and a whole cucumber...why waste the other half? You can go with just about any veggie mix you have. I made the dressing a couple hours ahead, but poured it on the salad and mixed it right before serving. I find noodles soak up the dressing if left too long before serving and make the salad dry.

This was great!  The dressing was fantastic - just what I was looking for.  I made it exactly as directed, except I accidentally doubled the lemon juice.  It was good like that so I'll keep making it that way! I mixed up extra of the dressing and marinated chicken breasts to grill, along with some asparagus.  I can see making just the dressing to use for a marinade again!  Great recipe, thanks!

I really like the dressing - it's not too strong like some pasta salads. I've made this a number of times, now, and have used roma tomatoes instead of cherry. I added some garbanzo beans. Used fresh oregano. Reduced the olive oil to save fat calories. Traded red wine vinegar for white wine once, and I traded it for tequila lime vinegar another... always fabulous!

OH MY!  This is so good!  I made it for our company and they couldn't stop eating it.  It was a big big hit!  I added 1 tsp dill weed as one reviewer suggested.  Next time I'm going to try throwing in some chicken to make this a main dish.  This is such an easy and quick recipe to make.  This recipe will be making it into my "favorites" recipes.

Ah! This is exactly what I was looking for - an easy, yummy meal for a really hot "dog day" of summer. I changed the recipe just a bit by omitting the cucumber and using Kalamata olives. I also added capers, marinated artichoke hearts (the marinade mixed with lemon can also be used as additional dressing), and sliced cooked chicken. I served this on a bed of chopped Romaine and Swiss Chard with the chicken and feta on top. Not only is this salad delish, it's very pretty. I'll certainly make this again.

Awesome salad! I made it for the ladies in my office and they loved it!.It had beautiful colors. I couldnt find a red bell pepper so I used an orange. I also used bowtie pasta. Those are the only changes I made. I will be making this often.

This was pretty good, but there is no way this is only 8 servings...12 would be more accurate.  Also, I doubled the dressing, because the pasta soaked it all up and the noodles seemed dry.  I used whole wheat pasta, swapped out mushrooms for olives (I detest olives...), and added a drained can of artichoke hearts. My other changes were incidental (no cherry tomatoes, used 1 small-ish tomato, white onion instead of red (all I had), 1/2 red and 1/2 orange pepper instead of green (again, all I had)).  It had very good flavor, and is a good recipe for a crowd.

This salad was good, but not great. My vegetables were very large and I should have added more pasta. The flavor was good, but again, nothing special.

Good base recipe, but it was too oily.  I will try a one to one ratio next time.  Used sun dried tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  Very flavorful.

This was good. Will keep in recipe rotation, especially like that it is a non-mayo based recipe.

Delicious! I love that this recipe doesn't call for A) one pound of pasta and B) bottled Italian salad dressing. I did cut back on the oil (I used 1/3 a cup) and I am glad that I did. There was a perfect pasta to dressing to vegetable ratio. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent - Made as written except I added marinated artichoke hearts instead of the cucumber simply because that's what I had.  Great substitution but next time (and there will be a next time) I will use both the cucumber and the artichoke hearts.  The dressing was absolutely perfect the way it's written and just enough to keep everything slightly wet but not soggy if you know what I mean.  I am heading to the kitchen now to eat the leftovers for dinner on this sweltering hot July day!!!!

I omitted the peppers since my family isn't crazy about them.  I also used Kalamata Olives and added Marinated Artichoke hearts.  I've made it several times for parties and it's always a hit!

The recipe called for 2 cups pasta.  I could not decide if that was 16 oz. or 2 measuring cups of uncooked pasta.  I opted for 16 oz. and I don't think this was correct.  I ended up with a ton of pasta and not enough flavor.  Might try it again with half the pasta.

I've made this twice, and both times I've gotten rave reviews for it. I followed the recipe exactly and did not have to make adjustments to the seasoning.  It has a very clean and light taste to it. I've served it with a half rack of ribs and with grilled steak.

Loved, loved, loved this pasta salad!!!  I used a 16oz box of Garden Rotini and it worked out perfectly!  If you are making it the night before a good suggestion is to double the recipe for the dressing and only put half on when you chill it.  Then the next day before you serve it you can add the other half of the dressing.  I refridgerated over night and by the next day it had soaked up the dressing and needed some more.  I also used Calamata Olives instead of black olives and added roasted red peppers.  Honestly it was very easy to make and was a hit!

OMG this salad is great!!  I make it all the time in the summer for groups.  Always a hit.  I probably use more feta than the recipe and sometimes don't add the pepers.  Oh heck, I modify to what I have, but the balance of the red wine vinager to olive oil is perfect.

I especially love the dressing on this salad.  I did add a couple small shakes extra of vinegar after I tossed it.
Very tasty, very easy recipe.

This was pretty good - colorful and lots of veggies. I made it for a Fourth of July get-together and received, if not exactly raves, lots of compliments. I made it exactly as written, except that I guess my red onion was too big: it looked like a lot of chopped onions so I only used about half of it. I thought that the dressing was a little too much, so I might cut it down a little if I made this again. Nothing fantastic, but nice enough to keep in mind to make again.

Great recipe! Very simple to prepare and tastes delicious! I made this exactly as instructed and it was gobbled up this Fourth of July! Everyone loved it! The vinaigrette is flavorful yet not overpowering. It is very appealing to the eye as well. I added this recipe to my personal at-home recipe box; it was so good!

It's a little bland, but tastes alright. Waaaay too much oil though.  I'd use half or less if I made this again.

I've even used gluten free pasta to accommodate special needs and it's still great. The one thing I changed was the red wine vinegar, I used balsamic vinegar since that was all i had on hand. I'm sure i could have even used old red wine.  As for the olives, I've used canned black and another time I've used Israeli "black" olives which are actually green and more bitter tasting, just as good!

I thought this would be great, but the vinegar was overpowering.  I would cut it in half and maybe more.  Well, maybe that's because I'm not a big vinegar fan.

Very good and I did not change the recipe.  Doubled for a big party and it was all gone.  I had to substitute ground oregano for part of the leaf oregano and it still worked well. I will use this for my pasta salad from now on.

Really good! As suggested by others, I used whole grape tomatoes (about 1/2 a pint), a full cup of crumbled feta, and a teaspoon of dill. I know I'll be making this again.

Excellent recipe. I ended up adding a bit more red wine vinegar to the dish as it tasted too oily for me.  Next time I will use the listed amt of vinegar but use less oil.  I had only 3/4 of one pepper but with all the other ingredients, it was fine.  I ended up using over a cup of Feta to get more more flavor - I really like what it does to a dish.  The salad was a hit at the BBQ I took it to.

For us, it lacked flavor and I was bummed out. I followed the recipe exactly (minus adding black olives). It's not bad, just wasn't what I hoped for. Perhaps I can play around with it and see if I can't get the flavor I'm looking for.  Easy to make, so that was a plus!

This is very easy, and delicious. Took it to a family get-together and it disappeared quickly, and people asked for the recipe. The first time I made it, I used a red pepper and a yellow pepper; the green pepper was way too expensive at my supermarket. I also cut back on the amount of the peppers that I add: approximately half of the green and half of the red. This will be a favorite.

perfect!! I have been looking for a  greek pasta salad and this met my expectations. I cut it down to 4 servings for the 2 of us-- but my husband who had claimed he did not really like feta cheese, actually loved it and ate a lot!!  The only change I made to this recipe was to cut oregano down to maybe 1/4t and I  added  1/2t basil and  1t dillweed --- I will be making this again and it will become a summer salad favorite- thanks for sharing your recipe.

I felt like the pasta to veggie ratio was off.  Next time I would do half as much bell pepper.  Other than that, I like it.

I added some dill also to cut the strong flavor of the oregano,  it worked to blend the flavors, I left off the feta because not everyone in my family likes it. I added the feta to mine though because I love the flavor. I also added mozzarella cheese as a side. I salted and peppered the noodles after they were rinsed and drained. Good olive oil us the key ingredient to this dish! Enjoy

I really liked this recipe. I was visiting my daughter and had to use ingredients on hand. Made a few minor changes only because I didn't want to go to store. I added some roasted chick peas and had to omit the cucumber. I made it again today and will make in Sunday for a get together.

I made this as a side dish for a bbq. I made it exactly as listed although I did take a suggestion from another reviewer & doubled the dressing. I put 1/2 on it in the morning when I made it & the other 1/2 when I served it.

The vegetables and homemade vinaigrette give this a fresh taste that I don't usually get from pasta salad. This may not be what you're looking for if you're craving the typical pasta salad, but I thought it was great! I only had half the olives called for, but I really didn't miss them. If anything, the reduced saltiness may have helped with the fresh flavor.
I give this a 5, but my husband prefers pasta salad with more dressing, so I decided to rate 4 stars.

Made this for a BBQ and it was delicious. I'm Greek so I don't believe in canned olives. If you can, try to buy the real Kalamata olives instead. I added a little fresh basil and a pinch of the zest of the lemon to the dressing and it just kicks it up a few notches! I will definitely try it with grilled chicken next time. Schrimp I think would also be nice :)

Great pasta salad recipe, I used 1/3 olive oil instead and thought it was enough, also used cut up mozzarella instead of feta. At first I thought the vegetables were not going to be enough (the 10 cherry tomatoes) but it ended up being the perfect amount of vegetables. Will make again

loved this recipe even though I forgot the dried oregano.  I had sprinkled a little italian dressing seasoning on this so that probably made up a little for the forgotten oregano.  I made a huge batch and the family loved eating it the next couple of days.  I was considering buying the Costco greek pasta but it was drowning in sauce and te pasta looked mushy.  So glad I decided to make my own. Will definately keep this recipe and make again!

This was such a great pasta salad recipe that I could hardly wait the 3 hours chill time to try it!  I substituted green olives since I didn't have black olives, and it was wonderful.

A delicious summer salad.  I omitted the black olives due to personal taste, and added an entire cucumber rather than half.  I mixed up the dressing and poured 3/4 of it over the salad and refrigerated it for 3+ hours.  I added the remaining 1/4 of dressing and the feta cheese right before serving.  This salad was well received by my family and the leftovers were delicious the next day, always a plus in my book.  This would be a very good 'main dish' salad topped with a grilled chicken breast.  Thanks Danielle Larouche for sharing your recipe.

I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine (had on hand), so it maybe it's not fair to rate.  This was a pretty good pasta salad, but a little bland for our tastes (we like very flavorful food).  Could not really taste the garlic, oregano, etc. very much.  The amount of dressing is about right for the pasta though.  Maybe I'll make again with the red wine vinegar and more spices...

Agree with the other reviewers - the dressing is spot on!  Doesn`t keep for several days though.  Try to make it the day of or day before at the earliest.

Absolutely LOVED this! I added artichoke hearts, used kalamata olives instead of black and twice the amount of cucumber and feta. I also used Sweet Cherry Peppers (not as much)instead of Green and Red. The dressing is amazing. Actually, I'm not a pasta salad lover and I will be making this again and again this summer. Thank you! Thank you!

Loved this one!  So light and simple - great for a hot summer day.  I didn't have any bell peppers.  I doubled the cucumber and Feta, just because.  Big hit with the family.  Thanks for posting!

Perfect recipe!  Made this over the weekend for a BBQ for our youngest one's 3rd birthday.  I opted for orzo instead of penne, but that was hubby's request!  I did add more feta and tomatoes and reduced the oil a bit and left out the onion (don't care too much for raw onion, plus there were little ones!)  It was enjoyed by all and the leftovers were great too!

This was a really good salad.  Just like Greek Salad, but the pasta made a little more special.  Everyone enjoyed it and there were no leftovers!  I made this when y mum's cousin was over and will be making this again for a family get together.  It pleases everyone.

This was excellent. It even tasted fine the next day.  Although if making for a party I wouldn't reccomend making any farther than the morning of the event.

This was a great addition to our summer road trip cookout.  I prepared it in the morning before we left and chilled it in the cooler...by the time we hit our first stop, it was perfect.  I used Kalamata olives which enhanced the flavor of the dish.

I made this salad and people couldn't stop raving about it. Thanks for posting it! The only alteration I made was to add more feta cheese.

This is excellent! I used a whole package of grape tomatoes cut in half, a large can of black olives cut in half, and added a whole can of quartered artichokes and half a package of peperoni. Also used half to 3/4 package of whacky mac in place of the penne.

Very good recipe!  I wanted to make enough for a party, so I used twice as much pasta but kept the other amounts the same.  Yum! Great dressing!

Excellent! I used rotini pasta and added marinated artichokes.  Also left out the tomato as I didn't have any.  I will definitely make this again -- I loved it!
**2nd Attempt** Even better! I didn't use artichokes the second time but I kind of liked it better without! I also didn't use green pepper because I had none, and I used much more cucumber than the recipe called for (about 1 medium cucumber, seeded and chopped).

I made this for a potluck lunch with our local Diabetes support group. Everybody liked it and asked for the recipe. The before we had it for supper. It tasted great. I had enough leftovers for another 2 meals. My wife and thought it tasted better with each day longer in the fridge. My wife told me to make enough so we will have some leftovers. I definitely make this again. It was the best pasta salad I ever had. Thanks Danielle for sharing this great recipe.

I agree it's a litter bitter, I just throw 1tsp of stevia/erythritol blend into the dressing before I blend it up. I use red lentil rotini to make it more of a meal and more nutrient-dense and it comes out beautifully!  I really love this one.

Great overall flavor and was loved by family and friends. I did cut back on the oregano and substituted a red pepper for the tomatoes. Better if made the day before.

This turned out great.  I made a few substitutions mainly because it’s what I had on hand.  I used tricolour rotini and 3 different coloured peppers for colour.  I used a variety of small different coloured tomatoes.  I ran out of red wine vinegar so used have white wine vinegar.

What I did was went to the local Grocery store and got the Olives medley from the Olive bar, I used the juice from the olives as well as I used the small balls of Mozzarella. I went to the deli and got 1/4 slices(4) of Provolone cheese,  (4) slices of 1/4 Swiss, cut it up using a pizza cutter cause of it being faster. Doing it the way I did I eliminated using any salad dressing, the last thing I put in was shredded Parm cheese. I used the Rainbow pasta.If you want it a little spicy put the small pepperoni in it

Fantastic Greek pasta salad.  Beautiful taste, all the ingredients really worked together.  Chilling it for at least three hours (or overnight) really does enhance the taste!

This recipe makes a large amount.  I took it for church supper and ALL GONE!  The flavors are still individual while somehow melting into one giant delicious whole.  This is so basic and good that I am surprised I haven't seen this one before.  Saved it and will use it again.  Thank You Danielle!

I make this all the time - it's my favorite pasta salad.  I only change a few ingredients due to preference but I use the dressing as it and it's fabulous.  I used spiral pasta instead of Penne, yellow pepper instead of green and green onions instead of red.

I made this last weekend for a family bbq. I made the recipe exactly as it is, but was disappointed with the bitter flavour of the extra virgin olive oil. I will make the recipe again, but with regular olive oil next time and I'm sure that I'll be able to improve my rating of it.

This was an excellent pasta salad  to make and eat during our 112 degree heatwave here in Southern California! I did have to make a change and use 1 cup of a bottled balsamic salad dressing as my red wine vinegar was way past its expiration date but it was still very yummy. Will definitely make again but with some fresh red wine vinegar next time!

I used Kraft balsamic dressing instead of red wine vinegar and olive oil. Omitted the olives and used regular tomatoes but took out seeds.

Made this last night for my husbands office. Super delicious and it got RAVE reviews from my husband’s office...even someone who doesn’t like veggies went back for seconds! The only thing o change was the pasta, I used rotini. I’ll be making this for us at home very soon!

I make a huge pile of this every Easter for our 24 to 28 family, kids, and grand kids.
Love it. But I do buy an off-the-shelf dressing called Greek Feta from a specialty store.The women make everything else after I've destroyed the kitchen.

This is an excellent base for a pasta salad. I only added a few Tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and the dressing was of a balanced acidity.

Outstanding.  The dressing is absolutely fantastic.  I've never cared for pasta salad until I tried this one, now it's my go-to for summer pot-lucks, cook-outs, etc.  My teenagers absolutely love it and ask for it!

This could be a 5 star recipe, but I made so many changes I could not honestly give it that rating.  SO- I was looking for a way to use all the squash that I get in the summer.  Sometimes they get too big so I thought about a  salad.
This recipe gave me the basics.  I trimmed by mongo squash and chopped it into cubes.  Then added Feta, Kalamata olives, tomatoes, 1/ cuke,  basil and Italian dressing.    Wow-was that yummy- and crunchy too!  I made so much I had leftover and it was better the next day and still very crunchy! 
So, as you sub zuccs for pasta in other dishes I did the same thing here.  Very good!

I could only give 2 stars due to the fact that I did not think the peppers complimented this salad at all. In addition, the picture of this salad has artichoke and chickpeas in it. These are not ingredients in the recipe.

Love this recipe 
Of course I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used some red wine and Apple cider vinegar. No black olives, used green olives. No cucumbers, used artichoke hearts. Fresh oregano & cherry tomatoes from my garden. Turned out FANTASTIC.

The tri-color rotini makes for a more colorful serving. Saw artichokes in the photos so I added those too. I prefer a dish, like this, that can be made ahead of time when we have company.

Everyone loved this dish!  I added artichokes, used mostly white vinegar, and used rotini tri-colored pasta. Super colorful and pretty for summer! I also added a little extra cheese and used a greek olive mix and grape tomatoes.  I made this the morning of serving, and poured 1/2 the dressing on then, and the other half at serving.

A good base for Greek pasta salad. I ended up with twice as much vinaigrette as I needed, even though I added a can of garbanzo beans and some chicken (marinated and cooked). It was also too garlicky for me, and I love garlic! 
Recommended add-ins:
garbanzo beans
grilled or pan-fried chicken marinated in lemon juice, olive oil and Greek seasonings
kalamata olives instead of black olives
sun-dried tomatoes are a really tasty replacement for cherry tomatoes

This recipe is a good base for an awesome pasta salad.  I used Kalamata black olives, added a little Balsamic vinegar, threw in a small jar of chopped artichoke hearts (including the oil) and added about a cup of broccoli florets.  I also held the salt and pepper until serving since there are so many varying tastes for those and we always have the salt and pepper mills handy, as needed.  I'll definitely be making this often.

Simple and comes out great every time.  No substitutions are necessary but I've subbed different veggies such as broccoli or sun dried tomato and it's always come out well.

This recipe makes the best Greek pasta salad ever!!! I used penne pasta but may try rotini next time just for a change. I needed a large quantity to take to a party so I doubled all ingredients except for oregano. Superb!!!

Love it! I just needed a recipe for dressing and ratios of ingredients. I was able to take the dressing add a few touches (sugar, & suggested dill, honey) with those added ingredients it turned out fantastic.  I have to alter some of the main ingredients to fit my family's taste buds. Great recipe foundation!

Love this recipe.  It's a go-to make ahead salad for when guests are coming to town.  The pic includes artichoke hearts, but the recipes does not call for them.  I love artichoke hearts, so I always include.

Took this to a party and was begged for the recipe by many people! This is a fantastic Greek pasta salad! The only changes I made are ones I've read here from other members. Tri-color rotini, more salt and pepper, and grape tomatoes instead of cherry :)

I’ve made this twice now, both times for guests, and it has been very well received.  My SIL, who does not like pasta salads, took a spoonful to be polite.  Much to everyone’s astonishment, he asked for seconds and then thirds and THEN took a bowl home to have in his lunch tomorrow.  What more could one want from a recipe?    I think its all in the dressing, a simple mix that is not too over-powering so it allows the flavour of the veggies to shine through.  I increased the garlic by one clove and I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard to the dressing just because I like it in a dressing.  The first time I used garlic stuffed green olives sliced, as that is what I had on hand.  Tonight I used pitted Kalamata olives but left them whole so that the SIL could pick them out.  Good thing to do when you are questioning who likes olives.

This pasta salad was a hit at our July 4th barbeque!  I took the lead from a few suggestions and used kalamata olives, chopped artichoke hearts and a little dill for extra flavor.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to the dressing to lower the acidity.  I would make this again and prepare it the night before so the flavors can really fuse.  This will be a bbq and potluck staple.

This is an easy recipe - I make it even easier by using Newman's own Greek salad dressing instead of making it.  I am not a fan of red peppers so I substitute with other veggies - - snow peas, cauliflower, broccoli or anything else on hand.

Fantastic salad! I followed reviewers' comments for modifications, e.g. white wine vinegar instead of red, grape tomatoes instead of cherry, a little more cheese, adding dill to counteract oregano, etc. Thanks for the helpful suggestions. The picture that accompanies this recipe shows tricolored rotini and artichoke hearts, so I that's what I used as well. Kudos for a great recipe!

kept to the recipe except added marinated artichoke hearts - like the picture shows but was not in the list of ingredients - also switched to kalamata olives (more greek taste) & used Ken's greek salad dressing - so, I guess I didn't exactly stick to the recipe!!! but all other ingredients were the same. everyone said "best pasta salad ever".  I've made it a few times as it is requested on a regular basis.

I made this for myself and live in boyfriend, we both love this salad.This is my second time making this recipe. He does not usually even like olives, or sour cheeses, but he liked this in spite of that because it is so good and the flavors work together so well. I made a couple changes, I too, added a pinch of dry dill weed. I used an extra half tsp.of lemon juice, and used ground oregano instead, but used only half the amount to make up for it. I also used Nicoise olives because that is what we had on hand, and it turned out just fine this way. I make this with the rotini pasta shown, not penne. I bought tri colored pasta, and it works great.I also added just a touch of plain white granulated sugar to the dressing, it seems to help even it out from tasting too sour out too sweet, and made it just right for both our palates. If you made this and found it sour, this tiny bit of sugar should improve it for you. Personally, I also prefer a little more feta.You have tho let this salad sit, covered inside your refrigerator for minimum of three hours for it to fully absorb and meld flavors together fully. It would seem that letting it sit is the key to getting the most from this salad.  We ate this for dinner, and is a filling non meat meal in itself, but can be used as a side also to accompany meats. I really recommend this, it is one of my favorite salads, and I rarely eat pasta salads.

I tasted a spoon full and the taste exploded in my mouth! OMG! OMG! This is the best pasta salad I have ever tasted. I did add grilled chicken to it. This is an all year long recipe! This is great to take for lunch when you do not want to eat heavy during the day. Good job Danielle!

I've made this twice in a month because I almost always have most, if not all, of the ingredients and it makes for perfect lunches during the week.  The dressing is perfect and the combo of vegetables is great (even if you have to sub a little here and there based on what you have in the house.)  Lovely recipe and it only gets better the longer it sits. YUM!

I really like this Greek style pasta salad.  I didn't have any cherry tomatoes so I added 1/2 can each of white kidney beans and dark red ones.  That's what's great about pasta salads...you can add or omit a few things as long as the main ingredients like the dressing and the feta cheese remain! And olives of course, which I usually don't slice.  I just get the small sized ones and toss them in whole.

Delicious pasta salad!  Made it this weekend and it was a big hit with everyone.  Followed the recipe and  just substituted Kalamata olives for the black and added a 12 oz jar drained marinated artichoke hearts.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this recipe and, as other reviewers have said, it is truly the best pasta salad I've ever tasted - and I haven't even chilled it yet! I find it is usually very hard to get any flavour in pasta salad. But this one has it all! I decreased oregano to 1/2 teaspoon since I find it overpowering in high amounts. But other than this I followed it exactly. Thank you!

This is  so good! The first time I made it  exactly from the recipe, and it was super. Made it again and used kalamata olives, added artichoke and dill, and loved it even more. Thanks!

Really good dressing!  I just made this for a quick lunch.  I was out of tomatoes so used some carrots and corn instead and it was still very tasty.  I will make this again.

This is really good & I liked that it had artichoke hearts in because of the picture.  But there weren't any in the recipe. Next time I will add them anyway.

Wow!  This was delicious!  Made this for a dinner party the other night and it was a huge hit!  Because I was pressed for time, I cheated and used bottled Greek dressing but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for posting!

We enjoyed this recipe.  The dressing was quite strong at first but after sitting in the fridge for an hour it mellowed out.  Only thing that was different was the use of gluten free penne.  I will definitely be serving this salad again.

This is a nice, basic, basic, Greek style, pasta salad.  I did reduce the oil a bit and still found it a bit too oily for my tastes (and I even measured the dry pasta to be sure to keep the ratio as written).  We don't like olives, so I left them out, but did add some chopped banana peppers, which were a lovely addition.  THANKS for the recipe, Ms. Laroche!

I adore this recipe - it does make A LOT, but I still always make the full recipe as given because this salad tastes just as good (if not better) the next day. This is the perfect side for anything on the BBQ - steak, chicken, kebabs.

This is a great tasting salad as is.  I think the next time I will try stuffing large pasta shells with all of the other ingredients plus some torn lettuce.  It would be more labor intensive but the presentation would be lovely.

I have been making this recipe from this site for a few years now. The only change I make is adding a whole 16 ounce box of pasta. Otherwise the oil is too much with only two cups of pasta. Extra Feta never hurts either. My 22 year old loves it and so do my 14 year olds.

This recipe is SO easy and SO delicious! I can't even wait the three hours before grabbing a little "sample" :) My only adjustments is that I don't add as much oil, about half a cup instead of 2/3 cup, but that is just me. Better to underestimate though, because you can always add more if you find it needs it! Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I made this for a potluck at work, I doubled the recipe, kept it in the fridge overnight and it was delicious! The only things I changed were I omitted the green pepper and used grape tomatoes instead of cherry. I got many compliments on how good it was. This recipe is a keeper and will be making it again.

Great recipe! tastes exactly like the Greek pasta salad we get from the deli that my family loves!  My only complaint is that it was a little dry, I ended up using about 3/4 cup of olive oil instead of 2/3 cup.  Additionally, I used 6 ounces of feta instead of 4 (but thats just because I LOVE cheese).

I had a great pasta salad from Central Market last week and was looking for a similar recipe.  I googled  forever but decided on this one, and this is it!  Great flavor.  This is definitely going in the recipe bank.

This salad is one of my favorites! I made it to take on vacation to the beach and it traveled well. I think it actually tastes better the next day. I'm in love with this salad

I followed the recipe exactly and made the night before.  I just didn't think it had enough "zip" to it, so I had to adjust a lot of the seasonings to my taste.

This pasta salad is yummy and easy.  I made a few adjustments just due to personal taste.  I don't like bell peppers so I just used half of one yellow one.  I added green onions, radishes, and extra cucumber.  I also added sunflower seeds (my secret weapon in all pasta salads) and dried dill.  Everyone enjoyed it!!

Great, great, flavorful pasta salad - will be mixing up the veggies in it each time I make this, but I definitely won't mess with the dressing...it is exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks!

very good! wish my husband liked it.  It is easy to make, except the 3 hr waiting period.. but worth it.  Next time i will add extra feta cheese.  It makes quite a bit even with only 2 cups of penne, i did use grape tomatoes though, because i bought the wrong ones

Made this as-is, and it is awesome! I think next time I may try adding some garbanzo beans if I use a bigger container. But as it is written, this recipe ROCKS! Thank you!

I made this salad for my daughters birthday party I tripled the recipe but only made double the sauce and that was plenty. Next time I wil decrease the vinegar and decrease the lemon just a tad. .This was simple and yummy. Thanx for posting.

Excellent summer salad!  I made the recipe as is but doubled the amount of feta.  The feta and lemon flavor really make the salad.

Absolutely delicious!!  This is my first time making a pasta salad and I have to say I'm going to stick with this recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I tasted it before putting it in the fridge to chill and it was AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to taste it when it's finally ready!

Made just as is except left out the onions as my husband hates them. I did substitute whole wheat spirals for the penne and used low fat feta. Was perfect! We had it with grilled kebobs, yum!

This pasta salad was fantastic! I used it for a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe. I added some chopped, canned artichoke hearts (not marinated).  And because I did that, I doubled the amount of dressing I made, but didn't need all the additional dressing. I highly recommend this recipe!

I make something similar to this but use kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and a handful of baby spinach in addition.  I also throw in whatever herbs and peppers are growing in the garden at the time so it changes every time I make it.

I thought this recipe was great, I only changed the black olives for Greek olives and added the marinated artichoke hearts because I saw them in the photo. Although they weren't mentioned in the original recipe they were a great addition. I also used raosted red peppers. Took it to book club with raves from all the "bookies."

EXCELLENT!  I've been searching for the perfect greek pasta salad recipe, and this is it.  Excellent without any changes, but I also like it with sundried tomatoes vs. fresh - they don't get mushy, and they kick it up a notch.

Best pasta salad I've ever made! Was great when it was just done, better 3 hours later, and best the next day! Was made for Memorial Day (with and without cheese, there are some people who were invited who don't like Feta) and it went over very well. Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely loved it! Perfect to take to work for lunch the next day...and the day after, and the day after! I added more red wine vinegar because i liked the taste and I would add less red onions since they have such a strong flavor, but other then that it was GREAT!

This tasted exactly like I hoped it would.  Very tasty.  I cut the amount of olive oil in half and added extra olives.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was really good but a few too many peppers for me.  Maybe mine were just really big?  Next time I'll cut back on the peppers, and I'm sure that will make it outstanding.

This pasta salad is wonderful! I reduce the olive oil to 1/3 cup, increased the feta cheese to 3/4 cup, and added a package of Tyson's grilled chicken breast strips. Excellent!

This was an excellent recipe. I used a different pasta and the next time I make it I will cut a little of the olive oil out and add more tomatoes. My family LOVED it!
