So easy and very yummy. The only change I made and would suggest to others is to switch from using regular chocolate frosting to trying sour cream chocolate frosting and it was a HUGE improvement in my opinion. The plain chocolate was way, way too sweet for me. the cour cream chocolate flavor was more subtle.

I found the chocolate frosting to be a little too rich so the next time I made this recipe I used chocolate pudding for the topping and everyone loved it.

Very good!  Everyone I served it to loved it -especially the kids.  It was very sweet so I might omit some of the sugar next time.  Extremely easy and I loved being able to make it the day before.

All I have to say is DELICIOUS!!!!  Yummy and so very easy.  I used the french vanilla pudding as suggested, but used milk chocolate frosting.  I use this recipe often, and it is always a huge hit!!!

My kids enjoyed helping me make this recipe.  We used sugar free instant pudding in place of regular instant.  Turned out great and was a hit at the family gathering we made it for.

This dessert is delicious and simple!  I have made it twice and had to hide it from my husband both times so that there would be enough for our guests.  I did not add the powdered sugar either time and found it tasted fine; I do suggest making the dish 24-hours in advance to allow the crackers to soften.

Also, the recipe works just as well with low-fat graham crackers, fat-free whipped topping, and sugar-free/fat-free pudding mix.  Doing this significantly lowers the calorie and fat content.

This is a classic that is a favorite everywhere I take it. I have also tried a butterscotch icing instead of chocolate or even maple is good. This recipe gives you a lot of options to jazz it up or leave as is.

I debated on whether or not to try this recipie because it sounded too simple but the reviews were very high.  I'm so glad I did, it was wonderful!  I took other's advice and instead of omitting the powdered sugar I put 1/4c in and it seemed perfect!  Instead of waiting 24 hours I would wait 48hours it is absolutely better the longer it is in the fridge and no one can stop snacking on it so I don't think it will last long.  Thanks for the recipie

My whole family enjoyed this!  Really does taste just like biting into a chocolate eclair. I think next time I will only use two layers of graham crackers so the pudding layer is thicker(just my preference). I used milk chocolate pourable frosting and it worked great.  *Tip* - I would recommend making in a glass dish, I never put pudding type desserts in metal pans. Quick and inexpensive to make, plus it is enough for quite a few people.  This will now be a regular in our dessert rotation.

So yummy!  It does require a little planning, though.  You can't just whip this one up at the last minute.  It is worth the wait!

Pretty simple to put together and definitely delicious.  I read another review which said to leave out the sugar, so I did, and I would definitely recommend doing so.  Without the sugar, it was very rich. Definitely needs 24 hrs minimum in the fridge.

this is the easiest recipie, and also the best!  forget baking, this cake "takes the cake"!!!
My guests called me the next day for leftovers.
i'll bet it can be made with low fat milk and cool whip for a lower cal dessert without changing the taste much.
try it, you'll LOVE it.

Delicious. After making it for a picnic on Sunday, my husband requested a batch for our family the next day. It's simple to prepare. The only thing not simple is waiting out the requisite 24 hour chill time.

I made this for my daughters baptism and it was GONE!!! (my husband said he had about 3 pieces) He LOVED it!... for the chocolate topping I melted some chocolate chips with milk on the stove then put it on top (instead of the container of frosting)

This could not be easier to put together. If made a couple days in advance it would be a great dessert to put together for a potluck. I did omit the extra sugar because the custard seemed sweet enough already. I also made a small batch of chocolate ganache because I don't care for canned frostings. The ganache added richness to the dessert too.  I agree with others that this does improve with time. I thought it was best at 48 hours. I like the idea of using sugar free instant pudding too. Thanks for sharing.

I am giving this 4 stars because of the reactions of everyone else.  I like it a lot and would give it 5 stars - it is yummy and easy. But all the family said, "It's good, but you have made better desserts...."  And I did not even get asked for the recipe.

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It is so easy to make and pretty to serve.  It is REALLY sweet, so it will serve a bunch of hungry folks.  I have taken it to many potlucks and have never had any left to bring back home.  I had another version of this dessert, but this one is better, I believe, as it uses more layers.  Also, using the canned frosting works just fine without the added work of making a frosting.  It is very simple and quick to prepare, and best of all (for the summer), NO oven.  Thanks again!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I served it with some coffee and it was a hit.  Next time I will add more graham crackers though.

I tried this with cinnamon graham crackers.  It was good but next time I will try honey.  A few people thought it was a little rich due to all the frosting so next time I will use less.  I do reccomend it and will make it again.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! DO NOT USE STORE-BOUGHT FROSTING!!

This recipe has been a family tradition for years and years. It is TOO DELICIOUS of a dessert to ruin it with store-bought frosting!

This quick and easy chocolate topping recipe tastes exactly like you would find on a chocolate eclair!

1-1/2 cups powdered sugar
3 tbsp butter
3 tbsp milk
2 tsp clear corn syrup
1 tsp vanilla
2 oz. unsweetened chocolate (4 squares of the Baker’s chocolate)

Melt everything on low/medium heat and then stir in the powdered sugar. Pour on top! You will not regret taking the extra few minutes to use this recipe!

Also, this dessert only needs to be refrigerated overnight!

Amended review: I accidentally left out the powdered sugar & I'm glad I did. That would've ruined it. I thought the frosting made it too rich, but everyone else said they wouldn't change it. I also used cinnamon grahams & it was well received.

Very good!  Made it for Easter and it got rave reviews.  I didn't expect it to be so rich, but it was a welcome suprise!   I used a homemade chocolate frosting which I think made it more rich than necessary.

second time around, i used cook and serve pudding and chilled it overnight before folding in the whipped cream, and that was slightly better (but it's great with instant pudding too), which ommitted the totally unnecessary powdered sugar.
fabulous recipe, very rich and yummy.  4 stars because the powdered sugar makes it too sweet.

This is a really easy and wonderful dessert.  At a recent church potluck, everyone wanted to try it and loved it when they did!
