This chili definitely delivers! It is the perfect texture and the perfect blend of sweet and spicy! Made just as is and enjoyed bowl after bowl. I found myself looking forward to getting hungry again just so I could eat another bowl!

Tried to recipe.  I really like it, and so do my coworkers (well, maybe because I am their boss).  I like the fact this is a sweet approach to chili.  However I only used 1/2 syrup.  I also love to kick but will definitely add more jalapeno peppers next time.

I have been using this recipe for 2 years now and it is still a huge hit at my house!  My husband LOVES this chilli and I have also made it for my mom and stepdad who were also fans.  I omit the peppers (but that is just my personal taste).  I think the maple syrup is the secret awesome ingredient in this chili.  I will never make another chili again.  This is by far my favorite and you wont be sorry trying it.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

I made some adjustments to this recipe, but nothing so drastic as to change the integrity of the recipe.  First I cut the recipe in half for a 2-person household.  Had a can of chili beans instead of kidney beans; used a can of tomatoes with chilis; yellow pepper instead of red.  After noting the amount of maple syrup to be added, I knew it would not go over well at our house, no one cares for a sweet soup, so I only used 1/4 cup of syrup.  For our personal taste, I had to add a good amount of chili powder and a few dashes of cayenne pepper to compensate for the sweet.

2 beers and some maple syrup really change the chili game here! I loved this.  Based on what I had, little more than 3lbs beef and only 30oz of kidney beans, I thought the consistency was perfect.  I think any more than that and it would have been too chunky.  This wasn't spicy in anyway and I did the full two jalapenos.  Just a nice sweet and rich chili that holds well as a leftover.

Very good chili.  I can't handle much heat, so I used poblano peppers instead of jalapeno and halved the chili powder and it was perfect for me.  I also only used 2 lbs of ground beef to save $ and it was more than enough meat.

Too syrupy.  I used to have a maple chili recipe that used maple syrup and it was much better. Unfortunately searching for that recipe, I found this one. Way too much syrup.  Too sweet. I wish I could find the other recipe it is 1000x bettter.

Loved this recipe- I did make a few changes that (I think) improve it a little:
Instead of just beef, 50/50 beef/hot sausage
Add 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke
Add 1 teaspoon (really, just one) of Tabasco
Add about 6 times the chili powder
Add 3 times the black pepper
Cut the maple syrup back to 1/4 cup

Definitely needs some editing. Beans have no places in chili, and that is way too much maple syrup (and that's a Vermonter's opinion). Add a bit yes, but not that much...
