Made this coffee cake today, because it sounded intriguing. That whole PBJ thing going on.... and it was relatively easy to whip together. I ran into problems from the outset. First it calls for 1 c sour cream and 1/3 c milk. When I added the two packs of Martha White muffin mix there was not enough liquid to absorb the mix. Made batter EXTREMELY stiff. I have made coffee cakes all my life and never had I had a batter this stiff. SO I added another 1/3 c of milk and this made the dough the consistency I was familiar with. There was WAY too much crumb topping for my tatse. You could probably cut this in half. I baked mine for an additional 10-15 minutes than called for in the recipe because I had increased the liquid content. It was just alright for me. Nothing really spectacular and at one point thought that this would be a big waste of ingredients. I googled this recipe to see if maybe there was a typo in the writing of this recipe on this website and found recipes on Martha White page and Jif. They both called for 1/3 c of milk. I didn't try this as written so I can't testify to the outcome of that, but with my variations, it wasn't bad. At least I didn't have to toss it. I would be interested to see a review written for this who actually followed the recipe verbatim. I just was too scared to.
