These were ok. The lemon dressing and pineapple made the bell peppers and vegetables alil too sweet for my taste. I would've preferred something spicy or sour.

I loved this recipe as written and will use it again and add all sorts of different veggies and maybe shrimp or sausage. So easy and easy to clean up. Perfect for hot summer nights.  The pineapple got a bit caramelized and was very flavorful, too. 
We Loved it!

Tomatoes didnt make it shrivelled to nothing. I used canned pineapple fresh to have larger chunks would be better. I used cremeni mushrooms not a fan may use button mushrooms next time. As for onions i would try wedges or pearl. Served this with teriaki chicken bacon and pineapple and small red potato kabobs. Marinade chicken and bacon in bbq sauce teriaki sauce pineapple brown sugar. Brushed with marinade while bbqing

Followed the recipe exactly but instead of putting on skewers, used my grill basket.  No vegetables left over!  Even for those that don't "love" veggies, they even ate them.

These were fantastic!  The marinade complemented the veggies and pineapple perfectly.  So Delish on the grill and equally as good indoors on a grill pan.  It will definitely get your family and friends who need some encouragement to eat their veggies the exact push needed!  I could eat these every day.  Thank you for this Delish recipe!  Everyone raved ??

Grilled these kebabs over a campfire using Reynolds heavy duty foil and they turned out great! The smoky flavor really made these delicious. Will definitely make again at home as well as when camping!

Using the foil makes it easy to grill the veggies and fruit. No more food falling though the grill. A great way to get your family to eat more veggies.

These were super good and healthy too!  I think the marinade really added a nice flavor.   Using the foil on the grill grates really kept the kabobs from sticking and kept them from falling thru.  This is a perfect summer time side dish that would go great with pretty much anything else  you are grilling.  I made this alongside grilled BBQ chicken and it was a hit with my family.

Loved these! So easy to put together and the pineapple really adds a nice fresh flavor to the plain old kabobs we usually do. Cooking them on top of the Reynold's Wrap on the grill meant we didn't have to worry about losing any bits of veggie that might fall off too! We'll make these again For Sure!

I used canned chunk pineapple and that was a little hard to keep on the skewers.  I had some trouble finding the right size tomatoes at the supermarket.  I don't have a grill, so I cooked the kabobs in the oven and it took at least 25 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The marinade was good but I would probably make a greater quantity of the sauce next time.  Overall the recipe worked and I got many compliments.

These were easy to make, quick to put together and fun to eat!  The pineapple made a delightful taste contrast with the veggies.  We used them as a side dish, but they would be great party fare.  We will certainly make them again.

These kabobs are very flavorful. Served them at a dinner party and guests raved about them.
