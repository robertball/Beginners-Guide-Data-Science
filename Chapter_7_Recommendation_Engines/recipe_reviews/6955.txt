I really like this bread I gave it 5 stars for taste but I'm giving it 3 stars for the directions.  I found I had to find my own way through the directions, it states cook time 1 hour, I found that 30 min. is plenty (I am using a baking stone).  Also regarding step 4, when you separate it and place it back in the bowl to rise once again it becomes one round of dough, so why separate it?  The second time I made it I skip the separating part but did punch down and let rise again, then separated it into loaves after the second rising.  Now in step 6, where it says to turn occasionally, I just skipped that step all together because I found that step too awkward and as far as "done when golden brown" well after 30 minutes of baking the loaves are closer to dark brown, and I'm only baking it in half the designated time.  I really like the taste of this bread and after playing with this recipe several times I now have no problems but I did the first few times I made it.  It seems others didn’t have any problems but I did, so for what it’s worth these are just some of the problems I encountered.

Good recipe, works well if you add a little italian seasonings in with the ingredients.    As a culinary student I've tried and failed with bread many times before getting some decent results.  Here's what I've found that may help some previous reviewers:  1) Proof your yeast as directed (mixing water, yeast, & sugar)-- if it doesn't start bubbling or frothing after 10 min, throw it out.  Either the yeast is dead (check expiration date) Or you killed it with HOT tap water > 120 degrees F kills yeast.  Optimal temp is LUKE warm around 100F.     2) Mist the bread with water every 3 min for the first 10 min.  Why?  This does 3 things.  Prevents the crust from forming too fast thus restricting the rising process.  It moisens the crust just enough so it doesn't brown/burn at the end of the baking period - you get a golden brown instead of a dark heavy crust.  And it  finally makes the crust crispier.  This is a very important step.  It also helps if you have a bowl of water in the oven to increase the humidity percentage.  Professional ovens have adjustable humidity controls which add moisture in.  Why only 10 min?  You can mist for longer but you'll end up with a thin white crust instead of golden brown.  Once the bread has risen to its full potential (within the 1st 10 min or so depending on the size of the loaf), then you want  it to start becoming golden brown.  UPDATE - Bake until internal temp is 200 F - whatever the shape or size.

OHMYGOD. YUM.

Keep in mind that less handling after rising has started, the better the flavor.  My first loaf was good, but after I read up a bit on proper dough handling, the flavor increased tenfold - it went from good to great bread.

Bring the ingredients together and let sit for 15 minutes before you knead to hydrate and relax.  After 15, knead like crazy until smooth like a baby's bottom. Coat with oil, place in a bowl, cover and let rise until doubled. 

INSTEAD OF KNEADING THE LIVING TAR OUT OF THE DOUGH, gently but firmly smoosh the dough out, fold in thirds and press with your palm, fold in thirds and press, fold in thirds and press.  Form a ball, coat, cover, and let rise again.  Divide into two or three loaves (we prefer two larger loaves), fold and press again and shape for final rise.  

Score the loaves, spritz 'em with water, and slide 'em on into the oven.  Pour some water into a preheated pan under the loaves for steam and quickly shut the door (no need for opening and spritzing!).  A baking stone REALLY helps with the crust texture.  I also love using those perforated "professional" loaf pans (sans cornmeal, of course).

Better handling DOES equal better flavor! The difference is amazing!!!

This bread is fabulous-o.  I make bread a lot.  For those of you who have read the other complaints about a sticky bread, this is the deal.  The flour for a bread recipe is always a variable.  Depending on the humidity in the weather and protien content in your flour, the flour can fluxuate 2-3 cups.  I put in 9 cups of flour to get it to be a stiff dough. That is what was meant when she said knead it until it is smooth as a baby's bottom.  Italian breads, pizza doughs, and french breads should never be sticky. Stick with this rule and your family will love your bread and your house will smell great. Best of all you will have really super yummy bread for dinner for really cheap!!!  I made all three loaves and they were gone in an evening.

Bread gets 5+..directions get a 2. This appears to be written for "bakers", which I am not. Here's some info the non-bakers might find helpful!  PROOFING YEAST: put water, sugar in bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top. Let it sit 2-3 mins until it gets bubbly and smells like bread. Then proceed as directed. FIRST RISE: this took 1 Hour in my oven with the light on. PUNCH DOWNS: Gently punch down, remove from bowl onto lightly floured surface. Don't knead it again, just get the air bubbles out. Put back in bowl as directed. Again placed back in turned-off oven with light on.  This SECOND RISE took 30 mins. SECOND PUNCH DOWN: same as above, but don't put back in bowl. Form into loaves as directed (I made two). Place cornmeal only under the bread loaves because excess not underneath will burn when you start cooking it. FINAL RISE: loaves covered with towel, again in "off" oven.. this took 30 mins or so. Then I put on counter and heated up oven(s) to 450 for baking. It took 20 mins to cook them. Very delicious, crispy crust (not crisp today but still wonderful). Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!

This bread was delicious the first time I made it, but novice bread-makers should be warned: this dough is very sticky and hard to work with if you use anything close to the amount of flour listed. You can add more, of course, but then you don't get a truly authentic texture to your bread. For the lucky people out there with bread machines or a food processor with a dough hook to do the kneading, this problem is fairly easily solved. If you do it by hand, like I did...get ready for some sticky dough! I made a half recipe the first time and made into three small loaves, they disappeared FAST with only 2 people eating them!

What did I do wrong?  I am not a novice at baking bread, have been making different breads for quite some time,but I had a problem with this recipe.  When I shaped into "footballs", and let them raise the third time, they expanded, but not height wise, they got bigger but flat.  Help.....C. J.

The taste and texture of this bread is great.  I dusted it with a little flour right before putting it in the oven, and put a pan of water in the oven instead of misting it.  It came out crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside....just the way I had hoped!

This is the second time I made this bread and I thought I'd try making half the batch into rolls.  I pulled off chunks of the dough, lightly rolled it in my palms to make it smooth, let rise as stated and baked for about 20 minutes, misting every 5. After 10 minutes I turned the rolls upside down to finish baking.  WOW were these every AWESOME as rolls!!!! I will be making these again and again!! Thanks!

Get out the bread knife!  Wow, what a crust!  There was a lot of guesswork involved with the rising, but being a virgin bread maker, I think I did alright, because it was tasty!  Thanks Christine, we eat Italian weekly & this will definately be included with our meals!

Very easy to make and it did help having a kitchen aid mixer to knead in all that flour.
I made 2 loaves and 1 section into rolls. Everything turned out delicious. I will be making this bread again for sure. Thanks.

Excellent Italian style bread! 

A few things I did differently:  

I used bread flour for the four cups of flour used in the beginning to make the sponge, and AP flour for the remaining 3cups.  Bread flour, because of its high protein content, results in a chewy bread without being solid or dense. It also results in a thin crispy crust. All-purpose flour gives you a thicker crust.  I found this combo to produce a perfect crumb and crust.

I also placed a dish of water in the oven with the bread to provide a constant source of humidity rather than misting the bread.  This changes the texture of the crust and I prefer it this way.

Also, for those of you who talk about using 9 cups of flour instead of 7:  This will make a very yummy simple bread.  BUT to get the dense, chewy texture of a true Italian style loaf, you need a MUCH stickier dough.  I ended up using ~6.5 cups.  

You can't measure whether the kneading is done in traditional ways, it's too sticky.  That's why the directions say knead until smooth.  When the dough is smooth (no bumps left) and almost taffy like it's ready.  If you have a mixer with a dough hook this is best.  But if you don't, just take 1/3 of the recipe at a time, place in in a large bowl and use a spatula to knead the bread.  
Use the spatula to pull the dough from the sides of the bowl and push it into the center.  This is an arm buster, to be sure.  But kneading by hand with a dough this sticky is just awful (in my opinion).

This is soooooo good!!!!  I am a novice at baking bread, so I relied heavily on the suggestions made by RodneyD (thanks!) and misted the bread for the first ten minutes.  Also, in order to accelerate the rise (for the first two), I used my crock pot - turned on high to get it warmed and then unplugged it when the dough went in.  This made it feasable for me to make this on a week night.  Made 2 loaves (halved the recipe) and threw in some Italian seasoning as well.  These were awesome - best bread I ever made (I keep saying that with each new recipe I try....but seriously, this is outstanding).  Will make this one again for sure!  Also, since the recipe is very vague as to the cooking time, once I put it in the oven, the bread was done in about 25 minutes (for those like me and clueless, that might help)!

Man I love this bread!!!! I have made it many times now and agree with Gray who said not to mess with it too much. I always leave it for 90 minutes the first rise, then an hour for the next two rises. But the last time I made it, I didn't knead it very much after either rise. I just mainly punched it down and did the fold thing for about 2 or 3 minutes. What a difference in the flavor!!!!! A little note about the flour, I have tried bleached and unbleached store brands but have found that King Arthur unbleached is by far the best flavor, color and texture. Lastly, I don't turn the bread for fear of losing the rise, and I use a pan full of water and don't mist. When I shape the bread for the last rise, I hold one end, then kind of pull and twist the bread as I lay it down. This gives more of a log shape than the more flattened out shape you otherwise get. I make 2 loaves and bake for 30 minutes. Comes out perfectly every time. By the way, this bread makes the best croutons you will ever eat. Freezes well too. Thank you Christine for a great recipe and to Gray for the advice to leave it alone!

Very good bread.  The whole family loved it.  For the first rise, I let it rise for an hour at the suggestion of a few bread making websites.  I punched it down, divided, and shaped the loaves and then let them rise just once more.

This was a really good bread!  I love baking, and I am always eager to try new recipes.  I used my Kitchen Aide Mixer and had absolutely no problems...just remember that it IS a really sticky dough...no need to add more flour.  This one is going to become a well used recipe in my family.  Even my daughter, who tends to shy away from "crusty" bread LOVED this!  Wonderful with Balsamic Vinegar and Olive Oil to dip in!!!!

I give this recipe 4 stars.  The bread was very good, however, as others have stated, the directions could have been better!  Having only made bread a few times without a bread machine, I was surprised at how long it actually took the dough to rise.  Some additional information concerning times would have come in handy.  I actually pared down the recipe to 12 servings which made one rather large loaf of bread.  It was more than enough to serve with dinner for four adults and a child.  Thirty minutes on a pizza stone in a 450 degree oven was perfect.  I didn't have a spray bottle to mist with water, so I simply put a pyrex pan with some water on the lower rack to keep the oven moist.  Overall, very good bread.  I'd love to make another batch and use for sandwiches!

This recipe is so easy & turned out PERFECT! I made semi hard rolls instead of bread, to go with the Barbecued Beef recipe. The rolls were nice and crusty. You could make both bread & hard rolls....

This made the perfect rolls to match with some Italian sausage I had made. The crust was crunchy, and the crumb had a good chew to it. But I had to use a LOT more flour than the recipe calls for to get a stiff dough. I can live with that, though, since I thought 7 cups was a little light for 3 cups of liquid. I was going to give it four stars for that, but the result demanded I give it five.

This, quite simply, is the most amazing bread ever. I made it for a party and got rave reviews about this bread from people that never give rave reviews about ANY food, so that's saying a lot. One of my guests ate half a loaf by himself. I baked it on parchment paper (obviously omitting the greasing and cornmeal) and they came out lovely. I will definitely be making this bread again, and again, and again.

This was okay, but fairly tasteless. You may want to add more salt and/or italian herbs. All in all it didn't have much flavor and was a little too flat.

The first time I made the bread I had a couple of different issues - old yeast and I didn't wait long enough for the loaves to rise.  The second time I followed the instructions of some of the other reviewers and got GREAT results!  Here's what I did that worked well for me:

Heated 3 cups of water until it was 110 degrees with an instant-read thermometer.  Dissolved the sugar and yeast thoroughly and waited.  the first time I got very little bubbling after 15 minutes, but assumed any bubbling was good so I went with it - which was a mistake.  The second time I used new yeast and it was foamy within 5 minutes.

For the flour, I used Caputo "00" flour.  The 2.2 lb bag was PERFECT as I used exactly that much for the recipe by the end of it.  4 Cups into the KitchenAid stand mixer with the paddle attachment, along with the water.  I let it mix on #2 until it looked like pancake batter and then let it sit for 15 minutes.

I kept the paddle on and beat in the salt and 2-1/2 cups of flour at #2 until it was all mixed together (scraping the sides of the mixing bowl occasionally).  Replaced the paddle for the dough hook and then added in the last 1/2 cup of flour.  Locked down the mixer and kneaded on #2 until it looked smooth and wasn't sticking to the sides anymore.  I think I let it knead for about 5 - 7 minutes.

Etc... etc...

Most important tip... WAIT for the loaves to rise!  Touch them lightly with finger - if they spring back, not risen enough.  If they stay indented - bake!

This bread was delicious and fun to make.  I bake a bit, but am new to baking breads.  The other reviews were right, the dough was definitely sticky!  But that just made it more fun to work with.  Once I got the stickiness under control, it was smooth sailing.  I followed other reviewers' advice and did the pan of water instead of spritzing and baked it for much less time, and it turned out great!  I'm so excited I made this as my first home-baked loaf of bread!

Good recipe but probably not one for beginners. Since the dough is a little tricky (if making by hand). Very thick crispy crust just perfect for cleaning up any gravy left on your plate! This Italian and her Italian fiance give it two thumbs up!

Amazing! I followed this recipe EXACTLY up until rolling it into your loaf. I rolled then I covered on my pan and froze overnight. Pulled out mid-afternoon the next day and let rise, and baked, OMG, OMG! I couldnt stop eating it! THEN by the following morning I expected semi-dry bread, but it was still crazy moist, and made perfect toast! ! I will be making this many more times! LOVE this bread!

Wonderful!  Just made one loaf (divided ingredients by three).  Let it rest, did one rising, and then the rising on the baking sheet.  Baked at 450 for about 20 minutes and it was great--so easy--a new keeper.

5 stars for taste, 3 for the directions. delicious bread! but... if you add the sugar and yeast to all three cups of water, it doesn't proof right. that leads to problems with the bread rising. the second time i learned to proof it in 1/4 c of water and add the rest of the water later. turned out much better. also, 'knead until as soft and smooth as a bambino's behind'... that really doesn't help me all that much. i went with kneading for 10 minutes. if anyone has any suggestions for a different kneading time, i'm all ears!

This bread had the most AMAZING texture--it was like something you'd find at a good Italian restaurant--crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. The flavor itself was the slightest bit bland, but I was willing to overlook that since I loved the texture so much. I don't have a spray bottle, so I got a pastry brush wet, and flicked the bristles to moisten the bread every 5-10 minutes of cooking time. I think I ended up cooking this for about 20 minutes. I made 4 loaves instead of 3, and froze half of the dough between the second and third risings. This way, I just defrost the dough, set it into shape, allow to rise, and cook. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

SO SO SO SO GOOD!!  I couldn't find sub rolls at the store yesterday, so I made this recipe and cut it into 6 pieces for our italian sausage sandwiches!  WONDERFUL! The recipe forgot to say how long to bake, but mine did well in about 25+ minutes.

Excellent Bread.  My husband ate an entire loaf in one sitting.  I followed the recipe exactly for one batch.  But for my second bath, I substitute about 2 cups of the all purpose flour with whole grain wheat four.  Still very good, and a little bit more nutritious.

I've never made bread before so I was curious and nervous to try this recipe. I'm glad I did! I never would have done it if I didn't have a KitchenAid though. I can't imagine how long it takes to knead by hand! For other beginners, the yeast is proofed when it looks like a just poured beer.

Oh wow, this bread was fantastic! I too used my KitchenAid and I added only about a half cup more flour. The dough was a little sticky, so I floured my board and hands before I started to knead. By the time I was done, the dough was fine. I also added some sesame seeds to the tops of the loaves. Boy, I know my oven is off, but I didn't realize how much until I read how several reviewers only needed to bake their bread for twenty five minutes. Mine took about an hour! I think this was the best bread I've made so far Christine! My bread lovin' family thanks you too for a great recipe!

Have made this bread numerous times and it's always a hit. My only advice is to add a little more salt than called for and don't bother with separating into loaves until the last rise. I put baking sheets with loaves on top of heating pad to facilitate rising

Incredible recipe! I bake bread daily, always looking for new recipes to try, and this one is a keeper.  Only thing I did differently is I omit the sugar as I don't like sugar in my bread.

Fabulous!  Instead of making this the traditional way, I substituted 1 cup of the water with a chia gel mixture for more nutrition  (1 cup of water with 2 tbsp of chia seeds) and it turned out beautiful.  I also painted the tops of the bread with the chia gel.

Nice crust, great flavor!

Outstanding recipe! First time, halved the recipe and made 8 good sized italian sandwich buns. Out of the oven they are super cruncy on the outside. I put then in a plastic bag overnight and they became wonderfully dense and chewy (think Bagel Texture) Flavor amazing, super easy! Second time I added minced onion that I sweated with soy sauce and butter in the microwave (full recipe, 3 small onions, 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons soy sauce) Had no trouble with rising even though I live at a super high altitude. Congratulations! You have found a great bread recipe!

Used this recipe to make pizza bread. Halved recipe and divided dough into 2 parts. Then rolled it out into rectangles and stuffed each with 1/4lb. pepperoni & 1/2lb. mozzarella cheese, rolled them up & pinched the dough closed. Scored top & baked at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes. Had pasta sauce on the side for dipping. Made 2-4 servings. Delicious!

Wonderful! A minor note though is that Scoring your bread really makes a difference. I had never done it (scoring) before, and it was really easy, making my bread look like a master piece.

Two unusual things happened while I was making this recipe. 1)I ended up with something like 8 - 81/2 c. white flour and the dough was so sticky it was nearly impossible to knead, and 2) the final result never browned in the oven.  In years of breadmaking, I've never had either thing happen.  I followed the recipe instructions exactly. Yeast proofed, dough rose each time, but there was no "shaping" going on here. It was basically three blobs on a pan. LOL  Still, the taste was absolutely wonderful. Even my white bread hater tried and enjoyed it.  It's not a recipe I will likely use again, but it was fun trying and even more fun eating! Thanks!

I scaled the recipe to make one loaf, adding 2T vital wheat gluten and a touch more sugar than the scaled-down quantities indicated.  Per reviewer RodneyD's recommendation, I misted the bread with water every 3 minutes for the first 10 minutes, and also placed a pan of water in the oven to increase the humidity.  This loaf turned out great; much better than the French Baguettes I've doggedly labored over!  The crust is golden brown, the inside is chewy and flavorful.  The recipe didn't indicate how long to bake; I baked it for about 20-25 minutes.  Thanks so much, Christine (and RodneyD)!

I've been making bread of over 40 years.  Way too much yeast.  Way too little flour.  And the divide into 3 several times for no reason whatsoever.  The recipe would be closer with 2 cups of warm water rather than 3.  There is so much yeast that it works way to fast to allow this mixture of ingredients to rise properly.  I read one review that was accurate regarding that issue where the user had dough that was flat and spread out over the pan rather than high like a loaf of bread.  If you follow this recipe you will not have bread or anything resembling bread.

The bread itself was good, but directions were confusing - I got hung up on the time.  I wasn't sure approximately how long each rising process should take or why I would separate the dough just to put it back together and let it rise again.  As a pretty new cook, some of those answer may come with experience but that level of detail is incredibly helpful.

At first I was a little (Squirrelly)about the recipe.However, I was able to get through it. After reading other tips on how to rectify the sticky and tacky dough I was quite impressed!Crunchy artisan style bread.Get ready to spend some time with this bread! If you want authentic Italian bread for your dinner table and do not have the time. Stop by Caputo's in Brooklyn.....

Now that's Amore!

Fabulous! This was my first time at Italian bread and my husband said it was some of the best bread he's ever had. The texture was great with a crunchy crust and chewy inside. I made a half recipe and still ended up with two full loafs. Next time, we're going to brush with butter and sprinkle the top with large crystal salt.

Haven't had a lot of luck with this as a loaf of bread, but I think that's my problem, not the recipe.  What this recipe excels at is pizza crust.  Let it sit in the fridge for a day or more and it is the best we've had.  And we've tried a LOT!

This is a very good recipe for Italian bread.  I do have a couple of suggestions.  I do not break the dough apart until after the second punch down.  Rather than misting the tops with water during baking, I spray them with a little mist of cooking spray.  It browns the tops nicely.  Also, cooking for 1 hour is far too long.  The first time I made this bread I naively trusted the cooking time listed, set the timer, and went about doing other things.  I only realized there was a problem when the fire alarm went off.  30 minutes at 450º is quite adequate.

this recipe could not be easier, especially if you have a mixer!

The bread is more tender the more you mix it, and to give it that "bakery feel" you can put corn meal (not polenta) on the bottom, just dip it in and bake.  Also, to give it a darker crust color, an egg wash will work.  to make the crust soft, immediately brush it with butter when taken out.

I've used this recipe for many different things, like bread bowls for soup and I've sliced and cubed it up for stuffing.  Very versatile, and good even for just snacking right out of the oven.  also freezes very well, so you can make several in advance, and use them when you need them.  I wouldn't freeze the dough as you may damage or kill the yeast cultures, but once it's baked it's fine.  remember, there's no preservatives in it, so it will mold in moister climates a lot faster than commercial breads.
another thing you can do to this bread is melt some butter and some granulated garlic (and italian seasoning if you'd like), and during the last few minutes, brush it over the top.

This bread was really good. I baked the bread so that it only yeilded one loaf. I stuffed it with sausage and mozzarella cheese and rolled it up. I topped it off with olive oil and sprinkled it with garlic powder and Italian seasoning...I received rave reviews, my husband ate almost the entire loaf and that is not usual!! I accidentally put the oven at 350 and baked it up for about 25 minutes but it still came out perfect. Will definetely add this to my collection, next time I will try pepperoni or just bake it up as is and dip it into some homemade sauce!!

I modified this bread for my bread machine the 2nd time I made this, I just halved the recipe and added everything into my machine (I was careful to keep my yeast away from the salt). The first time I made this I did make it the 'old-fashioned' way. A nice loaf of bread! Thanks for the post! I love a good home-made loaf of Italian bread. Makes me homesick for this little restaurant we just to get their Italian bread in paper bags and dip it in spiced oil olive.
Note:Added a little extra flour as dough seemed sticky in the machine. Have made this by adding Italian spices/cheese to the mixture also.

Outstanding! I am a novice bread maker & I achieved professional results w/ this recipe & Rodney's review. This bread is perfect for dipping in broths. I served it w/ Killer Shrimp Soup & will have it w/ steamed clams the next time I serve them. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

We really liked this bread!  I didn't have a spray bottle or what ever, so I just lightly brushed water on it with a pastry brush.

seemed simple enough, and tasted great, but the appearance was less than desirable and the very center of the loaves didn't get done.  perhaps I was too impatient with the final rise and baked them too early, i'm discouraged. :(

I've tired forever to find an easy crusty Italian bread recipe and this is the best.  The resting time gave me time to put together an Italian pasta dish to go with it and both turned out perfect!  Thanks Mama D.

I love this recipe as an easy go to Italian bread. I've made it many times. No matter how "wet" or "dry" my flour is or what brand I use, I always need more by usually 1-1/2 cups. As a result I increase the salt accordingly otherwise the bread is very bland. Great recipe for the novice bread baker.

I read most of the reviews before I tried this, and I am glad I did.  The oven temp was WAY too high and the time was WAY too long.  Lower the temp to 350, and time it for 25 minutes and go from there.  The loaves in regular loaf pans is going to take a little longer, closer to 35 minutes, but longer Italian style loaves will be done much sooner.  I did put a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven, but not because I read it here, I bake bread quite often and have used that method for a long long while.  I did take some leftover dough, rolled it out in a big circle, filled the middle with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese, folded it back over and baked it for 25 minutes, ugly, but tasty.

Easy and delicious.  Bread was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Did not have a bottle to mist with, so I lightly sprinkled water before baking and put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.   As stated in other reviews, I needed approx. 2 cups additional flour to stiffen the dough. Loved this bread!!

Incredible.  I seriously cannot believe this came out of my kitchen.  I made it into large rolls for Italian beef sandwiches, and it was the perfect bread.  Super crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  Mine had an English muffin kind of consistency to it, I think because I didn't want to handle it too much and left some air bubbles in-but we really liked it that way.  Instead of misting I used a pan of water underneath as suggested by others.  I don't have a bread maker but I used my Kitchenaid mixer. I am so happy with the outcome and will make this over and over again.  Thank you a million times for sharing!!

I've never successfully made a crusty bread before today- this was amazing! I didn't even spritz water in the oven or put a pan of water in the bottom as suggested. It was amazingly soft and chewy with a delightful crust. Will DEFinitely make this again!

I am giving this five stars because I am not a bread maker. I think the bread taste great. However I baked at 450 and found that after 25min smoke was coming out of the oven vent. I looked and found the crust was starting to burn. I took the bread out and found the crust very hard and the internal temp was overn 200 degrees. I want to do this again but I am not sure how to do it with out getting the hard crust. Can anyone help me. Is 450 degrees to hot for this?

The taste is great but the bread doesn't brown very well.  When I make a batch up, I separate it into mini=loaves and refrigerate all but one loaf. Then I have fresh baked bread all week.

I have made this bread twice now and its been a big hit.  I had never made homemade bread before so I followed the directions pretty closely.  I didn't use the full 7 cups of flour and the baking time was way off for my oven, 30 minutes was plenty.  I didn't turn the loaves while in the oven either because I used loaf pans (stoneware).

Easy 2 make! Luv the humor in the directions:-) Tips: Make a canoe out of foil so dough doesn't spread. In travel section of Wal-mart/Target are spray bottles which is handy to create a crunchy crust.

Awesome and so easy!  My husband who is a very picky eater loved it!  The only thing I did different was not  seperate the dough into three pieces the second time I let it rise.  I seperated into three sections after the second rise and put each into a loaf pan where I let them rise a 3rd time.  Delicious!

It turned out rather well even though I subbed a third of the flour with rustic bread flour. The proofing was phenomenal. Made sure to have the dough quite soft, and brushed/spritzed with water every 3 or 4 minutes three times at the beginning of baking. I halved the recipe, so it took the three joined rounds on 32 minutes to be done. I laid it on a baking-paper-lined, semolina-sprinkled big round cake tin. The temperature I set was between 220 and 210 degrees Celsius, watching to make sure the top didn't get too dark. It turned out a lovely medium brown. Thanks for all the tips, fellow ARers. ^_^

Scrumptious! Great color and texture. Paired with the Toasted Garlic Bread recipe from this site, it made an amazing garlic bread. I also had to use two more cups of flour than called for (9cups total) but I've been making bread a long time and typically just add flour until it looks "right" anyway. Someone mentioned that they prefer two larger loaves and I thought that I would try that. Each loaf was pretty big measuring 3.5"Hx10"Lx8"W. I will definitely divide into three loaves on my next try.

OMG!!!  This is ridiculously good bread!!!  I can't even tell you how good it is!  I cut the recipe in half and used 1 packet of yeast and 1 tsp of sugar in the proofing mix.  I made one large, round loaf which will be very, very good with our French Onion Soup for supper!

I love this style of bread and the recipe and reviewers notes gave me the confidence to try it myself.  I was impressed with the turnout and I've made it over and over again.  A friend recently gave me the gift of "artisan bread" she bought at the farmer's market - it was probably quite pricey - it was the same style of bread, but I liked mine MUCH better!  Thanks for sharing!

Easy recipe, and excellent bread!  I probably ended up using about 8 1/2 C flour in all.  One reviewer said that this is a sticky bread, but with the right amount of flour and kneading, it should not be, and weather and environment play a big part in bread making, so my advice to all, escpecially new bread-makers is don't be afraid to use extra flour.  You will get the proper texture if you work the dough well.  Also, during the second rise, why bother separating?  It will grow back together in the bowl anyway.  This made three small loaves.  I think next time I will make two larger ones with it, but I will definitely use this recipe again!

absolutely fantastic! i had no experience whatsoever making italian bread, and my very first attempt turned out wonderfully. easy to make, delicious to eat. lovely crust, soft interior. we had italian veggie and mozzarella sandwiches for dinner with it, and it held up very well to all the fixings. i was really stoked to have such success with this, and will definitely make it many more times.

MMMM  I changed the serving to 12 so it could be just one loaf and Imake it with the recipe from this site called Italian Spaghetti Suace with meatballs.  Was a great dinner.  I also sliced and toasted it in the toaster oven with butter and garlic powder.  MMMMMM  thanks!

This was so good, and much cheaper to make than buying an actual Italian loaf from the nearest bakery. Instructions were a little hard for me to follow at points, being a beginner chef, but this turned out quite well in the end! Next time I will try baking some cheese in there, if possible.

I just recently purchased a Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  I am having so much fun making homemade bread because the machine does all the work!  I noticed the dough was a little sticky but after adding more flour it came together just fine in the mixer.  I actually had nothing to use to mist the loaves with so my bread did not come out quite right but it was still good.

Ok, I have made this 3 times. First time the bread was to die for. The second time I used all whole wheat flour and it was aweful. The third time I used white flour and it turned out not as good as the first time. Im not sure why. I will make this again some time when I have the time. I dont think I changed anything on the recipe.

Well I didn't find this recipe all that great. I have been making home made bread since I was little with my mother. If you are a first time bread maker this is not the recipe for you. I thought it would have been more helpful had it given time frames for rising and cooking. The dough was really gooey the first time around and it didn't rise as much as it should have. I winded up putting it outside in the hot Florida heat, which worked much better than the oven. I also use olive oil while kneading so it's not so sticky. I added some italian herbs to this for more flavor. It came out ok, just not the way you would think.

I had problems with my dough not rising enough, then falling when I went to put it into the oven (it stuck to the cloth).  Once done it was so hard I could not eat it, my husband joked that it could be used as flat bread.  He said it taasted good, but the crust was really to hard to eat.

Delicious! I made an "Italian" dinner for my hubbie and he LOVED the bread. It was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. We dipped the bread in baslamic vinegar and olive oil. I cooked it on a pizza stone (heated for 15 minutes). Since I didn't have a spritz bottle I threw a few ice cubes in the oven about evey 5 minutes. The bread was done in 30 minutes and perfect. I will be making this again!

This bread is absolutely awesome! I made it this morning exactly as stated and it turned out perfect. I wish I had started a second batch when i set this one to rise. Well worth the time and slight effort. Not sticky if you add enough flour before you start kneading and while kneading if neccesarry. If you knead the dough long enough it does get smooth. Wonderful bread! we're having it with speghetti tonight.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I made this tonight for some new friends. I selected this bread to complement the Italian pasta dish I served. The bread was definitely a hit. I sent them home with 1 loaf and kept the 3rd for tomorrow. (We want to try it with butter and honey for breakfast.)
I am very pleased with this. I had never baked a loaf of Italian bread before. It does remind me of the rustic bread served in one of my favorite restaurants.
The only "problem" I had was that it only took about 25 minutes to bake. That is less than 1/2 the time the recipe calls for. I'm thinking that it would have been "toast" if I had baked it that long. This was my first attempt at baking bread and maybe it will be different the next time, but I'm thinking anything baked at 450 degrees for 1 hour would be burned. Also, even after reading some other reviews and adding extra flour, it was still fairly sticky and never did get as smooth as a bambino's bottom. Still, it was REALLY good.

MOMMA MIA !  This is not safe to have around the house if you or anyone else is on a low-carb diet !!!  This bread is addictive.  I added a couple of tbls. of Olive Oil to the recipe.  I've made this bread twice, and both times it came out perfecto. Thank you.

This is a great tasting bread, though
it does take time to prepare. The next
time I try it, I am going to make the
dough one day, let it rise overnight,
and bake it the follwing day. The taste
of this bread is extraordinary, and
rivals the Italian Bakeries where I 
grew up in the Bronx! WELL worth the 
effort, and fairly easy even for a
beginner like me! Mangia!

This was amazing bread! My family could not stop raving about it. Nice crust, with a soft, chewy center. The only change I made was to place a 1/2c of water in cake pan on the bottom shelf to create extra steam. This bread was probably the best I've ever attempted.

I used Gold Medal All Purpose flour and for the three cups of water adding 7 cups of flour is not sufficient to get a stiff dough.  I found myself adding more flour trying to get it to stiffen up before I just gave up and used it as is.  I used a dough hook with a stand mixer and after adding what looked like one additional cup of flour (total of 8) the dough was still wet and sticky....very hard to handle.  The splitting of the dough into three parts I surmised was for 3 separate loaves so I put them in 3 separate bowls. My breads did not rise much which I attribute to a problem with my yeast. For me the finished product had a very hard shell but the inside was pretty good although bland.  I think the recipe should call for more salt added to the dough.

I have never been this successful at making bread before! Very easy, except no cook time mentioned. 20 minutes was good for mine, but I used a meat thermometer & checked when it reached 200 inside as suggested by a comment. Excellent :)

This make a great Italian bread.  My suggestion for anyone who is not an experience bread maker is :  Make your first loaf with 4 cups of flour. This gives you a good size loaf.  When making any bread, do not add all of the water called for at first. I started with 1 cup of warm water into which I had proofed my yeast with 1 tsp sugar. (If your yeast is fresh, I still wait 5 minutes till I see bubbles form on the top; with instant yeast this happens very quickly.)  Add the yeast/water to the flour and mix with a wooden spoon or by hand. Keep adding a little bit of water after that at a time and keep mixing until the entire flour mixture sticks together. You want all the flour in the bowl and for the mixture to stop sticking to your hand. If you wind up with too much water, add more flour till the dough is no longer sticky but feels smooth and satiny to your hand.  Do not overKnead or tough can become tough. Coat with olive oil and then put plastic wrap on the dough and cover with a towel. Let Rise.  Punch down after an hour. No need to take out of bowl. Let it Rise again, 30 min or so; Remove from bowl, gently flatten into rectangle, fold bottom third up, top third down, and then fold in the left and right edges to form a loaf. Turn over and let rise once more. Then bake on baking tray. I put water in oven and you can also mist it but its not necessary. The basic recipe is great. You just have to play with the technique that works best for you. MineHad a great yeasty taste!!!

Loved it.  I'm not a beginner bread-baker but I'm not very experienced either.  I used my KitchenAid dough hook for the majority of the kneading so that made it pretty easy.  I let it rise 3 times as directed.  However, I did not mist it.  I have used steam baths in the past but last time my bread got CRAZY crusty so I tried without anything this time.  It felt really hard coming out of the oven but softened up as it cooled.  I'm missing that crispy crust a little but it still tastes amazing.  The texture is terrific. Yayyy bread!

The directions were a little confusing. I added an addition cup of flour to get  the correct consistency,  don't divide the dough while it is in the bowl, it just amassed back  together and only bake at 400 for 30 minutes!

I just made this bread for dinner. The result? I had to cut into the second loaf :-D I made three loaves and baked them on a baguette pan. They puffed up nicely, had a nice crust and wonderful texture. Definitely will make this again!!! Don't forget the salt. It really does make a better bread! I let the bread rise until doubled, gently punched it down, turned it over and let it rise again. I took it out of the pan, divided it into 3 pieces and rolled into logs to fit the pan. I let that rise until almost double, brushed the top with water, slashed each loaf a few times and baked @375 for ~35 minutes. I also put a small pan of boiling water in the oven before I put in the bread.

Like others, I found that one hour was twice as long as it actually takes. My first attempt the bread was way overdone. I actually removed the hard crusts and used it to make holiday stuffing, so at least I didn't waste it. By reducing the cooking time and ignoring the first suggestion to divide it (WHY?) it came out great. Also, the third time I used bread pans and it worked well too.

This is the second time I made this recipe and it turned out 5x better than the first time I made it.  This (2nd) time, I took the tip to mist the bread every 3 minutes for the first 10 minutes.  Although, I didn't have a spray bottle, so I just sprayed water with my fingers over the bread every 3 minutes for 10 minutes..  I also followed the other tip of putting a hot pan of water in the oven to create humidity.  These two tips helped this recipe dramatically.  Just enjoyed 2 slices right out of the oven with butter - omgosh so delicious.

Tried using a bread machine the first go-round, but the result was a very dense load. The next time, I stayed true to the recipe and was really pleased.

Super!  i usually make this on the weekend for the family to have nice fresh bread and it definately only lasts the weekend.  Thanks for the recipe.  

PS - I mix/knead the dough in my bread maker (on the dough seting) and then do the 2nd rising in loaf pans.

Fantastic recipe!  Thank you so much, it's our new favorite.  I've even saved the dough in the fridge for 2 days to let the gluten develop and made wonderful pizza dough with it.  Oooh, and rolled it out with butter, cheddar cheese and deli ham for breakfast rolls.  Delicious!

We live in Georgia, having moved from CT in June 2011. We have not been able to find the perfect italian bread anywhere near where we live.  The bakeries around here are primarily in the grocery store. I tried this recipe and found I can make Italian bread. Its texture and taste are like New York bakery style bread.  I also used this recipe to make NY style hardrolls with Poppy seeds.  OH MAN!! Still miss our roots in CT but this receipe is  like being home. Thanks Mama D... :)

I made a loaf at 4 oclock, it was done by 6 and was gone by 7. Absolutely, hands down the best bread I have ever made. I will only make this bread now.

Made this the first time this wednesday.  Served it with a hearty Italian soup and the company ate a whole loaf.  The other two loaves were gone by Friday and I am making more today at my wife's request.  Great bread and easy to do.

This was delicious and easy, you just need to give it enough time. The bread was nice and salty with a crispy crust. I halved the recipe, made 2 smaller loaves and it was perfect for dinner and a little extra to snack on. I baked it on an ungreased stone. Tonight I'm going to try bread bowls!

A novice bread maker (by hand), I tried this recipe and found the bread to be dense much like a peasant bread w/a good crust. I used a cookie sheet w/water beneath the bread in lieu of misting (much like the german brotchen method). I learned about proofing (oven light) and should of used a loaf pan as it flattens out. I also used 7c of bread flour vice all purpose flour and more to knead as req'd, about 8 c in all which may have been a bit much. Any workarounds to get it to be less dense would be appreciated.

I have been having terrible luck lately with my bread. It keeps coming out extremely dense. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I am going to keep using this recipe though, the flavor of the actual bread is great! It just isn't what "Italian" bread should be. I think it is something in my process and nothing lacking in the recipe itself.

I had a ball making this bread and it came out delicious! I didn't change much, if anything, to the recipe or the way I baked it. It was delicious! I brought them to a wine and cheese party and it was a big hit. I also made my own seasoned oil to serve with it. Excellent recipe!

WOW!!!! This is THE BEST bread I have ever made!!! I made two batches and followed the directions to a T, except one batch I added Italian seasoning. I placed a dish of water on the bottom rack and baked the bread on the baking stone. I just took them out of the oven 5 minutes ago, and one roll is already gone! Let me tell you, they are out of this world! Gotta try it!!! I will be making this for my mother next time she visits!!

This was my first attempt at any type of bread and I was very pleased.  I did exactly as the recipe was written with the exception of only making two round loaves.  We enjoyed it greatly!!  A definate keeper and now I won't have to run to the bakery whenever I want Italian bread.   Woohoo!!!  Thank you.

Good flavor. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a very sticky dough to work with and I used the the stand mixer with the dough hook too. Also didn't rise as high as I would have liked. The yeast may have "lost steam" by the time it rose two times prior!  Will make again.

Very good classic bread. It tastes delicious right out the oven and is good as toast & on crusty grilled cheeses (my fave).  The second time I didn't need to make so much bread so I scaled the recipe down to 1/3 of the original. As well, I substituted 1 cup of white flour for 1 cup of white whole wheat flour (King Arthur). Instead of misting the bread, I placed a pan of water at the bottom of the oven. And to get a thick crust I baked the bread in the oven in a preheated enameled cast iron pot (25 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered). The results were SUPERB! Would definately make it that way again. The resulting bread is denser because of the whole wheat flour and the cast iron pot method, but I like it. It still tastes good as grilled cheese, so I'm happy!

The best thing about this bread is the excellent hard crust and soft middle.  But it was a difficult dough to knead by hand and too lengthy of a process for rise times. I also was not overly impressed with the flavor.  I even added garlic powder (as recommended by other reviewers).  This is a dipping bread.  We ate it with my homemade beef stew and it soaked up the gravy nicely.

THIS RECIPE WAS AWSOME!!! If you've never made bread by hand before.. it's actually very easy! This was my first time making bread by hand. I followed the ingredients exactly but I used all the suggestions in the reviews, below the recipe, for how to make it. Thanks guys for all the GREAT tips! I do have a bread machine but making it by hand definatly taught me something about how to make bread and what it should feel like and the taste was just so much better than bread from the bread machine. I made 2 large loaves, one I cut up and used for garlic bread that night and the other we ate right out of the oven warm w/ butter on it. OMG.. It was amazing! I knew from the start that this would be a great recipe when I read in the directions to "knead until as soft and smooth as a Bambino's behind!" LOL... Thanks Mama D!!!

Great flavor. I halved the recipe and made two medium sized loaves. Think I overcooked it a tad because the crust was a little too thick; I've never sprayed my bread with water while cooking and I must have overdone it. Update 7/2014: Made this again, cut the recipe in half again. Cooked on my pizza stone in convection oven (425)... Did stick a bit to my stone, not enough cornmeal around the edges :) made three smallish loaves, which got too wide and stuck to each other so I had tender edges, soft and yummy and made a great meatball sammie! Only took 15 or 20 minutes, sprayed at 5 and 10 minutes.

In the original caption it reads "...you can freeze what you cannot use or give them away to your friends." NOT ON YOUR LIFE - THEY'RE ALL MINE AND I'M EATING THEM NOW!!!! I did only make 2 larger loaves with the intention of eating one with dinner tonight and giving the other loaf to the people upstairs, but they've only been out of the oven for 20 min and 3/4 of one loaf is already gone. I'm contemplating on making another batch. The salt factor is a personal preference, since so many reviews reduced salt I did as well ~ next time I think I'll use the full amount. If you like a very crispy crust there are 2 things that you can do, 1~ spray with water every 2 min during the first 10 min of baking or 2~ re-warm the bread for 5 min just before serving. I always place a pan of water on the bottom rack when baking bread, but I was watching a movie when it went into the oven so I didn't mist it as well so my crust came out on the soft side, but after completely cooling putting it back in the over for 5 min made the crust crispy like my husband likes it. In the next loaf I'm going to try adding some garlic and herbs to the mix for different flavors. I will definately make this again and again.

The taste of this bread is superb! Absolutely perfect, just the right amount of chew and lightness. I scaled the recipe for two loaves rather than three, and used bread flour. I needed to add about 2 cups more than the recipe recommended. I baked for 30 minutes at 450 and found that the crust was a bit overdone. Also, while my bread rose nicely and as expected prior to baking, in the oven it rose outward rather than upward. Might be better in a bread pan than on a cookie sheet.

This bread was very good!  I think if I make it again I will not make the full recipe, as it makes so much bread (I've served it 3 times and still have 1 loaf in the freezer!)  But the directions were excellent and it made my first time italian bread a success!

I used this recipe to make 2 large round loaves. I found this to be a tad bland on its own, even with the added Italian seasoning. But perhaps Italian bread is supposed to be that way? I misted the crust with water every 3 min for the first 10 min and it turned out nice and golden brown.

I really like this recipe, and I'm making some for my family's Italian Thanksgiving with some italian-seasoning-butter brushed on. (following another reviewer's advice for a lighter crust).
I have a question though- Is it supposed to be only an inch or two high? My bread only rises that high.

This is a pretty forgiving recipe. Many of the other reviews posted were very helpful (I never heard of the water misting every few minutes and it worked great, and thank god I didn't leave in the oven for a full hour).  I used the kitchen aid mixer to knead the dough, but should have done it by hand because the dough ended up being too sticky.  Hand kneading is definitely the way to go.  I didn't have any cornmeal to put on the pan so I just used olive oil and it didn't burn at all.  Took about 20 minutes to get that perfect golden brown color.  I tried to cut the recipe in half and decided to make one giant loaf....mistake!  I ended up with a wide and sorta flat slab that took up almost the entire span of the oven.  I will try this again, but would like to add some herbs (thought it was a bit flavorless and since I would not go through all this trouble just to sop-it-up in some sauce, I think it needs a slightly stronger flavor). I would like to try and shape it into personal sized bread sticks or rolls as well.

Well, this was wonderful!  Over the centuries (LOL), I've struggled with making Italian bread.  The flour quanity is a touch kinda thing, add until it is not too sticky.
I use the instant yeast, so no proofing!!!!!!!!!!!
Just remember to increase the water tempeture to 180*.
I served this with an eggplant casserole to my Italian parents and my twin, delicious!!!!!

Wow - what an amazing recipe!!  I loved it - the bread comes out flavourful, moist, and just plain perfect.  A tip for first timers:  each time the recipe says to "let it double" - one hour is usually sufficient.  Thanks!!

Taste- 3.5/5.
Appearance-4/5: Had a nice smooth and brown crust very unlike the one in the pciture. Hopefully I can upload a picture of it soon.
Proofing- 3/5:Dough rose very well. I proof dough in the oven with the oven light on. But after the first rise, the bread's moisture content had increased. The dough seemed to sweat and became very gooey.
Texture-3.5/5:Bread had very nicely distributed holes. On the downside the bread wasnt as soft as bakery bread.
Crust- 4/5:This bread had the thinnest crust for any bread that I have baked, which is what I like.Didnt spray with any water--just brushed with oil.
Bake time- I actually only needed 25 mins of baking time.
I reduced the amount of salt to 1 tsp.

This bread is the best.  I LOVED it.  Another reviewer mentioned it taking a long time to rise, so I used 1-1/2 tablespoons yeast.  It turned out crusty on the outside (but not too hard) and soft and chewy on the inside.  I will be making this for the rest of my life!  Can you tell that I love bread?!

I mixed up this dough with the intention of making some pizzas to put in the freezer. I made one test pizza using 1/3 of the dough. Even tho it came out looking beautiful, the crust was too tough and chewy. The remaining 2/3rds of the dough sat in my fridge in a ziplock bag for 3 days before I got around to making one large loaf and baking it. Mostly I just did it to get it out of my fridge. I expected to end up throwing the bread away because after all, it had been neglected and chilled for 3 days. To my surprise, it turned out to be delicious. We're having the last of the loaf as warm garlic bread tonight. I'm looking forward to making this recipe again..as bread, not pizza dough!

Pretty good. Very easy to make, but did not come out like Italian bread, to me. The texture was very much like sourdough bread - very dense and chewy, but without the sourdough flavor. Crust was a very light color, and not so much crunchy as chewy. May try again to see if it is my technique, but also still looking for perfect Italian bread recipe.

This bread recipe turned out a little disappointing to us. It was not as light as I was hoping. Perhaps more yeast is called for. I am going back to any own old recipe.

This was excellent.  I admit I changed it a great deal... I used honey rather than sugar, and I threw some mozzeralla cheese into the dough along with various spices.  I also baked it for 25 min on a pizza stone and followed another reviewers idea of throwing ice in the stove since I didn't have a mister either.  It was awesome.  Next time I want to add more salt to the dough however.  I took to heart others opinions that it was too salty so I cut it down a bit.  Mistake!  This is excellent bread.  So good.

Yum!! I'm a first time breadmaker and it still came out great! It took forever to rise though. I did add about a cup more flour to the recipe. I didn't have cornmeal, but it was fine... I added sesame seeds to the top of one, it was great! It only needed to bake 20 minutes or so. Thanks for a great recipe, I'll be making it again!

Very easy and delicious, with an excellent crust.  I have tried this recipe twice and it has been a hit both times.  The second time I made only 2 instead of 3, and it still turned out just fine.  Great for dipping in olive oil with spices!

This was the best Italian bread I've ever had!  I wasn't sure if it would turn out right, because the last cup of flour clumped up and didn't want to mix into the dough, but I worked my way around the problem, and the bread turned out wonderfully.  It was delicious overall, but the crust was the best part, I think.  I will definitely make this again!  Although, next time, I think I'll use bread flour instead of all-purpose, and I'll only use 6 cups instead of 7.

I used the dough setting on my bread machine, and made half of the recipe.  Love the crust!  I coated one with 'everything' as in "everything bagels".  At 450 degrees, my cornmeal was smokin'! and it only took 25 minutes.

I halved the recipe (all but the sugar) and shaped two smaller loaves.  The texture and crust reminded me of the artisan peasant breads I pay three dollars a loaf for at the bakery!  I also baked each loaf for 20 minutes at that temp, and misted every two minutes or so.

I made this to eat with spaghetti, and ended up dumping my spaghetti noodles back into the pot so I could eat just sauce and bread LOL!

This spreads as it rises, so not a mile high loaf.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This bread had a really good flavor. I mixed with my mix master and it worked great. I thought dough was a bit sticky so I worked in another cup of flour. Rose it in a warm oven,just on warm setting and I did get some dried out spots on my dough, so I think I will rise the conventional way next time. Made 3 loaves. Didn't have spray bottle, so I just dabbed on water and put a small corning bowl with water in it in the oven with the bread. Make sure you use  something heat resistant so it doesn't break. Baked for about 25 minutes. Came out very crusty with a dence and heavy texture. It seams like it dried out quickly the next day. I will make this again and try it with the 7 cups flour as stated or maybe half the recipe. Maybe I might try making 1 really BIG loaf! Thanks Christine, we enjoyed it!

THIS IS THE BEST.  We live in the south now and have missed NY Bread...This is it.  I scaled down the recipe to make 1 loaf since it was my first try.  Came out excellent!!!! I have made a loaf every night for the past week.

This bread has become my 'standard' bread recipe.  I'm a beginner and I love it.  I've varied it by adding roasted garlic to it or olives and it comes out great!!!   Takes a long time to make but worth it.  Makes a lot of bread but I give some away to neighbors or friends... or freeze it.

This recipe is the best Italian Bread recipe I have found.  It freezes well and the texture is the "real thing".  The loaves can be made small and unused loaves frozen - it freezes well- tastes wonderful!!    Dee

I'll echo the other reviewers as far as the directions being a bit vague, that being said I'm a relative bread newbie and i've not yet had any big issues with this bread other than getting  that perfect crust. Which I achieved by using a dutch oven (lid on) to bake the bread.
*** Bread is temperamental and recipes are guides ***
The dough is indeed very! sticky, you'll need to add extra flour or less depending on your elevation and the humidity of that day, I can add little extra flour in winter and loads more in the thick of summer to get it "smooth as a bambinos behind". I only add enough to make the dough soft and workable but not stick to your hands like glue, then toss it in my well greased bowl, rise, punch, rise, punch and shape, rise again and cook.  
If your loaf is flat then you had badly proofed yeast or overworked dough.

5 for bread, less for instructions.  If I had never baked bread before I think I might have been lost. I formed 4 smaller loaves after the first rise. I also followed someone's suggestion to mist every 3 mins for the first 10 & my crusts were perfect. Using instant yeast start to finish took just under 2 hours. I baked my smaller loaves 23 minutes & checked internal temp [200] per another reviewers suggestion. I did use kosher salt & probably used a bit more than called for. Over all a winner! Thanks!

Really good! I was lazy and did not knead the bread at all - just mixed energetically with a spoon for a few minutes and it was still good. It perhaps did not rise as high as it otherwise would have but tasted great! I am on holidays in another country where it is not easy to get nice bread, so it was an extra bonus. Thank you! People's additional suggestions and advice were great too!

A Perfect Italian loaf!!! After reading this recipe I was hesitant due to the lack of ingredients but decided to give it a whirl because of the number of reviews. Let me start by saying my husband thought I bought it at a bakery. With its Crispy flaky outside and it's tender airy chewy insides and just tang for flavor this bread was a perfect accompaniment to the gumbo I made for dinner. Quite honestly it was just perfect by itself 2 slices after my dinner was already eaten. Instructions were followed to the letter and I couldn't be happier. So tired of ending up with dense hockey puck leaves that no one wants the next day.

I only made a third of the recipe.  Because of time constraints, I didn’t do a double rise before shaping the loaf, just a single rise.  Also, I omitted the fifteen minute wait before adding the salt and remaining flour.  I didn’t bother spraying the loaf; I simply put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.  So despite these short cuts, the bread came out excellent and everyone enjoyed it.

Just tried highly impressive. I cut the recipe in half, just my hubby and myself. He'd been whining about wanting me to try an Italian bread I told him I'd see what I could do! Wire. Great easy recipe to follow. I thought oh no crust is too dark it's going to be hard. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It's slightly crunchy and a pillowy inside. Excellent.

The bread recipe is pretty standard as far as what goes into making bread.  I had to add much more flour than what is given in the recipe but after several additions (lost track of just how much flour is needed - probably more like 8 1/2 cups) I got it to work.

Baking on a pizza stone makes this bread even better.  Just let it rise on parchment paper that has been sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with semolina flour.  Place parchment paper directly on preheated pizza stone.

1.5.14 - Made this bread for bruschetta.  I completely forgot to add salt, but I still have high hopes for it!  It just came out of the oven, and the loaves are HUGE!  I usually can't get this much rise out of bread.  (All rises were done in an oven that had baked muffins not too long before.)

Per Gray:
Coat with oil, place in a bowl, cover and let rise until doubled. INSTEAD OF KNEADING THE LIVING TAR OUT OF THE DOUGH, gently but firmly smoosh the dough out, fold in thirds and press with your palm, fold in thirds and press, fold in thirds and press. Form a ball, coat, cover, and let rise again. Divide into two or three loaves (we prefer two larger loaves), fold and press again and shape for final rise. Score the loaves, spritz 'em with water, and slide 'em on into the oven. Pour some water into a preheated pan under the loaves for steam and quickly shut the door (no need for opening and spritzing!). A baking stone REALLY helps with the crust texture. I also love using those perforated "professional" loaf pans (sans cornmeal, of course).

Per LDALLAS:
First rise: 1 hr in oven with only light on
Second rise: 30 min, same conditions
Loaf rise: 30 min, same conditions
Then preheat oven and bake at 450F for approx. 20 min.

Agreed on the directions being kind of strange.  I cut the recipe down to 2 loaves.  I only let it rise once before forming loaves, and couldn't let it quite rise for another hour due to time constraints.  I took the advice of many here and put a pan of water in with the bread.  I also used a pizza stone to cook the loaves on.  The bread turned out more dark brown than golden, so I think I will cook it at a lower temperature for a little longer.  Very good recipe though.  My friends who have spent considerable amounts of time in Europe absolutely loved this bread (and talked about how much it was like the bread they had over there).

I just made this bread and it was delicious!  I agree with others that separating the dough after the first rise isn't necessary since it will become one big ball again during the second rise.  I also didn't have any cornmeal so I just sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese on the pan instead.  I baked it for about 30 minutes but next time I'll check it at 20 or 25 minutes.  I can't wait to turn this into pesto bruschetta for Sunday dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Recipe achieves the look, taste, and feel of italian bread.  The only drawback is that I needed more flour to make it into a managable mass.  I'll definitely try it again!

Excelent, extremely tasty. Had to guess on baking time. For the benifit of those viewing, at 450 degrees it took about 15 minutes give or take to produce a crusty outside, and chewy inside. Very much like you'd find at great Italian restaurants. Top notch recipe!

I used this recipe as a base and it came out really well. I added a few tablespoons of flax seed, substituted 2 of the cups of all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour, and folded the dough instead of kneading it after every rest. I put a pan of boiling water under the baking sheet, and didn't have to mist the bread while cooking it.

This bread is great.  The bread is half eaten literally 3 min after it gets out of the oven.  Question, has anyone tried making this bread with bread flour instead of all-purpose?

First let me say I'm addicted to good Italian bread. I used to live near Philadelphia, and it was very easy to get good Italian bread at every bakery since that region of the US has a large population of Italians (I'm 1/2 myself). I just moved to Houston and I haven't seen Italian bread anywhere just yet. I've gotten to opportunity, but I've been home sick for good Italian bread... and Herr's Potato Chips (but thats a completely separate issue!~)

I decided to try this as a novice bread maker and I thought it came out perfect- although I probably should have tried to "Tame the shape" just a bit more- as it turned into a mutant blob thats proving quite difficult to make a good cut of. The directions also weren't very clear about how long you should bake a loaf- so I tried to make my best judgement- but as a novice it wasn't too easy. Another 5 minutes would have been perfect to get the ideal internal fluffiness. The crust was perfect though- nice and thick with lots of flavor. Its a shame I don't have a proper bread cutting knife! I thought I was going to chop my fingers off making a straight cut!

I ended up making a grilled cheese on small cuts, and of course plan on using the rest as a side dish with pasta later this evening. Pasta just doesn't taste right without good bread.

After I had great success with making pretzels on a rainy day, I decided to push my luck and try to bake some bread. I've never baked bread before, but a friend of mine really loves it and I've watched him, so I figured it was worth a shot. 

For never having made bread before, I was surprised at how well it turned out! I didn't have any problems with the dough being too sticky, possibly because it was 99% humidity today and I'm 1,700 ft above sea level. I used unbleached all-purpose flour because I used up all the other flour on my pretzels; it didn't taste any different to me. After the second step, I added the flour a cup at a time until it was the desired consistency (3 cups). Kneading was a bit tough, but I eventually got it down to "a bambino's behind" :) I was confused about the 4th step, so I just punched it down into a rectangle and cut it into thirds. For the 5th step, I used corn meal mix because that's what I had on hand. I doubt it made a difference, but I thought I would mention it. I also made sure I misted it every 3 minutes for the first 9 minutes as another commenter mentioned. It only took 30 minutes to bake to an internal temp of 200ºF.

My biggest mistake was in not smoothing the dough out enough after punching it down. The loaves were a bit crinkly on the bottom, but at least they tasted great! I spread some garlic butter on a slice and it's incredible. Excellent recipe and thank you for hooking me on bread making!

Just follow the recipe and you'll get a great bread, took about 30 minutes in the oven. Nice hard crust with a great tasting middle.

I think it would be helpful to know how much flour you add after the initial 4 cups.  This turned out heavy, really didn't rise very wellbut a very nice taste.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I added 9 cups of flour as some reviews mentioned and still couldn't get the right texture. Also, I felt there was a lack of flavor.

it seemed simple enough, but as a bread-making novice, i had to unearth my baking textbook from culinary school to read up on bread making technique, because the instructions were rather unclear. The resulting bread, either as a result of my inexperience, or the recipe itself, was dense and heavy... I didn't mind it, (especially dipped in some seasoned olive oil) but my husband thought it was too dense. I'm willing to try it again, but the hubby would rather I didn't.

Love the bread. I added some different herbs (sage, basil, oregano) and chedder cheese to be creative. The only thing was the directions-- rise times, etc. I also skipped the misting and flipping.

Good basic recipe. I only had to bake for 25 minutes though. I tried putting a ramekin of water in with the bread but it still got a little too crusty for me. Next time I'll try misting it. Overall, fairly easy and less work than some other breads I've made. I also cooked mine on a SilPat and didn't mess with the cornmeal. I ended up using about 2.2 lbs of flour (8 c.) plus some for dusting/kneading

The recipe was easy and produced some nice loaves of bread.  They came out nice and dense which was exactly what I was looking for.  However the cooking time listed in the instructions is a little off.  By 30 minutes in the oven they were very brown and done.  Also, as someone else wrote in their review, any extra corn meal not directly under the bread started burning.  If the bread did take an hour to bake, the kitchen would have been full of smoke.  Overall an easy recipe for some nice heavy bread.

This is a very good Italian bread.  It turned out great with the addition of Italian seasonings and a pizza stone.  I didn't divide the dough into 3 until the final rise and just put some water in the oven instead of spraying with water.  Next time I think I will add a tablespoon on oil to soften it a little.

Loved this bread.  The outside was crispy, inside soft and chewy - oh so good.  Don't be afraid to kneed in more flour, I used an extra 2 cups to get the correct consistency.  This should not be sticky, it should be a nice smooth dough.  I also cooked with a pan of water in the bottom of the oven.

It took me more than a few tries to get it right but WOW is this good!  I haven't been able to find anything even close to the Italian bread I grew up on in NJ since I moved to KY, so I realized I would have to start making it myself.  My winning combo was reducing the amount of water to about 1.5 cups and that took me about 5 cups of flour to get the stiff dough. Started off in my stand mixer with the whisk attachment until it was thick enough for the dough hook.  Sprinkled flour when I was kneading in between risings to keep dough from sticking.  I think my baking time was 25 - 30 minutes.   I put a pan of water on the bottom rack instead of misting.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Couple things on this one - first, as someone earlier mentioned, only put the cornmeal under the bread -- my fan is still going on high since the whole house smoked up from the burning cornmeal on the cookie sheets!  Second, I'm not exactly sure of the cook time - the top of the recipe says 1 hr. but at 450 that sure seems like a long time.  I took them out after 20 min., since they sounded done.  Haven't cut into them yet, maybe they needed to go longer.

Very easy with few ingredients.  Excellent taste. I found the dough to be a very soft dough, and after the third rising while it was formed into "footballs", it seemed to spread out, rather than hold it's shape. It was so easy, I will make it again, but will re-think how to form it for baking.

My sole purpose for registering to this site was to be able to praise this recipe!!  I've never done a bread in my life and about as close as I've come prior was making pizza dough and flour tortillas.  Not only was this an easy to make bread, it is absolutely delicious!  If I could give it 20 stars, I would!  The absolute best praise came from the Italian family I married in to (I am of Mexican descent).  Thank you, Mama D!  This recipe is now going to become a staple in our household!

Absolutely awesome recipe!!!!!! Nice crispy crust and delisciously soft inside.  I added a Table spoon of garlic powder to the recipe as I was wanting garlic bread and it came out perfect.... Added the garlic powder at the same time as the salt.  Next time I will add fresh garlic for that Tuscan touch!  Again this is awesome Italian bread!

The taste, texture, & crust of this bread is outstanding. My family loved it! However, the directions were not as great. I just made the bread how I usually make bread and it turned out nice. I sprayed some water onto the loafs before putting in the oven and again within the first few moments of baking. I did have a spreading problem during the last rise. The "footballs" looked rather deflated. I think that the liberal use of olive oil on the pan contributed to this because the loaf on the unoiled baking stone didn't have this problem. After baking it didn't really matter though and the bread was great- one to eat with dinner, one to share, and one to freeze for another day!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the bread turned out great as far as the crust and consistency of the bread go.  However, it would only be 2 stars flavorwise.  Next time I will add more salt and some pepper and/or herbs.  Bread takes a long time, but is worth it if I can find the right flavor combination.

Great recipe!!  I made this with my bread machine on the dough setting, then put it in my italian loaf tray/pan to do the last rising.  It worked out perfectly!  I would recommend a very humid hot kitchen, much like your bathroom after after a shower.

This recipe is wonderful! I've been making bread for only about 6 months, and this bread turned out perfect for me. I did know already how long for each rise (I did about 50 min), and I also knew what the consistency of the dough should be, so that helped, as the recipe doesn't do much to help newbies out. However, this bread tastes so awesome, my husband and I ate a loaf and a half in 1 day! I followed epiphonys' directions exactly. Also, 30 minutes in the oven with a pan of water on the lower rack almost burnt them, so keep an eye on them!

I love this bread!  I use my kitchen aid stand mixer for kneading... and heat up my stoneware pie dish, place a rag in it, and then set my bread bowl in it.  This speeds up the rising time!  I like thin slices, so when it's done, I let it cool, then chill it in the fridge for a few hours.  When it's good and cold I take a really thin/finely serated knife and cut thin slices.  I get about 24 slices per loaf.  It makes amazing toast and french toast!!!  Love this bread and so does my husband!

This bread has great texture, and my dad said it tastes like what his grandmother used to make.  I just  knead the dough on a floured table to take care of the stickiness.  I spray the crust with water before placing in the oven, and bake with a pan of water in the oven.  I have made it three times, the last time with whole wheat flour, and it came out fine (though flatter) that way too.  My first successful yeast bread.. easy for a beginner.

VERY GOOD BUT A BIT MORE DENSE THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED. THE COOKING TIME I USED WAS ABOUT 40 MINUTES WITH AN ELECTRIC RANGE. I WOULD SUGGEST USING A BIT MORE SALT AND OTHER FLAVORING. ALL IN ALL AN EASY BREAD RECIPE.

I've made this bread twice now and plan to make it again this weekend. I followed the suggestions in "Endorphins" review, dated May 2 2008, and it made for a wonderful bread, perfect for slicing and using in sandwiches or warmed with butter. 

My modifications: I added 1 tbsp oregano and 2-3 tsp garlic powder, and worked the dough into 3 long, oval loaves, scored diagonally across the top - my husband loved it and requested I only make this bread! 

For cost-conscious bakers: I did the math, and for me it is cheaper to bake this high-quality bread than it is to buy cheap sandwich bread at the store. Now I just bake this bread every other weekend.

The closest Italian bread recipe I have found.  I'm a born and bred NY'er and moved to Virginia in '05.  Could not find good Italian bread, so I searched for good recipes and this was it.  Even though I've since moved back to the Tri State area and still bake this bread.  It's perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread turned out great. I wish it had exact times in the instructions, but I figured it out from another bread recipe. My crust was somewhat hard, though not too much. Maybe I didn't mist the dough enough. But this is definitely a keeper. I served it with an oil, vinegar and herb mixture.

Adding a bit of olive oil in the dough makes this bread impossible to survive longer than 20 minutes out of the oven. The family loves it! It also makes a great dough for a sicilian pizza!

This bread really came out nice.  I used about half bread flour and half all purpose.  I think I ended up using more flour than called for to get a 'stiff' dough.  It was a little too much for my stand mixer, so I kneaded by hand too.  My 3 loaves baked up golden brown in 20 minutes, with a nice, chewy crust and fine texture.  I didn't bother with turning the loaves while baking.

This was my first time making a yeast bread, and I was so impressed with how it turned out!  I halved the recipe and made two small loaves.  As others have pointed out, I had to add quite a bit more flour to achieve the desired consistency.  For a half batch, I baked for about 30 minutes; I misted the loaves every 3 minute for the first 10-12 minutes (until the loaves were golden brown).  Superb!

So good!  This bread has the taste and texture I've been looking for!  I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the dough just to help the bread last better on the counter, it worked but we ate the bread so fast it didn't really matter :)  Freezes well too!

*This bread dough makes the best olive bread, homemade or store bought, that I've ever had.  Using the basic recipe add about a cup of each kalamata olives (pitted) and green stuffed olives no need to chop the olives.  Also add 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped.
I sprinkle the olives with a bit of flour and add them to the bowl before kneading.  You could scale down the recipe but the olive bread freezes really well and disapears fast!

Great recipe! I've only just started making my own bread recently, so I have read a lot of advice that others give. I found that adding as much flour as needed until it was smooth and stiff worked well. Advice from my early failed attempts: Be sure water is hot enough (appr. 110), and knead for 7-10 minutes. I also substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour which turned out great!

Outstanding! I cut the recipe in half and used part of the dough for a pepperoni roll recipe(Easy Pepperoni Bread) from this site. I shaped the remaining dough into a 'football' and a large round loaf. It took about 40 minutes in a 375 degree oven to get it golden brown with a nice, crispy crust.

Good, basic, easy recipe.  I made Pasta e Fagioli for dinner and wanted some good bread to go with it.  This was perfect.  I dumped the ingredients in my bread machine on the Dough setting, and then finished by hand and baked in my oven.  Great meal for a rare cold winter night here in the Arizona desert.

This is a great recipe.  For those who said the dough was sticky, I used 7 cups of flour but I only mixed in 6.  I used the last cup for kneading and eventually got the final cup kneaded in.  I kneaded by hand for about ten minutes. Since it has to rise 3 times, it's a bit of a projct but great when you're home all day.

Since moving to Virginia from NYC, we really miss the fresh bread from the bakeries, so I've started baking bread.  I've tried tons of recipes in a quest to find the "perfect NY-style bakery bread" and this one is IT! Even when we have guests over, they tell us how good the bread is.

crusty on the outside and soft inside. added some spices, garlic, parm cheese, next time will add more I think, but would be great on its own. this is especially good dipped in olive oil and spices. a real hit at dinner last night.

Although a little denser than what I thought it should be this is a great basic recipe. I added some dried herbs and a little garlic powder. There is nothing like fresh yeast bread coming out of the oven!

Good & Easy!  The bread had a great crunchy exterior and a nice texture inside, not too dense but not too light.  It also makes wonderful rolls.

Wonderful!  I used 1 large cookie sheet and divided the dough into 4 loaves.  I misted the loaves every 5 minutes because it's so much fun, and they were done within 25 minutes.  3 of the 4 loaves fed a dinner party of 8.  Another reviewer had mentioned they had trouble getting their bread to rise, I did not, but I did notice that 1pkg of yeast doesn't measure 1 tablespoon, so perhaps they were depending on the labeling of the package and not actually measuring their yeast.  I used the kitchenaid mixer, used it to do all the kneading so this was a very easy recipe.

I cut the recipe to make one loaf (didn't know how would turn out). For dough: I added a bit more water. For baking: Since I didn't have a spray bottle, I sprinkled on the water and lightly rubbed. Also didn't turn the bread over. For the greasing: I used extra virgin olive oil. The baking takes about 20 minutes.   
Very pleased at the ease of making. Will make the whole recipe next time now I know it will turn out good. It's something else having fresh homemade bread anytime you want :-)

Crusty on the outside.  Soft and chewy on the inside.  As a first time bread maker, I was surprised how well it turned out.  Will make again.

Easy and delicious! I looked for a last minute recipe and found this one...I was nervous to try it out since I am not that experienced in baking my own bread, but I was pleasantly surprised! I had to use a bit more flour than the recipe called for due to humidity. It baked up nice and golden and we ate it sliced hot out of the oven! The only difficult part was shaping the loaves. I guess I need more practice!

Nice bread, and very easy.  I didn't use a full 7 cups of flour as it wasn't necessary.  Looks like the variation on humidity tip was correct!  Bread was crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Made two loaves and some rolls which reminded me of german Brodchen (sp?).  Will probably make again but it's not converted me to handmake all my bread.  
Oh, and I used basting brush to put on a little water instead of mister (had none).  Seemed to work fine.

This was a good bread, but it was not what I was looking for.  I wanted something lighter on the instead, and the crust was too hard.  This is very good if you are looking for a rustic kind of bread.  It does not have a whole lot of taste to it though.  This would be excellent for dipping in oil and spices, but not for sandwiches.

YUM!  I have been baking bread for a little while now.  This is EXACTLY the recipe I have been looking for.  It is so good.  I took somebody else's advice and let it rise overnight.  I did this after the second rise.  In the morning I divided the dough and shaped and then let rise again before baking.  Thank you thank you thank you Mama D. for this one!  It will be our Italian bread favorite.

My first attempt at making bread and it was wonderful. I could not believe how fast it rises. It only took abut 8 hours for our family(4) to eat it because everyone loved it so. I am going to try it with some dill in it tomorrow.

This recipe is very good and very easy but 3 1# loaves are realy too much for just one person to eat. I've tried freezing some. I'll let you know how that turns out at some future date.

Nowhere do they say about buying cornmeal in the ingredients...nowhere do they say how long to make it rise...and they tell you to add in as much of the flour until it's thick dough. Ugh, it's like classic Italian homemade cooking, where you have next to no instructions, and you're just supposed to guess or go with your gut. I hate that. I want to know what I'm supposed to do. Well as it turned out, I didn't have enough yeast, so I said let's try a tsp of baking powder. I also felt that seven cups of flour left me with a runny library paste, so in the end I think I must've used about nine cups. My bread came out awesome. Please, Mama D., be a little more clear. Thankfully, I've make enough Swedish braid to know when a dough looks good enough to work with. Ah well, leave it to a Swede to get it right!!

So I found that the 1hour bake time works if that is all three loaves baking within one hour. I just turn the oven on and watch them. I let the dough begin cooking and rub butter on the top of it. With separating the dough and then returning it to the bowl, I grab three separate bowls and separate it. Works well, but the amount of dishes this makes drives my husband bonkers. But I have definitely saved money in Italian bread and my entire family absolutely loves it! Love this bread soooo much and am never buying Italian bread again!

Made only 2 loaves. But almost 1/4 cup of Italian seasoning but it barely made a dent. Not s bad load though.

This is the PERFECT basic Italian bread!  I have used it to make not only bread, but sub rolls, hamburg buns and the like.  I changed the flour to 4C bread flour and 3C AP flour and made Stromboli with it.  It is amazing!

It was alright but half way through baking I brushed on an egg wash so it could brown more. And it was to dense I don't know if it was something I did or the recipe.

I’ve taken a lot of tips from other bakers and the bread comes out fantastic every time. Now I play with alternate flours and various flavor additions like garlic & herb or cranberry & pepita. It’s so nice to actually make bread that turns out like bread

I made this last night and it turned out wonderfully. I put a pan of water on the bottom rack as another reviewer suggested and also misted at intervals. Roasting garlic bread with one of the loaves tonight to serve with pasta. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Accidentally put oven on 350 instead of 450. Still came out pretty good despite this. Will definitely be trying again and doing correctly.

Diane Lynne Thank you! I had the same exact problem with this recipe as you did and a few more. I hope you read this. I greased the pan and brushed the bread with olive oil, sprinkled sesame seeds on the bread. I used the foil and had a house full of smoke. I cooked it for one hour and the underside was too brown, some areas black so I scrapped it clean but the bread was not hollow inside and edible. I cut the bread to make meatball parm hero's when it was hot. I will take your advice and cook for 30 minutes instead. It looked done then! So separate on last rise and cook for 30 minutes and no foil

Very good, basic brea recipe. 

I made a single loaf, 1 large round (shephard bread shape) sprinkled with some sesame seeds, and some (8) dinner rolls with one batch. 

They all taste delicious and the color was perfect. I baked at 450 for 15 minutes, turned, then baked another 12 minutes. Golden and yummy! 

Thanks for sharing.

I have been spending time again with my 15 year old granddaughter and we make bread together as our hobby.  We decided to make this one and a Challah bread. This bread makes an excellent toast and if eaten with soup is simply delicious. It was an instant hit with the family!

First, my complaints, I loved the recipe over all but 1. The portions were huge so I cut them in half.
2. Some of the directions were weird, like when to divide them, so I just divided the loaves before the last rise and went into the oven.
3. Next time I probably won't let it rise 3 times, just twice. 
4. This recipe calls for too much water! It was very difficult to knead and the dough was so wet and mushy that I had to keep adding flour, and of course in doing that, you mess up the ratio. 
5.  And I don't know why, but they didn't rise as much as my other breads have before. I made sure the yeast was activated before putting them in so I don't know what happened.

What I changed were the seasonings, I added pepper, oregano, basil and olive oil (the olive oil I had to add because of the mushyness of the dough while kneading and trying not to continuously add flour, it was more so trying to resolve a problem then actually using it in a recipe). Also, I  don't have a spray bottle/mister and didn't want to get out today, so I used a cooking paint brush and water instead of misting. And I put a tray of water on the first level in the oven while baking, and I used an egg wash right before putting them in the oven. And one loaf I put in a Dutch oven, just to see what would happen. (And the one not in the Dutch oven actually turned out better.)

What I liked; I like the rest of the recipe. I like the sugar and salt ratios because often times I think I'm adding too much salt.  And

I added an extra package of yeast and a heaping tablespoon of sugar instead of one teaspoon. The bread came out ok, good, pretty, but for all the work, mix, rise, mix, rise, punch, rise, punch, rise, punch, separate and then bake. It took all day and the kitchen is a mess. Since it makes so much, you have to use several big bowls. Never again,

An alright recipe. I made a 1/3 batch, so one loaf, replacing 1/2c water and 1/2c flour with sourdough starter but otherwise progressed exactly as called for in the recipe. Needs more salt as it is a bit bland and it is a very crusty bread which is great for me but I'd mist every 5 minutes or so during baking for a thinner and softer crust. I found that it only took 20 minutes at 450 to get a nice dark crust and I had to er temp to 350 for another 30 minutes to get the internal temp of 200 without burning the crust

Good basic Italian bread recipe.  The instructions were a little annoying, but the recipe itself is spot on.  The bread had a good crust and a satisfying texture.

The bread turned out excellent.  For that five stars.  For the directions written I must agree with some of the other reviews on the process.  I did not change any of the ingredients.  I just skipped a few of the steps  in the directions and made it simple.  I will be making this recipe again.  Next time I will add some oregano, basil and lots of garlic to the dough.  It will add flavor.  :)

I used some of the suggestions from others, because I agree directions are very vague.  the bread never rose completely but I added cheese to the dough and it tasted wonderful!  Sliced the bread and put in toaster oven.  Amazing for sandwiches!

Yes,  the instructions could be much better,  but this was a wonderful bread-crusty outside, tender, yet chewy inside.  Read through the other reviews for help, if you're not sure, but give it a try. This will be my go-to for Italian bread now!

Good simple bread.  Cooking instructions are a bit off.  Bake till it is done...an hour is way too long.  Could use a bit more salt.  I added a bunch of dried minced garlic and dried thyme during the kneading and did not do the rest period before adding remaining flour.   I let it rise once, punched it down and formed into loaves.  I let those rise and then scored them, misted them down and put them in the oven with an ice cube tray beneath them.  Boom!  Bread!

This is wonderful fluffy bread with an amazing crisp crust! With this recipe I made one smaller loaf and one larger loaf...smaller loaf baked for 20 mins with misting with water for the first 10 mins (every 5 mins) and the larger loaf baked for 30 mins ..on the same misting with water as the smaller loaf.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!!

I was looking for a "keeper" recipe for bread, and I found it here. It was easy to make. The only thing I changed was the cornmeal. I used sesame seeds instead because I didnt have the cornmeal. Although, I will try just punching the dough down the first time, instead of deviding it. I was looking for bread that had a chewy crust after the first day and into a few days later. I found it here with the Moma D'S Itialian bread. Thank you.

Easy – peasy!  Keep it simple with the crust… The only reason I am giving this recipe only 4 stars is because it was not nearly as good the next day, despite being lovingly wrapped and stored.

Excellent recipe when it comes to taste; came out perfect.  But, i get to agree with the others, the recipe was not for the beginner. Times were off, etc. Doesnt accoubt for altitude, but then again if tou arent in it, why would someone account for it? I cooked mine in a skillet, did not spritz with water, nor did i use the cornmeal. (I forgot I hadn't any.) When it came out, it had a beautiful crust with the nice typical, soft insides. It went perfect with my homemade spaghetti sauce  and then with the homemade blackberry jam.Again, the taste is perfect.

I followed the recipe and restrained myself from adding more flour. Yes, the dough was sticky, but others said that was ok so I left it. I did use my kitchen aid to knead the dough until smooth, let it rise twice punching down after each rise. I formed it into the three footballs and placed them all onto my extra large baking sheet with corn meal under each. They rose nicely and rose even more while baking, so much so that they touched each other slightly. But they separated easily after I took them out of the oven. The crust was a beautiful brown on top and sides, and the bottoms were light brown, crunchy on the outside and soft yet chewy on the inside. This bread had the most perfect texture. I didn't spray them with water,  it I did put the bottom of the broiler pan on the lowest rack and heated it with the oven and put a cup of hot water in just before I put the tray of bread on the middle rack. I watched it closely and when I saw it brown, I checked the temp and took it out at 200 degrees. It only took 30 minutes. All three loaves were gone by end of dinner (family of 11). This recipe is nothing short of amazing! Delicious.

We really enjoyed this bread plain and will do it again plain or with different combinations of herbs. I followed the recipe quite closely, changing only that I put the three portions of dough onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet instead of into the bowl. The crust was perfect.

This bread turned out really well.  I don't bake a lot of bread, so I was very pleased with the ease of this recipe.  I am only giving it four stars, though, because it is a bit bland.  Next time I make it, I think I will at least add more salt.

The only thing I did differently is bake it on parchment paper for just under 30 minutes. The parchment paper was easier than greasing and cornmeal and it just cooked that fast.

Still, it's an absolutely delicious recipe,  and one I'll be making at least once a week.

my first attempt at bread ever...............   bread crust came out hard, baked for 45 min  then pulled from oven when saw it was getting dark. inside was a bit dense also possibly too much kneeding.   i followed to the "T" and was slightly disappointed.   
my second attempt i am making as a loaf bread and free style italian to see which we like better.  i am also cutting down cook time to 20-30 min.   i did not kneed as much this time.  as for other complaint about sticky dough.  i followed the first few steps to a "T" again and after adding salt and about 1.5 cups of flour  and mixing into stiff sticky  dough i then dumped it onto my well floured table to start kneeding.  i floured my hands  and worked about another 3/4 cup of flour in my needing process  placed in well oiled bowl let rise for about an hour in an oven with only the light on (no heat).   dumped from bowl and punched down on floured table again.  placed back in bowl let rise for another 30 min.  made a loaf pan bread and a large and small free style bread.  followed rest of instructions.  baking for 20-30min.   bread came out great

Fantastic bread. I've made this several times and it's my go to bread. Whenever I make this, it's gone and we're full before dinner! 5 stars.
NOTE: With all my yeast bread I proof generally replace half or all sugar with honey.

Yep, this was a sticky dough to start with, however, it was a really tasty bread. Down side, makes too much bread (and we are a family that LOVES bread) and I prefer a taller bread.  Weird,  I know, but true.  I'll try it again, maybe halve the recipe and shape a little differently to get more height.

I read some of the reviews and followed there direction. 

So far everything looks good and just waiting it to cool so I can taste it. 

Thank you to the people who made comments as it was helpful for me to follow. 

For the second rising of the dough I didn't separate.  I also omitted 6 and put a tray of water underneath  as stated in some of the comments. Will update in the taste


Just tasted the bread and taste pretty good.  I also followed on the comments not to knead to much

If you are really into Artisan Breads, this is the PERFECT BASE! I add Fresh Parsley or Cilantro, Fresh Basil, Fresh Rosemary, Fresh Dill and Sage, Onion Powder and Garlic Powder to the initial 4 Cups of Flour and whisk it to mix it well before adding the Water/Yeast/Sugar mix. Baking time is the same. This can also be used for Herb Focaccia, or Pizza Dough. It also Freezes Great. I form a log the width of a Freezer Bag, Roll out all the air and freeze it. As it thaws it starts to rise again. LOVE IT!!

First time making bread ever, the recipe needs to give rising times! I like how much bread it made, but mine also was very flat compared to tall. was delicious though and very moist, I only used 6.5 cups of flour and I added italian spices to the dough which was a great addition.

Good Italian bread. Makes 3 loaves. If using all purpose flour, you may need to add about 2 more cups more than the recipe says.  I it cooked closer to 30 min instead of an hour and still burned the bottom a little so keep an eye on it.

This was a fabulous bread recipe! It turned out perfectly. I read the other reviews and was aware that I might need to adjust the flour amount and to watch the cooking time. I used 8 cups of flour and baked the loaves at 450C for approximately 35 minutes. I used my kitchen aid mixmaster with dough hook and indeed, it was as smooth as a bambino bottom!  We ate one whole loaf with our dinner.  It was absolutely wonderful!

It was a good bread. I split it into two loaves (instead of three) and decreased the temp to 375 for 30 minutes.

The perfect Italian bread. I made this because I wanted to make garlic bread tonight and it'll be perfect for that or for sandwiches.

I agree with some other reviewers that the directions aren't great even though the recipe turned out great (and I'm a novice at baking). The biggest thing is not having any times for any of the steps. You kind of just have to trust your instincts with it. After all the rising mine only took 15 minutes to bake.

I am a novice baker. This is my 2nd attempt at making bread.The bread came out fantastic. Five stars. It reminded me of the bread I used to get in Brooklyn. However, the instructions were very sketchy. I used common sense, and it came out fine. Thanks for making me feel like a baker.

Baking this bread at 450 degrees F was a disaster. The second time, I baked it at 350 degrees for 55 minutes and it was excellent.

Sooo delicious! So easy! I made this today for the first time. I followed the suggestions to bake for 20 minutes and it needed just a few minutes more. Thank you! 
Made this bread again today, again a tasty winner! My family loves it!!

Easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but not the baking instructions. I sprayed with water every three minutes for the first 10 minutes and then baked for an additional 25 at 425 with a bowl of water in the oven. After that I did not turn the bread or wet anymore. The bread was moist, the crust was crunchy and it was outstanding overall. As with any bread, it's time consuming. Perfect for a day at home.

Loved it! Made it for a party and received great reviews. I followed the directions to the letter except that I fudged on the time needed. When operating on a time crunch, waiting for the dough to rise THREE times is a little painful. However, all's well that ends well and guests loved it! I made three loaves of different sizes, large medium, small and they all came out beautifully. The dough is a little difficult to work with because it's sticky, but all in all, great recipe!

Ok here is the low down! Read the most helpful as it will really make a difference. Secondly don't forget the dipping sauce whether it be evoo and balsamic vinegar or a meat sauce that is left over from the World's Best Lasagna recipe. Again read the most helpful reviews as the directions are aloft.

I've used this recipe before. The bread is yummy. The direction are not specific enough i.e. # 5 how long do you let it rise. # 6 about how long do you let it bake ????

For all the time this takes to make I had hopes of a slightly better finished product. It was good, but I am not sure it's worth the wait. Best straight from the oven, as the next day the crust isn't as crisp. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this bread for the first time today. I love the thick crust on it, it reminds me of the bread from the bakerys when I was a kid. I think it would have been better if I use fresh yeast, the Yeast I had was 6 months past date so it didn't rise as much as it should have but still vary tasty.

I didn't care for this recipe.  My loaves came out with a soft crust (I tried the steam bath that another reviewer mentioned).  It was good, but I have other recipes that I like better.

I had to use a LOT of flour.

Very good bread.  I really appreciate FatMama's review that talked about Italian bread in general, add more flour, dough never should be sticky.  I was ready to give up because it was still sticky, thinking I had done something wrong (got a KitchenAid mixer for Christmas and still learning), but then I went back and added about another 1/3 cup of flour after reading the review. I ended up adding about an extra one-third of the amount of flour called for but eventually it all came together beautifully.  I too baked it only about 28 minutes (made 2/3 of the recipe, 2 loaves). Very tasty bread and crusty. We enjoyed it with homemade bean soup while watching the snow fall :)

I make this bread exactly as the recipe is written (except for the baking time & Temp...I bake it at 400 for 30 minutes). It turns out delicious every time! I usually do one or two loaves of bread and one loaf of french bread!  Delicious!!!!

Great taste and texture.  Used much more flower to get the "stiff dough" called for in the recipe.  Cook time was about 40min.  Golden brown and nice hard crust.  Molto bene!

Awesome taste! I cut the recipe and just did a single loaf to try this out. The flavor was just right, though I probably could have let it rise a bit more after the last punch -- it wasn't as "airy" as it could have been, but I like a dense loaf anyway, so I still consider it a success. What I like, too, is that the recipe is basic enough that there's lots of room for improvising and experimenting.

I think this recipe is very good. I have made it quite a few times. I don't always even need the entire 7 cups of flour. I think the difference is that you have to give it the 15 minute rest before adding the salt and the rest of the flour. I have noticed that if I don't do this it needs more flour. I have also made this bread using 100% whole wheat flour with fantastic results. It makes very nice bread for sub sandwiches. This has been our go to bread recipe for a while. I also throw in some ice cubes in the bottom of the oven when I add the bread loaves.

I decreased the recipe to make one loaf.  It was smaller than anticipated but exactly the texture and consistency I was looking for.  Will definetly make this one again.

Great bread. I'd have given it 5 stars, but I changed what I did based on other peoples' comments.

This recipe was fantastic! I put a ton of Italian seasonings and it came out tasting oh so good. It tasted like when you dip your french bread in that olive oil-balsamic vinegar mix. mmmmmmmmm

This bread is simple and tastes great.  I only let the bread rise once, punched down, divided into two loaves and it worked just fine.

Wonderful Italian Bread.  Followed ingredients as given but took a bit here and there from the reviews and it turned out amazing. Crust and texture were perfect along with the flavour.  1.5 loaves were gone just through dinner.

By far the best Italian bread ever! I Love this. I will never make another Italian bread again. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine. Then moved three loaves to a gressed cookie sheet to rise again ( till dough doubled) then  I put it in the oven for 22 min, with a water bath on the bottom rack instead of misting the bread. Perfect!

Made this on Christmas Day and it was perfect!  Crusty with soft bread - totally Italian and totally Yummy!  It's a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I've made a lot of bread in my time, but have not landed it like this recipe did.  I added 1 tbsp sugar instead of one teaspoon, but otherwise followed exactly.  Try this one!

Last Friday I made a double batch of this bread (6 loaves) for a lasagna party I gave. I followed most of the recipe but passed on dividing the dough into thirds until after the end of the second rise. With the first batch, I formed the loaves into baguettes and cut each loaf with about 4 diagonal cuts. The second batch I formed into batards, floured the top and made a single cut from end to end just before going into the oven. I steamed with ice in a hot pan under the stone and sprayed the back of the oven for about 8-10 minutes. The batards (second batch) had more eye appeal than the loaves formed into baguettes. Went through more than 3 loaves with just 14 guests! I'll be making this again for a bigger party in January.

This was the first bread I have made using my kitchenaid.  I have always used my bread maker to make the dough and then took over from there.   I made two large loaves of bread rather than the three smaller loaves and pleased how they turned out.  I did find the cooking time was a little out, I only cooked for 20-25 minutes.

my sister and I are baking this bread right now. we found that 3 cups of water to 1T of dry yeast was entirely too much water and never proofed. we dumped that. we have mixed 1Tbs. yeast to 1/2c water with the 2tsp.sugar, (according to yeast package direction instead of this recipes yeast direction). It then proofed perfectly. we then added the remaining 2 1/2cups of water to the recipe when we added the yeast to the flour. Everything seems to be going according to the plan now. will let you know how tastey it is tonight after dinner :)

This was fantastic!  Followed the recipe to a "t" except made 2 bigger loaves instead of 3.  Served it with homemade chile tonight and everyone raved about it.  My mom loved it, and my wife and kids wouldn't stop eating it.  Ate a whole loaf at dinner.

Can't wait to make this again!  Soooo good- makes great toast with the leftovers too!  I needed a lot more flour- like 3 cups extra- and it was still pretty moist.  I made 2 fre form loaves.  Great recipe!

First off, I'm no expert in making bread. I made it once in high school and once in a bread machine. Many times I thought I'd messed this up, by not proofing correctly or overcooking. Just had a piece and it's heaven in my mouth! Great recipe, will make again for sure.

Easy and awesome.  First time baking bread from scratch with yeast and had no troubles.  No reason to buy bread again after you've had fresh.

Every time I make this, I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my boyfriend. Usually, before the night's over, the bread's all gone. I also add in Italian seasonings to the dough, and then eat the bread dipped in extra virgin olive oil with Italian seasonings and baked garlic bits. It's WONDERFUL and reminiscent of the bread they serve at Carino's.

I put a pan of water on the bottom while baking.  The crust was crisp and the inside was deliciously soft! I served with olive oil mixed some dried oregano, thyme, and rosemary, alternatively you can also just use Italian seasoning.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because i like to leave room for absolute perfection.  I substituted one cup bread flour; kept ball together for 2nd rise; glazed with egg white and added sesame seeds; only ended up using about six cups flower total; completely delicious - lovely rise, great texture and flavour - 2 loaves gone in about 1 hour.

Great recipe. This was my first time making bread and it turned out well. I did use brown sugar instead of white, and I didn't let it rise the third time, so my was a little more dense, but still great, will definitely make again.

I have been making homemade breads for years, and this one just didn't make the cut. I made a slight change to the amount of flour, and subbed about 1/2 cup of oil for some of the water. Also, it didn't rise when I tried having the oven light on. I had to revert back to setting my oven on warm and misting while I waited two hours for it to triple in size. Even that is a bit long. The flavor was okay, but next time I will add some fresh herbs. I liked how the crust turned out, and it wasn't too hard since I only baked it for 25 minutes. It's a good recipe, but I will stick with my own.  :)

We loved this bread! It's very much like a ciabatta bread, or other "artisan" types, without the mucking around with a sponge or starter mess. I served this this evening (it's about 18 below zero here in Minnesota) with a pot of homemade chicken soup, and it was a huge hit.
The dough was sticky, and hard to handle, but I added another 1 1/2 cups of flour, which helped a lot and didn't seem to adversely affect the texture. Like another reviewer, I do not have a mister, and I kind of flung water at the loaves with a basting brush. It's chewy and delightful. Not heavy on flavor on it's own, obviously, because it's a nice simple dough, but lovely with whipped butter. We will be having it tomorrow toasted with jam as well.

I"m a novice baker and this is the 2nd time i've tried to make any breads.  This one turned out good, a little bland(maybe next time i'll add some spices) the only problem i have is that the bread did not get a golden color(any suggestions?)It was brown on the bottom and white on the top. It did taste good(although for a beginner the directions were a little hard to understand) thank you for all who post comments(That helped ALOT) the crust was very crunchy(not sure if that's how it was suppose to taste) all in all not a bad recipe. Any suggestions woud be greatly appreciated. Thank you

Yummy bread. Goes well as a garlic toast with Lasagna. Put a pan of hot water on the bottom rack of my oven instead of misting. Was done in about 25 minutes. Will be making this again.

Easy, fun, and delicious. I feel the secret to any bread is to get the freshest yeast.  Use it the day or week that you buy it and you will always have wonderful results.  Thank you for submitting such a great recipe.

It was good and easy for the most part. Simple ingredients made it easy to do with items I had on hand. The kids loved it and they are the world's pickest eaters,they are usually not fond of bread. Some of the directions were a bit etchy but after reading some other reviews, it was quite simplistic.

This was my first attempt at making Italian bread and it came out great. About 5 minutes before it came out of the oven I brushed it with egg whites to give it a nice golden color.

Wow, this made up a great, simple bread. I halved the recipe and used one cup of whole wheat flour.  I made one large loaf and it was so soft on the inside with a nice, chewy crust.  After I slashed the top, I brushed with a bit of melted butter and YUM!!!  It was great with dinner last night and the leftovers are going to be made into french toast today!

I made this bread over the weekend to go with some sauce and meatballs. When my very  picky brother tried some he said, "This is going to be a long day...because I am going to have to eat all three loaves." 
Although I cook and bake a ton, and am always coming up with new things to try, my father also (while eating his 2nd piece) said; "Is this really from scratch?" 
I followed different reviewers suggestions and added about 9 cups of flour.
Thanks for the recipe!

Not a great recipe for me...the bread was kind of hard and didn't have great flavor.  I probably won't make it again.

This is exactly what I was hoping to find! My husband (very fussy Italian) loved the crust and flavor--me, too! No more buying $4-5 loaves at the bakery! Thank you!

My husband and I thought the bread tasted bland even with butter, dipped in olive oil, etc. But I might try it again adding some olive oil, italian herbs, cheese.

This was my first attempt at making bread EVER!  Was very easy, followed all instructions exactly and they came out perfectly.  I did use the other reviewer’s suggestion of spritzing water on the loaves every few minutes for the first part of the baking.

This is a great and VERY EASY recipe.  My family loved it warm with just a bit of butter melted onto it.  It goes great with just about any kind of food, too, and can even be used for sandwiches.

Very easy recipe.  Next time I'll add some herbs or sundried tomatoes to the dough for some depth of flavor.  Good basic Italian bread...I'll use again! Thank-you.

I loved this! I added some asiago, chedder, mozzerella and parmesan to the recipe and the whole family loved it. It is a great crusty bread. Perfect for any italian dish or for a sandwhich.

I love this recipe!! Mine turned out a little flat but that was probably due to me not using the right kind o of pan. But this bread is so crunchy and wonderful. I made a garlic butter recipe to go with it and followed Rodney D's advice. I would make again!!

Great Bread...came out perfectly! The first time I made this recipe, I made as directed and formed three fat footballs.  I did not care for the size and shape of the slices...next time I made two longer skinny loaves...PERFECT!  Thanks for sharing!!

Plain.  I've definitely had bread recipes that were more enjoyable.  This wasn't bad, just not exciting. I won't make it again.

Finally!  I've been struggling with this type of bread for ages.  This turned out great - I put a pan of water in the oven and misted every 2 minutes for the first 10 minutes.  It makes fabulous toast.

Great recipe! Wonderful crust. Better than store bought.If if gets too hard, just put in a ziplock bag to soften. I made half the recipe 1st time. Will make the full one next time so it will last more than a day!

Great recipe. I added a little extra sugar
to help the yeast proof a little more, and
misted the first ten minutes as per Rodney D's
suggestion. My only complaint is that my crust
didn't turn out quite as crisp as I'd wanted,
which may mean my oven's a bit off, so I may
up the temperature a bit to 475 degrees, we'll
see if that doesn't give me a little more
aggressive crust.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer that for those of who've just started out baking, this recipe is a little vague on times.  the bread came out edible, but not fantastic.  It's good for soaking up juice, but I don't know about eating it without a sauce to soak.  Okay recipe, I'll keep looking.

I baked this yesterday as part of a wonderful Italian meal for our employees. It looked, smelled, and tasted like something from the best bakery. I, too, only needed about 25 minutes of baking time. I used the culinary student's advice and ended up with a gorgeous texture bread with a nice brown and chewy crust. Everyone was amazed; mostly me! Even though my loaves were oddly shaped (I'm not adept at this) they all baked perfectly. I rubbed the bread with melted butter when it came out of the oven. This would make PERFECT "dipping" bread for an olive oil dip.

I had never tried to make bread and thought I would try with this recipe.  It was easy to follow and the bread was tasty - though the shape of the bread was off a bit - too fat in the middle - they looked like footballs.  Other than that wonderful tasting bread - it tasted just like the ones in the bakery.

It was good tasting bread, but it fell in the oven (never had that happen before) and the crust was a little too hard.  But it tasted good, but probably won't make it again.

Great bread!! My family loves it.  I make it at least once a week.  Be sure to get a spray bottle to spray the oven and the bread before and during the baking, and then when it comes out of the oven.

My Mother-in-law cooks gourmet meals and I told her I would love to make some Italian bread for her Italian themed dinner party.  The guests raved about it.  Although, my bread cooked in about 20 minutes also.  If I would have baked it longer, it would have burned.  Thanks for a great italian bread recipe!

Really good bread, no doubt about it !  I threw in a tbls or so of italian seasoning with the last of the flour. I cut the salt just a bit too. I only made one loaf and should have made all three, it was gone in less than 24 hours and there are only three of us!

Pretty darn good.  Lots of compliments.  It's not a hard recipe, but it is just very time consuming as with any authentic bread recipe.  Will make it again.
