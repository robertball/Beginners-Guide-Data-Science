Unusual combination of ingredients, but delicious!  Didn't have curry powder, so used a rounded tablespoon of curry paste instead; also used currants in stead of raisins.  I had to stop cooking halfway to pick my husband up from football and this allowed flavours to blend nicely - will do this on purpose next time.  Served it with mashed sweet potato and green beans.  Perfect!  My family want me to make this again soon.

This is a basic family favourite for me too.  I often add thin slivers of green and mostly, red sweet peppers.  Fresh pineapple with its accumulated juices makes a tasty, less sweet version.  Brown sugar can be used instead of golden syrup - or honey, sweetener of choice and to taste.  Good recipe with shrimps instead of chops of chicken pieces.  Very versatile recipe with many riffs possible.  Thank you!!

The flavor was good, but the cook time is way too long.  Next time I'll brown the chops in a cast iron pan, 3 minutes each side on medium heat; after adding the sauce mixture to the pan I'll put it into the oven for 15 minutes at 350.  I make pork chops using this method all the time and they turn out perfectly.

For me this recipe earned only a 3.5, tops.  Not bad at all!  Just felt it was another version lacking certain ingredients for the recipe to be found here for "Bahama-Mama Pork Chops."
Nothing went wrong, just the "oomph'!!  I think if you replaced the golden syrup with brown sugar here and omitted the chili sauce from the other recipe you would have a superb recipe in all!  Thank you for sharing!

I am a Pirate Freak so you know when I came across a dish with Pirate in the name I just had to try them.  These things were AWESOME!!!  I love to cook however I do not care for pork that much.  My boyfriend loves pork chops so I always look for an interesting way to cook them and these came out great!  The pork was not dry and there was a lot of flavor.  Like any cook I cannot follow a recipe word for word and I always have to add a twist so here is what I did:  I did not have the curry so I just used some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a dash of Soulard Grill seasoning.  I only simmered for about 20 minutes and then added the pineapple and raisins and a pat of butter for about 10.  I used golden raisins which were great however use whatever kind you like!  Didn’t have golden syrup so I used some good maple syrup from Funk’s Grove.  Good Stuff!  I also used fresh ginger instead of powder because that is all that I had.  I suggest adding the ginger to your tasting use less or more depending how much you love it.  I also added a little more pineapple, I like fruit.  I have also in the past added a dash of coconut rum, silver rum or some good old Captain Morgan.  Just a splash will do but it does add some flavor! You could also add some sweet potatoes it is a great little twist with an awesome complimenting flavor. I would recommend this to anyone I know the combination of ingredients sounds strange but this is an awesome dish!  Serve with some potatoes, a salad, rice and a v

My husband who is a VERY picky eater loved this recipe. I used fresh pineapple and added about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice. I also used brown sugar instead of syrup and omitted the raisins. I will be making this recipe again.

Made this last night with chicken instead of pork and honey instead of golden syrup.  It was great!  We really enjoyed the sweet sauce.  I simmered the chicken for about 10 minutes after browning it.  I recommend this!  It is a quick and easy meal for a weeknight supper.

Aye, 'tis fine food for pirates and land lubbers alike.  Lots of flavor little fuss.  The sauce for this dish is a tantalizing sweet and tangy  glaze. I added a wee splash of rum in honor of pirates everywhere.  This recipe is a treasure for sure.

This recipe is wonderful!  I modified it a little by adding red, orange, and green bell peppers just before adding the pineapple. Served over brown rice and with a tossed salad--magnifique!

I am not the biggest fan of pork chops, but this recipe was fantastic!  Everyone enjoyed them. I served with rice and a veggie and it was a great meal. I substituted dark and light syrup mixed because I didn't have golden syrup. And I added a bit of corn starch to thicken up the sauce. Delicious!

This was excellent!  My husband and children loved the taste of this dish.  I made two changes; instead of golden syrup I use dark brown sugar and instead of pineapple chunks I used crushed pineapple because it was what I had on hand.  The leftovers were even tasty!

I've had  this in my recipe box for years but have always avoided making this because of the golden syrup.  After reading that other cooks were using brown sugar, I gave this a try.  Surprisingly my husband raved about this.  My only complaint was that the curry flavor didn't come through very strongly.

Out of 5 people, 4 liked it, so that's how it's rated.  I added sweet potatoes too, not sure if I liked it or not.  Like another reviewer, I also cooked chops in iron skillet and then baked it for about 20 mins after everything was added.  Pork chops were super tender!  Will fix again - I think I'll add more raisins!

This dish was tasty but too sweet for us.  The second time I made this I left out the syrup.  Much better.

MMMM sooo goooood!!!  Chops were moist and delish.  An odd combination of flavors with the curry powder but it works in such a delightful way!  I used brown sugar instead of the syrup per others' suggestions and I left out the raisins.  Everything else I followed to a T and it was so yummy!  This recipe is definitely going into the regular rotation!

This was a great recipe, though I added some sliced onion and green pepper which i fried before teh meat, then once it was almost done, I added some sliced broccoli and beans just so that it could be an all in one meal and it was great, my boys loved it.

So wonderful!  I used honey inplace of the syrup.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  I didn't find the need to double the sauce, we liked it as it was.  My kids, ages 3, 5, and 8 loved it as well.  Oh, and also, I used the 20 oz can of pineapple chunks.

Made this for dinner and my 15 yr old daughter wasn't sure she wanted to try it Once she did she informed me that  this is now her favorite meal it even beats out pizza and tacos in her opinion. I did not have any ginger, only had curry paste and used honey instead of golden syrup. My daughter and I really enjoyed this and we will be making this again. Thanks for this recipe!

Next time, I'll make this in the crock pot. The whole family liked the flavor, even the kids, but pork was a bit dry. I also used golden raisins instead of regular as I figured they would blend in better with the sauce and not "freak out" my finicky children. It worked!

I thought this was just okay.  It was a nice change of pace from other pork chop recipes that I have but I didn't feel like it had as much flavor as I was hoping for.  Maybe letting it sit like one reader had done, will help the flavors melt together.

This is a simple and easy recipe.  Both my husband and myself enjoyed this. I added some green and red pepper chunks which added both colour and flavour.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe, it's nice to find something new to do with pork chops.

I thought this was pretty good.  My husband and 4-year old were a little less thrilled but didn't dislike it.  I cubed the pork and substituted about 1/8 cup of maple syrup for the golden and thought it was plenty sweet.

Good recipe and golden syrup is superior (in my opinion) to corn syrup.  Once discovering it I have used it on pancakes, etc. etc.   In this recipe I used only half the amount called for because we don't like anything that sweet, but certainly preferred it over corn syrup or brown sugar.  Good to see a recipe calling for this syrup.

These were good and fairly sweet.  I didn't have any curry so left that out, and it probably would have balanced things out a bit.  I fried the pork chops in olive oil instead of veg oil and just put salt and pepper right on the chops to taste rather than adding them to the sauce.  I wasn't sure about syrup and ketsup together, but it was quite good.

I used this recipe as inspiration for my own dish considering i lacked many ingredients to make this one, fantastic blend of flavors and the pinapple, raisins, pork, and rice work very well together as one dish.

this was a great meal when paired with yellow saffron rice.  I substituted honey for syrup and dijon mustard for ketchup ( I just don't like ketchup!).  Also added an orange pepper I had on hand.  It was really good.  thanks for the recipe

I suppose this showed me just how much of a sweet tooth my dinner eaters have.. And.. they LOVED this dish.  They RAVED 
in glowing terms and ate and gave thanks 
and ate and spoke appreciatively and ate 
:)  really.. they loved this.  I served it with some jamaican rice that was snazzed up with some coconut and something green on the side. 
They loved me more after this dinner ;)

Tasty, quick and easy to make.  Like others I thought the cooking time was too long.  20 minutes was enough.  Next time I will put the stove fan on and open the windows a bit.  The smell of the maple syrup cooking made the kitchen smell as if we had a fire.  Thanks submitter.

This sauce was very good, but it didn't flavor the pork chops enough.  Next time I will cube the pork, coat with flour, and brown first to give the sauce something to stick to.  I'll also add more curry powder next time, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

The sweet, tangy sauce was amazing! I left out the raisins and substituted brown sugar for golden syrup. I slightly increased the sauce and put in some frozen broccoli near the end, and even my picky boyfriend loved it.

This was fruity and delicious! I used golden raisins, and thickened the pork chop juces after it was done with a little corn starch and water to make gravy for rice. The kids and I loved it!

My husband loved this. I followed another reviewer and sautéed a little onion and some golden pepper. I subbed the same amount of sriracha for curry and maple syrup for the golden syrup. Omitted raisins because we were out. I served with brown rice and peas. I cooked it all on the stove because our electricity kept coming on and off. Next time I’ll try baking it. Delicious!

It was delicious! I added garlic, a dash of soy sauce and a shot of  dark rum. I added every thing together and whisked it all up and poured it over the hops that were cooking. I think it made it easier rather than sprinkling the spices on them like I assumed the recipe requires. Hyena I added the pineapple and raisins. My family loved it!

Super-easy and yummy!  Even my 6-yo who normally doesn't like things saucy, gobbled it up! I subbed honey for the golden syrup, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Nice flavour without tasting like curry or ginger!  Thanks for sharing!

Needs some tweaking.  Chops were pretty dry and really didn't inherit much flavor.  Probably should shorten cook time, perhaps check with thermometer as it goes, rather than judge by time.  Additionally, I used pineapple juice, and may have watered the sauce down too much.  A thicker sauce may help.  Good start with some interesting flavors, but needs some experimentation to dial in.

Fantastic!  Didn't have curry powder, so I used cumin pepper for the heat and added raw cane sugar and a little less syrup.

Might use crushed pineapple next time...

This recipe was fabulous!  I added some vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to cut down on the sweetness (as others had mentioned it was too sweet) and used brown sugar instead of the syrup.  I also thickened it after the meat was done.  My husband loved it and has requested it again!!

Cooked this recipe for my wife and I and we both loved it.  Followed recipe exactly except I didn't add raisins.  I added a can of sliced potatoes at the end and let them cook in the sauce. It was Outstanding.  Will definately cook it again.

Yummy!!  I used honey instead of Golden syrup (didn't have any on hand)served it over rice, and my family loved it! The only thing I will do different next time is double the sauce so there is plenty to go with the rice. Thanks for the great recipe!

We found this recipe to be very tasty and easy to make.  I added 1 cup of left-over white wine to the mix and ran out of honey so I substituted and added some Karo Syrup to the honey I had.  The entire family said it was a winner and wanted more.

Partially my fault - overcooked the chops while waiting for the rice.. Served it up with rice & yellow beans. Overall, very tasty twist for pork chops - not too sweet - used corn syrup instead of "golden syrup". Will definitely try again   - and watch the clock closer.
