A solid four stars - I have to admit I made some changes but they seem fairly insignificant. I let my son pick the pasta, so he picked seashells, and instead of cooking the chicken, I used meat I picked off last night's roasted birdie. The MAJOR change was that I used plain canned tomatoes and seasoned them myself with salt, pepper, oregano, basil and garlic. I generally don't like the flavor of the "flavored" canned 'maters so I never buy them. Kept to the heart of the recipe though, and it was great. Really really good. I would recommend seasoning the chicken as you cook it, just as a general cooking rule. Salt pepper and garlic is all you'd really need and would add another layer of flavor to the recipe.

Small changes due to what I had on hand. I used elbow macaroni and because I couponed it for REAL cheap, I used Philly's Italian Cheese and Herb cooking cream (the whole stinkin' container). I did spice my chicken before cooking it (onion powder, garlic powder, basil, oregano, pepper) and I did saute some fresh sliced onion, minced garlic, chopped red bell pepper and sliced baby bellas (had to use them--so why not throw it in?) in the skillet after I added the chicken. Had I NOT spiced my chicken and used a flavored cooking cream, it would have been bland. I think it still could use some oomph, like maybe some chicken broth instead of plain water, fresh chopped sweet tomatoes and more spices so I might play with the recipe still. I think it could be a great little skillet meal. For those of you who have spotted the cooking cream in your supermarket, this is a good way to use it.

This was pretty good.  It just crossed over the line from being too bland, tho.  Next time I think I will add garlic and/or onions to kick it up a bit.  I cooked the chicken in a tbsp. of butter and sprinkled it with seasoning salt.

This recipe was awesome! I tweaked it a little..I used a little extra bacon, fresh garden tomatoes seasoned myself, fresh garlic, fresh parsley and I used 1/4 cup water to ensure the sauce stayed thick and flavorful. My family loved it!!

Loved this.  I was looking for a pasta dish with chicken, bacon, and tomatoes, and this fit the bill.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular pasta and threw in an extra slice of bacon.  I think it would be great with a couple dashes of hot pepper flakes, or a couple sprinkles of cayenne pepper, just to give it a little extra kick.  The leftovers were fantastic.  Thanks!

This was good the 1st day and excellent the second. 2 cups of uncooked pasta enough. I sauteed 1/2 frozen red pepper, added 3 cans of diced tomatoes 1 brick of cream cheese. Mixed the 1/2 cup water with 2 Tbsp corn starch. It seemed to need thickening.  This is going in the rotation file because we ALL really liked it.

I loved this, it was as easy as spaghetti, and so much better! Three of my kids were not crazy about it, but they do not like "chunky" tomatoes. I may just use spaghetti sauce next time, and I'm sure they will like it. My 15 yr. old has added it to her 'learn to cook' list, and my husband said he wanted it often!

I liked!  A couple didn't like the cream cheese and suggested an Alfredo sauce instead, but I think I would definitely add garlic and basil and probably black olives.

After reading the reviews that suggested the recipe was a bit bland, I made a few changes to try and avoid this, with fairly good success! 

As others suggested, seasoning the chicken as it cooks is important. Since I didn't have any bacon, I cooked the chicken bits in bacon grease, and seasoned them with black pepper, salt, white pepper, ground coriander, and dark beer (in place on the 1/2 cup of water) as well as some cayenne pepper for a bit of spice. 

I think using the bacon fat may have helped to dry out the chicken breast pieces more then I would have liked, although I liked the flavor it added to the meal. Next time, I will try cooking the chicken in extra-virgin olive oil, and will add some bacon fat while I'm thickening the cream sauce. 

I was short on cream cream cheese, so I substituted heavy whipping cream for the remainder. After adding the tomatoes (with a little salt) and reducing the sauce for several minutes, I added some corn starch to help thicken it. 

The final change I made was to add a sprinkle of dried parsley to the bowls of finished pasta in addition to the Parmesan, just for color! 

Hopefully, I can keep the chicken more moist next time, but in the end, the sauce was absolutely delicious, and I will try to make this recipe again very soon.

As is this is very bland not very good at all. When it was done cooking I knew my family wouldn't be happy. Luckily the grocery store this week had the Philadelphia cooking cream for free this week so I had one of those on hand I added the whole container of that into the mix and thinned it out with a little half and half. I also doubled the bacon and used sea shell pasta as that is what I had on hand.

This recipe did not have a lot of depth as far as flavor goes.  I probably would not make this again.  I added some other seasonings to try to make it more flavorful.  Also, I would suggest cutting back on the amount of water added - the sauce comes out too thin and watery.

Pretty good, but I don't think I'd have liked this as much if I hadn't spiced it up.  I added garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, basil and oregano to the chicken before frying it up.  I also tossed in some shallot and chive boursin cheese along with the cream cheese and didn't add any parmesan.  I made the majority of  this for a friend and her family and since they don't eat pork I left out the bacon entirely.  This makes a lot--I wasn't really in the mood to measure out the pasta, so I just boiled an entire box with the thought that I could do something with the excess if needed.  As it was, it all was fine to go in with the sauce and it coated it pretty well even though I left out the water completely.  Other than cutting up the chicken, this was a pretty quick meal, so you could leave out the chicken (or use already cooked chicken) to make this even faster for a weeknight meal.  Bf approved it, so I'd make it again with my modifications.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  It has simple instructions and uses ingredients I usually have on hand. I season the chicken with salt and pepper and saute it in a bit of the bacon drippings.  I also add more than half of the cream cheese into the sauce (about 3/4 bar).

This was delicious! I like many others made a few changes, I used the Italian style cream cheese. I seasoned my chicken cubes with lots of different spices. Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion salt, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and some nature's seasoning. I also used chicken broth instead of water since some people said it was bland.  It was already pretty soupy once I added the can of Italian seasoned tomatoes so I only added half a can of chicken broth. I poured it over mini farfalle pasta. The consistency was great and the taste was flavorful, creamy, and cheesy. My family loved it and I will bemaking it again!

If you like spicy dishes I would probably pass this one by (unless of course you add your own jazz), but if you like simple flavors that meld deliciously you will like this dish.  I’ll be making this one again.

Chicken, bacon, and cream cheese belong together!  Like the other reviewers, I plain diced tomatoes and added the Italian seasoning to the chicken.  I also used a whole lot more than 3 slices of bacon.  Mmmmm.  This is definitely not a 'good for you' dish.  In fact, I'd call it DEVILISH!

I thought this was great!  Very simple.  I followed the essence of the recipe, but I sauteed garlic and a small amount of finely chopped onion in olive oil before adding the chicken.  I used 4 slices of bacon, and while the chicken was browning, I added tons of spices to it.  Salt and pepper as well as some italian herb mix and garlic herb mix.  I also added quite a bit of crushed red pepper.  When it was all complete, I put about 1/2 cup parm in with the tossed pasta, as well as had it to sprinkle on top.  It was super delish.

Oh my this is so good with a few changes....followed most of it but I read the other reviews about it being bland so I boiled my chicken breasts in chicken bouillon for added flavor. I used a pack of bacon, 3/4 package of cream cheese and the Hunts diced tomatoes with the basil, garlic & oregano.  I cooked 1/2 yellow onion in the olive oil, added fresh  garlic and instead of plain water, I used the leftover broth from what I cooked my chicken in.  Also added some bacon drippings.  I did add a little bit of corn starch as it was runny.  This is so good...if no one else likes it I am still going to cook it again because it is deeeelicious!

I made this for me and my husband and tweaked the recipe since it was just the two of us. Seasoned the chicken while it was cooking with some garlic and herb grillmates. Loved the bits of bacon and how creamy it was. Didn't have diced tomatoes in a can so I sliced and chopped up a roma tomato and put some tomato sauce in instead. I also used spiral pasta as that's what I had on hand.

Guess it's a different recipe after all the changes, but I wouldn't have come up with it on my own. Good basic starting dish to tweak to your own taste and what you have on hand.

Very tasty, skip the water though, it makes it too runny. I also tried adding sun-dried tomatoes and more bacon.
