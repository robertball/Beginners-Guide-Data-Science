These were great. I didn't taste the cinnamon as another review said- the batter was really good.  I did have to add 2 more TBLS of milk to the icing as Aprilart mentioned. The icing is not really an icing but a really thick glaze. I did double the peanut butter in the icing- so maybe that is why...  I piped mine on with a tip and bag so when it spread it wouldn't drip over the sides.  I made 12 regular sized baked about 30 minutes and made 12 mini muffins baked about 15 minutes. I piped some melted chocolate bars on the big ones.  Thought the icing and the cake go hand and hand- very tasty.

I am generously giving this recipe 3 stars in the off hand chance that I did something wrong but I seriously doubt that I did.  I think that the cinnamon is what made this taste so terrible to me and my family.  If I were to make them again, I would omit it entirely.

This recipe was divine. These cupcakes turned out picture perfect and were the most moisture cupcakes I've ever had. Also, the cinnamon really does add a little extra something to the recipe. And the icing definitely was the perfect finish to this already decadent dessert. Note: It is more like a glaze than a traditional icing. I would recommend this recipe to any fellow peanut butter lovers!

I used my own chocolate frosting for these, but overall they were pretty tasty!  The pb/brown sugar mixture smelled heavenly, and while it was baking it filled the kitchen with a wonderful cinnamon-y aroma.  We have our cinnamon in a grinder, so we couldn't measure it, but it does give the cupcakes an interesting flavor and I can see how some people might not like it.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the second batch--OH MAN, with that addition they were perfectly divine!!

These cupcakes were pretty darn good! Wonderful peanut butter flavor, moist, good texture, not too sweet. They are a great treat! I made them with my little kids and it was easy to follow and make. The baked up wonderfully. I did have to add approximately 2 more tablespoons of milk to the frosting to get it to the consistency I was looking for, but other than that this is perfect! If you love peanut butter and cupcakes, I'll bet you'd enjoy this recipe. :)

This was a easy recipe to follow and I got rave reviews from half the kids I gave them to. The other participants were dogs, which also gave wonderful reviews. I cooked them for a people and dog friendly treat for the dogs birthday.

These cupcakes are definitely for PB lovers! I made them as directed, but added crushed Reese's PB cups. I also cooked them for about 20 minutes only. Pretty delicious!

I'm not a pro baker or anything. I do it maybe once a month. But I do extremely enjoy baking. With that said, I made this recipe and decided to add chocolate chips because peanut butter seemed too plain for me. WHOOPS! It was a fine addition, but it made the cupcakes sooo savory and sweet that I could only eat half and had to gulp some liquids. It would be good for those that love sweets, but I was upset with my lack of judgement since there was so much brown sugar. I also had made the glaze already, which I couldn't undo, so I added that on, and HOLY MOLY. But it is a very sweet glaze as well... so I might be killing someone with these cupcakes. Anyways, the thing that I didn't like was how much glaze I had. I gave a good dollop on each cupcake and still had so much left over. I would half the recipe for the glaze. I also added a little extra milk to the glaze. The cupcakes aren't moist like I'm used to, but it works for this cupcake (just don't add chocolate chips if you are sensitive to sweetness).

These cupcakes were fab... firstly i couldn't find any of my weighing scales, so basically i guessed all the ingredient weights.. and secondly as we are not lovers of honey, i used maple syrup in the frosting.... omg the whole cupcake was amazing, for some reason when i took the cupcakes out the oven the tops felt a bit hard, but i think thats my fault, possibly leave them in a touch too long... but once the frosting was on they were amazing, especially the following day, they were so much nicer... i'd tell anyone to have a go at these especially if you love PEANUT BUTTER... mmmmm, also after putting the frosting on i grated a bar of Hershey Chocolate with Almonds, on top of the frosting, and i think it made them all the nicer.. but hey who knows, it was my first attempt and boy was i proud... definately going to do them again...  i only got 14 cupcakes out of my mixture but they were huge... YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE  .... ps.. if your not a lover of cinnamon i don't think it would make any difference if you left it out.. :0)

Definitely cut down the cooking time, I baked for 25 minutes and they came out too dry.  Add extra milk to frosting as suggested by others.  I would add some extra spices next time...all I can taste is dry peanut butter when I tried these, they need a little more umph

I was really looking forward to making these cupcakes but they fell far short of my expectations. The batter was sooooo thick! I had to almost double the milk, and it was still too thick. As a result, the cupcakes were not light and fluffy like most cupcakes are. They were actually kind of crunchy and misshapen. These were more like peanut butter muffins than anything else. Definitely not what I was expecting

The consistency was all wrong. After adding the dry ingredients and milk, I wwas left with a lummpy and incredibly tough batter. I adde more milk in an attempt to loosen it up but nothing seemed to work. I had more of a cookie dough than a cupcake batter. After baking them I noticed that the middle of the cupcakes didn't cook at all. I burned the edges and saw no improvement on the liquid like center. I have been cooking for quite some time and have yet to have a disasterous incident such as this. Furthermore, the dog food flavor actually came out in my cupcakes, what a lovely accent for my chocolate cream cheese frosting. I most definately would advise against using this recipe as I no intend to make a vanilla cake with my chocolate frosting.

These...are...AWESOME! Do not follow the cook time lol. I literally just made a batch for Xmas and only cooked them for about 15 minutes as another reader said, or until a toothpick came out clean. With some homemade chocolate frosting, the cupcake is soooooooo CREAMY and peanut buttery heaven! I know this will definitely be a hit and favored recipe for me!

When I first spotted this easy peanut butter cupcake recipe I jumped on board. I made the batter no problem and stuck them in the oven. After 25 minutes, the suggested cooking time, they were rock solid. The problem most likely was that I didnt have enough brown sugar so I substituted about 1/2 cup white sugar. I didnt think it would make much difference but it probably did. The taste was good but the cooking time should be decreased. Probably would taste dynamite with chocolate buttercream icing.

The frosting deserves some credit. In spite of following the recipe exactly, the cupcakes turned out dense and flavorless. I will definitely not make these again.

Great recipe. I omitted the cinammon and added chocolate-chips, then topped it off with a chocolate frosting.  The flavor was delicious, just a tad too dry for my preference.

Just pulled these out of the oven and let them cool a bit.  I haven't added the frosting yet.  The texture is a little thick and dry, but the flavor is good.  I think it needs some tweaking.

The frosting was the highlight of these cupcakes. The honey is a nice addition. Next time I will double the batch as the recipe only made 20 small cupcakes.

These cupckes were the hit of my weekly Girls' Night.  They easy to make, super peanut buttery and very creative.  I substituted half&half for the milk to make a smoother frosting.

Mine came out very "thick" and non-cake-like.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I used regular sugar because I did not have brown sugar.  Also, I didn't care for the cinnamon and I usually LOVE cinnamon.  Don't think I'd make it again.

These were great! I made a Nutella buttercream icing to go along with these instead of the peanut butter frosting. Everyone loved them! Thanks for this great recipe.

The flavor was good but I too had issues with them being way too dry which I think was because they were overdone. I followed the temp/time instructions. We only ate 3 out of the 12. :(

These cupcakes were great, I too added more milk for the frosting. I also added cooking cocoa in order to have chocolate peanut butter frosting. The only problem I had was cooking these on 350 degrees, the bottoms and sides burned, I was sooooo disapointed! DO NOT COOK ON 350 degrees!!

These cupcakes did not turn out the way I had hoped. I followed the recipe exactly (only omitting the cinnamon). The texture of the cupcakes was really dense and not moist at all. I will continue my search for the perfect moist PB cupcake recipe!

excellent recipe.  The peanut butter doesn't overpower the cupcakes.  The only change I made was half whole wheat flour, half all purpose, came out great!!

Made these exactly as the recipe states- but cooked them in the mini muffin pan.  The cupcakes weren't a wow without the frosting and too sweet with frosting.  I'm a peanut butter lover and I was a little disappointed.  Thanks for a great idea.
