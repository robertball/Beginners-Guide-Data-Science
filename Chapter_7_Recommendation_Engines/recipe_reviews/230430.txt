I didn't like the way the dressing thinned out from the liquid from the cucumber.  I would sprinkle the cucumber slices with salt and let them sit on a paper towel for a little while to draw out the extra moisture.  Then finish the recipe, adding a little extra salt, if needed.  I also finished it off with some white pepper.

A lot of you have commented about this recipe being too runny, but that's just how my grandmother made it and we used a slotted spoon when serving. However, if you would like the mixture to be thicker just blot the moisture out of the cucumbers using a paper towel before mixing them into the sauce. 

Thanks to all of you who posted positive reviews. I am glad all of you are enjoying this recipe as much as my family has over the last 100 years.

This is my favourite dressing for cucumber salad! One thing I love is that you don't really need to measure anything, just put it all together until it tastes how you like it! I always add pepper and dill to it as well!

I love this stuff. My mom made me a jar of it last summer and now it is a staple in my fridge anytime I get cukes! It is a thin dressing, but I shake before pouring. I love it alone or over a green salad. Also I dice my cukes into small pieces. Yummy!! So glad I found the recipe again!!

I liked it, I found it way too sweet so I added lots of garlic powder, Basil, Mrs. Dash. Next time I will use half the sugar asked for,  but other than that it was great, love the idea I can make it instead of buying tyvm.

This is delish! Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe. I felt the sweet to vinegar ratio was just right. If you think it is too runny, try scraping the  seeds out of your cucumbers first. That should make a big difference and only takes a minute.

I did add the onion and it was delicious.  I have never made this salad before because I am not crazy about cucumbers.  I changed my mind.  This is great.

I did not have  quite 4 cups of cucumber so I did add some onion.  I also added 2 tsp. of dried dill because I love it.  Finally I used Hellmann's vegan mayonnaise due to dairy and egg allergies in our family.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  I may live on this stuff the rest of the summer!

I sweated the cucumders for a few hours first. Makes them crisper and doesnt water down the dressing.
To sweat them. 
In a colander  add slices of cucumber. 
,add a little salt 
then fill a pot with water to set ontop to add weight  . This helps squeese the cucumber juices/water out. 
I added thinly sliced sweet onion.

My husband & I both liked this.  Made as stated but after tasting I added a bit of black pepper, a little extra salt, onion powder also, and a dash of garlic powder (I always try to stick garlic in wherever I can).  The main thing with this is CHILL  at least two hours  but then need to eat it up otherwise cucumbers get a little soggy / limp after about 4-5 hours but still good flavor wise.

The only things I did were to add salt to the cucumbers to pull out the liquid.  I let them sit for about 45 minutes to 1 hour and got a lot of liquid to drain off.  They were not runny at all.  Great recipe to make when it is HOT!

Superb! Loved the dressing. I read the reviews about it becoming to watery, so I didn't marinate them. I used it as a dressing over the cucumbers and it was delicious!

I never measure out the ingredients for this, just taste as I go. It always turns out delicious. I sometimes add finely diced onion or onion powder. I also add sour cream and dill.

Increased the amount of vinegar to 3/4 and used to packets STEVIA instead of sugar...LOVE it:  I like more vinegary than sweet. :-)

I did not like how thin the dressing was either, for some reason I expected it to be  litte thicker, so I usually play with the amounts. Every time I make it, I tinker with the amounts until I get it to my taste. It really is good though! Definitely add onions if you like onions, they all tste great together. You can let it marinate in the fridge for awhile too.
