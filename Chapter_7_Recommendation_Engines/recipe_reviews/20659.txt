Very good!  I do recommend to cut back on the onion!  I LOVE onions and I had doubled the recipe to make 8 potato's and halfed the onion's because it seemed like a lot to me and it was still very potent.  Very good though!  Thanks for the recipe! I will make this again!

These are hands down the best stuffed potatoes ever. I leave out the bread crumbs, but otherwise follow the recipe. I made them for Christmas Eve and they were a huge hit. Now I make them about once a week.

A great alternative to the usual baked potato.  It takes a little more time, but is so good!  I used reduced fat sour cream, 2% cheddar cheese and less butter and it was still delicious!  I would recomend mashing the potatoes when all of the ingrediants get into the bowl to make a more creamier mixture.  I will definately make this again! Thanks!

These have the potential to be FABULOUS, but they were way too spicy for our family's taste.  We have two little ones at home who couldn't even begin to eat these.  I generally like spicy foods, but these were a little over the top.  Next time, I'll cut the red and black pepper in half and see how it works.

Outstanding baked potatoes, even if you leave out the red pepper and the mushrooms, as I did. Thanks for sharing Jamie.

Best twice baked taters I have ever had!! 
Needed to reduce the red pepper though...too much for our taste.

Im just learning to cook, and this recipe was very simple to follow. They turned out great and my guests loved them, they even asked for the recipe! 

The first batch I made though, the filling ran out all over when in the oven. My second attempt I didnt hollow so much out of the skins and they were perfect!

Yuck!  I normally love twice-baked potatoes, but this recipe was not the best.  Too much onion, too much red pepper, and too much black pepper (and I had cut them down to begin with).  I also used huge potatoes, so I don't know what the problem was.  I won't be making these again.

This is definitely the best twice-baked potato receipe that I have came across.  If you don't like hot/spicy foods, I would suggest that you use less red pepper.  Also, I omit the bread crumb topping as I don't like the texture.

The ingredients were terrific and everybody loved this except for one thing:  too much red pepper.  The red pepper overwhelmed the other flavors.  Next time I will add half the red pepper.  And this is coming from someone who's family loves spicy food.

I tried this recipe with a few minor variations and my guests really liked it.  I used 9 small Golden Russets in lieu of the large baking potatoes, omitted the bacon (to satisfy the vegetarians) and used only 1/4 tsp. red pepper (1/2 tsp. might have been better).  The potatoes were even better the  day after--something I'll remember next time I make them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were better than I expected they would be, even with all the reviews. I mean, how fantastic can a potato be? Pretty darn fantastic. I used 1/2 a lg sweet onion and no chives. 1/4 tsp of red pepper because I can't handle anything remotely spicey and center cut bacon to lower the fat slightly. Oh, and cheddar jack cheese because that was what I had. I made up the full batch and am freezing the leftovers. Awesome recipe! Thanks.

I made this for our Christmas dinner this year.  My family likes spicy and these were pretty good but not as explosive as I imagined them (and talked them up) to be after reading prior reviews.  I made some changes - I didn't have baking potatoes, so I used Yukon Golds and rather than re-stuffing them into the shells, since they're softer and not as "reliable" containers, I lined a casserole dish with the discarded skin pieces and layered the mixture on top.  I added a few ingredients to mirror how I would build a "custom baked potato" based on what I had around the kitchen, and refrigerated the "once baked" casserole to re-bake the next day, making prep for a big family dinner much easier.   The casserole was delicious and the leftovers were quickly eaten up.  I will make this again!

They were very tasty, but it wasn't easy.  I actually ended up ripping my potatoe skin and in a panic decided to form egg shaped balls out of the mixture and baking them as instructed.  Surprisingly, they were great!  In fact, I might even make that mistake agian on purpose!

These are the Bomb!! I did change a few things. Not for kids though. I went with 1 Tbsp butter, and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper from reading the reviews. I tasted before hand knowing I could add more if needed and it did not need more than that and it was perfect!! I love the idea of the mushrooms in it! This would have been all 5 stars but I think it would be much to spicy for kids. Thanks Jamie for this wonderful recipe!

GREAT APPETIZER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Better than any restaurant version.  I used Yukon Gold Potatoes because I rarely have baking potatoes in the house.  Turned out great, crispy skins, creamy texture.  I will definately make this again.  I highly recommend .

This was the best recipe for twice baked potatoes I've ever tried. It was so delicious! I did cut the amount of red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and it was still pretty spicy. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this one for many occasions in the future.

Great stuff :)... Big winner, strongly suggested for the upcoming play offs... I grilled market steaks and sliced them over the top of each, then as a side I put out saute' onions, mushrooms, chives, bacon bits, and sour cream. Don't re-heat the meat if you are melting cheese on top, makes it over cooked 'n rubbery... Mmmm, Thanks...

Baked these for Christmas and froze six halfs to use at a later date.  Reheated today and I swear they were even better than on Christmas day.  I will most certainly make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I LIKED THESE POTATOES. I WAS SHORT ON TIME SO I MICROWAVED THEM, THEN BAKED THEM FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES. I DID NOT HAVE SOUR CREAM SO I USED RANCH DRESSING INSTEAD. TASTY.

These took a little extra time, but they were good!!!  I left out the mushrooms, and used bacon bits instead.  I also threw in some minced garlic in place of the garlic powder.  My hubby loved it as is, but I'm thinking next time, I might substitute softened cream cheese for the sour cream!  I'll be reheating them tonight and looking forward to eating them!!!

These were wonderful.  I followed the recipe closely, except I took the suggestion to use the precooked bacon - and was thankful for the shortcut.  We loved the spicy red pepper kick.

By far the best baked potatoes ever! I found the red peppers a bit much though and so only used a fraction of the recommended amount.

These were great!  I added half a bar of cream cheese and omitted the bread crumbs that was the only alteration.  My daughter is an excellent cook and she thought these were great!

DELICIOUS! I cut down the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. and also the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp. Otherwise, they were perfect! We served them at a party we hosted, and they were a huge hit and were devoured almost instantly!

I baked as directed but did not have mushrooms so didn't use them. VERY tasty but too spicy for the kids and those not used to spicy foods. I will definitely make again but cut down on the red pepper depending on who I'm making it for.

Warning! Very hot! should be on this recipe. One review said "way to spicy for her family" was absolutely right. It was rich and flavorful, very good, but needs way less pepper flakes. After all the extra time it takes to make these and then to have your children not be able to stand the heat? Disappointing, but I will definitely make again.

This recipe is incredible - best twice-baked potatoes my family's ever had!  I omitted the red peppers (based on other reviewers' comments that they made the potatoes too spicy for children) and the mushrooms (my husband doesn't care for them), and still, this side dish stole the show.

Because so many ingredients are added to the potato, I had lots of leftover "insides," so I made a cassarole with the leftovers by putting it in a cassarole dish, sprinkling it with breadcrumbs, extra cheese, and extra bacon.  It was absolutely delicious!

This time, I used reduced-fat sour cream and cheese, and half regular bacon and half turkey bacon; next time, to make it healthier, I'll use fat free sour cream and cheese, and all turkey bacon.

These potatoes were delicious! I omitted the bacon (I simply don't like it) and used only half of the cayenne (was still plenty spicy). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out better than I expected. The veggie mixture really makes the dish. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is a keeper!  I have tried several others in the past, but I will only use this one from now on.  It's the seasonings that make this recipe stand out.  I did leave out the mushrooms as a personal preference, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!!

Twice baked potatoes are one of my favorite ways to fix potatoes.  This recipe was REALLY good... The only thing I would change would be to make more of the filling.  I think my potatoes were a little larger than most and it left the filling a little dry. Even so, the potatoes were great!

I thought this recipe had too many spices even though I left out the red pepper.  The flavor didn't blend well.  I thought the potatoes were okay but not great.  My boyfriend really liked them though.

What a HIT!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for just using a dash of red pepper (because of the previous reviews) and they were perfect.  I also purchased the Hormel Fully Cooked Bacon Pieces instead of going to the trouble of cooking the bacon which turned out to be a great short cut. They turned out simply beautiful.  The mushrooms & onions added the "gourmet" touch. Even the "picky" eaters in the group loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loves this dish, but it was WAAAAAY to spicy....I'd cut down on the red and black pepper next time. I might add more mushrooms and less sour cream, also. Overall, a great recipe that I will DEFINITELY be trying again.

Some modifications I made: I added spinach and didn't include bacon or mushrooms or bread crumbs. 

They turned out pretty well - not fantastic but really good.

My husband and I LOVED it! I am glad that I made enough for left overs. The potatoes had lots of flavor! I like mushrooms, and he likes black olives so I added both. I omitted the red pepper, pepper, and chives (didn't have). I also left the bread crumbs out. The skins were so over stuffed that there wasn't room. I did top with the cheese and bacon. Also I used my mixer to cream the ingredients together.  This recipe is well worth the effort. I will definitely make this again.

I should have read all of the reviews before I cooked this.  After the fact, I agree with several of the reviewers that this was WAY to spicy.  The adults could handle it (uncomfortably) but the kids could not.  Every member of the family went racing for their drinks after the first bite.   Underneath the fire, the potatoes were acually very flavorful (how can you miss with all that butter, cheese, sour cream, and bacon).  It was a shame, therefore, that the spice deterred the family from consuming more.  I followed the recipe carefully, so I don't think the excess spice was my doing.  I used what I thought were four average baking potatoes (2.59 pounds from the receipt).  Perhaps the trick is to have four massive potatoes.  Barring that, I would recommend cutting the red pepper at least in half.  As the recipe stands, the average rating from y family was 2.3 stars.

Best twice baked potato recipe I have found.  I omit the mushrooms and use a whole green onion instead of chives.  Great flavor - I am always asked for the recipe.

Yummy each time. Don't skip on the bacon. Made this on several occasions for big family gatherings. Lots of work, but well worth the end result. Kids and adults love this!! I did not change a thing with the recipe.

I fixed this for some company last night and they were an absolute hit! I didn't have mushrooms and the didn't use the red pepper or the bread crumbs - but they still turned out awesome.  Nothing but compliments on this one.

Not only are these potatoes delicious but they are really pretty simple too.  I did make some minor changes and cut the amount of cheese and onions in half - they were seriously yummy. I did think thank that they were a little too salty but that could be because our bacon was cured by a local butcher and has a more full flavor.  Next time I will taste the filling beofre I add the salt.  : )Thanks for sharing this recipe with everyone! I will be making these for a long time.

Very good! I have never thought to put mushrooms in twice baked potatoes and we loved that addition. I was out of bacon and we don't eat onions/chives, but these were still SO good. I did cheat a little and I nuked the potatoes for a few minutes to speed it up a little bit. I only baked them in the oven for about 30 minutes, just long enough to finish baking and get the skin crispy. I'll be making these again. Thank you :)

I served this for Christmas dinner. My family knew this was new, so I asked for their genuine opinion. The general consensus was, not one person had a stuffy nose after eating these. They were so spicy. Cleared the sinuses out beautifully. Everyone agreed that the red pepper should either be cut in half or omitted all together, and the onions should be cut in half. I will make these again, but only with the tweeked recipe.

Love the spicy kick! The ONLY thing I would change about the recipe is that the potatoes need to be mashed some before adding them to the mix. Otherwise...they ought to be against the law! Will do this one again!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years, and it's always great.  You really can't go wrong with changing up the ingredients a litle bit to suit your taste.  I do not use the large baking potatoes; rather, I do as another user suggested and use small red potatoes.  I cut them in half, toss the potatoes in a little oil and salt, then bake them cut-side down until done.  This takes much less baking time than with the larger potatoes, and they make nice, small servings.  I also like to half the sour cream and add about 4 ounces of cream cheese to give them a little different taste and texture.

Wonderful recipe.  I did make a couple changes to suit my tastes.  I omitted mushrooms and the white onion.  I only added scallions.  Since a few people said it was dry and I like creamy, I added about 2 tbsp of half and half.  Was a huge hit and will use it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were fantastic!! I had no cheddar so I used 4 oz american slices and 4 oz of chipotle cheddar cheese. Because of that I eliminated the crushed red peppers. The potatoes had a nice kick to them thanks to the chipotle. I made a big batch and then froze six. Thanks for a keeper.

This is a GREAT recipe!!! 

I had been looking for a recipe like the ones my mom used to make and this is perfect.  They have a little bit of heat but not too much.

I made a few changes: I cut down a tiny bit on the onion (I buy onions from Costco, which are huge, and one large onion would have been a bit much).  I left out the mushrooms and chives because I'm not a big fan of either. I also buttered and salted the skins before baking the potatoes and instead of cooking bacon myself I just used a bottle of Hormel bacon pieces.  Mixing this is really easy if you have a KitchenAid mixer, just put all the ingredients in and let it mix for you.

I usually have to double this recipe any time my friends hear I'm making them  because they can't get enough.

Very good, but I kinda overcooked the potatoes so they were a bit dry - but the filling was awesome...was thinking - maybe trying cream cheese instead of sour cream?  Might be tasty.

I made these for Thanksgiving last year and they were requested again this year!  This is a great recipe.  I usually put in less pepper because it's a bit hot for my family, and sometimes I'll add some milk and morrell mushrooms instead of plain into the potato mixture.  I also use smaller potatoes (enough to fit in a 9*13 casserole dish) so that instead of having to cut up 4 big potatoes each person gets their own.  It's a little more work but easier to serve.  These are yummy and present beautifully!

Very good.  However, the onion flavor is mildly overpowering which is why I only did 4 instead of 5 stars.

Made a few changes but otherwise this is DELISH. Cut way down on the red pepper and a little less onion. I didn't use bread crumbs either. Next time I will cream the potatoes with the other ingredients to make it a little smoother and perhaps sale the potato skins and maybe pre-bake them a bit to make them crunchy. This is FANTASTIC.

Omitted onion & chives.  (Didn't have chives on hand).  I added onion powder and red peppers.  The bread crumbs aren't necessary and make sure to use bacon- not bacon bits!!  I did cook at 450 for 45min-1 hr.

YUM!!!  I made these to take to a dinner party for a big group and everyone LOVED them.  I did leave out the mushrooms, but left everything else as stated.  Delicious.

Oh my, so good! They're spicy but it fits my family just right.  Now, I'm a beginner so these were really a pain for me, especially scooping without ruining the skins. So, thinking ahead, I made extra potatoes for this reason. Came in handy, too, 'cause I surely messed up three skins. The extra potatoes filled the other skins more, not that they needed it. I made a huge mess and that only added to the time spent with this recipe, BUT it was well worth the trouble.  Next time I will be making a lot more because my family smashed through these so fast. I sent a few to work with my husband and they got rave reviews even as microwaved left overs. :) A new family fave, thanks!

Our family loves this recipe! The potatoes are so flavorful. I do however, agree with only adding 1/2 the onion. You still get a great taste without it being to overpowering. This recipe would also be fantastic using mini potatoes for a bite size appetizer.

These were quite popular! Mine came out a little bit too spicy to eat more than one serving. I cut the potatos in half the other way so that they were easier for people to stand and eat.

My entire family raved about this recipe! I "baked" the potatoes in the microwave to save on time. I followed the recipe only excluding items I didn't have on hand and even then I thought the flavor and texture was perfect. Thanks!!

This dish has serious potential to be delicious, but I think I did some things wrong.  I should've baked them longer so they'd be softer inside.  It was difficult to scoop the filling out.  What I did was more of a version.  I used the recipe for inspiration.  I didn't have any mushrooms, crushed red pepper, or garlic powder, so instead I added sweet red peppers (I just LOVE sweet red peppers) and onions to make up for the garlic.  I don't use crushed red pepper too often because it's too spicy for my tastes.  Other than that, I followed everything.   Nevertheless, it was delicious, and I will have to do it again, this time with EVERYTHING.

This is a great twice baked recipe! A lot of work for potatoes, but the finished product is well worth it. I add sliced black olives to this as well.   I make these in large batches and individually freeze them after refilling the skins. That way I always have a great side at the ready!

These were *unbelievably* good!  They were a bit labor-intensive (as you'd expect for twice-baked potatoes), but well worth every bit of effort.

Overall, these were pretty tasty, but WAY too much spice!  I cut the whole spice mixture in half and they had a nice burn to them.  I think next time I'll put chopped roasted peppers in instead of the spice....  I also doubled the bacon.

Four stars.. only because it wouldve been WAAAAY too pepper-y for me!
i decreased the pepper.. for myself, only 1/2 Red Pepper, 1/2 Black Pepper is sufficient.. ALSO-- I mixed the potatoes w/ an electric mixer... then stuffed the shells... WAS AWESOME OTHERWISE!!!

My family has been making twice baked potatoes every Christmas for as long as I can remember and usually a few other times a year as well - no one can beat these! Both my grandfather and my dad are amazing cooks, but this beats them both by FAR. Be careful not to put too much pepper as that can quickly overpower the recipe, but as long as you follow the recipe it's fine. I ran into trouble when I was using way more potatoes and started eye-balling things. Try to use the scaling feature to get the approximate number of potatoes you have. I'm usually not a strict recipe girl, and for the most part that's okay, but watch the pepper. But these are GOOOOD!

These are great, a fave of my husband! I usually make them with smaller potatoes, bacon bits, and low fat sour cream and cheese so that they are a bit lower in calories. They are even better leftover, aka thrice baked potatoes.

I made some adjustments to this recipe. I put just a dash of red pepper flakes, and left out the mushroom. I also used turkey bacon and fat free sour cream, and about half the amount of cheese, but they were plenty creamy and delicious! I loved the "kick" that the black pepper gave them.

My husband decided on this particular recipe when hunting for twice-baked recipes.  He used only the bacon, butter, sour cream cheese & breadcrumbs, but they were definitely some of the best I have ever eaten, and he received rave reviews from our dinner guests.

I just registered so I could tell everyone how awesome this recipe is.  I thought that my boyfriend was going to get down on one knee and propose from these potatoes alone!!  I didn't use the bread crumbs or chives.  However, I did add in a little ranch dressing into the mix.  I will be making these a lot!

Very good!  It passed the "picky husband" test with flying colors.  I substituted nonfat yogurt for the sour cream and left out the mushrooms, since he doesn't like them.  A little bit time consuming to make but definately worth the effort!

Very good!  Only change I made was to only put about half of the red pepper in, our family doesn't eat a lot of spicy foods.  Will definately make again.  Did seems a tad dry I might add some milk next time - just a touch though.

Holy pepper! I put in 1 teaspoon and all I could take was pepper. Not sure if it was the combination of red and black pepper but it was really strong. Could not taste anything else. It was really strange. I would make again but cut out the red pepper

I made this recipe for a neighborhood potluck dinner. Too bad I didn't double it as everyone loved this dish. Most of the ingredients are what you would typically have in your fridge and pantry so you could make this when compnay shows up unexpectedly. Great for holidays as well - definitely a keeper!!!

Feeding a couple of vegetarians, instead of bacon, I chopped up the remaining mushrooms and sprinkled them across the tops of the cheese covered potatoes before putting them in the oven for the last 15 minutes. It was increditasty, loved this recipie.

This recipe was great! I used 7 small potatoes instead of 4 big ones only because thats what I had on hand. I also used a taco cheese blend instead of just chedder. If you like a little spice this recipe is perfect.

Made these for a New Years Eve dinner and everyone loved them. I personally thought they were a little hot and peppery but even my picky husband raved about them.

Great crowd pleaser.  A little time consuming but easy.  I left out the bread crumbs and red peppers.  I also added some bacon into the mixture, not just sprinkled on top and added extra butter into the mixture, which melted great into the potato skin "boat" and made it more moist and flavorful.  Endless compliments!!

These were fantastic!!! I didn't have any mushrooms or bacon, but they were awesome anyhow. Next time I will make sure I have them on hand. I also didn't have large baking potatoes. I only had four regular sized so I halved the recipe and just used those measurements instead. Delicious!!!

These were SO good!  A huge hit.  They are kind of time consuming to make, but worth it to make a big smash.  I didn't have kids eat them...but my guess would be that there would be too much going on in them for kids to like 'em.  Red peppers added just enough extra kick!  Yum!!!!!

i less than halved the amount of red pepper, and felt it was STILL to spicy (i like spicy food) and overpowered the rest of the flavor-- which was wonderful!!!  next time i will definitely omit the red pepper!  and there will definitely be a NEXT time for these!!!!

Amazing with the kick of red pepper flakes!  bread crumbs could be left out though.  I made a bunch and froze then before the second bake.  can't wait to have them more often.  a big hit!

Excellent!  Depending in the size of the potatoes, bakers are pretty big (!), I'd personally make more of the mushroom and onion mix!  I also added corned beef seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper, fried up, to the bottom of the potatoes covered with a bit of cheese.  The left over corned beef, I mixed up into the potato mixture!  Definitely a hit!

I adjusted the recipe for making 10.  When I got 2 1/2 onions chopped, I decided that it was twice as many onion as I wanted so I did not use at least half.  Otherwise, it went well.  We used a paring knife to loosen the potato from the skin and scooped it out with a spoon.  This sped up that portion of the process nicely.  Enjoy!

This recipe is great; and i will be making this 

I didn’t get a chance to make it the first time because,  I used the wrong kind of potato 

At the end of my potato disaster all I had was unserveable mush!! 

Lesson learned!!!

This had great depth of flavor. I didnt have sour cream so I subbed in milk then put the whole mix in the food processor. It turned out cream and delicious. Word of warning- I halved the cayenne and it still had a little kick.

I made no changes, and it came out perfectly.  The potatoes were a great success at the pot luck, and the leftovers were great for lunch!  I loved the addition of mushrooms in the filling - made for a special potato!

I doubled the recipe, came out delicious but it is very rich tasting. I used half sour cream and half cottage cheese(to equal the amount of sour cream called for in recipe). I added onions per recipe. My son doesn't like onions except onion rings, so i figured if he will eat onion rings he will do fine with this. He is picky, but he said he liked them. I also added 2 tsp. of dill. instead of Chives because I did not have Chives. Next time I will make it more potato-ee. ;)

The potatoes were amazing and my whole party enjoyed them too. However, I backed off the red peppers and onions. I also added some of the bacon grease for extra flavor. For the bread crumbs I used salad croutons and used a lot more than the recipe called for.

These were really yummy!!  I didn't have crushed read pepper so I added 2 tsp of cumin and they had quite a bite to them.  I would omit next time.  I also added a little ranch to the mixture.

Very good.  Especially when topped with extra, cold sour cream.  I think there was too much red and black pepper, but my bf liked it.

I had some baked potatoes left over from last night that I decided to use in this recipe.  Of course it was more difficult to get the potato flesh out, and hard to mash but the finished product was still very good. I omitted mushrooms and crumbs and reduced red pepper. I probably used more bacon than called for as I don't measure bacon, or cheese for that matter. Just eye-ball how much I want to use.  Baked at 400f for half an hour.  We really enjoyed this for lunch today and I will prepare it again.

I made this for Christmas a couple years ago and my son in law who hates mushrooms LOVED it - as did everyone else!  It takes a while to make it, but it is definately worth it.  I also made a batch a few months later and froze them individually - work great!  This recipe doesn't need any changes!

We were going to make baked potatoes tonight with our steak but I wanted to spice up the potatoes a little bit so I found this recipe. I thoroughly enjoyed these potatoes. Followed the recipe exactly. Just a great accompaniment to any meat dish, superb alternative to plain baked potatoes. There was a bit of prep-work involved, but in the end it was worth it.

I made these without the bacon as I am a vegetarian. I upped the amount of mushrooms to one cup. Only added in half the sour cream (used the light version)and added a handful of grated cheese to the mixture. Once I put the stuffing in, I topped each potato with bread crumbs, sprinkle of cheese, and some chives again. This was VERY filling, I ate this as my main with a spinach salad. My family members enjoyed this as well.

Very, very good. Because it was very time consuming to scoop out the potato without damaging the skins, the next time I make these I might boil semi-peeled, cubed potatos and mash them with the sour cream, etc.  Then I would use a caserole for the mixture, top it with the remaining ingredients and bake the dish for the recommended 15 min.  I bet it would taste just as good and be quicker to make.

I made these for a party and they turned out great. I was able to make them before hand, freeze, and just pop them in the oven. No stress!! I left out the bacon, because it already had so much flavor, and sprinkled with paprika for color. YUM!!!!

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE! They were a BIG hit! I didn’t put in the mushrooms or breadcrumbs and instead of crushed red pepper I put in ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper. I don’t like chunks of onions in my food so when the onion mixture was done cooking I used an immersion blender to liquefy it.

I have made many twice baked or stuffed potatoes and these are the BEST by far. I can tell that this recipe is going to be in my family for years to come, Thank you so much.

The portions were enormous, way too much onion.  I would cut the all the ingredients in half to portion correctly, then I would cut the onions in half again.  Also, the crushed red pepper gave it a snap, but some people have a problem with peppers, so consider who you are serving this to before putting in the crushed red peppers. Or put in less.

I did not use the mushrooms or the onions (my husband hates them), so I substituted onion powder. This recipe was really good, it is just very tedious to make. I would not suggest using regular russet potatoes, the taste ended up a little off and the filling tasted better alone. The next time I will use the better quality baking potatoes.

These were good!  Except that I messed up and used 2x the amount of sour cream.  I was so bummed about that but actually they were still good.  Maybe a tad too much heat from the red pepper, may cut back on that for next time.  Went great with our prime rib for Christmas dinner.

WOW! These potatoes took FOREVER to cook. I wish I had popped them in the microwave first before I baked them. I have had them in over an hour and they're STILL too firm. I'd love to try them but I can't get them to finish cooking!!

This recipe is great!  To cut down on fat, I used fat-free sour cream, and stick margarine to saute the onion.  For my family's weak tastebuds (the little wimps) I had to cut the crushed red pepper way down, to almost less than 1/4 tsp! Oh well, still great!  Oh, and I did use more chives, and added a pinch of chopped garlic to the onion to sautee.  Fantastic!

My Fire Dept has an annual appreciation party for our wives, and I used this recipe. HUGE  SUCCESS!!  I omitted the bread crumbs because I didn't hve any. I also omitted the mushroom, because too many people didn't want them,(I will definately use them next time). Great recipe. I had many people tell me they don't like "twice baked's", but they loved these. Will add to "favorites"!!!

MMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!  I inhaled these!  I bought precooked and crumbled bacon and omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them but these REALLY hit the spot.  This has become one of my top favorite potato dishes and I can't wait to make them again!

Yumm!  Pretty much followed the recipe except left out the bread crumbs.  Had these growing up without the onions and mushrooms--I like it with these new ingredients and plan to make it this way from now on.

These are by far the best twice baked potatoes I've ever had.  The red pepper adds a nice kick.  They're always requested for special occasion dinners.

These were really good.  Mind, we changed up the recipe a bit.  Cut out the onions and mushrooms and therefore just added melted butter to the mix instead of the saute step.  And we cut the red pepper (we have small children), but they came out AWESOME.  I think I would recommend using more than 4 potatoes though.  We used about 8 medium/small ones.

This is the second time I've made these and they are awesome.If you use baking potatoes(large), can cut them in half length wise and then in half because they're so big you won't be able to eat anything else.

These turned out pretty good, I was surpised at how strong the taste was. If using as a sidedish, choose a main entree that doesnt is pretty mild. I could see that the taste could be overpowering.

Searched several sites for this recipe, found this one, made it and loved it, did tweak it like I do all my cooking, but was still great, and, BTW All4ply2, saw that "adjustment" on the Foodnetwork site, for the salt and prescoring the potato, didn't find that hint useful

I am giving these a 3 because my fiance said they weren't bad.  I couldn't bring myself to eat one.  They looked pretty gross to me.  Potato mixture seemed very dry.  Maybe adding some milk would help.  Don't think I'll make these again. Sorry. :(

AWESOME!!!!  The pepper was just right!  (My wife and kids who are slightly wimpy did not agree.)  I think maybe half the black pepper for the less adventureous.  Seriously: cheese, bacon, red pepper, sour cream and potato... how could this go wrong?  Make this for dinner TONIGHT!!!

This was a wonderful change of pase. For my family, I cut back on the red pepper flakes and the black pepper.   I omitted the bread crumbs and only fried up 3 slices of bacon.  
Next time, I will add some chopped pimento for a change.  

I enjoyed the left overs heated in the microwave just as much.  

Thanks, Jamie, for sharing your recipe.

I make these for special occasions. I don't add bread crumbs, as this recipe calls for. They are time consuming, especially scraping the potato shells. But, they are SO good, definitely worth the effort. Also, they freeze and reheat well.

I microwaved the potatoes to save time but it was still a little time consuming. I omited the chili pepper but my family LOVED it! The mushrooms carmelized beautifly into the potatoe mixture and just gave it a wonderful flavor. Definately a keeper!

I too left out the mushrooms and bacon, I was aiming for a creamy texture.  I would make this again but will reduce the amount of red pepper as it was too spicy to really enjoy.

THESE TWICE BAKED POTATOES ARE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY YOU'D ORDER IN A RESTAURANT.  HOWEVER, I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I WAS NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO INCLUDE MUSHROOMS, BREADCRUMBS OR CHIVES IN THE MIX.  THESE POTATOES WERE EXCELLENT, HOWEVER IF YOU DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING WITH EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF SPICE OR IF YOU ARE SERVING THIS TO A CHILD, I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF CRUSHED RED PEPPERS.  THESE WERE A HIT AT A DINNER PARTY THAT I HAD; I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE THEM AGAIN.
