This is fantastic. The flavors are perfectly balanced. I topped it with some bacon. Thank you for the recipe.

Interesting soup. Definitely different. Will likely make it again, though I don't think I like it as well as the carrot soup with the coconut milk also on this website.

This was delicious and very straight forward to make. I doubled the recipe and I took the advice of not roasting the veggies ahead of time and just boiling them instead. It saved a lot of time! The tahini adds a great flavour to the soup and the hint of cardamon is delicious. Will definitely be saving this recipe to make again in the near future!

This is a restaurant quality soup that is easy to make. All the spices are right on! My only recommendation would be to add about 10 extra minutes to the roasting time if your carrots do not soften enough.
