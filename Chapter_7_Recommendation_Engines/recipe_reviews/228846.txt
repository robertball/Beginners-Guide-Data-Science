For us this needed some celery added to the 'stuffing' which is what is really is.  Note - toss the bread cubes when you turn the chicken - I needed to add a little broth to the edge of the pan to moisten the cubes of bread.

I took the reviewers advice and added celery after sautéing it and the onion until the onion was translucent. I also had Mrs Cubbison’s traditional seasoned stuffing on hand and used it as my substitution for the bread, it was amazing.
I will definitely make it again . Thank you
