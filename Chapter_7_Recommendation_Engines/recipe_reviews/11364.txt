Well, I LOVE this recipe. I did have to make some changes in the proportions though, which is why I didn't rate it 5 stars.  It takes at least 1.5 sleeves (6+ oz) of saltines to fill up that pan size. Definitely use foil and spray it liberally with non-stick spray.  To get the appropriate coverage, you HAVE to use 1.5 cups butter and 1.5 cups brown sugar.  I've tried it with less, and you end up with crackers with very little toffee on them.  I used a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and probably 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, and also found that a little over a cup of finely chopped nuts was perfect.  I can't imagine using more.  So yes, I changed the proportions on everything....and the end result is perfection, in my mind.

I make this recipe every year and while it's simple and delicious, here are a few precautions: 1. Line the tray with foil to make it easier to remove the toffee 2. Don't use those chocolate chips that have been sitting around opened for months! They will not melt as well as ones that are "fresh" out of the bag! 3. Up proportions to 1.5butter:1.5sugar to make sure all crackers are properly covered!

I make these on a regular basis, but call them 'Skor Bars'.  These are always a huge hit.  One thing that is not mentioned is that your pan MUST be sprayed/greased very well, or else it all sticks.  I always use the unsalted crackers and milk choco chips (gives it more of a choco bar taste), and on occasion will use the peanut butter chips, but they don't melt as well...But still taste great!!!  Put into the freezer as soon as the chocolate is spread.  Speeds up the breaking and tasting process.  Can be kept frozen for a long time.

For starters, this taste wonderful. My whole family enjoyed the taste. I did change a few things after reading all the reviews though. I lined my pan with no-stick foil, it stuck. That was the first time EVER that I had anything stick to no-stick foil. Next time, and I will be making it again, I will use the no-stick foil and I will be spraying it with Pam first. I also used Club crackers instead of Saltines. I just thought being a "toffee" taste, Club would work better. I also increased the sugar and butter by 1/2 cup each like some suggested. Well, maybe it needed to cook a little longer because of that? There are parts of it that are pretty sticky even after spending all day and night in the fridge. I think next time I will stick with the original 1 cup of each and see how that works. Also, I didn't have any problems getting the chopped pecans (I'm not a walnut fan) to stick to the top. I used milk chocolate chips and only had to let them sit for a couple of minutes before I easily spread them over the top. Then after I sprinkled the chopped pecans over the top, I just used my hand to press the pecans down into the chocolate a little, worked just fine. Over all this is a great recipe and it has a wonderful taste. I will be trying it again with Club crackers, milk chocolate and pecans, but I will be sticking to the original 1 cup each of butter and sugar.

This is an awesome quick and EASY treat to make anytime!! Everyone who tried them asked for the recipe. I will probably make a little more of the brown sugar/butter mixture(1/2 cup extra of both) to put over the top so it's more evenly covered next time. I use 1 1/2 sleeves of crackers too. Also put them in the fridge for an hour before breaking them apart. I used crushed pecans instead of walnuts.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

Wow...my husband loves toffee and he loved this.  I had a box of crackers that had been crunched so I sprinkled broken crackers over the pan instead of using whole ones.  It worked great.  Don't use parchment because the toffee part can go under and then you have paper in your candy.  Really great and easy!

This is fabulous!!! It is so easy to make, and people can't believe what the ingredients are. I melted the butter and sugar in the microwave, and I omitted the nuts, but sprinkled on little colorful Christmas trees. It was a huge hit!!!

I could not believe how super easy this recipe is. I enjoy making candy from scratch and when I saw this recipe, thought I'd give it a try. Wow...yummy! I used pecans on the top. For those that do not want most of their nuts to fall off the top, once the stove top cooking is done (of the toffee mixture) stir in half of your chopped nuts at this point prior to pouring on the crackers and bake it up including them. Save the remainder for topping the chocolate. It's not very heart smart, but my tongue and family sure are happy! Will try it again with almonds and see if it tastes like almond roca.

These are good but I think I'll add 1/2 c. of sugar and butter next time, or else use a  smaller pan.  We left the crackers whole and cut them out into squares and dipped in chocolate.  I will make these again.

This is too good that you'll want to eat the whole thing yourself !  I made only a couple of changes.  Instead of using nuts, I used Rice Krispies (blending them in at the same time as I added the chips).  [I used krispies since I wanted my 2 year old to have some.]  Next time I'll make a batch with nuts too (as I think it would be less sweet with the nuts on them).  I also used light brown sugar instead of regular (not sure what the difference would have been, but that's what I had).  I also used Smart Balance 50/50 butter instead of regular butter and it tasted great and possibly a little less fattening.  Any suggestions from anyone to make these less sweet?  [I also sprayed the pan with Pam and didn't bother with the aluminum]

mmmmmmm...very yummy and easy. We put ours in the freezer, which made them taste extra good. Keep in mind, though, that these don't last a super long time. The saltine flavor will eventually come through and they may get a little soggy.

The recipe should be made as instructed. You need to use just the 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar otherwise it will end up chewy and it will stick no matter what you line the pan with (parchment paper actually works best). Don't worry about it not covering every millimeter of the crackers--when you put it in the oven it will bubble and fill in the cracks. One bag of chocolate chips is fine and you need to use semi sweet or it is too sweet. I take the pan out of the oven and wait until the bubbling goes down before I put on the chocolate chips. If they don't warm right away to spread easily, pop the pan back in the still-warm oven for just a few seconds. I stir my butter and brown sugar with a silicon spatula while it is boiling and use the same to spread the chips--it should still be slippery/buttery and the chocolate won't stick as much to the spatula. Saltines are the best cracker choice to give that salty caramel flavor. You should need precisely one sleeve if you have the kind that come 40 to a sleeve and use a 10x15 pan as instructed. The saltines I used (Meijer brand) are not exactly square so I put them width-wise along the top in a row of 5 and then down in columns of 8. It should fit the pan exactly. I always have good luck with this recipe following these instructions.

Yummy! I stuck with the original amounts of butter and brown sugar called for, because my pan could only fit 1 sleeve of crackers. My crackers were covered perfectly! If your pan requires you to use 1.5 sleeves or 2 sleeves of crackers, then it only makes sense to increase butter & sugar amounts as suggested by other reviewers. I boiled my buttery sugar mix for a full 3 min, until it was nice and thick. It set up quickly. I put my pan in the freezer to speed the process and used foil with non-stick spray. The bars came out easily. Everyone LOVED these buttery crisp bars! They are absolutely joining my cookie/bar tray and would make a great holiday gift for neighbors, friends or work!!

I love the toffee, but am unsure about the crackers in there.  I probably wouldn't even notice if I didn't know...  My kids all loved it and said they couldn't taste the crackers.  Super easy though.  Make sure you use the right size of pan if you want the proportions to work out right.  The recipe calls for a 10x15 pan, NOT a full sized cookie sheet.  I left off the nuts and used milk chocolate chips.  The 2 cups was a bit much for me, so I would use 1 cup next time.  I think I would also up the butter and brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups next time to have a bit more toffee on the crackers.

Sweet, rich, gooey and did I mention sweet?  Loved the taste of the salt from the crackers and the sweetness of the brown sugar and butter mixture.  I made these for Girls Night Out this month and everyone loved them.  This would make a nice addition to a cookie tray at the holidays.  Thanks LMDINCO for sharing.

I used 1-1/2 cups white sugar and 1-1/2 cups butter to which I added a few drops of mint extract. Topped with melted Giardelli white chocolate that I first colored with green food coloring, for a "french chocolate" appearance.

I thought these sounded really good, and I followed the recipe exactly (although I used pecans rather than walnuts). The crackers ended up soggy from the carmel/toffee, and even though I really sprayed the pan well, they were really hard to get out of the pan. These will end up in the garbage.

Perfect and so fast and easy to make!  Followed recipe using milk choc chips and pecans.  Think I will reduce nuts by 1/2 C next time.  By the way, 4 oz. saltines is one sleeve.  I let the pan cool for an hour or so and then put into the refrigerator for another hour.  Lifted a corner edge and started breaking apart.  No problem removing from the pan.  This recipe will be a family favorite - thanks!

We have always called this "Christmas Crack" because it is so addicting.If you use the right size pan one sleeve will fill it perfectly and the listed ingredients are just the right amount. I can't believe some had trouble melting the chocolate, it just came out of the oven at 375 degrees the chips are spreadable within 30 seconds. I use a small offset spatula to spread. I never spray the pan because sometimes it makes the crackers soggy and have never had any trouble removing the candy. We make gift baskets to give out at Christmas and each basket gets a half batch of milk chocolate topping and half batch of peppermint topping. I use mint chips and chop up a bunch of candy canes to put on top. These are such a hit with friends they ask for a double batch of crack and forget the rest.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I can't believe I waited so long to try this, it's AWESOME and so easy too! I did have an issue w/ my chocolate chips not spreading (I have no idea why), so I just took them off and spread some melted confectioners coating on top and then drizzled w/ more once they dried. This is a definite keeper...I will be making this often (which is a good AND bad thing, as I can't stop eating it, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

this recipe is great.  I made & baked it just as written.  I found that 2 cups of walnuts was way too much and I finely chopped them as mentioned to the instructions... that was a bad move on my part.  After tasting I think I would have preferred milk chocolate over semi sweet.  I thought the semi sweet added a little too much bitterness.  I'll make them again but with a few tweaks.  Thanks for sharing

Everyone loved this one!  I used a mixture of semi sweet, milk, and white choc chips and they didn't melt well the first time.  The next time I used milk choc chips and white choc and they melted great! (1 sleeve did fine with the 1 cup each of butter and br sugar.. I used a small baking pan lined with parchment paper)

This is one of my favorite things to make.  Adults and kids love it and it is soooo  easy to make.  A definite go-to recipe when you need something quick.  I have used saltines, Club and graham crackers.  I can't say that I noticed much difference between the saltines and Club crackers.  The graham crackers are good, but I like the saltiness of the others.  I usually don't use pecans or nuts on top.  They are just as good without it.  I use dark chocolate chips and keep them refrigerated or else the chocolate is messy to handle.  Love, love these!!!

These are delicious!  I sprayed the foil with butter flavored cooking spray and had no problem with sticking.  I have made this with pecans and chopped almonds - both were delicious.  I did not have to increase the amounts of any of the ingredients as some other reviewers suggested.  I think these are perfect as the recipe is written.  I keep these in the freezer and love eating them straight from the freezer. If only I could stay away from the freezer.  They don't last long in my house.

This is one of my favorite desserts and I lost the recipe I had for it.  Luckily, I found this!  I really recommend using a smaller pan as opposed to uping the ingredients, simply because its more economical that way and you may already have everything you need on hand.  One sleeve of crackers lining the pan and then all the proportions given (I used a few less nuts than recommended) filled the pan perfectly. I also sprayed Pam on my spatula before spreading the chocolate.  This is a keeper!

Okay this was soooooo good. I followed other people’s advice and used three sticks of butter and 1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar (all I use) for the toffee portion and that covered the crackers perfectly (about a sleeve and a half). I also used almonds instead of walnuts out of necessity. I covered my baking sheet with foil and sprayed it generously with non stick spray, and clean up was a snap. These were awesome! Everyone was asking for the recipe! BTW it is so easy to make as well! A win win. Thanks for the recipe! I’ll be using this many times over!

It tasted great but it didn't stick together very well.  It just sort of crumbled apart.  I think i may have just had too much crackers (mine were crushed) and not enough butter/brown sugar.

Tastes just like a Skor chocolate bar! If you've got a sweet tooth, you'll be satisfied with this recipe.  1 and a half cups each of butter and sugar covered the crackers evenly. I only used 1 cup of chopped walnuts and it was plenty. Thank u!

Good, but soooo sweet. SWEETER somehow, then a Skor bar. We used chopped and toasted pecans and they cut some of the sweetness but I still don't see us eating the whole pan! We'll rate 4 stars because - yes, it's good, but way too sweet for us. 

ALSO - PLEASE MEASURE YOUR PANS BEFORE YOU TELL PEOPLE TO RESCALE THIS RECIPE. I think some of you are using a 12x17 (the large, jelly-roll size). 

A 10x15 (med size in my Chicago Metallic set) works PERFECTLY and fits all but 2 (if I recall) crackers from a SINGLE SLEEVE of crackers. The recipe is perfectly written. And yes, use the amt of nuts it calls for, they really help cut the sweetness.

Quick and easy snack that everyone loves! As others mentioned, I line the cookie sheet with tin foil and that always works great. I also increased the sugar and butter to 1.5c but I used a larger pan. Be sure to cover the entire pan with crackers (edge to edge)--I cut them to fit if necessary.

This recipe went over very well with my husband and my mother.  I kept the ratios on track with the recipe and thought they were fine.  I didn't want a super thick candy on the crackers and I felt like these were still pretty rich.

I've made this recipe for lots of events and everyone loves it.  I've even accidentally burnt the sugar slightly when cooking and it's still delicious.  One more idea...I take the smaller broken pieces and crush them as an ice cream topping.  Yum!

I had had this before, and was searching for the recipe again when I found this. I followed the recipe exactly, and 4 oz of crackers (one sleeve) was the perfect amount for the suggested pan size. This was what I was looking for, great recipe and thank you!

I did this recipe EXACTLY as printed. The secret of not sticking witout using any spray or liner is to let this completely set up before trying to lift it from the pan. 1-1.5 cups of nuts would have been less wasteful. Also, you don't need to go edge to edge with the crackers. Just pour/spread the glaze carefully near the edges. Excellent taste, and the saltine lend a nice crunch. Breaks into bark nicely.

Best and easiest dessert ever!!  Definitely spray some aluminum foil before arranging the crackers...makes it so much easier to break apart and clean up after.  With using more butter and sugar you need to boil the toffee a bit longer, otherwise it gets grainy as it cools.  Also, I didn't use walnuts, but put skor (or toffee) chips on top.  All my friends love this recipe and ask for it all the time...if they only knew how easy it was to make!!

I tried this with disaster results. The amount for filling is double the amounts in previous recipe by Baker's. 1 C. butter, 1 C sugar & 2C of Chips in a 10.x 15 pan??. Wow the crackers were soggy, greasy and so sweet. The previous recipe that my friend made was much crisper and tasty.

these are delicious -- word of warning - do NOT refrigerate before cutting - even if they are soft, cut and place on wax paper, you will save yourself a lot of trouble.

These are amazing! I've made them a few times and they are devine! What REBEKAHMO said about needing more butter and sugar is true if you use a regular size cookie sheet but if you follow what the recipe calls for and use a 10 x 15 its perfect. I leave out the walnuts because I dont like nuts and its delicious! Ive made this a few times in the past month and its now my go-to dessert! So easy and addictive!

This is a great simple recipe.  I used the sprayed foil.  Used unsalted crackers and increased the butter to 1 &1/2 cup.  Used 1/2 cp splenda brown sugar (this equals 1 cup regular brown sugar) and 1/2 cup regular brown sugar.  Covered with heath pieces and topped with semisweet chocolate chips.  Soooo good!  Thanks for an easy flexible recipe!

I absolutely love these and they are quick and easy to make.  Spray the pan as other users suggested!!  I also use milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, toffee pieces (heath bar crunch) and sliced almonds.  This recipe has made me one popular mommy!

Had to use gluten-free crackers--they are very thin and increasing the recipe to 1.5 cups of butter/sugar was a bad idea. I have used the recipe as described and still am having trouble with consistency. It seems simple and they are very good. Any ideas?

This was an easy dessert and we had all of the ingredients on hand, but it was not quite the flavor we were hoping for. I think I was hoping for something more like almond roca.

A friend gave me these with the recipe at Christmas many years ago. Very easy. Very tasty! Just leaving a note to point out that Nabisco now makes Preminum MINIS original saltine crackers which make this recipe even easier! The recipe instruction state "finely chopped" walnuts. Finely chopped is very important when using the new minis.

Decadent! This candy is absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Yes, it looks a bit odd when you are preparing it (mainly the saltines "floating" in a mixture of brown sugar and melted butter), but the end result is well worth it.  I used pecans because that is what I had on hand, and I may cut the nuts back to 1-1/2 cups next time.  My husband and I both agreed that there definitely will be a next time for this recipe!

These are spectacular, and so easy!  I made two batches and gave them away as Christmas gifts.  Everyone was so shocked that I 'slaved' in the kitchen to make toffee.  :-p  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I was so happy with this recipe. I made it for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit!  I LOVED it. It was SO easy to make, it took about 15 minutes, and it was fun. Everyone raved! Thanks for this scrumptious crunch bar.

I had bars like these a long time ago and wanted to find the recipe. They didn't stick to the foil, and were very easy to make. There was no butter in the house, so I used margarine which worked out very well!

These are so good! The saltine crackers give just enough flavor to even out the sweet.  Great for kids to help with too.

Great recipe !! I made then with club crackers & used milk chocolate toffee chips. 
The nuts didn't stick as well because of the toffee BUT who cares!  I ate all of the nuts that fell off.

It takes no time to make & is great for a last minute dessert.

Thanks.

!!! This tastes EXACTLY like a Heath bar! It's uncanny. I absolutely love Heath bars so I'm super excited right now. 

I only used one cup of walnuts, which I thought was plenty. However, I should note that my pan size was slightly smaller: 9x13.

I also took others' advice and used 1.5 cups of butter and brown sugar, but for the 9x13 pan I would maybe do 1 + 1/4 cups of each in the future.

Two hints that I have for you... 1. Use a silicone baking mat on your biggest cookie sheet.  Getting the crackers off is so easy, and cleanup is great!  2. I melt the chocolate chips in the microwave (2 minutes on High) and kind of pour/spoon on/smooth out as I go along. I've been known to do that with the butter/brown sugar "sauce" too.

My family loved it!! The only change i made, was adding crushed pretzel pieces. I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Will definitely be making this again, and again.

I love toffee and make my Mother's butter crunch all of the time.  I had this at a B&B we visited and decided to try making it instead.  It is so easy and almost fail proof.  I Sprinkled mine with pistachios that I chopped.  They were really good.  I will make this one again many times.

I have nicknamed these "crack" because they are so addictive. Everyone who tries them loves them and I'm not exaggerating. I follow the ingredients/proportions listed in recipe and they come out perfect every time. I usually bake them for a couple minutes longer than the recipe says, but I don't really know why, honestly; I guess I just like to be different. I line the pan with aluminum foil and then after I finish making them, I put the pan in the freezer for a little while, until they've cooled and hardened. After I remove them from the freezer, I lift the entire "cookie" up on its side and peel off the foil. Yes, sometimes it tears funny and some little scraps are left behind, but they are easy enough to peel off. Between doing that and cutting them up, I end up with a ton of crumbs, but I keep them in a baggie in the fridge and use them as sundae toppings. Delicious!

Does anyone have the finished product turn out really hard to chew?  Sometimes mine are easy to chew and sometimes mine are really hard to chew and I don't know what the secret is!  The flavor is outstanding!  we love that!!

My neighbor is famous for these, and I was nervous to make them!, but I did and they were awesome!! I did follow the Most Helpful Positive Review, which was great advice. I used the Saltines with Sea Salt, and lined the tray with foil and sprayed with cooking spray-I put them in the fridge for a hour till the chocolate hardened, and I had no issues removing them from the tray...the only problem with these is I cannot stop eating them!!

I made this with the matzo crackers and used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar (allergic to cane sugar), took them out of the oven when the 7 minute timer beeped…could smell the burnt sugar as I opened the oven door! Have only tried the outside edge , but I think the whole pan is burned on the bottom. I was really looking forward to these.

We love these, but make sure the sides of your baking pan are tall enough (mine were not and I had an ugly smokey mess). My family looks forward to these every holiday season.
