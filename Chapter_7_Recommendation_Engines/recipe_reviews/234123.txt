delicious soup. I didn't blend up the bacon but that was only change... other than dummy me forgetting to buy Parmesan cheese. I liked this served cold! And I did add the optional red pepper

I loved this recipe! The only changes I made was I had to use vegetable broth instead of chicken and I saut√©ed the onion and bacon first. This would be a great recipe to can up for winter with the abundance of zucchini in the summer!

Tasty soup very similar to a traditional split pea. So similar that I may try with a ham bone next time. To honor the "creamy" description I may substitute the water for half & half next time to up the fatty flavor. Great the way it is though - sopping up with a loaf of ciabatta. Thank you!
