Although the flavor is pretty good, our beans would not soften in the least, even with extended cooking time.  This is not a recipe that I would use uncooked pinto beans in, again.

Beans didn't get nearly soft enough, but wow was that meat delicious! I may just use the first part of this recipe for my chucks from now on. Falling apart tender and flavored deliciously all the way through. I almost ruined my dinner by snacking on it as I was shredding.

Awesome recipe but I suggest you soak the dry beans overnight.

My family has fallen in love with this recipe.  Very savory and the only thing we change is how much cumin we put in.  Otherwise such a great dish!
