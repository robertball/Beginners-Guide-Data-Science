This recipe is AWESOME!!  It had a yummy taste, and the perfect consistancy. It didn't have the jelly like consistancy some peacan pies have.  I actually used mixed nuts because I didn't have enough pecans.

This is very rich and delicious. If you're looking for a traditional chocolate pecan pie recipe, this isn't it. You want something with corn syrup and less chocolate. But if you're looking for something that actually tastes good, do this! (Try with Ghiradelli chocolate, yum)

Though this pie does not have the traditional pecan pie consistancy, it is one of the most amazing pies i have ever had!  It was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving last year.  The chocolate part is so good that I could even see myself leaving out the nuts and just making a chocolate pie!  The recipe for the chocolate part closely resembles my fudge recipe.  You will love this pie! YUM!

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I was trying to recreate a chocolate pecan pie that I often had as a child, (it was store bought frozen) and this was on right on the mark.  This has a nice fudgy cake like consistency with a nice slightly crunchy top, plus the pecans.  The ONLY thing I changed was to decrease the pecans, I used 1 cup of pecans and it came out pretty and perfect and delicious.  Thanks very much for the recipe.

This really is chocolate torte w/ pecans. I loved it but the kids didn't. It is VERY rich and VERY dense. Needs to be renamed, yummy if you want a torte, too rich if you are looking for a choc. pecan pie.

The best pie I have ever eaten. This pie was so easy and turned out so good. It tastes like a chocolate chess pecan pie so yummy! The only problem I found with this pie is I could not stop eating it and in Two days ate the whole pie myself! WOW.

Definitely NOT a traditional Pecan Pie.  Still really yummy, but its really important to know that it is more like a brownie in a pie crust.

This pie is wonderful.  I heated it a little and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with whipped cream!!!  It was a big hit.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dessert in addition to the traditional pumpkin pie. It was delicious With a spoonful of whipped topping. I used pecan halves on top and got rave reviews just on the look of the pie. Warning: this is not a traditional gooey pecan pie. If you want that, don't make this recipe. Otherwise, enjoy!

I made this pie for a church supper and everyone raved about it. It is very easy to make and would be delicious heated up with ice cream or fresh whipped cream. It is very rich so a little bit goes a long way. Yum!

The taste was good & it was very easy. But I was disappointed because I was trying to make my mom a chocolate pecan pie with the jelly consistency & this was just chocolate pie with pecans in it. But I should've known from the ingredients -- I had never made a pecan pie so I didn't know. I wouldn't make it again--I'd rather have a regular chocolate pie. But others might like it, especially since it was so easy!

Really more of a brownie pie and not a good one at that.  Very dry and blah.  Will try a more "traditional" choc pecan pie recipe next time.

This recipe is very good, but the name is very misleading. This is NOT a pecan pie. It is more of a chocolate tart with pecans. It is not gewy at all. It comes out firm and chocolatey. I made half of the filling to fill a tart shell, which is less deep than a pie shell. Perfect amount. Tastes very good. However, a real chocolate pecan pie would have been more appreciated according to everyone who had some :). 
Anyway, very easy to make, and quite tasty for a chocolate pecan tart. Good use of leftover sweetened condensed milk! Thanks!

A very easy, delicious and impressive pie to make!  To make it better, top with chocolate whipped cream. To make it even better, add a teaspoon of creme de cacao to the whipped cream.  Yum.

the first time i made this it was a little dense for our taste; the second time i used a whole can of sweetened condensed milk instead of 2/3 and it was much better - more the consistency of pecan pie but with the yummy chocolate flavor!

Excellent pie, however a bit hard to cut. No wonder with all the pecans and chocolate. It was not as rich as I expected, which is a real plus.

I made this for a gathering of friends and it was a big hit.  Very dense and fudgy.  Because I was using a deep-dish pie plate, I used the entire 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk and about 1 and 1/3 cups of chocolate chips, but didn't increase any of the other ingredients.  I served it chilled with whipped cream.  I'll definitely be making this again.

everyone loved this one...not as gooey as traditional but delicious.  I used a deep pie crust because there was so much filling.  I also only had low fat sweet condensed milk but it didn't seem to make a difference.

Very good pie.  The consistency is nothing like a traditional pecan pie.  This is like fudge in a pie crust with a crunchy brownie top.

Freaky good pie - much more chocolate than pecan but absolutely incredible - i prefer to serve cold which allows it to set up very well - do yourself a favor and print several copies of the recipe before guests arrive -  Very rich - serve with ice cream or whipped cream - VERY RICH   I have made about 8-10 times and have never been disappointed

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving and other holidays for the past 5+ years.  My husband and I love it and I always get compliments.  It kind of comes out like a brownie with a hint of fudge when it's chilled.  Delicious and easy!

Very rich and tasty. I followed the instructions to the letter and ended up with basically a chocolate brownie with pecans in a pie crust. Not that I'm complaining. It was very good, just not quite what I expected.

Amazing, it is delicious warm with ice cream, or cold out of the fridge.  I made no changes to this recipe.  It's fantastic!

This was the first time trying to make a pecan pie and it was so easy. This pie is wonderful, not too mushy. Everyone loved it!!!

This pie tastes exactly like the Famous $20 pie in a Houston Texas bakery,  although they do add a Rum kicker,  I chose not to so I could get the chocolate flavor and Wow! Thank you earthymom.

I made this, albeit the lazy way. I didn’t mix the ingredients in a saucepan to melt, I just mixed them all in a bowl and poured in a pre made pie crust. I baked it as the instructions stated and it came out great. It received rave reviews. I’m sure the melting of the chocolate would have given it a more even chocolate taste, but I found myself at a point where I was not interested in another pan to wash.

I made this tonight for Thanksgiving. It was very rich and gooey. The top looked done but the inside was still gooey chocolate. Was this supposed to bake until it was like a brownie? I baked it for 45 mins at 350. I did not prebake the crust.

This pie was so easy to prepare and turned out great! It doesn't have the gooey, jelly consistency like most pecan pies but that's what I liked most about it. The chocolate is rich and delicious. I made two for Christmas Eve for my family to enjoy. Great recipe!

I would say this is more of a brownie in a crust than a pie. I was hoping for something more gooey, like a regular pecan pie. It was kind of dry. However, as long as you like chocolate, this recipe should satisfy!

Always my best pie.  It makes more filling than a regular pie crust can hold.  Use a deep dish (store bought).  I made a homemade crust in my very deep pie crust pan.  I made a recipe and a half and it still looked low on filling.  Although, the pie turned out great.  My oven runs a tad hot.  25 minutes was all it needed.  Toast the pecans first...even better.

So chocolate!! So good, very rich pie.  Love the texture of it and the great chocolate taste!  I would definitely make again, easy and delicious.  I have made this many many times now and given it away to friends everyone loves it!  I melt chips & butter in micro, might try butterscotch chips and see how that is!!  Great with cool whip on top, very rich!
