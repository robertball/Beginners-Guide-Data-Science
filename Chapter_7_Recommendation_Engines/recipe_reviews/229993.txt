I used all butter and sauteed a little fresh minced garlic in the butter before adding all the rest of the ingredients. To add a little more flavor, I added a good amount of parmesan cheese and a little red pepper flake to the sauce before tossing it with hot fettucini. Not bad, it tastes a lot like the flavored boxed pasta my Mom made me as a kid. The kids INHALED IT.

I tried this sauce exactly as the recipe called for it. However it turned out to be completely flavorless. Literally, its just watered down flour and butter. I had to add garlic salt, pepper, and cooking salt just to make it taste good enough to have a bowl.  I would never recommend it to anyone, especially since adding a bunch of spices still wasn't enough to make it taste good. I'm never making this sauce again.

What an easy recipe and so delicious! The bouillion cube makes all the difference! I cut up slivers of chorizo, fried it, and then added it to the sauce. My husband loved it!

I started to make tuna casserole and realized I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup.  I made this white sauce, added a little garlic and some black pepper, mixed in the tuna and egg noodles and it was great!  I'll never use mushroom soup again!

I fixed this for my girlfriend and I. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and replaced the white pepper with black pepper. Served it with spaghetti and half lb. shrimp. My girlfriend said "this is restaurant quality, excellent." She also said she wished she could cook like that. Thank you All recipes.com,  I love you guys.

Just made this for lunch for my 7 kids. The kids loved it! I made them chocolate pudding with gummy worms for desert (aka dirt and worms) The 3 year olds are asking for seconds on their pasta instead of eating desert!

I found this recipe while searching for a simple alternative to rice or potatoes.  So glad I did!  I made it according to directions, adding some browned ground venison to the sauce.  Mixed with pasta, a veggie side and home made rolls, it was a hit! My husband and kids (4, 6, 8) kept telling me how good it was! I sprinkled shredded cheese on mine, but it was good without, too. Will definitely make again!

The white pepper is a crucial flavor in this sauce recipe.  It is a good basic white sauce that covers pasta nicely and I liked that it had no heavy cream.  I used all butter as other reviewers did.  You can add garlic with the roux and Parmesan cheese to make it taste more like Alfredo sauce.

I tried this recipe today and am quite pleased by it. It's not the tastiest or most flavoursome sauce in the world but just add cheese or something. While making the sauce though i got very worried as it started to look like profiterole mix, but i added everything quickly afterwords and it worked well. :)

I substituted 1% milk instead of whole because it is what my family is accustomed to using.  I also added cayenne pepper, minced garlic, and onion to taste. The sauce was perfect for my pasta and diced chicken dish.  Thank you so much!

I am giving this recipe 3 stars. Yes it was easy to make however, making it per the recipe given was a little bland. Its definitely good as a start to a white sauce but adding more flavor will give it taste.

After reading the reviews I decided to add some garlic and parmesan cheese and I still found this a tad bland. Not bad, but I like my white sauce a little more flavorful. Next time I will add additional garlic and maybe another bullion cube.

This is so yummy.  I cooked a half a box of spiral pasta and 1.75lbs of diced chicken and mixed it with this sauce.  I did sprinkle in some parmesan . I used skim milk, so I used a little more and less water I also used lots of garlic and onion powder. Yummy.

Super easy and wide open for easy alterations! Thanks for the recipe. Originally used over pasta. Made this again and used it over shells in the oven and it worked great!

This was a great base recipe!  I made it as directed and then added Basil, Season Salt, Crushed Red Pepper and Black Pepper to spice it up a bit.  This is a great sauce that can be modified for multiple dishes.  I served this with shrimp and pasta and will use it again for chicken.

I used 4 tbsp of butter, skipped the margarine, added 1 tbsp of minced garlic and some crushed red pepper.  I like using the pasta water in my sauces which I think helps with the thickness.  I didn't have white pepper so I used a generous amount of black pepper.  Topped it off with Italian parsley.  It was perfect!

The sauce turned out great. I used 1/2c less water and used the pasta water instead of regular. I also added about a tsp or less of minced garlic to the butter, red pepper flake to taste and a fair amount of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor as suggested by someone else. Would make this again for sure.

Giving this recipe 3 stars because it needs work in terms of flavour. The consistency and degree of thickness for a white sauce is great! It's just a bit on the bland tasting side. I added some Parmesan cheese and additional salt and pepper. Definitely a great beginning recipe!

The basic recipe was good but I added extra milk, less water and used half butter and half olive oil.  I also  added about 4 cloves of garlic to the butter mixture and topped with fresh grated parm.

I made some changes others made...added fresh Parmesan (too much...awesome!).  I used whole milk, and sauteed garlic in the butter.  Added some leftover turkey breast and then spooned it on angel hair.  Kids devoured it.

It's a white sauce so unless you flavor it, it'll be bland. That being said, I added white pepper, parm, pink salt, and basil and used all Amish butter no margerine. Perfect! Add it over spaghetti pasta and it was a hit.

Very good, added garlic, Parmesan cheese and a little basil to color it up a bit. I made a few dishes using this, with Fettuccine and (pronto) Penne, cooked in the oven.  Will use this recipe again, thank you

Just used this recipe. Had to substitute butter for margarine and only had whole milk. 
I added garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce for taste. Put it over some pasta, red, yellow and orange peppers and shrimp. Very delicious!!

I made this last night and it was fantastic! My Husband loved it! I added 2 tablespoon of minced garlic and garlic salt and parsley to taste. I doubled the recipe but only put 2 tablespoon of garlic. Although it did take an hour to an hour and a half for the sauce to thicken to what I wanted it to be. Other than that, it was great!

This is a keeper for sure!  I changed it up just a little by adding roasted garlic, and exchanging 1 cup of unsalted chicken stock for 1 cup of water and eliminating the bouillon.  If I would have had white wine I would have used that in place of the other 1/2 cup of water...definitely next time.  We cooked chicken, mushrooms, frozen pearl onions peas and asparagus and added that, as well as some freshly grated parmesan cheese along with some gouda.  This was absolutely yummy and a great Sunday family meal!!!

It was very flavorless to me, even after adding one tablespoon parmesan. Next time, I will sauté minced fresh garlic in the butter, and add salt, more pepper and parmesan. This was a rushed first attempt on my part.

Only used butter and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  Also, used boiling pasta water instead of plain boiling water.  Very creamy and delicious!  Both the Hubby and the kids loved it!

This is a good starter I would say. I have used this recipe many times and always change the flavor. Instead of using regular butter I've used some homemade garlic and herb butter also add different kinds of proteins (i.e. Shrimp, chicken, sausage.) also different kinds of noodles.

this recipe is so simple and good you don't have to do anything to it, but if you want to experiment with it you can. I put garlic and cheese in it and it was awesome. For sure I will use it again thank you.

I made this with beef bullion instead of chicken, and it was very bland, so I added lots of salt and garlic and it tastes really good!

I'm a newbie in the kitchen and this was so easy and tasty! I also put in some garlic and red pepper flakes in the butter and at the end put in some shrimp! I served it with steamed broccoli and it was a hit! Def making this again thank you :))

Quick and easy recipe, a good base.  The bullion cube adds a unique flavor but I wanted a little more so I added a clove of garlic, pinch of salt, little basil, used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and black instead of white pepper and poured it over bow tie pasta.  My pickiest eater who never asks for seconds on any kind of pasta loved it and had seconds.  I added raw diced yellow bell pepper to my individual serving and thought it added a nice flavor.  So many possibilities with this recipe.

Very good recipe for a simple white that my kids love. I add a few table spoons of parm ar the end - fresh or Kraft. Great for a quick meal after work. Add chicken, mushrooms,  broccoli... whatever is in your pantry.

I did not care for this recipe. So bland--but the consistency is pretty good.

The sauce tastes very good. I was pleasantly surprised, since it really has very little ingredients in the preparation. I'm a vegetarian, and I switched the chicken bouillon with a vegetable one. I also added 2 tsp of "Parma Rosa" sauce mix from Knorr together with the bouillon. It gave the sauce a richer taste. At the end I added 1/8 tsp dried basil leaves with the pepper. 
I will make it again, for sure.

All three kiddos loved this, that is highly unusual!  Next go-round I will try with two bouillon cubes (chicken with herbs has a nice touch) for just a bit more flavor.  I also added frozen peas to the boiling pasta about halfway through cooking.

I substituted truffle oil for margarine...made no other changes to this recipe, and the texture and flavour was *fantastic*!  Kiddo gave me extra kudos...but then she thinks everything I make is great (even though Im not the best cook) lol

Followed recipe closely and couldn't really taste the sauce at all. At least the prep was easy...
