I am not sure why i found this dish a little lack lustre, it could have been my choice of taco seasoning (low salt variety, yuck) and the tortillas that i stirred in were soggy and everyone fished them out.  It was quick and simple to throw together so I would definitely try it again and serve it with tortilla chips for scooping!

Easy Peasy! Big flavours. I used homemade taco seasoning from this site. I found it a bit watery so I left the lid off and let it simmer for an additional 10 minutes. After reading some of the other reviews I decided to broil for a few minutes to crisp up the tortilla pieces. The cheese was bubbling and golden. There was a bit of an unfortunate accident with my green onions-they landed on the floor. I imagine they would have tasted great in the dish!  I used fresh cilantro and avocado as toppers. Pretty yummy meal. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/46653/taco-seasoning-i/

This recipe was a surprise hit. I was worried that the mixture was a little runny but this turned out to be good as the tortillas soaked up the liquid giving them a noodle like consistency. The only thing I changed was using my homemade taco seasoning.

I’ve been making this for some time (back when it was on ifood.com - krafts site). Instead of using ground meat, I always use ground turkey and sprinkle with a little cumin. Then I follow the recipe till once it’s done and broil for a couple minutes. Also, I like adding avocado/guacamole and cilantro to it.

I didn't have salsa, so I just put in 8 ounces of tomato sauce, but followed the rest of the recipe.  My husband thought this was the best meal he ever had.  My son gobbled it down and he is one picky eater.  I've been asked to make this not just again, but a LOT!  KEEPER!

Kinda basic, but added mixed corn, sriracha, and put on top of tortilla chips for more of a taco salad feel.  Works great as a quick and easy dinner that requires little prep!

Used tortilla chips instead of flour tortillas and added some diced onion to the hamburger mixture. Served with lettuce, olives and a little jalapeno for myself.  Super easy, super fast and my family loved it!

This is good. After reading other reviews, I was worried about soggy bits of flour tortilla so I also crisped them in the oven before adding to the skillet. I don't know if that helped because they ended up not retaining any crispiness, but it didn't matter because we didn't mind the soft tortilla bits at all. I was also worried that the mixture looked a bit soupy, but that was a non-issue after the tortillas were added because they soaked up any extra liquid. Corey says 4.5 stars!

I feel like this recipe would have been much better with tortillas chips rather than tortillas.

This was a pretty decent little meal. It was incredibly quick and easy to make, and surprisingly tasty! I made a couple of adjustments, though nothing major: For one, I used full fat/full sodium everything. As a rule, I don't cook with "low fat" ingredients. I also did not have soft tortillas on hand, so used multigrain tortilla CHIPS instead.  The result was a yummy meal, that took all of 15-20 minutes to cook. It's certainly not fancy, and I am not sure that I would serve it with company over.. but it's perfect for those nights that you just don't want to spend 2 hours in the kitchen. Also, I suspect that this would be a huge hit with kids.

Enjoyed the flavours but not the soft tortillas.  Maybe keeping the lid off might keep them a little crisper, as I did crisp them in the oven.   #EndWithAmazing #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA

Super simple and tasty! I added black beans and 2 cloves of minced garlic, because I cannot help myself. Also used an entire pound of beef as that's what I had and didn't want to save the little bit. 
I really enjoy how this is completely customizable topping wise. So everyone in the family can make theirs to their liking. You could serve it over salad or baked sweet potato fries like I did. 
My only suggestion is either toasting the tortillas under a broiler for a bit first or skipping that step all together and use them to roll up the filling. They were very mushy.. Had to be picked out.
Will make again for next taco night! 
Ooo and can't go wrong with adding more cheese.

My family liked this. It was super-fast and easy to make. The only thing I would change is the tortilla pieces on top. Might have been better to have it on the side or broiled for crispiness. I served with extra tomatoes and avocadoes on the side, as suggested in the recipe notes.

This was delicious, very tasty recipe indeed. We added chopped heirloom tomatoes, lettuce and green onion and the cool sour cream was a very nice addition. I wasn't sure about adding soft tortilla pieces to the mix the way the recipe instructed, and I was right... they became pasty mush bits. I like how the other reviewers did it: crispy :)  This is a great share dinner.

Big hit with the family, fast and easy to make as well! I used 1 lb of extra lean ground beef because that is what I had, homemade salt free taco seasoning and 3 large whole wheat tortillas that I crisped up in the oven before cutting up to add to the burrito skillet, I also used regular cheese not light as I am not a fan. We added taco toppings like shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and fat free sour cream. Next time I will try it with black beans instead of the kidney beans. Great weeknight dinner! #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

This dish was quick, easy and inexpensive. I enjoyed the fact that my family could choose various toppings. We chose avocado, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, sautéed onions/peppers, salsa, sour cream and corn chips.
