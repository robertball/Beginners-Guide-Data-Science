This recipe is amazing. The smell of it cooking is to die for. I followed the recipe pretty close, but I didn't have 14 cloves of garlic so I used what I had which was about 10. I melted the margine in a saucepan over the stove with the garlic, then I added the lemon juice. Next time I would omit the second amount of salt, I don't think it needs it as it is very flavourful with just the garlic. You don't need 1/4 cup of olive oil, I used just enough to coat each breast. Definitely will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written, EXCEPT for three additional spices added: Italian, oregano, and basil. This made a nice, full 13x9 inch pan dinner, and my son and husband loved it. My husband ate two big pieces of chicken and has dished up the leftovers for work tomorrow, but he couldn't stop picking at the leftovers as he was dishing it up. He deemed this as possibly his new favorite meal, so thank you very much for posting this recipe. I will be adding this to our monthly menu for sure. I didn't think any of the flavors were too overpowering, but we are all big cheese and garlic lovers, so I can see where someone who wasn't so keen on the Parmesan and garlic flavors would probably want to cut back.

This was so good I will be making this again. Easy flavorful and the aroma as it cooks is out of this world. I have never had chicken breast turn out so tender and juicy before.

Just finished dinner and this recipe made it perfect. AWESOME! My husband loved it.  I didn't use margarine, I used butter.  That was the only change and hubby wants to have it again and don't change anything.  Thanks

Made this recipe the other day for my husband.  He loved it!! Only made a few changes. I did not have italian bread crumbs so i used regular bread crumbs and added a teaspoon of italian seasoning.  Also I only added a half a teaspoon of salt to the bread crumb mixture if your sensitive to salt I would omit it all together.

I think maybe it had too much lemon juice in it, and I also found it to be really greasey.  I did notice it was salty, even without the addition of extra salt.  Sorry, it sounded fantastic, but it just didn't turn out as I'd expected.

Made this recipe last night and it was AWESOME! Only alternations I made was to leave out the salt for the bread crumb mixture and substituted butter for margarine. Even my partner said "can't wait until we make it again!" Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I omitted the salt from the parmesan/crumb mixture, and this dish was still WAY TOO SALTY.  I will make this again because I think there is potential, but will not marinate the chicken in a brine solution.  An Italian dressing marinade may work nicely.
