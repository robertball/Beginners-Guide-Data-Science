This is the first cold oatmeal that I have really liked! I used whole roasted almonds that I chopped. I didn't have blueberry jam, so I used seedless black raspberry jam and added some frozen blueberries. I liked the different textures from all the ingredients, and I really liked the almond extract. The only thing I had to do was add a little water in the morning to get the consistency I wanted. Thanks for this recipe!

I enjoyed these and thought they were different from my usual overnight oats. The jam sweetened enough and the almond extract gave the oats a nice flavor. It was enough for two meals for me since I'm not a heavy breakfast eater.
