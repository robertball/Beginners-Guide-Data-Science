I use the juice from a can of crushed pineapple then I add some of the crushed pineapple.  This makes a wonderful textured frosting that EVERYONE will love!  I've used this recipe for years but this is the first time seeing it on Allrecipes.

I made a 13 x 9 cake & knew as written it would be too much frosting, so  halved it. it came out nicely, a bit thicker than a glaze, but not one that could be swirled either. Which was fine w/me.   The only change I did was add a few drops of lemon extract to "brighten" the flavor. I used it on a carrot cake, to which I had added crushed pineapple. Very tasty together.

I added the lemon extract, Candy Lady, thanks for adding that to the reviews (I was going to do that anyway, lol).  I frosted the top of a lemon pound cake and it was awesome.  I like the consistency of this frosting, it doesn't run yet it is firm enough for spreading.  I will definitely use this again with and without the pineapple juice.  In my opinion it's the right amount of each ingredient, for what I was looking for of course.  Thanks Candy Lady, after searching hours for a frosting I finally found something right for me.

For every pineapple lover out there.....this is THE recipe.  However, I did only add 2 C. powdered sugar along with 1/2 a can crushed pineapple (drained) and about 2-3 TBS. of the juice.   This is THE BEST EVER and I could have gotten a spoon and just pigged out!  Even better?  Coconut all over the cake....TRULY tropical.  THANKS for this simple yet so, so yummy recipe.  **by the way mine went on a smaller baked yellow cake with pineapple juice substituted for the water called for**

Pretty good but very runny.  The pineapple is subtle in this recipe.  I would use it as a glaze (maybe a Jamaica Cake?) but definitely would not try to frost cupcakes with it again.

This couldn't be simpler. I even screwed up and added the pineapple juice last (rushing) and it still turned out great. I did NOT add lemon extract as suggested in the reviews. The pineapple flavor came through nicely without it. I halved the recipe and used this on Zucchini Cake II by Joan.  Thanks for a simply delicious recipe!

This icing was so easy and quick to make. I didn't need the entire recipe as I just wanted to more or less drizzle on the Bundt cake. So I halved the recipe but added the entire 8 oz of Cream Cheese. I wanted a cream cheesy taste and I also added 4 TBLSP of Lemon Juice to cut back on the sweetness as I didn't have Lemon Extract on hand. It was the right consistency for drizzling, not too thin and not too thick and after I drizzled it on the cake, I added some crushed pineapple to give it some color. The flavor was just wonderful, not too sweet and not too pineappley.By the way, the cake itself, was Carrot Cake IV submitted by Cookie and the cake was superb also. I will use this frosting again.l

I love this idea, I have used freeze dried fruit to flavor frostings with as well, it would add a lot more flavor than juice, and not thin the frosting as much...freeze dried strawberries is my fav.

I made this to top Sam's Famous carrot cake which had pineapple in it.  The frosting had the perfect amount of sweetness and a subtle cream cheese flavor.  I really liked the pineapple kick.  Just wish it was even more pineapple-y!

Nice icing, very soft and spreadable...be careful!! Will spread more then expected if you don't watch it. I used this recipe to top lemon lime cupcakes. made a nice touch. Now will make this on some other cakes too.

I reduced the pineapple juice by about a tablespoon and added some pineapple puree. I made pineapple cupcakes with this frosting and a marichino cherry on top. It gave it a very "classic cupcake" look and tasted delicious. I made 24 of them and they were gone a day later. My family and friends gave so many compliments! Thanks for the recipe! I will be using it again! :)

Excellent!!  Didn't have lemon extract, so I used lemon juice instead, and it seems fine.  Makes a LOT of frosting, more than enough for a 9in layer cake.

Cream cheese soup. My hummingbird cake literally collapsed. Save your time and your money. Honestly I cannot understand the rating system – as someone earlier said this is only a glaze not a frosting. Do not waste your time or your resources!

I made to frost a pineapple cake and this was very good. I didn't want extra pineapple flavoring so I only used butter, cream cheese and a touch of vanilla extract  and it was perfect.

Pineapple was a great idea BUT I halved the butter and cheese, doubled the juice and kept adding sugar and beat/whipping the mixture in an electric mixer until I had a good consistency for a cake. Still tasted nicely of pineapple and was lighter than most cream cheese frostings. Used it on a  pineapple carrot cake and it was perfect. Think I will try it with other juices and matching cakes such as apple in the fall.
Given how much I changed, it hardly seems fair to review but the pineapple is such a great idea, maybe a high review will get others to try the idea.
