I have made this cake several times and everytime it's a hit.  It's very moist and yummy.  I do substitute a few ingredients.  I use 1 tsp. of allspice and 1 tsp. cinnomon.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I add raisins because to me carrot cake isn't carrot cake without them.  As for lining the pan with paper towels...I didn't.  I just prepared my pan with oil & flour and baked as directed.  I baked it a bit slower than the directions assuring even cooking.  I make this a two layer cake and doubled the frosting recipe to have enough to cover both layers.  I sprinkled chopped pecans over for garnish.  It taste great and makes a great presentation.

The BEST carrot cake so far. Walnuts are not very popular in our house so I substituted raisins and it worked just as good. Thankyou.

Best carrot cake. We used canned carrot. I supervisor a school cafeteria and this was an excellant way to use some of our government commodities.  We fixed it for Christmas and are having it for Easter dinner.

Moist Cake! I made mine with 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger for a little more flavor. I also used 3 cups of shredded carrots rather that the cooked. Next time I make it I will pour it onto a parchment paper. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.....!!  I'm not sure what could have gone wrong for the person it didn't work out for, but it always comes out great for me!!  Instead of using just cinnamon, I use cardamom, as it adds a special sweet spiciness to it....then I cheat and make things simple by just using a commericla cream cheese frosting - which is always a hit.....a super way to make use of the leftover carrots from dinner or just using up the carrots that are left in your garden!!

Haven't cooked it yet because the picture shows a layer cake, the baking instructions show a sheet cake.  Which is it?  I prefer the layer cake but  I would have to double the frosting I think????  The recipe sounds delicious.

I agree with Austrilian carrots... this was rubber cake. I  thought maybe it was that I used fresh pineapple. It was good frosting....

YUM!  Definitely a keeper!  I used applesauce in place of half the oil and whole wheat flour in place of half the white.  So good and moist.  I just sprayed the pan with Pam since I was serving it out of the pan.

Made this with my daughter and it was great. The only thing we did different was after greasing the pans we coated the pans with sugar. It was a hit!

I made this last night as cupcakes. The recipe makes about 4 dozen cupcakes (plus a dozen mini cupcakes). I omitted the coconut and used my own cream cheese frosting recipe. They came out of the oven so light and fluffy. The texture was moist and light. These really are better after a night of refrigeration though. Thanks for the recipe! Will use again.

I made this cake for a coworker for her birthday and I got lots of compliments on it.  It was very moist and the coconut was a welcome addition.  The birthday girl said it may have been the best carrot cake she has ever had.  Will def make again!

I made this cake for the first time for Thanksgiving it came out very moist and tasty but just a little heavy for me.  Made it again for Christmas without the Walnuts and less pineapples and coconuts and it was excellent thank you.

Very moist, heavy and dense cake.  Best kept refridgerated.  I really loved it and so did all my guests.   I used parchment paper not a towel lined pan.  I made as a layer cake like the picture, but next time, due to the weight, I will make in a one layer pan that you could cut squares.  Also if you do make the layer cake, I found that the frosting recipe wasn't enought to cover the cake with filling, so I would double it.

I bake a Carrot Cake every year for my sister-in-law.  I used this one last year and she absolutely loved it.  I was very moist and with the Cream Cheese frosting it was perfect.  She only left us 2 slices and took the reast home with her.

Easy to make, since the carrots are cooked.  Skipped the nuts when we made it for Cammie.  Would use different frosting recipe - from the pumpkin bread recipe - more cream cheesy.

Everyone loved the flavour and texture. I found that it needed to cook longer than the reccomended time. As with other bakers I added extra spices. Put some of the mix into large muffin tins lined with the paper cups hubby loved his "Giant Carrot Cupcakes"

This was supposed to be my husband's birthday cake.  He had to work on his birthday, the day before Easter.  So I made this for both Easter and his birthday.  Since it was indicated that it is better the day after it is made I made it on his birthday and saved it to eat after our Easter dinner.  Good thing I didn't have company!  It didn't cook all the way through and I tested it in 5 places with a toothpick!  Going back to my old recipes where you use raw carrots.  I should've been clued in when I took it out of the oven it looked perfect and when I turned away for a few minutes it fell, about 3/4", so I had to use extra frosting to fill in the well.

Loved this cake recipe.... I made it without the raisins and the cream cheese because i dislike those two things.  As icing i used butter cream frosting and it came out good

Great use for canned carrots!!  I had a giant can of carrots I needed to use up, and this was delicious.  I warmed 3 cups of sliced canned carrots in the microwave and mashed them with a potato masher, which came out to two cups mashed.  I poured the batter into a muffin pan coated with Baker's Joy cooking spray to make cupcakes, and I used pre-made cream cheese frosting.  Otherwise, I did everything else exactly the same as the recipe directions.  The cupcakes came out super moist and delicious, and I had no trouble with sticking to the pan.  I'm so pleased with this recipe, and I definitely will be making it again.

I have made this cake many times now.  The only thing I change is about 1/3 to 1/2 of the carrots I cook per the recipe and the balance I leave raw.  It makes for the same moist cake, but with a classic flare.  This cake is amazing!

I made this carrot cake and it was so good. But in the recipe where it says "put cake onto a plate and THEN cool",, DON'T !!!!! Let the cake cool completely before flipping onto a plate. My cake crumbled all over and made a big mess.

This recipe made a wonderfully moist and fluffy cake.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake he had ever had.  The frosting was a little too sweet though.  When I make it again, I will probably tweak the recipe to make it not so sugary.

I made this cake with leftover glazed carrots. It was fantastic!
