Too Cute! I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and peanut butter and apples to me go together well....like peanut butter and jelly! My niece went crazy for this! It's an easy, quick, inexpensive, healthy and delicious snack that I felt good about giving her. Plus it was really fun to make! I think you could even substitute chocolate chips for the ladybug spots and eyes because we all know how good chocolate and peanut butter taste!

I spread cut side of apple with peanut butter(to prevent browning) and serve on a lettuce leaf which keeps PB off fingers. This would be a great after-school treat or a cute side "salad" for a meal. A platter of these each on it's own lettuce leaf would be a nice center-piece for a kids party.

My kids had fun making these today. TIP: I soaked my halved apples in a combination of lemon juice and water. Kept them from browning.

I included Cheerios, and Marshmellows, to decorate with.  I also used strawberry cream cheese for those not able to have peanut butter.  The summer park program (ages 3-12) loved these.

Very cute recipe that I put into my roommates' bento lunches. The only downside to this is that you can't refrigerate them. The pretzels get soggy form the apples and break, also the apples brown. Eat them the same day and they are fine however.

I made this recipe, and I think where you scooped out the core you can fill it in with peanut butter. Also if you don't have petzels colored tooth picks are always fun, they are not edible but they work, and instead of raisins I used chocolate chips, which we're very good.

Great idea!  I made mine with dried cranberries and raisin and with strawberry cream cheese instead of peanut butter for allergy reason and paired it with Ants on a Log and the kids loved it!

Very cute recipe.  I used natural peanut butter, which at room temperature can be a bit runny.  So refrigerating the peanut butter might be a good idea.  I also had a hard time getting the pretzels in the apples without breaking them.  So I used a a chop stick to "pre-poke" the hole and that seemed to work well.

Yummy!!  I used a little lemon juice on the cut side of apple so it didn't get brown.  used cream cheese instead of peanut butter!  Was a very cute HIT with the kiddos.  I liked the idea of scooping out the core so they could eat the whole thing!

This snack was just perfect for all 4 of my children - ages 5 to 16!  They loved the fact they were ladybugs and the peanut butter, raisins and apple flavors together were fantastic.  My youngest wants to use these for their next birthday party and have a ladybug decorating contest - thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

My 5 & 4 year old boys enjoyed making them.  I used a long two pronged fork to make the holes for the antennas.  It was perfect bc they were the right distance apart and even level.  The boys liked filling the belly with peanut butter as well!  My only down fall was trying to use a different type of pretzel for the antenna (not a good idea) you just need to get sticks!  I will admit both of my boys love apples, so i wasnt worried about the apples going to waste...but my 4 year old refuses to eat the peal!  For the record...he has eaten one full half and one almost done with the second one as I type.  Thanks for the fun afternoon snack idea!

Fun snack kids can make almost entirely by themselves. (After an adult cuts and cores the apples.)
