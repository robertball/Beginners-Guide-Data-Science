Not sure why this got such low ratings. I really liked it though I made it with some minor variations - like no feta cheese about twice the (adult) spinach and Danon's strawberry yogurt instead of whatever the recipe called for. It was very tasty and my wife liked it enough she suggested it would be good as a main course when you just want a light dinner. It will become a staple here for things like picnic lunches and dinner sides.

This was really good! I only rated it 4 stars because the texture of pasta with everything else was...different. I had used whole wheat pasta which tends to stay pretty firm. I will try with regular pasta next time to see if that helps.

Only thing different I did was not add the onion. My little girl asked for strawberry pasta for dinner and I found this recipe..gotta say it looks like such an oddball mixture of stuff but it all comes together really nicely. The toddlers ate it up and I did too.

I followed the recipe exactly. Everything was fresh and tasted good and looked so nice. Here's the wrong part; it says right in the directions that it can be made ahead of time. I made it on a Saturday evening to serve the next day. Big mistake! It was mushy and not pretty. Had to be thrown out. So disappointing. Do not make ahead of time especially if you put it together.
