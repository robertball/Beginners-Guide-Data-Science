I will definitely make these again.  I did make one substitution.  The substitution was to substitute two medium-sized avocados for the two eggs as the binder. I increased my heart healthy nutrition this way.  If protein is your concern, only substitute one egg.

also, I plan to add in a little jalapeno or chipotle pepper next time and cream cheese for the mayo.
