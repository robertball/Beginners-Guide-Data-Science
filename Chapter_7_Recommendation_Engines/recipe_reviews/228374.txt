I cooked these for at least 45 min with additional broth, and they still seemed too firm to me.  I'm thinking that next time I should let the lentils soak in water overnight, perhaps.  The flavor was really good, and I used a tarragon vinegar that I had on hand.  I don't get much flavor our of parsley, so I think I will try cilantro next time as well.

I love to make a big batch of these to eat both hot and cold during the week. They are really great to bulk up a salad, or make a nice side dish at dinner. They also freeze really well, so I put them in 1-cup portions in freezer bags.

This is quite delicious. The method works fine for brown or green lentils as well. Thanks for the recipe.

WOW! I like lentils but I now LOVE black beluga lentils! Thanks Chef John! This is absolutely delicious! I agree with Diane M. You have to try this recipe to fall in love with this lentil dish. I have now made it at least 4 times exactly to directions changing out the chicken stock for vege stock only...(I am a vegetarian.)It is not a hard recipe and comes out a winner every time! Even people who are not big lentil fans love it! Black lentils are nothing like other lentils and they hold their texture and absorb the flavor. I have served it with tofu steaks and a salad, or with brown rice and a vegetable. Great as left overs!

I was wandering the Organic section at the grocery store today looking for something healthy and came across Black Caviar Lentils. They looked interesting so I thought I'd try them. I got home and found this recipe for them. Who knew lentils could be tasty? I usually don't like lentils, but this recipe is good. I didn't use the butter (trying to make it healthier) and did not have fresh thyme. I used a palm-full of dried thyme instead. I also added a bit more bouillon for flavor because I did not have the Champagne vinegar. Will be adding this recipe to my recipe box. Thanks Chef John!

I saw the 5* reviews and watched the video. I wasn't expecting anything special; but BOY was I wrong. I served it as a main with a side of roast pumpkin and this actually turned a fantastic dish into a superb one. I followed the recipe exactly (except I omitted the butter for a vegan version) and I replaced the parsley at the end with oregano and basil, as I had those fresh on hand. The thyme worked superbly during the cooking phase and the vinegar is a most. I chose apple cider vinegar this time.  Next time I am trying this is a base for a "Vegan Shepard's Pie" as I think this would work superbly for that. So pleased I found this wonderful dish.

I used plain old lentils and this still turned out delicious. I also omitted the champagne vinegar and used white wine vinegar in its place as it was all I had. I highly recommend this recipe!

So delicious! I found that it was delicious even without the vinegar and parsley. I really enjoyed the video tutorial as well :) This will be on my menu rotation from now on.

This is our favourite way to eat black lentils. The only changes we make is that we usually add some wine at the end of sautéing the veggies and deglaze the pan, and we use wine vinegar or even apple cider vinegar at the end because that's what we have. This recipe is even great cold in my lunch the next day.

I have never heard of beluga lentils before and actually had to order them off Amazon.  Boy am I glad I did! I am vegan so I made the obvious substitutes. Before this, I never really cared much for lentils, but now I’m hooked. I substituted rice vinegar for champagne vinegar because that is what I had on hand. This recipe is a keeper!

It was delicious and easy meal. 
As suggested in the reviews I did soak the lentils in water for 5-6 hours. The cooking time was very less that way. Just has to keep lentils like..10-15 minutes only. 
I did add lemon to it as well, gave it nice flavour. 
I would surely recommend making it :)

My local grocery did not have black lentils so I decided to proceed with red lentils. Flavor was good. A little thick after time so I kept adding a little water. And I added a little garlic and red pepper to my taste. Overall very good. Thx for recipe.

After I already started the veg and had the lentils in the pan, I realized I only had beef stock, so I used that instead.  This dish took about 50 minutes and 24 oz of stock to finish it cooking.  In spite of that, this was a dish my family enjoyed.  In the future I might try adding some shredded chicken and making it a one dish meal.  Either way, will make again, without a doubt.

I made this dish countless times and it's my absolute favourite lentils meal....
I do it in a pressure cooker. It cuts prep time in half...
Sometimes I add a touch of chopped leak as well. The most important element for flavour here is thyme!
There is no need for soaking just simmer it longer! Add liquid if necessary.. I add organic broth..

Started out with bacon (because everything is better with bacon), and sauteed the veg. in the bacon fat. Then braised the lentils until tender in veggie stock. Very delicious, will def. make again. And my son (age 12) just LOVED them!

Chef John, you've nailed it again, and talked me into buying black lentils online, since our local Co-op didn't carry them.  This was fantastic.  I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have champagne vinegar.  (I have never even seen that.)  It was fantastic.  I also added minced garlic.  I couldn't help it.  Home run!!!

Fantastic!  You just have to make it to understand how good it is.  (Watch the video first - it's not necessary, but it's a nice addition.)

Delicious, as written. I used vegetable stock and white wine vinegar (didn't have champagne vinegar on hand). Paired it with celery root puree and seared scallops for an elegant and earthy entree.

How can something this simple be so delicious? This is why I love Chef John’s recipes. I served it over white rice and mixed in leftover fajita chicken thigh cubes. Perfect lunch. Highly recommend.

This is the first time I cooked with lentils, now I am a fan!  Doubled the recipe so I had extra.  Added chicken broth to the extras the next day to make lentil soup, also delicious.

I think these turned out well with a generous amount of salt -- garlic salt, onion salt, nature's seasoning, cajun seasoning... all worked well in this.  Next time I wonder if a little bit of chopped up bacon wouldn't also go well with it...
I didn't have the champagne vinegar so I tried with rice vingear and a little lemon juice (I couldn't decide) -- it didn't seem to significantly change the flavor too much.
I also had to cook extra time to make the beans a little softer, but to each their own.

A good lentil recipe.  I used puy lentils.  It took  45 minutes or longer to get the lentils tender.  Otherwise, the recipe works well as written.

I loved it, even though it took at least an hour for the lentils to soak up the liquid.  I also forgot to buy celery (which I love), and had to use vegetable broth for my vegetarian child.  I think with celery and chicken broth it would be outstanding.

This was very good and a nice side dish because it's hearty but healthy. Only had brown lentils and it was still great.

I just made this with white vinegar instead of Champagne and it is delicious! I used french lentils and they worked great.

Never cooked beluga lentils before but had tasted it at a restaurant. This recipe was easy to follow and the lentils tasted GREAT!
