My dogs gobble these down in a matter of days.  The only change I would suggest is to use "sodium free" beef flavoring, as dogs cannot process salt.  I cut down to one cube, and the dogs still gobbled them up.  Suggest to go to salt free broth instead of the flavor cubes to be on the safe side.

I can't tell you how happy I am to find a good treat for my 5 dogs they alwalys beg for seconds. I added some jerky bits and they loved them I gave them to friends and had 100% approval even with people who said there dogs were picky. For my dogs on my 3rd double batch I rolled them out and cut them with a pizza cutter into strips then I can break them into little pieces for rewards or give them a big piece. I also just cut some in 1 1/2in squares, and used my mini icecream scoop rolled some in balls with my meat tenderizer I made a pattern which made them look cute. Any dog would be thrilled to get these I even had friends cats eating them. I have made these so many times the easiest way I have found yet is to spray a 9x13  oan and press dough to the edge cut in 1x2 in squares and bake as directed and you have bar cookies my dogs like them chewy so this works out fast and easy.

I can't say I loved them but My doggy sure did!  I let them stay in the oven after I turned them off though because they were still somewhat "soft"  they harden up well over night. 

Added handfull of chopped parsley and a jar of babyfood BEEF and babyfood carrots. --for nutrition.

As a last-ditch effort to win favor with my friend's dog Sally, the pickiest poodle in the entire world, I made this recipe. I added about 1/3 cup peanut butter and only used 1 bouillon cube. I did have to add extra water in order to keep the dough together. Sally came over to investigate halfway through the process and didn't leave my side for the next hour. Needless to say, I have a new friend.

Toby loves these cookies. I rolled out the entire recipe 1/4" thick, cut out lots and lots of 1" circles and baked for 20 min. We even mailed some to the doggie cousin in Texas. They ship well and keep well. Now if puppy housebreaking would only be going so well...

Very easy to make, but I think the amount of oil used may be too much - it was awfully "oily" or "greasy" feeling.  Also, the beef bouillon cubes adds an awful lot of salt to them.  I also think they should have baked longer as they really aren't very crispy like a dog treat usually is. They did smell great while baking,though,  and my dogs love them.  I just think I'll probably stick with the pumpkin & peanut butter treats I normally make for them as they seem healthier to me.

These cookies were easy to make, and my dog really liked them! I was expecting a crunchy biscuit-type treat, but they turned out kind of soft--like a cookie, I guess.

These were very easy and a great way to use whole wheat flour!  My puppies (all 3 of them) kept coming back for more!  I'll be making these for our extended dog families!

My dog loved these when I made them at Christmas for her and her dog friends. I made them again for Valentine's Day in heart shapes, and she never left the kitchen while they were baking.

These dog treats are amazing, my dog is somewhat picky and he absolutely loves them. His little ears perk up everytime he hears me ask if he wants a "cookie". I will continue to make this cookies regularly for my pets!

Please omit the sugar; your dog does not need it. It's bad for their teeth and waist-lines :)

They won't miss it -- honest!

My dogs love these cookies.  The changes I made were Chicken Bouillon instead of beef (didn't have any beef).  4 Baby carotts chopped finely (for veggies).  1/4 cup bacon drippings and 1/4 cup canola oil for the vegetable oil (for flavor).  A dash of garlic (helps with mosquitos).  The always want at least 2 each time.....

FYI boulion cubes often have onion, onion is toxic to dogs.

I substitute a pureed in a blender a can of chicken.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I did everything according to the recipe, except that I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  The dough was so sticky and unmanageable that I had to throw it away.  I tried adding flour to it to make it less sticky, but nothing worked.  I couldn't even knead it because it was sticking to my hands.

Very easy to make and my picky dog liked them.  I didn't have powdered milk so I substituted oatmeal in the same amount.  Everything else as written except I also added 2 tsp of baking powder and they puffed up nicely into perfect little bones!  I'll alternate this with our favorite "Birthday Bones" from this site as well.

These cookies were very easy to make.  They rolled out best if you chilled the dough before trying to roll out and cut. I used bone shaped cutters, along with Christmas shapes since they are for my holiday gift baskets.  My dog loves them, she was crying and scratching at the counter where they were sitting!

I made these for Christmas gift for our dog friends, but tried it one my dogs first.  They loved it.  I cut them into stars and bones.  I had no trouble, didn't use a rolling pin though, just flattened by hand to go quickly.

I'm not sure what I did wrong. The only substitute I made was using canola oil instead of vegetable oil, only because I didn't have veg oil & did have canola oil. I'm sure the recipients of these treats will still love them, but boy where they a pain to roll out! They were so dry & crumbly that I had to add water to them, and even that didn't help all that much. Will possibly try again, but this time around my kids are disappointed because they couldn't really help much. They were going to make them & take them to the Animal Rescue League. They were so excited to be able to help, but couldn't because it was so crumbly. Maybe next time!  :-(

I live with and breed Boston Terriers, and all three of my dogs LOVE these treats!  I made them last year for my own three dogs, and I sent small batches of them to all of the people who have gotten puppies from me.  Everyone said that their dogs loved them and several asked for the recipe.  I am going to have to make a huge batch of them this year for all of my babies.  Thank you so much for thinking of the four-footed food-lovers!  (By the way, I made half beef and half chicken.  They love both.)

Baked these as a Holiday treat for my friends' long hair dachshunds.  I have cats, so I gave a test cookie to my neighbor's dog.  One wasn't enough, so I think they're a success.  Will do an update after I find out if the dachshunds liked them.------UPDATE 1.3.13-------The cookies were a total success with the dachshunds!

Good? These treats should be called GREAT dog cookies! I added some ground flax seed for added nutrition. I think I actually heard my shih tzu say please?! Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. My picky Percy is pleased! Fit for husband consumption!

I made these cookies for gifts. The dogs loved them but I found the dough sticky to work with. I added more whole wheat flour and refrigerated it for about 20 minutes and it was then workable.

I made this recipe with my 5 year old cousin and it went really well. Very easy to make. I was surprised by the nutritional value of a single cookie, but then I realized that the recipe said it made a dozen of cookies. I made at least twice that amount and had some dough left over, so it turns out to be much less calories than I first thought.

Just made these cookies and my doggies - Cavalier King Charles Spaniels - love them!  They are pretty picky eaters, so these must be good!  Used no sodium bouillon and dogs still love them.

This is the most frustrating recipe I have ever tried to make. I followed the recipe to the letter and still the dough did not turn into anything resembling a that you could roll. I ended up spending about a half an hour trying to alter the recipe so that it could turn into something that actually resembles a dough. I would not recommend trying this recipe.

My Golden Doodle gives these two paws up.  They were quick and easy to make, much easier than many recipes I looked at.  I rolled and cut them out with dog bone cookie cutters and plan to make more to give as gifts to all my dog loving friends.

We have a dog grooming salon and often dogs turn up their noses at treats we purchase.  They LOVE these.  I am spending all of today making them to put in goodie bags for the clients at Christmas.  Only changes I made was to add 1 tablespoon each of garlic powder and flax seed.  I am doing all different shapes, bones, trees etc., but the easiest and a nice size for treats are cutting small squares, and do it on the cookie sheet.  One batch gave me 36- 2 1/2 inch bones plus 10- 4 1/2 inch bones.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Wonderful! My eight year old son did just about everything himself and enjoyed every minute of it. Of course we had to sample them and they were quite tasty! Our 14 year old Golden Retrieiver loved them, especially since they were soft cookies. I used chicken bouillon cubes instead of beef. Thanks!

I have made this recipe two years in a row.  Sometimes i will add a cup of peanut butter for extra flavor.  I always use sodium free boullion.  I have a dog bone cookie cutter.  Then I freeze them in those disposable ziplock rectangle food storage plastic thingos which fit the cookies just perfectly.  Then when it's time I take out a frozen cookie for my pooches OR I wrap a ribbon around a box to give as a gift to a neighbor for Christmas!!  They're a huge hit!!

These were good, I made them for a holiday present for my sister's dog- who by all accounts, scarfed them up! I tried them too- a little bland for my taste, and I didn't get a "meaty" flavor or smell from them, like you would think would appeal to a dog, but she liked them!

Well I am reviewing per my dogs reactions and I have to go with a 5.  They even preferred these over store bought treats.  Did not have a bone cookie cutter, so my youngest son and I used Easter cookie cutters (chicks, tulips & rabbits).  The dogs did not even seem to care  :0)  Thanks

This recipe is so easy to make and my very, very picky dog actually just ate one of the treats!  The dough is sticky but if you flour your hands and your working surface, it rolls out nicely and is very easy to cut with cookie cutters.  It also holds the shape of the cutters well.  I'll be making this over and over again.

These cookies are baking right now and they don't smell that bad! Sarah, the pooch at large, snatched up a ball of the dough left on the counter so I have no doubt she'll eat the rest! It was a bit sticky at first but I rolled it out using my hands and a half handful of whole wheat flour on the counter.

Dogs go stir crazy for this, and it is quick and easy to make.  I was a bit apprehensive when they came out of the oven, as they looked half cooked and were kind of bendy, but my pooch scarfed them down!  Overnight they turn satisfyingly hard like commercial dog cookies, and are excellent for dogs to hide between sofa cushions.  *grin*  A+

Your dog will love these special treats.  I have never seen my dog get this excited about a treat before.  I like the fact that I know what is in them, no preservatives and fillers.  Try them.

I'm giving it 5 stars for how simple and cheap they are to make. I used Christmas cookie cutters to fit the season. I was worried they would expand and not hold the shape but they stay the same size so don't worry about fitting them on the cookie sheet (also they are fine on an un greased sheet) can't wait to give them to my friends and families pups!

I used chicken bullion instead of beef and bacon grease instead of veggie oil and my puppy absolutely loves them!! Its great because I know what I'm feeding my dog and I'm happy about the ingredients and she loves them so much, I took her to the park and I had a small baggie of the treats tied to my belt, she tore it right off and ate them all haha.

i made a few changes to this recipe. instad of milk powder i used a 1/2 cup of instant potato' flakes for two reasons 1. they abosorb more moisture than powedered milk resulting in a crunchier cookie and 2. they add additional flavor. I also added in a 1/2 cup of peanut butter for added flavor and aroma that my dogs love! hope this review helps

Hobbes is a picky eater but he sure loves these. I used low sodium broth and added a jar of  baby food for some balance. The next batch I made I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Easy recipe to play with.

I live next to a park where people walk their dogs and I have a dog as well. I took these to the park and gave them to several of the dogs (with owners permission) and they all loved them. My dog was so excited to get these treats. I will make often!!

I decided to make these treats for all the family dogs for Christmas. I was going to double the recipe since I had 8 tins to fill, but I'm glad I didn't - there was more than enough! I used a bone cutter, a small heart cutter and a cat-shaped (lol) cutter. I added 1/3 peanut butter as per another review. I think that if I do this again, I will up the peanut butter to 2/3 cup and reduce the oil by half. The dough was pretty greasy but when baked and cool, it crisped up nicely. I really grossed out hubby when I sampled one. But they smelled so good while baking that I wanted to see what they tasted like (a non-salty wheat cracker). I'm sure they will be gobbled up!

My dog absolutely loved this cookies. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used all purpose flour. They turned out perfect. I used small round cookie cutters and they were also beatuful. When my mother saw the cookies (she didn't know they were for my dog), she asked me if she could eat one!

These dog treats were a huge hit with my dogs. The other reviewers comment about the dog doing a series of tricks without commands couldn't have described my dog any better :-). I will try the other reviews about the low to no sodium bouillon. !!! TWO PAWS UP !!!

I made these as Christmas gifts for some "dog friends".  My dogs sat in the kitchen the entire time and attacked every little morsel that dropped!  Every four-legged friend seemed to like them!

the dogs i made these for LOVED them!  i wondered how much more a dog would love homemade treats (they snarf down ANY kind of treat!) but they really liked these.  when given a choice between these treats and store bought, the dogs picked these!  (yellow lab, and a collie/shepherd mix)

Daisy and Max loved them much better than any other store bought treats. I used a dob biscuit cookie cutter and broke them in half. I also used low sodium chicken boullion. Next time I'll try the beef too.

My sister's dog, Mac, greeted us at our car when we visited them recently.  He KNEW there was something in the bag just for him because his nose didn't leave the box we carried in.  He LOVED these.  I felt almost guilty about using the bouillon cubes because I know they are health conscious in that household, and cubes are salty.  I followed the recipe exactly, though, and it came together so easily.  I don't know why people would bother to buy treats when these are so easy to make.  Mac thanks you!

These are the bomb!  I love how easily this dough comes together and how well it rolls out.  It was great to work with.  The dogs gave these high fives and were making 'excuses' to go outside just so that they could score a treat. I think I counted over 50 treats so this makes a nice amount to have on hand. At the rate they're being devoured, I'll have to make another batch!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

According to the behavior of the dogs, these cookies were FANTASTIC!  We left them on the counter by mistake one day, and came home to find the bag ripped to shreds and all of the cookies gone.  That's a lab for you!  But, I didn't worry, because I knew they were nutritionally sound and the dog would be fine. :)

I made two batches   The first made just as the recipe was written.I made a second batch using the a reduced juice from the pan after cooking pork chops . there was no fat and no salt added either. The dog who only came when he heard  his food dish being filled is now my shadow.   My 5 year old son  snitched one and came back to ask for another . go figure.

I can't say that they were the best tasting cookies ever but my dogs sure thought so! I made several batches. I even subsituted the beef boulion cubes for chicken and vegetable too. Great stuff! Perfect little treats.

My 4 dogs love these, even the one who will not eat dog treats at all.  This recipe makes lots of biscuits and since I do not have a dog biscuit cutter, I just sliced the dough in strips.  I used 50/50 flour and the dough was very easy to work with.  My husband like them too, lol.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, my pets appreciate it very much.

I have a picky Brittany who would rather eat treats than any regular food. But this treat had him resting his head on the edge of the table where they were cooling, wiggling and waiting impatiently for one. I make him work for treats, and when he thinks he's going to get one of these, he goes through a series of tricks without commands - I didn't know he was such a ham! I had to use more flour (about a cup), but that's not a problem. I sampled them - fresh out of the oven they taste sort of like wheat chex. :-)

The dough was WAY too sticky to roll, almost like cake batter.  I ended up doubling the flour to fix it, which took away all the taste.  I even put an egg/bullion glaze on these and my cat still won't eat them.  Maybe I'll have better luck with my mom's dogs.  It only cost me $1.60 in ingredients to make these, but I don't think I'll be making them again.

My dog loved them.  I put one down with her regular Science Diet treat.  She picked up her regular, walked over to the homemade, dropped the Science Diet and gobbled up the homemade treat.  She starts licking her lips every time she sees one.  We cut them into hearts.

This is a super easy recipe and a great one for kids to help with.  We (my 2 and 3-year old daughters and I) made them as gifts for my mom and sisters' dogs so I am not yet sure how much they like them.  I did not have any bone shaped cookie cutters and 2 of the dogs are VERY small, so I cut a few cookies freehand into hearts and bones, but ended up just cutting the rest into small squares.  Due to the small size this made many more than 1 dozen, probably closer to 4-5 dozen.

I had to use all prurpose flour.  As I started boiling the water with the bouillon cubes and searched for the wheat flour, that is when I realized I had no wheat flour.  I was so anger and couldn't go to the store because my kids wsere already in bed that I decided to use regular floud.  they turned out good.  my dog and the neighbors dogs love them!!  next time I will use wheat flour for a healthier cause.

The dog went nuts for these.  She'll do anything for even a piece.  This dough will make way more than a dozen treats.  I used a small cutter to make bite sized treats.  Roll the dough thicker for soft treats and thinner for harder treats.  I easily made 45 treats and then froze the other half of the dough to make later.

made this recipe for my mom's and my sister's dogs for christmas and both have said they loved them and want the recipe to make more. I used chicken instead of beef because I didn't have beef at the time so those work just as well. Thank you !!!!!!!!! you made dog's very happy.

I don’t like to make changes on my first time making. I will enhance with baby food next time. Good idea!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I make this every Christmas for all the dog friends and family. I have changed it to onion free chicken bullion, added peanut butter, eliminated  the brown sugar.and added  a little more water to make it easier to roll. I cut it out with Christmas cookie cutters. They are a big hit.  Thank you

These have been a pooch favorite for a while! There were more changes to the recipe that I'd like to admit, though. These have been made many times before, and are used as gift basket fillers for holidays. I don't really use cookie cutters because they stick to them, because I did reduce the amount of oil. Instead of beef, I use chicken broth (no garlic or onions).

So easy to make and handle I definitely will be using this recipe again. The least positive reviews say it came out sticky but that's probably bc they substituted the type of oil. My dogs usually don't like hard treats but they gobbled these up

My dogs loved them! Easy to make, though I had to add a bit more flour because it was too sticky to knead. Thanks!

I made these as a Christmas treat for the wonderful puppies in my life. 4 dogs tested, and all approved. While 2 will eat anything you put in front of them, obviously they gobbled theirs up right away, the other two are very picky. My picky eaters, we're very hesitant at first, but once they tried them, they couldn't get enough! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

i own a grooming shop, so occasionally i bake some treats for our clients. and they absolutely loved these cookies! they smelled so good that one of my clients' kid tried one too and said it was pretty good.
you can make a big batch and save it in an airtight container for at least a couple of weeks.

I made these cookies for my little boys and included a little package of them in the people food Christmas goodie boxes I made for our loved ones.  The cookies were quick and easy, best of all the boys gobbled them up.

I can't tell you how they taste personally!  However, my dog tries to go outside a second time in the mornings so that he gets another treat when he comes back.  He will do almost anything for these cookies.  The only drawback is that the aroma while they are baking isn't too apetizing for humans.  ;+)

I made these for my brother's Shar-Pei yesterday (for his birthday) and he absolutely LOVED them.  When we weren't looking, he went over and had his head in the bag, eating with delight!

These are great.  We used different sizes of dog bone shaped cookie cutters and put them in our gift baskets this year.  We got a "two paws up" from friends and family.  My cousin said her dog is spitting out his store bought biscuits after his good dog cookie supply ran out!!
