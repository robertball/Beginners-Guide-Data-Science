I'll admit it, I did not read the recipe all the way through before starting.  When I realized that there wasn't any orange juice in the actual cookie batter I pretty much wrote these little cookies off!  I added about 1 Tbls of orange zest to the batter and went a head and made them.  I am glad I did.  They are pretty good!  The icing needs a little tweeking, may be better if made with frozen orange concentrate.  My 3 1/2 year old thinks they are pretty good.  He likes them plain with no frosting.  I used a food processor and chopped the carrots and nuked them for 1 minute in the microwave.  This recipe is worth the effort if you want a light little cookie that is slighty sweet.
