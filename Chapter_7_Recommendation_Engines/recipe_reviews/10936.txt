Beware: Most crisp rice cereal contains malt flavoring which is not gluten free.

These are great cookies! Very tasty and easy to make.Watch the time though, in my oven it took only 9 minutes to bake them instead of the 12-15 in the recipe. It's a good recipe for my low carb diet and for my wheat intolerant friend for whom they were a birthday treat.

Good cookies...I will agree that you need to watch the baking time. (They cook quickly)  I added a drizzle of gaunche to jazz them up a bit.

Really strange texture, and didn't make anywhere near 2-3 dozen.

5 Stars for Taste! I love almond cookies and these deliver in taste.  I crushed up the cereal a bit.  I love the texture.  You do have to watch the cooking time, and the recipe doesn't make as many as stated.

I loved these cookies. I baked them for my personal Christmas treat. I did crunch up the rice cereal. I also used 1-4 cup of agave instead of brown sugar, I used lard instead of butter, "I cannot have dairy. I did not put chopped almonds in the mix, instead I pressed a toasted whole almond into each cooky. They were great!

We really like these delicious crispy cookies.  I too crushed the cereal a little.  It made 18 average sized cookies for me.  Right when these cookies are gone, they're asking me to make more!  Nice buttery flavor!

Awesome cookies! I used vanilla instead of almond extract and 1/3 cup of honey instead of sugar, and they turned out great.

Very tasty and light, but fell apart easily.
