These are fantastic. Much easier also if you use a "salsa verde" in place of the whole tomatillo/blender thing. I also made them with Monterey Jack once instead of queso fresco, and that was good too. I usually end up putting a red enchilada sauce (or tortilla chowder from trader joe's) on top, so they are a bit saucier. Without it they seem a bit dry, but overall they are great, and even my 3 young kids like them. Not as time consuming as they might seem, either.

If anyone is looking for a variation to this recipe; I didn't have time to soften the tortillas in oil so instead I lined the 9x13 pan with the corn tortillas then I spread the bean/potato mixture on top of that and then I layed down another layer of corn tortillas.  I poured on the green sauce (which is delicious!) and then I crumbled the queso fresco on top of that. ¡Muy fácil!  My husband loved this recipe and next time I'm going to add some ground turkey....

Good flavor, but would not make again as per recipe.  If I make it again, I would definitely add sauce to the potato/bean mixture because the insides were dry.  And I would also change the cheese to a cheddar/jack combo or mexican four cheese blend, or something.  The queso fresco didn't have a good melting quality to it.  But I liked the flavors, thanks for the recipe.

I substituted sweet potatoes for the white potatoes, and it turned out absolutely perfect!

Another TERRIFIC enchilada recipe that I've found from this site! I've made this twice; the first time, I really wanted to try this, was short on time, and didn't have tomatillos (or the time to get some) so replaced the tomatillo sauce with canned green chile enchilada sauce. The second time, I made the recipe as written. Both ways are VERY good - I just found the original to be a *little* bland so will probably spice it up with jalepenos next time. Otherwise, this is absolutely delicious!

These enchiladas are AWESOME!  One caveat:  Do NOT put the hot tomatillo/onion/cooking water mix into a blender!  It will explode -- seriously!  I substituted red jalapeno salsa for the ketchup and a combination of plain, soft goat cheese and shredded cheddar for the queso fresco.  Yum!

This truly was delicious. I made many modifications, however.

I made my salsa with 4 tomatoes (the grocery store didn't have tomatillos this week - hey, it's Canada!), 1 medium onion, 1 jalapeno pepper and 1/2 an avocado (delish!). Drain ALL the water before blending, otherwise it'll turn out too runny.

I also added more cumin and chili pepper to the potatoes (I'm a big fan of cumin). Instead of adding the potato mixture to an oiled pan, I mixed the oil directly with the potatoes.

I couldn't find corn tortillas, so I used the flour variety instead.

I had many compliments! But wathc out for the jalapeno pepper. Instead of blending directly into the tomato mixture, blend it on its own and add slowly until obtaining the spice level you desire.

Muy bien!

i'm a vegetarian, but i'm also lactose-intolerant (lots of interesting things happen to you after you have a baby, consider yourself warned ;) ), so i made these without the queso. i know, however, that it would have made a big difference with it added, to balance the other flavors and add some creaminess. next time i might add some dairy-free sour cream, for texture if not for flavor. even without queso, these were really good. i had to cook the potatoes longer than 25 mins, but didn't dare cook the enchiladas longer than the 20 suggested. i'd add in some garlic with the potatoes next time, and probably a jalepeno or two. overall a good recipe, one i'm sure i'll make again. thanks!

I made these for the vegan crowd at a dinner I catered, and they seemed to really enjoy them. (left out the cheese this time) I was not impressed with the tomatillo sauce while I was making these - it seemed rather sour. Of course, I put way too much of it in the food processor at once and ended up with a tomatillo-covered kitchen. Yuck! I also was trying to be more healthy and did not fry my tortillas - big mistake. I think it was just the brand of tortillas I bought, because I have had success not frying tortillas before. But with these I ended up with all broken enchiladas. :(  But they just end up being chopped up when you eat them anyway, and the vegans really did enjoy them. I think I might give them a shot at home one of these days.

delicious and quite filling! I added some enchilada sauce to the potato and bean mix. Also, i substituted mexican mix cheese for the queso fresco. Also, there were no tomatillo at my local store, so used salsa verde as suggested by others. Fantastico !!

This is a GREAT vegetarian Mexican dish! I did follow other reviews and changed it up just for my own taste although the original recipe sounds just as good. I decided to make it casserole style, layering it as follows: sauce, tortillas, bean/potatoes mix, sauce, cheese, tortillas, sauce, cheese. I ended up cooking the potatoes for about 50 minutes until they were tender and browned. I added a diced haberno pepper to the tomatillos/onion mix (making this green sauce is so worth it and better than store bought!). I used about 8 small flour tortillas and tore them into pieces. I had leftover homemade refried beans with jalapenos that I used and have to admit that I think their consistency really held the dish together better than regular pinto beans would have (I used a recipe from The Pioneer Woman's website). I used a 10 oz wheel of queso fresco and added 6 oz of cubed pepper jack cheese. Used a 9x13 dish that I covered and baked for 30 minutes. So delicious and even better the 2nd day as leftovers. This will be a staple in my household from now on!

We really enjoyed this.  I roasted my potatoes for at least 30 min, and they were still a little crunchy, even after the addition 20 min baking time for the whole casserole.  I diced them pretty small, so I was surprised they didn't cook down, but I was in a rush and didn't have time to cook them longer.  Oh well, next time.  I also couldn't find queso fresco, which I really like, so I used the last of a bag of Mexican blend and some cheddar.  I also just bought a jar of green salsa instead of the tomatillos, and next time I would either add even more, or buy some green enchilada sauce.  All in all, these were really good with a dollop of sour cream!

The sauce on this is just so so but the filling is the best.  It is even better made with sweet potatoes.

I ended going the easy route and using salsa verde from the store and enjoying it nonetheless.  I also opted for black beans and lighter cheese.  Have to say it was one of the most filling meals I have made in a while.

YUMMY!  I incorporated ideas from several other reviews.  I added a can of red enchilada sauce to the filling, used a jar of salsa verde instead of making my own, and made it into a casserole when I was having trouble rolling the enchiladas.  It turned out magnificently and I will definitely be making this again soon!

Thought it was delicious! YUM. I used green enchilada sauce instead of the whole make your own thing. Only other change was that i used white tortillas and added a little garlic powder to the potatoes.

This recipe, as written is fairly average... however, with some upgrades, it turns into a 4-5 star recipe.  Will post my version asap!

The first review I've written - these enchiladas are delicious! Pros: Flavorful, filling, easy, makes a ton Cons: Prep time is long, but I mean, it's enchiladas, what do you expect? I used flour tortillas because I like them better - made about 16 enchiladas, and had to use an 8x8 in addition to the 9x13. I added a serrano pepper to the tomatillo salsa to kick things up a notch - delicious. You could use less queso fresco and still enjoy the enchiladas. A great vegetarian dinner that will please even the meat-eaters at the table.

The tomatillo enchilada sauce needed a lot of additional seasoning (primarily salt) but other than that... it was fantastic!

The flavors were a nice combination, but the filling was dry.  Next time I will add some sour cream or cream cheese to the filling.  I will also use Monterrey Jack cheese - the flavor of the queso wasn't strong enough to support the other flavors.  Overall, it was a good recipe that our veggie family enjoyed.

I made a simplified version of this for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious.  I made the sauce the same(but added salt) but then used just beans and queso fresco in the enchiladas--it was a hit and I will make it again!!

Wow! This is another great vegetarian recipe from this site to add to my rotation! I followed the recipe exactly, except to substitute red enchilada sauce for ketchup (and added some extra to keep the inside moist), and I used shredded monterey jack cheese, since I didn't have any queso fresco. Delicious flavor!! Very time consuming though, but it was definitely worth it.

These were wonderful.  I multiplied this recipe multiple times over to uses 5 lbs of potatoes and I gave many trays away to friends and family.  These can be a bit dry, so I would make extra tomatillo sauce next time.

I'm transitioning into a veggie and this was my first attempt at a vegitarian dish and it was GREAT. I saw some reviews that said the potato mixture was bland so I grab some enchilada sauce. Next time I won't add so much sauce or fry my tortillas because they broke apart as we were eating :( I also took another reviewers advice and used salsa verde. I'm a full time college student and work full time and any time I can save is great!

I made these after getting tomatillos and potatoes in our farm share.  Cooking and blending the tomatillos was easy.  I had a less than a pound of tomatillos and it was a little on the drier side but I am sure a full pound would have been plenty to make enough sauce.

Pretty good, but could use a bit more of a kick. Made it as a casserole (layered tortillas and potato/bean filling). I also added 2 aruba peppers to the tomatillo sauce, and blended it using my stick blender (best appliance ever!).  Could use extra cheese. Also might try adding some jalapeno to the sauce to make it spicier.

Very good. My family absolutely loved it and I've been reusing the Salsa Verde recipe and branching out to make some great green salsa! I felt like the mixture was a little dry though so next time I may put some salsa or something inside of the burritos. I will also start using some green chilies in my salsa and add some spicier spices to the mixture to give it a little more flavor!

Best recipe I have ever gotten from allrecipes.  I used shredded mexican style cheese and make sure to drain the tomatillos and onions.  I added jalepenos then salsa when it was done.  OMG it was amazing.  Literally, the best meal of my life.

Yummy! Even my meat loving brother-in-law thought it was awesome.  I used tomatillos, onions, and a couple of jalopenos from our garden.  The only change I made was to add a clove of garlic and two jalapenos.

This is amazingly good.  I subbed salsa verde for the tomatillos, and added a little extra sauce, per some of the reviews.  Also, I sauteed a couple jalapenos, the onions, 4 sliced mushrooms and two garlic cloves, then added this to the potato mixture before baking it.  Made this casserole style and topped w/ a mix of cheddar and jalapeno pepper jack, and sliced olives.  Great way to use up extra homemade refried beans.

Flavor was bland overall. Potatoes needed more seasoning. Cheese was totally bland. Sauce was watery - please give us a clue as to how much water to use! Very starchy. Not sure how this got so many stars. Based on reviews, it needs a lot of modification.

These were so good! I was a little skeptical.  We are not vegetarians, but trying some meatless meals for hubby's cholesterol. These were loved by everyone, even my little kids.  The only thing I would change is to cook the potatoes a little longer.  Also, I just layered tortillas on the bottom of the pan, added mixture, layered more tortillas on top, then added the sauce and cheese.  It was easy this way!

A little time consuming but really good outcome! I didn't have queso fresco so i used pepper jack instead, and it added a nice heat to it. We will probably make it again when we have time!

These are amazing! I made them for my friend's birthday and everyone loved them. I ended up making a few changes. I bought Salsa Verde sauce (I really like Las Palmas green chili enchilada sauce) and I coated each tortilla in the enchilada sauce before frying them. I also added fresh garlic, and a dash of cayenne to the potatoes. Oh and I added sauteed onion and bell pepper to the potato/bean mixture.

These were super easy to make.  I'm a vegan so I opted for no cheese but I do think next time I will buy some vegan sour cream. MMMM.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe helped me use up some tomatillos I had. I didn't have any corn tortillas, serano chile peppers, queso fresca or pinto beans but I was able to come up with something very tasty by loosely following the directions. I prepared the potatoes and tomatillo sauce as directed. When it came time to put the ensemble together, I mixed in some black beans and cilantro with the potatoes, topped that with the tomatillo sauce, and finished it with a dallop of sour cream and a sprinkle of feta. Awesome dish, the cheese really makes it work.

What a delicious recipe! I used a tomatillo salsa instead of making it to save time and effort. I also didn't peel the (red) potatoes. Everything came out great. My boyfriend said it was the best vegetarian meal he has ever had! Will definitely be making it again.

A yummy, filling vegetarian recipe.  I did find it to be a bit bland and a bit dry as written, so I put some of the tomatillo sauce inside with the potato/bean mix as other reviewers suggested, and I added about 1/2 jalapeno, diced. These enchiladas were enjoyed by all, thank you for sharing!

Read through the reviews first and made this as a casserole: tortillas, then beans/potatoes, then another layer of tortillas.  Combined beans, potatoes, 1/2 of cheese and pre-made salse verde (didn't measure, just eyed) and poured this on top of first tortilla layer--the filling was moist this way.  Crumbled the rest of the cheese on top of the second tortilla layer and covered with more salsa--again, just eyed it.  This is better the second day, but a keeper.

This is a great recipe! I love the flavors. I did make a few changes to the recipe, but I think even without them it would have been great. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and diced them finely, and they were not crunchy when they came out of the oven.

The changes I made were to use 3 tbsp. of salsa in the potatoes instead of 1 tbsp. of ketchup, and to add some cayenne pepper to make them spicier. I also added a spoonful of sour cream to the potato and bean mixture to help it stick together better, and I used a cheddar/monterey jack blend instead of the queso. Finally, I just used the red enchilada sauce you get in a can instead of making the tomatillo sauce -- I took the path of least resistance, but they still came out great. Thanks!

YUMMY!!!  

I added some left over rice and a few chopped carrots and almonds for crunch, and doubled the amount of cheese (we're still adjusting to a vegetarian lifestyle...).  Super good!!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I used macayos green enchilada sauce, which is by far the best green enchilada sauce I have ever had, in place of the tomatillo sauce. I also layered them like lasagna, which was just easier for me. Great flavor and super cheap to prepare!

This one was a big hit for us!  My finacee is not too happy about eating less meat but he really liked this one.  The only thing I changed was I used flour tortillas and I used a can of tomatillos instead of the fresh.  I poured the entire can (with water/juice) into a sauce pan with the onion, etc. No extra water is needed.  I also added quite a bit of cilantro to the sauce and it gave it a lovely flavor.  Also it really is easier to make than you would think.

potato needs a little longer cook time.  I did the casserole version (lay tortillas flat instead of messing with them breaking) and used verde enchilada sauce.  Yum.

I LOVED this vegetarian low fat recipe!  I made a lot of modifications to suit my taste: used sweet potatoes instead of white, added garlic powder and oregano to spices and 1/4 cup tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  Mashed the potatoes and added a bit of ricotta and tomato sauce to moisten.  Folded in the beans. Softened the tortillas in warm tomato sauce instead of oil (this works identically and cuts fat).  Also added fresh garlic, white wine, and green chiles to tomatillo salsa.  Mont jack cheese instead of fresca.  I know I seemed to have changed it a lot, but was soooo yummy - GREAT basic recipe.  THANK YOU!

Very good recipe!! I made it as directed and found it a little bland for my tastes, but still very good. Directions are a little vague on draining tomatillo water or not. I left the water in and it worked well. The sauce seemed very runny at first but I think the moisture kept the enchiladas from getting too dry during baking. I will probably drain off a small amount of the water next time. Very good recipe!!

My hubby LOVED these! He was hesitant to try them and was kind of grumbling that he wasn't getting any meat for dinner, but the moment he took a bite he raved about them! Instead of using the salsa verde from this recipe, I used the Three Chile Dry Roasted Salsa recipe from this site (just experimenting). For me, BIG mistake...for hubby, he LOVED. Turned out way too spicy for me, so next time I'm going to use the salsa verde on this recipe so that I can eat dinner too...LOL! I will definitely be trying this one again!

Good stuff! I use black beans, an unpeeled sweet potato, and salsa in place of the ketchup. Stirred the potato and spices halfway through the first 20 minute bake and added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I made individual enchiladas and only needed 10 tortillas. 2nd time: we added about 1/4 cup green chili for moisture and spice; fixed this as a double layer casserole; heat through at 325 after combined for about 30 minutes. We only use about  1/2 a bunch of cilantro and a "Mexican" 4 cheese blend.

This was SO, SO tasty.  Trying to cut down on fat/cal, so didn't fry the tortillas and was still really good.  Didn't have pinto beans in our pantry so I used black bean, again, still really tasty. I had some leftover potato mix I used in breakfast burritos the next day! Yum.

Delicious.  I did, as some mentioned, add sauce to the inside of the enchiladas.  I also added a jalapeno and a green tomato to my sauce and a little vinegar.  It was really great.

This is now one of my husband's favorites.  Few small alterations:  -We add some chilis/chili powder and garlic to the sauce. -We don't fry the tortillas. -We use black beans instead of pinto.  Just a personal preference. -We use lots of jack cheese in addition to/instead of the queso fresco.  We like cheesey enchiladas.

A great-tasting, unique vegetarian recipe.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  However, we both agreed that next time I should make double the tomatillo sauce, and spread a little in the baking dish before I put the enchiladas in. Other than that, I will not change a thing next time!

This was delicious! I didn't use the tomatillos. I used a can of enchilada sauce mixed with chopped grren chilies. I also used some Tony Chacheres seasoning. I will definitly make again and again.PS-I also used sharp cheddar cheese.

I made this for an office potluck where we have many vegetarians.  Veg's and meat eaters alike loved it.  However, I used just the filling ideas, mixed cheddar and monterrey jack, added some frozen corn maybe 1/2 cup, for color & protein, skipped making the tomatillo sauce (which I make religiously when my garden is great for any green salsa recipe) used canned green salsa and enchilada sauce mixed, gave texture and flavor, and made as a casserole.  Slice the tortillas into 1 inch or so pieces.  Pour a bit of the sauce on the bottom of the caserole dish. Layer like a lasagna - One bottom layer of tortilla, top with potato and bean mix, a little sauce, then another layer of tortilla slices. and more sauce.  Cheese as needed. and sauce as needed. and tortillas as needed. Tortillas, cheese and chile sauce, just those 3 ingredients, in any combination, and you can't go wrong!!!!!!

I thought this was very tasty.  I used a jarred tomatillo salsa instead of making it and I also added some salsa to the potato mixture so it wouldn't be dry.  Will make again.

Just moved to Vermont from Texas and these were just what I was looking for: not too hard to put together, vegetarian, very good.  I up-ed the spice a bit with some chile pequin flakes, though.

I substituted green taco sauce for the tomatillo sauce, but it was great.

This was better than I hoped for! I was low on time so I made several adaptations. I cooked the potato in the microwave, peeled it, diced it and added the seasoning on the top (minus the catsup).  I mixed it in a bowl with the beans. I made it as a burrito- the filling rolled into a flour tortilla. I poured store bought Salsa Verde over the top and heated it in the microwave. I added chopped red onion and cilantro over the top and served with guacamole. I made it  vegan and did not use any cheese. Surprisingly good!!!!

Love this recipe! I added hot sauce and a little garlic powder to the potatoes and a jalapeno to the tomatillo mix. I would also start the tomatillo salsa first, then work on the potatoes to maximize time spent, especially since you need to let it cool a little before blending. I added Monterey Jack cheese and halved the queso fresco. When I rolled the tortillas, I dipped them in the salsa first. It was so good and really got the flavor of the salsa into the enchiladas. The balance of the tartness of the tomatillos and the floweriness of the corn tortillas was divine. I highly recommend this!

I added some salsa verde to the potato/bean mixture to combat the dryness everyone mentioned, as well as adding some jalapenos and chili sauce.  It turned out great.

A great dish that is easily customizable for your tastes.  Try adding some Coby Jack to the filling and garnish for a more cheesy option.

Made this last night, but I improvised a bit.  Instead of just a can of Pinto beans, I used 2 cans of chili beans, which has Pintos in it.  Also doubled the chili powder.  Next time, I will use perhaps 1/2 the amount of Cilantro.  My vegetarian daughter loved it, which says a lot!  Thanks!

made this tonight. Wanted to follow the recipe, but decided to use a can ofLas Palmas green enchilada sauce instead of cooking the tomatillos. Also, added some packaged mexican cheese blend along with the fresh queso. It came out awesome and has earned a place in my kitchen as a regular weekly meal option.

Loved it.  Added green chilies, onion, and garlic to the fillling.  Substitute feta for the queso fresco but next time I think I'll try goat cheese.  I thought the flavors were fabulous.  Very flavorful, though not spicy hot.  Not sure what people who found it bland did?

Good flavors and a nice vegetarian version of enchiladas.  I'll definitely use flour tortillas (and call them enchilada style burritos), and add more beans the next time.  Make sure the potatoes are nice and soft before filling.

A bit more time-intensive than my usual throw-whatever-I-have-together enchildadas, but pretty tasty nonetheless! I didn't have queso fresco, so used jack cheese, but everything else was as written.  I would agree that these on their own are bland and I think it's the sauce -- not the potatoes -- that needs spice help.  I'm just not sure it's jalapeno or cumin that it requires.  Maybe a squeeze of fresh lime upon serving?  I also agree that serving these along with some sour cream would signficantly improve the overall flavor. I found myself scraping most of the tomatillo sauce off to get to the potatoes, which were yummy on their own. If I could give this one 3.5 stars, I would.

This is the worst recipe from this site I have ever had.  It might have been sort of bland and mushy but edible if it hadn't been for the sauce, which smelled like grass before it was cooked and was so sour afterward that it made the dish inedible. Total waste of my limited budget money.

These were tasty at first bite, but became bland after having a few bites. They were fun to make but I wouldn't make them again.

This is a good starter recipe. Needs more spice though and is a bit labor intensive, but it's worth it. Easily makes 2 9x13 pans full of enchiladas which are very filling. Next time I may add green chili to the sauce or jalapenos.

I adore this recipe.  I have made this more times than I can count!  I remember making this for my mother -- when I told her what was in them, she thought they sounded disgusting.  But after she tried them, she asked for the recipe, and it remains one of her (and my) favorite dishes to this day.  It's so good!

I think this is one of the best vegetarian recipes I have made from this site.  Even my non-vegetarian husband  went back for seconds.  I used black beans instead of pinto and layered it like a casserole since I hate rolling them.  Since I did it as a casserole, I also cut the # of tortillas and the sauce in half.  They were really good!

Not bad.  This is more of a note to myself, but don't use more pinto beans than called for.  I only had a larger can and I didn't want to waste them and I knew I wouldn't eat them before they went bad, so I threw the entire can in.  Too much, for sure.  They made the rest of the recipe too bland.  I used two small cans of salsa verde and a little extra medium red salsa.  I think the extra salsa was imperative.  If I hadn't had the extra beans, I'd give it a good solid 4 stars.

Very yummy and filling, thou you can have these ("a sufficiency", my Nana used to say) and not be left with that awful "stuffed-full" feeling. I like the tomatillos - I haven't ever tried them before but now our market carries them so I thought: "worth a try" and I'm glad I did!

We took the barebones of this recipe and changed it to make it a much quicker, easier recipe to make. For the potatoes I used a bag of homefries from the frozen foods areas and cooked those up. Black instead of pinto beans (preference), and canned enchilada sauce. I thought the combination was very tasty but recommend for those getting canned enchilada sauce to get 2 cans, one was not quite enough. I will try different varations of this in the future.

YUM!  I am a vegetarian and really have enjoyed these enchiladas.  Even as leftovers they are fantastic.  I did make some changes- I realized I was out of cumin while preparing these so I used taco seasoning and chili powder on the potatoes.  I used canned tomatillos and dried onion flakes in the blender as the sauce and didn't like the taste so I added my favorite salsa.  I messed up on filling and put all the cheese in the enchiladas and none on top.  I will make this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

The recipe doesn't say to drain the tomatillo, onion mixture before pureeing in the food processor with the cilantro, but I'm pretty sure you're supposed to drain it.

My husband and I loved this recipe! After reading other reviews I made some simple changes. I used both pepper jack cheese (inside) and queso fresco (outside), I also added about 1/3 cup homemade enchilada sauce to the inside as many said the recipe was a bit dry. Unable to find tomatillos, I used 1 jar of Trader Joes Salsa Verde to cover the enchiladas. The final result was a bit spicy and just moist enough. Delicious! Can't wait to make again for my son this time!

It was pretty good.  I think next time i will incorporate ground beef ,i just couldn't wrap my taste buds around the potatoes. I followed the recipe with the suggestions found in a few reviews, one using salsa verde and finely shredded Mexican blend cheeses, also I layered to be more of a casserole.  Will definitely make again

I made this using a store-bought salsa verde.  The enchiladas were pretty dry coming out of the oven, but tasted pretty good with a lot of salsa over them. We used vegan cheese since my wife is vegan, and she said she thought they were good and she is not always easy to please.

Delicious!! I already had large flour tortillas and used them instead of corn. I like the softness and size of the flour. The potato mixture has a nice flavor. So does the tomatillo sauce. I like things on the saltier side. I would probably add some salt to the tomatillo sauce. I also used more queso fresco. I will make it again. Very filling and tasty.

I liked this recipe for the salsa  Verde and filling.  The potatoes took longer to bake, but were nice and spicy. I used large flour tortillas. Used vegan "cheese" and left out the onions in the salsa.  I will be making this again.

Really the queso fresco is used for garnishing . Put on top of enchiladas or any salad cause it doesn’t melt . But other than that I loved the recipe

This was very good. My husband liked it, too. I was cooking out of my pantry with what was on hand. So canned diced potatoes and shredded cheddar.  No ketchup, so used tomato paste. I only had a 7 oz can of green tomatillo sauce, so I had to add a can of green enchilada sauce. I would have made it as given, but did not want to go to the grocery store. Any meatless dish my hubby likes is a winner to me!

Fabulous. The only things I did differently was use salsa and green enchilada sauce in place of the tomatillos and regular Monterey Jack cheese.

My family loved the enchiladas even the non vegetarians. We live in the SW so I did make some changes to add more spiciness. I added: a can of diced green chilis and a little extra chili powder. I did take a shortcut and buy canned green enchilada sauce. Overall - a very good recipe. We loved the potatoes in the recipe, normally I've used rice, but no more!

OMGoodness!!!!! I l-u-v-e-d this recipe!!!!! I changed a couple of things tho: I add del monte canned green beans. Then I heat the juice left over from the can up and add a little bit of honey, hot red peppers, soy sauce, and paprika. It's a to die for dippin' sauce!!! Oh and then I garnish the whole thing with artfully arranged chopped up fruit loops (don't judge - it actually adds a sweet little kick and ties it all together!!). I serve it to my picky little niece and nephews every time they come over. They love it and have requested it for every family dinner! I highly recommend this recipe!!!!

I made this as enchilada casserole and reduced the tortillas to 12. I also added 1 cup of Pepper Jack cheese and increased the garlic to 6 cloves
Otherwise I  followed the recipe as written. It was ok. Filling and good enough but lacking in a wow factor.  It was dry even though I increased the green sauce. Maybe that was due to the fact that I made it on casserole form.

These were really good. I think next time I'll add jalapenos, we really missed the spice.

This is the first recipe I've used with tomatillos.  It was easy and good!  A fairly picky daughter liked them so much, she ate all of the leftovers.  I used purple potatoes, since the russets aren't all that good for you, and they worked perfectly.

Omg. These are freaking fantastic! I made this recipe as is. Only thing I changed was I used Herdez brand green salsa (tomatillo sauce) just bc it's always been our favorite. Everything else I kept exactly as written. Absolutely delicious. I will def be putting this recipe into our regular rotation.

Like others have mentioned, my potatoes came out undercooked even with extra time in the oven.  
I didn't have all the ingredients, so my recipe came out like this:

I used canned black beans with jalapenos,
3 flour tortillas torn in half,
mozarella cheese,
green onion boiled with 4 tomatillos,
all the other spices listed except cilantro,
 I added garlic powder, jarred diced garlic, and black pepper.

I added salt to the pureed tomatillos and it tasted sour/sweet.

I layered the tortillas and mixed some tomatillo sauce with the potato/bean/cheese mix in between.

The first night I made it, I didn't like the taste of the sour tomatillo.

Leftovers were addicting though!!! I usually end up liking the taste of leftovers after all the flavors have marinated with eachother.  I could not stop eating this, it was sooo good!!! The next day I added some routisserie chicken for more protein.

These are fantastic. Had my mum and dad over for dinner and they loved it! And they are super picky. Will definitely make these again. I used a mandoline to shred the potatoes, instead of dicing them.

Fantastic! I added a little enchilada sauce to the filling. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese. I used green salsa instead of making the tomatillo sauce. This was a great recipe! I really love enchilada sauce, so I think next time I'll try adding green salsa to the filling (it is a great mix with the potatoes and beans)and top with enchilada sauce. Thanks for sharing!

These were tasty but needed some more sauce.  I'll double sauce next time.

I followed the recipe, exactly, except I added a jalapeno to my tomatillo sauce to give it a kick. These were really tasty and quite filling.

This was really good! The recipe for the potatoes alone is excellent. I just wanted to eat them by themselves, and once I added the beans, cheese and cilantro, I didn't even want to put them in tortillas and bake it. I would eat it just like that!

Anyway I wanted to comment because I think the serving size for this recipe is tiny! There's no way this would feed 12 people unless it is an appetizer or something. 1 pound of potatoes - that's basically one potato. So you're saying one potato and one can of pinto beans will fill up 12 people?! I can eat that much on my own. Using all those tortillas makes the dish larger, but in my opinion there is not nearly enough filling to fill up as many tortillas as the recipe calls for. I used flour tortillas and used a lot less. I guess if you REALLY like tortillas and just want a little flavor to add to them, it would be fine.

But like I said, good flavors, and the baked potatoes are amazing if you add some butter! It makes a great side dish.

WOW !!! DELISH. I saw these and thought they looked good but sounded like it might be a weird combination but I was wrong!! they were sooo good! The tomatillo salsa with the potato and beans were a perfect combo. The queso fresco was a perfect cheese too! Will be making again for sure!!! I added 1 1/2 tsp of  salt to the onion/tomatillo mixture

I can't say that I will make this again. It is very time-consuming and it was lacking in some flavor. It was not terrible, but not good.
