This was pretty good, but I did make adjustments based on what I had on hand and for my tastes. I had leftover white quinoa so used that; subbed freshly grated Parmesan cheese for nutritional yeast and freshly grated turmeric root for the ground. I agree with other reviewers, though, that a tablespoon of ground turmeric seems like far too much. I'd say less than 1 teaspoon would be enough. And if I make this again, I'd use a bit less lemon juice.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like this at all and didn't end up eating more than two bites. I'm a very adventurous eater and there's not much I won't eat. The seasonings were way off. 1 tbsp of turmeric seemed way too much to me, so I erred on the side of caution and only used half the amount - still too much. It made the dish so incredibly bitter. I also used less nutritional yeast than called for, about 1/3 cup. This had an interesting smell when cooking. Not something I would make again, even with tweaks.

As a fresh take on asparagus, I really liked it. Used a lot less turmeric, though.

I used fresh turmeric and grated it in to taste. Really good and healthy that way.
