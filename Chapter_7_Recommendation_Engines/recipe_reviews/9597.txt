Great recipe. I followed the above reviewers addition (3 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2) and it turned out very well.

Good cookie to make using cookie cutters.  It spreads a lot while cooking so place them far apart on your baking sheet

This recipe I give 4 stars only because it was lacking a few ingredients.  You need more flour or they will sink after you take them out of the oven.  Add 3 cups flour and 2 tablespoons maple syrup.

This recipe is the exact same as Mary's sugar cookies minus 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. I dont understand why this has gotten any negative reviews. These cookies are absolutely wonderful. They roll well, bake well, and taste perfect.

I made this exactly as it says, except for I baked them right away. I rolled them into balls and then flattened them. They spread quite a bit so just be mindful! They came out perfect and delicious. My roommate wouldnt even share them with her boyfriend!

I printed this recipe off 5 years ago (the instructions were divided differently but it was the same submitter, same recipe) and a school group used this recipe regularly for cookies to decorate at events.  We never had ANY problem with them.  My friends STILL ask me for "my" sugar cookies!

This recipe was easy to follow and the cookies turned out great! Nice and chewy the way I like them. Sugar cookies are my boyfriend's favorite so they were a big hit! I sprinkled mine with some colored sugar.

I was disappointed in these. The batter was fine easy to roll out and cut, but to me it really lacked flavor. Not one I will repeat.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, except I left out the baking soda (didn't have any).  I kept them in the fridge for 24 hours (until I had time to roll them out).  They rolled out perfectly.  My 4 year old daughter and ten year old son helped me decorate them.  They were great.  I had compliments on them.  I have been looking for a sugar cookie recipe and I have finally found one.  Thank you for sharing.

These cookies baked amazing!  The flavor and texture was perfect.  Several people asked for the recipe.  ONE PROBLEM: The dough does not roll out easily.  I had to sprinkle milk over it, microwave it for 20 seconds and mix it again.

I didnt like these cookies for decorating w/ my kids, they fell apart to easy. I rolled the left over dough into a log, then rolled it into a mixture of sugar, cinnamon, and ground pecans. Then I just sliced it to make the cookies.

My family and I all thought these cookies were delicious! I had a tough time rolling the dough at first because the dough had gotten really hard in the fridge. After they were out for a little while it was much easier.

I followed the instructions to the letter, and yet nothing went right with these.  They wouldn't roll out properly, they sank after I took them out of the oven.  Managed to salvage them by making them into what we call 'pie cookies.'

somewhat bland - lacks sweetness and flovor
