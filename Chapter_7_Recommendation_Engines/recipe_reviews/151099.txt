The cut of meat is definitely the best part of the recipe but it seemed a shame to fry it as opposed to grilling it.  The marinade didn't appear to add any flavour and although it was extremely simple to make, it was rather plain for our liking.

My mother-in-law just made something very similar for us and it was delicious. Instead of vermouth, she used bourbon, marinated it for days, and then grilled it. Yum.
