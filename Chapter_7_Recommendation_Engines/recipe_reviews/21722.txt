Super quick and easy recipe. I loved it and so did my family. Instead of putting in the carrots and celery I just used a bag of fresh veggies (carrots, brocoli, and sugar snap peas). Excellent and healthy!! Serve over rice if you aren't watching the carbs.

This was so good! I didn't have pineapples, so I used some apple juice instead. I'll make this again. Definitely.

This was good, but needed more flavor.  Next time I'll try doubling the spices.

5 stars for the sauce but only 4 when made with fish.  I am not sure why I wanted to make this recipe, the more I got into making it, the more I thought it was a strange way to have fish.  I didn't cut the fish into pieces, I just cooked the fillets whole.  My husband really liked it.  The sauce is excellent and I am going to make the sauce with chicken and stir fry vegetables next time.

Husband loved it.  He's Chinese-American.  I didn't enjoy it.  Too sweet.

We followed the recipe to the T . . . except we had to use talapia because halibut was impossible to find.  It was still yummy, but you have to be REALLY careful when stirring it or the fish ends up as mush.

Definitely high marks for being fast and easy to do.  I wasn't jazzed by the taste - but I may have overcooked the halibut.  I am anxious to see how it re-heats, but overall a good solid dish.
