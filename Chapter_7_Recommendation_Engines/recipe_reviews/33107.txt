I never liked cake doughnuts but since I had a pot of oil to use I decided to try this recipe. These are the lightest cake doughnuts I've ever made. We LOVE them! I used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon in mine. After mixing I let the dough sit in the bowl for 15 minutes before deep frying so the BP could work. The dough was nice and puffy even raw. Instead of dropping spoonfulls in the hot oil I wet my fingertips slightly and gently pulled the dough flat-ish. Much easier to cook this way. Not only do they stay turned over when you turn them, but you can be sure the insides won't be doughy like fat golf balls can be. I dipped them in a very thin glaze. I've already eaten 4!

This is the first time that I ever made doughnuts or deep fried ANYTHING.  I didn't have a thermometer so I was a little nervous about the oil temperature.  I found a couple tips:  put a wooden handle in the oil and when bubbles come off of it the oil is ready to go.  Make sure that you increase the temperature slowly so you find the minimum temp. at which this happens.  It took a little adjusting but it was fairly easy.  Also, test a cube of bread...it should brown in about 2 min.  I didn't use this method as it didn't seem very logical because bread is dry.    I followed the recipe almost exactly (I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the mace) and found it a little sticky to form into balls, but they tasted so good that I am hesitant to change anything.  Make sure that your ball sizes are close to a teaspoon or slightly smaller; they puff in the oil.  Basically, these were a cinch to make, quick, and tasted delicious!  Thanks for an easy recipe!!

I made these the other day when I had a craving for spice donuts.  I used cider instead of milk and they came out great.

These were so easy and great!  I made the dough the night before and left it in the fridge.  

I rolled the dough into small balls before frying, and they all came out looking uniform and perfect.  I coated some in cinnamon sugar, and some with the glaze from the Crispy Creamy Doughnuts (also on this website).  They were fantastic!

**NOTE**--I kept a close watch on the thermometer, and these cooked PERFECTLY at 370-375 degrees.  Thanks Mary for a great recipe!  Everyone loved them!!

I was looking for a drop dougnut recipe, in order to make apple fritters.  The dough was a bit too thick for a drop recipe.  Next time, I will add a bit more milk.  I chopped up two apples and mixed into this recipe for the apple fritters.  My family loved them.

Tasty! But didnt hold their shape well... I think I'll need to use more milk next time. But easy and fast to make for that donut craving! Here's a hint: if you're deep frying them on the stove top... make sure you do a couple test runs... because they can brown fast. I found MED-LOW was the best for cooking them.

So good!  Left out the mace, since I had none, and rolled them in cinnamon-sugar while still warm.  My kids and husband loved them.  Will definitely make again.

I liked the ones that I made a bit bigger.  The small ones had more crunch than soft inside.

This was fantastically easy even though I had never deep fried anything in my life.
I'm normally quite afraid of extremely hot oil and its volatility with temperature.  Even at 350 degrees, these balls cooked and browned beautifully.  Crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside.

I would just recommend a bit more flavor to the dough itself (if you're not going to coat in sugar).  This is a simple and quick recipe when I'm craving some donuts!

I only made one substitution--I did not have ground mace on hand, I used ground nutmeg instead. I used my small cookie scoop to pick up the dough and drop it into the hot oil, then a wooden skewer to flip them over to cook on all sides. Very simple for me. My family ate these just as fast as I could cook them!

Very good! Quick & easy.  Make sure to make your dough balls small for lighter fluffier donuts.

OMG...Yummy!  So simple (if you are used to frying) and really crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside.  Thanks for this one, I will certainly be adding it to my list of favorites.

This is my "go to" recipe for donuts.  I gave it 4 stars because it really needs a little more spice but other than that- fabulous.  I do add, after trying this several time, applesauce instead of oil...Makes me feel a little better .  they turn out great every time.  You can even coat with cinnamon sugar.  oh, and I  use a pampered chef melon baller to scoop and drop into the oil- perfect donuts every time.

Super easy recipe, and quick too. I will say they aren't nearly as good after they've cooled, so make only as many as you want to eat warm and fresh.

This was quick easy and good.  My kids liked being the shakers.  I used the Pampered Chef Cinnamon blen in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg and it was good, though next time I might put a bit less in the shaker bag.

We really liked these.  I like the spice in them and would even increase the amount within the donuts.  I like them plain (not rolled in sugar/cinnamon) but the kids liked them rolled in it.  Will make these again especially since they went together so quickly (no chilling required) and came out light and fluffy.

These were yummy. They are light and fluffy inside, crispy outside- almost like cake doughnut holes, but not quite. Very easy, minimal mess. I gently rolled the dough between my palms to give them better texture, and they still puffed up beautifully and held together nicely. Next time I will use a little less mace since it tends to be overpowering. The sugar coating would make these REALLY delicious with less cinnamon and a little cardamom added to it.

Delicious. The only change I made was using a pinch of nutmeg instead of mace, since I didn't have any.

These were pretty good.  I wasn't too thrilled with the spice portion of this donut but I would like to do it next time without spice and just have a plain donut with sugar and cinnamon on the outside.  It was very fluffy and light.  I used my ice cream scoop and then pushed it into the hot oil with a spoon.  They came out nice and round.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  A couple things:
1. I didn't have mace, so I used pumpkin pie spice.  Next time, I'll add more spice, because I just didn't get that much of a flavor.  
2. Like other reviewers said, make sure to make them small otherwise they will not cook all the way through.

Overall, a very good recipe, but it's still not "THE" recipe.  I'm still on the hunt, but for now, this one is the best one I've tried.

Thank you for this excellent recipe! It was quick, easy and tasty!  The kids (7,4,1) were able to help. Got a "Mom, those doughnuts were excellent" and a spontaneous hug from my 4 yr old son!!

I have made this before and really liked these! Made again today---My only complain is that some of them were not done in the middle (definately use teaspoon size when dropping in hot oil as suggested in recipe). But otherwise, great w/ cinn/sugar and pwdrd sugar! Yum!

This recipe is delicious and super easy. They are just like regular donut holes, but without the rising time!!
Give it a try!
