I've been making these since I saw the recipe featured in an issue of Seventeen, believe it or not. The only difference is their recipe called for a little lime juice. This is a great recipe for younger kids to learn how to cook either with parents or teenagers to make when they get home from school for an after-school snack.

Once you make tortilla chips this way, you won't go back to plain ol' chips.

These are so easy and fun to do! Plus they're much healthier for you than frying. I cut these with a pizza cutter to make them uniform. Instead of butter, I just sprayed them with butter flavored Pam, squeezed fresh lime juice over top then sprinkled the spices over them. I used 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of garlic since I didn't have garlic salt. I also added a bit of cayenne and smoked paprika for a little pizzaz. I baked these at 350 for 8 minutes turned them and baked for another 7 minutes. Everyone's oven is different so you may want to experiment with your first batch. I watched them closely during baking so they browned not burned. These went great with fresh salsa and guacamole.

Not bad! And sure beats the mess of frying them.  I brushed both sides with melted butter and I'm glad I did. They're really nicely flavored, with a great combination of spices.  I must have had some awfully thin tortillas though, because mine were browner than I would have liked, even at the minimum six minute baking time, so watch carefully!

These turned out better than I thought they would. Only complaint was a little too salty...next time I make these I will cut the garlic salt down to 1/2 tsp.

Very good.  I replaced the butter with olive oil.  We liked them because they are lowfat next to chips.

these weren't bad, a little on the salty side, I was hoping for a better result since its so much healthier than frying. But they were a little too chewy. My brother came over and not knowing I made them, asked me if my chips had gone stale.

these were very tastey and easy to make! out of everyone who tried these, my 2 year old was actually the biggest fan. i even made her some with cinnamon sugar topping instead of the chili powder mix, but she liked the chili ones better (go figure!). i'll be making these again, and have passed the recipe on to friends and family.

Instead of using butter I just sprayed with cooking spray.  These turn out great following the recipe.  Try brushing lime juice onto before baking for a different flavor, you have to use alot for the taste to come through.  I've already made these a few times and will definitely be making again!

I enjoyed these quite a bit.  I thought there would be more of a kick, but the flavor is very nice.  You could cut the garlic salt back a bit.  Especially if you don't want them to salty.

These were good, not my most favorite, and not sure if I'll make them again. I was very weary of them as I was making them, but had really wanted to try them.  I had made a chicken tortilla soup and they went well together.  My husband and 2 year old didn't like them at all.

Love them! I adore spicy food and these were fantastic. The first time I made these I used kosher salt, it didn't work at all.  But the 2nd time I used table salt and they were great.  They are really good with hummus.

Good. The texture is a little on the chewy side, not bad but more so than a regualr chip. The taste is good and they are easy to make.

Very tasty. Great way to use up leftover tortillas. Also these are very simple to prepare.
