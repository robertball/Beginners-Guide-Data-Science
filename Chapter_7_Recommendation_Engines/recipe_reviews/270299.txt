These cutlets tasted good but were a pain to make. I have a meat mallet but it took forever to flatten the pork, and even then, it wasn't quite thin enough. I ended up butterflying the remaining pieces (before pounding them out), which helped a lot.

Excellent. Only change made was using Gruyere cheese which probably wasn't a change. Dipped in applesauce. My wife dipped in honey mustard. Yum

I watched the video and used only half a tenderloin for our dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe except for a couple of things:  I used colby jack cheese and I used some rosemary and basil.  Be careful not to use too much of any herbs because ours was just a little over the top with flavor.  The best thing about this is that you can get it ready for cooking ahead of time, making it a good option for company.  I probably cooked the packet of meat about 15-20 minutes, and that was just right.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, Chef John!

Delightful! Only thing I'd do differently is add less cayenne.

I made 4 portions. I used this more as a "technique", as I changed the filling.  I used chopped, drained,  cooked bacon, minced onion,  garlic powder  (I forgot I had fresh garlic). S&P.
 I too was getting frustrated with the "flattening" part. It was well worth it though.  I did the breading as directed, and cooked in vegetable shortening.
They had a crisp crust,and were tender, AND juicy!   
I would suggest that everyone push past the frustration of the flattening, it is well worth it.

love the concept of flattening the meat and adding spices/cheeses/meats.  Made as directed, tho put in a 400 oven for 5 minutes after the first flip (cast iron pan) rather thn stovetop.  Looking forward to making this with different ingredients.  pork with sausage, mozzerella, oregano, tomoato saucde?  Great base!

Didnt care for the texture or taste. I used a marinated  pork loin  which  made the seasoning  to strong.

Hats off to Chef John!!  This was fantastic!  My family is made up of pansies who canâ€™t handle spice, so I cut down on the cayenne pepper.  The oil in the pan I was able to get away with using far less, closer to 1/8th of an inch for the health nuts in my family.

You really have to make sure that you pound the meat to the right thickness and width.  Need to get a better meat pounder.  Otherwise, excellent!  I used panko instead of bread crumbs and it was dee. . .lishus!

I made mine with fresh sage and mozzarella as that is what I had on hand.  Next time, I will add some apricot jam to the mustard for a touch of sweet.
