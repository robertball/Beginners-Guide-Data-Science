I love leeks! And the combo with the tart mustard greens was lovely. I made a simple baked chicken and added some mushrooms and garlic. Came out great!

Took a chance on a recipe with only 2 reviews because I had leeks and kale to use up. These are GOOD. They look appetizing when cooked and have a lightly sweet (from the carmelized leeks), lightly salty, and very flavorful taste. I liked them, my husband liked them, and most of my kids liked them. The recipe was ridiculously simple and fast and has a lot of nutrition. I will definitely make this as an easy, healthy side dish again.

My husband and I LOVE this dish! I always use kale and usually about a full cup of chicken consomme. I also give it a sprinkle of lemon juice after it's cooked which really brings it to life. It cooks quickly, but preparing the kale and leeks is actually pretty time consuming. UPDATE/SIDE NOTE: adding citrus (like lemon or lime juice) to your greens helps your body absorb the nutrients. =)

Lovely! I added a dash of turmeric and a little apple-cider vinegar,  but it would have been great anyway. The flovors of the butter, chicken stock, mustard greens and leeks blend perfectly.

Good basic recipe ... I used 3 leeks, 3 cups kale, and 4 garlic cloves. I mixed the veggies with cooked quinoa and some chopped walnuts, and added some leftover sauce from a restaurant meal (I think it was miso based). Added parm - delicious and a complete meal!

My first ever attempt at leeks or mustard greens and I enjoyed how it turned out. The greens have a very distinct flavor that the leeks mellow. If you like greens, this is a great recipe.

Yes, it was very good.  I added 2 fresh cloves of garlic, 6 oz of organic chicken broth and then a can of drained butter beans. Perfect.

I thought this was excellent, and SO quick and easy. The butter/broth/leeks combo worked really well with the greens, which ended up having a really nice texture. I'll definitely make this again!

Used red and green kale instead of mustard green. Didn’t have chicken broth so I used a little water instead. Changes I made in the end we’re adding pine nuts to give it a crunch and a drizzle of pomegranate balsamic-turned out absolutely amazing. Thanks for recipe!

I didn't know what a leek looked or tasted like before I made this.  I didn't have mustard greens, so with the suggestions of others, I used kale.  This was SO incredibly good!!  Thanks!

This will be my go to side dish for the next few months. I really liked the consistency. Great flavor. Super easy. I substituted kale and added some sliced mushrooms.

I think that the proportions I had from the farm basket ended up a little leek heavy. I'd definitely try this again, bit with vegetable broth vs chicken.

I used ghee instead of butter, local baby spinach, and seafood soup that I had made earlier instead of chicken stock. Simple and satisfying! I think it would work with any leafy vegetable. I'll make it again!

This turned out great!  I had a can of seasoned greens so I used those instead of fresh greens and  chicken broth. I had two 5oz ribeye steaks so I broiled them, sliced them up and topped 4 plates of greens with the meat.  Yummy!

Love Love Love!!!!!  This will be a regular at our table. We use WAY more parm cheese on each serving (or parm/asiago mix) and I always add  fresh minced garlic (multiple cloves).  We've played with proportions at times, due to having more greens and less leeks in the fridge - it has always turns out great.  Thank you so much Gardener98 for this recipe!

Fan-freakin-tastic! I've never cooked leeks before and never even eaten mustard greens and this was great! I've absolutely love it and have a new favorite veggie dish :) Also, I used just a small amount of virgin olive oil (maybe a teaspoon) in place of butter. Holy moly it's yummy!

I'm not a huge fan of greens but I'm trying to eat healthier.  This recipe helped me cook them but adding Thai Garlic Chili sauce as a condiment made this seriously good.  I'm happily chowing down.

Delicious, and super easy to make! The only hitch I had with this recipe was that I thought the ratio of leeks to greens was way off. The leeks I bought were pretty big (maybe 6" long after trimming, and 1.5" in diameter) and even three would have been, I thought, way too many. I ended up halving the amount of leeks, and doubling the mustard greens. I omitted the Parmesan (personal taste) and only gave the greens a tiny sprinkle of salt. They were amazingly delicious.

Yummy!  I did do some of the suggestions in the some of the other review - I added chopped garlic and a partially drained can of butter beans - and this will be a staple for my household.  Tabasco sauce brings the flavors out nicely.  The bonus is that this is a user-friendly recipe...  Quick and simple!  Yay!

Quick and excellent side dish. I didn't have any mustard greens either, so I added actual mustard to the chicken broth. I think next time I would add more, like 2 Tbs. It was great! Enjoy!
