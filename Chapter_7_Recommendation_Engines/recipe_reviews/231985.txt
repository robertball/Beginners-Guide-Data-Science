I added 1/2 tsp. allspice just because!  At first, I could not shape these into balls, and thought of spreading the gooey mixture onto a flat surface, and just nibble small bites of popcorn.  After a while, I went back and was able to shape the mixture into balls!  These are delicious!

This recipe didn't work that well for me, but that's because my marshmallows were really old, no fault of the recipe's. 4 stars because the molasses flavor was too strong.
