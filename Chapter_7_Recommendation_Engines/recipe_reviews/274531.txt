Both my husband and I really enjoyed this! So easy to make! I used all unsweetened almond milk in place of half-and-half, maple syrup in place of brown sugar, and left the raisins out. This allowed me to have a "plain" oatmeal to divide up for the week,  and top with whatever fruits, nuts, coconut, spices, etc that I wanted for the day. Adding in some vanilla extract and a pinch of salt adds a nice flavor too! I do find with most slow cooker oats, that they rarely need more than 5-6 hours on low heat to be done--more than that and they can stick and burn. They also benefit from being stirred every so often. If you do that, you end up with a delicious, and generous amount of, steel cut oats that are so incredibly easy to make! Thank you for the recipe--I will make this often!

This tasted good, creamy and not too sweet. The problem was a lot of it stuck to the sides and bottom of the Crock Pot. Some of it was burned a little. Mine cooked just 10 minutes shy of 8 hours. Maybe adding more water would help.
