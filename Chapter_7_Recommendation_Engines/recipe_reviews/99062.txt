A huge hit!  I made this for a large bbq that had a lot of other appetizers brought by others and this one was one of the most popular and disappeared quickly.  Instead of crackers, i baked pita bread cut into pieces (white and wheat) coated with olive oil and italian seasoning at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes until crispy (but not too much or they burn quickly)

I made this for a cook-off at work, and won!  It was super easy to make and really tasty.  I made breadsticks to go with it (pillsbury) and it was quite a hit.

Took this to a party and was a big hit. 

I added chopped turkey pepperoni to this -- people couldn't get enough on the roasted garlic Triscuits.

Quick and easy and hugely popular with my dinner club.  Went great with Triscuits (especially the Rosemary & Olive Oil variety)

Even though the directions didn't say where to put the grated cheese (I mixed it with the shredded mozz), I suppose it could have been mixed together with the cream cheese and sour cream.  Either way, this was a huge hit. Thanks to some other suggestions, I served it with the Roasted Garlic and Rosemary & Olive Oil triscuits.

This was good but a little bland. I forgot to buy the pepper so I chopped up some pepperoni, added garlic powder and used Emeril's Italian Essence along with the oregano. I also put a tablespoon of the pizza sauce in with the mixture. I garnished it with some jalapenos and pepperoni slices. It tasted much more flavorful this way. I would make it again doing it this way.

I used my own homemade marinara sauce and doubled both the red pepper and onion. I sauteed the onion, pepper and a few cloves of fresh minced garlic in a little EVOO before adding it to the rest of the dip ingredients. I threw all the ingredients for this in my small crockpot and left it for about three hours. For dipping, I took day old italian bread and rubbed it with roasted garlic and stuck it under the broiler just to crisp up a bit along with reduced fat Wheat Thins. The boys LOVED this--they ate every single bit of this in under a half hour. I think the homemade marinara is key to a really outstanding dip.

I didn't care for this - the combination of the creamy mixture and the pizza sauce did not work well for me. But, I'm giving it 5 stars because four people at the party I took it to asked for the recipe! I served it with homemade pita chips and the rosemary Triscuits as someone else suggested. It was really easy and quick to throw together, and it looks really pretty on a buffet table. Also easy to transport - I didn't worry about spilling it over in the car.

Ok, I made this for a party and I didn't even get any of it!  Everyone told me how great it was and I handed out the recipe to 3 people.  A nice alternative to the standard Taco Dip.  This dip goes great on the Garlic and Herb Townhouse Toppers.

This was very quick and simple to make and tasted really good.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that once it cooled off, it wasn't as tasty.  For a dip, it is wonderful served hot, just wish it stayed hot a little longer.  Either way, there was any left when I left the party!

This is a very easy versatile recipe. I used the whole block of cream cheese (8oz) instead of 6 and added two cloves of fresh pressed garlic to the cream cheese mixture. Everyone raved about how good it was. Thank you for sharing this reciped, I will definitely be making this again!

I add turkey pepperoni to spice it up... It's pretty good; a nice change from the normal spinach/artichoke or seven layer dip for parties.

I thought this dip was very good but not 5 star. I recommend using a smaller dish. Use a 9" pie plate or quiche dish if you're doubling the recipe.

I made this for a friend who can't cook.  He needed a quick snack for a Super Bowl party at work last year.  I sliced a couple of baguettes, drizzled the slices with EVOO, sprinkled them with some Italian spices, and toasted them slightly.  I omitted the onions and red peppers and added some pepperoni that I cooked slightly to render out some of that grease.  I cut the pepperoni into smaller pieces so everyone would get some with every bite.  He messaged me the following day requesting the recipe for some of his co-workers.  He said it was the first dish gone and said he'd have to learn to make it for future events.

This was pretty good and easy to make. It was a little bland, however. I think next time I would skip the sour cream, and add asiago cheese instead of so much mozzarella. Thanks!

This dip was absolutely incredible! I made it for a small super bowl party, and between 4 people we ate the entire dish of it. I would highly recommend it because it's also pretty simple and quick to make.

I made this recipe for New Years and it was the first thing eaten by the crowd.  I did not have green onion on hand so I shook in a bit of onion powder into the base.  I did have green pepper so I added some of that so it would have the nice red and green colour.  It was also simple to make so that is a HUGE bonus!  It will definitely be made again!

This was delicious, how could it not be?!  I was out of sour cream so I used nonfat yogurt which worked great.  I also substituted green pepper for red pepper and added chopped up pepperoni (works better than slices).  I think you could really add any toppings you like.

I made this recipe for a party and it was gone in less than 30 minutes. I served it with crackers and Pilsbury breadsticks. Make 2 servings because it goes quickly!

This dip was awesome! I had some doubts when I was making it up it turned out great. I added some salt and pepper to taste in the cream cheese mixture. I also sprinkled some cajun seasoning on top of the pizza sauce to add some kick. It was fantastic and super easy to make. My family ate the whole thing in minutes!!

I thought that this recipe had a lot of potential. But it did not quite go over at our BBQ. A few people said it was good. But I think that people were not expecting a cream cheese mixture in a pizza dip. Their loss. It was a good tasting recipe.

Took this to a party and it was a BIG hit. I thought it was pretty good. I think it would be fabulous with some chopped pepperoni or other pizza meats. Good stuff!

I made this for a Thanksgiving day appetizer.  It was devoured within minutes.  A big hit!  I'm told next time to make double.
