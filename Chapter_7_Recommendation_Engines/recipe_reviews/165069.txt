I made these for a family gathering a few weeks ago after reading the recipe on here. Everyone loved them. I only used the jalapeno pepper because that is all I had on hand at the time. We had another family gathering a few days ago and I was asked to make them again so this time I used the habanero also and they really liked them. I have a feeling that I will be making these for every family gathering now.

These were very good, and definitely a different twist to the deviled egg. I only used jalapeno peppers, only because I didn't have a habanero, but next time I will add that also. With the addition of that pepper, these are going to be HOT, because they had a strong zip to them just with the jalapeno. I did add a bit more mayo than suggested, and I think it made it too loose if you were going to pipe these through a tip. I will make these again, they are nice change from the classic deviled egg recipe of my own. Thanks for sharing (:

Delicious but I left out the jalapeno because we didn't have any.  The 1/4 habanero I used was plenty.  The little fiery bits are the perfect kick.
EDITED 1/15/09: I am addicted now and buy eggs just to make this.  I don't even share.  I am using more and more habanero each time and tried a little jalapeno this time.

I got this same recipe from a friend about a year ago-I had NEVER had a deviled egg before, I just didn't think I would like it. BUT-I tried one of these and was HOOKED! I still don't think I would like a regular plain deviled egg, but I buy eggs just to make these, they're FANTASTIC! I make it with the exact recipe as written, but use a spicy brown mustard instead of yellow.

These turned out really good and were a nice change from the ordinary ones. I de-seeded the jalapeno out of fear they'd be too hot but I should have left them in as the recipe called for. Thank you for this different variety and I will definitely makes these again!

Great change from the ordinary deviled egg recipes out there.  Nice kick from the jalapeno and habanero peppers.  P.S. I can't stand it when others rate a recipe and they omit a key ingredient and/or change it.  Seriously, would you bash a steak recipe if you omitted the steak?  Of course it will taste bland if you leave out one of the key ingredients.  For those of us who love heat, I'm going to try adding another jalapeno next time just to kick it up a bit more.  Thank you for the great recipe Eric.

I omitted the habanero pepper simply because after buying one, it disappeared.  Anyhow, that must be the important key to this recipe because I found it very bland.  I tried a little more paprika, that helped.  I think 1 tablespoon of mustard instead of 1 teaspoon would greatly improve this recipe.  This recipe did not impress me.  I won't be using this recipe in the future.

Didn't have any habaneros, so had to make it without- tasted very bland. ): Also, I didn't like the added taste of the mustard.

We LOVED these! I didn't have a habanero pepper, so I just used more jalapeno, but can't wait to try it w/ the habanero next time. These had great flavor and a nice spice to them. Will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was looking for something different from the 'usual' deviled egg recipe and this is perfect!
Didn't have habaneros, so used all jalapenos and added a little onion when I minced the peppers.
These were for a potluck at work and disappeared within minutes!

Very tasty! I used poblano rather than habenero and I seeded the jalepeno. The eggs were a big hit with all who tried them.

I never used to eat the yolk part of deviled eggs UNTIL NOW! These are great! They have a great kick to them. I was also pleased that the recipe didnt overdo the amount of mayo and mustard... its was just enough to add texture and a bit of taste without overpowering the whole yolk mix (like most other recipes do)! Thanks!!

Excellent recipe!  I went a slightly different approach with a jalapeno and serano pepper, without removing the seeds.  Everyone loved the taste and the heat, but definitely give them a heads up that they're spicy. Haha. The first "tester" was taken by surprise.  Also, keep an eye on the yolk/mayo ratio.  I had to add a little bit of mayo to reach the consistency I wanted, but that could have been my "gestimation" measurements... and not the recipe.

Great recipe! I've made it for my family and multiple parties and it's well-loved. The favorite variation is to add a pickled jalapeno slice on top.

Gave this 4 stars because I used the basic premise and veered due to what was in my kitchen.  But the concept makes for a really nice deviled egg.  I used canned green chilies and a teaspoon of cumin, with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and then cayenne pepper instead of paprika, and it was quite delightful.

It was good. I did add a few tweaks to the recipe. I used melted cream cheese, instead of mayo. And I also added 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper. Then, also dash of hot sauce and 3 stalks of green onion as garnish. It had a good flavor but it was still a bit dry and bland. Next time, I'm probably gonna try doubling on all the  yolk mixture ingredient quantities(except the yolks and peppers), also with my added customizations, plus 1 teaspoon of hot sauce(1 in the yolk mixture, and 1 as garnish on each egg) and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

Even with the jalapeno and habanero there is very little spice if all seeds are removed. For a kick, leave them in!

Substituted spicy brown mustard for yellow mustard.  Also added a bit of minced olives to be mixed in.

A favorite when ever the event calls for deviled eggs! I always make some with and without the jalapeños so those who can't take the heat can still enjoy. But the devil's own deviled eggs always go first.

This was really not that spicy, I was surprised given the title. It was good and they all got eaten but I think it could've used some more heat.

I make these pretty often and they are awesome! Always a big hit at every party! I have noticed that every batch varies in spiciness and that's because of the peppers. Some are just hotter than others I think. When they are too hot, I just add a little bit more mayo to cool them down a bit.

Thanks for the recipe Eric!!

I made it to the recipe except I only had two Jalapeno's. I used the whole peppers and included the seeds and all membranes. I also put a 1/2 slice of peppers on the top. They were a hit at Thanksgiving. I found them to be not as hot I was to be expected so next time I'll try using the Habanero.
