We really enjoyed this - however the 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise seemed like too much - I made the dressing using 1/2 of mayonnaise but kept all the other dressing ingredients the same.  It has just right.   I served this on top of toasted ciabatta rolls - like an open faced sandwich.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Fixed this for lunch today. I will considering a couple of changes. I love bacon but it got lost/overpowered by the various flavors. The next time, I will substitute pecans or walnuts and take out the bacon. Took the advise of the other reviews and went with 1/2 the mayo.. it was plenty. This salad has a little different flavor but refreshing! It's a keeper.

This Chicken Salad was a hit with my friends...I omitted the water chestnuts (simply because I don't like them) and I substituted one half of the mayo with salad dressing.  We used whole wheat croissants for sandwich bread.  Delicious!

My husband is very hard to cook for, but I decided to try some things that I like and he can eat something else.  We both loved this recipe and he has already asked me to prepare it again.

This was a fantastic, easy to make summer dish. The red grapes and the bacon were the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I just wish I had seen the reviews to use half of the mayo. One and a half cups of mayo was a bit excessive! Also, for all my bacon lovers out there, a few extra strips wouldn't hurt either :)

I have been making this salad for quite some time now and it is always a favorite with my husband. I don't change anything except sometimes I will add instead of grapesâ€¦apples or pineapple  and maybe some chopped pecans.

FANTABULOUS!!! Love this paired with the fresh broccoli salad by Nora. We also serve it with warmed whole grain pita wedges, which is complementary, and fun for the kiddos...thank you!

Fantastic!  Made a couple small subs based on what I have here... used dried cranberries in place of grapes and lemon juice instead of lime.  Like Baking Nana, I also cut the mayo in half and it was plenty.
