MOUTH WATERING GOODNESS:

I made Jane's Short Ribs exactly as directed (except I broiled the meat at the end for 10 mins instead of using the grill) and all I can say is WOW! These are the best tasting short ribs I have ever had and the recipe is easy to follow, easy make and even easier to eat. 

I served this wonderful meal with a nice tossed salad, homemade Au Gratin Potates, homeade buttermilk biscuits and homemade blueberry cheesecake. EVERYONE at the table couldn't stop raving about how delicious the dinner was.

So, if you are looking for fall off the bone deliciousness, do not hesitate, to make these ribs. Definitley a new favorite at our house. JOSH

These are PHENOMENAL!!!  We hosted family for dinner and I can 't count the number of times everyone, even finicky eaters, commented on how great these were.  The best part?  They're not at all labor intensive.  I prepared the marinade and placed the ribs and marinade in the crock pot in the frig overnight.  Then, in the morning, I simply turned on the crock pot and went to work.  When we were ready to eat, Mr. LTH grilled for   few moments to impart some grill marks/smoky flavor.  We don't keep horseradish on hand, so I simply left that out.  I couldn't find any beef ribs, so we used a mixture of pork spare ribs and boneless pork ribs.  While both were delicious, we all preferred the bone in ribs to the boneless ribs.  This WILL be a get together staple at the LTH house...nothing beats easy prep ahead of time, letting the slow cooker do the work, and very minimal work at service.  THANK YOU so much for this recipe, Cook'N'Gma!!!!

I didn't have time to marinate, so just subbed organic fire-roasted tomatoes for the tomato sauce, decreased the sugar due to dietary restriction. Threw everything into a pot, brought to a boil, then simmered for 2 hours.  Didn't put them on the grill--served straight from the pot.  Really tasty.
