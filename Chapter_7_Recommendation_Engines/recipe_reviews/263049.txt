Fantastic!  I don't normally add sugar to my food, but decided to go with it. This is SO good! I cut my florets a little smaller, so I ended only roasting for 20 mins + an additional 10.  The sugar/curry mixture add so much flavor and caramelizes nicely to give a nice crunch on some pieces, so the more your roast it, the better!  I used a sheet of parchment paper to make cleanup easier. This one's a keeper!

I doubled the seasoning since I used two small cauliflower heads and it came out delicious.  Only change I would make in the future is to reduce the salt a bit.

Easily my favorite way to eat cauliflower besides raw covered in hummus. I could serve this to guests and feel confident.
