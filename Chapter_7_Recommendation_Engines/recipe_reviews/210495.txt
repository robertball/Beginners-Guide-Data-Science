This jam tastes so much better than anything you can buy in the store, and the color is amazing. Hardest part is removing the seeds; the rest takes no time at all. I freeze this and use it all year. I pick the hips from wild bushes that grow along the waterfront near salt water.

Tastes as beautiful as it looks. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Because rosehips aren't ripe in the Pacific Northwest until late summer, this lovely jam is like one last sweet farewell before autumn closes in.

loved everything about it. the flavour is unique and delicious and everything you want for the time it takes for you to make it.  I sent the cooked rosehips through a food processor then strained them with panty hose (wierd trick I read somewhere that totally works) and squeezed all the pulp and juice through it.  I'd recommend this all day long.

So wonderful! I am enjoying this on rustic bread with walnut butter right now, and it is an absolute luxury.

It has a bright orangey-red color and a delicious fruity taste that you can't quite put your finger on...is it apricot? No, it's unique. Very tasty and something you can't just go out and buy.

No changes this time. Will be making again. Next time I will be doing a little experimenting with cranberries and rose hips.

I love this jam. It tastes like a jar full of summer-mowed lawns, flowers blooming, sun shining. The recipe is a bit confusing as you “add the water” and then add more water, but there are two ingredient items that are water, so noticing that helps. I halved the recipe and now I wish I hadn’t, since a small jar is going to a friend for Christmas.
