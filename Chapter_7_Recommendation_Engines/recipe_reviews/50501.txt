This hearty dish is great. I added white wine to the broth, and fresh spinach at the very end of the cooking time. I also added fresh parsley and cracked red pepper for more flavor. I'll make this dish again.

Yummy!!! (and good for you) The only thing I would do differently next time, would be: add half of the garlic, onion and celery closer to the end of cooking time. Their flavors got lost cooking so long (I also used pearled barley).
Good job!

Barley plus mushrooms equals tasty delicious.  I sauteed all the ingredients on the stove and then transferred everything to a baking dish and cooked it the rest of the way in the oven so I didn't have to keep watching and stirring.  I cooked it for an hour and fifteen minutes at 375 degrees and it came out perfectly.

This dish was very easy to put together.  I didn't have celery so I substituted carrots, which worked well.  I added 1/2 cup more barley, as 3 cups broth is too much for just 1/2 cup barley.  Next time I'm going to add sweet potatoes to this wonderful winter dish.

Love it!  I followed many of the other suggestions.  I cooked the barley first in chicken broth istead of veggie broth.  Then I set it aside and cooked the veggies and substitued water chesnuts for celery.  Once the veggies were done and I added them to the barley at the same time as the white beans.  Then I let them all warm up together and added some salt and pepper.  It was enjoyed by everyone at our table!

This is a really great recipe- the ultimate comfort food when it's cold outside.  Next time I will sub some of the broth with white wine. I exchanged celery for water chestnuts b/c I don't care for celery and b/c I wanted the extra crunch factor.  Be sure to watch the pot, tho.  Mine was done in less than 45 min and almost got stuck to the bottom!

I enjoyed this even more than I thought I would!  Was afraid it would be too "mushroom-y" but it's just fine.  Delicious.  Also tastes wonderful with the smallest amount of shredded fresh Parmesan on top.

Used only 2 cups of broth, 3 would've made it soupy.  And added a couple of large dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Very good.

With a bit of shredded cheese sprinkled on top, this was a totally toothsome, full meal.  I did add a bit of crusty bread.

This was pretty good.  I like celery but I didn't care for it in this recipe so next time I'll leave it out.  Perhaps spinich would be good. I also think I'll use butter in place of the olive oil to add more depth/richness to the flavor and I think brown rice would work as well in place of the barley.  Lots of options. Overall a recipe definitely worth keeping.

As a new vegetarian, I am trying all kinds of new dishes.  This was GREAT!!  I really love barley, so I am happy to have found this.  Like other reviewers, I substituted water chestnuts for the celery - perfect - and added broccoli.  I sprinkled some grated parmesan into the mix before I served it; it added a nice creaminess to the dish.  Thank you for a great recipe!

A very good dish I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth because I didn't have any vegetable broth. This would defintely do very well as a soup.

I thought I would like this better than I did.  I followed the recipe pretty much exact and I found it a bit bland.  I think I will try it again and read some of the other reviews for variations.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious - I prepared it as a side dish and made a few modifications.  Here are the changes I made: I omitted the beans, used green pepper instead of celery, chicken broth instead of veg broth, and added in some cut-up brussel sprouts.  I also added some extra spices - specifically powdered sage and ginger.  Delicious!!

This was much better than I thought it would be. The ingredients seem rather bland, but all together they are pretty tasty. I modified it a bit with more celery and onions. This one I surely recommend!!

I find this recipe to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes I make it and it tastes wonderful, and other times it is quite bland. Perhaps that has to do with what kind of mushrooms I use or how fresh they are. I use quick-cooking barley because that's all I could find at the store, and I highly recommend it. It only takes 10 minutes to cook. I think if I did cook it for as long as you would need to cook regular barley, the vegetables would be far too mushy for my taste. I use vegetable boullion cubes for the broth, and I usually make it stronger than the  boullion is supposed to be, which gives the dish more flavor.

This would be better as a side dish to a spicy meal, than a main dish on its own.

We had this with about 1 Tbs Hot Madras Curry Powder and 1/2 tsp Nutmeg.  We also used a cup of pearled barley, 1/2 cup Chardonnay, and 4 cups (1 box) vegetable broth.  Came out creamy and delicious in about 40 minutes!

This was awesome.  My picky family ate it right up, including my two year old son.  Definitely something to try and customize.  I added corn, but I'm sure you can throw whatever veggie you've got and it would be good.

Terrific!  I used the 'ingredients search' to use up what was in my fridge before leaving on vacation and found this recipe.  Added some carrots, used canned pinto beans and added a splash of white wine to the broth.  Added the celery later to preserve crunch.  Overall a very satisfying winter meal in a bowl.  Froze two meals for later.  Will make again.

I love this recipe. It's easy & nutritious. You won't miss the meat - it's a hearty meal that gets it's meaty flavour from the mushrooms. My fiance's daughter loves this so we make it quite often. I've made it with every type of mushroom and different broths. Our favourite is a beef flavoured broth because it really compliments the dish. I use a little bit more oil because the oil is a healthy one and the flavour is richer with more. Instead of prepared liquid broth, I use water and a powdered soup base (OXO or similar) to taste and add more water as needed. If you want it as a soup add more water if you want it thick and stew like add less and if you use the regular old fashioned barley, the starch from the barley will thicken it the more it boils and you won't get big sloppy barley. If it gets too thick add more water, if it's bland, add more broth powder or some steak type seasoning salt like Hy's. At the end I add lots of fresh spinach and stir it in to wilt. It's great without but we like to get greens into us as often as possible and the flavour goes nicely. Add a green salad and some warm french loaf and this is an economical and filling winter meal for family and guests. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Good!  It is woodsey, mushroomy...but not too much so.  After reading all of the reviews, I decided to change some things in order to avoid veggie mushiness and soupy barley:   
1) Sauteed onions, garlic, & celery until onions are caramelized; 
2) Added 1 cup barley (instead of 1/2), chicken broth (instead of veggie), mushrooms, chickpeas, and some spare spinach that I had on hand.  I also tossed in some teriyaki sauce and cayenne pepper;
4) Simmered for 60 minutes before everything was at a texture that I like.  I just kept tasting it every so often after 45 minutes until it was at a point that I liked.

i made this recipe, both with and without celery and without is the way to go.  It made the dish more consistant and delicious.  If you double recipe, add one can red and one can white kidney beans.  It makes the dish more appealing.

DELICIOUS! I had beech mushrooms fresh from the farmer’s market and was looking for a healthy dish for them. Most of the mushroom recipes on here include meat or are filled with cream soup/cheeses. I added a diced sweet potato, sauteeing it a bit first, and then followed the recipe as written. I did use quick cooking barley and cut the broth to 1 cup to accommodate. And I salted and peppered and added some cayenne for a bit of heat. Don’t overcook the veggy base, though: it can become too mushy if you do. Thanks for a great healthy dinner!

Very good. I did things a little out of order and it turned out great.  First I sauteed onions and garlic, then added the shrooms.  After that cooked I took it off the heat and did the rest.  At the very last minute I added the veggies with fresh spinach to the barley mixture.  That way nothing was overcooked.  I chopped up tomatoes and cheese and served it all in whole wheat tortillas.  Very tasty and so healthy!

I am looking for high fiber recipes with low cholesterol and saw this one and tried it.  It was very tasty.  I made a few changes: I used Quaker quick barley which cooks much faster.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and added a teaspoon+  of soy sauce to cooking liquid. I also added Mrs. Dash flavored  seasoning. I chopped a portabello mushroom which added a meaty flavor.  I also added toasted almonds for flavor and crunch texture. I left out the white beans and used this as a side for grilled salmon.  Even my son who is not into healthy foods tasted it and commented how good it was. I will use this recipe again.

This is a great GOOD CARB recipe.  Barley and beans are good carbs.  Great for diabetics!  You could add cubed chicken or turkey sausage for a one dish meal.  You could also add tomato juice along with chicken stock.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved it. I used dried beans instead of canned, and they seemed to soak up a lot of extra moisture. I also added cayenne and some other spices to add a little more flavor. Was great with crusty homemade wheat bread with monterrey jack cheese melted on top.

Excellent vegetarian dish. Extremely easy to make with a pleasant taste. Mine turned out more like a soup than anything, but it was still scrumptious.

I made a few changes -used chicken broth and red kidney beans - and it turned out very good.  It was a little soupy to begin with but after sitting off the heat for awhile it thickened up. It tasted mild and healthy.  It could easily be spiced up with your favorite seasonings.

This recipe was fantastic!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and made a couple of changes - I substituted water chestnuts for celery (the man doesn't like celery, but I wanted the crunch) and I used half vegetable broth/half chicken broth.  I also added some spinach at the end, thanks to another suggestion.  This was the first time I ever tried barley and I will definitely be making this recipe again.  I can't wait to try it with other additions, like carrots.  Fantastic recipe!

Wow! This is going to be a regular among my favorite recipes. Took others suggestions adding carrots. I substituted white beans with a can of red kidney beans (rinsed).  The color that they added maded it a very appealing dish.  Thanks!

GREAT! I followed others' suggestions to use different mushrooms (I used porcini and crimini). I omitted the celery for personal taste. For the beans I used half red kidney and half butter beans. This meal reminded me of a mushroom risotto so I added some parmasan cheese and WOW the flavor was fantastic. The whole family enjoyed it for Christmas. Thanks!

Came out great as a soup. (I'm not sure how you would go about eating this in a tortilla.) I added a green pepper, and might try a carrot next time.

I used one cup of barley instead of half a cup, I added a few carrots, and I used chicken broth, white wine, and soy sauce instead of just vegetable broth.  What a great recipe!  This is definitelty a keeper!

I wish I would've remembered to read the reviews before I made this! I gave it three stars because it was easy. This was definitely soupy! Need to either add more barley or cut back on the liquid unless you want it like a soup. Flavor was interesting but on the bland side. Another reviewer said she added soy sauce, I think I'll try that. Not sure I'll make this again as written - have to play with it a little.

This was OK, but on the bland side.  I did use natural barley, may have been better with pearl barley.  I used this and corn as side dishes and ended up mixing them together for more flavor and the next day put it on top of rice with the corn mixed in and some soy sauce and that was pretty good, but I wouldn't make this again.  Kids didn't like it, either.

Five star! This is truly comfort food. I used a whole box of chicken broth because I added extra vegetables. I added a handful of chopped Brussels sprouts, broccoli, a few stalks of asparagus, a whole pkg of mushrooms, and I had to use chic pease because I didn't have any white beans. I will make this again. Thank you.

Love it! I never have liked beans before, but recently I decided to start eating them as a healthy alternative to meat. I loved the beans in this dish. The mushrooms, beans and barley make the perfect combo. I actually added about 1/4 cup more barley and only two cups of broth and 1/2 cup of water. It turned out great!

I think this dish is great. I LOVE mushrooms, and I sometimes have cravings for barley (who knows why), so this dish is perfect for that. I use 1 cup of pearl barley instead of 1/2 cup. I also add cooked mushrooms and celery near the end--about 10 min before barley is done--so they do not lose their flavor and turn into mush. I like to put in tortilla with white cheese, but this is also good on its own.

I did enjoy this recipe.  Followed the recipe the first except my broth was frozen so I probably had more than the recipe called for which was perfect for me and I continue making it that way.  I've made it several times and use beef broth and toss in some oregano & a splash of hot sauce. Makes an excellent lunch!

I made this for dinner tonight, I am a vegetarian the rest of my family is not. My non-vegatarian husband ate three helpings! He loved it! The only change I made was to substitute zucchini for celery out of personal taste. I will make this again for sure and might take others suggestions and put spinach in it as well. Looking forward to leftovers  tomorrow.

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but was quite let down by the result. I followed it pretty much spot on, but added an extra cup of mushrooms. When it finished cooking, I thought it was very bland. To make it edible, at the last minute I added about 5 ounces of feta crumble, some fresh parsley and about a tablespoon of cracked red pepper. If I make this again, I think I'll add some goat cheese crumble and maybe some other fresh herbs.

This was just ok, but then I did not add the white beans. I think next time I will sauté the veggies and remove them, adding them back in twenty minutes before the barley is done. I would prefer a longer cooking time to get the barley done to my liking. Went along well with garlic butter (awesome recipe from this site) and toasted bread.

This turned out more flavorful than I expected. Instead of vegetable stock, I used Better Than Bouillion mushroom base. Mine turned out pretty thick like a stew or chili, probably because I used cooked dry Northern beans and added a little more than the recipe called for. This would probably be good with other veggies added in (carrots, etc). Will definitely make again.

Easy & healthy recipe. I added spinach and different types of mushrooms per other raters. However, I had to keep adding (a lot of) water as the ingredients seem to suck it up.  Also, my barley looked bloated and scary.  Good enough for home eating but I'd be too embarrassed to serve to guests.  The water and barley issues could be my own fault.  My husband liked it though and that's all that matters.

Wonderful dish, and very easy to make.  I used a mix of fresh shitake, crimini, portabello and oyster mushrooms to amp up the mushroom flavor.  This worked really well.  I substituted chicken stock for the veggie stock, and added fresh parsley, cracked red pepper flakes, chopped carrot and a splash of white wine, and omitted the celery.  I also added salt and ground pepper to taste, and served with a bit of shaved parmesan on top as it very closely resembles mushroom risotto in flavor and texture.  Awesome!

It was okay - I don't know which was the problem... not enough barley or too much broth.

Loved this recipe.  Used hulled barley (our favorite), and added a hunan chili pepper to it.  Definitely a meal we will have again and again.

This is an awesome recipe.  I will sometimes add more vegetable broth than called for and let it simmer down longer for even more flavor.  My husband can't get enough of this one.  Great veggie recipe.

A great tasting dish when some changes are made. Like others have suggested, it needs 1 cup barley not 1/2 cup (i used pearl). The barley only takes about 1/2 hour to cook i found. I added a capsicum, some corn and soy sauce and left out the beans. Yum yum and definately very tasty. I might add carrot next time too!

I added salt to this, as I thought it was a little bland.  I appreciated how easy it was to make such a healthy dish, though.  And it was very easy to double the recipe and freeze half for another time.

As I was cooking it I asked people to taste it as it tasted too bland for me.  I ended up adding a small amount of crushed red pepper flakes and cutting the mushrooms in half.  In the end no one ate more than 2 spoonfulls.  Said it was too "mushroomy". 

Went in the trash.

Excellent, robust, hearty meal.  Like others suggested, I used chicken broth in place of veggie broth.  I used two cups of barley and had plenty of leftovers that froze very well.  I also doubled the garlic (we're garlic lovers) and used vidalia onion.  This is a keeper.

The first time I made this I made it as written and it was really good.  Good texture, and subtle flavors and certainly filling.  The second time I made it I threw in some leftover pork roast and a little soy sauce and WOW! The kids ate every last bit. This is now a part of our regular meal rotation.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Pretty good. 
I used Chicken Stock instead and also added Wheat Berries (turned out kind of crunchy!) and brocolli.

Great recipe! I followed the directions exactly, except added a couple of cubes of vegetable broth...it was fantastic. Just a nice, super-hardy and healthy dish...if you like beans and barley...vegetables...this is a good one.

I did add a little bit of salt and pepper, but I used lower sodium vegetable broth. I also added a touch of white cooking wine, although red might have been good, as well.

I just set this up to simmer. I know it will be good. Every single ingredient is one of my favorites. The only modifications I made were the addition of salt, pepper, and dried minced onion before the simmer, and since organic chicken broth is half the price of o. veggie broth, I had to go with that. I'm not a true vegetarian anyway. Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe.

There was too much water.  I would cut it back to 2 or 2.5 cups.  I also extended the cooking time to 75minutes.  This ended up being a thick soup for us.  The flavor was good.

I loved the recipe. I used a white wine and herb broth that added a different flavor. I also used 5 minute barley that reduced the cooking time by 45 minutes.  Great recipe that I will definitely try again, and probably add more barley.

This was nice and hearty. I made it with dried red lentils instead of beans, and it added a nice texture. I also added sea salt and pepper. I'll try it next time with the white beans.

Wonderful taste and easy to make.  I added more veggie broth and made a soup out of it.  Turned out great and my family loved it.  Next time I will use the amount of broth indicated in the recipe and see how we all like it.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because it you can work with it otherwise it would get a 3.  I doubled the barley which for me was a mistake.  It was very bland.  I would also omit the beans unless you really want them!  I also left out the celery because of allergy.  This may have changed the taste a bit. You can get creative with this and try the red peppers etc.

As a couple of other reviewers suggested, I added a quarter of a Red Bell pepper chopped, a teaspoon of red chilli flakes and one cup of barley. Towards the end I added a swirl of soy sauce and voila it was delicious, even my meat eating boyfriend liked it. High praise indeed.

I liked it, my fiance absolutely hated it. It is pretty bland, but I like the taste of barley.

Very nice recipe. I think if you add more broth, you could make a very nice soup out of this.

Much more like a soup than a side dish or anything you could wrap a tortilla around--but delicious nonetheless.  It pleased my picky flatmate, which is no easy feat.  I did add about a cup of sliced red bell pepper to increase the health benefits.

Next time, I'll lessen the black pepper to 1 tsp or less (it was a little too spicy for me). Otherwise, this was an excellent recipe my entire family loved!

Mine came out a little mushy and I would like to add more celery next time. I think it would have tasted better if I had NOT used low-sodium broth!

We really liked this one.  It seemed like it would be plain, but we used a veggie boullion powder from the asian food store that gave it some good kick!

Added some quinoa and couscous in place of some of the barley, and some more onions as well.  Had it wrapped up in homemade cornmeal crepes... was delicious!  Will definitely make again soon!

second time making this recipe, i love it, very woodsy.  the first time i made it hoping to toss it into tortillas, but im not sure how that would be possible; it's more like risotto, soup even (if you add more water, which im doing this time).  no changes are really needed for the recipe, but i keep out the beans because they arent needed, add more onions because i love onions, that is all.

I made this recipe on Thanksgiving amongst my meat-eating wife and sister-in-law.  It was savory and fast.  The combination of grain and mushrooms reminded me of a risotto recipe I used to make.  Next time, I'll add a green vegetable like asparagus.

I added some chopped carrots along with celery & onions.  Also, wrapped in a tortilla with cheese (as suggested) & froze the tortillas.  Made a very tasty, quick, & healthy dinner later on.

My husband found this dish to be rather bland. I think it could be spiced up with some jalapeno or a vegetable -- green pepper, broccoli, or ??  Definitely has potential to be a staple...

I give this recipe only a four because while I really loved it the first day I made it, it just wasn't very good as leftovers. Maybe it's just me. It was definitely good the first night. Worth it. Oh, and I put it in a tortilla with cheese as suggested. Delicious.

Quite tasty, though a bit salty. The dish is all one color, though a nice brown, it's somewhat unappealing. I used a variety of fresh mushrooms which I think made it more visually intereting.
