This was really good.  I modified it a little...used 1/2 cup of wild rice, 3.5 cups of vegetable broth (you absolutely need more than 1 cup of liquid or your rice will burn), 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms, 1 cup chopped carrots, 1 Tbs. garlic, 1/8 teaspoon ground thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. I didn't add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the cooking rice because there was enough sodium in the broth.  Instead of sauteing the vegetables in butter, I cooked them over low-med heat in a COVERED saucepan with a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil until tender.  PERFECT.

Too much salt!!!  Eliminate the 2 teaspoons and it is wonderful.  Also use 4 cups of condensed milk, one cup chicken stock -- adds great texture.

This was amazingly good!! I did add a tsp of minced garlic to the onion/butter saute.  Right before I added the flour, I added a splash of white wine and let it simmer for 1 min. I then used 1 can of pre-cooked wild rice (drained & rinsed), used only 1/2 tsp of salt, and added 2 chicken breasts, cooked and cubed small. Finally, I only needed 4c of milk.  I think this could used some shredded carrots for color but a wonderful tasting soup that everyone loved. I highly recommend this soup and I'll be sure to make it many times to come! Thanks a bunch Holly.

This soup is excellent. I cooked some carrots along with the onions and celery, and added some cut-up cooked chicken with the wild rice near the end of cooking. My kids love this soup.

Preparing for a ski trip with my family my brother said longingly 'Too bad we don't know how to make that wild rice soup' refering the the soup made by a woman we once knew (and can no longer ask). I had thought it was from 'joy of cooking' but it wasn't and decided to search for it. Finding this recipe. It was perfect. I ended up using canned wild rice, 2 cups worth because my own wild rice burned (use the directions on the bag for the wild rice) and I used an extra tablespoon of flour and only 4 cups of water. It froze wonderfully and even my extremely picky boyfriend loved it and father told me to 'make sure we keep that recipe'. I think next time I'll try substituting half & half for half of the milk, as I remember that that is how I'd been told it was made before.

This was just ok for me.  My husband said it deserves a 4 but I think I have to say 3.  It didn't taste bad; it was just kind of boring.  The flavor of the milk completely overpowered everything else.  I love cream soups and I LOVE wild rice but I couldn't even really taste the flavor of the rice because the milk took over everything.  I added carrots, garlic and mushrooms to the veggies at the beginning.  If I were to make this again, I would replace half the milk with vegetable broth to cut the milk taste and add some flavor.  Also agree that the salt quantity is too high-i did reduce that.

As a side note, the leftover soup thickened up considerably and created kind of a creamy veggie rice-nice base/side for our leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

This soup was really good and easy to make!  My dad said that it needed chicken in it, so the next time I made it, I added cooked chicken pieces to it.  It was even better!  I love this soup!

Very, very good! I am always looking for a good soup or chowder recipe, and this one always pleases. I substituted a bit of cream in place of milk to make it a touch creamier. This is a keeper!

YUM! I halved the celery & added shredded carrots. I also added about 4 tablespoons of flour, and a clove of minced garlic. Having never made a cream-based soup before, I realized that the soup ahd to almost-boil in order to thicken. Very, very good recipe!

Excellent soup, once I made a few changes.  With just milk, it would be bland.  I used 3/4 c wild rice, added chopped carrots, halved the milk and substituted chicken broth.  Yummy!  Oh- and because we had leftover Christmas ham, I diced some up (about 2 cups) and added it to the soup.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

Good soup, but way too much salt added in the second part of the recipe.  Would recommend only using 1/2 tsp of salt, not the 2tsp. that the recipe calls for. Otherwise soup was tasty.

I liked the recipe. A little less peper maybe. Also I believe step number 2 should instruct people to use a pan to cook the vegetables seperately because the cooked rice isn't supposed to be added until the end.

Absolutely fantastic but i did alter it. I used a pkg mix of Wild Rice and Long Grain, and added most of that (cooked) to the rest of the recipe, instead of the wild rice (that was all i had on hand at the time)   It was so easy and so incredibly good, that i've made it several times since.  It even freezes well. It's so creamy, and so full of flavor.
