This recipe was great!  I used my leftover "cranberry sauce extraordinaire" from this website and it was great!  I made it for a group of friends and they loved how I used up the extra cranberry "sauce" from Thanksgiving!  The pecans in the cranberry mixture really added something and I also put a crumb mixture on top (1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 Tbsp melted butter, 1tsp cinnamon).  After I put the topping on the cake I realized I had forgotten to swirl the cranberry/cake mixture. So, I just gently did it anyway and the crumb topping ended up incorporated into the cake which even made it better!  I would definitely make this again and swirl after adding the crumb top.  Very moist and great taste.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe was wonderful.  I even turned it into a low fat dessert.  I substituted 1/2 sugar with Splenda, used light margarine, and fat free sour cream.  It turned out great!!!

This is very tasty.  I had leftover homemade cranberry sauce, so I used that in the bread.  Very moist and flavorful.  Based on other reviews I increased the ingredients by 50% so I could fill the entire bundt pan. It has a nice presentation and a nice mild flavor.  Will definitely make again!

What a great cake!  Moist and delicious with just the right balance of tartness and sweetness.  I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and used freshly made cranberry sauce instead of canned. Perfect for the holidays and all year round.

We have been baking this cake for 40 years. Some hints: Make sure your baking powder is fresh. Try not to get the cranberry sauce close to the edge of the pan - it sticks like glue. If you don't have a non-stick pan, line the bottom with waxed paper. Make an icing with confectioner's sugar, almond extract and a little milk and drizzle it over the top. We always get rave reviews for this cake.

This basically was like just cake. It definetly needs more cranberry to it and a streusal. I think I'll tweak the recipe a bit and add orange zest some orange juice and make a streusal on top and swirled in with lots more cranberries. I may even just add fresh whole cranberries to it. The cake moistness was right on. Thumbs up for that!

Delicious!  However, mine took a lot less time to bake than stated.  I used a 10 cup bundt ban.  It could be that the pan is thin, but overall I think it was done in about 40 minutes (possibly even 45).  I used the toothpick test and it showed it done that early.  I did use the canned whole cranberry sauce, while many other reviewed used homemade sauce. One suggestion is to take the canned sauce, put in a bowl and mush it up really well.  This helps make it easier to put in the batter without it touching the sides of the pan.  I just love the tang of the sauce in this cake.  Everyone here loved it, even picky daughter and picky grandma!

It made a small bundt cake - needed more batter or something. Not sure if we will make it again. It was good ...but not great.  Like, I'm not going to lie in bed and think "oh that was soooo good." No, it's almost forgettable.  And this coming from someone who just loves cranberries.

I had leftover whole berry cranberry from Thanksgiving so this was perfect recipe to use up. I goofed (this was 5am-half-asleep) and didn't swirl the cranberry into batter nor did I layer it thrice. I spread first layer of batter then dumped cranberry sauce then covered with rest of batter. I thought it came out GREAT anyway. I also found out I only had half cup of sour cream. I will be more prepared next time. Overall, it's SO good.

This was good, but nothing great. It was more of a regular cake to me than a coffee cake.  I did make a few alterations. I ran out of sour cream, so did 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c yogart. Worked good.  I also added a sugar crumble on top (a MUST have) that another reviewer suggested.

The cake is moist and relatively easy to make, but cranberry sauce does not add anything to the flavor or texture and is completely overpowered by the almond extract. The result is just so-so. It feels like the cake lacks something... Maybe some nuts or dried cranberries would add more flavor and texture. Don't think I will be making it again.

When I turned the bundt pan upside, the cake slipped out easily.  But it looked like a volcano with cranberry magma gushing out onto my kitchen counter.

I haven't tasted it yet - it smelled good while it was baking.  But muffins might be a better idea!

This was great! I made in an 8x8 pan, not enough for a bundt pan. I suggest using the whole 14oz can of cranberries. Used 3/4 white flour and 1/4 whole wheat.

Very moist, tasty cake and not too sweet. Next time I think I would only do one layer of batter, then cranberry sauce, then batter again, as there is not a lot of batter. I will make again. It would be good with a streusal swirl too.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I loved how moist it was.  I made it in a bundt pan, and put a cream cheese glaze to finish it.  I also used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Everyone raved.  I think that any fruit filling could replace the cranberry if you wanted to shake it up.  Blueberry pie filling would do nicely!

I did not follow the exact recipe. - I used half whole wheat flour,
reduced the sugar by 25%  and used lingonberry rather than cranberrry.  Also I did not go to the trouble of  "Adding the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream or yogurt to the butter mixture" Additionally it was fully cooked at 42 minutes.  It was Okay.  I think whole cranberrries  + some orange zest would make an improvement.

I used the whole can of wholeberry sauce.  You'd think it would scream "Cranberry," but they were more an afterthought on an average cake.  I don't like leaving a negative review, rarely do.  I wonder if the recipe got changed along the way.

I didn't have cranberry sauce so I substituted a can of cherry pie filling and it was delicious.  Next time I will use the entire can to add even more flavor.  I glazed it with vanilla glaze and it turned out great!
