If I was rating it strictly for myself, I would give it one star. I thought the filling was unattractive and tasted overly sweet yet plain. Everyone else that tasted it (I made two) thought it was GREAT. Go figure.

Very good and very easy.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture before I filled the crust.  Be warned...it is very sweet.

I made this pie along side "Raisin Pie III" and this was no where near as good. There was not enough filling and the pie was unattractive, it did not hold together well at all. Appeared more clumpy. It was definitely easy to make but ended up being too sweet for me.
