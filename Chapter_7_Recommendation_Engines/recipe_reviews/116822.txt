This is an easy and delicious Chinese meal! It's a shame that so many people had a bit of trouble with it, complaining of it being "bland". So, I changed it just a bit (sorry) and it came out really good. First, instead of tossing the pork in paprika, I tossed it in flour MIXED with paprika AND garlic powder. I then browned it in a bit of oil. For the sauce, I used rice wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar as it's sweeter and not as strong. I doubled the brown sugar and used 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce and added at least 3 Tbsp. of ketchup. Most sweet and sour sauces call for ketchup and this addition made a big difference when added to the pineapple juice. My next addition was mainly to address the "blandness". I added a Tbsp. of hoisin sauce and 2 tsp. of chili-garlic sauce to give it a little heat and some pizzaz. I also made sure I tasted it before I added the pork - if it doesn't taste good (sweet n sour) before it starts cooking it's not gonna turn out good in the end. I let that cook on low for 4 hours. While that was cooking I cut an onion, a couple of carrots, and red & green peppers into strips and fried them until tender crisp. I added the veggies and pineapple to the crock pot and cooked for another 2 hours on low. The sauce thickened up on it's own due to the flour mixture coming off the pork. It smelled heavenly, the pork was tender - no disappearing veggies. I served it over white rice topped with toasted sesame seeds and thin sliced green onion - YUM!

This is one of the very best things I have ever cooked! Outstanding! I substituted carrots for the green peppers as we don't care for those. The meat was ever so tender, and the sauce was perfect. Our kids are 5 and 7 and they gobbled up two servings each, served over Basmati rice.

Made this for my husband  last night. We both enjoyed it and will make again but I don't think it's a 5 star recipe. Made as directed. When I added the corn starch, it really didn't thicken up the sauce like I hoped.

I love Chinese food, and crock-pot cooking. This was really good. I read other comments about fall-apart meat and runny and vinegar-dominated sauce and made a few changes. I tossed my pork with flour before browning it. I only used half the vinegar and added a squirt of ketchup (other S&S recipes have included this). I waited to add the onions until about 3 hours before mealtime -and I added carrot and yellow pepper. Then about 30 minutes before mealtime, I added the pineapple and some baby corn. My cornstarch mixture included an extra Tb of cornstarch and the sauce turned out really well, there jsut wasn't enough of it for my taste. I also served it with brown rice. Will make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't find it to be as bland as other reviews made it sound - but my complaint is that is tasted of 100% straight vinegar! A 1/4 cup was way too much!

I am sorry I didn't like this recipe at all. ALthough the pork was tender, it was very bland to me. I followed the recipe exactly, and it didn't have hardly any flavor at all. The sauce didn't thicken at all I even added more cornstarch at the end, and that didn't help. My husband agreed with me. I just don't think the slow cooker was the way to go for sweet and sour pork. Won't make this one again.

This was really good.  I didn't have any peppers so I added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies about 2 hours before it was finished cooking.  My whole family enjoyed it, including my picky ones! Thanks for the recipe :)

I agree with the person who said to omit the onions and green peppers from the crock pot and stir fry them separately. They completely dissolve in the slow cooker and the greeen peppers literally disintegrate.

I made this this weekend for family and while I thought it had a good taste, it wasn't fantastic as I had wished for. The sauce needs something to make it more tangy but I don't know what it is.

This recipe was really great!  I have a love affair with my crockpot and just about any meal comes out well in there!  I followed the instructions (which were a little more detailed for slowcooking)but my slices of tenderloin, as I thought it would, shredded and didn't chunk the way that the picture showed.  However, the taste was WONDERFUL.  I'd give this meal an A+ if it weren't for the pre-cooking that you have to do before hand.  Either way, I think you're family will enjoy this dish!

This was very good! We very much enjoyed it. I omitted the salt; it was definitely salty enough. If I had time on a particular day I think I would make the recipe stir-fry style, as the vegetables would probably stay crisper. But for a day when I have to be gone during the day this is an excellent way to vary the usual crockpot repertoire, and the taste is very yummy!

Husband thought the recipe was too greasy.  Kids are too picky.  I am the only one who enjoyed this recipe and I have to say the meat was so tasty and tender.  I would make it again but maybe when we have company because there's only so much I can eat of this large meal.

It was ok. I felt it was pretty good mixed in with the rice in a gumbo-like consistency, like one of the other reviewers said. But for a crockpot recipe, it required more up-front prep than I would have liked. I throw together crockpot recipes first thing in the morning before work, and I really prefer dump-and-go recipes.  I didn't feel the flavor or consistency of this dish made up for the extra work.

Also, while it had kind of a sweet-and-sour flavor, it was nothing like a typical Chinese sweet-and-sour flavor. I think that's to be expected since it's not really a Chinese recipe, but since I was hoping more for that flavor, I wanted to point it out. :-)

Nevertheless, I'm going to give it another go, but I'll skip the browning step (the pork that I've cooked in the slow cooker without pre-cooking is always about the same texture this was, anyway) and add in some chili oil to see if that enhances the flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I left the peppers and onions out until the last hour or so to avoid them turning to mush... this turned out to be pretty good. Left me wanting more veggies in it but that can be easily done next time. Enjoyable.

Other reviewers were right in that the vegetables get VERY mushy (almost non-existant) and it is pretty bland overall. Wont make it again.

This was good but with the following changes:  double the sauce, sprinkle with garlic powder, put the peppers & onions towards the end of cook time. It took more than 30 minutes to thicken with cornstarch...but definitely a keeper for our family!

Easy, yes -- good, sorry but no.  Not the sweet n sour sauce you're thinking of.  After slow cooking, it REALLY grabs the vinegar flavor.  Plus - like other reviewers have said, it needed ketchup, but even that didn't seem quite right.  And I seem to have bad luck w/pork in the crock pot getting way too dry.  All in all, a waste of some pork loin since only I ate it, and I couldn't eat much.  Excited at the idea, but it just didn't come together for me.

This reciepe was very easy, and tasted pretty good. I didn't cook it in a slow cooker, which may have made a difference in taste. I would have liked a stronger flavor, but my family LOVED it. I cooked it in the oven, and not the slow cooker. I cooked it for only 2 hrs on 350. I will for sure be making this one again!

I love this recipe! It's so easy. Instead of the Paprika, I used Barbeque seasoning which is mostly paprika anyway. It turned out great!!! Thanks!

This was very good! I was a little hesitant on the paprika step, but it was very good. The only change I will make next time ... put the green pepper in during the last 30 minutes when I do the cornstarch & pineapple step that way they will be somewhat firm & still have their colour. Great recipe for the slow cooker.

Sooo good.  I actually doubled the recipe and after I browned the pork on the stove-top, I put 1/2 the recipe in a freezer bag to throw in the crockpot on a later date.  I didn't have any worchestire and it's still super good.  I did add a little more sugar just to my own liking.  I'll make this again.

read over all the suggestions and went with a little less vineger, added carrots and added them along with onion and pepper for the last hour. it was great we really enjoyed it. my only negative is it takes a little longer to prep than i liked, but in the end is worth it.

The entire family ate without complaints.  Myself, found a little bland, and it did have a vinegar aftertaste.

It had great flavor, however the pork seemed a bit overcooked.  I would do it again, but adjust the time

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I was hoping for a stronger 'sweet n sour' taste, but it tasted quite greasy.  I followed the exact recipe given.  Maybe if I made some of the changes, it would have helped.

Made this one last night and it was very well worth it. I stuck to the recipe with the minor exceptions: Instead of putting the paprika and pork in the bag, I put the cut up pork in a bowl and sprinkled and mixed the meat with the paprika to my desire. Putting it together in the bag seemed to coat the meat too much. I also added red bell pepper. I read the post where the vegetbles turned to mush in the crock; If that happens you probably overcooked them. I have an older Rival(R) crock with just low & high settings. I did this on high, carefully keeping an eye onthe veggies and stirring occasionally. It was done in about 4 hours. Good Recipe! Thanks!

We enjoyed this recipe with a few modifications.  For a little added zip, I added one tablespoon of asian hot chili sauce.  I didn't have any cornstarch so substituted 1/2 can of tomato paste instead.  It turned out good.  Will definitely make it again.

We liked this a lot and will make it again. We made it all up the night before so I could just plug in and go the next morning, and guess who forgot to get crock pot out of fridge and turn on.  I ended up cooking this in large pot on stove top, boiling long enough to make sure pork was cooked through.  Sauce was tasty and I thought well-balanced. Not too sour or too sweet, and definately not bland.  Perhaps the fact that it marinated all day helped??  We followed other reviews and coated pork in a flour, garlic salt, and paprika mix instead of paprika alone.  We also added extra 2 Tbsp brown sugar and squirt of ketchup, then served over white rice.

i read some of the reviews that found this dish a little bland. i kind of zest up the recipe with another favorite recipe of mine and it turned out delicious. in the large bag along with the paprika add one tbsp each of soy sauce, salt & pepper. then cook as directed. i also added a few additional things to the  slow cooker along with the pineapple juice, green pepper, (rice vinegar-not cider vinegar) brown sugar, worcestershire sauce and salt. i also add 4-6 garlic cloves (thinnly slices) i leave out the onion and add 1/2 cup white part of scallions, 1/4 c ketchup 4 tsp sugar and a 1/2 c water. mix well fallow additional directions and this recipe is perfection! give it a try :)

This is a really good recipe.  I didn't have any peppers and used the recipe in the recalculated for 2 area.  It was still good.    With only two of us at home now, I often take the calculator and make it for two!

I enjoyed this!  I followed the recipe withouth the peppers.  To get the sauce thick, drain the meat and put the juice in a seperate pan and add 3 tbls of flour with 1/3 water and bring to a boil. Once it does, add the meat to the slow cooker and add the sauce and stir.  YUMMY!

Meat was very dry, it did not thicken and was bland.  My fiance said this was good but I didn't like it, I won't be making this again.  Not to mention the prep time was an hour!  Took up my whole morning before I went to work!

Delicious!!  This is a great recipe and one that  will definitely make again and probably change here and there along the way. Simply based on what was in my fridge I used red peppers instead of green, and threw in some celery.  I also cooked this in the oven instead of the slow cooker at 350 degrees for two hours and it turned out perfect.

The recipe is easy to make. However, it lacks in the seasoning department. I felt that the pork in the crockpot turned out soft, yet tasteless. I don't usually just season pork with just paprika. I tasted more pineapple and sugar and bland pork than anything.  The onion gave the sauce a strong taste, so i took some out. Had no green peppers.    I usually don't have goodluck with crockpots.

Made this for my friends and me, tasted great, although it turned into more of a stew then sweet and sour pork. Sauce never was able to condense, and  I added some saracha to give it a little kick.

This recipe was lacking in so many areas. It smelled wonderful but it needed about 3 times as much sauce as it produced. The meat was very tender but it felt almost gritty. If there had been either more pineapple juice and vinegar or maybe some water during the slow cooking process this recipe would have been much better.

It didn't work out for me.  The mixture was runny and had more of a pot roast flavor than sweet and sour.

Tried this tonight for the first time and turned out pretty good. I thought it needed a little more spice so I added a few dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce for a little zing. Next time will add a little red pepper flakes in the begining for that extra heat! As for leftovers, I will try to freeze them for another night. Overall, my family liked it so will attempt again.

Super easy to make, but not impressed with this recipe.  It didn't thicken, I think 6 - 8 hours is too long, and the sweetnsour taste gets lost.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it and let it cook for about 5 hours in the crock pot, and everyone that ate it had seconds.  I will be making this again!

While my kids found this meal to be "OK" I thought that it was awfully bland. And nothing I did would thicken the juices. Would not make again.

It smelled amazing when it was cooking, but for the life of me I can't figure out why it needed to cook for so long.  The veggies were absolute mush.  If we do it again I think we won't add the veggies until the very end.  This was the first thing I have made that none of the leftovers were eaten.

I thought this was okay, it didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting. I probably won't make it again.
