As the recipe submitter suggested, I used crushed ice instead of the water because I wanted a slushy drink. Just a suggestion, you may need to adjust the sugar depending on how sweet your watermelon is. Mine wasn't very sweet, so making this drink out of it was a perfect way to use it.

Just a note: it should actually serve 2 people even though it says 4, but other than that, liked it!

Although I like watermelon, I did not enjoy this drink. Initial taste was not flavorful enough until I doubled the watermelon. With that, and the sweetener, it's kind of okay now. Sorry; it just doesn't work well with my taste buds.
