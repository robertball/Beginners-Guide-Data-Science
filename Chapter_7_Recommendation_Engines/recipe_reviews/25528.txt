I tried this recipe for a church finger food luncheon. It was well received and several people asked for the recipe. I also had a couple of people say they don't care for spinach but heard others saying how good they were so they tried them and they loved them too. I did follow several of the suggestions offered by other members. I thawed and squeezed dry the spinach before beginning.  I cut the Italian bread crumbs to 1 cup. I used one med. yellow onion (instead of the green onions) and 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauteed those in the 1/2 cup butter. I also took another recommendation and added about 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon.
I made them no larger than 1 inch and they took every bit of 30 minutes to achieve the light brown. They weren't over cooked in the center at all. They were no where close to being done at 15 minutes. I'd definitely make these again. They were delicious and very well received. But for me they took considerably longer to make and considerably longer to bake than stated in the menu. Partially due to my additions. No matter. They're worth the time either way!

This was super easy to thow together, but I felt it need a little bit more flavor so I added 3-4 cloves of mnced garlic and 1 tsp of cyanne and it gave this recipe the extra flavor and kick it needed.

These were a huge hit at the party! I cut back on the bread crumbs, added garlic and onion powder, cayenne and some yellow onion. I took LGRIER514's advice and rolled the balls into more parm. I served this with a marina sauce and a sweet honey mustard sauce. Excellent and healthy too Tish!

These are pretty good.  I made a batch of them on Friday night for Valentine's Day hors d'oeuvres and only baked a small amount.  My husband and I really enjoyed them.  I froze the rest for a dinner party this week.  I added some cayenne and garlic powder to this recipe and rolled them in fresh grated parmesan before baking as suggested.  I didn't serve a dipping sauce, but I have some pizza sauce left in my refrigerator that I'm going to heat up for my company this week.  I'm going to pull them out of the freezer in advance so they'll thaw since I don't know if I can bake them frozen or not.  Very easy, and definitely a keeper for the freezer. -- P.S. I pulled them out of the freezer the other night and let them defrost before baking them for my guests.  I find that either fresh or defrosted, they need 15 minutes to cook.  They were fabulous, and all of my guests loved them!

I made my own variation of these. I only used 1 cup of bread crumbs. I sauteed with the butter 3 cloves of garlic. I also added lots of crumbled bacon. I added extra Parmesan cheese, a little paprika, and hot sauce. These are absolutely fantastic!

Pretty good base, but I spruced it up a little.  I used only 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs, added garlic, 1 T hot sauce, 1 cup sour cream and sauteed 1 cup onion in the butter. I also added some chopped artichoke hearts. I didn't add salt and used only 3 eggs. It gave it much more flavor!

My husband and I loved these.  I only had plain bread crumbs so I added some italian herbs (oregano, thyme, basil).  I took the advise of other reviewers and sauted some garlic and yellow onion in the butter and omitted the green onion.  These smelled wonderful while they were baking.  I took them to a potluck of about 40 people, but few people ate them.  A friend of mine (who ate 6) said people just didn't know what they were.  Next time I'll label them.  This made my husband happy, though, because he got to eat the left-overs.  These things were terrific and my friends don't know what they missed

I love this recipe and all the modifications others have made to suit their tastes.  Here's what we do:  I double the frozen spinach to four 10oz. packages (for more spinach flavor).  Substitute 1 cup of the bread crumbs with 1 cup of blanched almond flour (for lower carbs) and add some extra Italian seasoning to that.  Use 1/4 cup of finely diced white or yellow onion instead of green onion and use 2 whole eggs plus 2 x-lrg egg whites (for less sat fat).  I think the butter adds the richness needed, so I leave that as is.  I don't usually add garlic, b/c I don't want to saute anything for this easy recipe, but I have added garlic raw and a little goes a long way.  A little fresh grated nutmeg (1/4 tsp) is wonderful in this as well.  I usually cook up a  few for our meal that day and then roll out the rest onto a baking sheet lined with parchment and freeze (uncooked) individually on that. Once frozen I transfer them to a freezer bag.  They cook up beautifully from frozen in 25 minutes.  Great to have on hand when company arrives unexpected.   Will have to try them with the recommended Sangiovese, but have served with Sauvignon Blanc very successfully.  I have made this recipe as written and they are fabulous.  But the beauty of them is that they CAN be modified quite successfully to your tastes.  Don't pass this one up!

These were very easy to make and very tasty. Based on other reviews, I reduced the amount of breadcrumbs and added some spices (basil, oregano, garlic powder) to liven them up. My boyfriend thought they were a little dry, but everyone else liked them quite a bit. I served these at a party, and we all discovered we liked them even more with ranch dip - I bet they would be particularly tasty with marinara sauce!

I would have given this recipe 4 stars if it had been me who liked it!  I made this the other day for a finger food social night, but wasn't impressed when I tried it for myself, so I wasn't going to take it. My hubby tried it and liked it as did my son so I decided to take it and they really liked it and asked for the recipe!  Maybe my taste buds were just off that day - I don't know, but it was definitely easy to make (but a bit messy) and quick also.

I have been making this for years and it is always a hit.  To make them a little easier to serve and eat, I put one straight, thin pretzel in the middle of each ball.

I was looking for an appetizer to serve in parmesan baskets and someone on the Recipe Buzz recommended these to me.  I'm so glad they did, because they were simple and yummy!  At first bite, I wasn't sure, but then I couldn't stop eating them!  I did add a spoonful of minced garlic and a dash of cayenne for a little kick (and I'll add a little more next time).  I froze some for future easy appetizers.  THANKS, tish, for a nice appetizer!

I did not taste these, but they were very well received by my guests.  I followed the recipe as written, except I used 1/2 tsp. of onion powder instead of the green onion. Cute, quick, and tasty, what more could you ask for? I served these with marinara sauce and ranch dressing. The marinara is the winner for sure. I would definitely make these again for a party, thank you for sharing :)

I had this exact recipe except for the addition of 1/4 cup of marsala, sherry or other white wine.  Like others, I cut down on the amount of crumbs. And I sauted the onion, with some garlic (about 3 cloves, pressed), the wine and the spinach.  Then cool that before going ahead with the other ingredients and shaping the balls. I serve it with a Dijon sauce.  My friend always uses a marinara or bolognese sauce for dipping.

I made these with seasoned boxed stuffing mix and cooked fresh spinach. I rolled the cooked spinach in dish towel to get the extra moisture out after it was cooked and let the hot spinach melt the butter.I took them to a party with my favorite dip. Made with mayo, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and curry powder to taste. Everything was enjoyed by all. Most people hate to try things that look different so I had to put a sign by them.

I was very worried to make these for Xmas Eve due to the very mixed reviews!  However, I don't have words for what a big hit these were!  Everyone absolutely raved about them! They flew off the table! I made them ahead and froze them and they came out beautiful!! I also added a little bit of hot sauce! Don't listen to the bad reviews and just go ahead and make them!!  5 Stars!!

I just took these out of the oven and they're disappearing so fast I took time to post a review now. 
I took other reviewers suggestions and modified the recipe a bit: used parmesan, freshly grated, and mozarella. I used all of the frozen spinach, but left it a bit damp. I decreased the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups. My Italian crumbs were locally made Panko, and they're really garlicky, so I used a cup of those and a half cup plain. Used just 1/2 (large) onion, since the bread crumbs are so highly flavored. No salt, because good parmesan is quite salty.
I'll find out soon how they are with the marinara--can't stop eating them long enough to heat it up!
Another "goldilocks" recipe- not too dry, or too wet, at least the way I made them.  :)
Thanks, other reviewers, and thanks so much, tish!!

I made these spinach balls for Mothers Day. I followed everything to a tee except I added 2 cloves of garlic and used white onion instead of green (per suggestions here). I made them and rolled them in parmesan cheese. I mixed dijon mustard and mayo for a dipping sauce.

I had them all wrapped and refridgerated and was cleaning up the kitchen. I opened the microwave and there was the 1/2 cup of melted butter! Oops, the recipe still turned out great. In fact I think the butter would have made them too runny. Also, I saved a lot of unnecessary calories!

These are an excellent appetizer.  I formed the mixture into balls and then froze half of them.  They tasted just as good weeks later out of the freezer.

I make this exact same recipe except I use herb stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs. It's an old Bon Appetite recipe I love. Tried it with breadcrumbs and like the stuffing method a little better.

These didn't blow me away, but it was a good appetizer to bring to a party since it's not a common one.  I served them with marinara and everyone really liked them.  They did take a bit of work, but the end result was good.  I added 2 tsps minced garlic per others suggestions, garlic powder and a little oregano, and used yellow onion instead of green since it was what I had.  They definitely took more like 35 minutes to bake like some of the other reviews said.

These turned out just okay for me.  I didn't think that they had too much flavor.  I expected more flavor considering all of the ingredients that went into them.  I also didn't think that they baked well enough.  They didn't get that brown on the top and the center seemed to be not cooked as much as it should be.

I have made these many times for all kinds of parties, and they always dissapear. People are always asking me for the recipe. My favorite thing about these is that they taste just as good at room tempature so you don't have to worry about keeping them warm. You can also make them ahead of time.

Just made these for a dinner party. I made little Parmesan bowls for them. They made a delightful presentation.  To increase the flavors, I added some shrimp (about 2 handfulls of tiny bay shrimp) and chopped up 2 strips of bacon. Since I had it, I tossed in a bit of the grease. I also only used 16 oz of spinach. I used the frozen variety in the bag, not the Brick-O-Spinach. It was very yummy and worth making again. :)

These are good but I am going back to my old standby recipe, Stove Top Spinach Balls. I think the bread crumbs dry this one out.

This  is always a hit and it's so simple to do. I leave out the green onion, cut the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups, and add 1 tsp italian seasoning (Epicure Pasta spice, to be exact) to keep it flavourful.

Kids wouldn't eat them, unfortunately.  Use cracked whole wheat & italian seasonings in place of bread crumbs to make healthier.

Super recipe!!!!!  These were a big hit at Sunday Potluck.  I had to make a few changes because I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand … only one box of Spinach, but I threw in about ¼ lb. of sage sausage to compensate.  I only had plain breadcrumbs, so I added some Italian seasoning, with a bit of Turmeric, Thyme, salt and pepper.  I also grated up some fresh Parmesan cheese, about ¼ cup.  I sautéed half of a sweet onion and three cloves of garlic in the butter, before adding it.  Due to the reviews I added the bread crumbs slowly until the mix felt “right”, to keep it from being too dry, it was probably closer to 1 ½ cup or so.  I also rolled them in more Parmesan before placing them on the cookie sheet.  I cooked them 10 minutes, flipped them, then cooked them another 10 minutes and they were perfectly done throughout.  My husband kept coming through and sneaking a few at a time, I finally had to banish him from the kitchen!!!

After I read other users' reviews, I figured these balls needed a sauce to be served with.
I wrapped the spinach & parmesan mixture around feta dices, baked the balls for 15-20 minutes and served them with homemade tomato sauce. Guests were quite impressed!
Next time, I might try wrapping the mixture around mozzarella balls or dices or crumbling feta in the mixture, or add a little bit of ricotta in the mixture. I will make them again, for sure!

I really love these.  Make sure you don't squeeze every single bit of moisture from the spinach, or the balls will come out too dry.  I also tend to bake for 3 more minutes, as they don't seem quite cooked without this.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe - I bring it to all pot luck parties I go to!

This is a tasty appetizer. For anyone who did not like it, try using 5 eggs, 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs,large sweet onion,diced, SHREDDED Parmesan (gives better texture). Substitute 10 tablespoons of MARGARINE for the butter. Also adding a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper kicks it up a notch!!!
Don't make the balls to big. Cook 20 minutes.  Vary the cheese. Asiago is good too.  Kraft has SHREDDED Parmesan Romano and Asiago in one of their "green jars," try that as variation.   Be Creative until you find the combo you like.
Don't give up---keep trying!!!

Another big winner--everyone asks me for the recipe--I admit I did change it a little, though...I reduced the bread crumbs by..a 1/2 cup (I think) and I added two cloves of garlic

These are good! I only changed a couple things ;) I sautéed a small white onion in minced garlic and olive oil (substituted for green onion and butter). I also used Pepperidge Farm Herb seasoned stuffing instead of bread crumbs. I served them with marinara sauce. Very good!

Wonderful!  You MUST use seasoned bread crumbs, however.  Otherwise, these taste pretty bland.  I freeze these in ice cube trays, pop them out into a freezer bag, and then cook them up to serve with lunches for my kids.

I LOVED THESE. they're not gourmet or anything, but they're just perfect bites of spinach. not too much cheese or breadcrumbs..delish! Dipped them in marinara for fun. Made mine small, per pp, about a rounded teaspoon, slightly larger. Baked for 30 min...PERFECT

Made these as written and they are okay.  The only thing that really made me want to eat them was serving a really good artichoke marinara sauce with them for dipping.  We had leftovers, so I used them as "meatballs" in baked spaghetti and that was pretty tasty--better than as an appetizer alone in my opinion.  If I make them again, I'll definitely spice them up a bit!

These were good. They probably would have been better with the addition of some garlic like others had done. I made them exactly as written until it came to baking them. The first batch I baked like the recipe says and was disappointed b/c they seemed to flat out. So for the 2nd batch I decided to deep fry them @ 375 in peanut oil for about 2 mins or until they were golden brown. They looked alot better. I will be making these again b/c everyone seemed to like them even without a dipping sauce. Next time I might add some chopped fresh jalapeno also. Thanks!

These were awesome. I took others advice and sauted regular onions and some garlic. I also added some a bit of crumbled bacon and cayenne pepper. Cooked them probably 22 minutes.

My mom made these for a football game and they weren't a huge hit with our family. I'm reviewing on her behalf because she doesnt write reviews. She satueed onion and garlic in butter and added cayenne, garlic powder and a little salt to the mixture. They were very dry and just okay, not much taste. She is going to try the leftovers with marina sauce & pasta but as of now she said she wont make them again.

These are scrumptious!  We had these as a side for dinner and they went over very well.  Next time I will play around with the ingredients; adding other veggies and maybe even using whole wheat bread crumbs instead.  I broiled them for a bit at the end to get a good crunch on the outside.  Consider this a new favorite for us, thanks "tish"!

My grandma always made spinach balls using a high quality stuffing mix (Pepperidge Farms) but I like this recipe more!  Next time, I would decrease the bread crumbs a little.  I also added chopped garlic and cayenne as recommended by others.  If you don't like spicy foods, perhaps thyme would be a great addition instead.  The cook time was perfect; you should only expect the underside to end up browned.  The only downfall is that they taste great fresh out of the oven but when the sit on an appetizer table, they end up cold and untouched.  Overall, will make again.

Tasty and interesting, but a little dry.  I will make with more butter next time.

These are absolutely fabulous! I have made them time and time again and I always get compliments on them.  They hold up well in a chafing dish and are the perfect bite size appetizer. Thanks!

I was disappointed because they tasted too much like the breadcrumbs.  I would use less breadcrumbs and be sure to make very small (less than 1 inch) balls.  I also would add cayenne pepper

Really good way to get spinach, even if you don't like it!  Next time, we will try the mustard dip with it!  Highly recommended.

Flavor was somewhat bland.  Poor consistency made it difficult for the balls to stay together. Has good potential with modifications.

Tried these for an Xmas buffet and although an easy appetizer to prepare and freeze, we found they lacked an impressionable flavor.  The three kids (under 2 yrs old) there though, enjoyed them tremendously.  *Great* way to get your kids to enjoy spinach, and they did freeze excellently, just weren't a memorable addition to the buffet for the work it took to make them.

These were okay.  I made them with fresh spinach instead of frozen and maybe that was part of the problem.  I think they'd be better if you added pinenuts or something to give them a little crunch.  They were a little too mushy.  The mustard dipping sauce was essential to their taste.  I mixed 1/2 dijon mustard with 1/2 honey and the sauce turned out really well.

I made these for an appetizer for guests.  They loved it and so did I.  I served it with French's honey mustard.  I love the idea of making some to have in the freezer for a quick treat later!  Very, very good!!!

If you didn't know any  better, you'd wonder what kind of meat are in these. The texture and flavor really make you believe it could be a meatball. This would be a great appetizer or as a main course adding to some spaghetti squash as a faux spaghetti and meatballs dish. Another successful recipe added to my collection! :)

Great recipe - followed it exactly, and everyone loved it, especially the guys. Only two notes: mix the mash with your hands, otherwise it's too stiff to get it well combined. Also, I made the them a little larger - golf ball size -- and let them bake a few minutes longer. Super yummy!!

Well hate to be critical but they were not my favorite...I added spices to make sure it was not bland...but it was. I think though...those that are vegetarians would love this, so highly reccommend this for them and will make this for my vegitarian friends.

Taste would've been 3/5. These really stuck to the baking sheet even though I sprayed it. So badly that the bottoms came off of several. I didn't bother making the other half of it and chucked it all in the trash; the taste was OK but this recipe lacked something...

I did have to half the breadcrumbs and add some garlic. I did like it but I think I would have liked it better if I fried it...didnt get any crisp to it. Also I would chop up the spinach more.

Added bacon and I thought it came out too salty.  Did not need the egg and could have used Austin's butter and he could have eaten them,  Try it next time.

Thanks for the awesome recipe, Tish! Followed recipe to the T the first time, 2nd time tweeked to my personal taste: followed recipe, but instead I used: 1 c. bread crumbs, chopped 3/4 can of artichoke hearts, sauted 1/4 c yellow onion (didn't have green) in the butter, 2 egg whites, crumbled 3 slices of precooked bacon (nuked for about 30 seconds) then followed cooking instructions. Got rave reviews at our Chirstmas party! Thanks Tish!

My mom made this recipe 20 years ago for my high school graduation. These are wonderful.  But we use Pepperidge Farms herbed stuffing mix (blue bag) in place of the bread crumbs - this gives it a little more flavor.  And finely chopped regular onions work just as well.  Great recipe!!

These were great! Even my kids (5, 3, and 1 year-old) loved them. Great way to get kids to eat veggies, and I thought they were delicious, too. I did use slightly less breadcrumbs than called for. It took exactly 15 minutes, and they were perfectly done.

I really liked these, and I didn't even have any dip with them.  I sauteed minced fresh garlic with the onion and fresh spinach, then proceeded to follow recipe.  I can't wait to try these with sauce.

These were a nice fresh addition to our super bowl party, but i felt they lacked the flavor I was looking for as the recipe is written.  They definately need a good dipping sauce.

Very good! Great Choice for "finger food!" It tastes a bit like spinach quiche - without the crust!

I made these along with a thin spaghetti sauce. They actually taste like meat balls! Great healthy substitute. I added some chopped artichoke hearts to mine. Yum. I will definitely suggest this recipe to my vegetarian friends.

Handy food to have around for pot lucks, snacks for kids, etc. I used fresh spinach, added a little sour cream to combat the dryness some people reported, added garlic & onion powders and cut the bread crumbs down to one cup on the advice of others. Overall, these were tasty, although a little salty, I found. I'm always looking for healthy small foods for my toddler, so this is a really good one. Thanks a lot.

Great App!  However, kind of smells odd while you're making it.  Don't let it discourage you, they are quite tasty.  I only did 1.5c of bread crumbs, took the suggestion of 2 garlic cloves and sauted with onion (shallot instead of green) and butter.  Rolled in grated parmesan - made them much pretier.  Don't wait until they are "golden", you can't really notice the color change.  Bake 15-20 minutes.  Oh and I accidetally bought romano instead of parmesan and it was delicious!  Served with trader joe's marinara.

These came out wonderful but they did take longer to bake than the instructions said. The second time I was pressed for time and my kids wanted them to be cheesier so I added half a cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and I fried them and they came out even better. They are more healthy in the oven but fried is better if you don't have the time or the oven is filled. Great Super Bowl yummies!!

I made these the other night and my husband loved them. I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of parmesan and minced onion(forgot to get green onions at the supermarket. We dipped them in the Horseradish Dipping Sauce from this site.
Great combination! I'll be making them again for the holidays.

Took these for Thanksgiving appetizer along with  Spinach Feta Ball from this site and both  were a hit.
Did not use green onion, forget to pick them up.  I used only 1.5 cups bread crumbs, seasoned type.  I mixed everything together except the eggs and tasted the mixture for salt and flavor.  I found it quite good even without the green onion, not sure they are needed.  Also used 1/2 cup grated cheese from shaker can and 1/2 c of freshly grated from the deli section of supermarket and added a couple of shakes of onion powder & garlic powder then added the eggs.  Baked mine about 30 minutes total.  These would be good with other cheese as well so mix and match as you will.

I made these with margarine and yellow onion and they turned out great. They were a bit dry, but delicious when dipped in a sauce. Everyone at the party enjoyed them and several asked for the recipe. I'll make them again, and maybe incorporate some of the ideas (garlic, less breadcrumbs, etc).

I followed the suggestion of others and cut the amount of bread crumbs in half.  I also added a clove of crushed garlic and used shredded parmesan cheese.  I made the balls a day ahead, then popped them in the oven shortly before my guests arrived.

This was certainly easy but I didn't like them at all and I usually love anything with spinach!  Maybe I should have cut down on the bread crumbs as others suggested...I just didn't like the flavor or the texture.  Perhaps I'll try them again later with some modifications.

I made these for a party for my fiance's sister. His family is Greek and they are all wonderful cooks, and they were very impressed with my spinach balls. People I didn't even know were coming up to me asking for the recipe! You were right, they are a hit! I made one slight change, or I guess an addition, to the recipe. As I formed the mix into balls, I rolled the balls in more parmesan cheese. Next time I'm going to use feta cheese too and I'll let you know how that turns out!

I was SHOCKED when I found this recipe here!  This is the exact recipe I remember from 20 years ago when I first had it as a young newly married woman!  I had since lost the recipe in a move, and was VERY happy to have found it.  Just made it this past weekend for an anniversary party, and they were a hit, from grandparents to my little two year old!  THANKS!!!

These were delicious. At my sister's suggestion, I used a small onion instead of green onion, and added 1 lb of breakfast sausage, extra cheese, and several dashes of Tabasco. They were a huge hit!

I reduce butter to 3 tablespoons,   add 1/2 cup Feta cheese and 1 cup of FRESH parmesan cheese the good stuff! Add oregano (1/2 tsp) fresh ground black pepper, and fresh Italian parsley to the mix. I sauté' the onion (sweet onion) in the butter before adding it to the mix... imparts a better flavour. SAUCE: I serve these with a homemade honey Digon mustard dip - I mix it too taste TIPS:  I  double the recipe, put balls on baking sheet into the freezer, when frozen pack them in small bags then back into the freezer.  They freeze well. On occasion, I  have added cooked Kale to the recipe 1/2 and 1/2. Tip make sure you squeeze out the excess water from the spinage else they will be too soft to ball up.

These are delicious! I have made them so many times I can’t even count. Definitely my favorite finger food. Easy to throw together. They’re a big hit at parties and events, but I usually just make them for a midday snack. The family can’t get enough of them, neither can I. The recipe doesn’t necessarily need any tweaking, but I do use 1 ½ cups of bread crumbs and add a little garlic. Can’t go wrong with buttery and cheesy.

I absolutely love this recipe (i forgot to put the onions though) but added oregano, garlic, basil, a 1/2 cup of roasted green and red peppers and a handful of cooked cannellini beans and used my hands to get the proper consistency for rolling and then lightly browned them and added them to spaghetti sauce instead of meatballs. Served on a plate of potato gnocchi! OMG they are fantastic and tasty what a solution to meatless meals!!!!!!!

My guests devoured these. Next time I would cut down on the crumbs and shred the Parmesan instead of grating it, for more mouth feel.  Loved the scallions in these. Easy , pretty and delicious!

Simple, easy and delicious. For a change up, I made the spinach balls larger (as an entree side) and placed them on top of a thick sliced tomato. Drizzled a little olive oil over the top and baked for 25 minutes. Wonderfully delish!

This is an old family favorite. I made these tonight for a get-together. The only thing I changed was I added a little turmeric and paprika, and I had to substitute red onion for the green since that's what I had on hand. They're so easy, and it's fun to get my hands in the dough. Delicious! Everyone loved them. I served them with warm spaghetti sauce for dipping, though a good Dijon-style mustard is also tasty.

This is the first time I've made spinach balls.I made the recipe the evening before and put the unbaked balls in the freezer to serve at a meeting of 8 people the next evening. This Parm. Spinach recipe was easy to make and I made a dozen extra for the future.  When I am asked for the recip, I ask the person to log on to allrecipes.com and search for parmesan spinach. It is so easy to print.

Surprisingly delicious! Just don't serve them too hot (straight out of the oven). Cool for a few minutes before serving. I used Panko Italian breadcrumbs, so I didn't need to add salt or pepper.

Loved this, except I used stuffing blend instead of Italian bread crumbs and I used shreds of mixed italian cheeses with the parmasan; it made it "gooey".

I form the ball around a pimento olive.  It adds a nice surprise, but make sure to let them cool a bit before serving.
BTW, this is one of the only ways I can get the kids to eat spinach.

This makes a lot!  It's perfect for a pre-game party, since they are bite size.   We liked them with salsa.  I'd recommend making them a day ahead of when you need them because I lost count of how many I actually made....so it's not a last minute fix to take to a party or serve with dinner.

So so good!! I made these as an appetizer for company and was asked why I did not make more! Used seasoned stuffing instead of bread crumbs and dipped them in marinara sauce. Cant wait to make again! They are fast to make too which is a huge plus for me.

I made these exactly as recipe.  I served them with my red pasta sauce for dipping & a mustard dip also. I was having a large family re-union with Italian food & this was the perfect accompanying appetizer.  Easy to make, lots of them & still gone before I knew it.

I made these for Christmas Day and they were nothing special - disappointing in fact.  Although the addition of mustard as a dipper helped a lot.  I make  a spinach square recipe that is so much tastier than this.

These are fantastic - do add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, and  a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. Using  3/4 cup panko &  3/4 cup italian crumbs worked nicely, too.

These were delicious! And just as good the day after. Dipping them in marinara sauce was the perfect complement. I also cut back on the bread crumbs.

WOW! I figured this would be a good appetizer for the vegetarians in the crowd at our last party but EVERYONE ate them! I couldn't believe how good they were! I had to have my husband put some aside for me because they went so fast! I have 3 picky boys so I used about 1/2 a cup less of the spinach but other then that I followed the recipe. My kids have actually asked me to make this again!

My two daughters 3 and 2 actually enjoyed this dish. My oldest one took some of the spinach out but she still ate it and enjoyed it. I used seasoned salt instead of salt and added garlic powder to it as well. You can eat this plain or with marinara or pizza sauce. Great snack instead of the regular chips and crackers.

These were fabulous! I used whole grain bread crumbs and followed the other users suggestions - I sauteed half a yellow onion and three cloves of garlic in 1/3 cup of canola oil (a little healthier than the butter in the recipe) before adding it to the spinach. One cup of bread crumbs was PLENTY. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper and rolled the balls in extra Parmesan before baking. This created a wonderful, crunchy crust on the outside of each ball, although it made them a little salty. But it was worth it! Like one of other reviewers said, it took mine almost thirty minutes in the oven before they browned, and I made mine smaller than what the recipe suggested. Served with some leftover spaghetti sauce and they were delish!

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for and we were amazed by how much they tasted like regular meatballs. Will be making these again and using them in spaghetti as a great vegetarian (I only eat poultry) alternative. Also, it should be noted that if you don't have a huge baking sheet, you might have to be creative. I wound up using 2 smaller baking sheets plus a broiler pan covered in foil just to fit them all.

Surprisingly good considering I like spinach, but don't love it.  I added some minced garlic, extra parmesan, & a few drops of some hot sauce for extra flavor.  I would definitely use less spinach next time, but overall they were good!

I cut the recipe in half. But I still only had about 8 oz of spinach and a hair under 1/2 c parmesan cheese. I don't think mine really browned, but I took them out after 17 minutes. They were done and tasty. rather salty tho, and I didn't add any salt at all. would consider making them again, but probably not, since the draining of the spinach frustrates me.

You have to be a a big fan of spinach to enjoy these. I did expect them to taste better than what they did. They were all right. A spicy mustard is a must. Probably won't make this again but glad I tried.

Sorry, but I guess I expected more out of this based on the reviews.  I sauteed a shallot in some butter, and used freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I used store-bought breadcrumbs - maybe I should of made my own.

I made this recipe and the Parmesan Broccoli Balls recipe andI have to say this one turned out "prettier".  I also used red onions instead and it added an extra touch of color which was perfect for a Christmas Party spread.

Very good!  I used fresh, chopped spinach.  Also added bacon and onions sauteed in garlic per other suggestions.  We preferred them warm, not room temp.  Served with a bistro sauce (like bloomin onion dip from Outback).

This recipe is great. The balls turned out so good I couldnt keep the hubby away. I followed the recipe, except I took jackay advice and put the yellow onion instead of green and I only used half of the onion and the 2 garlic cloves. I would defently suggest 30 mins cook time instead of 15.I have to say it was easy to make and smelt great while cooking.Oh and tastes great too. Thanks for this great recipe.

I'm giving this a 4 because my guests really really liked them, but I thought they need a tad bit more flavor.  Next time I'll add some cayenne pepper or something.  I added garlic salt and instead of parm cheese I did an italian mix that was dominant in parm cheese to make it more moist.  I will make again so thanks!

This was a big hit at my housewarming party - everyone was asking for the recipe.  In the past 3 months, I've made it 3 times.  The only changes I made was cutting back on the bread crumbs by 1 cup and in the place of salt & pepper, I used season-all, cayenne pepper and 1 clove garlic as suggested by another reviewer.

These were very good.  I made them for a Christmas Eve appetizer.  Even my 15 month old son loves these.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe but kept the bread crumbs at 2 c.
I used a three cheese parmesan blend and threw in some red pepper flakes.  I baked them longer than the recipe stated.  I'd definitely make these again.

I made these for an anniversary party and people came up to me all night telling me how good they were!  Some said they didn't even like spinach but loved these.  I also decreased the bread crumbs to 1 cup or so and i added 1 clove of minced garlic and some hot sauce.  Make them small cause these suckers are filling!

These were a little bland and pretty dry.  I see others cut the bread crumbs some, and that probably helped it.  Probably won't make again.

Made these for a party for my roomates and friends ( we are in college).  They were a huge hit, I did make them ahead and freeze them and they took a long time to cook but came out fine.  Served them with honey mustard, which i s how I have always had spinach balls.  They got cold pretty quick, so I would not leave them out for longer than an hr.

I think this recipe was great!!!  I even messed it up because I didn't thaw out the spinach first (duh)!  Anyway, it still managed to turn out really good, but I did turn the balls once to get a more even crispiness and they were just right.  Maybe a little longer cooking time, next time because I like mine real cripy.  But overall excellent.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I usually use a different recipe for spinach balls, but there was something missing with this one....the balls were too mushy in the middle.  Next time I might increase the cooking time or reduce the amount of egg.

I would make these again.  I used some shredded mozzarella,  too, and that worked out well.   Probably would be good with some marinara on the side to dip.

I made this appetizer for my Book Club, which is really a girl's night out and they loved it!! I added extra ingredients as I always do on any recipe.  I added 2.5 big garlic cloves finely chopped.  Worcestershire, ,Tabasco sauce, and red pepper (Cayenne  pepper} for a kick I didn't measure as I hardly ever do, but I added probably 2 tablespoons of the sauces or more, good bit of the red pepper. 
.Also added some Mexican shredded cheese as I had some to use up, maybe a cups worth,   1 extra egg and little more bread crumbs {I always make my own...so easy...you should do it!}.  I guess I should post as my own new recipe!  Make sure you use the green part of the scallions too.  I think I will use red pepper flakes next time for even more color.  Let me know if you use my recipe!!  Seriously, everyone wanted my recipe version and I had no leftovers!!  Enjoy!!.

The recipe was delicious but I was surprised how much butter it called for.  Much of it was on my sheet pan at the end.  Next time I make them, I will reduce the butter.  Got rave reviews!!

Made 1/2 of the recipes (serves 5). I used just slightly less than 1/2 the recommended breadcrumbs. Used fresh spinach and put a large bunch in a hot pan to wilt. This is better than frozen since it was not watery at all. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Rolled the balls in extra parmesan cheese as someone suggested. Baked for 15 minutes and it came out perfect! Next time I'll use pretzel sticks to hold them which is a great idea.

I really like this recipe, I changed it up a bit. Instead of bread crumbs I used a box of herb stuffing mix broken up, added 2 more eggs, and use 1 small white onion. I made almost 60 balls and they disappeared quickly at the party. I had to write the recipe out numerous times.

I didn't do salt and pepper.  I did do ADOBO seasoning.  Still,  it needs something...I felt it  was lacking something...maybe next time I'll put minced garlic and either red pepper flakes or Texas Pete hot sauce to zip it up next time.

Made them 2x. First time followed the recipe and they were just ok. Second time added in curry, chopped garlic and cayenne. Kicked it up a bit and they were much more flavorful.

I love these, and not just for guests. 
Just two things:
It's worth throwing in some fresh spinach, as it tastes a little different than frozen.
I make up the balls, and freeze them. For a quick snack, you can pop some in the microwave, and they taste pretty much the same .

These are fantastic!  They were a hit at the party I brought them to.  I took the advice of a couple people in the comments and added a few dashes of cayenne.  It provided a subtle kick that people seemed to enjoy.

My aunt use to make, a version of, this recipe. So, I made some changes to this recipe. I used a box of pork flavor stuffing mix. I didn't add the green onion. I made them ahead and froze the spinach balls, and when I baked them I add an extra 10 minutes since they were frozen.

This is a good little appetizer.  I followed some other reviews and cut the bread crumbs in half.  I also doubled the amount of onion.  I briefly sauteed the onion with some garlic in some of the butter.  I used shredded parmesan instead of grated.  I was still hoping for  a bit more flavor so next time will add some basil.  I baked on parchment paper for 15 minutes, then flipped them and baked another 15. I served these with the Horseradish dipping sauce from this site - that was a good complement. Edit: 12/17:  I wanted to make these gluten free so used GF bread crumbs this time.  I started with one cup but ended up using the full 2 cups.  I also added some finely chopped baby bella mushrooms with the onion and garlic saute.  I used an Italian spice blend to add flavor.  I still find them overwhelmingly 'spinachy' and continue to try to find ways to enhance the flavor.  The Horseradish sauce really is necessary in terms of flavor.

Very good but I used the recipe as a base and added more ingredients the 2nd go around since it was a bit dry and too bland for our taste buds first time. Added 1/2 cup lowfat cottage to add moisture. Also, kicked up the flavor with sauteed onions and garlic, bacon bits, touch of hot sauce, chicken instead of herb flavored stuffing and dried oregano and parsley. Wow, everyone loved these!!!

Very easy and tasty.  Brought to a picnic and they were all eaten.  I needed all the bread crumbs, unlike other reviewers,  and time to cook was 20+,minutes... It depends on how big and wet the balls are.  I will add more garlic or cayenne in the future for adults, but good way to get some spinach to kids too!

These were good. Followed recipe but squeezed spinach first and added extra Italian herbs: parsley, oregano and basil. Also in lieu of onions added onion and garlic powder and then rolled the balls in more parmesan cheese. Kids helped make his which they enjoyed.

I was searching for a particular recipe to pop in the oven before a meeting at my house last night, (I had 10 min) and I ran a cross this one I had printed to use before.  I had all the ingredients to make a half batch so I quit searching and quickly whipped this together. They gobbled them up!!!   I made pretty much as directed,  except I did not have italian bread crumbs so I added some basil and garlic powder, and in my rush to pop them in the oven,  the butter was left melting in the microwave.  They had been in the oven about 8 minues when i realized my mistake,  so I pulled them out and brushed in on, and let them roll around in the butter.  They turned out delicious! I ate them as is.   A friend dipped them in ranch dip, and loved them as well.  Everyone asked for the recipe! Next time I 'll try to take a picture!!  Thank you tish!!!

This is a great vegetarian alternative to meatballs.  I sub-ed a drained , chopped can of artichoke hearts for one of the packs of spinach (just because). Also sautéed the onions and some garlic in the butter. Served with Marinara sauce.  Yum yum!

Tried this tonight, mixed all ingredients per receipe baked a few and tried, horrible, then after tweeking from other postings, still missing some kind of pizzaz.  Dipping sauce did help some.  Will not make again.

Great recipe.  I use asiago cheese too and roll the balls in cheese.  If you freeze them on a cookie sheet and then package them you will always have some ready to go appetizers

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The balls were just okay, not something I would make again.  I love spinach and still didn't care for these.  On the plus side, these were super easy too make.

I used packaged stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs.  I also added feta cheese to the mixture to kick it up a notch.

I added 2 more green onions and 4-5 cloves of garlic. I also added cayenne pepper and a dash or two of nutmeg. I only used 1 1/2 cuos of bread crumbs (italian) as other readers suggested. The family loved it. Great recipe.

I only use fresh spinach, and I had saltine crackers that I needed to use so I used those instead of bread crumbs.  They were excellent, but I know they would be much better with bread crumbs, expecially seasoned bread crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe.

I halved the recipe and used fresh spinach from the garden rather than frozen. Also, I made my own bread crumbs from my failed attempt to make hot dog/hamburger buns. Tasted GREAT!

I had misplaced my Spinach Ball recipe and knew that I would find it on this site!  Made them today exactly as written in this recipe and they were delicious. I made two cookie sheets to serve and sent the unmade mix home with a guest along with the recipe! The recipe is back in my home file as well as saved in my allrecipes.com recipe box. Thanks!

These taste great, but I couldn't form balls and ended up with shapelss heaps. Perhaps it was because of the changes I made: I used fresh spinach and I added some mashrooms, which really gave the flavor a boost. Still, the kids, as well as the adults, loved them.

These were pretty good. I would definitely add more cheese next time, and I found that they were only really tasty when they were hot out of the oven.

These were good but they need quite a bit of sprucing up to be considered exceptional. I added garlic and rolled them in Parmesan and they were ok. I may come back to this recipe in the future to see what I can do to make it better.

These were OKAY but we thought they tasted like parmesan flavored hush puppies. I should have read the reviews and lessened the amount of bread crumbs added. Even so the flavor seemed to be lacking and if I make them again I'd have to doctor it a bit.

This had potential. I served these at Thanksgiving and some people seemed to like them. But, there were still lots left at the end of the night. I, personally, thought they were a bit dry. I might add some cheese in the middle of these balls, maybe. Thanks anyway!

10 stars!  These are so delicious!!  And when you realize how much spinach goes into them - they have to be pretty healthy for you too.  I like to flatten them into cakes and saute them instead of bake them.  It makes a nice crispy crust.

I made this as an appetizer for a "get together" and my friends loved it! From reading past reviews, I sauted the onions with garlic before adding it to the mixture. I also used marinara sauce for dipping. Turned out great!

These were excellent. I wanted to try this before superbowl sunday. I took the advice from other reviews, and sauteed the scallions along with minced garlic in the butter. The garlic was a BIG plus to this recipe. Next time I will add less bread crumbs. Also, do NOT make the mistake of overcooking these. I took the out after 15 minutes, they were perfect, I then kept them on warm in the oven and they became too hard and not as good.

These were alright - best when they were fresh out of the oven.

These spinach balls are delicious. The only criticism I can think of is to have a bit less cheese. The parmesan is incrediably strong so next time I make this I will minimize this amount and increase the bread crumbs. However, this recipe is still delicious.

I had these at my book club party last night and they are incredible!  I couldn't stop eating them and they're mostly spinach  so I didn't feel too bad.  Ha!  They're so tasty and light-tasting too.

Very tasty.  This was a perfect way to use up my leftover spinach from making Creamy Veggie Fondue (from this site).  Bonus - my 16 month old loves to eat them too!

I'm not sure if my results were because I attempted to use fresh spinach, but my appetizers turned out to be more like spinach 'pancakes'.  They totally did not hold their shape, and completely stuck to the pan.  Handing a fork to each guest to eat off of the bake pan, it wasn't the best presentation.  Next time I will follow it exactly as written.

These were great.  A way to get finicky eaters to eat their veggies.  The only change I made was to use fresh spinach.

this is one of my favorite recipes. we have some vegetarians in our family, so i was trying to find a yummy alternative to meatballs. since i started making them, now not just the vegetarians eat them - everyone loves them! i also cut back on the breadcrumbs...and put fresh minced garlic in, and a dash or two of cayenne. it's wonderful!

Wow! These were a huge hit and I've been requested to make them again at another party in two weeks. I even messed up the recipe a bit-I didn't have enough Italian Bread Crumbs so I used flour instead! Awesome and what a way to make the kitchen smell great!

These are pretty tasty and a great appetizer for parties.  I used a small chopped white onion instead of green onions.

Even picky eaters love this recipe.  I've used this as a family gathering staple for years.  Also freezes well - make extra and freeze on a cookie sheet, toss into a freezer bag and you'll have them on hand - no fuss, no muss.

I made this for a party, and while they tasted good right out of the oven, they weren't all that good afterwards.  A few people tried them at the party, but I ended up taking most of them home with me.  Maybe I did something wrong, but they tasted dry and too much like spinach, and they fell apart easy.

SOOO good and so easy to make.  Even kids and people who aren't particularly fond of spinach like them.  They warm up great too.  I always make a double batch thinking I will freeze some and there are never enough left!

Because other reviewers said this recipe was dry, I tried a moister cheese as well as reducing the breadcrumbs.  I tried both parmesean and bleu cheese in a test cooking, the bleu cheese  worked well, it has a robust flavor that adds to the otherwise bland ingredients.  My next experiment will be with monterey jack with jalapeno peppers.

I have made this recipe twice and it is great!  As others suggested, I reduced the amount of bread crumbs in half and also added a clove of minced garlic.  I did not have onions on hand the first time I made this recipe, but they were not missed.  I actually made a batch and put in the freezer for unexpected company.  They only stayed in the freezer for 2 days before they got devoured, but I will make another batch for the freezer.

These were great.  I made them for an office food day & they were gone by 11:00.  Everyone really liked them (including myself)!  I did follow other people's suggestions & reduced the amount of bread crumbs to 1 cup and added cayenne pepper.

I followed the amount of bread crumbs and everything to a tee BUT added other things as people suggested and these were adored.  I added 1/2 a head of minced garlic, season salt (as I only used regular bread crumbs I added dry basil as well).  I also added 3 tbsp Sambal Oleke and 4 tbsp of chilli garlic sauce. I only used 1-10 oz package of fresh spinach also.  It was lovely!

I was disappointed with the recipe.  They were dry and bland.  A few changes, i.e. cut down on breadcrumbs and add some garlic may help.  I won't make them again

Took everyones advice and reduced the amount of bread crumbs to just over a cup and added some additional spice. Add 1 Tbsp of hot sauce, 1 Tbsp of chili paste, and 1 Tbsp of crushed garlic. I also had to cook them for about 25 minutes before they firmed up. Loved them they were excellent.

I was informed of these from my sister.  These were great at our New Year's Eve party!  Everyone loved them and I can't keep up with the requests for the recipe.  Definitely use less bread crumbs (I only used 1 cup) and for a different twist, I added crumbled bacon (men cannot turn away anything with bacon!)about 1/2 cup.  They were the first things to go.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

AWESOME!  Made it for a staff party and gave out the recipe to everyone!  I did add a heaping tbsp of chopped garlic though for an extra kick and used a regular 'seasoned' stuffing mix rather than Italian and threw in a dash of Italian seasoning.  Froze excellant too!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Am making it again for tonites New Years party by request!

They weren't very flavorful to me.  I was going to have them plain for an appetizer, then tried one and ended up not even finishing it.  Then I used it as a replacement for meat with pasta and sauce and that helped but something was just missing....

Thank you for this recipe! I made it on Thanksgiving Day as a appetizer. It was great. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I made 34 of theses balls and they lasted about ten minutes. Everyone was asking for more. I will definitly keep this and make many more times! Thanks!!

just made these and they turned out perfectly. Did not add salt, but did add garlic, cayenne and feta along with the parmesan.  They did not brown but are not mushy inside either so that's a plus! Will definitely make again and freeze for later use.

This is an appetizer recipe that I return to again and again.  They are great for parties as you can make them ahead and freeze them.  I do think that reducing the breadcrumbs a bit keeps them from being too dry.  I also agree with the reviewer who said they don't need any salt.  The cheese adds enough salt.  Thanks for the great recipe!  This seems to be loved by all, even those who don't like spinach.

These were really good!  One hint; you don't really need much salt.  I don't use any now.  The first time I made these I added a teaspoon and that was WAY too much.
