These are scrumptious!  I've been making these for 10+ years.    PLEASE READ FOR HELPFUL HINTS:  The fix for the salt issue is DO NOT use the 1 package ranch salad dressing mix.  Instead use 1 cup of PREPARED ranch salad dressing.  Another trick that kicks this recipe up a notch is to use 1/2 pound regular sausage and 1/2 pound hot sausage.  Also, use PAM versus vegetable oil to control the grease.  You'll be glad you tried these tips as this recipe rocks!  It flies off the table everytime I make it.

Great recipe.  I had extra filling so the next morning I put it a pie plate, covered with 8 eggs and it made a yummy crustless quiche.

Always a big hit.  I like that I can bake the wonton wrappers days or even a week ahead of time and keep them in an airtight container.  I can also make the filling ahead of time.  I let the cooked ingredients cool before mixing in the cheese and then store that in an airtight container.  When guests arrive - I'm sometimes pulling things together and it's very easy to ask the guests to fill the wonton wrapers with the pre-made filling and toss in the oven.

Try using a shot glass to push the wrappers down into the mini muffin cups - works great! (spray w/ Pam -- don't use the oil; too many calories and not necessary). I prefer to bake them IN the muffin tin (removing them to a baking sheet makes them harder to handle & creates more dirty dishes); just remove to a rack to cool. Try adding about 1/4c prepared (homemade) ranch dressing rather than the dry mix, gives a bit of extra moisture and its easier to control the salt content. Lots of great tweaking potential. MMM!

Made these for a party yesterday and were gobbled up by the men!! We gals loved them too but when we went back for seconds, they were gone. I used Italian sausage and due to it's high salt content, I left out the dried dressing. Instead, I used plenty of my own seasonings and even added a bit of tomato sauce. I had crescent rolls in the house, so I figured that they would also work. I laid out crescent roll dough, filled them with the meat mixture, rolled them up and baked. Excellent appy Minnie and thank you!!

Big big hit with the family on Christmas!!! This was pretty much identical to the sausage stars a family member used to make! I made two adjustments. 1. Added 3oz cream cheese, making them even better than I remember. 2. I don't know if it was the size of my wonton wrappers or a miscalculation in the original recipe, but I could only fit 1Tbs of filling into each shell. Any more and they would have been overflowing and I would have had half my shells left empty. I was so glad to find this recipe so I knew how to revive this family favorite for my loved ones!!!

I made these at christmas and my family absolutely loved them!  I get requests for them all the time now.  I've made them with won tons and phylo dough cups and they're great either way.

I made these in mini muffin tins and they made a great appetizer for my super bowl and new year's eve parties.  I used phylo dough instead of wonton wrappers, using 2 layers of phylo which made the tiny cups super flaky.  To fit the dough in the mini muffin tins, i used a shot glass to evenly tuck the dough into place.  worked like a charm!  I did not use the ranch dressing and the filling was still super tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit..and I loved them too. The recipe calls for 48 wonton wrappers but makes 24 servings, so I assume you're supposed to use 2 wrappers for each. I only used one for each and still ended up with about 40 apps! Besides that and having used an oil spray similar to Pam, I followed the recipe exactly. SO GOOD. It's very important to make sure you press the wrappers into and up the muffin cups firmly as some of my first batch folded on themselves. Not nearly as time consuming as I had imagined. THANKS!

These were really good.  Next time I'm going to add 1 1/2 Lb of sausage and only 1 cup each of cheddar and Monterey Jack chesse's.

I made these last year for a Superbowl party.  I forgot to add the Ranch dressing, and I used hot italian sausage.  They were a huge hit!  I made them again for this New Year's Eve party.  I made them w/o the ranch dressing.  Everyone raved again!  They do take some work to make, but it is fun.  Definitely a special occasion recipe when you want to impress company.  Especially the men!

I made this for Christmas . I thought they were pretty good but felt a bit guilty due to the fact that they are very fattening.The presentation with the green and red pepper looked great but next time I would work on making it lighter

I made these "stars" for my 4th of July party, and I had no leftovers!  Everyone loved them.  The only change I made was that I only used 1/2 of a ranch packet, and they were perfect.

I love this recipe!  I make it with lean ground chicken, 2 cups of sharp cheddar, black olives, green onions, ranch dressing mix, and I add a bit of italian spice as well.  Much less fat and just as delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe Minnie!

I have been making these for years. I do a few things different though. I don't use the green peppers or the green chiles and I use 1/2 cup onion. I also use half regular and half hot sausage. I prepare my salad dressing as directed on the package. then mix it in. I also use pam cooking spray as did some of the others. These are super and are always gone very quickly!

This is a great recipe.  They are absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Not really expensive to make either.  This will definitely be my go to appetizer recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly as written.  Wontons took a little longer to brown in my oven than the recipe states.

These are so tasty and super easy to make!! A winner for sure.  I omitted the green chilies because I couldn't find them at the store, it was still very good but next time I'd like to try it with the chilies. And there will DEIFNITELY be a next time!

I have been making these for 15 yrs. The only change in recipe is that I use Pam cooking spray on the wontons instead of vegetable oil.  Always a big hit and they never last long on the serving platter!!!!

Way too salty!  Flavor was good but completely overpowered by the salt.  Will make again but omit the Ranch dressing mix.

If you like salty, this recipe is definitely for you.  The ranch dressing mix made this so salty that I literally spit them out of my mouth.  In addition, even with the cheese, these were very dry. Maybe sour cream would help?

This is a great appetizer, very filling. I made them for an asian themed party and they were really good, just wish I would have cooked them a bit longer as the shells were not as crisp as I would have liked.

A dear long lost friend of mine gave me this recipe about five years ago. I went to look for it for Christmas Eve "Appetizers" and couldn't find it. I was shocked when I searched for it and found it here. I thought it was a unique thing and I would never get to make thema again. I am so happy because these are DELICIOUS!!!!! She made them once (thought w/out the olives), and then they were requested at EVERY get together. They never lasted long so you had to grab them as soon as they were offered! I was really bummed when I thought about not getting to make these and introduce them to my family ;) THANKS FOR POSTING THIS SCRUMPTIOUS RECIPE!

I have served these several times during the holidays and at parties. The only thing I did differently is I used Hidden Valley Ranch bottled Salad dressing instead of the dry ranch seasoning.  Be careful how many you put out because your guests will fill up on these and not be hungry for dinner!  They are always the first to go and everyone asks for the recipe. They are addictive! I'm making them for Thanksgiving potluck this year!

I added cream cheese and omitted the peppers (my husband hates peppers).  I used crescent rolls and didn't prebake them.  Everyone thought it was great!  Thanks

I have been making this one for years.  It is very good.  I omit the chiles, green pepper, and olives.  It still tastes great.
One tip though.  It is much quicker if you use two muffin tins.

I made these as a christmas starter and everyone loved them! I skipped the olives and ranch though but they still tasted great. Thanks for a unique and tasty recipe!
