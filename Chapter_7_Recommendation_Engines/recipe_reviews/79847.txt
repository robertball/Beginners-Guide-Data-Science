Very delicious. Only one suggestion: Add the water as you go along depending on if you want it thicker or thinner (I added none at all). This one is a keeper for us!

I loved this soup. I used ground turkey in place of the beef and I was not shy with the cayenne pepper. I also added a little cumin and chile power to spice up the turkey. I'll be making this one again soon!

When I was in college we would have called this 'stuff and glop' which is not an insult - we'd take some ground beef and throw in a can of this or that and enough spice to kill the bad taste This recipe is like that except it is well seasoned and thought out. Cheap easy and delish thanks 2sider! I might substitute some short pasta for the potatoes and use some tomato paste in with the meat at the start to give it a bit more depth but it's good as is.

I used one can Rotell Tomatoes with Green Chilies and one can tomatoes with sweet onions and roasted garlic. I also used dried onions. Very good a little spicy but good on a cold winter day. It is thick and more like a chili than a stew. I will make it again. Leftovers are great for lunch.

This was delicious! I adapted it to the crock pot but would still be a really quick meal for supper if made according to the recipe. My family loved it!

This stew is delicious! It went great with cast iron skillet corn bread. I prepared it exactly as instructed except I omitted one cup of water. My family loved it so I will definitely make again!

This is a great base recipe. I think it should pack a bit more punch and we add 16 oz of green chiles. Double up on potatoes and corn. I use 3 lbs of extra lean ground beef. My family loves it and the four of us eat every bit of the 6 quarts it makes.

What a big hit with my family! I liked it but my husband couldn't get enough of it. He ate 5 bowls! He would give it 6 stars. Didn't change a thing and served it with hot french bread & butter and a mixed green salad on the side. Will be making again soon!

Good - better the next day. Added some of my homemade salsa to give it more oomph. Served topped with grated cheese and raw sweet onions.

I don't cook often - just the quick and easy recipes here. This is the only recipe my boyfriend has ever requested me to make again. (He has twice!). He likes very spicy food so I omitted can of green chilis and used a can of Rotel Extra Hot. Used just 1 can of peeled tomatoes. Preboiled potatoes also. We both love this - thanks!

This was a perfect soup for a cold winter's night. I love hot and spicy so I went a little too crazy on the cayenne so the family had a hard time with it but it was fun to watch them try. I'll make it again but I'll make it so that everybody else can enjoy it too. It did a good job of cleaning out the sinuses though.

I think this soup is very good except for the gardenzola beans. This is my 10 yr old daughter's opinion. She gives it 4 stars. I cannot give this any rating because I did not follow the recipe to a tee! I used 3 cans of beef broth and one vegie. The curry did not work well with the beef broth. If I had to rate it for my change I would give it a 3. My recommendation would be to follow the recipe. If I did do this again I would cut the curry down unless you really like curry give it a try. I am told to give a rating so here I go.

Initially this recipe almost got a not so good review. When I first made it I didn't think it had very much flavor. I went a little crazy with the cayenne pepper so it had plenty of heat. I really didn't eat any the night I made it...but after a night in the fridge...I had some so did my bf and his friend and my friend and they LOVED it.

I thought this recipe was good but not great. It's pretty bland. I liked the leftovers the next day better. My mom really liked it though so it gets 4 stars.

When I read this receipe I thought boy I'm not going to like this but since all the other reviews significant others loved it I thought I'd make it for my dear Hubby. It was delicious and even though I upped the heat with habanero sauce I really like it too. Very good very easy and very healthy. I put this in my WW online build a receipe and the only change I made was to use Ground Turkey Breast instead of ground meat. It came up with 3 points per serving.

I literally threw this together quickly the other night and it was a hit with my husband. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a can of Amy's Organic Cream of Tomato Soup instead; it worked great. I also added some chili powder and Tabasco Brand seasoned salt. I used frozen corn instead of canned and the leftover boiled redskinned potatoes I had from the night before were substituted for the fresh ones. I will definitely make this again; it was so easy and very delicious the next day! Thanks.
