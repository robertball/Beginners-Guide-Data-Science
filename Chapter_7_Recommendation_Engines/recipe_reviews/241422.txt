Simple and delicious! I lightened these up further by using whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose and using olive oil cooking spray to fry these in. These were perfectly browned and very flavorful.  Next time I would not add the extra salt, as they were a bit on the salty side, but other than that, these were great! We LOVE zucchini patties/fritters and this will be a healthy alternative to our usual fried in oil variety. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful!! I have been playing with my waffle iron. I followed exactly but threw it in the waffle iron on high for about 4 minutes. So good

Great idea to use up garden zucchini! I substituted half the flour for bread crumbs and added garlic powder and a dash of Herbamere all natural herbed sea salt. I served with a yogurt sauce I made with fat free Greek yogurt, minced garlic, fresh parsley and salt n pepper.

I made this recipe as stated with the slight exception of not having a cheesecloth available. I tried to force as much as the moisture out of the zucchini using paper towels instead. That really didn't work well; I ended up with a gloppy mixture more runny than it should have been. Even so, I pressed on and fried it up anyway. Yep, it certainly wasn't the most aesthetically pleasing dish I've ever made but it sure was yummy! I'll make this again after I get a cheesecloth. Thank you for sharing!

Followed directions to a T for the first 3 patties into the pan.  My squash was still a little wet, so I put flour on a plate and rolled them in it a bit before frying.  This worked well for me.     It was a mess making these, but they were yummy.  I did use Gluten free flour in place of all purpose flour.  My husband wanted sour cream and chipotle hot sauce on them, and thought they were delicious.

So as per the other comment I used whole wheat flour, cooking spray, and didn't add the extra salt... A little bit healthier.  My picky 3 year old helped me mix and devoured hers for dinner YEY!  Huge hit in my house!  Will make again very soon.  I broke it down into 6 small fritters which turned out to be perfect serving size for us.

These were surprisingly good. I did add a little salt to the shredded zucchini to help pull the water out and  pressed the batch onto a thick layer of paper towel. I did not add any other additional salt. I used about a 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder added to the flour to help puff the fritters up. This recipe is very adaptable as far as the seasoning you can use. I might even try some Old Bay Seasoning next time....sorta like faux crab cakes. These would also be good as a side or appetizer if made smaller in size. This is a fun, and easy recipe to experiment with.

Easy to make. Did not even drain the zucchin but just grated finely and mixed in batter, liquid and all. Made them gluten-free with buckwheat instead of regular flour.  Added a  2nd egg to the mixture because my eggs are smallish, and buckwheat is  not very sticky. Maybe use regular GF flour next time, to see how that works out. Heat needed to be medium-high on my gas stove. Used coconut oil. to fry in. Turned out delish. Family loved them with sour cream on the side.

This were so good and easy. Even my adult son who isn't  big fan of zucchini liked them. I believe it's important to let the zuc drain for a few hours, not 10 minutes. I woke up early and grated, salted, etc and the plate under the colander  was full of liquid when I was ready to make them. I used cheese cloth and squeezed out a lot more.  Changes: 2 eggs, no additional salt, twice as much cheese (cause I grated it!) King Arthur white whole wheat flour, 2 tablespoons half and  half because the whole wheat absorbs more liquid and it was really dry (could use water or milk or an additional egg probably). Measured the frying oil out a tiny bit at a time to a non stick skillet and they fried up beautifully. This is a great breakfast or side dish with dinner. Thanks. PS  I had a couple of small yellow summer squash on hand and used them too. Made them really pretty.

Way to salty! And I didn't even add the kosher salt. In fact, I rinsed the salt out if the zucchini before I squeezed it dry and it was still too salty. I would probably make it again, but without the salt in the colander (just the Parmesan cheese).

I have a recipe from my mom in law similar to this, the difference is omit the parm cheese, garlic & use 6 tbls of flour, 3 tbls sugar & 2 eggs, next crop from my garden I will try the above recipe.  Its a must to get the zucchini drained well, if I have he time I prepare zucchini & leave to drain several hours before mixing remaining ingredients.  Using cheesecloth is a great idea I never thought of.

We love this! I omitted the salt (I'm on a low salt diet). I froze and thawed the zucchini which draws all moisture out without salt.  I also used more garlic than listed and added onion powder. It uses a boatload of zucchini for 2 people, which I love. I have way to much zucchini in the garden lol. I can freeze it and have zucchini fritters all winter!

I made these and added shredded Mexican cheese blend.  They were scrumptious.  I also made a side dip of sour cream, lime juice and crushed garlic ( just a tad).  WOW!  These disappeared so fast you would think they were candy.

This is a great  spring-board recipe especially if you have a garden.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe, for the most part; I used buckwheat flour and cajun spice. I loved it!  My son came for breakfast the next day and it was a hit.  Now I have added other vegetables such as onions, carrots, beans... what ever my garden has decided to grow generously.  Seasoning is just as flexible, Italian, then top with pasta sauce and mozzarella, curry and a yogurt sauce... wow! Tonight I topped my garden fritter with hommus.  I will be doing a batch this weekend and adding some garbanzo beans to make a more complete meal fritter that I can pack for work.  When I am more in the mood for meat, I bet bacon or ham would be wonderful.  I find it easier to bake these in the oven since I am making a larger batch.  400 degrees for 20 minutes or so, turning them about 3/4 of the way through seems to work fine.  Thanks for posting this recipe; I can't wait to try more combinations!

Excellent recipe! Mine were a little runny in the bowl, just added a little extra flour.  Fried up just fine. The first few were great as I ate them while cooking.  I added cayenne pepper to the rest and put them over the top!  Thank you for the recipe

This was simple and yummy! My toddler (who currently rejects ALL veggies) really liked them. squeezing out ALL the  water is really important. Also, I added some onion powder and doubled the garlic. I also used some salt substitute (Mrs. Dash) to add a bit more flavour. We'll do this again!

Excellent....I added a bit of bread crumbs and two extra cloves garlic...also added fresh ground black pepper and some cayenne pepper and chopped chives. Served with a bit of sour cream on the side.
Please note that draining the zucchini and squeezing with cheese cloth appears to be essential. 
Will make these again!

Changed it up just a teeny. Used two medium sized zucchini, a couple shredded carrots, and a 1/2 minced sweet onion. Also used coconut oil in lieu of olive oil. My husband keeps asking me to make the again. Yummy!

I can't believe this recipe doesn't have more reviews.  These are great as comfort food when drizzled (okay...doused) with real maple syrup.

Very good tasting. Easy recipe but the cook knows going into making zucchini fritters that it's going to be some work. I found a slightly easier way to drain the zucchini; put shredded zucchini in a medium colander over a plate, press the zucchini with a glass bowl slightly smaller than the colander. Empty the plate as needed. Four presses is all it took to dewater the zucchini. I also mixed in one summer squash with 3 zucchinis. Also, while shredding the zucchini, I cut about 8 small rounds and put them in the middle of each fritter just for fun. Sour cream or ranch dip is a favor enhancer as well. Thanks!

Turned out very nice. I used leftover boiled, sliced zuchinni that I smashed and squeezed dry as I could, then followed the recipe. I did add cayenne for a little heat, the man loved them....it was a good way to use up the squash. Thank you

These came out nicely. Next time I will add more cheese and garlic since they were a little bland. Also I made another batch with more egg plus dill weed and feta cheese. Very tasty.

They looked beautiful, easy to fry in one large skillet by moving the fritters to make room as they brown.  Too much garlic for us, and normally we love garlic.  I would like to try again with no garlic and maybe half cornmeal half flour instead.

These were just scrumptious! I had been given a huge zucchini and was looking for something to do with it and found this recipe. I used gluten free flour. I noticed some reviewers saying that it was too salty so left out the Kosher salt. I didn't have cheesecloth so just squeezed clumps of it by hand - worked just fine. You could also put it in a strainer and use a spoon to squeeze out the excess water. Since I'm allergic to eggs I replaced that with cheddar cheese. I don't know if that's what made them stick so bad to my non-stick pan, but I took another reviewers advice and rolled them around in flour. Then they turned out just great. My mother pronounced them "Delicious!" twice! We loved em!

Delicious! Like others have already shared, I also used whole wheat flour and I also added some whole wheat panko bread crumbs.

Delicious (the website) has this EXACT same recipe - she even uses the same descriptor "unbelievably easy to make, low calorie, and the perfect way to sneak in some veggies!"
Her recipe was posted April 2014, I can't find when this recipe went up but I find this to be so odd - what a coincidence, huh?

Way too salty. But otherwise delicious. Added yellow squash, onions, fresh sweet basil. Substituted coconut flour to make it Paleo. Even my big dog was begging for one of these! And they're great left over and warmed up as well. These are a really nice addition and monotony break to my diet. They are going to get made a LOT this summer!

Made these for a party and used the food processor to do all the grating. I almost doubled the recipe but didn't do perfect proportions, and it was totally fine - the ingredients are very forgiving. I added some cayenne and wish I'd added more. I also think they'd also be good with some shredded carrot thrown in. I'll be serving them with a yogurt, sour cream, garlic and dill sauce - yum.

Really great basic fritter recipe! I made a couple changes to mine: I put a little baking powder into three flour. I also added cheddar and a pinch of cayenne. Will totally make again.

used bread crumbs and just a little flour.  no need to salt first, just squeeze it between paper towels and hand towel to get the water out.  fried it with very little oil and it still browned..

I never leave reviews on recipes but I had to come back to review these. I absolutely loved them! I’ve tried a few different zucchini fritters recipes but these are the best by far. Draining the zucchini with a cheese cloth definitely makes a big difference, it helped them hold together perfectly. 

I had them with a Greek yoghurt and lemon sauce which just made it even better

Would definitely recommend!

love this recipe! I usually put the shredded zucchini in a cheese cloth and add salt to it to try to drain some of the water out. I also like to add a shredded carrot or two to add color/a little flavor to the fritters. it's delicious!

Turned-out very good for my first time. I used two eggs and a little more garlic (because I love garlic).  However, I think next time I'll stick with less garlic, because it was a little overwhelming.

I changed it up a bit.  2 zucchini and 4 small grated carrots, a few mushrooms finely diced and well as an iota of spinach.  I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 parmesan.  I added 1/2 of a finely diced red and orange pepper,  fresh cilantro and basil.  I need contrast of color and textures.  For spices I added paprika, cayenne, chili pepper, creole seasoning, southwest chipotle, and red pepper.  I used a remoulade sauce for the dipping.   So good!  I bit of a kick to the typical recipe but, I like things a little spicier.

Made no changes but really disliked taste and texture. Some moisture should be left in zucchini. I have made fritters for years just using zucchini a little onion salt and pepper and of course egg and flour. Really disliked addition of cheese and garlic. Never again

I first experienced zucchini fritters in Turkey and fell in love with them. When followed exactly, this recipe is a great recreation of those. I yielded about 10 or 12 medium sized fritters from this recipe and can't wait to make them again.

Made them yesterday to eat today.  Baked them in a 325 oven for 20 minutes.  Perfect. 
Needed more flavor, next time I'll add onions.

I just made this , simple , tasted good but too salty , I only added the 1/2 tsp salt , may be because of Parmesan , I love to make it again  but how do I make it that's not so salty ?

Great recipe.  Only thing I changed was no cheese, added onion that I grated as I grated the zucchini and used kirkland no sodium seasoning.  Excellent.  Squeezing was a great tip.

Used Whole Wheat flour instead of white flour and tasted excellent. I always add extra spices  according to my taste but this is definitely a great fritter just as indicated. This is a keeper!

Really easy to make and so delicious! The whole batch only lasted about five minutes, my husband and brother devoured them - luckily I grabbed a few as they were coming out of the pan.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this today and was disappointed. Definitely needs more flour for the amount of zucchini. The flavor was good, i added green onions and garlic powder rather than fresh. I just feel like it needed more consistency

This recipe was a good base.  Very bland, but everything "stuck" together pretty well.  I may try Corn meal to replace at least some of the flour next time.  I think it would add a bit of flavor as well.

I am not a fan of parmesan cheese but followed  the recipe as is. I did add a little more flour because I thought it looked too wet. Will make again without the cheese next time.

Great side dish! Everyone liked them. I will make them again. The only problem was getting the moisture out of the zucchini. I drained them for more then an hour but still had to use a kitchen towel to get all of the liquid out.

These are extremely good -we ate a lot of zucchini and loved every bite!  I made it just as the recipe said, except I read the reviews and didn't add any more salt.  Perfect  - and I'll be making these often!

So. Darn. Yummy.  
I've made this twice.   The first time, too salty.  The second time, I drained the zucchini in the kosher salt instead of the regular salt and then only added a little more kosher salt later in the recipe, "to taste."   Not as salty as the first time.  In fact, perfect.  I will be making this often.

Definitely will be making these again! They were so simple and quick to make, plus the whole family was in love with these.

I made them as a side dish but they would also be great as a snack.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was given and I have to say they were still missing something flavor wise for me. Don't get me wrong, I still very much enjoyed them but next time I make then I will probably add a little more seasoning to it to give it a little more flavor.

Outstanding recipe.  Made this for my partner who had previously had bad zucchini.  Totally changed their mind about it!  Success!

I made the recipe as written.  Really battled with water even though I drained as well as possible.  Turned out well and will make them again.

Didn't use cheese, but very super tasty anyway. When frying, need to add more oil so the fritters doesn't burn by the pan.

Made it vegan with substituting whipped aquafaba for eggs and my homemade vegan Parmesan cheese. SUPER GOOD!!!!!! *But* won't add the extra salt to the mix next time, just salt on the zucchini before squeezing. Easy!!!!!!

I did not drain/squeeze enough water out of the zucchini and because of that they didn't have a pleasant texture when I cooked them!  However they did have great flavor, I did not think they were too salty but I like salty things!  I need to give this another try and actually not skimp on properly preparing the zucchini.  A dipping sauce would also be fantastic and I like the idea of trying different seasonings/veggies/cheeses.

Great recipe to use if you have a garden that puts out more zucchini than you know what to do with. Actually this will be a top zucchini recipe for us from now on. Careful with the salt!

I didn't have kosher salt so I used regular  table salt. Came out great. Definitely gonna make these a part of the veggie/side dish rotation. Glad I found this recipe. Not sure if it was the temp in my stove top but needed more than 2 min on each side to get golden brown.

I made this without the grated cheese; no big loss.  If you control how dry and crispy the fritters turn out, it is like zucchini 'hash browns'.  I enjoyed how the garlic came through.

Tasty&healthy! Subbed vegan shreds & liquid egg white , skipped salt & garlic, used garlic salt. Followed instructions on moisture removal from zucchini, then just threw ingreds in bowl, mixed up & used 1/3 measuring cup to scoop into pan, flattened w/ spat. And done!

I just saw this recipe in a magazine in which we used to make these. These are great. they can become dry if patties are to thin. They went great with a dill dipping sauce from this site. Or ranch cucumber dip. Enjoy

These were great and healthy tasting.  The only thing I would do is make up a garlic aioli or something like that to have on the side.  I made them, they tasted great, next time I will do a side dipper or some cheese on top.

These had good flavor, but were very soggy.  Maybe I didn't get all of the water squeezed out?  They were starting to burn, so I couldn't really cook them any longer.  My kids dipped them in ranch dressing!

These were good and even good heated up.  I didn't fry them quit long enough or get the zucchini drained well enough, one or the other.  I will focus on both next time.  I also chose not to add the parmesan but added a little cayenne instead.

these were pretty good and a great use of the zucchini sitting around.  but they do take longer to cook than 2 min per side
