My husband is on Weight Watchers so I made this recipe with fat free zesty italian and fat free cream cheese and he thought it was GREAT!  It is only 6 points per 3 ounce serving of chicken, for any other weight watchers out there!

This was so good. I modified the recipe a bit. The other reviews talked about how it was too rich and didn't reheat very well, so I used 8 oz. of lite Velveeta in place of the cream cheese. It created a very creamy sauce that reheated very well. Also, I made it low-fat by using reduced fat soup and reduced calorie salad dressing. VERY tasty! I'm going to try it again and freeze it for a friend who just had a baby!

This came out very well!  I read all of the reviews first, so I added a few things.  First I cut the cooking time on the chicken, and shredded it, but left it rather chunky.  I added one whole can of chicken broth instead of a cup, and left simmering a little longer than an hour. (It wasn't dry AT ALL)
I added some frozen green beans and peas in that last hour.  Right before serving I stirred in some chopped, fresh cilantro...I had tasted it and it needed something, so I tried the cilantro and it was GREAT!  I served it over some stuffed ravioli I had in the freezer--it was mozzarella and spinach ravioli, and I topped it all off with the herb and cheese mixture the ravioli came with. All in all, it came out great...my husband and I both had seconds (thirds...).  ;o)
I loved the sauce!  Next time I'll try it with some chopped spinach mixed in...
THANKS!

This was very good.  I threw everything in at one and used frozen chicken breasts.  The cream cheese did not completely dissolve but I'm not picky.  My husb. said it was a little too cheesy for him but liked it otherwise.  Will make again.

THIS WAS A HUGE HIT for me and my 4 guests.  I put everything in the crockpot at once; added spoonfulls of the cream cheese into the sauce.  I used reduced fat dressing, reduced fat cream cheese, and the cream of chicken soup I used was not condensed.  Halfway through cooking, I stirred the sauce since the cream cheese didn't melt as well.  Around the 5th hour, I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and cooked for another hour.  PERFECT!

I made this w/ homemade dressing and I added a sliced onion which I cooked on low for 3 hrs. I drained it and added 1 can Herbed cr. of chick soup, an 8 oz. can of mushrooms w/ liquid, 1 teas. chick. soup base, and the 8 oz. cream cheese. FANTASTIC!!! Serve over rice {I like Jasmine or Basmati} or noodles!! I made my dressing using garlic red wine vinegar...

WOW! Moist, tender chicken pieces and tasty flavorful sauce. What more could we ask for. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I cut the Italian dressing to 4 ounces and didn't drain it off. Delicious over angel hair pasta, with green beans and spinach salad.This is a keeper for busy day with no time to cook. Thanks Monika.

This is very good. After thawing my chicken, I  found it only needed 4 1/2 hours to cook.  Then I added the sauce, which I made EXACTLY as the recipe called for, and I found it to be wonderful.  Yes, it's rich, but I guess I like rich foods.  I can't stop tasting it and I've still got to serve it over rice for dinner!

i was gone all day, so i kept it on low for almost 10 hours!  it was still tasty!  i had my husband add fresh green beans about 1 1/2 hours before we ate.  they were still a bit crunchy, i like them that way!  i also had baby portabellas in with the chicken.  i forgot the cream cheese, and only used 1/2 cup of dressing.
served it over penne pasta~

This recipe was a hit at our house.  I took a chance and made it for the first time for company. I made a few minor adjustments. I used the whole can of chicken broth and only used 1 cup of italian dressing. I used frozen chicken tenderloins and cut them in half.  I didn't drain the salad dressing.  I put all of the ingredients in the crock pot at once, including the cream cheese and let it cook all day. I also added about 1 cup of frozen chopped onion.  The end result was very "white" so I used tri-colored rotini pasta and topped each serving with green onion. Everyone went back for seconds and our company wanted the recipe to try at home. Great crock pot recipe!

Love this recipe!  My whole family loves it.  I make a huge batch of it & they eat it all up, which is unusual!  I make this on a regular basis because it is so easy & the ingredients are what I have on hand!  Thanks for the great new way to prepare chicken!!!!!  Oh, I do use low fat cream cheese, soup and dressing & it is still wonderful!  I Do NOT drain the liquid from the crockpot either.  We drained it the 1st time & it was dry.  We have made it without draining it several times & love it that way!

My husband and I love this recipe!  It's delicious and so easy.  I have made it several times.  I find it easier to cut the chicken in half-inch cubes rather than shredding it.  This makes it more like a stroganoff, too.  During the last hour, I've added cut-up sun dried tomatoes and fresh asparagus (blanched in the microwave for a couple of minutes and cut into one-inch pieces).  It's fabulous!  Next time I'm going to try canned, drained artichoke hearts in place of the asparagus.  Thank you, Monika, for a great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good for how easy it is... One thing I did was mix up my sauce in the morning when I put the chicken in the slow cooker.  I zapped the cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds just to soften it and used a mixer to blend the canned soup, cream cheese, broth, & seasonings because I quickly realized it would be lumpy if I didn't.  Then all I had to do to finish it that evening was drain the chicken, shred it and return it to the slow cooker with my pre-mixed sauce. I used sundried tomato italian style dressing and thought this was good enough to make again.

This was easy and delicious. I skipped the cream of chicken soup and just added heavy cream with a little extra chicken broth. It still turned out great and since I made the dressing from scratch too, the whole dish was from scratch and super healthy (no preservatives or other nasties). We had it on WW noodles to make it even healthier with sauteed spinach on the side. Even the kids ate it! :)

I made a few changes to the orignal recipe--but boy was this deeeelicious!!  I only used 1 cup of italian dressing so I didn't have to drain any off later.  I also added all the ingredients except the cream cheese at the beginning and left the chicken in chunks instead of shredding.  I know it sounds like I made lots of changes, but the taste shouldn't have altered much at all from them.  Anyway,  this was definetly one I will make again and again!!!!

Two thumbs up! I had to make my own italian dressing because I didn't have any in the house (olive oil, red wind vinegar, basil, oregeno, salt, pepper, garlic powder). I didn't have chicken broth on hand so used two bouillon cubes in cup of water. I followed the recipe exactly....except maybe didn't use all of dressing you called for. I'm not sure what people are talking about reducing the cream cheese- I'm glad I didn't (I used the whole bar). Make sure you leave all the juices and dressing in the crock pot so after the one hour of sauce on top of your chicken you mix it all together then pour over rice. Yum! My kids and hubby all RAVED! Excellent as leftovers too (having some now for lunch). For dinner I served over rice- for lunch right now I added some leftover whole cranberry sauce on the side without rice- a tasty combo. This recipe is a keeper in my house! Thanks for posting it :0)

This is a great recipe! I loved the way the chicken was cooked with the Italian salad dressing! Once again I tested this on my fussy husband and he really liked it.  I found the 8 oz of cream cheese to be a bit much - next time I will cut in half, and keep a little more of the juices.  If you don't try this recipe with the cream sauce at least try cooking the chicken with the salad dressing - it is fabulous! a great start to chicken salad or chicken a la king! I brought the leftovers in to work today and I had to print off 5 copies of the recipe for some of my co-workers!!! It was a hit!

Surprisingly good! I wasn't sure about the ingredients but it worked out well and had a lot of flavor. I used the Italian Seasonings packet and mixed the ingredients for it in the slow cooker (made with white vinegar and canola oil). I added all the ingredients except the cream cheese at the beginning with the chicken breasts. At the end, I did like the recipe said and added the cream cheese and let it cook for an hour. Served over egg noodles and it was great. I think the egg noodles is the perfect pasta match for this.

I really enjoyed this but DH didn't care for it...he's picky about creamy foods though. I think next time I'll add some diced mushrooms to it. I was very surprised how TENDER the chicken was even though I used frozen chicken breasts!!! In fact cooking them in the italian dressing gave them a great marinated taste and I'd probably serve them as is!!! Thanks so much Monika, this is a great recipe!

I cooked on high for 3 hrs, removed chicken to a plate and cut up.  Blended the cream cheese in hot broth with a mixer, added soup, chicken broth, and 1/2 cup of white wine. Put all back in crock pot for another 1-1.5 hrs.  Served over noodles or penne. Great.

VERY Tasty!  I used only about a cup of dressing (fat free), and a full can of chicken broth to cook the chicken breasts.  After the chicken was cooked, I drained (but saved) the juice, and shredded it. I used cream of mushroom (what I had on hand) and used velveeta (2% milk) in place of the cream cheese, left out the other seasonings.  I used the chicken stock/italian dressing juice to cook the rice.  It came out very nice.  Chicken was not dry at all (4 hours on low, and another hour mixed together).  I added a small amount of shreded cheddar to each kids' plate.  They gobbled it up and asked for seconds (which is rare in this house! lol!)  I'll definitely be making this dish again!  And it's so easy!!!!

This is my husband's favorite recipe! I love that it's so easy. I always use frozen breasts and shred the chicken after cooked. I serve this over rice, then combine leftovers with rice and broccoli and put it in the freezer as a casserole for later. Excellent!

I got the breasts going in the slow cooker, left for the day and had my 14 yr old daughter finish the meal.  Because other reviews said it was rich, I had her use 3 oz of cream cheese, she also added a can of drained mushrooms and served it over noodles.  We all loved it and will make it again, we cubed the chicken instead of shredding it.

After reading some reviews I wasn't sure if I should try this recipe. I put frozen, boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins in the crock pot with the Italian dressing and cooked them on low for 3 hours. Microwaved the cream cheese for 30 seconds to soften and mixed in all the ingredients, adding 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and reducing the chicken broth to 1/4 cup. Poured it into the crock pot and stirred. Let cook another 5 hrs. on low. Served over spaghetti. The sauce was a little thin but very tasty. I will be making this again.

I've tried this recipe twice now. The first time exactly as written which is my four star rating. 

The second time I tried to cut back on the calories using greek yogurt instead of cream cheese. To use the yogurt, place it in cheesecloth over a strainer in your fridge for 2hrs. or more. If you do not have cheesecloth, use coffee filters! Also, I used Dorot frozen chopped basil which comes in little trays to be used in sauces as needed. (It gives the fresh taste of basil!) I give my version a four star, too :)

EXCELLENT!! A home-run for me and the man. I didnt drain the juices so I left the chicken broth out fearing that it would be too runny. I also used Italian seasoning keeping with the theme and added garlic and onion powder. So good thx for the recipe!

I made this last night for the second time. I cooked the chicken just as written. After about 6 hours, I took the still hot chicken from the crock pot one at a time and shreded them with 2 forks as written in the recipe. They fall apart so easily, shredding chicken is not usually this quick. Then I mixed all the other ingredients in a pyrex bowl and zapped them in the microwave for a minute or two so I could stir them up really good. It really made a difference. I served this on top of noodles and I sauted some mushroom to put on top. Turned out great.

The cream cheese I was weary of but it adds just the right amount of zing to it! The picture shows the chicken cubed instead of shredded, which I would have done since the chicken and sauce become a big sloppy mess over the noodles, but it was tasty.

I finally found a truly easy, truly tasty chicken dish!!  My whole family liked it.  I made these changes:
I cut the breast halves in thirds, put them with the salad dressing in the crock pot and cooked on HI for about five hours. Also, I did not shred the chicken. I used hot chicken broth, and I added the cream cheese mixture to the crock pot and left it on high for only about thirty minutes.  It was great and so, so easy!

I accidentally left the Italian dressing with the chicken and added the cream cheese mixture to it.  The flavors were a bit overwhelming and didn't do anything for me.  I didn't shred the chicken either and wouldn't if I made it again.

This is a great recipe from start to finish! I used an Italian dressing that had parmesan and herbs in it, so I only added a bit of basil, and no thyme.  I used a can of chicken broth, with I think is a bit more than the recipe called for. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The cream cheese adds the perfect "tang" to it, and it is excellent as leftovers! I served it with egg noodles the first time, and the leftovers with rice. Excellent with both, and you just can't beat a recipe that starts with frozen chicken! Even my oldest son (an extremely picky eater), liked this! This one goes in the "make again" pile!

We enjoyed this one.  I did add in mushrooms and onion and also increased the amount of cream cheese while adding in more broth.  We served it over egg noodles with peas.  Next time I will try adding artichokes.

I did try this recipe and thought it was okay and so did the rest of my family. We had leftovers so the next day I added a defrosted bag of peas, carrots and corn mix to the chicken and sauce. I also sauted about a 1/4 cup onions and added that to the mix.  I then took out about 4 6 inch ramikins and sprayed them with cooking spray. I defrosted a ready-made pie crust. I rolled out the crust and made 4 individual crusts. I lined the crusts in the bottom of the ramikin and filled with the mixture. I placed another crust on top and used a fork edge to put the crust together. I made 4 small slits in the top to vent. I brushed with egg washing and baked for about 30 minutes, at about 400,  or until crusts were flaky and golden. This was the most delicious chicken pot pie filling I have ever tasted.

This recipe was super yummy.  I changed it a little after reading some of the comments.  To make it a little healthier, I used fat free Italian dressing and reduced fat cream cheese.  I also reduced the cooking time.  I cooked the chicken and dressing on low for just 4 1/2 hours then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked for another hour.  It was super easy and tasty.  My boyfriend and I loved it...he actually ate the leftovers and he often isn't very enthusiastic about eating leftovers!  Next time, I may add some broccoli at the end.

This rocked! made a few tweaks but stuck to it as close as possible. :) Partially defrosted chicken partially, wish i had done so completely. Around the 7 hr mark cut up the chicken to soak in the dressing. for the last hour on high with cream cheese (i put it in chunks spread around to help it melt) we also added frozen corn. Poured it over bow shaped noodles, served with Texas Toast. Hubby said it was repeat worthy. :) next time will double the dressing and increase the chicken from 3 pieces to the full amount. the sauce was lacking in chicken but i was worried about having too much. still have lots for leftovers :) Thank you for sharing this excellent dish! :)

This recipe is just as the title states: Easy and Delicious! I put my slow cooker on high and it decreased the cooking time of the chicken to about 3.5 hours. My family loved it, we served over brown rice--my husband even took leftovers for his lunch and he never eats leftovers!

My friend came over the other day with this recipe for my new crock pot. Little did she know that I had made it already the night before. Delicious! I would have cut down the cream cheese (too rich). I added vegetables (broccoli and mushrooms) and used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. It was very good!

I love this recipe.  I do not add the cream cheese since I am lactose intollerant.   This is a great quick recipe to just toss in the crockpot in the morning on a busy day.

A tasty crock pot recipe.  I used a couple teaspoons of italian seasoning instead of the listed herbs.  Also used only 4 oz of cream cheese and it was definitely rich enough.  Added some seasoned salt but think I would leave it out next time as I always forget how salty the salad dressing and soup are.  Added a can of mushrooms.

I love this stuff! I used all fat free or reduced fat ingredients and it was still wonderful! I even mixed in some of the juices drained to make it a little thinner. We tried it over yolk free noodles and reduced fat buttermilk biscuits. We liked it both ways. I just had leftovers for lunch and still yummy!This will definitely be a repeat in our home!

This is one of our Family Favorites. I like using the Good Season's Italian Vinaigrette with EVOO. Then when it is time to add the cream cheese mixture, I shred the chicken and add 1 cup of prepared white rice.  We put it on hamburger buns. It is also great for a potluck.

This is a wonderful recipe but one thing I do different is to not drain the juices after removing the chicken.  I just add all the ingredients to the juice and it is much tastier and not as dry.  It's great over rice!

This is a very well-named dish. It was super easy and super tasty. I didn't have and rice or pasta on hand (day before grocery day) but it was fine on its own. A little too saucy to be served alone though, so I'd recommend rice or maybe egg noodles. One warning: this LOOKED disgusting. I wouldn't serve it to people who doubt your cooking skills or kids who are still in the "it looks funny so I won't eat it" phase. It was delicious however, and I'm definitely making it again, maybe adding some veggies to the pot next time before that final hour of cooking. (Fiancee's idea - he thought celery would be a nice addition.)

Be sure to drain all the italian dressing completely and start over w/ shredded chicken & cream sauce.  It's a tasty dish and very similar to tuna cassarole.

I'd only give this recipe 3 stars for when I seved it over egg noodles.  It was ok, but not great.  But, the leftovers were phenominal:  I used the chicken to fill corn tortillas which I then covered with a quick sour cream, mushroom, and spinach sauce.  I baked it for about 20 minutes at 350, and it was super.  This was a very good chicken recipe to use for as a base for Mexican-type chicken in sour cream sauce recipes.

This is an excellent recipe. It tastes like you put a lot of time into making it but it definitely one of the easiest dishes I have ever made. My family likes it served over rice (even my two toddlers eat it) It is a favorite comfort food in our house.

My husband loved this. He told me I have to make it again. He thought it was tuna casserole. When I told him it was chicken he was amazed that it was so tender. I did not like the apperance. It looked like mush. I served it over rice. I did not like the smell. I thight the taste was o.k. Next time for better apperance I won't shred the chicken.

I've made plenty of recipes from this site but never felt moved to write a review until now.  My family LOVED this meal.  I served it over rice and they chowed down.  I didn't even have leftovers!  My 7-year-old son is the pickiest eater and he had two helpings.  I made it just like the recipe said with all the ingredients and it was fantastic.  My husband is on a low carb diet and he ate it without the rice and kept raving about how good it was, helping after helping.  It really blew me away.  This one is definitely a keeper from now on.

Very good dinner. I followed the recipe to the letter (except I used a whole can of chix broth instead of just 1 cup) and we were very pleased with the results. Served over angel hair pasta and sprinkled some parsley over each dish for some color. Thanks!

My teenage son loved this!!  I did it with the frozen chix. I added extra broth, approx 14.5 oz (one can).  It did make it thinner but not by a bunch.  Plus the kids had more gravy to use on their noodles.  ps. the whole crock was gone before I could get seconds.

This is very good.  I only used half the amount of cream cheese, and it was still plenty rich for me.  Would be even better with some sauted celery and onions.  I cut the chicken in halves or thirds, cranked the crock pot up to high, and it was ready within three hours.

Very good flavor. Made a few modifications based upon what I had in my pantry. I used cream of onion soup, reduced fat cream cheese, lite Caesar dressing(not the creamy kind), substituted 1tsp italien seasonings and added a 1/4 tsp turmeric. Instead of chicken broth I used the reduced sodium knorr chicken stock. After cooking chicken on low for 5 hours, drained off most of the liquid. In saucepan I melted the remaining ingredients before adding to crockpot. This way the cream cheese wasn't lumpy and was fully incorporated with the seasonings.

I didn't have any Italian salad dressing, so I used Balsamic dressing and it was delicious!  The chicken was a little dry, so next time I would cook it for less tie and not drain off the liquid.  I added frozen broccoli florets the last hour.  Next time I'd use green beans or peas.

I will admit that I didn't follow the directions exactly but this was really good.  

I ended up baking this in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes.  I omitted the chicken broth completely.  Instead of dressing and then sauce, I took a creamy italian dressing (about 1/4C) and the remaining ingredients and whisked them together thoroughly in a bowl.  Then poured over the chicken and baked.  I stirred the sauces once about halfway through.  And seasoned it up more at the end (we're heavy on the seasoning in most things).  Good reviews from everyone (including a 5 & 9yo)

The was very simple, I used frozen Chicken breat and did not thaw.  Cooked on low for about 10 hours...the chicken alone smelled wonderful.  I did soften the cream cheese for 20 seconds in the microwave...I am used to cooking with creamcheese. It was flavorful but very rich definaltely need a little something else.  I think next time I will add mushrooms and broccoli.

Not impressed with this. The cream cheese never mixed completely and the mixture of Italian dressing with the soup just didn't taste right at all. It's a take out night for us!

This is my go to "fall" recipe when the leaves start to change! The only change I make to the basic recipe is instead of first marinading the chicken in the bottled dressing, once all of the ingredients are in the slow cooker I mix in one enevelope of the Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix. stir it in and you have a great flavor throughout, not just on the chicken. Then I add a couple things to the recipe for my taste. I like to add  1 1/2-2 C frozen mixed vegetables (I thaw first). My go-to combo is corn-carrots-1' cut green beans. Some times I add a variety of fresh mushrooms, maybe some brocolli. You can make everyone happy whith this meal. It makes it a more rounded one dish meal with the vegetables added. I serve it over a wild rice mixture or spoon it over a split baked potato. My favorite way is while it is in the slow cooker I make the "French Bread to Die For" recipe from this site. I make that recipe into "bread bowl" size rolls. To serve the chicken, I scoop out the "bread bowl" leaving about 1/2' along the edge, then fill it with a heaping ladle of the chicken recipe! Everyone I have served it to like that just loves it.  I have not had a problem with the cream cheese not melting, but one tip for a better re-heat the next day is to heat it a little longer on low heat that zap it on HI in the microwave.  This recipe is so worth a try as is before completely changing it.

I love this recipe. The only thing I changed was to add the whole can of chicken broth so there was even more of that yummy sauce! What a joy to come home after work and have dinner mostly made. Even DH, who is a bit picky, called dibs on the little bit of leftovers for his lunch next day. Thanks for the great recipe.

I picked this recipe because of the reviews that said they're children all loved it. Not once did I have to say "eat your dinner" They LOVED it! My husband and I also enjoyed it. I followed the directions exactly, except all I had was bone in, skin on, chicken breasts. I put it on angel hair, and it gave the heavy cream sauce a light texture in my mouth.  My husband put cajun seasoning on his seconds, to give it a kick, and enjoyed it as a whole different meal. This is a keeper!

I forgot to drain the dressing/juices and just mixed everything else in with it. It was still really good. It made for a thin sauce, but I served it over rice and everyone liked it! I sauteed some broccoli to go with it and we had a great meal. Thanks!

My family and co-workers LOVE this recipe! The only changes I have made is that I use a package of dry Italian salad dressing mix instead of the bottled and add a little bit of broth when I slow cook the chicken. Followed everything else except I don't like thyme so I added some garlic powder in its place and substituted reduced-fat cream cheese. I've never had a problem with reheating in the microwave - never even had to add liquid.

An okay recipe, but most likely won't be making it again.  The flavor was just a little off the mark for us.  The chicken was so tender that I was unable to lift an entire breast piece out of the crock pot without it shredding.  I made no additions or substitutions to this recipe.  The only alteration I made was to add all ingredients at once except for the cream cheese which I added during the last hour of cooking.  I had no trouble with clumpy bits of cream cheese because I brought mine to room temp., dropped it in by the spoonfuls, and then whisked everything together (minus the chicken which I removed to shred) until it was mixed well.
EDITED ONE DAY LATER:  I am actually changing my rating on this from 3 stars to 2 stars... a first for me.  Another reviewer said her husband asked if this was tuna casserole, and I couldn't imagine how he could draw the comparison.  Today (one day after making this) I know exactly how he could confuse the two... it looks and smells exactly like tuna casserole.  I can't bring myself to eat it again.

I did not care for this recipe at all! Extremely dry and bland. I only changed it by halving the cream cheese as others suggested. I'm going to try to save the leftovers by making soup out of it.

This one is a "keeper"!  The only thing I had to do different from the recipe was that I had to use cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of the plain cream of chicken because I was out of that.  Personally, I can't imagine modifying the recipe any more than that though because it is DELICIOUS!

Where has this recipe been all my life?!?! It just melts in your mouth! Sometimes chicken recipes can wind up so lifeless and this is just the right combo. I followed the instructions exactly - except I used less chicken. I'll be serving this over rice tonight. I keep sampling it w/ a wheat thin and I can't stop eating it!!!

I did not care for this recipe. It sounded great. I had all the makings, but it looks inedible. I had to keep adding things to make it worthy to eat. I will never make it again. It was too thick and tasteless. It could be salvaged for the makings of a enchilada. If you decided to make this GOOD LUCK!!

This is really an easy recipe...just throw it in before work...I not only drain the dressing, I rinse the breast before shredding as my family doesn't like the 'twang' left behind...but it the dressing does a great job of making the breasts tender.  I use more cream cheese than called for.  Perfect over rice...don't forget to add the spices.  My entire family LOVES this...and I most of the time really cook for them...not 'cheating' meal...but good gormet meals...so they're pretty spoiled...and still loved it.  Thanks for the keeper.

My family really enjoyed this.  I loved the chicken just after baking in the dressing!  I used half chicken broth, half juices from the crockpot and only 1/2 package of cream cheese and cubed the chicken instead of shredding.  I made sure to stir up the cheese with the broth and soup before adding to the chicken so it wouldn't be clumpy.  I served it over whole wheat spaghetti.  Even my picky 3 year old gobbled it up.  I will make again.

My family loved this.  The chicken was SO tender.  I cut up 1 sweet onion and cooked it with the chicken & italian dressing.  I only removed 3/4 of the dressing once the chicken was done cooking.  I served it with home made mashed potatoes & green beans.  My 2 year old who doesn't like much of anything ate it right up.  To be so good, it was so easy to make.  It will be a regular in our home for sure. THANKS!

I think this is a great recipe! It is one of my favorites, actually. I like to add a splash of white wine to the mix and a couple cloves of garlic, as well as some milk to thin the sauce out a bit at the end.

My husband liked this but I have yet to come across something he doesn't like.  I found the taste of the Italian dressing to be overwhelming and I didn't like the chicken at all.  The sauce on the noodles was pretty good but the chicken was just to sharp.  Maybe a milder flavor of dressing would help, but I only used Wishbone... not sure how much more plain you can get.  I doubt I will be making this again.

We loved this!It was so easy and my kids loved it! We added 1 or 2 more chicken breasts to the recipe to make it a little more meaty. We served it on hamburger buns and made sandwiches! They were great.

This was excellent. I served it over rice, and next time may throw in some frozen veggies too for some color. It was delicious for a cold winter night. One warning: I used a balsamic dressing and it was way too strong of a flavor-- use regular italian dressing, it does make a difference! :)

I enjoyed smelling this cook all day long! I had such faith in this recipe after reading many reviews, that when I went to the store to get ingredients, I gave my extra copy of the recipe to the checkout-clerk!  

My family really liked it too and both my husband and daughter can be picky. I did add just a little of the juices (my guess is about 1/4-1/2 cup) just to add a little extra of that Italian flavoring.

Overall, this is a very easy, very tasty recipe.  I served it over rice the first night and my husband loved it (he normally hates rice!).  I served the leftovers over egg noodles the next night and it was still good, but reminded me of tuna casserole.  I didn't drain the italian dressing as the recipe suggested, however when I make it again, I think I will--it was just too soupy!  This is definitely a keeper!  Easy and tasty slow cooker food! MMMM!
UPDATED 8/7/07: I now add peas and diced carrots to this dish for the last 30 minutes (when I add the cream cheese and cream of mushroom soup). I don't use the chicken soup as that seems to give it a funny aftertaste. This is still one of my hubby's favorite comfort foods.

Very delicious and very easy.  I can mess up most receipes, but I not this one!  Very worth trying!  I substituted one can of cream of mushroom soup for the chicken broth and added a small can of mushrooms.  I used everything LOW FAT and non-fat cream cheese and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband loved it and so did it!  Made lots of nice gravy just the right consistance for over rice.  GREAT!!!  YUM!

This recipe was easy, but unfortunately it was not delicious.  I like all of the ingredients in it and it sounded good, and got great reviews from everyone, but it was just disappointing. It may have been too much cream cheese or it was the basil and thyme.  The italian dressing didn't give as much flavor as I'd hoped.  Oh well.  Better luck next time.

This is a very good recipe for using chicken breasts in the crock pot. It is comfort food.   I drained off all but about 3/4 cup of italian dressing.  I also added the whole can of chicken broth since I thought the mixture was a bit thick.  I liked the addition of basil and thyme, I wouldn't leave that out.  Served over rice.  I've made it twice in the last two weeks and my family of 5 always has leftovers for the next day.  One of very few meals all three kids will eat.  It is a bit white so I sprinkled some parsley on top.  Green onions is another good suggestion from a previous reviewer.  I made it for company last night and served with a beautiful green salad, home made rolls and fruit salad.

Absolutely delicious! My 2 year old loved it and has eaten the leftovers for two days now. I left in about a cup of the dressing instead of adding the water. I served it over colored rotini after reading other reviews. This is definitely a keeper recipe and will make again. Cooked it with thawed chicken for 3 hours on high and then 1/2 hr after adding the rest. Thanks for a great crock pot recipe

A really nice alternative to everyday chicken. It was similar to using gravy but a little better. We had it over orzo pasta and it was really good! This would be good on rice too I bet. We will do it again! It's a really good winter dish.

I used bone-in breasts and reduced the initial cooking time to 4 hours as chicken tends to dry out in the slow cooker.  I also added sauteed mushrooms and onions with the shredded chicken and cooked for an additional hour.  I then added a healthy splash of dry cocktail sherry and a cup of frozen peas.  Wrapped in puff pastry, baked in 375 oven for 35 minutes and the outcome was delicious! Lori

Liked this alot and made it as directed with the exception of adding mushrooms and onions. Wonderful flavor. Have been doing alot of driving back and forth to tend to an elderly parent and this recipe has been a godsend. Thanks so much for sharing.

I found this to be delicious!  I do admit though, that it is a bit tangy (italian dressing) but the very tender chicken is just to die for!!  I also think you could cut back on cooking time, I cooked mine on low for 4 hours and still very tender chicken and delicious!

Um-mmmmmmm.  Everyone in my family just loved this receipe and said I should make it more often.  I used less cream cheese (about 4 oz) as others suggested, and used Fat-Free Caesar dressing (because I had no Italian).  I didn't have the 6 hours to wait for the frozen chicken to cook in the slow cooker, but it didn't matter.  The chicken was still very good; it just didn't fall apart as easy.  I'll be making this one a lot!

After reading all the reviews I made a lot of changes.  I was having company and got nervous about the bad reviews.  What I did turned out great!  I used about 1/4 of the amount of cream cheese and wisked it together with cream of mushroom and 2 cups of broth.  I then added it all together in the slow cooker.  It was runny but perfect to cover the rice I served it with.

My family and I really didn't care for this dish...We reduced the recipe to 1/2 the cream cheese, and disposed of all of the italian dressing, but it was still sour and very filling.  It looked gross too!

Great recipe!  I used frozen chicken tenders and threw in cooked egg noddles at the end.  What a delight...my husband, who can be picky, LOVED IT!!!  Makes for great leftovers too!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is probably the WORST chicken recipe I've ever made.  My children likened it to "something the dog threw up," and my husband is at Burger King finding something quick to serve them for dinner.  Beware!!

Made this recipe tonight while making quite a few adjustments after reading other reviewers comments. I used all the exact same ingredients for the sauce listed above, instead I put them all in together at the beginning, which means the italian dressing never got drained. The italian dressing added a bit of zesty ness to it, and because the cream cheese was added at the beginning, it really blended/melted into the sauce smoothly. Because of the extra liquid (italian dressing) being in the pot, I had to thicken up the sauce, all I had was flour at the time, so added about a quarter cup which did the trick. A lot of people mentioned adding vegetables, all I had was a bag of steam mixed veggies, carrots, broccoli, red pepper and corn. I cooked them in the microwave and added these about a hour before serving,

The result was amazing, almost like a chicken pot pie soup. I used 2 lbs of frozen chicken breasts and shredded them when I added the veggies, 5 hours in, total cooking time on low was 6 hours. I would NOT recommend allowing this to cook for the recipes time of 9 hours unless your using chicken thighs. Breasts would've been way to dried out by then. I served this dish with mashed potatoes, a perfect comfort food dinner for a cold chicago night after shoveling snow all day.

I made this the first time for company .    I too put everything except the crem cheese in at once. Only drained a little of the drsg off.  last hr put in cream cheese.  I also had problems with it  melting. But this was delicious everyone loved it   I served it over anglehair  pasta .  Next time I make this I will microwave the cream  cheese so it's melted before adding it.

This is one of my GO TO recipes on busy days. The house smells so good all day- and it tastes so good when its done! I've made as is- and it is 5 stars. I like to add broccoli as it is served as well for some green!
We serve over linguine. any pasta or rice will do! Hard to mess this one up!

Delicious!!  I followed pretty close but did use Velveeta in place of cream cheese.  Added a little garlic and to quicken the last step, I cooked in a pot the mix, melted in all the cheese with....then poured over chicken and let simmer in crock about 20-30 minutes!!!  Everyone even my 7 year old loved it!!

This was delicious! My husband loved it too... only thing I changed was using the whole can of broth, which made for a thinner sauce. Served over white rice with veggies on the side.

I made this as instructed and it came out perfect.  I served over rice.  

The only thing I did different was #3.  I had cooked the chicken in the italian dressing in the crockpot and had to cook the rest over the stove the next day and it was fine!

We thought this was very good served over whole wheat broad noodles and with these variations: Sun dried tomato vinaigrette dressing instead of italian, and I reduced the cream cheese a bit. After the chicken cooked, I transferred the sauce to a pan and added water/flour mixture to thicken. At the very end I tossed in some leftover roasted veggies I had on hand (squash, zucchini & onions). Very, very flavorful!

Our family thoroughly enjoyed this simple meal. To incorporate the cream cheese a little easier, I microwaved the sauce ingredients for a bit, and then stirred well before adding to the chicken. I'll definitely be adding this to the rotation!

Fantastic! After reading other reviews, I cut down the italian dressing to 6 oz, used a full can of chicken broth, fat free cream cheese, reduced fat cream of chicken soup, fat free chicken broth, and omitted the salt and pepper (enough sodium already with the broth and soup). I poured everything (well mixed of course) over the frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot. Throw and go dinners are my favorite. Served with brown rice and steamed green beans.  Will definitely make it again!!

I made this exactly by directions, and we weren't happy with it. The taste wasn't terrible, but the flavor was odd and the tangy Italian dressing-marinated chicken and creamy chicken soup & cream cheese really didn't work together. We finished about half of it, but we ended up throwing the rest of it out and discarding the leftovers, because it was very unpleasant.

Used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Removed & drained the Italian liquid but did not shred, they are falling apart on their own by the end. Added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to soup mixture. Rinsed & thawed frozen peas and topped after adding the soup mix & cooked the final hour. If you use breasts & cut them in half you can avoid the shredding step. Serve w/biscuits or over noodles. Yum, this is REAL comfort food.  Did not find it to be vinegary at all because that was discarded.

This was super easy to make and it smelled delicious... but the italian dressing really didn't go with the other flavors.  My daughters and I ate it, but my husband could barely choke down one helping.  Maybe it would be better without the dressing...

terrific flavor!  i put all the ingredients in at once with the FROZEN chicken.  i used reduced fat cream cheese & a light zesty italian.  i cooked it on low for 7 hours then shredded the chicken and set the crockpot on WARM until we were ready for dinner about 2 hours later.  i served it over brown rice.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! Instead of using the chicken broth, we just poured the juices that were in the crock pot into the mixture and back onto the chicken. It gave it a little more of the Italian dressing flavoring. Otherwise we followed the recipe exactly. Served it with Jasmine rice cooked with a chicken bouillon cube. They go perfect together! This will be a new regular at our house!

I thought this was really good and my family liked it too.  The Italian dressing in the slow cooker was a nice touch and it was great not to have to thaw the chicken.  Super easy and yummy.

I followed the recipe with all no-fat or low-fat ingredients.  I don't think that was what was so wrong about this.  It was the italian dressing taste and the cream cheese taste.

While this was certainly easy to prepare, I wouldn't call it delicious....more like "okay".  It didn't have much flavor and was kind of gooey.  While this recipe wasn't horrible, I won't be making it again.

This was an easy and delicious chicken.  I followed exactly except used bone in chicken breasts.  It is very rich, so you don't need too much.

This was great! However, I don't believe I would serve it to company because of it's looks. When I placed it in front of my hubby he asked if it was tuna casserole!? He did enjoy the taste. I only used 1/2 the cream cheese and I made sure to stir up the cheese with the broth and soup before adding to the chicken so it wouldn't be clumpy. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti. I will definitely make again. Thank you!

I doubled the spices. I also added a medium onion, chopped small to the first step with the chicken and Italian dressing. During the last step, I added a package of frozen, broccoli florets. It was quite good.

My husband and I both liked the recipe.  We feel it would be a good party/buffet dish.  We also plan on adding a vegetable mix like peas and carrots in it the last hour with the other ingredients.  If you use frozen,  I would suggest running warm water of vegetables first to thaw before adding to crock pot.   I made brown rice on the side to go with it.

I always follow this recipe exactly, and it comes out perfect every time.  We serve it over white rice (which I make with leftover chicken broth.)  What's great is that IF there are any leftovers, the flavors mingle and are even better the next day!  This is a recipe that my entire family (including 3 kids under 6) loves.

Yummy!  We thought it tasted like Chicken Lasagna without the vegetables.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have any thyme - it was still great!  It didn't look pretty, but we didn't mind.

This one is not a keeper.  No one in the family cared for this bland tasting recipe.  Several of the adults, including myself, added Mrs. Renfro's jalapeno green salsa to our servings to at least make it interesting.

My family really disliked this - and they are not picky eaters. For me, it was too much work to be "easy" and not all that "delicious". It was unappealing to look at and the taste was odd. Slow cooking one of the easiest meats to cook (boneless skinless breasts) just doesn't make sense. I could have made something much more delicious in the time it took to prep this. Won't make this again.

My husband and I loved this how it is.  We ate it over spaghetti noodles.  However, the next day after refrigerating the leftovers, my husband commented that it was even better cold withouth the pasta.  I then tried it on a toasted bagel and thought it was AMAZING!!!  This gives "chicken salad" a new twist.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a break from using the oven in hot weather and enjoys a great chicken salad.

Very good. I left the italian dressing and juices in the mix instead of adding the chicken broth. A little tangy but very good. I can see how substituting the chicken broth would lessen the flavor. I served over cooked spaghetti noodles. Overall, a good recipe. I would make this again.

Tasty and easy recipe.  I cut the chicken breasts into cubes, and used slightly less Italian dressing and added chili-garlic sauce and hot sauce in its place.  And I used 3/4 of the cream cheese.  Turned out great - I served it over whole wheat pasta with grilled asparagus.

This is my FAVORITE slow-cooker recipe (and it looks like many others too!).  It is great served over whole wheat fettucini or brown rice.  Your house will smell amazing when you walk in the  door to this slow-cooker dish!

My 7 year old said, I thought this would be disgusting, but is not, it's delicious!!  She was right, this is so easy, and pleases the entire family.  We added some chow-mein noodles on top for crunch.  We are having this once a week.  I have tried it on top of rice and spaghetti, and we prefer the spaghetti!  Thanks for a very easy recipe!!

This recipe was SOOO good. My VERY picky boyfriend loved it.

I added green peppers, black olives and served over egg noodles. Oh, I used cream of chicken soup with herbs, not regular.

Overall, delicious. Chicken just fell apart.

For those of you who said Italian dressing was overpowering, I'm guessing you forgot to drain it. Because you couldn't really taste it. Make sure you drain that before mixing it up.

My kids and husband loved it. I had to add about 1/2 cup of skim milk, as it got too thick in the last hour of cooking. It was a bit too rich for my taste. I will definitely make it again...majority rules!

We enjoyed this.  I too added a bit more chicken.  Even after the salt/pepper, it still needed a bit of love.  So bring on the garlic powder.  Everyone really enjoyed, I will be making it again.  Made tons, great for leftovers, served over noodles

This turned out pretty good. I was unsure after reading the reviews. I forgot to drain the liquid before shredding, but am glad I didn't.  I only had italian seasoned chicken broth, so I added that and didn't bother with basil and thyme.  It tasted great.  We had it on egg noodles which really made it seem like tuna casserole.  Next time I will serve it with rice.  I plan on trying the leftovers on a tortilla with salsa.  My hubby is eating his on saltine crackers.  Good stuff.

I really wanted to like this casserole since I love cooking in my slow cooker, but I just didn't like the combination of flavors.  I did, however, really appreciate learning how to cook chicken in the Italian dressing.  It was so easy to shred.

This was super easy and the chicken just fell apart after cooking in the dressing all day. My husband thought it was delicious and we had to stop ourselves from eating it out of the slow cooker on wedges of french bread while the pasta cooked. Will try on rice next time.

I tried this and can't stop eating it!  Someone had suggested that it was really good on crackers - and now I scoop out a little each time I walk by!  We had it over pasta - but my favorite is on crackers (probably a texture thing - the crunch).  It would make a great party dip too!  Thanks for the super easy recipe!!

I have to admit, I didn't follow directions....I saw slow cooker and just automatically put all the ingredients together in the pot.  Then I read that I was supposed to only do the chicken and salad dressing to begin.  Nonetheless, it turned out great.  I substituted fat free evaporated milk with some bouillon because I didn't have any cream of chicken soup.  The sauce was a bit thin, but I mixed it in with the drained pasta and added a bit of grated parmesean cheese.  The sauce was a perfect consistency.  This is a good dish for the minimal amount of work that it takes - I'll make it again the same way.  Leftovers the next day were even better than the night before!

Far from phenomenal, but tasty nonetheless.  This dish is VERY salty, but I think this can be remedied by making one's own italian dressing and omitting the salt, and/or by using low-salt chicken broth.  It's also very rich (even with lite cream cheese and half-fat cream of chicken soup), so next time I'll use light sour cream instead.  I served it over egg noodles, with a side of steamed broccoli.

I'll give this two stars because it didn't go straight in the trash, the husband ate about half.  I had high hopes for this because I tasted the chicken early on after cooking in the dressing, I should have stopped while I was ahead.  Will NOT be making this again.

Simple, easy and absolutely delicious!  I actually added some penne pasta and the chicken broth (a whole can) in with the chicken and italian dressing and let that simmer for 4-6 hours and then added the rest of the ingredients.  It was a hit!

We ended up having to throw this out and husband running to get fast food. It was not appealing in the least... the look or taste. Nothing flavorful about it... you will definitely remember to thaw your chicken if you make this!

After reading this recipe, I decided that in order for anyone to eat it, it should look more appetizing. So I Dipped the chicken in egg, then a mixture of breadcrumbs and parm cheese, and then cooked the chicken in a skillet in the Italian Dressing until it was just about done. Meanwhile, I had the other ingredients in a slow cooker, melding.  Just before the chicken was done, I put it in with the rest for an hour on high. It was very good.  I will definitely make this again.

this was good....the flavors blended very well.  i even used a very inexpensive bottle of italian dressing. my kids loved it, hubby loved it and they wanted more the next night.  it is versatile enough to serve with rice, or noodles.  i personally didn't 'love it' enough to make it one our staple meals, but i will make it again.  it was pretty easy and reminded me of beef stroganoff, but with chicken.

I tried it as a way to have dinner set for a late night (during the week). I began it last night, took the chicken out of the slow cooker let it sit in the fridge for the day. 
While my little one was in her activities, I completed step 3, put everything back in the slow cooker and ran out to pick up the kids to get everyone home.
WOW - it turned out REALLY well, and VERY good.
My daughter cleaned her plate.
I am keeping this one in my recipe box - yummy. Thanks.

I thought the reviewers who said that his recipe tasted like tuna casserole must have been nuts....they were right!!!  Trust me, if you have a problem with tuna casserole DO NOT make this recipe.  On the other hand, my best friend, who doesn't mind tuna casserole loved it...to each his own I guess.

I reserved a couple of tbsp of the Italian dressing and added it to the soup mix.  I really liked it, but my husband thought the cream cheese flavor was too overwhelming.

We love this receipe,just made it 2 days ago but instead of using dressing from a bottle I use the dry dressing from
a packet and 2 cans cream of chicken and no chicken broth. You can make it lighter with low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese. I also add some garlic, you can cook it on high for 4 hours or low for 6 hours, I would only cook it longer if the chicken was frozen!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I made it for a birthday dinner and served it over bow pasta. The only change that I made was the chicken cooking time. I placed it in the crock pot on high for about 3 1/2 hours. I then turned it off, took the lid off, and let it cool for about 30 minutes. I then shredded it and followed the instructions. It was so good that we fought over the left overs. Thanks Monika

This was a very easy recipe and I am glad that I found it.  The only problem that I had was that the chicken was very dry.  I liked the flavor and added white rice as a side dish.  I guess I will just have to find a way to keep the chicken moist.  Thanks for posting.

Easy and Delicious is the perfect name for this recipe.  We all enjoyed it.  The only changes I made were that I used a whole can of chicken broth and didn't put in the basil ot thyme.  I also left the breasts whole instead of shredding them.  Thanks

Kind of bland. Needed vegetables or something. The chicken would have been better cut into chunks rather than shredded; the texture didn't thrill me.

This was really easy.  I served it over noodles and it made a nice creamy sauce. My family loved it even my little kids. I agree with the other reviews that the italian dressing flavor is a little strong.  Next time, I will only use half and add chicken broth.

This WAS delicious. The only changes I made were to use only 4 chicken breasts, and I halved the recommended amount of Italian dressing like others suggested.  Very easy to make.  My husband and I likened it to a chicken version of beef stroganoff.  We served it over rice.  Maybe next time I'll try a flavored cream cheese.

I was surprised...this really wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  I even followed most of the recommendations like a little less cream cheese.  I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic which did add some more flavor.  If you add veggies, I recommend fresh broccoli.  It is an ok recipe.

I found that having it cook in the italian dressing was very strong for my liking. I did however, like the cream sauce. It went great with egg noodles. my only problem was getting over the tangy flavor of italian dressing.

Ok, I am an awful cook and this turned out FANTASTIC!! I made the recipe exactly how it was written. I didn't change a thing! I'm definitely making this many many more times! Oh yeah, I served it over biscuits. It was a nice "southern meal" :)

This is very good. Easy to prepare. I used dry italian salad dressing mix and sprinkled it on, and added a cup of chicken broth, rather than bottled dressing and it worked fine. The sauce turned out rich and creamy. A nice dish for supper on a cold day. I will definitely make this again.

Well, I have to admit--it's not too pretty.  I served with rice and that made for a whole lotta white on the plate--but--it did taste good.  I'm not too fond of basil and thyme--so I used less by half.  I'd say serve with some peas as a side or mixed in--or maybe some buttered noodles w/parsley just to green things up a bit!

My husband and I really enjoyed this and will be making it again.  However, our 5 year old son didn't care for it.  This recipe has a "twang" to the taste that would be hard to come by elsewhere.

I thought this was sooo good, it was just a tiny bit too sour for my taste. I had read people saying it was too thick, so I added a little more broth than it called for, and that made it perfect. Served over noodles, and the family loved it! I think next time I will leave out a little of the italian dressing, so its not so sour. :)

I used 3 frozen chicken breasts instead of 6, but kept all of the other ingredients the same.  This is a great stroganoff recipe and I was glad to actually use my crockpot.  I will make this for company.

VERY rich and a nice flavour.  I will likely try it again, but will reduce the amount of cream cheese by half. I think it needs some color for presentation.

This smelled great cooking.  My chicken breasts tasted too dry, so I don't know if I cooked it too long or they just weren't the juiciest to begin with.  This was a quick a easy dish that tastes pretty good.

This is very, very good and has many uses.  My family had it over rice one night and ate it cold the next day as a chicken salad sandwich.  It was so easy because it is a crock pot recipe.  Great for those busy days!!

This was excellent. Everyone loved it. I followed the recipe as written except that I softened the cream cheese and used a hand-held mixer to blend the ingredients before adding because  I had used cream cheese in a different crock pot recipe before and it didn't melt/blend completely.

I halved the recipe since I'm only cooking for two. I used frozen chicken breast and it did not need the chicken broth. It came out really soupey and I had to thicken with corn starch. Also, it didn't look creamy enough so I added a little sour cream at the end. Also added mushrooms and onions and served over rice since the sauce was a bit thin. All in all a good recipe, with a few tweaks it could be great.

This was a great meal!  The picture above is completely wrong, it looks like alfredo sauce with shredded chicken.  I added frozen broccoli to the crockpot for the last hour and it was an awesome touch.  I also added diced onions and some mushrooms, and a tspn of garlic.  Yummy!  The secret to getting the sauce the perfect consistency is using a hand blender instead of just mixing by hand.  My sauce was thick, creamy, and perfectly blended.  My hand blender is used in half of the recipes I make, for only $25.  Highly recommend!

loved this recipe. modified a bit: used 1/2 jar
of cardoni original ceasar salad dressing, reduced
cream cheese to 4 oz. I didn't have one of the spices so I just added about 1/4  teaspoon or bit more poultry seasoning.  Also, cooked in oven
for about 1 hour at 350 degrees instread of crock pot.  
Served over homemade noodles and second time my favorite bertoni ravoli, all natural, 4 cheese blend. Cooked separate and then mixed with the chicken mixture after I sliced the chicken breasts into strips. Much easier to serve all in one dish.
by far one of my favorite dishes especially for company.

I would not make this again.     It was just OK but nothing I am looking forward to eating a second time.     I did not like the thyme personally.      We ate it over angel hair pasta and it is across between tetrazini and alfredo.

This was so easy and super delicious!  I also used frozen chicken.  The cream cheese is really what makes it so yummy!

First of all, I am terrible at cooking & with 4 kids, I don't have time to stand over a stove.  So I finally got a slow cooker today & put this recipe to the test.  I added a dash of sherry and milk to make more creamy since my noodles soaked up the liquid.  My kids actually liked my meal!  (Usually dad cooks b/c mom's cooking is bad!)

It was tasty, I added some shredded carrots. I read a review that said they put in a whole can of chicken stock...I regretted I did that because I had to thicken. Good recipe, thanks for sharing.

A dish that ALL 5 of my children enjoy (ages 2-14) which is an amazing feat!  I generally drain off all but about 4 oz of Italian dressing and than add the remaing ingredients.  I like the extra zip that the dressing gives to the sauce.  I have also just cooked it all together and like how that turns out too.  Overall, one of my favorites

This is amazing.  The flavor is awesome and with the seasoning listed it taste almost like a good chicken soup but not.  The only thing I change was that I thru in about a cup of semi cooked white rice when I added all of the other ingredients after the chicken was shredded.  I just kinda undercooked the rice and let it finish cooking with everything else.  Great for left overs too.

This was VERY bland. Not at all happy with this recipe. I have made plenty of recipes from this site and this is the first, and hopefully the last, disappointing recipe. There are better recipes for chicken and for the crockpot.

Good flavor I just wish the sauce was most loose. Next time i'll increase the chicken broth by a cup or so to see how that goes.

I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with the broth and extra Italian dressing.  I added the rest of the ingredients with one hour left.  We didn't cut the chicken up, just ate it over rice.  Everyone loved it!

I had no bottled dressing so I used a packet of dried Italian dressing mix....golden mushroom soup, and added the cream cheese at the end. I also added a pk. of sliced baby bella mushrooms. Very tasty served over linguine. Yes, easy and yes, yummy. Good put together week night meal. Love the crockpot!

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. It was too much like a topping to be eaten alone, but lost flavor when eaten over rice. Maybe with a few changes it could be better

I was worried after reading all the not-so-good reviews, but it turned out pretty yummy for our family!  I threw everything in at once (only used 4 chicken breasts, 5 oz of fat-free Italian dressing, and about 5oz of cream cheese).  I left out the thyme and doctored it up with some McCormick Hamburger Grill Seasoning (it's fab on chicken, I promise!) and then cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  We served it over rice and with broccoli and it was delicious!  It also tasted yummy with some tortilla chips as a hot dip for a late night snack :)  All of my picky eaters (husband, kids ages 5, 3, and 1) ate it up!  Will make again.

This was very tatsy.  I modified it down to 4 servings but stayed with the full can of the soup and the full cream cheese instead of going with 2/3rds.  Also I did end up using low fat dressing and cream cheese and it was delicious.  I don't know what it would have tasted like otherwise, but believe me you don't ever miss it.

loved it! kinda tastes like an Alfredo, but with a tangy zing! i actually went back for seconds later that night!! i couldn't stay away! although, i didn't have time for slow cooker method, so i did it all in a stock pot instead. but the way i did it, left the chicken a little dry. not the recipe's fault though, next time i plan on using the slow cooker.

This has become my favorite comfort food!  I use reduced-fat cream cheese and soup, and fat-free dressing.  The chicken falls apart after 4-5 hours in my crockpot so I shred it and made very thick topping/sauce for pasta or rice.  My boyfriend thought the flavor of the dressing was too strong and vinegary, so I've switched to using half dressing and half herb and garlic marinade.  No need for chicken broth, just don't drain all the liquid out, and I go easy on the thyme.  Soooooo gooooood.  The only thing it really needs now is a better name, I'm stumped on that one!  (While I agree it is easy and delicious, something more descriptive and unique would be better.  Creamy something...)

This recipe just wasn't for us.  It was a little too heavy and rich and just didn't work as a sauce.  The sauce actually reminded me of the sauce you find on spinach alfredo pizza.  Good on pizza - not over pasta.  That being said - the chicken breast itself was wonderful and I would give at least 4 stars.  I used Paul Newman's Family Recipe Italian Dressing and slow-cooked 6 fresh skinless boneless chicken breasts on low for 3-1/2 hours.  They were moist and juicy and FULL of flavor.  Even thought I won't make the sauce again - I will definitely cook chicken breasts in the italian dressing again.   They would be fantastic chopped up on a salad, pasta salad, pizza, or put into a wrap.  Thanks for the idea!

As easy and delicious as promised, it has become a favorite over rice, mashed potatoes, noodles - even ladled over open-faced rolls.  Re-heating isn't the best aspect of this dish, that is true - but there's not much left at my house to worry about ever reheating!

This recipe is one of our favorites!  We've shared it with several families & it's now a favorite for them too. If you manage to have any leftovers, they are great in a tortilla, like a wrap. Couldn't be easier or more delicious-thanks!!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe. I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker before leaving for work and set it on low. When I returned from work the sauce was very watery so I added another can of cream soup and a little processed cheese spread to thicken the sauce. Next time I may add less chicken broth or italian dressing to make the sauce thicker. We put the chicken and sauce over thin spaghetti noodles and loved it. We will definately make this again.

I was skeptical about this one, but went ahead and made it since I had everything on hand and was so easy.  It was excellent.  It doesn't really need a whole package of cream cheese, I will use less next time.  This was a good one, though.

Sorry, but we didn't care for this one. The cream cheese seemed too over-powering. Maybe using less would make it better.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was very easy and tastes good but is way too rich for me. Anyone who likes white sauces on their pasta will love it!

***Next day comment: I figured out the key is to only add a little of the sauce to the pasta. Don't over do it, a little goes a long way! Its perfect and tones down the richness.

This was very good.  I only made a few changes.  I cooked the chicken and italian dressing together for 2 hours on low, then added the rest of the ingredients and let it cook on low for 4 more hours, and served over rice.

OK but needed more spice - maybe some heat. Served over brown rice and that was good.

Really was "easy and delicious".  Even my vehemently-opposed-to-anything-from-the-slowcooker" husband loved it and said it tasted like something from Macaroni Grill.  Made it just as written with the exception of Cream of Mushroom soup in place of the Cream of Chicken (didn't have any).  Served it over linguini.  Was very good and will absolutely be made again...soon.

Very good. I didn't have enough Italian dressing so I used what I did have plus most of a bottle of garlic and herb marinade. I also threw in about a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic with the soup/cheese mixture. My husband really liked it too, but he's not too hard to please.

My husband and I both thought this ended up being way too salty.  I am much more salt-sensitive than he is and I could hardly eat it.  I did it on the stove, instead of in the slow cooker because it was a sort of last minute decision and we were hungry.  If I were to make it again, I would probably try using milk in place of the chicken broth, although that wouldn't work for the slow cooker.

I love this recipe.  The chicken is so tasty.  I actually used a sun-dried tomato viniagrette dressing.  It really added some nice zing to it.  It is great with either rice or noodles.

My entire family (8) did not like this dish.  I heard comments ranging from, "it tastes like tuna casserole, yuk!" to, "it tastes how Lysol smells"  My wife thinks the condensed chicken soup was the culprit.  I did like the flavor of the chicken cooked in Italian dressing before adding the other ingredients.

Very bland, not flavorful at all.  I had to add a LOT of extra spices just so it was edible.  My husband enjoyed it, that's why it's getting 2 stars.  Will not make again.  There are much better chicken dishes that don't take so long.

Made this recipie many times. Its my easy favorite recipe. Im not fond of the dressings seeds and herbs pieces on my chicken. I just filtered it out with a corinder and toss. I have used both the skillet and slow cooker. I just throw frozen chicken in the skillet and simmer for 30 mins on med low heat.

Everyone ate it and the kids ate the leftovers the next night. This would get 5 stars but was just alittle bland for me. Next time I will add some seasoning to the last part.

This is a really great recipe. The only change I made was to use dry dressing mix and a cup of water and used the juices instead of broth. My picky husband and meat-hating 18 month old both loved it. I will def make this again!!

I can't really tell what it is that gives the sauce the weird twang...maybe it's the combination of the cream cheese and spices.  It's almost a minty/sour type flavor.  I almost think the basil is the culprit...I thought I liked basil.  Anyway, a suggestion would be to maybe add a little spice to a small amount of sauce to see if you like the flavor before you incorporate it into the whole pot.  The recipe was definately easy and pretty rich.

outstanding. We even just liked the chicken with the dressing. Would make again. Chicken went in frozen. When I added the cream mixture I also added carrots and corn. Family picky eaters gobbed it all up. thanks for the recipe.

Not too bad. I used a can of garlic mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken...it darkened the mixture up a bit. Also added some chopped broccoli at the end to add color. I loved how tender the chicken was after cooking in the Italian dressing..it just fell apart! I only made 3 servings so it took about 4 hours to cook.

This was OK - I think I may have used too much cream, though.  I think it might have been better, in fact, without the cream.

This is definitely the easiest and tastiest dinner I make in my crockpot!  Everyone who tries it loves it!  I always serve over rice (though it's great over egg noodles as well) and make some corn and crescent rolls and you have an wonderful meal!

It was good, but some of the flavor seemed unusual.  I think from the onion soup and cream cheese.  My husband said it was okay.

The recipe WAS easy, I will give it that -but it was far from delicious.  I can't pinpoint exactly what the problem was, but I think it had something to do with the herbs.  It was just a strange tasting concoction that (like a previous reviewer said)went straight into the garbage disposal.

I have made something very similar to this before and loved it.  I did not add the italian dressing or cream cheese though.  Instead, I used chicken gravy mix and flour and about 1/4c. chicken broth.  This works great for sandwiches or over mashed potatoes.  It was a hit and absolutely no leftovers!

Very good.  Based on other reviews I used only 6 oz cream cheese and used one cup of the dressing/chicken juices instead of broth.  I also added fresh green beans and carrots and it came out great.

I had such high hopes for this well rated recipe.  As someone else suggested, I substituted Velveeta for the cream cheese, and the results were an unappealing mess.

I would have given 0 stars, though the single star is due to the taste of the marinated/cooked chicken before the remaining ingredients ruined the meal.  Would make the chicken w/italian dressing, but will never use the entire recipe again.

Quite tasty!  A bit too much cream cheese I think though.  Next time I think I will only use 3/4 of the block of cheese and I will try to use the dressing and juices instead of the broth.  A good one to put into our regular meal rotation!

I loved the taste of the chicken and sauce.  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and deboned them after the initial 6-8 hours in the crock pot.  My son (2) and I loved it, but my husband and daughter (6) didn't.  It was the cream cheese that turned them off-but that's what I thought made it so creamy and rich!  I served it over wheat spaghetti and really enjoyed it-Thanks!

My husband thought the sauce was decent but that there was way too much chicken in it.  He praises most of what I make, and so when he says "it's okay" I usually don't make it again.  I honestly didn't like the sauce...I tasted way too much cream cheese, and thought it was really salty for some reason (even though I used low-sodium chicken broth as well).  I thought the sauce was too thick.  Thanks to other reviewers, I doctored it a little and it turned out okay (I ended up adding mushrooms, garlic, onion, peppers, more pepper, milk after we tried it).  Thanks, though, it was easy, and edible...good base recipe that you can tweak to your own likings.  It sounds like everyone else really liked it.  :)

I have made this over and over! I just Zesty Italian dressing and instead of draining the chicken completely, I leave about 1/4 cup of the dressing in with the chicken when I shred it.  This way I don't have to add any  more spices to the recipe, and it keeps a bit of the "italian" flavor.  I've been asked for the recipe over and over!

If you follow this recipe, make sure the chicken is fully thawed.  There is a big risk of food poisoning when cooking with frozen chicken in the crock pot.

This was yummy....but i did saute onion and garlic to throw in at the last hour after you drain the chicken and shred it.It was good, i had a lot left over and i used the left over sauce for a alfredo like pizza sauce today on a pizza with spinich and peppers, mozzerella and cheddar, my picky 8 year old had 3 slices, it was way yummy on the pizza.

This wasn't a bad recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.  I must have done something wrong, although I followed the recipe.  The cream cheese didn't melt down and we ended up with clumps.

Chicken breasts were overcooked in the crock-pot, even set on low. I simmered all the stovetop ingredients -plus 1 thawed and drained box spinach and 1 drained can mushrooms - for about 1/2 hour. Should have used low-sodium soup and broth. This was way too soupy and salty. Diluted with water and mixed well with egg noodles, was ok. It was easy. I would make again with modifications.

I make this also, but cook the chicken with the zesty italian dressing on high for 1 hour.  Then after microwaving the cream cheese for around 1 min.  I mix it with the cream of chicken soup.  I do not add the thyme or basil, but 1 tbsp. of Texas Pete.  I then cook on high for 1 more hour and serve on egg noodles.  It's delicious!

This was very tasty and a huge hit with family and friends. The cream cheese did not want to melt and blend in the crock pot, so next time I am going to mix it with the soup in a kettle and heat it until it melts, then add it to the crock pot. Will make again.

Turned out wonderful!  Loved the flavor!  Read reviews prior to making and took the best from all!  Added mixed veggies.....also blended the cream cheese and broth on the stove prior to adding to the crock....
Will definately make again....very easy and very tasty!!!

My whole family loved this dish, even the picky 3 year old!  We thought the flavor was perfect - not too zesty, but not bland, either.  I can see how some people might be put off by the resemblance to tuna casserole, but we weren't bothered by that.  The leftovers were great for lunch the next day spread on crackers.

I made this and served it over angel hair pasta -- It was ok. Part of the family liked it, but some didn't. It was bad, but not great. Probably will not make again.

Very easy to make. The chicken with just the dressing is delicious. But then after adding everything else..the tastes just didn't meld well for us. I would try again with a little tweaking.

Excellent.  I will definitely prepare again.  Substituted neufchatel for cream cheese and used 98% fat free cream of chicken.  Heated the soup, broth and "cream cheese" on stove so as to blend, then added it to the crock. I served this over cooked cheese tortellini.  It reminded me of chicken and dumplings.., but better.

This was OK, the chicken was very tender, but as others stated, the cream cheese didn't melt completely (I did slice it before adding to the mix).  DH thought it had a sour taste to it, but ate it!  I think the cream cheese made it a little too rich (and I only used about 2/3 of the package).  I might try it again without the cream cheese!

Was good and a hit with my 9 year old, but felt it could have been more Saucy than thick. Will work with recipe to make it a bit Saucier. Served with Linguini Noodles and was fantastic.

OK, I can't really rate this stuff.  It's ready and sitting in my crock pot, but I am not sure what I am going to do with it.  It LOOKS TERRIBLE.  I wanted to dice the chicken, but it shredded all by itself.  So, it looks like slop.  It TASTES good.  But like some other reviewers said, "it's more of like a dip for crackers," and it "looks and tastes kind of like tuna casserole"  I can't imagine that my husband will want to eat this, and I KNOW my toddler won't.  I thought about putting it into flour tortillas and making a kind of chicken burrito with it.  Maybe on egg noodles, but I can't see eating more than a few bites of that.  I don't really know, it's just a very strange concoction.  The good thing is, it's a nice way to cook and shred chicken if you don't have a lot of time!

I was so excited about making this...it would be an easy family dinner after a long day!  So disappointed!  This was very bland.  I even added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to give it some added color and it still looked boring and unappetizing on the plate.  The taste was not any better...the whole family voted that this was definitely a "never make again".

Very easy and SOOOO delicious!  I served this over egg noodles.  Next time I make it I will likely try lower fat ingredients (I'm sure with the tub of sour cream it is deadly!) and see how that tastes.  This was really really good!

The first time I had this I was visiting my sister in Oregon. It was sooo good I came home and made it for my family. My son who is very picky loved it, my aunt wanted the recipe. I followed the directions to a T. Although I threw in frozen chicken breasts because my days are 10 hours long and serve on top of white rice, with corn and bread. It's good as a spread on ritz crackers, too.

Very easy to make!  I added a few extra breasts and took half of it to a friend who had just had a baby.  Before I could make it home, her husband had called for the recipe!  I cooked wild rice to eat with it instead of pasta!

Intersting ingredients...tasted pretty good.  I served over thin spaghetti.  Thought the leftovers were better than the night I made it.  While we thought it was good, I can see where some people didn't like it.  Probably an aquired taste, but worth making once to see.

We did not like this at all.  My husband and kids ended up throwing it away.  The chicken was good when it finished cooking in the italian dressing, but the cream cheese was a little much.  It had a very strange taste.

This was excellent!  I only had 4 chicken breast halves, but that made for plenty of yummy sauce.  I substituted cream of mushroom soup for the chicken soup, and used Light Italian Dressing and lite cream cheese.

For color and flavor boost I added a 4-oz jar of pimientos, drained, and 1 bunch of green onions, thinly sliced.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper.  Be careful not to over salt.  I served it over rice, but noodles would also be wonderful.

My mister and I loved it, and it has been officially inducted into the rotation!

Easy and Delicious!  You could add a million different things to this to your taste i.e. mushrooms, onions, veggies, etc.  And if you don't put it over rice or pasta, it's low-carb.  Yummy!  Kiddo favorite!

I thought this recipe was indeed easy and was not offensively flavored although a little bland.  The sauce was very rich and creamy, it just needed something extra.  Next time I'm going to add some mushrooms, onions, peppers, and maybe just a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce.

This is the best. Quick, easy and delicious! I have made it as is, and also with cream of mushroom in place of the cream of chicken. I have also made it with london broil, beef broth, and cream of mushroom. My family loves it and asks for it once a week!! Great if you are on the run it cooks all day, with no defrosting. Love It!!!!

Excellent recipe for grown-ups!  Not for kids...so don't complain about your kids not liking it.  Kids are picky...give your kids a hot dog instead...or maybe mac and cheese...You may want some color...add some pimentoes and chopped green onions for color and flavor.  Too thick?  Add a bit more milk.  I found this recipe excellent...flavor, presentation, et all...great!  Served over noodles...tri-color noodles at that!  The Best!

Easy and very tasty. I saved about a tablespoon or so of the Italian dressing and stirred it in at the end. I also added sauted mushrooms and 1 tsp. of paprika (for much needed color)as suggested by other reviews. I think next time I'll add just a tad more basil and thyme. Great over egg noodles.

This recipe was astonishingly good, considering how easy it was.  I served it over noodles and sprinkled paprika over it for much-needed color.  The chicken breasts looked so good after step 1 (cooking all day in Italian dressing) that I was tempted to not continue with the recipe!

Fabulous! I used fresh herbs and freshly ground tri-color peppercorns, and substituted reduced fat cream cheese and fat free cream of chicken soup. It turned out rich and creamy, and I would gladly pay $10.00 in a restaurant for this entree. I served it with steamed vegetables and a garden salad.

Very easy and creative recipe. This was definitely edible, but nothing to write home to mama about.  I love food that is rich and taste and this was not.  I also prefer my dishes to have some color.  I will not make this again.  Sounded pretty good though.

We loved this, I did make modifications. There are only 2 of us. I used 3 chicken breasts, half of the cream cheese, added 1/4 C. of sour cream, more basil, added 1 can green chili's and a roma tomato (tomato really added nice color). Instead of chicken broth I drained all but 1 C. of the italian dressing and then added about 1/2 C. water added garlic powder as well.  My husband and I both loved it. It was great over rice. Next time I make it I will decrease the cream cheese even more and serve with tortilla's.

very good.  I've made this twice already and it has been great both times.  I did leave almost all the Italian dressing in after cooking the chicken and used a little less chicken broth.  We liked it even better like that.  Serve over white rice with green beans and biscuits.  Yum!! A friend of mine makes this served over chicken Rice-A-Roni.

Great weekend easy prep-dinner.  Much better with homemade italian dressing (olive oil, red vinegar and seasonings); adding a can of chopped portabello mushrooms is a must for texture; half the cream cheese; then pour over brown rice. Also just doing the chix in the italian dressing then putting over a salad is great too.

This was easy! I tried this with semi-frozen chicken breasts(which I cubed before cooking)so I reduced the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours but put it on High.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used half the dressing, which I did not drain off, and half the cream cheese.  I used sugar-free italian dressing for the dieter in my family as well as low-sodium chic broth and cream of chic soup.  I omitted the seasonings at the end since we aren't really fond of those and after all my changes it was still very tasty.  I served it with rice.  I loved it with cooked peas added to mine but my husband preferred it with cooked spinach which he covered with the extra sauce. The only thing I would say to others is to be careful with your cooking time so you don't dry out the chicken.  Mine was just on the edge of being dry so next time I will adjust the time even a little more.

This was really good.  My only complaint was that it was a little tart, but it was still very good, I just couldn't eat too much of it at once.  We had it over egg noodles, it was great. The chicken was so tender! Thanks!

I have been cooking this for years!!!!  I have shared this recipe with countless people.  My son is 4 and is very picky.  He will only eat chicken that is cooked in Italian dressing.  I do a few things different.  I add no seasoning to the final product.  Instead, I add about 2 Tbl of Italian dressing.  I reserve it when I first start the cooking process and it tastes wonderful!  I serve it with hot, buttered egg noodles or rice!

I thought this recipe was good but not great. My husband said it defintitely tasted "easy" but not "delicious." The chicken was incredibly tender but it usually is when cooked in a crockpot. I only used half a block of cream cheese, added a couple of tablespoons of the italian dressing/chicken juice mixture, and used an Italian seasoning mix instead of the separate seasonings. I also marinated the chicken overnight in Italian dressing and this did add a burst of flavor to the chicken. Served over egg noodles. I am not sure if I will make this again or not.

This went over okay at my house.  It was easy, but it wound up being just a little bit bland.   If I make it again, I might tweak it a bit and see what we come up with.

This was fantastic served over biscuits! My husband and I both liked it, which hardly ever happens. I did add only 3 oz. of cream cheese instead of the 8 oz. called for, but that was the only change I made.  I will definitely make this again and again!

After reading most of the reviews, I had to at least try it...  Definitely easy, and I'd have to say delicious too.  It did remind me of a Stroganoff and I wished I put it over noodles (I put it on toast as I couldn't wait to try it).  I did use less dressing (and used Fat Free) and did cut the cream cheese in half, but I only used 4 chicken breasts.  The chicken was a bit stringy/dry, but I think I cooked too long (9 hours, plus the last hour), but certainly didn't affect the taste.  Will make again.

Will definately make this again!  My husband had 3 pieces, I had 2, and my 2 year old had 1 whole piece by herself.  Made some rice with it, and the gravy this makes is wonderful.  This would be great if you were having company.  This will be a recipe I make quite often.  SO easy!

Yum! Very quick and easy dinner. We served fettucine noodles along with the chicken and sauce. Used fat free Italian dressing and reduced fat cream cheese and it turned out wonderful!  A keeper, especially on those busy days.

This was very good.  Reminded us of beef strognoff with chicken.  I served it over hot noodles with a side salad and crusty bread, and my family loved it.  Shall make it again.

Very good!  I love the simplicity of this recipe.  We eat alot of chicken, and I'm always looking for a new way to prepare it.  Very similar to beef stroganoff.  I added all the ingredients except the cream cheese, which I put in about 1/2 hour before serving.

Tastes wonderful, but looks like tuna casserole. Maybe if I don't shred the chicken the appearance would be more appetizing. The whole family thought it tasted great! Definitely will make this again.

The dressing was a bit strong for my liking but good none the less next time I'll use half the dressing maybe with a little water of the remaining chicken broth. I also left the chicken breast whole and served on breast on a bed of rice with the sauce poured over - added green beans and YUM! -- thanks for an easy meal on a cold day!

This was very yummy. I went ahead and added coooked rice to it. I agree the color is very blah, but the taste makes up for it.

This is very delicious! It's so rich tasting, however, that I couldn't eat a lot. I found that serving it over some mashed potatoes with a side of sauteed green beens was very good. Thanks for the great recipe.

This dish was not the greatest. We did not like the taste that the cream cheese produced.

This chicken is delicious! My picky daughter even wanted the leftovers which is very unusual. I added cooked noodles at the end and they got a little mushy, so next time I will just serve it over the noodles. The chicken was very moist. I left it in for 5 hours which was plenty. The whole family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

I loved this and would have given it 5 stars, but ,for some reason he would not specify, my husband hated it. I thought the sauce was fantastic and served it over biscuits. I poured the drippings out of the pot after the chicken was cooked, strained off the fat and added the defatted juices back to the pot. I also put in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and I suspect that is what my husband objected to. I would recommend trying this recipe!

This recipe is very easy.  I tried once over rice and once over biscuits, the biscuits were much tastier.  Next time I will add some vegetables such as mushrooms for some added texture and flavor.  I also used 4 oz of cream cheese, as others had suggested and it was enough for me.  I also drained all of the dressing/juice before returning the chicken to the crock, and I'm glad I did.  The chicken is very flavorful and rich.
I'll definetly make this again.

My family loved this!  With the chicken and dressing, I also added onion, which I spooned out and added to the sauce mixture.  Wish I had thought of mushrooms - will do that next time.  It was great on biscuits.  Thanks, Monika!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very conveniant to be able to start with frozen chicken breasts. The chicken turned out tender and was easy to shred. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because my children wouldn't even touch the stuff. I also noticed that eventhough I ate 2 helpings of it with rice I was hungry again soon after I ate it. My husband had that same reaction.

My family loved this recipe! I used chicken breasts with bone in because that's what I had on hand.  It worked out very well and I think kept the chicken more moist.

Every one in the family loved this one... except me! I didn't care for the combination of the italian dressing and the cream cheese. I loved the simplicity of the recipe, though, and will try it again with a different, milder dressing. Thanks!

I had already decided to make this into a "stroganoff" type meal, which was good, since it did look like chipped meat on toast as the recipe is written.  I mixed the chicken mixture with steamed broccoli over egg noodles, and it was delicious.  We ate leftovers (which tasted even better) for three nights until it was gone.  I will make it again.  One winter night when I know I won't feel like cooking, I will also put the chicken in the crockpot with the Italian dressing and just eat it that way.  It was so tender and delicious when it came out that I almost didn't want to continue the recipe this time!

I served this the way it was written (except I continued to add chicken broth as it way too thick), but with the leftovers, we made soft tacos.  In the future, we may even make enchiladas with the leftovers.  Many ways to serve this delicious recipe.  Since whole Chicken breasts were on sale, the day before I boiled those and chunked the chicken for the crock pot the next day.  Cut crock pot time.

I thought the chicken was fall apart tasty.  The meal ended up being very thick so I will keep 1/2 the juice it cooked in & omit the basil & thyme.  Great addition to our family dinner.  Thanks !

Our very favorite recipe!  The flavors are wonderful.  We serve it over brown rice.  I use light italian dressing and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

This was so flavorful! The cream cheese added a savory taste to it. I made it with my chicken frozen but I also used thighs instead of breasts so the dark meat was melting off the bone. So delicious!

After reading the step where it says to drain the juices and then add the chicken broth, I decided that was a bit wasteful.  So I used the marinade and it's own  juices the chicken had been cooking in and mixed that with the soup and cream cheese. It may have added some extra fat and calories but hey, we're already cooking with cream cheese. My whole family loved it. Will make again, was so easy!

This meal is definitely delicious!  I served it over pasta and toast, topped with parmesan cheese.  It tasted great as leftovers as well!

I left out the seasonings but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I shred the chicken and put it on a bed of butter and herb rice. This is one of my favorites.

DELICIOUS! WOW! However I did make some adjustments. I used pre-seasoned chicken breasts from the store and put them in the slow cooker with about 1 bottle of italian dressing for 3 hours on low. After checking that the chicken was fully cooked, I poured the dressing out and replaced the chicken. Then I mixed 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken soup, 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth (the dish didn't low fat/sodium at all!!), 1 tsp. of thyme, 1 tsp. thick ground pepper, 1 tsp. garlic salt and 3/4 a package of savory garlic cooking creme! Cooked on low for an additional hour never shredding the chicken. OMG...by far the best chicken recipe I have made yet. I make extra wide egg noodles and aside from the breast I poured extra sauce over the noodles....just AMAZING!! My boyfriend could not stop talking about it ;)

This was terrible! I'm not sure what happened here, we were so excited to try it out. But my two boys who eat almost anything spit it out! It tasted like tuna, and even after trying to fix it, it was still awful. Will not make again!!

This is a great recipes, the sauce is very rich so have some rice or pasta with it. As some of the other reviews I use the whole can of chicken broth.  Did not have a can of cream of chicken soup, use a can of cream of celery and it was still good to everyone.  Five Stars!!!!

Followed the recipe to a tee, but used fat free cream cheese and fat free cream of chicken soup for calorie reductions.  My family loved it.  Definitely a keeper, so easy and so yummy!

I have made some modifications to the recipe for my family, I do not season it with basil and thyme for it has an amazing flavor all on its own.. I also add in carrots and halved red potatoes at the very beginning, after I drain off the juices I add the other ingredients as recommended (leaving in the carrots and potatoes) and serve on egg noodles. My family loves this recipe even left overs. Thank you so much.

I was really looking forward to this.  I tried to disregard the negative comments, but I really didn't like it.  :(  Perhaps some paprika would have been good.  Also, it needed pepper for sure.  Oh well.

"5 Stars" would actually be my husband's review!  Ok, I think so too.  This was a very easy recipe and came out awesome (we omitted the cream cheese to save calories)  The chicken is very tender and flavorful cooked this way.  Threw in a bag of frozen broccoli spears for the last 20 min. and served with garlic mashed potatoes - fabulous!

Yes to easy, no to delicious.  We did not like the Italian dressing with this.  It gave it a very odd, tangy taste that didn't mix well with the cream cheese and soup.  Maybe it would work better with ranch?

I enjoyed this. I added onions and garlic to the crockpot with the chicken, used a fat free italian dressing and fat free cream cheese. I also added in lots of sliced zucchini towards to end to give the dish more bulk. It needed a little zip, so a splash of tabasco was perfect.

This recipe was easy to make.  I used low fat dressing and cream cheese. It seemed to lack flavor probably because of low fat.  It was good, but next I will add some other spices to give a little more flavor. Also, I used 5 large chicken breasts and it was more like cream chicken sandwiches.  Will use more broth or less chicken next time.

This is very good. I made it with Neufchatel cheese and I didn't have basil so I threw in some parsley. I served it over spagetti noodles but the family didn't like that so much. Next time I will have egg noodles with it.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written - the only exception is that I added the entire can of chicken broth.  My family loved this dish!  They said it's a definite "keeper" that I should make again.  And I certainly cannot complain b/c it was one of the easiest recipes ever!
Great recipe, thanks!

I've been making this recipe for over a year, except I put everything in the crockpot at once.  I usually use frozen chicken breasts, just because it's easier.  The only difference to the ingredients is that I use a third cup of milk instead of the broth.  My kids get very excited when they hear we're having this for dinner.

This was good, but not good enough for me to want to go through all the prep time to make this again.  As another reviewer did, I cooked it on high for 2.5 hours instead of 6-8 on low and it turned out fine.  I also only had about 5 oz Italian dressing, and that was enough to marinate the chicken in.

The food was good - minus the Italian dressing.  I couldn't even eat it the day we cooked it because the cooked Italian dressing stunk up the whole house! We went out for dinner that night.  We ate it the next day over Spaghetti and loved it!  Next time I'll probably skip the Italian dressing!

This is my favorite new recipe - well kind of.I used a Zesty Italian dressing mix combined with water to cook the chicken in, then add the cream cheese and condensed soup, and fresh mushrooms. I love it over egg noodles. It tastes almost exactly like one of my favorite dishes from a local restaurant.

I served over egg noodles and even my picky 7 year old liked it.  I wasn't especially crazy about the spice combination and will probably forgo the thyme when I make again.  Also, I will probably cut down on the cream cheese a little.  Overall, though, it was fast, easy and pleasing.

It was an even better recipe when I substituted spicy spaghetti sauce for regular...I think it needed that little extra zip.

This recipe is wonderful!  We make it all the time.  We did find that we had to put spices inside the chicken to really get any flavor out of them, though.  If you want your chicken to really pop, make sure to get spices or stuffing inside, and under the skin!

I agree - easy and delicious!  I used Newmans Family Recipe Italian dressing.  I omitted the chicken broth and just left a cup of the juices from the chicken and salad dressing in the crock pot.  I also softened the cream cheese before adding it.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  We served it over pasta, but I like the idea from another reviewer for using it as a pizza topping.  We'll try that next time.

It smelled great and the first time I ate it I enjoyed it, but it didn't re-heat too well. Also, I couldn't get the cream cheese to melt.

Pretty good. My chicken turned out dry (weird, I know), but it had a good taste.  The last hour of cooking, after shredding the chicken, I added some frozen vegetables.(I didn't add the cream cheese because I didn't have any.  I did add some sour cream and from some reason it didn't entirely melt and there were still some globs of it...no worries though.  If I were adding cream cheese, I'd melt it entirely before adding it to the chicken.) As other reviewers said, it's like a tuna noodle casserole, so I just helped it out a little by adding veggies.  I served over, you guessed it, pasta.  This would probably taste good over rice, making it like a Hawaiian Haystack.  It was easy and I hardly had to worry about dinner, so I'll probably make it again sometime when I'm feeling lazy in the morning.  Not something I'd make for company, but a good family dinner nonetheless.  Tasted better the next day!

This dish is fantastic...easy and tasty!  I did feel like the Italian dressing was somewhat overwhelming.  Next time I'll use half dressing and half broth to cook the chicken in.

I did not drain the chicken after I shredded it.  I did not have much dressing, so I used what I had and added olive oil, apple cider vinegar and Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic.  I did not add any seasonings when I added the other ingredients except for chicken gravy mix.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and soups.  I served this over brown rice.  VERY GOOD!!!

I thought this was just ok. My family ate it and said it was good but nothing special. I thought the cream sauce was too thick and bland. The chicken cooked in the dressng was a great idea and came out very tender. If I make this again, I will add more seasonings to the cream sauce and probably half the amount of cream cheese.

For being a slow cooker recipe, this was good!  I did make some changes.  I had bought a bunch of bone in skinless chicken breasts cheap, so I figured this recipe would be a way to use them up.  I used 6 breasts, put them in the cooker frozen, it was falling off the bone in 6 hours.  I omitted the mushroom soup.  I used two cans of Cambell's chicken broth and added some paparika and some water for more gravy.  You may want to thicken the sauce with flour, etc.  It was surprisingly good!  We ate it like a stew.  Kids had it on noodles and liked it. Will use again!

We love it. It looks terrible, but tastes awesome. My kids like it with rice better than pasta. I find if I use an italian dressing with balsamic vinegar or darker spices the chicken is darker and looks better when all mixed up. Tastes even better the next day. My kids are boys ages 4,7,8. This was a huge hit even with company and requested again and again!

OK. Dont get your hopes up. This recipe needs a lot of flair to it. I had to add so much to boost up the flavor, BLAND. My son liked it... other than that, I am still waiting on my husband to say something... not sure if its a keeper..

Very good.  Creamy and delicious.  I only left the chicken in the crockpot for 4.5 hours and it was still delicious and very tender.  Will make again!

This recipe is a definite keeper!  Only 4 stars because I personally will need to play with it to create something a little betterâ€¦I say a little because the dish is quite tasty as is, but I do feel that it is missing something.  All in all, I enjoyed it and my family did too, so itâ€™s absolutely worth trying!  Thanks for sharing!

This rich & creamy meal was a hit with me & my family. We all went back for seconds though none of us were, admittedly, hungry!  I served it over rice.  I served it with a vegetable side dish (that I made up) of petite white corn & finely chopped zucchini in a puree'd tomato base which helped immensely in "cutting" the rich taste of the cream sauce.  The side was a good compliment to the wonderful flavor of the chicken. I will definately make this again.

I didnt like this.  No offense to the person who made up this recipe, but after I cooked it all day, I tasted it and threw it out, and warmed up some frozen chicken strips for dinner.  THis has a really different salty taste.  I wouldnt make this if I were you, It was a total waste of ingredients.

This dish was pretty good.  I omitted the cream cheese and used sour cream instead.  I also decided it was missing something and added some shredded cheese to the leftovers.  Leftovers were much better with the cheese.

This is always a hit at my house. Easy to prepare, my son and husband enjoy it (I like it too!), I am thinking about adding some veggies to perk up the color.  The first time I made it I had to force my husband to try a bite - then he went back for 2 servings!!

I did not love this.  I agree with other reviewers that it had a funny taste.  I halved the cream cheese, added chives, red pepper flakes and waterchestnuts, served it over rice with green beans on top and toasted almonds sprinkled over the green beans (if this sounds weird, pardon me Im pregnant).  I have to be honest though, my husband loved it.

Easy and tasty....we've either combined sour cream with the cream cheese, or just used sour cream (when we didn't have cream cheese in the fridge).  We've made several times.

Well, it seems that people either love this recipe or hate it. I, for one, thought it was a great basic recipe that can be tweaked according to personal preference! I don't have a slow cooker so I browned bite-sized pieces of chicken, and made the sauce in a separate pan (I added some garlic powder and onion powder). I poured the sauce over the chicken, and let it simmer for 10 mins. Delicious! (Note: those people who don't like anything too tangy might want to try Meijer-brand Italian Dressing which is pretty mild. Kroger-brand 'Zesty Italian Dressing,' on the other hand, definitely lives up to its name!) As you can see from my photo, it looks rather bland on the plate, so some mixed veggies might be nice. Thanks, Monika!

Very good!  My husband is lactose intolerant so I left out the cream cheese at the end and it was still very "creamy" (also less fattening!)  I will definitly make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy is right, but not as delicious as I had hoped.  Flavor was ok, but the appearance was not overly appetizing.  Couple people at my dinner really liked it, but I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

I found this recipe to be very tasty.  Nothing fancy, but good for an everyday meal.  I was going to try it over orzo, but forgot it at the store so I used long grain and wild rice which turned out very well.  I had sauteed mushrooms on the side.  Next time I think I will try the mushrooms in with the chicken.

YUMMY!! Since it was just the two of us I cut the amounts down, but the next day it was great for lunch. Reminded us of tuna casserole.  Will do this one again, but over english muffins or maybe grands biscuits :)

Didn't live up to the reviews.  Chicken was too dry and bland.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it ended up looking like a chicken version of "s.o.s." - it was tasty, but nobody wanted to eat it based on the way it looked.  It actually tasted pretty good cold, spread on crackers the next day - almost like a chicken pate.  I don't think I'll make this one again, but I would definitely recommend adding the rest of the can of chicken broth, as it's way too thick.

Love this recipe!!! Could not be any easier, even with the substitutions I made from using what I had in the house.  I used frozen chicken breasts and added what was left of the Italian dressing bottle and 3/4 bottle of roasted red pepper dressing.  When the kids came home from school, I swear they were drooling.  Drained off almost all, but not all of the dressing and mixed in a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, about 2 oz. cream cheese and 4 T. sour cream, 1 cup vegetable broth, and they loved it!!! Looked like a chicken strogranoff over noodles.  Everyone devoured it and couldn't wait to tear into it the next day for leftovers, which usually never happens.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a quick and easy meal that I will make again.  It would be a great meal to serve a large crowd.  Here are the changes I made to the recipe: I only used 4 chicken breasts, after removing the italian dressing I added approximately 4 tablespoons of the italian dressing into the cream cheese mixture, I added a lot of garlic and other spices to the cream cheese mixture, and I served the meal over egg noodles.

This was really very easy, and very good.  The chicken needed to be watched and stirred because there wasn't a lot of extra liquid with just the Italian dressing in the bottom of the crockpot.

This really was good!  I used a can of chicken broth instead of just the one cup so there was more sauce.  I then served it over kluski egg noodles.  My 8 year old son had three helpings!

This recipe was as easy as its title.  I really enjoyed dumping my frozen chicken breast and dressing (used Newmen's Own Cesear Dressing b/c that's what I had) and leaving for a few hours.  I added Carne Asada seasoning instead of the suggested ones b/c we were going to have it with low carb tortillas.  It reminded me of a chicken sloppy joe.  I think I'll experiment with this one again.

After reading the reviews that stated there wasn't enough sauce, I decided to leave most of the italian dressing in the crockpot and added the soup mixture in with it.  I think that was a mistake--it was too tangy.  But, I think there's definite potential, so I will try it again, taking out the italian dressing and adding extra chicken broth instead.

I kept some of the Italian dressing when I added the rest of the ingredients.  Gives it a little "zip"!  Most excellent recipe!  The sauce is soooo good and the chicken just falls apart.

Ever since I received this recipe online, I have used it MANY times!!  My family loves it. In fact, when we went out of town, I made it for other family members and now they make it all the time as well!  It is delicious!!  My 2 and 3 yr olds eat every bit they are given, and many times ask for more!  One of our favorite meals!!

This has become a regular dish at our house.  It's delicious and so simple to put together!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and left a bit of the Italian dressing in when adding the cream cheese mixture.  Also, I don't shred the chicken.  I prefer it served whole over egg noodles.  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

this is a great base to add things too, first, it is really missing some garlic. I too added everything in at the same time, then just took all the chicken out of the cooker, shredded it and put it all back in and stirred it a lot until it lots all the clumps.  I will use asparagus for some color near the end.  This can make a lot of food, i have no idea how much chicken i put in, but over egg noodle pasta it will feed two for a full week easily.

I don't really like chicken, but I really liked this!! It had a nice creamy tangy flavor that really hit the spot for me.  I wasn't quite sure what to "do" with it, so I spooned it on top of rice.  It was good, but I'll try noodles next time to see how that does.

I made this recipe using a mix of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and boneless, skinless chicken thighs and instead of using the Italian dressing I used powdered Ranch dressing reconstituted with 2 cups of water. I also added mushrooms at the same time I added the cream cheese towards the end. I blended the cream cheese with a hand mixer and it was much smoother. This is very rich and tasty. A little on the watery side so I will cut back on the water next time. I served it over rice and it is yummy!

Although this recipe tasted great, the way it looked took away a little.  I had to keep reminding myself that it was chicken breast (can't bring myself to eat dark meat).  The cream cheese never thoroughly melted so there were little white pieces throughout.  Nevertheless, we all liked the taste.  My three-year-old ate his entire serving--a miracle!  Of course my husband, after eating two platefuls, did help him a little.  Served this over egg noodles with a salad and Pillsbury breadsticks. Yum!

I think this recipe is good. My family all liked it.  I added 1/4 the cream cheese, a little garlic  and onion powder and used 1/2 cup of the reserved italian dressing that the chicken cooked in.  I also added parsley for some color.  Maybe I might add some sour cream next time.  

NOTE ABOUT COLOR: If anyone doesn't like the white colors of some gravies and sauces, there is a product called Kitchen Bouquet that you can buy to add a little flavor, but mostly brown color.  I use it in all my gravies and storganoffs.

I was quite happy with the way this turned out!  I added lots of garlic (because my boyfriend and I enjoy garlic A LOT!)  So, that was the only adjustment.  It was VERY easy, and great since my chicken hadn't been thawed.  We will cook this one again!  Thanks!

This is the first recipe I've tried on my new slow cooker and I must say, it's quite different, but good.  I used frozen chicken thighs, and threw in all the ingredients in the pot (only used 1/2 the cream cheese) and let it cook over night.  I served these over pasta and it was a bit..sour due to the dressing, but it wasn't overwhelming, still good though.  I can't imagine serving this over rice though, the rice would soak up all the juices and it'd make it too sour.  Good though, probably will make again (maybe even use sour cream).

I only use 3 chicken breasts.  I like to serve it over white rice.  Good Chicken Stroganoff recipe.

This recipe was very good, chicken was super tender and flavorful as well.I used Greek Feta & Oregano dressing instead of Italian and it bursts with flavor.

I was looking forward to this meal since this was the first time I ever used my crock pot.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was tuna noodle cassarole in texture, and my 7 year old picky daughter would not even take a second taste.  Hubby did not care for it either, but 5 year old son loved it.  Guess it's just a matter of taste.

The title speaks for itself! I followed the advice of others and used half the cream cheese that the recipe called for. I cooked for 4 hours on High and the chicken turned out a little dry, however it had an excellent flavor. Served over warm egg noodles, there were no leftovers! Thanks for sharing.

This is so easy and tastes delicious!!! I used 8 chicken breasts and only chopped them instead of shredding.Instead of the chicken broth I used the juices from the chicken and italian dressing. I did use the whole thing of cream cheese and it was just right. Served it over bisquits as a few of the other reviews said. Thank you for such a great and easy recipe!!!! I think that next time I will add some chopped mushrooms to it :)

Completely delish!!! Absolutely loved it. As with many other users of this recipe - I didn't follow the instructions exactly. I only used about half the cream cheese, most of the can of broth, and left half of the juices in. Had to add a little cornstarch to thicken it a little. Will probably use less broth next time, but there will DEFINITELY be a next time. Kids loved it and are usually picky.

These were very good!  I did mix a little of the dressing in with the soup mixture to spice it up a bit, and added italian seasoning since I didn't have basil.  This is a definate keeper!

This is excellent!!!!  I changed it just a little bit, I cooked it in ceasar dressing, and instead of using boneless breasts, I cooked a split chicken.  Once the chicken was done, I dumped the dressing and picked it off the bones.  I used a while can of chicken broth instead of a cup.  The seasonings make it perfect!!!  I am serving it over egg noodles.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I thought my hubby didn't like cream sauces, but since he ordered chicken alfredo last time we went out, thought I'd try it.

Hubby ate it, but wasn't too crazy about it and reminded me that he doesn't like cream sauces. ?  Whatever!

ANYWAY, gave the leftovers to my folks as I didn't want it to go to waste.  They ate it over Peppridge Farms Pastry shells and RAVED about it. Mom said it was very tasty! Just goes to show you that reviews are entirely subjective.  lol.

This was very tasty. I used FF Italian dressing and FF cream cheese and it didn't seem to take anything away from the flavor. The chicken was incredibly tender and it makes a great leftover, eaten cold as chicken salad on bread or bagels. Thanks!

This recipe is fantastic!  The first time I made it, I used smoked turkey legs because I had no chicken.  My husband got into it before I got home and it was almost gone so I was unable to prepare the second half of the recipe.  I was able to finish the recipe the second time and it was excellent!

My husband and I loved this recipe! The only thing that I changed was I cubed the chicken instead of shredding it. We served it over rice. The next time though, I am going to try making it in a skillet, instead of the slow cooker and serve it over pasta.

I threw in frozen chicken and cooked it overnight. I served over 1 pound of pasta and still have some leftover sauce. The resulting sauce looks like tuna (used in tuna sandwich) but the taste is good and chicken is tender.

This was a very tasty, Stroganoff-like dish. Very good on a cold winter night. Don't know if kids would like it because I don't have any, but my boyfriend liked it and he's kind of a big kid! I recommend the Good Seasons Italian dressing mix for the dressing.

My family and I were not crazy about this recipe. The Italian dressing and cream cheese made it taste weird. To get rid of the weird taste I added egg noodles, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and a 10 oz. can of chunk chicken. It still had a weird taste after that but at least it was edible.

I have to tell you this recipe is Wonderful!!  I would not have thought the ingredients together would have tasted so good.  Also, being able to put frozen chicken in the crock pot was an added bonus.  My husband and I both loved it.  I want to try this one out on family and friends.  Thanks for such a easy and convenient recipe!

We have had this several times and I have always doubled the sauce.  I just put it all in my crock pot and use my hand blender to mix it well!  We love it and rearely have leftovers, But there are 6 adults in my house!

This is an absolutely delicious way to cook chicken. My picky husband loved it. As with many crockpot recipes, it tastes better than it looks. Next time I'll try low-fat cream cheese and Italian dressing.

I was a little wary of trying this dish. It just sounded a tad strange, but, I tried it and have to say it was pretty good. My husband loved it as did the kids. It's not something I want every week, but I will certainly be making it again. I did have to add some garlic, but I add garlic to everything.

My husband loved this dish. Super easy to make. I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe but didn't care for the consistency. I would make this again but would not shred the chicken. Breaking it up in chunks would create a much better consistency. I added mushrooms and peas but would leave out the peas next time.  Susan B. Kingwood, TX

I didn't particularly like it but my husband and 3 yr old loved it.  I tried it w/ noodles and rice and they both preferred the noodles.

My sister just had twins so I was looking for some new recipes to cook so I could give her a variety of ready-to-eat meals.  This one looked interesting - a very different combination of ingredients, all of which I had on hand.  It was very tasty and I ended up making a second batch so my family could have some, too!

This definitely has a different taste to it.  We liked it ok, but will probably only use it once in awhile.

This will be a great cold-weather meal.  We will make it again.  May add some color (vegetables) next time.  Thank you for the recipe.

My son begs for this meal.  I've used boned chicken breasts and easily removed the bones just prior to shredding the chicken.  I've served this over rice and over baked potatoes.

We enjoyed this recipe.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  I did substitute cr. mushroom soup for the chicken soup and left the chicken in chunks.  I will make it again.

I tried this recipe the other night for dinner.  It was great!  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much served over rice with a side of vegetables.  It cooked quicker than I anticipated, only 4 hours.  The chicken just fell apart and didn't look that appetizing, but was delicious!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I added some garlic powder to it and served it over rotini.  It was very rich, though, so I might cut back on the cream cheese next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I put the whole package of cream cheese, the whole can of soup and broth, and added cyanne pepper and rotini noodles at the very last 30 minutes.  My husband and his friend kept coming back for more!!!

My husband and I love this recipe-- it's become a regular meal for us! I make a whole bag of egg noodles with it, and serve it on top of the noodles.  Then the leftover chicken mixture and noodles are mixed together -- it keeps pretty well.

 Thanks to Monika Polly for sharing it with us!!  :)

I enjoyed this recipe because it is so easy and by cooking the chicken with the italian dressing, it comes out so tender. The sauce was a little to rich but it sure was good!

Very good, moist and delicious! I admit that I added frozen peas and a small can of sliced mushrooms. I'll make this one again!
