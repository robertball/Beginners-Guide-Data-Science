Awesome soup, but with a few modifications: substitute cream for milk, 4 cups of chicken broth for water, and add one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also add kosher salt and lots of pepper, and onion powder and garlic powder. I added chopped celery and leeks as well, and omitted the peas.  Definitely be sure to simmer this soup for a while so that the potatoes can get mealy- this thickens the soup nicely.  My whole family loved this soup and went back for seconds!

This soup was easy to make and truly delicious. U can vary the thickness of the soup by controlling the amount of water and milk. It was very soothing and satisfying. A must make!

This is a good basic recipe that can be tweaked according to personal preference. I personally used fresh baby carrots and frozen peas. I also added a splash of heavy cream to make it richer and thicker. The soup turned out rich, hearty, and perfect for this cold snowy day. Thanks!

I love preparing soup from scratch. This is by far the very best basic recipe I've ever made! If I could give it 10 stars, I would. I boiled 2 whole chickens then picked it from the bone, I added a bag of mixed frozen vegies (not canned), 1 can cream of chicken soup & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  My clients loved it & my family said, "This is GREAT!"  This is definately a keeper.

Oh this was a great recipe!! My son picked it out and what a hit! We added more vegetables and used chicken broth instead of water and it was yummy! Will do this again. Sending it to my other son away at college. Easy enough and inexpensive enough to make on his budget.

This recipe was good but there wasn't much flavor. I added cheddar cheese right before I ate it and it added A LOT more flavor. I had to cook my potatoes about 30 mins more than the recipe said. Good if you don't have many ingredients but defiantly not the best.

A very good quick, easy, and very hearty stew.  Perfect if you're in a hurry.  I added a little bit of chipostle salsa on top to give it a little bit of extra smoky flavor and spice.

Like previous reviews suggested, I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. Instead of cooking the chicken in the pot, I grilled it first. I nixed the corn, but added chopped celery and garlic powder. I also added about 4oz of velveeta and 4oz of shredded cheddar cheese. It came out really good! We all had second helpings of it. I'm definitely going to make it again.  Probably do roasted garlic next time, and maybe add a dollop of sour cream upon serving.

Loved this recipe!  I added a little bit of heavy whipping cream to make it creamier and some seasonings so it wouldn't be bland.  I also added some fresh zucchini and a jar of mushrooms.  Excellent!

As is, I don't think this soup would have nearly enough flavor for my taste. I made some substitutions that made it turn out AWESOME, although more of a stew than a soup. First, after I added the onion I also added about a tablespoon of minced garlic. I did not add water, I added chicken broth. And since I had it in my fridge and it needed to be used, I added some heavy cream. I wanted a stew-y consistency so I mixed some corn starch with the cream to thicken the soup up. Finally, I added just a little rosemary. The rosemary threw me over the moon.

A good basic recipe. I ommited all the vegetables and added shredded cheese. I think I combined the basics of this recipe and the basics of another souple, golden potato soup on this website. Sounds like a good soup though

I changed it up a little as well. I used cream of onion soup, chicken broth, and a bag of veg. medley. I cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of butter and tossed it all together turned out creamy and tasty! everyone loved it! thanks again!

It was wonderful, rich, hearty, flavorful and easy to clean up. I did make a few adjustments to work with what I had on hand. I subbed canned pumpkin for the peas, and skipped the onion and hot pepper sauce. I used chicken stock and the canning liquid from the veggies in place of the milk. I also finished mine by slightly mashing the soup so the whole thing was thick with small chunks in it rather then liquid with large chunks but thats personal preference.

I'm only giving this a two star as written.  It was a good base recipe & probably should be a three but I'm leaning (this is a standard tator soup recipe with junk added in and I love regular tator soup with nothing more than s&p but I/we felt with the veggies for some reason it needed more).  With the changes hubby said it was good and I could fix again which says something at my house.  So for those that felt the same way here's what I did (& I don't like using canned soup)--take it or leave it.  I added two cans of cream of chicken & one can of cheddar cheese.  A pinch of sage, a teaspoon of garlic powder, a fourth of cup of sour cream, a cup of mixed blend mexican cheese & alot of pepper.  I prefer spicy, hubby doesn't & I added salsa to my bowl.  Again good base recipe & I will fix again but will keep playing with it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've just made this soup. It is delicious. I used chicken stock instead of water. I think next time I'll use heavy cream instead of milk to get it a little creamier. I also added a teaspoon of 35 spice blend to add more flavor. It is yummy. The Oreo, cook and ready in time is also quite accurate. Nice!

My six year old and 2 year old loved it!   My husband added tons of hot sauce.  I just added salt and pepper to mine.  I really enjoyed it.   The only change I made was that I boiled the chicken the day before.  I used the stock from that in place of the water.  I used skim milk and a whole 15.5 oz can of corn.

I have only tried this while it is still cooking, but I love it it. I added 4 oz of cream cheese to the pot that will serve 6. It has made the difference b/c it was kinda bland before but great now. That and plenty of salt. I will serve it with homemade biscuits, my husband is really going to like it!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  The only reason why I'm giving this four stars and not five is because the recipe definitly needs a few tweaks.  For the broth, I used cream of chicken, chicken broth, milk and SOME water.  I really think if I used all water it would have been a tasteless soup.  I plan on making this soup again and again!

I tried to like it, but it was so bland. There was no flavor, and I even tried some of the other suggestions. Sorry, but I'll look elsewhere next time.

Excellent.  I used cream instead of milk- and mashed half of the potatoes with the cream and a little broth.  When I added that back to the main mixture- wow!

This soup recipe would be much better with fresh vegetables rather than canned.

I had leftover chicken tenders, potatoes and green beans w peas. I just cut the tenders into chunks, used two cups of milk. Didn't use all the other veggies, just what I had leftover, added my own seasonings (I don't measure, just a dash). Also, to thicken up the soup I used some flour, works great when you don't want to wait!

This was a good base recipe! I added a lot of herbs including dried rosemary, oregano, and basil and fresh cilantro. I also added fresh garlic, garlic powder and onion powder, as well as two beaten eggs at the very end. One person’s recommendation to add cheese on the finished meal was fantastic! Tasted like a loaded baked potato.

I used a can of chicken broth and added a little water, I also used half n half instead of milk to make it a touch creamier. Great way to use up fresh veggies in the fridge, I sauted fresh carrots, fresh garlic, and onion. I then added a bit of frozen spinach for some extra color. A llittle bit of shredded cheese and sprinkle bacon bits on top. Serve with salad, easy weeknight dinner!

I modified this recipe slightly, but it turned out fantastic. Instead of butter, I rendered some bacon and used the bacon grease to brown my chicken in batches. Then, I used the bacon grease to also cook the onions. Near the end of cooking the onions, I added a clove of minced garlic and cooked that just until aromatic. Once the onions were cooked, I deglazed the pot with a cup of water and added the chicken, potatoes, a can of corn, a can of carrots, 1 cup half and half (instead of milk), the bacon I had cooked earlier, and then water to cover everything per the original recipe and then seasoned to taste with salt, black pepper, and Franks Red Hot. I left the peas out because I'm not a fan of those. The whole family (9 yr old, 11 yr old and both adults) loved the soup, especially during this cold weather!

By far the best soup I have ever made. I added a few cloves of garlic when Browning the onions, used the thighs from a roast chicken instead of breasts, homemade chicken stock in place of the water, I also added fresh chillis and diced chorizo for an extra kick. Garnished with habanero tobasco,  a glug of olive oil, spring onions and seseme seeds.

I've never made potato soup before and this looked like the easiest to try.  I used it as a base and added a few more things as other reviewers suggested.  I added a lot of spices, bacon, a can of condensed cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup and some shredded cheese at the end of cooking.  It came out yummy!  I didn't want to wait for my husband to come home before I ate a bowl!  Biscuits would go lovely with this.

I think this is a great base for a potatoe soup.  i would make this again.  As with any soup you have to make it to your liking but before adding any other spices i tasted this as is and i must say for a simple soup it is good and great for those picky children.  after I added some rosemary and lemon spice.  i also added some minced garlic and I had some shredded zucchini and celery.  My chicken had been bbq'd previously so I just took the chicken off the bone and it made for a quick and easy meal.  thanks for sharing

It's a really good recipe, and easy to prepare too! I really liked it, and added some prego mushroom herb sauce for even more flavour. Excellent.
