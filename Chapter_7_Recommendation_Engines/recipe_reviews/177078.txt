I really think people should take note to the user who doubled her sauce.  I only used 1 package (2lb) of boneless thighs (bone-in works fine though!) and 1.5 sweet potatoes, and the tops were burning and black beans dried out because it was not covered in liquid.  So, I doubled the cumin, allspice, garlic, 1.5C salsa (light, med, hot doesn't matter), and 2/3C broth.  Use a slotted spoon if you don't want soupy, but this really wasn't!  Used box of uncle ben's chicken wild rice (with the seasoning) to serve on top of, and people go ga-ga over all the flavor.  This definitely makes the house smell warm.  We "HATE" sweet potatoes, so my husband cringed when I told him what this was made of, yet this is now both of our favorite meals.  I'm so glad I trusted the reviews.  Also added a can of corn, and glad I did as it was the perfect mix of flavors!

we loved this!! i used a 3 lb pack of chicken thighs and drumsticks, skinned. i skipped the pan browning step. based on other reviews, i made the following changes: 1 can black beans instead of 2, 1 can of corn, 2 cups medium salsa, 5 garlic cloves, and 1 cup chicken broth, all other ingredients stayed the same. i cooked on low for over 6 hours and it was divine. made with puerto rican steamed rice but would also go well with brown rice or couscous as others suggested.

Brilliant recipe.  So flavorful.
And let me add this serving idea:  first time around we did the rice.
SECOND time around I took the mix and stuffed it into hard taco shells with tomato, lettuce and sour cream.  THAT is how this is supposed to be eaten.  The corn flavor and the crunch took it to a whole new level.

This is probably my favorite crockpot recipe ever. I used bone-in chicken thighs (skinned) and cooked it for 5 hours on high. I served it over cooked brown rice with fresh squeezed lime and chopped cilantro on top. Super easy and incredibly yummy!

I made this for supper tonight and even my picky husband loved it. I went by the reviews and added more liquid - 1-1/2 cups salsa and 2 cups chicken broth. Since we don't like dark meat, I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts. Another change was using a can of jalapinto beans instead of black beans since my husband doesn't care for black beans and I added a can of MexiCorn. When I stirred it after I got home from work, the chicken shredded itself so it was like a thick chicken stew. I served it over brown rice. I will definitely be making it again.

This was delicious! Because I have a young child, I modified it slightly to minimize the heat spice of the salsa. Instead I doubled the chicken broth and combined it with 8 oz of organic tomato sauce. I also added half a chopped onion.

I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe called for and it still turned out amazing. The chicken was so tender! I served it with whole wheat couscous, which was a perfect combination.

This recipe was fantastic!  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my regular line-up: simple, delicious, rich, hearty! All the substitutions were helpful, but I prepared it exactly to recipe, except that I did not have chicken broth: subbed water and appopriate salt, and still amazing!  I think it is important to prepare a new dish exactly to recipe before substitutions are made or suggested.  Otherwise an entirely new dish is being prepared!

This was so yummy! I put everything in the slow cooker at once and cooked on low for 7 hrs. Chicken came out great. I also added some corn. I served over brown rice and next time I'll add a dollop of sour cream.

Delicious, I added the corn, used vegetable broth instead, and used my own spices such as cumin, parsley, cardamom, tumeric, nutmeg, basil, red pepper flakes, and cinnamon, just a few shakes of each. Can't wait to make it again.

Fan-freaking-tastic!  This was soooo goood!  I used boneless skinless thighs, 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, 1 chopped onion, and 5 or 6 cloves of garlic.  Also used a few bay leaves for good measure.  I ended up using triple the cumin/allspice along with salt/pepper.  Skipped the browning process as it was totally unneccessary.  I was going to skip the sweet potatoes but after reading the others reviews saying it was a must I went ahead with it.  I'm glad I did!  Also, doubled the liquid by using 16oz jar of medium salsa, & 1-1/2c chicken broth.  Cooked on high for 5 hours and thicked with a bit of cornstarch at the end.  Served with white rice.  Delicious!  Used the leftover mixture and made burritoes the next day.  Heaven!

Very good recipe! I exchanged one can of corn for a can of beans, and I love it. Next time I make it i will add a few more seasonings, however as it is allows the eater to season it to thier taste. I also cooked it on high for 5 hours and the chicken was perfect.

This was the easiest, most flavorful recipe that I have ever used.  I did not change a thing and was blow away by the flavor.  I am a person who does not like to cook, so this the perfect recipe for me.  RORO in San Pedro

This is a winner - exceptionally tasty, easy to make, and good for you.  I have made it for family and guests and it has been DEVOURED by everyone.  Although I made a few changes to the recipe, I did NOT add additional broth.  One of the beauties of slow cooking is that only a tiny amount of liquid is added.  The meat and vegetables release their juices during the long, slow cooking and produce an extremely flavorful broth.  I think that adding extra broth only dilutes the flavor.  I also added 2 or 3 times the amount of fresh cilantro and did NOT brown the cilantro with the chicken, just sprinkled it in the slow cooker.  In fact, I did not brown the chicken at all and detected no decrease of flavor.  Be sure not to use boneless thighs.  The bones add lots of flavor and can easily be removed before serving.  At the recommendation of others, I also added a can of drained corn. Because we love it, we used 3 lg. sweet potatoes and both cans of black beans.  Cook on slow for 8-10 hours and on high for at least 4 or 5 hours.  Do early in the day and allow dish to "rest" for maximum flavor.

This was so easy and flavorful!!  I did substitute boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used dark red kidney beans instead of the black beans and I used flat-leaf parsley instead of cilantro. Also, I used chicken stock instead of broth. I also added one good sized chopped onion and Mexican oregano.  I used mild salsa to cut the heat.  This is one of the best slow-cooker recipes I have ever eaten!!  I let it cook for 6 hours and then it  sat on warm for almost an hour. I served it on long grain and wild rice. What a fabulous dinner we had!!  :-)

Very bland but I did use normal salsa so it could have been me. I loved the veggies and also took another reviewers suggestion and used (1) can of corn and (1) can black beans. I was going to use sofrito but I wanted to see how this would be with the cilantro. It smelled great while browning but did absolutely nothing to add flavor to the end product. This step did not seem necessary. I would try this recipe again but add my own twists however the recipe was appreciated ;)

I found a new weekly standby recipe! Thigh meat is perfect for this recipe--I used bone in chicken thighs, and the meat literally fell off the bone. Excellent!

We loved this!  Even my husband, who is reluctant to try anything "different" like it.  The first time I made this I cut the sweet potatoes into bite sized chunks and they became over cooked. (tasted fine but totally fell apart while spooning out onto plates.) Next time I cut them much larger and it was fine.  Just love the blend of these flavors!!

This is one of the BEST recipes for any type of entertaining. A few things to consider: I chop up my chicken thighs into large chunks (which they don't specify) which helps it break down in slow cooker. I also add a bit more liquid than called for, depending on the chunkiness of the salsa - I added 1/4 cup more chicken broth and a 1/4 cup more salsa. 2 cans of beans is TOO much bean for me, so I subbed in a can of corn instead. 
**The key is: at the end, when it's cooked, take out about 1/2 cup of liquid from the crock pot and put into a bowl. Whisk in about 1 -2 TBSP of corn starch and pour back into the crock pot. Stir and cook on high for 15. This thickens it enough for putting into a tortilla (if you want!)

This was hearty, satisfying dish when served on rice (cooked in chicken broth and garlic granules rather than water).  I could see doing this another time with garam masala rather than cumin and allspice.

Absolutely delicious - gave the chicken thighs a wonderful flavour and they were moist and tender.  My husband absolutely loved it - will definitely make again.
(just a very few leftovers for my lunch to-morrow).

I made this and it turned out okay.  I served it over brown rice.  I had to add more stock(~1 c total)  and the sweet potatoes ended up as mush.  I shredded the chicken and it was good.  I had a lot left over so I turned them into baked enchiladas by rolling about 2 T of the mixture in a corn tortilla with a little shredded cheddar cheese.  I topped them with the remaining 1/2 of the hot salsa I had left and about 1 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.  I got about 15 enchiladas in a 9x13 pan.  I baked them for 25 min at 375.  The enchiladas were WAY better than the original recipe.  If I make them again I will probably add a can of corn to the mixture.

This was so good!  I did as others said and doubled the salsa, chicken broth and spices, and used some frozen corn in place of one of the cans of black beans.  I did not sear my chicken, I just threw it all in the slow cooker.  Turned out great and perfect consistency to serve over rice!

This was very good! I used 8 skinless chicken thighs and only 1 can of black beans. I followed reviewer chef joy's tip about increasing the salsa, chicken broth and spices, came out perfect. I just had mild salsa so I just added some hot sauce to the salsa to give this dish some proper heat.

I'am all about flavor...and I would have to agree with some of the other reviews...it was lacking just that.Everyone that I served it to said it was delish but I wasn't convinced.Thank Goodness for the lime because to me that is what saved this recipe.

Fabulous!  I used different beans and I put in pumpkin.  This was just delicious.  Thanks!

Followed other reviews and doubled the sauce and used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn.  Used a whole, cut up chicken because that's what I had. Very good.

Flavorful, moist, easy to make and absolutely delicious. Made it a few weeks ago. Will surely do so again. Flavors develop with time and so, it was outstanding as leftovers, too.

Very good. I used half the amount of meat (all I had) and ended up not browning it due to laziness. I should have spent more quality time trimming fat from the thighs, the end result was a little too greasy for me. Those two items are my fault so I'm not counting them in the rating. I replaced one can of black beans with chick peas, worked very well.  Love the flavors, but a bit weak. I ended up adding bay leaves, more garlic, more salsa and some onion. Five hours on low and the chicken had shredded itself and the sweet potato was soft without being mushy.  Healthy and warm in the tummy.

The mix of flavors was perfect, and the chicken was falliing off the bone, it was so tender and juicy.  I will be making this again for sure!

This was an incredibly delicious stew!  Let's just start by saying this makes a big pot of stew, enough for 8 persons (at least) when served over rice.  Just a couple of subs, I added only one large sweet potato and a can of Rotel in place of the salsa.  I also added a little more chicken broth, but it wasn't necessary.  I'm not a huge dark meat fan, but tell you what, I'm won over on thigh meat!  Loved this dish, thanks for a terrific submission, I will make this many more times.

This is my kids (11,15,18) absolute favorite crock pot meal!  Even though one is normally suspicious of cilantro, the other doesn't normally eat sweet potatoes!
Try it!

As written the dish makes the 3 star list for me.  While I thought the dish was very good and tasty (I will make it again)  I hate it when I have to read through the reviews to find out you need more liquid in the dish, particularly on a dish that has 248 reviews with a 4.5 rating.  If you have to make changes to a dish, rate it a bit lower, I think.  Anyway, I doubled the sauce, because it wasn't enough liquid to even cover the potatoes.  I did double all the sauce ingredients, including the salsa, next time, I will use  a med. salsa, to tone down the heat.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change anything else.  BTW, cooked on top of stove, in dutch oven for about 1.5 hours on low.  I have also saved this recipe and will make it again with the additional sauce.

This probably won't make my list of all-time favorites.  It was OK, but for all these ingredients, I feel it should have packed more flavor!  I did not double the sauce, but followed the recipe and cooked it on LOW for 4.5 hours.  The chicken was tender, the potatoes were done, the bell pepper was mushy.  It was an interesting mix of flavors, just not one I will likely repeat.

This is absolutely awesome! I had left over roast chicken from the night before so I just pulled that apart and added everything to the slow cooker. Decreased black beans to 1 can, added 1 can of corn(drained), did't have allspice so just omitted that and added 1 diced red onion(because I put an omoin in just about everything). When it was done I squeezed 1 lime over top which enhanced the flavour and gave it the perfect finish. Try this recipe...you will love it!

This is a very different chicken dish!  I think it would be great as a potluck dish, especially since it is so painless to make.  We found the flavors grew on us, the more we ate, the better we liked it!   Excellent served with cornbread.

This was great!  I used frozen chicken breasts and didn't brown ahead of time.  I had to go to the store for the red peppers so they only got about 2 hours of the 5 that I cooked it, but were fine.  My slow cooker has numbers 1 through 5 and I used 3 for about 3 hours but worried that the chicken wouldn't be cooked enough, but it was thawed enough to cut it up, and then I turned the heat up to 4 and it started boiling after about an hour.  Turned it down to 2 for an hour while getting the rest of the dinner ready.  My husband had his over rice but I had mine plain in a bowl with the lime and some light sour cream.  We had it with corn bread, salad and fruit.  (More than enough food!)  High fiber, very low fat, and delicious!  My husband said we should serve it for company.

I thought this was terrific. I did add more liquid and spices, which I thought was a wise choice since I was using boneless chicken breast (though I should've salted the pot more after adding the extra liquid). I omitted the cilantro (can't stand the stuff) and used fava beans, as the store had no black beans, but I don't think the different beans changed the flavor or the texture. I shredded the chicken and put it all inside tortillas with brown rice. Yummy! I'll definitely make this again.

I was looking for a healthy slow cooker recipe that did not have any type of cream of whatever soup in it. My revision is only good if you plan to shred the chicken breast.

I made this with chicken breast for the sake of being healthy. I used 3 lbs of chicken which was about 6 large breasts. 6 is way too much if you are shredding them. I would only do 3-4 next timing.

I did not brown them, just threw them in the bottom of the crock pot after rinsing them.

I used a whole small jar of mild Newman's salsa which came out to 1.5 Cups. I did not want to open a new container of chicken broth so I used 1.5 cups of water. I did not have fresh cilantro so I used some dry and pre chopped garlic in the jar. I left out the oil.

I cooked on low for about 6-7 hours. After that I pulled the chicken out and shredded it (about hald of it because after shredding 3 breasts I did not want the base to become dry). At this point the base of the sauce was really liquid, but once the shredded chicken is added it comes out perfect! The sweet potatoes were still semi firm and not mushy. 

This came out great! Will make it again for sure.

Flavor was slightly above average. Nothing special. Added corn, doubled the sauce and spices as others suggested. Still was lacking something, so I added 4 oz of cream cheese. Better.

Absolutely delicious! On the advice of other reviews I substituted one can of corn for one can of beans and increased the salsa. I used Newman's Own tequila lime salsa, added a sliced poblano pepper and a sliced onion. Instead of just thighs, I used chicken quarters (legs and thighs). Cooked it on high for 2 hours, then low for another 3 hours. Served this with white rice and broccoli. So good! I've been looking for a latin chicken dish that is similar to the ones served at the hole-in-the-wall cantinas here in south Florida and this is it! It is so good, I can't stop eating even though I'm full!

These flavors real come together, delicious.  I only had 6 chicken thighs ( 1 1/2 lb.) I cut all the ingredients in half, still a whole teaspoon of cumin was too strong. Like other reviewers I added extra broth and it needed it.  After browning the chicken I deglazed the pan and used the drippings and an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth. The sweet potatoes were good but next time I think I'll use white.  Thanks Upstate NY cooker.

This was okay. I'll probably make it again just for some variety. I used chicken tenders.  I really wish I HADN'T added corn. The corn overpowers this dish.

we used frozen chicken breasts & instead of browning then in the frying pan, we just threw everything in the crockpot.  that way, we didn't need chicken broth, so we just dumped the black beans in without draining them.

This was amazing,  I loved the way all the flavors complemented each other, no changes needed for this great recipe!  The chicken was so succulent, I think the browning step is critical, don't skip it!

Pretty good overall. I agree w/others that you can use skinless breasts if you prefer and either way you can skip the skillet step altogether. I replaced the cup of salsa and the chicken broth with two cans of diced tomatoes (include the liquid). I also recommend not putting the cilantro in the pot at all. Chop it coarsely and use it as a fresh garnish. Cilantro is almost always better as a fresh herb than a cooked one. I also added a chopped onion. I cooked everything on LOW for 7 hours. Longer than that and the chicken gets dry.

A new "go-to". I've personalized this recipe for my family by increasing the broth to 1 cup and substituting a can of drained corn for 1 can of beans. I've done away with first step of browning the chicken and have increased the slow-cooker temp to "high". Lots of positive feedback from all those that I've served it to. Love it.

This is very very good :) We love cilantro and it really stood out in this dish. I also added some cubed butternut squash and a can of corn. Can't wait to make this again!

I added the extra chicken broth as suggested and I'm serious...Scoop it into your bowl and squeeze a lime wedge on top with a dalop of sour cream- THE LIME MAKES IT! YUM! My whole family loves it. I served it with cornbread as suggested by other reviewers and it was a perfect meal! Definately a keeper!

I loved this! I cooked it for 6 hours because it fit my work/gym schedule. haha. I didn't brown the chicken first because slow-cooker to me means just throw it all in there and leave it alone. Also, I realized I had no all spice. :( But I googled a substitute and mixed some cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon together and it worked because the spices were perfect. And the kicker...it's super healthy!! Thanks for the easy, healthy and more importantly TASTY recipe. Chicken just fell apart. **Oh as others said, I doubled the liquid to ensure everything was well covered.

Great recipe!  I suggest doubling the sauce and cutting the sweet potatoes fairly small so they're not hard when everything else is done.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. It was hearty,comforting and delicious! The potatoes didn't  have that  "yammy"flavor, instead they gave the dish a perfect natural sweetness. I used 505 Salsa (made in New Mexico), extra homemade black beans, three large sweet potatoes, a red bell pepper chopped instead of sliced,  2-3 cups water with chicken flavored "Better than Bullion" and the rest of the spices suggested.  I made sure everything was covered in liquid so that it didn't dry out like others had experienced.  The flavors reminded my husband and I of chipotle or Café Rio. Will definitely make again!

I made quite a few changes,  but it was excellent regardless.   I used chicken breast,  and also skipped the sauté step.   I used dried cilantro;  skipped the salsa and mixed in a packet of taco seasoning with the chicken broth.   I added frozen corn.   Because of the taco seasoning,  I didn't add the cumin or allspice.   I just added in fresh minced garlic.   Only used one can of beans.   Will make many more times with these changes.

This has a fantastic flavor! I broke my golden rule, I changed the original recipe based on a few reviews & the picture. It looks dry so I followed reviewers suggestions-wrong ( now I'm about to let you make up your own mind whether or not you want to try my changes), I wasn't looking for soup. Some of the changes I will keep: chicken breasts cut into strips; all cilantro chopped, the 2nd one increased to 1/2 cup;2 red bell peppers chopped; 1/2 cup hot sauce-why scorch your taste buds when you can always add more at the table (Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce-Asian section grocery store); 1 Tbsp cumin; 1 tsp allspice; 6 garlic cloves; 1 Tbsp salt-added to the mixture poured over the top. I'm not big on sweet potatoes/yams (sweet potatoes are yellowish & firm, yams are redder & soft-not much difference in flavor) but this needs 2, they add to the overall flavor...just my 2 cents-the consciences of the table was, serve with lime, chopped cilantro, sour cream, chopped onion, etc. I server with rice-

This was surprisingly very good.  It had a lot of flavor and I like the sweet potatoes.  we didn't have all spice so we looked up what was in it and made some.  It was a little spicy next time I might use med salsa instead of hot. But then again it was a good hot and I was able to stand it and it didn't overpower the other flavors.

Made it to the tee.  However, realized the beans were not covered in the broth and were drying out (as other's had warned).  So, I doubled the broth mixture.  The recipe was good but not great.  I served with corn tortillas as well as just over rice.  Good for feeding a crowd-- made a ton, but not great.  However, one of my guest adored it and took all the leftovers home.  I was just hoping for the flavors to pop more, especially since lime juice usually does the trick and didn't in this case.

I really liked it, but my boyfriend who isn't a huge fan of black beans, sweet potatoes or cilantro didn't like it at all.
I also did one can black beans and one of corn. Yummy!!

Not good at all. The sweet potatoes were great, but that was about it. My husband and I were not fans of this meal at all. I'm latin and have never heard of any latin dishes being cooked with salsa - it should have been my first clue.

Yummy chicken, but the yams are entirely unnecessary. I doubled the salsa, which was great, and added corn which made it prettier. I took another reviewers ad IDE and doubled the soup too, but that turned out way too watery.

Yum!  I substituted a can of corn for one of the beans, increased the chicken broth, and added extra salsa and spices too.  I served with couscous and even my food snob of a husband (who doesn't believe in using a recipe) loved it.

Adopted many of the suggestions: extra broth, increased spices.  I used 'medium' salsa (the kind with black beans & corn) and the final product still needed more of a kick.  I served it with jasmine rice, additional fresh cilantro on top with a dollop of sour cream.  Fresh squeezed lime on top is a MUST!  Provided warm flour tortillas on the side.  I ended up spicing my plate up with a sprinkle of green jalapeno sauce.  Chicken thigh meat was sooo tender and really makes this dish special!  A really pretty dish - it just needs more zing!  Bonus: entire family loved it.

I love this recipe.  I make it at least every other week.  I put in a large can of chicken broth and turn it into a soup.  Since I have a hard time finding sweet potatoes, I just use 1-2 cans of sweet potatoes and rinse them well before throwing them in the crock pot.  I also substitute boneless skinless chicken breasts and shred the meat prior to serving.  I like to throw in a small onion and a cup or two of corn as well.  It is a delicious and well balanced meal!

We enjoyed this.  It has a unique flavor; a nice change of pace.  I didn't have any problems with enough liquid, it was fine.  I reduced the beans to one can and skipped the browning step.  Really good!

WINNER! I followed the recipe exactly. There was plenty of liquid, and potatoes were tender, not mushy. Lime wedges squeezed over dish makes it all come together. Aromatic and tastey!!

This was surprisingly good!  Didn't think the sweet potatoes would go well with the black beans but it did!  Might taste good with green bell pepper also (red peppers can get kinda pricey).

Delicious!  I wasn't sure about the sweet potatoes but they really worked.  I did as some others suggested and doubled the liquid (salsa, broth, and seasonings) and I also subbed a can of yellow corn for one can of black beans.  I used a pack of bone-in chicken thighs with skin and a small pack of drumsticks.  I skipped the browning part.  Mainly because of the sweet potatoes, it needed closer to 6 hours to cook.  I also thickened it with some corn starch at the end.  I served it over brown rice.  The flavors in this were awesome, and it was easy to throw together!

After reading other reviews I used more broth and salsa and increased the seasonings accordingly.  I added sweet frozen corn and served over brown rice.  Very good!

This dish is healthy, and the chicken came out very tender. However, we just didn't care for the taste. I really wanted to like it because I am looking for good slow cooker meals. We like everything in it so I am thinking it was the allspice, which would not be hard to change.

This recipe was good although both my husband and I thought it was a little bland. The only change I made was to use less garlic, since I don't like too much. So after we tasted it we added another cup of salsa, and that made it better. Still think it needed more flavor though...

This was very tasty. I didn't have hot salsa, only medium, and subbed parsley for cilantro. The combination of seasonings worked great but I was skeptical about adding the sweet potatoes at the beginning of the cooking time and I'm glad I trusted my instincts and added them during the last hour. To me they would have been overcooked otherwise. We eat a lot of chicken and this is definitely on the "make that again" list. Thanks UpstateNY.

This is great.  I skipped the cilantro, used two cups chicken broth, and served over couscous.  I made it on the stove top in a dutch oven.  I only cooked it for a couple hours and it came out VERY tender.  It's a keeper.

Tasty & unique. I would recommend chopping the yams pretty small, it tastes better when you can get a little bet of everything in one bite. For the same reason, I recommend maybe shredding the chicken before serving as well.

We are always open to trying new dishes, but this one is different, that's all I can say.... it's just different.  A perfect example would be trying a new dish at a favorite restaurant when you always get the same thing and then wondered why you just didn't order your  regular after you tasted the new one.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Thanks for the submission UpstateNY Cooker.

I made this the other night for dinner. I followed to suggestion to use a bit more salsa and chicken broth so it wouldn't dry out. Cooked on high for about 3 hours and another hour on low. When I stirred it the chicken simply shredded and the chunks of sweet potatoes disappeared (which was a good thing). I served it over steamed rice. The GF and and I ate it. It was good. Last night I used it as taco filling in crunchy taco shells with shredded lettuce and cheese and tomatoes. Those were a big hit. Even the extremely picky 11 years old liked them. Neither of them knew about the sweet potatoes. Well hidden, I guess. Tonight I'm going to use it for enchilada filling. So much leftovers from just one recipe.

UPDATE: So I made the enchiladas.  I used the sauce recipe from The Pioneer Woman's 'Enchiladas' recipe.  (She has several enchilada recipes.  I used the one simply name 'Enchiladas'.)  The change I made to her recipe was to use a 19oz can of red enchilada sauce and a 10oz can of green enchilada sauce (instead of using a 28oz can of only one kind).  I dipped the fried corn tortillas in the sauce.  Put a bit the the mixture from this recipe in the tortillas with a little cheese.  Filled to baking dishes.  Topped with more cheese and the remainder of the sauce.  Baked at 350F for 30 minutes.  We can't stop talking about how good they are.

My 4 yr old said this was seriously delicious!  The pickiest eater of the 5.  Use whatever beans you like, substitute as it fits your taste, and this will be delicious regardless.  Just don't forget to salt/season your chicken BEFORE you place it in the bottom of the crockpot!!  Keep the seasonings and the chicken stock.  Everything else can be substituted for something else and will still taste great.  I didnt use fresh cilantro, used navy beans, no peppers and mild salsa.  I didn't pan fry it first either (no need)...If I need a crockpot meal, then I definitely don't have time for that.  Try this recipe!

A delicious way to prepare chicken, and so easy!  I opted for a cut-up chicken using all parts, removing the skin.  I saw no need to brown the skinless chicken, and took other suggestions of replacing one can of the black beans with corn, which was the only other alteration I made.  Served on a bed of yellow Spanish rice, this received raves from Hubs.  The chicken was succulent and tender.  The bonus with this recipe is you put it all in the slow cooker and forget about it!  Will definitely be making again.

Very good and perfect for these fall days.  I ddin't brown the chicken first just placed in pot, salt and pepper and then the 1/4 c of cilantro and proceeded as per recipe with 2 changes:  subbed i can corn for 1 can of black beans and doubled the sauce.  I cooked on low for 7 hours.  It cam out a bit like a stew with the extra liquid bit that was fine to serve with rice.  The medium salsa still gave it a nice kick.  One comment, though, after the 7 hours the sweet potatoes were just done.  If you were cooking less time they would really need to be cut very small.  Delicious and healthy.  Adding for my notes: Used a can of chicken broth, 16 oz medium salsa, a 10 oz can of tomatoes with green chilies, 6 cloves of garlic, lots of cilantro (A whole bunch), 5 teaspoons of cumin, a heaping tsp of allspice and a packet of chicken bouillon in the sauce-yummy.  Going to try adding chile powder next time.

I thought this dish was very good. I used all the ingredients and added spinach in case I could get my 20 month old to eat it too. She did! I also didn't brown the meat first because It has never made a difference in the past. Lastly, I used more broth because I wanted the liquid to be at a certain point for my liking.

Warning...this is NOT a "latin" type dish that you go get at the nearest El Tipico restaurant. It doesn't taste like your everyday Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican etc food in which I feel like many people who didn't like the dish expected. It's a dish where you can taste the individual flavors of the ingredients.

Added: corn, dice tomatoes, green bell pepper, fresh cilantro and onion as garnish

It's not often that sweet potatoes find their way into my kitchen, but this recipe was too simple and too highly rated to pass up. Instead of chicken thigh, we used chicken breast and skipped the browning process. After 3.5 hours on high the potato was soft enough and the chicken was fully cooked (but not dry). 

Next time I'll try to reduce the sodium content by nixing the salsa for more diced tomatoes and jalapenos or chile peppers.

This recipe is delicious. We served it over rice with grated cheese. Just make sure to chop your sweet potatoes into smallish chunks, as the ones I left on the bigger side were still firmer than desired. I will definitely make this one again!

I LOVE this recipe!!  Tip 1:  The first step is really optional...as a time-saver, I will either just put the chicken in OR at the most I will pre-toss the chicken in a bowl with the salt/pepper/olive oil/cilantro -- but I don't pre-brown it.  Tip 2:  To make it healthier, I always make this with boneless skinless chicken breasts (vs. thighs) and it is still delicious.  The chicken shreds up a little bit and it's still extremely flavorful.

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was quite tasty. I didn't have fresh salso so I used a can of Rotel, added a can of corn, added a packet of Sazon, and doubled the chicken broth. I was skeptical about the sweet potatoes prior to making this dish but I now see that it is imperative to use them as they add a special twist to the meal. I will definitely make this again ;0)

This was very good.  I made a few changes, but not anything too serious.  I used 1 lb chicken breast that I did not brown, so the oil was omitted.  I think the browned thighs would taste awesome, but I didn't need the calories.  I only used 1 sweet potato and 1 can of beans so that there would be more liquid in the pot (other reviews indicated everything got dried out).  Lastly I used medium salsa instead of hot.  I served with sharp cheddar sprinkled on top and it was great.  We tried putting some in hard taco shells and that added awesome crunch and flavor.  Next time I would just dip tortilla chips in like we do with chili to make it easier.

Didn't have cilantro and didn't feel like slicing up a pepper, so we did without. I'm not sure if it were the lack of cilantro, but this was pretty bland. Next time, I'm going to add taco or burrito seasoning. I enjoyed the texture of the sweet potatoes, though. Put in the crock pot for 6 hours on low.

Made this for dinner on a very busy night and was pleasantly surprised!  Delicious!  The meat just fell off the bones.  Hubby loved it to.  Will be making this again soon.

Yum! A definite keeper. I did as others suggested by doubling the broth and the salsa and halving the black beans. I used half hot salsa and half medium and the spiciness was fantastic. We just ate this as a stew... what a good meal!!!

I didn't have bell peppers or cilantro, but was still very tasty :)  I also used reg. potatoes since we're not much of a sweet potato family.  This one is a keeper....Thanks for sharing your recipe :)

I didn't brown the chicken first (didnt really see the point).  I kept all the ingredients as is except for used only 1 can of black beans (thats all I had)  I made rice on the side and put everything on top.  The presentations isn't very pretty, but it tasted pretty good.

This was fantastic! I used medium salsa instead of hot (as I don't like too much spice). I also added the corn as others did. My husband told me to add this to the rotation for sure.

I didn't have allspice so didn't add it and it turned out delicious.  I also didn't brown the chicken first and cooked on low for about 8-9 hours.  The whole family loved it.

This recipe turned out really great...only gave it 4 stars because I modified per the other reviews.  I used about 1.5 cups of chicken stock and a little more than a cup of salsa.  I would definitely make this again!

I used one can of black beans and 1 can of corn.  I also used 1 sweet potato and several yellow potatoes.  I did not have enough salsa, so I used 1 can of Rotel and 1/3 cup salsa.

It was excellent!!!

I used frozen chicken tenderloins since they were on sale BOGO and added corn as some other reviewers suggested. I also added a 1/2 cup extra of broth as others were commenting on not enough liquid. I ended up with too much...maybe because I put the chicken in frozen? If I make this again I will not add extra. I will wait until the closer to the end to add the cilantro or at least part of it so it is not so soggy and has a bit more intense flavor. I put this in the slow cooker for about 4 hours on high. All in all it tasted good and looked great...wasn't a family favorite though.

Great slow-cooker recipe! At first I was nervous about the sweet potatoes because they are not a favorite of my husbands but he loved this recipe. I doubled the sauce and added 1/4 cup of yellow onions.  It was delicious and even better the next day as leftovers.

Perfect combo and you would never have guessed it. I used a can of cubed tomato instead of hot salsa since I didn't have any and it was still so great.

This was an awesome receipe!!! I changed a few things though, Instead of salt & pepper on the chicken I used Adobo and sprinkled chopped cilantro when frying chicken. I also added poblano peppers instead of the red bell pepper, and used regular potatoes and served it over a tostado shell with a dollop of sour cream.

I cooked this few days ago and it was delicious! I read reviews and amended a little bit as I noticed in one of the reviews: instead of 2 cans of beans I used 1 can of beans and 1 can of corn. I also kind of sautered chicken a little longe as I didn't have 4 hours to cook.:) So, I cooked in 2 hours 15 minutes on HIGH. It was very yummy! Thank you very much. I forwarded this recipe to my friends and will be keeping in my cookbook.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I had medium salsa so I opted to add some jalepenos for that extra kick. Used 2 cups salsa, only had half the amount of cumin, and upped the chicken broth so it was a bit soupy; still had a great taste though. I spooned this on top of brown rice and served. My daughter, who's not a fan of beans, cleaned her plate; beans and all.

This was surprisingly bland.  It smelled terrific, but in the end the flavor just wasn't there.  I added the corn, and shredded the chicken in the end.  If I make it again, I'd add the cilantro right before serving, and add something to spice it up--jalepenos?  Chili powder?  Oregano?  I don't know, but it really needs something.

Very good! After reading reviews, I kind of eyeballed everything and it turned into delicious chili! Pro tip: Taste your salsa BEFORE dumping in the entire jar. Mine turned light your mouth on fire spicy! Next time I'll add more sweet potatoes and corn... and go with a less spicy salsa. This is a very good base recipe with tons of room for creativity!

This is a fantastic recipe, and a great tasty gluten free and healthy option as well. Great on a crispy corn tostado or taco shell, with a bit of rice, avocado and good salsa (I like Herdez brand). I like to put a can of sweet corn and black beans in it. I've made this twice now; it makes a lot, which is great for freezing in small batches and taking out when you don't want to do a lot of work for dinner.

This is a great dish and a forgiving recipe! I have made this 3-4 times. Today, I switched it up a bit to save a trip to the grocery store, and it was still wonderful. I used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes, beef broth instead of chicken, green pepper instead of red and threw in 1-2 tbsp of dried parsley instead of fresh cilantro. One last change was to put on some jerk chicken rub prior to browning the chicken (similar flavor family as Latin). In general, I think the recipe could use more salt. We served it with tortillas, and this mom and the men were happy.

My husband loved it! Can't wait to make it again. Even though next time I will probably add more chicken broth. Overall, this recipe is delicious!

Used 1 1/2 pounds of thighs (each thigh cut roughly into thirds), 1 1/2 cups of broth and left the top off the crock pot the last 30 minutes to thicken the sauce.  The result was a delicious, beautiful stew that provided 5 very generous servings.

I really like this dish. I double the seasoning and liquid. I also added salt and onion. The salsa I used was spicy so that was great to the dish. You have to add lime/lemon to the dish bc at first I also thought that this dish wasn't that awesome but once I added the lime everything just came together and it was great. I will be making the dish again and again.

We really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes:

1.  Substituted breasts for thighs because we don't liked dark meat.
2.  Didn't brown the chicken first.
3.  Skipped cilantro.
4.  Added slightly more salsa and broth (1 1/2 cups of salsa and 3/4 cups of broth).
5.  Cooked on low for 6 hours and added the peppers and beans at the last hour.  

It was very good!

This was great, and so easy.  My husband thinks he doesn't like sweet potatoes, but ate them happily here; the cilantro adds a nice freshness.  We ate over rice one night and leftover in tacos for several days' worth of lunches.

Yum, this was so tasty! I was too lazy to brown the thighs beforehand so I just threw them in frozen and cooked for 5 hours on low to make sure they were cooked enough.  They ended up tender and easily shredable, although the sweet potatoes were completely mush.  I don't think the cilantro should go in at the beginning, it wilts and loses all flavor.  I would sprinkle it on at the end.  Also I had 1.5 pounds of chicken and that was plenty, I don't think 3 pounds would have fit in my slow cooker with all the other ingredients.  Next time I'll use fresh chicken so I can cut the time to 4 hours and see if the sweet potatoes hold up better then.

This makes the house smell really good. I used skinless chicken breast, & just placed in slow cooker instead of browning. They cook just fine & you can eliminate having a dirty fry pan. I served with warm tortillas, but may try serving over rice also.

Great recipe for a busy day!  I did not brown the chicken before placing it in the crockpot, just added the ingredients and let it cook while I was at work.  It was in there for about 9 hours so I added more liquid than the original recipe called for.  Very versatile recipe, we had it as tacos.  But with a little more liquid it would have been great as a soup.

This isn't very pretty but it tastes really good. After four hours the chicken pretty much shredded itself when I stirred all the ingredients together.

Good blend of flavors but I think next time I would leave out the sweet potatoes and then use this as filling in tortillas. ;-) mmmmm!

So super yummy. I used 2 cups of chicken broth and subbed one of the cans of beans for corn. It was so delicious I think my husband had 3 servings. Even with the hot salsa it wasn't spicy at all, just wonderfully flavorful. Made the house smell delicious too!

This is my new favorite way to eat sweet potatoes!  I love all the unique flavors combined together.  I ended up having to cook (in the crock pot) for 10 hrs. due to my work schedule, but with 1 can chicken broth, 16 oz. salsa, 1 can black beans and 1 can mexican corn, the chicken and potatoes were still perfectly tender.

This was a delicious dish - and definitely not ordinary! Ijust put frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker and added the rest of the ingredients. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Healthy and tasty.

We loved this easy recipe! The fresh cilantro and our friend's homemade salsa gave it a wonderful flavor. Only tip is to add the beans and red pepper towards the end of the cooking time to keep them a little more crisp.

Would make it again. I had to use bone in chick thighs, but it still turned out very good. I used medium salsa for fear that hot salsa would be too spicy for me, but I would use hot salsa next time. By the time it was done, the medium salsa seemed mild.

Great recipe! I took the suggestions in the reviews and doubled the sauce. I also substituted the sweet potatoes for various small potatoes (i.e purple potatoes, Yukon gold, etc) I also added some cayenne pepper.  super yummy and a great midweek meal.

Lovely flavors, and so healthy!! Admit some changes, but none that really changed the essence of the dish. I used pork tenderloin, 2#, cut in 1-1.5 inch chunks, browned in EVOO. Next, I used 2 tsp of ground coriander instead of allspice. Also, I chopped the cilantro stems into 1/4" pieces and added them rather than adding the cilantro leaves while browning the meat.....this adds the flavor better (and you don't waste the stems). And lastly, I used a tagine rather than a slow cooker, and cooked it just until the meat was done and the sweet potatoes were softened, about 20 minutes. We served it over steamed brown rice, with a really hot salsa to add as desired. YUM!!! Rave reviews from guests, and because it made so much, they took leftovers home.

What a flavorful recipe!  We followed other cooks' suggestion and doubled the spices.  I also added a whole bunch of chopped cilantro as we love the flavor.  We had 4 pounds of chicken so I used a whole can (2 cups) of chicken broth.  We also used two cups of my husband's homemade salsa.  I browned the chicken, then put it in the slow cooker for about 6 hours.  We did not serve it the same day.  The next day we put the whole casserole (cold) into a cold oven, then set the oven for 3 hours and left the chicken in the oven for about 2 hours.  We did not eat it over rice, but in a pasta bowl as a stew.  It was very yummy and a definite keeper!!

Very easy to prepare and perfect for company when you don't have time to cook.  I added the corn as another reader suggested and it added great color.  I doubled the liquid but not the salsa.  But make sure the salsa is HOT or it won't have enough bite.

I was scared to make this for my picky bf, but was craving sweet potatoes.  I served it over saffron rice which was incredible with it.  Do not over cook though otherwise the potatoes become too mushy. BTW, he loved it too.

This is an excellent recipe that even my picky 3 year old enjoyed (we used mild salsa to cater to his tastes). I have made this many times now, both for my family and guests, and there are never any left overs. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I really liked this and so did my hubby! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used two breasts (roughly one pound), frozen mixed pepper strips, flat leaf parsley instead of cilantro, and medium salsa. Other than that, the only other change I made to the recipe was I followed the suggestion of others and added a layer of corn on top of the black beans. I think it was a nice addition. When I make this again, I will probably add more veggies (celery, carrots, onion), but I like to make a recipe as close to "as written" the first time as possible. Thank you for sharing!

Just ok.  My husband liked it better than I did.  I added corn and twice the liquids as reviewers suggested and I would do that again if I were to make it again- which I won't.  It just wasn't quite right.

The sweet potatoes add great flavor to this already great recipe.  It's a combination that is hard to beat.  I would agree with the recommendation of doubling up on the wet to add to the chicken, sweet potatoes, red bells and black beans.  We're not the biggest chicken fans, but this recipe totally convinced us that there are good solutions out there for pollo.  YUM!!!

The recipe sounds great as written, but sometimes you've gotta go with what you have (and who you're serving). I doubled the broth, even though I only had 1 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs (skinless, with bone). I used green tomatillo salsa, added a chipotle pepper and a couple teaspoons of adobo sauce to add some heat. And I had a poblano pepper, so I threw that in as well. This will permanently go into our dinner rotation! Thank you so much!

I loved this recipe!  I accidently opened a can of refried black beans instead of black beans.  Oops.  I decided to use those and it turned out great.  I added a little extra liquid, but the beans made almost a thick sauce.  I will make this again.

This was super tasty! I didn't have any sweet potatoes so just left them out.  On day 1, I served it over yellow rice. On day 2, the juice was a bit thicker so I served it as filling for soft tortillas w/ cheddar cheese.  Will definitely make again.

this was delicious!  I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, and didn't brown it, I just put it in the slowcooker raw(lowers the fat, as no oil was used)I doubled the liquid and the spices,  but I left out the allspice. cooked it on low for 7 hours and it was perfect! will definitely be making this one again!!

I thought this recipe was great.  These are the changes I made.....1.5 pounds of chicken breast instead of 3 pounds chicken thighs,  a couple handfuls of frozen mixed bell peppers instead of the red bell pepper, 1 can of beans instead of 2, 1 sweet potato instead of 2, no allspice as I didn't have any.  I basically halved the recipe except for the liquid ingredients so it may have been saucier than by following the recipe exactly.  I accidentally cooked it on high for 3 hours but the chicken was able to be easly shredded a little at that point.  I switched it to low for another hour.  The sweet potatoes were very soft.  Overall, I enjoyed the flavor (especially from the cilantro) and will make again.  Not too hard.

The chicken was so tender and tastey.  I am going to start buying chicken thighs more often!  I also loved the salsa, bean and potato mixture.  I didn't have salsa on hand and used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I also sub. the sweet potatoes for white potatoes as I am not a big fan of the sweet potato.  I also omitted the allspice as I didn't have any on hand.  This was a very easy, convenient, and tastey recipe.

I thought this was awesome!!!!  My little one did not want to try it.  My husband liked it and said it was good.  I served it as a stew without the rice.  I used a mild salsa and it was not hot at all.  I liked the flavor that the sweet potato brought to the dish.  I used one can of corn and one can of black beans. I also increased the chicken broth to 1 cup and used a 15 oz jar of salsa. The thickness of the stew was just right.  I think I might serve it with corn bread next time and spice it up some.

This meal is fabulous! I did use 1 can of corn n place of the 2nd can of black beans. The whole family loved it! I served it over brown rice and for the kids, I added shredded cheddar to the top! I will definitely make this meal again! : )

I was looking to make soup with ingredients I had in the cupboard, used this for inspiration. (Did not slow cook.) The changes I made: used chicken breast, no red bell pepper, no cilantro, no allspice, included liquid from black beans. Added celery, carrots, frozen corn kernals, and 3 cups of chicken broth. I had an 8oz can of "El Pato" Jalapeno Salsa, it was perfect. Garnished with Frank's Red Hot Sauce. So delicious! Thank you for a wonderful base.

This was good. I used a mild salsa so my kids would eat it. It was good but I def. think the hot salsa is a must for more flavor. Will try making again with hot salsa and maybe onions to give more flavor!

This was a really good recipe. I am actually making it for the 2nd time right now. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. I also added some chopped onion because onion is good with every dish. I used mild salsa and added a little bit of red pepper flakes to kick it up a little. I love all the flavors of this. I am also a huge sweet potato fan.

Yum. I followed the recipe except I didn't brown the chicken, but did salt and pepper the pieces before putting in slow cooker. I also cut the sweet potatoes in about 2 inch pieces so they wouldn't become too soft. Chicken came out very tender and dish had great flavor. Excellent recipe. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

this is not a latin chicken but a  indian recipe that stinks a mile away. Don't confuse people.Those people who thinks it is a great dish is because either they are Americans or English with the only knowledge that they like curry but don't know the difference between different cuisine.

This was spectacular! At first I was unsure of putting sweet potatoes in this type of dish but they made it delicious. As others suggested, I increased the broth and salsa and used medium rather than hot. It was the perfect temp. We had company over and I put out both brown rice and tortillas and guests could eat it anyway the wanted. I liked this so much I posted it on Facebook and  I've never done that before.

I, along with others, increased the liquids not only because I used a tad more chicken, but because I knew it would not be enough. I used bone-in thighs and drumsticks. This is the easiest recipe. Took a little longer to prep because I am SLOW! Lol...But, EVERYTHING was cooked in my crock pot on high at approximately 2 1/2 hrs. My sweet potatoes came out perfectly al dente, like I like. When making it again, I will add my bell peppers (I used both green and red because I had them) after the first hour because they came out a little too soft for my taste. The cumin and allspice add a nice touch as does the salsa, but I would love more hotness! Next time I will definitely add in some hot peppers!

This was fabulous! It's still on warm in the crock pot right now as I plan on having some more in a little while. I read many reviews and headed to recommendations of adding more salsa (I used Trader Joe's Roasted Yellow chili salsa). I love cilantro so I put more leaves/stems in, bone-in thighs w/out the skin (don't use boneless breasts because I put one in there to see what would happen it wasn't nearly as good or juicy/tender as the bone-in thighs. It also didn't taste as good). I used 1 1/2 cans of black beans and 1 cup of white sweet frozen corn. BEST RECIPE IN A SLOW COOKER EVER. 4 hours on high. I suggest cutting the yams/sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch chunks and put closer to bottom of pot since those always take the longest to cook. Thanks for the recipe!

Of COURSE I made adjustments. This recipe is excellent as written, however, I live in the southwest, so I used ingredients native to this area -  I added to the slow cooker: fresh raw corn cut off the cob; reduced the black beans to 1 can;  used the cilantro stalks and blended in the BULLET with jar minced garlic and 1/4c broth and then added to the crock;I added [in addition to jar salsa] a packet of dry taco seasoning; 14oz can of diced tomatoes; shredded my 1 sweet potato so it thickened the broth as it cooked.  Added 2 fresh roasted Hatch NM Green chili from the  guy roasting it in the parking lot at the grocery store [sans the seeds and membranes]. I added green and red peppers, I chopped 1 green zucchini [it adds to the liquid base]; 1 small fresh onions sliced & a bunch of green onions to the slow cooker.  Allspice is not southwestern, but a little more Indian flavor, so I left it out.  I did NOT precook the chicken on the stove.
I served it in a bowl ladled over with homemade Jiffy corn bread with green chili added to the batter.  The next day I used it in a warmed flour tortilla with chopped cilantro leaves, red onions, shredded Colby jack cheese and avocado slices and sour cream.  To Die Live For!

Very good and the whole family loved it -- super healthy recipe!!!  Sight Modifications to recipe - used 4.5 bone-in chicken thighs; used 1 cup chicken broth; 1 can corn; 1 can black bean; 1.5 c salsa.  Used about 1/2 cup very loosely packed cilantro.  Cooked all in crock pot and did not do any pre-cooking to chicken.  Made the house smell delicious too!!  Served over brown rice.  Fed 5.  Froze the remaining so can get two meals out of this!

I have made this once before and will be again tomorrow for visiting relatives. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and seasoned the breast with a Jamaican jerk rub  that had similar flavor notes as the other spices in the recipe. This added another level of flavor without competing with the other spices. The chicken breast were very tender. It is an excellent on pot meal. I chose not serve with rice as it already contains a starch, sweet potatoes. I will be serving it this time with fried plantains this time.

Very, very good.  I made a couple of changes based on other recommendations.   I didn't brown the chicken first.   I used chicken breasts since that is what I had on hand.   I used 1 cup of chicken broth, doubled the cumin and all spice, added a can of drained corn, and a couple of bay leaves.   Though I really liked this dish, I believe I will add extra salsa (1.5 cups)  and chicken broth (2 cups) next time.  I also had to work the day I cooked it, so I ended up cooking it on low in the slow cooker for a little over 7 hours.  Cooked perfectly.  I shredded the chicken and then served it over rice.

This was very good! A little too hot for me, but still delicious.  Next time I will use a mld salsa. I really did not need rice with the dish.

I made this last night for the first time and it was AMAZING! It is so different from anything I have ever had before.  I was a little unsure how I would like the sweet potatoes in it, but found out that it is the sweet potatoes that really make the dish really good.  The only modifications I made, was I added a little Chili Powder (we like spicy foods)and a can of corn (drained).  Our youngest child was not a huge fan, but the rest of us were.  I will definitely make this again, and just make something different for my youngest child.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!! :)

This was excellent.  I agree that with corn chips or tacos, the contrasting texture would be excellent.  Also, if you go with mild salsa, don't skip the fresh cilantro and lime, these make the dish.  If you make it mild for the kiddos, consider passing spicier salsa or hot sauce at the table.  I made it with 1 large jar store brand mild salsa (2 cups) and extra chicken broth, per suggestions.  I cooked on top of stove because I ran out of time and it was great.  I also skipped red pepper because we don't like it much.  If you wanted vegan, just skip the chicken and stick with both cans of black beans.  GREAT dish, I plan to bring to large family event in the near future.

This is a great slow cooker recipe. My favorite part is all the colors...so many crock pot recipes come out looking all the same color :) 4 hours was perfect for juicy delicious chicken, and not-mushy veggies. My only change was to leave out the cilantro (this is strictly due to my extreme frugality...) in the summer when I can snip some off my plant, I will be gobbing it on! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe, UpsateNYCooker! Update: I froze half of this recipe, and we thawed it out and had it for supper, it was great!

My family loved this recipe, however I did make a few changes when I made it. I didn't care for the idea of rice and sweet potatoes, so I omitted the rice. I made it into more of a soup instead just by added more broth and some water. With it being a slow cooker meal, and the point of it being so being that I can put it all in and let it cook itself, the next time ill omit the stovetop cooking portion. I suggest just seasoning the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and throwing them in the cooker. Before serving just take the chicken out and cut it off the bone. I did that and the chicken just slide right off if I remember correctly.

My family generally loves spicy food, but for some reason everybody said this was a bit too spicy. So instead ill try medium salsa or a mixture of medium and mild. Mmm can't wait to make this dish again.

I never wanted to be one of those people who review a recipe by listing all the changes they made to it but...I didn't have any cilantro. Or cumin. And this recipe was still FANTASTIC! I have never made something so tasty from my crockpot. I don't know how anyone could say this was bland unless they have a medical condition they don't know about involving their tastebuds or they used very bad ingredients. 

I read a lot of the reviews and decided to take the suggestion of adding a can of corn instead of two beans, adding 1/2 c more broth, and a bay leaf. Other than that, as directed except for the cilantro and cumin issues I mentioned. I used Tajin instead of the cumin. I cooked 3 hours on high and the chicken was tender and falling apart. Served with a dollop of sour cream. My new comfort food. WE LOVED THIS RECIPE, THANK YOU! And thanks to all for the suggestions.

Mine turned out OK but it was bland. The only thing I did differently was substitute the hot salsa with medium salsa (since I don't like it very hot). I also made this in a 4 quart slow cooker and the ingredients barely fit. I may try and make this again by halfing the recipe to see if it turns out better.

A hit with the entire family.  I did omit the red pepper since I'm the only one of us who likes it, but other than that followed the recipe.  Made with white rice, and also had creamed corn and chips and salsa on the side.  Will definitely be making again!

Our new favorite! I made a few revisions, doubling the salsa and chicken broth, as well as cutting the cumin called for in half and adding ground cinnamon in the same measurement as allspice. I didn't have any cilantro on hand, did add diced mangoes instead.

In a word, AWESOME! I used medium salsa and red beans. I also doubled the amount of salsa and used 4 chicken leg quarters, red beans instead of black,  additional chicken broth and cooked it several hours longer than the 4 listed. I also left the skin on the chicken which I prefer. Next time I may reduce the broth because there was a lot of liquid left over but it was amazing! So good! ;-)

I really liked this dish but my family wasn't as thrilled.  Partly because I cooked it for 6 hours on low and it turned out quite mushy.  I was a little nervous about doing 4 hrs on low b/c my slow cooker says to cook things on low for 8-10 hrs.  So, I went with 6 and it was too long.  Only thing I did different was use one can of corn in place of one of the cans of black beans.  My salsa was mild too.  I used boneless skinless thighs (which were a little more difficult to find in the store) but it was really good verses using chicken breast.  Next time I would dice the red pepper instead of slice it.  I was also a little generous on my broth and salsa measuring to be sure it didn't dry out.

This was fantastic. I used ~2 lbs of frozen chicken thighs, placed directly in the slow cooker (no thawing/browning) and followed other reviewers' suggestions to double the seasonings and broth. Also tossed in some frozen corn. It turned out hearty, thick, and delicious. I've served this with rice, pasta, and cornbread -- all great. The sweet potatoes really make the dish.

Nice combination of flavors. I never liked sweet potatoes until I tried them with these flavors - delicious! Sprinkle with additional cilantro and fresh lime juice once it is served.

I really loved the flavor of this chicken.  The ingredients sounded like they might not complement each other, but actually it was really really good.  I enjoyed it over rice, and was able to freeze half for later.  Thanks for sharing.

I used medium salsa and I should have followed the instructions and used hot salsa.  To make up for the lack of spice, I added some chili powder.  It turned out great!  Goes well with brown rice. Next time I think we will try adding some corn.  I also browned the chicken and then slow cooked it on the stove because I only had 2 hours until dinner time.  We will be adding this to our regular rotation.

So easy! We have been making this a lot lately. I don't brown the chicken first, it saves tons of time for someone like me :)

I add chili powder, garlic powder,and also add frozen corn at the end. I have used it to make tacos, eaten it over rice, and made "enchilada lasagna" with it. It has been added to our staple list of go-to crock pot dishes.

lOVE this.  ok we used trader joe cowboy bean and corn salsa and it was HOT!  Bobby wanted it milder:)  I think recipe is good or bad depending on salsa - so I must experiment to find the right salsa for this.   This is one chicken dinner I actually LOVE!  MUST cook with rice!  I love Bobby:)

Interesting and very tasty. Layered dry black lentils on top of chicken and they cooked perfectly! Used pumpkin pie spice and cumin cuz that's what I had. Doubled the broth and salsa. Hand shredded chicken once cooked, did not brown first, used a 3lb pack mixed bone in. Came out as a delicious stoup I will make again and again!  (Skipped the rice, hearty as is!)

I don't know if I prepared it incorrectly, or if I just didn't get the dish.  I didn't like the taste of it at all.  I think it's the all-spice that just ruined it for me.

I used two pounds of boneless chicken thighs and skipped the browning stage.  I added a little more salsa and broth.  I increased the cumin, garlic and allspice by 1/2 again.  I shredded the chicken before serving all of it on rice.  Very good. for a cold winter's night!

This is one of my favorite recipes. When I first glanced at the ingredients I wasn't too sure about it but the combination of flavors is surprisingly awesome. I frequently substitute frozen sweet corn for one of the cans of beans. As far as the salsa goes what ever is open in the frig works, it doesn't have to be the hot. Occasionally I use dry cilanto if fresh isn't available. It is one of those recipes that is versatile and always turns out great!

This is hands down my favorite crock pot dinner! I recommend doubling the sauce like others commented, however, I didn't double the cumin or allspice and it was perfect.  Also, like others, I used one can of black black and then cut fresh corn off one cob. FANTASTIC!

This has instantly become one of our favorites.  I omit the red/green peppers for my wife.  I also ease up on the cilantro.  I don't use it while browning the chicken.

I used chicken legs (what I had),can of white beans (also what I had), some corn I froze, actually put lime juice in, made salsa (Fresh Salsa on here, added garlic), added half a hot pepper. After it was cooking 6 hours I took the chicken off the bone and tasted the sauce and it seemed it was missing 
something. I then added poultry seasoning, cinnamo,n salt and pepper. Tasted it again and it was spot on! Served over rice cooked in chicken stock.

Wow! This was deliciously exotic! I accidentally added ground cloves instead of cumin and it was still fantastic. I am definitely making this again. Next time I'll make it as directed with cumin! We served it over rice and added more liquid than was called for, but we like it soupy.

This recipe is delicious! I used bone-in chicken thighs, used 1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 russet (since my husband doesn't like sweet potatoes), and served over the "Quinoa and Black Beans" recipe on Allrecipes.com. Just enough heat to make it tasty, but still delicious. I've made this a couple times already and will be making again in the future. Thank you for sharing!

This was such a great change in the normal routine of meals. Everyoe liked it and will fix again and again.  In fact, i have been asked to fix it again. I used mild salsa which was plenty tasteful to me.

I make this recipe so much I know it by heart.  I make the following changes....I only use I can of beans, use mild salsa or sometimes even peach, lots of extra sweet potatoes and I add canned crushed tomatoes.  With the addition of the tomatoes, I don't usually need the chicken broth.  The sauce in the end is so rich and wonderful!

This was EXCELLENT!!! Even my picky boyfriend loved it. I also added a little extra liquid since I know my slow cooker runs a little on the hot side. I didn't have any cilantro so I improvised a little with "poultry seasoning" and some coriander. I also had baby red, orange, and yellow peppers which I used (sometimes it's just gotta be what's on hand! ... lol). Absolutely wonderful. I'll definitely make this again. Next time I'll make sure to have cilantro on hand ahead of time. Superb!!! ... Rie

Awesome filling for tacos and enchiladas.  Sweet potato adds a hint of sweetness which compliments the spices.

Wow, this was good! My boyfriend was a bit skeptical, but I knew we'd both love it. The only part I skipped was adding the cilantro since it tastes like soap to him... wish I hadn't waited so long to give this a shot! Also used chopped bell pepper instead of strips. I loved the addition of sweet potatoes... perfect!

Insanely good. I work during the day, so a crockpot dish that needs to cook for 4 hours is not an option for me. Instead, I used a Dutch oven on the stove and let everything simmer, covered, for about 2 hours. I used 2 lbs of boneless/skinless thighs and three sweet potatoes. Everything else was by the recipe. I can't believe how delicious this is! Definitely going into the rotation.

Perfect as written but also easy to customize! You can control the spiciness by the salsa you use, mild to extra hot. Remove the chicken skin for a lower fat option. Sneak some corn, carrots, or other veggies into the pot, your family won't notice! Add more chicken broth (it can be a bit dry), especially if you choose to bake it rather than using a slow cooker. I've also made is using a whole cut-up chicken rather than thighs and it turned out just as good! Boneless/skinless breasts might be a little lean for this (and easy to over cook), but I bet it would still be tasty! Has anyone tried it with turkey?

I thought the recipe had potential but I added a few things that made it even better. First of all, I added some bottled "mojo criollo" right after I browned the chicken. I increased the amount of cilantro to the recipe (love cilantro) and added 1 can of corn to the recipe. I made my own salsa (1 can of tomatoes, onion, cilantro, red pepper and jalapeno peppers). 

I served it as a a soup (or what the Colombians call "sudado") with a side of rice and some cut avocado pieces. 

It was delicious.

Good flavour, but a little bland. Needs hot salsa and a fair amount of salt and spice to perk it.

This is an inexpensive meal that uses ingredients you probably already have on hand. Neither myself nor my husband were blown away by it, but it was a nice, hot, satisfying meal.

I should start by saying I hate chicken thighs but decided to try this recipe anyway because of the other ingredients.  I am soo glad I did! This was one of the BEST dishes I have ever made! The thighs were wonderful and tender.  I added more liquid than the recipe called for and placed it over white rice.  The next day it was even better.  I mixed the rice with the leftover chicken and made burritos out of it.  Sooo yummy! Huge hit for my family!!!!!

Just had this tonight.  I was expecting more since it got such great reviews.  It was an okay dinner.  I don't know if I'll be making this again with all the time it took with the list of ingredients, browning the chicken, and then of course waiting for it all to cook.  I used 4 thighs and 2 breasts cause that's what I had.  I at first added an extra 1/2 cup of broth cause that's what most reviews said to do.  Then I saw it didn't cover the pile so I added about another half cup.  And I omitted the potatoes cause my kids won't eat them.  Well it smelled nice while cooking but there was FAR too much liquid after.  I added cornstarch to thicken it, which helped.  But now I am left with way too much sauce, and I don't want to throw it out.  I think that leaving the recipe as is and not adding extra liquid would've been better.  But then again, the potatoes would've helped with absorbing some of it (I think) and that could've been my problem.  Also, it doesn't say if the can of beans should be drained or not.  So I didn't drain mine, and that could also be the problem.  All in all, great if you're looking for something to have ready for when you come home that's just "good enough".  But taste-wise, nothing special.  I added quite a bit of salt to liven it up.  I served it over brown rice.

I love this recipe! I found that I did not need to double the liquid as some other reviewers suggested - there was plenty of sauce. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs - so tender they just fell apart. I served it over yellow rice & it was so good. Also strained sauce & made soft tacos the next day - delicious!! A little sour cream and some lime juice to top them off. I did what several people suggested and used one can of corn with one can of beans - very tasty. Next time I will use 2 cans of beans per original recipe since we like black beans. I did cook a little differently - I cooked for 2hrs on hi then reduced to low for last 2hrs. Even my hubby said this was a keeper and he hates when I try new recipes!!

This was very simple and had a unique flavor.  It was slightly sweet and mildly spicy.  I double the amount of sauce, and was glad that I did.  Very budget friendly for the amount of food it makes!

We doubled the liquid & spices as previous reviewers had suggested and it was just enough.  I cooked for longer as well to make it stewier.  It had really good flavor and everyone enjoyed it.  It will make our regular rotation.

This was delicious!  I used a can of pinto and a can of kidney beans instead of the black beans since my family doesn't like black beans and it was a huge hit!  I also took the advice of another rater and added a little extra liquid.  SOOOO GOOD!!!

I cut the spices in half (I was leary to serve it to my kids full strength), but I thought it tasted bland as a result.  I think maybe I just don't really care for the cumin and allspice.  I do like the combination of the rest of the ingredients though, so I will make it again, maybe just with garlic powder, salt, pepper and Italian seasoning.

This was incredibly bland. I took note of some of the previous reviews and did not brown the chicken first, and I only used 7 thighs. I added extra broth and salsa and subbed a can of beans for some frozen corn. Very bland. I ended up adding more salsa on top and a dash of lime juice. Served over brown rice. I like the concept of this dish but it's lacking in execution.

I've made this twice in the span of a month, I really liked it.  I listened to some of the recommendations and here's my two cents. DO double the liquids. I recommend medium or mild salsa because hot overpowers the other flavors. Mild is a bit weak for me, but still good. Cook on high for just 4 hours. If you cook longer than that and it all has a similar mushy texture. Also, to save time, I just added fresh cilantro at the end and I think it added a stronger flavor and a touch of color.

I made this the first time for guests and it was really good even despite cooking it on HIGH for 6 hours instead of the specified 4 on LOW. The second time I cooked on LOW for 4 hours and the potatoes were not quite done. This time I made it on the stovetop, and simmered, covered for an hour or so. The chicken would likely have been a bit more tender in the crockpot, but other than that the taste was just as good. I like beans, so I add one more can, and I leave out the allspice (because I don't have it on hand). I serve it with rice as pictured. My husband likes saucy dishes, so I double the broth. The combined texture of creamy beans and sweet potatoes is so yummy! Definitely one of my very favorite dishes. Thanks for sharing!

I decided to double the spices and liquids based on reviews I read, as a result, the spices were too overpowering.  I added the sweet potatoes at the beginning and 1 can black beans and 1 can kidney beans.  Next time, I may increase the liquids, but certainly not the spices (cumin in particular).  Overall, I really enjoyed.  My husband would try again, but with less spice.

Delicious!! My three year old thought it was a bit too spicey...what does she know?! I used a 19oz can of black beans and a can of corn instead of 2 cans of beans, and that's the way I'll contiue to make it. Really tasty!

Excellent!  The only problem I had was that the sweet potatoes did NOT cook in 4 hours.  Next time, I'll either dice them or use an alternative cooking method.

Extremely easy recipe.  I followed the directions except I cooked this in a 9x13 pan, covered with foil, at 350 in the oven for 40 minutes. I did not have sweet potatoes and had Mild Salsa on hand and I loved the taste. I did increase the liquid just a little because I was afraid of it drying out. Served this over rice. Very tasty.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding extra chicken broth.  It was definitely not done in 4 hours, even after turning it from "low" to "high" mid-way through.  Had to boil it on the stove for a while to cook the sweet potatoes.  BUT, the end result was very good.  I will make this again, but with the crockpot on "high".

This tasted really good. I used breasts instead of thighs and I added a little more salsa and chicken broth because I wanted it to be a little soupier. The heat level was perfect, the sweetness of the potatos balanced out the spiciness of the salsa. Next time I think I will add a can of corn as other reviewers suggested.

YUMMY!  I used chicken breasts because I had bought a big pack I had to use up.  I didn't brown beforehand and it came out great, very tender.  I did what another viewer suggested and decreased the black beans and added a can of corn.  It freezes well too.  Thank you!

This was great!  I added a can of corn, an extra half cup of salsa, and a little extra broth, and used chicken breasts because we don't like thighs. We squeezed lots of lime juice on top right before serving.  My boyfriend and I were both a little unsure about the sweet potatoes, maybe they added to the flavor while cooking, but he didn't care for them.  We're from the south and are used to really sweet sweet potatoes, so that could just be us.  Overall, wonderful recipe, will make again!

Just finished eating this and Yum-O!!!  I never know what to do with thighs and this was great.  I did not have allspice and I used jarred roasted red peppers, because they were on hand.  It seemed fine with the changes.  The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 was that it seemed like it was missing some heat...I don't know what kind, but a little spice would have been good.  Try :)

Only changes I made were to use 1 can of black beans and one can of corn... and I cooked on low for 7 hours.  I thought this came out great, and will plan to serve it over brown rice next time as another reviewer suggested.  I usually don't "do" sweet potatoes, but they really fit this dish.  Thank you!

It was nice to see a recipe calling for thighs instead of breasts - and the meat was wonderful! I ended up using this as a topping for nachoes one day, burritos another and as a full entree as well. Thanks for the recipe!

So here is the thing.  This has some major possibilities.  I followed the directions to a t except I didn't have any red bell pepper.  I think you can skip the browning the chicken part- the skin gets yucky (slimy) when you put it in the slow cooker.  I thought it could have used A LOT more spice.  I did dig the combo of black beans, and yams (there were no sweet potatoes at the market the produce guy said only in the fall)  I served it over rice.  This made a big quantity of food.  I will probably make it again, but with some changes.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good and easy.  My boyfriend said it was the best crock-pottery I'd ever done!  I will definately do this again.  I followed another reviewer's recommendation and added frozen corn.  I also didn't have allspice, so I added a little pumpkin pie spice - it has allspice in it....  You could taste it, but it actually wasn't half bad!

very tasty. I reduce the amount of beans and used a medium heat salsa. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. The potatoes took longer to cook that the time stated, but that was okay. Just made the house smell good for a bit longer. I'll make this again, with the addition of some sliced zucchini during the last bit of cooking time

This recipe turned out amazing!  It will definately be a family favorite around here.  I did change 1 main ingredient, I happened to have some bone-in split chicken breasts.  So I used them instead of the thighs, just took the skin off before cooking them.  It still turned out amazing!!  Perfect over rice.

If you “don’t like chicken thighs,” you should try this dish! I basically never write reviews, but this was so tasty I felt compelled to review it! I also don’t typically use chicken thighs but I trusted the recipe and the chicken was soooo flavorful and tender! I made it exactly as listed. Based on other reviews, I cut the sweet potatoes in very large chunks (basically 2” rounds, keeping the skin intact around each piece) so they wouldn’t disintegrate. At the very end, I removed the sweet potatoes to a plate and added a small amount of dried potato flakes (my trick for thickening sauces) to the slow cooker and let the sauce thicken for about 10 more minutes. So delicious and easy; I’ll be making this again soon!

Excellent dish - I added two jalapeño peppers (minus most of the seeds) as we like spice. Love the black beans, cumin and cilantro in this dish.  It also reheats well (if you have any leftovers!).  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe thrills me. Looked through some reviews and did double up on the spices. Also went crazy with five sweet potatoes, a pound of frozen corn and 4 cups of chicken broth. When cooking was complete I drained the broth off for a superb broth. Picky  husband had two helpings. Woot Woot!

This turn out so good! I had a 5lb. bag of thighs, and trimmed and skinned them first. I used a can of white hominy in place of one of the cans of black beans, and I added 1 tsp. Crushed red pepper, I T. Chili powder, and 1 tsp. Mexican oregano, to the sauce mix, and it truly tastes like a traditional Mexican dish. I pulled all the veggies off into a bowl, boned the thighs and put the meat on a platter. Served with tostadas and rice! Olé!

Loved it with one significant change. Please correct the cooking directions! This is fantastic if you Slow Cook on HIGH for 4 hours or LOW for 8 hours.  As written here - LOW for 4 hours, the sweet potatoes are rock-hard and the chicken does not reach that tender, thoroughly spiced quality of real Latin Chicken.

We did change this up some, but even my elderly mom loves this recipe!  Just adjust the heat.  I added some chopped celery and onions, used chopped yellow pepper, black beans, 2 C salsa, 1 C broth, and doubled the spices with a little added chili powder and garlic n onion powder (not salt) to the liquid mix.  I always brown the chicken as I feel it adds a depth you don't get otherwise.  Sometimes I even sprinkle Chix with a little flour then brown.  Helps thicken sauce if you have to cook longer so more broth to keep moist.  We have used butternut squash rather than sweet potatoes and it's just as good!  If u have a time crunch, brown the chix more thoroughly, and put slow cooker on high for 1st 30 min to get everything hot, then turn down to low and it won't take 4 hrs, but still good.

This is a great meal to leave cooking all day and have your home smell fabulous when you walk in the door.  Not only does it make your home smell amazing, the food tastes great, too!  I doubled all of the liquids and spices.  I also added a bit more cumin and some season salt.  This is great as is and will make a great filling for burritos or tacos.

We loved this recipe. I did add ½ cup more chicken broth and used my homemade salsa. I also added some chipotle peppers. Next time I will probably add onions because we love them. I shredded the chicken and we ate with baked pitas. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful recipe!  I tweaked it as others said (1 cup chicken stock, 2 cups salsa, 1 can beans, 1 can corn).  This gave such good flavors.  I served over brown rice.   Even after I packed them for left overs to take to work, we still had extra of the stew-part, so I plan on adding a little extra stock and some brown rice and making a soup to take to work as well!

This recipe is a great addition to my slow cooker collection! I love the sauce, it's perfect. I did not cook the chicken beforehand and it had great flavor at the end (I cooked on LOW for 7 hours). What I found challenging was making sure the potatoes were cooked at the same rate to have the same texture-I had to stir often to make sure some chunks made it into the sauce as some cooked too much and others not enough. Overall it had a great flavor and I enjoyed the leftovers as well.

We really liked this - made as written except only 1 tsp of cumin and my black beans were 19oz cans - could have used more broth. I did brown the chicken and assembled everything into the crockpot the night before then put in the fridge - turned it on at noon the next day so it was ready for supper. After 4 1/2 hours on low I turned it up to high for an hour when I got home from work as potatoes were not cooked but the extra time on high fixed that.  Overall a nice change for supper and will make it again but with more juice next time.

This is DELICIOUS! I was looking for a slow cooker recipe that used ingredients I had on hand. Namely chicken breast and a sweet potato. I had a can of black beans in my pantry and had spicy green salsa in my fridge.  I halved the recipe but did double the chicken broth to fit. I did not have red peppers so did not use them. The spice blend in this recipe was so delicious!  I served it over brown rice. A yummy recipe that  is easily adaptable. Thank you!

Yum.  This recipe is a little different, which  I enjoyed.  I skipped the browning and added a little more broth than the recipe suggests.  Definitely use hot salsa for maximum flavor.

I thought the recipe was good and very easy to make.  For me the exceptional taste that everyone talks about just wasn't there.  I probably would have given it more stars but my expectations were set so high with all the excellent reviews.

I made this for my book club and it was a hit! Based on other reviews, I did make some changes. I used only about 2 lbs of chicken (plenty), a full jar (16 oz) of the Pace three pepper medium salsa, and a full cup of chicken broth. While the recipe calls for 1/4 c of cilantro, it mentions 1/4 cup sprinkled on the chicken and 1/4 cup mixed with the broth and other ingredients. I only used 1/4 cup in total. I also doubled the remaining spices. I will definitely make it again!

Very simple dish to make. I substituted mild salsa as my boys don't enjoy a lot of heat. Served it with Jasmine rice. Nice flavor and filling meal.

I skipped the browning step and used 2 cups of salsa, and 3/4 cup broth, and  extra cumin.  I also added some frozen corn.  We didn't think the pepper added anything so I'd leave that out next time.  Served over rice.

I've made a solemn vow to never eat sweet potatoes again so I used acorn squash and that turned out nicely.  I also used (1) red pepper and a bunch of poblano and banana peppers which worked out wonderfully.  

I ended up using chicken breast as that was what I had and then shredded it and served it in tortillas.  That was excellent.

I used raw sweet potatoes and increased the amount of chicken broth.  I cooked it 2 hours on low and 2 hours on high.   I didn't have allspice but didn't miss it.

Made mine in a Dutch Oven with Crispy Skin Thighs! It was so good. I deboned my 5 big thighs - 1st time super easy - run a sharp knife on the underside right next to the bone, not cutting all the way thru - sooo easy! And then trim out the cartlidge at the end. Voila. Didn't have hot salsa so used medium Picante sauce (thicker salsa for cooking medium  and sprinkled one side of the thighs with cayenne. and no pepper/ Used my enameled Lodge Dutch Oven, browned both sides a little longer to get the cooking started more - removed, then added garlic, sauteed few mins. then add all other ingredients.  As others suggested used one can black beans and 1 cup of corn. Darn my cilantro had gone bad so I used parsley and sprinkled in corriander (ground cilantro seed) in place.  Used at least 1 cup + broth and probably double the pcante sauce/salsa  - didn't measure but there was a lot to cover in pot - Placed thighs on top, skin side up and cooked in oven at about 375- 400 for 1-1/2 hrs maybe a little more - removed the lid last few minute to crisp up the skin which was already nicely browned anyway.  This was so different and delicious -The sweet potatoes absorbed the heat from the  cayenne - it had a nice "gravy" and served it over brown rice.  Hearty, healthy, filling meal - the chicken was super!

This dish was very tasty i was a little nervous after reading the reviews thinking it may not turn out right.
My advise if you are planning to make it :--stick with the amount of liquid in the recipe it definitely was not dry, i added a little more broth and i felt it had too much liquid. adding the corn was a good suggestion.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to prepare and tastes great.  I used about 1 1/2 lb of chicken but used the full recipe for the sauce.  It was just spicy enough coming out of the slow cooker, but we had left overs and after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days the spices were enhanced somewhat.  Still great overall.

I took the recipe and adapted it to what I had on hand {used 3 good sized boneless skinless chicken breasts, used  2 cups of  medium hot salsa, and added a small finely cut up jalapeno pepper  to increase the heat. The sweet potatoes really complimented the rest of the ingredients. With sides of rice and a green salad, it was a great meal! I not only plan to make it again, I've sent the recipe to 3 friends!

I followed the recipe but doubled the sauce as others suggested.  I ended up with far too much sauce and it was fairly bland.  I added more garam masala, a can of tomato paste and some liquid condensed chicken broth (a great way to add richness and flavor).  Then it turned out great!  The sour cream was a good complement but no one used the limes.  Served it with couscous and a broccoli salad with water chestnuts and dried apricots.

We loved this recipe, and will definitely be making it again.  Due to timing, I made it on the stove top instead of in a slow cooker, and I used cubed chicken breast instead of chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful blend of flavors!  Next time I will do the slow cooker method, and may try adding some corn, as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Flavorful and he chicken was amazingly tender in only 4 hours. The potatoes seemed overcooked, though, so I might wait and add those after the first hour next time. Definitely worth a repeat.

It seemed easy and tasty and everything was on hand except chicken and cilantro, which were purchased yesterday.
Prefer thighs rather than breasts, as they have more flavor.  What I bought were six thighs,  bone in, skin on.  Prior to serving removed the skin.  Followed the recipe with a couple of changes, mainly the addition of turmeric which I tend to add to every stew or soup, and I always prefer to use jarred roasted red peppers for the ease and flavor.  We also prefer medium salsa.  What seemed odd to me was setting the crock pot on low for four hours.  Normally it's high for four and low for eight.  Fortunately I was at home during this cooking process today and while it was initially set on low, noticed after two hours that the potato chunks were still hard as rocks, so changed it to high for the remaining two hours.  Also felt the need to add more liquid, as others have stated.  Ended up with nearly 2 cups of chicken broth, rather than the initial half cup.  Not sure if the temperature was a misprint or not, but thankful I was at home to check and not assume that the meal would be done on low in four hours.  
The two of us enjoyed the meal with bread, salad and wine .  There are definitely enough leftovers for one more meal.  This is a keeper for us and so it shall be made again.
Thanks to the person who sent it in.

Great recipe!  I skipped browning the chicken first as I didn't have time, and it still turned out great!  As suggested by many others, I doubled salsa and broth, nearly doubled spices and garlic, and used 1 can of beans and 1 can of corn.  The lime and fresh cilantro made it taste very lively and fresh.

My husband and I loved this and it was very easy to make. My crockpot has a removable pot that can be used for browning so I browned my bone in thighs to impart more flavour. I added a can of corn niblets and used one 19 oz can of black beans.  Threw in a few star anise, which added a beautiful flavour.  Will definitely make this again!

No, I made no changes. My husband and I enjoyed it. Oh I did make one change. Boneless, skinless thighs were very expensive. I bought with bone and skin, precooked and removed bone and skin. Followed recipe from there. We had left overs enough for 2 more meals. Very Good.

Too bland and I used the hot salsa - next time I'll try more "spice" and use a different salsa.  I did like the combo of black beans/sweet potato/corn.  I'll try the recipe again with spicier alteration.

Not up to standard!  The cilantro is put in too early so no flavor and I am not sure what the sweet potatoes add.  They were mushy.  We were very disappointed!

Didn't have time for slow cooker so did it on stove top.  Added a small chopped onion, just one can of beans and  one and half cups of frozen corn, upped the broth to 1 cup.  Used 1 tsp cumin and 3 tsp. taco seasoning mix.  Lightly coated the chicken thighs in flour then browned, added peppers and onion cooked for few minutes then added everything else and simmered for 1 hour.  I substituted red potatoes for the sweet as that was what I had.  Very good!

I only had cilantro, chopped garlic, and semi(barely) thawed mini chicken thighs, as well as the broth and dark red kidney beans. I added white rice at the end. This is a great dish to make because it is so filling, flavorful, and it can be cooked without me having to be there! Highly recommend.

Wow!  That was interesting!  We like to try different things and this was definitely in that category.  I read several reviews before making it and decided to go with 1 can black beans, 1 can corn, 1  cup chicken broth, 2 cups mild salsa and 5 cloves garlic.  Served it over plain white rice with a dollop of sour cream which I think put it over the top :-).

This was an excellent recipe which I have made several times with only a few changes. Because I only have to feed four people, I use about two pounds of chicken. I've found that this works well with different cuts of chicken, especially chicken breast cut into small pieces. As some other reviewers have recommended, I replaced one can of black beans with a can of corn and increased the sauce, making sure to add more spices to compensate. Also, as my family does not enjoy spicy food, I usually use medium salsa.

An easy and very tasty recipe!  After reading other reviewer's comments, I adopted their suggestions about increasing the amount of spices.  I also increased the amount of salsa to  2 cups.  On my  own,  I decided to skip using chicken broth and added 2 cups of tomato sauce instead.   I will definitely make this recipe again.

VERY GOOD  I fried the chicken ahead with parsley.
I did almost double the sauce, and only used med.
salsa. I added corn.  Not a lot of cumin , but some..
It has a nice bite. Serve over rice. Can't beat it.

I made this and really enjoyed. I made too much and still figuring out how to cut recipes down for two people with no more than two left-over meals. (So far we've had five meals and still lots of leftovers!)  Next time I WILL brown the chicken first (I know that it does make a flavor difference but was just too lazy this time), may add the sweet potatoes later in the process (they really get overcooked) and add salt and pepper to the dish while cooking. I didn't this time and had to add lots at the table. I agree with the person who suggested serving with tortilla chips--it really adds to the flavor.

Loved it! I didn't have enough thighs so added one breast. I didn't have all the spices on hand so only used 1 tsp cumin, 1/4 teaspoon cajun, 1 teaspoon turmeric. Wow it was spicy and awesome. Loved being able to use yams/sweet potatoes. I also didn't have red sweet peppers but had frozen mixed pepper strips. Did not us corn as others suggested.... No room in the cooker. Cooked for four hours on high then it remained on warm for the 6 hours. Served over white rice. I will make again, sooooo good!

This was tasty and simple to make. I will definitely make it again. I used half the amount of cilantro since hubby doesn't like cilantro; it came out great and he loved the dish! Chicken comes out tender. The only tip I would give is to chop your sweet potatoes into medium or larger pieces (I chopped into small chunks and they half melted). Yum!

Delicious!! The only changes I made were that I added a whole jar of salsa instead of just a cup and I added a can of corn, too. Served it with shredded cheese and tortilla chips. Yum!

None of us cared for it.  The sweet potatoes were too mushy, the peppers were unrecognizable, and the taste was just odd.

I have made this several times, and loved it.  Tonight, I tried something different, and made it with steak instead of chicken.  I used a flat iron steak, uncooked, and sliced it thin, and used it in place of the chicken thighs, otherwise following the recipe.  It was a delicious variation, especially after adding a dollop of sour cream to each serving (over rice).  Will rotate between chicken and steak from now on!

This dish is amazing!  I read the recommendations and did the following:  I did not brown the chicken first, added one cup of chicken broth, one can black beans, one can corn, and I used one full 24 oz jar of salsa.   I had a lot of broth, but served it with rice so it never went to waste.  The remaining broth and vegetables I will use on a baked potato.  The only thing I will do different next time is to purchase a medium salsa not hot...it was a little too spicy.  Thank you to the chef for sharing this recipe because it is delicious!!!!!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I made it and added onions.  I also made it on top of the stove with left over grilled thighs and drumsticks.  The spices were on point.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thank you upstateNYcooker  for the outstanding recipe.

This was incredible! Even the kids loved it. I made a few changes so I could use what I had on hand. I used kidney instead of black beans. I added shredded cheddar & I used brown rice. I also added adobo seasoning.

We used bone-in chicken things, and otherwise followed the recipe.  The thighs came out nice and tender, but the flavor of the stew was off.  We tried adding some smoky chipotle tabasco sauce, and the chipotle flavor actually complemented the sweet potatoes nicely.  Still, I think this dish needs some tweaking.  Not enough spices, and the sweet potatoes don't really go with the other flavors.

Yummy recipe! I made home made salsa with cilantro and it was good! I also added 1/2 a diced red pepper and 2 cloves of garlic (since my husband loves garlic and peppers) and it went well over rice or in wheat tortillas with toppings! I'm definitely going to be remaking this!

Love this! It is even great to serve guests. My recommendation is to add the sweet potatoes later in the day, or they get too mushy. Someone else suggested cutting them into larger chunks which might be the answer if you are gone all day.

Very good  Had to cook  longer , would cut sweet potatoes much smaller to cook better.  I like it spicy but my family thought it was hot.  would use mild salsa next time. A fabulous way to perk up the tired chicken dish !!!!

Used boneless chicken breast, increased garlic & 12 oz. Salsa Especial (Trader Joe's) . . . absolutely delish! Served over brown rice medley (TJs) with avocado, cheese & yogurt (sour cream).  Chicken was moist - one of the best meals I have ever prepared and I'm 57 y/o!

I followed others advice and doubled all seasonings, 1 can beans, frozen corn at the end, 1 can rotel tomatoes and a jar of salsa. I did it on stovetop. It was a big hit. Very tasty. I will definitely make it again. I served over rice with warm flour tortillas.

Made this twice and followed the recipe quite closely but my husband found it to be a little bland. 
Made it a 2nd time and did the following: Use hot salsa
added extra pepper, added extra cumin and about 5 cloves of garlic.
Got thumbs up from husband and 2 guests!  
(I don't eat meat, so it's a challenge to cook and am always looking for feedback)
Found it to be a good idea to brown chicken first.  Cooked in slow cooker on high for first 1 hour and then low for remaining 3 hours.

My first time to do this recipe and my whole family loved it. The changes I made is that I double the portion of the chicken broth because I want it to have more sauce. I only have one can of black beans available so I use lentils for the second can instead. All the same, it taste very good. The cumin and all spice makes it smells so good you can't resist.

I made this last night and like so many other reviewers, it was a hit for my family. I did make the most common changes: one can of black beans only, and I doubled the salsa and chicken broth. A few reviewers mentioned 4 hours on low was not enough so I did 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low. It turned out great, potatoes were done and plenty of liquid to spoon over rice. I will do this recipe again, however I will not double liquids and I will follow the cooking recommendation of 4 hours on low. My slow cooker is relatively new and has a sautee function so browning the chicken thighs first is easy. Thank you to all the reviewers who were emphatic about the fresh lime juice at finish. We agree that really pulls the flavors together.  I sent leftovers in with my husband today at his request, AND my fairly picky 17 year old who does not like beans nor sweet potato said he really liked it. Yup, it's in the rotation! Delicious and easy, hard combination to beat.

Slow Cooker Latin Chicken Haiku: "This should've been great. But the flavor was too light. But I'd make again." I guess I should've followed so many of the reviewers' suggestions on increasing the seasoning and/or liquid b/c I followed the recipe to the letter and we found this to be very very bland when for all intents and purposes, it shouldn't have been. When we served it (over basmati w/ an additional sprinkle of cilantro), we needed to add way more hot sauce and salt. The chicken thighs were cooked perfectly and their leftovers were better smooshed into a quesadilla for lunch the next day.

This was so delicious.  The favors blended together beautifully.  I used boneless chicken tenders instead of thighs and 1 TBS of dry cilantro instead of fresh and it was still really good.

This is my fave crockpot recipe and my go-to chicken recipe for the stovetop as well. I don't even measure anything anymore - I just throw it all in. I made it tonight with some variations. I had half a jar of pineapple salsa to use up, so I decided to make this recipe with a twist. I thought the pineapple salsa would go well with jerk seasoning, so I heavily coated 4 chicken legs in jerk seasoning and seared those in a large skillet. While those were searing, I chopped up a white sweet potato and opened a can or black beans. I put the beans, potato chunks, and pineapple salsa on top of the seared chicken in the skillet and added a teaspoon of chicken bullion and a splash of water. I added the barest dash of cinnamon (instead of the allspice or nutmeg). Cover the skillet and simmer for 35-40 minutes and you're ready to eat! A squeeze of lime over the top and a couple corn tostadas to scoop up the beans and add a nice crunch. It was perfect and just as delicious as the original version. 

This dish is just as easy to prepare on the store and is so much quicker! Less than an hour and you are ready to eat.

Very good taste, I would just recommend using chunky salsa.  Chunkier the better.  I pretty much made the recipe as it said, other than the beef stock-didn't have chicken.  Turned out great.  Can't wait to taste the left overs tomorrow.  I am sure their will be even more intense flavours tomorrow.   Mmm... Very good.  Will definitely make this again.

Loved it! I didn't plug in the slow cooker properly so I lost precious hours in slow cooking this.  I simmered on low on the stovetop for about 45 mins and it was perfect. The sauce was a bit thin so I added a can of tomato paste to it which did the trick nicely (I had doubled the recipe) and I don't like soft bell peppers so I added them just a few minutes before serving. I also added some corn.  Fantastic recipe.

Added a full cup of broth instead of just 1f2 cuz some reviews said dry. Also a whole jar of the salsa (16oz I believe) was excellent.

A very good recipe that I followed almost exactly even using chicken thighs instead of breasts that I usually use. The recipe turned out very good and my only complaint is how many unusual things are required to make the recipe but it still turned out well.

Hubby and I agree this was the best dinner I've made in a long while!  I followed other peoples suggestions and used 1.5 cups salsa and 2/3 cups broth so it didn't dry out. It's great served over rice or in a tortilla! Don't skip the lime, it brings out all the flavors.

I made it tonight mostly to use the thighs and sweet potatoes.  I didn't have bell pepper, cilantro, or black beans!  I didn't fry chicken first.  I cut sweet potatoes into one inch cubes.  Added some hot sauce for added heat and squeezed in juice of one lime.  Cooked in slow cooker for four hours on high. Delicious.

The boy called it bland.  Plus, it took way longer in the slow cooker than the recipe states, and that was on the 'high' setting.

YUM!  Tried this today.  OMG!  It's actually still on, but it's been 4 hours & chicken is super tender.  These are the changes I made: b/c I didn't have chicken broth today, I put I tablespoon of cream of chicken soup & poured a little broth from some canned chicken soup; seems weird, but worked great!  I also added a little water.  Made it too soupy, so I added a little flour, now it's perfect!  I also used jake peon peppers with orange, red, and yellow.  I also added onions.  I was missing cilantro, but the cumin is wonderful.  Also, I used fresh garlic along with garlic powder & seasoned salt w/pepper when I seasoned my meat.  I also skipped the browning step.  Finally, I added some brown sugar.  When I say delicious.....I mean it!

Too many ingredients to be so lacking in flavor.  I followed the directions to the T and like previous reviewers, added a bit more broth to the crockpot.  It was really bland and required so many prep work that it spoiled the ease of crockpot cooking.  Won't be making this again...

I loved this! The only thing I did different was use breast instead of thighs for personal preference. 4 of my 5 kids liked it but did think it was a bit too spicy. My hubbie said "it is pretty good for healthy food".

Blah - maybe it was the fact that I used chicken breasts instead of thighs...but I was disappointed with the way this came out. I thought with all the spices and hte sweet potatoes this would be tasty and I didn't enjoy this at all.

AMAZINGGGG recipe!!! all the ingredients taste so incredibly well together!! The chicken meat just pulls right off from the thighs. i used bone-in thighs and skinless legs and it worked perfectly. cooked it on high for 5 hours. A must try recipe! :)

The stew is great! However the chicken was a bit bland (taste like chick as my husband would say). Next time I will season the chicken more by adding cumin and a bay leaf with the S&P. But the recipe was otherwise very tasty. The sweet potatoes were a great touch.

This was good. However I omitted the olive oil because I skipped the first step of browning the chicken in the frying pan. I just used 8 skinless chicken thighs (however many lbs that is). Salted and peppered the chicken and put them in the crockpot. Just put one can of black beans and increased the broth to 1 cup. Increased salsa to 3 cups. Increased the garlic to 7 cloves. Added one can of corn. Oh yeah I also cooked on low for 7 hours.

Ater reading the reviews I had high hopes for this recipe, but I ( and my family) found it to be very bland. Won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe. My husband is very picky and he loved this one. We dont like sweet potatoes so we just excluded it from the recipe, we used kidney beans instead of black added some corn and it came out delicious

Great flavor, I made a few substitutions, used chicken breast, and as recommended by others reviewers, I double the liquids, which I am glad I did, it came out perfect, I also used white potatoes instead of sweet potatoes, and Italian herbs instead of Allspice.  It is definitely a repeat!

This was a mixed bag.  I followed other reviewers advice and omitted the skillet step, and I subbed a can of corn for one of the cans of beans.  I started the cooker on low, but bumped it up to high halfway through and my chicken was still a little pink on the inside.  The sweet potatoes do seem to get mushy.  I wish I had added more liquid as others have suggested.  We liked the flavor (though we thought it could have more of a punch), and liked it even better the second day.  A good base recipe to play with - Thanks!

one of the best slow cooker recipes.  Have made this with thighs and also with chicken breast.  Usually serve this with rice cooked in chicken broth with a little lemon juice and cumin (and salt and pepper and a pinch of oregano or basil or whatever seems right at the moment).  Personal preference is for a medium hot salsa in this recipe.

This wasn't bad, but I think I may have cooked it too long, because the sweet potatoes totally disintegrated (although that did create a nice thick stew.) I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the liquid and I'm very glad I did. The lime wedge and a little extra cilantro when serving really helped to brighten the flavor. Next time I may add some lime juice with the rest of the liquid and double the cilantro. With some mods this could be a keeper.

This was quite good.  I omitted the sweet potatoes since I'm not a fan.  I served it over rice with a dollop of sour cream and some sliced avocado.  I used medium salsa and I'm glad I did.  It had a good kick and hot would have probably been too spicy for my family's taste. I followed the cooking instructions exactly and it was done perfect.

This was so good. I only had 1 sweet potato so I added some frozen corn and half an onion. I also didnt have fresh cilantro but dried worked as well in a smaller amount. My 2 1/2 year old ate this up!!!!!

soooooo yummy! Quick cooking! I actually forgot to plug in the pot and then I only had 2 hours left. Cooking on high wasn't enough, so I put it all in my Pressure Cooker for 10 min and it was perfect. As if I had left it in all day. LOL Everyone loved it! I cubed 7 chicken breasts instead, because I hate bones!

Very good!  I used BLSL chicken breasts.  Used one can of corn insead of two beans as suggested. My family really liked it.  My husband found a need to have with flour tortillas.  I did serve with white rice.  Very flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

Only minor changes: I used 1 can of beans, and chicken breast tenders. Mine took a lot longer to cook, until I finally turned it up on high. I really liked the taste the allspice gives it. The sweet potatoes were fantastic - my daughter loved it! My other picky eater (husband) said he liked it, would eat it again, but only thought it was worth 3 stars.

Loved It!!!!  Huge hit at our house.  The changes I made were I used gold potatoes instead of sweet, since no one will eat sweet potatoes, & since I don't eat tomatoes, I used hot green salsa. I added in about 1 cup of frozen corn kernels about 45 minute before it was done & that worked really well.  Will make again.

This was very good, but 4 hours in the slow cooker is definitely not long enough. I used dried black beans (soaked overnight) and they weren't fully cooked. Next time, I'd like to try it with bone-in chicken breasts, as I'm not a huge fan of thighs. I want to cook it up to 7 hours and add the sweet potatoes in for the last 3. Looking forward to trying it again!

This was very good and easy.  I think it could use a little more flavor.  Next time I'll experiment with more spices or a different salsa.

I am so glad I gave this recipe a try! I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible, but I did skimp since I only had one can of black beans and one yam, plus I used only about 1 1/2 lbs of bnlss, sknlss thighs. Even so, it came out so delicious!  It probably was soupier than it should've been but I served it on top of red rice and it was awesome!  I made my red rice with frozen mixed veggies and I used diced tomatoes (didn't have tomatoe sauce) so the combo of everything together made for a very hearty and filling but yummy dinner! Can't wait to make it again!

Not bad.  It won't become a favourite but I will probably make it again sometime.  Next time I will leave the sweet potato out.  We all agreed that it was a bit odd in the dish and just didn't seem to fit well.

WOW! We loved it, and it made great leftovers. After using my husband and kids as guinea pigs, I feel sure this will be a hit with company.

Pretty good, my husband loved it & he's not a spicy food kind of guy.
