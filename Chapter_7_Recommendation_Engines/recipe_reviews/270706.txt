The Adjust feature doesn't work correctly; original recipe shows 2 Tbsp protein powder for 1 lb chicken thighs, but changing servings to 4 instead of 8 shows 13 CUPS or protein powder.  THAT can't be right!

I didn't have mozzarella cheese so substituted with another cheese, queso de cobra, which maybe wasn't the best choice. I also didn't have the protein powder so I skipped it, still very yummy!

Really yummy.  They were delicious and I love the texture.   I made keto bus and had a best ever burger.  
Already planning a batch for next week

Thanks for  the great recipe! Crispy outside, moist inside,  A nice break from our regular keto dished. I had to  make 1 substitution:  no green onions so used dried minced onions. It was still fantastic. I plan to make it again  but will double it so we have left-overs for lettuce wraps.
