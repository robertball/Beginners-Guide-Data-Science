This turned out to be one of the yummiest things I've ever made. Like other people, I didn't need 7 potatoes, I only used 5 medium potatoes. I left out the rosemary because I didn't have any. To the one cup of water I added just enough red cooking wine to turn the water pink, then added about 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. I didn't have any steak seasoning on hand, either, so I used about 1 tbsp Herb Chicken Seasoning and 2 tbsp parsley. Also, I used carrots and fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the mixed veggies - didn't have any of those on hand, either. I did use all the other ingredients as directed.

Also, when I drained the fat from the beef, there was still a bit of grease left in the pan, so I put the mushrooms, onion flakes plus 1 tbsp minced garlic in the pan. I let them saute for a little bit, then put the beef back in the pan and added the rest of the ingredients. Boyfriend said the first time I made this that it was too salty for him (he avoids salt like the plague) so I've stopped putting in salt and have switched to sodium-free or low-salt bouillion cubes. I've stuck with the herb chicken seasoning, though. 

I also put shredded cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes, once everything was loaded into the casserole dish. I've made Shepherd's Pie before, but this one was by far the best one ever.

This was terrific.  I did make a couple changes/additions.  Like the other reviewees, I made my potatoes like regular mashed and added butter, a dash of garlic powder and milk.  I didn't like the rosemary, so I changed that to parsley.  I also added 1 package of brown gravy mix at the end, which made it very savory.  You still must reduce the water down to about a 1/4 cup otherwise its too watery.  I also added added a clove of garlic, but that's the Italian in me!  The frozen peas and carrot mix made it very simple.  A sure keeper for my family!!!!

We enjoyed this recipe but must tell you two things.  My family and I found it to be VERY salty even though I used the low salt boullion cubes.  Therefore, we would recommend leaving out the salt AND the steak spice.  Also, the recipe states that it feeds 12.  This must be an error because we only fed 4 but probably could get 5 out of it.Thank you, however, for your wonderful recipes.  Generally, we love them.

Thanks Christine for this delicious quick and easy recipe.  My husband loved it and my mom also - I made it for her when she came to visit - she took the recipe!  I made a few adjustments - I read the reviews and listen to them with the mashed potato to add milk & butter - I used Lipton's Beefy onion soup mix instead of the beef bouillon & onion flakes - I left out chicken bouillon and Rosemary - just because I don't like rosemary herb.  I used 5 Tbsp ketchup and 1 Tbsp.Worcestershire sause and frozen peas & carrots - It was so tasty, this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Great Recipe!  I used real onion instead of onion flakes, and added just a pinch of nutmeg and ground sage for a little bit of extra flavour.  Very tasty!

This recipe turned out very well, but was also VERY salty.  Next time, I probably won't use the salt or the steak seasoning, but otherwise this recipe is very good.

This recipe was awesome. I followed it exactly and was very pleased.  My only complaint would be that there wasn't any gravy, but it was still delicious!

This was really good except for me stupidly tipping the pan of mashed potatoes a little too far so it all relased at once.. so we had a mashed potato Castle with a meat & gravy moat. The castle ended up being stormed and defeated so its all good!

This is the most like a traditional English Shepherd's Pie.

The only thing is the name; true "Shepherd's Pie" is made with ground lamb - if the pie is made with ground beef it's called "Cottage Pie".

This recipe is far better than those that quote cans of soup and other additions - in all my time growing up in England I never had Shepherd's Pie with any sort of soup in it.  My mum used to make Shepherd's Pie about once a week since it was cheap and my sister and I loved it.  :-)

Excellent!  I did as another posted and put a packet of dried onion soup mix into the meat while cook; rather than the bouillons and onions.  I did not have steak sauce on hand, so did the 5T of ketchup and 1T Worcestershire sauce. I cut down the cooking time by putting instant potatoes on top.  YUMMY!!

This makes a fantastic shepherd's pie, though I agree that using all that bouillon would make it way too salty.  But I always cook with broth from the carton, and using 1 cup of broth instead of the water, and no bouillon cubes is perfect.  With the broth, you can use all the salt and steak seasoning the recipe calls for, and it is seasoned just right.  I also always use instant mashed potatoes.  This makes the recipe a lot quicker and easier.  It's especially tasty with garlic potatoes, and sometimes I will add Romano cheese to the garlic potatoes, an idea I got from another shepherd's pie recipe on this site.

Loved it... Some Recipes I follow to Spec the first time I make it so that I can get a 'taste' of exactly how to tweak it when making it again and I have to say, I don't ever need to change an oodle of this !  Wonderful flavor - different than some bland shepherds pie's I've had -- TIP: to use Yukon Gold Potatoes for the Mashed Pots o Choice :) -- on a Whole Yukon have more of a buttery flavor than say, Russett Pots :)

Really good base recipe. I browned the meat with chopped onion and garlic. After draining, I added 1/2 tsp dried rosemary, black pepper and Kansas steak seasoning. I used 2 cups water, three packets of Trader Joe's concentrated beef broth and one of the concentrated chicken broth. When it began to boil I added beurre manie (equal parts butter and flour mixed together) and whisked it in til it was all dissolved. Let it come back to a boil and added frozen vegs. Topped it with mashed potatoes (made with milk & butter) and sprinkled it with paprika. Family went nuts over it! Definitely a keeper!!

I really loved how easy this was.  Using frozen veggies helped me save a lot of time in the prep work, which is important when you are caring for a baby.  My husband and I loved it.  Next time, I would add butter and milk to the mashed potatoes for better flavor.

We LOVE Shepherd's Pie and this recipe was amazing!! I cut the potatoes in half and added about 1 1/2 TBSP of Mrs Dash otherwise I kept it all the same. The Honey complained that there wasn't any "sauce" but personally I think sauce would've ruined this dish. It was extremely flavorful and YUMMY!!!

This came out delicious with a few modifications. I mashed the potatoes with butter and milk. I added 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp red cooking wine in place of 1/4 of the water. I cut up a whole onion in place of the dried. I added fresh carrots and green beans for the veggie mix. I omitted the salt.

Very tasty and easy to make.  We probably shouldn't have, but 2 of us downed the entire casserole in one sitting...it was that good. I would agree though with the other reviewers that it was a little on the salty side.

Oh my goodness, this was terrific!  I made this tonight as directed with the following exceptions:  Instead of beef bouillon I used Knorr Homestyle Stock (1 beef & 1 chicken)  I added 2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp rosemary, 1/4 tsp chopped garlic (the jar type), 1 whole onion instead of powder, I used about 1 1/2 cups water which I thickened a teeny bit with flour because I like gravy in my Shepherd's pie.  I also added parsley & garlic.  I added a few shakes of pepper but I didn't add salt which was a good thing because the Worcestershire sauce and beef/chicken broth was salty enough.  I made the mashed potatoes as I usually do with butter & 18% cream and added about 1 tbsp of ranch dressing.  I even added more of the frozen veggies to stretch it because I needed leftovers to make 2 frozen TV dinners with the Rubbermaid divided trays.  Before putting it in the oven I put a few dollops of butter on top to help the potatoes brown.  This was super yummy and we are looking forward to our homemade TV dinners.  The only thing I may not do next time (and there will be a next time)is to omit the Worcestershire sauce because we found it a tad salty.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper for us.

This was so good. Will be making this often. I mashed my potatoes with a little milk, salt, pepper, about 2 Tblsp. butter and some chives. While frying the ground beef I added 1/2 of a large onion, chopped and the seasonings. My DIL has friends in Montana where she gets a great seasoning (Sagebrush Sandy's)so I used that because I did not have steak seasoning. Folllowed the rest of the recipe and topped the potatoes with some Sargento Reduced Fat 4 Cheese Mexican. Great recipe Christine. Glad I tried it.

This is a great recipe. The only tweak I'd make to it is, first, flavor the mashed potatoes like you would normally with butter, garlic salt & pepper. This way the potatoes aren't bland. Second, I'd use less rosemary. It was a bit too strong, half a teaspoon should do nicely.

Update 2015: I've been making this for years and apparently misunderstood "steak seasoning" to mean steak sauce like A1. So I recommend putting a tablespoon or two of steak sauce instead of dry steak seasoning. I've never had any complaints, only praise for my shepherd's pie.

I noticed that some of the reviewers found this dish to be too salty, I actually added more salt at the table; just personal preference.  Tripled the amount of steak seasoning called for and added some garlic powder.  Sautéed onions and green bell peppers with the ground beef, I then stirred in corn and Italian-style tomatoes for veggies.  Next time I'll use fresh minced garlic and perhaps some gravy mix or onion soup mix as other reviewers suggested, a bit too bland for my taste buds as is.

Made this recipe as it was stated, wouldn't change a thing. It was excellent! My son and husband tore it up. The leftovers were gone the next day. Thanks, Christine

I did a lot of modification because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used ground chicken instead, only 1 chicken boullion cube and added butter and milk to the mashed potatoes. I also added shredded mozzerella & cheddar cheese on top. That was a great touch!  It still turned out really good except, I agree with a few others, it needs some sort of gravy.  Next time, I will prepare a gravy to go with it.

This was a great recipe with LOTS of flavor. Instead of putting in the frozen vegetables, I added 1/2 a can of corn and 1/2 a can of beans. It was good!

This is my 1st time making Shepherds pie after my husband told me that he would like it added to our family menu.  I liked it.  I have to say that the rosemary really stars in this dish.  Don't leave out the rosemary!  I made the recipe exactly as described (except I added milk to potatoes).  When I make it again (and I will!), I will use less mashed potatoes, There was a bit too much.  Also I think if I had left the meat mixture a little runny, without cooking all of the liquid, it would have enhanced the texture.  Otherwise, I would say that this will be a regular menu item in our home.  Good Job!

My guys absolutely loved this.  I did make some of the suggested additions and it was slightly spicy and very tasty.  Here's how I made it.  For the meat, I used water, onion soup mix, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 tsp basil, 1 tsp steak seasoning, 1 TBSP each of ketchup and Worcestershire.  I omitted the beef buillion so it wouldn't be too salty.  Since I already had sour cream and cheddar, I mashed the potatoes with salt, pepper, 2 pats butter and sour cream.  Then I mixed in about 2 tsp dried onion flakes and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  Put the mixtures in the casserole,dusted with paprika and baked at 350 for 20 minutes and then broiled it to brown the top. Absolutely fantastic.  The potato topping came out tasting like a loaded potato.  I was afraid all the different flavors could become cloying but they didn't.  Give this recipe a try.  It's really good.

MY FAMILY REALLY LIKED THIS RECIPE.  ALTHOUGH, I DID ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS TO IT.  I USED ABOUT 3 OR 4 MORE POTATOES (I LOVE MASHED TATOES!)I ALSO USED BUTTER AND SOURCREAM IN THEM BEFORE I PUT THEM ON TOP OF THE MEAT/VEGGIE MIXTURE. WHEN IT WAS ALMOST DONE IN THE OVEN, I PUT A LAYER OF SHREDDED CHEDDAR CHEESE ON TOP AND STUCK IT BACK IN THE OVEN FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. IT WAS SO YUMMY! I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN!

We thought this was really tasty. The rosemary gave this a wonderful flavor. We all thought it needed some type of gravy or sauce though. I went ahead and made the potatoes like I would regular mashed potatoes with some cream, milk, and a dab of butter plus a few grinds of black pepper. I only made 5 potatoes and we thought it was too much potato topping for the amount of filling. Thanks for sharing this, we had never had shepherd's pie before, but we will be having it again (and again). This is great comfort food on a cool winter's evening. Smelled awesome too! I added osme american/cheddar cheese blend to the top. Great recipe, thanks!!!

My son & I loved this recipe. This was my favorite dish in elementary school years ago. I made the following adjustments: substitute Worcestershire sauce for steak sauce, real onion instead of onion flakes, Lipton's Beef Onion Soup Mix instead of bouillion cubes. The only seasonings I used were salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I was pressed for time, so I used the instant potatoes as the topping and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top. Delicious!

This was quite good! However, the meat and veggies are not in a gravy/sauce type mixture like in most Shepherd's pie. It was delicious though! Next time I will omit the salt, as it did not need it.

I used 7 HUGE potatoes and had way too much mashed potatoes so next time I will just use 4-5. Instead of mixed veggies I just used a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  It came out absolutely wonderful!! I will definitely make this again!

One of our favorite things we've made! (and we cook nightly). I had leftover mashed potatoes and cooked carrots that needed to be used or tossed, so we made this recipe and fell in love!  We tweaked a good bit because we like "heat" in all of our meals. So I browned the beef with some chopped green pepper and seasoned with chipotle chili powder, ground red pepper, steak seasoning per recipe, and black pepper (no salt). When adding the liquids, I followed other reviewers and added 1t worcesteshire and 1t Chilula (hot sauce). We didn't have "onion flakes" so I used 1T dry onion soup mix.  We baked it in the skillet we cooked the beef in - ONE POT MEAL!  And topped with cheddar cheese.  Oh my gosh!  It's 9am the next morning as I type this and I want to heat and dish myself another plate. DEEELISH!

Would definitely add cheese to the potatoes, and maybe make the meat a bit saucier. Otherwise good flavour.

I love the savory flavor of this recipe, and the little "kick" the steak seasoning gives it. But I was disappointed in its saltiness: salt in the bouillon, the salt in the steak seasoning, and actual salt is a LOT of that seasoning! I was also hoping the 90-minute prep-to-table time was an exaggeration, but it took nearly that long. 

(I doubled the recipe, so I'd have leftovers. I used fresh onion because I was out of dried flakes, basil because I was out of dried rosemary, and topped the pie with shredded Colby.)

I will definitely make it again, but using low-sodium beef broth instead of bouillon. And I'll probably make it ahead of time, to avoid a 7:30PM dinnertime.  ;-)

We enjoyed the spices, but there was too much liquid.  I will reduce it to about 1/4 cup next time.  I always add garlic and/or garlic salt to the top of the cheese, too.

This really is a 5 star, easy, good recipe; I gave it 4 because 2 small changes were needed for my preference however the basic template of the recipe is delicious and goof-proof. I only used 1 cube instead of 3...after tasting it was already salty enough at that point. Also, while the beef and vegetables were cooking in the liquid, I mixed some of the liquid with a spoonful of flour and added it back to the pan to thicken it a touch. We will definitely be having this again for dinner. Yum.

I followed this recipe almost exactly but I used some turkey gravy powder instead of chicken bouillon. I agree it was too salty. I would leave out the salt, steak seasoning and also the rosemary next time. Over all it was pretty tasty.

This continues to be a hit with my family!  I thought it was good but not exceptional.  It needed some thing more.   I use the following additions.   1) 1/2 tsp of savory    2) for steak seasoning I use Kirlands "sweet mesquite"    3)  I added 1/2 cube of butter and 1/3 C of chives to the mashed potatoes    4) in stead of bouillon cubes I use "better than bouillon", it is a paste in a jar that is more rich in flavor than cubes.  
These changes have really helped.

This was more of a test to see if my husband would eat it because I will eat anything that even resembles a Shepherd's Pie.  I used parsley, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, peas, carrots, green beans and corn.  I loaded the mashed potatoes with ranch dressing, garlic powder, and cheddar cheese.  Portions made of four people and my husband ate the whole plate!

Good but I cut in half all the seasonings that it called for. I figured I could add more if need be. Would have been way to salty had I added it all in.

This was great, lovely recipe! My kids loved it too! I actually assembled it the night before and put it in the fridge. When I came home from work I just popped it in the oven to bake.  I do substitute the rosemary for parsley. I also omitted the salt and added a table spoon of worcestershire sauce and 2 table spoons of ketchup instead. I also upped the back pepper because my family really likes it.  The mashed potatoes do need some salt and pepper but a little bit of finely minced green onion helps as well.

My hubby and I loved this one. He dislikes the texture of mashed potatoes so I made scalloped potatoes (boxed works just as well)instead for the topping. I followed the reviews by (1) cutting out the salt and steak seasoning (2) Sauteeing the onion flakes and added garlic clove in the fat from beef. Thank you for the excellent recipe.

Followed recipe with following exceptions: added fresh sliced mushrooms, red pepper, green pepper. Didn't have Rosemary so used Thyme. Ok dish - girlfiend, son liked it. Possibly due to substitution - seemed to lack something, (flavor-wise)

I didn't use any of the spices recommended in this recipe since I was missing most of them.  Instead, I used worcestershire sauce and Lipton's Savory Garlic and Herb mix in the meat/veggie mixture.  I also used lowfat sour cream in the mashed potatoes instead of milk.  My husband said it was a bit saltier than he would have liked but he still wants me to make it again.  So next time, maybe no salt in the potatoes and very little worcestershire sauce.  Unfortunately, I'm a salt addict so I really liked the dish.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I make it for my boyfriend and I and he loves it also...he rarely leaves leftovers when I make it! I did change it a bit by adding milk and butter to my mashed potatoes so they wouldn't be too dry and after baking i added a little shredded cheese on top and baked a little longer to melt it...definitely recommend!

I cheat with this recipe. I use refrigerated mashed potatoes when I am in a hurry and 1-1/2 to 2 jars of beef gravy. This is one of my husband's favorites. He claims he could eat it every week.

This is very good!!!  My only suggestion is that you use anywhere from a 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of rosemary.  My husband and I both felt that with the full teaspoon all you could taste was the rosemary and you couldn't taste any other flavors.

I was really disappointed in how boring this recipe turned out.  I think it needs more consistency with something on the base, maybe even mashed potatoes on the bottom then layered with the meat & veg, and topped with the mashed potatoes again grated with cheese.

This was yummy.  The meat was flavorful.  I made the potatoes extra smooth by whisking them in the stand mixer.  The only thing I didn't like was there was no sauce or gravy in the meat.  It was just like flavored ground beef, veggies, and mashed potatoes.  The shepherds pies I had in England had a sauce to the meat.

Very quick and nutritious, but as per other suggestions, recipie calls for too many potatoes.  I scaled back to 5 large and it was still too much.  I also sauted the beef with one finely chopped onion and 1 tbsp. garlic, doubled the beef boullion and added 1/4 c red wine about 10 minutes before it was done.  My 8 yr. old didn't care for it much, but he's picky.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.

Very good, although I did change a few things. I would also recommend about half the amount of rosemary unless you really love it. I used leftover roast beef cut bite sized, and leftover mashed potatoes. I didn't have steak seasoning, so I used Paul Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish Seasoning, which was good but a little much. I will use about half a teaspoon of it next time.

I changed the recipe a bit also. We have to watch salt intake due high blood pressure. I did not use boullion cubes. I made a roux of butter and flour (approx. 3 tbsp each) then added low salt beef broth, onion powder, Montreal steak seasoning, thyme, white pepper and added the lean ground beef plus a can of sliced carrots (drained & rinsed) and partially cooked frozen peas. I poured into a Pyrex 9 by 13 dish that was sprayed with olive oil spray. I made my usual recipe of mashed (red) potatoes and spread them on top. So yummy! My boyfriend loved it!

I made this almost exactly as stated however, I didnt have onion flakes so I just sauteed 1/2 an onion (chopped finely) in with the ground beef and spice mix. I also found this very salty so no need for the salt and depending on the bouillon you use (some are very salty), you might not want the steak spice either. we also topped ours with grated sharp cheddar. All in all, very flavorful and will make again...just with the saltiness omitted. ;)

Definitely a keeper!  I had a bunch of leftover mashed potatoes to use and wanted a recipe for the seasoning.  Super easy to make.  Doubled the recipe using 2 lbs ground beef and a small bag of frozen peas and carrots.  Following some other reviewers' advice, I didn't add salt (or pepper either) because everyone can always add more.  I did add a sprinkling of flour over the beef mixture to make the broth a little more like gravy.  We've had a lot of shepard/cottage pie at various places and we really like this recipe.  You can definitely taste the Rosemary, but we are ok with that.  I did something one restaurant does and added some shredded cheddar cheese on top.

I was concerned with the sodium (salt) content in the bouillon cubes, so didn't use them.  I substituted a package of onion soup mix( still a lot of sodium but less than the cubes), and upped the rosemary. I also used mashed squash, seasoned with nutmeg and maple syrup instead of potatoes. Our beef is supplied from a local farmer and draining off fat never happens! I usually add a bit of oil to the pan, gotta love knowing your supplier. 
Flavour was good, so as a base recipe to work with and improvise, it is good.

Wonderful dish! I've a large family so I used 1.5 lbs of beef and a few more potatoes. I added a clove of freshly minced garlic to the beef with other dry ingredients.  I didn't have onion flakes so I used chives instead. I also added butter and milk to the potatoes.  My family loved it so much I believe this will be a regular at our table.

Loved this!!! I made everything as stated but used fresh onion while browning the beef and I added 2 tablespoons of butter and some milk to the mashed potatoes, which I only used 5 instead of 7. I got 9 servings out of this at the most. Otherwise it would be 5 smart weight watcher points if there were 12 servings.

I enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to make. I liked the idea of mixing meat, starch and vegetables together for a meal.

The steak seasoning brings it up to a great taste level.  Not the usual bland English pie

My family loved this, although it is a Cottage Pie not a Shepherd Pie. I added more potatoes to it but didn't change anything else.

Way too much seasoning! Shepherd's pie isn't supposed to have so much seasoning. I will definitely cut out most of the seasoning next time and I'll probably use a jar of brown gravy instead of bouillon and water. I was thinking I might do cheddar flavored potatoes on top next time too.

I really enjoyed this recipe. What a kick of flavor from the rosemary! I've never used that spice before and bought is specifically for this dish. I followed the recipe exactly.

I switched up the mashed potato portion of this recipe by making them into garlic mashed potatoes.  I used a local companies garlic mashed potato seasoning that I swear by.  The company is called "The Garlic Box" and they have the best products.

Good, easy comfort food.  Everyone liked it, which is always nice with my children ages 1, 4 and 7.

Easy and delicious; the only change I made was to add some milk and butter to the potatoes before mashing, and then seasoned them with salt and white pepper.
