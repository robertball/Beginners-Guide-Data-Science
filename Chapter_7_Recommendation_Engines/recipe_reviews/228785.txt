One of the most.......interesting fudge recipes I've ever tried. I used pecans instead of walnuts only because we do not like walnuts. I seriously had my doubts but it turned out very well. I don't know that we loved it, but it was a new fudge recipe that was fun to make and we had a good time trying it out. We all agreed that next time, we'd try this again with different cookie crumbs. Maybe Oreos.

I had to put the chocolate back on the stove once adding the sour cream. I did use pecans, because I had them on hand. I found this to be a great recipe. Really easy and others loved it when I shared. The sugar wafers make the fudge different than others I have tried. It's a keeper for our house!
