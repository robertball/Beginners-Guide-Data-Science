This was easy and delicious. I used thawed frozen spinach and added a Tbls of garlic and a little crushed red pepper. My family normally won't touch spinach and they asked second helpings!

I've been making this for many years. My mother raised us on it, I've raise my kids on it. We typically don't add the bacon though. Friends would come and see me making it and look as if I'd lost my mind. But, once they tried it....Anyway, I'm glad to see some one post this. It's different but worth a try.

A good way for me to get both my eggs and spinach. Made it without bacon and it was a wonderful side dish. Added some hot pepper sauce and worcester sauce.

It was just alright but very easy. I like spinach but usually use fresh or frozen, but I had a can of spinach that I needed to use. I wanted spinach and mushrooms which I have a great recipe for but didn't have any mushrooms so I picked this recipe because I had everything it called for. I followed the recipe but after tasting I had to add garlic powder and salt and pepper and extra bacon bits for more flavor. DH said, "eh" when I asked him how he liked it and he usually likes everything I make. Might try it with more egg and more bacon and seasonings. And besides, it's not really "fried" since there is no butter or oil. It's more like sauteed in it's own water.

Great idea!  I didn't have the bacon bits on hand, but can't wait to try it with them next time.  I used frozen spinach, added a bit of worchestire and balsamic vinegar, and in the egg mixture added some onion powder, garlic salt, and pepper.  I also sauteed some minced garlic for a few seconds prior to adding the spinach.  Quick and easy, and love the texture!

This reminds me a bit of the San Francisco  dish called "Joe's Special".  It contains crumbled, browned beef, sauteed onions and mushrooms, spinach (frozen - thawed and squeezed) and eggs.  Delicious!

This was great as a basic recipe, we added alot of ingredients after reading the reviews and it was amazing!  I sauteed onion, garlic, and mushrooms first and then added the following to the milk/egg mixture: red pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and  cajun seasoning.  I also used thawed frozen spinach instead of canned.  I know I changed alot, but this really is a great starter recipe that can be accommodated to any taste and we (who are not spinach eaters) really enjoyed it.

Very good!  Reminded me of "green eggs" (as in "Green Eggs and Ham").  Had similar texture to scrambled eggs.  Very unexpected, but very good.  I'd like to try it again but add more garlic, and maybe even some mushrooms!  This would make an "eggcellent" Brunch dish.

This recipe was good but I was a little disappointed because it wasn’t what I expected. I thought it would a lot more different then it actually was.  It tasted exactly like spinach cooked the normal way.  The texture was different though; it was more spongy then normal spinach.  Don’t get me wrong, it was very good and I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

This is pretty good.  I never thought of frying spinach.  I used frozen spinach.  I put the frozen spinach in a bowl of water and added vinegar and salt.  Then, strained the spinach and fried it.  Not too bad =)

Let me start by say I don't like eggs. Sorry chickens of the world just not on my list of food I will eat. At least not till now. This was wonderful even with the egg in it. I have to say I will now eat egg. Will make it again I'm thinking once a week or so it really was a nice change from the same ol Spinach.

Great recipe! I love spinach anyway, but this made it a better treat.  I did add seasoned salt and sprinkled cheese over the top.  I wouldn't call it 4 servings though unless you like very small servings.  I would call it two. For a family I'd double it for sure.

Instead of using bacon bits I used cut up smoked turkey sausage and fried it first before adding it to the spinach.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of garlic and  sea salt.  We served it over white rice and added some Parmesan cheese as a topping.  My picky family loved it.  This is a make again!

I made this with about a pound of fresh spinach.  It was still tasty though I had problems with the water content.  Leftovers were excellent in an omelet the next morning!

"Can we have this every night?" are the exact words my four year old sputtered in between the bites of spinach.  I used fresh spinach, and it turned out yummy.  Now, if I can only get my 1 year old to cooperate with Spinach.

I think this is good way to get more veggies in at breakfast time.  I used the fresh spinach I had on hand and soymilk instead of cow milk.  Added a bit of garlic and salt for flavor.  It came out great and I think cooking it for a while was key so it doesn't come out wet or mushy.

Cooking healthy and on a regular basis for my family is new for me.  I have chosen to depend on allrecipes.com for the inspiration.  This is the side dish from the first night.  All I can say is, "WOW!!!"  My husband informed me that he didn't like spinach and proceeded to eat it like it was cake.  THANK YOU!

I made it!!! It taste soooo good but looks a little different with the egg. My family loved it. I used real bacon cut into tiny pieces and fried it with some onion cut into tiny pieces. I put the spinach in after the bacon and onion were done and cooked it for a few minutes then put the egg and milk in and stirred it almost continuously for 20 minutes until the fluids were cooked down.

I was looking for something new using spinach and bacon today so I tried this recipe. I fried some diced bacon, stirred in fresh spinach and added vinegar, onion and garlic as several recommended, then poured the egg in. Tastes wonderful but my husband refused to try it so it looks like this is my lunch. Really good!

A different way to serve spinach, but one that really is delicious.  I added a little garlic and onion salt/powder for a little more flavor. Excellent.

This is how my mother always made spinach. I also use this recipe to make "Polk Salad". Just be sure to boil the pokeweed in "3 waters" (Boil, discard water, use fresh water, boil, repeat) This is to cook out most of the poison!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was really lacking in flavor.  I'd add more egg & bacon bits next time, and maybe some spices and a little tofu....definitely missing something....

It was ok, but pretty plain. I like spinach well enough by itself, so I don't think I'll do this one again. To me, it just adds calories and not much flavor.

This was pretty good - the egg was a bit much though, next time I'll omit it.  I didn't add the bacon, but did add garlic and some shredded parmesan.  Nice side dish.

Our family usually eats canned spinach with just vinegar on it.  This was a very welcome change and everyone loved it.  Next time, I will make it the same but add a little vinegar just before serving to add a little zing to it.

Spinach has always been the one food I hate. I try to eat it anyway because it's a good source of iron. I really liked it cooked this way because it didn't taste spinachy to me. I substituted the egg with ground flax seed meal and milk for added fibre. And next time I would just leave the bacon out of it. It's good with the bacon but I think it would be just as good without.

I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars.  This was excellent for a spinach dish.  I am not a huge spinach fan, but liked this.  Make sure it is very hot when you serve it.  Not good lukewarm.  I made my two year old try a bit and he didn't spit it out, which is a good sign!
