This was okay. My step-dad used to make this every Sunday and I was really happy to find a recipe for it, but it just wasn't what I expected. I gave it a four anyways b/c it wasn't bad. It just wasn't what I expected. My step-dads used to have more flavor and spice to it.

This is the easiest pasta dish i've ever tried.Im a vegetarian so this is a perfect main course.All you need to round out the meal is a salad and some french bread.

I think there's an error in the recipe.  The ingredient list calls for green onions yet shallots are mentioned in the directions. I omitted the shallots and green onions because I didn't have either. It is a good starting place, but the recipe needs some more seasonings and is a bit dry.  Next time, I'll try it with green onions, salt, additional basil, more tomato juice, and 1/2 a cup of parmesan cheese mixed into the tomato juice to create a sauce.  Otherwise, I was excited that it was meat free and had beans.

This was edible but too dry, and it also needed salt.  Even after I added the salt, my husband still did not like this dish at all.  I thought it was so-so.
