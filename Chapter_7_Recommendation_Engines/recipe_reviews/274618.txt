Daughter is a Pescatarian, so I’m always looking for a Seafood based recipe that goes beyond the basics. This recipe is FANTASTIC! I’ve made it as a quick dinner for four, quadrupled ingredients and taken to a college football tailgate and this weekend- it’ll be used at our daughter-in-law’s ‘Baby Sprinkle’.

Very tasty and satisfying to the pallet, couldn't find a bottled chile-lime vinegerette so made my own from a recipe  instead of leaving the mint whole would suggest chiffonading it.
