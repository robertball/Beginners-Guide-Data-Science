This recipe made wonderful muffins. There is just the right amount of sweetness from the sugar, which balances nicely with the Saskatoon berries. I made a double batch and it made 24 muffins. I will make this recipe again, but I will add even more berries as I like muffins with loads of fruit.

Great recipe! I added an extra cup of saskatoons and had to cook the muffins quite a bit longer than stated (probably an extra 10-12 minutes) and they still weren't very brown on the top and tasted a bit dry. I also substituted half of the oil with applesauce so that may have made a difference.

I used fresh saskatoons and substituted milk with buttermilk and added a tsp of vanilla extract to liquid ingrediants.  I baked muffins at 375 degrees instead of 350 for approximately 19-20 minutes. Will make again, thanks for the recipie.

Substituted the frozen berries for fresh strawberries. Substituted the baking soda for 3x the amount of baking powder. Increased the baking time by several minutes. Turned out delicious.

Delicious! Used blueberries and added some orange zest as another person suggested but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Did bake a little longer...about 23 minutes. Turned out beautifully! Will be making these again!

Good basic oatmeal muffin recipe that you could customize by replacing the Saskatoon berries with other things.

I love this recipe and have made it several times! It is great as-is (though I used regular blueberries because that's what I can get). It also is a great base recipe for different mix-ins and flavors. I've subbed in whole wheat flour for part or all of the all purpose four and I've even used the base recipe to make pumpkin muffins that were wonderful. So far this recipe is pretty foolproof! Thank you for a great recipe!

These muffins are delicious! My trick is to soak the oats in the milk for 10 minutes or so. I used mixed frozen berries & added a Streusel Topping. I make some plain as well because my guy doesn't care for berries....

Great recipe only change I made was topping with a butter brown sugar and cinnamon mix. Great without as a healthy muffin and wonderful with as a sweeter option. Definitely a keeper

super great recipe! I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. My whole family loved them!

I quadrupled the recipe... made a few changes! I used buttermilk added lemon zest and vanilla and doubled the berries. I also used quick oats. They were delicious and not too sweet. Will keep this one.

Added tsp vanilla tsp cinnamon used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. Also used the hand blender on the oatmeal/milk mixture so the kids wouldn t see or complain about the oatmeal. Doubled the recipe and made enough for pan of mini muffins and one pan of regular muffins. Was great!

I had Saskatoon berries from my CSA box so I thought I would try this recipe. These muffins were fine. They turned out (after I had to bake them for an extra 10 minutes) but they just don t really taste like anything. I ve had much more flavorful muffins. Will not be making again...

We don't have Saskatoon berries around here but I made this with blueberries and they were delicious. Did take a little longer to bake than stated as others noted. Nice balance with the oats and not too sweet! Yum!

I added some orange zest (lemon would be good too especially if you don't have the tart berries which I didn't) and several shakes of cardamom. As other reviewers have said they were nowhere near done at 18 minutes. Definitely a "repeater" recipe!!

I rarely rate recipes below 4  but these were just ok. I had fresh-picked Saskatoons and I used about 1 1/2 c. I also added a tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon but they were still fairly bland. To be fair, I forgot to put the brown sugar on top before baking but I think it still would need more. Next time I would make a proper streusel of brown sugar, flour, and melted butter to put on top.

Quite pleased with this recipe. We just had canned saskatoon berries and they substituted well. Topping: I mixed white sugar with cinnamon instead and this turned out nice. Used 1/3 coconut flour; 1/3 amaranth flour; and 1/3 buckwheat flour since I like a heartier muffin and this also worked. Saskatoon is a great option for muffins since the baking seemed to remove all the crunchy seeds that you notice eating them fresh.

Made the muffins with organic oats and flour. Added 1 1/2 tsp. Vanilla and a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of cardamom. Used butter over oil and increased berries by 1/3 cup. Baked at 375 for 22 minutes.
Made 12 and work buddies inhaled them

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I learned you need to melt it first because the cold milk turns it to chunks otherwise. My second attempt was better. I loved the slight coconut flavour it gave with the saskatoons. This is one of my favourite recipes now.

I substituted red raspberries for the Saskatoon berries. I baked them 7 minutes longer than called for and they were still under cooked. They are better after sitting a couple days. I will make these again and will freeze some.

I used a mix of heavy cream and milk for the milk 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour and applesauce for the oil. The batter was very thick when I mixed in the applesauce and egg so I added a little milk. They did take longer but they were very good.

My family really enjoyed these muffins. I had 2 cups of saskatoons so I put them all in. Each bite was very juicy! Will make again.
