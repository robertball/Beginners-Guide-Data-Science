Easy to make! I subbed apple cider vinegar for te rice vinegar.  Fabulous taste!  I've made this twice since getting the recipe.  It is great poured over cooked grains.  This is wonderful as a dressing for sweet potato saad.  I can't wait to try this on other exciting food combinations!

Thanks for yet another great recipe John. It's exactly what I was craving with my spinach salad. I also tossed in some dried cranberries and almonds to complement the flavor. YUM!
