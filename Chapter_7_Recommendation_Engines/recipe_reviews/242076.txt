We really enjoyed the addition of strawberries to rhubarb crisp. I only used 2 tbsps of sugar not 1 cup for the fruit filling, it was plenty sweet for us. I also substituted cinnamon for the allspice as I didn't have any. Baking time was 45 minutes in my oven. Thanks for sharing your Grandma Donna's recipe!

Easy & very flavorful recipe for Rhubarb. This is an easy recipe to follow. I added cinnamon & nutmeg to the rhubarb & crumbles. I also replaced the strawberry's with blueberries because that's what I had. Very good.

Too much crisp, not enough fruit.  Almost like eating a bowl of sort of dry, fruity oatmeal. Hubs agrees.  Not sure I liked the egg in this.   Ice cream helped.
