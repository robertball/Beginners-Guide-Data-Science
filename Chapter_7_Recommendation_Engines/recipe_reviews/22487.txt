my mother and i are from the southern part of germany and over there they use the pan drippings with about a cup or so of red wine, bringing to a boil then adding water and flour to the pan to thickin the red wine in it makes for a GREAT gravy  and serve with egg noodles,this recipe is a family favorite but the red wine is a must, just makes the whole thing come together

I lived in Germany and learned how to make this there.  I use almost the same recipe, but place the rouladen in a brownie pan, add a bit of water, then bake it for one hour partially covered. I do not put bacon in the rouladen and it still tastes wonderful.  I have found that it turns out better if you use the really hot and spicy mustard, sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper.  (I like spicy foods, though).  Have never used the brown gravy mix as suggested in this recipe.  The drippings from the meat-onions-pickles makes a tasty gravy base on their own.

Try finely chopping filling ingredients and then wrap. Bake 4 to 5 hours in crockpot with gravy.

Can I give it a even 10?  This is my second favorite recipe on this site.  I do change it to my own and family's taste but follow the basic idea.  I make the rouladen as described.  Then for the sauce I do a modified Sauerbraten Sauce.  I use 2  packages dry brown gravey sauce (we LOVE Gravy) make it to the specs on the package, I add to it about 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 table spoons Onion Powder, 2-3 Tbl. Red Wine Vinegar, 2 Tbl Worcestershire Sauce, and finally 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of ground ginger...  Allow the Rouladen to steam in this mixture to incorporate flavor for 20 to 30 minutes.....  I serve over noodles... Yummy!

Delicious!!!  
My mother is from germany and this recipe is identical to the way she makes rouladen.  For nearly 40 years this has been my personal favorite dish.  Kids like it too.  The pickle provides a unique flavor and works to tenderize the meat beautifully.

This is a great classic dish. I served it to some European friends and they loved it. Some may want to omit the dill pickel but DONT as it makes for a great unexpected taste. Thanks Michelle

My FAVORITE dish even though I didn't know it had a name other than "steak rolls".  We use top round steak, sliced thin, secure with toothpicks, brown them in a skillet, place on a rack in a pressure cooker, add cleaned and quartered russet potatoes and cook at 15# for 10 minutes.  I then mix the drippings with sour cream for a sauce.  Any leftover potatoes (I always make sure there are leftover potatoes) are chopped and fried for breakfast.  I have also found that after browning, they can be frozen and later put straight into the pressure cooker, just increase cooking time to 12 minutes.  We actually prefer the firmer texture this creates.

the bacon doesn't get cooked and the pickle seemed bitter.  I re-did the recipe with marinated mushrooms & coarsely chopped the onion.This made it roll easier and smoothed out the "pickle" tartness.

If you can't find sirloin tip steaks, try using London Broil, asking the butcher to cut it for Rouladin (most grocery store butchers know what to do, but if not have them cut it across the grain 1/4" thick).  My German family always used this cut, which makes for smaller pieces, usually 3-4 for a serving.  You can use toothpicks to hold them together.  Stuff them with whatever pleases you, with variations as mentioned here.  Try sliced mushrooms - yum!

Turned out very good! I pounded the sirloin steaks I had even thinner (covered by plastic wrap). I chopped the bacon, onion, and pickles for the filling. I placed in a crock-pot all day on low. I served with yellow mustard instead of gravy. I'll make this again!

What a unique dish!  Growing up we never had any type of German dishes except for the hot potato salad sold in cans.  As an adult my husband and I went to a few German fare restaurants and loved the dishes but have never had the pleasure of tasting Rouladen.  Well now this has become a standard meal in our house.  Even my picky son and his wife ask for this dish as a Sunday Supper.  I followed the recipe as written but did my own brown gravy to serve over it.  Thanks for a wonderful dish!!

I love this recipe... although sometimes to shake things up a bit I sliced some green and red bell peppers and throw them in the roll... Excelent Dish :) I've loved this dish since my mom would make it for me.

This was really good.  My parents were stationed in Germany when I was younger & my mother's german friend made this for us.  My mother always cooked it, this was my first.  Now I can get that German cuisine when I want it.

This is one of my all time favorite German dishes, i am german and lived there for several years my mom is the queen at this dish. however she cooks hers in a portable skillet hours to get the meat real tender also dresses it with the spicy mustard, chopped onions, and bacon(it really does add great flavor), my mom as well makes the gravy from the broth from cooking the meat, wine and brown gravy mix. we prefer a thicker gravy however it can be made to anybodies likes. we serve ours with potatoe balls, gravy, and red cabbage or any kind of vegetables.

Cube steak or minute steak can also be used.
I use white thread to tie it up. I keep a spool of
white thread in a zip-lock bag just for this purpose.
I remove the thread just before serving.

I have an American version where I use pickle slices, pre-cooked bacon, and chopped onion.  Then I spear several rolls onto skewers to be grilled.

This gets points for being different.  It kind of tasted like a bacon hamburger.  I don't think I bought the right cut of meat - which makes a difference.  I couldn't find sirloin tip steaks that weren't already cut into chunks.  I probably won't make this again, but it was worth trying once.
