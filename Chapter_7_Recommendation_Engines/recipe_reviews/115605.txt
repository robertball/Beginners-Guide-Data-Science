This was really good.  After eating at the restaurant who specializes in this dish I decided to make it myself the next day, and It was fresh and satisfying.  I did skip the rice to keep it low carb, and I  will definitely make it again!

I added fresh sliced radish as a garnish. A little more hoisin and Chinese five spice. Tried substituting ground pork instead of turkey and loved it!! Easy and delicious!

Very flavorful. The 5 spice is strong on the cinnamon side, so I added some soy sauce and a little hoisin (if I remember correctly) to tone it down and then it was perfect.

Made this tonight using allrecipies recipe for hoisin sauce. It was ok. Probably won't make again, although it was super easy. I just felt it needed more flavor and it was missing that ingredient to make it great. I added more hoisin sauce, but that just didn't do it. Not sure what the missing ingredient is, but I hope someone finds it.

Easy and delicious. After I started cooking I realized I didn't have hoisin sauce so I substituted Trader Joe's Soyaki. No water chestnuts on hand so I left those out and I used black rice instead of brown since I had some left over from a dish I cooked a few nights ago.

I did not add rice as we had Easy Asian Pasta Salad from AR with the meal. I used beef broth instead of chicken (what I had open). The use of broth was a great idea and kept things moist. If you like 5 spice powder, you will like this recipe as it is the only flavor that comes shining through.  Apparently we do not and didn't care for it. The addition of cilantro and basil helped tone down the sweetness. We will try another recipe next time but thanks for sharing.
