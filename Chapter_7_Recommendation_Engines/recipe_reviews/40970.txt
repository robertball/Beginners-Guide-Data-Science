This was my first attempt at jerky and the family really liked it.  I would suggest using garlic powder though instead of minced garlic.  The minced leaves little clumps of garlic on your meat.

Made this exactly as written (I believe if you are going to rate something you must make it that way). Great flavor, however I like peppered jerky, next time I will add lots of pepper. First to the marinade, then again after I put it on the racks. All in all, a great starter to model to your own taste.

I'm not quite sure how it tastes yet (I'll update as it's done), but the smell of it is heavenly. It was very easy to put together, and now the hard part is waiting for it to cook!  Update: Absolutely love it. Didn't change a thing, and it's wonderful. The flavor is great, but I wouldn't call it the "store bought" taste.

Great recipe, but I found the soy sauce + salt overpowering.  Next time I'll omit the sale, cut down the soy & add in some hot sauce.

Awesome recipe, I have added some ingredients, 1tsp black ground pepper, and 1tsp red pepper flakes, to balance the 1/2  cup brown sugar.

Just tried this marinade.  I really like the flavor, but I feel it's a tad bit too salty (at least for my taste).  I'll definately make it again, but next time I'll omit the 1/4 tsp of salt. But overall, very good flavor.

I made this last week for the first time of ever making jerky and it turned out great. The family loves it. I'm not a huge fan of beef jerky, but even I liked it. Will definitely make again.

First, I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was great!  My children ate the entire batch in one sitting!  I don't have a dehydrator, so I set the oven to 170 degrees, stuck toothpicks through one end of the beef strips and hung them from the top oven shelf/grate, propped the oven door open slightly with a wooden spoon, and cooked for 4 hours.

I found the first batch a little dry for my liking, so the second time I made it, I added 2/3 cup of worchestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of honey, and 2T of red pepper flakes for some added kick.  Awesome!

Was looking for a good easy recipe for Jerky that didn't involve the little packets that you buy that make the Jerky so salty its hard to eat.  This was fantastic!  My husband made it, and added Garlic (he's Italian, and adds Garlic to everything) It was awesome!  Thank you Kaprer

This was the second time Iâ€™ve made beef jerky. I liked this recipe. I would also us garlic powder because chunks of the minced garlic were all over the place.

I thought it came out great!  Will most definitely make it again. I made a triple batch using grass fed beef top round from whole foods and it was a beautiful piece of meat. I've made all kinds of jerky over the years and I did not find this recipe to be salty.  If I were to try anything different it would be to use garlic powder instead of minced garlic (only to save time), add some crushed red pepper(1/2 tsp per lb.), same amount of cayenne pepper and finally maybe a little less brown sugar. But by no means let these changes reflect how good this recipe is when made exactly as outlined. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!

Wow! Best jerky I've had including the store bought stuff. It's even BETTER if you leave it in the sauce overnight :)

This was first time making jerky other than from a bought package.  Was very easy to make and turned out well.  A tad too sweet for me but my kids love it. For those not familiar with mesquite flavoring, it is a sweet-smoky flavor and this recipe nails it.

Careful with the Mesquite it can over power. Good recipe. A cup of soy is a little much for me, My favorite recipe has 1/4 cup of soy a and a 1/2 tsp salt for one pound. So try it, you might just like it. I have to watch my salt, but you have to watch safety. I know this confuses the issue, but be safe!

Made this jerky twice. Making again because it's so delicious that it goes fast! Only difference I made with last batch is used low sodium soy sauce and Splenda brown sugar. Much healthier and just as good! Honest.

I made this in my electric smoker minus the liquid smoke, I chose to use mesquite wood chips and I used garlic powder instead of cloves. Turned out fantastic! Was a bit strong at first, but my taste buds soon adapted. Will continue to make this recipe in the future.

I have a jerky addiction, so I just bought a dehydrator to save some money and make my own. It is in the dehydrator now and smells amazing.
