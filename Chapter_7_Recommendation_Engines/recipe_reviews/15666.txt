This is the same recipe that Cook's Illustrated uses.  For those of you finding it "grainy", MAKE SURE to blend the lime juice with the condensed milk very well BEFORE you add the eggs.  Adding the lime juice directly to the eggs in any way will start to "cook" the eggs from so much acid all at once.  This happened to me when I was in a rush one time and just dumped the eggs, condensed milk, and lime juice all at once.

In my honest opinion - the recipe deserves 5 stars for it's simplicty and the the fact that it can be made so quickly... but for taste and texture it's an average 3 star rating.

It's just the right amount of tartness using 1/2 cup, but if you're looking for a more intense lime taste you can you might try using 3/4 cup instead.  

I used fresh key limes (if you don't have a garlic press to juice the limes, the next best way to juice them would be to cut them in half and score the halves - take a teaspoon and insert it into the scored half and twist the teaspoon as you squeeze the lime - this helps ensure you get all the juice possible) - just run the juice through a fine mesh drainer to remove seeds and any pulp.  

As one reviewer mentioned, the texture is a little bit grainy- most people wouldn't notice it, hence another reviewer disagreeing and noting it was smooth and creamy.  I could tell it slightly off in the texture, but it doesn't affect the flavor.  

I used a graham cracker crust (store bought because I was all out of graham crackers)... I prefer a graham cracker crust versus a regular pie crust for this particular pie.  However, if you do use a graham cracker crust the upper part of the crust will overcook due to the length of time and temperature the pie must cook for.

I made this pie with my oldest son. We made a homemade graham cracker crust, other than that we made no other changes. This turned out pretty good but I think that I like key lime pies made with egg yolks instead of the whole egg. I think the mouth feel is different, it's creamier. There's nothing wrong with this recipe, it's a personal preferance. The kids and I liked it, though. I served it with whipped cream on top. As with most key lime pies, this pie tastes better the longer it sits.

Having tried Key Lime Pie for the first time in Florida recently, I guess you could say I am hooked.  I thought I would try to make it for Easter dessert for a change of pace.  I am glad I did.  This pie was EXTREMELY YUMMY!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks Carolyn!

I had great hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews and seeing how simple it was to prepare.  Alas, the texture was not to our liking.  It kind of reminded me of a grainy cheesecake.  I'm in search of a creamy, light key lime pie and this wasn't it.

This is the "standard" key lime pie recipe from the back of the juice bottle. It is easy and excellent and I've made it many, many times! Last night, I went to the store and bought my pie crust, condensed milk and juice...came home, pre-heated the oven, and opened the fridge only to discover that I only had 1 egg. I was disappointed and wasn't about to got BACK to the store. I almost gave up but discovered a package of low-fat cream cheese and decided to wing it. I combined the can of condensed milk, a little more than 1/2 cup of juice, 1 egg and half the packet of cream cheese...and it worked! It's a much more creamy pie, but very tasty, too...so if you're ever in a egg pinch or prefer a more creamy pie, this might be one solution for you. (p.s. You have to let it cool completely before it sets.)

Delicious!  I made this last weekend while my sister-in-law visited.  She said that it was a very good key lime pie (I had never had it before).  The texture was good--I did use my new microplane grater for the lime rind.  I found it VERY tart (as I am told key lime pies are supposed to be), so I made a slightly sweetened sour cream topping and offered sliced macerated strawberries for options.  Surprisingly wonderful given the small amount of effort required.  Thanks so much for sharing!

A most refreshing dessert.  My daughter first made this with regular lime juice, the next time we used key lime juice, either way, it is great. A wonderful summer dessert recipe. Thanks!

Nice recipe.  Would make it again.  I used a cracker base, but not Graham crackers as they are loaded with bad stuff.  I used Paul Newman's Arrowroot crackers.  I am at a loss to understand the comments that say the texture is grainy. Eggs, milk, limes hardly add up to grainy.  
Gettting the juice from the lime is as easy as putting the lime in the microwave for a 15 seconds and slicing it open and squeeze.  I second the lady that uses the microfile.  They are wonderful for any grating - limes, lemons, cheese.  Worth every penny you pay for them.
My Husband gives this key lime pie 9 out of 10 and he is the expert  LOL.

Happy Christmas to all.

This is one of the best Key Lime pies I have had. It was a huge hit at a recent party. And it is unbelievably simple. Definitely worth a try.

I made this pie in my families "oil-crust" pie crust...which is quite yummy.  The pie's consistency was perfect, and the flavor was good...I was 1/8 c. short on my fresh key lime juice, so I filled in with Rose's sweetened lime juice from the 'bar stock'.  I would add a tiny drop of green food coloring, just so folks stop asking you if it's lemon or lime.  I plan on entering this in an upcoming contest...VERY GOOD RECIPE...QUICK AND EASY.

I ended up with a whole mess of lemons and limes from centerpieces after a wedding and didn't know what to do with them. I was hesitant to try this recipe because there are so few ingredients and it is so simple. I thought anything as amazing as Key Lime pie must be more complicated. Not true! I made a pie about once a day until all the fruit was gone and I was never lacking for people who wanted to take it home with them. I used a 50/50 mixture of fresh lemon and lime juice in place of the key lime juice. It was awesome!

This was really tasty! I subbed a reduced fat graham cracker crust and fat-free sw. condensed milk but it was still delicious and has a lovely texture.
Very tangy, but still okay to eat without whipped cream.

This was a really quick recipe that turned out really well.  Made about 18 tarts instead of a full pie and only baked for 15-20 minutes.

My first key lime pie! We're newlyweds on a tight budget, so I was looking for a treat that wouldn't break the bank. This was it! Not only was it economical and easy to throw together, it was very tasty. Not as cloyingly sweet as other lime pies I've tasted. I used freshly squeezed regular limes and took the advice to microwave them for a few seconds. Big help! I upped the lime juice to 2/3 of a cup and increased the zest by another half teaspoon. Keeping with thrift, I kept the regular crust which was lovely and not so sweet. Definitely a keeper! Thanks, Carolyn!

The flavor was good but the texture was not.  It was curdled and lumpy; not creamy and smooth as I remember key lime pie being.  I will try another recipe on this site.  Thanks.

This pie was quick and easy and my family loved it. I looked for a recipe that was baked, I didn't like the fact that some of the others had raw eggs. I found that it was smooth and creamy, not grainy as another reviewer said.

This is pretty much the same recipe as on the Nellie and Joe's key lime juice, except with the lime rind and it doesn't say graham crust. I thought it was awesome, it deserves 5 stars, but i'm giving it 4 because I didn't use the lime rind like this recipe, as I said, I used the recipe on the bottle of Nellie and Joe's key lime juice. Very yummy! =)

I love this pie recipe!  I use more lime juice then it called for for the tarter flavor. I use a store-bought "shortbread" crust too and it comes out amazing.  It is so so easy and I usually always have these ingredients on hand. I serve with homemade whipped cream.  This is always a hit!

Pie had nice flavor but texture terrible.  I will not make this pie again.  It was a disappointment and I made it for Thanksgiving dinner.

I whipped up this pie this afternoon and served it with whipped cream for dessert.  Everyone loved it!  It was simple to prepare and nice enough to serve to company.

I made this and let me start with DELICIOUS! I was so happy when I bit into it. I even decided to make homemade whip cream and it made it even better u strongly recommend it. However I decided to put a little more zest the second time because there just wasn't enough! I give this a huge thumps up!!!!!!!????

I have to agree with the last review that as written, the recipe will give you a grainy texture. Just beat the milk & lime juice together. Beat the eggs separately, and then mix all together and quickly pour into pie crust and it will turn out creamy and smooth. I made a homemade graham cracker crust & prebaked it 10 min & then cooked the pie for 30 min. and the crust was perfect..... not overcooked at all. Delicious. one of the best and definitely the easiest key lime pie recipes I've tried!

Very simple to make, nice texture, very creamy.  BUT not enough lime taste for me.   I would have liked it a little more tart.  Next time I'll add about 3/4 C lime juice.

Quick, easy and very good as is... if you like a sweet pie. I like mine tart, so, after tasting before baking, I added zest from two regular large limes and extra juice. Turned out great. In future I would also cut back on the condensed milk and add an extra egg yolk.

I made this using regular limes about 2/3 cup fresh squeezed juice and sweetened condensed coconut milk to make it dairy free in a prepared gluten free crumb crust.  It was fabulous!

This is so simple and easy.  I do think a graham cracker crust is the only way to go though.

This morning, I looked through five or six other recipes, trying to find one without heavy cream, etc., since I don't have any and didn't feel like going to the store. This was perfect, since there are so few ingredients and I had a can of condensed milk. I didn't notice any graininess. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust. It turned out great, and was very easy to make. I also used a whisk instead of the mixer, but I made sure to mix it thoroughly.

So simple and so delicious. Perfect consistency. I prefer it to be a bit more on the tart side so I added several more dashes of lime juice and kept tasting it as I went along until it finally suit my fancy. I didn't use key limes since I couldn't find them in any supermarket or specialty store. I used lime juice and I think it worked out just as well. Will definitely make it again!!

Delicious! It is definitely a task to squeeze out all those key limes, but everyone loved it! Our friends said it tasted and looked like a professionally made gourmet pie!

My family loved this pie! It was so simple we used around 16 extra small limes and I also added some lime from concentrate (but not enough to affect the flavor of the other limes as the additives in the concentrate tend to make it taste a bit awkward) It took 2 of the limes to get all the lime zest. Very good recipe I already have requests to make this pie again!
