This recipe was so quick to put together and we loved the flavor! The lemon and basil worked perfectly with the shrimp and pasta.  I would have given it five stars, but, I think the ingredient ratio was off for the amount of pasta used.  I used 1 lb. of shrimp instead of half pound and  a full cup of peas.  I honestly think I could have used another half cup to  cup of peas.  I also cooked my shrimp in a frying pan with olive oil salt and pepper  while the pasta was boiling just  because it gives the shrimp more flavor than boiling.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added in spinach too. A quick saute with chili flakes to get the hint of spiciness.

This was good, and definitely easy to make. My only complaint is that the quantities were way off. I would reduce the amount of spaghetti to 1/2 pound and increase the amount of shrimp to one pound. Also, I would add more peas. Will certainly make this dish again, with my edits.

Really good and very easy. I also sautéed the shrimp in garlic before combining all together. We’ll make again!

Great quick, last minute meal! I did saute shrimp instead of boiling with pasta but that was just personal preference and not necessary if you're in a time crunch.

Yummy! Flavors were wonderful. It took me a little longer than I anticipated to peel the shrimp, but will remember next time. I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti.

This was a delicious recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions and added more peas and extra shrimp. I might try cutting this recipe in half since there are only 2 of us.

I also used a pound of shrimp and 15 oz of peas to balance out with pasta.
