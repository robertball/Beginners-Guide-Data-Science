I will be making these again! Really easy and delicious! I only marinated for an hour as well and they were very tasty!

DELICIOUS! I couldn't stop eating these! I only had time to let the shrimp marinate 1 hour, but that was still plenty of time to produce tons of flavor. I used more than a "pinch" of fresh parsley (about 1 tsp), since a pinch wouldn't even be noticeable. I served the shrimp with grilled veggies for the perfect low-carb meal.

Excellent recipe.  I used wood skewers, soaked for an hour and added 1/4 Tsp Cayenne to give it some heat and 1/2 Tsp Tarragon, 1Tsp Onion Powder and 1Tsp Rosemary for sweetness.

Served with sauteed sweet peppers, onion rings and white mushrooms with garlic and fresh ground pepper.

Great dinner.

It was simple and delicious!  However, next time I will be sure to tell the shopper (my son) to buy jumbo shrimp with the tails still on, peeled and deveinec.  Those little bitty white shrimp were tough to clean!  Still, a recipe I will make again.
