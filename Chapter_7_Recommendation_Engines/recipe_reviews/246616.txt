I really liked it.  I gave some to my younger brothers, though they didn't like it.  But my mom really enjoyed it.  I estimated on a lot of the measurements, but it came out fine.  I don't think age really mattersI am I never actually thought of adding ginger to smoothies.  But it really enhanced the flavor.  I didn't have any orange juice so I put a few teaspoons of lemon juice instead.  Than more water.  I thought it looked a bit watery so I looked for ice in the freezer.  But I couldn't find any do I added an extra banana.  I was really satisfied with the results and I am definitely going to make it again.

I enjoyed this. I might add an extra half a banana next time.

Perfect on a snowy winter morning...right before shovelling that foot of snow from the drive.

Meh. I really wanted to like this smoothie, but the actual color is not vibrant green as seen in the profile picture and the flavor is just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, but it makes a dull yellow-green smoothie which was a turn off. You can see the picture in the gallery, it's the one that does not look appetizing.
