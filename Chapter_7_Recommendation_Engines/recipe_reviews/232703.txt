It was good but I did make some changes because it was a bit bland per the recipe.  I added a chicken bouillon cube dissolved in as little water as possible, added a little more Worcester sauce and a little onion soup mix to taste.  These changes made it taste a little more like stroganoff and less like cream of mushroom soup.

Even after adding a second can of soup, 1 cup of sour cream was overpowering to say the least. It was pretty basic, and so I seasoned the chicken before putting the sauce over it. I also recommend adding onion to the stroganoff, just to add a bit of variety to the flavor.

I chose to do two things differently from the recipe:  I used the pasta that I had on hand (Radiatori) and I didn't cut up the chicken.  Otherwise, I followed the directions.  I kind of knew that this would not have a great deal of flavor because of the ingredients which are very easy to have on hand.  The mushroom soup I used was an organic soup from Sprouts (no MSG).  I seasoned the chicken with Papa's Seasoning from this site, and it was done in 45 minutes.  After I finished baking it and taking my photo, I did add some corn salsa from Trader Joe's to increase the flavor.  I would think that this would be a great dish to serve to people who need a diet with little seasoning and to little kids.  This recipe certainly has its place in Allrecipes' archives!  Thank you, PRISSY68!

This was bland as it gets as written. I swapped the Worchestershire out for steak sauce and a can of mushroom stems and pieces drained. In the future I will use fresh mushroom slices which have been browned in some bacon fat.

Suggest using boneless/skinless chicken thighs for a more flavorful dish. Cut into fairly large chunks, coat with flour on both sides & brown nicely in butter, duck fat & bacon drippings for outstanding texture & flavor! Serve over egg noodles cooked in chicken stock & a splash of white wine.

This was JUST what I needed after a wearisome day of teaching! :-[) At the time I didn't have sour cream, but I did have (old) cottage cheese; so I used that, plus a dash of vinegar to make sure it had a tinge of tang to it. WOW! The second time I made it I added frozen peas and carrots to it. This is such a versatile recipe - and just right for a quick, hearty, end-of-the-day meal. THANK YOU!!!

It was decent but not the greatest. I added fresh sliced mushrooms because it's supposed to be a mushroom sauce and there just isn't enough in a cream of mushroom sauce. I also added some paprika and cayenne pepper to jazz it up a little bit more. After making this I realized I could just as well sliced up the chicken first and cooked this in a skillet as well. It would be much faster, if time is of concern.  I will be making this again but with a few more tweaks I haven't decided on yet.

This was OK but I made changes. I added another can of soup with a little bit of milk, added another teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and some canned mixed veggies and one more boneless breast cause I had more people to feed. The noodles seemed dry with the way the recipe was also added some salt and pepper cause it was too bland.

My family loved this recipe. It is quick and simple!   Some people think it is bland but we liked that  because I was also feeding a 1 1/2 and 4 year old and they really liked it.  I would make it again!

I made this as written, however,  I made some revisions as I felt it tasted bland. I had to add  8 ounce can of mushrooms ,and I put in some garlic and onion powder. I am not sure if I'll make it again since it helped very little even with the added ingredients this recipe had a bland  taste and my family ate it but it wasn't  a hit.

Tried it tonight. Was an instant hit with the family. They prefer it over the beef stroganoff.  Very easy for a busy night supper and super great using the Tyson pre-cooked grilled chicken strips. Served with crusty bread rolls and a side salad. Awesome.

I only used 1/2 cup sour cream, added about a teaspoonful of mustard and a 4 oz can sliced mushrooms.  Very tasty. Will make again.

I tried this, but I added a can of undrained mushrooms and it curdled  or something while baking. Since I didn't follow the recipe  it would be unfair to rate it. so I gave it a 4 stars so I could get this comment out there. My advice would be to drain mushrooms if you add any

My chicken thighs were seasoned before I baked them.  I used pasta on hand-angel hair.  The kids loved it.  I was quite simple and ingredients were on hand.

After reading some of the comments, I added pepper (not salt - the soup seemed to add enough salt), granulated garlic and a can of drained mushrooms. After eating the dish, I think I would also add some onion to it.  Once it was done, I removed the chicken breasts and shredded them and then added them back in to the sauce. We put it over mashed potatoes - yummy! We will definitely have it again! Lots of good flavor considering how easy it was to make.

It was too bland as described, so I added sliced green onion, garlic and chopped mushrooms, both closed cup and chestnut to the dish, I substituted chicken thigh filets as breasts are tasteless on their own. The secret ingredient was mushroom ketchup and lots of seasoning.  After that it was really very good indeed.  I will make it again.  Good for big groups of 8+ with large green salad and warm bread .
