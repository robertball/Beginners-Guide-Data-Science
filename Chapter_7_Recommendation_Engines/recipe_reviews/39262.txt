Too sour. No-one in my family cared for it. I would not recommend unless you are very fond of tamarind.

Very good.  I love strong flavors, and this was absolutely delicious and was an excellent accompaniment to a chicken curry dish I made.  Cut back the tamarind paste a bit if you prefer a less sour taste.

I liked this a lot. It was sour yes but in a good way. And, I'm not sure if it was supposed to end up a "sticky rice" but that is what I got and it was the PERFECT sticky rice. Bobby Flay would have been jealous!
