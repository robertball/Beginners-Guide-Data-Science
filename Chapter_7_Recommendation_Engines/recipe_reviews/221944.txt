So glad I read the other reviews and reduced the lemon! Could have gone with just two tbsp of lemon juice and been happy. I had a TON of the bread crumb topping leftover it was a bit too heavy for my taste. I used a combination of both shredded parmesan and grated parmesan. It was nice but lacking something and I can't put my finger on it. It needed something to smooth out the rough edges of lemon garlic and the parm.

Good food here. Just like an appetizer served at a local restaurant. I did halve the lemon juice and may reduce it further next time; My guests raved about this and both liked the lemony taste so it's probably just me. Thanks for a great recipe!

Don't add too much lemon! More is not better.

This is an excellent recipe. Cooked as is. I made this along with a chicken recipe with capers lemon zest and anchovies. It was a fantastic dinner.

What everyone said - reduce the lemon (I should have read the reviews first) and don t use all of the bread crumbs - you have too much and it doesn t completely cook. I also feel like they need to be cooked a little longer anyway.

If you like artichokes this is a excellent recipe. I use frozen artichokes and maybe one tablespoon of lemon juice. Next time I'll try canned. I thaw the artichokes. Thank You for submitting.
