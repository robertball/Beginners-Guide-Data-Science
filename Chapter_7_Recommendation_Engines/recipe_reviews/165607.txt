This is delicious, though I also like to add panko or italian bread crumbs to stretch it.  When I pan fry them, I make a sauce out of the drippings, ketchup, lots of paprika and some curry powder.  Great for taking to lunch the next day. ALSO uncooked patties freeze well until you are ready to eat.  Thaw in fridge and cook as normal.

Very tasty. I liked the easy blending of onion and garlic, tho' had no Parsley and used a generous amount of Coriander, snipped with scissors into the meat mixture.  We are also fond of Cumin, so I was generous with that. Did not wait for the Resting in fridge as we were too hungry.  Will enjoy these again.

My family loved these.  I made flatter patties and substituted bread crumbs for the flour.  I served with a roasted veggie bulgar pilaf and an eggplant-chickpea dish.  A salad would have been a nice addition.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I discovered I had no eggs but the mix still came together well in the food processor. Used two dessert spoons to shape into large meatballs - it made over 20 so well more than 6 servings as the recipe states. I placed them on a baking tray and baked them in 200C oven. Guests raved but I thought there was a lack of flavour compared to what I was expecting.

I don't know what I did wrong, but it took closer to half an hour than 10 minutes to cook this.  After I was done, it was rather plain.  It was basically patties of meatloaf, with no "zing" to it.

I've made these as kabobs cooked over a coal grill and they are magnificent in pita or naan bread with tzaziki.

I usually do not prepare meatballs that often, however, I always wanted to try ground lamb and decided to prepare this dish. I enjoy flavor and texture of meatballs and look forward to preparing dish in the future.

Loved this recipe, the lamb gives it Great flavor.  This will become my new meatball with sauce recipe.  Also Great served with taziki as an appetizer.
