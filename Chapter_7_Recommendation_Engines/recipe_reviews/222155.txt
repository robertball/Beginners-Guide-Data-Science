The meatballs were a bit on the salty side so I'm going to use just half the amount of salt next time I make these. I used hot pepper jelly instead of the currant jelly and they were delicious! Next time I'm going to try the citrus marmalade :)

I use the currant jelly/chili sauce combo for my Sweet  n Sour kielbasa (recipe on this site) I've been making it for YEARS and it's so simple! Can go right in the Crockpot...I love this sauce!

I used Heinz ketchup, chili powder, grape jelly and a bit of bbq sauce. My whole family loved it.
I used frozen meatballs and put everything in my slow cooker on high, about 90 minutes.
Canned sliced pineapples and frozen peppers and onion were sauteed on the side along with instant rice. 
This way only the kids that wanted the pepper mixture could add it. Fast and super simple for busy mom weeknight meal.

I made this for culinary class, and my kitchen used ground Italian sausage and Kroger brand grape jelly, and substituted the breadcrumbs for cornmeal and it tasted great! We used a recipe for copycat Heinz chili sauce though, but it was super easy. We complimented our meatballs with butter/basil tossed spaghetti and parsley leaves :)

I use the chili sauce, but switch out the jelly for whole cranberry sauce.  If you want it a little sweeter, add brown sugar, more sour add vinegar (sparingly). I find the meatballs, at least with this sauce, are better without salt and onion.

I've been making these meatballs for years. I have always used the grape jelly and these meatballs are always a hit when I make them for parties. We also love them for dinner served over white rice.

Classic recipe that is so good. I like using soft breadcrumbs in meatloaf and meatballs. I used grape "all fruit" jelly in the sauce, and it is perfectly sweet and tangy. Instead of using as an appetizer, I served them with steamed white rice for dinner. Yummy!

I am used to making meatballs with grape jelly and decided to try this recipe for a change. It was okay. I found the cranberry to give it a tangy taste which took a little getting used to for me. Think I'll stick to the grape jelly version for now.

This is a easy recipe, and a hit with all the kids too.  I did use grape jelly in place of red currant since that is what I had on hand.

Recipe was great. All meatballs gone. I also tried with turkey and used chunky apples sauce to make moist. They were also a big hit

I used pre-made Turkey Meatballs and used 1/3 Red Currant Jelly and 1/3 Whole Cranberries, canned with the chili sauce.  Delicious!
