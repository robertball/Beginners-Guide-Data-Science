I recently found and fell in love with quinoa and have been making all sorts of dishes with it.  This one did not disappoint!  I wasn't able to find tomatoes I was happy with, so I instead used grape tomatoes.  I also cut the radishes into smaller chunks os that you could get more of everything in each bite.  

I took the salad to my dad's house for a Labor Day bbq this weekend and everybody loved it!  It's really flavorful and refreshing- I wasn't sure how the mint would go with everything, but it really is a perfect blend of flavors.  I will be making it again and again.

I used olive oil instead of sesame oil and fresh basil instead of parsley because that's what I had.  It was fantastic.  I can't wait to have it again in lettuce wraps for an easy lunch.  Such a fantastic fresh recipe.  The raisins were a great sweet touch.

I made this exactly according to recipe, and it's fantastic. I'm glad I didn't veto the raisins which sounded weird or sesame oil. Something about all these things together is magic. Thanks for this recipe.

I was actually a bit too nervous to use the sesame oil for this recipe, so I swapped for olive. I took out the cucumbers and added black beans and a smidge more cumin than was called for. It turned out really good! Would have been good with some fresh summer corn too, to add a little more sweetness.

This was an okay salad, but I had higher expectation for it especially since I love quinoa.  The sesame-cumin-lime combination was odd, and the whole thing was too acidic for me.  On day two I made lettuce wraps of it, and the sweetness of the romaine really helped round out the sharp flavors.  I want to try this with something like fresh strawberries added for a touch of sweet and see what that does.

Wicked good! I added a little cilantro to this and used cherry tomatoes (like others suggested). I also used fewer radishes as I am not a huge fan.  What a refreshing salad with some great flavors!

I feel like there is too much going on in this salad. The only thing I did differently was use celery instead of cucumber; oh, and I cut the radish into smaller pieces. Btw, this recipe says this is four servings - maybe if you're feeding giants!! I have too much leftover after a dinner of ten!

I was really board with plain quinoa and this was just a tasty treat.  It was a lot of work to chop everything up but it was great in the end.

Loved the flavors! The only thing I'll do different next time is add dried cranberries instead of raisins. I added 1/2 of each and loved the bites w/ the cranberries more. Other things I did differently: added onions in w/ TOASTED quinoa & cranberries/raisins, chopped the radishes and cucumbers vs. diced them, used cilantro rather than parsley. I love cilantro and the flavors melded quite nicely. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this again tomorrow when our co-op basket comes w/ yet another large yield of radishes. Oh, yes, this recipe serves 8, not 4 unless it's their main dish.

This salad was delicious!!  I made a few modifications.  I boiled the quinoa with the raisins, onion, and celery (I added this).    I mixed the dressing in a separate container and used just a few dashes of sesame oil, and added olive oil.  I then poured the dressing into the mixture slowly as I mixed it all up.    Delicious!!

The sesame oil threw off the flavor for me especially when combined with cumin.  They just didn't work well together.  Next time I'll change the dressing and maybe use a small red onion (1/4c or so) since the medium onion was such a strong flavor in the salad.

quinoa recipes are still not very common so it was nice to come across a good one. i used golden raisins, sliced my radishes thin (because they are too spicy/bitter for my taste to eat in chunks), and did everything else as directed. as a few others mentioned this recipe is HUGE. i doubled it (because i hadn't read others comments) and it looks like we'll be eating it for days. but that's fine because it is really, really good.

Excellent.  It needed no changes though I did use a combo of regular and red quinoa and it was fine.  Tasted even better though with feta cheese added.  Great the next day.  And the next!

I liked this salad.  I used red quinoa and added some feta as a garnish. Olives might also be good.

This is my favourite quinoa salad.  It's light and flavourful, keeps great for up to 5 days.  A few minor tweaks that I made, I followed everyone's advice and replaced sesame oil with olive oil.  I am not a big fan of raisins in my salad, so I skipped raisins and add feta instead for more protein.  I also cook the quinoa in broth instead of water which I find makes it more flavourful.

This salad was fabulous. I used red quinoa and added cranberries instead of raisins, yellow peppers rather than cucumbers, and canola oil instead of the sesame because that's what I had available. I also sprinkled the toasted almonds on as a garnish so they would stay crunchy. I used sweet campari tomatoes which were spectacular in this salad.

This was a very refreshing and unique summer salad. I don't know why some people felt the need to sweeten. I thought it was perfect as is. I did boil the raisins in with the quinoa which sweetened the quinoa and tasted amazing. All the sweetness I needed. I used golden raisins and olive oil cuz that's what I had on hand. Looking forward to trying again with the sesame oil.
Oh, and I used black quinoa. I prefer black or red quinoa over the white as the white seems to be a little "wet" for a salad.

In the end this recipe was yummy but my boyfriend and I thought the parsley, lime flavor was weird and a little over-powering. Maybe it's just a personal preference or maybe I didn't measure correctly, I'm not sure but it was definitely too strong for us and we both normally like strong flavors. The other thing was that it took a loooong time to to chop everything up. I might try a more simple version next time that involves toasting the quinoa after boiling to bring out that nutty flavor.

I really enjoyed the flavour combination of this dish. If you have ever tried Middle Eastern type of foods like falafels and various sauces that go with this type of cuisine, the lime, sesame oil and mint will not come as too much of a shock here (after reading some reviews.) Tasty and fresh!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I used fresh vegetables from our garden so the tomatoes may have given a slightly different flavor being of the orange variation, not red. I paired it with oven cooked teriyaki marinated chicken that balanced well with the various flavors in this salad. It turned out to be a nice light but filling meal that my guests really enjoyed.

Lots of prep work - as others said, several flavors working together. We liked this recipe and will repeat it but it does need a little salt, and something sweet added.  I tried to add a smidge of sugar and that didn't work.  I think I'll add fresh orange slices next time. I used raisins and we all loved that ingredient. As others suggested, I used fresh basil and fresh mint together.

We really enjoyed this salad. Made it once as written, once with some changes (I much prefer it with the changes, husband liked it either way). I prefer grape tomatoes in this salad. I do think it's important to use red onion rather than yellow (recipe just says "onion"), as the sweet yellow I used on the first go round was way too much. I used half a giant red onion on the second go and was much happier. We also ran out of parsley so we didn't have any the second time, and I didn't think it was a big deal, though would probably be best with the parsley. I will caution that this is a LOT of chopping, which isn't so bad if you're not short on time, or if you've got extra hands. I've mixed a bit of shredded chicken in as well as an after thought and loved it. Lovely recipe, thanks for sharing!

Awesome salad.  I had to make some subs based on what I had on hand.  Used lemon juice instead of lime, no radishes, omitted raisins (not a fan in salads), used basil instead of parsley, no almonds and used olive oil instead of sesame oil.  Flavors were great!

I think there is just waaaayyyyy too much going on in this recipe. You have a lot of ingredients with their own unique and strong flavors but they don't necessarily compliment each other. It was edible, but I wouldn't make it again and honestly ended up throwing out half because I was sick of eating it. Sorry guys. I think the Southwestern Quinoa Salad recipe on a/r is much better.

I didn't have any cucumbers or radishes so I made it with everything else and it was delicious! Loved every bite~ It tastes like a Mediterranean dish. I'm thinking of adding sliced kalamata olives next time.

Love this recipe.   Used dried cherries instead of raisins.   Halved them and added them to the quinoa as it cooked.

One of my favorite quinoa recipes! I did use the full amount of radishes because I had them and I didn't think it was too much even though they're not my favorite. I actually omitted the parsley and added cilantro instead but if you don't like cilantro, stick with the parsley. 

Overall, GREAT recipe.

This was my first quinoa recipe since going gluten free. I thought it was really unique! The flavors actually go together really well and it's very refreshing. Next time I will omit the onions (I used only about a quarter and was still a bit much for me since I am anti-onion). Instead of raisins I used dried cranberries and doubled the amount since I like sweet. I also used the cherry tomatoes, olive oil vs. sesame and dried parsley flakes instead of fresh since I didn't have any.

Yum!

I added celery and carrots and omitted the mint and increased the tomatoes by 1 - good flavor and healthy-but my husband thought it bland.

My palate is not sophisticated enough for this dish. All of the ingredients seem good but together -- ick. 
I would attempt it again with no parsely, mint, onion or radishes.
I just didn't get it.

I really enjoyed and the dressing is the best part.  I used toasted sesame oil in the dressing as it adds depth of flavor.  Also used halved grape tomatoes.

Very tasty and easy.  The 1/2 cup of onion was too overwhelming for me so I left it out the second time I made it.  I also added diced red pepper.  Raisins are a great addition.  Definitely will make this again.

This is a huge hit, even with college boys. I wasn't sure about the radishes and mint, but this combo alongside the lime juice and cumin makes this a refreshing and delicious side dish for any summertime menu! In my latest versions, I tend to omit the cucumbers (since I don't like them) and find that a touch of olive oil works just fine.

I loved this recipe. I reduced the sesame oil to 1 TBSP (I often find it overpowering) and added more raisins and mint - to me, these were the 2 best flavors. It was absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I used the leftovers as dressing for some homemade falafel, which I fried and put into a pita flatbread. It was a nice alternative to the typical cucumber/tomato/onion mixture, and went great with the garlic, mint and sour cream sauce I whipped up on the fly. I would definitely make this salad again.

This was my first time using Quinoa and my husband, dinner guests and I all loved it!
I left out the radishes (I did not have any in the house) and I added feta cheese (1/3 cup). A delicious salad!

You either love this or hate it. 3 of my friends could not get enough but the recipe didn't really impress my palate. However, I added mandarine oranges to sweeten it up, which was taster than the original.

Love the variety of unexpected flavors! I personally would not add as many onions, tomatoes and radishes. And I would add more of the cucumber, mint, parsley, almonds and dressing next time I make it.

I used olive oil instead of sesame oil, lemon juice instead of lime juice, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced fresh tomatoes.  I did not use cumin.  I will definitely make again.  Do not skimp on the mint - it adds hugely to this recipe.

Loved it! So delicious with add-ins like kale, black beans, too. I use 1/2 the sesame oil but used 1/2 evo per my family's tastes.

I made this recipe substituting celery for radishes and lemon juice for lime as that's what I had on hand.  It was very good.  I'll make it again for sure as anything with cumin in it is fine by me.  It definitely makes enough for a crowd.  I'd say 8-10 servings as a side dish.

I added garbanzo beans , jicama and cilantro. Used olive oil instead of sesame.  Lively summer salad.
