I expected these bars to be dry and crunchy and I was going to put them in school lunches.  Instead they are gooey and delicious and I know they won't last until tomorrow! They seem more like dessert than a granola bar to me. I'm going to make another batch to freeze since they came together so quickly.  I left out the coconut and used honey instead of corn syrup.

What a great recipe!  I put a bunch of almonds and walnuts in my bars for extra protein.  These are very versatile bars, you can add just about anything from M & M's to white chocolate chips to dried fruit varieties to candybar pieces.  These bars have now replaced my usual morning breakfast protien bar.  I use honey in place of the corn syrup, they come out wonderful.  For those of you who think this bar is dry, I have found the solution.  Use 1/2 cup butter/margarine instead of 1/3 cup and melt it before you add it.  And bake the bars for 15 minutes instead of 20.  These bars don't have any eggs in them so it's okay to underbake them quite a bit, as they will harden up after a few days of sitting on the counter (if they last that long!)  Thanks for the recipe, it's a good one!

This is a great recipe!  I used all natural crunchy peanut butter and honey instead of corn syrup... it was perfect.  I also skipped the sunflower seeds and used 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. Everyone raved!

ok susbstitutions.... agave nectar instead of brown sugar/corn syrup... it's lower glycemic index (but more expensive) and coconut oil and a bit more nut butter instead of regular butter. Coconut oil burns as energy instead of being stored as fat and can help pull fat from reserves to be used for energy, and i used sunflower butter instead of peanut b/c its much healthier but also more expensive, i also added about a 1/3 c of flax for coagulation (helps stuff stick w/o the butter) and for extra fiber and good fats. used walnuts, sesame seeds, raisins and choc chips as my mix ins.......  they are AMAZING. i have been experiementing w/recipes for awhile and this is by far the best. After i put the mix in a pan i spread some more sun butter on top and then sprinkled go lean crunch (or granola) for some crunch, it was a great add on. and, we have been keeping them in the fridge which somehow makes them even better.

Really great.  I used corn syrup and honey.  Honey alone would work, but I didn't have enough. This is a keeper and NOTHING like a bagged cookie.

These granola bars are very very good,  I dropped the cho. chips and added 1/4 cup of flax seeds and 1/4 cup of sesame seeds instead of the chocolate chips to make them more nutritious.  My husband and two boys love them and they are a great snack anytime.   Thanks

My husband is a coach and I like to send healthy goodies for his athletes to have at their meets.  I have made MANY failed attempts (yes, they were healthy, but were no more then dried out logs of nutrition).  This recipe is a keeper!  To cut back on the fat, I'd omit the coconut (sorry... my fave, too).  I used a low-fat margarine, amlonds instead of sunflower seeds, Hershey's cinnamon chips instead of chocolate and used only 1 1/3 C oatmeal with 2C high protein cereal from Trader Joes.  These were so yummy (even BEFORE baking!) that his athletes were lucky to get any.  Not bad for a quick hunger fix while awaiting an event or for my kids who can be pretty picky!  Thanks, Karen.  These are a keeper.

I really enjoyed these bars. I used 1/2 cup butter, honey instead of corn syrup, and 4 teaspoons of vanilla. I also added some soy protein powder to the mix. The chocolate chips, coconut, sunflower seeds, and raisins were omitted. I added Craisins to my bars. I baked the bars for 15 minutes and they were crumbly at first but the bars hardened by the next day. I will make these again and I was so surprised how good they came out. The next time I bake these bars I will use 3 cups of rolled oats.

Wonderful recipe. Probably would be good no matter what you did!  Due to allergies, and cupboard situation I came up with the following which is Sooo delicious: almost 3/4 c. soy butter for peanut butter, honey for corn syrup, strong brewed coffee for vanila, frosted mini-wheats and multi-grain cheerios (crushed) plus 1c. wheat germ for the rolled oats, no brown sugar, milk-free spreadable margarine for the butter,  no raisins, more choc. chips, no sunflower seeds.  baked for 15 min. Super way to get rid of 'forgotten' cereal in the cupboard!

Sorry to say I wasn't as thrilled with these as others seem to have been.  I did leave out the coconut and sunflower seeds and substituted Sun Maid Dried Fruit Bits for the raisins.  They were easy to make, but I felt they were a little greasy - I don't really think with all the peanut butter and corn syrup there was much reason to grease the pan.  Basically, they are ok if you are looking for a snack you can make healthier than cookies, but nothing I would make again.  My peanut butter loving husband and oatmeal loving toddler aren't interested, so I've got a lot of bars to eat!

I've made these twice this week! They are gooey and delicious, and make a filling snack in between all our afternoon dance/swim/PE classes! I use 1/4 cup honey or agave instead of the corn syrup.

These are great!!! I took the advice of someone and melted the butter...great suggestion. Made it easier to mix. I also used about 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and used 1 cup of dried mixed berries (cranberry, cherries, blueberries). I baked them a little longer, for 30 minutes, so they weren't as soft and were more like a granola bar. FIVE STARS! Love them! I actually made them for my husband who is in the military and wanted something I could send.

Perfect delicious snack treat!!  I made the following changes based on nutrition and what I had on hand: (1) 1-1/4 cup ALMOND BUTTER instead of peanut butter; (2) added 1/3 cup GROUND FLAX SEED - holds it all together, adds wonderful flavor, boosts nutrition; (3) 1/2 cup MARGARINE - Earth/Smart Balance brand; (4) HONEY not corn syrup; (5) 3/4 cup chopped, TOASTED ALMONDS not seeds; (6) extra DARK CHOCOLATE chopped from chocolate bars; (7) dried CRANBERRIES, not raisins; (8) pressed into bottom of two 11 in x 15 in cookie pan (1/2 in high sides); baked each for 12-15 mins; cut into squares on pan while warm; let cool on pan 20 mins then stored in freezer --- result was an amazingly delicious, crunchy, sweet, healthy(-ier than cookies), addictive, satisfying treat that EVERYONE loved!

I haven't tried them because I don't eat raisins but DH said he was disappointed that it was all oatmeal taste and not peanut butter.  It came together fine although I did add the oats 1/2 cup at a time so it would mix easier.  I pressed it into the pan by hand.  I needed to use up some sunflower seeds and I had all the ingredients so I made these and DH will take them to work tomorrow.  I may make them again for the same reason but it isn't likely without some tweaks.  ***Update - DH took these to work yesterday and came home with rave reviews from his coworkers and a request for more.  I guess it is a matter of personal taste.  Maybe the title is not the best since peanut butter doesn't seem to be the predominant taste.

This has a great basis for granola type bars, but has too many "extra" ingredients. I made a batch and felt that it just had too many tastes, but nothing distinctive. Next time I make it I would just use coconut and almonds or chocolate chips and walnuts or rasins and pecans... having too many of these all together was overkill.

These bars are tender, flavoured well and delightful. I  didn't have coconut, so I increased the sunflower seeds. I used mini chocolate chips, and added pecans. The peanut butter is not overwhelming, as I thought it would be. I ran out of light corn syrup, so I substituted some with dark.I know these won't last long around here! Great recipe.

With a few changes these can be a very healthy breakfast/snack. First of all I used honey instead of corn syrup, after that there is no need to add ANY sugar. I also omitted the raisins (just because I'm not big fan of dried fruits) and the chocolate. The coconut gives an amazing flavor, next time I add even more.

these are delicious COOKIE-BARS.  even after adding flax and chopped almonds, i cannot say these resemble granola bars.  that said, they were easy to make and i seem to be making quite a dent in the pan... four stars it is!

These were so good!  I can't wait to make them for the kids again.  Some people are always writing in that they are annoyed when people write their recipe changes in the reviews, but I personally, like it because it gives me ideas of how to make it better for my family.  We omitted the raisins, swapped honey for the corn syrup, and added 1/4 cup flaxseeds.  Some had said it was too sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar slightly - next time I will try 1/4 cup.  Is corn syrup cheaper than honey? For cost savings, maybe I will eventually buy some corn syrup to try.

They were really easy to make.  I also used honey instead of corn syrup and didn't put sunflower seeds (didn't have on hand).  I will say that you really need to let it cool completely or they will crumble. Nice taste and not dry at all.

Great healthy alternative to a chocolate chip cookie.  Like other reviewers, I changed the corn syrup to honey and omitted the brown sugar altogether.  To lower the fat, I mashed half of a small banana and used it to replace half of the butter.  The banana could not even be tasted.  (I used 2 tbsp. of butter and the remainder was the banana.)  I probably could have used all banana and no butter and it would have been just as good.  Add or substract raisins/choc. chips/ coconut, etc. as you prefer.  I added flax meal too.  Chewy, sweet, oaty dessert.

After reading the recipe and all of the reviews I subbed the corn syrup for honey.  The taste was good but I wasn't all that keen on the honey aftertaste.  I felt it was missing the syrup.  I also used a low fat butter substitute which worked well.  Don't think you can buy corn syrup in the UK so the equivalent would be golden syrup which would make these bars "flap jacks" rather than granola bars.  To be honest - if you are adding raisins and chocolate and lots of sweet extras you could cut out the sugar all together and not miss it.

These were super delicious eventhough I made a few changes. I replaced the corn syrup with honey, didn't use the sesame seeds because I didn't have them and omitted the chocolate chips, but added extra raisins. I cut them into granola bar length, wrapped them individually for an easy on the go breakfast! I will definately make these again! Oh I also crunched up about 1/3 cup of peanuts because my husband loves them. It gave them a crunchier texture!

Very good flavour, so easy and fast to make.  I used maple sugar instead of corn syrup and added walnuts and choc.chips.  You could add whatever you want to the recipe and it will turn out great.  Will make again.  Allow to cool completley before eating.

These are great, and I make them often. I live at about 5,000 ft so they were crumbly the first time I made them. I added an egg the next time, and they turned out much better. My kids request them often and I happily oblige.

I have made some oatmeal breakfast cookies very similar to this recipe, but was glad to see that they can also be baked as bars. I wanted something a little more toddler friendly, so I made some substitutions for ingredients that are in my breakfast cookies. I used honey instead of corn syrup and omitted the brown sugar. My cookie recipe uses bananas, but I did not have any to add today. So I used applesauce instead of butter. I also added half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cinnamon. I left out the coconut and crushed some sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds. They are not really like granola bars at all, but they were absolutely delicious! I like it better with the applesauce than with the bananas.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!  These are so yummy. Made as recipe as it  said except I had to omit the sunflower seeds and coconut, only because I didn't have any on hand.  Can hardly wait to make them again with them.  These are fabulously delicious and addicting!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, have been looking for a soft granola type bar forever.  Take care in your baking time, as always.  Mine were done in about 18 minutes

These are excellent!  They do make a wonderful afternoon snack, too, and one I consider so much more healthy than packaged foods.  I also tried it with 1/4 cup peanut butter flavored chips (and cut back the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup), and they were so good! Thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe is great just how it is written.  I just left out raisins the first time I made them because I personally don't like them much and I didn't have any.  They turned out great!! Since then I have experimented with adding in other ingredients to change up the flavors.  So far the favorite in my house is to put walnuts in instead of raisins, and use butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.  This is a great base recipe that can be changed to fit everyone's tastes.

4 1/2 stars...these are really good. Mine were a bit crumbly. I probably should have patted them down. I put them in the freezer & then cut them & that helped. Added some flax seed & applesauce..and a small handful of pecans.

Really really good!  I added chocolate chips too soon, so they melted and made the bars quite dark.  However, they still tasted really good!  Note to self: add chocolate chips after things have cooled down.

These bars were AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe, used honey instead of corn syrup, omitted the coconut and raisins.  Spread into 12" x 17" pan, baked 25 minutes.  Made 27 bars!

I made a few changes and my kids LOVE these. I use almond butter instead of peanut butter and replace the corn syrup with agave, and add ground flaxseed. They are perfect for school lunches and I take them to swim meets for my kids. They are soft, chewy, delicious and pretty healthy too.

My kids and husband liked these.  I just thought the peanut butter taste was a little on the rich side and it was a little too sweet for my tastes.  The only change I made was replacing the corn syrup with honey...just because I had some honey to use up and had no corn syrup.  Don't know if that made a difference.

These were yummy! I was looking for something that had PB and oats since I had lots of both in my pantry and came across this one! I easily had all the ingredients. I don't like nuts or raisins in my baked goods so I eliminated those and cut the recipe in half. Perfect 8 2x3" bars! I also used mini morsels and served warm and with ice cold milk!

The best thing about this recipe is you can use whatever you have. I wasn't looking for substitutions, but I was also looking to save a trip to the store. Didn't have raisins, but I had dried cranberries. Didn't have sunflower seeds, but I had flax seeds. The base is perfect for any of your favorite snacks. A recipe box must-have!

These are excellent. I wanted a different granola bar than my usual one. I came across this one and since I have a ton of PB it was perfect. I did change it up just a little bit. I used 1/2 honey and 1/2 corn syrup, left out sunflower seeds and the raisins, family doesn't like raisins, so I subbed walnuts and banana chips. These were definitely a hit with the family. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a half sheet pan.  I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it as written, but used honey instead of corn syrup.  Next time will try it with crunchy PB, Craisins or dried cherries to offset some of the sweetness and toss in some Chia seeds.  Will allow the bars to chill in the fridge to get a firmer consistency.

Didn't have Sunflower seeds, and used old fashioned oats instead. Added almonds and as others stated used honey instead of cario syrup.  They are in the oven at this moment. I can't wait to try them. Thanks for the added info everyone.

These were okay, don't know how often I would make these again.  I followed the recipe exactly other than using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips, and chocolate chips would have been better I'm sure.  These were alright, they were fine, just nothing crazy special for me.

Perfect chewy granola bar recipe!  They actually hold together unlike other recipes I've tried.  I replaced the PB with almond butter due to my 3 yr old son's allergy & dislike to peanuts, and he loves them.  Other changes I made with great results:1/2 c sucanat for brown sugar, 1/3 c. agave syrup for corn syrup, 1/4 c. butter + 1/3 c. flax meal for butter, 1/2 c. craisins for raisins, and omitted choc chips.  Pressed firmly in a parchment lined 10x14 baking pan and cooked 12-15 mins at 350 F. Very versatile recipe, too.

These reminded me of the no-bake cookies minus the cocoa.  If you underbake them slightly they are soft, bake them a little too long and you have granola, either way the taste is very, very good! I only used oats, my younger kids don't care for nuts.

Great! Very rich though. I also substituted corn syrup for an agave and honey mixture. I also used 1/2 cup flax, and omitted raisins. Definitely make sure to cool completely before cutting, as they'll just fall apart on you!

I followed this recipe exactly except I left out the raisins because I didn't have any. They turned out great! Chewy but not mushy. Very tasty! This is also a recipe you could easily change to your individule taste. A keeper for sure!

Yumm. This is like a giant cookie. If you are looking for a healthy granola bar, I would suggest using honey instead of corn syrup, but I followed the recipe exactly. The oats, nuts, and raisins do add nutritional value. These bars are soft and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a versatile recipe. I made the following revisions with excellent results:
Substitute corn syrup with ¼ cup honey and four packets of Splenda. I increased butter to ½ cup and used a heaping cup of natural peanut butter. I added ¼ cup bran; ¼ cup almond meal; ½ cup finely chopped prunes; ½ cup peanut butter chips. I omitted the coconut. After I pressed the batter into the pan, I sprinkled a mixture of peanut butter and chocolate chips on top and pressed them into the batter.
I also lined my pan with parchment paper for ease of removal after baking… 
The most important thing for me was to wait until these cooled sufficiently prior to cutting so they don’t crumble.
On occasion I’ve loaded these up with chopped nuts as well as nut meal (ground nut meat); freshly ground flaxseeds; and soy protein in an attempt to increase nutritional content. Any and all dried fruit works well in these bars. The addition of chocolate or peanut butter chips makes these much richer and makes them taste as good as any cookie, but it also provides nutrition as well.

This was a great snack. I omitted the sunflower seeds and I added Peanut butter chips in addition to the choco-chips and used chunky peanut butter. I took other's advice and baked for about 18 minutes, very moist. One thing I would be careful to do next time around is store in airtight container as opposed to covered in foil, it did dry out quickly. Delish snack that even my kids gobbled up :O)

These turned out really well!  I read what other people said about them falling apart, so I put a little extra peanut butter (about 1/4 cup), a little less oatmeal, and only used chocolate as an extra.  (I used 2 big bars of hershey's dark chocolate I cut up into chunks - can't got wrong with giant chunks of chocolate in anything.)  I also pressed it down after it cooked to make sure it was nice and compacted before I cut it up so it wouldn't fall apart.  I couldn't consider this recipe anywhere near healthy, but it was definitely tasty!

Very yummy!! I used honey like others instead of corn syrup. I left out the sunflower seeds and added a touch more coconut & raisins. I also used crunchy peanut butter. I baked mine for 18 minutes and they are nice and moist. This is my new snack recipe as I seem to always have these ingredients on hand!!

These are awesome!!  I also use flax seeds, seseme seeds, walnuts, raisins, wheatgerm, coconut and whatever I find in my cupboards to equal the two cups as called for which makes them extra healthy for my family.  They won't fall apart if you let them set until they are completely cooled, then they slice nicely, they are great!!

SUPERB! Very moist and yummy!  I used natural crunchy peanut butter.  Honey instead of corn syrup.  2&1/3c rolled oats and 1c wheat germ instead of 3&1/3c rolled oats.  Almonds instead of sunflower seeds.  This was a big hit with everyone.
Thanks, Hossless

My sons LOVE these bars! They are very easy to make. They did tend to be a little dry, so next time I will add either more butter or more peanut butter. Like another review said I also added craisins instead of raisins and almonds instead of sunflower seeds.  I also didn't add coconut since my family doesn't like that much. That could possibly be why they tasted a bit dry. These are great! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yummy!  I found this recipe & wanted to try it.  My husband couldn't wait for me to make it, so he prepared it himself.  He made it exactly as the recipe was written, no variations.  They turned out super.  The texture was perfect & the flavor...so good.  We'll definitly make these again, maybe trying some different add-ins.

Delicious! I used chopped peanuts instead of sunflower seeds. Very easy to make. Next time I might cut back on the brown sugar and chocolate chips a bit as the bars were a little on the sweet side for me. It should be fun to experiment with different ingredients.

These are so great. I omit raisins and sunflower seeds, and add only chocolate chips. Crunchy peanut butter makes them even better - I was low on corn syrup once so I used part honey, and that was fantastic, too. I'm in college, and my roommate and friends always eat these FAST.

I use a 15 oz jar of no stir natural crunchy peanut butter, 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and 2-3 tablespoons of cocoa. Dump all these in a large ceramic bowl that i place on the keep warm burner of the stove for a couple minutes (instead of using the microwave). Add in 3.5 cups of oats (quick or old fashioned) a couple teaspoons of flax seeds, handful of  dark chocolate chips, mix it all with a large spoon, dump it in a brownie pan lined with plastic wrap, level and refrigerate for about 1-2 hours, Cut it up on squares and wrap them individually, keep them in the fridge and use instead of store bought bars.

Chewy goodness. I used honey instead of corn syrup and dried cranberries instead of raisins. I’d lessen the brown sugar next time, as my peanut butter and berries were sweet. A keeper for the recipe box.

I always follow a new recipe exactly the first time around.  The fact that I had to turn over the stirring chore to my Lady warned me that the mix was simply too dry (I have a huge tendinitis problem.  I know, WAAAH).  The bars came out very stiff and very crumbly.  Oh, and they were delicious!  We will eat the piles of debris with a spoon if necessary and I will likely adjust the amount of oats next time.

What a good base for a granola bar. Dump the corn syrup for honey and molasses .  Use a bit of coconut oil too.

really good but very sweet-more like dessert, could make with less honey (1/4c) and unsweet coconut. I added flaxseeds. Cooked 20 min, were pretty gooey but set up once in fridge. Keep in fridge.

These came out delicious! I'm in Australia and didn't have corn syrup so I substituted golden syrup instead.  I used about 25% more peanut butter and added probably 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 1/2 cup pecans-- which I put in a fry pan for 2 minutes to toast before using.  Due to adding the nuts, I only used 2.5 cups oats, as I didn't want it to be too dry. Also used roasted salted pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower seeds and added a cup of reese's peanut butter chips. Baked for 20 minutes with fan forced oven (that's what they call convection in Australia) as I wanted them to stay soft and chewy, and that worked out perfectly. I think you can just add or omit what you've got on hand! Very yummy.

These were awesome! The only change I made was I used light corn syrup to hold down on the sweetness. Thank you very much for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

I used uncooked whole oats, the bars were a little dry. I will try again with quick oats or adding more peanut butter.

Very good! - I substituted butter for 1/4 cup of the peanut butter, didn't have any wheat germ - added crushed almonds and M&M's instead of choc chips and added some peanuts...in my opinion - the coconut adds a lot of flavor so I would not leave it out.

I made this exactly as stated in recipe, and was shocked at how mushy they were. After an hour or thereabouts they were still mushy and had a rather difficult time cutting them into smaller pieces. I would have to say that with the amounts of butter plus the peanut butter, the other dry ingredients didn't help to keep these molded together enough. I will have to try this again and experiment with the ingredients

This was so good. I used honey instead of corn syrup, and unsweetened applesauce instead of margarine. I also omitted the coconut, seeds, and raisins, but I added 1/2 cup of roasted salted almonds, crushed. Came out nice and moist. Yum!

A very good, very quick treat when you need more than just sweets to eat.  I made these with a few changes, mainly adding raisins, and sesame seeds as others suggested, but they are delicious.  I live in Guatemala and can't find granola bars except in Walmart, and they are filled with sugar and artificial ingredients, so these are a real change for friends here.  Next time I want to try them with molasses and spices for a change of pace, and toss in some apples.  Can't wait.

Well I can't lie, I switched it up. I was desperately looking for some sort of treat that didn't have eggs and this is what I found! I used honey instead of corn syrup and didn't add coconut, raisins, or sunflower seeds. Just because I didn't have them! They were still KILLER!

I wish I would have not listened to the last part of this recipe and rather have let them cool in the pan. I'd have just cut and served from the pan. Instead it was difficult and a little awkward removing  them and they did not hold up well. To say the least. 
Other than that they taste pretty good. Still waiting to completely cool. I added mini chocolate chips and craisins everything else was as written.  Quick and easy.

These were very good but a little dry and crumbly. I think this was my fault because I used old fashion oats instead of roll oats . I will be making them again because they are delicious, easy to make, and good for you. I am going to make my grandkids a batch next week when I get some polled oats!

These are great! My kids love to grab them to eat on the way to school since we never have time for a leisurely breakfast. I have made them just as the original recipe reads and have changed things with new add ins like pumpkin seeds, flax or caramel chips. Every time they turn out great! Much better than other granola bar recipes I have tried.

I'm on a quest for the perfect granola bars. These aren't bad, but they aren't the ultimate bar. My guests enjoyed them but my family (who has tasted many other homemade granola bars) felt they were too crumbly, the peanut butter was overwhelming (these stick to the roof of your mouth), and they're sickly sweet. 
If you do make them, cut the sugar,  use honey instead of corn syrup, cut back on the peanut butter, and toss in 1/3 c. flax for extra nutrients.

This was super easy to make but somehow I screwed up.  I must have left it in the oven too long because it was so crumbly that it would fall apart after one bite.  I used fresh coconut and it dominated the flavor so much that the peanut butter flavor wasn't evident in the least.  I may try this again sans coconut and cook for a shorter time.

I made these a few times theyre amazing the only thing I changed was omitting corn syrup and using instead 10 packets of sweet and low a dash of very hot water and a half of a teaspoon of hobey mixed together to serve as corn syrup. I don't have corn syrup and thought sweet and low would be healthier. They come out soft and chewy great recipe.

These were incredibly easy and tasty!  Hubby loves granola bars and we've just gone gluten free, making our own bars is a no-brainer.  I did a simple substitution of agave in place of the corn syrup.   I added dried cherries and cranberries in place of raisins and I tossed in some crisp rice cereal for lightness and crunch.   I was heavy handed with the coconut and sunflower seeds, adding a bit more than the recipe.  I'll be using this recipe again, I'm  planning on using some almond butter and cinnamon next time!  And maybe add pumpkin seeds! Or dried apples, craisins and cinnamon!

These bars are terrific.... I did not add the coconut or sunflower seeds, because my husband does not like them. Well this is now his Favorite Bar. And I shared them with our Wal-Mart family and they were a Big hit.

Really yummy and super easy!  Love the chewiness of them. I have made it a couple times and each time I've changed the "add-ins" to the basic base because I didn't have the original recipe ingredients on hand. Dried sour cherries and almonds one time, dates and walnuts the other time. Very versatile to give different flavors. Love it! Thank You for sharing :o)

I love this!  I omitted coconut and raisins just because I don't like them. Everything else was the same. Getting ready to make them again!

This was delicious and so easy! I had oatmeal sitting in the cupboard that I needed to get rid of and I'm so glad I found this recipe! I was going for more of a dessert-type bar so I used 2 cups milk chocochips. I also used chunky peanut butter. Next time, I'll try using honey instead of the corn syrup like other reviewers have suggested, just to switch it up. They did cool to be a bit crumbly, but I stuck them in the fridge and now they're chewy and perfect. My whole house smelled like peanut butter while they were in the oven! Mmmm! :)

I followed the recipe exactly.  After reading reviews about too little filling, I was sure to use the blender, as recommended in the original recipe. The original also calls for just an 8x8 square pan.  The original recipe has plenty of filling if you follow the exact directions.  However, something went dreadfully wrong.  My lemon bars tasted like salty scrambled eggs.  Yuck.  The crust was good...like a tea cookie.  But the filling was just all wrong.  I'll have to try it again.

Absolutely awesome! I substituted honey for the corn syrup, I used organic natural pb, pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower seeds, and I topped it with crushed pecans and graham cracker crumbs. They came out Delish!

This was great. I used coconut oil instead of butter. I didn't have any coconut flakes or chocolate chips, so I used sliced almonds and chopped walnuts instead. Reading about substitutions helps me when I just don't have some of the listed ingredients, and don't want to WASTE money going to the store to buy things when I can just substitute. I am not an expert cook, and depend on recipes and the reviews to help me along in the kitchen. Allrecipes is a community where users help each other.

Made these pretty much as written, minor changes and they turned out great. I used fresh ground peanut butter to cut some of the sugar and cut back on the butter to about 2 tablespoons. I found the consistency was a little too gooey, so this gave me the opportunity to add more stuff. What can be bad in that?! So I used these additions: unsweetened wheat puff cereal, Rice Krispie cereal, wheat germ, more oats, chia seeds and I also did not have sunflower seeds on hand so I substituted raw pepitas. I just added about 1 cup or so more of each dry cereal until the consistency was crumbly, not gooey. In past experience, everything is better roasted, and oats, nuts, the coconut flakes and the cereals all benefit from this. I just dumped everything out on 2 jelly roll pans prior to adding the wet ingredients and put them in a 300 degree oven, stirring every 7 minutes or so until I could smell the nuts getting 'nutty'. This greatly added to the flavor with minimum effort. Obviously these could be adapted to individual tastes, and what you have on hand. I didn't use raisins because I'm not a fan. And great for kids...my 18 month old is crazy about these!

What a great homemade energy bar! So tasty for a snack! I buy energy bars like crazy because I'm very active and get low blood sugar easily, and these seem much healthier with no weird "fillers" or odd oils. Plus, hopefully more economical. I made the recipe basically the way it is, with substitutions for what I had on hand, plus added 1T ground flax to the dry ingredients and 3T apple juice to the wet ingredients to help it hold together (it's an egg equivalent and has lots of omega3). Here are my reasonable substitutions which don't deviate much from the original in taste or texture: I used honey for corn syrup, coconut sugar for brown sugar, instant steel cut oats for rolled oats, half organic earth balance buttery spread and half coconut oil for butter, and roughly chopped walnuts for sunflower seeds. (For variety in your bars, I think you could substitute just about any dried fruit and any nut/seed for sunflower seeds.) I gently heated the butter/oil in a sauce pan, then added honey, sugar, peanut butter, vanilla, and juice, stirring with each addition. I baked it in two round tart dishes so the corners wouldn't be too brown, as I noticed that problem in some of the pictures. It was on the sweet side for my taste, but that's probably my fault, as corn syrup is less sweet than honey. Maybe brown rice syrup might be a better sub. Corn syrup also doesn't burn as easily, but honey helps preserve food. I'll also probably use rolled oats next time instead of instant steel cut.

It was good.  I used crushed pecans and cashews as I did not have sunflower seeds and my husband does not like raisins. Very good.  A bit crumbly to eat but still good.  I will try it with Agave Nectar next time though so I can make it a bit healthier.

These were OK. I couldn't taste the coconut. The peanut butter over powered them, and they were a hair on the sweet side. Granola is so easy to "tweak", so can use this as a starter, but I have an "old stand-by" I'll stick to. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! 

I did use honey in lieu of corn starch. I also didn't have any sunflower seeds, so I used flax seed instead. 

Very tasty and gooey-can be messy so eat with a napkin so you don't drop crumbs everywhere! I thought they would need more chocolate, but it's perfect! 

Hubby doesn't like coconut, but ate these up and didn't even know there was any in there until I told him. 

Next time I'll add some almonds too.

These are great! I made them with all the ingredients listed but then added some sliced almonds that I had leftover in the cupboard. Amazing flavor and texture. I love the versatility that this recipe will allow in that you can substitute cranberries for raisins, nuts for sunflower seeds, etc. My husband is a runner and is always looking for wholesome snacks. These bars fit the bill! I make many baked treats from this site and very few have disappointed. Thanks again for another winner.

Really yummy recipe!  Only made some changes, as others suggested, used honey instead of corn syrup and for personal taste omitted the coconut, sunflower seeds & raisins.  Added 1 cup of chocolate chips instead.  Great starter recipe to personalize and use your favorite ingredients.  Will be making this one many more times!

Put in two cups of mini marshmallows instead of the other ad-ins. Can you say fluffer-nutter? :) Edited to add: Used no add-in and put in 1 extra cup of oats. Used honey instead of corn syrup. I never cook these to 25 minutes because the edges get dark and the darkened edges don't taste as good. These are a big hit!

Love this bar, to make it healthier ,I used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup and 1/4 more cup of organic brown sugar, perfect! I also baked them only 19 min. For a nice soft chewy bar!

These flapjacks are amazing! I used golden syrup instead since corn syrup isn't sold in the UK. I also skipped the raisins, flaked coconut and sunflower seeds in favour of milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. It's a really simple recipe that makes moist, chewy flapjacks with all the peanut-butter flavour everyone loves.

I made these yesterday after making the no bake PB balls since they both have the same main ingredients.  As of this morning, there are only 4 bars left.  They taste better than any store bought granola bar you can buy.  These are very filling and will definately satisfy any sweet craving.  I followed the instructions and ingredients and only excluded what I didnt have.  I did substitute flaxseed for the coconut because I didnt have coconut.     It would definitely be easy to make these more nutricious by making a few changes.  You could easily cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 1/2.  You can also cut the butter in half and add 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  Lastly, you can eliminate the chocolate chips or substitute golden raisins, dates, currants, or another dried fruit.

I also used honey instead of corn syrup. They turned out great. Butterscotch chips too. No coconut. I'll try the flax and sesame seeds next time. This is such and easy, quick, somewhat healthy snack!

I substituted molaesses for corn syrup for a slightly more heathly bar. The molasses did not overpower the taste (as molasses can), but added sweetness. These bars are great.

Awesome!  Followed the advice of others, substituted honey for corn syrup; no coconut, used what was on hand-almonds, rasians and crasians too; very addictive!

Uh Oh, too yummy!  I substituted honey for the syrup and used pecans instead of seeds because that is what I had.  I will add wheat germ and a little salt next time.  I used a natural peanut butter without salt and I think it could use just a touch.  Hmm, maybe not - pretty darn good. . . A good home-made snack for my kids' lunches - and my New Year's resolution of dropping the packaged foods.

Didn't use raisins, sunflower seeds or coconut.  Used applesauce in place of corn syrup and some of the butter.
A strong base recipe! :)

The batter alone for these is delicious so i know the finished product will be as well!
i followed what others had suggested and added honey instead of corn syrup and i melted the 1/2 butter too.
i didn't use sunflower seeds since i didn't have on hand. just added extra golden raisins, chocolate chips and some chopped walnuts.
Sooooo good and VERY easy!!!

These are delicious.  I did not use corn syrup either but used brown rice syrup.  This tastes more like a cookie since it is so sweet.  I think the next time I make them, I'll half the brown sugar and the brown rice syrup.

these bars are great! I have taken them to several sports tournament and the whole team loves them.  I did cut back the oatmeal to 3 cups.  Even people who don't like raisins or coconut loved them.
Thanks for a great recipe!

i don't know what i did wrong but mine was so dry it was not 'bars' it was more like granola. however i will try it again b/c it tasted amazing! i used cranberries & mini chips instead of the coconut, etc (just what i had at home). Can't wait to try again sometime, hopefully they will turn into bars next time.

Very good.  I did substitute honey for the corn syrup like some other reviewers suggested.  I also am not crazy about raisins so I used cherry flavored dried cranberries instead and they were great.

Very yummy, although I too substituted honey for corn syrup and skipped the sunflower seeds and coconut in favor of raisins and walnuts so they would give us some energy on our hiking trips. I agree that they are hard to cut so that they don't fall apart. I score them once they've cooled for a little while, but don't try to cut them for at least 5 or 6 hours. I'm sure someone more skilled and patient could get it to work for them though.

Good snack!  I will use pecan next time instead of the sunflower seeds.  I left out the coconut (only because I discovered I didn't have any) and it was definately sweet enough without it.  I'll cut back a little on the oats next time and add a little almond extract instead of vanilla.  Worth making!  Kids loved it!

GRANtastic! my hubby loooves these. I put them in his cooler for lunches and he snacks on them when he wants a sweet treat. Easy as can be and like the others I opted to leave the sunflower seeds out.This recipe is so versatile that I'm able to sub the rolled oats with half quick-cooking and add wheat bran and crushed hibre fibre cereals for the total amount of oats for more nutrition and crunch.I keep them in the fridge in a tupperware...they stay chewy and crunchy!Because i make them so often now, i have found that buying the ingredients at bulk foods stores are a better buy. Will never buy pre-packaged again ...Thank-you soooo munch ;)

These were a hit with all my kids (6)!!  I didn't have sunflower seeds so we made them with extra raisens and chocolate chips.  My 10 year old made the first batch so it is a kid-friendly recipe, just supervise the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

These were fabulous! I took the other reviewers' advice and left out the sunflower seeds. I also left out raisins and added more chocolate chips. The peanut butter really held the granola bar together after I cut the bars. I will definitely make these again.

The recipe sounded wonderful.  They were good, the only change I would make
would be omitting the sunflower seeds, I noticed everyone eating them spitting out the seeds!
