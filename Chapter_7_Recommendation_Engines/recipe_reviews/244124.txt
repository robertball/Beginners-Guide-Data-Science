Delicious! I used this as a marinade for chicken to make chicken salads with and marinated the chicken overnight...perfect! Not too spicy, but just enough to make the flavor pop...a definite keeper~YUM! thanks for sharing. :)

Basic, but always good to have a quick "go to" recipe.

11.9.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/244124/kickin-chicken-marinade/ ... If I'd made a better Italian dressing, I might like this better.  It wasn't spicy at all.  Maybe zesty dressing would help with that.  K , 17, liked it; E, 19, went back for seconds.  Ohhhh, I did change a bit; but not the marinade.  I coated i4 blsl breast halves with 1/2c  plain breadcrumbs mixed with 1/2t cayenne & 1/2t salt. so yes, the coating was a bit spicy, but the chicken itself wasn't.
