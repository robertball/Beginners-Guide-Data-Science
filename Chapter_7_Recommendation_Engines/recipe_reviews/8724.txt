Really good basic.  For those of you wanting a little more "tang" try this:  to the basic mixture add 2 T rice vinegar, 2 T soy or teriyaki sauce, 1 t garlic, 1 t spicy mustard.  Taste the sauce before you add the raw chicken and adjust to suit your taste.  My kids love it either way.  You just can't go wrong with this recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I used French dressing because I couldn't find Russian.  My husband loved it and asked me to add this to our recipe rotation.

Tangy and tasty. I made my own Russian dressing with equal part ketchup and mayo, a bit of lemon juice and some parsley. I poured it over whole chicken pieces and baked at 375 for about an hour. This was a hit with both hubby and the kids.

This recipe is excellent.  I've used chicken thighs instead of breasts, marmalade instead of apricot, and I've tried it in the slow cooker.  It always comes out fantastic!

Great recipe. I've made this quite a few times now and it's always a hit. Now I have my friend making it for her family too. The kids love it.

So tasty and easy, too.  I didn't have Russian dressing, so I used Thousand Island instead.  The chicken turned out very moist.  I used the remaining sauce over rice pilaf and served dinner with sweet corn.  My picky husband ate it which merits a rave review.  I only gave it 4 stars because my kids thought it had too much onion and my 3 year old wouldn't eat it at all.  Next time, I'll cut down on the onion soup mix.

My sister-in-law has been making this for years and she was kind enough to share it with me -- it's a colorful, tasty recipe that's good enough for company. Spoon the chicken and sauce over white rice and serve with mixed veggies and a green salad. I always have the ingredients in my pantry. Use it for pork chops too!

This was delicious, though I think next time, I'll use more apricot preserves. For the russian dressing, I used Thousand Island. Everyone thought I was super creative, so thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delish, both me and my husband agree.  It does make A LOT of sauce.  You could easily half the ingredients for the sauce.

YUM! I added a splash of vinegar (to combat the sweetness, like over reviewers stated) and a hefty pinch of red pepper flakes. It doesn't look creamy at all after its cooked- it was just like sweet and sour sauce from Chinese places. Thanks! Hubby loved it, too.

I was hit with unexpected company and time was running into the dinner hour.  I had a whole cut-up chicken, onion soup mix, French dressing (not Russian) and orange marmalade (not apricot preserves) so I gave it a go.  My guests thought I was a gourmet chef!  I served it with rice and canned green beans (all I had on hand) and everyone raved!  Thank you Lisa for a super simple and delicious recipe!

This was soooo easy and so delicious!! I'm trying to watch my weight so I used sugar free apricot preserves (used regular dressing because I couldn't find lite / low fat) but I didnt use as much as the recipe called for.  I really can't believe how simple and delicious this was. There was lots of extra sauce so I made brussel sprouts on the side and believe it or not they tasted delicious in the extra sauce!

I did not care for this recipe, It was just "OK".  My boyfriend liked it, but I didnt think that the flavors and the chicken blended too well together.  I tasted the sauce before i put it over the chicken and I thought it tasted kind of weird, but I thought it would meld into something better, but I was wrong.  I will eat this if I had no other options, but I would not plan to make this again.

This recipe was pretty good!  It was pretty sweet, but I love sweet stuff.  There was a lot of sauce left over, so I would serve it over rice.  I also added a little soy sauce to balance out the sweet and make it a little more salty.  I would for sure cook this again!

Awesome!! That's what my husband said about it.  I cut the sauce in half and used a lb. of chicken and still had enough sauce.  Not only does this taste great but it is sooo easy.  Thanks.

Great easy recipe.  
I use the bottle of dressing, the onion soup mix, and about 1/2 of an 18oz jar of apricot preserves.  This makes it a bit sweeter.
I cut the chicken into cubes and let them marinade in the sauce.  Cook for about an hour at 350.  I then take out some of the sauce and heat it on the stove w/ some cornstarch to make a gravy.

I serve over rice.  Both my young children and my husband LOVE this meal.  Has become one of our staples!

This would have gotten four stars had my husand liked it... he just thought it was OK.  It is very easy to make, but his complaint is that it really didn't add anything to the chicken.

This was great! I added some green pepper and sliced onion to the mix and it came out YOMmy. Definitely tangy and almost too sweet for me, so maybe i'll go easier on the preserves next time. But awesome, super-easy recipe.

I make a similar recipe. 8oz bottle russian dressing, can whole cranberries (like for thanksgiving), jar pineapple-apricot preserves, packet onion soup mix. Combine & pour over 6 chicken breasts. Bake 350 for 90 minutes. Best. chicken. ever. Serve with mashed potatoes to soak up all the gravy goodness.

I made this for my family last night and it was delicious!  Didn't realize Russian Dressing would be so hard to find.  I used French instead.  I baked it with sliced pinapples on top.  Very yummy!

I'm definately making this again.  It's rare to get recipes this easy yet this delicious.  I used Thousand Island dressing because I didn't have Russian and chicken breast w/bone and skin because that was what I had.  I also left it in the oven for a full hour just to make sure it was cooked through.  It still turned out very juicy.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I actually tweaked it a bit though.  I added 1/2 apricot preserves and 1/2 pinapple preserves.  It was great.  Thanks Lisa!

Have seen this recipe called "gooey" chicken. Is easy and delicious....I made with about 3 lbs chicken drumsticks & thighs (or whatever chicken parts you prefer).  Increase cook time for bone-in chicken.

I liked this. I thought it was different but good. My husband did not care for this. I think it was to sweet for him.

It was quick and easy to prepare which I like but I don't think it was great. It was all right though. Not bad by any means. The only change to the recipe I made was to use a sugar-free apricot marmalade mixed with some orange marmalade just because I already had that in the fridge. There was way too much sauce - it could have been cut at least in half for 6 chicken breasts. Do they have light Russian dressing? It would be nice to cut some of the calories...

I love this recipe.  Very easy, everyone, and the kids love it.  I add red bell peppers and carrots and serve over rice.

This was a really easy and tasty dish.  It was something I was able to throw together and put in the oven and not worry about till it was done, and then I felt bad when my family told me how great it was because I didn't really do much work.  The sauce was great over the rice, and the chicken did a great job of complimenting the vegatables I made.  I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a great recipe. My 18 month old who hates meat just gobbled this right up. I reduced the sauce and thickened it with cornstarch and it was a hit! I'm def making again!!

This is my favorite! My mom has been making this for years, and she got the recipe from her mom! But in my family, we've always called it "Gooey Chicken".

Me and the misses Loved this recipe but i did make a few changes to it, these are as follows:-
5floz of BAXTERS FRENCH ONION SOUP (CAN) and 5floz FRENCH DRESSING both of which we found in our local summerfields..cooked the chicken and sauce together in a large pan due to the amount of sauce but reduced this to about half then if neccessary added a mix if 1tsp of CORNFLOUR with 1tsp of WATER to thicken the sauce.Reduce further if you like.. served with rice

I prefer to make this with chicken thighs--they're juicier than boneless/skinless breasts, and way cheaper!

Very good! Subbed a 16 oz bottle of French dressing for Russian. Placed chicken breasts in slow cooker and poured mixture over. Served over white rice.
