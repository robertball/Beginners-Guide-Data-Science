This recipe is a fair amount of work if you slice all of your veggies and shred your potatoes and cheese, and you will have quite a cleanup to do.  As I always do with shredded potatoes, I filled my salad spinner with water, put in the potatoes, gave them a good whirl, emptied the water, and then spun them again to get the water out.  There is a typo in this recipe which says to bake for “...55 hours” (assuming that should be 55 minutes)...sent a note to AR customer service.   I didn’t understand what purpose it served sprinkling on just a little more cheese at the end and then baking for another 5 minutes, so I put it all on when it first went into the oven.   I baked for a total of 55 minutes, and it was just a little dry; would start checking at about 45 minutes in the future.  No complaints about the taste, it was good, but it’s too much work for a weekday side dish.

This sounds good and would like to try it, but this is Not an authentic Lithuanian Kugeli Casserole recipe which I've made for....well, all my life. My grandfather came over from Lithuania with my great-grandmother's recipe that I still make. I'll post it soon. Until then, I'm gonna give this recipe a chance because it's different and sounds good! Oh, do not drain the shredded potatoes, Kugeli needs the potato moisture/liquid so the casserole doesn't dry out while cooking.
