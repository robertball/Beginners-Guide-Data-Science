I made this recipe exactly as written, but mine didn't come out looking so great. I chilled for about 5 hours, but upon scooping and rolling them for the baking sheet, they warmed slightly, and as soon as they went into the oven they started to spread. Eventually they baked up semi-flat, with light golden bottoms and crispy edges. Even so, the flavor was really good, even after a week they were still soft and buttery. They would also be great with almond extract instead of the vanilla.

AWESOME cookies!  They are a shortbread type of cookie with the tops dipped in melted white chocolate and sprinkled with crushed candy canes.  I started out making just half a batch, as I was not sure how they would turn out...  loved them SO much that I am making another batch!  I rolled into smaller balls, maybe 1/2 inch balls so that I could make more....  I also adjusted the cooking time since I made them smaller, I think 15 minutes and I started checking them....  a light, light brown on the bottom tasted best..... Also, I refrigerated the dough overnight and it was rock-hard, so you have to allow at least 30 minutes to thaw before rolling into balls.

These are just like Mexican wedding cake cookies except they aren't rolled in powdered sugar. I'm thinking I'll try to find a different type of cookie to use the crushed peppermint candies on. Thanks though, good recipe but just not with the peppermint candy

While i try to follow exact recipe for an accurate review, i did make a couple of changes.  Because i already had white chocolate chips on hand, that's what i used.  I also did not add the nuts because they are so pricey.  I enjoyed this cookie and received compliments.  I literally crushed the canes with a sledge hammer sealed in a ziploc bag.  it worked.  Mine was very, very tiny pieces, almost powder, which worked well. I didn't like the idea of biting into hard pieces of candy when eating a cookie.  Check underside of cookie before end of baking time.

Followed the directions to the T.  Not sure what happened, but as soon as they went into the oven, the spread and flattened.  I thought they'd look more like a ball like the name suggests and the picture looks.  Although they didn't turn out very pretty, they taste really good.

Made exactly as directed, except didn't have any white chocolate, so melted chocolate chips and dipped the cookies in the chocolate, then dipped them into the peppermint like the directions say.     Delicious!!
