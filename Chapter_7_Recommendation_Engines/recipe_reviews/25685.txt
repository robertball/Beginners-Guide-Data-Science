I quadrupled this recipe for an office potluck at work, what a hit!  Here are some of the changes I made:  I sauteed the bacon, onions and celery, and added the flour to the bacon fat to make the roux.  I love potatoes in my clam chowder so I diced up a couple pounds of potatoes and simmered them in a large stock pot of the clam juice and water.  After the potatoes were tender, I added to bacon/onion/celery roux and thickend the broth.  Then I added some milk and cream and the minced clams.  It was so simple and sooooo good!  This recipe is going in my book of keepers!

This recipe is excellent, and very easy.
Instead of using bottled clam juice, which can be gritty, I prefer the St.Ours clam broth you buy in a package and mix with water.

This clam chowder is awesome!  I don't like potatoes in soup, so I'm always picking them out. When I found this without potatoes, I had to try it.  I've made it twice now and it's is absolutely the best chowder I've ever had.  Very easy to make and full of flavor. Thank you, Cathie!

Absolutely delicious. My family just loved this recipe. Kids gobbled it up and husband had thirds!!! I changed the recipe a bit. I did added one more tbsp of flour and used 500ml of half and half and 500ml of milk. I also did not use clam juice as I did not have any. I cooked the chowder but left out the clams and let it simmer while I steam cooked the fresh clams with white wine and garlic butter. I added the 2 cups of stock from the steaming of the clams to the chowder and then, just before  serving the chowder, added the chopped clams. I did not want the clams to over cook. It was just perfect this way. Our family likes a mild clam flavor and this chowder was perfect.  All the flavors were a perfectly delicious combination. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

Wonderful, chuncky and flavor-filled chowder.  I substituted 2 small potatoes (red & russet) for the celery and served with crusty warm french bread.  Also added some extra flour to thicken up.  Absolutley fantastic!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed the directions exactly (except where it forgot to tell us when to add the additional clam juice, i did that on my own) and it "broke" almost immediately. I also was not crazy about the flavor/consistency.

This has been an OMG GOOD chowder, But..  If you have more that 2 people eating it, You should double or even triple the recipe amounts.  I had to make a second trip to the store because my daughter had her boyfriend over.  To coin a contemporary phrase (WE TORE IT UP!!)  Had to add a little more flour and water as a thickening agent but UM, UM, that stuff was great.  Heaven on the lips.  Took the Chill off A Cold and Snowy Day in Colorado.

Great! Trying to do the low carb thing, but was afraid chowder would be too boring without potatoes. NOT!  So full of chunks you don't even notice there are no potatoes.  I did substitute milk for half and half, and added thyme and garlic salt.  Very Yummy!  Will make over and over!  Thanks for posting this Cathie.

The bacon needs to be fried crisp before adding the veggies.  I had to skim fatty pieces of bacon off of the top.  I added carrots and I boiled potatoes in the juice mixture until they were fork tender and then I added light cream instead of half and half.  I used 3 cans of clams as well.

Outstanding!  Only used to bottles of clam juice but it still turned out perfectly.  It was one of the best clam chowders I have made yet.

I also added two cloves of fresh garlic to the celery and onion, but left out the bacon, I didn't want that to be such a strong taste.  I also added a can of diced new potatoes in as well and a little less clams. It was great!

My mother-in-law thought this was spectacular and I'd have to agree.  It cost a fortune, but I doubled the recipe.  Eight cups of clams doesn't come cheap, though one could get by with less than that, no doubt.  I served this with "Best Ever Cheese Bread," also from this website.

Tasty but wasn't quite thick enough.  Probably needs more flour for a thicker roux.  I added potatoes, which is a nice addition to chowder.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always good. However I too used the bacon drippings to make the roux and it was great! After sitting in the fridge for 24 hours it was even better

We make this about once a month - I do not like potatoes in my clam chowder, so this works well.  I use two bottles of clam juice. 
 Also, I substitute Light Cream for Half and Half.  For the chopped clams I use one pound.

Love this recipe!  Here are my changes added two chopped up carrots with celery - adds a little color. Did not use separate pan for rue.  Put the 1/4 cup butter in pan with bacon and vegetables and used 1/4 cup flour to make rue.

Followed recipe but did use 4 tablespoons of flour and added thyme for flavour. Thanks everyone for suggestions.

I read a few reviews first and I too made the roux with the onion and celery only. I boiled 3 cubed potatoes in 2 bottles of clam juice and water. I added the 1 bottle clam juice to the  roux and then added the potatoe/clam juice to roux.  I thickened with 4 heaping tblp of flour when making the roux but added 2 heaping tblp flour to some half and half cream when finished as was still not thick enough for our tastes. I pre-cooked the bacon and then just added with the clams. I used frozen clam meat and only used a 1/4 of the bag and it is enough for us. The flavour is excellent and you can definitely add or subtract things based on your likes. I also added chopped fresh parsley which is delish in thick soups and with clam chowder. I only used about 1/2 the half and half cream.
I should say that it made enough soup for 3 people for two days of lunches. 
Will be making again and again over the winter months!

I used up some green onions I had in the frig. instead of an onion.  Used Light Cream and three TBSP of real bacon bits.  Saved time.   Pretty good quick recipe, and its Keto friendly too.

Great recipe! My husband likes less potatoes, so I used half what the recipe called for, and also added some flour to thicken it more (perhaps because I used less potatoes? ). Next time I will make it with more clams!

amateur cook here, I can't have butter and I needed to triple the recipe. I subbed with sour cream and 1TB of olive oil, I added half & half as needed-probably about 1/2 quart; I think the sour cream made me need less even though I tripled the recipe. I didn't triple the flour, used 4TB. And I only had 2 cans of clams. Still a great recipe!

Wonderful chowder with a couple of minor modifications to suit our preferences. I appreciate you posting this recipe as I'd never made a creamy chowder before, and needed a good, basic guideline & procedure to follow. I cooked the chopped onions and diced bacon in a few tablespoons of melted butter, then added a couple of tablespoons of flour thus creating a roux. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, but omitted water and substituted more clam juice instead, doubled the potatoes. After the potatoes were cooked through in the clam juice, I reduced the heat to a low simmer, then I added twice the amount of clams (I used half minced clams and half chopped clams), and used 1 quart half & half with about a pint of heavy cream. I stirred it often making sure the cream wasn't allowed to boil. I threw in a couple of tablespoons of dried parsely, and a couple of teaspoons of dried dill weed. I served this at a potluck with fresh french bread, and got huge raves, and lots of recipe requests. Thank you!!! 07/15/2012: Made this again last night...just delicious! I've found that precooking the bacon til crisp then adding to the roux of butter, onions and flour makes a huge difference. Also, replacing all water with clam juice adds great flavor.

My family loves it! Whenever I make this recipe, I double it. We do not like chunks of celery and potatoes in our chowder, so I do not use celery. I use 8 (6.5 oz) cans of chopped and minced clams in clam juice. I drain the clams and save the juice for the soup, instead of using bottled clam juice. I use about 2 cups of the juice with 2 quarts of half-and-half. For a little extra flavor, I use pepper, dried chives, parsley, and celery salt.
