I honestly do not understand why this recipe is rating so low!! THE CHOPS were PERFECT!! and super easy too!! I let the chops sit in the sauce for about an hour and a half prior to cooking.  This made them super tender!!! I also added in a few 'smashed' cloves of garlic, some pepper, a pinch of cayenne, a dash of dry moustard and a couple dashes of worchestire sauce.  Alongside the chops (in the sauce) I also added some largely chopped green and red peppers, and some onions. THEY WERE GREAT and a hit with the family... the beer was the perfect taste... not over powering at all!! LOVED THEM!! I would recommend this one again and again!

This is a simple and good weeknight dish.  Made a few changes the 2nd time: I seasoned the chops good with garlic salt and pepper and then browned them.   I used only half the beer, adding 8 oz. of water.  I topped each chop with a thin slice of onion and then poured the liquid over the chops.  I baked covered with foil for 50 minutes, uncovered them and baked 15 min. more.   This made them more tender and juicy.  I served over rice, but the next time, I'm going to add one cup of uncooked rice to the dish at the beginning.  I think this will absorb some of the extra liquid.  My family liked the taste of these pork chops.

I tried this last night - husband and PICKY 4 yr old son loved it!  I did change it a bit after reading the reviews.  I only used about a cup of ketchup. I added some worcestershire sauce, chopped onion, mustard (to cut the sweet), and used about 3/4 of a beer.  I seared the chops first and gave them some flavor with garlic salt and pepper.  Served with Au Gratin potatoes - easy and great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe with a beef roast before, cooked in my beloved Pampered Chef clay cooker (has a lid) and it always is tender and yummy.  I was looking to make a meal for a co-op Freezer Swap that would work in the crock pot and was a little cheaper than purchasing 5 roasts.   ...and it had never crossed my mind to use pork chops.  I placed the raw, un-panseared chops in the crock pot and poured the ingredients over them and mixed.  I cooked them for 4 hours on high.  Then removed the chops and cut away the bones, cut/shredded my tender pork chops and threw the meat back into the juice so it  was flavor-ful and juicy, and then scooped it out with a slotted spoon.  I highly recommend cooking this in the crock pot as oppossed to the oven....it concerned me that so many people complained of dryness, but I didn't have this problem at all in my crock.  My husband and I both found this to be flavorful and enjoyed it greatly....I used Michelob Beer, I hate the taste of beer, and have yet to drink more than just a sip, and I can say that the taste of beer was not overwhelming at all.  I have also used Honey Brown in the past to make both my roast and beer bread and have enjoyed the flavor.  I can't wait to hear what my fellow swappers think of this easy meal!!  Good Luck!

Wonderful!!!!  Fast and Delicious.  I followed the advice of other reviewers.  I let the chops sit in the sauce for 1 hour prior to cooking.  I added a few dashes of worchishire, cayene pepper, and black pepper to the sauce.  I also covered with foil while cooking for 50 min. and removed it, drained the liquid, and added more sauce and cooked uncovered 15 more minutes.

Delicious, tender chops that whole family enjoyed. I served it with spinach,  and rice that I cooked with the chops as others suggested. I made it almost exactly as written but I did brown the chops with a little garlic first.  Next time I will add less sugar as it was a little sweet for my taste but that's the only change I'd make. Great easy supper!

My family loved this.  My pickiest daughter ate three helpings!  I pretty much followed the directions given except that I did brown the chops in a little olive oil and garlic salt before I put them in the baking dish. I used Warsteiner dark beer and I didn't have quite enough kethcup so I made up the difference (1/2 cup) with Heinz 57 sauce. I used a cheap grade of chops, about 5 lbs (9 big chops with bone) and had PLENTY of sauce.  We poured it over rice and it was just delicious.  This is a keeper.  Very easy.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it! My only addition would be to pre-sear the pork to give it a better appearance than the stark white.

I had a good time with this recipe.  I browned the chops, seasoning them with garlic powder, salt and pepper... then in the ketchup, beer and brown sugar, I added Worcheshire Sauce and "Liquid Smoke."  I sliced up an onion and put these slices under the porkchops, in the sauce.  I saved some of the sauce for the top of the chops, too.  My husband liked it more than I did... I think next time, I would add some cayenne pepper and maybe some other spices...  My husband's 5 and my 3 averaged out to a 4 star...  so enjoy and experiment!

I made this for the first time tonight.  This is a great base recipe!  I read over the reviews and changed quite a bit.  First I decreased the recipe to 4 servings.  I added 1/2 tbl Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp dry ground mustard, 1/4 tsp ground red pepper, minced garlic and onion, 2 tbl bbq sauce.  I used 3/4 c of light beer and we really couldn't taste the beer, but I think it really added to the overall taste of the sauce.  My husband LOVED it.  We will definitely have this again and often.  It was perfect served over steamed white rice with steamed cabbage.  YUMMMO!

I used many of other cook's suggestions. I cut the ketchup down to about half but used plenty of beer (my man likes beer). To the sauce I added, garlic, pepper, worcestershire sauce, and minced onion. For the first 50 minutes of cooking time I covered with foil and then removed it for the last 10 minutes. It was a huge hit.

My husband loved these. I read the reviews and added onion and some BBQ sauce, used boneless pork loins (did not pre-brown them or cover with foil and they turned out very moist). My sauce was way too watery even with only adding a third of the beer. I followed others and drank the rest of it. I did add the cornstarch after it was cooked brought back to a low boil and it thickened up nicely. We served over rice. Note to myself.. drink more of the beer and add less to the dish next time and add cornstarch pre-baking.

Great recipe! I thought I had all the ingredients but my son had used ketchup earlier in the day, yikes! 1st, I seasoned porkchops with salt/pepr/garlic/onion powder, then I browned them in a skillet. I ended up only using 1 1/2 c. ketchup and then I used 1/2 can of beer (drank the rest!)I cut back on brown sugar to fit recipe. These came out great, family loved them and wants me to make them again!

I added one medium onion as suggested by previous reviewers. The beer I chose was Leinenkugel's Red. Hohum presentation. I followed the recipe for servings of four and used half the beer suggested. With marinating the chops in sauce for a few hours and then cooking in the crockpot for 1 hour, the chops came out tender. But I wasn't blown away by the sauce. I don't think I'll make this again.

It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't wonderful either.  The ketchup overpowers everything & really, if I wanted my pork chops to taste like ketchup, I'd just dip them in it. I won't be making this one again.

This is a good one. Very simple but really good. My wife even liked it and she isn't a beer or ketchup fan. - My recommendation would be to cut the beer down to half. I made this twice and it was much better with half the beer.

Instead of beer I add ¼ cup of Tequila, also 3 slices of onion, thinly sliced, 2 slices of green bell pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic, minced with the  3 tbl brown sugar and ½ c. catsup. Recipe was reduced to serve 2.

These pork chops were great.  I added 1/2 an onion, red pepper flakes to taste and 2 cans of Sylvia's field peas w/snaps.  They helped with the flavor tremedously.  I served them over baked potatoes that are slightly mashed.  If your chops are rather thin, I would reduce baking time by 15 minutes.

i added one large onion sliced, a yellow and a red bellpeper, a stick of celery chopped, two carrots sliced. i put all this over the porckchops in a backing pan. in the sauce i used german beer (i prefar german beer because it is stronger and tastes better) i replaced the ketchup with a hunt's can of petite diced tomatoes. also added two tbsp of crushed garlic (i buy the fresh crushed one in a jar) a  bit of large crushed pepper, rosemary, thyme, oregano.(the leafs i used the mccormik gourmet colection, they come in a clear spice jar with a green label and a black cap) i poured the sauce over the chopes and made sure they were all berried under the sauce. also i stabbed the porkschops before putting them into the pan so they will marinate better. i put them in the fridge to marinate for about 24 h+ (made them on sundey morning and cooked them monday afternoon for dinner.) i baked them covered in foil for 50 minutes and then without the foil for another 10. i used some of the liquid to cook some rice as a side dish.  me and my husband loved this one. he gave me 9 stars out of 10 so i am pretty sure we will be making this again

These were incredible! Used home brewed beer and rich ketchup and the chops came out with just the right flavor. Will make this again regularly.

I just made this for me and my boyfriend (who usually does the cooking.) I did make a few changes, but it was still absolutely delicious. I was low on Ketchup so I substituted some barbeque sauce (it was about half and half) I also added some Dijon mustard because I noticed it being used in similar recipes and figured it couldn't hurt, and there was also a splash of hot sauce for some kick (I use it on most things.) I also crushed and chopped a clove of garlic, and threw in a tad of crushed red pepper, black pepper, and chili powder. The beer I used was Yuengling Lager. (I was debating on Guinness, but used the Yuengling because there was more of that (and its cheaper.) Anyway I wish I would have made more, because it went quick. I will definitely be making this again, we both loved it.

LOVED IT! however, I did not follow the recipe exactly. instead of beer, I used spiced rum, which worked out great! I added 2 tblsp worchestershire sauce, 1 clove of minced garlic, a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (my family doesn't do spicy) and 1/2 tblsp of yellow mustard. I followed everything else exactly, and they turned out GREAT!

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought they were ok but my bf thought they were awful!! he hated the glaze. He is not picky and likes everything, so for him not to like them is a surprise.

This recipe was fantastic!  My entire family LOVED it! I used a suggestion from another review, and after adding the chops to the sauce, I sprinkled garlic powder and old bay seasoning on top of them, then added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce.  They were excellent, and I definitely plan on making them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy, very tasty. The changes I made: used one cup chili sauce, 1 cup catsup. Used 3/4 cup brown sugar but NOT PACKED, added 1 tsp dry mustard, t tbsp Worcestershire sauce and used almost all the beer (drank a couple of ounces myself!) My 18 year old was skeptical but really liked it. Great sauce to spoon over rice.

Just made this tonite and we loved it. My husband is a picky eater and he said it was awesome. I loved the sauce on my boiled potatoes. I used 3/4 of a can of Bud instead of the whole thing and I browned the chops first.. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!!

This sauce was delicious!  It would go great with any meat.  I am going to try it with ribs.  I added a little chopped onion and a dash of worcheshire sauce but would have been fine either way.

Pretty good.  We liked the flavor of the marinade and it was so easy.  A good recipe for nights that your in a hurry... ingredients usually on hand. Not special enough for company, but I'll make it again.

This made way too much sauce...possibly would have worked better with MUCH larger pork chops than i had...thin ones just drowned in the sauce..Tasted ok, not terrible.

This is so delicious!! The ingredients sound a bit odd but it makes a wonderful gravy. I brown the chops and then simmer over a medium heat for about 30-40 minutes. Perfect with mashed potatoes and corn. Yum!

Awesome meal!! I only had 4 small chops, so of course I had too much of the sauce. Even after I halved it! Next time I want to use it sparingly so it reduces more like a barbecue sauce. I browned it first with salt and pepper and a bit of crushed garlic. I added the slices of onion on top. Yum! I served it with plain old stuffing and mashed potatoes. Soo good! Next time I will try to put a bit of a twist on it. Maybe adding roasted garlic, whole pieces. And maybe even some peppers or sun dried tomatoes. We will have to see!

These pork chops are really tasty and very easy to prepare.  I make these all the time.  I follow the recipe as written, accept for seasoning the pork chops with a little salt, pepper, garlic and cayenne pepper.  I have had some trouble with the beer-sauce erupting and splattering all over the oven, so I usually cover with foil until the last 15 minutes of cooking.

This was okay. I much prefer the apricot chops from Allrecipes. My pork chops got overcooked, and we didn't care for the sauce. I would not make again.

We love this. I do make a few changes- I add minced garlic and honey to the sauce and I bake the chops covered for 1 hour and then uncover them for another 30 minutes...they are really tender that way. I sear the chops first. I add sliced onions on top of the chops too. Also, after I uncover the chops, I drain off some of the sauce into a sauce pan, bring it to a boil and add some cornstarch to thicken it up, then drizzled it over the chops and rice...SUPER GOOD!! This is a regular in our house!

This was a good recipe.  I added a little barbeque sauce, reduced amount of sugar and threw in a smashed clove of garlic.  Also peppered the chops pretty well. Husband loved it!

This was very easy and pretty good.  I added 2 dashes of worcestershire sauce that others had mentioned plus a dash of tobasco sauce.  I served with buttered noodles and put the extra sauce on them.  This was a good busy day recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I was afraid to try this, too, because of the mixed reviews, but it tasted awesome.  I seasoned the pork chops as I would for the grill (season salt and worcestersgure sauce), mixed the remain ingredients as the appear in the recipe and baked, removing foil the last 30 minutes.  They were perfect and tasted great.  Chops took a little longer to cook then recipe alotted, but they were thick Iowa chops, so just check and see if they are as tender as you would like,and bake longer if not.  Just a side note, the house didn't smell like a drinking party like one reviewer said.  I'll reserve any additional comment along that line.

It's a little sweet as is.  Need a little "umph".  some garlic, red pepper, and substitute some of the ketchup with favorite BBQ sauce would help.  However, teh chops turned out perfect.  I always drying mine out.  these were perfect.  will make this again, with some spice!

I really liked this recipe - the chops were moist and flavorful.  My husband, on the other hand, felt that the sauce was too sweet and tasted too much of beer.  I used Sam Adams Winter Lager.  If I had used a light beer, I think he may have liked the taste a bit better.  All in all, this is a great weeknight recipe.

While the meat was tender and juicy, it was bland and boring. The "sauce" didn't stick to the meat at all, so when you took a piece, it was just a bland piece of pork. Not worth the time or ingredients put into it.

This is delicious!!  The only changes I made was to add salt, pepper and garlic powder directly to the pork chops before baking.  I submerged the chops in the sauce and covered in foil for the entire cooking time.  So simple to make and so good!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Seared the pork chops first with some salt/pepper/granulated garlic. Also cooked covered with foil for about 3/4 of cooking time.Served with buttered egg noodles on the side. The sauce was AWESOME on the noodles!

Very scrumptious! I used less ketchup & brown sugar and about 3/4 can of cheap beer. I also used a very cheap cut of pork loin chops and added a bit of Worceshire. Very good with some homemade potatoe rolls, baked beans, and scalloped potatoes.

Prep time is only 5 minutes, not 20, which is a good thing!  Recipe made too much sauce.  I used chops that were on sale and a lower grade than I usually buy and they turned out tough.  The sauce was too sweet for my taste.  I didn't think this recipe was a keeper.  Not horrible, but not memorable.  Might be useful if cooking for a large group.  Use a bigger pan and I think you could cook sixteen chops with this amount of sauce.

This was pretty good.  My husband and kids loved the sauce but I felt it was a lot like bottled sweet BBQ sauce.  I had to improvise w/ ingredients:  about 1 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup sweet soy sauce, splash of worstershire, 1/2 bottle beer (Molson), garlic powder and pepper.  Make sure that you watch the time too.  I browned my bone-in chops first and they were overcooked in 20 minutes!

Family loved this recipe. I sauteed the pork chops prior to cooking in olive oil. Then, I added a touch of honey, some mustard, worcestershire, garlic, and onions to the sauce. I used thick, boneless pork chops. I served it with cheesy mashed potatoes and green beens. The sauce was still a little thin even though I only used 8 ounces of beer. We will have it again.

This recipe made for a good, solid, dinner (according to my husband). I added some worchestire sauce and chopped onion to the sauce.  For the time it takes to throw together, this earned 4 stars; if it were a complicated one, it would probably be less, but since it was super easy, it's a definite make-again.  My 4-year old raved about it, too!

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half for only 4 pork chops.  I added 1 1/2 tsp. spicy mustard and 3 tblspn. soy sauce.  The sauce is a bit runny, but it's quite tasty especially over rice or couscous.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was awful. The porkchops were so tough no one could cut them with a knife. I gave mine to the dog who enjoyed tossing it in the air and watching it bounce.

Very yummy!! I will defiantly be making these again! I ended up cooking my pork chops in the crock pot (for 6 hours) instead of the oven for convenience. They turned out very tender and juicy. I followed the advise from a lot of other reviews and added a little Mustard and Worcestershire sauce. I also put in 1/2 of a onion chopped and 5 cloves of garlic minced. They were a hit!  Thank you Sadie for the delicious recipe!

I had a similar recipe that also added minced onion and Worchester sauce (yah, that's how I say it so that's how I spell it!  :o])  I can't seem to find it so I'm glad I found this one.  This is SO simple and extremely tasty!!!  This is the only way I make pork chops anymore, they come out super moist too! Mmmmmmmmmm! :o]

Very good! Easy to make!  I added a few drops of Frank's hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce,and black pepper and used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Had a lot of left over sauce so next time I will cut down on the amount of ketchup...or add more chops!

I tried this recipe because the cupboard was bare & I had all the ingredients. I have made it at least 6 times already - sometimes I add onions & bell peppers if I have them. Easy sweet & sour serve with some rice.

I have a version of this recipe.  It is the same but uses less beer (3/4 cup) and more ketchup. Season the chops with salt , pepper then brown in oil on both sides. Remove chops, drain out oil.  Stir in sauce in skillet.  Add the chops and let simmer, covered over medium to low heat.  They come out so tender and with so much flavor!  Doesn't taste like barbecue sauce but is very tasty!  My family loves this recipe.

My family loved these pork chops.  I was a little short on time so I seasoned the chops and browned them in some butter. I had a lot of sauce left over.  I will try serving with rice next time to use some of the yummy sauce.

It was okay. It needs some tinkering; more seasoning, more browning, maybe a darker ale beer. But good starter recipe.

This is an extremely easy way to make your chops taste great. Loved it! I will reduce the amount of Guiness next time though so the sauce will jelly up a bit better. Cloves and onions went nicely with the flavor as well.

This was SUPER easy!  My husband and I threw it together and even though we didn't have brown sugar (we substituted honey), and our beer was Abita Satsuma Summer Ale, it turned out really great.  We are looking forward to doing this again when we have more time to marinate the chops.  That would make it just perfect.

I must add, though, that this is only a good recipe for you if you like the flavor of beer... its the most obvious flavor in the dish!  But we love it so 5 stars!

Loved it! Read some of the reviews and went with their advice to marinate the pork for an hour before thorwing it in the oven. Also i went ahead and put minute rice in for the last 10 minutes of cooking. The Pork turned out juicy and delicious and the rice was so full of flavor from the marinade. I will definitely cook this again :D

VERY easy recipe with a great flavor.  My family loved it!  The only change was that I added about 1 1/2 tbsp of mustard to make it a little less sweet.  Yum!

I was looking for a pork chop recipe that sounded yummy and was simple.  This recipe was a great find!  I seasoned the chops first but still let them sit in the sauce for almost and hour before baking.  I highly recommend thicker cut, bone-in chops.  My 3 year old devoured 2 of the pork chop bones, in addition to a decent portion of meat as well.  Not sure how much of a difference it made but I used Yuengling Lager this time.  I think some darker beers would be quite interesting.  I also have on hand some "Taste #5 Umami Paste" so I added a few squirts of that.  All things considered, they were some of the best pork chops we've had in a long, long time!  Thanks!

EXCELLENT! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SOMETHING SO SIMPLE COULD BE SO YUMMY! It only took minutes to prepare and really not long in the oven at all. I will DEF do this again! My picky boyfriend loved it and my kids scarfed it down. Only thing I added was powdered garlic. GREAT!

Other than halving the recipe and browning the chops I followed the directions and they were really good.  My husband was sceptical about a ketchup based sauce - thought they'd be too "ketchupy" but he really liked them and had seconds.  Will make again.

I do pretty much as the recipe said. I add a little garlic, pepper, and sea salt to taste. I let them sit in the sauce in a ziploc bag for about 2 hours. then I cook it at about 250 F for 15 minutes then 325 for another 10-15 so that the porkchops are nice and moist. I've also tried a little more ketchup for a thicker sauce and added a bit of soy sauce so it wasn't too sweet. My hubby and i love it.

Super easy.  My hubby and 2 kids both liked it so it was a success.  Made the chops super tender.  The only suggestion I have is that the instructions call to put the chops on top of the sauce in the dish.  I would do that, but then spoon a little over top of the chops as well so they get a little flavor on top.

I followed the advice of some other reviewers and tweeked the recipe a bit. I used 1 cup ketchup, 1 Tbspn BBQ sauce, 1 Tsp Worchestershire sauce, 3/4 bottle of beer, 1/4 tsp of dry mustard, 2 cloves of garlic (crushed), and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also seared the pork chops with some steak seasoning and then through everything in the crock pot with 1/2 a large onion. Put on low all day then served over brown rice and peas. Super yummy and kids loved it!

My fiancee said he could definitly eat this recipe again. I only cooked two large chops and they came out perfectly. The sauce tasted decent, though I might tweak the amount of ketchup next time. Two cups was a bit overpowering. I used Budweiser for the beer and it was excellently matched.

This was really good. I did take the advice from another reviewer and added some cayenne, garlic, and Worchester sauce. And also added some onion salt, garlic powder, and pepper. the pork chops I have are a little tough to begin with but I didn't cover it while baking (per instruction) but I think next time I will cover them for the whole time, maybe that will make them a little more tender.

Awesome!  I love cooking with beer.  So easy too.  Could definitely taste the beer in these chops, but even my beer-hating mother loved them and I love the 5 minute prep time.  Will be making these again and again.

My family and I love this recipe! And I'm not very fond of barbeque sauced meats. It's definitely my favorite! I also added chopped garlic and about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. We've baked chops in the oven and this sauce is also awesome on ribs on the grill! Yum yum! We've had tons of compliments. People can't get enough!

Well I prepared this meal for my boyfriend yesterday which is the first time I have cooked for him in the yr I have known him and 10mths I have been dating him.. I substituted the barbeque sauce along with worchestire sauce for the ketchup and I did steak instead of porkchops. I seasoned the steaks and let it set for a half an hour or so. Then I beat to help tenderize it and cut it up into strips. Then I fried down onions,sweet pepper and garlic in a little oil (you can use water)then I added the steak which naturally produces alot of juices. I browned it then placed it in the pan and poured the sauce over it and mixed the meat in it and placed it in the baker. The steak was tender but not as tender as it could of been the next time I prepare this I will add some more tenderizer and let it seep in for a longer period of time before i beat it. I made mash potatoes and mix veg to go along with it. Then later opted for yellow rice which worked just as well....Which I was told by those who had it cuz I don't eat meat.

This sounded really good, and the sauce was flavored well, but only because I used a yummy bbq sauce(not ketchup!) and beefed it up with a splash of vinegar & dry mustard. I used Heineken. I used thick cut pork chops, browned them in a dutch oven first, and then made  the sauce in the browning pan, then cooked chops in pan...sounds like it would work out okay, but for me, it wasn't my fave. The sauce didn't penetrate the meat. I prefer a different preparation of chops and I would use the sauce again, but maybe for a pulled pork or something. Not the best.

Fanastic! The sauce was a tad runny will use some corn starch next time. But my hubby smacked his lips with satisfaction. I also followed the tips of using a dash of Worst. Sauce and garlic salt.

Seriously good....my husband loved the pork chops and sauce....he actually went back for thirds.  I liked it to, but next time will definitely marinate chops to tenderize and will use a little less beer.  Definitely will become a regular in my house!!

Great flavor and simple to make.  I'd like to try some of the extra sauce on white rice or mashed potatoes.  Even my 2 year old ate her meat with this recipe.

This was unbelievably delicious. At first I wasn't sure if this would taste good but then I looked at all the reviews and was very surprised. Went well with yellow rice. The hubby wants more and more and more. Definately will be making MORE. Thanks!

i JUST made this recipe and it was sooo good.  I wish I had more pork chops.   My mother makes this at home with coke instead of beer so you can try that if you're not into alcohol.  I followed others' advice a bit and rubbed the chops in salt, pepper, and garlic powder, but not excessively and only right before I put them in.  I just eyed the amounts I added and used demurura instead of brown sugar because that's what I had on hand.  I baked for 50 min w/ a cover lightly on top and another 15 w/o a cover as someone else suggested and they turned out beautifully tender!     I had them with mash potatoes and asparagus, and would def recommend the mash potatoes to dip into the sauce and such.  I used a lakeport honey and you could taste a hint of it in the chops.  Excellent!

I used a Cherry Wheat beer, and it came out really great.  I used half the beer and seasoned the chops as suggested.  The sauce was a little thin, but overall good dish.

I liked this recipe although it received mixed reviews from my family which is why it rated so low.  My husband HATED it.  He wouldn't even finish his porkchop.  He said it was the most disgusting sauce he'd ever tasted.  Meanwhile my 4 and 5 year old were dipping their side dishes (broccoli and mashed potatoes) in the sauce and my 4yo was even eating it with a spoon and wanted seconds on sauce.  My oldest son said it was just so so.  If I do make it again I would cut down the liquid to make a thicker sauce, it was very thin.  But it reminded me of the sweet and sour sauce we get here when we order chinese takeout (almost the same color too lol).  I thought it was pretty good but I don't think it's going to make it in my house.

Easy, easy recipe. I took someone elses advice and let the porkchops marinate for a few hours. They were very tender and my boyfriend loved them. The ketchup didn't give quite enough flavor for me. Next time I will use 1/2 bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup and see how it turns out.

Very easy and yummy.  I followed other reviewers advice and rubbed the chops with garlic powder, salt and pepper and then browned them first.  I cut the ketchup in half as well as the beer, then made a gravy out of the sauce at the end with a mixture of water and cornstarch. It was a bit to "ketchuppy" for my taste but the rest of my family liked the gravy a lot. Thanks for a good recipe!

My family - especially my husband - just loves these pork chops.  I season them with pepper and a little garlic powder, and add a little liquid smoke flavoring to the sauce.  So easy and so good!

Bland and Boring. My teenagers are fascinated with beer, and since they can't drink it yet, I thought this would be a hit. They didn't care for this dish. We ended up covering the chops with sauces from the fridge door. Thanks anyway.

This was pretty good. It was very dry though, next time I will cook it for half the time. I marinated the pork in the sauce for an hour before I cooked it which really helped with the flavor.

This was just okay, not terrible but not great.  The beer taste was just about right, however it was bland.  And it was really dry.  1 hours was way to long to bake.

Absolutely delicious. I was worried that the beer would be over powering but I could barely tell there was any beer in them. Added half an onion to the sauce.
Servered these pork chops with mashed potatoes and corn. If you put the sauce on the potatoes you don't have to put any butter and makes the potatoes so moist. Excellent!!!

Very good! Hubby rated this a 3 (he's not a big fan of anything tomato based) but I thought it was very tasty. I only used half of the beer that it called for and turned out well.

these were good.  used thick cut boneless chops.  took the other reviewers advice and added 1/2 a chopped onion and about 1/2 tsp of ground mustard to the sauce.  i pan-seared them with pam and garlic salt and only baked them for about 25 minutes.  since i only had 4 chops i halved the recipe and used a casserole dish to bake in.  had so much sauce that the chops sank to the bottom.  maybe that helped prevent them from drying out.  my husband and older son liked the meat a lot.  (they're not really 'saucy' people.)  my 6yo didn't really care for them, but that's par for the course with pretty much everything these days.  personally, i thought they were great!  would definitely serve these when company comes over.

Holy Cow! Very good. Didn't give it five stars because, well, after all..it's only pork. ; ) Anyway, this was excellent. I only used 4 chops, w/bone and used a 2 qt casserole dish. The chops were practicly burried in the ketcup/beer/bsugar mix and I really started to wonder if this would be any good at all. But it was excellent. I put a little fresh pepper on it and also sprinkled some fiesta party dip mix from Tastefully Simple on top to give it a zing. The meet melted right in my mouth and fell off the bone. Both my husband and I were like, 'Wow! Dem Chops is good!'

Pretty good. I added the onions and worcestershire as well as garlic powder. Sauce was a bit runny and I would definitely recommend not cooking it for a full hour. We baked ours for 45 min. Will probably make again, enjoyed the sweet flavor and the slight alcohol taste. Very simple and tasty!

This recipe was fairly decent and not all that difficult.  I chopped a medium size onion and 2 large cloves of fresh garlic and added a decent dash of worchestershire sauce and Liquid Smoke.  The gravy came out a little runny so I think I might not add as much beer.  Otherwise, it smelled great and tasted well with pork.

Was a bit more sweet than sassy. Aroma while baking was wonderful. Added garlic and worch. sauce to spruce it up.

This was SUPER easy, I loved that part of the recipe. It was great for tossing together and throwing in the oven. I followed the ingredients pretty closely, I did a couple things different in cooking the pork chops though. I only used 4 pork chops, but didn't decrease the rest of the ingredients. I poured half of the sauce in a baking pan, placed the pork chops on top, and then covered them with the rest of the sauce. I also baked them for 30 minutes covered with foil, and the remainder of the cooking time uncovered. The flavor was ok in my opinion, it definitely had potential, I just didn't think it was a strong enough flavor, it was very mild, but good.

Pros:  Fast, easy and cheap.  A great weeknight meal.

Cons:  Pork chops came out kind of tough.

My wife and kids really like the recipe and I like how easy it was to slap together when I get home from work and my wife is still working.  If you add your own spices it is really tasty, but the pork chops came out a bit tough.

Pretty good...although I was a bit taken aback by the smell it emitted - it was rough!!  I did season my chops with some seasoned salt and garlic and onion powders, which helped I think.  Cooked for roughly 40-45 minutes due to the comments about the chops being tough.  Overall, good once past the smell!!

These are AWESOME!!  They were really tender and tasty dipped in ranch sauce and with a simple bread and spinach dip side dish.  I used extra thick chops, and only used 1/2 the ketchup & brown sugar called for but all the beer to keep the chops moist.  I will definitely do these again!  They were a big hit!

I would suggest increasing the cooking time. The pork chops were extra dry, despite the marinade which would have taste better if it had been thicken. My husband's complaint was he couldn't taste the beer!

Very tasty.  I used thick cut chops and increased the cooking time.  My husband liked it.  He said he was surprised how tasty it was as he was skeptical by looking at it.

I made this recipe for some friends, and they loved it. The chops took only 5 minutes to prepare. My only complaint was the fact that the chops were slightly dry, but the juicy marinade made up for it.

I have this in the oven right now.  I tried the sauce before baking and get a strong sense of the beer. I like it, but not sure my family will.  I hope the beer taste will cook off some.

I added ingredients per Kelli's review, and was glad for it, because I think otherwise the sauce would've been too plain. It smelled delicious while it was baking, but the taste was just 'good'. I probably won't make it again, because it didn't wow me enough to be a mainstay.

Thought this was good, however I do think 2cups of ketchup is too much. I covered for 40mins then uncovered for 10mins. Different and a nice change from regular BBQ.

Really like how tender the chops came out but....where was the flavor?   Thankfully I followed one reviewier's suggestion to marinate beforehand otherwise there would have been absolutely no flavor.

This one deserves 5 stars for the taste and simplicity! It was great! I used thinly sliced chops and baked them for 45 minutes instead of the hour it says. I also added a bit of mustard to the sauce. The only thing I didn't like was that the sauce was really watery and would have preferred it more carmelized, but the taste was amazing and it went great over rice! Next time I will add a tad more brown sugar and less beer. Great recipe. It's a keeper!

I seared the chops with salt (w/ out sauce) before placing them in the oven. Baked them in the oven, cut down the cooking time. Added some cayenne powder and black pepper to the sauce. It was delicious! Loved it!! definitely a keeper! Did not expect it to be soo good! Had reservations about it but seriously surprised me! Its a must. I will be keeping this recipe and using it in the future!

I made this unsure of what my hubby would think as he is NOT a beer fan! But I happened to have some left from a party, and everything else was in stock, so I gave it a go! I refused to tell him what was in it until after he ate some and he loved it! He couldn't believe it was beer based! (I could taste the beer flavour, which I loved, and he couldn't, which HE loved) It was great for both of us! I will definitely be making this again (And I will be trying the sauce with pulled pork as well)

Cooked these in an electric skillet with good results, although they didn't look appetizing.  But the taste was great.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I've made it a couple of time already for diner, if I'm undecided on what to make.  It does tastes good, but I wouldn't serve it if I had guests over my house.

I love this recipe.  The sauce is so simple and so delicious.  I did add a little ground mustard to it (as suggested by another reviewer) because I was afraid it would be a little too sweet, but I think it would be fine just as the recipe calls it.  We will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  I actually made this in the crock pot.  I just threw everything in and then went shopping for the day!  I used semi-frozen chops and cooked it on low all day.  My husband loved it!  As usual with the crock pot, the chops were very tender.  They also had great flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

I've used this recepie for years now. Thank you Colleen for a great recepie. I like it because, it is simple which allow you to customize this receipe to your own tastes. I've seen other pork chop-beer recipes but man too complicated and when finished tastes "bleh". Great recipe. Thanks for sharing this simple but good recipe.

This is delicious! And my whole family loves it. It's so easy, I add chili powder, onion powder, garlic salt, pepper and a little molasses, so it comes out more of a  sweet and spicy glaze. Thank You

This recipe is really good. I use BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and add some garlic pepper for more taste. Also if I have the time I let the chops marinade in the sauce.

My kids and I thought these were ok.  My husband said they tasted like cafeteria food.  They get points for being super easy to prepare but would be just as quick and probably better to bake them in your favorite BBQ sauce.

Made this tonight and we loved it.  I added onions, worchestire sauce, and Tobasco like others suggested.  The sauce turned out thin, but I served it with mashed potatoes and we just used it as gravy.  Otherwise next time I'll put it on the stove with some cornstarch to make a thicker sauce.  But definitely a keeper!

This is the second time i prepare this recipe and it came out yummylitious. 

I am unsure as to why people say the sauce is too runny. If baked uncovered, your sauce is a bit more on the thicker side. Also, do people notice that there is a way to change the amount of servings? that is all i can think of as far as the sauce being runny.

I used my crockpot for this as I knew I was going to be gone all day.  It worked GREAT!  I also used a low-carb sugar free Katsup and splenda brown sugar just to reduce the carbs.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and pepper.  It was great.  My husband and kids don't like Pork Chops but ate them...my husband even took seconds.  Very good crockpot recipe!!!

this was honestly way too sweet. the recipes call for too much ketchup, even though i added more beer to dilute the sweetness. The recipe probably needs alot of fine-tuning to make it a keeper.

I'm giving this recipe a 4 because I didn't actually follow it.  I used pork steaks instead of chops.  I didn't put any sugar in the sauce, because I don't like meat that is overly sweet.  I used only a bit of ketchup and lots of barbeque sauce. I also put minced onions and garlic on the pork.  I added some mustard and some worchestire sauce to the sauce, and because I didn't read the recipe carefully, I poured the sauce over the pork.  I did put 1/2 a can of beer in the sauce too.  It tasted great and I'll make it again with my modifications.

Just made this last night.  It was really good.  I didn't have a lot of ketchup so I used all I had.  I used 1 half bottle of beer and some worchestershire sauce and garlic salt.  No leftovers -- very tasty.

Great and easy recipe.  My kids loved it.  I think it could have been more tender.  I added some onions and other spices.  It's easy to make it your own.

The pork itself was pretty, but the sauce wasn't so great.

I liked the way the pork turned out with the beer sauce. The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the sauce was very thin. I ended up putting it into a saucepan & adding cornstarch to thicken it up. Then I poured it back over the chops when I served it. Other than that, the recipe is a good one.

I thought this recipe was just ok and will not make it again.  It was a little too sweet for me and I did not like the overall flavor. However, my husband did like it so I rated it a 3.

I made this last week and added a few of the sugesstions (no measuring).  The entire family loved it!  My husband even admitted that he did not want to eat it after he watched me prepare it!  After he finished his entire plate, he asked to have me make this regularly!

This recipe was so flavorful and delicious. It was a real hit.  Next time I make it, I'd take the chops out at the end and add some cornstarch to the "juice" and make a thicker sauce.

This was very delicious and easy to make. The pork chops was very tender. My wife and kids loved them. My 8 year old is very picky. Ihad these with mashed potatoes and stuffing. I will definitely be making it again

I was hesitant to try the recipe at first after reading all the negative reviews, but I'm glad that I tried it.
The other reviewers were right - the sauce is very runny, I thickened it using cornstarch dissolved in water.
My husband and I were happy with the result.
Thank You for sharing the recipe

This was ok after I made a few changes.  I cut down the amount of beer to half, and the sauce was still very thin.  I also put garlic powder, salt and pepper on the pork before adding the sauce.  I cooked it about 20 minutes longer than it said to.  The pork was very tender but it just seemed like something was missing.

Well I sat and read positive and negative reviews on this recipe.  I did take the advice of browning pork chops first which I wish I did not due because I feel the chops would have been more tender.  I made sure I mixed the sauce well before serving.  Very tasty it was on the thin side.  I may next time cut the beer in half as others have done.  Will absolutely make it again! Oh I used a Carona.

Ok...you know how your house smells the morning after you've had a party and everyone was drinking beer.  Or the smell of beer bottles that have just a little bit left in the bottom and they sat around all night...that's kinda how my house smells right now after cooking these dandies.  I can't eat anything that smells "weird" while it is cooking...like deer meat or lamb...so my husband is on his own with these chops...ok, its one hour later and my husband just came home from work and commented "ummm the house smells good" LOL...and guess what else HE LOVES THEM...he was literally licking the sauce off the bone.  So I intially rated them at 3, I guess I better change it to a 5...but I still think they smell putrid.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical of this recipe because it sounded a little extraoridnary, but my husband who despises pork chops loved these. He even went for seconds.

I can't believe how tender the pork chops came out!! I followed other reviewer's recommendations and seasoned the pork chops first with garlic powder; used half the beer and I also used half the ketchup. The sauce was too thin, but it was good!! I will make this again soon.

Good recipe & could be used with chicken too.  Best if you let is marinate in the fridge for a few hours.  My husband thinks it would be better with Sam Adams beer.  Brown rice and broccoli were great side dishes.

I really didn't think there was too much taste to this recipe. I definitely would cut down on the amount of beer that was suggested. I couldn't really use the sauce too much because it was so runny. So it was okay but I don't think I'd make this recipe again.

I think this was yummy... I did brown my chops in a skillet first with some garlic powder and( dried mustard just a small amount sprinkle on top. We only had 4 pork chops so I only used half can of beer and I cover them the last half hour so I would not bake out all the sauce. We served some of the sauce on top of our baked potatoes

The pork turned out very tough and I even marinated it for 2 hours and only baked it for 30 minutes.  The flavor was off and the beer taste was overwhelming and I even like beer.

I made this excellent dish with Sam Adams Brown Ale, and it turned out fantastic...probably because the especially malty character of the beer compliments the ketchup and brown sugar so well.  Try topping with Feta cheese crumbles right before serving!

The family thought this was a great recipe.  I did what others suggested and added an onion, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  It was a little bit dry, but I think if I push the pork chops further into the mixture it will take care of that.

I felt this tasted very much equal to eating a miller lite pork chop. It was very beer tasting. Not impressed.

The pork came out moist and tender.  I used Molsen Canadian, and it worked well.  The sauce was nice and thick, and stuck to the meat.  Quick and easy; I will make it again.

Easy to throw together with kids hanging on your hips.  I didn't care for the beer smell but the end result was pretty good.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed it so I will make again but maybe add some more sweetness to it.

If you change the number of servings via the website, be sure to change the amount of beer yourself.  I changed the recipe to 3 pork chops and it still called for one can of beer.  I should have thought things out better, but I didn't.  So the sauce was messy, but it did have a good flavor.

Made this tonight and boyfriend and our 4 kids ages 2-7 all enjoyed it very much. I browned the chops first with seasoning salt, and added a merlot steak/chop sauce to the ketchup mixture. Will make again with only those changes. Thanks!

I followed the recipe, except that I added onions per other reviews. The meat was tough, it didn't have that much flavor and it just didn't look good. I had hopes that this would be one of those simple and tasty recipes and it wasn't. :(

i added some garlic salt and onions and then cooked it for only 45-50 minutes, any longer would have made it tough (i also made only 4 pork chops, but used the recipe for 8)

I quite enjoyed this recipe. My husband found it a tad sweet, may cut back on the brown sugar next time. Add garlic and onions like previous ratings had suggested. This would be nice served with rice. Would make it again.

I was so surprised how easy this was to make!  The only change I made was a little less ketcup, a little more brown sugar and a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce.  My 14 year old daughter loved the sauce so much she had me cook her chicken in it!  It made my kitchen smell delicious and the pork chops and chicken came out tender and juicey!

Flavor was good for something different, but nothing special - would not make it again. I didn't really care for the ketchup-based taste although my boyfriend liked it. I ended up added worcestershire sauce and that helped.

This was my first time making pork chops, and I thought this recipe sounded simple enough.  It was not only simple, but very tasty!  Do not be fooled by the beer and ketchup, the final result has a definite sweet taste that complements the pork chops well.  I would make this recipe again.

Delicious sauce! Totally amazing sauce. #1 problem was the pork chops turned out VERY tough. I think it was maybe the carbonation of the beer or something. Next time I make this I will cook all the sauce ingredients before pouring on top instead of cooking it on the chops.
