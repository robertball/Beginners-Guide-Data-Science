Tastes delicious! The only thing I had to change with the second batch I made was to put a little batter in then the cream cheese and preserves. Also it helps to mix the cream cheese and strawberry preserves.

These are delicious! I've made them twice and they were great both times. paigeperski is right- it's better to mix the strawberry preserves and cream cheese before putting them in the cupcakes. 
Another modification that I made was to fill the cups about halfway with batter, put in the cream cheese mix and then fill the cup the rest of the way with batter.

Two problems (sort of) with this recipe, though. 1st, the batter is very thick, and it only makes 15-18 muffin-sized cupcakes. 2nd, the recipe calls for way more cream cheese than is really necessary. I think you could easily use a smaller container of cream cheese. Overall, though, these are great!

the cupcakes were tasty, not overly sweet, but they sunk in the middle and the filling didn't stay in the center, it flattened out almost in a layered fashion which made peeling the paper difficult because they crumbled apart as you peeled off the paper

These tasted really good! And that's all that really matters to me. They don't have to look good to taste good! But they did sink in the middle even though I followed the recipe perfectly (I think) It just made it hard to put the icing on. But they tasted great!
