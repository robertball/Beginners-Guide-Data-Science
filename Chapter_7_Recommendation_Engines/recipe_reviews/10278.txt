So yummy! I agree that they needed more pineapple flavor, so I added an extra 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of flour to make up for the extra moister. I also added an extra 1/4 cup brown sugar. Instead of icing on top I put a marachino cherry in the middle before baking. They look and taste supper yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!
Ok, new addition! Instead of the extra flour I added oats to make up for the extra moisture! It was delicious! So add an extra 1/2 cup pineapple and 1/2 cup oats and believe me you'll love them!!

These were terrific!  The cookie is very light, soft, and not overly sweet.  They are great without the glaze as well.  Having only pineapple chunks, I put some of the pineapple with a little of the juice in the blender and made a rough puree to use instead of the crushed pineapple.  I also substituted pineapple juice for the orange juice and cut the orange zest to 1 tsp., which was more than ample.  That kept more of the pineapple flavor.  After spreading the glaze on, I dipped some in sweetened flaked coconut which added an extra kick of flavor and made for an elegant presentation. These met with great reviews and were hard to stop eating!  I'll probably try with raspberry or peach puree to see what happens.  Thanks for the recipe!

The cookie had great texture and fairly good taste.  There seemed to have a slight taste of the baking soda.  However, when you use a glaze you don't notice the hint of baking soda taste.  I actually used 1 cup of pineapple/juice and added cinnamon which also helped with the taste.

For the glaze, I used 3T pineapple juice and 1 1/2C of powdered sugar.  You could half it if you don't want it on all cookies.

I wanted to see how these would turn out before using the advice of other reviewers, and yes, next time I WILL heed their advice and add more pineapple juice and some quick-cooking oats. I still like how the original recipe came out, a great change from your ordinary sugar cookie.

These are a great cookie, but you have to be in the right mood.  They are very cake-y, which can be great, as long as that's what you're expecting.  I served these with homemade bluberry ice cream, and they were delicious.  Because the ice cream is sweet, I didn't ice most of the cookies, and they are like having cupcakes!  I used 8 oz canned crushed pineapple instead of just half a cup, and substituted macademia nuts instead of walnuts.

LOVE these! I used Splenda (regular measure for brown and half of white) AND apple sauce in place of shortening (need to add a bit of flour/oatmeal to suck up some moisture because I use 8oz pineapple too). I also used coconut extract in place of vanilla and took the suggestion about using pineapple juice in frosting.

they came out nice. What I did different however was add the orange juice and zest to the mix and then added 1/4 cup extra flour to make up for the orange juice I put in. Then for the topping I used orange juice, powder sugar and Pinapple extract from watkins, and a little zest from the orange. much better flavor, other wise they are kind of bland.

Made these again (first time was a bust b/c of old baking soda) and they came out great.  Interesting side note: my stoneware pan did not do these cookies any favors.  The ones cooked on a regular metal pan lined with silpat came out much better - rose higher and cooked just right.

these were great. however, the icing needs the orange zest (i did not have it) :) also, for half of the dough i mixed in a few spoons of betty crocker instant blueberry muffin batter, and it was SO GOOD, i mean it was freakin' mmmmmm. :) for the blueberry/pineapple ones they were a touch better w/out the icing :) let me know if anyone else likes it. peace :)

I didn't follow the recipe based on availability of ingredients on hand, so my review isn't exactly fair to the recipe submitter, sorry! I added almost one cup of pineapple, added half a cup of oats, used butter, and only used white sugar. It needed almost 13 minutes to be done. For the glaze, I used only pineapple juice and powdered sugar, as suggested by another reviewer. The taste of the pineapple didn't really come through strongly enough. It was a nice and simple recipe though, thanks for sharing! Will try again using the ingredients stated in the recipe.

I just tried this recipe. The cookies have very little taste you would not know they had pineapple in them. I would not make them again.

WOW, probably the best cookie I've ever had. Delicious orange flavor that one usually can't get in a cookie.

Amazing cookies.  Soft, with a clean citrus flavor.  I would definitely use more pineapple next time...the glaze, with the orange zest, is the dominant flavor...and that's not a bad thing at all!  Wonderful cookies.  Thank you, LeeAnn!

Great easy recipe to make. I added some lemon juice to the glaze and next time I will use macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.
