I've never had lemon curd so I can't compare to anything but this is lemony!  Great recipe to use up some of the lemons leftover from making limoncello. The only deviation was using 3/4 cup sugar and at the end I was tasting and adding small amounts of agave nectar until I had a sweet tart kind of experience.  Took a little longer to cook for me but that tends to happen with le cruset pots. Waiting to see how the lemon bars I made with the curd will turn out!

After my local grocery store had huge bags of lemons for only $1 per bag I had to find something creative to do with all those lemons. This was the perfect recipe. I couldn't believe it was so simple. Because I didn't have a zester I carefully peeled the zest off with a paring knife, being careful not to get the bitter white pith. After juicing the lemons I put 1/2 cup juice into a blender with the zest and liquefied it, then added it back to the pot of lemon juice. I carefully followed the directions but doubled the recipe. After the mixture thickened I poured it into canning jars and processed in a water bath canner for 20 minutes. I used 1/2 pint wide-mouth  Ball canning jars. The result is incredible, tangy with a delightful rich sweetness. Better then the store bought imported curd I've been buying. I will always use this recipe and make my own from now on. I plan on giving the jars as Christmas presents with blueberry scone mix I will make myself. Thank you so much, Marti. Your recipe rocks!

This is exactly what I was searching for because my neighbor brought me lemons from his tree.  HUGE LEMONS!  I made four 8-ounce jars by using the portion indicator for 96 servings.  I have "gifted" my generous neighbor with a jar, opened one for myself and put the other two in the refrigerator until I can get over to my daughter's house to give her one!

First time making this. The color is beautiful; tastes great and leaves you wanting more. However, does the recipe really call for 1/4 cup of zest, or is this a typo.

Super easy recipe!  Followed it exactly and timing was perfect.  Makes about 2 1/2 pints of lemon curd.
