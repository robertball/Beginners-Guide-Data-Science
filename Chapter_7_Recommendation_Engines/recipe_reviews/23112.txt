Absolutely fantastic!! Light and tasty batter. I definitely had to add flour and I also added some Italian breadcrumbs to thicken it up. I used Sam Adam's Light Lager beer. Deep fried small florets of broccoli and cauliflower plus some button mushrooms. Dipping sauce also great. Received rave reviews from my guests.

This is a great recipe!  It was very easy and they taasted great.  The dipping sauce is a must.  This is also a great batter.  I think that it would be good on other vegetables that you might want to serve this way, if green beans are not you favorite.

This was sooo good, that when we were done eating, my husband asked me to cook more!  Easy recipe, and I think the batter would be good on just about anything. The sauce is great too.

Very light batter.  The sauce is makes this appetizer very tasty.  Without it, there really isn't much flavor.

Absolutely wonderful! I was a little skeptical, but, omg! I will never buy boxed tempura again!! I actually used the batter for bay scallops, and my husband and 2 year old gobbled them up! I only added garlic pepper, and onion powder, because it wasn't a veggie. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Great alternative to fries!  Does take dedicated time and space, unless you have a small deep fat fryer, but very good (and one of those "help me do it" dishes that cooking company can enjoy doing).

Very good.  Love the crispiness of the batter.  We didn't like the soy dip, but I boiled 1/2 cup soy, 1/2 cup suger and a bit of water with the lime juice until it thickened a bit, we liked the teriyaki flavor that gave.  We also deep fried some red peppers and broccoli to enjoy.  Thanks for the awesome recipe

I've made this receipe many times and I can't keep up with everyone gobbling them down. If I do have left overs I just freeze them and pop them in the oven when I want a great snack.

I thought this was just o.k. but because my husband and daughter seemed to like it a lot and it was very easy to make, I will probably make it again.  The batter seemed extremely runny so not much stuck to the beans and I didn't think they had much flavor.  I know I prepared the recipe correctly so I don't know what happened.  The soy sauce mixture is good.

Awesome. I added a little more flour and left out some of the sesame seeds. I also dipped them in wasabi mayo and honey mustard :)

This produces a nice light batter. I added a few spices like paprika, garlic powder and balck pepper to spice it up a bit.

This was my first time trying tempura -- and it was delicious!  The sesame seeds add a nice flavor to the batter and the sauce is excellent.  I tried several different vegetables, but the batter was so light that it didn't stick very well.  Next time I'll drink some of that beer and use less in the batter!

Exactly as described: easy and delicious. the green beans were super crunchy. In the future I might try this with other vegetables. People who said it wasn't flavorful must've missed the instruction step about salt to taste.

Yummy!! I made these for my husband and I and we were very pleased. I added just a bit more flour to make the batter thicker, and seasoned the batter with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper. It makes a lot of batter, so we wer wishing we had more to deep-fry! The dipping is sauce is very tasty too. I'm sure we'll be using this recipe again in the future!

Dan, this was soooo delicious! This is a new instant favorite at my house. I doubled your recipe and did a variety of veggies, string beans, asparagus, shitake mushroom caps, snow peas, and sweetpotato, and we had this as our main course for dinner this evening. I added a little powdered ginger to the dipping sauce, but it was just as yummy without it. We will be making this again . . and again . . and again. :)

Very easy and definately a keeper.  The batter is so light and crispy.  They only problem I had was them sticking together, but that was a fault on my part not the recipe. I still can't get over how easy the tempura was.

These were so tasty and delicious! We loved them!!  The only problems we had that they kept getting stuck together in clumps and I'm not sure how to fix that.  The dipping sauce is delicious too! Used splenda instead of sugar.

These were ABSOLUTELY wonderful! I could eat a whole plate of them!! I used Mich. Ultra...no sense in counting carbs, though. The dipping sauce was very complementary! I'll make these again and again!

Not great, not terrible.  I used a dark brown beer -- a light beer would probably work better.  Make sure veggies are completely dry before dunking in this very liquidy batter.

This is a great way to eat veggies! TOASTED sesame seeds are preferable. This simple dipping sauce is also a must have...I generally triple the amount. I have three bar-tending friends that ask me to make this @ the bar on each of their birthdays! Works good with sweet potatoes too!
