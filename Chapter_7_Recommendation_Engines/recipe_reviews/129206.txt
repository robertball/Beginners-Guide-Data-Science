This was very tasty, nice mix of sour, sweet, spicy.  We used it like a chutney alongsome some pork.  A nice, different use of the mango!

I thought this was really yummy and different.  It's spicy, limey, and sweet all at the same time.  I will make this again.  I think it would taste better after being refridgerated .

As a child growing up un a Mexican household, these tastes were very common -lemon and chili sprinkled on fruit, but you have taken this concept to a new level by boiling the liqiud and submeging the fruit to coat.  I must admit, I was hesitant about changing my "costumbre" but this was excellent. Thanks for sharing and tell your mother-in-law thanks also.

Wasn't sure of the amount of Chile powder. I expected it to be sweet still and it wasn't.

This was so good!  I made it in the morning, cooled it and put it in the refrig.  Then at dinner I just heated it up for a few seconds in the microwave.  Wish I had doubled the recipe.

I only wish you had described how to cut up the mango in the recipe. I didn't know how and tried to do it my self, thinking it couldn't be that hard and didn't really do the mango justice. After looking at u tube videos on how to dice a mango, I wish I had another mango to try again. Anyway, I also, was a little worried about all the chili powder but it was really good. Going to let my boyfriend try it tonight and see what he thinks. He likes spicy stuff. Thanks!

LOVED IT! I used less lemon, just to my taste. Super delicious, just what I was looking for, and will eat daily. Yum!

Tried this one for our Mexican food Thanksgiving this year.  I was able to save it by draining the liquid and adding quite a bit of brown sugar, but even then it didn't deserve a great rating.  WAY too much lemon juice made this so mouth puckering that no one wanted more than the first taste they took.  Sorry, but this one just didn't make it into our rotation.

Delicious.  Very nice change for a side dish.  Served it with steak and coconut shrimp.  Might not add as much water the next time.  Thanks for posting.

I liked this. I added the cucumbers as one reviewer had suggested. The crunch with the smooth mango was a nice contrast. I added lime wedges to the meal so I could add more citrusy taste at the table. Itâ€™s interesting.
