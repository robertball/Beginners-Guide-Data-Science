Not impressed.  I made exactly as stated except I omitted the walnuts.  Dry muffins that taste too much like the baking powder.  IF I were to try this again, I would cut down on the baking powder some and not cook them for 25 minutes.  This was way too long.

I found a recipe very close to this one on the Internet. It stated at the bottom that it came from Splenda web site. NOT, not even close. The recipe contains most of the same ingredients, but amounts and liquids are very different.
I have made the other version almost every week since I found it. They are not dry and I would imagine a few less calories. 
Try replacing the buttermilk with sugar free orange juice, (or with sugar like I do) and 1/4 cup sour cream. Oh an another thing that I found unusual, the Splendid was reduced to only 1/2 cup, yet there was enough sweetness to them.
