I find the taste of blueberries & greek yogurt to be a little strong, so I have a variation I like:  substitute 1 apple sliced in half for the blueberries and low fat plain yogurt for greek.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This had a very strange taste from the flax and almond flour which I did not like. I don't plan on making it again
