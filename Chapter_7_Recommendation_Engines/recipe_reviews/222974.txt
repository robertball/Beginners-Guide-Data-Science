So easy and yet so good! I seasoned three good sized chicken breasts with Goya's Adobo Seasoning and grilled them first. I took a bit of a short cut and used the microwave directions on the inside packet for the rice. I just added the chopped onion and green pepper to it and microwaved it according to the instructions. The last few minutes of cooking I threw in a can of diced tomatoes (drained). Once it was done, I sliced the chicken breast and added that along with some reduced fat cheddar cheese. Dinner was ready in no time! All I had to add was a garden salad.

This was very good. I did season with  some garlic and crushed red pepper for some kick. My family enjoyed this as well. I think next time I might just leave out the cheese altogether. It was good with cheese but I think it may be better without.

This is a wonderful recipe.  First time I've used Goya Yellow Rice, and I can't say enough about it, it simply tastes like the real deal.  No more Vigo, Goya is the brand I'll use moving forward.  This recipe is quick enough for a weeknight meal, and your family will love you for making this.  I agree with previous reviewers that the cheese really isn't necessary, I won't be using it the next time.  This one's going into my Favorites folder.

GOYA Adobo seasoning makes everything better, this dish was amazing and so quick to whip up!  I added in a can of shoepeg white corn and GOYA kidney beans...it makes a lot, but none went to waste :)

Quick and Easy meal. My kids helped me make it and 3 out of 4 liked it. My husband said this would be something good for lunches during the week.  I did sub an orange bell pepper over green because that is what I had on hand but no other substitutions or additions were made.

Flavorful, but needed some tweaking.  I sliced a sautéed chicken breast and served on top of the rice.  Rice mixture is salty.  Contains MSG and Yellow Dye No. 5.

I thought this was pretty good. I mostly have tried the Goya beans and this was my first time trying the boxed rice and even the Adobo seasoning. The Adobo seasoning, is very much in taste to me like a mix between garlic powder and garlic salt. I will definitely use it in other recipes. Using both items made for a very quick meal with seasoning built right in. I liked how this recipe also incorporated fresh tomatoes, a green pepper, and onion. The only thing is I really liked the chicken and rice before adding the cheese. It tasted more authentic to me and I am actually surprised I made a chicken and rice dish that looked like it took more time than it actually did to make. Possibly, the cheese makes it more kid friendly though. The second thing is, it was a little more salty than I normally make food. However, the Adobo seasoning amount says season to taste, and I may have just went too heavy handed on that. Either way, TY Goya for the quick and easy meal idea to get dinner on the table this week.

I used one can of Rotel instead of the regular tomatoes. I also added one can of black beans into my chicken and veggie mixture. When I combined everything at the end, I finished it in a 9 x 13 baking dish instead of on the stove. I sprinkled the cheese on top and baked it for 20 minutes at 350°. Loved it!

Not my favorite meal ever, but quick, easy, colorful and filling. I feel like the salt content was very high, but I found some low-sodium yellow rice that I'd like to try with. Also, I think changing the cheese (maybe pepper jack!) would kick it up another notch.

This really exceeded my expectations. Loved the Goya Yellow Rice.  Only (minor) change was I used a seasoning blend I already had along with a little black pepper instead of the Goya All-Purpose. Tasted just as good reheated over the next couple days.

I am really terrible about following recipes, but thought I would let you know what I did, and it turned out great. I cooked everything in one pot. I used the Goya seasoning sparingly because I didn't have much. I added Chicken Bullion when I boiled my chicken (also boiled the onion and peppers at the same time). After the chicken was cooked I cut it up and added it back into the pot to cook with the rice. I then added a can of corn and a small can of tiny peas. It was really good. This is an easy dish to play with if you don't have everything on hand. Kids loved it, and great for lunches the next day.

This was fantastic!! So simple and yet so flavorful. All 3 of us loved it at my house. My 8 year old kept saying, "Mom, this is one of the best recipes ever!" :) I used more chicken than what it called for and extra cheese. Of course, my boyfriend and I added Sriracha, but it was great even as is.

My husband is very picky about rice and I was hoping that the mixture of cheese, adobo seasoning and tomato would do it.  Score! he loved it.  We used our tomatoes fresh from the garden and it really jazzed up the yellow rice.

Chicken and rice are not staples in our diet, but this recipe intrigued me.  It's easy enough that it wasn't a bother to throw together my first day back to school AND it tasted great:  double win!  The only change I made was to use previously frozen/cooked shredded chicken I always try to keep in the freezer.  I simply seasoned the chicken and reduced *cook* time since I was merely reheating.  It smelled great and tasted awesome, too.  With tomatoes and peppers currently abundant in our garden, this may end up seeing repeat action at the LTH house!   (I froze some leftovers in individual portions for lunches; I'll try to remember to edit once I see if it works or not.)  THANKS, GOYA!

This was tasty.  I would have given it 5 stars but it is too salty for my taste.  Between the salt in the Adobo seasoning and the salt in the rice seasoning it is too much.  I would have been able to eat more than a very small portion even with the salt except I am very sensitive to MSG.  So, it tasted great and I am sure others will have no problems but people with dietary restrictions need to read the ingredients.  Oh, and I forgot to add the cheese, which would have made it saltier still.  I guess I only made Chicken and Yellow Rice.

We loved this recipe. I was short on time and this came together with minimal effort and a big payoff. sBeing vegan, I substituted Beyond Meat strips in place of chicken and for the cheese, used 1/4 cup nutritional yeast and just shy of 1/4 cup of vegan cheddar. I also used about a half can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes in place of fresh because I didn't have any fresh.

I really like this recipe due to its pretty easy and didn't take too long. Only thing I would change would not to add the cheese. It was good with the cheese, hubby and son loved it, but it tasted more "fresh " and lighter, less mushy without the cheese. Did add a little minced fresh garlic to the mix which was great. Overall a good weeknight recipe the family would love

This recipe came out excellent husband approved lol. I however used white rice instead of yellow rice because it's what I had on hand. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water for the rice. Other then that I followed the recipe. came out with excellent flavor. definitely would do this again.

I cooked brown basmati rice in chicken stock seasoned with turmeric and cumin. Great "yellow rice" without the MSG and salt.

Flavor was good, easy to make too.  Don't like that the rice mix has MSG and Yellow Dye.  I substituted fresh broccoli for the green pepper since we don't care for the green pepper.  Just gave it a sprinkling of cheese based on other reviews.

This was OK but the green pepper was too prominent for my taste. I think the Adobo tastes similar so the combination made that flavor take over the dish. If I make it again I would add garlic and probably use half a green pepper. I love cheddar cheese but I am not sure the cheese added much except fat and calories. I will taste it before adding it next time to see if it's really needed. That having been said, it was quick and easy and my kids liked it. You could use Bird's Eye Recipe Ready onion and green pepper combination to make it even quicker.

This is a tasty dish that is easy to prepare. I love that the recipe uses fresh veges!! I did make this in one pan by first cooking the chicken and veges as outlined in step 2 of the directions. I removed the chicken and veges to a plate when cooked through and proceeded to cook the rice (using the same pan) as outlined in step 1. I tasted this prior to adding the cheese and really liked it as is, but added the cheese thinking it makes everything better, right? In this case we actually liked it better without the cheese, surprisingly! I added the GOYA Adobo seasoning sparingly to the chicken because some other reviewers found the dish too salty, however, that was not the case for me and ended up adding some salt and pepper to the chicken after it was cooked. Be warned it does have msg so if you are allergic make your own spanish style rice.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It seemed like more of an American version of a Mexican dish, so I felt my family would try it first without complaining. It was delicious. I think the only thing I would do different next time will be to omit the tomatoes. It was all I tasted with the rice, and I felt it took away from the dish. Also, keep the Adobo seasoning. It really made the dish tasty and gave it a wonderful flavor. I also kept the cheese on the side, and I am glad that I did. My daughter who is obsessed with cheese wanted it, but the rest of us did not like it cheesy. Finally, my last complaint is that it doesn't make very much. For a family of 5, there were no leftovers at all. Usually we have a least a plate full for my husband to take to work in the morning. However, I guess this isn't too big of a problem seeing how it was very well received. I will be making this again with the changes. Also, that box of yellow rice is a hit! I will be buying more Goya products in the near future.

What can I say...another winning recipe from Goya(R)! This was so simple to make, and the end results were delicious. I did make a last minute decision to not add the cheese b/c I wanted a really authentic flavor, and the cheese didn't seem like it was needed, IMO..I will be making this again and often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a very flavorful dish.  I used yellow and orange peppers that I had on hand so it wasn’t as colorful as it could have been, but it was still very tasty.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as stated only I omitted the cheese. Really didn't need it unless you want a cheesy rice. Best yellow rice and chicken I've ever had!
