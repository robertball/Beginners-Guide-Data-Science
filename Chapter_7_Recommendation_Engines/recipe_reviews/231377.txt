Great dish for Enoki mushroom. But it's too eggy so I reduce the Eggs to two and add 1 cup of Flour and Water plus 2 tsp of Salt to make it into Chinese onion pancake. It was yummy!! My picky kids love it.

I really liked these. I used black pepper instead of white and I left some of my mushrooms in bigger pieces for presentation. I always top my eggs with hot sauce but without that I can see how these might be a little bland as others mentioned.  I personally liked these a lot. Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe as written. I found it to be a bit bland, so I probably won't make it again. It needs something.

Amazing! There is a little bit too much cholesterol but still, it was great!
