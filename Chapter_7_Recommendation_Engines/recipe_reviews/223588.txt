Wow, tender meat falls right off the bone. Very flavorful. Didn't add the sugar and it was delightful just the same!  Gathered some fresh chard from the garden, sauteed with garlic and served with the chicken instead of bok choy.  Perfect! Entire family loved it.

This was quite sour.  My first bite, I actually coughed as I swallowed the sour sauce, and my husband and 4 kids looked up at me expectantly....not wanting to taint their view, I said, "it's a bit hot (temperature-wise.)"  My 2-year-old said, "sour" about 20 times while she was eating it.  If I make this again, I'll do half chicken broth and half vinegar, just to cut down on the sour taste.  My friend who lived in the Philippines for 2 years liked it and said that's the way chicken adobo is.  I didn't serve it with rice (but with bread) so that probably made it seem more sour.  Safeway was out of bok choy, so I used kale and red cabbage, which turned out well (probably healthier than bok choy, too.)

This was a fantastic recipe and I'll make it again! I changed it a tad by adding in 2 Tbsps brown sugar and a cup of water. The chicken just fell apart it was so tender. I also served rice with diced avocado. It was a hit!

Good recipe, I only added 1/4 cup cider vinegar. Don't stir or touch the whole pot ,about 20-30 mins. until vinegar has evaporated, so no vinegary taste.Let it cook until it falls off the bone. Best served with rice!

I scaled this down to one serving and made it in my smallest slow cooker with just two thighs. 5 minutes was perfect for the bok choy. Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe.

This is a fabulouse recipe and easy.  I made rice with it because there is so much flavorful juice.  I recommend this anytime and is great for a covered dish dinner.

YUM!  Only change I made, based on some reviews, was to reduce vinegar to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup chicken broth.  My husband doesn't like too much vinegar flavor but he said that it was just right.  I LOVE vinegar flavor and I could barely detect it.  Served over rice.  Ate leftovers over rice and added dollop of sour cream and hot sauce 2 days running.  Will make again - husband wants to try it with regular cabbage rather than bok choy, but he's a cabbage nut!  Thanks!

Extremely easy, healthy, and tasty. Throw everything in the slow cooker and you're done! My husband and I make slow cooker dinners about three times a week and we often try recipes that end up lacking in flavor, but we really liked this one.

Really tasty, light, easy meal.  Very different taste with all of the vinegar.  The bok choy is a nice touch, and I used a bit more.

I served it with brown rice and a salad.  Kiddos even approved.  Will make this one again.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I had 12 chicken thighs so that is what I cooked but without increasing the other ingredients.  Oh, and I can't get bok choy here so I used swiss chard.  Don't forget the green onions at the end - they make a big difference!  I had lots of sauce at the end so I decided to thicken it up just a little bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was going to be to sour because I had read other reviews, but it really wasn't. The vinegar taste was very subtle. I did use 10 pieces of chicken instead of 8. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. But the chicken literally fell off the bone, and the bok choy was so awesome. Served it with brown rice. Will DEFINITELY make this again and again and again.

We love this recipe! The only thing I do differently is to put all the ingredients except the bok Choy and green onions in a Ziploc and let marinate all day then bake in the oven instead of using a slow cooker. All I have to say to my daughter is that I'm making her favorite chicken and she's sure to be home for dinner!

This was really good. I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I added 2 TSP of BS after reading that it was sour.  Other than that, meat fell off the bone.  Lots of liquid tho. I wish that my pot wasn't so full bc I would have doubled the bok choy.  So I added one whole bok and about half of a small purple cabbage.  I served it with smoked basmati rice.  Delish!

love this dish! I've attempted to make adobo a few times but it always turned out sour because of too much vinegar. This has the right amount of vinegar. I used a different type of bok choy called yuchoy. The only vegetable close enough to bok choy. It was still so good. I will make this over and over again!

The adults enjoyed this recipe. 7 year old's only complaint was that she didn't like the bok choy. Did find there was quite a bit of liquid...didn't have time to thicken it up. Loved the flavors though!

Followed the recipe. Served over brown rice.  Very Good.  Only change I would make is use boneless chicken.  May try boneless chicken breasts next time but the thighs added great flavor!!!

Good paleo recipe.  A couple of changes: used boneless thighs, substituted honey for the brown sugar, added mushrooms. Easy and tasty.

This was delicious.  I made a half batch and cooked it for 6 hours and it was perfect.  I think at 8 hours the meat would separate from the bone and the chicken would fall apart.  I used a meat thermometer and the chicken was well cooked at 6 hours.  It might need a bit longer with a larger batch, but not too much more.

This was easy, and I made it as directed with the only alteration being I let the mixture cook on high after adding the bok choy for about 30 min, and after 15, mixed it into the liquid to wilt it.  I also added a little corn starch to thicken the liquid into more of a gravy.  I used smoked chipotle paprika which kicked up the heat!  Family loved it, I would not say it was sour or spicy as some reviewers did, we thought the tanginess was good.  Will make again!

It is delicious.  I loved the taste of the gravy, it had a nice asian taste.  The only changes I made was using 1 1/2 times the ingredients to have more sauce to almost cover the chicken and used two heads of Bok Choy.  After putting in the sliced two heads of Bok Choy at the end, the large oval crock pot was full to the lid.  After about 30 min the Bok Choy cooked down nicely and it also added a little more liquid to the pot.  I added pics.  The gravy was not sour at all.  Loved it.

I don't know what flavor my family was expecting, but this was not a keeper. The meat was nice and tender, looked like pulled pork or shredded barbecue after it was done. But the taste was not something they cared for.

The 5 stars tells it all.  Made exactly as written.  No one thought the vinegar was strong - the whole family of 5 lapped it up.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I will attempt this recipe again, however next time I will half the vinegar and add the rest in chicken broth.  The vinegar was too much.  The chicken fell off the bone and was very tender and moist.  And, the recipe was very easy.

I did mine with napa and chicken breast and reduced vinegar to a 1/2 cup. I did add some ginger root, sliced carrot, and sliced zuchinni with the napa at end. I served this over white rice and it's that sour sauce that comes through. Next time I will make this with chicken thighs.

What a delicious and comforting recipe! I put it in the crock pot before I left on Saturday morning to visit my mom and sister, returned home and put my feet up after adding the Bok Choy and starting some rice. When the food was ready, I removed the chicken to a platter, added some thickener to the broth and bok choy and then put everything out like a buffet.  We all put rice in our bowls, ladled broth and bok choy over it and lay the chicken on top. I also put out soy sauce and red pepper flakes in case we wanted to add them to our individual dishes. It was so good we got stuffed!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was really sour. The apple cider vinegar overpowered the spices so much you couldn't taste them. If I made this again it would be with rice vinegar mixed with chicken broth and I would add more spices.

Not a bad recipe, just needs more to it. Next time I will add more veggies and see how that goes.

Excellent.  Added carrot and mushrooms to up veggie content.  Used less vinegar after reading reviews.  Next time I will also add chilli.  So easy, will be a regular for us.

Easy, tasty and different.  I added green beans because that's what I had. Shows you that you can probably use anything green... definitely goes great with rice.

This was a hit for myself and the family.  I will definitely be doing it again.  I served it over white rice and it was an excellent full meal that was very easy to do.  The only change I made was I used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs.  It worked out just fine.

I use leftover pickle juice (instead of apple cider vinegar) plus a little sugar to tone down the tartness. I also add a whole leek and waterchestnuts

this was very tasty and the vinegar wasn't overpowering to us.. i only cooked it for 4 hours which was plenty to get the chicken fall off the bone tender.. i cut this in half and used 3 thighs and 1 drumstick.. left out the brown sugar and green onion.. subbed regular cabbage for the bok choy and left it in there for longer than 5 min's to cook.. idk how long it was but i thought it was more like 15-20 mins to get it tender.. took everything but the liquid out of the crockpot and stirred in some pasta and let it cook/soak everything up.. me and bf were very happy with the meal.. ty for the recipe

I tried this for the first time tonight.  Stuck to the recipe except that I cooked it on high for 4 hours instead of low for 8 hours.  It turned out great--so easy to make, delicious with rice.  The kids loved it.

The vinegar taste was too strong.  Had to add 2 more tablespoons of sugar to balance the flavours and make it palatable.  I've made Adobo chicken with a Filipino friend before, and it didn't taste like the Adobo chicken in this recipe.

My 1 year old loves this chicken, which surprised me.  I like it prepared according to the recipe but some people might want to add more brown sugar if they find the apple cider vinegar overwhelming.

This was great! I put just a little less vinegar bc of what ppl stated but other then that I only changed things by adding some extra veggies I had on hand..carrots and celery. Even my 3 year ate it and nearly cleared her bowl clean.

Very tasty! My first bok choy recipe and I love it. The bok choy took longer to cook after being added, almost an hour on high. The chicken was very tender and slightly sweet, falling off the bone but I cooked it on high the whole time and used a whole chicken instead of thighs. The vinegar was hardly noticeable, not sure why others are saying too vinegary but my chicken produced a LOT of juice so perhaps mine was diluted some. I will make this again :)

This was so easy to make! I was a little scared when I saw 8 hours cooking time, but I programmed my slow cooker by temperature, not by time, and the chicken was up to 165 degrees in just over 4 hours on low. It was very tender, and I was surprised at what a sweet taste the chicken, and especially the onions, had! I would definitely make rice next time to put this over. There is so much sauce, and it's too thin to eat without something else to absorb it. I suspect adding some apples in the slow cooker would be a great addition to this recipe. I'll try that next time!

Super easy recipe to follow. I’m not eating onions so I used celery instead of onions and the dish tasted great. I thought it would be super hot with the paprika- this was not the case.

This was good! My whole family enjoyed it. I did take some other reviewers’ advice and only used 1/2 cup of the vinegar. I also used 1/2 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/3 and added an extra tablespoon of the brown sugar. I used LOTS of black pepper. I also used boneless thighs. My crockpot cooks super fast, so I only had to cook it 5 hours, until the chicken started to break apart. It has a nice tang, not too overpowering. It’s amazing the flavor with so few ingredients. Will make again.

This was so easy to make! Everyone in my family loved this dish, including the teens, personally I found it a little salty but I don't think I would change anything.  I used gai lan instead of bok choy so I left it in about 20 minutes instead of the 5 minutes for bok choy.  Made brown rice to go with it.

Very good recipe! I used two TBL brown sugar to cut the acidity and I like more paprika so would double it in future or use a different blend than what I had on hand.

Loved it! Served it with an awesome citrus kale salad and cauliflower rice. Flavors complemented each other nicely. Easy meal and very satisfying.

I ran across this recipe and locked in on the bok choy ingredient which I had and really needed to cook or use in a salad.  Score!  All the other ingredients were on hand so it was destined to become dinner.  Then discovered I only had 2 big fat thighs in the freezer.  No problem, I could still pull this off, right?  Then I realized my crock pot was on a shelf in the garage but the Instant Pot was handy.  So I guessed at 1/4 of the seasonings except for using an entire large yellow onion.  (I'm not a committed hard fast measurer).  Also, went easy on the vinegar per other reviews.  I filled the pot with onion and seasonings and set the thawed thighs on top with a full teaspoon of paprika sprinkled over them.  I set the IP on Slow Cook and put a lid on it.  After about 4 hours I opened the IP, added a full cup of long grain rice with about a half cup of water.  Then changed the setting to Rice cooker.   I had to run an errand and got back to the IP about 45 mins later.  I was starved so spooned a healthy serving and let me tell you, this is delicious!  Now, if I had only remembered to add the darn bok choy...  Oh well, I can add the bok choy to the leftovers.  :)  Obviously, this recipe cannot be messed up, although I could have added less rice with only two thighs.  I will make it many more times and especially for company!!  Great sauce and great flavor.

Our family enjoyed it over rice. I thought it was just a bit tangy but no one else did. It was my first time using this recipe so I followed it without deviation. There were no leftovers!

I only used half a large purple onion, rice vinegar instead of apple cider and added 4 tbsp. of brown sugar. Turned out amazing!

I made this as written using boneless skinless chicken thighs., cooking it for 6 hours. I did not add the bock choy. I served it over rice. It was WONDERFUL! My hubby raved about it, and the sauce was very tasty. It seemed that the sweetness of the onions blended perfectly with the tang of the cider vinegar. I’ll gladly make this frequently.

This was good, but a little on the bland side.  Used the 1/2 cup apply cider vinegar and 1/2 cup chicken broth option.  Thought it was a little bland.  Will try to spice up a little next time, maybe with some sweet red chili sauce.

This was really good. I did tweak a few things. Doubled the brown sugar, added a cup of water, and only used 1/2 cup of vinegar.

I made this exactly as written, and everyone in my family really liked it. well, actually I did saute the garlic before putting it in the Crock-Pot. I find that raw garlic doesn't work in the Crock-Pot very well.

I thought this adobo recipe was just ok and don't know if Filipino Chicken Adobo is an ideal slow cooker recipe in general; or necessary as it doesn't take that long to cook it in a traditional way.  This recipe also needed more garlic and bay leaves; and I recommend a 1/2 a tablespoon of whole black peppercorns. I'd also drop the onions. Any way...look up a traditional Filipino Adobo recipe where the meat is cooked in a rolling boil for about 45 minutes-1 hour and compare.

Did everything as stated except we used boneless chicken breasts. Since there were no bones in chicken I cooked for 4 hours instead of the 8. I wanted to toss it out, but hubby said he'd eat it this time, but he wished he hadn't later because the bok choy bloated both of us bad. We love bok choy salad, but not this way. The chicken didn't have much flavor, but the juice tasted fairly good over rice. Won't be making this again.

I didn't have time to cook this for 8 hours so I cooked it on high for about 5, and only used 1/2 cup of vinegar because that's all I had. My golly, but this was tasty!  I will be sure to make it again as written.

This was great as written. The vinegar made it tangy-- maybe it matters which vinegar you use (or personal taste). Great recipe that I'll be making again.

Took advise of others and used 1/2 cup of vinegar and remaining water. Followed recipe otherwise. Don't know if I would make again but it was edible. It did remind me how much I liked Bok Choy.

i do not like giving unfavorable reviews. This call for way to much vinegar,it overpowered the dish and i only used about 4 tbsp. there was no flavor to this dish. It  basically 
is boiled chicken. I gave it two  stars for ease.
Will not make again.

It was too salty. My son had only one bite. I reduced apple slider vinegar for half amount and add chicken broth like someone suggested.

I loved this recipe! Wasn’t to sour at all in my opinion it had just the right amount of twang. Definitely will make again and keep the recipe as is

Delicious recipe! The chicken falls right apart. Just make sure to use less of the vinegar and add more vegetables such as mushrooms or broccoli to make it more interesting. :)

Super easy. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I just used rice vinegar and added 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar extra to try to make it a sweeter taste instead of too tangy. Chicken fell off the bones, good stuff!

Hard to believe with three steps I made a mistake, but I'm sure I did. In adding the bok choy at the end I put it on top of the chicken and it took a lot longer than 5 minutes to cook. I'm thinking I should have removed the chicken then added the bok choy and then put the chicken on top. Any thoughts on what I *should have* done?

I reduced the vinegar to 1/3 c based on other reviews. Used frozen bone in and skin on chicken thighs that were done at 4 hours on low in the crockpot. The sauce was a bit thin and greasy but boyfriend enjoyed the punchy hit of vinegar. I added boiled eggs for about half hour to steep in the marinade, made a nice additional component to this simple dish :)

I used white wine instead of vinegar and it was awesome.  Had just enough bite to it but not as much as with vinegar.  Did use on Bok Choy because I love it.  Also served with white rice. Thanks.

My family liked it.  I personally thought it was too vinagery. But that might be because of the white sugar I used instead of brown sugar.  I don't like meat that is sweet so I used less as well.  It also tried to burn so I stirred it a few times. Also it needed more bok choy and onion.

I used peppercorns, rather than ground black pepper, and omitted the bay leaf.  I thought it was good, and my husband loved it (a surprise, since he rarely likes entrees with a sweet note).  Another time, I would up the garlic.

Very easy and tasty.  My husband loved it.  I used low salt soy, so I added a bit more.  I did not need 8 hours.   I made 4 thighs and 5 hours was perfect.  Fell right off the bone, but not mushy

No changes first time through, except I used boneless chicken breasts.  Super easy and healthy.  Everyone liked it as is, over brown rice. The onions are delicious. It's tangy, but not overwhelming.

I made this a few weeks ago.    But cut down on the vinegar.   I really liked it.  Especially the crispness of the bok chop.   Am going to make it today, but plan on using Ponzi Sauce instead of soy sauce and the correct amount of vinegar.  Will check back.

Left the skin on the thighs, ommitted the brown sugar, otherwise followed the recipe.  Thighs were done (overdone) after only 5 1/2 hours. Kinda mushy. Not enough liquid, meat was sitting on a rack of onions above the seasoning liquid, was nearly tasteless. Plus side, smelled good while cooking, wasn't vinegary, I used Apple cider vinegar and the Bok Choy was a great addition.  Adobo is like chili, there's as many variations as there are cooks, think I'll stick to stovetop versions but thanks for the recipe.

I didn't make any changes.  I thought it was a little too tangy and didn't have much depth of flavor.  No Umami.  Maybe some ginger should be added or a little heat but I will not make it again.  Of course the meat is tender-it was cooked in a crockpot for 8 hours! You can't give it 5 stars just because the meat is tender.

Made this with a couple of changes. Instead of waiting 8 hours, I seasoned the thighs with adobo seasoning, let those sit while I did the prep work on the onions and garlic. Then I sauteed the thighs for 3 minutes per side in 2 batches. I had my pressure/slow cooker on "Keep Warm" so I tossed those in as they finished. 

Then I sauteed the onion and garlic in the skillet used for the chicken. After 5 minutes, I threw in 1/2 cup red wine to deglaze the pan and poured all that into the cooker. Set the pressure cooker to low pressure for 20 minutes.

When time was up, I vented and set it to slow cook for 30 minutes, added the bok choy and returned the cover with the vent open. After 30 minutes the thickest parts of the bok choy were not cooked so I turned it to  saute until they looked cooked through.

It was very good and not bitter. I did made some changes. I my slow cooker (made of ceramic) I sprayed olive oil on the sides/bottom, then placed 1 tbsp of unsalted butter. place slow cooker at buffet till butter melted. then added the sweet  onions, then garlic. Changed temp. to simmer. After 40mins., added a little bit of white wine. while that is simmering, I prepared the chicken smothered with paprika and pepper. Then prepared the veggies (added 2 Leeks) and then the sauce. Changed the temp. to low for 5-6. I did every 2 hours checked and/or mix it. I made steamed 3-rices (Brown/Jasmine/Balsamic).

Good, simple dish.  Recommend a low sodium soy sauce.

Delicious - just finished a second helping. I used boneless thighs, smoked paprika, baby bok choy, and a little less brown sugar.

Will make again.

I found it to be on the bland side. I will make this again but with more vinegar and seasonings.

Very easy and good recipe. I did put it over rice which was even better with the extra sauce. It would be better with extra Bok Choy-I made it with boneless chicken thighs and it was great.

Meat did fall off the bone and the bok choy turned out well but overall we found this sour tasting and not worth making again.

My granddaughter and I both loved this.  So easy and so yummy.  Bok choy  is one of my favorite vegetables so I have been using it a lot and this recipe did not disappoint!

Made this for a week of lunches last week, and it was a really big hit with my boyfriend. We actually used the remaining liquid from the slow cooker to make some rice with to help fill out the lunches, and it was an excellent way to eat each day.

The vinegar was too strong for me. Decreasing the vinegar and increasing the sugar might help but I wont make it again.

Followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT used boneless skinless thighs. Will cut down the time a little next time with boneless and up it to the recipe for bone in. This was a fantastic meal. DH really loved it and we will make this one again.

Easy, tender chicken. I will add another bay leaf and black peppercorns for a little more flavor next time. I substituted rice vinegar (was out of apple cider vinegar) and that might also have made it less flavorful. Trying to match the Adobo from my favorite Filipino food truck! I'll be trying this again for sure!

Not too crazy about this recipe. I'm not a big fan of any vinegar so it was a little too tangy for me. I gave the recipe a second try by reducing the amount of vinegar but it still didn't rock my world.

I prepared everything for this recipe the night before, and threw it all in the slow cooker in the morning.  I found it to be a refreshing slow cooker recipe, as I find that many start to taste the same after a while.  I enjoyed the tangy flavour, and the bok choy added some great texture.  The only change I made was that I used boneless, skinless rather than bone-in chicken thighs.  I will make this again when I'm in the mood for something a bit different.

Has a somewhat dark taste. The vinegar shines through more than you'd think.

I followed this recipe as indicated. The chicken was dry. My sauce wasn't sour like others have said. If it hadn't been for the dry chicken and the taste of the bok choy maybe my family would have eaten it. I will probably not make this again.

This is advertised as a Paleo dish.  Soy sauce is not Paleo-friendly.
