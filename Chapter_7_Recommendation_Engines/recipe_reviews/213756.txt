The important thing with this recipe is to make sure your avocados are very ripe and to make sure you have medium avocados.  I've made it before with very large avocados and it came out gooey. (We actually used that batch to melt pieces of it into milk for the most amazing, creamy hot cocoa!)  And if your avocados are too tiny it will be harder as one reviewer found.  If all your grocery store has is very small avocados I might use 2 1/2 or 3.  PLEASE NOTE:  IF YOU SEE GREEN IN YOUR FUDGE AT ALL THEN YOU HAVE NOT MADE THIS RECIPE CORRECTLY!!!  The avocado should be FULLY incorporated and the fudge should be completely smooth with no lumps.

I made this recipe for our Saint Fatness Day party this weekend, and it came out great! I made sure most people tried it before asking them to guess the secret ingredient. People were guessing raisins, dates, nuts, etc. and then someone finally said "avocado?" and I couldn't help but grin. The only difficult part was blending the avocados, because one wasn't ripe enough. It is critical to use ripe avocados for this! Mixing in the cocoa was a bit challenging, but surprisingly became easier as the confectioner's sugar was added. The fudge became very dark and thick in the end, and I used an 8x8 pan with wax paper instead of a 9x11. I refrigerated the fudge overnight, and then ran the bottom of the glass pan under hot water and used a spatula to get it! The Irish cream (I used Bailey's) gives it a great flavor!

Wow, I am amazed that this works! I halved the recipe as a trial run, but I will definately make a whole batch next year. The slightly Irish Cream flavor is very unique, but my favorite part is that it uses avocado instead of marshmallow cream, AND you don't need a candy thermometer. I also like that it uses cocoa powder instead of a ton of chocolate chips. I can tell you grew up outside of the US and have learned to adapt to available ingredients! Thanks a lot!

The texture of this fudge is very creamy which makes it quite good. However, - fiund it entirly too sweet. I will nake this again with half the confectioner's sugar.

This was well received at our St. Patrick's Day pot luck.  It was a little bit more gooey than I would have expected from a fudge - more like a very thick frosting.  Still, it held its shape for the most part, and tasted good.  You can't taste the avocado at all - avocado has such a mild flavor that it really enhances other flavors well.  There's so much cocoa and chocolate in this that the green color was completely eliminated.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and didn't use the last cup of powdered sugar and it was perfectly sweet.  It was quite a workout trying to stir in the sugar and cocoa powder.  The mixture never got smooth and I was concerned it wouldn't turn out, but after a few hours in the refrigerator it turned into a creamy fudge.  You can't taste the avocado at all, but it does create a festive swirly green layer on top.festive swirly green layer on top.

I have been baking for a while, but this was my first attempt at fudge.  I tried another recipe where a vegetable was the 'secret' and main ingredient, but it didn't turn out so well.... Thankfully, this Avocado Irish Cream Fudge redeemed me.  You can't tastes or even tell that there is avocado in this at all.  And the Irish cream is barely noticeable- just a hint of flavor; I wouldn't have known it was in there except that I made it (which is good because I don't like alcohol).
As others have noted, it is imperative to fully blend the avocado.  I don't have an immersion blender, so I used my regular ol' blender plus an electric mixer, and that worked fine.  (I'm sure the immersion blender does a better job, though.)  Also as others have said, a fully ripe avocado is necessary for this recipe to be the right consistency.  Finally, I found that you really need to be sure that the fudge heats enough.  I failed to leave it on the stove top for long enough (or perhaps the heat was too low), so it came out kind of grainy.  On my second try heating the fudge long/high enough, there was much improvement: though I will probably use less sugar next time because the texture was still somewhat grainy, I felt.  All in all, a great dessert and one I will make again.

this creates more of a dough than a fudge in the end it tells you to pour it into a pan but dump is more the word,  there is just not enough liquid in it to make a nice creamy fudge.

Very Yummy!  Mine came out too wet, but it may have been the size of my avocados.  Tastes great :)
