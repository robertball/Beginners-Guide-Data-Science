The first time I made this, I used regular vodka, vanilla extract and a little almond essence. It was so good, I decided to buy all the proper ingredients. Holy cow, what a night cap! Delicious! I also think the amount of alcohol was perfect. Thanks so much, Gordon!

Maybe a little more chocolate needed - was really good, though. I don't like drinks that you can taste the alcohol in it, but this was very smooth and it was just tasty, not alcohol-y.

We made our hot chocolate from scratch (recipe on the Droste box)instead of instant so, our cocoa was super yummie, smooth and rich without any alcohol at all. We really liked the recipe here, but thought the amaretto was a bit overpowering. After cutting the amount in half and keeping the vanilla vodka the same we liked it even better!

We used the "Creamy Hot Cocoa" from this website (minus the half and half).  Make sure that you remember that a shot is 2 ounces, so you're putting a half a shot of each...some people think a shot is 1oz.  Also, make sure your mug is big enough or the booze can be overpowering.  The TASTE is out of this world. ;-)

Didn't have the Vodka, so I used all Ameretto, and added 1/2 teaspoon of Van. extract. I also made this with 6oz milk and 3 teaspoons hot cocoa.

This is really good. I used Starbucks mint hot chocolate and soy milk. I didn't have any vanilla vodka so I just stirred a little vanilla extract in after I added the vodka and amaretto. Great afternoon treat in the winter!

Very good, but I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to tasting alcohol in my mixed drinks. I didn't like how strong the amaretto was, so I tried again with half the amount. PERFECT! Topped with a dollop of French Vanilla Cool-Whip - yum! Thanks :)

This was delicious!!!  I have made it every year for our neighborhood Christmas round robing and always get requests for the recipe.  I do, however, cut down on the amount of vodka as I do not like to taste liquor in my drinks.

This was delicious. It was the perfect amount of alcohol. I mixed whole milk and 2% milk and it came out frothy and yummy.

This drink was delicious! The alcohol concentrations were perfect for both my husband and myself; however, I followed the instructions on the instant cocoa that I used and doubled the amount of cocoa. I also used a high quality cocoa, not the stuff reserved for the kids, and heated the milk on the stove stirring in the cocoa and finally the alcohol just before serving. I followed with a healthy portion of full fat whipped cream, SO delicious! Thank you! We will now look forward to snow days so long as we can follow up shoveling with Moscow Hot Chocolate!

Very nice mix of alcohol with the right amount of chocolate.  We added a dollop of whip cream on the top for an extra treat.

I drink this without the vodka.  The amaretto is SOOO YUMMY!! I like putting whipped cream on top, too.

I just made a cup of this and am currently drinking it. This is really good! The alcohol isn't over powering at all, it's just the right mix. Will certainly make more of this (regretting the giant bottle of vanilla vodka a lot less right now).

Have to wait until bedtime to try (hubby says I can get drunk on scotch tape, so best wait until feet are under the covers!).  Now...if only the cup pictured was an Oregon Duck cup! ;-)

We were snowed in and I was looking for a grown up hot drink to warm us up using ingredients I happened to have on hand. I did use regular vodka and added a few drops of pure vanilla extract. Yummy!

A little too much vodka for me in this drink, but otherwise it's a nice little change from cold mixed drinks.  I'll halve the vodka next time.  Thanks!

I used my homemade mocha mix in this recipe. My throat is killing me and I just wanted something to soothe not only my throat, but my jangled nerves. Very nice.

Delicious on a snowy January night!  Used Tito's vodka, Disaronno and a splash of vanilla extract.  One-and-a-halved the recipe and used a full envelope of dark chocolate hot chocolate mix for about 9 oz. of hot drink.

I didn't have any amaretto liqueur, so maybe that's why this didn't taste good.  I measured out the amount of vanilla vodka, hot cocoa mix and hot milk, but the vodka taste was overpowering.  I even topped with whipped cream, but it was still not that great.  If I try this again, I would only use a smidge of vodka.

Awesome!  I've made this twice now.  You can modify it to your taste.  The second time I made it in a huge 10 oz coffee mug and used 1 oz vanilla vodka, 1 oz Amaretto, 3-4 TB hot chocolate mix, and 8 oz hot milk.  Then top with marshmallows.  It is so creamy and good!
