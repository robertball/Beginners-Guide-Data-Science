Delicious, zingy and with so few ingredients! I made 1/4 recipe and used it on a homemade chicken Bahn Mi burger (Vietnamese), and it went well with it. This is a very versatile sauce that would go good with crabcakes, fish tacos, as a sandwich spread, just about anything. Thanks for the easy and very tasty recipe!

I just made this recipe and I love it!! I did however add 3 more tablespoons of siracha, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, those where just for my taste preference but to me it took this already good recipe over the top and beyond!

Loved this with crab cakes!  I made 1/4 of the recipe.  I didnâ€™t have lime juice so I used lemon, but just a little, probably less than a teaspoon.  I find if I don't go easy on the lemon juice it becomes way too tart for me.  I also added a tiny pinch of salt.  The sriracha gives this just a little bit of heat, but not too much.

This is so good I could eat it by the spoonful. I did add some minced garlic and a bit more Sriracha. Thanks for posting your recipe.

This  is Great for that aioli that needs that extra kick ...... I add in addition to the sriracha sauce, chili garlic sauce and  sriracha spicy seasoning, I change it up depending on what's being made and might use cayenne pepper instead of the spicy seasoning. Awesome easy sauce. Just to add, used this Aioli for pulled pork sandwiches ...... perfect!

You can't really go wrong with this aioli recipe. All three ingredients are to taste. I sub the srirachi sauce out for  Huy Fong's chili garlic sauce for more texture and kick. For me, this is getting into Cane's sauce territory. I made this originally for a grilled corn on the cob recipe, but now I eat it on everything - hard boiled eggs, asparagus, my finger, etc.

So easy and tasty!  We add some garlic.  And also, a higher ratio of siracha to mayo, cuz we like it spicy!  Yum, this is a go-to for us, with fish tacos -

Thanks so much for this - I was searching for recipes similar to chipotle mayo (no chipotles here) and found this. Had these ingredients on hand and it was delicious. Not sure what measurements I used, I just added siracha until I thought the color was good! We put this on shrimp tacos tonight and it was perfect.

You can never go wrong with sriracha. If you can't stand the heat of this sauce just reduce the amount you add because this aioli is spicy hot. My family devoured it fast.

01.23.17 ~ Three ingredient goodness. Made this along with 'Chipotle Aioli' from AR for burgers and sweet potato fries. Loved the kicked that this gave the burgers. Used the leftovers for cold meat wraps for lunches. This was a great find.

I added more lime juice and hot sauce for more kick.

This was very quick and easy with a good flavor that really complemented our "aloha tacos" (teriyaki chicken, pineapple pico de gallo, and sriracha mayo). Like others, I did use lemon juice instead of lime since that's what I had on hand.

this was a nice, simple dipping sauce.. i doubled the lime, added a couple more tsp's of sriracha, and a little salt.. but i think it all comes down to personal preference.. this is great for low carb.. ty for the recipe

Simple to make, great taste. would be awesome dipping sauce for fish sticks (coming from our 12 year old) and also French fries. We did add cracked pepper and used lemon juice as we did not have limes. Next time we will try adding Old Bay since we live in Baltimore. Thanks.
