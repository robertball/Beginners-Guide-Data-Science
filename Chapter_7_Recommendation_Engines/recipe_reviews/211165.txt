Excellent! We love these. Followed the recipe, using canned organic pumpkin, mini chocolate chips and baked them in mini muffin tins. I used a small ice-cream scoop and just layered the two mixtures (did not swirl). The bake time was approx 23 min in my oven. At 18 minutes, I sprinkled additional mini choc chips and chopped walnuts on top and returned to the oven for the last 5 minutes. Perfect, delicious little bites that definately taste like autumn. By not swirling the two batters together, I think the pumpkin flavor really came through. Perfectly spiced, moist, and slightly dense. We really enjoyed these and will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a delicious fall brownie. I admit I am partly responsible for authoring this recipe, but I don't think I've had a better brownie, and my girlfriend has made some serious brownies in the past. Using her already deliciously moist and dense brownie recipe as a base, the pumpkin component makes this easily the moistest baked good I've ever had. It's exactly what you'd get if a brownie and a slice of pumpkin pie had a baby.

These are incredible! I've made them 3 times since the end of October, and i am not usually a chocolate/brownie "person"...although i LOVE pumpkin desserts! The first time i made them i followed the directions exactly (except i omitted the walnuts and added ground ginger to the pumpkin half). When i added the cocoa to the the one half, it became sooo thick i could just barely spread it. And when i added the pumkin to the other half, it became very runny and there was TONS. Made the layering process a little tricky! HOWEVER they turned out absolutely amazing, if not a little cake-like. The next time i made them, i split the base batter unevenly so there was a little more batter for the chocolate half. Both halves were much easier to work with this way ( i added slightly more cocoa powder/pumpkin puree too.). In an emergency i had put them in the fridge to cool the second time i made them, and when i tried one it was MUCH chewier than the first batch which was a pleasant surprise! Maybe due to the cooling process? ANYway, these are one of the best desserts i've ever had, and one of the only things i've baked where i just can't seem to mess them up! A winner for sure ( And wonderful for impressing people ;-D  ) !!

These things are evil!!! I can feel my pants getting tighter! I used half oil & half butter, because I recently saw on America's Test Kitchens that oil helps to make a chewier brownie. I minimally swirl them, so I get distinct flavors of pumpkin & chocolate.  Did I mention these things are evil?! Next time I am going to sprinkle some chocolate chips & nuts on the top. I have to go and eat another one.

I made these brownies for our church's food booth at a local pumpkin farm.  They were the hit of the day.  I took orders for more and had to bake them the following weeks for the sale again.  Since some reviews stated it was too cakey, I used only 2 eggs instead of 3 and I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the 3 spices because that is what I had on hand.  Each time I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan(so then I used 4 eggs and only used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice).  These brownies are scrumptious and so perfect for a fall dessert!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Sooooo good!! I added a little less butter, a little more cocoa, half chocolate, half butterscotch chips, a little more of the spices, and reduced the cooking time to about 35-40 minutes and they were perrrfect-- Moist and rich and soo flavorful. Definitely try!

HELPFUL TIP:  My oven tends to be a tad fast, but even so... I can't imagine using the full bake time!! Be sure to check on it.  It only took mine 33 min to finish.  Absolutely love these :)  I do think adding a heaping amount cocoa powder is a must!

I LOVED these brownies! I think next time I make them I might cut down on some of the butter because the pumpkin acts as a moistner as well so the brownies were a touch on the greasy side, but they were delicious none the less.

GREAT recipe.  Flavors are perfect together. Only thing is (and many people mentioned this) that the chocolate batter is really thick while the pumpkin batter is thin. Not a problem except for spreading and swirling.  I even put more "batter" in with the chocolate mixture, didn't help much.  I ended up just doing chocolate on the bottom and pumpkin on top, swirled a little and poured a little caramel sauce over. Yum!

My family loved these brownies and they now ask for them on a regular basis.  I double the recipe and bake them in a 9x13 pan.  Always moist and delicious!  The only change I make is to use half the amount of cloves it calls for.  Thanks for this unique recipe for brownies!

Yummy. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because my boys say they're a little too spicy (the clove I think). Nice quick recipe.

These are delicious.  I haven't made any changes to it in regards to ingredients. The only thing I did change is instead of making layers, I pour the whole chocolate batter in the bottom and then the whole pumpkin batter on the top. I still make the swirling motions with a fork. I did try the layers once before and the chocolate layer is just to sticky and dense to be spread evenly on top of the pumpkin batter.  I am addicted to these though. Perfect holiday brownies.

I followed this recipes just as it is stated and it turned out wonderfully!  Moist and chewy.  I bet the base brownie recipe which this is formed from is spectacular too!   Great new twist on brownies!

The pumpkin and chocolate combination is unique and works well together.  I only used 7 T butter with 1/4 c plus 1 T applesauce in place of the rest of the butter.  I also slightly decreased the nutmeg and cloves.  This makes more of a snack cake or a cake-like brownie.

I got rave reviews for these on thanksgiving. Someone even told me it was the best brownie they ever tasted! Just know that these are pretty rich and heavy. I don't think I will bother with the marble effect next time. It didn't really work out.

I followed this recipe exactly and had to leave them in the oven much longer than the called for time. They were still mushy. Unfortunately I couldn't get my family to eat many of them. They tasted good though..I just couldn't get past the mushiness.

So so so delicious. I omitted the cloves and walnuts because I didn't have them handy. Per other reviews,  I poured more batter in the pumpkin bowl which made it easier to pour into the pan, but still I found it hard to marry the batters into a pretty design. But that doesn't really matter too much because they were absolutely wonderful. They didn't last a day in my house.

Wonderful! I didn't include as much cloves or nutmeg and the brownies came out perfect. Also, I didn't mix the choc chips into the batter -- I sprinkled them on top of the marbled mixture before baking. I also omitted the nuts. Thanks for this phenomenal recipe!

These are a nice change up from the usual brownie recipe - especially if you are looking for something different in that department....and an interesting way to use up any extra pumpkin. On the down side, I don't think I would enjoy these as much any other time of the year except for the Fall.

This is REALLY close to Martha Stewart's recipe for pumpkin swirl brownies. Hers calls for only 1/2 cup of butter, 1 more egg and 1/4 tsp of cayenne. Otherwise they're fundamentally the same. That said, they ARE excellent brownies!

These were absolutely fantastic!  There is a bit of effort (and mess) involved given the need to split the batter, but it was definitely worth it.  Also, while the batter was a bit difficult to spread as other reviewers have mentioned, I used a knife and swirling-motion at the end as directed, and they came out gorgeously marbled.  If you like the combination of autumn spices with pumpkin and chocolate, you really can't go wrong with these.  I made a few changes to make them a bit healthier, and my husband and I both felt that they tasted just as good as if I'd followed the recipe exactly.  I used 1/2 cup Smart Balance Light plus 1/4 cup extra pumpkin in place of the butter (incorporated both in the base-batter, adding the other 1/2 cup of pumpkin when directed) and only 1 cup of sugar.  I used 5 packets of Stevia to make up the difference.  I also omitted the nuts, but kept all else the same.  The brownies baked up perfectly in 40 minutes, and they were enjoyed just as much freshly baked and warm as after a night in the fridge.  This one is a definite keeper, and I know I will make them multiple times over the coming season.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!!

I was looking for recipes with pumpkin in them because I need to finish a can off. When I stumbled across this one. Very easy to make, very moist, it's different and very good. Thank you for sharing this one.

This recipe was interesting more than anything. I got good feedback especially on those who arent chocolate lovers. It kinda tastes like the mexican "abuelita" hot chocolate. Overall very good flavor! I just thought the texture was a bit off but thats just the pumpkins fault.

This was so amazing!! I told my husband that I could eat these all day.  I used cheese cloth to sqeeze the water out of the pumpkin before I added it which solved the problem of the pumpkin batter being too thin.  I also subbed the cloves for orange zest and I didn't add the chips or nuts because I like my brownies without chunks.

Ha ha ha, I'm sure I did something wrong.  I tried to make layered cupcakes, like one of the photos show.  They fell apart completely, but it was so good, we had to serve them anyway.  We mushed them into balls, and made Pumpkin Brownie truffles, rolled in cocoa and powdered sugar.  I'll try it again, definitely.

Shame but I did not like these. The chocolate was to thick and not spreadable at all. The pumpkin mixture was runny and didn't set well even after baking the full time.  It turned out to be clumps of hard chocolate mixture in too soft pumpkin.  Also, the pumpkin had too much of something, either cloves or nutmeg...it was all I could taste really.  Will not ,make again.

these were a wonderful addition to our Thanksgiving dessert table.  They were very moist and fudgey and pumpkin-y at the same time.  I did leave out the walnuts due to allergies, but they were just delightful.  I received many compliments and had to hand over the recipe.

I have made these twice: the first time leaving out chocolate chips and walnuts and the second time adding the chocolate chips.  Definitely do not make this recipe unless you have the chocolate chips on hand because they are so much better with them in there!  I took these to a "girl's night" of five women, and half of the plate of brownies was gone before I left.  Everyone raved about how good they were.  I have to say though, they turn out almost more cake like than brownies though, and they are extremely moist.  Just be aware of that if you are more of a fan of a crunchier/dryer brownie because these are more like stick to your finger gooey brownies.  It's not a brownie I'd make all the time either, but it was something fancy and nice for a fall get together.  Overall, these were a hit!

These brownies might seem like a weird combo but they are not. I followed the recipe as is in an 8x8 pan and they came out very moist. They were delicious and I might make them again next year.

These were very good.  I made them for Thanksgiving since my family are all chocolate lovers.  I doubled the recipe and it made a ton.  Makes a very dense brownie.  Instead of the individual spices it calls for, I just added pumpkin pie spice and it was wonderful.

These were okay, but you likely may want to add more spice to bring out the flavors otherwise the recipe as written is a little dull on spice and flavor. Just so you know, this is a fluffy more cake like brownie than a dense fudgy brownie. I love the cake like brownies, so I was pleased with that. I ended up adding more spice, however, the brownie batter stuck to the pan after it was baked while the pumpkin did not. This has never happened to me before although I have been baking for a while. Because the brownie portion stuck to the pan and didn't release, it ruined my whole batch of brownies that I planned on taking to a Halloween event tonight.....

I never thought that I would say this, but these are too sweet.  I felt that they just tasted like a lot of sugar and the pumpkin and chocolate flavors didn't really come through.  They are still okay, and my kids really like them.  I followed the recipe exactly only changing the pan that I baked them in.  As far as appearance goes, these looked so cute baked in a mini-bundt pan with a little orange glaze.  May try again with a little less sugar and a little more spice.

Wonderful rich brownies! And I'm not a fan of pumpkin sweets. I used 1/2 c butter plus 1/4 c applesauce, and 1 c sucanat plus 1/4 c white sugar, added 1 T of flaxseed meal to the main batter, and omitted the cloves. I also used slightly less than the required nutmeg b/c I grated in fresh nutmeg, which has a stronger flavor. I baked in mini and regular muffin cups to make "brownie bites." Sorry, didn't pay attention to time in muffin pans...just kept a close eye on the oven and watched for doneness. I'd say it was less than 20 mins for even the regular muffin size.

Great Recipe!  Will make again.  Used the comment changes: "flour" pan with cocoa and sprinkle chocolate chips on the chocolate layers.  I made the brownies less cake-like by using 2 eggs and also used pistachios instead of walnuts.

Oh my, these have to be one of the best brownies ever!  I made them in a muffin tin instead of an 8 x 8 pan because I was taking them to work. I also sprinkled the walnuts on top, because I wasn't sure who liked them or not. They were gone in record time.  Those were the only minor changes that I made that don't affect the outcome of the recipe.  These are absolutely perfect as is.  They are more cake-like, but moist and creamy.  I now have to make sure I have pumpkin on hand at all times in case I have a craving for these!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

**Had to make tons for a party, so I used a box of brownie mix and made this recipe but only added pumpkin ingredients; doubled the pumpkin puree, cinnamon,and nutmeg then used pecans and a dash of cloves. Poured 1/2 brownie mix in bottom of 9x 13 pan then 3/4 of pumpkin mixture then the rest of brownie mix and then pumpkin.  Used a knife to swirl, no problems.    Loved it!

It was good, very strong taste. Went to try a different kind of brownie after and all I could taste was pumpkin. Its def something you have to eat within a day or two. had another brownie four days later and the texture totally changed.

I started mixing up the ingredients for these brownies then much to my dismay, I opened the cupboard and had no chocolate chips. I went ahead and made them anyway and they're delicious, but the extra chocolate from the chips would make them even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!! I entered in the fall fair and won first with them.  I followed the recipe exactly but layered the batters in mini muffin tins for presentation purposes and did not put walnuts or chocolate chips in.  In the muffin tins they only baked for 15-20 minutes. A great recipe!

These brownies turned out amazing! They are more of a cakey bar than a brownie, but they are delicious! I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I just spread all of the chocolate batter on the bottom, then spread all of the pumpkin batter over top and swirled it. Instead of using walnuts in the pumpkin batter, I chopped up white choco chips and added them. Turned out great! Very rich!

I made these exactly like the recipe, only cutting the amount of cloves and nutmeg in half for my ownt tastes.  These didn't keep very well for me, the pumpkin layer held too much moisture and they became rather sticky.  I wasn't blown away by these, and probably wouldn't make them again, but it was a way to use up some extra pumpkin puree I had.

Delicious! Big hit at Thanksgiving dinner! I must not have split the batter up evenly because there ended up being more pumpkin than brownie, but it was still yummy. Next time I'll try dividing the batters better!

Terrific recipe!  Friends and family loved them.  I substituted 1/2 butter for applesauce and 1/2 flour for whole wheat flour.

This recipe was very good. The brownie batter was so delicious, I almost just ate that :). It would be a good way to get rid of leftover pumpkin from Thanksgiving. I didn't add the nuts so maybe next time I will try that and it might get five stars instead of four.

Excellent autumn brownies!  I made these for a small group and they got rave reviews and were gobbled up!  My only changes were to reduce the amount of butter (1/2 cup) and I layered the pumpkin mixture on top of the chocolate mixture instead of swirling them together.

I made these for a baby shower and everyone really liked them.  (I doubled the recipe and left out the nuts for personal preference.)  I did have some trouble with the marbling effect because my batters sat for a while before I put them in the pan and they got pretty stiff.  I baked it for about an hour since I doubled it.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's very cake-like and not chewy-brownie-like, and I wasn't wild about the cloves.  But, it's a nice change for a sweet fall dessert and my four kids mowed through it like steak tar tar. UPDATE 10/14/12:  I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because peo keep requesting it & I keep making it!

I love pumpkin, but wasn't sure about pumpkin and brownie together.  These were really great though!  I did the brownie layer on the bottom and the pumpkin layer on top.  They looked and tasted great.  I made homemade chocolate frosting for them...awesome!

I just made these today and I have to THANK YOU SO MUCH for this GREAT Recipe.  These are just awesome and I made them exactly as written expect I used fresh pumpkin and not canned.  I did add some cream cheese frosting which really takes them to the next level of FANTASTIC Brownies.  Thanks again for the recipe, I don't think I will ever buy box brownies again.

My husband made and loved these.  He took over my tradition of making pumpkin chocolate chip muffins every fall.  After trying this it has the same great flavors and much easier to make than waiting on muffins to bake and refill.  They are moist and delicious.  Will still make the muffins, but this gives us something to take to fall gatherings for the desert end of the meal.

These are unbelievably good!  I did a horrible job of separating the batter into halves, so I had more pumpkin than chocolate, but that did nothing to take away from the flavor.  These are so moist and delicious - I'll never look at a "plain" brownie the same way again!  I used fresh pumpkin puree - maybe a bit more than what was called for.  They came out a bit on the cake-like side, but I absolutely LOVE these brownies!  Thanks for sharing, CroqueMadame!

I thought this was fabulous although I did make a mistake on my first try because I was in a rush and needed to bake something for an office party for the next day as I almost mixed the cocoa powder in with the flour as you do for brownies.  I scooped out as much as I could and went ahead and made it.  It was a great hit with everyone and everyone asking for the recipe.  I will agree though it is not exactly brownie like but more like snack cake.  Very delicious though!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just made it again today as I have lots of pumpkin.  Do not be afraid to try unless you don't care for pumpkin all that much like my husband.  Don't care though all te more for us!

Pretty Good. I actually used the brownie recipe for "Best Brownies" on this site (because I always have great luck with it and we LOVE it).  Also, after reading the reviews, a lot of people mentioned they had difficulty swirling the two batters together and I didn't have any trouble doing this with the Best Brownie batter. I doubled the ingredients, except for the cocoa.  Added 1/2 c. of pumpkin puree to the half of the batter that did not have the cocoa in it and pumpkin pie spice.  Swirled together in the pan.  Turned out well.  I believe this is a 5 star recipe for those who love pumpkin and chocolate together.  I gave 4 stars because we didn't absolutely "love" the combo.  However, this is a nice, moist brownie with a pumpkin flavour, if you don't "over-swirl" your two batters together.

The way to know an excellent recipe is that you can alter it for health and it's still a winner.  That was this recipe.  I subbed out half the butter with a low saturated fat spread (Can't Believe Not Butter Light) and the other half with super-healthy chia gel (mix 1 tbsp ground chia seeds in water and let gel).  I used 1 tsp organic stevia extract (NOW brand has no aftertaste) for half the sugar and I subbed in whole white wheat flour (not red wheat) and they still looked good, tasted very moist, and were a winner at church (where they usually only tolerate my healthy food :-).  I even made a nut free batch for the priest (he's allergic) and it turned out very well too.  I did lower the cloves (as I ran out) but that worked so I'll keep it at a "pinch" as they can be strong and are disliked by many.  I also subbed with mini chocolate chips but the same amount (as that's all I had).  Still the texture was awesome and *I* loved that I wasn't feeding them high calories nor something that would spike blood sugar (the lower sugar, nuts and whole wheat keep it from spiking). This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  Thank you for sharing it.  I will make it often - oh, and the leftovers froze well - tasted the same the following week when I served it again.  Can't beat that!

These are great! I love that they're fall-flavoured in a mellow way. I made them in a 9" pan and just spread the 2 flavours one on top of the other. Baked for about 35 mins, and they're perfect! Fudgey and delicious. (omitted the nuts)

These brownies came out exactly like they should have.  The chocolate layer was very moist.  I guess I just don't like the combination of chocolate and pumpkin as much as some people do.

AMAZING!! I used only one cup of agave in place of sugar and cut the butter in half, adding extra pumpkin in place of it. Left out the nuts, just a personal preferance. Will definitely revisit SOON.

I just made these today and they are soooo good! Hubby is looking forward to his coffee tonight! They are moist, tasty, just the perfect combination! I only used 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves though... I thought 1/2 tsp. could be too much (for us) and the flavor was just spot on... Loved them and will definitely make them again! Thanks for such a great recipe! I am uploading my picture here too!

Wonderful!  I kind of lopsided my brownies when I was dividing them, so they're kind of heavy on the pumpkin side--darnit, I guess I'll have to make them again and get them perfect.

They're very rich, almost too rich, but balance out great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or nice creamy coffee.

I'm giving this a 4 because I feel like I must have royally screwed up. This sounds like the best recipe ever, but there was one huge problem with my result. The clove taste was very strong and really overshadowed (perhaps combined w/the other pumpkin pie-type spices) the chocolate flavor. I substituded half the butter with applesauce and I don't think there was any negative impact there. Just a welcome reduction in calories. The brownies were beautiful and the texture perfect. Will definitely make again, but will reduce clove to 1/8 teaspoon or maybe even less (gun shy!). Maybe the ground cloves here (Asia) are much stronger than at "home" (US). We'll see...Admire the developer's idea though. Brownies giving birth to a pumpkin pie, was it? Best idea ever!

These were amazing! I doubled the recipe to make two and forgot and put it all in one pan which I think made it better. I cooked it a bit longer just until the knife came out almost clean. They were chewy and delicious!

Perfect!  These are so moist and everyone raves every time I make them.  I just leave the walnuts out, but the rest of the recipe is spot-on delicious!

These are so yummy!  I had to leave out the walnuts.  I did end up adding more pumpkin and choco chips, just to finish up the bags!  Which I think, made it take longer to bake but the end result:  FABULOUS!!!

When I had these just out of the oven, I thought they were okay but not amazing.  The next day, though, I am completely sold. They're not beautiful, but they are delicious and unique and marries my loves of chocolate and pumpkin. I took others advice and reduced the butter (6T, replaced with apple sauce, could probably reduce it some more), halved the baking powder to make less cake-like (worked great), and used scant measures of the spices. It didn't take the full time to bake.

Sorry, these brownies just didn't do it for me.  I followed the directions, baked them per directions.  They seemed done, toothpick came out dry.  They were way too wet at the pumpkin parts.  I could salvage the edges but the middle was way too moist to serve...

This recipe was good but it was more cake-like than a brownie. The only trouble I had was spreading the brownie batter in the pan. It was too thick to spread. If I make this again, I will sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the brownie batter rather than mix them in as it was difficult to spread with them in the batter.

I also wasn't sure about the pumpkin/chocolate combo but the reviews were pretty good so I decided to try it.  It was amazing.  Very simple looking but the taste was wonderful.  I got so many compliments from this.  I will definately make this again.

Such a yummy recipe.  A perfect brownie for the fall.  It's like pumpkin bread with a chocolate chip brownie mixed in.  I did add less butter and only used 1/2 of a cup.  Turned out perfect.

I did adjust the recipe to 1/4t of baking powder in order to get a denser less cake like brownie.  All in all, they are very good and I would most defintley make them again.

these are delicious and moist.  i could have baked them a bit longer and i think they would have been a little better and next time i make them i'll cut back the butter a bit as it seemed to be seeping out of the mixture but they tasted delicous and i would definitely make them again.

Brownies turned out very moist, but we just weren't crazy about the flavor. I served with whipped cream and took them to work, no one really liked them.  Sorry, had high hopes.

These are perfect. The only thing I did was use pumpkin pie spice instead of spices as it was what I had on hand. Also left out nuts as kids don't like. Will be making it to hand out to adult trick or treaters! Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe without the nuts and chips, simply because I didn't have any in the house.  The brownies got rave reviews...though I will admit, I didn't think they were as amazing as everyone else did.  Next time I will try with the mix-ins.  Maybe that is the magic ingredient.

YUMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!! I didn't add the nuts - but that didn't seem to deter my friends from nearly licking the plate clean!  Thanks for sharing such a yummy snack! I enjoy a rich, pumpkin flavor - I'll most likely add more spices to the pumpkin layers the next time I bake these brownies.

These were just ok. I am no baking expert, but I think 2 eggs would have made them more "fudge like" and thus more of a brownie in my mind. They seemed much more of a cake than a brownie. That being said, maybe a nice cream cheese frosting would have helped, or just one less egg. I also thought the walnuts seemed a little out of place, wish I would have saved them for choco chip cookies. Sorry, I don't think I will try this again : /

I wanted to try something different and since I love chocolate and pumpkin I decided on this recipe. It is to die for. I took the batch over to the flower shop where my Mom used to work and they said the same thing. They could not believe how good they were. I am making several batches to use for a fund raiser. They should sell quickly. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious! I left out the cloves and of course substituted out some of the butter to make it healthier.  I also used whole-wheat flour instead of white flour.

Reduced butter to 1/2c. Rounded up cinnamon to 1t. Split batter so there was more for chocolate batter, and used rounded 1/4c. cocoa to compensate.

A great use of pumpkin puree.  My family loved it!  I appreciate that this is a homemade brownie, rather than a brownie mix with pumpkin added.  It bakes up nice and full and is very moist.  This recipe has been in my recipe box since February 2011.  I'm glad, and so is my family, that I finally got around to making them.

These were superb! I didn't get the marbling effect, but I think that was my fault with the layering. Also, the ground cloves were a little too much for me, so the second time I made these, I cut them in half and it was soooooooo good. Also, make sure to COMPLETELY cool before eating--that makes them so much more moist. Anyway, 5 stars, easily!

Well when I returned home they had disappeared so I'm assuming I'll make them again?  In a house with 4 male mouths under 15...that's a good sign :)
Have to admit that I was lazy and just mixed everything together at once in my KitchenAid.  I do agree about being a little greasy but otherwise I have no complaints.  My pan was smaller than recommended so I'm assuming that's why they came out a little more moist than I would have liked.

Great Brownies!Because of the reviews saying they were a little greasy I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup plain Greek Yogurt. Since I had Duck eggs I used two of those instead of chicken eggs. I used Pamela's gluten free flour because I am celiac. Everyone LOVED them, thanks for the recipe!

Made using two bowls, with 1/2 cup flour in the pumpkin batter and 1/4 cup in the chocolate batter. That way, the chocolate batter isn't too dry.

Made a double batch in 9x13 pan.  Left out cloves entirely and followe some reviewer suggestions to leave more batter for the chocolate than the pumpkin.  Just did two layers chocolate on bottom and pumpkin on top then swirled a lot with spatula.  Tuned put gret!

The best way to add batter to the pan: Start by spreading most of the brownie batter in the pan (I use a little less base for pumpkin half than brownie half). Top with all of the pumpkin mixture. Use reserved brownie batter to add small dollops (about 9) to top. Swirl through dollops and pumpkin layer with spatula or knife- not too much, just until the desired look is achieved. Also, used 1/2 c. margarine, 2 eggs, 3/4 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate chips, pecans, baked for just over 20 minutes (until top was no longer glossy). I don't usually like cloves, but they make this taste more like a holiday recipe and really add to the overall rich flavor, so I just reduced the amount a little. Dash of freshly ground nutmeg. The key to this is not to overmix or overbake. The result is moist, rich, and deceptively easy. Will be requested repeatedly!

I was extremely delighed with this recipe! They came out wonderfully! Reading the other reviews and people's suggestions really helped. I used less baking powder and instead of butter, I used applesaue and a little bit of vegetable oil. One thing that really made a difference was NOT cutting the batter in half - I used more batter with the chocolate part as the pumpkin puree definitely adds a lot more than you would think. The marbled effect came out really well with mine and I think the applesauce helped with the consistency on that part. Thanks for a great recipe (and awesome suggestions, you reviewers!)!

Oh, my goodness!  What a decadent looking and tasting treat!  I doubled recipe for 9x13 pan and used only 2 layers and did not swirl - it was outstanding!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it will be one of my go-to recipes from now on!!

excellent! moist! and easy!  I used 1Tbs less butter...added 3 Tbs whipped cream cheese to pumpkin mix...used pecans instead of walnuts... and didn't "swirl".  
Baking time took 40 minutes in a 12 muffin tin and the result was just as promised.  "if pumpkin pie and brownies had a baby"...

Thanks for a GREAT recipe :)

I altered the recipe slightly - gluten free baking mix instead of AP flour. No walnuts because I didn't have any, although I will probably use next time. I inadvertently cut down the butter (read the recipe wrong and used half a cup) and will keep that amount next time. And I used pumpkin pie spice plus a few grates of fresh nutmeg. It was so good, my boyfriend asked me for a pan of them to take to the chef at his restaurant and maybe they can serve it as a fall special, served hot with vanilla ice cream.

Mine turned out more cake like than brownie like- the taste was average- these need some kind of sauce- so prepare to make that- try caramel bourbon or a cream cheese icing

These turned out pretty well. I agree with a previous post, the brownies are a bit greasy, I might cut down the butter. Mine also took much less time than 40 minutes to bake, only about 25 or 30 minutes. They were relatively tasty.

I found the brownies to be very cake-like, where I prefer my brownies chewy. Also, I could not spread the chocolate batter very easily, so I just put all of the chocolate in the bottom and topped it with the pumpkin, then swirled (rather than layer). If I had layered, they probably would have tasted better (so layer your brownies!) Not bad overall, but would have enjoyed a chewier brownie.

These were SO good! I was concerned they would be more cake-like, but I had no reason to worry, as they were moist and chewy like a brownie should be. I love that the pumpkin taste is just a hint, not overpowering. I had some leftover of this site's Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting, so I spread that on top to make it even more rich and yummy!

An excellent fall treat!! I took 3 batches to a potluck - not only were they devoured they got rave reviews from everyone! I omitted the walnuts (allergies) and halve the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup for a more cake like brownie. Perfect - thanks for sharing!

Delicious and unique version of brownies for fall!  I went a little overboard on the spices and am kind of sad I did because it took away from the simplicity of the chocolate and the pumpkin.  Definitely a keeper!

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and baked them in a mini-muffin tin, with the pumpkin and brownie batters layered.   They were absolutely AMAZING. I wanted to keep eating them and eating them. I was dubious about the pumpkin and chocolate combo, but this recipe erased all doubt. I brought a batch in for a holiday party at work and they all disappeared.

Amazing recipe!  They are delicious. I didn't have cloves so instead of the spices indicated, I used 1 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1 tsp of Cinnamon. Also didn't have enough butter so i only used 1/2 cup and they were more than moist enough!

I really liked these but didn't get any compliments and there were a lot leftover.  I omitted the nuts but followed the rest of the recipe exactly (doubled & baked in 13x9 in pan).  I think this is awesome just as a brownie recipe too... not sure why they weren't a bigger hit except maybe people didn't know what they were or because I also made cake pops - which are always a huge hit.

These were quite simple to do, though I didn't get the swirl effect I wanted (I messed that part up, ha), and they're tasty. They're not fudgy like I prefer, these are more cakelike, but it just so happens that I like cake, so it works out fine. Someone on the RB mentioned having trouble getting theirs out of the pan, so I made sure to grease and "flour" with cocoa and I had absolutely no problems getting mine out whatsoever. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure they'll be loved at Sunday dinner!

I like the fact it was very moist. They came out great, but the taste is very different, but I did like the flavor of spices. Strange tasting chocolate and pumpkin together. I would give it 3.5 rating if I could.

These are just the most perfect thing I have ever eaten!  I substituted more chocolate chips for the walnuts.

I don't usually like anything pumpkin but the combo of the pumpkin with the brownie was perfect. I made muffins like shown in one of the pics. Recipe as is made 12 muffins perfectly and took 30 mins in oven.

Excellent.  These taste like autumn!  I did, however, substitute ginger for the cloves, since I don't care for cloves.

Theses are delicious. I brought a batch in to my office and everyone loved them. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and reduced the amount of butterand substituted half a cup of the white sugar for brown. I left out the nuts for allergy reasons. I used a regular sized muffing tin and baked them for 22 minutes. Using the muffin tin made it much harder to layer and marble. All the chocolate chips ended up on the bottom. I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site which is amazing. Am making a second batch tonight in a 9x13 pan as I have leftover pumpking AND frosting!

I used a little less butter and sugar than the recipe calls for.  These taste pretty good, but the chocolate part is much more cake than brownie.  A little disappointed in that.  If I make again I wouldn't use any baking powder and slightly decrease the amount of flour to give me a denser brownie.

This recipe tastes awesome!  I am a huge "pumpkin" fan so this was a nice mix for me - HOWEVER, the pumpkin portion tasted more like pumpkin pie than brownie so just be aware of that.  Very good taste, though!

Wow!  These are great brownies!  I've never made them with pumpkin before, but I love anything that has pumpkin in it.  I'll need to be a little more exact when I half the batter next time because the chocolate part was a tiny bit dry.  Other than that, fantastic.  I will definitely make these again.

Very good recipe. More of a cake-like brownie, than a fudgy brownie. Still very good and moist. Would probably be good as a chocolate brownie recipe for those that don't like pumpkin.

Very good-definately makes a more 'cakey' type of brownie.  I follwed other reviwers advice and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and this worked just fine:)

These were just ok.  They didn't rise very high in the pan, but the texture was good.  I had measured using a scale to make sure I had half the mixture for the brownies and half for the pumpkin but the finished product tasted pretty much all pumpkin.  I barely had enough brownie batter to spread a thin layer on the bottom.  If I decide to try this again I'll do 2/3 base batter for brownie and 1/3 base batter for pumpkin.

Honestly, I did my best to screw up this recipe and it was still delicious! Just after putting my marbled brownies into the oven I saw the spices sitting on the counter and realized that I hadn't put them in (darned kids distracted me). I took them out of the oven, removed some batter, mixed the spices in and swirled the spiced batter back into the other batter. I didn't have much marbling at that point, but they tasted great and were incredibly moist. I will make these again, the right way!

Excellent Recipe! I followed the recipe as printed with two minor changes. I substituted ground ginger for the cloves, and used butterscotch chips along with the chocolate, omitting the walnuts.  Very pleased with the result! These brownies are moist and full of flavor. They look great as well. A delicious fusion of pumpkin and chocolate. YUM!

These are so delicious!  I even screwed up the recipe because I wasn't paying attention (added the flour after the chocolate and pumpkin, oops) and it STILL came out so delicious.  Cut back on the butter by 1/3 also because I live at 5200 feet, and they were amazing.

5 stars for the flavor of these brownies, 2 stars for the hassle of trying to get them out of the mini muffin cups they were baked in.  I wanted them to be just like the photo, so I followed one reviewer's suggestions to make them in mini muffin pans.  Oh, what a mess!  Even though the pan was well greased, it was a horrible mess.  They came out in several pieces.  The last batch to go into the oven were baked in regular sized muffin pans and worked out much better.  The flavors were wonderful though.  I will make these again, but probably in the 8 x 8 pan as directed in the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic.  I didn’t change a thing. One thing I love about this recipe versus others is how the pumpkin swirl is actual batter that bakes up with the same texture as the brownie, rather than being a more moist swirl. Keeping this recipe to make forever and ever.

Absolutely delicious and so moist!  Like others, I use more batter in the chocolate layer, and it does need it.  I also did not swirl the layers.  Topped with chocolate chips.  Just wonderful and not overly sweet!  Mine was done in about 35 minutes.  Oven times vary.  Just start checking it at 30 minutes.

This is good but as noted in other reviews the part with the cocoa gets way to stiff. I split the batter 2/3 chocolate and 1/3pumpkin and added 2 tbsp milk to the chocolate part. I also made a batch with vegetable oil instead of melted butter and that helped you. But good taste overall.

We left out the walnuts because the kids don't like them :( but other than that followed the recipe exactly. They turned out very tasty, moist and rich. A great treat for fall  when you are in the mood for pumpkin!

Very good, though it took longer to bake than 40 minutes. I left out the spices which gave the top layer more of a walnut flavour, which was what I was going for.

This recipe was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  It had the flavor of gingerbread with the texture of pound cake.  Add some homemade whipping cream. . .wow! The end result was very dense and rich although I couldn't separate the flavor of the brownie layer from the pumpkin layer. I doubled it and left out a few Ts of butter as others had recommended. We didn't miss that butter.  I would make it again.

I used Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Brownie Mix Double Chocolate instead of making brownies. I layered brownie, pumpkin and more brownie. Added pecans and swirled. Fabulous! And easy!! Big hit!

Mushy...First, as another reviewer said, you have to give more of the batter to the chocolate portion than the pumpkin portion. But either way, it is absolutely not cooked in the center. Might be better as cupcakes.

I followed the recipe as is, except switched out walnuts for pecans cause it's what I had on hand. Unfortunately, I didn't like them. I think it was the cloves, too overpowering for my taste. And the texture didn't work for me either, they were almost mushy. My cousin liked them though and luckily took most off them home so I didn't have to worry about them going to waste. I won't be making these again.

I was so skeptical and worried that it would be dry or not taste good. But it was AMAZING!!!!! so addicting! Perfectly moist. So glad I tried this out. We’re not huge pumpkin fans and we are believers now. I’ll be making this for my work potluck as well. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg, clove and cinnamon and I am glad I did!

Made gluten free with 1/2 c King Arthur measure for measure flour and 1/4 c oat flour. Also cut sugar by 1/4 c, left out the walnuts and added another 1/4 c pumpkin. Yum!

Very clear recipe. I ended up having to change things up a bit, because I couldn't find pumpkin puree and didn't want to start from scratch. I went with apple sauce and chestnut puree in separate batches all added together in the end, reduced sugar by a third since those are sweeter (probably could've reduced even a bit more).

This was AMAZING. I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe but added a bit more pumpkin and also baked this in muffin cups rather than a pan - a great way to have easy to-go treats. The flavor is fantastic and the choc chips and nuts add a nice little crunch. The crust is chewy in that brownie-like way. Highly recommend!!

I made these as written but subbing gluten free all purpose flour and omitting walnuts. We just aren't fans of nuts in our brownies. I baked these a minute or two past 45minutes and they turned out perfectly. They were delicious!

Super yummy! However, the brownie batter was very think and difficult to spread, but was super chocolatey and delicious. The brownie portion sank to the bottom while the pumpkin rose to the top, but I poured the batters in multiple layers because I wanted them to be mixed more. It really just ended up being a layer of pumpkin cake on top of a super good brownie.

Oh. My. Word. These are so delish! The only changes I made were due to preference. I simply substituted the nuts for chocolate chips in the pumpkin portion. I also spread nutella on top and sprinkled pecans on top. Yum! A real crowd pleaser!

Delicious! These will be a regular in my autumn repertoire now. I baked them in muffin tins and kept a close eye on the time, it was about 21 minutes in our oven. Because of the way I layered the brownies I did have extra pumpkin batter so I just poured it into a greased 8x8-inch pan and baked it that way.

These came out delicious!  I used moist brown sugar instead and only 1/2 of what it called for on the recipe. The only downside was that I tried to do these in the muffin tin instead, like it showed in one of the pictures, and that did not work out so well. Brownies are meant to be square, i guess :-)

delicious. maybe doubling the recipe and making it in a bigger pan so you get more of the moist inner brownies would make it better.

I cut back the butter to one stick and the sugar to one cup.  Turned out great. I think next time I will use 3/4 c of sugar.  They are still very sweet.

These are amazingly dense and rich.... amazing recipe. Yes, the batter ratios take a bit of getting used to, but they are absolutely amazing. I cut these into small cubes to serve, as opposed to traditional bars. Yummy!!

This was delicious! It was the perfect brownie. The first time I made it, I used only butter. The second time I used half oil/half butter and it was better. I recommend you guys to use half oil/half butter.  I'm making this again!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner, but omitted the nuts and used dark chocolate chips. I didn't stir through the chocolate and pumpkin as I prefer the 2 layers. My 1 1/2 year old and 2 1/2 year old grandchildren devoured them! The spices are perfect to make the pumpkin stand out (love the cloves), and the balance of chocolate to pumpkin is perfect. I also loved the texture of the chocolate chips in the brownie batter. I made one recipe and it made 12 tall cupcakes. You could easily make up to  18 cupcakes and they would still be big enough. I cooked for 15 minutes, then checked every 5 minutes. As it was, 12 tall cupcakes required 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I will definitely make these again and again.

Fantastic dessert! I made it for our staff at school and everyone wanted to come back for seconds! I followed the recipe exactly as written but put into muffin pans and baked about 25 min. Sprinkled powdered sugar on top with a drizzle of melted chocolate chips

These were truly addictive! I made mini-muffins for a work pitch-in. I used mini choc chips instead of the regular sized chips. Suggestion: putting the pumpkin mixture in first, then the brownie makes it easier to remove the muffins. I baked them at 350 for 9 min, sprinkled a small amount of pecan chips/mini choc chips on top, then baked for another 9 minutes. Let them cool for about 15 min.  Very cute presentation and so, so, SO delicious!

I was excited to make this for my family, but after one bite, no one would eat another. I finally tried it myself, and it was just awful. We love pumpkin, but this flavor was off. It's hard to describe. To get my children to finish the brownies, I sliced the top off and tried to give them more of the chocolate. That, too, did not taste good. I don't think it was chocolatey enough. I tossed the rest.

I made these to take to work and they are a big hit!  Mine didn't come out as pretty as yours, but I did most of them in mini muffin papers and didn't swirl.  I probably should have put the pumpkin portion on top instead of the brownie part, but it's fine.  I doubled the recipe and used 5 eggs instead of 6.  I added a couple of shakes of ground ginger to the pumpkin batter, and used pecans instead of walnuts as one of my co-workers is not a walnut fan.  They have a very nice texture and are very tasty.

Bakery-quality, wonderful Fall recipe!  Made exactly as written, however, added 1/2 tsp ginger as well.  Flavor combination brought to mind moist, "chocolatey pumpkin pie".  Baking time and temperature were "right on" for my convection oven.  Good flavor, same day; better flavor the next day; BEST flavor the day after.  Recommend cooling after baking and then storing (covered) in refrigerator at least 1-2 days.  Bring to room temperature before serving.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and even better a day or two after baking.  My 10 year old daughter made them and enjoyed the challenge of two batters! Four stars because bake time was too long for muffins. Although pictured in photo,  there was no time noted in recipie for muffins and they started to burn. Check at 25 and 30 minutes.

Loved this. I made it in the muffin tins and did half with walnuts half without. It made approximately 18 brownies when I did it in the standard size muffin tins. Due to the size I did not layer as the recipe mentioned but rather did one layer of chocolate one with pumpkin and then used an offset spatula to twist half of it within each cup to get it somewhat mixed. As others wrote, I went ahead and did about a 2/5ths 3/5ths split on the batter mix with more with the pumpkin. Overall, it was fantastic. Will definitely make them again!

Nice dessert for fall.  I doubled this and poured into a 9x13 pan, took about 45 min. to bake and ended up being more cake-like. However,  I made the mistake of not adding the flour until I had divided the batter in half and had added my cocoa/chips to some of it.  This worked out well though as I had read where  some thought the cocoa half was too thick and the pumpkin half too thin. So, I just added less flour to the cocoa half and more to the pumpkin half to work that out.  I realized the cocoa half was still pretty thick so I thinned it out a bit with an extra 2/3 C. of pumpkin puree.   Oh, I only used 2 C.  of the 3 C. of sugar called for in the recipe.  Next time I would probably decrease that to 1 1/2 C and decrease the chips to 3/4 C as well.  Our family doesn't like our desserts too sweet. Ended up with a scrumptiously moist fall dessert!

I made these today for my kids and husband as a treat for not making any treats for a while. I've had this saved for quite a while and really wanted to make as is but couldn't justify the full amount of sugar for a 8x8 pan... My teeth hurt thinking about that! I only used 3/4 cup and the end result told me that was enough. I decided to sprinkle the top with some remaining dark chocolate chips and the walnuts (instead of mixing with the batter). They are a really beautiful fall brownie. I was told by my kids that there was too much spices.. And it over took the chocolate flavor.. But the one bit I had.. I really loved. 
Next time I make I will try with whole wheat flour, coconut sugar, and try coconut oil instead of the butter, and use a full teaspoon of baking powder. My recommendation for this brownie is please cut down on the sugar... It's way overboard.

I don't understand the good results: I left mine in for ten minutes longer and the middle was still mushy. Is this enough flour?

I used wheat flour and white chocolate chips instead.

The flavor is great, just didn't turn out solid.

I followed this recipe to the T and it came out great! I brought it into work, and between the 3 of us that were on staff, almost the whole pan disappeared. Very much enjoyed it. The comments I got said they were very rich, but also very satisfying. Will definitely be making these again this fall!

Loved and followed the suggestion of adding Adobo for extra kick.  Even before doing so it was delicicious.

Made the lamb kabobs recipe on this site into meatballs and set one large in each bowl of soup with a drizzle of yogurt.

Very yummy...will make again and again.

I did reduce the cloves, but the rest was pretty much per the recipe.  I was worried when I started cutting them when they where still a little too warm.  It didn't look like the pumpkin was going to set, but once cooled they were perfect.  I will make this recipe again.  Thanks.

This was sooooo good! My girls gobbled them up. I left out the nuts because we did not have any. I put in muffin tins with liners (sprayed them ) to make clean up easier, decreased the butter a bit, decreased sugar a bit. I will definitely make again.

So yummy! I am a big fan of pumpkin anything and this adds a nice switch up to the regular brownie. I added some applesauce to cut back the butter and some honey to substitute some sugar. I also did as suggested and gave a little more batter to the chocolate side. I used mini muffin pans so I just layered choc. Pumpkin. Choc. And about 23-25mins. Worth a try for any pumpkin fan!

Everyone really enjoyed these. I made them in mini muffin tin so you had bite size brownies.

Very flavorful and Fall tasting. I did make a few changes, however. I cut the butter to 1/2 a cup, cut the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups, heaped the cocoa powder, heaped the 1/2 cup chocolate chips and then sprinkled some on top of batter before baking, did not use walnuts this time (but I'm not opposed to using them), and heaped the spices but was careful with the cloves. Everyone liked them and I will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe it came out great.  I followed it word for word except I ran out of sugar, so I had to use one cup of regular granulated sugar and one half cup of brown sugar.  Didn't seem to affect the recipe too much.  I ended up baking them in cupcake tins as someone else suggested (pumpkin on bottom, chocolate on top) and it worked well.  They came out with a good texture and very delicious with a good amount of pumpkin flavor.  I'm going to bring these for Thanksgiving tomorrow and I'd definitely make them again.

This is cake, not really a brownie. That said, thinking of it as cake, it's a fine recipe. But both my husband and I thought it needed more 'brownie'. I wonder if the chocolate part had been 2/3 and the pumpkin part 1/3 if it would be more brownie-like. It was edible and just fine, but I wouldn't make again.

I made a practice run on this sans the Walnut to see if it's what I want to bring to work for our "Worksgiving" - the brownies turned out AWESOME.

I'm making them again tonight with the Walnuts to take to work tomorrow :)

I followed other's advice and just made two layers (pumpkin on top). I also only baked mine for 35 minutes. I didn't have walnuts so I crumbled up pumpkin spice Oreos on top.

Pretty good, but I think the pumpkin flavour is overwhelmed by the chocolate. I would try making more of a 1/3 choc, 2/3 pumpkin mix next time. I made two batches: one with regular flour and one with gluten-free flour. Did not use nuts because of food sensitivities. Also--I used a mini-muffin tin (24 muffins) and one batch of batter filled that and a few more ramekins.

Although I personally did not love the combination of pumpkin and chocolate flavors, my co-workers loved them. So, I'd say it was a success.

These turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half butterscotch chips and half chocolate chips. I made them in muffin tins instead of the 8x8 pan and it made a dozen muffin sized brownies. Next time I may try to use less batter per brownie to get a few more from the recipe. I brought them to a party and everyone raved about them! Will definitely make them again!

The only change I made to this recipe was I doubled it! I made the brownie/cake in a 8 X 12 pan instead of a 8 X 8. It turned out wonderful and is a keeper for me! This comes out as more cake than brownie and it will make great cupcakes for the holidays! I love the chocolate pumpkin combo.

I made these into a dozen cupcakes, layering the two batters and swirling with a toothpick. They only needed about 25 minutes of bake time. They were very tasty! As others suggested, I cut back on the clove to 1/4 teaspoon. Next time I'd leave it out, as I didn't think it paired well with the chocolate. I also used half whole wheat flour to add a bit of whole grain. Next time I may cut down the butter to 1/2C as well.

worked great with GF flour. Be aware though that even though the recipe says to split the batter in half so that half becomes the pumpkin layer and half the chocolate brownie layer, the 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin boosts the quantity of the pumpkin layer. So if you would like to make only two layers or put the pumpkin layer in the middle, remember to use slightly less batter for the pumpkin layer. Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe for my 13x9 pan, which made it easier to split by just making two separate base batter batches. I topped them with a sweetened ricotta frosting,  then melted down some semi sweet chocolate chips with Grand Marnier and spread it over the top.  Absolutely divine.

I cut butter down to 1/2 cup and only used a dash of cloves and nutmeg, since I don't like those spices too much, so flavor to taste.   Here is a tip, when you split the batter in half, make sure one bowl has a bit more than half and add the coco powder to that one, since the coco powder makes the batter thicken up a lot and the half you add the pumpkin to will be really wet.

These were very moist and flavorful! Make sure to not scoop or tightly pack your flour. I did not change the recipe at all, and I think they took about 40 min. to bake. I will add them to my recipe binder and next time try some healthier substitutions.

These pumpkin brownies were such a hit at the office party!!! They were so moist and you were able to appreciate both the pumpkin and brownie flavors. Definitely will make every fall!

KUDOS to the creator of this recipe!! I made these for my son's fall festival in school (two dozen for 18 children and two teachers) and there were none left. I also brought some to work and received many compliments.  I doubled the recipe and made them in my mini cupcake pans. My changes; I would use approximately 2 tablespoons less next time I make these. I used all spice in place of the nutmeg and cloves and stuck with the cinnamon.

I made them the way the recipe said except that I left out the nuts.  I also added a few mini chips to the top. These were delicious and nice and fudgey. Took a little longer to back, but every oven is different.  I would make them again.  Nice and different with fall flavors.    Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I REALLY, REALLY like these! I think next time I will do as other reviewers suggested and add more batter to the chocolate part, but it was great as written. I agree with Chef Joy, though; I think my brownies would have been burnt if I would have baked them for the stated time. 33 minutes WAS perfect.

5 stars all the way!! I just made these brownies and they turned out surprisingly delicious, especially since I'm not really a big pumpkin fan.  I only made a few modifications.  Omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand and instead of cloves and nutmeg (which I also didn't have) I used 1 tsp pumpkin spice.  I also followed other's suggestion and added slightly more batter to the brownie mixture than the pumpkin mixture. 

The brownie batter was still a little thick so I spread most of it on the bottom of the pan, then layered all of the pumpkin batter on top.  I then added the remaining brownie batter in spoonfuls on top and ran a knife through the entire pan in a crisscross pattern, going left-to-right then top-to-bottom.  I use a similar method when making cheesecake brownies.  I also added a few extra chocolate chips on top. It turned out looking like a layered brownie with a marbled top which I thought looked really pretty.  And they tasted amazing!  I had to bake them for about 45 minutes to get them cooked all the way through but they were still moist and fluffy.  I will definitely be making these again but next time I'll make a double batch because these brownies don't last very long!

Love this! I had been looking for a brownie recipe that used less butter and this fit the bill perfectly. I decreased the butter in this recipe to a half cup and increased the pumpkin by the same amount and it was delicious. Also added a bit more cocoa powder and chocolate chips to increase the chocolate flavor. The review that said this tastes like a brownie and pumpkin pie had a baby was right!

Perfect in every way! If you leave out the walnuts (I'm allergic!)

We had leftover Pumpkin Pureè at work (Montessori Learning Centre of Pickering) after Thanksgiving.  I asked the Principal if I could take it home.  Our Cook (Mark) was in a playful mood and challenged me to improve on my world famous Brownies, by making "Pumpkin Brownies"!  This website is where I came in search of a recipe.  These Brownies are easy to "Play" with and "Impossible" to mess up! I double the recipe and use a 9 X 13 pan.

The first batch didn't make it to school (my family ate them all).  The second batch made it to school, but was gone before noon! (Enjoyed by Staff)  These are rich, but worth the calories!   What started as a joke has become a Tradition!

These are SO YUMMY. I made them with the brownie layer on the bottom and the pumpkin layer on top, as some others have done. They spices in the pumpkin layer were perfect, though I left out the cloves because I don't care for the taste. These were even better the next day, after they spent the night in the fridge. I would make these again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

One of my favorite treats for my annual Pumpkin Carving! The brownies are so pretty with the swirl of two colors. It is a little more work, but they look so good! The recipe made moist brownies that were not too sweet.

These were pretty enjoyable.  My only issue was that splitting the recipe into two equal batches was made difficult by my not having two same size bowls.  I guessed, and didn't allow for the moistness of the pumpkin, so that batch was too moist, but the chocolate was very good.  I also had to use a 9x9 pan, which probably didn't help matters.  I'll try again with the proper pan and bowls that match. :)

It turned out really great, but the only issue I had is that once you start making the two different halves, the cocoa powder half gets really thick and the pumpkin half gets really soupy. It was a challenge to layer and swirl them at the end.

This is a great combination! Extremely dangerous since you can't eat just one. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned which made the batter a little more loose. So I cooked them 15 minutes longer. They didn't burn and came out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

These are fantastic! Based on the other reviews, I made 4 changes..
1. I used 1/2c. butter 
2. I used 1c. sugar 
3. I used bittersweet chocolate chips
4. I used 2 eggs.
Also, I used gluten free flour. 
Loved these! Would make them again (and again and again...)

Yum - this is worth working out for a brownie made with whole wheat and raw sugar (the sucanat-sugar form which has a lot of good for you minerals, and which do not impact the flavor with the cocoa and pumpkin flavors in this recipe).  Have made with whole wheat flour once thus far.  I suspected that, when using WW flour, it would help to move towards a 'chewy' brownie.  Therefore I left in all oil thus far and dropped one egg; still too cakey - perhaps because I included an extra Tbsp. or so of cocoa?  The result was that the 'brownie' was more of a snack cake, but worse, it was a bit too chalky when made with whole wheat.  The ground cloves came through much too strongly as well.  Will try again next time with more pumpkin (maybe 2/3rds cup), less cocoa (maybe ........ hmmm, maybe I used a 1/3rd cup.....?? so maybe just keep it at a 1/4 cup leveled off for now), and use less cloves, if any at all.  With the whole wheat and raw sugar and pumpkin, I personally consider this a great breakfast treat, not just a great desert - but will like it better when the cocoa doesn't come through tasting 'chalky'.

Made this last night and it was very well received!  I doubled the recipe (since the pumpkin puree I bought was 15 oz) and accidentally made a few changes due to lack of ingredients and error.  I did not have any cloves and I accidentally tripped the amount of chocolate chips!  Oops, They were still very tasty and you still had a great amount of pumpkin flavor with a strong chocolate richness.  Will certainly be making them again!  I may try pecans instead of walnuts just to see how that would work.

YUM! Followed the recipe exactly except no nuts because I didn't have any. Took extra cooking time for some reason so after 45 mins I reduced the temp to 300 and gave them another 8 mins or so. Perfect!

I loved this recipe, I took it to a picnic and it was a hit!!
I did make a mistake though when making it, I was in a rush and used the whole 15oz can of pumpkin, It still came out really good. it did need an extra 10 min in the oven though.
 I remade it on another day with the right amount and was divine!!

I tweaked this a bit & it still needs some work. I bake in stoneware as such the moisture content is affected. I went with suggestions of other & lessened the butter. I will increase it back the next time, as well as adding 2T chocolate syrup to the brownie mix. I also went with 1c sugar & 2T agave nectar - perhaps 3T next time.  I used Pampered Chef cinnamon blend instead of the other spices in the total amount & it's awesome. Definitely making these again, the kids love them :)

Great recipe but mine turned out a bit dry. I also had the same problem as another reviewer - difficulty splitting the batter up and making layers because the chocolate layer was too thick to spread. Instead I did one chocolate layer and one pumpkin (should have read the review first and taken the advice provided). Regardless, I received positive reviews at the potluck I brought them to! Next time I will cut the sugar and add applesauce for sweetness and chewy texture. I would also cut the cloves in half (the flavour was very strong). All in all, a very interesting and inspiring recipe with totally unique flavours!! I will keep trying this one :)

Delicious! A few alterations, though: First, I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and the result was amazing. No walnuts, since I don't prefer them in my brownies. The biggest thing I would change for next time, though, would be to divide the batter *unevenly* between the brownie and the pumpkin. Next time I'll give 60-70% of the batter for the brownies, since the added 1/2 C. of pumpkin puree increases the volume of the pumpkin batter. The result from today's 50/50 batter split was pumpkin bars with chocolate swirls, rather than brownies with pumpkin swirls. Still, the overall product? Heavenly.

I used Heath Toffee instead of Chocolate Chips. They were discreet yet complimented to Walnuts so well!!

Amazing! Definitely a nice fall version of normal brownies. I would make them any time though, since they were so delicious. My boyfriend loved them too! ;)

So I have to agree with a lot of reviewers...dividing the batter equally was a bit challenging.  And the chocolate portion was WAY thick, while the pumpkin portion was runny.  My batch of brownies were layered instead of "swirled".  They did turn out more cake-like, which I would prefer fudge-like.  HOWEVER, they are very tasty and my 5, 3 and 1 year olds loved them!  Next time I'll try to remember to add some flaxseed for good measure.  :)

The pumpkin portion came out more like cake, and the chocolate portion came out like brownie.  A little too cake like for my preference.  I omit the walnut because I did not have any.  Clove left a bit of a stronger taste and overpowered the cinnamon.

I loved the brownies. I used dark chocolate chips for this and I couldn't keep people away. The only problem I had was I when I did the separate bowls to make the chocolate and the pumpkin the chocolate portions was way to dry and didn't spread for 2 layers.

This recipe is awesome - and award winning! I won most creative after I made this for a halloween bake off at work! These tasted so great - the only change I made was to use hazelnuts instead of walnuts. I also need to add that the swirling made them look beautiful. Thanks CroqueMadame!

Very good, just make sure you swirl it enough, I didn't and so it seemed like the chocolate over took it a little too much. I might try it with a little more pumpkin next time because I enjoyed the pumpkin taste a little more.

These are so ridiculously delicious! I made them exactly to the recipe (had to cook a bit longer, maybe 45 min) for my little girl's PTG meeting. They were so good we tried to buy them back, but only ended up with 4.
