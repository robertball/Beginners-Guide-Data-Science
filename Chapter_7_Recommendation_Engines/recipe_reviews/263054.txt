My daughter and I made it. I used Riesling instead of Mirin because I had it on hand. I really liked it. We also didn’t get the baby boo Chou but it was fine. Very tasty.

Made with a low sodium vegetable broth for a vegetarian twist! Added squeeze of lime which help cut the salt. Really enjoyed it and would make again!!

I halved the rice vinegar and soy sauce as others suggested.  We loved this meal.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We had bok choy last night in a dish and since It's not my husband's favorite vegetable, I used fresh spinach and sliced celery instead. I like the combination of leafy and crunchy that using bok choy gives to a dish.  I also cut a carrot into matchstick just to give it some color.
I made the broth as written and it was amazing.   I'm not a huge fan of soft boiled eggs so I  decided to top mine off with a poached egg instead.   AWESOME!
 I will definitely be making this one again.

I used dashi no moto instead of oyster sauce.  It was very good and came together quickly.

Great recipe,  Next timeI think I will use less a rice vinegar. I used 1/2 cup and it got too acid to my taste.

This was the first time I attempted making ramen. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic! I added julienned carrots just to add extra color. Will definitely be making this often.

Yum!!!!!  I did not have mirin or jalapeños, so I skipped them.  I did not have bok choy, so I used a frozen mixture of kale, spinach and swiss chard.  And I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I only had ground ginger.  Also, I added sliced baby bella mushrooms and a diced yellow pepper.  These minor changes and it was still great!  I think I would prefer bok choy and chicken in the future, but this seems to be a recipe that is adjustable based on your taste preference and whatever you have in your house.

Overall, very good! Tasted just like the broth from the local joint I visited a few weeks ago. 

A couple of notes from my preparation:
1. I tried the broth before adding 2 ramen pork seasoning packets and it was great, but I added the packets for an extra “authentic” boost and helped to take the flavor to the next level.

2. I did end up adding 2 additional cups of water after adding the bok choy because it was very salty. I am assuming that it was most likely due to the salt content of the brands I used. It did not take any flavor away but made it more subtle.

Broth is perfect. Soft boiled eggs perfect at 7 min. Noodles kept separate is the way to go. Will absolutely make again.
Thanks!
