Absolutely delicious ! We followed the recipe as written - with the exception of adding a tad of cayenne to the barbecue sauce before dividing it. At first, the addition of celery was puzzling, but it definitely adds to the recipe, and we would never omit it. This is a keeper! Thank you Soup Loving Nicole.

Family loved it.  Super easy. I did onion instead of celery....I will say the last step of broiling / basting is really important.  Don't skip it as it's key to a 5 star recipe!

This was fantastic, considering how easy it was, and how few ingredients were needed! The chicken was very tender and juicy. I can see how the BBQ sauce used would make all the difference in the world. I used Famous Dave's rich and sassy. 
I browned the chicken thighs in a skillet, as I don't like using the saute function of the Instant Pot. Low is too low, and high is too high. The skillet has more room, also. This one is a keeper!

Tasty and definitely fall off the bone tender.  I added onion and garlic as well as the celery.  I also seasoned the chicken thighs with Epicure Bacon and Roasted Tomato before browning the thighs.
