The marinade smelled really good but when i grilled them and tasted it , it needed salt. This odd probably just me but without the Danny it tasted like it was missing something. Wondering if i messed something.

Lots of flavor!  I will be making this recipe again.  I made the Chicken Fajita Kabobs with the Arroz Rojo (Mexican Red Rice) recipe I also found on allrecipes.com.
