Impressive, yummy, easy-breezie dessert enjoyed by the staff of Valley of Enchantment Elem School during Teacher Appreciation Week. I did tweek the recipe ever so slightly for personal preference. To the filling, I only blended in 1 cp. of Cool Whip so that it would be a little stiffer. Besides the caramel syrup, I topped the cake with sliced toasted almond slices and marashino cherries. Wow your friends with this fun dessert!

Very good flavor, easy to put together.  Caramel and Bananas go together surprisingly well.  I did use Hot Caramel rather than the caramel dip (at room temp, however)  Also, I soaked the banana slices in orange juice to prevent their darkening.  thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used 3 cups real whipping cream as I do not use processed whipped cream,  2 more bananas, another 1/2 cup orange juices,  and 1/2 c triple sec for the lady fingers soak.   I am sure much more calories but so very good

We loved this! That said, the ingredients are not clear. The recipe itself calls for way more caramel than the Ingredient list. And I used way more banana slices. We used apple cider instead of orange juice, and are so glad we did because it complemented the caramel well. We also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. And used a bunch more cool whip on the top. We also didn't spread the caramel out between layers, as that would have been a mess. I instead did a generous drizzle.

The orange juice overpowers everything else.  Definitely not a keeper.

I made this for a New year's Eve party, and no one liked it. It was just WAY too sweet. I never say that about any dessert, but the main flavor coming through was purse sugar, and that was it. It was pretty and looked fabulous, but it was so sweet it made my tummy hurt.

OK I might have changed things up because of what l had on hand.  Subbed vanilla wafers for lady fingers and used vanilla pudding.  Turned out wonderfully! !!
