This was great! I was out of barbeque sauce and didn't want to go to the store. So I tried Heather's sauce and it was not only delicious on my chicken, but easy too. I will stick with her sauce from now on - much better and tangier than bottled. Thanks Heather, Diane

This was truly a great sauce! My family loved it.. It started off a little too sour for me so I added 3 more tablespoons of brown sugar... I used it on shredded beef... Yum!!

After reading other reviews, I altered the amounts just a bit.  I used about half the vinegar and a little less worchestire.  I also used spicy brown mustard because I didn't have any powder.  I added a little onion powder, minced garlic and hot sauce.  Everyone loved it.

Great sauce! Like one reviewer, I was out of BBQ sauce too and used this over country style ribs in the Crock pot added some sliced onions to the pot and salt & peppered the ribs before pouring sauce over. Reserved a little extra sauce for after to pour over the ribs before serving. Made an excellent easy home cooked dinner served w/ potatoes and greens.

This was a good vinegar based sauce, however I used it on chicken.  I think it would have been much better on pulled port.  Because it is so tangy it has more of a pulled pork flavor.  I will try again the next time I do pulled pork.

I liked the consistency of the sauce however I didn't enjoy the flavor too much. I felt that it was too sour and vinegary so I add a little bit more brown sugar. In addition, I added a tablespoon of garlic powder, 1/2 tablespoon of rosemary, some sage, thyme, and dill weed. It tasted a lot better

Wow. As everyone said, quite sour. Love Worcestershire sauce thought. Not bad, just not for me.

This is more of a Carolina style sauce.  More tangy than sweet.  I thought it was good, although next time I will try the alterations PrncssLee suggested.  Thank you!

I am a person who loves sour/hot/bold flavors HOWEVER, this was much too sour for me.  I had to add a lot more brown sugar but after that (or maybe without 6 TABLESPOONS of lemon juice) it really was a great sauce.  Nice consistency, not like the high fructose corn syrup brands at the store but thick enough.

I liked this, it was the first sauce I ever made, and it was loved by my family.  I mixed it in with Pulled Pork and had everyone drooling.

I made this sauce for pulled pork, and it was all right with some of the modifications suggested. 1/3 cup vinegar, a bit less worcestershire sauce, a minced garlic clove and some grated onion made for a pretty decent sauce, but I would have preferred it to have more kick to it.

This is the best!! I made this sauce as instructed. 
I then made with Agave Nector instead of Brown sugar for those of us who eat Paleo style. Both were very good. No one could tell the difference between the two

With a few tweaks this turned out so good I think I could bottle and sell it.  Like some of the other reviewers, this was way too sour for my taste as written.  I checked the reviews then added about 5 extra tablespoons of brown sugar, a dash of onion powder & garlic powder, and thickened it up with a cornstarch/water mix.  This is EXACTLY how I like my BBQ sauce.  Yum yum.  We had it tonight on BBQ pork quesadillas with cheddar & green onions.  Delish!!
