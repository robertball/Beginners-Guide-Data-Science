I made this using the regular single-bowl method and the result was fantastic. The texture (as appears in the picture) was very uniform,not too dense, and did not crumble- slices well fresh out of oven. Succeeds in being sweet enough, but not too much so. It's a keeper! 

Single-bowl method: blend all dry ingredients together, add wet, stir vigorously with fork until well blended (you should see just a few bubbles on top). Pour immediately into prepared pan. I used glass and it browned  nicely. 

*Note: I used oil rather than margarine, which we don't keep- worked fine. Also, I didn't add the jalepeno this time... you can do that or not depending on your mood. It's a great basic recipe.

trying the recipe tonight.  I always bake cornbread in a cast iron skillet.  I oil up the pan then get it hot in the oven.  I pour the batter into the hot greased pan.  It creates a beautiful crust on the bread.

Just finished eating some--yummy!  The 3 bowl concept put me off at
first...but I had no mix, or the buttermilk other recipe's called
for, so I attempted it.  First off, let me admit that I altered the recipe (1 can or creamed corn in place of 1 cup of the milk, and 2
eggs instead of 3, plus the 7 1/4 x 11 3/4 pan I had avail) which I'm sure made a difference.  

Took an extra 7 minutes in the oven and was a little crumbly--but if
using the 3-bowl method gave it the rise and great taste that it has,
it was worth a few extra dirty bowls!!! I'd add an extra jalapeno to
my next batch though...

8-1-2016  ~Since I wasn’t planning on having any of this (I’ve been carb free for nearly two months) it didn’t bother me to make a cornbread I knew would be too sweet for me.  Hubs said he prefers it sweeter, so sweeter it was.  (Funny it should make a difference to him at all, since he’s no real corn bread fan in the first place)  But this was a pleasant surprise for both of us – I did give it a taste and it wasn’t nearly as sweet as its title would imply.  As for Hubs, he enjoyed it more than I thought he would and I’m thinking it was the added interest of the jalapeno that was the deciding difference.  (Due to his sensitive innards I used just half the amount called for and it was just right – even if you don’t have sensitive innards!)

This was the cornbread recipe that sounded the best to me on the internet (no corn, nice flour-to-cornmeal ratio, etc.) I made it today with a few alterations: I doubled the recipe and halved the sugar. I did not use jalapenos, and I'm sure they would've helped make the bread tastier, but I thought the batter needed some more flavour anyway. I added paprika, ancho chile powder and chipotle powder. If you find the right ratio, it makes the dough itself tasty. I also cooked some bacon and threw tiny crispy pieces into the bread. Then, I used the bacon fat instead of butter. It came out great. I do wish I could've used jalapenos (picky eaters here,) and I think some cheddar on top would go great. Overall a good solid cornbread recipe. I will definitely use it again.

To quote my BF "This is what cornbread should taste like!"
I didn't change a thing except turning them into muffins and baking for only 15-20 mins topping each muffin with a thin slice of jalapeno.  So cute and perfect!

This was great. Just a little sweet with a hot kick. It was moist and had the perfect density. I accidentally bought cornmeal mix at the store so I had to adjust the recipe for that. I used 3 cups of the mix so I just left out the flour, baking powder and salt. I think I could have used about 1/2 cup more because it took longer to cook. Loved it. A keeper.

Great cornbread recipe! I used 3 jalapenos, added a handful of cheddar cheese to it and when it was finished drizzled some honey over it. It was delish!

This was soooooooo good. The best cornbread ever. I'll definitely be making this again. I used real butter lol instead of margarine. I did follow the instructions provided with 3 bowls. I used 1 cup of sugar. Mixture of powdered turbinado and white sugar. I baked the cornbread on 400° for 20 minutes but it wasn't ready so I put it back in on 325° for another 10 minutes. I put foil on top though because I didn't want it any browner. It came out perfectly. I'd suggest letting it cool for 15-20 minutes. I couldn't wait though! It'll crumble so be careful. Omg it's so good. I used whole milk and greased my 9x13 glass pan with EVOO. It's a cornbread cake!! You have to open your mouth big to eat it. That's my kind of cornbread ;-) ;-) ;-)  thank you!!

I used less sugar and less jalapenos and the cornbread came our delicious with just a hint of spicy and sweet.

I actually made it gluten free by using corn flour and it came out better than the first time I made it with regular flour which was a little dryer than the corn flour version.

I used a half cup of sugar and could have gone with a quarter of  a cup.  Corn is sweet to begin with.  I also used jarred jalapenos and it was great!  I like the ration of corn meal to flour.  So many recipes use too much flour.

The only thing I changed is that I used butter instead of margarine. The cornbread is bland and so dry. I'll be sticking with recipes that have a 1:1 ratio of flour and cornmeal from now on.

This is a great recipe, even if you leave out the jalapenos. I sometimes substitute sweet red peppers. The consistency is like cake & the flavor is sweet & indulgent!

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a 8X8 pan. I added a small amount of chopped  red bell pepper and onion along with the jalapeno. I also added 1/4 cup yogurt to keep it moist. It was moist and delicious.

This was terrible. The driest, most crumbly cornbread I've ever made. I have a great recipe for this already but thought I'd try another one for a change. Worst mistake ever.  I make cornbread about once/month, and Ive been avidly baking and cooking for 25+ years.  Look elsewhere for a good recipe.

This was tasty and attractive - I added a bit of red pepper. The problem was that it crumbled like crazy. Could it be because I didn't use the 3 pots?

I don't ever remember liking cornbread, nevermind making it. I like this recipe. I used red jalapeños - a little sweeter; less heat. To be perfectly honest... I forgot the baking powder. Having said that, as far as I and my cornbread loving wife can tell, it looks just like the picture (but with red jalapeños) and tastes amazing.

It was very good.  A little too fluffy for my taste.  More like a cake!  It would be great for sopping up gravy or other such liquids, ie red beans and rice, jambalaya, etc.  I will definitely make it again but will cut the baking soda down to 2.5 teaspoons, and will add probably two cups of whole kernel corn.   Maybe 1.5 cups corn...   Oh yea Instead of 2/3 cup sugar I will try 1/3 to 1/4 cup.  I used a 12 inch Cast Iron Skillet (preheated to temp and about .5 Tablespoon of coconut oil in pan) and it filled it up fine  and was still 2.5 to 2.75 inches high!  It is the best Jalapeno Cornbread recipe I have found so far!

This is great without any changes needed.  I omitted the jalapenos as I am using the cornbread for stuffing,  next time I make it I'll add them.  My partner lived in the south for a few years,  said it treated as good as any he had in Georgia. It has just the right amount of sweetness,  and is very light.

I didn't have any jalapenos so I used habanero. I put it in a tin foil pan and baked it on the barbeque, it turned out really well.

Very tasty. Do the 3 bowl method - turns out so fluffy! I use 3 jalapeños & 1 Anaheim and it comes out barely spicy; so don't fear the jalapeños :)

I made this for the first time for Super Bowl Sunday to go with the homemade chili.  I used pickled sliced Jalapeños and also added sun-dried tomatoes in oil.  I topped the cornmeal with grated parmesan and cheddar cheese the last few minutes of baking.  It turned out perfect.  Definitely would make this again.  Don't be afraid to be inventive, add whatever you want to the batter.

Pretty solid recipe.  I would say a full cup of diced jalapeno is a bit much for most people. I used two peppers, each about 3-4" long and that was enough to allow the peppers to showcase themselves without becoming the star of the show.  If you cook this recipe in a cast iron cornbread pan you should check doneness at 20 minutes

Very good. I made it a wee bit healthier. Used 1/3 cup whole wheat flour & 1 cup of all purpose. Add 1/2 cup pureed cauliflower & u couldn't taste it at all. Subbed 1 of the eggs for egg white & used 1/4 cup of truvia. It was plenty sweet for me with a bite of spice from the jalapenos. I may leave out half the butter next time. Good stuff.

just a note that diced, sauteed sweet onion is also a good addition to the jalapeno cornbread.  i make it simple and use the K_______ brand honey cornbread mix as the base for the recipe.  very yummy!   also good with a little shredded cheddar thrown in.

This was really delicious. Family loved it as a BBQ side. I was happy because I was worried the family would think it was too spicy. I only used one jalapeño for that reason. Delicious!

Made this dish to pair with some cabbage soup and it was delicious. I had to cut down on the peppers to ensure the kids could enjoy it. Next time I will make a separate pan bc I love jalapeños. I would appreciate any tips on making my bread more fluffy next time around.

This is delicious cornbread. Although we loved it. I will reduce the sugar a little next time. I prefer my food to be less sweet than my husband does. I will search for a happy medium.

Easy to make. Chopping a cup of jalepenos took the most time.  Made it for a chili cook off and it fared about the same as the other 2 cornbread options.

Just finished making this. First time ever making cornbread and it's amazing. I substituted butter for margarine, did half a cup of sugar with about a tablespoon of maple syrup and brushed some butter and maple syrup on the top after it came out of the oven.  Highly recommended.

One of the best cornbreads I've ever made!  Not too sweet (although if you want it sweeter just add more sugar).  I halved the jalapenos and added 2/3c shredded cheese.  Poured it in to a hot cast iron skillet and baked it in the oven.  Kids LOVED it!

I left out the jalapeños and it came out awesome!! Used three bowls and that totally made a difference, then only using one. Was moist, soft and very well made.

FINALLY!!!!  A cornbread recipe that actually turned out for me!  I'm a fairly decent cook but baking is not my strong point.  I have tried several scratch cornbread recipes and they always miss the mark in one way or another.  For me, this one turned out A-OK.  I changed the serving amount to six, because there are just three of us here.  And I followed another reviewer's advice and just used one bowl.  I also added a little more sugar because I'm a sweet cornbread fiend - I must admit - it was probably a little too sweet after that.  And instead of fresh jalapenos, I used pickled, because that was all I had.  The cornbread was maybe a tiny bit crumbly but I didn't follow the steps correctly so that may be why.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  (Oh, and I added a little salt.)

Made it for a gathering. Most people enjoyed it. Used Anaheim peppers so spice was mild which turned out well as the gathering I took it to didn't really care for hot foods. I'll make it again for myself but will use jalapeno peppers as I prefer a little heat. As some others suggested I did add a cup of corn and shredded cheddar. Worth making again. Would probably be great with a bowl of chili or stew.

Delicious with nice bursts of heat from the jalapenos! The only thing I did differently was use butter instead of margarine. You can even freeze your leftovers for later, and it's just as good!

Great taste.   Directions easy to follow. Light taste and not greasy or oily .  Next time I'll add fresh corn and a handful of cheese for  variation.  This is my new favorite recipe.

with most jalapeno cornbread recipes with jalapeno cornbread ratio is usually off but with this one there was a perfect amount of jalapeno. I did one cup of sugar because I like my cornbread on the sweeter side, but other than that I did it exactly as the recipe said

I made this twice.  The first one I threw out because the toothpick was clean and I let the bread  sit for a half hour.  The center sank and was not cooked.  I bought a bigger pan and the second time it was fine.  I liked the flavor (used whole cup of sugar)and would probably make again.  Next time I will add some cheddar cheese.

I did make a few changes  to the recipe. I used coconut oil instead of butter. Used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of chopped jalapenos. Baked it in an oiled preheated cast iron skillet @375 degrees for 28 minutes. A very good recipe.

This cornbread is sooooo good.  I followed directions aside from the amount of jalapeno.  I had only about a half cup worth of jalapenos.  It still came out pretty spicy with a hint of sweetness....delicious!  I seriously couldn't stop eating it. Served with chili on a cool Indiana fall day while watching football...perfection!

This recipe was AWESOME!  I shared it with my neighbor, some friends and some family and they all raved over it.  The only change I made was that I used unsweetened butter in place of the margarine.  I'm going to make it again this week and will replace 1/2 of the butter with coconut oil which should make it a little lighter.  It was moist much to my surprise too!

well, I just made this to go with red beans & rice. It is good, but I felt like the jalapeno flavor overpowered the cornbread flavor? Which is why I went with 4??'s. 
It has a nice texture and it comes out of the oven looking perfect!  But, if I make this again I think I would cut the jalapeno's down to a half cup and maybe increase the sugar slightly. Oh, I did add 1 cup of cheddar cheese, as some here suggested, and I was using up frozen jalapeno's from last season. So, that may have affected my results to. 
Still, I would recommend it to all!

Very good flavor!  I wanted to use maple syrup instead of processed sugar so the batter didn't look like a muffin batter - it was very grainy.  Baked in muffin cups and they turned out just fine.  Do be sure to use rubber gloves to chop the jalapenos.  I know better, but I was in a hurry so I skipped them and paid for it all night.

Why use 3 bowls, too much to wash.  I'm with Tea's single bowl method, it turned out fine.  Mix wet ingredients, eggs, milk and honey in main bowl, then add dry ingredients.   I used 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar and 1 can Ortega chilies, that way it was not too hot for my family.  You can also add 1 cup cheddar cheese

Made this with gumbo and it turned out great!! Was nervous because it was for a group of people but I'll be making it again and again.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Seeded the jalapeños because the gumbo is spicy.  Otherwise, left the recipe as is.  The 3 bowl thing was a little off-putting (because I'm lazy on cleanup) but I just used two large measuring cups.

excellant.. a little hot for the one person who didnt care for spicy food much but the rest of us who love hot food.. it was great.. if you or someone else dont care for the heat factor as much just do half the pepper amount and try that.

I made this bread just how it says on the recipe and it's delicious! I just cut everything in half though cause the original makes way too much for just 2 people.

I made this last night to bring to a pot luck today at work.  I added some diced up red pepper for color and used sugar substitute instead of the regular sugar. - Yummy!

So much better than the store bought packages.  I like that it wasn't too sweet either, just right.  I did halved the recipe and it was perfect for a 8x8 pan.

Great cornbread recipe!  I have way more peppers in my garden than I know what to do with.  I didn't have margarine, so I used butter and it worked just fine.  Also, I've already pickled all of my jalapeños, so I used garden salsa peppers instead.  I took the suggestion at the bottom and reduced the sugar, because I like only slightly sweet cornbread.
