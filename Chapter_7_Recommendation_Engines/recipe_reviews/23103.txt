I have used this recipe twice.  The first time the rice was ok but better with a few modifications.  Cooking the rice ahead of time and refrigerating it makes a big difference.  I didnt have the time the first time to do this.  also, i used regular oil and sesame oil to fry the rice in and the sesame oil added a much needed flavor.  i used frozen peas and carrots and chopped onion and added the beaten egg over the mixture and cooked until the rice was no longer shiny.  Cooking the egg this way worked better for me than frying it in advance.  I cooked the bean sprouts seperately in sesame oil and soy sauce and added it to the rice in the end.  YUMMY.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Typically I make rice and no one eats it but me. I tried this recipe and my family complained that I didnt make enough rice. This is a very easy, low mess way of doing it. I added my egg to the boiling water/soy mixture and beat it like I would egg drop soup. Added the rice, some green onion tops, black pepper to taste. I used chicken broth instead of water or boullion as well. Doing it that way I didnt' need any salt either, it was perfect (I'm a saltaholic and it was still fine). Very nice, thanks.

Ever have your husband tell you at the last minute he needed to bring a side dish to a cookout?  That was my night.  So i searched through my cabinets and realized that i hadn't been to the store lately, but i did have a TON of rice.  I searched for rice and found this.  

I did not make this expecting it to taste like my usual Chinese bistro's rice, i made it because i had all the ingredients, it was cheap and it could feed a lot of people.

I cooked the rice the night before and refrigerated it.  In the morning i did the rest.  I doubled the recipe.  The only soy sauce i had was a handful of the little packets, and it was enough.. .more than enough.  I couldn't have made this had the rice not been refrigerated over night.

I added Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, the red Chinese sauce with the rooster on the bottle, about a teaspoon.  It really spiced it up.  Gave it a great taste, just a little kick.

It was a hit at the cook out.  Cheap, quick and tasty... what more could you ask for?

I was afraid I would mess this up because I have never made anything like this before.  I took some ideas from other recipes and it turned out delicious. I added some scrambled egg, carrot, celery, mushrooms, and diced ham. Used Peanut oil, hot garlic sauce, a dash of ginger. We will be making this many times again, my husband ate all of it..no left overs! Thanks for the idea.

Just what it claims to be. It is easy to make, and taste just like the fried rice you get in a resturant. My kids love it! Thanks for posting it!!!

Just loved this! I kept finding things to add in. Minced pickled ginger,fresh garlic,bell pepper,carrot,last of the fresh peas from the garden. I did leave out the sprouts, just didn't have any on hand. I used leftover sushi rice too. I served it with Simple Stir Fry over it and even my picky picky kid ate it right up! Thanks for sharing this!

Tho this was indeed great, i find i'm still looking for the Perfect fried rice recipe. I'd recommend washing the rice in ice water a couple of times before starting.

This recipe had a decent (if bland) flavour, but the end results didn't pan out for me so well. This was less the recipe's fault and more me trying to cut down on the amount of pans used (COOK THE EGG SEPERATELY-- DON'T BREAK IT ON TOP; it makes the rice mushy). I also found the amount of water-to-rice ratio in Step 1 too much-- follow the directions for whatever rice you get and add the stock-cube. Even all that, though, doesn't take away that the taste of this recipe is just "so-so."

The chicken bouillion cubes do make this dish a little salty, but that's just what is needed to add to an otherwise bland dish. The veggies don't really do anything for it, and the soy sauce only adds to the saltiness level. Not for those who are trying to keep their sodium levels low, or just prefer take-out instead. We weren't really impressed.

This was a pretty standard tasting fried rice.  I used frozen peas and carrots, and I omitted the bean sprouts.  Easy to make!

Tried this recipe instead of the packet seasoning that I usually use. Didn't turn out that great. I think I will just stick to buying the seasoning.

Very good flavour, even with the soy sauce (which I don't like).  I added shrimp to this, but my husband still asked where the pork was.

Really did taste like the fried rice you would get at a Japanese steak house! Did have any veggies besides the onions but it was still great! Nice and moist!

Sorry, I should have known better than to try this - instant rice is not the way to make fried rice.  I normally have leftover rice when I make fried rice, but had none, so tried this recipe because I was hungry for fried rice and was short on time - bad idea.  Note to anyone who likes authentic Chinese style fried rice - never use a recipe that uses instant rice - it will not taste like good fried rice.

This was delicious rice. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and made the rice according to the directions on the package which were equal amounts liquid and rice. I also added some frozen peas and carrots. It turned out fantastic. Next time I might add some sesame oil to add a different flavour.

A recipe I would give four stars to because of my changes, but it tasted soooo good, I think it's worth the five! To start with, I cut the recipe in half. I made the rice around 10 am, stuck it in the fridge, and fried it up around 5 pm, which worked well. I used regular rice cooked in water with chicken bouillon. I used maybe 1/3 cup onion, didn't have snow peas or sprouts so I used about ½ cup celery plus a small can of sliced mushrooms. I stir fried the onion, celery, and mushrooms together before adding the rice. I used two eggs (remember, I halved the recipe), cooked up in a separate pan. Once they were scrambled, I mixed them and the rice in with the stir-fried vegetables. Personally, I really like soy sauce, so I used more like 1½ TBS for my half batch. I added a sprinkle of ground ginger, but I didn't notice it. If I decide to add ginger again, I'll have to add a little more. It turned out really tasty, although it was REALLY sticky. I think it was the rice (cheap rice!), and in the future I'll either use instant rice or a better quality of regular rice. Thanks for a great recipe, it DID taste a lot like what you might get in a restaurant!

This was really good but I had to had another egg. I think that was partly my fault by trying to double the recipe on my own not thinking about converting and i put in 2 CUPS OF RICE! haha. A little too much for 2 people. (5 stars)

Great and easy. You can use any kind of veggies in this. I have used canned mixed veggies, corn, peas. It is so fast to whip up with refrigerating the rice over night. Can use as a side dish or add chicken or shrimp and use as a main dish.

This was a tasty dish but not like any takeout I've had.  I made it to pair with General Tsao's Chicken on this site because my husband can't stand plain white rice.  I'll make this again but only to go with the chicken.  Not a stand alone dish.

This recipe turned out excellent, my family loved it and my husband asked for seconds...which is always good!  I did end up adding about a tbsp more of soy sauce, simply because our family likes a bit more flavour.  However I think it needed something else, so next time I'm going to try some garlic and maybe cumin or some other spices.

Wonderful fried rice starter.  I added things I had like leftover pork and left out things I didn't have like bean sprouts.  It was a good basic recipie and easy to modify.

Frankly, I was a little disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I thought it lacked flavor. I then added considerably more soy sauce, and it was still bland.  If I try it again, I may cook the rice with beef boullion instead of chicken, and perhaps add some ginger or other spice to liven it up a bit.  This just didn't do it for us.

This was a nice dish to serve under 'Orange Chicken Stir Fry' from AR.  My rice was frozen, but it had been cooked in chicken broth before frozen.  I added some frozen peas and carrots because the dish was pretty bland in color without them, and I like color in our meals.  Fresh ginger would have been a nice addition to this recipe.  We also had spring rolls with this to finish off the meal.

I didn't have all the veggies and stuff, I kind of improvised. I used sweet onions, celery, and carrots. Sautéed them in teriyaki and soy sauce, then added the rice, more soy, more teriyaki, eggs (extra) until it was to taste. It needed a little kick so I put a small amount of garlic powder in it. Made it perfect. So delicious. I've been looking for a good fried rice recipe for ages. Love this!

Oh my gosh, I can't believe people don't think this recipe is that good.  I have made it twice now and it has turned out GREAT both time.  You have to remember to make the rice the day before and refrigerate it. I think this rice taste just like the restaurants.

I didn't think this was that great, the rice was very mushy. I think the amount of liquid should be reduced a bit. The box on the instant rice asked for much less than the recipe. I will try again, but without as much liquid.

Quick, delicious and oh so easy!  I used frozen peas and carrots in place of the snow peas.  I also ommited the bean sprouts because I didn't have any, but I think I will try to use them next time for an added something.  Served it with Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site and steamed broccoli.  Makes great leftovers.  I will definately be making this one again.

Great recipe! I had two Chinese teachers living with me for a few months and this was a staple for them. I tried it this morning (on my own). I used organic, brown jasmine rice that I had cooked the other night - one jalapeno pepper, 1/2 shallot, carrots and chopped romaine (the teachers always used this!)Fried all this with a little bit of oil, made a 'well' in the middle of the pan, added the egg and scrambled the whole thing then added a teaspoon of black or dark soy sauce. Very good! I think they would have been proud of me!!!!

I made this at the last minute because I wanted something with rice and tofu and didn't know what else to do. I added carrots, a whole onion, and a little over a cup of the bean sprouts. I also used two eggs and some tofu in order to try and up the protein content. I didn't have time to refrigerate my brown rice, so it came out with a weird texture. But it was tasty, and that was the most important thing. Oh, I also added some rice wine vinegar to it to give it some more of a kick. Also, cheap!

This was really good.  If you're making this on the fly, you don't have to chill overnight--just be aware that your rice will come out a little "mushy" and the texture won't be quite as authentic.  It'll still taste great though!

This was really great fried rice. You will need a pretty large pan to fry it in as it makes quite a bit. I only used about 3/4 of the fried egg per our preference but the recipe is a good one. I appreciate the tips about frying the egg separately and chilling the rice overnight. This is the third time I have made fried rice and the last time I made it I added the uncooked egg into the rice mixture and it made a real mess. I also think the consistency of the chilled rice makes it fry properly. By far my favorite fried rice recipe so far!! Thank you for sharing.

I loved this simple dish. I made it into a one pan recipe. I also used a more healthy brown rice and I had frozen peas on hand and used them instead of snow peas. I have already filed this one away for future use.

This was great. I used regular long grain rice I cooked and refrigerated overnight, then I sauteed the onion in melted margarine and added a little hot oil with the cubes of chicken boullion before adding the cooked rice. I didn't have any snow peas or bean sprouts, but it was still tasty with just rice, onion, seasoning and egg. Will definitely make this again.

That's the KEY!! Use cold rice you made the night before. I never thought it made a diffrence..but it makes ALL the difference. I used regular rice, but still it was great. Thanks for the tip and the great recipe!

The chicken broth and soy are the only things giving this flavor!  It needs less salt, more seasoning.  I added garlic, ginger, sesame oil, pepper 5 spice powder and turmeric.  In other words...not this recipe.

I added garlic and ginger with onion.l  Additional veges were asparagus, mushrooms, shredded carrots. I also cooked the eggs alone first, then added at the end. I also have started using cauliflower rice, and cannot tell the difference.  Makes a great lower carb meal.

This was a nice, colorful dish. I sauteed the onions and a few cloves of garlic, then scrambled in the egg. Then I added frozen veggies (carrots, green beans, and corn), and then the bean sprouts. Last I added the cooked rice and the seasonings. It goes very nicely with chicken.

Flavor was fine, but turned into a mushy mess.

We tryed this recipe tonight and it was disappointing. The picture looked great. The flavor was ok. The recipe seemed easy enough, but the instruction are off by far. 4 cups of water for 2 cup of instant rice! Wow, that was way to much. What we did different was :
 We used 1and a1/3 cup water, and our rice didn't come out like pudding. We cooked the eggs separate from everything else. Insted of snow peas and the sprouts, we used a small can of peas and carrots. It did taste like restaurant after all those changes.

On this recipe, I substituted 3 packs of Uncle Ben's Boil-n-Bag brown rice and made it the same day right along with the recipe. Only change I made was using chicken broth granules instead of the dry cubes which I never use.  I used about 2 tablespoons of the granules in the water which I boiled the rice in. Once the rice was done in about 10-15 mins, I removed them from the water and put them in the refridge for about 15 mins while cutting up and preparing the rest of the recipe. After the 15 mins passed, I squeezed the extra liquid out of each bag and added it into the rest of the sauteing ingredients before adding the eggs.  From there I followed the remainder of the recipe.  You can adjust the amount of soy sauce to lower the sodium content. I served this recipe along with the Szechwan Shrimp also on this website. I served them separately in order to enjoy the flavors of each dish by them selves.  Both were great recipes. The family loved them both.

I followed this exactly how it states, the rice was mushy when I tried to fry it. We ended up buying Chinese food. Not sure if it was something I did or not, but i will not try to make it again.

This is one of the best, most authentic fried recipes I've tried thus far. I've made it twice and it's been gobbled up each time.  I don't use the rice recipe listed above though.  I usually just prepare twice the amount of rice on a prior night and save it in the fridge for this recipe.

I love this...easy AND delicious.  I used brown rice instead and a bag of frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, corn, green beans).  I sauteed the onion and mixed veggies first with a little Smart Balance butter.  Then used coconut oil added the egg and cooked it along with the veggies for a bit then added the rice and finally soy sauce.  It is awesome.  Just like take out.  YUM.

This is a great recipe.  You defineltey need to refrigerate the cooked rice overnight.  Makes all the difference.  I left outhe the sprouts because I don't like them and added more soy sauce because I left 2 teaspoons was definetly too little. But to each his own.

Did everyone else only use 2 cups of rice for this recipe? I've made it twice and both times I've used 4 cups of rice due to the needed 4 cups of water. At least those are the ratios that my instant rice work by, I also figured that the water would never be absorbed if I only used 2 cups of instant rice. Well, I love this recipe, I use the same ratios for everything else, except I up the oil to 4 TBsp., and I like eggs so I add 4 instead of 3, I also simplify it by adding a 16 oz bag of frozen peas and carrots as opposed to all the other vegetables. Has turned out great both times!

The first time I made this, it was pretty bland.  The second time, I still refrigerated the rice overnight (that helps) and cooked the eggs separately, but I didn't make it with chicken bouillon (didn't seem to matter) or use bean sprouts.  I added a little teriyaki sauce and sriracha hot pepper sauce, and extra onions and garlic. With those alterations, it tasted just like takeout!

They were ok.  It just didn't taste like the ones from a Chinese or Japanese restaurant that I was craving.  Maybe it was the type of soy sauce that I used.

Next time I'll use the rice it called for, i used jasmine rice and it was just too sticky, i did split up the oil by using sesame and veggie, it gave it a real good flavor.
I skipped the sprouts and used other veggies i had on hand, thanks for sharing

This recipe turned out good.  I poured the beaten egg over the rice mixture and cooked together instead of making it in two separate steps (although it did make the rice gooey.)  I added quite a bit more soy sauce and also some garlic and ginger for more flavor.

I didn't like this recipe at all and I really wish I did cuz I love fried rice... It was very bland, the flavor just wasn't there. Tried to add some chicken that didn't help either... back to the drawing board.

This was a good fried rice recipe, although I did make some changes to it; I think its a good base for a general fried rice recipe. I omited the peas. I also made it with brown rice instead and it tastes great! I added an extra egg, extra carrots, extra bean sprouts, more soy sauce, and a pinch of crushed chili flakes. I like it a lot. Thanks!

It's totally impossible to make restaurant style fried rice at home, but this comes very close. To keep this a one-pan recipe I fried the onions, then scrambled the eggs in the same pan, then mixed everything together to fry. The other change was that I added a couple dashes of sesame oil. Also, mine was VERY lumpy, so I put the lid on the pan to soften the leftover rice. Very good and fast!

I was looking for a quick fried rice recipe to go with Crab Rangoon III and Springfield Cashew Chicken recipes(all fabulous but, cooked all together it was a lot of work)! I had white rice already made and left over from the day before. i had no veggies. so, i just threw the already prepared rice in the skillet with the oil, soy, and eggs and it was a great quick fix. I will try this recipe in future.

after reading reviews i changed this around a bit. i sauteed the vegies first (red & green capsicums, onion, peas, garlic & corn), then added bean sprouts, then rice and finally the egg (which i had scrambled first). I also used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. we had this as a main meal (we're vegetarian) & it was absolutely delicious! yum!  also, a great idea to refrigerate the rice (i made the rice in the morning & cooked it that night).

I have never made fried rice before but this recipe made it super easy. I had regular instead of instant rice, I didn't have time to refridgerate overnight so I spread the cooked rice onto a plate and put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes, stirring a couple times. Worked great! I didn't have the veggies so I just had onion and egg and bit of garlic salt to add flavor.  Cooked the eggs and set them aside as my rice cooled, then put them all back in my egg pan to fry (saved an extra dish)  My boyfriend loved it, said it tasted almost like what you get at the Chinese restaurants. Next time will plan ahead and have the veggies.

Very good! Even more flavorful if you get real soy sauce from local Asian market. Also, used jasmine rice for extra flavor, cooked it, and put in in the freezer...stirred it every ten minutes or so and it was cool within a 1/2 hour and ready to go! Served with the General Tsoa's on this site.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice, easy change from your regular rice. I cut down on onion, used a frozen mixed veggie instead and didn't add bean sprouts (none on hand). Super quick and yummy. Thanks!

I've made this several times with left-over regular rice and a variety of vegetables.  It is a very good basic recipe.  My family loves it and asks for it regularly.  I even add left-over bits of chicken and call it the whole meal.

This recipe was alright.  Next time I won't do the snow peas.  The ones I used added too much of their flavor.  I'm going to do more garlic next time.  I served it with beef stir-fry.  It was good, it just wasn't awesome.

Made this rice with Asian orange chicken also found on this site.The two recipes were a perfect match.Putting the rice in the fridge overnight is important,or at least I think so.It was the best fried rice I ever made.Thanks.

This was my first attempt at fried rice, and it was a success!!! I halved the recipe, but love eggs so I added some extra. I also put in some corn and bell peppers, i was also very generous with the soy sauce

Ok. Nothing special... very plain, not really like what I've gotten from Chinese places at all. Edible, but I wouldn't make it again.

This came out good for us - had less rice so used 2 eggs (just beat them and then tossed them into the hot rice - I dont like big chunks of egg). First, stir fried the onion with some julienned carrot and shelled edamame. The cut up a half dozen shrimp and threw them in too - came out as a great side and used up my leftover rice from chinese takeout the other day. Thanks!

I made the rice with a frozen bag of stif fry veggies I found in the supermarket (great time saver!).  I also added fresh bean sprouts.  The rice turned out well, but I didn't have enough veggie oil to fry the rice very well.  Having cold rice is the key to this one!!  I will keep making :)

This is great!  I serve it with Chinese Roast Chicken with Gravy (be sure to stuff your chicken with onions and fresh ginger)

Pretty good.  I didn't soak overnight instead I just prepared rice as usual.  It turned out a little dry but that's because I'm just learning how to cook still! *smile* Good taste.
