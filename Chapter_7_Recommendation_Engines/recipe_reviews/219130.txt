Our family thought the flavor of seasoning was different.  Not what we were expecting.  Next time, I won't use the McCormick packet, but use my own favorite BBQ sauce instead.

Delicious! The pork turns out very soft and juicy. I followed this recipe exactly except I couldn't find the pulled pork seasoning mix so I kind of made my own and used cumin, coriander, paprika, chilli powder and garlic salt. It was so easy and very tasty!

This is the easiest, and according to my husband, the best, meal I've ever made. Super yummy and even better the next day.

I used pork tenderloin in the slow cooker. It's good, but it could use a little more seasoning.

My family didn't like the flavor at all.  Next time I will use our favorite homemade bbq sauce recipe.

I didn't have the seasoning and I had to empty some of the cooking juices or it would have been watery BUT I added some of my own BBQ sauce on top of maybe 1/2 a cup of the cooking juices and it was delicious!

Fantastic and easy to make. I have made this 4 times for family, coworkers and friends and everyone loved it!  They even asked how long it took me to cook this.  They just don't know.  EASY!!! I used the Pepperidge wheat sliders or the Hawaiian sweet rolls.  Really good!!!

Super easy to make except the 4 hours wasn't enough time. After 5, I still had to slice with a knife, definately slow cook for 8. Overall good flavor and the kids loved it with sweet rolls.

This was awesome!  Next time I'll brown the outside first to have the crispy bits.
I used the Club House seasoning mix, and dark brown sugar.
