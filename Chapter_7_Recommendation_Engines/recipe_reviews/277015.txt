Made this as written leaving out the optional chicken and tofu. I realize this is Hot and Sour soup and I like sour but as written this is WAY too sour. The soup is extremely spicy as well and I like spicy but you'll want to cut back if you are sensitive to it. I am still giving this 4 stars because this will be my go to from now on only I'll be reducing the vinegar by half.
