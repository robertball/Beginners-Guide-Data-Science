I was able to make this without a bread machine by mixing wet and dry ingredients separately, then folding the dry into the wet, and baking at 350 until browned. This is a good basic recipe that I look forward to playing with more. One easy addition was swirling raisins, cinnamon and  a bit of brown sugar into it. I'll probably try a garlic and olive addition next if it's Celiac approved. Thanks!

I have been trying to find a good gluten free bread for my husband and this is by far the best.  Both for texture (it actually rose and had air pockets) and for taste, it is similar to wheat bread.  One technical note, if you try to make it with a bread machine like I did, make sure to check your machine because mine had trouble mixing the dough; it was so dense.  I had to keep scraping the edges and helping it along.  As for the recipe, I didn't have millet flour so I just added some sweet sorghum flour and more rice flour (only had brown).  I also added threw in some flax seed after reading other reviewer.  I used rice milk as a substitute for the skim milk.  I followed the advice to mix the rice flour with the milk before adding it to the mixture and I think that helped.

this makes great pizza bread. We spread it in a jelly roll pan, brush with a little olive oil or sometimes with a light coating of pizza sauce and then bake/freeze. My son can have pizza any time now! :-)

This is the 1st gluten free recipe that has worked. I have a Cuisinart Convection Bread Machine; it is hard finding gluten free recipes that don't take alot of different flours. This recipe I adjusted the flour as follows: I only had Red Mill GF All Purpose Baking Flour and brown rice flour. I used 1 3/4 C. GF All Purpose Baking Flour and 1 1/2 C. brown rice flour. The bread came out beautifully. My husband and I aren't GF intolerant, only my daughter, and we really enjoyed the bread too. Thank you, Rene49

This bread was delicious with character and I will make it again. 
In response to  harlequin1031's comment: APPLE CIDER is made strictly from APPLES. APPLE CIDER VINEGAR is made strictly from APPLES. It is one of the few vinegars that are considered safe for Celiacs. When in doubt about an ingredient, always do your research, it will broaden the horizons of what you previously thought you could not have.

Ok, I changed it so much, it may not be the same recipe anymore! Took out the vinegar, changed the honey to Karo syrup, delete the millet flour and double the garbanzo bean flour. Tricks: proof the yeast in some of the warm milk and a tsp of sugar - set aside and add about 20 minutes after the flours have been moistened with the warm milk. The best trick: do NOT use a bread machine; otherwise, I always ended up with a white, solid brick, then my husband said he could sell at Home Depot in the building materials dept. I used a potato masher. Spray 2 loaf pans, sprinkle with corn meal before pouring half the dough into each pan. Smooth over the tops with a wet spoon, then paint on an egg wash, then brush them with a little Karo syrup. Wow - light, spongey, tender bread with a crispy brown crust. I did add a photo to the recipe page, the browned loaves with butter spread over the slice I am holding.

I made it exactly as written. This tastes nice, but even letting it rise for almost 2 hours, it still didn't rise much and is pretty solid. I've had better luck with gf breads that are more bean flour based.

I have been looking for just the right GF loaf bread recipe and finally found this!  I have made it twice now.  My only changes: I add in 3 eggs not just 1 egg and egg whites, and I PAN ROAST THE CHICKPEA FLOUR until brown to take away that bit of bitter after taste that besan tends to give baked goods.  Found that tidbit on a Middle Eastern recipe site a while ago.  The only thing is that it is too much batter for my one pan (I bake at 350 for 1 hour) but not enough for two so I will have to tweak it a bit to get two loaves.  Remember: Most GF bread 'dough' isn't dough - it is a very thick batter - this one included.  Kind of like frosting in it's consistency.  I have seen some postings that comment about it being 'wet'.  It will be wetter than you think if you are not familiar with GF bread just yet.  Hands down this is the best bread out there so far - even out of all the GF baking books I have - and it's a no contest alternative to the nasty, tasteless loaves available in stores.    Thank you Alison, whomever you are!

Finally a bread my wheat allergic daughter can eat, and that does not resemble cardboard! 

I've made it several times now and I'm contemplating making a double batch in the breadmaker, only because it's such a dense loaf, I'm baking every other day it seems.

Wow!! Awesome!! I have been making gluten-free bread for my daughter for almost 15 years (she's 17) and this is the BEST recipe I've ever tried - and I've tried many. The flavour is amazing, and the texture is incredibly soft and moist - not crumbly like so many GF breads.
I think I, myself, prefer this over regular bread! Didn't have xanthan gum on hand so I substituted guar gum, and didn't have millet flour so I substituted other GF flours I had on hand. Also, I added about 1/4 cup of ground flax - I add ground flax to every GF baking to add extra fibre.

Alison, thank you!  

This recipe has just created a HUGE loaf of GF sandwich slices for my husband - perfect!!

He states it is essentially the same flavor of store bought, but much moister, and overall better texture quality than the miniature loaves they've been selling us for $6 a pop.

Here are the minor changes I made, due to my pantry:

Used 3 cups Bob's Red Mill GF Flour for all the various to begin, adding about 1/2 cup in the mixing process to proper consistency (heavy cake batter type).

2 whole eggs
1/4 cup coconut oil
used whole milk instead of skim

I put this in the bread machine on the dough cycle, let it rise once there.  Moved it to a loaf pan after coating it in olive oil and dusting the pan with corn meal.

The second rise behaved beautifully, the baking superb.  Sliced it with an electric knife as though it were a regular homemade loaf of bread!  :D

Thank you!  A keeper, I'll be using many times over!  :D

Very yummy. My husband has celiac disease, and we used to buy gluten-free bread from Whole Foods or Trader Joes for over $6.00 a loaf that tasted like cardboard and had slices that were extremely tiny. My husband felt depressed about the disease, so I bought a bread maker and started experimenting with some bread recipes. This is the first loaf of bread I made, and it is soooooooooo delicious. My husband uses this for his sandwiches and is soooooo happy. Thanks!

Excellent bread for open faced sandwiches and toast.  Was a little reluctant to try since I'm not a fan of grainy textured baked goods made with rice flour.  But this bread turned out much differently, almost like a butter loaf style bread.  Also I used my Kitchenaid mixer and then put dough in loaf pan in my car which was sitting in sun.  Dough rises very nicely on a warm day this way.  Try it.

Wow!  Very good!  I made without a bread machine.  Mixed dry ingredients, then wet ingredients, then combined with each other with a fork.  Proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup 100 degree milk with 1tsp sugar for 5 minutes.  Then stirred this into the rest.  Preheated convection oven to 450 for 30 min, then added pan of water - about 1 inch deep to bottom shelf and put loaves in center rack.  Baked at 325 for 25 minutes.  (I looked this trick up for bread in a convection oven - we just got one and everything cooks soooo fast and different - nice, but gotta ignore most recipe bake times.)  I've never even made regular bread cause I'm afraid of yeast rising, but this turned out well.  I let it sit covered on a heating vent for 25 min before baking - it rose a little, but I'm not sure how much it should rise?  But turned out great!  Oh - I also substituted the following:  1/2 tsp of stevia, no honey.  Used 2% milk, no prob.  Used 1 cup bobs red mill all purpose baking gluten free baking flour instead of tap and gar flour.  Used 1 and 3/4 cup white rice flour - no brown rice flour.  Also added 1/4 cup flaxseed meal.  I'd say this receipe makes ONE big loaf pan of bread - came out thick, but moist.  Could prob easily add bananas or more sugar to make into a cake if wanted :)  Thanks!!!!!

This is a yummy bread!! The first loaf lasted less than a day in our house. I have not used a bread machine and have made it several times by the mixing dry ingredients, then the wet (poofing yeast separately)  and combining the two. I also let the dough rise before baking. I have also made it with a variety of gluten free flours equal to 3 cups, none specific to the recipe. With my oven and cookware (blue silicone) I bake at 325 for 1hr. I would love it to take less time, but it's worth the wait! I look forward to trying it in the bread maker when I get the part I need.

Every weekend I try a new gluten-free bread recipe in my bread machine.  This was actually #8, and the first one with an actual taste to it, must be the bean flour.  I followed this recipe line for line, no variations.  It even tasted good right out of the bread machine warm with butter on it.  This is the one for me.

I substituted the Garbanzo and Millet flour w/ additional White Rice flour. Followed everything else exactly, then turned this into a tasty Onion, Garlic, Cheese bread!

I combined all original ingredients, then added about 1-1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese cubes, 1 large clove of minced garlic and 1/4 cup minced red onion (both garlic and onion sauteed in a little oil). I did not use a bread machine, but instead baked for 40-50 minutes on 350 until golden brown. Wonderful texture. Very moist!

I made non-gluten-free Cheese breads for Christmas and I didn't want my gluten-free friend left out. She loved it, as did I!

I give this 2 starts b/c the proportion of ingredients isn't right in the recipe. It would be soupy if you followed the directions. Either half the milk content, or add 3-4 MORE cups of flour than the recipe calls for. The end product was very delicious, a dense bread great with butter--but only b/c we added about 4 additional cups of flour.

I have made this bread over and over again.  I LOVE it!  I crave it!  It doesn't compare to the gluten free bread that you buy in the store.  This is moist, soft, and has an excellent flavor.  I have a decent bread machine, but not top of the line and I have never had a loaf that didn't turn out perfect.  My gluten tolerant family can eat "regular" bread, but fight me over this anyway. 

I add an extra 1/4 cup of rice flour to my machine.  And, I rarely use white rice flour...just all brown.  

Did I mention???  Amazing bread...thanks so much, Alison!

I liked this bread.  Didn't have a machine so made it the old fashion way.  Took some reviewers advice.  Warmed the milk to 100 degrees with a t. of sugar and added yeast.  Only had All purpose and brown rice flour.  So used those.  Used geletin mixed with cool water instead of xanthan gum and threw in some flax.  The best suggestion was to let it rise in the car.  It had a really nice texture.  I made 2 loafs and put a pan of water in the bottom of my oven once the convection had reach 450 degrees.  Then a turned down to 325 and cooked for 25 minutes.  Next time I will make one loaf.  It should be the right size and height that way for slicing for sandwiches.  Could use a little more sweet taste, but that may be because a didn't have the right flours.

This was my first gluten-free bread baking experience.  It turned out just fine.  After making a couple more recipes from this site, the flavor of this bread is more complex than the others - a good thing.  Maybe because of the bean flour.  Thanks!

This bread is fantastic!  I cannot even tell from the taste that it is wheat free.  I will be making my son this bread from now on instead of buying the horrible tasting stuff that he currently eats (although he doesn't know any difference).  Seriously, I cannot believe how great this bread is.  I had to use an egg replacer and rice milk instead of real eggs and milk due to his allergies and it turned out great.

I love this recipe i have tried it a few differnt ways to see what i like the best. I used 1 cups of a gluten free all purpose instead of the garbanzo bean, millet and brown rice. I then add 1.5 cups of white rice flour. I also add 3 whole eggs and 2 tbsp of flax seed it. Tonight i left out the flax seed and i was out of honey so i add 1/4 cup of apple sauce, it just as great

Very, very tasty.  but could use some help from you pros out there.  Mine turned out only 2 inches high (great for snacks.. hee, hee).  I've never baked bread before and it looks like Alison assumes we know how ... she does not include baking instructions.  OK, so I followed some of the review instructions;  No bread machine so mixed separately, & proofed yeast, then allowed to rise in low oven (150) for 1.5 hrs.   Then baked on regular oven at 325 for one hour.  So what went wrong?  Any comments or ideas?  Appreciate your help.  I want to try it again.  Thanks

Excellent Recipe - I use Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free baking flour because it's convenient.  It also is great in the bread machine with a traditional style loaf pan.  I add some ground seeds for texture.  :)  Fantastic!!

Excellent bread ! I don't have a bread machine so I mix the bread with my kitchen aid bread hook, and then I put the dough in loaf pans and let it rise for an hour. Then I let it bake in the oven for about an hour at 350. my whole family love this recipe. Thank you

I have tried alot of gluten free breads and been very disappointed. This is the first one that actually tastes good without being toasted. I tried it for grilled cheese sandwich and it was great. I will definitley keep making this one.

This bread is so great!!  I really can't believe how good it tastes.  My whole family is eating it (I make it for my wheat sensitive son) I have tried many gluten free breads and this is by far the best.  I have made it several times in my breadman pro.  I didn't need to stop it and scrape, I just let it go and it comes out perfect, no need to add anything extra.  I did also substitute rice milk for the skim milk and one time I cut the garbanzo bean flour in half and substitued oat flour and that was the best it came (not sure of oat flour for celiacs) There are a lot of ingredients but it's still worth it, it's what makes it taste so good. We will be making this weekly. Thanks for a great recipe

This was great! I've never made bread, let alone gluten free bread. I did kind of an adaptation to the recipe because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used one cup of Bob's Red Mill All Purpose, 1 1/2 cups of brown rice flower, and 1/2 cup of tapioca beads that I crushed up. (I read somewhere that that was the same as tapioca flower.) 
Since I didn't have a bread maker, I took Lori's advice as far as mixing and baking goes. 
I also added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, and was generous with some cinnamon. 
The bread came out beautifully! It's a sweeter bread, and is delicious with a bit of butter and some jam. 
Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be using it more! :)

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly. Have a cuisinart convection breadmaker and used the gluten free setting. It came out perfect! Great taste and wonderbread light- This is the first bread I've made that wasn't a pre-packaged mix-- which always turned out heavy and chalky. Will never go the mix route again.

I made this for my son after trying numerous premixes and following some other recipes in gf cookbooks.  My son said this is the best bread I have EVER made (that includes the homemade breads/buns that I bake weekly). 

I do not have a bread maker, so followed another's suggestion.  Proofed the yeast with milk and honey; then added the remaining wet ingredients.  Mixed all the dry ingredients adding the salt to dry mixture.  Added dry to wet ingredients in my kitchenaid.  Placed in a greased/parchment lined bread pan to rise on stove for 40 minutes.  Baked 40 minutes at 350.  Cool completely; store in paperbag tucked in a ziploc.  Success!

I don't own a bread machine.  I do own a grain grinder which helped with the garbanzos.  I used 3 whole eggs instead of the egg plus white.    My oven has a bread rising setting.  I let it rise for about an hour.  Baked at 365 (Glass Pans) for 40  minutes.  Turned out great.  Tastes great.  Baking for a friend who has just discovered a gluten allergy.

This is the best GF recipe for bread I have found so far.  I did use 2 eggs in place of the egg whites and egg it calls for. I also used sugar in place of the honey.  I did make it several times with the honey and found no difference.  I am still searching for that perfect sandwich bread thats not so dense, but this makes wonderful toast or french toast. Recipe also works good for dinner rolls.

We love this bread. It's a little heavy. I actually decreased the xanthum gum used (I think it adds a bitter taste). Otherwise, great recipe.

I've tried this recipe in a bread machine three times, with varying unsatisfactory results. One time it rose unevenly, and twice it didn't even rise to the top of the pan. My husband says it's the best GF bread he's had, but I want it to rise like regular bread. Any ideas on what my problem could be? Could it be that I'm using bread machine yeast - should I use regular yeast that's proofed?

So good!  I mixed up an all-purpose GF flour mix a few days ago so I used that instead of what was named here.  I also accidentally doubled the oil.  Oops!  However, this is the best GF bread I've ever made!  It was the perfect consistency for sandwich bread!  So pleased!

This has been the closest match to "real" gluten bread yet! I double the brown rice flour and leave out the white rice flour, but otherwise, find this to be an excellent gluten free recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I used 1/2 cup of almond flour in place of the garbanzo bean flour and millet flour since I didn't have those.  I let it rise overnight and baked it in the oven.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

This recipe is great! Store brand mixes are expensive. Many homemade mixes I have tried have been too dense  or dry. This is just right and the recipe tastes as close to a regular loaf of homemade bread as I have eaten. My family will eat it too!

I tried this several weeks ago without a bread machine and it didn't rise and was pretty watery in dough form.  I tried again yesterday and added only 1c of milk and 2 packets of yeast (slightly over 1 TBSP) and it was perfect.  The flavor is great.  I baked at 350 in a loaf pan for 60m.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I were spending about $6.00 per loaf for gluten free bread at our local health food store. We just made our first loaf of this bread and after one bite my husband has declared we will never have to buy bread again. Thanks for a great tasting bread!

It worked really well for me! Made a few substitutions (used all white rice flour, replaced millet flour with more garbanzo bean flour, used brown sugar instead of honey, used almond milk, and used two eggs instead of the egg plus egg whites). Still turned out well, and it looked really good, too! The bread is soft yet strong enough to use as a sandwich bread, and was quite tasty. Not crumbly at all. I did not use a bread machine but just mixed with a hand mixer, allowed the dough to rise for one hour in the loaf pan, and baked at 350 F for 50 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

This was great!  I mixed in a paste of olive oil, chopped kalamata, the bright green olives, 8 cloves of garlic finely chopped and some sea salt and it was amazing!  Great dipped in olive oil and spices.  (I had substituted the white rice flour with King Arthur gluten-free all-purpose flour.  Delish!  Even my hub, who doesn't like olives was a big fan!

This recipe was Awesome!  I brought my Gluten free Friend a sample and she loved it and wanted the recipe! It was so moist and it made great toast. I did not have millet flour so I used sorghum flour instead. The first time I made this it did not turn out, and after reading on the internet I found out the eggs and egg whites should be room temperature. (which I did not do the first time) After all the good reviews I wanted to try it again and it made a huge difference. I did it in my bread machine on GF setting with medium crust. Also, I live in a high altitude area so I was afraid of it not working because of that. I am so glad I did not give up! I found a recipe I will stick with and will not look any further! Thanks so much!

This was the first time I tried making gluten-free bread.  I didn't have all the different types of flour so I used 1 cup of GF all-purpose and 2 cups of rice flour.  I checked after the first few minutes and had to add a little more flour.  Other than that it came out perfect.  My husband likes it and he's the one who has celiac disease.  Thanks for an easy, great recipe!

This is my first GF breadmaker recipe and it turned out soooo good. I can't wait to eat it with minestrone soup tonight!
I did make some changes to the recipe. Since I could not find GF millet flour, I doubled the tapioca flour. I also added about 1 tbsp of flaxseed meal for some BAM!
I did not have to alter it anymore than this.

I'm thrilled to be able to write a positive review on any gluten free bread, and this one deserves high praise. I've tried many recipes and none measure up to the delicious whole wheat bread I've been making for over 40 years. This had a nice texture, not at all crumbly or dry. It was a nice, regular bread! I had already spent a lot of money on various gluten free flours and had ground my own brown rice flour in my wheat mill, but I didn't have millet or garbanzo bean flour, so I used amaranth and sorghum. I have millet and garbanzo beans now so will grind them in my mill for the next time.

 I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed it with my hand mixer. It was the thickness of brownie batter. I lined my bread pan with parchment paper with enough on the sides to lift out the loaf. I turned the oven to 170 while it was mixing, then turned it off and set the bread pan in the oven for about 30 minutes. I let it rise level with the top of the pan. I then turned the oven to 350 and baked for 40 minutes. I turned the oven off, opened the door and let the bread cool down in the oven for about 10 minutes (hoping to avoid the bread collapsing).  I should mention that I had too much dough for my bread pan so made 3 muffins which got a little dry because I forgot to take them out early. 

 I'll probably still experiment with a few other recipes but only for the experiment--I'm perfectly happy with this bread and I think now I can handle going gluten free. Thank you, Alison!

This was great.  I did sub some of the ingredients, but no matter, the base was great and my finished product came out great.  This bread is good on it's own with a little butter, or as a sandwich.  

I don't have a bread maker - don't need one for GF bread, the consistency isn't the same as glutenous bread.

I mixed all the dry ingredients, then the wet in another bowl, and then slowly mixed them together.  Worked perfectly.  Let it rise, then bake in the oven at 350 for about 45 minutes.

What am I missing here?  I mixed the ingredients and let the machine mix for 5 to 6 minutes and it was absolutely SOUP!  The recipe says to check the consistency after 5 minutes but doesn't say what the consitency should be.  It was barely pancake batter consistency, no where near bread dough or even a quick bread batter.  I started dumping in GF flour until it was at about a quick bread thickness, must have added at least 1/2 cup.  I let it rise in the machine and it did rise pretty well.  At this point it may have come out well if I had baked it in the machine, but I always pull the dough out and bake it in the oven.  The dough would not pour from the can so I dug it out and had a gooey, sticky blob.  I arranged it on a baking stone and let it rise for about an hour.  It didn't rise much but I baked it at 325 for about 45 minutes and it did come out surprisingly well for the mess it was in the making.  Can anyone help me out with the consistency question?  How thick is the dough supposed to be?  Did anyone else end up with soup after 5 minutes?

Best gluten free bread so far. And it's starch free too. I've been looking for a starch free recipe for quite a while and finally stumbled upon this great one. The taste is great. I tweaked it a little, didn't have all the ingredients: instead of the eggs I added flaxmeal (3 tablespoons w/ 9 tablespoons of water), instead of canola oil olive oil, instead of tapioca flour quinoa flour, instead of white rice flour sorghum flour. I added 2 teaspoons of salt and I used the rapid cycle on my bread machine. Thank you Alison!

I thought this bread was going to be beautiful.  It looked high and light - but - on the bake cycle of my bread machine it completely collapsed.  The other gluten free recipe says to use the sweet bread cycle, but this one didn't say what cycle was used.  The taste was good but my whole middle was sunken

Fantastic GF bread!  This is the best one I've made so far.  I actually like it and see a lot of possibilities. 

I did not use the bread machine. I followed suggestions posted by other bakers: I proofed the yeast in warm milk and honey, etc.. I divided the dough into two loaf pans (oiled and corn flour), let sit covered for 30 minutes, and baked at 350 for aprox 50 minutes.   

I did make a few changes:

-Substituted sorghum flour for millet and used a combination of olive oil and peanut oil.
-Used two whole eggs and a tablespoon of ground flax. (instead of egg whites)
-I also added 1/4 cup of amaranth.

Next time I will add less honey and a bit more salt.  I will also try it with less xanthum gum.  I don't know if it really needs a tablespoon.  I will post the results when I try it.

review #1: i made this in the oven. i used a combo of gluten free flour mix i got in bulk from a natural foods store (to replace the brown rice, millet and tapioca flours) and used chickpea and white rice flours as indicated in the recipe. i used guar gum instead of xantham gum. i mixed the dry and wet separately, then added the proofed yeast to the wet and then mixed dry and wet together. i let it rise in the loaf pan for an hour. i baked at 350F at first but saw it was getting too brown so i switched to 325. baked for about 50 minutes in a greased, glass loaf pan (it stuck though!).

tasty, but the texture is kind of more like banana bread (i am new to homemade gluten free bread so maybe this is what GF bread is supposed to be like). the bread was too sweet and it browned on outside too much though, while the inside was fine.

review #2: i made it again and it was not good. used 2 cups gluten free flour mix and 1 cup white rice flour. i also ran out of eggs so used 1 egg + 1/3 cup of "flax eggs" (ground flax seeds blended with water - a common vegan egg replacement) for the egg whites. i also used half the agave syrup. baked at 325F for an hour (i had to put it back in for a bit extra because although the outside was too brown, the inside was still a bit too wet). found the bread tasted far too yeasty and unpleasant. maybe the extra sweetness before had hidden that, or maybe my yeast went overboard.. but i will not be making this again.

Great recipe! I used 1.5 cups white rice flour and 0.5 cups sorghum flours for the white/brown combo stated (it is what I had on hand).  It was great! Made it for y bro's GF gf and she/we loved it.

Delicious! We can't get enough of this bread. Even my non-gluten-free husband prefers it over his whole grain bread (about $5 at the grocery store). I found that the "sweet" bread setting on my bread machine works the best for this. Allison, do you have any pizza dough recipes?

This is a pretty dense bread but the flavour is amazing. It tastes just like wheat bread. I didn't have any millet flour or garbanzo bean flour so I used green pea flour which gave the bread a greenish colour. I also added 1/4 cup of flax seed for texture.

Ok, those of us who are living gluten free know that a good bread is so hard to find.  I really like this bread.  It has a wonderfully springy texture that for once doesn't crumble or taste like I am eating a piece of rice shaped like bread.  It does have a lot of ingredients, but it is worth the time to get them.  I used my breadman bread maker and it worked like a charm.  Go ahead, try it.

I use this recipe all the time.I recently added gluten substitute(from Orgran)to it and it gets wonderful results.I add 1/2 to 3/4 cup to the bread mix. I also mix it in my kitchen-aid mixer for 1 to 2 minutes,put in loaf pan,let rise till it reaches the top of pan,put in oven at 350* for 55 minutes(cover with foil after 30 minutes is up,so it don't get too dark). It continues to rise when you put in oven. Overall a great gluten free bread.

This bread is excellent. The best bread recipe I have tried so far. I changed a couple of things. I used 3 eggs total instead of the egg whites. And I was worried there would not be enough starch to hold it together so i substituted 1/2 cup potato starch for some of the brown rice flour.

I gave it 4 stars only because I did not follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have any bean flour so i substituted 1:1 for soy flour.I ran out of my super fine brown rice flour so I substituted 1:1 for sorghum flour. I also used whole milk instead of what it called for. I put it in the bread machine and used the "sweet" cycle since it didnt specify what cycle to use and I do not have a specific GF bread machine. It didnt mix it all the way but a spatula and my husband took care of that! It came out with a nice color, a little crust, and tasted pretty good. Its texture was better than store bought GF breads- it was moist, and held up when eaten alone. Although it could use a little more binder because it was a little crumbly once you made it into a sandwich. However this could have been due to my lack of not following the recipe exactly.

This is good tasting bread.  But I had a problem.  It didn't seem to rise properly.  I didn't have brown rice flour so I used all white rice flour.  Could this be the problem?

I joined Allrecipes just to express my thanks for this excellent recipe. I'm a semi-experienced wheat-free cook, since I've had a severe intolerance for 20 years -- but I'm a fairly unskilled baker. Since my son was also diagnosed with my condition, I've been experimenting more with baking as well as cooking. This recipe is EXCELLENT and easy to implement once you assemble the ingredients. I made it with the following modifications: 

- 3 eggs instead of 1 egg + whites
- 2% milk instead of skim
- olive oil instead of canola
- An additional 1/4 cup of garbanzo bean flour (Bob's Red Mill Garfava) in place of the millet flour
- All white rice flour instead of a mix of white and brown rice flours

The results, made in my Cuisinart CBK-100 on the gluten free bread setting (5) -- floored me. I was worried I'd get the brick that a few reviewers reported, which was my experience with most previous GF bread machine recipes I've tried. These worries were completely unfounded. It slices well, is not overly brittle. The crumb and density are similar to Pepperidge Farm White Farmhouse bread. 

Until someone finds a way to replicate in wheat-free form the New York Times's No Knead bread, adapted from Jim Lahey at the Sullivan Street Bakery, I'm sticking with this one. THANKS!

Healthy with more protein and fiber than other recipes, delicious, and the texture is reasonably moist and soft compared to many other gluten-free breads we have tried baking. I also like that it was pretty easy to dump into the bread machine. I used blue agave nectar in place of honey because it's easier to work with. I used 1/4 cup, and it was perfect. 
Dumped all wet ingredients in the bread machine, followed by the dry ingredients combined separately before adding to the machine. Easy and it came out wonderfully!

I am new to a gluten-free diet.  I tried this bread but found it too rubbery with a faint unpleasant aftertaste.  Other people who do gluten-free baking have told me that the aftertaste is to be expected.  But I wondered about the tablespoon of xanthan gum - if it was supposed to be a teaspoon?  No other reviewers remarked on it, so I guess it is just my personal taste that it seemed too much.

I would give this 5 stars if the instructions were a little more explicit about the consistency of the dough.  This was my first attempt at gluten-free bread,  after years of making gluten bread.  I expected a soft pliable dough, what I had was something that resembled a very think pancake batter.  I kept adding more flour,  but could never come to that consistency.  I finally gave up and put it into a bread pan, proofed it for an hour and baked at 375 until it was brown and sounded hollow.  I ended up with a heavy dense bread,  that was actually very tasty, and toasted well.  I would like to try this recipe again, but have no idea what consistency the dough should be.

My daughter-in-law loves this recipe!  We did it the regular way, not the bread machine.  We used soy milk in place of the skim milk (lactose intolerant), and 2 eggs, no egg whites.  She liked the many grains and says it is so much better than another recipe she was using.

A great recipe, tasty bread! Actually rises and has a texture similar to 'real' bread.  Mine always seems to deflate a bit on top, but still tastes great.

This really is a very good gf bread recipe.  I don't know if the magic is in the garbanzo bean flour or not.  I didn't have millet flour and so I used 1/4 cup of flax meal and only brown rice flour rather than both white and brown rice flour.  I also substituted homemade brown rice milk for the warm skim milk and olive oil for the canola oil.

I have baked this many times now and I am happy with this loaf. This works very well for toast and in a bread machine.

I use this as the ol' standby gluten free bread recipe. It is best hot, but perks up after being toasted.

I've made this bread several times by using some suggestions from reviewers. One time it was too crumbly and another time with too strong egg taste. But my main complaint was stomach difficulties from the xanthan gum. So after doing a little research I cut back on the xanthan gum and only used 3/4 teaspoon. My other substitutions were for dairy free, almond milk; all purpose gf flour for garbanzo flour; and almond flour for millet flour. This bread turned out very tasty and moist with hardly any stomach difficulty. I did not use a bread machine. I let it rise twice and baked it at 350 degrees for about 75 minutes

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I didn't follow it exactly. I figure I followed it closely enough to warrant the rating.  I did not make this as a totally gluten-free bread, because I'm just gluten-sensitive and can handle small amounts of gluten, so I made it as a low-gluten recipe. I substituted the millet and bean flour (can't find either of those in my area) with a half cup of wheat flour.  I used brown and white rice flour for the rest of it.  Also, I used buttermilk in place of skim milk.  That was probably a mistake, only because it left a slightly sour taste to it.  The texture is wonderful for a rice flour bread, and it rose beautifully. I did not use the bread machine, but my mixer. I mixed the wet ingredients together (proofing the yeast in the milk and honey), and then added the flours, and kneaded together (I did have to use slightly more rice flour while kneading). Then placed it into a greased loaf pan and stuck into a warmed oven. It rose about an hour, baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Seems like this is a flexible recipe that can yield good results with a variety of flours.  I haven't had wheat in months and feel great, but I have missed bread. This will do nicely. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

When mixing this bread recipe, I noticed the moisture content was very high.  I had to add lots of extra flour.   When I cut the recipe to 1/2 cup milk (NOT 1 1/2 cups milk), it came out beautifully!

WOW!  This recipe was unbelievable.  I can't believe I just ate a 1/2 loaf of this bread.  It has so much flavor and is perfectly fluffy.  By far one of my favorite bread recipes... no need for a bread machine.

This recipe is easy and actually tastes good for GF. Two important things in my kitchen! I did add flax seed to the mix. I didn't use the bread machine for the first try, let it rise in the oven at 150 degrees, then baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Will make again.

Wow. I never take time to rate recipes, but this one is worth it! After trying several gluten-free bread recipes that were too dense, crumbly, etc., this one finally achieved what I was looking for- light and fluffy. I did tweak the recipe, used a KitchenAid to mix for 4 minutes, let it rise 45+ min in the bowl, scraped it into greased loaf pan and let rise another hour- DID NOT kneed down after first rising. Here's my tweeks: used olive oil, added the yeast to the warm milk and let sit 15 minutes until bubbly, used 1/4 cup arrowroot + 1/4 cup tapioca starch. Baked at 350 for about 45 minutes. Oh, and brushed the top with egg whites and sprinkled sesame and poppy seeds on- looked fabulous!

We have been making this weekly for a while now.  We let it cool in the bread machine for 10 minutes.  After pulling it out and letting it cool completely, we slice it for sandwiches.  I make two batches of the flour blend at a time and put on in the freezer for a quicker assembly.  Thanks Allison!

I also made this bread without a bread machine and it was delicious. Directions from one reviewer were followed: dry and wet ingredients were mixed separately then the dry was folded into the wet. The one substitution was sorghum flour for the garbanzo bean flour, which I didn't have. The batter is more like that of a cake, not stiff like traditional bread - so don't worry. I sprayed the pan with non-stick oil. It was a warm evening and rose in 20 minutes. It was baked in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes. Let the bread rest for 15 minutes after baking before it was removed from pan.

Alison, I am singing your praises every few days when I make this recipe!  I just changed the skim milk to Rice milk to make it dairy-free and added 1tbsp of flour per cup of flour called so that my loaves rise better.

I've tried this recipe and it turned out great, except I put pumpkin and flaxseeds in the dough. About 1/3 cup each. I like a hardy bread and this reminds me of the bread I used to eat in germany. Also, next time i will try using canned chickpeas in the blender, rather than the chickpea flour. It seems the chickpea flour gives the bread a very 'green' flavor as if they weren't ripe yet.

I didn't have millet or garbanzo bean flour so I added some almond flour and a little of the others to make up for it. Besides that made exactly as shown in my bread machine. Turned out perfect!!!

Good and easy to make. I used almond, oat and gluten free all purpose flour. Second loaf I didn't let sit in the pan as per the recipe. It needed that time to finish baking, was a bit moist. Trying it for the third time today.

This turns out fantastic. I didn't have garbanzo bean flour so I replaced it with arrowroot powder. If it's too dense, try baking it on the "rapid bake" cycle. I played around with it and the first few times I had a very dense, short loaf on the regular cycle but since using the rapid bake cycle my loaf is light and tall.
