Absolutely fabulous..The only changes that I made was that I used 1/2 yellow onion (only because I didn't have green onions), and I mixed an entire can of blcak olives into the salad.  Deliciously simple. My brother said it was "clean" Potato salad.

This was really good, my sister raved about it and forced me to leave my leftover with her. Asked her what she thought and she said it was "clean" which is interesting that she mimicked another reader here. We liked the freshness of it, each ingredient carried it's own flavor. I added almost a full can of black olives. Will make again.

This potato salad is absolutely delish---a refreshing change of pace from more traditional recipes.

This is a very good potato salad, with a very different dressing.  I'm used to a dressing that has vinegar and sugar in the ingredients, so what I noticed most was it lacked a "tangy sweetness".  I'm not a big fan of radishes, but really liked the zing they add to this recipe.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Hmmm...just OK.  Very bland for me.  I left out the olives because I didn't have any and maybe that would have given me more flavor.  I think what I was missing though was mustard and cheese!  Good to try something new though.

I love this just as it is written, no need to alter. It's light and oh so yummy. I did mix the "sauce and seasonings" thoroughly in a separate bowl before adding them to the other ingredients. The second time around I added some fresh dill that I had on hand and it was even more tasty.  Fresh herbs are the one thing this recipe seems to lack. I too also added all the egg chopped. Will make this again and agian - Go Radishes!

Wonderful! Super-easy to make. I left out the radishes, peppers and olives because I'm not a fan and threw in a little apple cider vinegar to spice things up a bit, took it to a party, and it was all gone halfway through the meal.

FINALLY - I made a potato salad that didnâ€™t dry out! Next time I may add some bacon.

I like all these ingredients, so wanted to try the "simple" flavors.  I thought it was too "plain" - I prefer the tang of pickles & mustard, which I added the day after serving it plain. I had let it sit overnight after first making it, to be fair on the flavors, but it was just too mild. Much better with more flavors IMHO. Thanks for sharing, though.  I always enjoy trying new things! You never know what'll "knock your socks off"!

Good, simple recipe.   I think I'll add some dill next time.

Yes! It came out good on my first try. I used every ingredient besides the olives. I guessed on the amounts to use for ingredients. However, it still came out delicious.

I made just as written.  For some reason it became soupy after refrigerating...???  The flavor was good, just not the consistency.

Love, love, love this recipe!  It reminds me of the potato salad my mom made when I was a little girl.  The only change I made was to add more black olives.  Will definitely make again!
