This turned out pretty good. Very light and buttery. Something I would make again. Thank you for the recipe.

Beautiful texture and flavor! I think the volume of the cake would work better in a 9" cake pan rather than an 8" pan as shown in this recipe.

Awesome! I used a 6 oz strawberry yogurt and 1 TBLSP sour cream. I will be making this often :)

I made this yesterday!  Yum!  However I think I stirred it too much or I should have stirred in a little flour with the strawberries first as they sunk to the bottom of the cake.  My fault.  Anyway this cake is amazing!  My family mentioned that the cake texture is so soft.  Great cake with fresh strawberries!  Yum!

I'm not a fan of super sweet, and usually cut back on the sugar in any recipe. This I've made twice, just as written and it's perfect! The first time I served, I had some freshly whipped cream to accompany but discovered I actually like it best without. The sprinkling of sugar makes a nice crispy "crust" and the inside is moist and just a bit custard- like. I use a springform pan and find it ideal. We'll make this often - thank you!
