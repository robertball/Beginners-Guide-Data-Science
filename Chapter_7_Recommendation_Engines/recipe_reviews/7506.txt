A really great frosting.  I used half and half and it was excellent.  I had to keep adding half and half to make it spreadable, but since it was so delicious, I didn't mind.  :&)

I recently had a request from my boyfriend's step father to make him the kind of devil's food cake with caramel frosting his grandma used to make.  I had absolutely NO IDEA where to start.  I found a dfc recipe in Bon Appetit, and used this frosting.  I doubled the recipe for a double layer cake.  RAVE reviews.  Thanks so much!  
I made one modification, however.  It didn't taste "caramelly" enough to me initially - just sugary from all of the powdered sugar.  So I tripled the butter/brown sugar/milk portion of the recipe.  Turned out fabulous. 
True to everyone's word it stiffens up very quickly.  But nothing a few seconds in the micro didn't fix.

This is an excellent frosting recipe.  I like a frosting this is a little creamier, so I added appx. 3 tbsps. of marshmallow creme after all the ingredients were combined. To use the frosting on a bundt cake, I added a little more cream to make it of a consistency that it could be poured on the cake.

I can't say how this would be as a frosting for a layer or sheet cake, because I didn't use it that way. What I can say, however, is if you use about half the powdered sugar called for, and a little extra cream till desired consistency, this works beautifully as a glaze. I used it as a caramel glaze for apple muffins (1/2 recipe was just right for 12) and it was perfect--exactly what I was looking for! When hubs came home from work I had him taste a little dab of it for his opinion and he instantly knew it was caramel and thought it was very good! Smooth, not grainy, with a beautiful caramel color. I'll remember to use this again in just the same way for a great caramel icing for muffins or coffeecakes. It does, however, dry hard, so I'm not so sure I would like it as a cake frosting...

This was so easy to make! I used it as a filling in a layer cake. When mixing in the powdered sugar, I put it on the burner that was still hot when it seemed like it would stiffen up before I had the chance to incorporate all the powdered sugar. It is a hard frosting- not a creamy one. If you want creamy, try another recipe!

I have made this several time for my Great Aunt and she has given it her 2 thumbs up and even wanted to use my thumbs for a 4 thumbs up. 

Grant you I made the same mistake as other when I first made it (not reading the yield area). It plainly states " Original recipe yield: 1 - 8 or 9 inch layer" And that is what I got was one layer worth. With that said tho it was my fault and not the submitters. I now triple it for a 3 layer cake.

I did not have any of the other problem as stated by others. It was not runny not did it crack on me, but all that has to do with timing tho. You must vigorotsly boil this to have a good turn out. It does ser quickly therefor it is to be poured and not spread on.

Excellent! Very easy to make and it tastes sooooo good. I wanted to make a pourable frosting so I only added the first 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. I also had to add some extra milk because after it cooled a bit it turned into a big glob. I put it on a apple bundt cake, a perfect combination. Thanks for the recipe. I definately will be using this again on many different things.

I was never a huge fan of Carmel cake until I tried this recipe.  The cooling of the cake and the making of the frosting must be timed perfectly.  ***YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY QUICK SPREADING THIS ICING WHILE WHILE IT'S HOT.  ICING DRIES VERY FAST**

fabulous, fabulous!  This is an absolutely perfect recipe to frost a bundt cake.  It makes enough frosting to liberally glaze but without all the leftover.  Followed the recipe except used evaporated milk I had left over.  I also browned the butter first to give it a deeper caramel flavor and color.  There was no graininess.  yes it is sweet...it is frosting.  The flavor was very rich with a beautiful sheen.  Used this to frost 'Hummingbird Cake I' from this site.  I think it will compliment the bananas, nuts, and spice that are in the cake very nicely.  (and a big thanks to Ronaville for a great representation of what the frosting looks like)

Not enough liquid added 2 tablespoons more milk (I used evaporated milk) for added richness, found the texture to be grainy and not nearly enough to frost a cake, would have to triple this to have enough for a full size cake. Because of this am only rating 3 stars, I never change a recipe I make it like it says the first time to truly give a honest rating otherwise why not just submit your own recipe??

I made this icing to replace the icing in the recipe "Caramel Pound Cake" here on allrecipes. It was delicious.  I did triple the butter, milk and brown sugar as another reviewer did and it really brought out the caramel flavor.  If you want to add a little more confectioners sugar it's fine (I added a little), but you may want to taste test as you are adding a little at a time because if you start to add too much the confectioners sugar flavor will come out more and mask the caramel flavor.  Delicious!

Great frosting.  I used skim milk and it was still wonderful.  Drizzled over 'Apple Cake VII'.  I like the way it hardens very pretty on the cake.   I would make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I used this to frost cupcakes and it really good although it certainly isn't a light, fluffy frosting.  It's more of an icing.  It seemed a little grainy at first when it was done, but adding in a little milk and stirring it a little more helped that.  It is sweeter than many traditional cake-type frostings, but the flavor is very good and it's very easy to make.  This recipe was the perfect amount to frost 6 cupcakes, which was exactly what I needed.

Excellent recipe!  I did add 1/2 cup more brown sugar to make it a little more caramel-like...as someone previously suggested (I think she actually suggested an entire cup, but I only had 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and it turned out great) but I thought the consistency was excellent.  Have actually made this twice now...once to drizzle over a spice bundt cake (added a little more cream to thin it down) and once to frost a walnut apple cake.  Really easy, and really tasty.  Not sure how much adding the extra 1/2 cup brown sugar added, but I think without it, it would not have been as caramel tasting.  Very good recipe you can tweak to your liking.  Thank you for sharing.

Great flavor. I used on an 9 x 13 apple cake and it was perfect for that. But, I think it's more of an icing than frosting. It gets hard very quickly and it isn't really enough to spread on an 8-9 inch layer cake as the recipe states.

This was a super easy recipe to make. As previous posters have stated though it does get stiff after sitting and cooling. I used this on applesauce cupcakes and it turned out great. I used the frosting as a glaze though and I found that when frosting them if I kept the sauce pan on very low heat and kept stirring every few minutes it kept the frosting smooth enough to spread. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

This was so good, I used it to top brown sugar brownie, I was a little heavy on the butter and I subbed 2 tbsp sour cream and 1 tbsp french vanilla coffee creamer for the milk (I was out) and it became a beautiful spreading consistancy that did not harden as many have had trouble with.

This was simply superb. I browned the butter like a previous reviewer suggested. Added a bit less than 1 cup of the powdered sugar.  I poured it over some banana nut chiffon cake and sprinkled toasted pecans on top. Heavenly!

This was so delicious!  I used it as a glaze on the Apple Cake VII by Jill Hatch.  It was amazing poured over it!  I followed another's suggestions to triple the butter, milk, and brown sugar, and I am glad I did.  It was perfect to use over the cake and I had no problems with the glaze cracking.  Very yummy!

Easy, simple. This is a definite game changer for easy home made frosting. I used 1/4 cup of Almond Milk and it came out beautifully. Frosted a 10 x 15 pan of bars, no problem. An oops on my part also, I dumped the butter, brown sugar and almond milk in all at once, melted and then boiled for 1 1/2 minutes-perfect. Sometimes the oldies are the good ones. Thanks MaryKaye!

Followed the recipe exactly & it turned out excellent.  Didn't make enough to frost a 9 x 13 cake though.  Next time I'll make at least 1.5 times the recipe.  Used it to frost a banana cake, also from this site.

I used this to top the "Heaven & Hell" cake submitted by Magen Farrar.  I added a little more cream and found the finished texture amazing - smooth, yet with a bit of a crunch!  I'm going to try piping it next time, as spreading was a little troublesome. (LDP, England)

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to follow and turned out just like my granny used to make, taking up only half the time.  I'd recommend it to anyone. Best wjen poured over cake rather than spreading.  Using a plastic spreading spoon to smooth it on to the sides.

This was an excellent frosting!  My 5 yr old son requested chocolate cake with caramel and vanilla icing for his birthday cake!  I made Black Magic Cake from here along with this frosting and Vanilla-Chocolate Powdered Sugar Frosting and they made a great combo!  Just fyi, the amount of icing this makes 'barely' coated a 9x13 sheet cake and it does set up VERY quickly!  Everyone loved it :)

Oh man, I just made this and took a taste and it is absolutely delicious! I used dark brown sugar. The color is lovely.  Put it on a poppy seed 9x13 cake and I just know everyone is going to love it!!

To make it non-dairy/parve i used margerine in place of the butter and soy milk in place of the milk. Nice, smooth and satiny!

Beautiful consistency - firm, yet creamy. I poured it
on a rhubarb sour cream coffee cake, and the super-sweet frosting balanced nicely against the tart rhubarb. The amount was perfect to pour over a cake baked in a 10" tube pan.

As mentioned by other reviewers, this is an icing and not a frosting.  I thought it tasted good but was very sweet and a bit grainy.

Used this to top applesauce cupcakes and they were delicious.  I followed the directions exactly and thought that this was going to be more of a spreading frosting than a piping frosting.  But it set up great and was very easy to pipe on the cupcakes.

i used this on a chocolate bunt cake as a glaze.  it was sinful.  i took the advice of others and lessened the powdered sugar while doubling the other ingredients.  thanks!

Good taste, but the texture was a bit chalky. Is there a special technique to prevent this from happening? I had the same problem with my Texas sheet cake frosting.

Turned out great..used my electric mixer due to arthritis and it was nice and creamy.  Doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 cake as this is hubby's favorite frosting.  Does set up fast so make sure your cake is cooled somewhat before you even begin making this frosting.  The taste is wonderful!

This was really good and easy, but too sweet.  I usually cut down on sugar in recipes, but couldn't with this one because it was way too thin before I added more powdered sugar.  I poured this over Best Brownies and that combo is great!  (But rich!).  It does get hard really fast, so frost your cake (or whatever) very quickly.  My brownies were still slightly warm, which really helped.

Very yummy frosting!  Although I've learned you need to frost the cake before the frosting cools down too much - I had to make a second batch because it started to set lol!  (The double icing was awesome, though!!)

This recipe tasted just like caramel, and it got just hard enough on the outside when it cooled.  It was delicious, but even my high school students told me it was "too sweet".

Wow!!! I'm only 14, and I wanted to make my Mom a b-day cake and the frosting all by myself. I tried this recipe and not only was it good, but quick, it only took my about 10 minutes. This recipe is good espically on a yellow cake.

I used this recipe as my inspiration for the frosting I used on a sheet cake.  I used 1 stick butter and doubled everything else to cook the mixture.  I used dark brown sugar and added 1 Tbsp of dark corn syrup to add some smoothness and gloss while cooking the mixture.  I added a tsp of dark rum with the vanilla in doubling the flavoring.  I beat in the powdered sugar while the caramel was warm and it got a little too stiff so I beat in a couple more Tbsp's of softened butter and that smoothed it out nicely.  Spread it while it was still warm.  It firms up when cool, but it is still soft enough that it doesn't crack when cutting.

this is AMAZING!  i have made it a few times now and it goes good several different cakes.  i love that i can add more milk to make it pourable, and it thickens right back up.  DH LOVES it, says it really reminds him of a maple bar frosting.

Just made this for a fresh blackberry cake and the only bad thing was I loved the frosting more than the cake.  My cake was baked in a 13 x 9 inch pan and I should have made one and half times the recipe.  This is more like icing and delicious enough to eat by itself. THANKS

I love this. I have actually made it a few times. This last time it did turn out a little hard, but I think that is due to the fact that I accidentally added all of the powdered sugar at once instead of in increments. But it still tasted good. I love putting it between the layers of chocolate cake. MMMMM! Thanks for such an easy and delicious frosting. :)

Sweet! I was looking for a glaze\forsting for some cinnamon buns, and this is DELICIOUS. I made it in the microwave (just microwave on high for 1 min instead of boiling!!) and I used evaporated milk. It turned out really great, but I recommend sifting the sugar to avoid any lumps.

excellent icing! I used rice milk and margarine for a vegan version and this was very tasty and perfect. I drizzled it over the spice cake: moist-tender-spice-cake.   it was a big hit at my 11 year old's birthday party!!

followed the recipe exactly and used it as filling on a butter pecan cake.  It was DIVINE!!! The icing did get hard pretty quick, so I microwaved it a few seconds and it was spreadable.  It only made enough to fill one layer though.

Love this recipe.  Frosting is like eating a praline if you add pecans to it. My husband has requested a caramel cake for the past three weeks. I made a layer cake and had to triple the recipe to make enough.  As shown recipe is only enough to drizzle over a bundt cake.

This icing is awesome and so easy to make.  I put it on a chocolate cake and it was great.  I will next try it on a prune cake recipe.  My Grandmother always made me a prune cake with caramel icing for my birthday.  This tastes very much like what she made.  Thanks for the memories!!

I used this on a spice cake for my daughter's birthday, and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as written. After reading reviews stating that it sets quickly, I just dumped it on top of a 9x13 cake, still in the pan, and spread it around. I had no trouble working with it. I loved the firm, crisp surface texture after it sets. It is sweet, as others noted, but I didn't think it was overwhelming. This is definitely a keeper!

Very Good. a little too sweet and I had to triple the recipe to cover a two layer cake. I took the advice of another reviewer and added more milk, brown sugar, butter to make it more caramelly. it was my first time ever trying to make caramel and I was happy with this recipe. i got to keep my good name as a great baker. only problem I had was it was a little too sweet and the sugar doesn't dissovle all the way, it not smooth like caramel candies are.

I was a bit nervous about making this after reading the reviews about how quickly it set. Anyway it must have made me work superfast as I managed to ice the birthday cake for my friend before it set. Thanks she really enjoyed it caramel is her fave.

Easy enough to make but sets too quickly. After adding a touch more milk it was runny then turned into a blob. Very sweet but not the carmel taste I'm looking for. Probably won't use this one again. I'll stick with my own carmel frosting...a little more work but worth it.

I made this for my husband's birthday in hopes that it would be close to the caramel cake he loved as a child.  Let's just say that I earned enough brownie points to last for many years and I am about to make another cake because he loved it soooooo much.  I did triple everything and keep in mind it is more along the lines of an icing and not a frosting.  Thank you !!!!

Super easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe like most and I also added an extra cup of powdered sugar to make it thicker spreading consistency. I frosted a homeade chocolate cake..yumm yumm!

This frosting is delicious...but you have to work quick, otherwise, it hardens up and becomes impossible to spread nicely.  I used half and half in the recipe for extra yummy calories.  I used the recipe to ice cupcakes (made with the Black Magic cake recipe found on this site), which were a hit!

This was excellent!  It's pretty thick once it cools - I might use it as the cream filling in a sandwich cookie.

so easy and delicious!  I used this over "Green tomato cake" from this site. A huge hit. You don't even have to wait for the cake to completely cool before icing if it is in a sheet pan. The warm cake actually helped to spread the icing. This reminded me of the brown sugar fudge that my mom used to make when I was young.

I poured the hot mixture in my mixing bowl & beat at frosting setting.  Worked wonderfully.  Did have to add just a tiny bit of liquid after adding the final powdered sugar.

I would recommend sifting your powdered sugar to avoid little lumps. I doubled this recipe, cutting back to 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and while mixing in the powdered sugar I added a can of L LECHERA Dulce de Leche Milk. Which is condescend sweetened milk that has been caramelized. It really brought in the caramel flavor and made the frosting  more spreadable.

I actually used the wrong amount of brown sugar.  I used 1/3 cup instead of the 1/2 cup clearly listed in the recipe   Not intentionally.  But apparently a very forgiving recipe as it turned out great.  My only less than stellar comment is a note really.  If using this recipe for a layer cake (like what I mostly see here in the South) you need to double the recipe or just make it twice like I did.  Easy to make.  I also used evaporated milk.  I did have to add a splash of milk to the end product so it would pour instead of spread....but that was a personal preference...Great drips on the sides.

I tripled the recipe like previously stated. I used heavy whipping cream and real butter as well. I used about 3/4 of a cup of confectioners sugar to thicken. I put the frosting on 13 x 9 french vanilla cake - it was delicious! I don't know how the original recipe tastes but made this way, it had a rich, deep, Carmel flavor.  Will definitely make again!!

Yummy and simple.  Very sweet, but good caramel flavor.  Don't heat butter too much and throw in milk without stirring or it will separate.  Slow down and be ready with ingredients and whisk and it's fine.  It DOES get very thick, but MEASURE extra milk in slowly!

My family loved this frosting.  I made it for a 9 x 13 cake, the only
complaint I got was, "You should have doubled the frosting." Needless
to say, I will double the next time.

Wowzers!  What a good recipe! :-D  I'm vegan...so the milk and butter were substituted with Earth Balance margarine & full-fat coconut milk.  I also added ~1/8 tsp salt (5 turns on my salt grinder...) to the recipe, and I'm glad I did, as it's very sweet, and the salt helped to balance it.  I spooned it over a vegan vanilla-coconut bundt cake & it was truly amazing!!  I'm making three desserts for Christmas, and this will be one of them!  *thumbs up*

The proportion of powdered sugar is way off. Next time I make this I'll half it and compensate with more of the other ingredients, especially the butter (only 2T? should be at least double!).

It is a good starting point for that old fashioned made-by-grandma-style frosting, though. I bet it'd be awesome with some marshmallow creme!

It does set up pretty quickly, so make sure your cake is cooled before you start it, because it's pretty quick to make.

This was really easy to make and tastes wonderful. I had to double the recipe to make it a frosting, otherwise it is more of a glaze.

While this was effective for what I needed it for, I would never use this to frost a cake. Painfully sweet and lacking the richness of caramel. Very gritty. I had to thin it for how I was using it, and I don't think it would have ever been a suitable consistency for frosting. I doubt the quantity produced would be adequate to ice a cake.

I have used this recipe as an icing drizzled over my zucchini bread and seven up cakes. Never had any complaints. It is very sweet, that's y I use it over not to sweet cakes and breads. Think I'll try makin Maple Scones and drizzle it over them next time. Thanks

I used this recipe to frost a loaf of Caramel Apple bread.  It was super easy to make and just the right consistency for frosting.  Both the bread and frosting got rave reviews.  One friend said the Caramel frosting was "to die for"!!  I agree and have made it several times since to use for ice cream topping and caramel milk shakes...

Could eat this frosting all by itself as a candy it's so yummy! I only used half the amount of confectioner sugar and it frosted (easy spreadable consistancy) a 9 inch cake perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! We are a fan of caramel frostings. I used this on a bundt cake that had chocolate chips and butterscotch chips in it.  I drizzled a chocolate ganache over the top of it. I did have to add extra half & half to thin it. Delicious! pic uploaded

This really does taste great, even though it is a little hard to spread because it hardens up so quickly.  However, I covered the cake, and refrigerated it, and next day, the frosting was soft and easy to cut.  I`ll make this again.

Perfect. My grandfather wanted one of his Mother's Prune Cakes with caramel frosting, and my grandmother said I would never be able to get it right, but he said this was almost exactly the same as hers. Very good over a prune cake.

This tastes great! I iced the top of a layer cake with it. I had some trouble with it setting (warning: IT HARDENS VERY QUICKLY!), so it's not as pretty as it could have been, but the taste is wonderful. Very much a caramel frosting.

This recipe tastes great, but it was on the runny side for those, who wish to 'spread' it over cookies or the like.  I just drizzled mine over a cake in the dish/ pan and let it cool, so it didn't really matter to me that it was runny.  Still you'll love the tastes... tastes like a caramel ice cream sauce!

Delicious! I spooned it over chocolate cake while the icing was still warm, and it set up nicely. If you want a frosting that doesn't harden as much, just add more butter. It's the fat in butter than makes the difference.

This is a nice glaze and looks very smooth if used when warm.  I thought it was grainy tasting, the same texture from the brown sugar.  not sure how to help that?  I put on chocolate cupcakes.  Good flavor too.  Not outstanding but will definitely make again.  My husband didn't like it.

Very sweet, very hard to spread.  I even added some Marshmallow creme, as suggested by another user, and it was still difficult to work with.  I added it to white cupcakes and the combo was over the top with sweetness. I think I'll try to make this with more milk and less sugar next time.

This frosting is perfect and easy to make. I frosted 3 layers of a french vanilla cake mix, then I poured a melted chocolate chip and cream mixture over the top. I think I may have over did it because the cake was way too sweet. I will definately make this frosting again but next time I will frost a sponge cake and servr it with whip cream.

This frosting is great!! My grandma used to make blackberry jam cake with caramel icing, and this tastes just like it. About some comments from other viewers, this icing is not a soft spreadable kind like you might be looking for, but don't let that scare you away. It sets up fast and my grandma just poured it over the cake still in the pan. I'd imagine it would be very good on carrot cake (which I'm not a fan of) or any other cake that could stay in the pan, just make sure the cake and pan are completely cooled first.

The folks who said this is too sweet are apparently Northerners.  We Southerners know that Caramel Cake is like cake with a thin layer of fudge on top.  Yummy! Especially with vanilla ice cream or a big glass of cold milk.  I chose this recipe of all the caramel frosting recipies because it looked easy and I had all the ingredients.  It has a very good flavor but I agree that I couldn't get it to look good on a white bundt cake.  I tried the drizzle-by-spoon method and it just didn't work out. You can't spread caramel frosting; I knew that already.  I think I will do this in a sheet pan and just pour it over the top.  Maybe not pretty enough for Thanksgiving but great for the family.

This was perfect on banana cake with walnuts on top.  True to everyone's posts it firms up very quickly, so I poured it on the cooled cake after stirring for a few minutes to cool slightly.  Great!!

This recipe did not make enough to frost one 2 layer 8" cake. I had to make more to finish. It also sets up very, very quickly. Be prepared!

The other posts are right, it does set up quickly.  I wonder if it would set up so fast if it didn't boil so hard.

At any rate, it is so sweet we couldn't eat it, and set up so quickly I had to blob it over the cake.

This was YUMMY!!!  I did what someone else recommended and doubled the butter and brown sugar.  I made a chocolate cake and dripped this all over instead of trying to spread it, etc...  It didn't get too hard, but was PERFECT!!  Didn't look fantastic, but made it for the family and they scarfed it down!!  I poured it on while it was still hot so it made the cake moist and some of it soaked in...  SUPERB!!!

This was good on the banana cake I made.  I had to make it twice though, to cover up the whole cake.  Next time I'll just make a double batch.  Also, they're right about it hardening up if you don't work quickly.  Otherwise, it has a really good flavor.

This is an excellent "not-as-hard-as-my-grandma's" recipe. Without the double boiling and extra effort this was quite easy and VERY, very tasyty. Thanks MaryKaye!

What wonderful frosting! I just made this and it is so delicious (maybe just a tiny bit too sweet for me ~ but I love it anyway) I made some nutmeg bars that turned out more like a sheet cake and found this frosting for it and it's perfect! I doubled the recipe since my "cake" was in a 9 by 13 by 2 pan ... I was in a bit of a hurry and forgot to add the vanilla and it still is great, if you like caramel this is the frosting for you!

Pretty good for a caramel frosting!  I only took off a star because it's not very noob-friendly, meaning you have to know what you're doing to truly be successful with this frosting.  I added everything at the correct times and in the correct ratios, but still ended up with what looked like a failure--a very powdery mixture.  Had to add a little milk and it turned into a thick frosting.

This recipe has the consistency and flavor I was looking for. My only concern is that one batch is not enough. I have not attempted to double the recipe. I will definitely use this recipe again in the future and cook two or three batches at the same time if need be. Note: Once cooked, pour onto cake or brownies quickly. My batch was hardening as I was pouring it out of the pan.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 inch cake. Kept the cake in the pan and poured on top. I did use heavy cream and added one tablespoon of regular milk after adding the powdered sugar (which I sifted). Great taste and not grainy at all. You really do need to boil this for at least a minute.

Turned out great. Used as a glaze for a yellow bundt cake. Would need to double it for a two layer cake. Very good. Not too sweet. Family raves about it.

It needs an additional couple of tablespoons of milk for a more spreadable texture.. I used evaporated milk.. But it didn't get hard like a different recipe I tried.. It is delicious!

I made this last night and it's definitely a keeper, for me at least.  I wanted it to cover the top of a 9x13" cake.  I doubled the recipe and it made a nice think icing.  I was looking for something that was fast & easy to make & hardens pretty fast on the cake.  I used dark brown sugar, & glad I did. If you're looking for a light, soft, fluffy icing, this is not the one for you.  This is sweet, heavy, flavorful, and hardens on the top of the cake (so it won't stick to plastic wrap).  perfect for my intended use.  Next time & plan to put a little salt in it to make a salted caramel icing.  I think it could be thinned down more to make a great sauce.

I enjoyed the recipe. I made a few changes to increase the amount of frosting; substituting milk with whipping cream, double all ingredients except for the powder sugar. It was very good.

This was DELICIOUS. I doubled the recipe to ice a 9x13 pan of cinnamon rolls. Didn't have to add any additional milk at all.

I made this to frost some apple fritters.  It was good, but it does solidify rather quickly.  The recipe said to cool it slightly, but it was nearly solid after just a couple of minutes of cooling.  I had to warm it up again to make it spreadable.
If you like salted caramel, try adding a few grains of salt at the end.
Next time, I'll try a couple of suggestions from other reviews: browning the butter and adding more brown sugar to deepen the flavor.

Perfect amount of frosting for a 6x9 pan. It's just like the southern recipe my Granny use to make. You have to work fast to spread it though because it solidifies quickly. yummy good with a few pecans thrown on top, wow good eats!!

Recipe does not make enough frosting for 8x13 brownies. Was way too thick had to add 2 additional tablespoons of half and half to even make it spreadable. Only covered 1/2 of the pan with a very think layer had to make a second batch.

I tripled this recipe to pour over a 13 x 9 inch devil's food cake. It made a nice thick layer, delicious! And so easy, too. To keep it from setting up too quickly, I frosted the cake when it was still warm and let it cool on a rack.

I made just as written and I will make again.  It was the frosting on a box white cake mix, that I baked in a bundt pan.  It was the perfect amount.  It added a bit of sweetness to the cake.

I made this for a celebration toffee cake and as the recipe I substituted cream for the milk also as the recipe states I added more cream/milk to make it thinner, the person receiving this cake loved it. Thank you.

Good frosting - incredibly sweet so a little goes a long way.  It does set very quickly;  pouring over cake or dipping cookies into the frosting while hot is essential.

Delicious frosting and easy to make. It was however more similar to butterscotch frosting than caramel and  a bit too grainy.  Still a easy and quick recipe.

Grainy, maybe it's because I used the wrong sugar. But if I were to make it again I would change the recipe. I would put in 4-5 tablespoons of milk and leave it to boil for a bit longer for the sagar to break down. And I also boiled all the sugar to break it down.

Wonderful frosting!  I will be making this again and again.  I poured it over the Black Magic dark chocolate cake.  As written, it was a nice amount of frosting for my 9x13 cake.  However, it was so good, I think I will double the frosting recipe next time!  It was a nice blend of the creamy caramel with the rich dark chocolate flavor of the cake.

Really great recipe!    I made it according to the recipe, except I doubled it to make sure I had enough for two layers.  I also added approximately 2 tablespoons of milk to aid it in spreading easier.  I took it to work for an event and brought home an empty plate.  Definitely a keeper.  People loved it.  I actually used box cake mix, but because the icing was so good, they thought it was homemade.

This recipe was perfect! I made a healthy pumpkin "fudge" recipe tonight and it turned out awful! I thought...what this needs is some caramel...to heck with the health! I made it with half of the powdered sugar as some suggested so that I would have a runnier frosting. I also substituted Earth Balance butter and full fat coconut milk because of food allergies in our home. I also added just a *dash* of salt with the milk and butter. Such a forgiving recipe and so delicious. Perfect for licking a spoon and saving a recipe! Thank you!

Absolutely will make this again.  I doubled it for a 9x13 and it's just fine.  It reminds me a little of the fudge frosting you make for Texas Sheet Cake.  I poured mine on while it was still pretty warm and it spread like a dream.  I HAD to clean up the pan, and it was everything I had hoped - creamy, caramel-y with that fudge texture.  It's gonna be fabulous on my apple spice cake.

Really liked it, first time trying to make carmel frosting,  next time I think I'll try heavy cream, and maybe more of it. The way this recipie calls for it to be made it gets really thick really fast, so I think it might be more spreadable that way.

This was perfect for my needs. I followed the recipe exactly and used real butter. It made enough to frost 36 medium sized cookies. It did set up for me which was perfect for cookies to be able to stack them when cooled and set. The frosting started to set up in the pan while I was waiting for the second tray of cookies to come out of the oven but I just turned a burner in low and set the bowl on there and it heated just enough to spread again. The only reason I didn't wait and make the frosting after I was done baking was because I had my three year old helping me and I was trying to multitask. If I would have baked my cookies, let them cool, and mixed up my frosting while they were cooling I may not have had to reheat to spread. I'm not sure I would love this for a cake but for cookies and maybe a pumpkin bread, etc.... Perfect.

First, let me say this is very easy to make and is very sweet. It has a nice caramel color. Like other one star reviews, I found it too thick and it would not spread at all. Tore up the top and would not stick to the sides. There wasn't enough to frost a two layer 8" cake. I agree that it has strong confectioners' sugar taste, but not much of a caramel one. I am beginning to believe there is no "easy' way to make caramel icing.

Absolutely perfect!  
Not only did I try it with brown sugar (as written) but I also tried this using white!  Both frostings came out perfect!
If anyone wants a fast, easy, foolproof frosting recipe, this is the one! I'll be using it every week! Thank you, MaryKaye!

I used regular sugar instead of brown sugar and the recipe works like a charm. Delicious!

I doubled the recipe to cover a two-layer spice cake and it was wonderful! I found it to be runny and lumpy at first so I used an electric mixer to beat the lumps and graininess out of it once all the ingredients were added, then I let it cool off for about 15-20 minutes. I used a ladle to drizzle it (heavily) over both layers of the spice cake and allowed it to set up while we ate dinner. By the time we dug in to the cake, it was perfect. Everyone loved it!

I used this with the caramel spice cake. I added cinnamon and pumpkin pie spices and used half and half instead of milk. I topped it all with a mixture of cinnamon,  sugar,  and sea salt and it was a big hit.

I've made this twice as of tonight.  Once as written and once with maple extract.  Both are excellent!  Thank you so much.  I love the ease, simplicity, quick and it sets up nice and quick.  This is a great recipe for a bundt too.

I made this today to frost gingerbread cookies with walnut pieces on top. That was fine but I also learned that if you cook it too long, why that's how they make FUDGE! So now I have a recipe for walnut fudge as well!

Terrific and easy! I doubled it for 24 cupcakes. Just warm it back up if it gets too think to spread. I heated the butter and brown sugar together for a bit and then added the milk and it wasn't gritty at all. That way it cooked a little longer without boiling the milk any more than necessary.

Tastes ok, but not really what I was looking for, I wanted something smoother to frost my cake, was raised on Sanders Caramel Cake and it was my favorite, they want like 25.00 for a 9" square cake, so I want to make my own, this did not even cover the 13" rectangular cake and hardened way to fast, I will try it again though and make some changes

Good flavor but was an icing, not frosting, which was fine because I was planning to thin it to drizzle on a bundt cake anyway. No need, it was the perfect consistency as is. Used half & half in place of the milk.

I usually try a recipe based on the ratings that it has received. I was truly disappointed with this one.  I agree with a previous reviewer in their  statement of it being too chalky and hard to spread  This could be more on the line of a glaze if not allow to cool to long. Will not try this one again

This worked very well for immediately pouring onto an apple bundt cake (before it had somewhat hardened).  I used 2% milk, the amount specified, and it was fine.

This was great!  I used this to top the guest cakes at my daughter's first birthday party and it was a hit.  It is VERY rich though, so I think the amount used on the picture is a bit much.  One batch for me iced 2 9" round cakes with plenty left over.  Yum!!

This is a wonderful recipe. It was very easy to make. I used a little more milk, so it would be more of a glaze on my Applesauce Cake. Everyone has raved about it. Thanks for sharing!

Yuck, I've had some sweet frosting, but boy does this beat 'em! I've made other caramel frostings in the past and they never turned out this way. It's too crunchy even though I added more liquids, and the cupcakes I made wouldn't even hold on to it! Oh well, that's what I get for trying something new.

Really good.  I doubled the recipe and put it on the Fresh Apple Cake III on this site.  I used my hand held mixer and beat it while still in the pan I used to boil it.  I just poured it on top of the cake while the frosting was stilll quite hot.  I didn't let it cool long at all...pretty much boiled it, beat it and poured it.  It set up really pretty....and fast.  Tasted good.  The only person who didn't like it was my son, so gave it a 4 because not everyone loved it.  May use it again because I did like it and liked how it looked on the cake.  Thanks

WOW!
I made this the night before MiL's b-day/T-giving. I iced my German chocolate cake layers and top with it, and it was fantastic! The only changes I made were to toast and add chopped, fresh-picked pecans, and plain old coconut to the end result.
Even the pickiest eaters in my family ate it, including the littlest, who has texture issues. 
Thank you so much for such an elegant and impressive, QUICK dessert

My son was asking for "caramel frosting" for his birthday cake.  I had never heard of caramel frosting but as usual, Allrecipes came through!

This frosting came out fabulously well, my son's face lit right up when he tried it.  :)

Knowing that it sets fast, I had the cake all ready and it was certainly no problem at all.  I made the cinammon swirl coffee cake recipe from this site and drizzled the frosting on top of my bundt cake.

I had a bit of frosting leftover and put it in a small dish and ended up with a little piece of fudge!  it tastes exactly like fudge, with pecans added would be like butter pecan.

Will definitely be making this again.

The frosting is easy to make and tastes great.  My problem was that it stiffened up very quickly and I didn't get the smooth glaze look I wanted.  I should have added more milk but thought it would be okay.

Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a caramel frosting to spread over banana muffins. This is it. Really easy and pretty much foolproof. This will be my go-to caramel icing recipe from now on.

This recipe is wonderful. I added a little extra milk to thin it out a tad. I made the Southern Praline cake and drizzled it with this frosting. I receive compliments everytime I make it!

Sooooo sweet and hardened really fast and was very thick.  Maybe I am losing some of my sweet tooth in my old age.

Mmmmmm....very rich, but very delicious!  This is the kind of frosting that makes you enjoy a smaller slice of cake because of its richness.  I used half and half for the liquid and didn't measure it out...just stirred it in until it looked thick and creamy.  I also added a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness.  I iced my french vanilla banana muffins (will post recipe on this site shortly) with this frosting and it turned out to be the perfect combo!  Thanks for a great, basic caramel frosting recipe.

USING A CINNAMON SWIRL CAKE MIX, I MADE UP 24 CUPCAKES AND NEEDED A FROSTING THAT WOULD HARDEN ( GOOD FOR BOXING ,TRAVEL). THIS WAS PERFECT....FAST AND EASY...I DID HAVE TO ADD A LITTLE MORE MILK (I USED HALF AND HALF)FOR THE LAST FEW CUPCAKES , BUT THEY WERE READY WITHIN MINUTES TO BE BOXED UP. NEXT I AM GOING TO TRY THIS RECIPE WITH GRANULATED SUGAR IN PLACE OF THE BROWN AND USE A DIFFERENT EXTRACT (ORANGE , LEMON, PEPPERMINT,ETC.) AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS.

Yum!  I used this on the White Texas Sheet Cake recipe from this site.  I topped with some chopped walnuts.  The flavor of the walnuts goes really well with this frosting.  I want to try it on banana cake or muffins.  It's really good!

I used this recipe to frost a spice cake, and it was the perfect compliment!  The frosting was so easy, I don't know why people continue to buy store bought.  I did use half and half which made it really creamy and smooth!

I picked this recipie because I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  Got a bit ahead of myself and combined all ingredients at once, then noticed I was to put it over heat.  So I scooped off the powdered sugar and poured the rest of the ingredients into the sauce pan.  Heated. Added the sugar.  And wala!  I was saved.  I only let my 2 layer cake cool long enough to make this frosting. After reading all the "quickly pour reviews",  I began to pour and it was too runny.  So I poked holes in the bottom layer and let some of the frosting run through the cake.  I even poked holes in the top layer, so it would stop running off the sides.  Pouring in circles helped.  If I had cool whip I could serve it to others in stead of just me and the kids.  It tasted GREAT even thoughit didn't look so great!  I will let it cool next time so it pours slower.  ALSO I used 8th Continental Vanilla Soy milk instead of reg milk, keeping my vegetarian family members in mind!:)
