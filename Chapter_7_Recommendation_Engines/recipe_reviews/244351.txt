Excellent!
  I made the following changes for the fry bread, for 2 C of all purpose flower, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp baking powder to 1/2 cup of water and half cup of milk [the milk and water I microwaved to lukewarm]. This produces a wet dough that you will need to flour your hands, rolling pin and table in order to roll out. this will make about 4 fry breads approximately 8 inches across. Everybody loved them and everyone was satisfied with just one bread loaded up with browned hamburger spiced up with salt, pepper, dark chili powder, dried onion, garlic, and taco seasoning. We used Rotel onion and peppers, refried beans, cheese of course, hot sauce and sour cream to complete the meal. My grandson is learning how to cook and this was a meal that we made together for the family.

Great recipe! I've never cooked this before and it turned out great! The only thing though is, I would add in the instructions that when you are making the discs of dough to lay out wax paper and flour to make your patties/ discs on. And I doubled the the amounts for the dough just because I have a family of 5 and it turned out perfect

We enjoyed this, a nice change from regular tacos, the fry bread gave me a bit of a hassle, I imagine it gets easier to work with when you make it often. I doubled the recipe since I had a 1 kg package of ground beef, I used 2 cups of home made kidney beans and 2 cups of home made baked beans, I added 1/4 tsp salt since mine are salt free and used 4 tbsps of home made salt free taco seasoning. Thanks for sharing your recipe Elena!

Not impressed although I was real excited to try it. The bread was so sticky and very hard to fry. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad if you just put mixture in a flour tortilla or on a bed of Fritos.

I loved the filling and the toppings. But I'm not a big fan of fried bread and pretty much that what it was. If your a person who likes fried bread then you would enjoy this.

As someone who is used to eating authentic Indian tacos I have to say I was a little disappointed in how my fry bread dough turned out. I followed the instructions to a T but quickly realized that I needed to not use all the water and a little more flour. My fiancee is native American and was not shy in telling me that this is nothing like traditional fry bread other than that the whole family loved it and said it tasted good.

Moisture is way off. You basically end up with pancake batter if you follow as is

Well the fry bread tasted delicious but the batter was runny and were to thick after cooking them. I guess next time I will stir the liquid in slowly until I get the desired consistency. Hopefully they won't be as thick if I prepare them differently. Wanted a change from the traditional tortilla and well it was!
