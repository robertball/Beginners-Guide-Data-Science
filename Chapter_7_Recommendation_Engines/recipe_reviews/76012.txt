HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: My husband is extremely picky about his Mexican food due to where he grew up, so I tried each of the enchilada recipes that rank higher than this 1st.  He was sadly disappointed w/each as was I since I like to impress him w/my cooking, but then I tried this w/much hesitation due to how easy it was & what do you know ...simplicity was the winner!  1. put green or red enchilada sauce on the bottom (enough to ONLY lightly cover the bottom) but PAM works too 2. Change it up by/adding chopped green peppers or mushroom in the mix, and sliced olives ON TOP after adding heavy cream.  3. use 1 pkg of tysons/oscar meyer already made fajita or grilled chicken to save time (1 heaping cup) 4.make in the morning BUT add heavy cream JUST before baking it! I still add a little taco seasoning to the chicken for added spice BUT NOT necessary.  5 Bake until it looks golden all over with a little crispy look from the heavy cream so it's not soggy inside. I eye the amount of heavy cream for this reason too ...just drizzle enough for the amount I want & I use a smaller glass dish (making 6) since that's how many we will eat but makes (8-9 heaping amounts).  My husband likes soft enchiladas and not crispy like me, so we put foil over it while baking if he's eating.  Eat with "Best Spanish Rice!" So easy & with ingred. always on hand, not to mention better than complex recipes!  Again, simplicity proves to be the best!

LOVED this recipe!  Made it exactly per directions the first time, then experimented the 2nd, 3rd and 4th times!  I used canned chicken broth to cook the breasts in, plus added 1/2 envelope taco seasoning mix as the chk was boiling.  Also, I threw in some boneless, skinless chicken thighs to add some flavor.  I also sauteed 1/2 large onion and 1/2 green pepper chopped with the garlic/jalapeno (seeded)/chilies mix.  To the cheese mix, I used Jack/Colby/Cheddar cheeses; 3/4 c. salsa and 1/2 small can red enchilada sauce.  I also added the chk broth to the mix instead of water (and used almost 1 c.).  Finally, I poured the rest of the red enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas after I used the heavy cream.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!  Thank you, Whit for this fabulous base recipe!  I never would have thought to make these at home and now have a blast trying out new add-ins!

I made this for my in-laws with some of the suggested changes and everyone loved it!  I used chicken broth when  water was called for (even to boil the chicken), added a packet of taco seasoning and some onion to the jalepenos (canned) and chiles.  I shredded the chicken, dipped the tortillas in the leftover broth before filling them.  After filling them  and putting them in a sprayed dish I sprinkled the cheese on top(I used Pepper Jack), poured the cream over that and then a can of enchilada sauce.  I covered them for 30 minutes then uncovered them for 10 minutes.  Waiting 5 minutes to serve helps it set.  Thanks for posting this recipe and for all the recommended changes.  I will be making this again and again.

I had to improvise on this a little, but not enough to really change the recipe. Shredded rotisserie chicken made this super easy and, since I had no jalapeno peppers or green chiles, Pepper Jack cheese made a fine substitute.  I spread a thin layer of tomatillo sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before placing the enchiladas, and put a little in the enchiladas when filling them as well. Just before serving, I topped them with some chopped tomato and a dollop of sour cream. The final result was okay, but in my view needed more sauce (cream) than was called for and would have been very dull without the addition of the tomatillo sauce and sour cream. If I make these again, I'll know they'll be better with some embellishment.  As written, these are just so-so and a little boring.

I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars - it's really tasty and easy!  I used pepper jack cheese instead of plain montery jack and it was very good.  I bet you could add in anything from onions, mushrooms and black olives to give it even more zip.  I will make this again and again!

Although the basic recipe seemed workable, I approached it with some reservations because of other posted comments. A few changes seemed to help. I sauteed a small onion (finely diced) with the peppers and garlic. The filling was still a bit bland so I added a handful of fresh chopped cilantro, salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lime juice. I also substituted heavy cream for the water. I then added an extra step that takes a few minutes but, in my opinion, improves the texture. Pour some of the cream in a shallow dish. Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet. Quickly fry the tortillas, flipping over after a few seconds. Dip each fried tortilla into the cream - then proceed with filling and rolling. Then use the cream as stated in the recipe (I increased the amount to 1-1/2 cups to minimize the chance of this drying out). I covered the dish with foil and baked it for 15 minutes, then removed the foil for the remainder of the baking time. Pretty good overall, with the suggested changes.

This was a delicious recipe! The enchiladas are very creamy and cheesy, so they are fairly rich. As far as being spicy, they were mild-to-medium. We'd recommend adding more peppers if you like dishes more spicy. Definitely will make them again- perhaps next time with some low-fat or fat-free ingredients to lower the fat content.

This is our favorite base recipe for enchiladas! My kids absolutely love it! We experiment every time with different ingredients here and there. Pepper-jack cheese is definitely a favorite here. Sometimes when I've had a long day and don't feel like making enchiladas, I'll use this recipe and just layer it like a lasagna...it's excellent like that too! I cook extra boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and freeze them to make putting this dinner together faster.

While I personally don't like chicken enchiladas, I made this for an office luncheon and everyone loved them! I used corn tortillas instead of flour and added one package of Schilling/McCormick chicken taco seasoning to the cheese mixture. Every last bite was eaten!

Easy to prepare? Nah, not really, there are much easier enchilada recipes out there! From the time I turned the water on to boil the chicken to the time I put dinner on the table, an hour and a half had passed (no interruptions either). Very yummy, but lots of work.

I made a few changes just to bump up the flavor and not have chicken and cream cheese flavored enchiladas. I cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth that had sauteed onion, garlic and a bit of homemade taco seasoning. When it had finished cooking, I seperated the meat from the broth and saved the part of the broth for this recipe (and the rest for another future recipe). When I cooked the filling, I added 1/2 yellow onion, upped the garlic to eight cloves and tossed in one large chopped organic red pepper. I used reduced fat cream cheese and 1/2 cup of the broth I'd cooked the chicken in instead of plain water. I added in a dash of each spice to the filling: cumin, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, chopped cilantro. I got ten very well filled enchiladas. I used fat free half-n-half over the top and sprinkled fresh cilantro over the top. I haven't served it to my family yet but I snuck a taste (or two) from the pan while I was assembling the enchiladas and my goodness, that's GOOD. I highly suggest you try this with the added spices. I think that if I'd added a couple tablespoons of ketchup and some sauteed mushrooms (OMG, why did I NOT add mushrooms?), I'd darn near have Quick Pollo Con Crema. I'm for SURE making this again. EDITED: My husband thought these were a little too much and I have to agree with him. They lost something in the baking process. Next time, we'll do that and forgo the baking and the extra cream.

Made exactly per the recipe, and they were pretty yummy. They are very rich and cheesy, so a little goes a long way. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel they could have used a little spice. Next time I make them, I'll add cumin and chili powder to the cheese sauce, and I won't remove all of the seeds from the jalapeno peppers, as this dish would definitely benefit from a little heat. All in all, good dish!

Absolutely wonderful! We barely had enough to stuff our shells with, because we were eating the stuffing mixture with chips while it was cooking. Everyone I have prepared this for has asked for the recipe. To cut back on the preparation time, we bought a roasted chicken from the grocery store & shredded it. Have made many times & will continue to make!

I love this recipe, but have added my own twist.  I saute an onion and green pepper, and then add the chile pepper & jalapeno.  After assembling the enchiladas, I pour one can of diced tomatoes (with green chiles added) and then add the rest of the Monterey Jack cheese and cream.  It's delicious!

I was surprised by these.  The recipe all sounded great except the part about pouring heavy cream over all.  I thought that might make them soggy.  But this was really good.  Instead of the heavy cream I used fat-free evaporated milk, and it turned out great.  Even the kids loved this.  Thanks for the recipe.

I cut the amount of chicken in half and added a can of black beans in its place. I was worried about the filling being bland so I added half a packet of fiesta ranch dip mix. I also topped it off with black olives and chopped green onions. The cream over the top really made this recipe. It was lovely!

Oh My Goodness Good! First of all, make sure your pan is well-greased/sprayed! After reading all the reviews I decided to tweak the recipe this way: shredded the chicken, added one chopped onion to the garlic saute, left out the chilies (small kids) but put hot salsa on top of some before baking, only used 2/3 pkg light cream cheese, added about 1 Tbsp. taco seasoning powder to mixture, covered with foil for the frist half of baking, then removed it. Sounds like alot of changes, but they are minor ones. The ratio of chicken mixture to tortillas (8) was perfect for nice big enchiladas. Delish!

I make these enchiladas with the Texas Enchilada Sauce from this site (BF prefers red sauce).  I use corn tortillas, though - just my preference for enchiladas.  I also add a little cilantro in the mixture.  This is an awesome recipe!

This was excellent.  I didn't use monterey jack - I made a mixture of pepperjack and cheddar cheese.  The boyfriend couldn't get enough of this.  Also, I used BLSL chicken breasts, but I used the water method of cooking.  Never tried that before, but it was amazing.  :-)

I received the 'BEST I EVER HAD' reviews with this base recipe. I made a few adjustments. Cooked 5 breasts in chicken broth (not water). When I shredded those, I sauteed chopped onion and 1 C. frozen corn in 1 T. oil. Then added back the shredded chicken. Add 1 can of Rotel Mild chopped tomatos, dash of cayenne pepper, and 1/2 packet of Taco Seasoning. Let it simmer a bit, added the cream cheese and 1 C. mixed shredded cheese. And the rest is history. Topped it off with small can of Evaporated milk, then can of Enchilada sauce, cheese adn black olives. Oooh, so goooood!!!!!

Yum!  These were the best enchiladas I've ever made.  I read through a lot of the reviews and incorporated several suggestions from other readers:
*  I cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning mix to the broth.  Reserved the broth after removing the chicken.
*  To the saute I added 1/2 large onion, chopped, and 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped.
*  I put a few Tbl red enchilada sauce in the pan before adding the enchiladas.
*  Added 1/2 can red enchilada sauce and 3/4 cup salsa after the cheese began to melt, and used the broth instead of the water to that part.  
*  Dipped the tortillas in the remaining broth before rolling - made them easier to handle and added flavor.
*  Poured remaining 1/2 can red enchilada sauce on top of the heavy cream.  
*  Topped with sliced black olives.

There was enough for 11 fat enchiladas.  (Probably could have stretched it to 12 easily.)   They were wonderful!

We loved these! Spray your 9x13 with Pam and pour a little cream into the dish before you place the rolled enchiladas in the dish.  I cooked some covered with foil for the whole thirty mins. and some uncovered. These were softer but the others were just a little crunchy on top. I used colby/monterey jack cheese and added a little salsa to the cheese/chicken sauce.  I also used half and half to save a little on calories..ha..ha..

Made this the first time exactly as the recipe states and it was wonderful.  Second time, I shredded a rotisserie chicken, added half a can of enchilada sauce and added a little taco seasoning.  Just a little more wonderful.  Third time, added a little salsa to the cheese mix and added some enchildad sauce to the cream.  Fourth time, I went back to the original recipe.  Love these and will continue to make.  Always use chicken broth in place of water.

So good! I made the chicken filling as written, just changed up the sauce which I think turned out great.  To cut calories and add more flavor I strained the chicken broth I poached the chicken pieces in.  I added a can of cream of jalapeno soup ( yes-first for me too!) and a cup of low fat milk.  Reduced this for about 45 min and adjusted seasonings.  This became our enchilada sauce -delicious!

Excellent recipe but I prefer enchiladas made with corn tortillas, not flour. I made a few modifications and used a can of cream of chicken soup mixed in with the cream cheese.  Nice extra little kick.  I also used regular milk and omitted the heavy cream.

This was awesome!  I did make several changes, although I'm sure it would have been delicious as is.  First, I used boneless chicken breasts that I sauteed in oil, with a small onion, and added some taco seasoning for a little more flavor, and some garlic salt.  I chopped the chicken breast up with my salad choppers and set aside.  Then, when making the filling, I used milk instead of water(?) and used three cloves of garlic instead of one.  I also added around 3-4 tablespoons of roasted salsa verde to the filling...it was too thick for my taste, and I didn't have a jalepeno pepper, so I needed some more spice.  The rest I did according to the recipe, except that I also put some of the salsa verde on the bottom of the pan, as suggested, and I think it prevented it from sticking.  I was so surprised that the cream didn't make them soggy...instead they were flaky and crisp and wonderful.  My entire family LOVED them.  Thanks for the great recipe!!
UPDATE:  Just made these last night and instead of using the heavy cream at the end, I used fat free half and half and it was still really good!  I was afraid it wouldn't work, but it did.  YUM!!

We love it! and the best part was.. we could warm it up in our oven the next day and it taste as good as the first day..plus is a very flexive recipe, I prepared half of the stuff the day before while I was cooking another meal..so it was a time saver...

My husband said that these were the best chicken enchiladas he's ever had, and he lived in Mexico for several years!  I did make two changes.  I used corn tortillas and I soaked them in red enchilada sauce before I put the filling in them.  I also poured some of the red sauce on top with the heavy cream!  So yummy!

I have never made my own enchiladas before and these were really good!   live in South Africa and couldn't find a jar of chiles anywhere. I did find a can of "Mexican Tomatoes" though and dumped that in instead. It worked out great! That's the only change that I made though and they turned out so delicious. My husband looked at me and said "You can make these again!"  Big compliments from him. Thanks for the great and relatively easy recipe!

This was pretty amazing.  However it was really rich because of the cream chz.  I read the other postings, and added about a 3/4 to 1  cup of mild enchilada sauce in over the enchiladas with the cream.  I also added some cheddar chz on the top and a can of sliced olives (added quite a bit of flavor)... even diced tomatos would be nice on the top with the olives.

These were really delicious!  I made a few changes...boiled chicken in broth with lots of cumin and chili powder, I used evaporated milk instead of cream (did not make soggy at all) and I added olives to chicken mixture.  Lastly, topped with hot enchilada sauce.  Definitly a keeper!

I would suggest adding cumin and chili powder when sauteeing garlic and jalapenos - otherwise it's very bland.  I tried the recipe again with the spices, and it was really excellent.  I also addes some onion to the sautee and used enchilada sauce instead of the heavy cream -- I found that it was very heavy the first time.

Excellent recipe!  I made these for our fiesta themed rehearsal dinner and they were a hit!  I used flour tortillas the first time I made this, and corn tortillas the next time.  It is good either way, although the corn tortillas do tend to dry easily.  Great recipe to tweak to your own likes/dislikes.   

***UPDATE (6/16/08)***  I have been making these enchilada's 2-3 times a month for the past 2 years and I have to say this is my favorite recipe EVER!  These is the way I make it now:  I use chicken tenders and boil them for about 7-10 minutes in chicken broth with a bit of wine, garlic, and taco seasoning.  Then I shred while still warm (shreds easier)  This part may be time consuming but totally worth it!  I add diced onion to the jalapeno and chiles.  I use corn tortillas, they may break when rolling but no one will be able to tell once the cheese and cream are on top.  I use extra cheese and I also cook the enchilada's a bit longer to get a nice crispy layer on the cream.  My husband likes this with green enchilada sauce, while I like it with sour cream.  I also use this filling to make empanadas with crescent roll triangles.  Put the filling in the middle of one triangle, cover with another and then seal shut with the tines of a fork.  Yummy!

Great Recipe.  The modifications that I made are: I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and I seasoned them with MCCormick's Garlic Pepper blend and when I boiled the breasts I included a can of chicken broth, the rest was water.  This gave the chicken more flavor.  Once cooked I shredded the chicken.  It was a better texture for the stuffing than cubing the chicken.  In addition to the peppers and garlic I cut up two green onions and included them in the sauce pan.  I also added a little more cheese on top than the one cup it called for. I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 mins and then baked an additional 5 mins uncovered to brown it a bit on the top.  Husband said this was the best dish I have ever cooked!  Worth the effort.

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made to the recipe as written was to add frozen white corn and sliced black olives to the filling and covering dish for the first half of baking.  I would describe the finished dish as more like a chimichanga than an enchilada - (crispy on the outside but not fried like a chimichanga, a definite plus).  Will be making these again soon - thanks for sharing!

I'd rate them a 4.5 if I could.  I did saute some onion with the oil.  After tasting the meat mixture, I felt it was a little bland so I added some garlic salt and chili powder (will probably add even more next time).  I also poured some green chile enchilada sauce over the cream which I feel without, it wouldn't have tasted much like enhiladas.  And we prefer corn tortillas over the flour ones.  The end product was excellent!

My husband and I really liked these.  Followed the recipe exactly except for using jarred jalapenos instead of fresh.  I think next time I will add some diced potatoes and a little more garlic.  But this recipe could work with many different combinations.  I think I might try it with shredded pork.  But really good and flavorful just as it is.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made these countless times and everyone loves them. I season the chicken with taco seasoning and just cook them in a little olive oil in a frying pan. Topped with sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, these are out of this world delicious.

I made these scaling the recipe way down to just two servings.  I used four, 8” tortillas, as I thought the 10-inch tortillas would be awkward to get out of the pan.  Like others I used chicken broth in the sauce instead of water and added more to get the consistency I wanted.  I also added a heavy sprinkling of taco seasoning to my shredded chicken before adding it to the sauce.  I made mine ahead of time and refrigerated them, so I baked them at 350 degrees covered for about 20 minutes and uncovered for about another 20.  I popped them under the broiler at the end to give them just a little more color.  These were pretty good, and if I make them again, I’ll use even smaller tortillas.  Even my 8-inch tortillas were a bit difficult to manage on the spatula.

I thought this recipe was delicious, but it didn't taste especially enchilada-y to me even with the addition of enchilada sauce, more like a cream cheese and chicken wrap. However, I would definitely make it again. It reheats well and is great to bring to lunch.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I will say that I used white corn tortillas because my husband has issues with refined flour but other than that I made it exactly as listed. Very delicious! I got rave reviews and came home from the potluck with an empty dish. Next time, I am going to try using canned white chicken to save on time.

These are great. I made a few changes such as boiling my chicken in Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles and a little water for extra flavor, and I prefer corn tortillas which i fry lightly before filling. Everyone loves them.

Wow! I think these enchiladas are perfect. What else can I say? The heavy cream picks up flavors from the cheeses and garlic to make a sauce that is surprisingly delicious. Please try this one.

Oh mu gosh I loved these. I thought they may not be good since it called for cream and no real enchilada sauce but they were perfect and they tasted great the next day too. I made this recipe how it was listed except I used jared jalapenos.  I will be making this again.

Awesome!!!  They are so good, I used whole wheat low-carb tortillas and it didn't take away from the dish!  I was worried but they were still delicious!  I will probably add more jalapeno next time, or more chilis just because my husband and I like spicy food.

YUMMY!!!!  I used chicken broth when water was called for (even to boil the chicken), added half packet of taco seasoning and some onion to the chiles and left out jalapenos . I shredded the chicken, dipped the tortillas in the leftover broth before filling them. After filling them and putting them in a sprayed dish I sprinkled the cheese on top, poured the cream over that.

This was much too heavy on cheese in general, but especially the cream cheese. The cream cheese overwhelmed the flavor of the whole dish. I added some of our favorite salsa to the filling, which was much needed for flavor.

My family loved these! I only had two chicken breasts, so I threw in some shredded pork I had on hand. I sauteed an onion and some red, orange and yellow pepper before adding the chiles. I omitted the jalepeno. Used cheddar, since that's what I had on hand. I also added a packet of chicken taco seasoning. Needed a little salt. Adding this to our favorites! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good, will make again but will probably add either some rotel or another can of green chiles to season it up a bit more.  They were just a bit too "creamy" for me and not quite flavorful enough.

I made this just like the recipe said and it was wonderful. The best chicken enchiladas I have ever had.  It is very easy to make, make ahead..just pour the cream on when you are ready to bake. Just the BEST.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It is quick and easy, and tastes delicious.  I eat it with a dab of sour cream and a little hot sauce.  But it's very good without it too!  I definitely recommend it.

My family loves these enchiladas. However, I usually use the "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce" recipe instead of the cream.

This is the easiest and BEST recipe!!  There are 2 things I do differently - I use a rotisserie chicken in place of the chicken breasts and I substitute chicken broth for the water.  They are so very good!!!  You HAVE to use heavy cream and the flour tortillas make them so yummy!! My friends are always impressed.

What a wonderful change from the traditional red sauce enchiladas. The monterey jack cheese is wonderful in this recipe and makes such a pretty dish to serve. I made these for a Christmas get together with my sisters and we all loved it. Lots of wonderful flavors and easy to prepare. Some changes that I made to the recipe is to shred the chicken instead of cubing it, and adding additional cheese to the inside of the enchiladas as well. Tip: Prepare your chicken ahead of time and refrigerate to lessen the preparation time before baking. This is a must try recipe for those who love chicken enchiladas.

Stop what you are doing and make this recipe!! By far the best enchiladas that I have ever eaten- better than any restaurant! I added onion in with the jalapeno and garlic and I also added a little enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan. Serve with sour cream and salsa and get ready to fall in love!!

This was not my cup of tea. I followed the recipe as written - and in the end thought it was just OK. Kind of boring. Not super tasty. Really...white. No color. I have tried several other chicken enchilada recipes from this site that my family and I like much better.

Family went nuts over these. Next time I would add some more green chiles or peppers to kick it up just a touch.  I had a can of campbells southwest style pepper jack soup i wanted to use up so used that in place of the water and then used remainder of can on top. These were to die for, rich and creamy but I would like the spice kicked up a notch. Served with lettuce, olives, tomatoes, guacamole on top. Did I say they fought over these?

These were awesome! I took the advice of others and cooked the chicken in chicken broth instead of water, added onion, used 1/2 cheddar 1/2 pepperjack, and added some red enchilada sauce. YUM! These are the best enchiladas.

Love this recipe! One of my husband's favorites. I also add some taco seasoning to the cream cheese, chicken mix and add enchilada sauce over the enchiladas in addition to the cream/milk. Yummy!

This was so wonderful.  I've been looking for a good chicken enchilada recipe without all the soups.  A went with a few of the changes suggested:  sauteed onion with the garlic and added 1/2 package of chicken taco seasoning to the saute too.  Substitued chicken stock for water, as mentioned by others and low fat cream cheese was still yummy.  Quickie hint:  use a grocery store rotissere chicken instead of cooking your own.  Very tasty and easy.

These were absolutely wonderful. I did make some minor changes. I added a can of cream of chicken soup to the heavy cream and then poured over tortillas. I also cooked my chicken the day before and didn't preserve the water so I added 1 cup of chicken stock and it turned out very nice. I got great reviews!

I am not the best cook and this is so easy! And everyone loves it and wants the recipe!!! Thanks to my Aunt Charleen for sharing this with me. :) Note: I added onions to the mix and it was nice. And one time I couldn't find the right cheese, so I used Pepper Jack and it gave it a little extra kick. And I like to add sliced jalepenos @ the end as a pretty garnish. And these freeze very well. If you want to make more than 8, use the smaller tortillas. Enjoy!

I changed it to use low fat or no fat ingredients. Also instead of the cream I use condensed milk. Works perfectly!

We just finished dinner and these were so delicious....everyone loved them! I chose boneless breasts and poached them in broth seasoned with chili powder and cumin. As others have suggested I used the broth instead of water to mix with the chicken and cheese.  I omitted the cream altogether and instead used green enchilada sauce (health concerns) and it was still outstanding! Yummy!

These enchiladas were wonderful.  Very cheesy.  The only change I made was that I used the broth from cooking the chicken instead of water to add a bit more flavor and to avoid throwing out good broth.

Excellant recipe, but I used boneless chicken breast and cooked it in chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor.  I also thought 1 cup of heavy cream would be to much to pour over top of it, but it wasn't. I served it with sour cream and salsa on the side. My family loved this recipe. I definetly make this over and over again!!

Awesome.  Never will we eat chicken enchiladas at a restaurant again.  Why bother when you can make this easy and EXCELLENT recipe at home?  Only changes:  Used broth from chicken instead of water, and added a garnish of medium salsa to each serving.

Loved this dish!  The only change I made was to bake my chicken and then used 1/2 cup chicken broth from the cooked chicken in place of the water and I increased the amount of green chile's to around 6 oz's.  This will be a regular item at my house.

I made the recipe last night and it was very good. I used boneless chicken breasts and cooked them with a little olive oil (rather than boiling). I used 1 can of enchilada sauce instead of using the heavy cream.  My husband and 10 yr old daughter loved them, but our 4 yr old found them too spicey.  I will make these again.

I added about 1/4 cup (give or take) chopped onion to Step #3. I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar, 1/2 cup pepper jack and 1/2 cup mild cheddar. Also, I must have been blind because I couldn't see where the heavy cream was added (found it now though), so mixed it with the water. There was enough of the mixture left to spread on the top of rolls. Then I added the rest of the cheeses. My Husband has requested we add these to our weekly menu. Thanks for sharing this recipe :o)

Delicious!  I would recommend adding some white onion (about a 1/2 cup) to the chili and garlic mixture and leaving the juice from the chili peppers in basically takes the place of the water.  I didn't add any water to my mixture.  Also, I used only 3 large chicken breasts and still had some cooked chicken left over for sandwiches the next day.  Still had enough mixture to make 8 enchiladas.  I also used a little less cream and mixed it with a small pouch of store bought green enchilada sauce.  We like a little more spice so we substituted jalapeno cream cheese in place of plain and a hot pepper blend cheese instead of monterey jack.  Turned out great!  This is one of our new favorites!

We love this recipe! I use the "cilantro lime chicken" recipe which is made in the crock pot. I make double or triple batches for Mexican recipes like these and freeze in one pound packages. I use two of the packages for this recipe. I leave everything else alone. It's fantastic, plus, the crock does most of the work!

Wow this was my first time making enchiladas and these babies came out perfect! I am gluten intolerant so I did half with regular flour tortillas and the other half with Rudi's Gluten Free Tortillas (in the frozen section) and they were fantastic.  I also just used 2 cans of pre-cooked chicken instead of making it from raw breasts and topped ours with some canned enchilada sauce from the Latin aisle.  Great recipe!  I highly recommend it!

Absolutely delicious! I have a hard time finding plain Monterey Jack cheese in the store. If you must substitute with a "Mexican Style" mix, use one with as little yellow/orange cheese as possible. Some may find this dish to be too rich. In that case, substitute half the cream for red enchilada sauce, most grocery stores carry a few canned varieties.

Must use cilantro while cooking the chicken. Also my hubby and probably added a few more ingredients(cilantro, cumin, jalapeno, onion, cayenne,etc.) but I would say the prep time was way off. It took much longer than I expected and to shred the chicken and make the sauce, roll up the enchiladas, and bake. About and hour and a half time start to finish, with 2 people.

Easy and excellent.  My first time cooking I used the recipe and the helpful tips mentioned by Chef Joy it came out perfect!  I am an amateur cook and I was surprised at how great and easy this recipe was for me!

I used the whole package of taco seasoning when boiling the chicken and used 1/2 cup of stock from that into the making of the chicken mixture! Man was it tasty!

great recipe! I did however use the reserved chicken broth inplace of the water,this gives more flavor.For a bigger kick i added one more jalapeno. Instead of heavy cream I used one more package of fat free cream cheese. Melted with more cheese and chicken broth until it was medium in consistancy... Yummy recipe!

Terrific!  I was unsure about pouring the heavy cream all over it, but it turned out so delicious!  As others have said, this is a great base recipe and you can add veggies and spices as you see fit.  Our addition of sauteed onions and a few spoonfuls of diced tomatoes to the chicken mixture was a hit.  My kids don't care for anything too spicy, so we used the remaining diced tomatoes on top vs. salsa .  Also used another recommendation and used chicken stock vs. water.  A keeper!

I improvised - didn't have diced green chile peppers so I added regular red+orange peppers, added chorizo sausage meat with the chicken and on top added pepper jack cheese to the monterey jack. Rave Reviews; will make it again and again! Thanks!

This recipe is so so. The cream cheese leaves an after taste I don't care for. It's also a bit bland so be sure to salt to taste before filling the tortillas and consider more jalapeno. I rescued them by smothering in a very tasty salsa and quacamole so I wouldn't have to throw them out.

The first couple of bites tasted good but the more my husband and I ate the less tasty the enchiladas became. I did use half and half instead of heavy cream, but I think it was all the cream cheese that made it taste bad.

Made this for supper tonight. I used thighs instead of breast, added in finely chopped red bell pepper with the jalepeno, and served the enchiladas topped with small diced tomato and chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of sea salt. LOVELY!!! 
However I WILL make changes. At the very least I will add roasted and chopped poblano to the cream, or maybe a finely diced chipotle. The cream needs some heat. Regardless, I'll make these again. They are wonderful.

We liked this.  We would add some chili powder and cumin to the chicken mixture, though.  We did add green olives to the chick mixture, super yum.  They're a good topping also.  (sliced) I recommend corn cake with this, great side!

Ok Ok, I changed two things because of what I had on hand.  Instead of the cream cheese, I used sour cream all the way and instead f the heavy cream, I used milk.  Can't say I'm sorry the extra calories are not entering my mouth.  The recipe is bland and I even added spinach to it.  I'm having to salt each bite as I type.

I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and have concluded that I must have put too much enchilada sauce on the bottom, because mine turned out nice and crispy on top but a little soggy on the bottom. The filling, however, was DELICIOUS. I used six chicken breasts (I was entertaining) and added taco seasoning while boiling them. I also added red and green bell peppers and onions to the filling. It was a hit, will definitely make again.

WONDERFUL! Even my "taco/mexican" hating daughter loved this one. I just cut up some boneless chicken breast, I did not use bone in, so much easier that way. For our family tastes, I did a little less of the jalapeño, I still used it, just not so much of it. Awesome recipe

I did a number of changes to this recipe- used rotisserie chicken, shredded- 5 cloves of garlic, used queso campesino as well as Mexican blend cheese, used chicken broth to moisten the mix, added cumin, chili powder, cayenne and black pepper. Used a can of enchilada sauce that I reduced first since it was so watery. Used corn tortillas. It was awesome!!

I changed a few things but overall it tasted great.  I don't like spicy so I left out the chile peppers and jalapeno. Instead I used Philly's cooking cream cheese Sante Fe flavor for the cream cheese.  I also chopped up half an onion and used more garlic.  I love cheese so I added more cheese to the chicken mixture than called for.  I think when I make it again I'm going to leave out the heavy cream (didn't enjoy it).  Overall great.  I will definitely be making this again.

I have been looking for a recipe similar to this FOREVER!!!!  I'm so glad to have found it!  I cannot make a recipe without adding my own twist and we like really spicy food so if you're interested here is what I did:  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and cooked in a skillet over medium heat so they would brown and have more flavor.  I then cooked 1 c. chopped onion and 1 cup chopped mushrooms until browned and softened, then added 3 cloves garlic and cooked 2 min more.  Then I cut the chicken into tiny pieces, stirred together with veg mix then followed step 3.  I also added jalapenos, chili powder, cayenne, cumin and oregano, then cream cheese and monterey jack, and water.  Then follow step 4 and on top of rolled tortillas I put sliced black olives and jalapenos, then cheese and cream.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and monterey jack and I also used reduced fat half-and-half instead of heavy cream.  The result was unbelievable!  So delicious!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, even if I can never make a recipe as-is!

I have made this many, many times and my family loves it.  I have also made some of the suggested changes - I add 1/2 onion, cilantro, and cumin when sauteing.  I also use my pampered chef chopper and chop my chicken.  It comes out wonderful!  I also use corn tortillas, as I find that flour tortillas get gummy.  Great recipe.

I really like this recipe.  It's very tasty and easy to make (does take some time though).
I leave out the canned chili's.  Why not use fresh peppers?  I add extra Jalepeno's or Habenero's to spice it up more.  You can also add in some diced onion and garlic.  
When finished I like to add some good hot sauce on top and maybe some lettuce, fresh tomato, sour cream.  Good dish with room to add your own variation of toppings.

Fabulous recipe, easy and the filling comes together so well - I was worried about the cream cheese, cheese and water mixture being a big sloppy mess but it was great!  I did use enchilada sauce in the pan for dipping the tortillas in and over the top followed by cheese and heavy cream.  Whew!  Big hit!  Filling and made enough for an army!

Works well with a rotisserie chicken!  Great timesaver.

Fantastic recipe!  I love that it is so easy and pleased the whole family, 1 1/2 year old included.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I made the recipe two ways, one with cumin spice and chili seasoning, and the other without.  If you like a little zip, add the spices.  Either way is yummy!

We totally loved this! I had never used the cream over the top method before, and it just made it so crispy and flavorful!! I used more green chiles, but other than that, it was perfect for me (mexican food junkie) and my kids (picky)!!

By far the best enchiladas of my life.. I know it sounds crazy but I'm dreaming of when I get to make them again.    We changed it up a little using drum sticks instead of breast (it's all we had on hand).  We also used both corn and flour tortillas... it was amazing either way.  I will be turning our Thanksgiving leftovers into these amazing enchilada too!

Best enchiladas EVER!  My husband loves enchiladas, but I never like the red sauces.  This cream sauce is amazing and the entire family loved them.  Even though it has jalapeno and green chile peppers, its not too spicy.  My kids (ages 7 and 9) said it was their new favorite dinner.  The only changes I made were roasting the chicken instead of boiling and adding a bit of onion when I sauted the jalapeno.  YUMMY!

Wonderful and easy. Followed the recipe exactly. Used a store-bought rotisserie chicken for short cut. I did not put the jalapeno peppers in because of children. Very mild - good for families with children.

Very good! I made w/out the jalapeno so maybe that's why I felt it was a little bland. I added salt which helped, then added some Tabasco to try to spice it up. But in the end, I thought it was very good! Thanks for the cheesy recipe!!! Love the cream cheese; it tasted great with the Mont. Jack!!

This is the only enchilada recipe I've tried to-date and it is STELLAR!!!  Super cheezy and the only change I do is to shred a rotisserie chicken to shave cooking time.  Winner winner chicken dinner!  I do know that I've tried it in 2 different casserole dishes - and have disappointing/dry results with a dark nonstick pan... so make it with clear Pyrex and you're good!!!  Endless topping combinations make this a versatile recipe to keep on hand // Thanks, Whit!

I have made these many many times and they are always DELICIOUS.  The recipe is wonderful as is, but sometimes I add a can of RoTel, drained, to the filling when I have them on hand. I just like the little extra zip.  Other good additions are mushrooms, red and green peppers, corn,and onions. I sometimes add a little red or green enchilada sauce to the bottom of the pan and then mix the rest into the filling.
 I also vary the cheese sometimes -  I might use a mexican blend, or queso fresco. I use neufchatel cheese and only enough cream to cover the enchiladas to cut the fat just a smidge. 

Always awesome! Thanks!

I only gave these 4 stars due to the fact I changed so much.  I used corn tortillas, didn't have cream cheese so I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a spoonful of sour cream.  I used garlic powder.  I think they are made great because of the heavy cream that is poured on top; that makes any enchilada type dish extraordinary.

My family and I LOVE these! So easy and very tasty! The only substitution I make is to add a little enchilada sauce on the top before I throw it in the oven for a little extra flavor. Kids beg for these at least once a week. Good stuff!

These are the ultimate chicken enchiladas.  To save a little time I throw my chicken in the crock pot in the morning with a little taco seasoning and when I get home I can just throw it all together and pop it in the oven.  We add green enchilada sauce to the mixture and a little on top with the cream. So good.

I would refer to these as chimichangas or flautas NOT enchiladas.  Whatever you want to call them, they are awfully rich and just okay in my book.- Would not make again.

I was excited to make these and I used leftover chicken breast from a whole chicken I made the day before.  After I made the filling and tasted it I thought it was really bland so I added about a half a cup of sour cream and a quarter cup of hot sauce that gave the filling a little zip.  Next time I will use more cream on top, it wasn't enough for me.  I gave this three stars because that is all it would have been if I didn't add the sour cream and hot sauce.  I like to make recipes as stated and not have to rework anything but I am glad I tasted the filling before rolling the enchiladas we would not have liked them as written.  The way I did it they tasted like buffalo chicken enchilada...yummy

These are by far the best enchiladas ANYWHERE! I always give people this recipe. It does need some type of sauce if you ask me and I don't pour the cream over the pan but I do use a red enchilada sauce and I use corn instead of the flour tortillas.

Edited review~ So I have been using this recipe for  years and I am still getting RAVE reviews. I make it for 50 hungry accountants during tax season and they can't wait for Whit's enchilada night! I use the Red enchilada sauce in the bottom lightly and a little more on top, chicken broth instead of water.  Delish! Enjoy

These were a huge hit with my family of 20+...Added 1/4 c. white onion & 1/2 packet of taco seasoning per other's suggestions.  I also made one pan of flour tortillas & one with corn tortillas to find out which I liked better - Both were awesome!!   I also used the white meat from a rotisserie chicken - very easy & light cream cheese!!! YUMMY!!

"Better than a Mexican restaurant" my aunt said. "Best enchiladas I've had, ever!" my husband said. Perfection, we loved them!  Definitely not the healthiest though, but oh well!

These were very good.  Do add some flavorings to the chicken and we like some green salsa or green tabasco mixed in with the white sauce for a bit more tang.

These are my son's favorite! He would eat them every night if I let him. The only changes I make are adding about 1/4 cup of chopped onion to the garilc, jalapeno and green chilies, and heaping with and a full, shredded 8 oz. block of cheese before baking.

Filling was pretty good, but enchiladas rather bland overall.  I didn't like the heavy cream over the top.  It pools along side the enchiladas and was not appealing and so fatty.  I put the chilis in the blender so they would be less detectable to my picky family members.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. It's good with flour tortillas but my family prefers corn. The last time I prepared this dish I used tortillas which had been previously frozen and they started to break apart as I attempted to roll the enchiladas. I simply layered them and made a very tasty casserole. Thank you for sharing.

This was the 1st recipe I ever made from allrecipes.com and I fell in love. I made it for the 1st time 2 years ago for our christmas eve supper and it has become a family favorite. Even my mexican friends have asked me for the recipe. I make it exactly as described but I do add some prepared spanish rice to the chicken mixture just to bulk it up some and stretch the chicken further!!!

This is so good!  I am officially tossing out my old recipe.  We like red sauce so I added a small can of that over the top.  Some people mentioned a problem with sogginess.  The key is to bake uncovered until a medium golden brown.  The leftovers (if there are any) are divine.

I love love love these! My fiance hates sour cream but he loves these & has no idea it's on the ingredient list. I do like to use the chive & vegetable cream cheese. I also add half a can of enchilada sauce to the filling mix & use the other half to drizzle on the top before baking. Delish & a part of our regular rotation here!

The cream made everything mushy, It took a long time to prep and the taste wasn't all that great.  I'm not sure why the cream was added, I believe it would have tasted better without.

This recipe is awesome!!  To make it easier for me, I just cook boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins right in the oil and saute till tender and then add the other ingredients to that.  I also use one can of enchilada sauce poured over the cream.  Very rich and delicious.  Have made this several times and will continue to do so.

UPDATE: I had some left-over filling that I decided to keep for a quick snack later in the week. I topped tortilla chips with the heated mixture and had a DEEELICIOUS lunch! WOWeeeee! Simply the best enchilada I have ever stumbled upon!!! Made these tonight for my bf & I (who doesn't care for cream cheese - and he liked them anyways!). I was out and about, running errands today, so, to cut prep, I purchased a lemon herb rotisserie chicken and shredded the white meat (I saved the dark meat for another use). Here are the modifications I made (I felt these needed some "doctoring up" to suit my/our tastes): a) cut recipe in 1/2 for the two of us (I made 6 8-in. tortillas), b) used corn tortillas instead of flour ones (seemed more "authentic"), c) eyeballed the amount of chicken (used almost the entire breast), d) chopped an entire jalapeno instead of half of one, e) added about a 1/4 chopped white onion, f) added about a 1/4 packet of chicken taco seasoning to meat mixture, g) subbed Mexican blend cheese for monterey jack (and used WAY more than 1 cup) and h) spread a little (enough to cover) green salsa verde on the bottom of my baking dish and over the top of the enchiladas (after pouring heavy whipping cream over all). Baked for 20 min. covered / 10 min. uncovered, then broiled on high for a min. or so to "crisp". I let my enchiladas set for about 5 minutes (really helps - and gives them time to cool!). Served over cheesy rice. Wow! Thanks for sharing : )

I love this recipe and make it all the time for friends! I found it to be a little bland for my taste, so I add an extra fresh jalapeno (fresh is definitely key--I think you'd have to use the whole jar if you used pickeled!).

I had such high hopes for this one!  This was the driest enchilada i've ever eaten.  The only change I made was to ADD 2 jalapenos and 1 bell pepper.  Still, this was bland and had little flavor.  If I do try this again (and it's a big IF) I will add enchilada sauce to the cream to help the dryness and lots of seasoning to the filling.  Perhaps chili powder, cumin, and salt.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I have made it a couple of times now, each time to rave reviews.  The first time, I didn't have any jalapenos, so I added some of our favorite salsa to the filling mix and that was good.  After that, I've stuck to the recipe and wouldn't change a single thing!  Thanks!

Great basic recipe that can be a wonderful base.  Have fun experimenting with the filling by adding different ingredients.  I added mushrooms, onions and black olives to the filling.  Next time I won't cover with the cream, it didn't seem to add a whole lot for us.  I'll just top with the cheese.

We loved these enchiladas.  We modified them by using chicken broth and a packet of taco seasoning mix to boil the chicken in.  We also used enchilada sauce at the bottom of the pan.  They were very yummy, and I liked them better than the enchilada we would have gotten at a restaurant.

This is our new family favorite.  Everyone LOVED it.  The cream was key.  I baked boneless chicken breasts with salsa and taco season and then shredded as another reader suggested. I actually forgot to use the cream cheese but put in 1/2 a can of refried beans and sliced olives.  Definitely something we will make again & again.

Very good as is. Next time I will also saute onion with the garlic and japalenos. I think smaller tortillas would have been better also. I will make this again!

I LOVE this recipe! It's amazing.  Although I make my chicken in the crock pot with a jar of salsa and packet of taco seasoning for 6 hours.  But the rest of the ingredients and instructions make this recipe one to use over and over again. Heats up well the next day too!

THis was really good.  The filling was delicious.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil,garlic powder, pepper and salt until cooked, chopped up and added to filling mixture. It gave it more flavor.  I used monterey jack cheese and added a little red onion.  I used green enchilada sauce, heavy cream and monterey jack for the top. It wass yummy! I think next time i will go light on the cream cheese/cheese sauce so i can actually taste more chicken inside instead of sauce. But it was wonderful!

Loved it! We made it without having every listed ingredient and it was still wonderful. We skipped the cream cheese all together as well as the heavy cream. I think my husband put in a spoon of sour cream instead. We used 2% milk at the end instead of heavy cream. Clearly this is a lower calorie version but incredibly tasty. We decided to make it again the following week and used smaller  tortillas which we liked more. A must have!

These enchiladas were absolutely divine! I added in tomatoes and onions (in place of the garlic) and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. As some of you have said, I also did not have heavy cream on hand, so I melted some margerine in milk and poured that over the top, which worked out well. Pouring liquid over the top is to give your enchiladas something to boil in the oven and to protect the tortillas from getting too crunchy. The cream cheese was in my opinion what made this recipe, so if you love cream cheese, you will love this meal. It's a great meal to make to impress the sweetheart in your life - mine sure loved them!

These are the least authentic Mexican enchiladas ever! The cheese and cream is overpowering. Way too rich, not enough flavor.

I used this recipes with turkey leftovers. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I added red pepper flakes instead. And I recycled the 1/2 cup drained water from the canned chilies and used in place of 1/2 cup water to spice it up a bit. Our guests raved about this dish! I highly recommend this for Mexican food lovers.

This recipe was great. I used corn tortillas insted. A good way to keep them from breaking when you are rolling them up is to put them in some warm veg. oil, that has been heated on the stove top. It was soooo good! I didn't have any leftovers.

This was so good. I added enchilada sauce (about 1/2 a big can) to the cheese mixture, along with a diced onion. I also added the rest of the enchilada sauce on top on the enchiladas along with the heavy cream. I did not use chicken, since I didn't have any on hand, and I LOVED this.

YUM!  I made this recipe exactly as it reads and they turned out great!  I made them for Sunday dinner and my whole family loved them.  I'm sure this is not something I will make all the time, because they are pretty fattening, but then I didn't use any "low fat" on any of the ingredients either.  Excellent!

I used rotel tomatoes instead of chiles and left out the jalepeno (didn't have one at home).  I didn't have heavy cream on hand either so I used half milk and the other half was half and half.  I used a lot more cheese.  Instead of the water I used the juice from the rotel.  It came out great; this isn't my favorite meal and it doesn't really taste like enchiladas (they use that term very loosely) but it is a meal that is quick and easy and one that I will make again.

Amazing.  On the advice of others, I used half a can of enchilada sauce in the enchiladas and poured the other half over the heavy cream.  Came out wonderful.

Awesome recipe!  The only thing I did differently was add some pepper jack cheese to the cheese mixture to spice it up a little; I also added just a dash of crushed red pepper.  I have made this twice now and had the best compliments!  I definitely recommend this recipe!

This was delicious! I added more garlic and added an extra jalapeño pepper. Also, just cut up some chicken breast in the morning and seasoned with salt,pepper,garlic powder and some hot paprika. 
Turned out delicious and was easy to make. Everyone loved it and it was great the next day too. Thanks, Whit... this one is a keeper.

These are OMG good!  I did make the following changes:  I used rotisserie chicken, added 1/4 pkg of chicken taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture and mixed red enchilada sauce with the cream.  I cooked 15 minutes covered in foil, then sprinkled with sliced olives and green onions and cooked uncovered for the last 15 minutes.  Pretty sure they would be delicious even without the changes.  This is my new Enchilada recipe.  Can't wait to have them again.

These were pretty good. I added 1/2 chopped onion and an extra jalapeno, and subbed half Pepperjack and half cheddar for the cheese. Served with salsa. Yum.

My family can't get enough of this recipe!! I use canned chicken to save time and throw in a little taco seasoning. Then, I serve it with yellow rice, black beans, sour cream, and lettuce. These enchiladas melt in your mouth!!

The filling for this recipe was really good, however, it dried up just a bit much after baking.  I think next time I'll mix enchilada sauce with the heavy cream prior to baking.  Overall easy dish to make, and really good recipe to add to.

Definately a keeper!  My whole family raved and my 14 year old son said "mom, whenever you make enchiladas make these".  I couldn't ask for a better review.  I did add some taco seasoning and used a can of enchilad sauce mixed with the heavy cream.  Otherwise I followed it as it was.  Thanks!

Made this for a work potluck and it was a hit!  I prepared the dish through step 4 minus the cream and refrigerated it overnight.  In the morning, I added the cream on top and cooked 30 min. with foil on top and another 15-20 min. without the foil.  As other suggested, I also used Chicken Stock instead of water in the recipe and added 1/2 package taco seasoning to the boiling water and the other 1/2 to the saute.  Also used small onion and 1/2 pepper jack cheese.  It was perfect - very filling but great!

I thought these were alright.  I think they definately need more spice though.  I used 2 Jalapenos and they still needed some oomph.  But everyone else who ate them thought they were pretty good.

Wow!!! Really good. My husband and even my picky son raved about it. I did add some additional ingredients (taco seasoning, black olives, and enchilada sauce over the cream at the end) based on what other reviewers said. My son asked me would I make it again.

I made these with a few changes and I was so disappointed. There was way too much garlic in the recipe and the cream cheese was just a little too much for me. I would suggest getting a different recipe.

I was a little scared to make these because of all the changes people made, but I tried them and I am SO GLAD I did.  The only thing I changed was boiling the chicken in broth instead of water, and I probably used more cheese, and no jalapeno, but omg were these amazing.  I want to make them again and again and again.  But I could only fill 6 enchiladas, so if you want 8, either skimp on the filling or make more, these were amazzzzzzing.

These are very good and very creamy.  They are also a nice change from other chicken enchilada recipes, as this one is distinctive.

The are delicious.  A bit of work, but worth it.  Lots of flavor.  More calories than I like, but comfort food at its best.

This is delicious!  I did take other's suggestions and boiled the chicken in cumin and chili seasoning, along with chicken broth instead of water. I also used chicken broth in place of water in the ingredients. I added onion, omitted the jalapeno's, and used light cream cheese.  Also had salsa on the side as a topping.  It was most yummy!  Will make again and again!

This is an awesome recipe and I have already told everyone  I know about it. I added some onion to the fried mixture and also used chicken broth instead of water when making the sauce. I will have to make a double batch though! They were a huge hit!

These are awesome!! I added some salt and pepper and oregano to the filling and it was great. I also think it needs just a little more Jack cheese on top.

Outrageously good!!! This recipe is going to replace the one that I've been using for well over 20 years...and I thought IT was the definitive chicken enchilada recipe. We like spicy in this house, so I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of Montery Jack. I also made a batch of Red Enchilada Sauce...in Beef site, submitted by Sara...dipped the tortillas in the warm sauce to soften before filling and rolling, then poured what was left over the rolled enchiladas, followed with the Pepper Jack and whipping cream and refrigerated until baking. I kept the pan covered for the first 30 minutes of baking, then uncovered it for the last 15 minutes, and they came out just perfect, with a slightly crunchy top that was absolute perfection. Seriously, this recipe is OUTSTANDING! The filling by itself would make for a fantastic dip; I'll be trying that next. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe; we all enjoyed it very, very much.

Wow! I gave this recipe 5 stars with my additions... To save time, I used a store bought rotisserie chicken (lemon pepper flavor)and shredded it. I added a pkg. of frozen spinach (Cook in microwave, then squeeze dry and add to chicken mixture.)I also added about 3 chopped green onions and used a mixture of Mont. Jack and Cheddar cheese and low carb flour tortillas. They came out fantastic! Thanks!

I did make some minor changes. I marinated my skinless boneless breasts in my oil,lime juice, red wine vinegar, garlic, cumin marinade and grilled them and shredded them. 
I decided I want to add a little more chopped jalapenos next time for added flavor. I did not cover this casserole, it browned perfectly and not too much.
My family really went nuts over this recipe.

These turned out AMAZING!!  I made this recipe for my friend and myself.  I didn't even know he was a sort of chicken enchilada expert, himself!  Well, between his contiuous "thank=yous" and my own great experience with this recipe, I highly recommend it!  This is coming from a first-time enchilada-maker!   The left-overs (if any!) heat up really well in the microwave.  Also great with a "dollop" of sour cream.

I was really excited to try this recipe because I am not a big fan of really tomato-y enchiladas.  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the jalapenos. It all looked very promising during the making, but the cream cheese was just too much!  It totally overwhelmed the other flavors.  Disappointed.  My husband and I couldn't even eat the leftovers.

This was the best chicken enchilada recipe I found on this site, probably because there was no canned soup ..which leads to canned soup flavored enchiladas. The cream cheese within this dish made good flavor and the heavy cream made the cheese and tortilla's on top have a nice slightly crisp texture.Also butter 1/4c butter in small chuncks dotted all over the top couldn't hurt.The white sauce could use a little salt (~1.4tsp).Maybe use fresh instead of canned chilies with ruin everything unless you like them.

I liked this recipe, however, next time will make a few changes. I made it exactly as the recipe states the first time and found the edges dried up a little. While I liked the rich, creamy, taste, and see why families wih kids like this recipe, for us grown-ups, it was a little blah. We put spicy green salsa on top, which was good, next time I will add green onion to the chicken part and bake it with the green salsa and the cream poured over all. The green salsa recipe I used was from the Authentic Enchiladas Verdes recipe on this site- wonderful.

This turned out better than I expected and was so easy, and it is a great way to use leftover chicken.  I added one chopped green onion and some taco seasoning to the filling and skipped the cream, added some enchilada sauce on top instead.  Everyone in the family loved them, no leftovers!

I asked all my kids and Dh should this get 5 stars and all agreed. So easy to fix and was great!! I did add red sauce on mine before adding the cheese and milk on the top, and add a taco mix to the meat as it cooked. We love this and will be adding it to the rotaion!!

I found this recipe quite bland.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store instead of cooking my own and used corn tortillas, but did everything else as written.  It was missing something...

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  We prefer corn tortillas, but I made it both ways, and there were no complaints either way.

I also added green salsa (used a jar version)over the enchiladas, after the cream, b/c my husband likes green chili chicken enchiladas. If using corn tortillas, be sure they are completely covered with the cream, or they will be hard and crunchy.  Absolutley Wonderful and easy.  Shred your chicken with a fork..it's better that way.

I was a bit skeptical at first, with only cheese and cream for sauce and kept a close eye on them in the oven, but they were delicious!  I shredded the chicken and skipped the jalapenos (I like to add hot stuff after rather than chance it being too hot to start with), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Just what I was craving and pretty good left over, too!

What a great recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I have to admit that I cringed when pouring a whole cup of heavy cream on top!  I topped it with a little salsa as I felt it needed something red. I would definitly make it again.

This recipe was great!  I added more jalepenos and might think of a way to spice up the chicken mixture a little more next time, but I was dying for leftovers the next day!  Great recipe!

This is one of the best chicken enchilada recipes I have ever come across. I substitue corn tortillas for flour, but other than that I don't change a thing, which is rare. I have made this several times and always get raves from friends and family.

These were very different but good.  Not much like enchiladas but they have very good flavor.  Only change I made to the recipe was to add some onion with the peppers and used colby-jack cheese because that was what I had.  Husband loved it though not quite hot enough for him.  Next time will use 2 jalapenos.  Will certainly make again.

This was a great recipe! Cannot wait to make again. I had some leftover chicken breasts (3) and reduced the recipe down to three servings but it made so much more. I increased the heavy cream a bit and it was perfect. Next time, I may add more chopped green chilis. I think you could add all kinds of ingredients to the chicken mixture like olives, corn or rice. I think the chicken mixture would also be tasty as a hot dip with nacho chips.

I love really good, cheesey chicken enchiladas.  I thought this would be the recipe I've been looking for.  I made this last night and it is way too rich and sort of missing something.  I added 3 chopped green onions to the chicken mixture and added some green verde salsa to the cream at the end (3/4 c cream & 1/4 c salsa)and it still just doesn't have enough zing or something.  I wouldn't waste the calories with this one.

I made this in a pinch after my teenage son told me he was on his way home with several friends.  Used chicken thighs and breasts, 2 cans of peppers instead of the jalapeno.  Added taco spices to the chicken.  Also put tomatillo sauce on bottom of dish.  They gobbleled it up that night and the next day it was gone.

This is by far our favorite chicken enchilada recipe. We have tried others but once we found this one, we stopped trying others because this one is so simple and delicious. We also line the bottom of our casserole dish with red enchilada sauce and add the red enchilada sauce to on top after the heavy cream. We also boil the chicken in chicken stock and add taco seasoning to it. Honestly though, we have made it with and without additions and it is exceptional either way. Thanks Whitt for the best chicken enchilada recipe!

We all really liked it but if I hadn’t added some taco seasoning, it would’ve been too bland. I threw on some green enchilada sauce but would like to try mixing the red sauce and cream together next time.

Great recipe for a weeknight meal! I sometimes use a rotisserie chicken instead of the Chicken breast. I also use a can of rotel instead of the peppers.

Delicious and easy recipe. I used a Walmart Original flavor rotisserie chicken, and added the following - salt, pepper and Hot Hungarian Paprika to taste, 1/2 white onion chopped, 7 cloves of garlic and poured 2/3 can of green enchilada sauce and placed the rolled tortillas, and poured the remaining green enchilada sauce on top, then topped with the cheese and whipping cream. I served with a side of Isadora refried beans, and some Spanish rice. My family loved it. The truly great thing about this recipe is that it has a wonderful base that you can change up by adding your own different ingredients, and it will always turn our fantastic. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.

I made this as written. It was perfect. My husband loved it and he is a very picky eater.  I understand everyone wanting to make changes to recipes. I’m that way myself. However I think when we review a recipe we should review it as written. This one was just the right combination of creamy with crispy edges. I will definitely keep this in my favorite file

Used the cooking water in place of the water and didn't add the jalapeno so it wouldn't be too spicy for the kids. This was so good.

Love this recipe though would recommend cooking the chicken differently. Just bought some chicken breasts then cubed them and cooked them in a skillet with some olive oil, taco seasoning, and whatever your favorite spicy flavoring is.

These are amazing. I only made a few slight changes: 1. Used chicken broth to boil the chicken, 2. Used that same broth instead of water for the mixture, 3. Added a little red enchilada sauce on top before the heavy cream. Husband loved them, and we both think these are the best we've EVER tasted! Will be making these again and again!

Tasted like I ordered them at my favorite restaurant. YUM! I wouldn’t change a thing. I’ve served with various sides: fresh guacamole, Spanish rice, Kansas corn casserole, and black bean & corn salad. Always a hit!  Thank you!

This was delicious! I will forever use this as my enchilada recipe. I have made it probably 4-5 times now. I don't use as much of the graded cheese because it makes the mixture more oily than I would like. But other than that, a very good recipe. If it gets too watery (which happened to me once) I just added flour to help thicken it up a little bit. The diced green chili's really make the flavor in my opinion. I also added olives on the top for a little something extra. YUMMY!

No changes were made.  The recipe is perfect.  I love how the edges of the tortillas crisp up, and it is good leftover.

Made the recipe exactly as-is, didn't change a THING, and it was delicious. Super cheesy and chicken-y. One thing I may try next, though, is slow cooking some pork, shredding it, and putting it in place of the chicken. Might be even more delicious.

I will definitely make this again.  My family (even kids) loved it.  I added the enchilada sauce to the bottom.  I also used chicken broth to cook the chicken.  I used that chicken broth where it calls for water also.  I will definitely try and make the tortillas more firm next time by frying them slightly before hand and will use a little less of the heavy cream.  It's a great go-to!!

I have made this several times with good results..  I made this today and did not bake for an hour.   The result was soggy doughy tortillas.  If making ahead of time. I would fry the tortillas first  before rolling next time.

This is an excellent recipe, not over the top hot.  Creamy, rich and satisfying.  The only changes I usually make is I roast the chicken instead of boil to keep taste in and sometimes add pepper jack cheese if we want it a little spicier.  Great recipe, I have made it for years.

I was very happy to find this recipe that does not call for canned soup. I used canned chicken breast, which is good for this type of  recipe and I was very happy with the results, although next time I would add more cream as the enchiladas were a bit dry, but the flavor was very good. I will definitely make them again.

I REALLY LIKED THIS RECIPE, great flavor however I did add olives and homemade avocado tomatillo salsa on the bottom of the pan. I like a lot of sauce on top and there wasn't enough sauce for me so next time I will keep that in mind. I will make this again!

I have made aLOT of chicken enchilada's over the past 35 years - this is hand's down the best recipe yet. I figured the folks down south probably don't use canned soup in theirs and and hadn't found a recipe for CE that I "loved" until this one.   I've made it several times just as written (well . .I never cook chicken anymore - it's Costco or Sam's Rotisserie) and have made very few "enhancements".  Costco Rotisserie chicken (all of it - chopped up).  2 cans of green chilies - chicken broth instead of water - and last time I used the tortillas you cook up fresh. Those took it over the top.  They were AMAZING.   If there are any leftover for the next day, you're in for even more of a treat.  I've gotten where I mix this up the day before - flavors develop beautifully, then fill the tortillas the next day.  This is excellent just as is - easy, flavorful, and tastes like a high end Mexican restaurant's fare!  Thank You!!

This is, by far, the BEST chicken enchilada recipe I've tried. THANK YOU!!  Takes a while to make, but well worth it.  The only thing I did differently was I bought two whole, already cooked roasters from the deli (hot) and shredded both of them. It was 90+ degrees outside with humidity and I really didn't feel like boiling chicken AND having the oven on! Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful base recipe to season as you like. I did chop up a red bell pepper to add to the others. I used cumin, ground coriander, chili powder to taste.I sauteed the spices with all the peppers. I used thighs and breasts for the meat. My husband LOVED these. Garnished with some chopped kalamata olives.

These make 8 huge enchiladas.  I was joking that they look like mini burritos.  My husband said he likes them better this way anyhow.  Also, I used half-n-half in place of the heavy cream.
Rather than just boiling the chicken in water (don't do that).  I slow cooked it homemade sofrito and chicken broth to infuse flavor.  Bring the sofrito (2 cups) and chicken broth (1 cup) to a light boil, add chicken, turn down to medium simmer.  The liquid came up about halfway on the chicken in a heavy pot, cook for about 45 minutes, covered, until the chicken is fall-off-the-bone tender.  Cool.  
Proceed with the recipe.

So good! Added 1/2 envelope taco seasoning to filling and used canned jalepenos. Poured 1/2 can green enchilada sauce on bottom of pan and the remaining 1/2 on top along with cream. Could probably use reduced fat cream cheese and it would still be delicious.

This recipe was great. Only thing is it is a bit dry after baking the first time I made this. 
So, I now  double the cream cheese mix and save half, without the chicken, to serve on top after baking with cream. Husband's favorite he would eat these daily if I allowed it. 

Side note. Chicken mix can be saved and baked in tortilla for later. Great for lunches and easy leftover dinners.

Delicious.  30 minutes in the oven was a little too much.  Will do 20-25 minutes next time

I make this all the time!  Sometimes I follow the recipe (which is amazing by itself) and sometimes I add things...Lots of garlic, onion, cumin, (boil the chicken in cumin) havarti cheese, muenster cheese, any cheese really!  I also use the cumin water i boiled the chicken in instead of water.

To save time I bought cooked children. My family enjoyed these and asked me to make again. Easy and good. Used salsa when serving. To make a very rich  and colorful dish, serve with guacamole,sour cream and salsa, but very good just with salsa

These were pretty good.  I cut down the shredded cheese and added some Velveeta with jalapeño to give them more kick.  My husband said hey were too creamy.  I added salsa and sour cream after they were cooked and they were much better.

The thing I love about recipes like this one, is that they give me a base. I always do the recipe first, how it's written. Then I go back and check the reviews and see what others did. Finally, I make it mine. Maybe enchiladas or burritos this time but chimichangas the next or even taquitos or quesadillas. Between Whit, the suggestions and my ideas, this recipe and all the others are freakin awesome and make me a better cook!! Thank you!!

This was a great recipe--packed with taste if not entirely authentic. I made it exactly as written with the exception of adding some green onion to the top while they cooked. We had red salsa and guac on the side, but personally, I liked them plain. Each enchilada is extremely hearty, so these 8 will last our family of two through the week. My only complaint is that it takes WAY longer than an hour from start to finish (try closer to two) if you're going to boil and pick the chicken, which I do think is worth it. I would recommend prepping the chicken at some other time before cooking.

these were so yummy!!  however i did leave out the jalapeno cause my kids or husband don't like spicy stuff.  with that said they did need a little more taste.  i think next time i would add more garlic and some sauteed onions. but overall a great recipe.  It really didn't take that long to make either!

Just made this recipe today, I'm giving it a 5, which I suppose is "cheating" because I did a few things differently. Thanks to all the reviewers for the tips! I cooked the chicken the day before in my crockpot w. chicken broth, onions, garlic, 5 hours, then it easily shredded. As 2 of the 3 who would be eating this meal cannot tolerate much spice, I left out chiles & jalapeños. Also made the sauce last night, chopped up a little red bell pepper, white & green onions, 6 cloves of garlic, plus 1.5 tablespoons of a packet of taco seasoning while the cream cheese was melting. Had Mexican 4 Cheese shredded, so used that. By doing the sauce ahead of time, the flavors have a chance to really meld together. Today, I let everything get up to room temp before putting it together. Sprayed the dish and used red enchilada sauce to lightly coat the baking dish, then rolled everything in corn tortillas, drizzled more enchilada sauce on top along with Evaporated milk; baked 20 minutes covered in foil, 10 without the foil, then let sit for a few minutes. I served with Mexican rice, not homemade, will try that next time! We all agreed, even the spice loving one, that the level of spicy was perfect. We all had seconds and we have plenty left over!  By the way, I baked these in my toaster oven, worked like a charm!

This is a wonderful recipe, restaurant quality.  I did tweak a couple of things but it wasn't a significant tweak, just added about 1/2 cup of Carlita's mild enchilada sauce to the bottom of the baking dish before putting the enchiladas in there. I also warmed the cream in the microwave and dipped each tortilla in it separately just before filling them.  The tortilla folds and holds together easier that way and I use less cream. I then poured the red enchilada sauce over the top... you could use green/verde if you wanted to. This is a very versatile recipe.  I can only find Carlita's brand at Shoppers and normally we get the medium but they were out of it.  Otherwise, and except for using low fat cream cheese, I kept everything else the same.  It was delish and easier than most other recipes I've found for enchiladas!  I served the Carlita's enchilada sauce on the side in case anyone wanted to use it. I should look for an enchilada sauce recipe on this site to use next time. The 10 inch toritillas are enormous, I think I could scale that down a bit to 8 inch and have slightly smaller enchiladas and more of them.  Can't WAIT to have this as leftovers for lunch today.  Served with Alan's Mom's Mexican Rice. Excellent recipe, will make this many more times, and thinking of having a margarita party this summer, I think I'll make these to go with it!

Oh.My.Gosh. These are so easy and so delicious! I have a supper club at my house once a week and serve 12 people each time, and I seriously think they'd eat this every week if I'd make it for them! The changes I made are pretty insignificant. I used boneless skinless breasts (just for my own convenience) and eliminated the jalapeno to make sure everyone in the group could handle it. I substituted a healthy amount of green onion instead, and added a pinch or two of adobe seasoning.

I made two changes:  I added fresh spinach to the chicken/cream cheese mix and I heated the heavy cream and thickened it a little with corn starch.  

I served salsa along side it and after initially tasting it, my teenage son added a LOT of salsa.  He said that it tasted like chicken & cream cheese without the salsa.  He also suggested that I rate it only one star (couldn't eat it) until I pointed out that he cleaned his plate.  He responded by saying "it was dinner...only you & I are home...the polite thing to do it eat it."

I don't think I'll make it again as I have other enchilada recipes that my entire family likes.  If you make it, I suggest adding taco seasonings to the chicken as another reviewer mentioned.

This was wonderful, I had company over for dinner the first time I tried it and everyone loved.  They even asked for the recipe.  I followed some of the other reviews and substituted chicken broth for the water.  I also added a whole onion and green pepper to the filling.  I will definitely be making this again!

excellent!  This is a perfect recipe as-is, or changed in any number of ways.  Adding a small can of enchilada sauce is nice.  I think I'll be using this weekly or bi-weekly, at least while my grandsons are still living here:o)

These enchiladas were awesome.  Everyone LOVED them! I think I boiled my chicken a bit too long and added a bit too much, but other than that they were great! I think next time to change it up a little bit and add more flavor to it, I will buy the already made chicken and pull the chicken off the bone.  They come in BBQ, lemon pepper, and garlic rosemary, and always soo tender and juicy.

Best enchiladas I have EVER had. I made them for my boyfriend, he still hasn't stopped talking about how delicious they were. I used a few of the other users suggested additions, I added 1/2 packet of Spicy taco seasoning to the cheese mixture and mixed the cream with MILD enchilada sauce. It was very spicy and sooo good. I definitely recommend!

I do not eat enchiladas, however, the men in my life do. After reading all the reviews I used extra chili peppers and garlic, I also used chicken stock instead of water to cook the chicken and then used that broth for the recipe as well as the spanish rice I made as the side dish. In the end I also added salt and pepper to taste. It turned out very good, and was added to my recipe box.

Very tasty...Everyone who tried these enchiladas loved them. The only changes I've made is that I use red enchilada sauce instead of the green and I chopped jalapeno peppers in the mix. I also boiled the chicken in chicken broth. Top these with cilantro, green onion, and sour cream...DELISH!

LOVED THIS!  I used 2 chicken breasts, boiled in water with celery and italian seasoning/ salt.  It calls for one package cream cheese, one package montery jack cheese (shredded), and 1 cup cream(I used 1/2 and 1/2). So it's very rich. Next time I might try reduced fat in those items.  I drizzled the glass pan with Verde Sauce to keep it from sticking- great idea.  I also doubled the garlic (2 cloves) for more flavor.  I sautéed the entire jalapeño, seeds and all for some pop. We ate 6 of the 9!

These enchiladas were awesome. I wasn't sure about the flour tortilla but it worked. Next time I'm going to try corn, just because I'm trying to get off of white flours, etc.  It was a big hit around my house and a recipe I will use over and over again.

I made this recipe for the first time for some friends on date night. Huge hit. I doubled the recipe and it came out perfect. Fresh jalapenos are a plus.

I was sceptical to try this recipe as there was no red sauce in it and I love the red sauce in my Enchiladas- I'm so glad I made this recipe-this is our new "go to" recipe for mexican night in our house. Enchiladas can dry out really fast but this one was perfect.  I made a few small changes-boneless chicken breasts and cottage cheese instead of cream cheese for the inside and corn tortillas-WONDERFUL!

While my family was full of love for this recipe I was a bit more sceptical.  It was pretty good but bland.   I added some vegetables to the sauce and onion.  I also tried to liven it up with some spice.  Cumin seeds added a lot I think.

Yum!  Easy, creamy and delicious!  The only change I made was to add chopped, fresh, cilantro to the top.  This was enjoyed by everyone.  I served with Mexican Rice II  from this site and corn.  This is going into a regular rotation at our house ;)

This is the first time I've ever written a review - but I couldn't pass up the chance to say how GREAT these enchiladas are!!  The only thing I changed, was I added a few tablespoons of canned enchilada sauce to the top.  DELICIOUS!!

I made these for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It was the first time I had made enchiladas, and I thought they were SO good. My husband wasn't the biggest fan in the world of them, but he's a tough critic to please, and I think would have been happier if I used red enchilada sauce, instead of the green I had on hand.    These were super super good and I can't wait to make them for a cook off at work next month!

Im not a big mexican eater, but my husband is, so I thought I'd give these a try. It turned out to be a hit, not only did my husband love tm but so did I. My husband never eats left overs but I promise I din't throw anything away. What we didn't eat that night he took to work with him the next day. WOW this was a hit. Served with refried beans and cheese, rice, and chips and salsa. Great Meal. My husband said it was better then any mexican restuarnt Enchilada he has ever eaten..... and he is picky. Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good.  We like the flavor that the cream cheese and heavy cream added, but thought it wasn't quite spicey enough.

I have made these many times once exactly as the recipe stated then just a few tweaks because it's a fantastic basic recipe. 
Now I always add more jalapeno, green chilies, garlic, cheese and whipping cream because we like it a little more saucy . I make these for parties and they are always a huge hit!

Some of my family liked these, but understand that there is a ton of cream cheese and heavy cream in them.  They are basically in a rich white sauce.

I made this tonight for supper.  When I make this again, I will double the cream cheese/Monterey Jack mixture and possibly add another cup of cream.  That being said it was still fantastic I just like a creamier enchilada.

Excellent recipe. Very easy. This was the first time I have made enchiladas and i didn't really know what to expect. I changed the recipe a little bit. I added extra jalapenos to the sauce to spice it up a bit more. I also added dried cumin, extra garlic and a can of corn to the sauce. I used a mexican cheese mixture also. I topped them with sour cream, chunky salsa, and served them with a side of refried beans and red beans and rice. Start to finish only took about 45 mins, and my entire family loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe! I do add half an onion to the peppers though. Also, instead of adding water to the cheese, I subbed milk. Made the filling much more rich. I also scratch the cream by using a little of the left over filling and extra milk to make it a little thinner than the filling and pour it on top. Freaking awesome!

Absolutely EXCELLENT!  I love this recipe.  Generally I shred an Italian seasoned rotisserie chicken and add a few shakes of Montreal Poultry seasoning to the mixture in addition to the other ingredients.  Makes for a great mexican night!

These were very good. The only change I made was to add a little cumin and chili powder to the chicken when I added it back into the sauce.  We will definitely be enjoying these often.

I've made these twice now and they are so wonderful.  The first time I followed the directions exactly.  Last night I added mushrooms, red peppers and spinach to the pan when I was sauteing the garlic, jalepeno, etc.  It was even better.  This is a perfect enchilada recipe in my book - my whole family agrees.

My kids & I thought this was delicious!  I had never made anything quite like it before and was concerned but everyone gobbled it up!  I made the Best Spanish Rice from this site alongside and it was great too.  The only shortcut I took was to use canned chicken as I was running too late to cook up the chicken breasts and I'm quite sure it will be even better with fresh chicken.  Yummy Thanks!

Mmmm! Very yummy, decadent and easy. I sprinkled some black pepper in the chicken mix and pour enchilada sauce on top of half of the pan.

SINFUL!!!! I use the half baked tortillas that you finish on the stove top. My husband loves this dish. We always have the "Refried Beans without the Refry" from this site with this dish.

I would advise anyone who has the ability to "smoke" meats to try this recipe with smoked chicken. The use of smoked chicken elevates this recipe above 5 stars and I received nothing but rave reviews about it!

This is basically an americanized enchillada.  It's good, it's not bad tasting, however, the amount of cream cheese is WAY too much. I would say cut it in half at least.  I thought the ratio of chicken to cream cheese was very unbalanced and the overwhelming taste, pretty much the only i could taste was cheese. So i guess if you like cream cheese, and you like a cheesy enchillada, than this would be the recipe for you!

These enchiladas were pretty darn good but a little on the bland side,a little dry as well, will try to spice it up some next time, perhaps a little cumin and a second jalapeno.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I like some of the other folks added some taco seasoning to the meant and I used shredded pepper jack cheese to add some kick. It was very good and I have recommended it to several friends! Thanks!

This recipe was awesome.  I like my food a little more spicy, so I added some ancho chile powder to the chicken and cheese mixture, and they turned out awesome.  I will definitely make this again!

I've made this recipe several times, and I just love it! It tastes amazing and each time I try new things with it. I add a bit of taco seasoning and broth to the water for the chicken to boil, then add a little more jalapeno to the mix to give it an extra kick.

This was very popular with the family. I know a lot of reviewers make the point that enchiladas should be made with corn rather than flour tortillas, but I think that for this recipe using corn tortillas would make this dish too rich.

I used this recipe as a base and made some changes as suggested by reviewers. Rather than boiling the chicken breast, I cut it into strips, rubbed in taco seasoning and sauteed it with an onion, garlic and chilli. I made it extra spicy by adding hot habenaro chilli sauce. 

Instead of using full-fat cream cheese I used reduced fat cream cheese. I used salsa to cover the bottom of the baking dish then topped the enchiladas with more salsa and sour cream, then cheese and a sprinkling of paprika before putting it all into the oven.

It's very nice served with guacomole, roasted corn on the cob and mexican rice! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper! :D

I really wanted to like these, but they were just way to cream-cheesy for me.  I had added an extra jalapeno, but it was still difficult to get any flavors other than the cream cheese.

This was excellent - Consider it 4 stars as is and 5 stars with the additions I made based on reviewers - added red enchilada sauce on the top and bottom of pan. Topped all with sliced black olives. Boiled 3 boneless chicken breasts and shredded meat. Included 1/2 packet of taco seasoning to meat/cheese mixture. Also sauteed 1/4 cup red bell pepper and 1/4 cup onion with chilis, garlic and jalapeno. Excellent with spanish rice and refried beans. A keeper

Very good! I only had 1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast. I cut it into cubes, and sauteed with the oil, pepper, garlic, and added 1/2 an onion minced, and 4 or 5 chopped mushrooms. Turned out great! Thanks!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these enchiladas.  We had been on the search for an enchilada recipe that didn't require red sauce and stumbled across this one.  The only change I make is to use three boneless skinless chicken breasts which I poach with seasonings and shred to use for the filling.  Follow everything else to the tee and it's wonderful :)

Really great recipe. Added corn and a little jalapeno salsa to the mixture before spooning them into the tortillas. I also added enchilada sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before cooking and they turned out wonderfully. Rich and flavorful. My roommates couldn't get enough!

This recipe is fantastic.  I used 1% milk in place of the heavy cream and topped them with salsa before baking.  I am making this again this week!

This is a quick, easy recipe. I use boneless chicken breasts and cut this up as it's easier for me to do.  I have received many compliments on this meal and requests for me to bring it to potlucks.

This recipe is awesome. I doubled the green chiles and used 2 jalapenos to give it a little more kick, but otherwise left the recipe intact. There's a Mexican restaurant where I live and my boyfriend's favorite dish is comparable to this, so I was ecstatic when these came out so great. Definitely one of our faves :-)

Delicious. I used ground beef, but kept the recipe pretty much whole. They were very moist and crunchy. I can't wait to make these again.

I think this is a great recipe. Very tasty. To make it a little quick, I bought a rotissier chicken and shredded it rather than making the chicken breast. I also like a little heat so I added some more peppers. I just love this recipe!

Excellent enchiladas!  I did add chicken broth instead of water and based on my families taste and cheese preferences I used a blend of colby/monterey jack and pepper jack cheeses.  I also sauteed chopped onion with the peppers and chilies.  This is a fun and easy recipe I look forward to playing with.

This was absolutely AWESOME! I tweaked it just a little, added pablano peppers to the jalepeno and green chili peppers. Cooked the chicken breasts in water with a packet of chicken fajita seasoning. Poured some enchillada sauce on top and also added shredded pepperjack cheese to the Monterey jack cheese.  SOOOO GOOD! Hoping for more good recipes from this user! Will try it next time with ground beef for something a little different! Thank you!!!

These were really good, my husband who doesnt really eat chiken or cream cheese/sour cream mixture type foods actually really liked these.  I wish they had some kind of sauce to go with them.  Any suggestions anyone??

This dish was delicious. My husband and I made a few slight changes to the recipe. We used boneless skinless chicken breast to save some time and then boiled it in chicken broth instead of water. Instead of using water in the sauce recipe we substituted it with some of the chicken broth that we used to boil the chicken in. We split up the tortillas into two different baking dishes and in one we poured some enchilada sauce over the top before baking. This dish will definitely be served at our table again! It's easy and since it's not very spicy you can add different/more peppers to make it spicier if desired. (we served Mexican style rice as a side dish and they went very good together)

Incredible! Never had better! My boyfriend's version: Skip chiles & jalepeno but add sauteed onions and  red/green/yellow peppers; substitute chicken broth for water & use the extra enchilada sauce on top with the cream, as Michelle311 suggested. Amazing!

This was a great recipe. Tons of flavor. We ate them with salsa and next time will add sour cream. I added about 8 ounces of refried beans to the mixture when I added the chicken and will keep making it that way. Thanks Whit

loved this recipe but I am not sure you really need that cup of heavy cream, we made it without it and they were delicious.  Froze extra filling which was easily defrosted and used as a quick snack.  thanks for an awesome recipe, highly recommend!!

This is a very good starter recipe for chicken enchiladas. I pretty much stayed with the recipe except: I boiled the chicken in chicken stock with 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, used a mixture of Monterey Jack and Pepper Jack cheese, Chopped up about 1/2 -3/4 of a medium onion which I Sauteed with the jalapeno and and green chillies. And instead of wrapping each enchilada individually with a tortilla, I sprayed the pan and layered the bottom and top with tortillas.I bet a can of mushrooms and/or sliced black olives would be a good addition. YUMMY! And not very hard to make.

These were great! I ommited the peppers other than the chilie's as we just can't eat the hot stuff. Added olives and were thrilled with the results. Thank you!

This recipe is great!! My husband was a little skeptical at first, because of the cream cheese, but he always asks me to make them now!!

Delicious!!!  Only changes I made was adding a serrano pepper as well as the jalapeno the recipe calls for and I added 1/4 package chicken taco seasoning to the cream cheese, and used pepperjack cheese as well as monterey jack.  I also used chicken breast meat and baked it in the oven instead of step one in the directions.  Super yummy!!

i thought this was very good, the only think i did differently was used low fat cream cheese and added onion and black olive to the saute of garlic!

OMG!!!  The best freaking chicken enchiadas I have ever had and being from Texas that means a lot! My boyfriend who loves enchiladas, but not chiken ones loved this. He said from now on when I make enchiladas he wants these. I only added 3 things to the recipe. I added onion, bell pepper & about 1/4 C of enchilada sauce to the mixture before filling the tortillas. Oh, and I used corn tortillas and extra jalapenos - we like it hot here in Texas! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I made it for myself and my fiance along with some rice and beans. I ran out of time for extended cooking, so I just used the cut up chicken you can buy for fajitas or salads. Next time I'll definitely use regular chicken breasts.

this is a very good starter recipe. I made my own modifications as others suggested and it was wonderful! I used reduced-fat ingredients and whole wheat tortillas and everything was still fine.

I thought this was good...but there was so much chicken that it overpowered the other flavors.  I would use a little less chicken, add a few spices to it, and definitely top with salsa and/or guacamole next time.  My husband enjoyed it and ate it up so I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

This was a wonderfully easy, yummy recipe.  I doubled this and made one for me and another for a friend. Even though I took some shortcute (canned jalepeno, preminced garlic) everyone loved it. I am getting lots of requests for this one!

These were awesome!  The only thing I did differently was add a chicken taco seasoning packet to the mix.  Next time I will either cook them for a shorter amount of time or cover them (a little too well done this time) and double the recipes for leftovers.

These are good. However, I've never had a truly flavorful chicken enchilada! I'm not sure if it's just me or what, but it seems like all chicken enchilada recipes that I try are missing something! Still, they're good, and my husband really liked them. We added salsa and sour cream on top.

Stupendous!!  So good that I got over all that guilt from the heavy cream.  They don't need salsa on top; they're great just as they are.  The bottom of mine browned just slightly and that was the best part!

This was good but kinda boring. I added some red and yellow bell peppers and onion to the jalapenos and chilis. If I were to make it again, I would mix an envelope of taco seasoning in with the chicken for more flavor. Thanks.

We really enjoyed it, but ours was unbelievably spicy, so we had to tone it down to enjoy it.  After that it was great!  *Update* Good with sauteed zucchini, beans, or corn.  Very flexible!  Thanks WMonroe!

This recipe was amazing! I made it with almost no changes for my family except for adding red enchilada sauce to the cream and they loved it! I made it again for my boyfriend add omitted the cream and only used the sauce. We both like a little more spice so I added a random amount of other veggies: mushrooms, more jalapeno, red peppers, onions, ceyenne pepper, etc. He ate until he was sick. Delicious!!!

Really great recipe, and like others said, a great one to build on if you want more kick.  I actually had slow-cooked a pork roast with onions and potatoes, so I shredded all of that and used it for the filling with cheese, instead of chicken.  It was so incredibly good.  I made it for a party, and people took leftovers home.  I would definitely add more green chiles next time, but since we were feeding kids too, it was nice and mild for them.  Served with Mango Madness Salad...big hit.

one of my favorite recipes so far. I usually like more cheese than the recipe calls for, and moisten the tortillas with cream before rolling them up (I think it's easier to roll them that way). I also bake them with a few Jalapeno slices and sliced black olives on top.

They weren't bad but weren't what I'd consider enchiladas.  They needed a sauce on top.  Not what I was looking for.  Won't make them again.

The flavor of the filling was excellent, but I'm rating it 4 stars because we all agreed it needed more of a sauce on top. I'm going to search for maybe a green chile sauce recipe and try it again. It has great potential!

Good recipe.  Used 2 jalepeno peppers and monteray + pepperjack cheeses (1 cup of each) for more spice.  Just used chopped/cooked boneless chicken breast for ease. Next time I may try something I learned from a different but similar recipe:  dissolve 5 chicken boullion cubes in 3 cups of cream then dip tortillas in cream before wrapping/baking.  (Whether or not to reserve cream is your choice)

Needs salsa and sour cream. Would have been just as good with low or fat free cream cheese.

Excellent chicken enchilada recipe! So easy to make and they turn out great! Just like the introduction said, I set out the guacamole (which I found an easy recipe for on this site), sour cream and salsa to top them with and everyone loved them! Thanks for a great recipe that I'll use over and over!

We loved this recipe.  It was extremely filling.  It had such a rich creamy flavor.  For quicker prep time, we suggest that you pre-cook the chicken and pull it apart a day ahead.  This is definitely a make again and again and again!

We just cooked regular chicken breasts in the pan with the olive oil. We also used fat free cream cheese to counter the cheese and cream. We omitted adding any water. It tastes fantastic. From now on, we will use cream cheese instead of sour cream on our other recipes.

I thought these were very good but next time I will pour more cream over the top or add a little enchilada sauce like others recommended - I thought they ended up a little dry. The filling was great though!

So easy to make and outstanding taste!  My kids and I don't like hot but my husband does.  I make one dish with and one dish without the jalapenos.  I too double the cheese as others have posted.

I followed some of the others advice: added taco seasoning to chicken cooked in broth, substituted fat free evaporated milk for heavy cream and poured on just a little bit of enchilada sauced - this was soooo good.  Thanks for the recipe Whit!

Very good dish. Like others. I baked a whole chicken, shredded it then flavored the meat with marjoram, oregano and cumin before adding the cheeses. Used both corn & flour torts just for variety, enjoyed by all!

I followed several of the suggested modifications by sprinkling the chicken with taco seasoning, shredding the chicken, and adding onion to the saute mixture.  I may have strayed from the traditional enchilada by including a dab of black beans, red pepper flakes and rice in the stuffing.  The various modifications to this recipe suggest that it easily adapts to anyone's taste.  It was delicious!  Thank you!

Another winner! I have been so lucky. I did use boneless chicken breasts seared with a little salt, pepper, and cumin. I wish I would have cut the chicken smaller but next time. Great Recipe!

We went over to friends house last weekend and made this. Thanks to previous reviewers we were able to make changes. Hubby liked this better than I did. It was good but I am not dying to make it again anytime soon. The picture Kelly M. posted is gorgeous!

I've tried a lot of different enchilada recipes, and haven't found one that I really, really like.  This one will do until I find the ultimate enchilada recipe.  Instead of pouring the cup of cream over the top, I used a red sauce.  It was good.  I might try the cream next time.

4/19/06- Tried this again with half and half overtop.  Turned out okay.Still not thrilled, but good enough to eat at least once.

This is the most awesome recipe EVER!!! I have always wanted to find a chicken enchilada recipe that was as good as the kind I get in restaurants and this is BETTER!! I didn't use the jalapenos but added chopped onion instead and putting foil over the top helps them stay moist while they bake. This will be a permanent part of our menu!! Thank you  thank you thank you!!

This recipe was great.  Everyone loved it and the recipe was requested. The only things I changed was I used boneless chicken breast, and the broth for water. I also used a mexican blend of cheeses. Turned out wonderful!!

It is very rare to find a dish that my pre-school daughter will eat.  These were great.  Super easy and worth the calories.  I added cilantro and would have wanted more "hot" had it been an adult only meal.

These were really good.  I added taco seasoning to the chicken as others suggested.  Very rich and good!
Thank you!

This is absolutely 100% the BEST Enchilada recipe EVER.
I am a huge fan of mexican food and I've had my share.
I'm talking homemade or restaurants, this recipe wins hands-down!!
Thank YOU.  My whole family loves them.  Husband and kids aged 13, 8 and 4, they all love them.

These enchiladas were amazing!  I added extra jalapeno, garlic, and plus chopped red pepper, onion, and cilantro to the sauce - followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was DELISH.  I was afraid there wouldn't be enough filling, but the portions ended up being perfect!  Will DEFINATELY make again and again!

These chicken enchiladas are the best. I love how cheesy they are.  The are also perfectly spiced; not to hot.  I have made many kinds of chicken enchiladas in the past, but now these are the only kind I make.  I like to serve them with sour cream, salsa, and chopped olives.  Yummy!!

My husband and kids all loved this, and they don't normally all like the same things.  I didn't eat the completed dish since I don't eat chicken, but I tasted the sauce and it was wonderful. Definitely 5 stars.

This is a great enchilada!  So simple to make, few ingredients, quick.  I used boneless-skinless chicken, so I had a little more chicken than the recipe calls for, but these are the best!  Thanks for sharing this one.

I needed a chicken dish for work but several people don't like spicey foods or peppers. I usually prefer corn tortilla enchiladas. But...these were great. Since I couldn't add the peppers I added chicken taco seasoning while boiling the chicken to add flavor. Everyone raved! I look forward to making them with the peppers as my family loves things hot and spicey.

A super cheesy enchilada...almost too cheesy.  But my girlfriend loved it.  I was a little hesitant at first, but they turned out very well.  I will be making these again sometime.

Absolutley fantastic.  My family really loved this one.  We took advise and used Guacomole, Sour Cream, and Salsa on top.  I served with Mexican rice to complete the Mexican theme.  Will prepare again.

Okay, so I messed up and it turned out GREAT! I melted the cheeses as instructed, and then I poured the cream in the pan with the cheeses. Then I  added the chicken, can of corn and sliced black olives. I rolled mixture up in flour tortillas. Covered with the remaining cheese/chicken mixture and one can of green chili enchilada sauce and cheese. Baked for 30 minutes as instructed. It was AWESOME! Not bad for messing up!

Update:  Make this frequently now the "right way" and it is requested a LOT by my son and husband.  "CAN WE HAVE THE WHITE ENCHILADAS?"  Truly a family favorite and the cream (often I use half & half) makes a nice almost sweet sauce that off sets the other flavors.  Wonderful!

This was a good enchilada recipe!!  We made it recently and ate it for two dinners.  My husband liked it more the 2nd time because he thought the flavors were more melded.  I liked it more the 1st time for its crispiness.  but something for everyone!  We followed the recipe although next time I would use half and half or something lighter than cream just to take the fat down.  We made them with chicken and a veggie chicken and with flour and low carb tortillas.  We will make this again!

These were sooo good and so very easy! They are rich, so that makes them a definite "once in a while" in the meal rotation, but every now and then they are worth the calories!

This recipe was AWESOME! It was SO easy as well. I omitted the jalapeno, and we only had the 8 inch tortillas, but stayed with the rest of the recipe. My husband and picky 12 year old loved it. They both raved about how great it was! We will be making this for guests! ~ it's THAT good!

This was very good for a special treat.  I can't have hot spices so we need to find another way to kick it up.  Will try it with different herbs I can have next time (onions, cilantro, etc.)

This recipe is great, so so rich.  You can make this the day before & let sit overnight in the fridge, the tortillas absorb the cream & they are so good.
I got the recipe from a wonderful Mother at school.

Very good but oh so rich!  I like spicy food so I added extra jalepeno and some red pepper flakes.  Nextime I may add some chili powder and green onions to the chicken mixture.

Very good!  I too was wondering about the heavy cream, but it tasted just like sour cream when they were baked.  We used salsa with our meal.  This is a keeper.

These enchiladas were pretty tasty. The only thing I added was a chopped onion. Everyone at our party preferred these over my standard pork enchiladas.

Really good! I used 2 6oz packages of pre-cooked fajita strips- cut up. I also omitted jalapeno. The cream really soaks in- might want to use more. Next time I will also cover the dish- at least part of the time. Got a little crunchy on top.

I will definetely do it again. My fiancee also loved it! Thank you.
