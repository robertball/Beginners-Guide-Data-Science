I actually didn't use this as a salad topping, I used this as a coating for homemade chicken nuggets. I doubled everything, used a 1/4th of the salt and added onion powder. This was excellent as a nugget coating. The whole family loved it, especially my boys. I just used 1 tbsp. of EVOO in the bowl with the chicken and sprinkled the topping over the chicken, then baked it for 20-ish minutes. Really simple, really good.

Wow! DC Girly Girl you've done it again! (try her Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette Dressing) We're grilling steaks tonight and there's nothing that pairs better with a good grilled steak than a baked potato and a fresh garden salad.  Well I needed a little something to spruce up that salad and this was it! This was perfect with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I can't wait to expermiment with toasting the sesame seeds, subbing parmesan cheese or smoked paprika. I can definitely see this in a pasta salad, as a baked potato topper or even added to grilled or steamed veggies! Thanks for another great recipe!

Perfect! I needed salad seasoning for a pasta salad recipe and I've never bought (or even seen) the stuff before. This fit the bill perfectly and gave my pasta salad the zip it needed! I'll use this again. Thanks!

This was good!  Only takes a sprinkle.  I put too much on the first time.  Will try with only a dash of red wine vinegar for a fat free salad treatment.

This is what my family has called Linguine Salad for years. Club House used to bottle it (called Salad Supreme) and they stopped making it. My Aunt called Club House for the ingredients and they were nice enough to advise and she came up with the breakdown. Our family recipe calls for 3/4 of package of linguine (cooked), 1 english cucumber peeled & diced, 2 tomatoes diced, 3 green onions chopped and a bottle of Kraft Zesty Italian Salad Dressing. Mix it altogether & let sit, preferably overnight. Some call it "cold spaghetti" but I call it pasta salad with zing. It's awesome.

I have used something similar to this for years using seasoning salt, mix it with some sour cream and mayo and it makes a great dip for veggies.

Just made a simple salad with lettuce, carrots, radishes, green onion and light raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  Used 1 heaping tsp.  Really kicks it up a notch.  Can't wait to try it on other things.  Thanks for the awesome and simple recipe.

Very tasty and very versatile. I've sprinkled it in salad with a simple oil and vinegar dressing, on top of sliced tomatoes and cucumbers as well as steamed fresh veggies. The possibilities are endless with this seasoning blend. Thank you for the recipe!

Never even heard of this concept before, but it is an excellent thing to make and use.  Makes a simple vinegarette dressing "just right".  DH even asked:  "where are those salad sprinkles"?

Tasty. I used less Parmesan, sesame seeds & salt and opted for lemon pepper instead of the plain black pepper.

Sprinkled this on a tomato salad that had a splash of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice.  Pretty good.

I scaled this to two servings, which was the perfect amount for a 1/4 recipe of Pasta Salad, by Cyndie, also on this site.  I had all the ingredients on hand and this was a snap to put together.  I toasted my sesame seeds to enhance their flavor (bake at 350 for about 6 minutes, until golden and fragrant).  I think this seasoning really gave an added boost of flavor to the pasta salad.

This is a great addition to a salad!  I used parmesan in place of the Romano.  Loved it!

I loved this!!! I had made a pasta salad and was looking for something to give it a little Jazz.  I used this with Italian dressing and a red wine vinergarette.  On both occasions, my pasta salad did not make it for leftovers. I did not alter this recipe and I now have it prepackaged for easy use.

This was so good in pasta salad! I didn't have paprika and forgot to buy cheese, and it was still fantastic. I used Pasta Salad recipe by Cyndie from this site, and several reviewers of that recipe suggested using this one for a perfect complement.

I made this as directed.  I liked this better as a coating for chicken then on just a salad itself.  I don't know if I would make this again, there are other salad recipes I prefer more.

This is a real winner. After reading how other reviewers used it for additional purposes, I mixed it with cream cheese as a spread for roast beef roll-up sandwiches, using whole wheat flat bread. About a teaspoon to an 8-oz package of cream cheese. It was outrageously good. Thanks, DC Girly Girl.
