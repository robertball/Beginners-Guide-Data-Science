We really enjoyed these fritters!  
I actually fried them in a large pot with 1/2 inch canola oil on the stove over medium heat.  Only fry 3 or 4 at one time, though.  If they look like they are done frying on both sides, fry a few minutes more to assure doneness.  Mine were a little underdone.  i also added a couple of TBS. cinnamon to batter and glazed the fritters with a glaze I made out of 2 cups powdered sugar mixed with a little orange juice until it was medium - thin.  Just put about 1 TSP. glaze on fritter and let it run down over it.  Let set about 20 mins.  YUMMY!

These turned out very well. The only problem was telling whether they were done or not. We ended up making them  pretty small in order to make sure they weren't still gooey in the middle. I guess I should have followed the direction "rouned tablespoons". I make a sugar glaze to coat them with. In the end, they were just what I was looking for. (We live in Mexico, and I get a lot of cravings for American goodies that I can't find here)

I used this recipe but added my own variations since i didn't have all the ingredients. And the results were marvellous considering i've never deep-fried anything before! Very easy to make and very hard to resist. I reccomend to anyone follow the main ingredients, and experiment with flavors-i added apple/cinnamon and no orange peels. But turned out perfect anyway!

These were quite good considering I had to subsitute all purpose flour for cake flour and I didn't have orange zest.  These actually tasted like mini funnel cakes with bits of chopped apple in them.  Very tasty!  I will try these again!

My husband I thought these were great! They are not too sweet, but they taste great with powdered sugar, dipped in preserves, or anything else. I wouldn't say they are bland, so much as a simple tast to bring out the apples. We had to fry them about five minutes on each side, but they are easy to make and very yummy!

Very good, but very rich. We had trouble finishing them all! They were made better with a glaze made of orange juice and powdered sugar. And I used apple butter instead of apples since I had about half of a large jar I needed to use up. It tasted just as good, and just as apple-y!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I just found it to be bland despite adding in cinnamon and cloves as well.  I found it difficult to know if they were done as well.  I probably won't make these again.  Sorry.

This was a wonderful recipe, and it was delcious. We added a pinch of pumkin spice, and we used canned appels. We also took the grated orange peel out, and added some cinimon as well. Very easy and a nic change.

Quick to make and taste very good.  I used granny smith apples and found them to be a little to tart so next time I think I'll just make them plain or with a different apple or with strawberries.

I love the ease and quick time to make these.  I will make these again.

Very good!  I didn't have oranges on hand, so I used a pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon and some fresh grated ginger.  They turned out amazing!  Be sure to cook to a deep golden brown.  I will be making these again, and look forward to trying them with the orange in them!

I found this recipe after visiting an apple barn this fall that served the most wonderful apple donuts, and we just had to have more. This recipe was awesome and so close to those wonderful apple donuts, if only I had a donut maker, lol. We have made them many times now, they are just awesome!

A great apple fritter recipe.  We used twice the amount of apple which we liked and will try adding cinnamon next time. Yum.

Easy to make, but a bit bland without adding some spices and a sugar coating or glaze.

I'm giving this a 3 star because the idea was great and a good starting point but like MANY others I added cinnamon and the orange juice glaze. Though, after finishing, the orange in the glaze overwhelmed the fritter (which ALSO had orange juice) so I'd suggest use a minimal amt of the orange juice (thicker glaze) or stick with a regular vanilla. Next time, I'm going to try a jelly instead of the actual apples and see if the flavor will be more apple-y.

Not bad, but definitely needs more flavor as it is kind of bland. Still tasty though. We used Granny Smith Apples and Vegetable oil. We didn't have the oranges or the juice, but turned out not too bad all the same. Thinking this recipe could get a sugar / cinnamon center before being cooked with the right care and a floured board.

Good texture and very easy to make.  I thought they were just a tad on the bland side but I drizzled a little honey on top and they were great. Next time I might add a little cinnamon along with the powdered sugar just to add a little zing.

Very good fresh but the drizzle makes them soggy after awhile.  I need to find a better glaze.

I had a bunch of apples to use up and I  was waiting for a roast to cook so...I decided to make these for dessert. What a nice surprise.They turned out great. Tasted just like the apple fritters at the Timm Hortons Coffee shop. They smell fabulous and taste even bedtter(I had to sneak a taste) Oly gave them 4 stars as I would use more apples next time  and less sugar.DH thought they were a bit too sweet.

These were disappointing , nothing like a fritter-more like a cake that should be baked. The batter soaks up the oil you fry it in. I followed the directions & have been baking for years , this is a lesson learned- bake dont fry these or you will have an oil soaked flavored fritter,even after allowing to drain .

I  thought the fritters were easy to make and fluffed up nicely.  I did thing they were a bit bland despite adding cinnamon.  I will probably make these again adding more cinnamon and some nutmeg. PS    I grew up in Springdale...

I made exactly as recipe suggested. They are not bad but I certainly wouldn't call them apple fritters. The orange really overpowers the apple. I will probably make again but eliminate the orange zest and will add 3x amount of apple, some cinnamon and top with sugar glaze.

Made these after picking apples last week.  I'm giving it a 4 star rating not because I found faults with it but because I added alot of spices to it.  I think it ended up being 1 stick of cinnamon (1 tbsp?) and one clove ground up, and a tsp of nutmeg and maybe a tsp of ground ginger.  Made a glaze for them too which was good, but it tended to make them mushy after a little while.  Oh well, learning experience.  I will do these again.

I think that these deserve a solid five stars. They really are fantastic and what makes them so great is the addition of the orange zest/juice. I must have eaten a dozen - thankfully, we made them very small. This is important if you want to make certain that the insides are cooked. I'm saving this recipe, it was great!
