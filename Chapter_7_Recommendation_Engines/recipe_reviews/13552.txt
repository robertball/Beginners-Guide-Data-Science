I really liked this recipe! It was fun to make, smelled delicious the whole way through, and tastes very good. I used a little more than a cup of apricots instead of the 3/4 that the recipe called for. I also used white onion instead of red. The final result is pretty, and it tastes very good.  It is unique, sweet, and a little tangy. I would recommend.  :-)

I made this and took it to a large party. Everyone raved about it. It smelled and tasted delicious. They ate two bowls full of it!! Everyohe wanted the recipe. You can put less preserves in if you want it more savory (I cut the preserves, but added more chopped apricots) and be sure to add the salt and pepper, which heighten the taste.
I always taste as I go to avoid the "too sweet" thing that afflicts many recipes. I may have added a little  more onion as well and I know I had cabbage left over and threw that in there, too.

This is a very mild cooked red cabbage dish considering it has allspice, nutmeg and balsamic vinegar.  I think I would coarsely chop the apricots in the future, so that you can get a little apricot in each bite.  I prepared this exactly as written, but ended up adjusting the seasonings and adding a little more balsamic just to suit our taste preference.

I love cabbage both green and red. I made this using plump raisins and a teaspoon of brown sugar. My wife loves this one, so, I make it once a week.
