This is OK. I would like mine to be more frozen or thicker since you are calling it "ice cream." I even added one more frozen banana. It was more like a smoothie. I think 1/4 c milk would be more than enough next time. The taste was fine. I often just mix banana and milk for a breakfast drink. But since I was hoping for a frozen treat, I went ahead and put it in the freezer and will take it out in a bit. *Update: I put it in the freezer for a couple hours, and the consistency was much better. I took two photos--one before freezing and one after.

I have done something similar before because I love banana ice cream. I use at least half that much milk. And since regular milk has sugar in it, I have used unsweetened almond milk. To make it sweeter I have added whipped cream and even less milk or regular vanilla soy milk. If you do not freeze the bananas, before and again chilling the mixture after mixing, you will end up with a smoothie.

Was sadly disappointed.  It was not the thickness or tdxture of ice cream and was not at all adaptable. I didn't have frozen bananas so i added ice when i blended it. It was a smoothie,not ice cream. The name should ve changed.

It's a great recipe, although a bit runny. I switched it up a bit, I used one banana, half a cup of pineapple, 1/4 cup of milk. And let it sit in the freezer for about 10 minutes.
