YUMMY! I took the advice to freeze the dough, and did so for 45 minutes, with the 15 other recommended minutes in the fridge after.  Also, I beat the softened butter (don't use 'light' butter either) for at least 10 minutes before adding the sugar and about 5 minutes after before adding the flour.  I stirred in the flour easily until it was just barely moistened and this is the first cookie I've made in two years that actually came out 100% perfect!  I'll proudly serve this to my extended family.

A family favorite for many, many years that would be sorely missed if it didn't appear on the Christmas cookie platter. Tender, light and buttery, they nearly melt in your mouth. I've found that if I don't make too big an indentation in the cookie it doesn't spread as much and is much more attractive. (Actually, I use the rounded end of a child's medicine spoon that I've used since my kids were little, and they're both pushing 30 now!) Also, I use the amount of almond extract in the icing as called for in the original recipe, 1-1/2 teaspoons, and it's just perfect.

Halved the recipe and used vanilla instead of almond extract. (I hate almond flavored anything) Also dusted them with powdered sugar instead of glazed. This was a great recipe. The cookies were crisp and buttery without that flour tast to them. I shaped them and used a berry jam. I also froze them before baking and turned down the oven to 325 F. This helps with the spreading of the cookies.

This recipe gets 10 stars, and that's before adding the glaze! The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp vanilla, in addition to the almond extract.  I used orange marmalade and raspberry preserves, but any flavored preserves would taste delectable with the shortbread. Advice:  smaller is better.  I found they spread less.

These were really good.  I used strawberry jam in place of the berry because my kids love strawberries.  Note:  when filling the holes with jam, we used a plastic bag that we cut the corner like a pastry bag.  So much easier than trying to spoon the jam into such small holes.

These are the BEST shortbread cookies I've ever tasted.  In fact, I made them exactly as written and I won first place in a cookie exchange.  The shortbread itself would be so versatile but the addition of the jam just makes them so festive.

  Edited to add that I have made this multiple times and they turn out perfect every time! The only thing that I have started doing differently is to mix orange juice concentrate (pulp free)  with the powdered sugar to create the glaze.   I like this so much better than the almond extract glaze.  And the little hint of orange in the glaze looks so pretty against the white cookie.

Awesome recipe.  I used Splenda and sugar free jam (apricot, peach and straweberry) and they turned out perfect.  I left out the glaze since we cannot do sugar.  FABULOUS!

OMG! These cookies are by far some of the best looking and some of the best tasting! They're buttery, "melt in your mouth", sweet little treats that you'll be proud to serve to anyone because they look like they came straight out of a bakery! A neat little trick I learned when making these: after rolling these into little balls, flatten slightly and to make the indention use the end of a chapstick. I baked these cookies on parchment paper and be sure not to over bake. I would love to try a strawberry jam and vanilla extract combination. I think you could easily substitute a lot of flavor combinations here.... Great cookie!

These cookies are delicious!  I make them for showers and holidays and change the jam colors to match the theme of what I'm doing.  Raspberry is my favorite flavor when I'm making them "just because".  Delicious every time!

4.5 stars. These cookies are tasty! Definitely a sweeter shortbread. I also add 1 tsp vanilla extract to the dough. They taste great with the recommended 2/3 cup sugar as well as reducing the amount to a heaping 1/3 cup. The dough is a little difficult to work with so be sure to refrigerate as directed in the recipe. Make the cookies smaller then you think they should be as they will spread during baking--I try hard to get the 21 yield that the recipe lists, but usually end up with 20 cookeis. I recommend using your index finger to make the indentation--it is the perfect size! Definitely recommend fill a plastic bag with jam and snip the very tip of one of the corners to "pipe" the jam into the indentation. Use this same method to drizzle the glaze too! Bake mine for 16 minutes and they are perfect every time! (Also, if you bake with unsalted butter be sure to add about 1/2 tsp. salt)

Used MANY tips from your comments; thank you all!!! :) 

I used vanilla extract b/c I didn't have almond. Rolled all the dough at once (made 30 balls) and put on a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and made my indentations right away (to prevent cracking later) then put on a stool in my ice-cold garage for 45 min. Put in the fridge next and baked 10 balls at a time on a smaller cookie sheet with parchment paper. 

Used peach, apricot and raspberry piped into the indentations through a small slit in a snack size ziploc bag and baked at the quoted temperature. Made the preserves/jam smoother by whisking first before filling the cookies. After baking, added more filling while the cookies were still very warm; it blends better.

For the glaze, I halved the recipe (it was plenty) and used half-and-half instead of water. I also piped this on the cookie using the ziploc bag trick. I think there is a typo in the glaze recipe and the amount of liquid should be TBSP not tsp. 

These looked and tasted great and I will make these again!!!

Used Vanilla instead of Almond flavouring and made one batch with apricot jam and one with raspberry jam ... nice and tart with the sweet shortbread.  This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies were great. They did spread quite a bit in the oven, so next time I will freeze them first as others suggested. I made a lemon glaze instead of almond, which I thought complimented the berry flavor very well.

This is a very easy recipe.  They taste fantastic and turn out looking just like the picture.  I normally don't like almond but it is very mild and compliments the cookie.  I used strawberry jam and wisk it smooth to make is easier to put in the cookie.

So easy and so good! I didn't have any jam so I made some with frozen mixed berries, and the cookies were still easy! The dough is beautiful and makes a very light shortbread. And they're perfect for my egg-allergic niece.

Gosh I have always loved these. Can't imagine why I only think to make them at Christmastime. They melt in your mouth. Adore raspberry with almond flavoring. I had to add 2 Tbs of softened cream cheese to get this dough to pull together for me. Made it a bit sticky so I used floured hands to roll the dough into balls. Did not need nearly the 14 minutes to bake for me. Five Stars!

Wonderful! So easy to make and tastes great! I rolled them to the size of a marble and used the wooden spoon, overfilled with rasberry jelly and sprinkled with powdered sugar when done. Possiblites are endless! Thank you for sharing!

so easy to make!  thank you for all of the tips.  i don't have a mixer, so i cubed the butter and melted some of it to get it to cream faster.  it worked great.  also, i didn't have to refrigerate the dough.  it was very workable after mixing.  added raspberry jam from trader joes.  these cookies were so simple and perfect.  just the right amount of jam.  also, used vanilla extract instead of almond and just put powdered sugar on top, no glaze.  these are my new favorite!

These were a huge hit as far as being easy, and fantastic flavor! Everyone wanted these cookies! The jam cooks out of the center a bit so that affects the appearance.  Maybe the glaze helps that not matter.  We ate ours without glaze because they tasted so perfect that way.  YUM!!

Yum! I put the mixture in the freezer for about 40 minutes before I made the cookies. I used half margarine and half smart balance which turned out fine. I used vanilla instead of the almond for allergy purposes. Thanks!

This is a pretty decent recipe. Super easy to make and the recipe allows you to get creative. Here are my suggestions and modifications (for how to make them look like my photo):
MOST IMPORTANT: Watch the amount of flour you add to the dough, because you'll likely not need all of it! I've never used all of the flour because then your dough will never stick together and get crumbly (like others have complained about here) and you'll end up with non-smooth cookies too.
-Use SALTED butter (trust me)
-Use the back of a rounded 1/4 tsp to put the dent in your cookies AND to load up the jam, it will turn out much neater and prettier that way
-I skipped the glaze and instead melted dark chocolate (an white), placed into a ziploc (you can do this with the glaze too), cut a corner of the bag and decorated the cookies with that
-Depending on how much butter you use, I would freeze the dough for about 40 min, let sit at room temp for 15 before forming the balls with your hands. If your dough is too soft, your cookies will spread too much.
-As others have stated, the jam globs shrink after baking so I suggest you mound your jam to compensate for shrinkage and spread out the existing jam right after they come out of the oven if there are gaps. I like that the jam gets concentrated and sets more in the oven so I prefer that over adding jam once the come out of the oven
-The jam I use has no sugar added and is just fruit,  fruit juice and pectin. It tastes MUCH better than traditional jam.

These cookies are delicious! I did freeze the dough as others had recommended.  However, this made the dough split on the sides when I put the indent in the middle.  Once the dough warmed up a bit, I was able to make the indent much easier.  Just wanted to add also that the glaze for the top required more like 4 teaspoons of water for me to be able to work with it.  Enjoy!

WOW! These are the BEST! I am a great cook, but a terrible baker, (too much exact measuring - ha!) but with only a few ingredients, these are out of this world! Pretty too! Can't wait to try out other flavors of jelly. Rasp and strawberry were great! Hmmm, I'm also thinking of sprinkling toasted hazelnuts pieces on top,baking them off without the preserves (still with the thumbprint) and putting a little nutella in the center after cool....

this is the perfect shortbread cookie recipe!  light, delicate and flavorful...i think the almond extract makes it.  i didn't refrigerate dough where recipe stated so my cookies spread a lot but they were delicious anyway.  i used my favorite guava jelly and melted it first in the microwave and just spooned in.  most of the jelly dissolved and so cookie sticks to your teeth when eating - added additional jelly after baking as recipe stated - that was a good idea - they looked more presentable and had a truer jelly flavor.  next time i think i should use preserves or jam.  thank you very much for sharing your recipe!

I'm not sure what went wrong, but when I doubled the recipe I couldn't get the dough right. I slapped what I could on the cookie sheet, tried to fill them with preserves even though they were crumbly and hoped for the best. What I got tasted like a pop tart. I threw away the rest of the 'dough' without making the second batch.

I've made this recipe for a few years now and it always gets rave reviews! I don't make the cookies as shown however. I make it as a bar cookie. I make the dough according tot he recipe. But I take about 2/3 or the dough and press into a small bar pan with a 1 inch lip. Then I spread the raspberry jam over the top of the pressed dough. It doesn't have to be even but all the dough should be covered with some of the jam. Take the remaining dough and break into smaller pieces then press gently in your hand. I press it to about 1/4 inch then place on top of the jam. When you're done some of the jam will be showing through which is OK. Bake at same temp but give it a few extra minutes until the edges turn slightly golden. Cool and cut. If you want to add the icing you can but I don't. They are wonderful without it. literally melts in your mouth!

These remind me of a cookie that my mom would make every year for Christmas. Instead of the glaze I drizzled semi-sweet chocolate over them.

These cookies are great!  They're simple, easy to make, with very little ingredients.  However, was I the only one who had to add a bit of milk or cream to the dough?  Every time I've made these, the butter, sugar, almond, & flour mixture is just WAY too dry and crumbly, so I always add 1-2 T of milk to moisten it up.  I have also subbed strawberry jam and vanilla for the raspberry jam and almond flavoring, and they are great that way, too.  The glaze is optional, as these taste delicious with or without!  I've also found using a baby spoon was the easiest way to fill the jam neatly into the centers, as it held exactly the amount that fit.

My new favorite cookie! I used unsalted butter, did have seeds in my raspberry jam, and needed to add a little more water to the glaze recipe - the results were amazing!

This recipe is fantastic.  I like the taste of almond, so I added 1 full tsp of almond extract to both the batter and the glaze.  I found that when I mixed the batter, the dough didn't come together well; however, when I mixed it up by hand after mixing with the mixer, it came together nicely into a ball of dough.  These are definitely a new family favourite!!!

These were delicious. I made them just as the recipe says and they came out wonderfully. They spread a little more than I had anticipated, but the flavor was great. I thought the icing might be too much but it added a very nice touch. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

WOW!!! These are so delicious. I could eat the whole batch by myself! I would reccommend shaping them into balls before refrigerating...if you shape them after refrigerating, some of the butter in the dough will soften and the dough will splatter around during baking.

Great recipe!! I made these for our Laybor Day picnic at my in-laws. I did make 1 ajustment to them (I used splenda for baking for the sugar) and only use 1/3 C. instead of what it asked for. Being a Diabetic I make a lot of things with splenda. They turned out great. Will be making these again. Thanx =) =) =)

Pretty good.  Excellent taste.  However, the dough is really crumbly and even after chilling, is hard to keep together.  I had to add a touch of water.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the dough.  Drizzle is lovely, but wait until the cookies fully cool or else the drizzle will meld with the jam and destroy its potential to be attractive.  I also made these pretty large  to have room for jam - had about 16, not 21.

These are delicious, and I'm usually not a fan of cookies that don't have chocolate in them. :)  I made these to include in my Christmas cookies plates and they got rave reviews from everyone.  I also used vanilla extract (personal preference) and dusted them with powdered sugar because I ran out of time to make the glaze.  They were beautiful looking and tasty!  Also, I found it was easier just to use my thumb to make the well in the cookies rather than the spoon handle.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is now my favorite cookie recipe! So easy and so pretty. Everyone loved them. They sold quickly at the church bake sale. I think I made it easier by putting the dough in a plastic bag for the one hour in the refrigerator. When you take out the dough, it is stiff, you can kneed it with yoour hand while it is still in the bag. You can use a cookie scoop to make the cookes more uniform in size. If the dough gets too soft, throw it in the fridge again. You can also use a sandwich bag for the jam. Cut a very small hole in one corner and squeez it into the holes of the cookie. Using plastic bags make clean-up sooo easy.

I made these for my family and everyone loved them! I'm not a fan of fruit fillings in pastries, but I couldn't get enough of these!

These turned out really yummy. Mine didn't look anywhere as pretty as the pictures that other reviewers submitted, but they did taste wonderful. Mine spread out quite a bit for some reason. I used strawberry jelly instead of raspberry jam and left off the glaze, but followed the recipe for everything else.

Really Tasty. :)
I'm making these cookies for a school party.
I also freezed the dough instead of refrigerating it.
I would recommend this recipe to other people.

I have been making these cookies for years! The 2 things I do differently is to use black rapsberry jelly(the best) and for the glaze, use 1/2 cup powdered sugar,1 Tablespoon of milk and 3/4 teaspoon almond extract.

These are the BEST shortbread cookies I have ever made. They are delicate and buttery perfection. I used a thimble for making the indentation. It worked perfectly. I ommited the
glaze because I thought they were yummy without
it. You will not be disappointed.

These are scrumptious little cookies! I used Salted Butter and my little 1" cookie scoop to make these and it made 63 cookies! I also used the end of my wooden spoon to make the indention for the jam. Worked great! I added in 1/2 tsp. vanilla along w/ the almond extract in the cookie batter. Yummy! I used a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of apricot jam and orange marmalade, it gave it that perfect tart sweetness. My oven took 19-20 min. for these to bake. I had to add in 2 teaspoons of milk to the glaze mixture along w/ the 2 tsp. water to get it to loosen up enough for glazing. Great tip about using the sandwich bags for filling them and for glazing them!! Just add in your jam and glaze to each bag and snip off a tiny end of the bag. It makes it so easy and not messy. I also added in a bit extra jam AFTER they had baked. The jam seems to evaporate in oven a bit. While they are on the cooling rack, just squeeze on a bit extra jam to refill the indention, makes them so pretty! Finish with your glaze. I am going to make a second batch today, since these turned out so lovely. This round they will be filled w/ a blueberry lemon flavored jam (Easy Lemon Blueberry Jam recipe on All Recipes)

Very, very good recipe. Made last year with original recipe and was loved by all. This year I used vanilla instead of almond extract, and sprinkled with confectioners sugar instead of the glaze. It is just as great!

Just finished making these. Thought I had a disaster. When I finished mixing the dough was SO dry and crumbly I could hardly get them to hold together to roll. When I tried to make the indent for the jelly they cracked and crumbled. I put the dough back in the stand mixer, got out my canola oil and drizzled some in while it was slowly blending. Got a fairly soft dough, and thought what the heck, let's try it. There is no change in the taste, of baked or raw dough(it's good!). Also I put my jelly in a small ziplock, cut off a tiny corner and squeezed the jelly into the impressions. Used a chapstick end to make those. Thanks for the recipe

I have made this recipe several times; however, I do not add the icing because they're perfect without it.  I like to make my cookies in different shapes with pretty designs that are filled with preserves or berry pancake syrup.  Everyone raves about these treats and they have been called "addicting."  They are simple to make - I follow the recipe as is with the exception of adding vanilla extract instead of almond extract - and I can make them quickly in a time crunch.  Wherever I take them, the platters always come home empty because they are so delicious!  See my photo "Giant Berry Shortbread Dream" for fun cookie ideas!

I followed recipe and incorporated all advice in reviews. My cookie was ok, but just not great. The dough did not get the balled up quality while mixing, so i had to incorporate a little liquid. I had no problem with spreading at all--they stayed close to my original size too. Wish they had browned up a little more, they are cooked but look white. Taste is just ok, interestingly it improved by the next morning (but still just ok). I think I'll try a different recipe next time, maybe a traditional thumbprint cookie.

I've tried numerous recipes from allrecipes.com but this was the only one that did not come out well. First, maybe it's because I didn't "refridgerate" the dough for an hour but freezed it for 30 minutes. I did roll it into a ball and added the jelly in the center but it came out like flat disks from the oven. It was crispy but was waaaayyyyy too sweet even before adding the glaze. I'm sure it's just me since everyone else seemed to love it and said it was easy but it was not sucessful at all.

These were excellent.  I used some homemade strawberry freezer jam I had & ran out of almond flavoring, so had to use vanilla for the glaze.  The glaze did need more water between 1-2 T.  I like shortbread a lot & this was a nice twist...the jam was so yummy with the shortbread cookie.

Excellent! This recipe is even better (and simpler!) than another I've been using for years. I didn't chill the dough first (I'm a little impatient), and the cookies were still fabulous. I just didn't get that perfectly round shape. I didn't make the icing, either. The prep time was about 2 minutes, and cook time 16 minutes. Very fast, very easy. :)

Unbelievable! These went SO fast at my husband's work & I myself couldn't stop eating them! (Definitely putting in extra time at the gym!!) I made one batch with vanilla & one with almond extracts & both were yummy! I did use a pastry bag to fill them with & that was so much easier. Definitely recommended for any occasion!

I got 2 1/2 dozen out of this recipe but I wish I had made them smaller. I wanted a more poppable cookie and these were still on the big side. Half the batch I added 1 chocolate chip to the center before I placed the raspberry jam inside it. YUM!

These are delicious.  As soon as the dough was ready I formed small balls and made the holes before chilling in the freezer.  I too used a small sandwich bag to pipe the filling.  I did not use the icing as they are perfect without it.

I've made these for years. I've had 2 adjustments. I don't add almond to the glaze as it's a little overkill and I use jam with seeds. Make sure the water in the glaze isn't too cold or it seizes.

These were easier to make than I thought they would be. With a little practice they could easily rival a bakery bought cookie. I added a little more water to the glaze so it was easy to drizzle over the cookie tops. This isn't the best shortbread I have had but overall I was pleased with the result and will make again.

Fantastic recipe!  I made a few changes per other reviews.  I substituted vanilla extract for the almond - just because I didn't have the almond on hand.  I froze the dough for 45 minutes, and it came out much too hard.  Next time I will only refrigerate for an hour.  I rolled fairly small balls and used the back end of a wooden spoon for my hole.  I, too, whisked the raspberry jam to make it smoother.  I also used a Ziploc bag to 'pipe' it into the centers.  Exactly 15 minutes at 325 degrees turned out the perfect tender cookie.  Cooled 3 minutes on cookie tray and then to wax paper for drizzling the glaze.
DH raved!

great tasting cookies! a few things i changed:
had to bake them a little longer than the recipe says, about 20 mins. 
I used GUAVA jam and put choc chips in a few. very good!!!
Also, had to add about 1 tbsp more of water to the glaze, because it was too clumpy. however after adding the glaze to half the cookies, realized its way too sweet. so next time, i'm leaving that out.

This was an excellent, buttery cookie! I made them with vanilla extract and strawberry jam because that was what I had on hand but I'm excited about trying a lot of other flavor combinations with this recipe. Thanks!!

This is a great cookie. I used chocolate and nuts instead of jam and they turned out great and very tasty.  The only problem is getting them to look nice.  The dough was too firm after refrigeration and when I tried to make the indentation, the dough cracked.

We loved these cookies! I used a bit more than 1/3 cup of jam - probably about 1/2 cup. And for the glaze I prefer to use half and half instead of water. Thanks for a great recipe!

I must've done something wrong, because my cookies started spreading when they got in the oven...and then they just kept spreading!  I froze it before and everything, like people suggested. I will try it again, maybe with more flour or a different brand of flour.  They still taste good, they're just unattractive.

WOW. I just had one fresh from the oven and it's heavenly... I got a larger yield than the recipe originally said, and the cookies took a few minutes longer to brown (about 22 minutes). I refrigerated the dough overnight and used Blue Bonnet spread instead of butter and vanilla extract as I did not have any almond extract (I would love to try it though!). I suggest making deeper holes and putting lots of jam in them. Also, I took the suggestion of someone here and put the jam in a ziploc bag, cut a small hole in the corner and filled the cookies. I don't like my cookies too sweet so I skipped the glaze, and they are great without them.

Excellent little cookie! These would be great for any occasion too by changing the jelly to suit the seasons. I really liked the almond flavor in this too, it really added something extra and made these stand out from the rest. Thanks for a fantastic cookie!

OMG these cookies are so yummy! Whenever I make them, I alternate between using almond and vanilla extract. Either way it tastes good. And I never make glaze, I just dust them with powdered sugar. Definitely a keeper!

Was a nice recipe. I usually don't like recipes where chilling of the dough is required, but these were worth it! I  chilled mine in the freezer for 35 minutes, then 15 in the fridge and they were very managable. I also used the top to a 2-liter soda bottle to make the indents. These seemed to enlarge the cookies quite a bit, which is why I think they needed another 5-7 minutes extra baking time, at least for me. :) I used Apricot, Strawberry and Blackberry jams. Strawberry was the biggest hit, followed by Apricot.

These were very good.  I used 1 stick butter, 1 stick margarine and 1 teaspoon of almond extract in the dough.  I shaped into 24 balls and then refrigerated dough for 24 hours.  I wish I had put the imprint in before I refrigerated, but I didn't.  I used a small water bottle lid I had in the kitchen to make the imprint.  Put my raspberry filling (mine happened to have seeds and it was filling not jam)into a ziploc bag snipped the corner and piped into the imprint.  Baked and let cool then put the glaze into a ziploc and piped it over the top.  They turned out very good, no problems with the cookie spreading too much either.  I will try these again maybe with lemon and raspberry....lots of options.

Absolutely delicious. I used vanilla extract in the dough and almond in the frosting. Also, the frosting needs about 3 tablespoons of water not 2 teaspoons.

I don't like to make an untried recipe but I needed a Christmas cookie to take to a party and liked the festive look of these plus they had a good rating so I made them. My family and I just had to try them while still warm and we really didn't like the flavor or texture but since that's what I made, I took them to the party anyway. Well...they were a huge hit! After receiving many compliments, I just had to try another one and I couldn't believe how much better they were after completely cooling. I will make these again but will probably make them the day before as they were even better the next day.

This cookie is so amazingly delicious! I made these for my family yesterday and wow! were my expectations met! Honestly, I prefer these cookies with the drizzle alone, they don't even need the jam! So delicious. I'm still craving them after eating 8 of them myself! = ) The only thing is I needed to use 6 teaspoons of water, 2 is definitely not enough! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious.  They get more moist when stored in an airtight container.  They freeze pretty well too.  My 9 yr old daughter requests these every year when we make Christmas cookies.

These cookies are the stars of every assortment I've offered at potlucks and other events. They are  among the first to disappear and are worth the effort to make.  I've found that adding an egg to the dough helps it stick together and crack less when making the  indentations for the jelly.  I also add a teaspoon of salt to balance the sweetness. When the weather is hot and I'm not inclined to have the oven on long, I double the recipe and spread 3/4's of the dough in a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper, spread the jam over the entire expanse, and crumble the rest of the dough over the top,  pressing it down lightly.  The resulting bars are just as delicious as their cookie counterparts.

18 min,quarter size dough by using a teaspoon. Delicious! Used peach jam and did not even need to add the glaze. Wonderful softness and just a slight  crunch. Dough was too sticky even after an hour in fridge. I just threw on the jam on top and it still turned out great.

I LOVE these cookies and so do my roommate and her classmates. I followed the recipe exactly minus the glaze the first time.  I also use homemade jams which had much less sugar than the store bought kinds.  They were good, but a bit too rich.  So, the second time, I was slightly more generous with sugar and put in a little more jam and they came out perfect- just the right amount of buttery sweet taste mixed in with the tartness of jams (goes really well with pineapple & kiwi jams)  I also used vanilla extract instead of almond as I'm not much of a fan for almond extract.  I put the dough in the fridge for 30-40 minutes and didn't have any problem handling it.  For some reason, I always end up with way more than 21 cookies though, which is great!

Delicious. I used Solo pie/cookie filling, apricot, and never had a problem with the fruit running. So buttery and flakey, very rich. I also did not drizzle them with frosting as felt they were sweet enough. I'll try it the next time when I use other fruit.

These cookies came out beautiful and they taste great too! To prevent the cookies from cracking, make sure to make the thumbprint right after you roll them. I used a 1/4 teaspoon to make the thumbprint and it worked really well.

I've always wanted to make these, they're so cute! 3/4 cup canola oil is a fine substitute for the butter if you're thinking of your health. And sugar-free preserves go perfect with it. Overall, glad i made this.

Muy delicioso!  These little treats are so easy to make and offer a break from other, more sweet desserts.  Thanks for sharing... will keep and use regularly!  EDIT:  8/27 - made these for a co-worker's birthday and they disappeared in no time!  Love, love, love these cookies!  :)

I don't know what I did wrong...Whenever I baked these, all the butter melted and they flattened out like pancakes and all of the jam oozed out all over the cookie sheet.  I probably would not make these again unless I made them in mini muffin cups.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I've made these cookies at least 10 times by now! I don't change a thing, they are perfect! I shape and fill each cookie before I refrigerate them for an hour! I also make them very small.. This way they keep their shape and don't spread!!

i found these cookies to be a lot heavier than i thought they'd be but they were still really tasty (it was probably poor rolling on my part). i kept an eye on them to check for browning on the bottoms. everyone loved these cookies! they practically disappeared!

Delicious! I made these exactly as written and they turned out great. The refrigeration is important. I rushed the first batch and although they tasted the same they weren't as pretty as later batches which were refrigerated longer.

I was very busy in my kitchen when I made these. I was cooking for friends and made a time consuming meal. I quickly got my cookie dough made which was easy with the minimal amount of ingredients that it took and threw it in the freezer so I could get back to cooking. About an hour later I got them rolled out into 1" balls and put the raspberry preserves in them. They were on parchment paper to save time. I let 3 pans set out while finishing my meal because there wasnt room in my freezer to put them back in. I was very worried they would spread when in the oven because they got soft again but didn't have a choice. As soon as my rolls came out of the oven I tossed the first sheet in. (temp was same for both rolls and cookies) They came out PERFECT! Everyone loved them and I put what was left in a lock n lock container. Today they still held their crunch and with the jam in the middle, gave them a really good difference in texture. My husband made a pig of himself on them and thats good enough for me. I will be making them again...and again. Thanks for the great recipe.

It was easy and fast to make, but way too sweet for me even without the glace. I'll try using confectioner's sugar next time. My cookies retained their shape, so next time I'll flatten the dough before popping them in the oven.

Did not work at all, the cookies just melted while baking into flat discs.  If I were to try it again, I would definitely take the advice in placing them into the freezer before baking to prevent this.  I was going to give them as a house warming gift, but never mind, they slide pretty fast into the trash.

The recipe was really dry and crumbly, so i had to add about a TBSP of water and then put it in the refrigerator. I used Vanilla Ext. because i had no Almond and i prefer vanilla. I used the plastic bags to put the jelly in and it worked well. If you are planning on making these for a lot of people, i would double the recipe because it does not really yield a lot. They tasted really good i just did not like that the dough was so dry.

I used vanilla instead of almond only because that is all I had. I cant wait to try them with the Almond next time. I also didnt refrigerate because I was in a hurry and used my cookie scooper. They were super easy & super fast. These were absolutly delicious!

This is a very good recipe. If your not crazy about almond flavor, then subsitute the almond for vanilla. It was a tad bit to almondy for me. NOW I CAN SAY IT.. THIS RECIPE WAS OFF THE HOOK. The only problem i had was after beatin the sugar and butter i couldnt get the dough to form a ball it was too sticky so i ended up adding xtra flour(more than the suggested amount), and despite all that it STILL came out yummy! I could imagine if i probably followed the EXACT directions it would come out xtra yummy! I probably beat the sugar and butter until it liquified and the dough was to watery to turn 2 cups of flour into a ball.

Wonderful...and they do melt in your mouth..I made a double batch and was glad that I did...everyone LOVED THEM.  TIP:  when using your wooden spoon handle to make an indentation in center of cookie for your filling PRESS DOWN NOT TO FAR INTO COOKIE otherwise your preserves will leak thru bottom of cookie...also an 18 oz jar of preserves will be adaquate for a DOUBLE BATCH...This recipe is a keeper and I WILL make these again...they are so yummy and easy to make..Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are very easy to make and delicious. I had to reduce the baking time down to only 10 minutes and watched them so they would not burn. I agree that the chapstick tube works great to make perfect little thumbprints.

The dough for this recipe came together beautifully and the dough was very easy to work with. I refrigerated it for about 45 minutes before baking. I also refrigerated the assembled cookies for about 30 minutes before baking. They still spread when baked, but they looked and tasted great. 

I used unsalted butter and added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also did one batch with almond flavoring and one batch with vanilla and both were great, but I think I'll do the almond regularly. I also used blackberry jam and left off the glaze. These beautiful jewels will become a regular in my Christmas cookie rotation!

I made these to add to a cookie platter for Christmas and thought they were just okay. Mine ended up pretty flat and greasy. They are tender and have a good flavor but are not quite what I was expecting. All the other cookies on the platter were devoured before these were even touched. Maybe it was a chocolate loving crowd. =)

These cookies are delicious. So simple and easy to make.  The only addition I made was to add crushed walnuts on top of the raspberry jam. This is a keeper.

Love them! One of the easiest and quickest cookies I've ever made! Also super tasty!
Here's what I did differently:
-No glaze (out of powdered sugar)
-Used vanilla (didn't have almond extract)
-Didn't refrigerate them (no time)
-Cooked for 8-9 minutes, any longer and they burn
-Used strawberry jam (my boyfriend's favourite)
I also made one special cookie in the shape of a heart and the shape held up really well. These would be totally cute for Valentine's or a special day for a sweetheart ^_^

I had A LOT of trouble getting the dough to form a ball and ended up having to add some water. They still came out tasting great. I'm going to try again and be a little more careful not to add too much flour at once. Good recipe.

Oh my gosh these are good! I used the exact recipe and didn't change anything but the jam, because I only had strawberry on hand. This recipe's a keeper!

Delicious, very festive looking cookie! I'm not a baker and they turned out great for me! I loved the glaze and think it definitely adds something to the cookie.

I made these last year and they did not spread out and were very crunchy and yummy! However, I have tried 3X this year to make them and instead of staying small and fluffy looking they are more flat. I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong! Great recipe though!

These were easy to make and look great on a cokie tray!  I used vanilla extract instead of almond.  Each batch did 2 1/2 dozen good size cookies.  I also subbed half and half for the water in the glaze and needed to add 1 1/2 tsps more.  The glaze recipe was enough to do 5 dozen cookies and dries to a great shine!  Thanks for a keeper!

These were so good and just beautiful. I did have to add more liquid to make the glaze workable but I am sure that just varies with the humidity.  They set up and were very portable, they arrived at my event looking perfect.

These cookies were OUTSTANDING!! The only thing I did different was add about 1/2 cup more flour....the dough was a little too sticky to work with. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I was VERY PLEASED.....They turned out soooo yummy and looked like a gourmet cookie! Thanks! :)

Very good.  These were a hit with everyone, light and fresh with a nice center.  I used a cream cheese icing drizzle (left over from making cinnamon buns) and it worked very well with this.
Great recipie.

I loved this recipe and made only a few changes. I didn't have any almond extract to I used vanilla instead. I also put in almost a half cup more butter(since I like them REALLY REALLY buttery), added a third cup cornstarch and a bit of brown sugar too. These turned out SOOOO good!

Despite the fact that I had to cut the recipe by half for my hubby and me, the shortbread was awesome! I used strawberry and grape jam! Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious, even without the glaze. I will make them again but this time about 3/4" diameter as they made too big of cookies for my 4 & 2 year old. Thank you.

Absolutely buttery & rich & delicious! Brought some to a friend's house this morning, they were gone in minutes. Our 2 1/2 year old kids really loved the jam centers. They do tend to spread a bit so be sure to leave room for spreading. Delicious! I used an all-fruit strawberry spread, and if you have a small child, you might have a small rubber tipped metal spoon lying around...this is the perfect tool for filling the holes!

These are wonderful!  I did add almond extract and an extra 1/2 cup of sugar.  I made the dough and my children rolled them into balls and filled them with jam.  You definitely need to whip these for a long time, at least 15 minutes, for them to turn out perfect.  One thing we liked was to melt some white chocolate chips with a tablespoon of shortening and then drizzle this on the cooled cookie.  The combination of red jelly and white chocolate drizzled on top made them beautiful, festive, and tasty.  These are  perfect for when you want really easy cookies that look really fancy.

These really do melt in your mouth; it is hard to eat just one.  I made some with raspberry jam and some with strawberry jam; both were delicious.  They are pretty cookies and look great for Christmas.
