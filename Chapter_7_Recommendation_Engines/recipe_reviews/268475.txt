I was looking for a spritz recipe for Christmas and found this one. I am always hesitant to review a recipe that I modified, but this is a really good basic recipe, and I modify every recipe I use. I used butter flavored Crisco, instead of butter.. I substituted powdered sugar for regular sugar , when you do this you need to triple the amount (1.5 Cups).  I also had to add 1 TBS  milk to make the dough super soft to mush through the cookie press. The end result was a light buttery cookie. I dipped some in chocolate for some added holiday cheer. Very good basic recipe.

There is something wrong with the time and temp.  Baked at 400 for 10 mins gave us the dark almost burnt bottoms.  Changed to 350 for 8 mins gave us great cookies.
