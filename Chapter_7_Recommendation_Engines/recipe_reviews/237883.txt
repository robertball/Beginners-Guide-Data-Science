Delicious!  We thinly sliced the potatos, mixed all together, then baked @ 400 degrees in the oven for 1 hour in a covered pan.

These were delicious and totally devoured. I went back for more and the boys had eaten every bit of it. I didn't have the full amount of mayo so I subbed in some sour cream and also a bit of Ranch dressing. I messed with the spices (I make an all purpose low salt mix) and added lots of granulated garlic and more pepper (we love pepper). I had some sharp cheddar in the fridge that needed to be used so I tossed some in. Yum, I might just make some more today. I'm going to try and use greek yogurt and see if that works since I'm out of mayo.

These were good. I used red potatoes and baked in the oven 325 degrees for 1 hour. I didn't cover them, because I wanted them to be a bit crispy. They turned out just right. I put some shredded mozzarella on top the last 5 min. If I grill or cover them, I would probably reduce mayo by half. I tried this recipe because I saw it on Recipe Group.

We grill potatoes often with cheese and onions, but have never tried it coated with mayonnaise. I did half the amount of mayonnaise after reading another review, and it was plenty. I liked how the mayo kept the potatoes from drying out and you don't notice the mayo taste and yet still gave a nice flavoring. I only had red potatoes on hand and they cooked up nicely in the 30 minutes, we set our gas grill on 400Â° and cooked on indirect heat.

AR Buzz Recipe Group Selection - we always enjoy this recipe and have been making a similar one for years. Instead of 1 cup of mayonnaise I only used 1/2 cup. I used garlic cloves and because we all like garlic, I also used garlic salt, added cheddar cheese along with freshly grated Parmesan and sprinkled generously with Hungarian paprika and freshly ground pepper.  I had a yield of five packets. Easy to prepare and easy to clean up! Also a great recipe for camping. Thanks Ally T for sharing!

2 thumbs up Ally :-)

This recipe is delicious as written.  The only change I made, I use smoked paprika for that added "grilled" flavor.  After I flip them on the grill, I poke holes in the foil to let out the steam so they don't get mushy but stay crisp.

These were pretty good. My husband raved and ate them all up but I thought they were just ok. I eye balled all of the ingredients and doubled the parmesan cheese. I used the good stuff but to me this recipe is not worthy of expensive reggiano. Five stars for easy prep and clean up!

Recipe Group Selection:  30, August 2014 ~ I made a half a batch of the potatoes using fresh dug new baby reds and yellows. We all enjoyed this version of grilled potatoes and had a delcious dinner.  Served them with 'Key West Chicken', 'Sassy Freezer Slaw' and 'Mexican Corn On The Cob (Elote)' all AR recipes.

Used Miracle Whip as the mayo.  Was good overall.  A touch of fresh rosemary might be awesome.  Could hardly taste the paprika.

Great grill recipe!  My son found it and has made it several times for his friends. Everyone raves about it. So easy to make and then just pop the packets on the grill. Be sure to flip half way through the cooking time.

Recipe group recipe 9/03/14- Very very tasty! I couldn't stop eating these! Great flavor. My husband grilled them for me after I prepped the packets. I used non stick foil for easy release, and potatoes slid right off into serving dish. Husband said the grill was running hot for some reason, even though we have a gas grill. So what happened is potatoes ended up very crispy, but not all of them were completely cooked through. (And yet I ate and ate) yes, they are that good! We like our taters very crispy anyway. Will now make as part of our grilling rotation. Thanks!

Recipe Group: Perfect potatoes on the grill! And everyone ate their entire packet; that is a success. Red potatoes were on sale, so that's what I used; no other changes except I don't use cooking spray, so brushed olive oil on the foil instead. Nummy I need to make these again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

I just found this recipe and I've got everything together.  I don't have pepper flakes (I can't find them and my husband would rather go hungry than try anything red).  Do you mean hot peppers or sweet peppers?  I tasted everything before I added the potatoes and then began to spoon out the rest into my mouth, it was so good.  It's about to go on the barbecue and later I'll let you know what I think.  Sorry about the pepper flakes, but I have never seen them in my grocery store, plus I don't want to end up in divorce court.  Fingers crossed.

Made this for Recipe Group...Very good! I used non-stick foil, which worked great for this recipe. The whole family enjoyed these, and best of all was the easy clean up...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These potatoes were spectacular! I made them with a few tri-tips for my family and some friends. Everyone loved them. I made them to the recipe with the exception of the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any on hand. Thanks for sharing.

Substituted Colby Jack for Parm because that was what was available in the fridge.  I could have left the on the grill for a few minutes longer, but I let my grill get very hot and was afraid that they would burn.  Overall, they were a success and Iâll be making them again.

The potatoes were a little too rich for my liking, I'm assuming because of the mayo. If I make them again I would use less mayo. Otherwise the taste of everything was okay.

I loved this dish.  I happened to have some homemade mayonnaise and used only Â½ cup as recommended by others and I felt it was the perfect amount. I also used Yukon gold potatoes because thatâs what I had on hand and I cut them in half.  Based on another review, I laid them out on foil on a large baking sheet, covered them with foil, and put in a 400 degree oven. After 45 minutes I took the foil off and let them brown nicely (on a higher rack) which took about 15 minutes. When it was done, I added salt and pepper to taste. Absolutely delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They were tasty, but not a recipe I would use often.

Made this for a Memorial Day picnic.  It was delicious.  It had a nice little spicy bite to it which was fine for the adults.  My granddaughter, however, kept complaining it was too hot after every bite she took.  It didn't stop her from going back for another bite tho.  Would probably leave out or cut back  on the crushed red pepper for her serving next time.  Will definitely make again.

Great Dish!  Used only about 1/2 recipe and was Awesome.  Next time may just cut mayo and keep same rest of the ingredients.

Loved these and using mayo instead of the usual oil added lots of good flavor :)

I made this tonight to go with grilled chicken.  The mayo and Parmesan mixture was weird.  I won't be making again.

Very good. A different twist for potatoes. I used a yellow onion and grilled the packs for 40 minutes because I wanted the potato's  little crispy. Came out very good.

Excellent potatoes!!! Very easy to make, grilled these, then brought them inside under the broiler on high to crisp them up, they turned out beautifully!

Everyone loved it.  This one will be made again.  My son wants me to make it for his birthday dinner.
