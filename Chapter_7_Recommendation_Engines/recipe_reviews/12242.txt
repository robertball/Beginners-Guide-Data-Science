I like to use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy in this recipe. Also, after the pie is made, I drizzle chocolate over the top. The only way I could see that someone didn't like this recipe would be if they followed the directions wrong.

This is a wonderful dessert!  I must say that the previous person reviewing this must have reviewed the wrong pie, as these you DO NOT BAKE.
I like to use creamy peanut butter, a 1# box of powdered sugar (no need to measure it out), a 12 oz. container of Cool Whip instead of two- 8 oz. ones, and when I'm done I drizzle the tops with some Hershey's syrup and add some Reese's peanut butter morsels.  Looks great AND tastes great!

This is really good and creamy. It is very rich so you only need a small serving.

Very very sweet.  I used half the amount of powdered sugar the recipe called for and it was still too sweet.  I'll continue my search for the perfect peanut butter pie.

I made this for a family gathering not to long ago and I dont think there was one person that did not like this pie. I have been asked to make again. And with it being so easy to make how can I refuse. I did add chopped reese cups and hershey syrup like other reviews did. Makes my mouth water just thinking of it :)

This is an exceptional recipe - I have been making this for years & lost my recipe. I got my original recipe from a old drug store in Plains, GA about 25 years ago. Thanks for sharing it.

This is a very good pie.  Not QUITE fluffy enough, but I might cut back just a tad on the cream cheese and fix that problem.  Other than that, perfect peanut butter pie.  I used chocolate cool whip for the filling and regular cool whip to top the pie and boy was it to DIE FOR!!!  I also crumbled Reeses cups on top for garnish.  Perfect!  Took it to an NFL draft party today and they couldn't believe I didn't buy this somewhere at some fancy bakery.  No leftovers.  I guess that speaks for itself, huh?  Thanks for the recipe Jan.  This one's going in the permanent album.

A pretty good basic recipe.  I used a chocolate crust instead and sprinkled a mixture of  peanut butter & chocolate chips on top.

I missed that this was for 2 pies! And bought only one chocolate cookie crust and one tub of whipped cream. So after mixing all but the whipped cream, I decided to go ahead and fold my one tub in and place all of the filling in my one crust. I topped it off with peanut butter cups. Of course, I licked the spatula, and I think itâ€™s pretty tasty. Side note, I used creamy PB instead of crunchy.
