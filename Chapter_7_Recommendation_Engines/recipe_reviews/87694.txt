I used a bag of baby carrots.  I poured off most of water after the carrots had cooked and then added in about 2 tbsp. butter, 4 tbsp. brown sugar, sprinkled on some dill, salt and pepper.  The sauce smelled so good that I wanted it to stick to the carrots a little better so I mixed 1 tsp. cornstarch into 1 tsp. water and poured into the pan to thicken the yummy sauce.  Excellent.

The addition of dill to a standard brown sugar carrot glaze is interesting. My problem is, why is this called "maple" dill carrots, when there is no maple? This should be made with maple, rather than brown sugar, to have that name.

Made these last night, they were wonderful. I used a fat free butter substitute and Splenda brown sugar blend. I found the sauce a bit runny like most people, but found that if you turn the heat way up after mixing in the butter and sugar rather than turning it down, the sauce will thicken and stick to the carrots. Thanks for a great recipe, we loved it!

I really like this recipe and have made it three different ways. 1) Made as written which is very good, but should be named "Brown Sugar Dill Carrots." 2) Made as directed plus added 2 drops of Maple Extract to get the maple flavor you'd expect from the recipe title...also very good. 3) Most recently, I substituted 2 T. Pure Maple Syrup in place of the 2 T. brown sugar.  I like it best this way.  I've also found that 1 1/2 T. butter is enough, and we prefer it with just 1/8 tsp each of the salt and pepper.

We liked these. I used 3/4 t dried dill, next time I will only use 1/2t. I also cut the black pepper down to 1/4 t. The ammount listed was too much.  The recipe should say to boil the carrots, they don't really cook when simmering. I drained out the excess water & added the rest of the ingredients. I wanted to use baby carrots but the store was out so I used reg size ones. It was a little runny. I made these with pork chops. Thanks, I will be making these again!

I steamed the carrots to retain more nutrients, then tossed everything into a Pyrex Portable casserole.  Traveled well "over the river & thru the woods" on a 30 minute trip to grandmother's house.  Yummy and unique, everyone raved!  Thanks!

My oh my, delicious!  I drained all the water off when they were tender enough, and cooked on high to get a nice thick sticky sauce, very good!

Have made these twice this week.  The first time I cooked the carrots on the stove and today I used the microwave.  Both came out delicious.  I will trying making them with maple syrup next time. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe... thanks so much.  I think the times might be a little off though cause it took a lot more than 10 minutes to cook.

This was so easy and so good!  I normally hate carrots (I'm like 5-year-old, trying to get veggies down...) but this was so tasty, I couldn't help but clean my plate.  One change I did make was doubling the amount of dill, butter and brown sugar for the same amount of carrots.
Delish!

These are good, but I can't give them a full 5 stars because these "Maple dill carrots" are missing a key ingredient!  MAPLE SUGAR or MAPLE SYRUP!!  Brown sugar and maple sugar/syrup are certainly not the same thing... at least not in Canada! :)

Yum!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I used 3/4 tsp. dry dill weed instead of the fresh stuff.  My girlfriend thought it was too spicy so I may cut back on the pepper next time.

I had a lot of homegrown carrots that I needed to use, and I printed out this recipe over a year ago, and never tried it before. I am so glad I did! The flavor was perfect! I made no changes to the recipe except dried dill instead of fresh. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

Tastes great, but I think the adjustments I made bumped it up another notch. First, this is rather sweet, so I increased the black pepper to a full teaspoon to compliment the sweetness. Next, I used fresh dill and doubled the amount. Third, I added a handfull of raisins to the simmering carrots for the last 5 minutes. And finally, I added one chopped apple and stirred it in after it was all done cooking.
Make sure you start sampling the carrots every few minutes after about 15 minutes to get the consistancy and crunch that you desire.
I actually had people wanting to lick the bowl!

This is great, I added zucchini to this towards the very end when the carrots is thoroughly cooked. Then just toss both veggie with rest of the ingredients. You don't want to add the zucchini at the beginning because it will turn watery.

I have made these 3 holidays in a row and everyone loves them! I have used baby carrots but they get too soggy. Allow yourself some extra time with the butter and brown sugar as it takes a little while for it to thicken up. This is an excellent recipe!!

Great recipe; delicious result. Didn't have fresh dill, so used about 3/4 tablespoon of dried in its place. Like others, I'm not quite sure why this recipe is called "maple" when there's no sign of any maple in it!

Am I the only person to notice these are called MAPLE Dill Carrots but there is NO maple in them??? As a New Englander I couldn't imagine these any other way!!! It's as easy as replacing the brown sugar with REAL maple syrup. For those finding the sauce runny, after you drain the carrots put them back on the burner to evaporate the excess moisture, then cook the syrup ingredients a bit to thicken. Try this with real (not that fake overly sweet stuff--sorry Mrs. B.) maple syrup and you will not be disappointed!

3 cups is a 1 pound bag of carrots.  My only change was to use less pepper because I don't like black pepper.  The ingredients look like they  would taste bad with this recipe, but they actually work well together- just the perfect amount of sweet/salty/herby.  The fresh dill makes for an awesome presentation to impress guests.

I used canned carrots, just heated them before adding the other ingredients. I used 1 tsp dried dillweed and that was perfect, and Smart Balance spread instead of butter. All other ingredients were as written. Awesome, easy and will definitely make often.

Delicious carrots!  The sauce makes this amazing aroma as well. The only thing that I did differently was instead of 1 1/2 T of dill, I only used 1 T.  Oh and I steamed my carrots separately to keep all the nutrients, then added it to the saucepan that had the simmering sauce.   It turned out perfect.

Boil quickly until tender. Drain. Add rest of ingredients and heat up quickly to syrupy consistency. I did not add pepper, and went slowly with the dill, as we prefer our carrots sweet.

Yum! I used 1 lb. of baby carrots. I didn't have fresh dill but I did use 3/4 tsp. dried dill that my Mom grew in her garden. I cut way back on the pepper for my kids, just a few pinches. The carrots had excellent flavor! It's a keeper!

Love them! I love dill but would have never have thought to pair it with carrots on my own. I like that the glaze is on the thin side, it is not overwhelming when serving with a savory meal.

I always have to hide veggies in the dishes I cook for my husband so im always looking for sides he will like...he loved these carrots and so did I.I only had canned carrots which worked great bc you skip the boiling step.I also didnt have brown sugar in my pantry so I used honey and maple syrup.it turned out great and the syrups cooked down and really glazed the carrots.thanks for the idea!

I would have given it a 2*, but other people liked it so I'm giving it a 3*. I wasn't a big fan. I did use a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little.

These were pretty good. My husband and I prefer more of a savory vegetable but my kids asked me to put brown sugar on all their veggies for now on. Go figure.

Good, but better as leftovers as they had more flavour then.  I would recommend cutting back on the butter as well.

Had this last night with some fish and a salad. It was awesome!  I steamed the carrots in the microwave, and when almost tender added the other ingredients. It was very simple and worked great!  I will have this again.

It's hard to get my husband to eat vegetables, but he actually told me to make this one again.  He said he was a real fan of the dill.   The sauce was a bit runny, but it still left a nice flavor.

This recipe makes carrots one of my favorite vegetables to eat.  I used to only like "burned" carrots.  My 3 year-old son also likes them this way.  He ate every carrot on his plate.  Thank you.

I always season cooked carrots with butter, dill and salt & pepper.  I didn't add the full amount of brown sugar called for in the recipe and was glad I didn't, because I discovered that I really prefer my carrots savory, not sweet.  Just a personal preference.

Great recipe! Delicious, the dill really compliments the carrots. I used baby carrots, par cooked, and brown sugar instead of maple.

Frankly, when I first tasted these carrots I was a little taken back by the peculiar flavor. After a couple more tastes, though, they grew on me quickly and I and my guests enjoyed them very much. I followed the directions precisely, including slicing whole carrots instead of using baby carrots, except that I was torn on the brown sugar/maple issue, so I used 1 T. brown sugar and 1 T. maple syrup. Well, the maple syrup tasted so good that I ended up adding an extra tablespoon. They really were excellent and I think I'll be making these again. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

My go-to recipe for carrots. Sometimes I just use honey instead of maple, but either way we like the sweetness on top of the carrots. This is easy and delicious!

Steamed carrots.  Good but missing something... used 3/4 T dried dill (looked like a lot but tasted fine).  Would try again but what to add to give a kick?

Yum!  I did like others and drained the boiling water off.  Added a bit of flour with the butter, the sugar, eye-balled salt and pepper.  This was great and I will make again.  Thank you for such a wonderful and easy side dish.

I liked these. I used dried dill (little less than 1/2 tsp) and a little less than a 1/4 tsp of pepper and thought it was enough for 2 lbs of baby carrots - that was using 2 Tbs of br. sugar and 2 Tbs butter, 1/2 tsp of salt, although that could have been cut to 1/4 tsp. I boiled the carrots until they were tender enough for my 1 yr old to eat.

Yum! A great new twist for carrots. They were a hit at a dinner party we had. I found there was too much dill in the recipe though so next time I'll sprinkle it on instead of pouring in 1/5 TBS. Thanks for this recipe Laura! :)

Pretty tasty! I tripled the recipe and used about 9 c worth of baby carrots. Boiling even on high, the carrots were the perfect balance of crunchy-tender way before the water boiled away, so I just drained them. Melted the butter in the pot, added the other ingredients, and then let it get thick before adding the carrots back in.

the best carrots I've ever had. I went a bit liberal with the butter and brown sugar and I think that helped. The recommendation to cook it higher heat was also a  good one.

Awesome, tasty little morsels! I have always done dill with lemon, which is great, or I have done just the brown sugar with butter and salt, which is great.  I have never thought to combine the sweet with the dill, but it is excellent!

Nothing great to us. I'll just have to try again since it got some many rave reviews. I need to taste while I'm making it to see what ingredient amounts need to be changed for our tastes.

The combination of dill and brown sugar was a little scary, but it actually worked out perfectly!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I cranked the heat up after adding the ingredients, in order to make the sauce very thick.  If you do this the sugar/butter combination will thicken up nicely to coat the carrots.  Considering my super picky 6 yr old loved the carrots and ate them all, this is definitely a winner and will definitely be made again.

Not a bad recipe overall. Dill amount needs to be taken down a notch or the amount of carrots needs to be increased. Otherwise, it was a taste addition to the meal.

This is a GREAT dish. I broke the "don't try new recipes on Thanksgiving" rule for this one. We we're lacking on the number of side dishes we had so I picked out a few recipes from my favorite site (allrecipes FTW) and headed to the grocery store. These were super easy to make, not too expensive, and DELICIOUS! They were actually my favorite dish this Thanksgiving. I used regular carrots on a mandolin to make sure they were all the same thickness and simmered until they were tender. There was LOTS of water left but the carrots were done so I went ahead and strained them off. Threw the butter in the warm pan and stirred all the other ingredients in with it. Put the carrots in and mixed it up. Then I couldn't stop eating them. Our short guest list loved them. They were fancy and pretty enough for a nice meal but would work as a side for  near anything. And to think... I thought nothing could top regular old carrots and brown sugar!

I thought this recipe was a bit sweet for me, but my kids, husband and parents loved it.  I substituted Rapadura for the brown sugar, as we can not eat refined sugar.  It was easy to make and tasty.  Thank you for a "keeper" recipe.

Very good! I normally hate cooked carrots but I am trying new things to get my son to eat healthier.  I cheated by draining a can of carrots. Cut the other ingredients in half because the can was 14.5 oz. Took minutes and was delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

These carrots were good but with some changes. I recommend  melting the butter, adding brown sugar and and dill, and cooking the sauce without the carrots until it starts to thicken. I added about a tablespoon or so of real grade A maple syrup to the mix and used some corn starch sprinkled in to thicken the sauce a little further. The store was out of fresh dill so I used dry and it didn't really work to flavor it much -- so use fresh if you've got it. I would add the carrots into the sauce once thickened and toss to coat. These carrots were a nice change of pace, but I just didn't find them to be five star quality. Four stars may actually have even been a tad generous.

These were very good.  I cooked the carrots in the butter and sugar for a long time so they liquid would get syrupy.  The dill adds a nice zing.

This was good. I multiplied it for Easter dinner for twelve.  Maybe too much dill and not enough sugar? It was good, but I would add a bit more sugar next time.

I tried this recipe with my friends once, and now i cant get enough of them. My husband, and friends loves them. These carrots has that semi sweet taste, and are vaey tender. They are perfect as a side dish, with salmon or any fish.

What i do different from the recipe, is that i make this dish with organic baby carrots..

These were very good although I thought 1/2 tsp.was a lot of black pepper for 3 cups of carrots.  Also, I would have liked the sauce thickened as it kind of ran off the carrots.  Otherwise, the flavor was very good. Next time I'll thicken with cornstarch as another viewer sugggested.

Quick & easy - even the kids ate them!  I had no brown sugar, so used maple syrup instead!  Also used dried dill.  Yummmmmmm.  Next time I'll need to double - no leftovers!

I was skeptical about the addition of dill, but these were pretty tasty! I used 1/2tsp of dried dill and swapped out real maple syrup for the brown sugar. Also used baby carrots rather than medallions. Will make again -quick and easy way to dress up a bag of baby carrots for a dinner side dish.

Wonderful as is. Although one could probably get away with 1.5 tablespoons butter or even use whipped or light butter. The first few times I made it I did not have fresh dill, so I used 1 tablespoon dry instead. This one is a household favorite!

Nice flavor, but I followed the recipe exactly yet the carrots did not get a glaze. I, too, wonder why "maple" is in the title but not an ingredient. I would like to try to revise this recipe to create a glaze so that the carrots maintain the flavor.

This is a terrific side dish recipe for anyone who even slightly likes carrots.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except for how long I cooked the carrots. I happen to only have cast iron skillets, so I used a large pot to make this dish. I covered them in water and brought it to a full boil.  I turned of the burner  and let them set for 5 minutes.  The carrots were plenty crunchy but soft enough to eat with a fork.  The glaze was the perfect combination of flavors.

These were so flavorful and my boyfriend loved them.  I added them as a side dish to some Asian Lettuce Wraps I had created and they complimented them beautifully.  This is one of the few times that I have added (light) brown sugar to a recipe and didn't feel guilty eating it.  There is so much flavor going on and they all compliment each other beautifully.  All of the recipes that I make I hand record in my recipe box and add the nutritional values to them and caloriecounter.com rated this as an "A rating" for nutrition so I will most definitely be making this time and time again!  Highly, highly recommended to everyone!

Very tasty... I boiled my carrots and then added the remaining ingredients... the carrots had good flavor but the butter seem to just run off of them.. maybe next time I could cut back on the butter... or next time try using real maple syrup instead of brown sugar... the dill gave the carrotts good flavor...

Fresh Dill flavour was very mild.  Steamed the carrots until very tender, cut the salt in half and skimped a touch on the pepper (very finely ground).   Would definitely prepared again.

I made these tonight and they were a huge success.  I used baby carrots.  I think I will use a little cornstarch as another reviewer suggested to help the sauce stick more to the carrots.  Can't wait to have them again!

I thought these were very good. I didn't care for the dill, though. Next time I make them I'll just leave it out. But very good and very easy!!

I love these carrots!  I doubled the recipe, using about 10 carrots.  I didn't change any ingredients - just the method.  I steamed the carrots, meanwhile I melted the buter brown sugar, etc. in a small sauce pan.  When the carrots were done I put them in a serving dish, poured the butter mixed over them, and then gently tossed everything together.  These were a big hit!

More just sweet than any maple flavour per se.  The dill works will, though.

These are too DIE for! I like to be bad and I double the amount of brown sugar and butter. Fresh dill is a MUST. I just cant imagine the same effect using the dried variety.

VERY very good! By the way... that thing about getting rid of the water... you are supposed to cook the carrots until the water evaporates. If your water evaporates and the carrots are still not tender... guess what? Add more water!! SO... if your glaze is too thin, you have obviously not followed instructions. It comes out perfect as written. Another obvious comment: use less dill if you are using the dry kind.

Quick, simple, easy and delicious! I did (as some reviewers said) empty the water out before adding the butter, brown sugar and spices and added 1tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tsp water at the end  to make the glaze more solid but it was a nice side! :)

I've made this recipe exactly as it says, and I've also changed it up a bit and it always comes out great!  Try adding cubed sweet potatoes to the carrots and subing maple syrup for the brown sugar..I always double the called for spices when doing this!!  Sneaky way for my kids to get other vitamins and they love it!!

Absolutely fabulous!  I didn't add the butter because it didn't need it.  It was delicious without!  The dill really makes this recipe.  I will add butter for special occasions...  Thanksgiving, etc., but it really has an almost buttery flavor already.  My kids GOBBLED it up!!!  This recipe will become a staple for all my holiday meals, not to mention an everyday place in our family recipe box!

Even though i screwed up on the quantities (I made half the amount of carrots and remembered to halve all the other ingredients except! the dill), I'm giving this five stars.  My family gobbled them down - I should have made more!  Didn't change a thing to the recipe (except my accident), and I don't plan to.  It was a great way to use the last of my carrot harvest.  *yea*

Outstanding flavour brought by the dill and butter, but why is it called "maple dill carrots" when there isn't a drop of maple in the recipe??? I find that a bit misleading.

Oh yes people! We have made this recipe as written many times. It's a very easy, great way to get another veggie into the children, inexpensive, and delicious! I've tried it with real maple syrup instead of the brown sugar and... surprise, it's also great. Carrots last a long time in the fridge so they are usually always available to us. There are never any leftovers.

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  I used whole baby carrots for convenience and had to cook them a little longer.  There is a hint of maple flavour, but it is quite suttle.

These were really tasty. I used frozen carrots and dry dill because that's all I had and since my two-year-old was going to be eating them, I cut the pepper in half. The sauce didn't stick, but I wasn't expecting it to, but it gave the carrots a really nice flavor.

These were really good. The dill was more subtle than I thought it would be, and the brown sugar/butter added a nice hint of sweetness. I imagine you could successfully make carrots like this with any herb of your choice.

This is one for the permanent recipe box!  Great flavor and my girlfriend loves them.  She asks for them at least once a week.

we have this produce store where everything is so insanely cheap....so i usually buy a 3lb bag of carrots for $1.25, peel em and slice em for lunches.  More often than not 1/3 of the bag goes to waste.  I looked for a recipe and though I was turned off by the sound of mixing brown sugar and dill I gave it a shot anyway.  I have never enjoyed carrots more in my entire life.  I added a little more BS, a little less Dill and cut the pepper as suggested.  I also added the corstarch.  INCREDIBLE! Went perfectly with the roasted chicken I made! I will make this over and over!!!!!

This was unbelievably good! So easy and I always have these ingredients on hand. My 3 and 1 year old loved it too. Who knew that these ingredients would come together to taste so good? Followed this exactly. Thank you so much!

This was an awesome recipe, which I served with Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes, also from this site, and grilled steak for a dinner with friends last night. To make it really maple tasking I substituted [pure] maple syrup for the brown sugar, and as other reviewers suggested halved the butter and sugar (so maple syrup) called for. I used 1/2 tsp of dried dill weed, only because I didn't have fresh dill This is a definite make again!

Quite delicious, but the amount of dill is way too much. I only put in the 1 tablespoon and it was too much. 1 teaspoon would probably be about right.

Very good, simple recipe. Used dry dill seasoning instead, but apparently used too much (about 1 teaspoon). Next time will try just a touch of dill. Otherwise, terrific.

this would be good except it calls for way way way too much fresh dill. Cut the dill in half and it would be a lot better.

Easy and tastiest glazed carrots I've ever made. I boiled in water until it was cooked to my liking and drained off the water. I used only a tablespoon of butter so it didn't turn out runny like the result of other reviewers. I added an extra tablespoon brown sugar. Also used dried dill and sprinkled as much as I liked.

Super easy, nice flavour with the dill.  I used real Quebec maple syrup in place of the butter/brown sugar.  It was a very good combination with the dill, salt and pepper.

I can't really rave about these, they were fairly good to us, just not great. I would make them again though, and maybe add a bit more sugar or some maple syrup for a bit more sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my, for having a super sweet tooth today this was just what the doctor ordered... I wasn't expecting them to taste this good (not saying the recipe didn't look good, I just wanted to try out my new veggie steamer) but they were AMAZING! Kudos for this one.

These are quick to make and very good.  I cut out the dill the first time I made them only because I didn't have any on hand.  We liked them so much that I never tried them with the dill.

These weren't bad, but we didn't think they were any better than plain boiled carrots with butter on them, so not really worth the extra time & ingredients.

Everyone liked these so much they even had seconds! Neither of my sons have ever liked carrots until they ate these and then they both had seconds. The carrots came out tender, not mushy and overcooked, not crispy. Great flavor, not too sweet. Will definitely make these again and again! It took about 40 minutes to make this dish. Only 20 minutes from the time it started to simmer. As soon as they were done, I added the butter, brown sugar, seasonings and stirred and served. Perfect as written! No, there isn't any "maple" in these, but nevermind the terminology, they are AWESOME!

This was fantastic and easy!! Kids even liked it!! I followed some other reviewers suggestions of cutting the salt in half and I dissolved 1 tsp of corn starch in 1 tsp of water and added to the sauce to thicken it and help it stick to the carrots. The cooking time was more than stated (about 20 minutes total) but worth it!!

I used baby carrots but these seemed to take forever to cook and absorb the water. It didn't have much flavor for me.

I made these for Easter and everyone loved them. I used baby carrots and boiled them first. Then I put them in a skillet and added the rest of the ingredients. They turned out great not one carrot left after dinner! Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Far too much butter, I thought. Also, the recipe doesn't seem to have an ending.  How long do you continue cooking after the last ingredients are added or is that when the carrots are done?  I kept cooking just to try to reducd the butter.  We'll make this again.

This was tasty, my boyfriend was not excited about havinng carrots for dinner, but once he tasted these, he changed his mind.  It did take longer to cook than the recipe stated, maybe because I used baby carrots instead.  Also, I thought the sauce was a little thin.  The flavor was  good, so I will make again.

Wonderful!!! I did use lemon pepper in place of the salt and pepper (salt intake) but left everything else as is. Just wonderful! A very nice change from plain old carrots!

A Complete Hit!  I used a 1/2 T dried dill, just a dash of pepper and margarine instead of butter.  I had to boil the baby carrots about twice as long as the recipe calls for, but well worth the extra time!!!

this recipe rocks.  the hardest part is cutting the carrots.  I added shelled edimame (soybeans) both times I've made it thus far and it rocks as an addition.  I used brown sugar the first time and it was awesome.  I ran out of brown sugar and used maple syrup instead the second time and it was awesome.  This is a new healthy staple in my diet.  Thanx for the recipe

I chopped up seven carrots, and found they were still swimming in glaze.  I will certainly make these again as they were tasty, but I will probably do more than 3 cups of sliced carrots.  I am not a huge dill fan so I used 1/2 tsp or dried dill weed which provided just enough dill flavor to suit my tastes.

I was very skeptical about combining a sweet flavor with the dill, but try it! The title is little deceiving, the sugar merely enhances the natural sweetness of the carrots and is not the prominent flavor !

These were really tasty not really mapley though.  I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried.  I will try fresh next time.  The water I boiled the carrots in also didn't evaporate so I just drained them when they were al dente.  I will be making these again.

Yum!  I was reluctant to make because I do like plain carrots but I am so glad I decided to throw this together.  It was easy and delicious!  I also did not have fresh Dill so I used 1 teaspoon dried.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

So yummy!  My boyfriend requests these all the time! Since I rarely use fresh herbs, I substitute the fresh dill with 1 tsp dried.

A quick and easy way to use up those extra carrots.  Not too sweet, not too dilly.  Excellent recipe.

Well Kinda.. I used baby carrots cut in half. Then I used maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. Now one of our favorites.

Confused why these are called "maple" carrots when it doesn't call for maple. So I subbed brown sugar for real maple syrup and it was delicious. The children loved it too

No changes were  made during this time, I may in the future use not as much dill and butter.  It was  delicious and one I will definitely make again.

I had extra dill I needed to use and I found this recipe. I was a little skeptical of how it would turn out, but it was actually amazing and my 3 year old and 18 month old loves it too so will definitely be making it again!!! I didn’t message how much dill I put it there it was roughly the amount the recipe calls for but next time I’m going to put a little more because the brown sugar took over

Delicious! Growing up, I never cared for cooked carrots and now I usually only ever eat them raw or chopped up in another dish, but my garden has been yielding an abundance of beautiful carrots so I needed to find a delicious way to serve them.  These were perfect! I used pure, organic maple syrup instead of brown sugar and drained the carrots after boiling but those were the only changes I made to the original recipe and suggested by other reviewers.

Lovely.  The dill added an interesting twist (I used dry, out of necessity).  Maybe I’ll try adding a little lemon zest next time...but these were great as is.

4.11.19  I didn’t realize until sitting down now to do a review on dinner last night that although the recipe is titled Maple Dill Carrots, there’s no maple in this.  I steamed the carrots, drained, and then added the other ingredients.  This was OK, but I didn’t think there was much to distinguish it from other candied carrot recipes even with the addition of the dill.  Maybe swapping out  the brown sugar for some maple syrup would have made a difference.

I used baby carrots and steamed them for about 15 min.  I followed the advice of a reviewer and used a good quality maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. Just added that to the melted butter, steamed carrots and other ingredients. Just let the carrot simmer and soak up the maple mixture for a few minutes. Delicious!

Very good recipe for glazed carrots. I use 1 tablespoon honey which was plenty sweet for us. I didn't really taste the dill so will increase that next time. I boiled the carrots, drained, then threw in the butter and seasonings, let it look for a few min to boil away any water so all you are left with is glaze. Will definitely make again!

OMG why am I just now finding this recipe 38 years into my life?!?!?  Guys, this is delicious, easy and versatile! My young boys, 6 and 3, were able to help from start to finish and it went so quick that my 6 month old could entertain herself; yet the feel of this dish is gourmet, not what you’d expect from a 2 ingredient sauce that’s done in 3 minutes. Love, love, love!!!!!!!

Pretty good but I replaced the brown sugar for Maple Syrup and worked really well. Definitely one of my favourite side dish.

I found this very good. I steamed the carrots first, added 1/2 cup raisins during the last 5 minutes of steaming.  I used 1 Tablsp maple syrup, 1 1/2 Tblsp butter and 1 1/2 Tblsp dill weed. Turned out very well.  Will make often.

I make this exactly as the recipe says & it is absolutely delicious!  Even my kids - who I doubted would eat dill - love these carrots.  A favorite in my house.

The dill was an amazing addition!! Also thickened the sauce a bit by mixing 1 tsp. cornstarch into 1 tsp. water and poured into the pan.  Amazing flavor, an permanent addition to family dinners.

This turned out great.  I used maple syrup in stead of brown sugar and dried dill (it's what I had on hand)  I would say use fresh if you have it, fresh dill is amazing.  That being said, it turned out great.  I will totally mke this again!

This is a great recipe and a bit different for carrots.  I'm not wild about carrots, but enjoyed them cooked this way !  I did not have fresh dill, so used dried.
Good for a buffet table.

Personally I loved these because I love dill. My family refused to eat them. Disappointing for me. I made the recipe exactly as written and thought the cooking method was genius. Maybe next time I'll use cinnamon instead of dill but then that's a different recipe.

I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar as others recommended so that it was actually as the title suggested.  Can't say I like the combination of sweetness & dill (regardless of maple or brown sugar).

We have made this recipe twice, once with sliced carrots and once with baby carrots.  Both times it was delightful. The only change I made was to omit the salt.  What a nice way to use up fresh dill.

Loved this. I poured off the water once the carrots were tender, as I would have found the carrots to be a little too cooked if I waited until it evaporated. I didn't have butter on hand, so I used margarine instead, and it still turned out great.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted 2 T of maple syrup and reduced the butter to 1.5 T.  I used heirloom carrots for additional colour, but the purple carrots overwhelmed the other colours. It looked more like beets when done, but still tasted excellent.  The cook time of 10 minutes is way off.  After bringing it to a boil,  it had to simmer for about 40 minutes to evaporate all the water.

Made this tonight. My husband and I enjoyed it, although our son wasn't a big fan. I did find it quite sweet so next time I might halve the sugar and see how that goes. It was easy to make. I adjusted the amounts to suit the 3 of us. I used dried dill. Will certainly give this recipe another go.

Love it!  Normally, I do not like cooked carrots or sweet foods that aren't dessert, but this I really enjoy.  The dill perks it up perfectly--normally, I don't like dill, either.  Yes, these cooked carrots enhanced with dill are delightful even for my picky pallet.  I make them often.

Good!  I don't like adding sugar to my entrees but was making this for Christmas dinner and I wanted to impress. Really don't like maple syrup (I know, I'm completely weird) but used it anyway and am really glad I gave this a try. Guests all liked it and I had no leftovers.

Such a simple but delicious side dish.  Cut up all the baby carrots we had and adjusted seasonings to taste.  It's a regular go to side dish.

These were good. Worth a try, but I didn't find the added ingredients, above simply steaming the carrots, made a huge difference.  I think I cut the carrots a little large, which may have hurt the recipe. Still tasted good and the leftover sauce tasted great.

This recipe is my favorite side dish!!!  Sweet and spicy!!  I can't get enough of them.  I have been told by youngsters that they are "too spicy" so be careful of who you are making them for.  I make them every thanksgiving, and just cut back on the pepper a bit.

Over the top surprisingly delicious!!!  Considering that I'm not a huge fan of dill, except dill pickles, I didn't think I would like this at all......but made it for my husband who loves dill on veggies.  Was I ever surprised at how delightful this recipe was.  I admit to cutting back on dill...just a light sprinkling.   Like others, I was wondering where does "maple" come into this.  But I think that the dill combined with the sweetness sort of makes this a maple-like flavor.  Truly loved it!!

I used a med skillet and used about 3/4 cup of water. I fixed them ahead of time and then put them in the oven with my baked potatoes for about 20 mins to finish them.
 My family loved them.

This was very good.  Substituted real Canadian Maple Syrup for the brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe as I wanted a different take on our usual carrots tossed in butter with parsley.

Mmmmmm Good.  To make it more attractive to kids, I used a wavy cutter for the carrots, and found that it held the syrup much better.  I also used maple syrup seeing that it is so plentiful this time of year.  Can't beat the real thing!

I would definitely make  these glazed carrots again and/or bring it to a potluck or gathering. I took another chef-reviewer's suggestion by adding 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tsp. of water,  and letting it stand  for 10 minutes to thicken (just because I prefer thicker sauces and glazes). I also added 2 tsb. of Smart Balance butter,   3  Tb. of brown sugar, and 1 Tb. of sugar-free maple syrup (with a little bit of fresh dill and salt/pepper).  I had served this   with flounder using a soy sauce/maple syrup glaze (see Maple Salmon recipe for the maple syrup glaze recipe). This glaze is also great for dipping (so be sure to serve it with a loaf of bread).

Great simple recipe. I used 3/4 teaspoon of dried dill in stead of fresh still and used two tablespoons of real maple syrup instead of brown sugar as suggested in the video.  Came out great.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I added extra brown sugar and at the end I put in 1 tsp water mixed with 1 tsp corn starch to thicken the sauce, which helped it stick and thicken. The only reason for 4 stars is because none of my kids would eat it. I guess it is more of an adult taste?

I liked this recipe. I had a 1 lb bag of Bolthouse Farms sliced carrots. I was looking for something to use them in and found this recipe. When I measured the bag it was about 4 cups. I just kept all of the other ingredient amounts the same. If I make them again, I will do the 3 cups listed so there is a little extra glaze. They took about 20 minutes to boil on a temperature of 8 on my stove-top. I still did have to drain some water. I used butter with olive oil blend and about 2 tsp of Penzeys dried dill for the fresh and measured out the rest as is. If I make again, I don't see me peeling and slicing 3 cups but would make it with the pre-peeled and sliced carrots. ty

This turned out nice, but wasn't quite as flavourful as I'd hoped. But it was still very tasty. 

I served it with barbecued sausage, homemade sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. It really complimented the meal.

My 6-year-old would have nothing to do with these, and my husband wasn't fond of them, either. I like cooked carrots, but there was just something about this that didn't work for any of us. Perhaps the dill was just too strong.

This was good, but not great.  It took my carrots a lot longer to cook than the 10 minutes mentioned in the recipe, but it was correct, once the water was done, they carrots were done.  The dill and brown sugar gave it a pleasant taste, but nothing amazing.  Perhaps I was expecting more.  Anyway, just good, not great.

So easy to make and a great flavor to add as a side dish for just about all meats. Was one of my favorite sides at a restaurant I worked at...so happy to have this in my recipe box!

Super easy. I steamed carrots. Next time, try just 1/3 or 1/4 tsp pepper - too overpowering.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to use a bag of baby carrots (that's what I had on hand).  Will definitely be making again!

My family and I LOVE these carrots. The only thing I change is that I don't add the pepper since I don't like pepper, otherwise these are amazing! My husband HATES cooked carrots more than anything in the world, but even he will willingly eat these!

With some minor changes, these were really good. I used baby carrots and only a tablespoon each of margarine and brown sugar, and I increased the dill. So good! My picky bf couldn't get enough of them.

I really liked this one !  Made as written but thought it was a little too much pepper (but thats easy to fix).  So I just added a bit more brown sugar and that helped alot.  Had no fresh dill so used 1/2 tsp. dried.  This one is a keeper !!

Got excellent reviews from my entire family (6 adults, 4 kids) during our monthly family dinner, with the exception of my pre-schooler, but I suspect the pepper made it a tad spicy and he's quite picky.  Overall, tasty and simple.  I couldn't stop picking at it when I brought the leftovers home.

I didn't have any fresh dill so used dried and just reduced the amount by about a third. This was delicious although my boyfriend found it too sweet. Next time, and there will be a next time because this was easy and tasty, I will take one reviewers advice and try to thicken the sauce because I think that would help as well.   Great recipe and so easy to make!!

I used frozen carrots and cooked it to where the brown sugar caramelized a little and added a nice brown crisp on the outside.

I cooked this just as written and the water cooked away just as the carrots reached that perfectly done stage. No need to drain. I added the other ingredients and cooked it down to the right consistency. Delicious and easy! Thanks!

I absolutely love these and I am not usually a carrot person - I accidently left out the salt and pepper but didn't miss them.  I intend to make these again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe - delicious!

Took longer than it said to soften the carrots, but otherwise it was perfect.  My picky 3 year old kept asking for more and my 5 year old gobbled them up! Going in the recipe box.  Thx for a great side dish!!!

Delicious!!  I steamed the carrots and then added them to the other ingredients along with a few spoonfuls of water from the steamer.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used a spoonful of dried and they were so yummy.  Even my 2 1/2 year old daughter ate them up!  Thanks for the recipe!

Carrots to me are pretty boring so this recipe at least made them a little less boring.  I hate frozen carrots.  For a change from all the other veggies we eat, I will make this recipe again for a change.

These are some pretty tasty carrots!  I cooked the carrots until they were tender and then drained the water off.  Otherwise, I didn't make any other changes and they were delicious!

Very good with the eception that the butter/brown sugar coating didn't coat very well. Might try with a thickening agent next time.

Excellent. My wife hates carrots but loved these. If you use dried dill, use about half the amount recommended.

I also used a bag of baby carrots (the whole bag) and cut them length wise in half. I cooked my carrots quite a bit longer than reccomended and I did not have fresh dill on hand. I used 2 tablespoons of dill weed from the panty and it turned out great. I even used the leftovers for Turkey Pot Pie.

Very tasty combo of flavors. Just a tad sweet for me though- I would cut back just a bit on the butter and sugar next time.

I was amazed the dill and sweet went together so well.  My husband loved them.  The children were not home, but I think they would have loved them also.  I did not use 3 cups of carrots since it was just the two of us, but made the same amount of sauce, and I thought it was just right.  I did let them cook in the sauce for a while too.

These were really good, and extremely easy to make.  I think they were slightly too sweet, so I will reduce the amount of sugar next time (and there WILL be a next time!).  Also, I used dry dill, so per suggestions, I put in 3/4 teaspoon of it.  Perfect amount I think.

Oh My Gosh....I really....and I mean REALLY second guessed teh dill with the sugar....I love garlic, cream and dill...the usual...but really hesitated but decided to go for it.  Boy am I ever glad I did.  I first steamed the carrots and then tossed them in the melted butter brown sugar and dried dill (didn't have fresh)...and it was so so good.  Loved it.  It is barely finised and the kids haven't tasted it...can't wait until they do and will post an update.  Thanks

I make this often.  SO easy and super yummy - you can cook the carrots as much as you'd like - if you like them a little crisp or soft - a perfect side for any meat and potatoes type dinner.

I tried adapting this for the microwave: reduced serving size to 2. Submerged carrots in water and nuked for 3min. In separate bowl did sauce ingredients for 10 seconds, three times with plenty of mixing in between. Drained carrots and combined with sauce. More mixing. Sauce was still pretty liquidy, and I accidently over did the salt, and took other's advice and under-did the pepper. Inspite of all the changes it was still pretty good. I'll have to try it again some time and do it the traditional way.

My hubby, who told me he hates glazed carrots LOVED these.  My 3-year old ate some, and he's not big on carrots, and my 13-month old shoveled them in so fast I thought he was going to choke!  YUM YUM YUM...The best part is that they're made with ingredients I always have on hand.  I'm definitely making these again!

I was surprised at how easy this recipe was and how quick it was to prepare.  All of the flavors go together perfectly.  Who would have thought dill and maple went together so perfectly?  The carrots melt in your mouth.  Perfect for when you have a bag of leftover carrots sitting in the bottom of your fridge!

I was skeptical about the dill, but decided to try it given the rave reviews. I would have to agree, it was GREAT! My 3 year old even asked for seconds. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for an awesome new way to make carrots. I love it!

I am not a huge Carrot fan.  Somebody in the family gave us A LOT of carrots, so I have been trying to use them up.  This is SOO fabulous! I am going to start buying carrots just to make this now and then!

I was a little unsure about the dill - but it complimented the flavor wonderfully.  I probably did not put in the entire amount suggested, though.

These carrots tasted amazing and I am normally not a huge carrot fan!  I steamed the carrots in a pot with a steamer and cooked the sauce separately until it was thickened.  I used 1/2 tsp dried dill because that was all I had.  I mixed the cooled sauce over the carrots and it had the most wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this again.

These were very good - I used dried dill as that's all that I had on hand, and reduced the amount a bit due to personal preferences.  I also had some glaze leftover in the pan, but did not pour it over the carrots - that was the right choice, as they were sweet enough with just a touch of the glaze.  I almost passed this one up as I was actually looking for one that used maple syrup, but to be perfectly honest, every now and then I did taste a teeny bit of maple flavor in the brown sugar/butter glaze! Maybe it was just wishful thinking, but at any rate, I did enjoy these.

I used fresh dill from my herb garden out back. These came out great. I didn't let all of the water evaporate. I was worried the carrots would get overcooked. Will most likely make again. Yum!

I did NOT like this. Maybe it was the brown sugar/dill combination, I'm not sure. It just was not appetizing to me. My mom liked this, however, so maybe that's why others do too. Thanks anyway.

These carrots are seriously the best vegetable dish I have ever made! Very easy and the end result is delicious so I have been making them a lot. The past couple of times I have cut down on the butter and brown sugar to lessen the fat and calorie content and they are still amazing.

OMG SO GOOD! I cooked it a little over until the bottom caramelized (to get more flavour), then added added a splash of water to mix the caramization together. I served this with brown rice, tilapia, then on top of that I drizzled the left over butter sauce. very good will make again soon

I really enjoyed these. They have just the right amount of sweetness.  I followed some suggestions by other reviewers and cooked the sauce for a few minutes until the sauce got thick.  I'll be making these again.

Been looking for a good carrot recipe and I finally found it. This is easy and my 2 year old loved it!  I made sure to let the water simmer all the way before adding the butter and sugar while still on the heat.  Turned out perfect.

These carrots were delicious! I had my parents over for dinner the other night, & I wanted to try a new side dish. I love carrots, but for some reason I never think to make them. But now that I have this recipe, I'll make them regularly! My parents, my husband, my brother & I all loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for Thanksgiving Dinner,and they went really nicely with the meal,the maple flavour was subtle,but enough that everyone commented on it.They weren't too "saucy" either,just a light coating to jazz up the carrots a bit!Nice recipe.

I think these were great. I used 1/2 bag of baby carrots and cut the rest of the ingredients in half to serve two people. Although, I did not have fresh dill so I used about 1/2 ts of dried.

Delicious!  5 Stars.  I followed the recipe and the advice of some others to cut down on the pepper and I used dried dill.  I also heated the butter/sugar mixture on med-high to thicken it and help it to "glaze" the carrots.  We will definitely make this again - maybe for Thanksgiving.

Awesome recipe, just what I was looking for.  Far better than the other recipe I tried on here that used lemon juice.  I used freeze dried dill and boiled the carrots and strained them instead of boiling them down. I used to make my carrots by adding a little sugar to the water I boiled them in to make them sweet - I think this way is MUCH better!  Also, coming from a fellow Canadian, perhaps she called this Maple Carrots because we have the maple leaf on our flag, and she is from BC?  Just a thought :)  This is my new carrot recipe from now on, thanks so much!

I had to prepare Thanksgiving for my husband's entire family who had never had a traditional Thanksgiving meal before (we're living in Central America, where he is from).  I wanted to serve something besides just plain veggies.  I honestly was a little nervous about preparing this, thinking it would be too different for their tastes, but everyone loved the carrots!  I was rushing around like crazy and this was one of the last dishes I prepared.  I ended up only eyeballing the ingredients, and they still turned out fantastic!  Like other reviews, I am not sure why they are called maple, but they still taste great!

Not sure what to say about this one... Granted my carrots didn't cook quite long enough so they were a bit firm, but I didn't think the flavor was good at all. For sure the dish was edible. And my boyfriend liked it. But it wasn't really anything that special. It looked much better than it tasted which I always find disappointing.

Doubled the recipe and it came out great.  I don't recommend it for pot lucks because people shy from carrots in general.  Two people who did try the carrots asked me for the recipe.

Yum!  These were great.  Next time I will make more (our family of 3 almost ate all of it).  For casual dining, I will use a little less butter.

I have to say, I remember growing up and hating carrots that were cooked.  But I made pork chops the other night, and decided to try these as a side.  Wow.  That's all I can say.  These carrots are awesome.  And they're so easy to make (I just added all the ingredients to taste); I have a feeling this will soon become a staple side dish in our home.

My husband raved about these carrots, and I have to agree - they are wonderful!  I disagree with those who said you need to cook the carrots first; they came out perfect for us just as directed.  We had with ham steaks and mashed garlic red potatoes.  Fantastic!

So easy and tasty.  I actually pre-ccoked the baby carrots the night before and heated the whole mixture right before serving.  I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar as suggested in a previous review.

I loved these. Simple, few ingredients which I had on hand. (I used dry dill, and it was great.) I also just boiled carrots till done, then drained and mixed in butter/sugar/dill mixture. Yum!

Excellent and unique flavor! My mom hates carrots, but loved this dish when she was over for dinner. Carrots take longer to cook than suggested here. I simply boiled them until done rather than waiting for the water to evaporate, etc.

It was a tad deceiving though b/c it's called 'maple' dill carrots, but there's no maple (syrup, whatever) in the recipe.

This was an intriguing blend of flavors. I used frozen baby carrots which worked fine, but I found it a bit spicy - I may have been too heavy handed with them. I'll probably try again.
Update: I tried it again, and this time was more disappointed in it. The blend of flavors didn't work well together.

Great recipie--I tried the "Honey Ginger Carrots" a few weeks ago, and they were WAY too sweet.  These were just right, and the dill is a nice addition to the candied carrots.  We LOVE them!

These were so very delicious.  One of my guests that I fed claimed to have never liked cooked carrots until this particular dish.
I used the frozen tubes of dill instead of fresh cut dill.  It tastes the same, but is easier and faster to use.

These were great! I used the small skinned carrots, all the water absorbed like it should, and the kids actually ate a vegetable. Thanks for recipe!

quick and easy, even my spice-hating family approved!  I made it early on Christmas day and reheated later with a meal of Malaysian roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus.  Yum.
