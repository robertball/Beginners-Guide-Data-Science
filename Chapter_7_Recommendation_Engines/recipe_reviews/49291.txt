Easy to make. Make sure you use spinach or tri-color bowties, because the regular color of pasta gives the whole meal a beige tint. I ended up cooking the tofu for almost a half an hour before I was satisfied with how done it was; it doesn't take long to actually cook the tofu, but I like it crispy. Also, I added a couple of teaspoons of rice-vinegar to the sauce, because I thought it was a bit too sweet, and that gave it a slightly tangy taste. Overall, it was a big hit with vegetarians and carnivores alike at a dinner party.

Very good recipe.  It's 4.5 stars.  I oddly had all these ingredients laying around and needed to use them up.  I hadn't used my Old Bay in a long time!  I accidentally doubled the Old Bay and nutritional yeast while trying to halve the recipe, and it was great.  I also added greens, onions and garlic, and used plain colored corkscrew pasta.  I mixed the pasta with the tofu mix, and added back some pasta cooking water to make all the goodies stick to the pasta.  Yumm!

We've made this twice and love it.  The sweetness of the corn and the honey are a nice contrast to the spiciness of the Old Bay (or the cajun seasoning we tried, too, for extra spice).  It's easy, pretty, and very tasty.  We made it with frozen corn and spinach linguine, both of which worked fine.

I left off the bay, and added extra honey.  The kids gobbled up the tofu (more chicken, mommy!) when they've never had tofu before.  The only thing is, it needs more topping to pasta ratio.  We had too much pasta and not enough topping.

This is a good and easy recipe which is why I gave it 5 stars.  For my personal taste, however, it was a little too spicy and I guess I don't like the consistency of tofu much yet.

This was the first thing I've ever cooked using tofu so I didn't know what to expect, but it was great!  Not having a "tofu crispiness" preference, I cooked it for the amount of time stated in the recipe.  Instead of serving over the pasta, I put the drained pasta into the pan and mixed it all together.  The soft-but-cooked tofu gave it just enough liquid to make it a little creamy.  My kids kept marveling at how soft the "chicken" was!  We found it a bit spicy; next time I'll reduce the amount of old bay.  But otherwise it was great.

This recipe is a wonderful to take advantage of corn when it is in season.  I often add a can of diced tomatoes for some additional color.

It's OK.  It's not bad, it's just not the type of thing I flip over.  Maybe since I've been eating tofu for years and it's not the first time I've had it I'm not as blown away as other people are.  The flavor's good, but for my husband and I, it just wasn't special.  I think I'd make it again if I wanted some tofu but had exhausted all of my favorite recipes.

Seems like the tofu is imitating crab in this dish, which it does fairly well.  Very tasty.
