WOW!!!  Follow the instruction and hand-stir the boiling water VERY thoroughly.  You will end up with a somewhat soupy, but uniform, batter.  I had no problem, as some did.  I used two 9" pans, but only filled them 2/3 of the way and had some batter left, which I tossed out.  (I was afraid of overflowing the pans.)  This batter cooked up high and perfect!  To avoid problems de-panning it: make sure you use the toothpick test and also touch the top to make sure it springs back.  If you take it out too soon, you'll have a wet mess.  And follow the instructions and let it sit AT LEAST 10 minutes before de-panning it.  The frosting was an amazing consistency!  Creamy and easy to work with.  Add a little extra milk if it is not creamy enough and alternate the milk/cocoa/sugar as recommended.  I measured the 10X sugar per the recipe, but then added it a little at a time "to taste."  I ended up with about a half cup of 10X left.  If you split the layers, you will have sufficient frosting.  I did not split the layers and had a ton leftover.  This cake was UNBELIEVABLE.  Moist, dense cake - not too sweet - and creamy delicious frosting.  I made it the day before a party and covered it tightly and it was perfect the next day.  Better than bakery cake.  Better than any chocolate cake I have ever had!!!  My guests' eyes were rolling back into their heads, this cake was THAT good.  This doesn't get 5 stars, it gets 10!!

I made one change based on an old tradition that was passed on to me; instead of using boiling water I used freshly brewed hot coffee.  The cake was the best thing I have tasted and it stayed fresh and moist in a cake keeper for a full week.  I used a silicone bundt pan rather than round pans.

This cake is so moist and dense!  It was a great tasting cake, and practically foolproof. Don't worry about the thin consistency of the batter.  This is made more like a pudding (lava) cake, and it WILL bake into a normally textured cake, just especially moist.  Instead of 9 in. pans, I used a 13x9 and baked it for 45 minutes, and that worked beautifully, too.

READ BEFORE MAKING:  I followed the recipe accordingly.  It smelled great, looked great, etc.  However, when you take the cakes from the oven, DO NOT remove them from the pan after 10 minutes.  This recipe is a little misleading.  After 10 minutes, I tried to shake the cakes from their pans and they broke all over.  I would wait at LEAST 20 minutes before removing because the cake is very soft and moist, it needs time to cool and get firm.

This recipe is nearly identical to a recipe I have been using for 20 years. The only difference is that my recipe calls for 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of piping hot coffee in place of the milk and boiling water. This time, I tried it with the milk and hot coffee, and I loved the result. There are 2 tricks to getting the layers out of the pan intact. The first is to use the right kind of pan. I use extra-heavy Wilton 9" round cake pans. They have slightly higher sides than conventional cake pans and they are made of pale aluminum with a dull finish. This helps the cake cook evenly, but it also ensures that the cake develops a crust flexible enough to withstand turning the cake out onto the cooling racks. The second trick is to grease the pan heavily and then flour it. A light wipe with a greasy paper towel might make the flour stick, but it won't be enough to keep the cake from sticking to the pan. I lied. There is a third trick. Turn the cake out onto a cooling rack precisely 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven. That gives the cake time to firm up a bit, but not enough time for the shortening you used to grease the pan to adhere to the cake. And yes, the recipe yields a soupy batter. It's supposed to be that way. Don't use a springform pan. If your cake overflows the pan, you are probably using dutch process cocoa instead of regular unsweetened cocoa powder or a premium cocoa. Don't. You need the acidity of Hershey's regular to offset all that baking soda.

this recipe is excellent! I bake alot and this is the BEST chocolate cake recipe i have ever tried! Instead of butter icing, try a chocolate glaze over the cake just before its completely cool so the glaze soaks in YUM! Glaze: 1 cup sifted icing sugar
2 tablespoons cocoa
2 tablespoons milk
½ teaspoon vanilla

This cake has become my "go to" dessert and is now referred to by my family and friends as "the cake." I took "the cake" to a function where there were 10 different desserts and it was the talk of the evening.  The secret is to bake and frost this cake one day ahead of time. It's good/great the first day, but unbelievable the second day. I have also substituted part or all the regular unsweetened chocolate with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder when I make it for dark chocolate lovers. Hint: do NOT grease the sides of the pan so that your cake can "climb" up the sides. Your cake will bake level without puffing in the middle and you wont have to cut off the hump to level it. Just run a very sharp knife around the outside of the pan when fully baked and cooled for 15-20 minutes and remove it. This method gives you more crumbs on the sides, but a much nicer shaped cake. You can control the crumbs when you frost  by "dirty icing" the cake. To dirty ice, split the layers horizontally and place back together with icing in between each layer. Then, frost the whole cake with a very thin layer of icing  to "cement" the crumbs. Wait a few minutes for the dirty icing layer to harden slightly, then frost the cake.

Wow,very tasty! I LOVE the frosting!!!  I use the frosting on my home made ice cream cakes since it is so thick and holds up very well! I have also made this recipe into an ice cream cake and it worked wonderfully. Just remember not to overbake it. For an ice cream cake, pour batter into 2 identical springform pans. Bake as directed, coolcompletely, then slice in half horizontally so you have 4 cake layers. Then place the bottomlayer back in the springform pan, top with softened ice cream, anotherlayer ofcake, more ice cream, another cake, more ice cream, then cake! Takes about a half gallon of ice cream. Freeze completely, prob overnight, open sides of pan. Then I ice a thin layer, put back in freezer for an hour or so, then frostcake as usual! Store in freezer until right before serving! It's been a hit several times over!

Hi, I just made this cake and was also concerned about how very thin the batter was after adding the hot water but it turned out great the cake was very moist but(warning) be sure to put your cakes in the oven on a cookie sheet in case they boil over I did not and one boiled over a bit and I had a lovely mess to clean up :(  I also made the the frosting and it turned out great as well the whole family enjoyed this cake.. :)  
Thanks for a nice recipe :)

This is a deep, dark, moist, light, fluffy EXTREME chocolate cake. It is a good, sturdy, reliable recipe as well because even with my playing with the science of it by using Dutch process cocoa, substituting buttermilk for the milk and hot coffee for the water it turned out beautiful and delicious. I chose to make my own chocolate frosting, however, as the recipe included here seemed heavier on the cocoa powder than I wanted. I essentially went lighter on the cocoa powder and a little heavier on both the butter and the powdered sugar.  I baked this as cupcakes, baking them about 20 minutes.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had! I wont use another recipe for chocolate cake ever again and I wont by boxed batter again either. This cake was easy to make and came out perfect with no special effort. The frosting was excellent but I used cream instead of milk. My husband and I couldnt stop eating it... my only complaint would be that its additcting!!!

Okay, so I halved both recipes and made this cake and the Dark Chocolate Cake I in the same day so that I could better compare them. I, like many others, used hot coffee in place of boiling water to amplify the chocolate flavor. Both cakes have good qualities. If you are looking for a cake that is rich, moist, and almost fudgy, go with the Extreme Chocolate Cake. If you prefer cakes that are soft, fluffy, and not as chocolatey or sweet, then the recipe for Dark Chocolate Cake I is for you. I personally liked the Extreme Chocolate Cake better but my boyfriend preferred the Dark Chocolate Cake I hands down. I think I will try to experiment with the two recipes to come up with one that balances the flavor of the Extreme Chocolate Cake with the wonderful texture and stackability of the Dark Chocolate Cake I. Thanks for the recipe Rach56!

I decorate cakes so I am always on the hunt for good cake recipes.  This one is FABULOUS!!  Easily the best chocolate cake I have ever had, let alone made.  Even my husband said that it was "chocolate lovin' on a fork". I did add a vanilla custard filling between the layers.  But really, it would be great without it.  Note:  The only issue I had with this recipe is that the (very runny) batter overflowed during baking.  What was left in the pan (~90%), was great!

Very easy recipe! I loved the lightness of the cake and it wasn't overly sweet. My layers came out uneven, as the centers of my cakes rose higher than the edges! I might not bother splitting the layers next time as it made my cake look really funny, more like a dome! The frosting is rich and a little too chocolatey and sweet for me..I would reduce the amount of sugar or try a different frosting recipe. Overall, it's a nice basic recipe to satisfy your sweet tooth.

This cake was really yummy. It was the kind of cake you need a glass of milk with. A few pepole said it was the best cake they ever had. The twelve servings were a little small, next time I will make a thrid layer.

Moist chocolate cake indeed. Nice rich flavor. The batter is thin but do not fret. This recipe made 26 cupcakes for me. Used  1/4 cup of veggie oil and 1/4 cup of Kahlua. Substituted one strong cup of brewed coffee for the water. (even if you despise coffee I highly recommend swapping it out for the water, you can not taste or smell coffee in the cake it only enhances the chocolate flavor) The paper liners came off beautifully. The cake is moist and flavorful. Very nice cake.

Fantastic!  I had been looking for a nice basic chocolate layer cake.  This one has a great texture and nice, rich chocolate taste.  Most people can probably get away with only 1/2 of the frosting recipe.  I like only a thin layer of frosting on my cake so I used 1/4 recipe and it was plenty for a 9x13 cake.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten and I've tried many, many other recipes!  It's wonderfully moist and the perfect balance of deep chocolate flavor and sweetness, and has a perfect texture, not too light, but not dense.  The batter is very thin.  I've not had a problem with the entire amount of batter overflowing in 9"x 1 1/2" pans.    Also, make sure that you grease and flour the pans well and you should not have problems with the cakes sticking.  I've never had a white coating from the flour on the outside of the cake either.   I do substitute hot fresh coffee (even instant on occasion) for the boiling water (it enhances the chocolate flavor, you don't taste any coffee) and I melt a stick of butter to use instead of using the oil.  Perfect, every time!   You must try this cake!

This is a great recipe.  I made 24 cupcakes.  I pour the very thin batter into a large measuring cup and poured the batter into the cupcake liners. They baked for 22 minutes, they were moist and tender.  I didn't make the frosting - but made vanilla buttercream frosting.  Excellent and very easy.**** Update - these were inhaled!  Everybody absolutely loved them.  :)

I've made this recipe 2 times now, both for kids' birthday parties. It was moist, dense and chocolatey. If you are looking for a light and airy cake, this is not your recipe. 

The first time I baked it on a 9*13 pan. I used baking strips on the pan so it would raise evenly. The baked cake shrunk to 1" after cooling,and I had to make another batch to have a decent height on the cake. I frosted using white buttercream and it was a pain to crumb coat and decorate. Needed a lot more frosting to avoid crumbs. The cake sucked in all the whipped cream filling.  

Attempt #2 :2 9"pans. Again,bake even strips. It didn't shrink as much and raised to a good decorating size. I left in on the counter for cooling and forgot about it for 2-3 hrs and the cake dried out a bit. Next time after cooling I will wrap it in waxpaper&foil until ready for frosting. This time I decorated with the chocolate frosting - delicious. Used creamcheese filling, sucked in again! Lessons learnt: bake in 9 inch pans, wrap promptly for freshness and stick to chocolate frosting for the filling.

I was extremely disapointed with this cake.  The boiling water ruined the whole cake, and it didn't come out.  Don't waste your ingredients with this one.

Well I can't even imagine what I did wrong with this one, but for nothing could I get this cake to rise like the pictures of other people's wonderful looking cakes. Thinking maybe I'd just missed the right amount of baking soda/powder somehow in the first batch, I decided to have a second go (it was due to be the centrepiece of our Easter table this year after all), but to no avail. Still REALLY flat. I have four layers now - but only because I've baked four cakes. I've been baking for years and using allrecipes for a large number of those years and I've never had this problem. Really disappointed. Will update review once we've tried it tomorrow with the buttercream (hopefully that goes better - but then I didn't think I could mess up a cake either!). Oh dear.

UPDATE: Well I've long since given up on trying to get this cake to rise, but it's now one of my standby's for all chocolate cake occasions. I've just learnt to expect a short cake, and bulk it up with frosting - such a shame ;P. Definitely the tastiest chocolate cake around, no matter the height:).

The taste was excellent. I had a little problem with overflow even though my cake pan was 2/3 full. The frosting was good and very rich. I loved the way it hardened up allowing me to decorate using ribbons and chocolate roses. I'm giving this 4 stars because I wasn't thrilled with my cake texture. I love fluffy moist cakes. This one however was a tad moist for me (more like a brownie but still cake like) and just a tad too dense. Needs some extra cooling time in the pan before depanning. Give it a 10 minute minimum for cooling before attempting to remove. Very good - I've had several people request this cake. I sometimes change out the vanilla for chocolate extract and the water for hot coffee. Plenty of icing left so be sure to split layers or use as a crumb coating first. Those who had a problem with the frosting: take your icing knife and dip it in hot water, let the excess water drip off for a second and proceed to spread. Repeat process every time your knife cools or you hit a "hard patch".

I had major difficulty removing the cake from the pan, after greasing and flouring because I decorate my cakes. I found this cake VERY hard to work with.  I thought it had more of a bread taste than a cake flavor, it wasn't quite sweet enough either.

I had a craving for chocolate cake, but hadn't been to the grocery store in a couple weeks and the pantry was down to bare bones.  I didn't have the ingredients to make the chocolate cake that I usually make, so I found this recipe online and tried it.  It was delicious!  Exactly what I wanted.  I added some mini chocolate chips on top for texture and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I used dark chocolate cocoa powder so the color of my cake was very dark, but I prefer dark chocolate so to me it was perfect!

This is the best chocolate cake ever, it is exactly the same recipe as the Perfectly Chocolate cake on the Hershey's Cocoa box. I usually don't make the butter cream frosting, but instead fill with a ganache, and frost with chocolate cream cheese frosting. I then drip ganache down the sides, and pipe a lattice work of hot fudge from the jar on the top and for the borders. AWESOME! Probably the most requested dessert I make.

I have made this cake for years, and it is Perfect! I never buy boxed chocolate cakes mixes, haven't since I first made this cake.
My only changes are, I use hot coffee in place of the water and Kahlua in place of the vanilla in both the cake and the frosting. Best Chocolate Cake Ever!

This recipe does yield a VERY VERY MOIST cake! And the cake is perfect for making layer cakes; which I made for a graduation party last week. I did lessen the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.Use a very good quality cocoa powder for best results because the cocoa powder you use really does determine how chocolaty this cake will become.My favorite recipe for a super moist cake and I will definitely make more of this in the future! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful wonderful cake! I made this for my boyfriend for valentines day to steer away from box cakes, and he was very impressed. We both love to cook and critique what we make, and he had nothing bad to say. It was moist and rich and not too sweet, perfect! It is very true the batter is VERY thin, but baked up perfectly. One trick I picked up years ago was dusting the pans with cocoa powder instead of flour when making a chocolate cake. It is prettier and really yummy :)

I was so disappointed--I double-checked to make sure that I put everything in, and followed the recipe exactly.  The batter was much thinner than other cakes, and it must have combined with the grease on the pan because it stuck worse than I've EVER had a cake stick before--and I bake a lot.  Boo hoo--I thought with 4 1/2 stars and 542 reviews I couldn't go wrong...

For people who are having "overflowing" problems - make sure your cake tins are really 9- inch, as the recipe suggests. I had some tins that I thought were 9", but when I measured them they were smaller. I got some tins that were definitely 9", and the cake batter only comes up a little less than halfway. When cooked they are not even close to overflowing - they are perfect. 

This is without a doubt the best chocolate cake ever. I actually do the chocolate curls on top, and the cake is impressive indeed. It always gets a gasp or two. And it tastes completely divine. 

It also improves with age. Make it one day and serve it the next. Perfect.

Instead of two cups of sugar, I substituted 1 cup organic sugar and 1 cup Xylitol (look it up, it's better for you than sugar and tastes essentially the same).  I didn't realize I didn't have AP flour, so I had to use bread flour.  No big deal, because it's cake, so it rose up better and no one is allergic to gluten here.  I took someone's advice about the coffee trick and used freshly brewed coffee instead of just plain hot water.  Used raw milk instead of store milk, so it had all the yummy cream at top to use in the cake.  Used olive oil instead of veggie oil, but next time, I'll just add Virgin Coconut Oil when pouring in the hot coffee (VCO will solidify with colder temperatures and melts at higher...VCO is very good for you and a very stable oil at high temps).  So with those changes, it made for a very delicious cake/icing.  :)

Very good cake - makes a huge cake though. I used 4, 8 in round pans to keep any overflow from happening.  Only change I made was to use brewed coffee in place of the water.  Really good!

I'm just rating the sponge here as I made a different frosting I already love. I always get a little bit worried when I make a new cake but with this I needen't have worried! I even cooked it all in one pan and it worked wonderfully. A delicious and moist cake. I made it for a special event and EVERYONE was raving about it.. one kid told me 'THIS is the cake you can make me on my next birthday!' haa!

Reading the reviews, I thought that this cake would be a great choice for a family dessert.  The batter was very runny, but I looked past this, since a lot of other reviews stated the same.  However, I kept having to add more time to the timer (30 minutes before I gave up).  Maybe it has to do with the high elevation where I live (4660 ft), and the recipe was not intended for high altitudes.  I will keep looking for a good chocolate cake recipe from scratch.

This is one of the best chocolate cake I've ever baked!!! It was wonderfully moist and rich in chocolate flavor! I added a cup of choc chips and it took the cake to a completely next level. We could not wait for it to cool! And the icing was perfect!

My 8 year old daughter wanted to make a cake for her daddy. She picked out this recipe...it turned out wonderful! She used sugar in the raw, rather than white sugar, special dark baking cocoa & canola oil. Also added just a bit of instant coffee. She baked the cake in a bundt pan. The cake turned out beautifully!! Her daddy loves a custard like sauce on top of chocolate cake, so she made that, rather than the icing listed. We will certainly make this cake again! Thanks for sharing!

I have been using this cake recipe for years and it is the best chocolate cake ever!  The flavor is rich chocolate without being too sweet but very moist.  I often use hot coffee in place of the water which adds to the richness.  I made 24 cupcakes but used a different frosting this time.  The changes I made were for HIGH ALTITUDE:  Decrease sugar to 1 3/4 cups; increase flour to 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons; decrease baking powder to 1 1/4 teaspoons; decrease baking soda to 1 1/4 teaspoons; increase milk  to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons. Hope this helps.  :-)

This was my first time making a cake and frosting from scratch, and let me say I will never buy cake mix in a box or frosting again because this Momma can bake her own!!
I couldn't find 9" pans so I used three 8" pans. I did NOT cut the layers after baking. I did however use coffee instead of the water. I used the donut shop coffee I use for my Keurig. At first tasting the frosting, I thought I had used to much sugar but we didn't eat the cake until the next day and it tasted just perfect. I shaved half a hershey's candy bar on top, pressed mini hershey kisses on the sides, and then place mini reese's peanut butter cup along the top edge of the cake (see my pic). I love this recipe! Try it, I don't think you will regret it! :)

AMAZING.  This is literally the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever tasted, without any changes to the recipe at all.  The only issue I had was not with taste, but with the fact that I stuck like heck, despite the fact that I had greased and floured the pan, and because the cake was so moist and a little fluffy, it fell apart when I tried to take it out. Next attempt using parchment paper rounds on the bottom came out MUCH better-no sticking and the cake came out beautifully!

I followed the directions exactly and it did not turn out! It was more like a fudge brownie consistency and very heavy when done. Very disappointed. I was really wanting some chocolate cake. I will not try to make again.

I made this with coffee instead of boiling water. OMG this is amazing! Everyone loved it! I got just about 4 dozen cupcakes out of one batch. I stuffed them with a strawberry puree and topped them with a whip cream frosting....DELICIOUS! - UPDATE - I made this again, using the boiling water and this time I made the frosting. The cake was still delicious! I ran out of vanilla extract for the frosting, so I didn't use it. I used the full amount of butter, only around 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1/2 cup of coco, and a couple tablespoons of milk. This whips up so light and airy! I added the sugar and coco to taste, and only enough milk to make it creamy. I have made this cake/frosting twice now, and each time I got rave reviews! My boss even said he hoped he didn't lose me to a bake off! :) This is my "go-to" chocolate cake. LOVE it!!

The cake tastes great, but I definitely will use a different recipe for the icing.  All that cocoa makes it taste gritty and I didn't care for it at all.  Made this cake with raspberry filling ... yum!

After this horrible recipe caused me so much trouble this morning, I have to go out and buy a cake mix.  My son's birthday cake is ruined!  Cake batter cannot be this runny, it drips out of the springform pan all over the bottom of the oven.

This was VERY delicious and moist...I will probably make this again.  The frosting really melts away in your mouth!

This is an amazing cake!  The cake itself is easy,and comes out light and extremely moist.  I was very surprised at the texture for a cocoa based cake.  The frosting is a bit more complex.  If I hadn't had my kitchenaid, I would have been lost.  I suggest using the whipping attachment to make the frosting, and really whip it up prior to adding the boiling water and then mixing by hand.  Gets my vote for a great "Death by Chocolate" cake!

I was utterly dissapointed when I realzied this cake is the exact same recipe listed on the back of the hershey cocoa container.  I would not have made this cake had I known that as I have made it a few times with just okay results.  The cake tasted good, but I had an issue with it sinking a bit in the middle. I did forget to stir in the water and just added into the mixer so it could have been a result of my mistake.  Either way I was dissapointed after reading all of the 5 star reviews.  Will continue seaching for a great chocolate cake recipie.

I was extremely under-impressed with this recipe. When I think of a scratch-made chocolate cake, this is severely under par. The smell is heavenly but the taste is just like a box of devil's food cake that you can get at any grocery store and the icing is waaaaay too sweet. I will not be making this cake again.

I was very pleased with this cake.  Although I will admit that towards the end I didn't want to add the cup of boiling water.  I was pleased with the consistency of the cake at this point.  I went ahead and added the water and hand stirred it in.  It created a "soupy" mixture and I was indeed really unsure.  Went ahead and baked the cakes and let me just say...the end result is Fantastic!  The cake is very moist and easy to make.  

Definately a recipe keeper for me!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it completely fell apart.  The first one I couldn't even get out of the pan at all.  The second one, I got most of it out, but even the part that came out was crumbly and just a mess.  I'm sorry, this is the first time I have made a comment on this site, but I felt I had to

This is just as easy as using a box mix and tastes so much better! I did make just a couple alterations. I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. I dissolved 1 tsp. of instant espresso in the boiling water. I added 1 tsp. of kosher salt to the frosting. The frosting is really dark in flavor so if you prefer it to be less intense, just don't add as much cocoa. Also use a sifter if your cocoa is dry and lumpy- I didn't do this and I had little tiny pieces of cocoa all throughout the frosting. Great recipe, thanks Rach56!

The batter is really runny but this makes the moistest chocolate cake I have eaten in a long time.  So good!!  One recipe was enough for 12 cupcakes and a 9X9 cake, although I halved the frosting and it was still too much.  This is my daughter's new favorite cake.  I will make this again and again!

Dee-liscious!!  I made this recipe from a Hershey cookbook nearly 20 yrs. ago.  The only difference was the amt. of flour.  The old recipe only called for 1 1/4 cups flour.  Yes, the batter was even more runny and I remember thinking, whats up with the runny batter.  But it bakes up perfectly.  The only pointer I might give is dividing the batter into three to four pans as opposed to splitting two layers.  I have more success with that method and it's less work.  I do prefer three layers to four when I make this.  I ususally fill and frost sides with a chocolate mouse frosting with shaved chocolate betweeen layers and a ganach on the very top only, drizzing down the sides somewhat, whith a little fresh whipped cream to decorate.

Ohh my goodness, this is sooo good. I followed the directions with a few small changes. I upped the flour to 2 cups, increased the cocoa powder to 1 cup and used fresh coffee for the water. I ended up with 3 layers of cake. I frosted mine with Coconut Pecan Icing and Milk Chocolate Icing. Very good, will definitely make again!!!

This cake was great! Everyone loved it, and it was super moist! The cake was great, but the frosting was even better. For the frosting 5 cups of sugar seemed like a lot to me, so I cut it down to about 3 1/2 cups, and the frosting was delicious. I had to add  about a 1/3 cup extra of milk to the frosting to make it spreading consistency. Try this cake recipe!

This is the worst cake recipe I have EVER tasted. There is WAY too much coco. It's not sweet. And the taste is horrible. Move on to another recipe and don't waste the ingredients. 
Oh, the frosting is just as bad.

Incredible!!! I made this for my son's second birthday party. I made 1.5 recipes of the cake, but just a single recipe of the icing - it was more than enough for 6 children and 10 adults. Baked it in two 9x13 pans. After removing it from the pans, I froze it overnight so that it would be easier to ice the next day. We decorated it as a construction scene, with a tractor digging up one corner of the cake and a dump truck dumping cake on the other side... added a few broken Crunchy bars for rocks and the everyone LOVED it!

I mixed in the boiling water thoroughly, used 9" pans, and cooked it 35 minutes.  But the cake came out uneven in texture, with most of it being very dense, like it did not rise enough. Not fudgy moist like a brownie - just yucky. The flavor was medium chocolate - nothing "extreme"

Very moist and delicious. I have made this twice now. Second time I was out of vegetable oil so I used melted butter and it made no noticeable difference. I substituted the included frosting recipe for a recipe I really enjoy that uses melted chocolate chips. I took another reviewers suggestion and used fresh brewed coffee instead of boiling water. This is the best chocolate cake that I have made.

Chocolate heaven! This was my first time making a cake from scratch so I was very nervous, but now I can never go back to baking a cake from a box. I can't find enough adjectives to explain how wonderful it was. I made no changes to the recipe. You won't regret this one!

This cake is by far the best I've ever made or bought from a bakery. It is so flavorful, rich, and moist. I cut the frosting in half (I didn't want four layers of cake, only two) and I still had more than I needed.

This cake is very good. Very moist and very easy to make.  I took the suggestion of one rater and added coffee to the boiling water for the cake.  It was suttle but so very good.  The icing was a bit sweet for my taste (hense only 4 stars) so I'll adjust that next time, but overall this is a great recipe and will be my go to for devils food cake!

This was the best chocolate cake I have had.  The frosting was perfect and the cake ultra moist.  I read the other reviews and expected the cake to be runny when I poured it into the pans.  I at first thought that it was not as much in the pans as I expected, but the cake fluffs up nicely.  The cake expanded to the top of the pans and did not overflow. I will be making this again and will never buy a boxed cake mix in the future.

If you hate getting tons of compliments about your cooking than DO NOT try this recipe! This cake really lives up to it's name. Ultra rich, dense and moist, this is definitely extreme chocolate. Not wanting to have to slice the layers I opted to bake the cake in three 8 inch round pans and they came out beautifully. I did have to let the layers cool much longer than recommended, after 10 minutes they weren't ready to come out. After about 20 minutes I was able to coax them out of the pans. I used the frosting recipe between the layers but covered the cake in chocolate ganache. I took the cake to work and my coworkers all joked that I should quit my day job and become a baker.

Very good light and fluffy chocolate layer cake. Only used about half as much cocoa in the frosting as it called for and the icing was still plenty dark. I can't imagine how dark it would be with double that much cocoa. But then again the name of the recipe is "extreme chocolate cake"!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever! I have tried others but none of them turn out that great. I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect. The cake was really moist. My friends and family love this cake. I will make it again for Christmas this year.

This is the exact recipe on the back of Hershey's cocoa containers.  The frosting is a little different though.  It is a very good cake, but Hershey's deserves the credit.  I have never had it overflow my pans and I just use regular cake pans.

This cake was amazing. I have been looking foa a chocolate cake recipe to Keep and this one is it. A few years ago I learned the coffee instead of water trick and I use that every time I make a chocolate cake.  I do agree with other reviewers and I made a lot less icing.  Cutting the layers creates an amazing taste. I was scared to to it, but it tasted GREAT!!

The cake turned out weird, very spongy-I attribute this to the boiling water like others have said.  It was low in flavor (the cake).  The frosting was very bitter, like dark chocolate.  It overflowed while cooking, just like it did for others.  I made it for my brother's 21st birthday, and I was ashamed.  I have made plenty of recipes from scratch, and followed this recipe to the T.  It ended up tasting okay, but I won't make it again almost for certain.  I was really disappointed.  And although people were nice about it, I felt bad that his big birthday had a cake like this :(

This is my "go-to" chocolate cake! It is great and so easy to make! It is very chocolaty and extremely versatile - as I have made it in bundt pans, circle pans, 9x13 and even as cupcakes. The frosting is really good too - sometimes I use oil instead of butter as I am concerned whether the cake would need refrigeration after frosting.

GREAT recipe!  But do it in three 8 or 9" pans instead of two, I learned after SEVERAL messy mishaps that it eliminates the oven spills.  YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, rich chocolate cake.

I’m adding an additional review to counter the one Sara Rajan added. Haha. It irritates me when people either don’t follow a recipe and give the recipe less stars, or they just don’t know the basics of baking and give it less stars. I’m going to be nice and not call her a dummy like I really want to do...whoopsie. Anyway, Sara gave this 1 star because her cake fell apart. Yes, it’s a tender cake. That’s one reason it’s so good. Grease your pan WELL with shortening and dust it WELL with flour or cocoa powder, or even use a piece of parchment paper cut out to the size of the bottoms of the pans. Run your knife around the edges after its cooled for 10 minutes, and these basic steps will ensure the cake comes out perfectly. Mine did. But then again, I know how to bake. But DON’T leave a bad review because of your own stupidity or lack of basic baking skills.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this cake did turn out for me at all.  The cake bubbled over and was so sticky is would not come out of the pans.  I had to take the cake out in pieces, break it up, press it into a glass dish, and try to make a trifle out of it.  The trifle tastes good but I would never use this recipe again.

I will be honest.  I have not made this recipe as written.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate instead of regular cocoa powder and also add 2 tablespoonful of instant espresso.  The cake comes out very dark with a rich/complex flavor that everyone loves.  I am always asked to make the cake 'exactly like last time'.  I also use a cream cheese frosting (from Allrecipes), that I add 1/2 cup of dark chocolate powder and 1 tablespoonful of espresso.  In the center of the two layers I use a small container of raspberries with a small jar of rasperry jam and pulse it in a processor where it's still a little 'lumpy'.  It cuts the sweetness of the jam and makes it taste more 'natural/fresh'.  I add as much as I feel necessary between the cake layers.  I use the leftover jam mixture to add to my oatmeal.

I must have done something wrong. My cupcakes sank in the middle, crunchy on the top, and crumbled. I followed the recipe as written. I thought the taste was bland, but I didn't make the frosting. My husband compared it to a Western Family cake mix. All I can figure is I did something wrong.

I followed this recipe to the letter. Didn't change one single thing. This cake turned out great! Moist, rich and chocolate heaven. My husband has always said he does not care for chocolate cake because his experience was that they were always dry. I convinced him to taste it. He said that this is the only chocolate cake he has ever tasted that was this moist and delicious. My inlaws and friends raved that this cake was the bomb! I promised everyone that this cake would be a staple at gatherings and holidays. You should all try it. And you can flirt with the ingredients as you wish. I will continue to go by the recipe as written since it worked beautifully for me. Enjoy my friends!

Great recipe but is the exact same cake recipe as on the back of Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder can. I did a 9 x 13 glass pan and it took an extra 7 minutes to bake.

This is a great cake. I always get rave reviews. It comes out very fluffy. Sometimes when I want a denser cake I reduce the baking soda and powder to 1 tsp and reduce the boiling water to 3/4 c.  Freezes great!

I used this recipe for the middle tier of a wedding cake. The batter is quite watery and I was concerned that it wasn't going to turn out dense enough to support my wedding cake, but it turned out perfect! It was chocolatey and rich and moist and dense and so darn good! I followed the recipe exactly (except, I did not make the frosting) and will definitely used it again and again. I filled it with layers of chocolate mousse (recipe from this site) and raspberry and I covered it in marshmallow fondant (recipe from this site).

I read the reviews about it being too watery, I tried adding less water.  It was still too moist and took too long to cook.  Tastes fabulous, though.  I might work with this one again or try fudging the white cake recipe.

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was amazing! I had no problems with it at all. The cake is super moist. The frosting is plentiful! I even had enough left over to add some extra decorations. It is definitely extremely chocolatey and is my go-to chocolate recipe from now on.

Ok, this is a no brain-er if you are looking to bake an impressive moist, heavenly, dense, rich chocolate cake!  Bake this cake as written. It's one I've used for years (the recipe is on the back of every Hershey's cocoa box- so yeah, its a famous recipe!) My mouth waters even thinking about this cake.  It suppresses any chocolate craving... oh man, I want a piece right now.

Very yum! I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used Splenda Baking Sugar Blend for granulated sugar..I used 2 9 inch round cake pans and baked for 17 minutes with a rotaion half way through baking. I didnt make 4 layers since my cakes were too thin to divide.  The batter will be VERY thin after you mix in the water, turns out just fine though.  Next time Ill try coffee or spiced rum.  The frosting is SUPER rich and SUPER sweet, very good, but Ill make less next time and cover the cake w a very thin layer, since the star of the show is the cake anyway. Great cake.

This cake is amazingly good!  I made it for the hubs birthday as he is a LOVER of chocolate cake.  I didn't use the frosting recipe as I ran out of time and had to use store bought.  However, I didn't change a thing in the cake mix and it is WONDERFUL.  I used Droste cocoa powder and I believe it made all the difference.  Hershey's is ok in a pinch, but the Dutch processed is where it's at.

Great cake. Nice and moist. Did have problems with it crumbling but overall a very good cake. Will make again. Did not use the frosting recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out very rich and dense.  Making the recipe as is with two 9" pans resulted a 2-layer cake that was about 2" tall.  Each layer did not rise very much at all.  I ended up having to bake the cake for an additional 15 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  I thought it would dry out the cake, but it was still very moist.  We ended up not eating it for another 1.5 days later, and it was still very moist and delicious.  It was very easy to make and surprised everyone that I made it completely from scratch!

WOW! I did not change a thing and it was absolutely the moistest, most delicious cake I have ever eaten. It was my first, from scratch, chocolate cake, and I could not be more pleased with the results. YUMMY to the MAX!!!!!

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on. It is beyond delicious - very moist and fudgie with a deep cocoa flavor. I love that it is a one bowl cake - nothing fussy about it but the end result is sublime. The only change I made was to replace the boiling water with a cup of freshly brewed French roast coffee to deepen and enhance the cocoa flavor. Try it - you don't taste coffee at all in the baked cake. I stirred it into the batter by hand, otherwise my mixer would have spattered it all over the place - it gets pretty goopy. I also didn't bother to split the layers.  I made this cake for my son's birthday, and I've already had three calls for the recipe. I frosted it with whipped cream whipped with fresh strawberries and it was the perfect accompaniment for the richness of the cake. We were disappointed there were no leftovers, but my husband's birthday is tomorrow and guess what cake he is getting?? Yippee!

I didn't make the frosting but this cake is outstanding! I filled it with a milk chocolate ganache and covered with ganache and MMF and it was absolutely the best thing I've ever made and quite arguably the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! Everyone says it's great but I can never tell if they're trying to be nice or flattering so I go by my judgement, and this one ROCKS!

I used Pam on my cake pans and the cake stuck.  So I would recommend to grease and flour instead.  Otherwise an excellent cake, icing is sweet but very good.

The cake part of this recipe is the EXACT same as the "Hershey's ® 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake" recipe also on this site. The only difference is the icing. It really is a very good cake though, I make it often!

The cake itself is delicious. Wonderfully dense & moist. I substituted 1-cup freshly brewed hazelnut coffee for the boiling water. However, the frosting is very bitter. I believe it calls for way too much cocoa powder. I rescued it by mixing in about 1/2 jar of Nutella. I also used the plain Nutella as the filling between the layers. The cake recipe itself is a keeper.

This is hands down the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had. I don't even know what to say about it. It was perfect. It stayed so moist and tasted so wonderfully delicious. I was a little conerned when I went to bake it because I thought after adding the water it looked pretty runny - but I had read other reviews that said the same thing and they all said it turned out great - well, it did. It was perfectly dense and had great taste. Until this cake I had yet to eat a chocolate cake that was made from scratch that tasted good. There was always something that wasn't quite right. Well, here's that perfect recipe.  (I didn't use this icing recipe.)

THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever had, hands down.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. So moist and dense, with a rich chocolate flavor that wasn't overly sweet. And the frosting was so light and creamy - I couldn't stop myself from eating it straight from the bowl! I will be making this recipe forever!

Oh my gosh....this cake is so delicious!!  It is rich and super-moist.  We all loved it.  I followed the directions to a "t" except I subed dark chocolate cocoa.  I also took a previous posters tip and changed the icing to Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing.  Here is her recipe:  2 sticks of softened butter, 2 8 oz bricks of softened cream cheese, 2 lbs of powdered sugar, 1 cup dark chocolate cocoa, 1 Tbsp vanilla and a pinch of salt.  **WARNING**  This is addictive!!!!

I made this cake last night, baked it and let it sit. This morning I made the frosting (added a tbsp. of instant coffee crystals to the milk) and slathered the cake and let it sit again. I made no changes to the recipe, other than adding the coffee crystals to the milk for the frosting and using buttermilk. This cake is SO moist. I don't know how it tastes the first day, but I will say that it's phenom the second day. I bet it'd even be better a couple days later still. Very good. NOTE: I would take pictures but I didn't frost the cake very pretty at all. I'm  embarassed by my lack of cake decorating skillz.

I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this cake but one thing for sure, it came out nice and moist and rich in colour. For some reason, I didn't find the taste to be very chocolatey. It seemed a bit bland but maybe it's because I didn't use Hershey's cocoa powder (although what I did use - Fry's - is supposed to be a premium cocoa powder...). Also, I have never made cake with vegetable oil before, but this one definitely had a distinctive taste and aroma that could only be described as odd which I'm sure was due to the oil. I don't think I will make this again and if I do, it will be with many changes - butter instead of vegetable oil, 1/2 coffee 1/2 water, 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white.

I only used about 1/4 cup of boiling water and I think the cake came out just fine. Maybe it could use another egg. The icing however was excellent.  I used 1 1/4 cup less of the powdered sugar and thought it was the best I've ever made.

A really fabulous recipe.  This cake is soo chocolatey!  I had a slice 6 hours ago and still feel it's too soon for another piece!
If you are cooking this in the UK, use Self Raising flour.  I got confused and used Plain flour!  It made the cake really moist and dense, but really rich.  The Self Raising flour will had more height and lightness to the cake.    
Also, next time I will also only use 1/2 cup of cocoa powder in the cake and increase the flour, and only 1 cup in the icing (increase the sugar)

The cake portion of this recipe was taken off the side of the Hershey's Cocoa container. We've been making it for years. It is identical. Shame on the poster for claiming it. Not sure the source of the frosting.

Extreme Chocolate Cake, Yes...Extremely disappointing. I ended up making this cake twice. The first attempt, I followed the recipe exactly. This batter ran all over and made a huge mess. I was able to salvage 1 of the 2 cakes from the tin when it cooled. The texture and consistency was good. It is moist and tastes good. The second attempt I only added 1/2 of the boiling water hoping to avoid the running over and mess. Nope. Same issues. These 2 sank quite a bit as well. The only thing I can attribute to this failure is altitude. We are somewhere around 4500 ft. I've been baking for years in this altitude and can usually adjust for things I think might not work so well. This one I could not. I'm baffled....

I have made this in a 13 x 9 and it has tons of frosting for that. I have also made it in two 9 inch pans. Once I did not split the cakes and it had two cake layers. The other times, I have split the cakes into two layers for a total of four layers of cake. I have made this cake many times. It is  a big hit every time.
After the cakes come out of the oven, let them cool on the counter 10-20 minutes, then I put mine in the freezer for one to two hours before I remove them from their pains and split the cakes into two layers.

The recipe is fine for cup cakes or small baking tins but having tried it the day before I had to get a cake made, I was really disappointed. It shrinks and you need at 3 cakes to stack and make a decent size cake.  I would use it (maybe..) for cupcakes only.

THIS RECIPE WAS AMAZING!! Made it for a birthday celebration and everyone wanted a slice, to the point there wasn't enough to go around. Like what the other reviewers suggested, i changed the 1 cup boiling water to 1 cup of boiling hot coffee. I used an instant coffee bag and it turned out just fine. Kept everything else the same, but used another chocolate frosting recipe. 

To get a flat top, let your cake cool after taking it out of the oven, for about 10-15mins. Mine did puff down which allowed me to get 2 flat top cakes, i placed the tops down, facing each other and slapped some frosting between, so the flat side (bottom of pan) would be the base and top. Do wait for the cakes to cool before frosting else it would turn runny. 

Fantastic cake and i would make it again! (Well i have to cos everyone has requested this for the subsequent birthdays) DO GIVE IT A TRY, NO REGRETS!

Oh this cake is good.  I used coffee instead of water and made 20 enormous cupcakes.  I baked it for about 30 minutes.  My big mistake was adding chocolate chips to the batter.   The chips sunk to the bottom.  Don't bother with them.  Otherwise, excellent and extremely moist cake.  A keeper.

Very moist. After using imported German Cocoa for so many years, the bargain brand I bought at Walmart seemed bland. I missed the rich chocolate flavor of the European Cocoa. It's a great recipe, though. Just be sure to use a quality cocoa.

This review is just based on the cake. Followed the recipe exactly and just sifted dry ingredients together before adding mixed wet ingredients.  Beat together with hand mixer only until well combined and then mix in hot water manually. The cake was so incredibly moist my husband said it was the best cake I've ever made and I bake often.  I made a light peanut butter frosting and a chocolate ganache on top instead of this frosting.

I'm not sure what I did wrong. I waited over an hour to take the cakes out of their pans. A few small pieces of cake came off which wouldn't have been a big deal but when I tried to frost it chunks started to break off. I left it alone in hopes that it wouldn't get any worse but the cake actually split in places from the weight of the frosting. I've had cakes come out not looking picture perfect before but this was ridiculous. The cake and the frosting both tasted great...but it looked like a natural disaster.

I have been making this cake for several years now and it's the absolute best chocolate cake I've ever tasted.  I've never tried it with coffee, though, so the next time I make it I'll try that innovation.  One note, however.  Rach56 should have properly attributed this recipe.  If you look on the back of the Hershey's cocoa container, it is exactly the same recipe.  Maybe Rach56 didn't know about this, but there it is.

I followed the directions EXCEPT I didn't mix the water in by hand, but that's how I roll. If you don't mix by hand, def scrape the sides of the bowl really, really good. 

I let the cake cool a good 45 minutes before removing it from the pan and it popped out beautifully (I grease and floured the pans). It's moist and the icing is spot on perfect.

This cake is incredible. I bake for my extended family a lot and I do plenty of cakes, and after eating this one they said it was the best cake I have ever made. The cake itself was rich, moist, and the perfect balance between density and airiness. The icing was a great pairing too. I make chocolate buttercream icing all the time but this recipe was far better than anything I'd done before. However it calls for 1 1/2 C of cocoa powder in the icing and after adding just 1/2 C, it tasted great so I didn't add more. It was very chocolaty already and I was worried about how it would taste if I added more. The ingredients made a good amount of icing too, which would very easily cover every layer if you split the layers horizontally like they called for. I didn't to that, so I had enough to add decorative touches and piping to the finished cake, and then I had some icing left over that I'll store for something else I make. I will definitely make this again. It is my go-to chocolate cake from now on!

This is probably one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had. I made it for my managers birthday and all my co-workers raved over it. I brought home some leftovers for my parents and they were fighting each other for the last bite!

I followed others suggestions and used a cup of hot coffee instead of boiling water which is what I think really set this cake apart. I also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk (since that was all I had) and it came out perfect. I did find that I needed to bake the cake for about 45 to 50 mins before a toothpick came out mostly clean. The cake was a bit rounded when it first came out but flatten as it cooled. Also, there was a LOT of frosting (I didn't split each layer though); I ended up throwing some of the extra away.

This recipe is definitely a keeper and I can't wait for an opportunity to make it again!

I'd never mastered a chocolate cake & frosting until I found this recipe! Per other reviewers, the only changes I made was to use 1 cup hot coffee in place of the boiling water, I used cocoa to 'flour' the greased pans, & personally, two layers is fine for me, so I didn't attempt to split my cakes horizontally; everything else I followed exact! My cakes didn't overflow & I didn't have trouble removing from the pans (I made sure to grease them well). I thought it was a lot of cocoa & powdered sugar for the frosting, but I gave it a go anyway and WHOA! is it good! Not too sweet or gritty as long as you follow instructions to alternate the dry & wet ingredients. As others have noted, this cake tastes better the 2nd day - even better the 3rd day, if it lasts that long! I made it Tuesday for a birthday party on Wednesday, and was getting requests from family by Sunday to 'please make it again' - and since they said please. . . ;) Both times it's turned out AWESOME !  Definitely my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.

Allrecipes never disappoints!! This is a great recipe for chocolate cake.  I read the reviews before making and decided to make it in a 9x13 pan.  It came out moist and very chocolaty?  I did add a little espresso powder to the dry ingredients.  The batter is thin so don't be afraid.  I used a chocolate fudge frosting not the one in the recipe, but next time I will try this one.  This is a keeper!!  Thanks!

The BEST chocolate cake recipe out there! Have made this a dozen times and always comes out super moist and with the right amount of chocolaty taste. I have subbed the reg. cocoa powder for a dark cocoa powder and that came out even more decedent. Will be making this over and over! Thanks for sharing!!

Made the cake exactly as outlined above (except used a vanilla buttercream icing) and it turned out great.  My husband prefers a darker chocolate cake made with a cup of coffee but everyone else loved this cake.

This is a perfect chocolate cake recipe!  I always use 1 cup of hot brewed coffee in place of the boiling water.  You can't taste the coffee once it's been baked, but boy oh boy does it bring out the flavor of the chocolate.  It doesn't get any better than this!  It's moist, rich, and truly a perfect chocolate cake.

Made this cake for a friends birthday.   We can't stop talking how good it was.   Best Chocolate Cake I have ever had.   For those of you who know Wegmans and have had their chocolate cake this is 10 times better!  trust me.

In a word: PHENOMENAL. I am known for my chocolate cakes and brownies; this recipe just increased the value of my real estate. Also, in my 35 years of baking, this is the best frosting I have ever worked with. 

This cake was so good, an elderly man who is dying of cancer and who hasn't eaten anything for a week, ate a whole slice and was happy! Bake this cake and bring joy one slice at a time...

This is a very thin batter, but bakes up beautifully. I made cupcakes, and substituted a cup of hot coffee for the water.

One thing I noticed is that the edges seemed to get a little crunchy kind of like when you make brownies. I must say it came out very well. I had a family event and used them as taste testers. Some of the comments I received were it was very rich, strong chocolate taste and moist. I made only half of the frosting that the recipe suggested. I'd recommend this one.

The cake portion of this recipe is definitely for the chocolate lover! It is dense, moist and rich in flavor. 
I was not a fan of the icing. Something about the flavor was off for me.
I made the recipe exactly with the exception of using a 13x9x2 inch glass pan. I baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and it came out beautifully.

Wonderful fluffy texture to cake.  I made cupcakes.  Batter made 26 standard sized cupcakes. Frosting is wonderful too.  I mixed both the cake batter and the frosting with a large stand mixer.  I even added the water to it on low with no issues.  It got great reviews from the family.

My preference was to use dark cocoa powder.  So good.  The butter cream frosting with dark cocoa was a huge hit.  Will make this again.

This was an exceptional cake, very easy to make and the ingredients were all readily available. I made this recipe into cupcakes and it was so rich and so moist. Definitely my favorite chocolate cake recipe.  Bye to cake mixes.....i added half a teaspoon of butterscotch flavor

Excellent cake recipe! Nice & moist and not difficult at all. I, personally, wasn't too crazy about the frosting... I think it's just a matter of differences in taste preference. This one was a little sweet for me as I prefer a more buttery flavor to off-set the sweetness of the cake. Think I'll try my all-time favorite "wedding cake frosting" on it next time. (from this site) It still deserves 5 stars though! Thanks to everyone for the "soupy batter warnings". The batter IS absolutely soupy... but makes a wonderfully delicious cake!
Edited to add that I tried using the dark cocoa & liked it even better. No more store-bought cake mixes for me! Also, if you make cupcakes with this, (which I did) be careful not to overfill.

My first "scratch" choc. cake and so easy! Great even WITHOUT icing! I sprinkled a little icing sugar and slivered almonds on top to look nice, but no icing. Thanks for tips re runny batter being normal and not over-filling pans!

Like other reviewers, I was very worried about how runny the batter seemed, but still forged ahead with following the recipe exactly... and I'm glad I did- it turned out great! This cake was so moist and delicious. I paired it with coconut cream cheese frosting- heaven!

Absolutely excellent! Easy to prepare-- I made cake pops with it! I used 1/2 cup of dark chocolate cocoa powder and 1/2 cup of regular cocoa powder because it's what I had on hand-- it's delicious!

This a wonderful cake recipe! I have made it twice- first time as written for my daughter's birthday (everyone LOVED it). The second time ( as cupcakes) I made it Gluten Free so my husband and I could eat it as well, substituting 1/2 rice and 1/2 tapioca flour for the wheat flour, and adding 2 tsp guar gum.  Nobody could tell the difference! Both times the texture was silky, and the flavour nice and chocolatey, yet not overly sweet.  Thank you for this recipe, a definite keeper!

Good recipe! I had to add a bit of extra flour to thicken the batter, but other than that, it was perfect. The icing was so good that my boyfriend ate about a cup of it on its own. Highly recommended!

Delicious!  The cake is light.  Not heavy like a scratch cake can be.  I baked in a 13 x 9 pan for about 40 min and then made a half batch of frosting.  That was PLENTY!  The frosting has lots of cocoa and tasted like dark chocolate.  Yummy!

Awesome!!  Had been using another Chocolate Cupcake recipe, but this is my new favorite!!  I make cupcakes a couple times a month, and know there will be a huge hit.  Made this into cupcakes, baked them for about 15 mins.  Made about 29 cupcakes, would try to make only 24 next time, some liners weren't quite full.

I'm not a chocolate fanatic but this chocolate cake and the frosting taste very good! Followed the recipe and the steps and it turned out great! Made it twice for 2 of my friend's birthday, who both adore chocolate, and they enjoyed it. This is a winner in my book for any chocolate fanatic!!!

Well...I'm disappointed. The cake is alright, but really not that much better than a mix. And I didn't like the frosting at all! I definitely won't make again.

I substituted hot coffee for the water and cream for the milk.  It turned out really well.  Just not the ultimate fabulous I was expected... little better than out of a box, but not by much.

This cake was super moist OMG let me tell you... so good I made it twice in one week. I used a bundt cake pan so I had extra frosting from the 1st batch since I only frosted the top of the cake.

I also read the reviews and substituted the 1 cup of boiling water for 1 cup of strong hot coffee.

For the frosting I only used 1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, just thought it would be too, too much chocolate for me and I was right. Next time I'll decrease to 3/4 cup just to try.  

All in All the chocolate on chocolate still worked well together and came out so  good!!

FYI - The batter will look watery and not the consistency of box cake batter so don't be alarmed for those that haven't tried the recipe yet.

Frosting is a bit thick and too sweet, but otherwise this recipe is very good!  I will simply cut back on the cocoa and sugar on the frosting recipe the next time I make it.

I made this for my son-in-laws b-day.  The only things I did different was I added a big scoop of peanut butter to the batter.  After I baked the cake and cooled it, I put Reeses Peanut Butter Cup ice cream between the layers (I used one layer and froze the other).  I could tell when I cut the cake layer in half that it would be great for decorating...it's very moist, not crumbly or dry.  It was placed in the freezer over night then I put hot fudge sauce on the top and then I cut up some peanut butter cups to decorate it.  It was great!  Very rich but he loves peanut butter cups and this hit the spot...we all loved it! I froze half of the cake...it freezes well.  This cake is better than a box mix and extremely moist!  Thanks for a great recipe

I give 5 stars to the cake recipe, as written.  It was delicious -- very chocolaty, good texture, moist and not crumbly.  The batter is quite runny, and I was a little worried when I poured it into the pan (I made cupcakes), but it came out perfectly.  I did not try the frosting, so I can't comment on that.  I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site instead, and it was great!

Best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried. Cake is very moist and frosting is divine. Definitely for the chocolate lover. I substituted 1 cup buttermilk for the 1 cup milk in the cake batter. It is runny after you add the boiling water, but I didn't have a problem with it overflowing from the pans while baking. I've made it twice and will make it again for my daughter's birthday!

Of course I will give this recipe five stars as it is a Hershey recipe, one that I have been making for years. It is the best chocolate cake recipe. Splitting the layers in half doesn't change the ownership of the recipe.

This is light, moist and has great flavor.  I am glad to have found a good "scratch" cake recipe. Box cakes are okay , but they are getting so expensive.This recipe is the way to go. Besides, the cake has all the ingredients we have in our pantry. Thanks for the recipe.  I definitely will be making this again.

I choose this recipe because of the great reviews it has received.  My 4 year old wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday and this cake was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it and knew it was from scratch due to the moistness of the cake!  I have plans to make this at an upcoming baby shower - by request!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  EDIT: 10/24/2019 8 years later, and this is still my go to chocolate cake!

love this cake, but it has to be made a day ahead-- it's SO much better after it's sat a day, otherwise it can be cloyingly sweet.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had let alone ever made! I refuse to buy another boxed chocolate cake or cake out of a store for that matter. My four year old daughter and I made this last night and half of the cake was gone within 20 minutes. I was hesitant to use the hot water because prior to adding the batter was at the perfect cake consistency, but I followed the directions to the 't' and I'm glad I did. The end result was a moist, rich, light chocolate cake with 6 protruding bellies. Thank you for providing this recipe it will definitely join our collection and will be passed generation after generation.

Absolutely delicious.  I made it with butter in place of the oil. It was very easy to make.  It turned out wonderfully.  I used my own frosting recipe, so can't comment on that.

yummmm cake!  very good, exact cake recipe as "Hershey's ® 'Perfectly Chocolate' Chocolate Cake".

I love that the prep time is very short (I would say 15 minutes), and that you don't have to fluff butter/sugar together blah blah before mixing the other ingredients.  Oil makes this fast and simple.  Very delicious cake!

I have no complaint about the texture of this cake, it was very moist and chocolatey. Unfortunately, it was just way too sweet for us. I had a slice and couldn't finish it. I will just have to keep looking for the perfect chocolate cake recipe.

Great CAKE! This is by no means a flufy sponge cake but a dense and moist chocolate cake. I baked minicupcakes at 175C for 15min (filled up to 2/3 and yield a perfect little round top). Original is bit too sweet but lowering to 1 1/2cup of sugar was perfect. I would also lessen salt to 1/2 tsp. Oh I also baked a round cake in glass pyrex bowl which took 50min at 180C, had a crunchy-candylike top and moist cake inside. 
I did not try the frosting.

Loved this recipe.  First time around I made a different frosting.  Should have stuck with the one here - very rich, dense and fabulous.  I like sweet, hence the 5 star rating. 

Cake was also very good.  Very soupy as others have mentioned, before it goes in the oven.  Don't worry about that -  it will come out fine.  But leave enough clearance room because this stuff rises. 

I made cupcakes the second time around.  As noted, the batter rises, so if you are making cupcakes, only fill 3/4 of the way up.  I filled about 4/5 of the way and got muffin tops.  (and if you like muffin tops, well by all means fill up to 4/5th of the way up.)

I followed the recipe exactly. I did not have two 9" pans and instead had one 9" x 3" pan. The finished batter was somewhat soupy as stated by reviewer (Elli Sep. 5, 2006). I went to check my first one to only drop it on to the floor!!! On a brighter note that painful mistake let me get a preview (inside was slightly undone but outside was perfect). Onto cake #2, I put the pan on a baking sheet and wrapped around the edges of pan with foil. I had to bake it longer 1 hour (b/c of 9x3 pan). I had to go out and let it sit in the pan for ~6 hours. Took it out and it was perfect. (I buttered/floured and lined the bottom with a piece of parchment. This greatly helped removal and keeping it whole.) I kept it in a cake keeper, made frosting next day. Served immediately after. My sister who I made it for commented it was truly a great chocolate cake, no dryness, and perfect.

Two stars for taste only, which was good from what little we could salvage after it SET OUR OVEN ON FIRE... we used the 8x2 pans and the mixture bubbled up like crazy, overflowed, burnt the bottom of the oven and set it on fire before we could get it out. Had we known it was going to be so expansive we could have used a 9 x 13 and had a great cake. Beware of expanding cake!

Really good! I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but my husband is. For his birthday I made this for him and topped it with cream cheese frosting. It turned out wonderful. I even liked! I will definitely keep this recipe on file for future cakes.

Amazing!! I used 2x 8in pans filled them a little under 2/3 full as some reviewers mentioned it rises a lot, which it does.  I ended up with 5 1/2 cup cakes along with the 8in cake and everything rose perfectly and did not overflow. 

The frosting and cake together are delicious. Add some vanilla ice cream and you are in heaven. I highly recommend this recipe. When I made it, it came out looking exactly like the picture. Good recipe be sure to follow it word for word.

Wow.  okay, first off I don't even like chocolate, I made it for my boyfriend, and ended up eating 3 slices myself!! i made it as is, exactly, no change, except used my own frosting recipe. I made two pans (9 inch), and it was so crumbly, didn't want to risk cutting so left as two layers, and will do that in future because that was perfect.  Made much bigger cake than expected, very crumbly, but just shoved all the pieces back together, and no one noticed or cared.  Delicious, seriously, I have never liked chocolate cake, but for some reason this cake i loved.  (and my boyfriend and mom LOVE it, too, though they love all desserts, lol)  (I also made this same cake with broken (in big pieces) oreos in the batter, and LOTS more broken oreos sprinkled on top of frosting both layers, and served with plain vanilla ice cream. perfect!!)

I had such high expectations of this cake, but it was not the best.  The cake texture and flavor was just okay...and the icing---waaay too bitter and chocolatey...but not in a good way.  I made this for my son's 5th birthday, b/c he wanted all chocolate...and though it looked beautiful, plenty of people left most of the cake on their plate.  I followed the directions to the -t- and the batter tasted great.  I make cakes all the time, but this one was not one to repeat.  sorry.

oh my gosh this was AMAZING. I am pretty lazy and usually use boxed cake mix to do my cakes- not anymore!

I was in a rush so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Because we were in such a hurry I didn't have time to allow the layers to cool. It turned out better that way though, because the buttercream melted right into the middle layers of the cake! (I reccommend this!) It was so moist and delicious that even my cake hating grandmother had a piece. Made exactly as instructions asked.

This was very delicious and moist.  I made it for work for Valentine's Day in a heart shape with pink and chocolate buttercream.  Delicious and beautiful.  Many of my coworkers asked for the recipe.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever! Do not be alarmed it comes out as a bit of a runny batter, but have faith, it cooks beautifully. I even used it to make cupcakes and pressed a couple fresh raspberries inside and topped them with cream cheese icing, they came out amazing! Btw, I baked the standard sized cupcakes for 15 minutes a batch.

This cake is the end of box mixes for me! It was the most perfect, chocolatey cake ever! It rose nice and high, perfect for slicing in half. The cake itself is moist and dense. The icing is also worth the 5 stars. Great chocolate flavor and it's the perfect spreading consistency. NOTHING is wrong with this recipe! (except the cake doesn't last long enough to enjoy!)

We made a Gluten Free, Casein Free version of this cake (although we used a different frosting) by replacing the flour with gluten free flour (we used Carol Fenster's Sorghum Blend), using Hain Featherweight baking powder, sea salt, canola oil for the veg oil, 2 tsp vanilla powder with the dry ingredients instead of liquid extract, and almond milk in place of the milk, and we added 2 1/4 tsp guar gum to the dry ingredients (to accommodate the GF flour).  

We've been using allrecipes for years, and this is the first time I have ever felt COMPELLED to post a review.  I had 11 people try it at a party, 10 of which do NOT like gluten free stuff, and ALL 10 said it was GREAT... just like the real deal!  And my daughter who is on a GFCF diet can FINALLY have chocolate cake that is DELICIOUS!  Thank you so much!

Best cake I have ever eaten, easy to make, especially for such a beautiful result! Made this for my son's second birthday and we couldn't stop eating it! WONDERFUL! Moist, BEST EVER! Thank you so much! Also, I didn't change a thing and it was perfect. I did have a little icing left over but I stuck it in the freezer for midnight snacking ;)

Wonderful! I didn't use the icing because I wanted to do something with whip cream and strawberries for Valentine's Day, but the cake itself is fantastic! It was so fudgey and delicious! Definitely needed the full baking time.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I used the Chocolate Cheese Frosting recipe from this site. The cream cheese frosting was a nice compliment to this dark, rich cake. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe! Thank you - this was a home run!

This was excellent!  we followed it exactly and made 16 servings to make a side cake for my nephews first birthday. Even the non-chocolate cake eaters were going back for seconds!  we had a ton of icing left over making 16 servings, though.

Great recipe. I've been making this cake for a long time.  As for the icing, I wanted to mention that if you add it to the cake while it is still warm, it turns into more of a glaze and personally- I think it is more delicious that way. Kinda like a chocolate glazed donut- which are my favorite lol. I make this cake frequently for my chocolate cake loving boyfriend.

This cake is awesome! It is very moist.  The icing is also very good but it is pretty sweet. I made this as a 3 layer cake; I think 4 layers would be too thin. I will definitely use this recipe again however, next time I will reduce the powdered sugar by 1 cup.

This cake was perfect! I used 2 9-inch cake pans and followed the recipe exactly. I did overbake it a tad at 40 minutes-my suggestion would be to not bake it until a toothpick comes out clean, but until some crumbs are left on it-probably just around 30 minutes or so. Then, this is a wonderfully moist and fudgy cake. I kept it refrigerated which made it even better. For the frosting, i replaced 1/4 cup of butter with 4 oz. neufchatel cream cheese. For both the frosting and the cake i used dutch proceesed cocoa-the cake had risen just fine with it but the batter certainly does start out soupy.

This has got to be the best cake I've ever made! So moist... even after 3 days! I, too, was concerned about the "thin" batter after the extra cup of boiling water, but baked fabulously! I made exactly as directions read. This will be our "birthday" cake recipe for years to come!

I only did two layers (didn't split the separate cakes in two) so I ended up with a lot of frosting left over.  The frosting was delicious and I wish I had slathered more of it on.

I've made this cake several times & it's absolutely divine! This last time I made it for a party & I wanted a big, impressive cake so I multiplied everything by 1.5 & made a 3 layer round cake. It turned out gorgeous & was as beautiful as it was rich & delicious.

Everything a chocolate cake could be!  I baked in a bundt pan.  Had to up the baking time a few minutes.  My husband said it tasted exactly how it was supposed to taste. Cut icing recipe in half and still had extra.

A great recipe! The batter was extremely runny, almost to the consistency of water, but I trusted the advice of other reviewers that this was OK and it turned out fine, albeit slightly gummy. I had no problems with having too much batter for two 9" cake pans, and they didn't spill over, although I put a cookie sheet under them just in case and they did rise significantly, so I could see where it would be possible. I had to mix everything by hand because I just moved and my mixer was MIA, but it turned out fine, although my arms got quite a workout. The frosting was great also, and anyone who thinks it's too sugary, too chocolatey, too stiff, or too runny simply needs to vary the amount of ingredients used. It's very easy to customize to your liking with those ingredients. My frosting had a nice, shiny glazed appearance and was very easy to work with and tasted great. The frosting was very fudgy and would be EXCELLENT on brownies. This is overall a very foolproof recipe - please stop buying boxed chocolate cake and make it "the real way!"

I don't usually comment on recipes, but WOW, this cake absolutely awesome!!! It is moist, delicious, and by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan instead of layering it and baked it for an extra 10 or so minutes (about 45 minutes total), and it was perfect! Frosting is great as well!

This cake is amazing! I made it for a friend's birthday earlier this year and now it's time for another friend's birthday so I turned to this recipe. I also used hot coffee instead of boiling water because of the depth of flavor it adds. It's a very rich cake but if you've never had homemade buttercream icing you HAVE to try this. I would give this 10 stars!

I was going to the store to buy some cocoa powder to make this recipe and I picked up some Hershey's cocoa powder.  Turns out this recipe is the EXACT SAME recipe from the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder container.  Go figure.

I've never been so confident about my cakes before! Thanks to this recipe, I can openly admit that I make bomb chocolate cake! I substitute the boiling water with espresso and it's wonderful. I've made this recipes exactly as it is too. No complaints! This makes A LOT of frosting and I always wind up throwing away more than I'd like to (and this is coming from someone who really loads it on and will eat several spoon full to boot so beware!). Try adding a table spoon or two of peanut butter to the frosting for a little nutty flavor. Yum!

thank goodness, a great chocolate cake recipe. i wouldn't recommend splitting this into 4 layers though, they're too thin. i filled this with the buttercream and alternated with raspberry filling, and drizzled some on top too. it was a huge hit. i'll definitely keep this one.

I LOVED this cake! I made it in 3-9" cake pans and had to add a couple of extra tblsp's of milk to the frosting but it was excellent! I may try spreading smooth peanut butter over the middle layers of frosting next time, just because I love chocolate and PB! This will definitely be my go-to recipe for chocolate cake!

I made this recipe using high quality cocoa powder and fresh brewed coffee in place of the boiling water and it tastes great. The moistness is wonderful, but it is a wee bit dense. I'd definitely make it again though.

I really wanted to like this cake, especially since the ingredients were simple and the cake was fast to make.  The cake is moist, but just doesn't have much flavor and the texture is too chewy.  If you like boxed cake mixes, then this cake is definitely for you.  Otherwise, maybe you could sub butter for oil and change the texture.  It's better with frosting and the recipe here is okay.  I used more milk than called for to make it spreadable.

For God's sake, even if you've lost all hope.. try this recipe! I can't help but give this cake five stars. I am definitely a critic when it comes to high-rated recipes on the internet (sometimes I swear that people who rate things online have taste-buds that don't function correctly!) but this cake is beautiful and tastes and feels exactly how you'd hope a homemade cake would. It didn't taste floury or like an "on the farm" chocolate cake- it was moist and the cocoa and sugar were in correct balance to not taste dusty like some chocolate cakes do. I used cake flour in mine as a precaution because I really try to avoid density when I bake, and I noticed that some people were saying that it turned out dense for them. All a matter of taste. Mine rose beautifully, too.. just as well as any cake-mix cake, but it tasted so much better. The frosting was gorgeous (I only needed 5 c. confectioners sugar), even though I would prefer a more buttery and less sugary taste, and the frosting recipe could definitely be halved if you like your frosting thinner like me, but even with that, the cake itself is completely worth five stars with or without the partner frosting.  Thank you so much, Rach56.

Very good! Made 13x9 size and baked 45 min. made frosting per recipe but it tasted too bitter as others had mentioned, so I added 2 TBL more of butter and a splash of milk (probably 1-2 TBL) and it was Perfect!! Let it mix in my Kitchenaid mixer for about 5 minutes and it was nice and smooth--not gritty. This frosting recipe made WAY too much for a 13x9 size, though (and I like a LOT of frosting--I put it on about 3/4" thick and I STILL had half a bowl of frosting remaining that could have frosted another cake!).

This cake was really moist and not too sweet, which was good because it balanced out the sweet frosting.  The frosting melted in my mouth.  I did not change anything about the recipe.

Delicious!  I made this for my husband's birthday, and the whole cake was gone in less than three days between two people.  We were fighting over the last piece.

My very first cake from scratch!  I did do some substitutions, I used butter instead of oil and buttermilk instead of milk in both the cake and frosting.  I wanted that "old fashioned" taste and boy I got it and it is GOOD!!!  Just the like the name of the recipe, it is Extreme Chocolate and extremely good!   *The batter is runny, but cooked perfectly at 30 minutes.

Wow!  I was sceptical after tasting a tiny piece of the cake after it came out of the oven.  It didn't taste that amazing.  Well, it's all in the frosting.  That is A LOT of cocoa for frosting and I used Penzey's cocoa.  Wowza!  It's awesome.  The cake was extremely easy to make.  It baked up perfectly, though I headed others advice and didn't use all the batter.  I made 3 cupcakes in addition to two 9" round pans.  I was worried about slicing and layering the cakes as they were very tender, but they held up and I was able to do it.  The frosting was enough to evenly cover all the layers and the top and sides and still have enough for the three extra cupcakes.  It was a HUGE hit at book club.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I left 1 cup of the powdered sugar out of the frosting because I don't like too sweet frosting.  I also think next time I'd mix the cocoa in with the boiling water because that makes the cocoa bloom and brings out more chocolate flavor.  Every other cake recipe I have with boiling water involved has those instructions.  I also lined my pans with parchment paper to avoid any sticking.  Worked great.

It's good but....well I floured the pan but it came out in pieces, at least the top one did but my dad even loved the crumbles! Then when it cooled down, I made the frosting, didn't put as much confectioner's sugar in because that sounded like wayyyyy to much so I just put in 3 1/2 and the frosting came out to thin so that was a bad one on me.     But I could tell that even if I did increase it, it would be SO rich! So I just drizzled a little on top. Good cake but I don't think I'll make it again. Good luck to others tho!

I used three 8 1/2 inch pans and it turned out great.  I did not split layers though.  I made it yesterday for the second time.  I would use real butter in the frosting and not be tempted to use margarine.  The first time I made it with margarine it was not as creamy.

I halved the recipe made a half circle stacked cake. It was very rich and delicious. It is missing something I'm not sure what yet. It was good though. I will make again maybe with whip cream and strawberries

The cake was amazing, but it did cook over the sides of my pan and I had to clean the oven.  Would recommend 3 pans or don't use all of the batter if you don't have large pans.  The cake was moist and VERY VERY good!  I was worried that the batter was too thin after adding the water, but that was not the case.  Thank you for the yummy idea!!

This cake was soooo yummy and so moist!  I didn't cut the two halves because I wasn't sure I'd have enough icing.  But just the same, the cake was amazing!  I'd even venture to say the best I've ever had!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  The only tiny little thing that I would change is the amount of sugar in the icing--it was insanely sweet!  Others have said the same thing but I tried it as written first just to be sure.  It's an easy fix and doesn't take away any stars.  The cake itself is moist and rich and chocolaty and lovely.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe for every occasion!

The batter definitely was runny after I added the boiling water but it poured and fit in the pan fine. I used a bundt pan. It ended up boiling over the pan and into my oven (like many others) and it kind of collapsed on itself. It wasn't pretty but it tasted good! The frosting is the best chocolate frosting I've ever tasted. Though I used 1/2 cup butter/margarine, 3/4 cups cocoa, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1/3 cup milk, and 1 tsp vanilla but that was all I needed. I expect if you make a layered cake, you'd need more frosting (like the one included in the recipe) but using less ingredients worked perfectly for me, and it was amazing. Definitely will be using this recipe often!! Maybe with less or no water this time. It was much easier than I expected!

This cake is FANTASTIC!! I have made it several times and people always are so happy when I make it! It's really easy to make since it has oil instead of butter. I make it with skim milk which still tastes great, so I can tell people the cake is low-ish in fat. For the frosting, I suggest you add 1/8tsp of cream of tartar to give it a mousse-y texture. And if you find the frosting is sweet enough, but not thick enough, add flour or cornstarch.

This is a very good chocolate cake recipe! I added 1 cup of mashed bananas and I reduced the boiling water to 1/2 cup. I baked it in a 9x13" baking dish and added a crumb topping! I served this on Mother's Day and everyone loved it! It was moist and rich but not too sweet! Perfect! This will be my "go to" recipe for chocolate cakes!

This is THE best chocolate cake! So moist and chocolaty. I put a little peppermint extract in the batter and frosting because I made the cake for my sister-in-law's birthday and she requested a chocolate mint cake. My personal prefenrence would to be to leave out the mint next time. The cake was excellent as the recipe states.

This cake was good, but not amazing. It was very easy to make, and baked up very well. It looked very impressive, but the taste didn't "wow" me or my family. I did not have enough cocoa to make the frosting, so I used a similar recipe that used a little less than 1 1/2 cups. I took the cake to a church dinner, and it was gone in 10 minutes! It definitely looks impressive, and it tastes good, but not wonderful! Thanks for the recipe.

I would rate the actual cake two stars because, despite following the directions carefully, I could not get the cake to depan without crumbling all over. I managed to salvage enough to eat, but it was not pretty! However, the frosting more than made up for the disastrous cake. It is so delicious. I use this frosting on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site...so amazing!

The cake is delicious and moist, and the frosting is AMAZING (not to mention versatile; I cut down on the powdered sugar and could easily find balance between bittersweet or for sweet tooth). Make sure to follow the reviewers' comments on substituting hot water for hot coffee. Unfortunately, while this cake was above average, I found it to be not quite not "THE" chocolate cake I've been looking for... very yummy but not excellent! The cake is a little bland alone.  The batter will be watery but it bakes up BEAUTIFULLY. I forgot to line the bottoms of my pans with parchment paper (a tradition) but the cake still came out easily, soft and not burnt at all. I filled three 8-inch pans half way through. Going over that amount made the cake rise too high.  To get rid of that unattractive dome that sneaks up in cake baking, pour the batter into the pans, lift them up about 4 inches or so, and bring them down forcefully or drop them on the countertop. Do this about 3 times, then put down the pan and spin it around a couple times. Repeat the dropping if you want reassurance. This lets out the air bubbles that causes the cake dome! YAY

This is the cake that is on the box of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa. The best chocolate cake I have had. Everyone who has tasted it agrees.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought this was very bland. Not very chocolately at all and very dry.  My mother and sister actually went out of their way to tell me how much they disliked the cake! I was very disappointed with the way it turned out..I was afraid to try the frosting.  I

Substituted espresso for the boiling water, but other than that followed the directions exactly.  This turned out gorgeous- soft and fluffy and delicious.  I used a chocolate ganache instead of the icing and the end result was quite impressive.

This was an excellent cake; however, I found the frosting was too heavy on cocoa so, I only used 1 cup and my family likes it much better.

This cake recipe is very good!  However, I did not care for the frosting (I prefer cream cheese frosting with this cake).  I have made this cake many times- it is easy and always good.  The recipe is perfected with two small variations-  I use hot coffee instead of the water and 1 full cup of cocoa powder. This makes a very chocolatey, moist cake that keeps for days.  Yum!

I had never made a cake from scratch and this cake turned out perfect.  Rich, moist and delicious.  The only variation I want to try next time is to reduce the amount of cocoa in the frosting. Great taste but could taste the powder slightly.

Great recipe- was incredibly moist (so moist that I would recommend using parchment paper under the cake so it doesnt stick at all to the pan). It really is one of those cakes that look and taste fantastic. It is not a fancy cake or one for those with refined tastes but is all around great and I would highly recommend it. I up the amount of cocoa and made it a little darker and less sweet and it was fantastic

I made this cake for my niece, who happens to love chocolate.  Our families agree it's the best chocolate cake ever!   Then I fixed it for some friends, and thought it was to die for.  I've given out the recipe to many.  Thanks Rachel!  I just read the reviews.  I don't understand why anyone would have any trouble making this cake.  It has turned out perfect everytime I've made it!  It comes out of the pans clean everytime.

I made this cake for my son's 10th birthday.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.  I'm not sure how the boiling water ruined anyone else's cake because mine came out just fine.  The batter is thinner than boxed cake mix batter, but once it was baked it was just fine.

The only thing I did different is that I didn't split the layers.  I just made it with 2 9" layers and reduced the frosting recipe quite a bit since I didn't need that much frosting.

This recipe is a keeper and I've already been asked to make it again!!!!

This was truly the richest and most moist chocolate cake I've ever had!  I love the texture of the cake, and with it split into 4 total layers, there's the opportunity to really taste the icing.  The recipe for the icing makes more than enough, so it was not hard to generously cover the cake.  I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone is still raving about it!

I can not explain to you how AMAZING this cake is. I have to admit, I was quite skeptical at first because of the few bad reviews/questions; but once I made it, I knew that the cake was something special. Let me tell you, the only way this cake won’t be five stars in your internal cookbook is if: 
1. You are not a fan of chocolate. 
2. You drastically mess up the recipe. 
Even if you are not a great cook, you can do it! I’m only a teenager and I have made this cake five times. It is great for your parents anniversary, valentines day, school project (very easy to decorate), and/or just for fun! 
Enjoy! I hope this was helpful.

This chocolate cake recipe is great! So easy to make and comes out moist every time. I have made this recipe about 5 times. 
My favorite type is cupcakes since this cake is so moist. 
The buttercream recipe connected to this recipe is 0 stars. It is awful. It is too sweet and does not compliment this wonderful cake. Peanut butter icing is actually a great pairing with this. 
Also, I used coffee (boiling) rather than water. I don’t know how it tastes with water. This batter will look like you did something wrong because it is so watery but I promose You, it will turn out fine. Enjoy.

Not only is this recipe super easy it’s soooo good. I made it twice. The first time I make it with the frosting that comes with the recipe but the second time I used a different frosting recipe because I thought it was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Other than that it’s literally perfect!

before making this I carefully went through most of the reviews from good to bad. and finally made this cake following most and adding 1 cup hot coffee instead of water. because I made it in a bunt pan I had to cook it 45 min instead of 35.  I let it cool and sprinkled with powdered sugar. the end review was amazing. this recipe is by far my favorite. so moist and super soft not dense. I'm not a fan of devil food cake. to dense and dry. but this was amazing. this is my now go to chocolate cake. and like some mentioned. yes batter is a little runny but still bakes just great.

This chocolate cake is simply divine! A lot of the flavor hinges on what type/quality of cocoa you use. It is definitely worth spending a bit extra and buying a top of the line cocoa. I use King Arthur Flour Bensdorp Dutch-Process Cocoa. You can buy it on Amazon. If you use this cocoa in this recipe you will have the best chocolate cake of your life.

*Note: using this cocoa I use slightly less in the frosting. I recommend adding 1/4 cup at a time to taste.

I followed the recipe exactly, down to using a timer for the beating, measuring everything and double checking, and it was a disaster. The middle sank way down, the sides got weird and crispy, and after 40 minutes it was still raw in the middle. For the first time ever I had to throw the entire thing out. I have NEVER had a recipe go this badly, I don't know what I did wrong :(

I made this first for my daughters birthday back in January but forgot to take a picture. My family loved this cake. It turned out super moist and fluffy.  Now it’s my granddaughters 10th birthday and she asked me to make it for her class. This time I used regular unsweetened Hershey chocolate in the cake but used special dark in the frosting. These came out decadent. Not sure if I want to send it into a 4th grade class lol. I made the recipe exactly as written

It came out ok, but it was waaaaay too sweet. We're not from the US, so it might be a cultural difference here, but it was too sweet for our taste.  Next time, I will try some replacements, maybe adding more cocoa and less sugar.

This was such a hit! My son said it's the best I've ever made (I've made a LOT of chocolate cakes). I added instant espresso powder to the boiling water as the video recommended. Didn't have quite enough unsweetened cocoa powder for the icing, so I used Dutch Process Cocoa! Excellent!

I made this with hot coffee instead of boiling water as the video versions suggested. I would have given it a five rating if the written recipe had given you the option of coffee as the video does. Should also cool the cakes longer in the pans. This is absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten!

A fantastic cake.  Follow the directions and you’ll be just fine.  I’ve made huge pans of this, tripled the recipe that is, and they were excellent too.

Would RACH56 please take a bow! With 2 changes of adding 1 cup cocoa instead of 3/4 cup, and adding piping hot coffee instead of water, this cake is AMAZING! Thank you so!

Wow, Ive always wanted to perfect a chocolate cake recipe and this is it! I made it just as the recipe reads. Used light aluminum pans, baked it for 30 mins. The frosting is a bit thick and was harder to spread, but wow, perfect! I would double the icing if I wanted to decorate it better, but it was simply perfect! I cant rave enough about it, honestly.

I'm not sure how this has such high ratings, with so many users reporting the exact same problems I encountered. I followed this recipe exactly. All ingredients were high quality and fresh. My oven and pans have worked perfectly for all other recipes. This made too much batter for two 9" rounds, so I made three. Even doing that, the batter rose and spilled over all three pans, making a huge mess! What batter was left in the pans did not cook in the stated 30-35 minutes. I had to let it go 45 before it even came close to passing the toothpick test. The layers were thin, and uneven in shape and texture. There is no way I would serve this, so into the trash it went. I can't tell you how it tasted (probably of smokey oven), or offer a review of the frosting, sorry. I will be trying another recipe today, now that my ovens are finally clean again.

I wish I could give this recipe zero stars. I made this twice. The first time I thought I must have missed an indregient or maybe tried taking the cake out of the pans too soon, but instead this recipe just makes a sticky mess that is near impossible to get out of the pans.

Do NOT bake this cake if you live in High Altitude.   I went to the trouble of baking this cake as a test run for an order I have.  It fell hopelessly.   There needs to be some adjustment for high altitude.

This is my go-to for a special chocolate cake!  It's the same as the "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake recipe printed on the side of the Hershey's unsweetened cocoa can.  I make no substitutions.  Just make sure to cook it long enough or it's goo in the middle.   Because this is so dense, rich and chocolaty, I use the lighter  Creamy Chocolate Frosting instead of a more fudgie one and top it with chocolate candy curls.  It's always a hit!

This is easily the best chocolate cake I've ever had! So moist and rich, and it's even easy to make! I used it for cupcakes (but did a french silk frosting instead of this one), and they were a HUGE hit! My coworkers went crazy for them! Even having read other reviews warning people about the liquidity, I was still worried about how soupy the batter was. I was very sure I'd done something wrong, but I went with it and threw them in the oven anyway, and they came out perfect!  A tip for others making cupcakes with this: pour the batter into something smaller and easy to pour from. Don't try to scoop it! I used a large measuring cup with a spout, and it worked wonderfully!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very crumbly. I left the cake in the pan for several hours to cool and it broke apart when I removed it. I greased with butter and flower. I think I will try again and grease with vegetable oil. I'll also try putting the cake in the refridgerator or freezer before removing from the pan, or maybe use parchment paper. The flavor was delicious so it would be worth ironing out the kinks.

I followed the recipe exactly (I didn't make the frosting) and it came out beautiful. I was worried about the thin batter but it baked well. I used a metal bundt pan and cooked it for 42 mins. Made the house smell lovely lol. I topped a slice of the cake with a spoon of cool whip and drizzled some caramel sauce over top. Very tasty.

I made this in a bunt pan. It only added about 10 minutes to the suggested cooking time. I also swiped out the H20 for hot coffee. Then, I added 3/4 C of semi sweet chocolate chips. Be aware, this will typically make the knife test of your cake fail (it will not come out clean due to the random choc chips throughout). However, it should only be minimal residue. I served this with a chocolate mousse butter cream. Talk about chocoholic sins. Fantastic. Next time I think I will fill it with fresh and lightly sweetened homemade whipped cream.

I used a 9x13 cake pan. I cannot get this cake to rise evenly. I tried cake sleeves and cooking longer at a lower temperature, but still nothing. Drastic differences across the cake. It looks fine up to about 80% of the cooking time, then gets funky. I should note that I only have Dutch process cocoa powder, so I had to swap the baking soda with baking powder as the chocolate has already been neutralized.

I wanted to  make a chocolate cake for my husbands birthday, but I'm tired of chemically produced box mixes. This was my very first cake from scratch complete with homemade icing! I made icing once 16 years ago for my sons first birthday and it was just awful. This cake was easy to make and so was the icing. I followed to recipe instructions to the letter (except I made it in a 9x13 pan) and the icing.. oh. my. goodness. Divine! I absolutely recommend making it as it's written first and adjust it to your own tastes. If you're not going to do the four layers as written (I didn't), you may want to halve the recipe for icing as it is quite a lot. I think I'll try this as cupcakes next time! YUMM

This was amazing! I'm not a chocolate fan but it was for my brother's bday and he LOVES chocolate. Super moist, not too sweet, yummy! I also added 1 cup of coffee instead of the boiling water. And I paired it with lemon frosting from this website too. Everyone loved it!

Delicious.  Not so rich or overpowering that you can't bear more than a couple bites, but decadent enough that you finish your [second...or third] slice completely satisfied and delighted with your decision to indulge.  Replaced vegetable oil with coconut oil (regular choice on my part).  
Though my taste buds were completely satisfied with the original recipe, I knew my decadent-dessert-loving husband would like even more money in this cake.  So the second time I made it, right before I poured the batter in the pan I lightly swirled in some peanut butter, dark chocolate shavings, and brown sugar.  Just enough to add a little extra boost of richness.  The peanut butter swirls looked pretty before I iced it, too!

I followed the recipe exactly, until I got to the milk. I used 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and a 1/2 cup milk (my on hand ingredients). I also used butter instead of oil. Although the pans were oiled and nonstick pans, there was still an issue with depanning--the bottom layer of each cake layer just did not want to release. I ended up with, well, with a chocolate bomb. It tried falling part, so I used the frosting like glue.  Other than that, great tasting cake.

This cake was very good & moist! I had to add a little more milk to the frosting for spread-ability, but otherwise it was very good as is. Definitely a keeper!

This is an amazing recipe. I read the reviews with difficulty getting the cake out of the pan and decided to use my trusty spring form pan. I also substituted the boiling water for boiled groumd coffee. I lined the bottom with Reynolds wrap non stick foil and waited 15minutes before removing the side of the pan. The foil slid off the bottom with great ease when it was completely cooled. I made a strawberry chocolate cake for my sister's sweet 16 and got rave reviews and requests for other birthdays. I filled the split layers with cream cheese frosting and canned strawberry topping and frosted with cream cheese icing pouring a dark chocolate ganache on top... I then arranged strawberries on top and it was quite pretty. And delicious!

Excellent recipe. Quick FYI; cake is not firm enough for layers. Used for cupcakes and they were great. I followed all directions and ingredients (added espresso powder to water for that enhanced chocolate flavor). Not oily, beautifully most and dark. Pulls easily from paper wrappers. Did not disappoint and for a soft, moist, dark chocolate cake I will look no further. For a cake to hold up to layers, I'd stick with Rose Levy Berenbaum recipes.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it! The only problem that I had was with the icing. The icing just didn't have the right icing taste. I added two packets of cream cheese to it and that then solved the problem. Overall the cake was moist and I will definitely be making this cake again.

Omg....I made this recipe yesterday into cupcakes..sooo delicious. Took it to the pub for a b'day...People were crazy for them...said they were absolutely the BEST they had ever tasted.  I did make a small change to the recipe though..as follows:  (By the way, I also increased the serving size to 36 so that change is reflected in my post).
I had no milk, only Silk True Almond, and not enough of that so I added the 2 cups, then to the 1/4 cup I had left, I added about half whipping cream and half water.
I decreased the water by 1/4 c. and also added 3 tbsp. brewed coffee.
They were sooo moist and delicious.
Cooked the cupcakes for 19 min 
I made them into Black Forest cupcakes by coring them...adding cherry pie filling and a combination of whipped cream, cream cheese and a small bit of icing sugar and topping them with that.
I live in B.C. Canada which is good to know as sometimes recipes work or don't work based on your altitude..
This recipes worked great here!!!
This will go down as my ONLY chocolate cake recipe!

This recipe was easy to follow and hands down THE best chocolate cake that I've tasted! Thought it was going to go bad as I placed the hot water and consistency was very watery but I know I followed everything to its very detail and had faith that it would turn out good. . . it was even BETTER than I would've imagined! it was not too sweet and VERY moist! A family favorite from now on!!! ??

This is the best chocolate cake!  I got rave reviews.  So moist, and delicious.  The only change I made was instead of boiling water, I added boiling coffee.  This is a keeper and the only chocolate cake I will ever make.  I'm done looking for the perfect recipe.  This is it!

I have baked hundreds of chocolate cakes over the last 40 years, and this is in my top 3. I have made it exactly as written.I was amazed how moist and delicious it was - it did not last long in my house. It is always important to use the specified pan size - the batter fit into 9' inch pans perfectly and baked up beautifully in 31 minutes. Because it is so moist, it is important to prepare the pans and cool at least 10 minutes before running a knife or baking spatula around the sides.

Came out great. Lacked intense chocolate flavor, but definitely tasted homemade and better than a cake mix. I might try adding more cocoa powder or cocoa flavoring next time.

I just made this cake tonight for my sons 13th birthday, and I must say it was amazing! The only changes I made were I substituted the milk for half and half, the oil for applesauce, and the water for fresh coffee. I greased and floured the pans and added a liner of parchment paper at the bottom. The cakes came out easily and beautifully. For a little fancy pants-ness, I grated hershey cholate bar on top. My son thinks I'm amazing now, btw. The last chcocolate cake I made was an utter disaster, but this cake has restored my faith in coco cakes. :)

This is probably the best chocolate cake recipe I have tried, however I feel compelled to mention that both the cake and frosting recipes are on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can.

Yummo! I used raw sugar instead of white and a cup of boiling coffee instead of water...it was delicious. Certainly a very runny, soupy mix but the end result is fudgy, moist and very, very moreish. I didn't ice it, just dusted it with icing sugar, it's quite sweet and chocolately anyway so we found that this was more than adequate to finish it. My friend (himself a big sweet tooth and a great baker) thought it was the best chocolate cake he had ever had-that's massive props!

This is a delicious chocolate cake perfect for any chocolate lover. I was making it for a party and everyone loved it! I upped the cocoa to 1 cup which made it that much better. The batter will be runny, don't worry. It turns out perfect in the end!

I've made this cake exactly as written and it was good. I also made it with coffee in place of the water and that is the trick to making it out of this world good. It bakes up beautifully in 25 minutes. Add some homemade cream cheese frosting and you'll never go back to the boxed mixes. Delish!!!

This was surely a CHOCOLATE CAKE.. it was more bitter than sweet but I used this cake and icing to make the m&M and kitkat cake.  The M&M and KitKat are so sweet that it compliments this cake perfectly!

2nd time:  I accidentally forgot to add the chocolate cocoa to the cake!  So I ended up with a yellow cake.  I still had to cook it an extra 20-30 minutes to get this cake to fully cook, but it still has a lava feel.  The icing is awesome!!! but makes a lot!  I gotta remember to put more in between the layers.

I've NEVER been able to make a good Chocolate cake. Perhaps that's why, even thought I read most of the comments for this recipe, I was still skeptical about how the outcome would be. THIS IS TRULY THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER! ...and the easiest by far!!!  So glad I tried it.

Cured my chocolate craving for sure!!! I substituted 1/2 of sugar with honey, and used applesauce for the oil. The cake was very moist. Loved the sweet frosting. Baked right at estimated time.

HOLY COW THIS IS GOOD! In the past I have tried SO many cakes and they all turned out the same way, crumbly, stick to the pan, tasting gross, etc. But then I saw this AWESOME recipe and it worked out PERFECT probably the best I have EVER made! Not only is this the best cake you will ever try, but it is the easiest cake you will make…ever!! I would rate this 500 stars if I could!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this AWESOME recipe!! I look forward to making it again!!!!

This cake is the BEST chocolate cake my family has ever had. We are extreme chocoholics here and this was perfect as-is.  We followed the recipe to the T and got a perfect cake that was gone quickly! I'm actually getting ready to make another one right now. :)

WONDERFUL! Followed directions except 1c coffee instead of water and was a little concerned about how thin the batter was but saw a lot of others said it was thin which was fine. Just really good.

So, accidentally, I did not put in any hot water. I was scared at first, but it turned out AMAZING and EXTREMELY RICH. My friends are absolutely obsessed. I am not saying to not follow the recipe, but try it without water to have an almost fudgey, delicious, rich chocolate cake!

Just made this for my husband's birthday and it was a fabulous cake.  The flavor was nice and chocolatey as well as incredibly moist.  Since there are only two of us I halved the recipe and it worked out very well.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.  The frosting was a little sweet (for me) but still delicious.

SUCH a good recipe, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to make a chocolate cake! Try adding 1/4 tsp. of mint extract and an already awesome recipe gets even better! The batter is a bit runny but it cooks well and the final product is moist and light.

This cake was absolutely wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly; it was so flavorful and moist... just perfection.   My daughters went crazy for it (with the chocoholics in my family, that's high praise!) Don't be alarmed at the thinness of the batter after adding the boiling water, it sets up beautifully.  This is now my default chocolate cake mix!

Too chocolatey. The texture was great, moist almost brownie like. The cake and the icing are both ok on their own but put together it is too much.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday & it was amazing!! I thought I ruined it because it was too liquidity after adding the boiling water. I didn't follow instructions, I continued to use the mixer instead of mixing it by hand. But, the cake still came out delicious!! I will definitely be making it again!!

This is by far THE BEST chocolate cake! I make a lot of cakes and when it comes to chocolate my family requests this one every time! Make sure you have milk on hand ssoooo good! Update 6/2016: this is still my go to chocolate cake recipe, except I make it even better but subbing the boiling water for boiling coffee!! It really deepens the flavor. Even people who don't like chocolate love my chocolate cake!

Made this recipe twice and it is the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever tasted! I made it with a couple of the reviewers suggestions, I "floured" the pans with cocoa powder, lined the pans with parchment paper and subbed the boiling water with freshly brewed coffee. Both times the cake has came out perfectly moist! I haven't uses the frosting recipe yet as my husband and I love a peanut butter frosting on our chocolate cake most of the time! Love this recipe thanks for sharing!

I rarely right reviews. My step son has autism, we keep on a very strict diet that exclude wheat and dairy. So a made 2 major modifications to this. I used all purpose gluten free baking mix ( from Costco) and I used coconut milk in place of cows milk. One other small modification I used coconut oil in place of veg oil because that's what I had.
 In the frosting recipe I used count milk and earth balance butter spread (soy free). It was amazing the texture was fantastic. 
 It was moist and delicious. The frosting is the best butter cream I have ever had. I can only assume this would be even better with wheat flour and dairy. Yum! Thanks for sharing. Please let people know this can be easily modified for someone with food allergies or intolerance. The fact that I wrote a review speak volumes about how much I loved this recipe.

i tried a few of chocolate recipes from this site but this is the best one! Finally! Its easy to make, I didnt change a thing and it came out moist and delicious not at all oily. Other recipes i tired didnt carry much flavour for some reason, but this one did :) i did put parchment paper in the pan since some members said it was sticking and it worked well. I've made this twice, last one was a birthday cake with cupcakes and everyone loveddddd it, adults and kids alike! cupcakes took a while to bake but were just as good. Thanks for this great recipe!

This cake was amazing! So rich and delicious! Followed the exact recipe, but used coffee instead of boiling water.  I was able to use all the batter with the Wilton round cake pans' they're pretty deep.  The batter was soupy but it baked well.  It was amazing, whole family loved it! This will be my "go to" chocolate cake recipe from now on!

This cake was awesome!!  I have very little baking experience & wanted something decadent, and was very nervous this was going to be too much.  It was pretty simple to make & it came out amazing.  The directions were very easy to follow & the video cleared up any questions I had.  Very happy with the entire experience here at allrecipes.com.

This is phenomenal. My mother made this for me for my birthday and my husband requested it again about a week later. I whipped this up and it's the perfect cake for a chocoholic. Rich, moist, chocolatey and delicious. If you're wanting to make a chocolate cake, MAKE THIS ONE.

Super yummy. I added some cream cheese to the frosting recipe with slightly (2-3 t.) less butter because I'm a fan of the tanginess along with the sweet. Other things to note re: another reviewer. You can absolutely make this recipe with dutch processed cocoa. It won't taste the same- dutch processed is generally not as intense a flavor, but in a good way. You also have to omit the baking soda and add another 1/4-1/2 tsp of baking powder. Otherwise the baking soda WILL flavor the cake in an unflattering way. If you're having problems with the cakes sticking, just use more shortening on the pan, and be sure to run a knife along the edges before you take them out. I'm a constant baker, but I tend to go for pies. This was my second attempt at a layer cake, and it turned out beautifully. It will probably be my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I made it for a passel of 22 year old boys and got more bear hugs than my ribs wanted by the time the night was over.

I have tried dozens of cake/cupcake/frosting recipes, and this is by far the best one out there. The cake is moist and delicious and the frosting is smooth and chocolatey. Don't be scared by the liquidy batter, your cake will be delicious.

Made ~30 cupcakes by baking ~ 15 min and filling the cupcake cups ~2/3 full (but wish I would have filled them just over half, some came over the top of the cups a bit more than I would have liked).  I also used buttermilk vs. regular milk because I had some I wanted to use up!  Iced w/ the fluffy peanut butter icing from this site.   Good reviews from guests.  Tops of them looked very shiny and unappealing to me w/o any icing, but it didn't affect the taste at all!

I was worried about how this cake would turn out because it took much longer to bake than the recipe states. (Anyone else have that problem? Maybe because the batter cooled between the time I added the boiling water and the time I put it in the oven.) However, it was delicious! The cake stayed moist and soft and the frosting was fabulous! Everyone at my daughter's birthday Party enjoyed it. SO Chocolatey! Just the way I like it! I did have a little trouble getting one of the cakes out of the pan (the cake broke in half but no one will know if you stick it back together and frost over it) so next time I will be sure to add parchment paper or something. Overall, LOVED this cake and will definitely make it again!

The taste of this cake was great. Very moist and chocolately without being overly sweet. The frosting had a great taste and texture. However, the cake didn't have good structural integrity. The edges flaked off easily as I frosted, making it hard to get a smooth finish. I am working with a new oven that doesn't seem to heat as evenly as the old one so it could be the oven's fault, but the frosted and finished cake broke apart in the car while I was transporting it (20 mins on a mild day). It tasted really good, but the cake just didn't hold together. I bake a lot and have never had a cake split in half on a car trip.

I resisted my initial impulse to omit the boiling water and made it as directed.  I followed all the directions, but this cake didn't have the consistence of cake and was too spongy for pudding.  Never again.

Omg! I just tried this amazing chocolate recipe yesterday and it was thee best chocolate cake I have ever made or had. My 6 year old-daughter helped me combine all ingredients so we doubled- checkedand followed the measurements. My husband had the first slice and he is usually not a fan of chocolate on chocolate cake... But dare I say..He loved it!!! He loved it so much within 2 minutes he cleaned the plate and asked for another slice lol. 
This cake is decadent, moist, and bursting with awesome chcolateness from your first bite. You must try this recipe... P.S. This was my first "from scratch" cake which is a hitt! Plus... Use Coffee** it totally brings out the rich chocolate cake flavor within the batter.

I followed the recipe for the cake almost exactly and was told by a co-worker that these were the best cupcakes he'd ever had.  Ever.  I have to agree - I don't normally do well with scratch cakes and this one was amazing.  The cake was even good without frosting.  The only changes I made:  I used dark chocolate cocoa, and I topped them with Simple & Delicious Buttercream Frosting and used vanilla bean paste in it. I made them in my convection oven as cupcakes; they baked for 25 minutes at 325 degrees. They were just perfect - this is going to be my go-to recipe from now on.  Thank you!

This the best recipe ever!! This is a cake you can make a few days ahead of time and still know it will be super moist. I have never had any one not like it.

I just made this for my Mother in-laws 60th party and did 2 double recipes to fill a large sheet pan twice. 1 batch of icing for the filling and almost a double batch to ice it. Everyone loved it. You wont go wrong with this.

Wow...I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe thinking that there might be one here that was better than my old stand by recipe, which I have been making since the 80's and love dearly. I picked this one due to it having such rave reviews and being a staff pick. Wasn't I surprised to find that it is indeed the SAME recipe that I have and have been making for years! I cut it out of a womans magazine in the early 80's. LOL! Guess I will stick to my tried and true and try the frosting recipe that accompanies this recipe. BTW it was a recipe featured in a Hershey's cocoa advertisement, but I have had luck using any unsweetened cocoa powder.

This is the easiest recipe with the best results.  I've made this several times now and it is now my go to Chocolate Cake recipe.  I bake all the time and my previous recipe was great, but this is brilliant and also very forgiving. I was distracted and forgot the boiling water once and the cake still turned out great, a little dense but still a great flavor and soooooooooo moist!

I made this for my mom's 52nd birthday and even the adults RAVED over this cake (we aren't big cake fans).  My husband said this is the first time he's liked the cake more than the frosting!  A moist and fluffy cake, I used strong coffee instead of water for a stronger chocolate flavor (you can't taste the coffee).  I also sifted the dry ingredients together and used extra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil (you can't taste the oil).  The batter will be extremely thin.  I made the following adjustments for high altitude (between 5,000 and 7,000 feet):  1 3/4 c sugar, 1 3/4 + 3 Tbsp flour, 3/4 c + 1 Tbsp cocoa powder, 1 1/4 tsp each baking soda and powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/4 c milk, 1/2 c vegetable oil, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 c + 2 Tbsp boiling strong coffee.  I followed the instructions exactly, with the exception of sifting the dry ingredients together before adding in the wet.  Happy baking!

Flat out disaster. I decided to make this cake for my Hubby's b-day. It literally fell to pieces. The crumbs were good. I used three cake pans. Pam baking spray for the pans. The cake baked up beautifully, I let it cool for 15 minutes one crumbled while taking it out the pan. The second crumbled after it came out of the pan, and the third came out of the pan perfectly than a big crack like a canyon split straight through the middle doing the frosting process. I was trying to use regular vanilla classic frosting from the store.  I gave it two stars because the crumbs were delicious. However this was very embarrassing as well as the worse kitchen disaster I ever had. If you try it don't try it on a special day

Excellent and easy cake recipe! Followed recipe exactly as written and it turned out moist and delicious.  I made this for my chocolate loving daughter's birthday and she loved it! Frosting is rich and the perfect consistency for spreading. Will NEVER make a boxed cake again! Thank you for this great recipe.

I just made this cake, and it tastes and looks good, but I have a few problems. 

1.After I added the water, the batter was very runny, and so it took about an hour to cook.  

2. After it baked, it was very rubbery, even though the toothpick came out clean.  

3. It said use TWO 9-inch pans, but I only had enough batter for one. 

Maybe i just did it wrong. After all, I'm only twelve.

This cake is the chocolate BOMB!!I did exactly as the recipe said. I didn't think I'd have enough frosting with the four layers so I kind of skimped on them but I did have enough in the end so next time I make it I will put a decent layer of frosting in between. I made this for someone at works birthday and everyone loved it. Ended up printing several copies of this recipe for them. It was absolutely scrumb deli-ousish!!! I can't say enough about it.

Very rich and chocolatey! Instead of the cup of hot water I added a cup of hot coffee.  Has anyone made cupcakes with this recipe? If so, what alterations did you or would you make?

Made it for our friends' 25th anniversary. She's a chocolate cake lover. I made it in a 12" milton round pan from hobby lobby, only 1 layer, 3 days ahead & left it in pan. I needed the full amount of icing. As icing was thick I added a little bit of milk, I put 4 cups of sugar instead of 5 1/2, used coffee instead of water (as all advised) 
I covered it with fondant. It was a great hit. 1st time I see people taking 2nd & 3rd of a cake. They asked 4 recipe as well. Thanks :)

Wow this was great!  After sitting out for a bit the cake seems to have dried out and I wonder if adding a dry pudding mix and some sour cream to the blend somehow will help.  But really, as it is, it's pretty great.  The frosting is PERFECT consistency.  I always have a hard time making buttercreams and this was one was like store quality...but tastes MUCH better!  I can't wait to share it with the family.

Great texture and flavour... moist and light. I'm not sure what I did wrong as they fell apart when i took them out of the pans- I had greased and floured them, and removed them from the pans about 2 hours after cooling. Oh well, it was just for hubby and me, we'll still eat it as it really is delicious!

Such a yummy cake. I have to agree with some of the reviews that said it is a mouth watering eyes roll in the back of your head kind of cake. My only criticism is that it wasn't the prettiest cake. If your looking for a cake to make for like a birthday cake that you want to look nice I would pass of this. I made two cakes and some cup cakes all of them fell and where very difficult to get out of the pans. I actually bent my pan a little trying to get it out. I would suggest if you do make this cake that you use lots of cooking spray much more then you would normally and that you use a spring form pan other wise the cake will stick to the pan. Also if you make cupcakes I would spray them as well. Perfect recipe if you want to make a mouth watering cake that is so much better then any other cake you have probably ever eaten. Horrible if you want a pretty cake.

terrific.  I baked this and the Banana Cake IV by Cindy Carr.  I assembled them both into a layer cake, with the cream cheese icing between the 4 layers, and the chocolate icing on the outside.  

Soooo good

I made this cake today and it is sooo moist. I didn't do a layer cake but used a Bundt tin and also instead of adding boiling water I added 1 cup of coffee. I would make this cake over and over again it sure is a winner in my house. Thank you for sharing

Thanks for this great recipe ! I was trying to find a moist chocolate cake that cuts well and easy to make, well, this is it! I loved the icing too, so easy to use. Given the humidity in Singapore, it is not easy to find a homemade icing that is tasty and easy to handle without it melting as soon as it touches the cake. I would use lesser sugar next time (personal choice), I bake only half of the recipe in a bundt pan to try the recipe. I forgot to butter my silicon pan but I am happy to say, the cake turn out beautifully. I left it in the pan for more 15 mins and gently loosen the side, possible only with silicon pan. For  those baking the first time, my cake looks wet (as in uncooked) even though my stick comes out ok. Try tapping on the cake, if it is firm, then it's cooked.

I made this cake today and boy was it great! I did make one change- instead of water, I used a few others' suggestions and used 1 cup of strong coffee. It really enhanced the flavor of the cake and it was so moist. I also only filled each pan 1/2 full and had a bit of batter left, so made a few cupcakes. I iced it with vanilla butter creme frosting, and just left it as a 2 layer cake. My family (even my 15 month old) loved it! Thanks for this awesome recipe! It's a definite keeper!

This recipe is a family favorite at our house.  When someone says they want a chocolate cake for their birthday, I know EXACTLY which one they want...this one!  I use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa or other specialty cocoa if I have it available.  Otherwise, make it as stated.  It's incredible!

This is the same recipe that I found in a magazine some 32 years ago.  Its my go-to chocolate cake....my kids' favourite, my favourite. I used to do a boiled frosting for it but then discovered buttercream...cook 1/4 cup flour with 1 cup of milk, stir til it gets thick and goopy.  Cool it.  Beat 1 cup softened butter and 1 cup of sugar til fluffy.  Add the goopy cooked milk/flour mix and beat it til smooth.  Add a tsp of the best vanilla you have and beat again.  Fabulous!!

I made this recipe for a fancy birthday cake and at first I was really skeptical. The batter was SOOooo runny. Several reviews had talked about the same issue, but it was even more than I expected. HOWEVER, it baked up beautifully. It didn't get a rounded top like most baked items, but that was great for me because I didn't have to level off the cakes to layer them. They were nice and flat and uniform. I didn't make the frosting, but by looking at the recipe, I would think it would be way too sweet for how sweet the cake already is. I made buttercream for the birthday cake, but I think even cool whip would suffice.

Simply delicious! This chocolate cake was so easy to make and held up so well! This icing is fabulous and very rich. My family and I LOVED this cake! I didn't split the two cakes in half to make four. I just made it a two layer cake and halved the icing (also very easy to do). By only making half the icing I had just enough to coat the center and the entire exterior of the cake with a thick coating of icing and no left overs. I read other people saying that the recipe makes a lot of icing and they had so much left over so I just cut all the ingredients in half and it was perfect!! ENJOY!!

I was happy to find this recipe here. This is one fantastic chocolate cake! I used brewed coffee instead of water because I love that mocha flavor, and made my own chocolate peanut butter frosting. This is pretty close to perfection and everyone loved this cake!

Made this into cupcakes. Used the exact ingredients on the cake and was also concerned about the thiness of the batter. I ended up with 23 cupcakes, filling them 2/3 full. The frosting, I didn't have enough cocoa and used just less than 1 cup. The frosting was light and fluffy. I liked the frosting more than the cake. Frosted the cupcakes and still had about 3/4 cup of frosting left over which never happens when I buy the store bought kind. The cake was a lot lighter than the boxed type but the frosting was much better. I would give the cake a 4 star and frosting a 5+ stars even with less cocoa.

I really loved how this cake turned out. I thought I messed up because the batter was really runny, but once it baked, it was amazing. Boxed chocolate cake just doesn't cut it anymore in this house!

This recipe was great. It was pretty easy to make also. I messed up and added the boiling water right into the wet ingredients and it still turned out fine. My daughter has a milk and soy allergy so we used almond milk rather than regular milk and canola oil rather than vegetable oil. We used the cake batter to make cake pops. They turned out great. We cooked them for 20 mins the first time and they were done when we checked them. The second batch we put in the oven for 17 mins. They were done also when we checked them. They didn't taste dried out though thanks to this extra moist cake batter. The second batch seemed to be very close to the right time. Because of her allergy we used a little bit of Hershey's syrup on the cake pops to wet them a bit for the sprinkles to stick. Enjoy!!

Amazing!  I have tried lots of chocolate cake recipes and this is by far the best.  I made this for my dad's 60th birthday and it was met with rave reviews.  Really moist, nice and chocolatey, and the frosting is amazing.  I did have to add a little extra milk to the frosting to get it to a smooth consistency, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Even my husband, who is not a cake eater, went back for seconds!  This is my new "go to" chocolate cake recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the recipe for the cake, except that I sifted the dry ingredients.  I did this in hopes that the cake would be lighter since home made cakes tend to be dense.  It worked.  The cake was fluffy and delicious.  I cut the frosting recipe in half, partly because I didn't have enough powdered sugar to do the whole recipe but I'm glad I did.  Half the recipe of frosting was more than enough to fill and frost the cake.  I had to add a little more milk than the recipe calls for because the frosting was very thick before adding the extra milk.  Everything turned out great.  This cake was for my mother-in-law's birthday and she loved it.

This is just a basic chocolate cake. Had a nice chocolate flavor. Not the most moist chocolate cake, not dry either.  I substituted cake flour, which I personally prefer for texture.

I love how easy and simple this recipe is I see the reviews stating that its from a packet so dues to the company and thank you for posting it, I tend to only ever bake cupcakes (18mins - 180'c my ovens not the best so adjust to suit you) they dome really well and are so light and moist.

As for the frostings I add different essences peppermint goes so well with this for a Christmas feel add green or red colouring.

Amazing!  I made this for my husbands 51st birthday and he was very happy with it.  I was a little concerned at the frostings consistency - I thought it would be to stiff.  Boy was I wrong, it actually tasted like fudge and was a huge hit.  If you're not in love with rich frosting, this recipe might be too much for you.  

Thank you for sharing.

this  recipe is excellent. i intentionally used normal sugar instead of icing sugar to great effect. yes the icing sauce was very sweet but i have to say it was very popular with everyone. there was a crunchy sugar aroma in my mouth which was a bit like chewing sand (or sugar) so i had to cook the sugar away for ages because my it was sweet but now its okay. drawback was too much icing. 

best cake i ever made.

If I could give this 10 or 100 stars I would.  My family calls this my "famous chocolate cake" and just goes wild over it every time I make it.  I really think it's the boiling water at the end that makes it so moist.  The frosting is not too sweet and makes for a lovely cake.  My family thinks it's better than the bakery cakes.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I made this cake for my son's 5th Birthday (monster trucks). I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was amazing! Everyone raved about how amazing it tasted. I used the frosting in between the layers but used a white buttercream recipe to make it green for the outside. It was amazing! Thank you for such an amazing and easy recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. We like to use espresso instead of boiling water. And as yummy as the icing is, I also like to make a espresso flavored icing to help prevent chocolate overload!
I can't figure out what has been different from time to time, but sometimes the cake spills over in the oven, while sometimes it does not.

Made this for a gathering today. It got RAVE reviews. Next time, I might cut back on the cocoa in the frosting a bit; it was very rich. I upped the ante by pressing chopped almonds into the sides. We had NONE left over at the end of the day. :)

I have made this cake twice, following the directions exactly each time. Both times I've made it, the cake will not release from the pan! I grease and flour my pans, just like I do for every other cake recipe, but this cake just doesn't come out easily. When it does come out, its crumbly and so it's hard to frost. Today when I made it, I just decided to make cake balls instead of an actual cake since it was so crumbly. I'm sad that it didn't work for me, because I really like the taste! I won't be making this cake again.

This cake is wonderful! I would probably not have tried the recipe had it not been for all the ratings.  I wouldn't change one thing about the recipe.  This cake is best if you wait for atleast 2 hours to eat after removing from the oven, the texture changes a bit.  It is very light and airy when it comes out of the oven, once it settles a bit it takes on a perfect light/dense texture.  It competes with bakery grade cakes!  Yummy!

Seemed too easy to be 5 stars - but it's really delicious. Only made 1/2 the icing as recommended, and even that was too much. Added coconut for extra flavouring in the icing. Tasty and simple; high recommended.

This cake was excellent, and so easy to make. It was definitely better the next day. I did not have the same problems as some of the other reviewers; I lined my cake pans with buttered wax paper to avoid the cakes sticking to the pans, and once out, they held together well for frosting. I made a two layer cake only, with frosting from the back of the Hershey's can.

This cake was good. Nothing fabulous, but a good, basic chocolate cake recipe. I follwed to a T and the result was what I expected. The yield is off - I doubled for 24 servings but instead got 44 cupcakes! No need to add coffee for the water...this recipe is good as is with no changes.

Works great for a blackforest cake too! Use a sugar syrup (plain or fruit flavored) to moisten one layer of the cake after splitting. Add slightly sweetened whipped cream and spread then add another layer and repeat for all 4 layers. Once done, spread whipped cream over the sides and top and decorate with chocolate shavings and strawberries.

This cake was incredible! I halved the recipe, substituted coffee for water, and baked it in a 9x9. My family ate half of it before I even got a chance to frost it! A very brownie-like cake, moist but light. Definitely recommend this one.

Delicious! Very moist and rich without being too sweet (although I didn't use the icing, so I cannot comment on it). It was also very easy to make.

I am not a chocolate cake fan, but my husband is.  His favorite cake is a HoHo Cake.  We've used this recipe at least three times.  The first time, I took this recipe and used a buttercream frosting and added 1/2 bar of chocolate to make a light chocolate buttercream frosting the first.  The 2nd time, we decreased the cocoa in the frosting to 3/4 cup.  Originally we gave it a 4-star, but we found a recipe that we like better that had coffee in it.  Chocolate cakes get boring...  This cake was very moist, but I need something different.

Really good cake. I veganized it and it came out almost perfect. I added a teaspoon of almond extract just to give it an extra layer of flavor. 
The icing is amazing!

THIS NEEDS 20 STARS!!!!!!
OMG I made this last night and when i tell you it is the BEST DARN CHOCOLATE CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD!! The frosting was to die for and the cake was soooo moist it should be a flippin sin!  I did use coffee instead of water and i made sure i greased the pans well. Other than that I followed the recipe to the T.  This is now my recipe for life! I am doing the happy dance just thinking of a slice!!!!

Yummy Yummy :) I have made this cake a few times always turns out great but I had to go & play around. Twice I have used dark beer instead of water amazing! The sweetness of the icing & the moistness of the cake against the darkness of the beer oh yes! Stone Brewing I salute you & your Imperial Russian Stout

I find that this cake is way to sweet! I bake often and tried this its pretty good just way to much sugar. I also used a different icing so not judging that. I also used gluten free flour and it did came out moist.

Turned out great! The frosting was a little too thick for me though, so I put a little more milk in it (like 1/3 cup) and it was perfect!

Love this! I halfed the recipe to fill 4 little ramekins. I wanted individual portions just for myself. I added 3/4 cups of sugar (instead of 1 cup) and it was just sweet enough for my liking. For the oil I actually added very litte, about a tablespoon. Replaced it with a little more milk. It was soooooo moist and fudgy. The batter does come out looking runny, but that is the key if you want a nice fudgy texture. I also let the batter sit a little while before putting it into the containers because it allows the flour to soak up some of the liquid. Overall GREAT RECIPE and i would recommend it to anyone.

Delish! I used 1 cup of agave instead of sugar, substituted eggbeaters and replaced oil with plain greek yogurt. I skipped the icing suggested here and alternated layers of cake with the Ghirardelli Chocolate Mousse recipe from this site. A very tasty combo!

Definitely a solid recipe. Tastes very similar to pillsbury's devil's food mix without the chemicals and such! It is missing the pudding flavor though. It's a basic chocolate cake. I didn't find it out of the world - maybe I should use hot coffee instead of boiling water next time! Also I tried the icing recipe and it did not come out well for me, but the cake was good.

This is the best chocolate cake that I've ever made.  It was nicely moist.  Use a high grade cocoa powder (not hershey's).

It was nice and moist, but could have been a little sweeter. I do have a huge sweet tooth thought. My Dad and sister said it was amazing. As suggested by others I used 1 cup of cocoa instead of just 3/4. I think that was a great idea.

This was a-mazing. I'm thrilled to have finally found a chocolate cake that is rich but not (too) sugary! The icing was fantastic and even with all the powdered sugar it still didn't taste only like powdered sugar! Just incredible. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup butter instead of oil. I did have problems getting the cakes out of the pans...and then when I started icing 1/8 of the cake just crumbled off and wouldn't be pasted on with icing. I've never had such a cake fiasco! I don't know if that was because of the butter or not...I'll have to try it with oil and see if it holds together better. But that is no reason not to try this recipe! It was so moist and tasted so good I didn't care that it looked like cliffs that had fallen into the ocean ;) Also, I didn't do 4 layers-I don't think that would even have been possible with the shape of my cakes :P There was extra icing, which was great-I'm always scared I'll run out! Oh, and I baked, cooled, and frosted the cake 1 day before I served it-SO GOOD! I plan to use the icing separately for a less chocolate cake in the near future :)

Best chocolate cake my family has ever had. Was easy to make directions were a breeze to follow. I am going to omit the coco to make a white cake next. Now need to find a good white frosting as the chocolate was great but need white on white. Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated . Thank you for a great recipe

It is so easy, I will never buy boxed cake mix again. Very moist, very delicious, and very versatile. I'm glad I found it on allrecipes.com so the printed recipe matches the rest of the great recipes I've found here! Thanks!

Update: This has now been my go-to cake for years and we still love it! I love that the boiling water keeps it moist without adding any extra fat. I always reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and we can't tell any difference. It's also great with cream cheese icing! 
I've made this twice now and it truly is amazing! Tastes just like Crave Cupcakes in Calgary. Once I made it in two round pans and the other time in 12 regular cupcakes and 24 minis. I've found that if you don't fully cook it to the point where it's started to pull away from the sides of the pan then it will be too moist and not come cleanly out of the pan.

I was craving chocolate cake and this recipe seemed to fit the bill with the ingredients I had on hand. I halved the recipe and made both regular and mini cupcakes with it, and all fell slightly in the middle (I prefer a rounded top to easily frost). It came out very moist, not too dense, but lacked the cake-like springiness I was looking for. I paired it with the Rich Chocolate Frosting on this site and the frosting way overwhelmed the cake. I think a more mellow milk-chocolate frosting would go best with this cake's flavor.

DELICIOUS.
This entire cake was gone in 2 days at my house- and it's so easy to make!
I'm 15 years old and cakes aren't exactly my forte, but it turned out great! I frosted it and dusted with powdered sugar.

my new default chocolate cake. i will never get store bought mix again, this was so easy and 100x better tasting than any other chocolate cake ive ever had! i followed all the instructions to the "T". a word of caution, this makes a lot of batter. you should split it into three standard 9'' rounds so it doesn't overflow in the oven, unless you have the extra deep round cake pans to accommodate the extra batter. the frosting is perfect, but its definitely a LOT of chocolate to handle all at once when its on the cake. great recipe, thanks!

**** UPDATE **** Tried this again GLUTEN-FREE!  Instead of the flour, substituted Bob's Red Mill All-Purpose Flour (1 for 1) and added 1 tsp of guar gum.  The cake still came out light, fluffy, and delicious!

--------------------------------------------------

wowie-wow-wow!  This recipe makes a fabulously delicious, moist, chocolatey cake.  I am ashamed to say that I am the queen of boxed cake mixes as I think they're typically good enough, inexpensive, and quick.  However, I wanted to make a special cake for my boyfriend's birthday and he requested something very chocolately.  This recipe seemed to fit the bill.  I read some of the reviews and worried that my batter would overflow the pans, so I placed a cookie sheet on the shelf below.  However, being the expert cake baker that I am (haha!), I noticed that the cakes weren't rising at a pace that I'm used to, so half way through, I removed the cookie sheet and the cakes rose beautifully without overflowing their pans.  When the cakes were cool, they were a little too moist to easily frost, so I refrigerated them for an hour to firm them up.  This seemed to do the trick. The frosting is divine.  Creamy, smooth, decadent.  The cake got rave reviews, but most importantly, my boyfriend was so happy.  Thank you for sharing such a fabulous recipe!  I'm a fan!

Made this for my sweet-toothed husband's birthday.  He was begging for a dense but moist chocolate cake.  The cake came out beautifully, with four glorious layers of chocolate upon chocolate.  Hubby was thrilled.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Testing this recipe for cupcakes.  Did not put all of the water in the batter, as it looks very thin. Hope it comes out alright.

Mmmm... Stunning! I've adapted this recipe to make it gluten free twice with a ganche icing and it was well received. It was rich and moist - people didn't even know it was GF. Best made the day before and chilled.

Wow! I have made chocolate cakes from scratch before, and they always turned out fine but... meh. Nothing that justified the extra work from making a box cake. This.. THIS! OMG. You've got to try it. My only complaint is that I can't stop myself from eating the entire cake (I couldn't even wait for frosting) this morning as soon as it got out of the oven, so just be warned it will come with like 10 extra pounds :) It's that incredible! Definitely my go-to cake recipe for every function now!

Oh my God this cake was absolutly amazing. I followed the recipe to the letter and made no changes except that I used a cream cheese frosting because I am not a fan of buttercream. I had been searching for a chocolate cake recipe that used ingredients from scratch and tried about 5 others before this one. This cake is so good and rich that you can add frosting if you want or just eat it plain. Its decadent, flavorful, moist I could go on and on. Thanks to the contributor of this recipe for submitting this. It is now going in my family recipe book.

I made this over new years and followed the recipe exactly as written.  This was wonderful, moist and very decitent.  You might want to add a little more milk in the frosting, other than that it was the perfect chocolate cake. Recommend it highly

The cake part of this recipe was to die for! So moist and chocolately! Next time I will cut the frosting part in half--it made way too much for the cake and I ended up throwing alot of it away.

This recipe really deserves 4.5 stars. I've made it about four times following the suggestion of someone who had previously reviewed and instead of boiling water, I substituted it with coffee. It has come out delicious and perfect every single time! Just make sure you don't overbake. A family favorite!

Absolutely wonderful!  I substituted dark cocoa powder in the cake, but kept the regular cocoa in the frosting.  The dark chocolate kept it from getting too sweet for me.

Also, this is one of the easiest and best uncooked chocolate frostings. Superb.

This is so amazingly moist! I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted half of the oil with 1/4 cup of applesauce (I didn't dare replace all of it since it was for my son's birthday cake!) But I think next time I'll try substituting all the oil with applesauce. Definitely recommended!

Haven't tried the frosting yet but the cake is great!  Had to make a "test" cake to see if this would fit in a 12 in pan and it does, so now making the final layer!  For a 60th anniversary party that the baker forgot she would be away that weekend!  And you have chocolate at a party!  We tried it with just chocolate syrup for the test, and it's fantastic!!!!!

I get rave reviews on this cake - have made it for 2 birthdays now.  Consistent delicious results both times!  

Only change - didn't use the frosting - used store bought vanilla so I could colour the frosting and decorate.

I made it for our anniversary and everyone loved it!  It was very good and very chocolaty.  It was like a chocolate cake that you get a restaurant.  The only thing I changed was that I used cake flour instead of all purpose to get a more tender crumb.

This was really good, I've never added water to any cake I've made but decided to give it a try. It didn't taste any better or worse than any other chocolate cake I've made so it wasn't anything super special, but it was really moist!! Next time I may try adding hot coffee instead of the water, only reason I didn't try it this time was because I was making it for a children's party & figured they really didn't need the added caffeine lol!!

WOOOWWW!!! This cake is amazing! It's true what other reviewers say about the cake batter being very thin after adding the boiling water. I didn't have any problems with the cake batter overflowing, it just rose up a lot while cooking. But as you're waiting for it to cool the dome falls back down to a nice even level. I did find it hard to split the layers since the cake is so moist. This is easily the best cake I have ever tasted. It's very rich, very good chocolate taste. The cake is that perfect consistency you expect from a bakery. Right after it was done I ate 2 slices, it was that amazing.

Delicious cake *and* icing!  It's moist and super chocolaty and fantastic with a cup of coffee.  The only change I made was to use coffee in place of the water.  The only thing I wasn't too keen on was that it didn't raise very tall. Also as other reviewers stated...batter is very thin. Otherwise, great!  It's a keeper! :)

Best chocolate cake I have ever had! I did have a little difficutly though. Make sure the cake is completely cooled before assembling. I cooled for about 30 minutes before splitting the layers by the time I put the final cake layer on top the entire cake started to sink and the icing was oozing out. I panicked wanting to save my beautiful cake so if you have the same problem do what I did. I doubled heavy duty foil and wrappped it around the outside of the cake to hold everything together, then I refridgerated it for about 30 minutes. I then continued frosting and the cake turned out amazing, you would never know that at one point it was on the verge of disaster. Even though I had problems that were more my fault I still give it 5 stars, the taste and texture were heavenly!!

Dense, moist and super rich.  I made half the amount of icing and it was the perfect amount. I had enough to ice my entire cake and pipe some rosettes around the top and bottom with some leftover. Definitely, makes a lot of icing! I also chopped up some Daim (ikea chocolate) for the filling, and it went over well.

This chocolate cake is great!...Very moist and delicious.  The frosting is very good but rich.  This recipe is only for true chocolate lovers!  Even if it's too much with them both together the cake would taste great with other frostings as well.

This cake was great! At first I was worried about how thin it was but it came out great, and the frosting was great it is a better recipe than I usually use. I have been trying to find a recipe that I can try and compare to Portillo's because that is my boyfriends favorite and he said that this was the closest yet.

Don't hesitate to use strong coffee as a substitute for the boiling water as recommended by pingdk.  I also can recommend frosting this cake with a cooked vanilla icing.  I get asked to make this for familly birthdays.  It's the best!

To be fair, I reviewed this by NOT making any changes to the recipe. The cake was excellent but I will use an existing recipe I have for the frosting next time. To me, the frosting was just good - just not outstanding.  I thought the cake, however, was outstanding :)

If you haven't noticed, this is the exact same recipe as one bowl chocolate cake 3. Tastes awesome- just like devils food cake from a box mix. I've made cupcakes and an ice cream cake from this recipe. Delicious and easy.

It is excellent and there is also a mexican version with brewed dark coffee and cinnamon.  The icing is simple to make.  It is extremely moist and I always get several compliments...don't plan on any left overs!

This is the very first homemade cake I've ever done. Super Easy! OMG! It was SO GOOD!!! It was very moist. I topped mine with a few strawberries. I also cut some strawberries and added them to the bottom edge. I thought this would add a little color.

Best chocolate cake BY FAR. This is my go to recipe, it is the perfect special occasion cake. The icing makes a very generous amount, more than enough for the four layers. So if you're planning not cutting the two cakes (like I do some of the time), take the quantity of icing into consideration. Amazing cake, be sure to give it a try!

I was looking for a good, "made from scratch" chocolate cake recipe because all of the other ones I've tried before never tasted quite right. This one is amazing! It has the moistness of a store bought cake, and the flavor to match. I mixed the batter as directed, but used cake flour instead of all-purpose. I also sifted all of the dry ingredients together before mixing in the wet. Just to make sure the leaveners were evenly dispersed. I baked in two 9 inch round pans for 35 minutes and they came out perfect. So delicious. I didn't make the frosting though, I made my own vanilla frosting for the outside and filled the layers with chocolate fudge. I will definitely use this in place of store-bought mixes for all my cakes now. Thank you for this recipe!

I agree this is a very rich moist cake, the batter is very thin but bakes up nicely, thank you for sharing it. But the same recipe is also on the back of the Hershey's cocoa container. I have been making this same cake for over 30 years now. Cream cheese frosting goes very well with cake.  A 9x13 pan can also be used, about 25-30 minutes in the oven. I'm giving 5 stars even though it is not an original recipe.

I made this cake for "National Chocolate Cake Day" and everybody absolutely loved it! It was so rich that it was hard to finish a whole piece! My husband had a "guy's night" the day after I made it so I sent the cake along with him for the men to finish off, and I got soooo many compliments from the guys! Definitely a hit! I am going to make it for my grandmother's birthday because she is a chocolate lover!

Awesome cake recipe!  I used it as a base for my black forest cake.  Best ever!  I did tweak it by using black cocoa powder (this makes it really dark) and in place of the water, a cup of strong hot coffee.  The coffee bonds with the chocolate so well.  You get a rich chocolate cake that is indeed really black in color.

Tasty and definitely sweet. Too sweet for my low threshold. I made it as directed and others seemed to dig it. I prefer the Dark Chocolate Cake I recipe.

Awesome!!! I usually don't make cake from scratch, preferring to use a mix. I will always use this recipe for chocolate cake! I didn't have round pans, so I made 12 cupcakes and an 8x8 cake. I probably could have halved the icing recipe, it was too much.

Followed recipe exactly. Turned out very yummy, although was not tall enough to warrant cutting cake layers in half. I filled the inside with raspberry curd,  frosted the cake with the given frosting recipe, and garnished the top with sliced almonds. The frosting got rave reviews. 

Warning: grease the pan thoroughly! I tried to just spray it with Pam and the cake stuck to the bottom.

After baking this cake I've been told by many chocolate lovers that this is THE BEST cake they've ever tried. It is incredibly rich, moist, and chocolatey--the ULTIMATE death by chocolate. Don't be discouraged by the runny batter because it bakes beautifully. The only thing I tweaked was the frosting--I reduced the sugar quite a bit (over 5 cups of sugar is way too sweet for my liking), taste-testing until it met my preference (probably somewhere near half the original amount). Just a warning, though: you only need a small slice of this cake because it is extremely filling. I am begged constantly to make this recipe. I am certain that there exists no better recipe for chocolate cake than this one.

Out of this world. If you love chocolate this is the cake for you. Very good and moist. I had no problems with it being crumbly as some other reviewers. I did make the cake one day before needed and it was perfect. I only made a two layer cake, each a 9inch pan size. The frosting was fantastic too, I even licked the bowl after frosting the cake. :)

Yummy.  Warning: it has a slight dark chocolate taste and it is not super moist.  
LOVED the frosting! It was more milk chocolaty.

Love this cake recipe!  The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe I made it as a cake, today I made it as peanut butter/cream cheese stuffed cupcakes with a chocolate buttercream frosting.  Either way, DELICIOUS and well received!

AMAZING! the cake was so good! fluffy, moist and chocolaty. I halved the recipe since it was just 3 of us eating it. I would have like to try the frosting, I ruined it by not having powered sugar on hand so I tried making some for the first time in my food processor w/ some corn starch. Was very disappointed with it, it was too griddy. so I opted for a chocolate ganache filling and whipped frosting top. I made it for my chocoholic of a husband's birthday... Thank you for sharing. I will never buy chocolate cake out of a box again!

OH MY!!! What a delicious, rich, moist chocolatey cake!!  I made it exactly as written and it came out great!  Make sure to use a 9 inch pan, or it may bubble over like some other reviewers mentioned. I was a little unsure how it would be after adding boiling water because the batter was so runny, but it was great!   I wasn't a huge fan of the frosting, but the cake was amazing, so I give the cake part of the recipe 5 stars, and the frosting part 3 because I didn't like the texture of it (but that might be personal preference).

I have never had such an epic fail on a cake.  Not sure what went wrong, I am beyond comfortable in a kitchen....but I am willing to admit I may have erred somewhere.  The flavor was wonderful, though I would use less cinnamon next time.  My problem is that it would not completely bake.  I left it in almost double the time called for and the middle was still soupy.  I love the rich icing.  I will try again, but not soon!

I decided to try this one because of all the great reviews. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because others had said it was too sweet, substituted applesauce for the oil and added two medium sized bananas for variety. Because the bananas were previously frozen and become more liquid-y when thawed, I added 1/3 cup of flour....I will add a tasting review when they are finished baking!

Made the following changes- 1) Added 1 cup pf cocoa 2) 1 tsp good instant coffee 3) 1 pkt chocolate pudding mix 4)reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cup to adjust for sugar in pudding mix
Result was a perfectly moist chocolatey cake that wasnt too sweet and had very good texture!! Very easy to make and wowed my husband who doesnt like chocolate cake.
Frosted with rich chocolate buttercream frosting from this website. Will try using chocolate ganache next time!!

I made this cake for my friend's birthday and everyone fell in love. Instead of cutting the layers in half, I just had two layers, which made it easier. For the frosting, I used less sugar than the recipe called for because I prefer a more coco-tasting frosting. This cake was easy and delicious.

Delicious!  I was nibbling at it before I frosted it ha ha.  Perfect sponge for a non-frosted applications or for those who can't eat frosting.  I too only fill my pans 2/3 full and had no problem with overtopping, but I still used a cookie sheet just as a precaution.  No problems de-panning.  This is the lightest, fluffiest cake I've ever made.  Not dense at all.  I will never bake another cake from a box again.

Glad others commented on how runny the batter was - that was different!  But the cake was yummy & quite moist.  Didn't split into 4 layers.  Used own chocolate buttercream icing.  Delicious cake for my son's birthday!

If you like chocolate....this cake is for you.  It was too sweet for my family.  Made into cupcakes and topped w/whipped cream cheese frosting.  Pretty good but too sweet like I said.

Cake is NOT particularly my favorite dessert...it's usually too dry, or too sweet, or too bland or whatever.  This is by far the best cake recipe I have found.  Perfect texture, flavor and incredibly moist.  And if you aren't a frosting person, this cake can stand on it's own and be eaten completely plain.  Excellent!

This recipe is amazing! I even slightly messed up the recipe but it still came out great! I added the coffee instead of the boiling wter. I found that I had to add more confectioners sugar because the frosty was really thin. Aaside from that, this cake tasted amazing and was so moist!

This cake was a hit with my husband and nephews.  I love the fact that the cake only requires one bowl for mixing!  I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour and increased the amount to 2 cups.  I substituted soy milk to make it non-dairy, and I baked it in a 9"x13" pan for 45 minutes, as suggested by another reviewer.  For the frosting, I substituted Earth Balance for the butter and soy milk for the milk.  I only used 3 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar (I could get away with it because I was just frosting the top of the cake while in the pan, so I didn't need the frosting to be as stiff), and this frosting is unbelievably fabulous!  It's the frosting that makes the cake a 5 star recipe.

This cake was exactly what I was looking for- a moist cake with a phenomenal frosting. I was surprised at just how easy it was to make too! Rather than using two cake pans and having to split the cakes horizontally I simply used four cake pans and it was much easier (and I imagine less messy). The frosting was a great texture and very very good to work with (as many said, very sweet, but delicious nonetheless). I will definitely be making this again in the future.

Followed this recipe's ingredients to a tee. The only things I did differently were using my own icing adding the dry ingredients to the wet, little by little. I used a table top mixer to mix all the wet ingredients, then added the dry and picked up the recipes steps from there. This cake is moist and very chocolately without being terribly rich. After trying this recipe I don't know that I'll ever go look for another chocolate cake recipe again. Definitely a keeper! *nom*

Wow this was good. I thought it was weird since the batter was like watery almost but I'm glad I kept going because it was very chocolate-y. As for the frosting, not so good so I didn't end up using it. the 5 stars is for the cake.

I made the recipe exactly as instructed with no modifications.  This is the first time I have ever made a cake from scratch.  I thought it was delicious.  However, my 18-year-old daughter thought it was not sweet enough.  That is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

I made this cake for my twin's 4th birthday and let me tell ya this cake is AMAZING!  It is moist, light, doesn't taste overly chocolately (if that's a word)and melts in your mouth.  I defintely think the secret is the boiling water at the end of the recipe.  It does make the batter thin but have no fear, just mix and go with it.  I would also recommend filling your pans only 2/3 full and putting a cookie sheet underneath your pans as this cake rises beautifully.  Remember to let it cool for a while before taking it out of the pan otherwise you mayhave some sticking issues.  As always-I place parchment paper on the bottom of my pans to prevent sticking.  However, I did use a Wilton car mold with this cake and just used extra Wilton cake release on the pan, let it cool, and had no problems.      Due to my kids wanting a different frosting I did not use the one listed in recipe. However, will definitely try it in the future.    Forks down-this is the best chocolate cake I have ever had and will now always use!

This was basically amazing! I whipped up the batter in under 10 minutes. The only changes I made was using whole wheat pastry flour (still was a fluffy soft cake) and using fresh brewed coffee instead of water. I'm so happy I used the coffee, it debt leave a taste but it made it very rich and really brought out the chocolate flavor. Thanks for such a great recipe! My new chocolate cake recipe:).

This cake is delicious and so moist!  After reading about 5 of the reviews and considering what I was actually using this recipe for, I adjusted the recipe down to 4 servings.  This is going to be a "baby" cake for my daughters 4th birthday to celebrate at home in addition to the big cake she will get at her official party.  I put the scaled down version into 2 6"x2" round pans and it fit perfectly! It rose right up to about a 1/4" away from the edge and after removing the crown from each cake then cutting each cake in half, I had a perfect surface to frost.  My cake was also done at 25 minutes, no doubt due to the smaller pans.  When I make this recipe again (which I know that I will), I will use the full recipe and use my 10" round pans or scale it down to 10 servings so I won't overflow my pans. Thanks RACH56 for a keeper recipe!

This was good, but not the "extreme" cake I was hoping for.  The cake itself, without frosting was pretty average to me.  I used whipped ganache for the layers and regular ganache for the top.  The frosting deifinetely makes the cake.  But on its own, not so much.

Made a double batch to make a princess castle cake for my dd 3rd birthday.  It was delicious, held up to carving and icing with regular buttercream.  Everyone told me how good it was.  Cooked it in a 9x13 glass dish and just checked with a toothpick for doneness.  Will keep this one for sure.

I made this cake for my grandmother's 80th birthday, and I've never gotten so many compliments. I used the buttercream as a filling and covered the top/sides with ganache. The cake is very moist and rich--really decadent. I doubled the recipe and that was perfect for a 12" cake (2 layers split into four).

I am giving this recipe a 5star rating, though I didn't use the chocolate cake recipe,   I used the butter cream icing, this is bar none the best butter cream icing I ever made successfully and tasted amazingly rich and thick and so so sinful  I used the cake recipe from this site "dark chocolate cake I and that is also a 5star rated cake.  My husband said it's the best chocolate cake I ever made from scratch, considering I only made 2 chocolate cakes from scratch, I was more amazed when it turned out perfectly and tasted OMG so so sinfully good..  next time I make another chocolate cake I am going to make the one from this recipe.

I ended up with a sunken cake, maybe should have tweaked the recipe for high altitude? Despite the way it looked, my husband said it was the tastiest cake I had ever made. Made this again, used fresh brewed coffee instead of water and added a table spoon of flour since we live in high altitude and it came out GREAT! Also used the chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site.

OMG! My life is too busy to bake much these last few years, but I'm now plotting how many times I could bake this cake and all the different people I could take it to!  This cake is amazing - and I'm not prone to gushing about cake. I made it exactly as recipe.  Taste, texture, appearance all wonderful. It is not a "large crumb" as some homemade cakes and not a fluffy semi-food like most bakery cakes are. Just beautiful. It's very moist without seeming "puddingy". I used only 1/2 the frosting recipe to ice pan shape as below and had a bit left over. The icing is great, too. It's very light and "whippy" in texture - you might imagine it's made with CoolWhip if you didn't know. But that taste is great.   . I usually find most icing way too sweet!  I baked it in a 10" springform pan with a flat-ish "bundt" insert (so the cake had a hole in the middle). Cake filled the pan nicely but didn't overflow. I did find that I had to bake it a fair bit longer than specified (was using a convection oven that automatically sets temp a bit lower due to convection).   After 20 years using to "pretty darn good" chocolate cake recipes, I will never look for another chocolate cake recipe again.  :-D

Awesome chocolate cake. Followed the recipe as stated and cooked it in a bunt pan (it took a bit longer.) This is one I'll make again for sure.

My mother claims this is the best cake I have ever made, and then went absolutely nuts over the frosting. I did add a small amount of extra milk and sugar to the frosting as it was a little bitter, but nothing too drastic. I used Ghirardelli cocoa which undoubtedly added to the taste. Extremely rich and moist, it was definately beyond restaurant quality. Thanks for the heads-up about the watery batter, it was a bit disconcerting, but don't worry it will turn out amazing!

This cake grew on me the second day.  Once the hot water was added the flavor of the cake greatly diminished.  I didn't find this cake to have enough flavor in the end.  The frosting was OK but very sweet.  I will continue to search for the perfect chocolate cake.

WOW...this was the best cake I've ever had!!  I was a little worried because the batter was so runny but I guess thats what makes it so moist. I used a cream cheese frosting instead just so I could make it pink for my daughters bday but wow the cake was so moist and delicious. Everyone loved it This is my new chocolate cake recipe...thankyou thankyou thankyou for this recipe!!!!

This is hands down the BEST chocolate cake that i've baked. I followed the directions exactly(as i usually do when trying out a new recipe) and the cake came out flawless. It was very moist and the icing was a good consistency. I didnt have any problems that others had with the cake spilling over. This recipe will definitely be added to my collection!

WOW! This cake is awesome.  I have tried to make several homemade cakes before and they didn't turn out very good.  But this cake, tastes amazing!  Dense, but moist and very chocolatey.  I wasn't sure about how the icing was going to come out: it is delicious.  I am so glad I made this cake.  I will be using this recipe for my chocolate cakes from now on!

Delcious cake. I made it for my tennis team pool party, but let my family have some first,  and they loved it. it was a little smaller than I imagined, but it served everyone, which was good. I love how moist it is. they frosting was delicious, instead of creaming the butter though, I did it the way I was taught, which is to melt it. It hold the cake together better that way.

Delicious recipe! I made some alterations because I used buttermilk frosting instead of chocolate frosting but used the suggested amounts aside from the cocoa powder and it came out really well.  The cake was nice and moist; I think the boiling water really helps.  Just mix it in by hand though as the mixer will not do the job.  I only gave it 4 stars because of the alterations I made and never really tried this recipe exactly as suggested.

I made this cake for a birthday party.  It got RAVE reviews!  You will get a soupy batter, but the cake bakes up wonderfully!!  I baked it in a 1/2 sheet pan, and the amount of batter made a thin cake.  which was ok, because I was planning on making 2 layers anyway.  I found that the frosting recipe needed to be tweeked a little.  1 1/2 C of cocoa is A LOT, and I found that I had to add more  milk and more powdered sugar to get the flavor and consistency that I like.  This is a VERY rich cake/frosting combo.  But that's how I like my chocolate cake!!!  Enjoy!

Good recipe!  Yes, the batter is runny, but it baked up just fine.  I made this in 2 - 9 in pans and cut them in half.  It was sort of tricky to cut in half.  Put it on a cutting board and cut with a surrated knife.  The frosting was the best part.  Very creamy, thick and chocolatey.  This was the best cake I've ever made or tasted!  It was a hit with everyone.

Fantastic! This was one mind blowing cake!! And it's a breeze to make!  The only thing I did different was in the way I added in the ingredients to make the cake batter. I sifted the flour,cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda and kept it separately in another bowl. Then using the electric mixer, I beat the oil and sugar until it seemed smooth/fluffy. Slowly I added in the eggs on by one. Once it was fully beaten in, I added the dry ingredients (kept aside in a separate bowl) along with the milk ALTERNATELY into the egg mixture. Once fully mixed and smooth, I added the vanilla essence and gave it one last beat.  When I added the boiling water I stirred by hand as specified in the recipe. Make sure you stir well 'coz it's essential that the water fully mixes into the thick batter and you get a soupy consistency. I didn't split the layers to make 4 layers. So my cake had just 2 layers and I ended up having lots of icing to spare. Next time I'll make this with 4 layers and a round 9" cake tin. Thank you for this recipe! It's not just me ... everyone who tasted it was truly madly deeply in love with it!!! :D

**THIS IS A VERY RUNNY BATTER** but it's great! I followed the directions exactly and I had a perfectly baked chocolate cake. I baked a 9x13 for 35 minutes and the cake came out fluffy and moist. Make sure you sift your cocoa (for those who don't bake much...this is a must). I only made 1/2 the amount of frosting and that was plenty. Great basic recipe that I will be making over and over. Thanks!

delicious! Made it with the "heavenly chocolate mousse" from this site. sooo good. will never buy another chocolate cake again. One thing I will mention, i used less powered sugar than recommended and it still made for a thick and rich frosting. I would say use your old judgment for the consistency you like.

Anybody can use their own icing on this chocolate cake. Icing recipes are simple. This cake was GREAT. Use the cake recipe! I didn't try the icing, so I have no opinion, but the cake was moist and amazing. It feels GOOD to tell people I didn't use a cake mix!

First time making chocolate cake. I was pretty impressed on how it turned out-fluffy and not to sweet. I followed exactly how the recipe says. The only reason why i give this 4 out of 5 is b/c the cake wasnt as moist as i thought it would be..But if u cover it in a cake container it will make it moist. This is a keeper and anyone who wants to make choclate cake-go for it!

Great cake. Very moist. The batter was really thin and I had my doubts but this turned out fabulous. I ran out of cocoa so I had to make the frosting without it. I didn't have quite enough frosting to finish the whole cake though, two sides didn't get any. I also was out of milk so I used some non fat powdered milk I reconstituted for the cake and used heavy whipping cream in the frosting instead on the recommendation of other AR cooks. I used a rectangular cake pan and cut it half into two squares and then cut those into layers so I had 4 square layers. Like I said to start, great cake! I will fix this one again. Thanks!

I make this Cake all the time...My kids love it and it's always a hit at the summer BBQ's...I don't usually make the frosting that goes to it but buy a store brand chocolate frosting...It's a very moist and scrumptious cake. I actually plan to make it today with a homemade cream cheese frosting...Yummmm!

Delicious! Next time I may cut back on the sugar in the icing just a little & add a little more butter. I prefer a little more butter tasting, but over all delicious & moist!

I just made this cake and frosted it, instead, with the "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" from this site.   IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  The only adjustment I made was to add some instant decaf coffee to the boiling water.  So moist!  This is now my favorite chocolate cake recipe!  Thank you so much!

Simply amazing!! This is the BEST chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried. I'm definitely sticking to this one from now on! I was a little concerned how mine would taste, as all I had for oil was extra virgin olive oil. You wouldn't know it from the cake though, it was so rich and chocolatey and moist. The icing was good too, though I only used 3 cups of icing sugar and about half a cup of milk, and I still had icing left over! Thanks so much for the best cake of my life!!!

This Moist and Tasty Chocolate Cake will be used again in my house. I made Cupcakes with it and the Recipe Made 24 large cupcakes. I did not make the Icing, found that the cupcakes were sweet enough as they were. I did use 1 cup of coffee in place of the 1 cup of boiled water.

I am not a fan. I followed recipe exactly but I didn't like the "oily" taste. I'm a good cook for my family of 5, normally.  I cut into tiny pieces and kids thought they were brownies and said it was okay but ended up throwing most it out.

This is the HERSHEY's PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE, CHOCOLATE CAKE recipe that has been on the back of their cocoa power for YEARS!!!!!  And on their website.  Even the verbiage in the directions is identical!!  That aside, the cake is a very good one.  I didn't try the frosting recipe but used the Hershey One Bowl Buttercream frosting instead.  I'm just surprised to see it here without credit being give to Hershey.....,

I wasn't crazy about the cake when I first took it out of the oven - it seemed borderline underdone and the crumb had a pasty feel in my mouth. I had to do a lot of tweaking with the frosting and add more sugar to manage the very sharp cocoa powder aftertaste. I went ahead and frosted the cake and put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning, it was like a different cake! The cocoa flavors had mellowed and the crumb firmed up very nicely. It went from zero to hero! Now that I know what to expect - and to use way less of the cocoa - I will defnitely make this cake again. It gets better with time and keeps like a dream.

Made cake and frosting per directions. Cake was very good and moist. Frosting I felt was a little bitter - I might reduce the cocoa powder to 1 cup next time I make it. Overall good though, and will make it again.

I give it 4 stars because it was really good, but mine was a disaster.  My pans over flowed in the oven and made a huge mess, then i couldn't get either cake out of the pan w/ out them falling apart. They were'nt the prettiest cakes, but it didn't stop us from eating it all, haha.

The cake tasted great even though it didn't have coffee in the house.  It was almost like eating fudgey brownies.  The problem was, the runny batter doesn't work with spring form pans.  I put cookie sheets under the pans to keep from leaking out into my oven, but the batter leaking in between the spring form pan crevices presented a problem when taking the cake out after cooling.  Also, when leaving the cake to cool, they broke.  I may try this again if I have the time.

This cake is very moist.  I made it for my husband's birthday party and everyone kept commenting on how good it was.  Even my picky brother ate it!  I didn't use the frosting in this recipe.  I used a chocolate butter cream frosting recipe from allrecipes.com and used less sugar than than the frosting recipe called for.  The combination tasted like you always hope cake will taste like but usually doesn't. Moist, chocolatey, and not too sweet so you can have a really big piece.

One word........AWESOME!!!  I'm not a big chocolate person, however, this was awesome.  Followed directions exactly and it came out perfect.  Don't be worried after you add the hot water and it becomes soupy..it all bakes perfectly.

Excellent cake!  Loved the icing and the cake came out super moist and rich!  I substituted buttermilk for milk and strong brewed coffee instead of water.  Also I baked it in three 8" rounds and didn't slice them.  They turned out perfect and made a nice high cake!  Next time I might try a mocha icing to help counter some of the chocolatey-sweetness.  :-)

Holy smokes, this cake is perfect!  It's rich, moist, and not too sweet. The frosting is better than any store bought that I have tasted...so I will not be buying chocolate frosting ever again!  And I don't even like frosting!   Since my husband and I just wanted a few bites of a chocolate-y dessert, I halved the recipe and made just a single layer cake with no problems...except we ate half the cake in one sitting!  LOL.  In an attempt (!!!) to take away some of the guilt, I used a whole grain wheat flour for half of what the recipe called for and an olive oil/flax butter spread (SmartBalance) for the frosting base.  I also didn't have any milk, so I used a can of skim evaporated milk where called for and had no issues.  I was surprised at the general soupy consistency of the batter, but had faith that all the great reviews couldn't be wrong.  I did notice that you definitely have to let the cake cool thoroughly before frosting so that the it firms all the way through.  This cake will be a staple in our household.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!

This really is the best chocolate cake in the world!  It's so moist and chocolaty that I find myself reveling with every bite.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added about 2 cups less powdered sugar than it called for in the frosting and it still tasted amazing.  My only note would be that if you're sensitive to caffeine, you may want to hold off from having a big slice after dinner.  It's almost as potent as a cup of coffee!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake was the best chocolate cake i've ever baked!! The only change i made was i used 3 pans instead of 2. This controled the spillage and i didn't have to cut layers to frost. Delicious and easy...thanks for sharing!!

I made this cake for a birthday and it was a big hit. I added some VIA (Starbucks new instant coffee) to the milk for the frosting and it was a nice balance to the rich chocolate. Everyone requested that I make it again.

This cake is so good. I added coffee instead of boiling water and cut the amount of frosting in half (which was more than enough). Without a doubt I will make this cake again.

This was my first time making a cake from scratch. I was a little intimidated  when searching for cake recipes at first. Other cakes seemed way to complacated but not this one. If you want a easy and simple cake this is the best recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars because the top of the cake was a little to sticky and some of it fell off when I was flipping out of the pan. Maybe I needed to cook it longer. But do not let this turn you away from making this sinfully delicious cake. Everyone at work loved it.

Oh man- adjectives used to describe this were "moist" "delicious" "chocolate-y" and "oh my god"...so that obviously meant it was insanely crowd-pleasing! :)  The recipe made a lot of batter, enough for 2 9" pans and 4 cupcakes (so I got to sample it beforehand yaay!).  Oh the frosting was awesome too! Thanks Rach!

I haven't made this but I'm giving it 5 stars because it's the EXACT same recipe as the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III so really, it should have way more stars :P

Most amazing chocolate cake recipe ever! Made it and it was eaten within 1 day....and it wasn't even for a celebration! Both the cake and the frosting came out amazing. I did use a 9x13" glass baking dish and split into 2 layers instead.  I had no problems with batter overflow.  Im making it again tonight! Will be making many, many more times.

Making this cake again for my 2nd time and I must say it's still delicious.  I have no idea why I rated it 4 stars last time because this is definitely 5!  Don't be afraid of the runny batter, it bakes just fine.  Instead of using regular water this time I used a very strong cup of coffee.  It was a great decision.

The cake was great....the frosting....not so great.  It was way too intense with that much cocoa powder.  I even added more powdered sugar to try to help it and it just didn't work out.  My kids on the other hand LOVED it, but they're kids so they'll eat anything sweet LOL!  I will def. make the cake again just with a different frosting.

My step mother LOVES chocolate and caramel and I used this recipe to create a chocolate toffee crunch cake with caramel cream cheese filling.  I made the cake and the icing exactly like the recipe, taking heed to stir in the boiling water by hand and it turned out so well that my dad was eating the extra without frosting.  I ended up making a 5 layer cake, using traditional chocolate ganache between 2 outside layers and the caramel cream cheese filling in the middle 2 layers, I covered the whole thing with the chocolate buttercream on the outside, and the covered in a layer of toffee chips!!! I have never had such rave reviews on my cakes.  I will be using this recipe for all of my chocolate cakes because it was also super super easy and quick.

I usually line my cake pans, especially for moist cakes, with parchment paper; however, I did not with this cake because the batter was so thin that I thought that the batter would seep under the paper.  Big mistake.  The layers cooked up great, but were impossible to remove from the pan.  I was very disappointed as this ruined the cake for me.  Has noone else had this problem?  Is anyone using lined pans for this thin batter?  I will try again later, lining my pans and submit another review.

This was an absolute hit!  I am not a chocolate cake person (call me crazy) but this was very good.  It's rich and moist, and very easy to make.  Almost everyone at work asked for the recipe!  I would definitely make this again.

This has to be the best chocolate cake I've ever had! I used a 9x13 pan and added 5 minutes on the the cook time and it came out perfect. It's rich and very moist. As one who generally prefers white cakes, I was VERY impressed!

The first time I tried this recipe to the tee, I was pretty impressed. The colour of the cake was just right and so moist. The thing I can't get is why more people haven't said that the cake has a strange "oily" flavour to it. I tried something similar which needed warmed up vegetable oil and it had exactly the same flavour. It's a pity because other than that, its a really wonderful cake. Second time round I substituted the oil with melted butter and cut down the sugar by 1/3. Went beautifully with the frosting in the same recipe!

Very rich chocolately taste, however a little too moist for me - it felt like a ball of dough in my mouth, although it was perfectly cooked.

W---ow! What an amazing chocolate cake. I felt like I had bought this from the finest bakery! It is so rich and creamy, I have ZERO complaints. The only changes I made to the recipe was that I used hot coffee instead of boiling water. I reccommend using the finest cocoa powder you can find (I used Ghiradelli).  Do not be alarmed when you see that the final batter is almost the consistency of water. I was flipping out because I thought I did something wrong, but it rose beautifully...better than any cake I have ever made.

This cake is excellent. I can't even try new recipes because every time I need to make a cake this gets requested! I have never had a problem with this cake. My only change was to the frosting. Because the cake is so sweet I usually cut back on the confectionary sugar in the icing.As it is written it was too sweet for my taste.I like a more bitter chocolate so I went ith about 3 1/2 ups sugar. Just a suggestion. WONDERFUL CAKE!!!!

This cake is so good!  I let it sit a day before cutting it.  It is so moist.  I added 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee instead of the water for the cake and in the frosting I used 1/2 cup coffee and added milk to 2/3 cup.  This is a fast and easy recipe I will use again.  No need for the milk with this cake.

This was the best cake I'd ever tasted! I'm positive those folks that gave this cake poor reviews did something very wrong! Don't believe them! I followed the recipe exactly. I have a history of making barely edible cake, so this was going to be my last time trying for real home made. Wow, with each bite, I'm amazed that I made something this good! Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!!!

Really moist and delicious.  Instead of a cake I made muffins.  It makes 24 muffins, and they baked for 20 mins.  I made as directed except I added 1 1/2 tsp of instant coffee to the boiling water.  These were very good and I will make it again.

i made these into cupcakes and mini-cupcakes.  instant hit!  i only wished i tried the frosting in the recipe (my friend insisted on his)  absolutely delicious chocolatey flavor, moist in the middle with a little slight crunch in the tops.  i baked the mini cupcakes for only 15 min.  only problem i had was getting most of them out, even though i greased the pans like a mad woman.  next time, i will buy paper cups.  i will not need to buy cake mix again!

Very good, moist choc cake. batter will be thin...hand stir the water in at first and then use the blender.  Use strong coffee istead of plain water! 
Frosting is alright...too thin with that much milk though- use less. I prefer a mocha frosting made with Kahlua and coffee! Yummy!

I think it could use more chocolate flavor, but other than that, pretty good.  Very moist cake, I iced it with PB frosting, and it held up well.

This is the best cake EVER!  I use the Hershey's Special Dark cocoa to make the cake "better" for me (more antioxidants!), and instead of the frosting, I use a chocolate cream cheese frosting, using 2 sticks of butter, 2-8 ounce bricks of cream cheese, 1-2 lb bag of powdered sugar, 1 c cocoa (again - the Special Dark), 1 Tbsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt.  If you make a traditional cream cheese icing, and put it between the layers, then frost the outside with the chocolate cream cheese icing, it tastes JUST like an OREO in CAKE form!!!!!!!!!  YUMMMMMMM!!!! (that is, IF you use the Special Dark cocoa)....  Everyone who works with me requests this cake for birthdays, holidays, special occasions, etc.

I changed my review and gave this recipe another star.  This is definitely an extreme chocolate cake.  Very rich, but not heavy and pretty moist.  The icing is fabulous!  I made the recipe exactly as it is written and will be making it again and again.  I do serve it with vanilla ice cream because it definitely screams chocolate!

Very good!  I was looking for a dark, rich chocolate cake for a chocolate mousse birthday cake and this fit the bill.  I agree with JezthePuff, this is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa container, but I've always liked that recipe.  I had a recipe for dark chocolate mousse that I used to fill the layers (3) and covered it with chocolate ganache as recommended by other reviewers.  Since the ganache and mousse had coffee, I followed other reviewers' recommendations by adding coffee instead of the boiling water.  Next time I may try instant espresso since we usually don't have the morning's coffee sitting around- instant espresso would be a bit easier.  The completed creation was simply divine!

This was a great cake.  I made it for my son's birthday and it was a big hit with the whole family.  As some suggested, I substituted 1 c. coffee for the boiling water, and that added a hint of flavor.  I didn't have any trouble with the batter bubbling over.  I did not cut the layers in half again, so that meant I had enough of the delicious frosting left over for a batch of cupcakes.  A great recipe and super easy to make with common staples in the pantry.

"That is the best chocolate cake ever." At least that is what my husband (who is very picky) and his friends had to say about it. It came out very moist, and fudgey (he thought I had added pudding) .  All time favorite chocolate and easy too. I used just a plain whipped buttercream frosting with chocolate shavings and chocolate covered strawberries.  Absolutley to die for.

The cake is awesome, although I used cream cheese frosting instead of the obsenely chocolatey icing this comes with. (I have made the frosting too, hence how I know just how chocolatey it is!) The cake itself is already extreme chocolate, so I figured the cream cheese frosting went well, and a friend of mine who is an all out chocolate lover agreed. I would recommend using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, as its the only oil recommended for cooking (hence bad press that says otherwise).

I've made this cake twice now and both times it has come out great.  I have used 2 9" pans and not had a problem with run-over and they are average height pans.  I have had the problem in the past with other recipes when I used a soft wheat flour such as White Lily.  For this recipe I used Gold Medal and did not have a problem.  I found the cake to be very moist but not heavy.  It was sturdy enough to split the layers easily.  The frosting make just the right amount for the four layers. It was very chocolately and not overpoweringly sweet.  My family was very pleased that I made them this for Valentines Day.  It's great with ice cream.

This cake is wonderful!! My husband (yes I said husband) made this cake for his mother's 76th birthday. It came out wonderful. The only change we made is we used cake flour. The cake was so light and moist!! I was so proud of him.

Serve with a gallon of milk! This cake was excellent. I made it for Christmas Dinner & it was a huge hit! Followed recipe exactly except that I used 3 cake pans instead of 2. No overflow & there was enough icing. I've found a winner!

Wow! The is the best from scratch chocolate cake I've made.  I choose it because I had everything in my pantry - no special trips to the store.  It was easy peasy and turned out fabulous.  I used a different chocolate cream cheese frosting and split each layer to make it a four layer cake. It was the perfect birthday cake!

I was a bit skeptical about boiling water in a cake recipe, but it was great. I only had 6 inch pans so had enough left over for near a dozen cupcakes as well. the icing is as perfect as you can get, but I will cut it in half next time as had way toooo much left over, and I like it thick. 
It does have a very extremely watery consistancy but it bakes perfect. Thumbs up on this one.

The frosting-to-cake ratio on this cake is perfect. Yes, the flavor is extreme, but you need that sometimes! :) I took this cake to a party and got lots of compliments on it. I'll definitely make it again.

Although I have been cooking for a long time,this was my first try at making a cake from scratch and I'm glad I picked this recipe first, or I would have been discouraged. It is fabulous! I will be baking this quite often, as my teen-aged kids and husband loved it! And I agree, there is more than enough icing, so put plenty between the layers, you won't run out and it's really good!

Everything turned out pretty good. I might try to use 3 pans instead of 2; when the cake was rising it did make me feel uneasy as it looked as if it was going to drip out a bit, but it didn't. The only thing about this recipe that I would change would be the icing portions. I know it says "extreme chocolate cake" but I just put a medium layer of icing inbetween the two layers and all over the top and sides and there was about 50%+ of the icing left! Don't get me wrong, the icing was great, a nice buttercream-y icing, but I didn't want to use it all cause I didn't want the "I can feel my teeth rotting sugary high".

This was the easiest and best cake I have ever had. I made this lactose free by using Rice Milk it worked great. SO if you can not have dairy try it...I promiss its worth it!I took 1/2 the frosting and mixed in 1/2 a can of pureed cherry pie filling. I put the cherry mix in between the layers of the cake! Very Very Good!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an AWESOME cake.  By far the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I made it for my husband's 30th birthday and it turned out tasting very good.  My only complaint is that it's almost TOO moist because it tore up coming out of the pans.  Yummy though!!  I also used Dutch Processed Hershey's cocoa and it really came out smooth and wonderful.  I'd recommend it!

I gave this 1 stars because I had to to get the review up. Followed directions to the “T” it tasted like baking soda and I had seen this in another review and someone suggested using Hershey’s cocoa powder which I did. After all this work including making frosting I took one bite and just threw the whole cake in the trash. It’s was horrible!!!!don’t waste your time or resourced

What a fabulous recipe!  It was definitely a crowd-pleaser.  It is a simple recipe that comes together quickly and easily.  It was moist and had the perfect amount of chocolate.  This is my new go-to for chocolate cake.

This was a very moist and rich chocolate cake.  Would definitely make again.  Very delicate out of the pan, though, and so did not cut each cake into two layers. I added a tiny bit more milk to the icing than it called for.  I might try this with a white icing next time for a less chocolatey change.

This is a great cake!  I love homemade cakes and frosting.  This one was very easy.  It was moist, even though it was quite dense.  Came out of the pans easily. They were greased and floured. I only let them cool about 10 minutes in the pans.  I added sprinkles to make it festive as I shared it with friends.   Will make again!

It was very easy to make and very moist.  cutting the layers and inserting the frosting made for a more moist cake and more flavor.   It will have to go into rotation Per the family.

I want to give 10 stars. Cut the pieces small, cuz it’s super rich!  I will decrease the cocoa in the frosting next time, but that’s just our preference.

Rich and very moist. when I first had a piece I was very disappointed about the taste, it was so bland. This cake was a surprise......I had a piece the following day and it was a melt in your mouth, beautiful CHOCOLATE cake!
I loved it.....it is great with or without frosting.

We are GF/DF, so I used Bob's Red Mill cup for cup flour and Earth Balance veg butter stick. Also, followed the suggestion to use coffee rather than water, chose decaf for kiddo! Used raspberry preserves for filling and a fair amount of vanilla frosting as a dam around the edges before finishing with vanilla frosting and sprinkles all around. It was a big birthday hit!!! Next time we will try the chocolate buttercream called for in the recipe, it sounds great (we just ran out of time). So glad to have found such a great recipe, and easy too.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used! I can't attest to the icing as the cake was for a different dessert without icing. I substituted freshly brewed strong coffee for the hot water. According to my bestie, her husband is still asking her to make the cake a week later! It's moist, nicely dense, and the perfect amount of chocolate...it can be used in many dessert recipes. Don't freak out when you've finished stirring up the batter; it will be incredibly thin. I was worried at first but this cake was the finest I've ever made. This will be my go-to recipe for years to come!

I made this when my daughter requested chocolate cake for her birthday. It was the best chocolate cake I've ever had, and my family agreed. For people having problems getting the cake from the pans; be sure to thoroughly grease and flour your pans. I waited the ten minutes as suggested in the recipe and didn't have any problems at all. The chocolate buttercream is AMAZING.

So good! I added one packet of bustelo instant coffee to the cup of boiling water and I only had canned milk so that's what I used. It was super soupy after adding the water but it baked well in only 31 minutes (probably could've come out sooner) and popped out of my prepared pan perfectly in less than 10 minutes...Delicious!

This is an amazing chocolate cake. I went with one review and added espresso instead of just boiling water and WoW so rich and moist. I baked it in a 9+13 and made half the frosting. Perfect and a definite keeper !!

Made this cake for the first time for a friend's birthday party. Holy hell this cake was a HUGE hit. I'm still hearing about it weeks after the party. A friend even said it was better than Portillo's Chocolate cake.

OMG! PEOPLE! PEOPLE! Look no further for a chocolate cake recipe! This is the BEST Chocolate cake I have ever eaten or made!  Followed exactly except I sifted the flour and I used grape seed oil for all oil/butter. I used coffee at the end instead of water. It was soupy like other reviewers stated, and I was so nervous about it not cooking right. But it cooked perfectly!! I also added chocolate chips to the batter which made it super chocolatey and delicious!  The frosting was perfect also and had just enough. This is the moistest cake I have ever made!  The only thing I wld do differently is maybe not using all the batter, since it cooked a bit over and the cake wasn’t exactly even, but that’s ok.  Other than that, have faith in this soupy batter of a chocolate cake! You will not be disappointed!

Great chocolate cake recipe although I added extra cake flour. It seemed too thin. Likewise the frosting needed extra water. It came out way too thick. But am pleased with the outcome....chocolaty, moist cake. Better than box or bakery!

When your friend says she wants chocolate cake for her birthday....this is The Cake!  Thank you to previous comments I made it exactly to the recipe using Hershey special dark cocoa powder.   Yes the batter did look pretty watery after adding the water, but it came out of the oven amazing.   It was easy and delicious.  Everyone at the party ate all the cake on their plates.  That means it tasted great and was not too rich. I would totally make again.

I read reviews and decided to replace the boiling water with hot coffee and felt like it really added depth of flavor. Very easy to make and it turned out amazing! I waited about 25-30 minutes to pop out the cakes. Didn't break apart at all!

This cake was great and very moist! The only thing I did different was to bake the cake rounds in a cookie tray lined with water to help keep the edges from becoming dried. We used the buttercream frosting that accompanies this recipe and while it was a great consistency, it was too chocolatey - this coming from my wife who LOVES chocolate. So next time we use this frosting I will probably only use 1c unsweetened cocoa rather than 1.5cups.

Delicious! My first cake ever, and I will definitely make it again. I followed the advice of several users and used coffee instead of boiling water, and I waited 20 minutes before de-panning. Had no issues with overflow, but I put baking sheets beneath the cake pans just in case. Also had no issues with breakage when I transferred them to cooling racks, but I used a parchment paper liner and grease and floured pans thoroughly.  I switched out the frosting recipe for another buttercream one. Next time I make this cake I'll try the frosting recipe that comes with it.

I love how moist this turned out. I used Chocolate Hazlenut Coffee instead of the hot water. It was a perfect substitute. The only thing I will do differently next time is change the frosting. The buttercream was too sweet for my taste. I prefer a cream cheese based filling and frosting so I’ll give that a try next time.

Excellent recipe. I have a major sweet tooth, so I may add a bit more sugar next time, but other than that, it was great! I did substitute a cup of coffee for the water, by the way.

This cake is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly, I just let the cake cool down for a little over 20 minutes. It was super moist so you have to be careful when taking it out of the pan. I suggest parchment paper. Make this cake, you will NOT regret it. The frosting was delicious and my new go to!

I really want to give this 5 stars because it was so delicious but the fact that the cake batter came overflowing out of the tins inside my oven stops me from doing so! I am guessing it's because I'm at over 7000 feet elevation, so I guess next time I would try decreasing the baking powder and baking soda? I wish this problem would be addressed by the author because I now see many others have this problem! My husband did say it was better than the Costco chocolate cake (which is what I was going for)! We just scooped the cake into bowls and topped with dollops of the icing and seriously...it was outstanding. Thanks for the recipe!

I am by no means a cake baker. I took on this one for a challenge on Christmas morning. This cake was amazing and simple to make. I added brewed coffee as one person suggested and will do so again.
I recommend using an electric knife to slice the layers, works like magic. I also used the electric knife to slice the pieces for serving.
 This will be a signature cake for me. I will be experimenting with peanut butter  and chocolate frosting on my next one.

I made this cake only. Used different recipe for icing. I followed suggestions from others who suggested coffee instead of the cup of water. This cake was primo! Amazing. Very fluffy. Very tasty. Will make again.

This is a great moist cake recipe! 
I followed the ingredients completely until I got to the boiling water. We have a Keurig here, so I used a Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup instead of coffee. Coffee over powers milk chocolate and this wasn't meant to be a breakfast cake. 
I chose not to take the time to make the buttercream icing and opted to use Hershey's Milk Chocolate Icing. For between the layers, I used Jiff Peanut Butter Icing and it really added a savory element to the very sweet and rich chocolate cake. 
Just be sure to make sure the batter is evenly distributed into the 9 inch cake pans and try to eliminate any air bubbles. 
*If you have a gas-stove like I do, I would recommend putting it in the oven at 325 F for 35-40 minutes. Gas stoves tend to have a little more power behind their heating systems (especially if they are a newer model) so a slightly lower temperature can help you avoid over cooking. 
I will be making this again soon. It was perfect for my chocolate loving family!

This chocolate cake was fantastic. It is a keeper. I had students in my home economics class make it and the cake portion turned out really well. The icing was too thick and we followed the recipe. It would be interesting to see how it would turn out if  I did it. That being said, the kids lived the cake part, however they found the icing too sweet and thick. I will keep working on this part though.

Just made this! Stuck to the recipe other than substituting the boiling water with hot coffee. Frosting turned out excellently, cake is very good, but really sticky, even after 38 minutes in the oven. I let cool in the pan for 30 minutes before turning them over onto cooling racks, and they stuck to the racks a bit. Came right out of the pans, though! Very moist and tasty. Didn’t rise too much or overflow, would definitely consider this recipe for a three or four layer cake in the future.

Very good cake! I reduced the icing by 1/3 and used pudding between the layers.  I also made 3 layers instead of making two and having to split them.  It was a hit!

I've made this cake dozens of times and it's by far my go to chocolate cake.  I've made my own minor tweaks and have my measurements for ingredients down to the gram and cooking time down to the minute.  I won't share those because they're specific to my elevation and oven.  Anyway, this recipe is perfect as is.  Rich and moist.  Comes out perfect every time.  Tip:  Cake tastes best after it rests for a few days and is served at room temperature.  Take that into consideration when planning for a party or special occasion.

I haven't made a cake in a while but enjoy baking.  I followed all instructions but substituted hot coffee for the boiling water.  The cakes turned out wonderfully!  I used quite a bit more milk/cream in the buttercream than the recipe to get it to the point that I could frost the cake without tearing it up.  The cake definitely requires a crumb layer.  This is a wonderful, deeply chocolatey, cake that I will make again!

After reading all the reviews from many recipes, I decided this would be the perfect recipe... It was a complete disaster for me! I followed directions perfectly, and all I have ended up with is a big soupy mess with chocolate cake all over the bottom of my oven.? Other reviewer’s warned about the running consistency but reassured that it would set up nicely. Before mine had a chance to set up it was billowing over each pan. The edges seem to be burning and the centers are soup. I am so disappointed, as I have company coming in a few hours and no dessert!

This is an AMAZING recipe! Instead of using 2 cups of white sugar, I did one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar! It tasted great, and it's gotten many compliments from many different people! I definitely recommend this recipe, and I'll definitely make it more in the future!

Very, rich flavorful cake. My only change was the icing. My family does not enjoy any type of sweet icing. I use chocolate   pudding between the layers and cover the outside with chocolate whipped cream.

This is the Hershey's perfectly chocolate cake recipe. It's always been reliable. To moisten the cake replace milk with buttermilk. To enhance the chocolate flavor use coffee in the place of water and remember to stir.

Tastes great, has a great texture and is really fudgy. My only recommendation: don't beat your mixture for 3 whole minutes. My cakes collapsed when I did  -- I recommend only mixing until combined.

Didn’t make any modifications!  I didn’t make the chocolate ganache or icing, as I made a chocolate Swiss meringue icing instead.  GREAT CAKE for chocolate lovers!  Next time, I will put some chopped up chocolates into the batter to make it even more chocolaty!

I followed this recipe to the letter and let it cool for 20 minutes before removing it from the pan.  The cake is as light as a feather and very moist.  Just handle it with care. 

One change that I would make the next time I bake it, is the icing, and there's tons of it.  Slicing the cake to make four layers and icing the layers and the top was a bit too rich and sweet for me.  Next time, and I definitely will add this to my best chocolate cake list, I'll leave it as two cakes and use a ganache instead of the sugar icing.  
If you're looking for a super light, moist and chocolatey cake, this is it.

My wife said this is the  " most delicious cake ever!"  That is from a person who does not usually eat cake (just the icing!).  My daughter and I made it for my wife's birthday.  She was thrilled with how it tasted.  I am still in shock that she loved it so much!  I bet it was the hot coffee used in place of hot water that gave it the delicious taste.  She told me to make it again.

I didn't have my chocolate lover's recipe book on hand so I was very happy to find this one. I've been making this deep dark chocolate cake for  many years. It is always  my  1st choice when I need to make a moist, rich chocolate cake. My icing is a bit different,  but I really enjoyed this one !

Turned out perfectly. Only I ditched the electric mixer and did everything by hand. Also, I beat together the liquid ingredients in a separate bowl very very well before adding them to the flour and chocolate mix.

I've exclusively been making this chocolate cake recipe for years and I absolutely love it. Substituting the boiling water for coffee adds an interesting flavor. I want to try it with instant hot cocoa as well to see what that does. I usually skip the frosting recipe and make a chocolate ganache or vanilla buttercream, but pairing this with peanut butter buttercream has been a HUGE hit. You'll never need a chocolate cake recipe again if you make this.

Followed directions perfectly, it was delicious!!! I skipped the icing & made my own but this info is for just the cake without icing. It WAS quite dense & super moist. Easy to make, then I chilled the cakes in the fridge after they cooled a bit on the counter. Excellent!

Followed everything exactly except used boiling coffee instead of water. My whole family said it’s the best chocolate cake they’ve had.  Still moist 5 days later!

I have made this MANY times by popular demand.  I keep asking if people are tired of it and I get a resounding NO every time. It’s a very nice, moist chocolate cake. I can make the cake so easily that I can throw it together and in the pan before my oven is done preheating. I use hot coffee instead of water like was mentioned in another comment and it comes out great. If you love chocolate you will love this cake.

Went well, except the center collapsed, it’s because I poured the 9” pans in two stages to try and make them even, creating an outer ring had time to set up and a middle circle that didn’t rise before going in the oven. Let your cake sit!

Delicious cake!  One thing I’ll try next time is probably leave out the extra 1/2 cup of cocoa in the icing.  It’s pretty strong.  But, I topped the cake with raspberries so that definitely elevated this cake for me!  Splitting the layers was slightly difficult due to the cake being so moist just an FYI.

Man, this was good. I used the cup of hot coffee as some suggested and it turned out great. I was really unsure about the batter after adding the coffee since it was soo soupy, but it came out great.
My only suggestion would be to cut the frosting in half in you don't cut the cake into four layers. I ended up with a lot of extra frosting.

I’ve made this cake twice. I’m glad the second time that I made extra icing so that I could afford to be generous on the sides and if I needed a patch or two. It’s always popular and has a lovely flavor.

Hey everybody

I thought I could try and help with a few things with my personal experience using this receipe, which by the way is absolutely amazing and delicious, I make this almost once every week. So as for me when it comes to this receipe 
1 cup = 250ML
1/2 cup = 125ML 
1/4 cup = to about 60 ML 
For this receipe I always level and pack my ingredients in the cups and after whisking all of the ingredients I use one heaping teaspoon on instant coffee with 250ML of boiling hot water then I personally use a hand mixer when adding the hot water and it comes out just perfect whether or not you do by hand or mixer, and my personal tip for the batter and baking is I use weight. so my 9 INCH CAKE PAN weighs about 115grams or 149 when using a home made cake sleeve which really helps level out the cake, and then my batter in total weighs about 1426 grams so then when it comes to adding the batter in the pan. I first Line it with parchment paper on the bottom and then add 604 grams of the batter to the pan or in total weight including the pan with sleeve on would be about 753 grams and then put in the oven for about 30 to 33 minutes and then the top will mountain a bit but all I simply do is put a flat plate on top then flip it over and makes the top completely flat and then do it again for the second pan and with the excess batter if you are making this receipe twice simply put the first leftover batter in a measuring cup and for the second leftover batter do the same and join.

The ONLY reason it got 4 stars is because it was too rich for me. It was fun to make, challenging and my husband LOVED it. For once I followed the recipe, but only because it was a baked product. My only suggestion for next time, for me, is to not do the 4 four layers, (or use less frosting) but if you want decadent, this is the cake for you. We froze  a quarter of it and we are very much looking forward to eating it latter...

I LOVE this recipe, and once I make one, I can't keep it in the house (I get raided by the grandkids! :))  Even my mom, who "doesn't like chocolate" loves this cake.  I took another reviewer's advice and used a freshly brewed hot cup of coffee instead of the boiling water and, due to allergies, used almond milk instead of regular.  It was fantastic!  Also, I used 3, 8-inch layers to avoid overflow and sometimes, I frost them individually , cut them into serving portions, and freeze individual slices so I have it on hand.  I also make this cake for church pot lucks and there is never any to bring home.  If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I would.  It is the best!!

This is one good cake recipe. In my case, I waited for over an hour to get the cakes out of the pan, and I put them in the fridge for the second half of that time.  I made this cake twice, and the first time I used the chocolate icing recipe given. It was very tasty, but with a vaguely bitter aftertaste. The second time, I made it with a whipped cream and cherry filling. It was fantastic! This cake will replace boxed cake mix in my house.

This cake is the best! It was light and fluffy, yet at the same time moist. What I do recommend is to keep the cakes cooling in pans for about 15-20 minutes instead of 10. Otherwise I have made this recipe for almost every occasion I need a cake. This is probably my favorite recipe. I highly recommend it!!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake and frosting. I made half of the recipe and it turned out great. The next time around I used coffee instead of water and added whisky to replace the vanilla extract. The cake is sweet but not overly.

This is the recipe on the back of the Hershey Cocoa. I've been using it for years. My only changes are that I do not add the cocoa with the flour.  I put it aside in a bowl and at the end of the recipe where it calls for a cup of boiling water- I use hot coffee and add that to the cocoa to let it bloom. Then I add the hot coffee/cocoa to the batter and hand mix in. This cake is delicious and moist but this little trick elevates the chocolate flavor even more.

This cake is probably the best chocolate cake I’ve made. It’s very soft and tender and moist. I made it for a friends birthday and it’s now one of hr favorites. However I noticed that the recipe is exactly like the recipe on the back of the Hershey’s dark cocoa powder..but I still give it 5 stars for taste and how easy the recipe is to follow. I also suggest using fresh brewed coffee instead of water for a better chocolate taste.

This cake is AMAZING! Every time I make it, I get so many compliments! My grandma said it was better than hers! I've made it as a bundt cake with a chocolate glaze, too, but it takes longer to bake. Sometimes, I substitute some of the cocoa powder for Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and the cake is even richer (1/2 cup special dark and 1/4 cup regular cocoa powder).

MAKE THIS 1 DAY B4 YOU NEED IT! {Updated review} I couldn't quit eating it the next day. Moist & a little thicker rather than fluffy. Making it again but subbing butter for oil. 

1st review (that same night) -  It wasn't the best but by far not the worst, probably try a different recipe next time. Maybe I would add less hot water, substitute buttermilk for milk, and melted butter in place of the oil.

This is a great recipe. The cake is very moist and has a very good texture. I did add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, but that’s just my preference. Terrific!!

Made this cake for my Grandmother's birthday & the overall decision was that the cake had great flavor and was extremely moist. I followed the recipe to a T (will try coffee in place of boiled water next time just to see the difference) and baked in 9x13. Grandma didn't want chocolate frosting so I used the whipped cream mousse frosting recipe from the site & was pleased with the pair.

Excellent recipe! I made it in two 9-inch cake pans and only added 1/2 cup boiling water because I added 1/4 cup chocolate chips to the recipe at the end. The frosting tastes like the stovetop cocoa my dad used to make.  It only needed 4 cups of my powdered sugar, but that stuff is never consistent by brand so just take it a cup at a time. Make sure that dang cake is cool before you frost it, and if you don't grease and flour your pans you will regret life

I worked for Smith and Wollensky and their cake is much better. I'm spoiled. It was an execution disaster. It stuck in the center.  The pans are level but its moistness wasn't consistent through our the cake.. Oh well I'll try again after I consume this mess.

Well, it tastes like I thought it should, but I was unable to frost the cake. It crumbled even with the lightest touch. Bummer?? this was supposed to be for a birthday cake now I have to buy one. I followed directions exactly.

This cake is amazing.  It's the perfect chocolate cake for all occasions - rich, moist, tender, yet nearly foolproof.  One slight modification I made: use half & half instead of milk.  Also, for the icing, use the very best butter you can find.  It makes a big difference.

I just made this for a bake sale for church and raised the most money with the recipe.  It is a chocolate lover's dream and very easy.  I made the recipe as written with one exception.  I frosted between the layers with the frosting recipe given (excellent chocolate taste).  I then made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site for the top and to drip down the sides.  Next time I'll try making the glaze with white chocolate and see how it comes out, it should look stunning (maybe a little less butter due to the white chocolate.  It will take some experimentation.)  This is a very rich cake and will satisfy the biggest chocolate craving! Thanks for a great recipe.

I had not made a chocolate cake in quite some time.  This was a great choice.  It was delicious.  I substituted a cup of hot Cafe Bustelo coffee for the boiling water.  I think it added to the flavor.  
This will be my go to recipe for chocolate cake recipes in the future.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  It is moist, but does not fall apart.  Sometimes I add some strong coffee or instant coffee powder to the mix (I compensate by using less milk if I use liquid coffee), which brings out the chocolate flavor.  It is strong enough to hold up to carving, as long as it is fully baked. 

 I made it this evening.  Instead of chocolate buttercream, I made a dark chocolate ganache with chocolate, heavy cream, raspberry jam and raspberry liqueur, which I used for the top and sides of the cake.  For the inside, I mixed up some raspberry jam, raspberry liqueur and some fresh squeezed orange juice.  I make it pretty liquidy so it would soak into the cake and make it moist.  (I put a border of ganache around the edge before adding the liquid mixture, so it wouldn't  spill out onto the side of the cake.)

It is the kind of cake that is virtually irresistible!

This cake came out fantastically moist, delicious and the frosting was creamy and a perfect compliment. if you have a Chocolate Lover to bake for, this is the cake! I did use the substitution suggestion of 1 cup of strong (dark roast)coffee instead of boiling water(it's suppose to enhance the chocolate flavor) You could not taste any coffee flavor. I also used the suggestion of using circles of parchment paper in the bottom of my non stick pans(no grease and flour) and the cakes came out no problem! if you follow the directions, you will not have a problem. Got RAVE reviews for this cake & would absolutely make this again!

This is amazing!!! I followed directions precisely. I waited exactly ten minutes to cook in pans, than flipped them out with support. I had used a sharp knife to loosen edges all around the cakes in their pans, prior to removal.  I’ve never had chocolate cake like this before...never.  I can’t say enough..????????????

Amazingly rich and dense. Brought it down to 360 calories by substituting milk with almond milk and oil for applesauce. I only made half the frosting and it was still more than plenty.

Let me preempt this by saying I'm NOT a Baker. But I wanted to make this for my chocolate loving hubby for Valentine's Day. I made a total mess in the kitchen attempting it but it turned out great. For some reason this cake gets more moist every day after it is baked. Today is the 3rd day after and it's better today than the day after I baked it. I tried to cut it into a heart shape which was probably a mistake as it was a bear to frost. (Did I mention I'm Not a baker?) I think had I warmed the milk for the frosting it might have gone on easier. Instead as a newbie, i just added more milk to get it to the right consistency. Keep it whole or bake in the shape pan you want and it will turn out better than mine. Hubby loved it and that's what counted! Thanks for the recipe

Great tasting and easy to make. I didn't split the cakes, next time I will not frost the sides because the frosting is really sweet. If you are not familiar with baking know that the cake recipe stops at the boiling water and the frosting part begins and the 3/4 butter part. (You'll see what I mean).

The cake was delicious - moist and chocolaty.  Unfortunately, it overflowed the pans slightly, rose nicely in the oven, but fell when cooling.  It wasn't pretty, but the family loved it and reminded me I need to make cakes more often.

The cake tastes delicious but I honestly wouldn't make it again.. I definitely recommend parchment paper as my cake stuck to the cake pan even with heavy greasing.. the icing ratios seemed off to me and the cake came out quite sloppy

I made this recipe just as it was written, even with the boiling water and it turned out great. I was at least a half cup short of cocoa for the frosting though, so I melted chocolate chips and added them to it.  It was still great, and received rave reviews, although it  probably would have been more  chocoolaty with the extra cocoa. I would make this again.

THIS CAKE BELONGS IN YOUR RECIPE BOX.

I made this recipe as cupcakes for a friend's birthday party.  The recipe made about 19-20 cupcakes from a standard 12-well cupcake pan.  I baked them in liners for about 20 minutes, with the cupcake liners filled almost all the way up to the liner's edge. They came out SO BEAUTIFULLY.  They are fluffy and light, despite how frighteningly runny the batter seemed.  They also popped out of the cupcake pan like a breeze! I will definitely be making this again!

This cake was definitely not anything that other reviewers said about taste. I made this exactly by the directions - it was moist, which is the only thing I agree with. I brought for a potluck at work and everybody said it was too bitter. I tasted it and it was more than just bitter - it wasn't sweet and it had a strange aftertaste. I'm not sure what the solution is for this cake but I definitely think it needs more than just two cups of sugar in the batter and maybe not so much cocoa, since this is prob the contributing factor to the bitterness. I used regular,  unsweetened cocoa - not dark.  I won't be making this cake again.

I followed the recipe exactly. Both the cake and the frosting turned out beautifully! I agree with previous reviewers who recommended greasing the bottom of the pan generously. I had to de-pan carefully. Definitely run a knife between the edge of the baked cake and the pan before you try to turn it out. The two layers are not deep, so they don’t make a particularly tall cake. The cake has a slightly dense, very moist (I hate that word, but it applies here) texture and a rich chocolate flavor. (FWIW, I used Guittard cocoa powder.) The frosting recipe makes more than you could possibly need, but it’s a great recipe! Use a good quality butter. The frosting texture is really fantastic. It’s easy to spread but thick enough for piping, which was fun. I’ll definitely make this cake again, and might experiment with fillings like raspberry jam.

Cakes sank in the middle .  This is similar to a sheet cake recipe I use and I'm thinking the recipe would do better in that form than for a layered cake.

Excellent cake. I always get rave reviews! Let it set in the pan while cooking for at least 10 minutes and use hot coffee in place of boiling water. The frosting recipe makes a large amount, I never use it all!

This chocolate cake is wonderful!  I made this cake for Christmas and everyone raved.  It is dense and moist and the kind of cake that makes you whimper with pleasure - well it did me ;)   I was worried about the soupy consistency, but read enough reviews to trust that the cake would bake up firm.  I heavily greased and floured the pans and let the cakes set for 10 minutes on a cooling rack before removing them from the pans. I traced a knife around the edge of the pan before flipping them over and they released from the pan without a problem.  I used a white buttercream frosting  rather than the suggested chocolate frosting and the buttercream flavor in combination with the luscious chocolate of the cake was a big hit with my family.  This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe!

I am adding ingredients for this recipe to my grocery list and the recipe seems to be missing the shaved chocolate garnish on top of cake. It appears to have two different kinds of chocolate on it. Does anyone know what kind of chocolates are in the pic for gsrnish?

I made this cake once several years ago for my daughter-in-law's birthday, who said it was the best chocolate cake she'd ever eaten – and she's a major foodie. Since then, she calls it "her" special birthday cake and I make it for her every year. It's a perfect  recipe with a perfect outcome every time!

It was very good and moist.  My only complaint is the ingredients were totally out of order. I had to guess which chocolate, milk and vanilla went with the cake or the icing. Even with my guess work it was very good. I did switch up the butter in the icing. I used 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco and 1/4 cup butter. My husband doesn't like his icing super sweet and I find using butter flavored crisco, it cuts down on some of the richness of the icing.

Hands down, the best chocolate cake I’ve ever had. I made this for my mother for her 60th birthday. Her, my 87 year old grandma and my 15 year old daughter agree that it’s the best. My mother has made basically every chocolate cake recipe that she has ever come across and she said she would never bother with any other recipe after trying this. All 4 generations of my family agree. One tip- I baked the cakes for approximately 5 minutes longer, after a toothpick came out clean. They seemed a little jiggly still at that point when I shook the pans

This really is the best chocolate cake - moist, dense, richly chocolate! 
The flavor is perfect and the chocolate buttercream included after the cake recipe is a wonderful, rich addition to the cake. This is my go-to chocolate cake!
A co-worker requested a birthday peanut butter cup birthday cake - i used this cake (added peanut butter chips to the pans before baking) and iced with a whipped peanut butter frosting. I made it a real showstopper with a chocolate ganache drip and chopped peanut butter cups.

This is a very light cake.....I'm guessing because of the hot water.  I did substitute dark coffee for the water (as recommended by other bakers).  I did cut the layers into 4....which was a mistake on my part.  Once I added the frosting, the cake collapsed under the weight of the buttercream.  If I make this again, I won't slice the layers & will use a lighter frosting.  But I loved how light the cake was!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving Day. Despite the fact I forgot to add the boiling water, it turned out well. My family enjoyed it. I gave it four stars because I think in the future I would add real butter in place of the oil. Just my taste preference.

DELICIOUS!  Everyone loved it!  Cake was so moist, I thought it would fall apart if I cut in half to make 4 layers, so I just did the two layers with frosting in center.  Also, I didn't finish off sides, but just put a lot in center and on top and let the frosting sort of "fall" over top randomly and it looked really nice that way.  And then I topped with 3 big rasberries in the center and all around top edge of cake.  DARN -- I didn't take a pic.  Looked really nice though.

This cake was fantastic! I followed all of the instructions carefully. I waited 15 min to remove from the pans because I read that someone had trouble getting them out. It worked great. The cake was moist and the icing was nice and flavourful. This is a keeper!

I am new to making cakes from scratch, so I was VERY surprised when the batter was so runny, especially since I read through many comments and no one else mentioned it. I was sure I'd done something wrong, but baked the cupcakes anyway. They turned out fantastic! I baked cupcakes at 350 for about 16 minutes.

The cake was flavorful and light. The frosting was divine, this is replacing entirely my other chocolate cake recipes.

Really bad, I am so angry! Waste of my time, the whole batter bubbled over and onto the bottom of the oven, started a fire. What was left in the pan was a mess. Why don’t they tell you to use a bigger pan. Don’t make this cake ??45 minutes later after cleaning up the mess in the   The bottom of the oven and the pans, trying a new chocolate cake recipe.

Making it right now actually and have never made it before. I can say it’s super easy, and I added the coffee like many others, even adding a 1/2 teaspoon of some espresso to my frosting. I will update my review once it is all made and I taste it of course!

I love it!  The recipes produces perfectly moist chocolate cake.  Used 1c Hot strong coffee (from french press) + 1c milk, and 3/4 c brown sugar instead of 2c white sugar.  This is so easy to make, almost like a box cake, but I can customize to make it less sweet.

This recipe was absolutely amazing in my opinion. I left out a cup and a half of powdered sugar in the frosting because it seemed unnecessary but that was it. All of the ingredients are usually already in a household and it still holds its own against recipes with fancy gelatins or extracts. Even my friends who aren't huge fans of sugar loved the cake. Will certainly make again.

This cake is fantastic! I followed the other reviews and substituted coffee for the water. It was amazing - moist and delicious. I've also made the Too Much Chocolate Cake. I prefer this one as the other one has a little bit of a chemical taste due to the boxed cake mix mix.

I used coffee in place of the boiling water, which helped enhance the chocolate flavour. I also used skim or 1% milk (either one is fine), which helped make the cake a little lighter and healthier =)

This cake is great, no doubt. However, this is NOT necessarily an original recipe. The cake itself is verbatim off of the Hershey's Cocoa box. That said, I have been making this cake for years. As other reviewers have done, the only changes that I make are using buttermilk to replace the milk and coffee instead of water.  I used to make a Chocolate Butter Cream, but I have recently discovered the simplicity and delicious-ness of making a whipped ganache frosting and it truly makes this cake a showstopper, plus it's not overly sweet.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, I followed the recipe exactly. The cake took forever to cook, I had to add at least 30 more minutes, and was still a little "gooey" in the middle. It also ended up sinking in and had a really off flavor. Again, I may have done something wrong, but as a lover of baking I've never had trouble in the past as long as I followed the instructions for "good" recipes.

I don’t particularly like chocolate cake but my kids love it. They talked me into making a chocolate cake one night and WOW! This chocolate cake I LOVE. I didn’t have to make any tweaks to this recipe and it came out perfect. Better than the last cake I got at a bakery.

Possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I did use Hershey's "special dark" cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa powder and it made a HUGE difference in the outcome and flavor of the cake, it was rich and flavorful DARK CHOCOLATE cake!!!  soooooooooo good

Excellent. I read the comments, and left it in the pan to cool for a good 20 minutes, and it came out perfectly. I did replace some of the oil with amaretto to make a chocolate almond cake, and I made it in a bundt pan. But I recommend it, very moist.

Tastes just like grandma used to make. I just made it a 9x12 pan and didn't layer it. For the icing I followed the recipe but stopped adding icing sugar until I had enough to cover. Still very tasty and very chocolaty!!

I made this as listed  trying to find a cake comparable to a business  in Greenwood , In. It rates five stars this way, but I added strong coffee  instead of boiling water  because it brings out the chocolate flavor. It is requested  by my extended family constantly this way and I have made it more than a dozen times since. Just be careful if you wait til the toothpick is perfectly clean it may be drier than expected due to the cooking continuing  after removal from the oven. Trial and error, I haven't thrown a bit out yet.

Absolutely perfect chocolate cake recipe!  Follow the directions exactly and you will discover a new favorite.  Lots of compliments on this cake.  I put sliced, fresh raspberries between the layers and iced with a true French buttercream.  Incredible! For those that have issues with the cake not coming out of the pans, just use pam baking spray.  It won’t leave white flour marks on your sponge and it releases the cake after ten minutes (hint: if it’s not pulled away from the sides of the pan, it’s not cooled enough).

Unbelievable outcome - one was complete mush in the middle and the other was thin as a pancake (my springform pan leaked out bottom)...making second attempt to see if the water mixing was the problem.

Wonderful recipe for a delicious, moist, perfectly chocolate cake. I used 1.5 cups of sugar and it was perfectly sweet enough. The cocoa powder I used also contained chili powder and cinnamon which worried me somewhat but the cake tasted insanely good. I used a  12x9 pan and baked for 45 minutes. I will most definitely be using the recipe for all my future chocolate cakes, tweaking it here and there, such as substituting the boiling water with hot, fresh coffee.

The cake was great, no problems.  The 1 3/4 cup cocoa in the frosting made it bitter. Maybe I just need a better quality cocoa.  My grandkids loved it!

This is the Hershey's recipe which is fine. It has good taste, but I do half water/half coffee because I don't like a strong coffee taste.  Also this barely fills 9" pans up halfway.  Whoever said she filled her pans up 2/3 full and had batter left to throw out???  She might want to re-measure her pans.  This cake is nice but very flimsy and doesn't bake high. Not my favorite for making a stacked cake.

I made this cake today AS IS and it is amazing!!  Extremely chocolaty and a dense yet light texture.  I HATE coffee and can always taste it in baked goods, so I did used the boiling hot water.  I greased my pans and used parchment; however next time I will dust them with cocoa powder.  The only change I add was to the frosting:  I sifted the cocoa powder and powdered sugar to ensure a fine texture before adding it to the butter.  I don’t like clumps of sugar or cocoa in my frosting.  I have 9” Wilton pans and used the batter equally between the two...nine left over.  The cakes rise beautifully and were even so no need to trim or level.  This is a keeper recipe for us!  12 servings is generous as a small slice is really all you need.  The frosting makes the perfect bite.

I made cupcakes instead of an actual cake. I also made a cookies and cream frosting because I can't handle a lot of chocolate, and OMG this recipe is AMAZING! Even after 5 days the cupcakes are still moist. Definitely a keeper

Cake tasted amazing! Very moist. I only used 2/3 cup of cocoa for the frosting. The current measurements makes it a little bitter in my opinion. I also subsititided coffee from my Keurig in place of boiling water. Use Bakers joy to spray your pan to keep it from sticking or grease with Crisco (solid) and flour. Let cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan. If you wait any longer it will stick. All I used cake flour. I think the people who are saying the cakes are overflowing are using self rising flour. Also I made this in a 13x9 pan. Remove after 35 minutes. It may not appear done but it is. I plan on making this for my son’s birthday!

The cake didn’t turn out very well for me.  It puffed up really high in the oven but then deflated into a sad sunken cake when fully cooked.  I don’t know how I messed it up.  I think I need a more fool proof recipe.

This was a huge hit! I used hot coffee instead of boiling water as was suggested. I also used 1/4 cup kahlua and a 1/4 cup melted butter as I was all out of vegetable oil. I chopped up fresh strawberries and used them as filling in between the 2 cakes. YUM!!!!!

The cake is delicious and made as stated in the recipe. I also made a chocolate cream cheese icing to top it. The cake is heavenly! This is my go to chocolate cake now.

This was very good. I didn’t have two pans and was too lazy to cut the cake in half so I ended up with A LOT of icing on the outside.  Next time I will use two layers.

The only change I made was to use hot coffee in place of the boiling water. I think next time I'll try replacing the oil with butter. This cake was delicious - extreme chocolate is a good description. I also added crushed oreo cookie crumbs in a thin layer on top of  frosting inside cake and on outside. Very moist and NOT fluffy cake - which is what I want from a chocolate cake - and the frosting was very good. I saved the leftover in the fridge for midnight cravings.

I didn't use brewed coffee as it instructs in the video, but it still turned out amazing. I didn't use the right pans either, but the cake was still delightful and I got great reviews from other people that tried the cake! A must try for any chocolate cake lover!

Excellent taste, texture and crumb on this cake. First time I used butter instead of vegetable oil, tasted great! Second time I used coconut oil as the fat and it was even better! Maybe a little tiny hint of coconut flavor, would be great with a white coconut buttercream frosting. Both times I made it I used a butter/cream cheese frosting recipe, the tartness of the cream cheese really helped keep it from being too sweet. I will be making this one again (and again, and again...)!

It worked out grate! I didn’t put in any coffee, so it wasn’t that liquid. But still it was amazing! I also like my toothpick to have a little cake mix on it, because then it’s moist and not dry. Just a tip.

The cake was absolutely delicious! I am never having truffle pastries from outside no more. 
Piece of advice, don't add salt. Just don't. Also, if you're making just the cake without the frosting, consider adding more sugar, as both of them balance each other out otherwise.
[I really loved the texture of the cake, though]

The cake recipe is amazing, along with the recipe for the icing. Though I use just the chocolate cake recipe most of the time. I like my cakes dense and moist and this is perfect for it. Though.... The last time I made it (cupcakes for my daughters birthday), on top of the normal oil I added 1/4 cup of butter to the batter and a small handful of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips to each cupcake before baking. What I forgot was the vanilla!!!! I was terrified. BUT it turned out to be the best mistake I've ever made. Many people told me it was the best cupcake they have ever had. And to be honest it was the same for me. I chose to make a buttercream icing to top it, as my daughter had wanted them to be colorful.

Made this for the first time for a birthday cake.  I did not split the layers and I think that made a difference in the amount of frosting I had to finish the cake....PERFECT.  This cake stayed moist and flavorful for the best part of one week.  I will file this one in my go-to recipes.  Delicious.

Loved the cake! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully with a tender, moist crumb. I was not as thrilled with the frosting, hence the loss of a star. The frosting was simply too soft. I would suggest another frosting recipe to use with the cake. Once I find a good chocolate frosting, I will amend this review to include it.

Elevation matters!!!  And I’d love to tell you how to change the recipe but I’m not a baker.  I made this recipe 2 times in CO and it overflowed both times but it was so yummy the first time I made it again.  Probably need to add more flour like most recipes at high altitude.  Anyway, I just made it in VA and it is cooking up perfectly!

Pretty fantastic. I screwed up my first one doing it in a 9x13 pan and it burned the outside and was uncooked in the middle, so I bought a couple 9" rounds and they turned out great. I also cut down the icing by about 1/3 and it was plenty.  Everyone wanted the recipe so I sent them the link. Thanks.

It exploded all over my oven. I followed it exactly and in one pan it melted away in another it bubbled all over my oven. My frosting did not thicken either.

This is my Husband favorite cake. 
I gave it my personal touch adding blended raspberries to the cake and to the frosting, or I make caramel milk as filling.

Made this for my husbands birthday.  Very easy to make and better than any store bought cake I've had.  Super moist cake and so rich and chocolatey.  Will definitely make again.

GREAT CAKE!!! I made this for my mom for mother's day and, though it took a whole afternoon (I'm a slow baker), it was completely worth it. My dad said it was the best chocolate cake he ever had, though he might've been a little biased! Be warned, this cake is VERY rich. I made this for 2 8-inch rounds instead of 9-inch like the recipe says, so I took out 1/5 of the batter (8-inch volume is 50 in. squared, 9-inch volume is 64 in. squared). I put this extra batter in cupcake tins. I made 5 cupcakes, but would've be better off making 6 since the tops flowed over. The cupcakes didn't need the whole 30 minutes, either - they wound up being a little overdone. But back to the actual cake: I wound up having it in the oven for  about 36 minutes and it was perfectly moist. I listened to other reviews, adding the 1 cup of coffee in place of boiling water and making sure to let my cakes sit about 25 minutes before turning them out onto wire racks. Frosting recipe is wonderful, too - so creamy!! I didn't split my cakes in half, leaving it as a two-layer (I don't trust myself to cut across straight) and it worked out fine. While frosting, some crumbs came up rather easily, but this wasn't extremely inconveniencing. Overall an amazing cake recipe that receives glowing praise from recipients!

This really is what I call EXTREME chocolate cake.  For those who love chocolate & rich desserts (I do!). I recommend serving with good coffee (or milk or vanilla ice cream) to give some space in the intensity.  Probably not a crowd pleaser for the simple fact that typically not everyone in the crowd will be crazy about chocolate like those of us who are!  But if it’s rich chocolate your crowd likes, then this is FABULOUS!

I had to add liquids to the frosting because it was too thick and the cake batter was a bit thin. Tastes good though.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I did a half batch to go into a mini bundt pan. It turned out perfect. Delicious and moist. I used vanilla frosting instead of the chocolate and absolutely loved it. I’ll be making this again!

This is a lovely caked recipe. I would definitely sub coffee for water.

Variations that appeal to my personal taste: 
-buttermilk instead of regular milk
-reducing the sugar in the cake mix by 25 % (this creates a not-so-sweet and rather adult chocolate cake, well complemented by the saccharine icing
-adding a little salt and espresso to the icing
-shaved dark chocolate for the topping
-the use of cocoa powder and parchment (as per video suggestion) to the can
-make sure to cook the cakes perfectly in the pan prior to releasing them

I was halfway through the recipe when I realized I didn’t have regular milk so I subbed it for unsweetened almond milk that I had on hand.  Can’t even tell and they are amazing!

For a recipe alteration for high elevation, over 5000 ft, reduce sugar by 4 tbsp, increase eggs by 1 plus one egg white, increase milk by 2 tbsp., decrease baking soda and baking powder by 1/8 tsp each, and bake at 375 for 25-30 min.  Turned out perfectly in Colorado Springs! I only made half the icing because that amount would have been way too much. The cake is sooo moist! Mmmm

A perfectly dense moist chocolate cake. I have always used wiltons buttercream but figured i'd try this one since i was making the cake. It would be difficult to decorate an intricate design with this icing as it is very thick, but it is delicious, and both recipes are going to become my go to for chocolate cake.

Absolutely amazing. I eyeballed the ingredients with my measuring cups. Mixed it in my kitchen aid with the whisk. I put the boiling water in as the mixer was going at the very end and it turned out amazing. Oh, I used this recipe for cupcakes. Cooked on 350 for 17 mins. They are so good. I didn’t even frost them!

This is hands down the best chocolate cake EVER! Easy to make, moist, and the perfect chocolate taste. The only modification I made was using 1 cup of hot coffee instead of hot water. The batter was thin like others have stated,  but it bakes to a wonderfully moist cake. The only issue I had was the edges being crumbly. Someone suggested baking at 325° F instead for longer to avoid that, but I haven't tried that yet. Will let you know if it works.

This recipe is amazing! I have never made a homemade cake before and this was easy to follow and tastes great! I live at a higher elevation so had an issue with the middle not rising but will make this again! I ended up doing three cake pans and worked out well.

Best chocolate cake I’ve ever had. And usually I don’t like chocolate cake! As others have said, it is a very soupy, runny batter but it makes for a wonderfully moist cake! I didn’t cut back on the water at all- didn’t need to. Used 9 in. pans so no problems with overflow. Frosted with store-bought milk chocolate icing and it was a superb accent to the cake. Huge success in this house!

This was a very easy cake to make.  The thin batter did worry me but the cake baked well.  I used parchment paper to line the pans so there was no trouble turning it out.  I substituted freshly brewed strong coffee for the water.  Waiting to cut it tomorrow.  My house smells divine!

The cake was really crumbly and I would have given it no stars at all if it wasn't for the fact that the cake still tasted really good (I had to increase the sugar to 2 1/2 cups because it tasted kinda salty). It was extremely difficult to get it out even after cooling for over 20 min. Will continue looking for a good chocolate cake recipe.

made this for my fiancée for his birthday, used dark cocoa powder instead since he prefers dark chocolate, he loved it. everyone did. as far as cooling though, its 10 minutes in the fridge, 20 minutes if you're just letting it cool on the counter. cake was definitely sweet but always taste the batter before hand to ensure its as sweet as you like, i added an extra 1/3 cup of sugar because the dark chocolate taste was strong, i accidently put too much dark cocoa. :)

This deep dark chocolate cake is fantastic and when they say it is foolproof, they mean it.  I made the cake and put it in the oven.  Three minutes later I realized I didn’t add the milk!  I rushed to the oven, poured out the batter and added the milk.  The resulting cake was moist, flavorful, and had a beautiful texture.  I will be making this cake again and again - but this time I’ll remember the milk before I put it in the oven.  I used Hershey’s Special Dark Cocoa and the flavor was dark chocolate and truly exceptional.  I used a chocolate ganache glaze and a bundt pan for 40 minutes.  Perfection!

This is the most yummy, rich and moist chocolate cake ever.  I almost got in trouble (I am not a baker)  when it said to cut each cake into two layers but it went well.  The frosting was also pure perfection.

Absolutely delicious! Like many reviewers, I also used coffee in place of water. Here’s a tip to bring out the chocolate flavor in the frosting: add 1 or 2 drops (no more!) of maple flavoring.

This cake is rich, dense, & very moist. It's the perfect chocolate cake.  I followed the recipe for the cake & frosting as written; except I used 1 cup of boiling coffee in place of the cup of boiling water for the cake. My go to chocolate cake.

This was my first time making a cake from scratch and I was beyond impressed. I’m picky when it comes to a good chocolate cake and this was one of the best I have ever had. It was dense and moist, and the icing finished it off perfectly. I will definitely make this again!

Awesome flavor.  Do not worry when you see the thin batter.  That's just the way it is and it bakes into a really moist cake.  I used three 9" cake pans instead of splitting the layers.  Loads easier.  I just adjusted the baking time.  I also used a cup of coffee instead of the boiling water.  It makes the flavor richer.  I also frosted the cake with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.  Doubly good.

Wow. This is delicious! I’ve made it twice now and both times turned out great. A HUGE hit with the family. This is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe. The cake is extremely moist and the frosting is very rich. Just a personal preference,I like to serve with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream as I find it helps balance out the richness of the frosting.

I made this cake for my daughters 5th birthday and it was a hit! The only thing I changed was the flour. I am gluten intolerant so, I swapped the all purpose flour for my gluten free flour (Cup4Cup is the brand I use) and the cake was so moist even 5 days later. My guest couldn’t even tell it was gluten free. A definite keeper!

This is the best chocolate cake you will ever eat in your life. It's moist, chocolatey, has the perfect light and fluffy texture.When I made it, I thought it was too beautiful and would deflate as soon as I took it out of the oven, but it stayed wonderfully puffy even when I iced it. I totally recommend this cake.

This is my go-to recipe every time i make cupcakes. I’ve made it 100 times and have learnt some modifications that make it amazing: 1. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder/ soda, and salt together. 2. Instead of 1.5 tsp of each baking soda and powder, sub for 1 tsp soda and 2 tsp powder. And 3. If i have hot coffee readily available i like to use it in the place of the hot water sometimes :)

Let me start with I am NOT a baker!  I tried it a while back when my youngest wanted a chocolate cake like Peppa Pig had on her birthday.  I tried this recipe and now my family loves this cake.  I make it for most everyone birthday. I did read the reviews and tried the coffee substitute. I really do feel the coffee does compliment the chocolate well.  I do like to change up the filling between layers.  I have used raspberry jam and strawberry jam as filling.  This time I decided to try to sub a quarter of the 2 tsp of vanilla extract with orange extract.  I was hoping a slight orange flavoring twist to the very chocolatey cake.  I did not notice a change so I might go half and half on orange and vanilla extract next time.  Overall it is a great base recipe to learn from.

This recipe makes a delicious cake! Although the batter seems liquidity, it turns out amazing. Adding chocolate chips and dulce de lèche on this cake after it is frosted tastes awesome. It is amazing how amazing it is. I will definitely make this cake again!

This is only my second time ever attempting to make a homemade cake. The first time (different recipe) was not good at all. This time I followed these directions exactly and the cake was awesome! My brother in law is not a cake eater and he had two pieces!!! Really a great recipe. I’ll try it a few more times and hopefully I’ll feel more comfortable making them!

Taste delicious. But mine does not rise as high as the other reviews pictures...and I made it twice. Any hints? Also mine tends to crumble when I take it out and then slice. Is it my cake pans? Please help! I really want it to look as delicious as it tastes!

YUM YUM YUM!! This is my new go to cake. Was super easy to make. My husband loved it and he is very picky with cakes, especially chocolate ones. I didn't have enough cocoa powder left so I was missing half a cup for the frosting and it still turned out great!! So yummy!!

Cake tastes very good, but I could not get it out of of the pan, even after cooling it completely. Another reviewer suggested lining the pans with parchment paper. I will do this next time.

This is a very tasty recipe I have been using for years. This is the exact recipe on the back of the Hersheys cocoa powder box. Credit should be given where it is due. Frosting is almost the same as well just scaled up a bit.

I followed the recipe as stated and it was fabulous!  I did watch the video and followed how to line the 9" pans with parchment - after 10 minutes the cake came right out. I then used dental floss to cut each in half for a 4 layer cake. The icing was the perfect amount to put in each layer and cover the entire outside of the cake. We all wanted large pieces and finished it quickly - no getting stale with this one! 
I make for all the birthdays now - it's the icing that is really out of this world!

The flavor and texture of this cake are superb!! I made the cake in a 9x13 pan and added some instant coffee to the boiling water. This will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on! I will however use different frosting.

A warning and some options:
The flavor here is superb. We love them!
There is an issue with the recipe, as written though. I've made it many times. If the recommended recipe is followed exactly, there is too much (and I mean way too much) leavening!!! They either look like deflated volcanoes, or spill over the cups (sorry, guess I should have mentioned first, we use this for cupcakes - but it works out the same either way - if you read other reviews people mention the cakes falling apart). The cupcakes fall apart - too much crumble. So we use 3/4 tsp baking powder, if doing the original recipe. That said, here's an option if you want this to be more blood sugar and diet friendly. We use 1 cup sugar, we replace the second cup of sugar with 2Tb Sweetleaf Stevia Powder, 1/6 cup rice (cooked), 1/6 cup black beans (cooked), and 6oz hot water. We puree the beans and rice in the water, before adding it to the recipe. We replace the oil with either yogurt or applesauce, depending on which is handy. All the other ingredients remain the same (including - in this adaptation, use the full 1.5tsp baking powder). The resulting cupcakes are less than 90 calories each!!! That's low enough you could cheat with chocolate cupcakes for breakfast and still be on target calorically for the day. They still taste awesome!

Awesome! Made this for my son’s 18th birthday today! Big hit! I followed ALL ingredients and directions, EXCEPT I substituted 1/2 C melted butter for the oil—as someone here wisely recommended! Then with frosting, I put more cocoa powder in-played with amounts of confectioner sugar and milk. Came out with a super fudgy chocolate frosting! I have never made frosting where you melt the butter! What a concept! Came out super good and I will always use this recipe! Totally recommend!!

The main change I made was using coffee instead of boiling water. I didn't have any issues like some did with overflowing batter. The other change I made was using dark cocoa powder for the icing. It was almost black, but pretty incredible.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever had! It was so moist. Everyone loved it! I used dark chocolate cocoa, and it was so rich. I also used 1/2c  evaporated milk and 1/2c 2% milk for the frosting because that's all I had, and it was delicious! This is my go to chocolate cake recipe now. Thanks so much for posting it.

So moist and delicious!!! I modified slightly by adding instant coffee to the boiling water to bring out the flavor in the cocoa. It is amazing!

I love this cake. I’ve made it two times and both times it got rave reviews! This last time I added crushed walnuts to each layer and crushed walnuts and raspberries on top. It was delicious. The tart fruit really helps cut the sweetness of the cake. This frosting is delicious too. Will definitely be making this one again!

Easily the best chocolate cake I’ve made off of All Recipes! Recipe is also very forgiving! No veggie oil, but had safflower oil- used that. Totally forgot the milk until it was already in the greased pan ready for the oven. Took a chance of screwing it up and added the milk right into the pan and swirled it around. Baked perfectly. Tasted great. My family raved about it. Not sure how others had it not turn out as I fully expected mine to be a disaster. Was ah’mazing!

It is delicious, but make sure there's lot of extra room in your pan. I filled my pan 2/3 full, and it rose up and overflowed all over my oven floor.

I pretty much made it as the recipe is written, but did add instant coffee to the boiling water, I made it the day before and kept it in the fridge until about 2 hours before we wanted it.
This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made or had anywhere else, the chocolate flavor is perfect. 
I made 1 1/2 x the icing so I had exra to work with, I did throw some away but I would do that again 
I will make it again!

This is the Hershey's Chocolate Cake Recipe with a modified frosting.  The batter is runny but makes a very moist cake.  I once over baked this but sprinkled it with water to moisten it and it worked perfectly.

i haven't baked a cake from scratch in years and was very pleased with the results. This cake was moist and  deliciously chocolate.  The chocolate buttercream frosting was perfect. Everyone in my family loved this cake. My 7 year old  grandson told me he wanted this cake for his birthday. This is a complement because he is not a big sweet eater.

Best chocolate cake ever.  So moist and with the frosting its the perfect combo.  This is kind of a big deal in our world considering only one person in our family likes chocolate cake.  I made this for her birthday at her request and now the entire family has changed their mind.  Every party goer asked for a second piece.  Followed the recipe exactly for both cake and frosting. DELICIOUS.

Really great chocolate cake recipe. It is very rich and moist, and i would compare it to making a brownie into a cake with the chewiness and depth of flavor. I have made it twice so far and here are my adjustments:
- I use natural cocoa powder so I eliminated the baking powder and increased the baking soda to 2 tsp. The acidity of the natural cocoa powder reacts well enough with the soda
- Going off of other suggestions I substituted the hot water, but instead of coffee I used Guinness. It may also add a bit of leavening.
- I reduced the sugar to 1 and 3/4 cup 
- I increased cocoa powder to 1 cup - with this you may want to adjust the liquid a bit and go for closer to 1 and 1/4 cup Guinness.

I have not made the frosting yet and can not comment on that.

This recipe is from Hershey and is much easier to know what the ingredients are for since the format on Allrecipes has changed, making it difficult to decipher which ingredients are for the cake and which are for the frosting.  Very good cake and excellent "real" chocolate flavor (I used brewed coffee water).

I haven't made a chocolate cake for years and couldn't have asked for a better recipe! I read the reviews so used coffee instead of boiling water and left it to cool for 30 minutes vs 10 before removing from pans. I didn't use all the icing as it would have been too much. But ...this is the best chocolate cake I have had ... ever.

Made this for my mother's birthday, no changes to the ingredients.  It was amazing, she loved it!  It was chocolatey, fudgy, and rich.  Perfect with ice cream.  I made mine in a 13X9 pan and baked for 5 extra minutes to account for the pan.  Cooled for several hours before frosting.  Very easy to make too, I will make this again

The cake is delicious and very moist. However it is not at all made for layering, even if you give it a lot of cooling time. Also the including icing was delicious but more suited for the inside of a cake, as it never set - even in the fridge!

I made this into cupcakes with an Oreo in the center. Followed the recipe for the cake (not frosting) exactly and it came out perfect. It made about 30 cupcakes, I think I baked them for about 20 minutes at 350. I wasn't sure about the time because I just kept checking the centers with toothpicks until they were done. the centers caved inward instead of plumping up but that has to be because of the cookie; it was an easy hide with a mound of frosting. The taste was still unbeatable. Definitely making this more often

I needed a quick single serving recipe for a mini layered birthday cake. This was perfect. I didn't have time to make the icing, so I used a store bought whipped vanilla and added some whipping cream, almond flavouring and smashed skor bar bits. It turned out delicious. The picture isn't the best, but it does show how I threw it together really quickly and it still did the trick!

It was fantastic and I received many compliments for it. Next time I think I will substitute a cup of strong coffee for the milk, but that would be the only change I would make it. Its very good as-is.

This is the moistest chocolate cake I've ever had!  The only thing I did different was adding a little time to the 35 minutes - it was more like 45 minutes before the toothpick came out clean!  
Loved it!!!!

This was very delicious! I made it for my grandmother's birthday, and the whole family loved it. However, cooking it was difficult due to the high elevation, and we ended up not cooking it long enough. It was kind of a mess and very hard to put the icing on, but it was delicious anyway!

I made this and it was so dense and thick- more brownie like than cake like. All my family members who like dense desserts loved it but I just thought it was too think. I also found the cake the be under-sweet and the icing to be oversweet. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect chocolate cake... really thought this might be the one.

The best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. Extremely moist. I take the cake out after 30 minutes. I also only use about 4 cups of powdered sugar for the icing (if you use the full amount it is really sweet). Also be sure to allow the cake at least 30 minutes to cool rather than the recommended 10 min. time... if not it will surely crumble.

It was a huge hit! Even the biggest health nuts at the party went in for a second slice. I baked this Friday morning and it remained moist and delicious for the Saturday party.  Note that I did a frosting crumb coat to try to retain the moisture as much as possible and refrigerated.  Two thumbs up - definitely making again!!

As a professional pastry chef, I was skeptical about this recipe at first because adding the water at the end seemed odd when usually you mix the water with the cocoa powder. 
I made this cake as the bottom tier of a wedding cake, using a deep 12in pan, so I had to double the recipe  and it was perfect.  It came out of the pan easily and perfectly, it did take longer in the oven than the recipe said it would but that’s no big deal. Everyone who had it loved it and it stayed so moist. I will definitely be using this recipe again!!! 
Note: I did not used suggested frosting recipe as I had my own and would be covering the whole thing in fondant anyways

I have made this cake for weddings, birthdays, baby showers, just because... you name it. I have found my tweaks for making it even better (which I didn't think was possible). I use a cup of coffee - actually, I use instant because everyone in our house hates coffee - and instead of milk, I use Dairy Gold brand old fashioned chocolate milk. My family asks for this cake CONSTANTLY. I went to pastry school, have worked in kitchens and bakeries but this easy peasy recipe is the best!

The cake itself cake out really good! The frosting was a bit runny! I’m not sure if I just did something wrong with it, but it had good flavor over all. I think next time I might use cream cheese instead of butter for the frosting so maybe it won’t be so runny.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I went for Truvia to replace regular sugar, whole wheat flour in place of white, unsweetened apple sauce to replace vegetable oil and the results were fantastic! To be able to enjoy a chocolate cake without being too concerned over nutritional value is a plus. The frosting I cut no corners and went exactly as the recipe called for and I am glad that I did. The overall end result is astounding and my family really enjoyed this recipe.

I increased the serving size by 50% so it was 3  9" layers.  I also used coffee instead of boiling water as mentioned in another review and I made peanut butter frosting instead of the chocolate buttercream in the recipe.  The cake was a huge hit and will be a yearly tradition for my son's birthday.

Huge hit. HUGE. This one's a keeper. I made exactly as directed but followed the suggestion in the video to replace a cup of boiling water with a cup of strongly brewed coffee. So yummy. Batter is very soupy, but don't let that scare you. Bakes to a fluffy, moist, even cake.

Only 4 stars because the cupcakes cooled with weird peaks on them. However, the cake I made in the 9 inch pan turned out perfectly. The flavor is just basic chocolate nothing mind blowing. Very moist! I used coffee instead of water. I used my own chocolate icing recipe. I would make this again but only in cake form and I'd probably add extra vanilla to kick the flavor up a notch.

Best cake ever, will make it again for sure. I changed 1 cup of boiling water for only 1/2, otherwise the batter would end up almost liquid.

Extremely moist chocolate cake and easy to make. I didn't slice each 9-inch cake into two, but instead just iced the two making it a two-layer cake. The icing was a bit on the sweet side so I would suggest using less sugar.

I made this cake once and missed the part where you need to flour the pain (beginner mistake I guess) and the cakes came out flat, but then I copied exactly how they did it in the video with the cocoa instead of flour and WOW! what a difference! Came out almost twice the height! Easy, great recipie

This was the best cake ever.  Very simple to make.  The real challenge is slicing in half horizontally.  I made a mess but you can't tell by looking at it.  Yum!

This chocolate cake is what my mother used to make when I was a child. I am 71 years old and have been trying to  duplicate the cake. I have her recipe and yes it is the one that was printed on the Hershey's cocoa container years ago.  The original recipe called for lard.   I made it with  lard it was so heavy we could hardly lift it. Lol  I made this recipe as it is printed. It is the same taste as I remember.  I used a canned frosting. My mother always used a white butter cream frosting.  I will make this again noting that my oven temperature needs to be tweaked and if not I will cook it just a bit longer than 35 minutes.  Everyone that has tasted this said it is the best chocolate cake they have ever tasted.

After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical about this cake sticking to the pan and coming out gooey.  I made this last night and the trick to not having it stick or being gooey (mine only baked 24 minutes) is to incorporate the hot water thoroughly.  Do not shut off the mixer and stir it in by hand.  Leave the mixer on the lowest setting and make sure the water gets blended in.  Your batter will be thinner than most cakes but it will make a fabulous cake.  Hope this hint helps!

Best chocolate cake ever!  Everyone complimented on it and asked for the recipe.  Frosting was yummy.  Such a simple recipe, you can actually mix all the ingredients together as it says.  I'm so used to having to separate the eggs, sugar, milk etc from the dry ingredients.  Time is approximate to making a box cake.  Making it again for another birthday.

The cake itself was mediocre, but the FROSTING was absolutely... Rich, decadent, bittersweet, perfect... And totally made up for the cake's lack. I baked mine in a 13x9" pan and it turned out... delicious. My family loved it. Be sure to let yours cool for plenty of time -- 10-20 minutes, I'd say.

I made this for a family birthday party. Hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I used buttermilk rather than milk and a whipped cream frosting. 5 Stars! I was asked if we could have a special occasion every week.

Great cake, very easy!  I took the advice of a fellow reviewer to replace the hot water with hot coffee. Great tip, I also use cake flour.  In a taste test with 30 5th graders the cake made with coffee and cake flour won.  Have fun make this cake!

Easy recipe with awesome results. I used coffee instead of water. The cake and frosting is perfect in every way ... easy but with a flavor and moistness that will have everyone thinking you were slaving away. I'm replacing my standard recipe making this one my new go to chocolate cake recipe. The cake was even moist the next day!

Very good cake (I did replace the water with hot coffee). However, I'm thinking the use of the original buttercream frosting is what would give it the extra star. Instead of stacking each layer for a tall cake, I decorated the top of each differently and served with ice cream.

Amazing!!!!!!! I got a little fearful adding in the hot water so I only added 1/2. I could have done all of it and the cake would have been super moist. As it was it was delicious!!! A huge hit for my chocolate cake loving father in law!

I'm not sure why people low rate this cake. It was very easy to make and was moist, very chocolaty, and had no issues during baking. I used a 10 inch silicone cake pan, buttered and floured the bottom and the sides half way up. I also used good dutch cocoa. No overflow. No funny shape. I did have to wait at least 15 minutes to de-pan, but that wasn't a problem. I used my own frosting recipe and everyone thought the cake was marvelous! Definitely five stars!

Wonderful recipe! I made it exactly as directed, however I doubled it and made two 9 x 13" pans and changed the cooking to time to 45 minutes. I used the cakes to build my son's construction themed birthday cake! Turned out great! I did use a different chocolate buttercream recipe: 5 cups powdered sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 sticks of butter, 2 tsp vanilla & about 5-6 tbsp whipping cream. Delicious!

Excellent recipe -chocolatey, moist, dense.  I replaced boiling water with hot black coffee as others suggested and baked in 9x13pan as a sheet cake for about 40min. Can even out perfectly. I made a peanut butter frosting (special request of birthday boy) and it tasted delicious.  I will definitely  use this recipe again and again, I'm sure. Yum!

This is going to be my go-to chocolate cake. Sometimes my cakes turn out a little dry but this recipe resulted in a moist, delicious cake. The frosting was yummy too! (And I'm not a big fan of frosting)

If you plan to make this in two 9'' circular pans, this recipe makes nice size cakes, not too thin like some recipes. 

I doubled the cake recipe for my crowd but I did not double the frosting and it still made a lot! I covered my two tiered cake and a 9x13 cake and my kids still had plenty to lick from the bowl.

I recently put up some freezer jam so I added some between the cake layers and it tasted wonderful!

Perhaps the one time I made it was a fluke, but I was VERY disappointed when I made this cake. It was extremely dense and was not moist AT ALL. Also, it does have a much more genuine chocolate/cocoa taste which is to be expected in a homemade cake and I appreciated... just adding it for those of you who may not like that.  I definitely was NOT a fan of this cake... it remained mostly uneaten at a fam gathering... which, if you knew my family, that means a lot. Again, I may have just made a mistake. I have been baking for a while, but those inevitably happen. I like to think I did giving the mostly positive reviews that are being given. However, I just wanted to throw this out there in case you are like me and wished someone had said something.

Followed the instructions as per cake recipe. The batter was thin but it came out very good! The recipe calls for 5 1/3 cup of confectioner's sugar for the icing, I thought it will be too sweet, so I just add 4 C instead but still came out a little bit too sweet!. Next time, will cut down the confectioner's sugar to 3 1/2.

This  was the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made or eaten. My sister, kids, and friends all think the same. My boyfriend says it reminds him of his moms chocolate cake!! It is weird that you add hot water but the end results are amazing. Those giving this bad reviews need to try again or maybe try the one I made :) I changed up  the frosting and its way better but I can totally have this cake without it.

Made this for a co-workers birthday.  Followed the recipe as is (except used 10" rounds) and it turned out perfectly.  So many rave reviews - in particular how moist it was.  Will definitely make this one again!

I made this cake and followed the recipe exactly, and I have to say, it was the absolutely BEST cake I have ever eaten! Everyone raved about it! I have struggled for years to find a chocolate cake recipe that was moist, and this one is it! I baked it for 32 minutes, and since I was decorating this cake for a special family occasion, I used a vanilla buttercream frosting by just omitting the cocoa.  This is definitely the only chocolate cake recipe I will ever use!

Yuck! I must've messed up somewhere alomg the way. The cake was inconsistent and weirdly spongy. Not a deep rich chocolate flavor. It was more like wet, dark angel food cake. Three possible missteps: should I not refrigerate cake before serving? And when removing from pan does it need to be ALL the way cooled? Because it was kinda hot. And finally, the water was boiling, when I stirred it in, but since I only had one  pan, I had to let the remaining batter sit out for 30 minutes. So if it was supposed to be hot and go straight into oven, then half the cake was made wrong. In any case, my husband was very disappointed in his birthday cake. Even my five year old who will eat fruit snacks off a dirty floor couldn't finish it. She said "it's ok Mommy. I still love you." Phew! But no love for this cake. I need to figure out what went wrong, try something else, or buy our next birthday cake instead.

I love heavy cake! This cake is extremely moist and dense. Those the two qualities I am looking for when it comes to cake. Only thing I tweaked was I added 1.5 cups of sugar and I added a pack of vanilla pudding mix.

I use this to make cakes and cupcakes both. I does seem very thin when its made but don't worry it will set up! Its a bit moist for the cake... very rich chocolate flavor. Bake for 20 minutes for cupcakes and they turn out pretty well.

This was my first time making a chocolate cake from scratch, and I thought it was pretty easy. I followed the recipe exactly as written (for the cake) and made two 9" rounds. I actually used the Hershey's Cocoa icing recipe, which is my favorite. I baked the cakes 30 mins, and I found that it didn't spring back up when I pressed it, so I gave it another 5 min (35 total). It was very moist and delicious. Our friends raved about it!

Wow! I made that and something else too all by myself as a 13 year-old and haven't been baking for  long and it still turned out great. Not only that, i didn't have enough coca and barely  enough powdered sugar  for the frosting, but it was great. Definitely something I'm going to make over and over again

I've used this recipe for cupcakes several times now with great success. I typically get 30 cupcakes filled 2/3 full baked for about 25 min. I top with a cream cheese or buttercream frosting though since, unfortunately for me, the reat of my family gets overwhelmed by the chocolate on chocolate style.
 I do follow the suggestion of subbing coffee for water. this last time my 2yo and 4yo helped so to save my sanity I just did dry ingredients, then wet, then dumped them together, added the coffee and electric mixered it. It wasn't as thin so they might be a little different consistency but the baked just fine.

Whoever made this cake and said it wasn't good, must have screwed up, because I have made this recipe multiple times following the recipe exactly, and it turned out amazing. Best chocolate cake recipe ever, would definitely bake again. Also, many people say "I made 500 changes and it was dry and tasteless. Gross!" DON'T MAKE CHANGES!!

Just a few things about all the negative reviews. I have made this cake more times than I can count. Never had a problem with it sinking.  Altitudes have a lot to do with cake rising as well as the baking soda. If the soda is not good anymore, you will not get the proper rise. 

I've made this and covered with frosting and fondant with out a problem. 

A few things I do are, grease and flour the pan. Also put a parchment paper cut out in the bottom of the pan. As the cake starts to cool, it will separate from the pan. I still run a knife along the edges before flipping it out. 

If you try and frost any cake before it cools 100% it's gonna fall apart. One thing I do is soak my cakes with a vanilla syrup, then wrap in elastic wrap and then foil. I then put them in the freezer and let them freeze. Pull them out and you should have no prob with decorating them. 

The only thing I do different with this recipe is use a different frosting. 

I have never had a complaint when I make this cake. If any of you are familiar with portillos cakes, I've been told on numerous occasion that this cake taste 100x better.

A delicious, moist, chocolatey cake. I made mine with three 8" layers. Make sure you bake it long enough so it doesn't end up being a gooey, unappetizing mess. The frosting's consistency made for easy frosting of the cake, and there was more than enough to frost all three  layers generously. My family couldn't get over how professional it looked, and delicious it tasted. I thought the cake was simply amazing when it had a chance to sit in the fridge. So good!

I made this cake today, and I'm torn between giving it three or four stars. I give it four because there's nothing wrong with the recipe; it's just not to our taste. I chose to make this recipe because the reviews said it was dense. I'm not a huge fan of the fluffy box mix cakes--I want to feel like I'm getting something for all those calories. This cake is dense, but for me, it's like eating a fudgy brownie. I don't care for fudgy brownies, so I probably won't make this cake again. The flavor is fine. I didn't make the recipe's frosting. Instead I made a coffee-mascarpone frosting. I used 1/3 c. less sugar than called for in the recipe because 2 c. sounded crazy. I used coffee instead of the water as others have done, and I used 1 1/2 t. vanilla only because I added orange aroma. Those were the only substitutions. As someone recommended, I really buttered the pans and floured them, and hey presto! the cakes came right out. Yay! One of the remarkable things I noticed was how domed the cakes were when I took them out of the oven (although I didn't butter the pans' sides as someone had suggested to help cakes crawl up the edges and prevent doming), but as they cooled for 10 min., they flattened out just like a custard would. So, the recipe works, and it is dense and moist, and chocolatey. If you like fudgy brownies, you'll like this cake.

I made this as a birthday cake for a friends son. He loves chocolate. I used buttermilk instead of plain milk and hot coffee instead of water. Many chocolate cake recipes I researched called for the same switches. This cake is delicious. Super chocolate flavor!!

I made this and it was AMAZING but it could be adjusted. The cake didn't come out super moist so I suggest you put mayo instead of the oil, it may sound a bit weird but it works. And unless you really and i mean really like dark chocolate don't use dark chocolate cocoa powder. But other than that it was amazing, using it for an auction next week.

Followed directions exactly. Easy to make, moist icing was awesome.  Only criticism is the cake part not fluffy. Its very dense. But definitely delicious! Would make again.

I followed the directions almost exactly & it came out moist and delicious! Instead of 1c boiling water, I added 1 cup of my espresso/coffee. For the frosting, I also sprinkled a little bit of instant espresso powder to enhance the chocolate taste. The cakes (cooked them in 2 Wilton 9" cake pan) came out easily (I greased with butter and added a little flour) after 10 minutes of resting after I pulled it out of the oven. 

The frosting was more than enough from the recipe! Enjoy it! Delicious!

This was a huge win! Nice and moist. 
Batter was very liquidy but it came out great. Frosting was also PERFECT! Even my husband who usually doesn't like birthday cake LOVED It!

I've made this cake a few times.  It is very good as written.  I did substitute coffee for the boiling water the last time I made it, as was suggested in many of the reviews, and it was heavenly.

I just made this cake this morning to take to my daughter's for Easter dinner tomorrow; oh WOW!  It is absolutely THE BEST chocolate cake that I have ever made and I'm almost 68 and have been baking since I joined 4-H at age 7. Like many who have posted before me, I have never had a batter quite so thin but it works so don't worry about it or try to "fix" it because you think that it's too thin- it's not. You're wondering how I tasted it if I'm taking it to dinner...I used to bake wedding cakes so I trimmed off the top of each tier to make it flat and uniform to stack. I know...just a sneaky way to get a taste ahead of everyone else!  Anyway, I made only one change, which I know from experience that it enhances the taste of the chocolate, and that was to use 8 ozs of hot medium roast coffee (from the Kuerig machine) instead of the cup of boiling water. Everything else was as written and it was perfect!  I have no Wilson cake pans but used my old Pyrex round baking dishes that I've had for over 45 years. I greased and floured the bottom and sides and I also cut a round piece of wax paper to put on the bottom to make the cake come out easier. Simple. The cake batter did not run over as some had stated...perhaps their pans didn't have high enough sides. Not sure but mine came out perfect. I cooled for about 10-12 minutes, then turned each pan out on a wire rack to cool thoroughly before frosting the cake. I used the frosting recipe given and the cake is a "masterpiece"!!

I used 2 cups flour, 3/4c hot coffee, and Hershey's special dark cocoa.  I baked in 9x13 and it came out great. Moist but maneuverable. For the frosting, since I was using the special dark, I only used a little over a half a cup of cocoa and that was plenty chocolatey for me. I really enjoyed the frosting. I thought it was a great flavor and texture and much easier than another chocolate frosting I use. I'll use this one from now on.

Absolutely perfect! The cake was so moist and tasty, and the frosting was to die for. I made a round cake in two 9" pans and still had a ton of frosting leftover though. Still, a delicious dessert and would definitely make again.

Outstanding! Easy to make and I used parchment on bottom of my cake pans to prevent sticking. I didn't have time to make the frosting but will definitely try the next time.

This was good.  The cake was great, but the frosting doesn't need as much sugar as the recipe calls for.  My chocolate-loving dad approves.

I made this for me and my girls, but my girl Alaska complained that she gained 1 pound and told me she was on a "strict diet".  Don't make this if one of yo' girls is a health freak. If not go crazy! (I also added extra sugar for taste)

If it looks like a chocolate sponge then it will probably taste like a chocolate sponge and that's exactly what this tasted like. I followed there recipe exactly. What I didn't take into account was my low altitude and I don't know if that would matter or not. It was the worst cake I have ever thrown away. The one I had to buy at Safeway's was WAY better.

Rating/review for FROSTING portion of recipe only: I have this recipe saved for two reasons: the cake itself and then the frosting. I had yellow cake mix that was going to expire so I whipped it together but wanted chocolate frosting. This buttercream frosting is totally awesome!! Followed the recipe instructions for the frosting to a "T" and had no issues. Will be my only chocolate frosting recipe from now on!! Thanks for sharing! I'll write another review when I make the cake ;) which I'm sure will be soon!

I give this recipe 4 stars because it was too sweet for me. I will definitely try again using less sugar in the cake and the frosting. The cake was very rich and moist but had crisp edges that I cut off before frosting it. It was undercooked at 30 minutes so I let it go for 35. Maybe that was too long.(3/18/17)

The best chocolate cake ever! I followed the recipe but made one change. I used Hershey's Dark Cocoa. As many other reviews have stated this is a very thin batter. Use a heavy cake pan(s) to bake your cake. Grease and flour well and bake immediately. This cake is now The Cake! Yummy!

This is a great recipe; it makes the most delicious, moist chocolate cake and can also be used for chocolate cupcakes as well. For making cupcakes, I found that it is best to bake the cupcakes for about 15 minutes at 350 and cool completely before removing from the pan.

This recipe is magical! Thank you so much for sharing it with us! As a pastor's wife  coming in to a new church, golden recipes like these are a must. All sorts of events require a great cake: potlucks, funerals, soup suppers... I made it yesterday for my husband's congregation's Lenten Soup Supper last night, and it was an absolute hit. One lady told me she liked it so much, she sneaked a second piece :D It's an easy recipe, totally delicious, and a great conversation starter. It's going in my "Tried & True" folder.

This cake is delicious and moist.
I made it Tuesday evening for my sons birthday party on Thursday and iced it on Wednesday evening. The cake was so moist on the Thursday and still today (Sunday)! It's been in my plastic cake box when not being consumed.
As I work in grams I used a converter, which does the maths for you which makes it so easy: http://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/tools/cupconverterwide?type=Dry+ingredients&ingredient=140g&cups=2&btnSub=Calculate&text=

I actually made this twice today.  First time I forgot the water!!!  No wonder it sunk in the middle, but hey the kids aren't picky, so we filled up that little  well with strawberry puree and they were happy.   The 2nd one turned out delish.  A bit hit at our afternoon get together.  I sprinkled between the layers and on top a mixture of crushed up pretzels, low sodium almonds, and unsweetened coconut flakes.  Took away some of the sweetness of that buttercream...yummy and lots of rave reviews from the guests.

Definitely the best chocolate cake I've ever made. Very moist and chocolaty without being too sweet. It was the first homemade cake I've ever done and I'll probably always use this one.

I made this cake for my mother-in-law for her birthday. I will preface this review with a disclaimer that I am genetically incapable of following a recipe. That being said, I did not have  any vegetable oil, so I replaced it with melted butter. I lined my 8 inch round cake pans with parchment then butter and flowered the pans. I place cooled cakes in the refrigerator over night in order to make the cake easier to torte. When I made the frosting I replace the milk with cream of coconut. (I love a hint of coconut). When putting the cake together I brushed each layer with some of the left over cream of coconut to keep the cake moist. I also toasted sliced almonds and encrusted the sides of the cake with them. I topped the cake with chocolate ganache made from milk chocolate chips and the remainder of the can of cream of coconut. The cake turned out wonderful! There truly was just a hint of the coconut, because the cake was so chocolatey.

This cake was so good!  I live at 5600 ft and did not change anything.  The cake fell (altitude) but I filled in the space with frosting!  I did what other reviewers suggested and let the cake cool for a full 20 minutes in the pans.  One still stuck a bit to the pan so I would suggest 25 minutes in the pan to cool.

I loved this cake, and so did my family. It was moist and rich. It had a deeply chocolate taste, I did make on little tweak though- I replaced the boiling water with freshly brewed coffee.

I used this to make cupcakes for my daughter's birthday celebration at school and they were DELICIOUS! Rich, moist, and chocolatey! I had never heard of adding the boiling water at the end before, but it really makes a difference! I'm sure coffee would have been great too, but I didn't think that was such a great idea to serve a bunch of 4- & 5-year-olds, haha! Halving this recipe and 18 minutes in the oven was perfect for a dozen cupcakes.

Amazing recipe! I have been using this recipe for seven years.  I do have to make a few adjustments  because we are  a Gluten,Egg, Soy ,dairy free home.  I use a gluten free flour blend (I make myself)  egg replacer,  and coconut milk. It tastes prefect even time.

I sub'd the boiling water for 8oz strong coffee like others suggested. Amazing!  The butter cream recipe yielded far more than I needed but I don't think it'll go to waste.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best chocolate buttercream cake he's ever had. I used the suggestion to sub a cup of coffee instead of the boiling water. I also ended up having to add about 4 tbsp extra milk for the frosting because it was very dry for me. It turned out perfect. I'll be making this one again for sure. Thanks!

This is the best chocolate scratch cake I have ever come across.  I made this as written with no changes.  The moisture of this cake is  unbelievable and it stays moist.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it!  He is a dark chocolate kind of guy but said it was the perfect amount of chocolate.  So the real chocolate lovers out there should really like this!  Don't let the batter being a pan of water scare you.  It did me at first as I have never seen cake batter that uses water and looks the way it did but clearly it is meant to be that way.  This is the chocolate cake recipe I will be using going forward.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

Used coffee instead of water(highly recommend)be sure to use parchment paper! Frosting needs something, more butter? less sugar? a good cake, not exceptional, the search goes on......

Awesome cake, moist and delicious.  Not too sweet.  Recipe is very easy to follow.  Decided to make it out of the blue on a stormy evening for my daughter's upcoming birthday (All ingredients were on hand)!  It was a great success!  Will make a big one for her birthday party (will see if I can make a marble cake out of the same ingredients).  Loved it!!!!!!

This is an awesome cake! My family and coworkers loved it. I was a little freaked out at first about the 2 cups of white sugar but , its good!! I made a chocolate ganache and added a little powdered sugar to frost it. Strawberries and whipped cream were a nice addition. I  lined the baking pans with wax paper for easy removal. I also messed up and added the hot water with all the other ingredients but it  did not seem to hurt the cake. Very moist cake.

Can't fault this recipe really. The only thing that I changed was the sugar. Used  less than 2 cups of brown sugar in the cake batter, and 100g less confectioners sugar in the frosting. Oh and I had a lot of frosting left so next round am probably going to reduce this bit. But that frosting though, oh my. Lovely. This recipe is definitely for keeps.

This was a wonderfully moist dense cake.  Made a few changes.  Used coconut oil instead of vegetable.  Half and half instead of milk. Coffee instead of boiling water.  And only 4 cups of powdered sugar.  So rich and delicious!!  Next time will only make half the icing recipe.  Ended with tons left over but that's probably because I didn't split the cake.

I have made this cake numerous times, and am glad to say that it is absolutely fantastic. The recipe produces an excellent, moist, rich (but not too sweet,) gooey chocolate cake that is to die for. Some notes I have are to follow:  
Your batter SHOULD be incredibly soupy and thin once you stir in the boiling water (slowly.) I was hesitant at first, but it cooks just fine and rises appropriately. 
If you are lactose intolerant or just simply do not have enough milk, you can substitute water and butter and there is no taste or texture difference at all. For every 1 cup of whole milk, substitute 2/3 cup water and 1 teaspoon of butter (softened.) 
Secondly, because this cake is SO moist, instead of a nonstick spray for your pans I recommend coating them with a Crisco baking stick. Just as you would use stick glue on paper, run it all around the edges and bottom of your pan. I have found this to work much better than spray.
And lastly, after removing from the oven, I immediately cover mine in aluminum foil for 1.5-2 hours and let them sit, undisturbed. This locks in moisture and prevents the cake from having the texture of "just another grocery store bakery cake." 
This recipe is super easy and the icing is great too! The icing recipe has always left me with extra, but dipping strawberries in it or frosting a batch of cup cakes are the two best things that I have found to do with the left-overs. I highly recommend this cake! It is AMAZING!

Made cupcakes instead of a cake, but followed recipe exactly.  This tasted just as good as a boxed cake, but no weird ingredients, and came together very easily.

Thanks for a great recipe!

The icing was excellent!  I had to add more sugar but that may have been because I cut the recipe in half and wasn't exact in measuring 1/6 cup.

The texture of the cake was spot on but it was pretty bland.  I did overcook the cake a smidge but I don't think that should change the taste that much.  That is why I am giving this recipe a 3.

I used 2 7x2 pans with no baking boil overflow, but I put a sheet on the lower rack just in case.  Cooked 30 minutes until the toothpick came out clean with some sponge bounce back. Next time I will use parchment rounds since the cake is hard to get out of the pan even with butter and floured pan.  I iced into a 4 layer cake, but I ended up having to piece the top layers back together due to sticking in the pans. I did use hot coffee instead of water.  The batter will be runny, but bakes up fine. For the icing I swapped out raspberry extract for the vanilla to add a extra layer of flavor and then topped with the crumbs that stuck to the bottom of the pans. Very rich moist cake....just wish I had some ice cream to go with it!

This cake was so good! Incredibly moist and delicious. I kept it a two layer cake. Since my oven is hotter than most, I reduced the temp to 325 and also switched the pans half way through between the bottom and top racks. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of not greasing the sides of the pan to allow the batter to "climb" up the sides - I think this with the reduced temperature is what gave me pretty flat tops (minimal peaking!). I was low on powdered sugar so only made 2/3 of the frosting and it was plenty for a two layer cake that had frosting in between the layers. will make again, for sure!

Great moist cake, I did substitute  hot coffee for the boiling water as suggested in many reviews. Next time I will use parchment rounds in the bottom of cake pans along with greasing and flouring the pan bottoms, very hard getting cake removed from pan.

The cake was excellent.  The icing followed as written didn't work so well though. Couldn't use the amount of sugar called with the amount of milk called for.  Wouldn't have been able to spread it.  Used 4 cups of sugar and a cup of milk.  Still a bit stiff but I was worried to use too much milk.  The taste of the completed cake was excellent - just like the cake Costco makes!  Thanks for sharing.

Only did the dough. Baked it in a 38*42 cm tray and then cut in half. Baked through nicely, the edges were about 1 cm high and the centre around 3 cm. The flavour was so RICH. Will do again but maybe use a little less sugar since I like the frosting to be sweet but that would have been an overload. This time used cream cheese mixed with whipped cream.

Absolutely delicious. I made this cake  for New Year. Used 3 times the amount of frosting because I made a rosette cake. Huge hit. Highly recommend this recipe. The tip about using hot coffee works beautifully.

I made this cake exactly as specified and frosted with a vanilla buttercream.  It is the softest, most moist cake I've ever had, and were it even one ounce softer, it would literally be pudding.  If you want an attractive cake, this is not the recipe for you.  I let it sit for 30 minutes out of the oven, then cut around the edges with a sharp knife and carefully separated the cake from the pans with a spatula.  I still ended up with the outermost layer of cake still stuck on the pan.   There is just no way to avoid destroying the soft, spongy edges.  If I were to decide to stack this cake again, I would definitely freeze first, and I'm not sure even that would keep it firm enough to hold its shape.  Next time, I'll just pour it into an 11x14 and tell people to attack it with spoons.

Oh my goodness. I was inspired by a wonderful man and refreshing relationship to bake a cake for his birthday. The kitchen is not my thing.   I try I promise I do but we never seem to jive. My cupboards are overflowing with seasoning and ingredients from dishes I tried to take on. Anywho back to this man and his birthday. Months ago he expressed his favorite cake was chocolate on chocolate and his favorite baker was his mom. Him being from out of town and his mom not here to do the honors  I decided to take this one on and have been eyeing the recipe for months. However I've never baked anything other than the refrigerated nestle cookies :) . I practiced on a box cake over the weekend and was pleased with the results. I paroosed through the comments for notes,bought myself a $35 stand up mixer on sale from target, rolled up my sleeves and took a dive headfirst. And guess what?!! I made it and it is DELICIOUS and there were only a few hiccups in the process...

This may be flawed logic but I believe it was slightly overcooked after I left in the oven for 35 minutes and I had preheated the oven for awhile as I gathered ingredients. I think 30 min would have been perfect. 

My icing was super thick and didn't have that rich chocolate color.  I improvised (yay me!) and worked out the consistency. It was so darn good and I was a bit over a cup short of confection sugar.  I think I messed up with whipping the butter and the directions about alternating ingredients? Had no idea what

This cake is very moist and delicious. Recipe calls for too much frosting so I cut it in half and had plenty to frost all layers.

What an amazing cake. I did make 2 alterations specifically for Christmas. I used 8 ounces brewed decaf coffee instead of boiling water and I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract to the icing. I called it my peppermint mocha cake and it was delicious!

Loved this cake.  Delicious.  I divided the layers to make 4, like the video.  This really made it beautiful, but they were thin and a little trickier to deal with.  The edges were crumbly, but I just put them back in to fill in spaces and it worked.  I used it for Christmas, so ties a big bow around it to hold it together.  It really was beautiful.  I also used coffee as suggested, however, next time will use water.  It was a little "dark chocolate" to me, but still delicious.  Also, next time, I will serve with a scoop of ice cream.

Best chocolate cake ever. I did need to let it cool longer than suggested in the pan to keep it from falling out of the pan. I also used heavy whipping cream since I had no regular milk. It was absolutely delicious. To add to the flavor I used coffee of water.

It was -10 Celsius outside, and I had a hankering for cake, and I had most of these ingredients in my pantry. I subbed melted butter for the oil since I didn't think olive oil would be tasty and it was all I had on hand.  I used coffee in place of the boiling water as some others suggested. I baked it in a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper. Great cake, delicious and moist.  Only had enough icing sugar for half the frosting but a half batch was enough.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe i've ever made. I used one 8 1/2 by 11 pan, and cooked it an additional 10 minutes (40-45 min). Frosting was so creamy!

I made mine in a Bundt pan and halved the icing recipe since I only needed enough to cover the outside.  I also melted a stick of real cows butter and used it instead of the vegetable oil in the cake recipe.  This cake is so rich that my chocoholic daughter couldn't finish 1 regular slice at a sitting.  Very easy to make and delicious.  I have passed this on to others.

MAJOR HIT!!!!
I wanted a three tier cake so just poured evenly into 3 pans... adjusted the cooking time shorter.  Hindsight- should have taken out of the oven even sooner.  Still delicious but the cake part too dry on day one.  Fortunately it got better and by day three, so flavorful.  Also, I made twice the amount of frosting - so I could overdo it on all the layers-also a super hit.  I did reduce the amount of powdered sugar so the frosting had an even stronger cocoa taste... but that was just my personal preference.  All the boys loved this cake and one even asked me what secret ingredient I put in it... This is my chocolate cake favorite recipe now.

The coffee (in lieu of hot water) mentioned in previous comments is a must!  Also, I put the mix in 3 Pans so I didn't have to cut the cake to make 4 layers. 3 layers was perfect. 2nd time making this cake. It will become part of my holiday staples.

Am I the only person who found this terribly sweet? 
Maybe UK tastes differ from US tastes. I made this twice, the second time swapping the ratio of flour and sugar. I also used coffee instead of the hot water. Much better for my palate with the lower sugar.
I also used a plain chocolate ganache to coat, again mainly due to the sweetness levels. 
Am now playing around with gluten and lactose free versions. Does anyone have a tried and trusted  recipe please?
Thanks.

The cake is delicious. Everyone loved it. I would make a different frosting next time. The amount it makes is way too much, almost double what you need, and the frosting is a bit too sweet for the cake.

This was the first time in my life that I made a chocolate cake and this recipe was amazing! I followed each and every instruction religiously and also followed the tip by previous reviewers of adding boiling water with coffee to the batter. I also reduced the amount of sugar suggested in the recipe to half to suit my taste. It is very important to let the cake rest and cool after it is out of the oven or you might risk it falling apart. I used a springform pan and it was easier to release the cake from the pan.  I loved making this cake! It was moist and rich and my guests were blown away at the first bite.

Absolutely delicious and one the moistest chocolate cakes that I’ve ever had. 
I was afraid that as I read in some of the reviews the boiling water makes it break and I added just a little bit less (3/4 cup), and I let it cool down for like 30 minutes. Anyway, it came off the bakeware just perfect.

I followed the recipe except now I realize I left out the salt. It was amazingly moist, problem was it had absolutely no flavor. I couldn't taste the chocolate at all nor was it sweet. I will definitely try this again (because I always try things twice )but maybe add more cocoa powder and sugar  to see if there is a difference and of course update my review.
update 6/26/17
The first time I made this recipe I didnt make the icing that went with it and there was my missing flavor and sweetness so made it again exactly and wow what a difference that made. I love this recipe

This was the best cake I ever eaten in my LIFE!!!!! My whole family and all of our friends literally said that this was the most amazing cake EVER!!! I did make a slight change with the frosting. Instead of using  cocoa power I used melted semi-sweet baking chocolate. I just melted the chocolate and let it cool slightly and then added it to the rest of the frosting. Thanks again, this the most amazing cake ever :)

Extraordinary cake! I follow the cake directions to the core and the Chocolate cake turned out exquisite and very moist! However, for the frosting part I decided to cut the powder sugar short from 5 cups to 3 cups and less milk (almost a cup) and extra vanilla extract and the results were fabulous. The frosting turned out lighter, perfectly sweet and fluffy! I am very happy with this recipe and most likely I will be making it again:)) Thanks for the sweetness!!!

This turned out very good - moist, rich, and dense. And the chocolate buttercream was great! This cake definitely needs a tall glass of milk or a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. It is very rich!

I'm a novice baker and I have to say, this cake was easy to make and it came out perfect!  I made some slight changes, added a touch more flour for high altitude, and took the advice of a few others and added hot coffee instead of hot water, and for the frosting, I used half the sugar, only 1 cup of cocoa, and just drizzled the milk into the mix a tablespoon at a time (did not use the full recommended amount) and even that came out delicious!  Very moist and rich!  I'm very happy with the outcome since it was for a special occasion.  I will definitely make again!  Thank you!
P.s. I must also reiterate what others are saying about thoroughly buttering and flouring the pans prior to putting the mix in them and cool the cake, very important to allow the cake to cool thoroughly BEFORE taking out of the pans.  This will save you from having a broken cake.

Best chocolate cake i have ever made. The only thing different I did was to add about 1/2 teaspoon of ground coffee to the dry mix in order to make the chocolate a bit richer. Will have this as a go-to in my recipe book.

This recipe absolutely cannot be salvaged. The batter was extremely thin and liquidy, the cake had to cook for way longer than the recipe stated to become anything even vaguely resembling a cake. The cake broke immediately upon trying to remove it from the pan, despite letting it cool for plenty of time. The texture was indescribably strange and the flavor was off-putting. I followed the directions exactly aside from letting it bake longer (it would have been soup if I didn't). I haven't the foggiest how people made this mess into a proper cake, but I assume everyone must have made very heavily modifications.

Outstanding cake.  Family said its the best cake they've ever had.  Only modification I made was I took Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate 72% Cacao bar (3.5oz) and shaved it.  I then placed the shavings on the top and sides of the cake.  It added an outstanding flavor and was greatly additive to the icing.

Awesome cake!  I had to bake it longer than stated in directions but it could be my oven. I did only 2 layers & put fresh strawberry slices on top of the frosting between the layers. Delicious!

very rich and moist chocolate cake, just a little bit to sweet for me but very easy and simple recipe to follow, for the frosting make sure to mix it long enough with electric mixer.

Trust your gut with the batter.  You don't have to stick to the recipe exactly for it to still turn out wonderful.  (When making the batter, I knew it was supposed to be runny but I still added in a bit more flour than it called for and it turned out fine.  I also reduced the amount of butter and cocoa powder.   It was still very moist and maybe even a bit too much chocolate flavour.) I loved this recipe, but instead of making a large cake, I instead made seven cupcakes.  I reduced the serving size from twelve to four and it still gave me 7-8 full sized cupcakes.  Before you put it into the oven, make sure that you only fill about 3/4 full.  My cupcakes rose way over the top, and I filled them about 80% of the way.  Following other suggestions, I let them sit out for more than ten minutes before removing them from the pan and wrappers, because they were still a bit gooey on the inside.

Very tasty and dark. It smells heavenly and The taste seems to match. The batter never really "puffed" next time I'm thinking of keeping it all in one pan.

If I could give this cake a dozen stars it still wouldn't be enough.  This is, without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten.  I followed the recipe with one exception, I used buttermilk instead of regular whole milk.  I was a little skeptical after adding the boiling water because the batter seemed too thin, but I used two 9 inch pans and it came out perfect.  I waited the recommended 10 minutes, split each layer and slathered it with Extreme Chocolate Frosting.  Everyone was oohing and ahhing  over how moist and delicious it was.  What a great recipe.

I loved this cake.  I did mix up the recipe a bit and made it with a different frosting: Chocolate Fudge Buttercream (also from this site.  In addition, I spread a layer of creamy peanut butter in between the layers because my husband is a sucker for chocolate & peanut butter.  I'm so glad I read other reviews first, otherwise I would have been concerned about the consistency of the batter.  It's extremely thin, practically runny.  But don't worry - bake as directed & you will be rewarded with the most moist & rich chocolate cake you have ever eaten.

I made a double batch and used it to make cupcakes for my daughter's birthday.  I used half sugar and half Splenda and it turned out great. 
It was definitely moist and still good two days later.  The frosting was a nice surprise.  My frosting usually fails but this one was "me" proof. 
I had high hopes that this would be a match for a chocolate cake from a local bakery but alas,  my search continues. 
This is a good recipe,  but not the best.  
Still worth it for the ease of preparation.  My kids did most of the work,  I mostly supervised.  :)
I'll make it again.

I loved making this cake !! I did not separate into 2 , 9'in rounds because I did not have 2 :( ... therefore I had I think somewhere in between a 12 and 14' round and put all the batter in. I am very glad I did that as it held together nicely. After reading reviews it seemed to prove the best result the longer the cake has to cool I allowed the cake to cool for 30 minutes and frosted however there is way too much icing leftover that I wont use so that would be my only tip if you are going to use 2-9' rounds then that much icing seems ok but not if you are making only one cake. Also , I cut the sweetness of the icing and added water instead of milk and 2 tablespoons margarine and 1 tablespoon of tofutti cream cheese because I am lactose intolerant. So , I tweeked the frosting recipe and made it to suit my preferred flavor profiles and WOW ! the difference it made! This cake is moist , the frosting is perfect and I topped it with sliced fresh strawberries!!! SO GOOD!!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever made!! I was a bit skeptical about adding a cup of boiling water to the recipe but I'm not a huge baker so I figured, what the hell.  The batter was very watery and I wasn't sure it would rise or even cook! But low and behold, it did!  This cake is the most softest and moist cake I've ever eaten.  Brought some to work and everyone loved it. I'm saving this one for sure!

I love this recipe! It is always a hit! I often make it as cupcakes following exactly the same cake recipe with a vanilla/lemon cream cheese icing to contrast with the rich chocolately cupcake. As other reviewers suggested, it tastes great with coffee instead of boiling water. When I make a single recipe it makes approximately 25 cupcakes (I fill each cupcake cup about 2/3 full of batter).

My 11 year old daughter wanted to bake a cake from scratch, a first for me. We picked out this recipe together, bought the 2 ingredients we needed, and went to work. The results were more than we could have hoped for! 
We only made two layers, so we had plenty of frosting to spare. Speaking of the frosting, what a mess to make! Powdered sugar everywhere, but I will NEVER buy canned frosting again. 
The cake was so moist and rich and decadent. It lasted for less than a day...the only bummer about  the whole experience.

Great cake, used the tip from other reviews and used coffee instead of boiling water...perfect. I used my stand mixer on stir to incorporate the coffee and did not have any problems with the batter. I will definitely make this cake again. Very moist and frosting was very good also.

Best chocolate cake out there. I am almost sick of making it because I get so many requests to bring this cake!! So moist! I use cream cheese icing to really amp it up. Can be difficult to remove from the pans, I recommend for sure using a cut piece of parchment paper on the bottom, and grease/butter the sides well. Also if decorating, freeze first to make it way way easier!

I had three 9-inch pans and made 3 layers.  Plenty of frosting and amazing birthday cake for a chocolate loving daughter.  I followed the recipe except used hot coffee instead of water and used parchment paper instead of greasing and flouring the pan.  I didn't grease the sides so the cake would rise nicely.  Love this cake!!

I am a chocolate cake fiend and this is my favorite!
Easy to make with the kids, deliciously moist, chocolate heaven. 

I use coffee instead of hot water (and I don't even like coffee) - it gives the chocolate flavor an extra punch.

Exceptional.

Made this exactly as written, was the best cake recipe! Never buying a box cake mix again. The only thing different thing i did was added just a bit more milk for the frosting to thin it out some. Do cool cake completely before frosting and layering cake. We couldnt wait much longer. Definitely need a glass of milk along side. a homerun dessert.

I have made dozens of recipes from this site but this is the first one that inspired me to leave a review. This is everything a chocolate cake should be -- rich, chocolaty, and decadent. I have made it six times this summer for birthdays and dinner guests and it is my go-to now -- goodbye "Betty Crocker Chocolate Cake." Hello "Extreme Chocolate Cake!" It really is best exactly as written -- the frosting suits it well. I found like other reviewers that it tastes better the second day so I make the cake a day early.

This recipe is great!!! I took the suggestions of other reviews and added hot coffee in place of water. Amazing!! It was moist and delicious. I didn't follow the frosting recipe as I needed a more stable buttercream.

Ok so this was my first cake ever and I followed it to a T except a touch less sugar in the cake batter. It was AMAZING!!! So easy, moist, fluffy, and everyone at the party was raving about it. I had a bit of icing left over as I tried to not overdo it and it worked well. I'm sure some would prefer to use it all. Completely recommend and will make again.

I made this yesterday for my husband's birthday. It is without a doubt one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever tasted. It's restaurant quality. Incredibly moist, rich, and not too sweet. The recipe was easy to follow, baked in perfect time, frosting was light and fluffy and delicious. I made sure to keep the cakes in the pans for at least ten minutes before removing them as was suggested. I would definitely make this cake again.

Very moist and delicious! Use name brand ingredients, it makes a difference. Also, I added about a tsp of cinnamon to the batter. Awesome addition!

Terrific icing recipe. 5 cups of powdered sugar seemed like a lot so I mixed the other ingredients & added the sugar 1 cup at a time. I was happy with 3 cups. You could certainly add more or less though. The cake turned out so awesome. With 3 drops of peppermint oil in the batter + mint chocolate chips on top, it was delicious!

The chocolate cake itself was delicious. It was dense, yet moist. I used parchment paper to ensure it didn't stick to the pan as per other reviews. There is nothing wrong with the consistency of the batter, most good chocolate cakes are runny prior to baking.  I  gave this cake the low rating because of the icing. It was way too sweet and overpowering for the cake. It has so much sugar in it, it actually made two guests sick with sweats and shakes after they ate it. I will keep the cake recipe and use a different icing.

Love the cake. Like really really love it. I will make it a lot in my future. The frosting was a bit much for me. It is a really rich combination. For those that love dark chocolate this is it. but for my kiddos who are more of a milk chocolate fan it might be be too much. 

I still used this frosting (it made so much), but after frosting it and trying a bite I went back over the cake and removed almost all of the frosting so it looked more like a thin crumb coat. For my family this was a perfect combo. it was still rich, but not the im gonna get sick from 2 bites rich.

Wonderful cake. Family and friends loved the cake. 
Baked at 350 Fahrenheit 
Mine is not a built in cake so it take 60 mins.

Added chocolate syrup to the cake and made chocolate cake mud and it is just wow

This was the first search result when I searched Best Chocolate Cake. We made it and I have never searched for another cake recipe since. I just came across this a week and a half ago and we have already made it 4 times. In a bunt pan twice, and as muffins twice. I don't know if I will ever buy a cake mix again. If only I could find a spice cake recipe this good I would be set.

I did make a couple of small changes, but this cake was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!! Instead of boiling water, I used strong freshly brewed coffee, and in place of vegetable oil I used extra virgin olive oil. The batter was very thin, and I was worried at first, but the cake turned out amazingly moist and perfect. I would give it 10 stars if I could!

I used 1 cup of very hot coffee instead of water in the cake mix.  I also cut the sugar in the frosting by half as I prefer it a bit less sweet and instead of milk I again used iced coffee with milk added.  I  omitted the vanilla.  A delicious cake the best chocolate cake ever.

Everyone loves it, even the "cake-haters"! I subbed in coconut oil, and used a sprayed bundt pan and it turned out beautifully!

This is so good. The cake was very moist. I would like to make it with coffee next time. I will substitute the boiling water for a cup of very hot coffee. The icing was ok. My family like my own recipe which is made with honey. I thought the recipes icing was good but not as thick as I would like. I will be making this my go to cake.
update : I do not add as much water as recommended. The cake does not rise with that much water. With less water or milk it is perfect.

This cake is fabulous! My husband searched the internet,  read dozens of cake recipes and reviews before he decided that this was the one for his birthday,  and since making it he has decided that he wants this every year.


I followed the advice of previous posters and switched the boiling water for hot coffee, I also used 1/2 cup melted butter in place of the vegetable oil, and I used  Valrohna Dutch  processed  cocoa powder for both cake and frosting (the cake rose just fine).

I liked the taste and texture of the frosting, but the cake was falling to pieces because it was too tender for the frosting.  I ended up placing it in the freezer for twenty minutes so it would firm up and I could frost it. Next time I'll thin the frosting a bit more with milk. I covered the outside in an 86% chocolate bar that I had shredded. Now I'm going to go have another slice!

Made this cake for Father's Day. It's my new "go to" chocolate cake!!!  I followed directions for cake to the letter and baked for 35 minutes, it was perfect. I did not make the frosting. Instead, I made a whipped cream frosting and added a layer of raspberry filling as per hubby's request. It was the star of the show.

I've made this cake twice now, it really should have five stars. It was too die for!!!! The family loves it
First time I made it by the book if you know what I mean. Today I used Pure Palm -organic coconut palm sugar
And coffee instead of hot water. You will not be disappointed , I let cool ten minutes, Had no  trouble depanning, as  today I greased &  floured pans and then cut out parchment paper for just the bottom. A great touch. This icing recipe is so much like the one in my head I've used for years. But  tried following it by the book!!  it was awesome.
I used two 9" square pans

Followed this recipe exactly, except I added coffee instead of boiling water per other reviewers suggestions.  It is delicious!  Super chocolatey!  I can't imagine adding dark chocolate like another reviewer suggested.  As is, I'm calling it my Matilda cake.  You've seen that movie, right?  Delicious cake, would definitely make again.  Made for chocolate lovers.

Wow!  I made this today for my chocolate loving  husband's birthday. This recipe definitely holds up to its reputation on this site.  I have never made cake and frosting from scratch but do have cooking experience.  I was worried i would ruin it somehow so i was very careful about following the measurements exactly.  My only change was that i had three  8 inch round pans.  I spread the mixture evenly and watched them cook like a hawk as i knew this would bring down the cooking time.  (Ended up being approx 20 minutes) Be patient removing them from pans. ..the longer the better.  Taste testing the batter and frosting i knew it would be good. ...but it far exceeded my expectations.   My husband put on a show for us and literally hit the floor.  If you live around chicago, this cake blows away portillos. It is fresh and really unbelievable. (And no mayo, yuk) Don't hesitate making this recipe. It is worth it.  I mean jaws dropped can't stop talking about it, even after your full from it worth it.

Love this recipe. Followed it to a T. Nothing added nothing changed. I made this for my husbands birthday. Doubled the batch  which have me 2 9in pan cakes filled half way, and 3 dz cupcakes also filled batter half way. It gave the perfect rise in pans and so moist. I gave it 4 stars, because I didn't make the frosting given but melted chocolate and drizzzled over the cake and cupcakes. My family enjoyed this and so did my husband's co-workers.

Absolutely the most moist cake and delicious chocolate frosting we've ever made. We baked the cake 5 or 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but that could just be our oven. We're definitely keeping this recipe to make again and again.

This was absolutely amazing. Like the best chocolate cake I have had! I made one change, I switched out regular cocoa powder for special dark. I would definitely recommend doing that! It made a super moist, dense, delicious chocolate cake that wasn't too rich. Try this - you won't regret it!!

Really awesome recipe, it really doesn't need all the frosting. Next time I think I will leve out a few cups of the sugar in the frosting.  Serve this cake with a large glass of cold milk!

Great cake!! Very easy to make.  I also substituted Coffee in stead of water.  In addition, I made raspberry sauce and let it absorbed into each layer.  I used the cream cheese chocolate frosting found in this website.

This is truly the best chocolate cake I have EVER tasted. I made it as written. I was making 2 different cakes for graduation so I made the frostings and refrigerated them for a week. As others noted, I would allow the cake to cool longer than 10 minutes. Even at 20 minutes, the bottom was still a tiny bit wet. This required very careful handling of the split layers, and one did tear. Everyone raved about this cake and suggested that I make them to sell.

While looking through these recipes for my grandma's b day, my mom said she found a recipe in her thing, and I said, Il just look through these first, then see. She went upstairs, and I found this recipe. I went upstairs to show it to her, and reading the ingredients. She said the one downstairs sounds alot like that. I looked, and they were the same! Everything about it was the same! 

Other than that, it was awesome! I did over cook them, because I did the instructions for the cake while doing cupcakes, but flavor was AMAZING!

The cake tastes good but you can't just use plain butter for the baking pans. I did and the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan. At first i thought it was the water but a friend of mine said that the boiling water for sterlizing the coaco powder. 

I would use any baking non stick spray or at least the old fasion method of flour and oil. 
The icing came out good but a little sweet. (I had to grind regular sugar down to make it powdered).

The overall cake was good.

I'm not a huge cake lover, but I decided to make this for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone loved it! I substituted coffee for water as well.  I also made a different frosting because I don't believe I made the one in the recipe correctly, it wasn't very creamy, I still used it for the top of the cake and the in between part but I mixed cream cheese frosting in it for the side of the cake.  Everybody loved it!

Unreal cake. 
Followed the recipe but had to add more milk to the frosting. I could seriously sit down and eat the whole thing with a fork. It is amazing!!! Will be making this one from now on.

I didn't particularly care for the texture of the cake, and found the taste is just so-so. The frosting, once you play with it, is awesome. Definitely bakery quality after adjusting the milk to confectioner's sugar ratio to get a smooth, creamy frosting.

So very moist and chocolaty!!! I was concerned with adding the water, the batter was very thin, but it came out so good. I couldn't try the frosting to go with it since I used up the last of my coco powder, but thankfully had a can of vanilla in the cupboard that went great with it.  Saving this one to use again and again ;)

This cake is exactly what I was craving. Other than substituting half the oil with applesauce and using chocolate milk rather than white, I followed the recipe.
Next time I will try to substitute coffee for the water as other reviewers have stated. I cannot rate the frosting because I didn't use any.

The cake was ok. Nothing special. I added 1 cup of strongly brewed coffee instead of boiling water to add a bit to the overall taste. The icing on the other hand was WAY too sweet as there was too much sugar called for in this recipe. I reduced the sugar to two cups and salvaged the icing by adding two packages of cream cheese. MUCH better that way.

Great chocolate cake, I wouldn't use any other recipe! The one change I make is I use a cup of coffee  instead of boiling water, and it really enhances the chocolate flavor. Fabulous cake!

This truly is the best chocolate cake in the world!  I hadn't made a cake from scratch in ages but I followed the directions carefully and it came out great.  It was so moist!  
Also, the frosting was perfect for this cake.
It came out looking more professional than any cake I'd ever made before, too.  I think that was due to the way the frosting adhered to the cake and made a perfectly shaped dessert!
I would give it an A+

Great recipe, though I'm not sure why it's on here twice.  The cake is the same as the Extreme Chocolate Cake by shirleyo. EXACTY the same.   Regardless...I made no changes.  I never thought I'd be able to replace a box mix, but this recipe is great! It's my go-to recipe.

This was the same recipe as "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III", but it has a chocolate frosting. I followed this recipe, but I did not use the chocolate frosting. 

I followed the cake  instruction exactly, and it came out delicious. I bake a lot, but this was my first time making a layered cake. I was intimidated because I thought it would fall apart. It didn't. It was absolutely perfect. 

The cake was very moist and fudgy, and came out of the pan perfectly after 10 min. I let cool down on cooling racks. I slices fresh strawberries and made a whip cream filling for the center. I frosted the entire cake with a homemade whip cream frosting. I topped it off with fresh strawberries, and I drizzled chocolate all over the top. TOO DIE FOR! 

I will definatley make this again!

Just a wonderful cake all around. I too had some trouble with the cake sticking to the pan, but will let it cool for a longer time in the future.

I never use oil when I bake - I always opt for melted butter + sour cream. As mentioned in a few other comments, I used hot coffee instead of boiling water. Delightful! Also made a cream cheese/chocolate frosting instead of what was listed on the original recipe. Came out very good! Will make again. :)

I have not baked a cake in 35 years, since I was a kid in 4-H.  This is an easy recipe that yields a deep, dark, glistening product.  It is just pretty.  It is moist. If I make another chocolate cake, I will make this one again, for sure. I used strong, hot coffee instead of the water, per some other reviewers recommendations.  I did not have a cake pan, so used a 9x9x2 baking pan,  and had batter left over for 6 cupcakes.  Baking time was 40 minutes, with testing every 5 minutes with fingers for spring, and a toothpick. Let cool for 20, after loosening the sides. Cake is heavier than box brands, denser, richer. Used a chocolate cream cheese frosting on the outside, chocolate buttercream on the inside, while still warm, creating some seriously oozey goodness.  Experienced no problem whatsoever. Easy peasy.

Simply the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Family agrees wholeheartedly. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it took an extra 5 min. cook time. This cake is destined to become often made family classic.

Omg. I've never made a cake from scratch before so when I made the battery and it was liquidity I got so nervous. But the finish product was amazing. The frosting is just do die for and the cake is so yummy! Definitely making this again.

I followed this cake to the T. only thing i changed was i didnt have baking powder so i used additional baking powder and vinegar for the levaning agent. AMAZING. has a pudding cake texture. the frosting yielded the proper amount. i just noticed it was  a bit stiff, had to add some more milk by eye. I do not suggest cooking the 35 minutes, i cooked for 29 minutes then let rest and it turned out perfect.

Delicious cake!! No problems with release from pan - would definitely recommend parchment paper...I used that and let the cake cool for 15-17 minutes, and it released perfectly. Cake and icing are truly one of the best I've ever made!!

The only cake my youngest son wants for his birthday. I have made it for my sweetheart too and have taken it to pot lucks at work as well. The best chocolate cake I have ever had.  It's a 10 star recipe. Actually easy to make. I do 2 layers instead of four, as I'm not talented enough to split the two layers because the cake is so moist. Thank you for this recipe. It's the only one I use.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out perfectly moist and delicious! I think it's the best cake I've made yet. I followed the instructions exactly, except I used the hot coffee instead of water for the batter, as other reviewers have suggested. It was so good my boyfriend who's not that big on sweets even went back for seconds. Follow the instructions and you won't be disappointed!

rich and dense, just what a chocolate cake lover wants.  some chocolate cakes can be dry.  Not this one.  it almost seems as if the cake was not done baking, that is how moist it is.  this will be my go-to recipe for chocolate cake.  and the icing was a perfect pairing!

I will certainly make this cake again and again, never buy store bought box cake or icing again! However a secrect I scrolled upon some time ago has been a big hit for chocolate cake is to substitute the water for fresh coffee, it brings out such a rich flavour. Follow the recipie and the cake will be rich and moist. Do make sure you greese and flour your pans well and let it completely cool before you try to remove the cake from the pans, or you will get a crumble cake.

This is the BEST cake ever.  Delicious chocolate cake that's rich but not overly sweet.  It doesn't rise much so expect to make two batches for a tall cake, and quite dense without being hard to eat.  Followed cake recipe exactly but never tried the frosting.  I pair it with some cream cheese whipped cream frosting.   Perfection.

I have made this cake twice now. Both times I followed the cake recipe to a T. The cake is amazing; dense, fudgey, moist and very delicious. With the chocolate buttercream frosting though, it was too much sweetness for my tastes. The second time I made it, I used cherry pie filling in between the layers and whipped cream with chocolate shavings for the icing.  This really balanced out the sweetness of the cake, and I LOVED it. Everyone raved, even usual non cake eaters. Don't be discouraged by the thin soupy batter, it still works beautifully.

Absolutely, hands down the best chocolate cake I ever made. I substituted hot coffee for the boiling water..awesome!!!
It is so moist it did stick to the pans so definitely prep pans well. I only sprayed with Pam. Topped it with Eve's restaurant buttercream..family said they now want this for their birthday cake! This will be my go-to chocolate cake.

Definitely my go to chocolate cake recipe!
Have made the cake numerous times varying  the frosting and the decors each time. 
Sometimes I leave it in the pan and simply pour a chocolate ganache on top and add sprinkles. When I have more time I remove the cake from the pan, pour the ganache then decorate it with white or dark chocolate curls and when I am really into it, I go over the top and pipe out buttercream roses.
Everyone simply loves the chocolaty richness of the cake and I like that it is so easy to make.

I'm not a big chocolate lover but I do enjoy eating a really good moist chocolate cake on occasion.  I tried this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday and we both loved it!  He loved it so much that he almost ate a quarter of the cake as soon as it was done. lol!  I followed the recipe as given with the following exceptions:
1. I added 2 tablespoons of ground instant coffee dark roast to the batter. (Most people add brewed coffee but I think you accomplish the same thing by just adding the coffee grinds because you still add boiling water to the batter at the end.)
2. I used coconut milk and coconut oil to make it healthier and even more moist. (You don't taste the coconut though.)
3. I used Pyrex 9" round glassware with parchment paper on the bottom of the pan only, then greased and floured them. It allows them to transfer out the pan easier. Note: I also waited for 15-20 minutes before taking them out the pans.
4. I used ready made Dark Chocolate frosting instead of making my own and it still turned out Excellent. (Yeah, I'm a bit semi-homemade.)  ;)
Overall it is a must try recipe.  It is so easy to make and wonderful to eat!

A super simple, rich and moist cake - I was concerned at first because the batter was so soupy, but it turned out fabulously.  I have been looking for a moist Chocolate cake recipe for my cake business for a while...  I love this recipe, as do my customers!  It is great!

I learned once that a way to make cake even moister is to cover it in foil or plastic wrap immediately after it comes out of the oven and put it in the freezer for awhile.  This traps all of the moisture that would normally evaporate.  This is the best chocolate cake recipe regardless, but I think that tip makes it an outstanding recipe!

NOOOOOOO!!!! I didn't put the boiling water in and it's already in the oven!! That's what happens when you bake with a 5 year old, I suppose. I'm 5 star-ing the batter. Licking the bowl with said 5 year old was absolutely lovely. It was a nice memory at least. Will bake again next time we need a cake.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It is delicious!!! I have made this cake several times.  The first time I made it exactly as written in the recipe.  It was fabulous. Each time thereafter, I dissolved 2 tsp. of instant coffee granules in the boiling water for the batter and dissolved a teaspoon of coffee granules in the milk for the frosting.  WOWWW! Didn't think it could be better, but it was off the charts.  It's moist and chocolatey! You won't be disappointed!

This was the first homemade cake I made and was a little nervous about bringing it to the office in fear of it not turning out.  I followed the directions exactly and it was AWESOME.  Everyone raved about it.  This is a keeper.

Absolute heaven !  I followed the directions and it turned out great. I used a bundt pan. I followed other people's suggestions on making sure it's greased and floured really good. I let it sit for 10 min before I even thought of flipping it out of the pan. My Only adjustment was the cooking time. I cooked for 45 min and then checked it with my cake tester. I did cut the icing recipe in half, and then put it into a piping bag and drizzled it onto the cooled cake. But we don't care for too much sweet. It was perfect!

I used hot coffee instead of boiling water. I tell you, this cake it the best. I added a layer of marshmallows in the middle layer, as well as a little cream cheese frosting for the top, but the inside layers all got a good dose of the chocolate frosting in this recipe. I just prefer cream cheese frosting for the top.

I never review recipes but I made this for my husband's birthday and he really liked it. I think it tastes like a store bought cake mix but it is definitely moist and very easy to make. I would use less sugar in the frosting and a little more butter.

I loved this cake. It came out moist. I have never made a homemade cake before without a store bought box and this was the best one I've ever had. I made it exactly as directed, except I didn't make the buttercream frosting. I like whipped cream frosting so I used another recipe for the frosting. My kids loved it and so did I. I will definitely be making this many more times!

Be prepared for this to stick to your pan, had I not greased thoroughly this would have been a pain.
I added brewed coffee instead of water, plus two table spoons of instant coffee to the batter. Intensifies the chocolate flavor and doesn't taste like coffee. The frosting was pretty basic so I tweaked a few things. Made a mix of brewed coffee and heavy whipping cream to use instead of milk.

This cake rivals and may exceed the all american chocolate cake at Costco's which for was and the operative word is "was" the "WOW"  of chocolate cake for me but not any more.  It was decadent , moist, a chocolate lovers dream.  You gotta try this cake.  You will never go back to Costco for chocolate cake again.  I think I'm gonna try it with a white icing.  YUM!!!!

My daughter used this recipe to make cupcakes and they were the best cupcakes I've ever had! The only change she made was to the frosting, she cut the cocoa powder to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 and the powdered sugar to 5 cups instead of 5 1/3. So yum!!!

I've made this cake repeatedly, and loved it every time. Previously, I've made it with vanilla frosting and I once tried to turn it into a cake roll, which didn't work. But the most popular variation has been this cake with vanilla frosting on the outside and espresso frosting between layers. I don't change anything in the recipe, just keep a close eye on it in the oven.

Easy, rich, moist, chocolatey. Even my roommate who said he never wanted cake at his birthday parties and had once earned the nickname "cupcake hater" liked it. I used coffee in place of hot water and served the day after it was baked, per others suggestions.

I made this cake yesterday for my sister's birthday, and it was a major hit.  I took the advice of others, & used brewed coffee instead of boiling water, & used cocoa powder instead of flour on the greased pan with parchment paper.  Let cakes cool for 10 min. As directed, & they skid out of pans!
The cake is moist, & frosting rich; this from someone who doesn't even care for buttercream frosting.  It is not sweet,unless of course you keep adding convex sugar,which in my taste would take away from the decadence of the flavor.

This recipe is phenomenal. I made it exactly as written except I used boiling coffee instead of boiling water and I used three 9 inch pans cooked for 26 minutes instead of using two pans and then splitting the layers. The amount of icing was just barely enough to frost everything. I think the reason why some people have issues is All Recipes didn't share the recipe in the order the writer intended because there is some shuffling between the "first set of ingredients" and the "second set of ingredients." If this recipe didn't work for you,

Taste wise this cake and the accompanying frosting was very good.  It was just too light and crumbled.  I had a hard time getting the cake out of the pan.  Looks wise, its a crumbly mess.  This cake is best being made in a pan that stays in the pan and you just scoop it out.  I added chocolate chips to my batter.

I love that this isn't an overly sweet cake! Everyone raved about it and this is going to be my new go to chocolate cake.

Recipe exactly as printed. SUPERB ! Mine took a little longer  to firm up in the oven and I was afraid it would be dry, NO WAY ! I let it cool and flipped it out, no prob. I split it an hour later. Made the icing and spread it, rinsed my icing spreading knife in warm water and smoothed it over. Everyone thought it was from a bakery! This cake cooks evenly and flat. No hump in the center. Greased and floured pan, no sticking. This has replaced my in choco cake recipe forever, its rich in cocoa flavor but not icky sweet .

This cake was SO good! I seen others suggested using coffee in place of the hot water, and so I actually used German chocolate cake flavoured coffee to add to the chocolate flavour that much more. I put it in a 9x13 glass pan and baked it for around 45-50 mins until done. Turned out very moist and chocolatey!

Only problem I had was my pans were not deep enough and my oven was slightly crooked so it overflowed a bit on one edge, just meant I could cut it off and eat it early though.  Other than that it baked up perfectly and frosted easily.

Excellent! I buttered the 9 in rounds really well and let it cool completely. I didn't have any problem pulling them out of the pan (I was very careful). I only filled the pans 2/3 of the way full per another review and the cakes ended up being the perfect height. I made it the day before so I had plenty of time to cool and frost. I'm making it again for a potluck and I'm sure it will be a huge hit. Thank you!

I have made this cake for over 6 years and everyone loves it.  My husband never liked chocolate cake, but seems to love this one.  He is not a big sweet eater but I have seen him go for seconds.  I make  this cake in a bundt pan or a 9X13 pan.  Easy for him to take to work for his workers.   I have been told by the workers if I am to make a chocolate cake to always make this one.  I like to experiment on them.

Made it following the instructions as listed. No coffee, no extra time for cooling. I think the trick is to grease liberally and dust with cocoa powder and use the parchment paper like it shows in the video. It was AMAZING!!!! The only experiment I might do next time is to add chocolate chips to the batter.

This cake was the most phenomenal thing EVER.  I did make a couple of changes.  As another reviewer suggested, I used freshly brewed coffee in place of just boiling water.  Technically, I used fresh espresso made with a Bialetti espresso maker, but in our household, that's just coffee.  :)  I also had a large bundt pan, and this batter filled that pan halfway up, so I didn't break it into two pans.  I did have to increase the cooking time by about 20-25 minutes because of that, but WOW did it turn out incredibly moist and dense!  Everyone in the house loved it and have all requested that I make it again.   This is a chocolate cake for the extreme chocolate lover.  It just doesn't get any better than this!

I am a chocolate cake nut and I've made this multiple times AS IS: Fabulous! Made it also with chocolate cream cheese frosting: Fabulous again! I find it much easier to make this in a 9x13 cake pan and it freezes  so very well. One more tip: add a tablespoon of ground coffee or espresso powder to the boiling water because coffee really brings out the flavor of the chocolate. I'm craving this right now!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! Would be incredible on its own without frosting as well. I was skeptical about beating all ingredients for 3 minutes, but this cake is not tough at all. Very moist and very springy. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for an easy chocolate cake to throw together to cure my chocolate craving and this cake was perfect. It is very moist and not too rich. The only change I made was 1 cup of fresh coffee instead of the boiling water and I omitted the icing(used a bundt pan with a glaze) This will definitely be my go to chocolate cake from now on.

I too used coffee instead of water and hand-stirred it very carefully. I used two 9-inch round cake pans. The batter only filled each up half way so it was easy to place in the oven. They took about 30-33 mins. to cook. They rose up nicely but not too large so the end product is just the right sized double layer cake. I placed the pans on a cooling rack for about an hour, so they easily popped out. Then I placed the cakes directly on the rack for another half hour to an hour. This really makes sure the cakes are cooled enough for spreading the frosting. The cake is moist and has a nice texture but I think it lacks flavor. I made Creamy Chocolate Frosting by Tracy Larsen instead of the one with the recipe since that is  my favorite so it ended up being yummy. Next time, I will probably use more cocoa powder and/or add chocolate baking bars for added flavor.

I made this cake in only one 8 1/2 inch (22cm) spring form, high 3inch edges, this cake rises like crazy, and buttered it and floured it, cooked it at 175C for about and hour and 15 minutes or so. As soon as pick inserted comes out clean, take it out. Turned out nice and airy and moist. I scraped the edges almost right after taking it out of the oven with a sharp knife and took the spring sides off, then flipped it on a plate about 15 minutes later and carefully cut in half and let it cool some more. 
Also I only made about half of the frosting amount and it was perfect.
Will make this again and again.

I've made this cake maybe 10 times in the last two months. My flatmates can't get enough of it, I take it with me when I go to a friends place, this cake is awesome!  Very easy to make. And I'm not even a big chocolate lover. 
Also the frosting amount is a little confusing, half the amount is just a tad not enough, but full amount from this recipe is way too much. So to make two thirds would be perfect.

Cake was incredibly moist and delicious.  I did use coffee instead of boiling water and also special dark cacao instead of regular.  It was a huge hit!

I have looked for many recipes over the years finding the odd good one while all claiming to be good or even amazing... But this one IS! I was looking for a good recipe for a Wedding cake and this was exactly what I was after! 
Rich, moist, decadent, just divine.
 I made with my own icing opposed to this one but followed the cake recipe exactly.
 It is a runny/soupy type mixture but my gosh it produces the goods. So easy to make!!

Couldn't have been happier! Thank you to who ever shared this! :)

I'm making this recipe for the NC state fair and it is delicious!!!! Definitely making this again. Try using a little more milk in the frosting so it's not as hard to spread and if you don't want to cut the cake I have used 3, 8' pans instead.

Made this for my son's birthday cake. Followed the recipe as written and it was fabulous! I don't usually like icing either, but this one was very good! The cake was so moist that I was a little worried that it wouldn't hold up as a tiered cake, decorated in fondant, and sitting outside for a fall birthday; but I froze the layers before splitting, crumb coating, and decorating, then used some cake boards with supports between the layers and it worked beautifully. (Even after baking two days prior and decorating/assembling the day before the party.) The guests all said that it was awesome! I  had one guest tell me that, "If a cake looks good, it usually doesn't taste good", but that she was, "amazed this one tasted as good as it looked"! Will be making this again, for sure!... One last thought...I would let it sit for closer to an hour before removing from the pan, as others have said! I had one stick pretty badly, because I was in a hurry to get to bed and rushed it. I was able to piece it back together, though. Between the moisture of the cake itself and the freezing before decorating, it was still as if it had turned out of the pan perfectly on its own!

Be warned: it is actually impossible to eat more than a small piece of this cake in one sitting! Having said that, this was a huge hit! I made this exactly as directed, but substituted hot water for hot coffee, and it came out stupendous! I love, love, love this cake!

This cake was amazing. I made it as written except - as per the suggestion of another reviewer - I subbed 1 cup hot (very strong) coffee for the hot water. My first time making a 4-layer cake and it turned out great. I split the layers with dental floss (unflavored) guided by toothpicks. I used "special dark" cocoa since that's what I had on hand. I'm not very good at getting cakes out of the cake pan, so I lined the bottom of my pans with parchment paper. Next time I want to make a homemade chocolate cake -- this is my recipe!!!!

I would add a little less liquid to the cake.  It was delicious, but I had to bake it longer than recommended and the bottom of one cake was a little overdone.  Not burnt, but chewy.

Made this cake for a coworkers birthday and it was gone in about 2 mins. Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. With that being said I did change a few things but tried to keep it as close the the original recipe without having to go to the store. First I used margarine instead of butter, second I ran out of regular coco powder so I had some dark coco on hard and finished up with that, I also used skim milk again because that's what I had lastly I did not cut the cake horizontally for the simple fact that I had a really hard time getting it out of the pan and broke the cake! I let it cool for 10 min inside the pan but next time maybe I'll let it cool a little more. Easy cake to make I definitely recommend it!

This is the first chocolate cake that I've made that has been so moist and delicious!! It was quick and easy to make and although the batter looks very liquified when you are finished, the end result is still tasty.

I used the recipe as is.

I made this recipe once and didn't quite like how the cake turned out; I felt like there was too much oil and not enough cocoa. I changed the proportions a bit and the cake turned out great. Here's what I used:
1 ¾ white sugar
1 ¾ cup flour
¾ cup and 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ½ tsp baking soda
1 ½ tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
2 eggs
¾ cup and 2 tbsp milk
7 tbsp vegetable oil
1 ½ tsp vanilla extract
¾ cup and 1 tbsp boiling water

I hope this helps anyone who needs help with the recipe!

I'm an amateur baker, but this came out perfectly. I spread a homemade raspberry filling between the layers and covered the outside with the buttercream frosting, and my critical mother said that it was the best chocolate cake she's ever had.

I WILL say that I cut down on the sugar substantially, but that just made the frosting richer. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Awesome cake. Slightly on the fence about how well it would turn out due to the batter being so soupy. But man.... It turned out surprisingly perfect! By far the best chocolate cake recipe I have found on allrecipe so far.

This is the best ever! I use a tad less cocoa, which is just a personal preference and I use hot coffee in place of the water. I also use a tad bit of coffee in my icing. Its perfect. Everyone loves it

LOVE this cake!!!!! Super moist and chocolatey. I was concerned about how liquid the batter consistency was but baked it anyway. It turned out fabulous. I wouldn't bother with greasing the pan but would use parchment paper instead. I had to make another set of cakes using this recipe because the cakes wouldn't come out of the pan even though they had been well greased.

This cake turned out super moist and delicious! My only complaint is that it doesn't quite make 4 layers on it's own. If you want a substantial 4 layer cake, I would double the recipe and cook in 4 separate pans. My layers turned out quite thin and the thought of slicing each one in half seemed impossible.

This cake was amazing.  I followed the directions exactly and did add the peeled chocolate on top of the cake (I didn't see that in the directions).  I added milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate shavings.  Used a peeler to make the chocolate shavings and it turned out looking just like the picture.  We served it with vanilla ice cream for those that wanted it.  Will make this cake again!

This cake is not a 5 it's a 10. This is the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life! It tasted so professional, it looked delicious, and it was easy to make. WARNING: This recipe makes a TON of frosting. Split the recipe in half. I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. If you're thinking of making this cake and you're reading this review, make this cake right away. You won't regret it!

I like to make my kids’ birthday cakes every year and had decided to try out different recipes with each cake so I’d have a store of recipes to choose from.  This was the first recipe I tried...and my kids have not let me make anything but this cake for their birthdays ever since.  I have never been a fan of chocolate cake (usually comes out too dry), but THIS chocolate cake is AWESOME!

Used Dutch cocoa. Absolutely delicious, moist, chocolatey, and totally amazing! Careful not to underbake- i used to bake my old recipe a few minutes less to keep it more gooey. This recipe does not need that. It's plenty gooey and will be raw if underbaked.

I was hesitant because I'm more used to using butter than oil but this cake is delicious...it is super moist! perfect for chocolate lovers! I made 2 layers instead of 4, that was the only change.

This is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made. I used water instead of the milk (lots of food allergies in the family) and it turned out great. I also used a full cup of cacao instead of 3/4. The cake was a rich, dark chocolate. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Not as moist as I'd hoped, still a good cake though, quite crumbly.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He loves ice cream cakes so I put ice cream between the two layers. He loved it! Next time I make it I will try it with the coffee instead of water like someone suggested.

Made this cake today for husbands birthday. I have tried many homemade cakes before and this is by far the best. We did not want to stop eating it. Adding the water makes it this super fudgey like texture once baked and it is absolutely wonderful!! This will now be our go to chocolate cake recipe! Thank you!!!

Made this as a three layer cake for my daughter's wedding and my family begged me to make it again because they loved it so much!  Such a moist, moist, chocolatey cake that freezes well.  I did change the icing to a simple one of 1 part butter to 2 part icing sugar with a  1/4 tsp. salt per 1 cup butter.

Easily THE BEST chocolate cake I've ever had.  So moist, rich and decadent.  The only thing I changed was dropped the sugar from 2 cups down to 1 1/2 cups.  I made it in a bundt pan and baked for 37 minutes or so.  I aso think you can get away with making half the icing, especially if not icing between any layers.  So amazing.  Does anyone know if you can transform this recipe into an amazing white cake by omitting the cocoa?

Definitely the best cake that I have EVER had. I made it for my parents and myself, and they completely agreed that it was the best cake they've ever had. It is SO moist and chocolatey. I wasn't expecting to like this recipe this much. I like it so much more than any box recipe I've used. I used a bundt pan to cook it in. The only problem was getting it out of the pan, which was 100% my fault. Make sure to spray your pans very well to make sure that the cake doesn't break and crumble, like mine. I didn't make the frosting.

Delicious. But make sure to add the water as I forgot to do this and the cake didn't rise as much in the center and would break easily. This problem was fixed with the amazing frosting! it looked a little sloppy but tasted amazing.

I really liked this recipe. I usually use a chocolate cake mix, however I forgot to buy one at the store, so this was plan B.  I made cupcakes and put mini chocolate chips in them.  They were moist, very flavorful and delicious.  The boiling water step really concerned me.  The batter seemed ultra thin, however they rose beautifully.  I did not make the frosting. Yummy!

I used this recipe to make the yellow, empty, and coin blocks from Super Mario. It turned out amazingly rich and moist! They were a huge hit! I covered it with a different frosting because I wanted to do a combination of flavors, however I will try my hand at the frosting for my older sister's upcoming birthday. Easy to make and it tastes great!

Absolutely FANTASTIC. I changed a bit as well, added coffee & melted semi-sweet chocolate chips in it. Used parchment paper to line pans, so edges did not crisp up.  Very dense and delicious!

This is my husband's FAVORITE cake!  The recipe is perfect... no need to change a thing.  Just make sure you use FRESH baking powder and baking soda and don't overbeat the batter so it rises well.  Your family will LOVE it!

Only changes made were to follow the video suggestions of hot coffee instead of boiling water, and to dust the pans with cocoa powder instead of regular flour. This cake is the best chocolate cake I've had in years!

Absolutely amazing! I followed the directions to the T. It came out beautiful.  By far the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I used two 9"round pans and it worked grear. I didn't use the frosting on this recipe but the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting fro Allrecipes.com.  Everyone loved it!

Delicious! I made this with gluten free flour and it came out really well. Instead of using the chocolate buttercream frosting, I used a reviewer's recipe for a chocolate glaze. This was perfect for my father's birthday cake.

I now have a go to chocolate cake recipe that will WOW everyone. I took all the reviewers suggestions: coffee instead of water, cooled cake longer in the pans, and didn't spit the cake into layers.  For the frosting, I just added the whole cube of butter.  Loved it, loved it.

This cake always gets rave reviews from my family, they all love it. It's super easy to make - one bowl, simple steps. If I could rate it a 4 1/2 I would, the only problem is it's very difficult to get out of the pan and very difficult to frost, as it has a tendency to fall apart. My best advice is to let it cool thoroughly, more 30-40 minutes than 10 minutes. Other than that I'd call it a perfect cake. Moist and spongy and bursting with flavour, it's a wonderful recipe great for anyone who loves chocolate cake.

You don't need to buy a boxed mix again.  I'm so glad I read the reviews before making or I would have thought I did something wrong when I added the water.  It's a very thin batter.  I added instant espresso to the boiling water to bring out the chocolate flavor.  I made cupcakes and cooked for about 15-18 minutes.  They were very moist and light and airy.  I love a good frosting and the chocolate butter cream is amazing.

Absolutely delicious! It was an amazing cake and a big hit with my friends! It was very moist and melting, a true success. I just hit a little snag in the recipe, the cakes did not "climb" the pan and so I couldn't split them; I didn't have baking soda at hand so I doubled the amount of baking powder, it might be the reason why. i definitely make it again as it was quite easy to bake and was truly delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

BEST recipe EVER!! LOVED THE CAKE!! It was light, moist and delicious! Make sure you use the parchment paper, I only used in on one  pan and the one I didn't was very messy to get the cake out of.  I made a ganache for the frosting though as I don't like the regular butter cream style. PERFECT

Amazing!! I halved the recipe and used brewed coffee in place of boiled water, then I made cupcakes instead:) Baked for 20 minutes and they were heavenly! Even after two days, the cupcakes were moist and perfect!!

Amazing! I made it with my mom for my birthday. We added a bit more chocolate than called for and bought the most amazing chocolate frosting at the store. After last year's less-than-stellar cheesecake that I got sick of after a few days, this was perfect!

I did read some reviews first and so I substituted a cup of black coffee for the water. I also reduced the cocoa in the frosting to one cup and the sugar to under 3 cups. Left the cake in the pan to cool for 1hr. I used 9" springform pans and the the cake did not stick (but that might be the tin glide), one of the cakes fractured slightly but I was able to put it together (it is a very delicate cake). The cake was moist and delicious, I could have eaten the frosting from the bowl and that doesn't happen often. It was a smash hit welcome home cake for dad!

This cake was awesomely delicious.  I made this cake for family over the holidays and it did NOT disappoint.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the addition of the hot coffee in place of the hot water.  Family gave it rave reviews...even the members who are not big chocolate cake fans took slices home to enjoy again later.  I had one family member who actually licked the plate clean after the last morsel had been consumed.  Cake, frosting and all was fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again....only for special occasions because it is sinfully rich and calorie laden!!!  YUMMY.  Thanks~D

This was excellent! The description is perfect:  a rich, moist cake. I did not try the frosting because I'd already fallen in love with Chocolate Frosting II (made with 2.5 c sugar). I made 24 cupcakes with this recipe and baked them for about 21 minutes. I am strongly opposed to chemical-laden boxed cake mixes, so thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

Wow ... just wow.  I’m done with any other chocolate cake recipes — this is now my chocolate cake. I’m a reasonably accomplished baker but I’ve often had trouble recreating the moist yet structured composition of a boxed cake mix.  Often the flavor has been good but the cake ends up being crumbly though it’s not dry.  This recipe solves that problem — it’s so moist, so perfectly composed — not too sweet but so delicious and chocolatey.   Even before I read the other reviews, I planned to swap out the water with coffee.  My grandmother always did this with chocolate cake and every single thing she baked was award winning.  Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe - you’ve given me something to look forward to baking and my family loves this cake.

I loved this chocolate cake! It's by far my favorite homemade recipe. It is dense and not too sweet. I was a bit taken back by the boiling water step because it made the batter look soupy but it came out just fine! I didn't change any of this recipe and wouldn't change anything besides maybe adding less cocoa power to the frosting. 

It reminds me of a cake-like brownie. If you don't like this consistency do not make this cake.

Oh. My. Goodness. This cake was wonderful! I made this more my wife, a serious chocolate lover, and she has med her match.  This was the first time I have seen her eat only half a cake and stop because it was too sweet!  But we all loved how moist it is and the frosting especially.

I just made this cake and took the suggestion of adding 1 cup of fresh hot coffee instead of water and OH MAH GOD!!  This chocolate cake was amazing with so much flavor and moist!  Even the non chocolate lovers loved it!  Instead of using the buttercream in this recipe, I made All Recipe Jo-Lynn's recipe for Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting!! It was like heaven in my mouth!  If you haven't tried it, try it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe! I don't need to look no further for another chocolate cake recipe! :)

I made 2 of these cakes to take to my mom and dads anniversary and it is an amazing cake!  Feed 25 people with no problem and is so rich, dense and moist!  Only change I made was instead of adding a cup of boiling water, I added 1 cup of strong coffee like the video suggested. Beautiful cake!

I had to use prepackaged frosting as I ran out of confectioners sugar but the cake was a hit for an 12-year old's birthday! I used only 2-layers and frosted the center with white frosting. Yum.

I made this for a family dinner two nights ago. It got rave reviews (from very picky eaters) and everyone is still talking about it. I didn't change a thing, other than to just throw all the icing ingredients together- I didn't alternate as directed. It was seriously amazing and I can't wait to make - and eat - it again!!!!

Very impressive as a birthday cake for a chocoholic! It was very moist and fluffy -- not dense like so many other chocolate cakes that I've tried. I took another reviewer's suggestion and substituted espresso for some of the boiling water. It did stick to the pan even with greasing and flouring, so I will have to try the parchment paper next time. I also ran out of confectioner's sugar (oops) so used a stovetop chocolate frosting recipe instead of buttercream, which was delicious. This will definitely be my new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

This was the very first time I've made a homemade chocolate cake and it was heavenly. I did have a problem with cutting the slices in half but I think it was the knife I used. It came out delicious anyways and I think I'm done with boxed chocolate cake. Thank you for such an easy and again, heavenly cake recipe!

AMAZING!!!! My dad is absolutely obsessed with chocolate. I made this for him and he loved it. It was very runny when I put it into the pans. But I had read the reviews so I went ahead with it and I'm so glad. Very moist and delicious. The only change I made was to use a cup of coffee instead of boiling water. This is a definite keeper. My sister, who doesn't like chocolate, kept asking for more!

This cake was so moist and it tasted great! I had to use maybe a tablespoon of butter because I ran out of oil and needed a little bit more to make it to a half cup. I also ran out of vanilla at a teaspoon but it was fine. I also used a half cup of coffee and a half cup of water. I'm sure the cake would've been just as great made exactly as the recipe states (I hate the reviews that say I changed this and that and did this and it sucked haha.) I topped it with flour frosting and used a little cherry extract(because of the whole running out of vanilla problem) and it was great.

Yummy!
Super moist and yummy!  Kids loved it, hubby loved it, and of course me, the chocoholic loved it.  I agree with another reader that said to wait more than 10 minutes. Of course, I forgot to put the parchment paper but it still came out nicely after about 15 minutes.  I cut the sugar in the cake a little bit (about 1 1/2 cups) and it was still just as yummy.  Yup, yummy summarizes my review

My kids love this cake and the frosting too ! I have tried it twice and did not have any of the failures that some of the reviewers did. I am not an experienced baker so I try to follow the instructions exactly. 30 minutes in my oven using Wilton pans, which are not expensive, is perfect. The cake is very moist so you DO need to let it cool at least 10 or 20 minutes before taking them out of the pans. I went around the edges with a sharp knife before trying to remove them to cool more. I elevate my cooling rack to let it cool better also. 

Have a cup of hot water to dip your frosting knife in. The frosting is fairly thick. Do not panick after adding and mixing the boiling water. It looks very soupy but ends up great. It is not a light fluffy cake. It is dense and moist. Very flavorful. I also have not had problems with it spilling over the cake pans. I don't know what is causing that problem for people. You will have leftover frosting if you aren't cutting them to make a 4 layer cake.

Hugely popular and easy to make.  I have requests for it from people who are far better cooks than I.  Used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe (doubled) and made the cake in a bundt pan as thats all I have. All good

Delicious!  I needed a chocolate cake recipe for a bake sale at school.  Followed this one to a T, but made it into cake pops, cupcakes and mini cupcakes.  Wow!  I wouldn't change a thing.  This is now my go to recipe for chocolate cake!

I hadn't baked a cake (not even a box cake) for over a decade, and this was such a great experience!  I read through the reviews and basically followed the recipe as given.  I had issues with my cakes sticking but that was MY fault!

I baked this cake exactly by the recipe with the exception of using buttermilk in lieu of regular milk. It was not as moist as I expected and didn't have much flavor. I will be searching for a different recipe. My co-workers liked it so that's why it got 3 stars.

This is a great cake! 10xs better than a cake box! What was so surprising was that it is so moist! Like the others said don't worry if it is runny when you bake it just be sure it is completely done when you take it out and let is sit for more like 30 mins to an hour to be sure it is completely cooled! Love this recipe!

I usually find most dessert recipes too sweet. I used 1 2/3 cups sugar instead of 2 and glad I did. Like most, I used coffee instead of hot water. I found it a little too chocolatey. Next time I will decrease amount of cocoa used. Very good flavour though and very moist. With these adjustments, this will be my new go to chocolate cake.

This is seriously the best cake recipe ever. I couldn't believe how easy it was and I was actually pretty concerned by the batter but OH EM GEE. It was moist and amazing. If you sift the flour and the cocoa powder, it makes it extra fluffy. Make sure your pan isn't too deep or it'll take a long time to bake and it won't be as good. Spreading it into two pans works nicely. It also makes really great cupcakes too.

I followed the directions to a T but for some reason the cake is still incredibly runny. It has now been in the oven for an hour and a half and the center is completely raw. I am terribly disappointed and worried that this cake is not going to turn out good. I'm thinking that if it ever cooks its going to have the consistency of a brownie rather than the traditional fluffiness of a cake :(

Absolutely amazing!  My wife is a hard critic of my baking and cooking which is great because it allows me to tweak and improve so everything is great but this cake was awesome from the start!  The only difference I make is a tiny bit more milk in the frosting and mix it for about 10 seconds on a higher speed to lighten it up and make it easier to spread.  Other than that I reccomend this cake to anyone who loves chocolate!

This is the best recipe I have converted to gluten free. I used Jules gluten free flour, and decreased the boiling water to 3/4 cup. It was wonderful, my family loved it. Couldn't even tell it was gluten free.

No more boxed cakes!  This cake is really easy to make, I followed a lot of the reviewer's tips and the cake was moist and full of chocolate.  It is a moist cake but not over sweet.  This cake definitely taste better than any box cake and us a keeper.  The icing is extremely good.  I will make this cake again and again.

I loved this recipe it was moist rich had a great flavor. The one thing I was disappointed in was the fact that the first time I made this I baked  it for the 35 minuets  the recipie said to but it was not at all done in fact it was still liquid and the cake fell it was extremely disappointing but the cake still tasted fabulous.

Very moist and rich!  I followed the recipe as is and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 37 minutes. Absolutely perfect!  I will never do a boxed chocolate cake again!  Fantastic!

This recipe was great!!! I followed the directions exactly as written with the exception of the boiling water. I also used hot coffee. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for submitting!

The first time I made this cake, I followed the instructions to a tee.  I baked for the full 35 minutes because they were still slightly soupy @ 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, following the instructions led to me trying to remove the cakes from their pans 10 minutes after I pulled them from the oven, and they fell apart in a hurry - not a pretty scene.
My second run was more successful.  The only changes I made were changing out the hot water for hot coffee and making certain my pans were greased very thoroughly this time.  I waited half an hour to remove them this time... success!
This cake did not totally blow me away, but it was quite good.  The icing is to die for, and while the cake itself is fairly tasty, I found it a tad dry - I was hoping for something a little more moist, especially from such runny batter.  When I checked at 30 minutes, they weren't ready to come out, but the last 5 minutes seemed to take all the moisture out.  I guess I just need to find my stride on this one.
All in all, it's a good cake, but not something that I, personally, would write home about.  It's a nice staple, but I will be keeping my eye out for new recipes to try out.

This was a winner.  It came turn out so moist and delicious and since we are all diabetic, I only used half the sugar for the frosting.  It was amazing.  I believe this will be my new pitch-in party dessert.

I do this all the time and it is gone by the evening! So airy, not too sweet,easy to make. I did it as it says however, I added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to the boiling water. And the secret- quality chocolate. Yummy!

This goes in my recipe notebook for sure! I got real scared at first because I mixed it up as it says but replaced the boiling water with hot coffee. BIG Difference for the better. It was really soupy so i thought for sure I messed it up, but I put it in the oven any ways. SUCCESS. I feel really accomplished making such a fantastic cake!

If you are like me, and you read the bad reviews before you make the recipe, don't be afraid!  My cake turned out perfect with none of the problems talked about.  My cakes did not spill over during baking and cooked perfectly in 30 min.  I assume those who had problems used an 8" pan instead of a 9" pan.  I used parchment on the bottom of my pans along with butter and flour to solve the cake sticking in the pan problem.  The cakes came out perfectly after 10min of cooling time.  There was also no crumbling problem when I cut the cakes in half for layering, and they easily transferred around from cooling rack to icing plate. The icing was a perfect spreading texture, and there was no issue with crumbs.  I did always place the cut side down for all layers while I iced the cake.  The cake was a moist, rich chocolate lovers dream!

It's a delicious and easy cake .
I replaced the unsweetened coco with sweet one and reduce the sugar to third cup .
Also I used coffee instead of hot water .

Every time I make this cake and frosting, it gets rave reviews.  This cake is so moist.  Do not leave out the boiling water. (Swap out for fresh brewed coffee for a richer flavor) .  The recipe makes a generous amount of frosting, so there's plenty if you want to split your cakes.  Good thing too, because it will be hard to resist eating this by the spoonfuls or reserving some for later.  (Try swirling with peanut butter )

Wow! That's my initial reaction. For years, I have searched for a chocolate cake recipe that tastes like chocolate - not just flavoring. This is is! Even my husband said the icing is like eating a candy bar. I read all of the reviews and ultimately ended up making the recipe exactly as RACH56 posted it - it was a knock-out. The only thing I did differently was to add a parchment paper liner to the bottom of the cake pans and it came out perfect. I don't know what other people are doing, but this cake deserves 10 stars - it is truly outstanding. Oh, I did use the coffee in lieu of water, but nothing else. Thanks again! This is my new "favorite" cake and "favorite dessert".

Had no bicarb: used 3 sachets baking powder instead, worked well. Put rode glazuur on top, was lovely; would make a great cake with a (fresh) raspberry sort sauce over top

Exactly what I was looking for! I ended up using a bundt pan to make the cake and then cutting it in half and frosting it like that, then covering all over with the frosting as well. It worked very nicely still and was just as moist as I wanted. Be warned, this makes SO much chocolate buttercream, but it's amazing!

In the past I've had some pretty interesting baking accidents, I forgot the flower when making cookies, spilled pies in the oven, had cakes stick to pans etc. but this has been the first cake I've every baked successfully and my family loved it!  I made it for my sister's birthday, and my dad said it was the best cake he's ever had.  He can't have anything with sugar in it, so I made the recipe with baking Truvia and it turned out flawlessly!  Instead of the chocolate icing I used a raspberry icing which turned out really nice.  This is such a great recipe!

A must try. By far, our favorite chocolate cake ! Made one for work, while it was baking it smelled so good I made a second for home. A winner all over ! And it was one of the easiest cakes to mix I've made. It baked so flat I didn't have to even off the tops of any of the layers. Made the frosting with it and was great also. A complete duo. Followed other review and let the layers cool longer. It is worth the wait.

This is an amazing chocolate cake... very soft and moist.  Make sure that the cake is completely cooled (at least 20 mins) before removing from the pan(s).  I make a double layered 9 inch cake.. there is some left over frosting.

Highly recommend this cake... its easy and a winner!

This was a good recipe .Another good recipe is too much chocolate cake. I turned it into cupcakes. The baking time for cupcakes is 20-25  min. The too much chocolate cupcakes were 200000000000 times better than this recipe, but this recipe was still good.

Overly sweet icing. The cake was good. I made it as directed with the one exception of adding coffee instead of water. The cake part of this dessert was good but I have made better recipes that I have ran accross. The icing had a good texture and was easily spreadable. I did have to add extra milk because it was very dense. My beef with the icing was it was TOO much. I started to follow my instinct and use only half the coco but I then second guessed myself on the wet to dry ratio and used it as instructed. The icing was EXTREMELY rich and that is said with a huge sweet tooth of my own. Cut back on the coco powder and it may be more to my liking. It is worthy of tweaking in the future to come up with a better less "extreme" icing. It was so rich it was almost uneatable.  I will stick with another cake recipe that my family enjoyed more. The icing has potential but not "as is". It wasn't a complete birthday cake flop, but there will be left overs.

This one I made for Mother's Day. It turned out OK... But make sure you put the right amount of eggs and baking soda and baking powder! I know I;m someone who just likes to guesstimate and put like a dash or something. THAT DID NOT WORK WELL it didn't rise high enough for me to cut it into layers. The frosting was too sweet I only added 4 cups of powdered sugar and it was still pretty sweet. Its best to use another recipe for the frosting. But If you follow the directions and make good changes to the frosting it will probably turn out way better than mine.

Move over Ina and Nigella this is the chocolate cake to make. This cake is crazy good. So moist so fantastic. I followed others recommendation and used strong hot coffee instead of boiling water. Otherwise made as directed, except for the frosting which I change a little and added melted 70% cocoa dark chocolate squares. I sliced up the leftovers and froze them individually and now I can pull out a piece of cake when I need it. This recipe rocks you've got to try it. I will never try a different recipe for chocolate cake because I found the winner.  Also I did not split the cakes, I reduced the sugar in the frosting by about two cups. I frosted between the cakes and top and sides. Plenty of frosting to cake ratio for me. Defiantly serve with large glass of cold milk.

Awesome recipe! I tried it twice with small alternations. First, I reduced sugar to 1.5 cups instead of 2 cups and did not add boiling water. I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to dry ingredients mix, it gives the cake nice kick. If you don't add water, the cake turns out to be a little less airy and more chewy. 
Second time I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced sugar to 1.5 cups and substituted water with fresh brewed coffee. It turned out to be very fluffy, soft and delicious! 
Since my family doesn't like frosting, I'll be omitting the water next time I bake it, that way the cake tastes more like light brownie. But if you are making proper cake, I'd suggest to add a cup of fresh brewed coffee.

Fabulous cake!  Like other reviewers I used freshly brewed coffee in place of the hot water.  I also used about 25% less sugar and it was plenty sweet - especially with frosting.  I did not use the frosting included with this cake recipe though, but rather the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site.  It's got a great texture and wonderful, rich flavor.  Yum! **Update 7/9/15: I have continued to make this cake for all sorts of occasions, getting rave reviews each time.  I now use the chocolate buttercream frosting included with it and it's amazing - dark, rich, decadent, delicious :)

This is a superb chocolate cake.  I added 2 shots of hot espresso to the boiling water to make the cup measurement.  If you like coffee, this enhances a definitive chocolate cake.  A recipe to keep and pass on for sure.  Thanks for sharing this.

I tried making this cake and it came out very well. I did make certain changes like I baked it for 40 mins at 170 degrees centigrade and let it cool for 1 hour. While frosting I made 4 layers as mentioned in the recipe and I made a rectangular cake. While serving I made thin slices and served it with vanilla ice cream. As it is extreme chocolate cake, I called it "Death by Chocolate".  Because of the thin slices, I also served it as Ice cream sandwich, with a thick layer of vanilla ice cream between two slices of cake and some chocolate sauce on the top. Everyone loved it.

This cake was AMAZING! I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate so I used Hershey's special dark cocoa for both the cake and icing. I also substituted 1/2 cup butter for vegetable oil. It was perfect, and there were no issues with sticking to the pan. I recommend making it the day before you plan to eat it and refridgerating overnight. It's much better the second day.

Half the cake stuck to the pan after waiting 20 min to remove it.  It is also very delicate/crumbly which makes it difficult to ice it back together.  It seems as though the cake will fall apart any minute.  Good flavour however, I'll be trying a different cake recipe next time.

This recipe is good. Boxed cake mix and icing from a tub is also good... and easier... I would generally still go that route. However, if you're a stickler for from-scratch technique or maybe you have an hour to make a cake with things in your pantry (like I did!) then this recipe is fantastic! I actually halved the recipe and cooked up 1 x 8-inch pan's worth, which worked great, and fed 6 kids just fine. Needed 5-10 more minutes in the oven than a 9-inch pan since it was a bit thicker.

I have REALLY high standards for chocolate cakes.  I compare every chocolate cake to one I had at a resort in Arizona.  Though this one was very good, I still liked the one at the resort better.  But 4 stars is still a good score.

This is great for cupcakes, but I only need half the icing when doing cupcakes (and pipe it on). I also used a little more milk in the icing to make it less firm. I took these to work and people loved them. So moist!

This may be the best cake I have EVER made!  And, I've made a lot of cakes!!!  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  Definitely tasted like a professional cake. Made it for my son's birthday and the whole family loved it.  The icing was a perfect consistency as well. Just a note, we are trying to eat healthier & GMO free, so this cake was mostly organic with whole wheat flour. I've found baked goods often turn out differently with whole wheat flour, so wasn't sure how this would turn out.  I added a little extra water, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup.  I also used coconut oil. The cake did not rise as much as I expected, but it was a perfectly moist & delicious cake.

The cake wasn't as sweet as I prefer chocolate cake to be. (I know, I'm crazy) but I loved the chocolate frosting. I was in a hurry and out of milk so I tried something crazy.... I melted vanilla ice cream in place of the milk! It worked!!!

AMAZING!!! Awesome cold or warm, frosting or not. It is not like any other from scratch cake I have made (it actually tastes good!) I didn't add about a 1/4 cup water because it started to get very soupy. It stiil turned out very moist and delicious.

This got rave reviews by my friends.  I used coffee instead of boiling water (like other reviews suggested.). I wish I had one cake without coffee to compare, but you can't taste the coffee at all; and this is coming from someone who doesn't like coffee and can smell it in nearly everything it's in. 2- 9x2" pans and I made a 3rd pan for 3rd layer= which uses 1 1/3-1 1/2 recipes.

I liked this cake but found that is was just too soft to be a good cake to work with, I adjusted the recipe so that I use 1 & 1/2 times the stated amount of flour and I have a fantastic Chocolate cake that everyone raves about and is great for torting and filling. Yummo.

Wow! Delicious!  I used the coffee as many others did, and waited 20 minutes to pop them out of the cake pans.  Glad I did! Super moist,  delicious, and one of the easiest cake mixes ever.  It was seriously as easy as making a boxed cake.  I have never been good at making cakes, but this one came out great!

This was the best recipe ever! Was super moist and rich. 1st time making this and was hesitant with the boiling water.  I did slowly blend it in, took me about 5 min. Also I only had a bundt cake pan so I used that. I will definitely use this recipe again. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

The cake is delicious but I don't like the texture. It's not a good cake for splitting into layers and is really difficult to frost. This is because the cake is just too weak. If you hold the cupcake to frost it, it will squish in your hand... It also found it a little flat (I saw another reviewer that was struggling with this issue). If you're just going for a simple single layer cake, this is great. However, I would not suggest it for layering, decorating or cupcakes.

Amazing!  Followed the recipe and added extra chocolate shavings on the top and it was delicious.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.

This was super easy to make.  I have to say that I was a little worried as my batter was basically liquid, but it came out PERFECT.  I made this with a peanut butter frosting for a family function and EVERYONE was raving about it!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for a great recipe

Super easy and delicious. I have no idea why this recipe has bad reviews. I am a self admitted "impatient" baker and a busy mom who has been looking for a homemade cake recipe that isn't dry.  This is it. After many cakes (my kids are 9 and 5), I will finally stop looking. Made this last weekend and brought it to Easter dinner with the family. Everyone loved it. I made the cake according to the directions in a kitchenaid mixer and then baked them in two 9-inch round pans. In my oven, on convection, it was ready at 35 minutes. I made only half the recipe for the frosting and had PLENTY leftover.  I made one change to the frosting-I substituted almond extract for the vanilla and this gave it an excellent taste! Thank you for this great recipe!

Haven't eaten it yet, but it looks great!  No issues with it coming out of the cake pan.  Heavily greased the pans and let them cool about 15 minutes on racks.  The icing seems pretty sweet but the consistency is perfect.  I am sure my kids will love it!

FIVE STAR!! I haven't made a box cake since!! I get RAVE reviews everywhere I serve it. The only thing I changed was taking another reviewers suggestion and added a cup of hot coffee! It really does make a difference. Other than that ... DON'T change a thing!!!

Made no alterations, truly a delicious moist chocolate cake with very chocolatey frosting that's just simply better than buying your ok packaged cake mix and factory made frosting

Tried this recipe with dark cocoa for the cake batter, milk chocolate frosting.  It turned out great!  Also a great first layered cake for our kids to try.

Made this cake and it was great. Great flavor. I read the reviews before baking and made sure the cake was fully cooled for 20 mins or longer to make sure that it was firm and cooled down enough for me 
to start splitting the cake in half. I also changed up the cake a bit by adding cream cheese to the frosting and I used 1/2 of cup of Special Dark chocolate instead of usual unsweetened cocoa powder. Made the frosting really dark and perfect. It was the perfect chocolate cake for my friend's birthday!

Fantastic chocolate cake!! I made the cake exactly the way the author wrote and it was super moist and very, very tasty (almost brownie consistency). I used a different frosting, so I can't comment on that. This is one cake that I'll be making again!

I admit, I have never made a from scratch cake batter. I made this as cupcakes for a birthday party with a soy allergy and celiac's for another person. I substituted the following: coconut oil instead of vegetable, and with gluten-free flour, and just plain old forgot to use boiled water, so it was just regular water. It turned out amazing!!! I added soy-free chocolate chunks too (which I think were the special touch that won everyone over). I didn't follow the icing recipe as I was also making gingerbread cupcakes and wanted it vanilla flavour, so just added cocoa when I was done with that. Divine. They were a massive hit. And as you guessed- everyone could enjoy them! (thankfully no egg allergies!!!) Will be using this recipe again :) 

If you're interested in doing them cupcake style: I was a bit worried they would stick to the cupcake liners, but they came out just fine with minimal cake loss! Now, I can't guarantee it for everyone as I used a gluten free flour, but I'd risk it!

this review is only for the cake part of the recipe. the cake turned out delicious! it was moist and fluffy, and not too sweet at all. Like some other reviewers said though, this recipe is actually from the back of the Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder box. i think the next time, i will try substituting the boiling water for coffee.

The batter for this cake was so delicious!!! Literally left a lot of it to lick!  Only concern is that it was spongey, probably because of my ingredients (expired, etc.). Other than that, I really enjoyed this cake and the easy recipe!!

Really yummy, rich chocolate cake. I always have extra frosting even with layering in between cake, so sometimes I cut back the amount.

The very first time I made this cake, it came out SOO very moist.  The only change I made was instead of using 1 cup of boiling water, I used 1 cup fresh brewed strong coffee.  It added a flavor to the chocolate that my dinner party enjoyed a lot.  By the end of the night, there was only a few slices left.  Thanks for this addition (and staple) to my dessert collection!

It lives up to its title, surely. The only thing I did differently was to bake it in three 8-inch round cake pans, instead of going through the trouble of splitting layers. I made the cake three days ago now, but we only tried it yesterday, and just a quarter of the cake remains today. I could see filling the layers with cherry or strawberry pie filling to fancy this cake up more, but it seriously satisfies a chocolate cake craving as it is written. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, RACH56!

If you don't split the cake layers you will have a lot of left over frosting.

I loved the recipe....I'm a chocoholic and learning to eat better. I replaced the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I replaced the regular sugar with Monk fruit...I replaced chocolate lacto free milk with "milk" and reduce the oil with applesauce...awwww angel wings are flapping as there is an awesome lower calorie, low fat chocoholic cake available :)

This is the end all chocolate cake recipe! Do the coffee instead of water, and do make it strong, otherwise follow as written...taste, texture, everything is professional pastry shop quality.  Constructive criticism: move one of the doses of milk up the ingredients list with the oil and eggs so as to be less confusing to noobs.  Never make a box mix again.

I made this cake a few years ago for my son's bday and forgot I had made it once before....so when I went to make it this time I made the same mistake as the first time - that is splitting the layers. I recommend NOT splitting them as the cake begins to fall apart and then frosting it is a nightmare. Otherwise follow the recipe as is - it tastes delicious and hopefully won't look like a disaster after frosting!

GREATEST chocolate cake ever. I think this is the only recipe I've used from this site that I didn't make several changes based on reviews, it's perfect the way it is and always turns out. The batter does look wrong (very liquidy) before baking but don't let it throw you off. it's very good by itself and heavenly if you add the Cheese Filling recipe on this site as a filling (makes awesome cupcakes!). A great base recipe for many many flavors of amazing cupcakes (my other favorite is raspberry filling + white chocolate butter cream frosting, so good).

Made this cake with the frosting in the recipe and it got rave reviews, from best chocolate cake ever to it'the most moist cake ever tasted. The recipe was followed as written with no alterations and it was perfect. No problems as others had with over flow or the cake sticking to the pan.  I used cake release,  a pan coating by Wilton and the cake came out nicely with very little crumbs. This wil be the recipe I use whenever a chocolate cake is requested.

OMG - phenomenal!! Best chocolate cake I've ever made or tasted! Wasn't crazy about the frosting recipe but the cake was to die for. I've also made it with butter instead of the veg oil and still came out perfect!

Gorgeously moist chocolate cake that isn't overly chocolatey. I had many compliments not the least of which was that it was the best cake they'd ever tried. Make sure you allow the cake to cool inside the tin properly before you take it out. I'll definitely be making this again!

I'm giving this cake only 3 stars because I heavily modified the recipe. The cake is extremely moist and savory but the original recipe is one-tone and that is way too sweet. After tinkering around, I replaced the water with orange juice which I brought a boil with a teaspoon of cinnamon, added about a tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter as well. For the frosting, less sugar, more cocoa powder will give it better balance as when I followed the recipe exactly, the frosting taste extremely sweet. I also added about 2 tablespoon of ground coffee beans for a little bit of bitterness. I added a jar of marmalade in between the layers (so a layer of cake, a layer of frosting, a layer of marmalade, a layer of cake and frosting). I also crushed some Oreo cookies and sprinkled them over the finished cake. This gave the cake more flavors, as you have sweet, crunchy, some acidity, and a more flavorful cake. Great recipe base but I found my variation to have a better flavor balance and the result is amazing.

AMAZING!! My mommy used to make a chocolate cake for our birthdays as kids that I still compare every chocolate cake too. And let me tell you this one tastes SO similar to that delicious memory from so long ago! Unfortunately, we lost that recipe - so I am estatic to have found this one! I don't have an electric mixer so I have to do it all by hand. I made sure to beat the eggs well in a separate bowl with the vanilla before adding to the mixture. I also took the suggestion of strong brewed coffee instead of boiling water. Don't worry, you won't taste the coffee flavour at all - I personally dislike mocha (choc/coffee) flavour. I also greased the pan and used cocoa instead of flour to coat it. Didn't bother with any parchment paper - didn't have any - and it came out the pan just fine. I use a dark pan, so next time I would reduce the cooking time. Rich, moist and delicious overall though! So good I passed it along to my mom to try out!

by far the best cake I've ever had. just take precautions like heavily spraying down pans, filling them only halfway, letting it cook the longer time, and letting it cool a while both in the pans and out of the pans. it wont be the "hot out of the oven" when you get to it, but it is still warm and "sink your teeth into" good

I am only rating the cake, not the icing as I used a family favorite (boiled icing).  The only change I made was to substitute coffee for the boiling water as I know coffee enhances the flavour of chocolate.

This recipe is divine.  So moist and tasty.

I made this (the cake, not the frosting) because I wanted a moist chocolate cake, and the reviews were so good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very moist - the texture was perfect.  But there wasn't much of a chocolate flavor.  The cake was dark, but the flavor was boring.  There was also a bit of an off-taste - I think from the oil.  I used canola oil, and it wasn't rancid.  Maybe another oil would have less taste.  I was disappointed, and I won't make it again.

AMAZING! this cake was so delicious and moist, could not have been more impressed. Also used the frosting recipe but only added about 3 cups icing sugar and a bit more milk. This is a recipe to save and serve to friends and family(:

This cake is incredible.  Even people who don't love chocolate go nuts for it.  I made it with hot coffee instead of water, but that was the only change made to this wonderful recipe.  Enjoy!

I found  this recipe very easy to make. I made  it for a friend's birthday and it had great reviews. I personally found it a bit sweet, but it is supposed to be that way! Definitely grease and flour the pans as  it tried to stick a little bit. I let them fully cool before trying to remove them.
The icing is easy and spreads beautifully.

This was pretty good but just not 5 stars in my opinion. It seemed a tad dry for what I was expecting to be a super moist cake. If I try it again I will pull it out of the oven sooner and see if that helps.

Just made this cake and was concerned about the runny consistency. It did rise. I waited 20 minutes for them to cool before "de-panning" (after reading other reviews). It did try to fall apart as I was dividing the layers, but I was able to save it. I used the icing recipe substituting 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter instead of more chocolate. It was delicious!

This is the recipe from the back of the Hershey cocoa powder container. I have made this cake many times and it always turns out perfect. Last time I made it I used the dark cocoa powder and it was fantastic. It always tastes better the next day. 
 Make this cake in 2 round cake pans, not a spring form pan. If you are using a spring form pan you must wrap the outside of the pan in aluminum foil to avoid the batter leaking out.

Followed recipe exactly. Best chocolate cake EVER! I was concerned when I saw the soupy mess after adding the boiling water but don't be. It was PERFECT. Yes I generously greased and floured the non-stick pans I used and it took the entire 35 minutes to cook. Came out of pans perfectly and no mess. The icing was also incredible.

Absolutely perfect.  The batter is more runny than most cakes but baked beautifully. Light, fluffy, choclately deliciousness. I had to bake about 10 mins longer than recipe called for. I let cool for 20 mins before transferring it from the pans. It held up perfectly for frosting/decorating. Anyone who gives this cake anything less than 5 stars has done something wrong. It is absolutely amazing.

Loved it!  This was by far the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  The cake is so chocolaty and the icing is the creamiest richest chocolate I have ever worked with.  Easy instructions and simple ingredients.  Although I did not read the instructions fully before adding the boiling water all at once then using the mixer, it turned out wonderfully well anyway.  Excellent!

Perfect!! I followed the recipe to a T and it was amazing!  Used two round cake pans from the dollar store and still had excellent results.  I sprayed the pans and then put parchment in the bottom layer & sprayed that too.  No sticking or crumb issues. It was just perfect! Best chocolate cake I've ever made!

Delicious and nothing but. I substituted coffee for the water, but otherwise did exactly as it said and it was wonderful. Not sure why others had problems removing it. Oil the pans, dust with cocoa powder, and put a parchment paper circle on the bottom of the pan. Comes out with no fuss. (Also did I mention that it tasted fantastic?)

This was absolutely the best chocolate cake batter I have EVER had in my entire life, not overly sweet and it was totally moist.  It's sure to sooth the most particular sweet tooth...especially if you're a chocolate lover such as myself.  I made a couple minor adjustments.  I didn't have milk on hand so I replaced the milk with 2/3 cups of condensed canned milk mixed with 1/3 cup of water.  I used a cup of freshly brewed hot coffee to replace the cup of hot boiling water, and I used a chocolate drizzle instead of the frosting in this posting (as my cake was prepared in a round pound cake pan) and finally I sprinkled 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of crushed macadamia nuts on top after the drizzle. OMG, I will make this cake for the rest of my life, and will never use any other chocolate cake recipe EVER!!!  It's perfection!!  Thanks so much for posting this heavenly treat.

I made this cake with 3 eggs(my eggs were small)and changed the milk to evaporated milk,baked it in a sprayed oil covered 9x13 , it baked up perfect! I then slit the cake into 2 9x13 layers, used 1/3 of the frosting to mix with a jar of marshmellow creme for the filling and frosted the cake with the rest of the frosting and came up with a great WHOOPIE CAKE ! Real
ly rich!!!

Made this in a 9x13 pan. Needed to add a little more milk for the frosting. Was very rich and delicious!!

This recipe is amazing! The recipe is easy and I have all the ingredients in my kitchen already. The batter does come out soupy, but it bakes up really moist and fluffy. I actually used this cake batter to make cupcakes, and it was hard to scoop into the cups, but totally worth it. I didn't make the icing, however, and chose to use my own.

Awesome!! Totally awesome! I confess I was concerned because the mix was so watery when I added the boiling water but I continued to follow the instructions; glad I did because it turned out great!  I used almond milk instead of regular milk with great results. This cake was so good it didn't last long in our house. I will be making this again.

EASY & DELICIOUS!!...I was a little hesitate to add the boiling water but don't worry, your cake batter will be thin but it turns out great!!  On another note, I actually forgot to hand stir the boiling water. I poured it in while my electric mixer was going & it was fine.

I confess this was converted from wheat flour to a gluten free mix of brown rice, tapioca and potato starch. However, my family would have me know that the cake itself was not sweet enough. It was just average. Considering I could have gone to a mix and it would have tasted better, I will probably not make this again.

Cake tasted great but after I frosted it top later slid off and split in three pieces. I ended up tossing it in a serving bowl and serving it with raspberries and whipped cream, almost trifle like. I did make it dairy free and used Earth Balance instead of butter and used rice milk. I often use these substitutions for baked goods and this is the first time I had a bit of a disaster.

I took to Christmas get together.  I tasted a bite and it was dry.  Everyone I asked that tasted it said yes it was dry.  Icing was good.  I've had better bought cake mixes without all the work, I made Aunt Joyce's last year and it was very good

this is the best chocolate cake i have ever had!!! i comes perfect, not too dense and moist. and to get better results of flavor, i took the advice of some to add brewed coffee instead of boiling water. to be honest i was a little supervised that i couldnt taste the coffee. then again, i wasnt going for a coffee cake.

I've been baking and/or eating chocolate cakes for many years and this is the best one ever. Moist, dense but not heavy, extremely chocolatey, just delicious. I used Ghirardelli cocoa which I like  better than the dutch-processed kind, but if you just use a good quality cocoa you will no doubt love it. You sure do use a lot of it! I did two layers rather than four or the sake of time but it handled and looked great. Had no trouble getting them out of the pans. It didn't need all of the frosting this recipe makes which is notable in that I usually make extra. Your folks will love this cake.

Fabulous!  Made just as directed as cupcakes.  They didn't take long at all to bake and taste fantastic.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Oh, I did just PAM the pan instead of flowering it and that was fine.  5 starts.  Much better than the mixes out there.

I made only the cake since my son wanted a chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream. I followed the directions exactly as written except I used cake flour instead of AP. I put the batter in buttered/floured 9" Wilton round pans. I baked for 35 minutes and let cool entirely in the pans. They didn't stick or break up when I took them out but were very, very moist. The cake itself held up well, split beautifully for 4 layers, and tasted absolutely delicious. This will probably be my go-to homemade chocolate cake recipe now.

The cake is fantastic and very chocolatey although the amount of cocoa powder used is normal for choc cake.
The moisture is incredible.maybe one of the drawback its not really too-firm-held in-place when you cut it out to serve.
Heck, the taste is amazing much more better than choolate cake in shop.
The ingredints also cheap and easy to get.
For the topping i chose recipe from one of thecomments here. Magnificient!

Without a doubt my favorite cake recipe. I have made it as is and have also replaced the cup of water with a cup of hot coffee. Both are amazing. This also works well for cupcakes.

I gave up making boxed cake mixes a few years ago and have struggled to find a from scratch recipe that was both moist and had the texture I wanted...most were coming out as far too dense and just not satisfying.  I no longer need to look for a chocolate cake recipe...THIS IS IT!!!  Rich, flavorful, moist and just the right texture.  I did use another commenter's tip to not grease or flour the sides of the cake pan and I do use parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan.  No sticking and these layers baked perfectly evenly...my cake looked like it could have been featured in a magazine.  So happy I tried this recipe!

This cake was delicious! I have tried many chocolate cake recipes but found them too dry and tedious.  This cake however was easy to make and moist. I took the advice of other reviewers and used coffee instead of hot water and used one pan for 45mins. Result ? Perfect! The frosting was also one of the best I have made although I did cut it in half since I wasn't making a layer cake. Still had some left over too! Loved this recipe. It actually made me sign up lol

I started to say I made this cake exactly like the recipe but I think I may have accidentally left out the baking powder.  Cake was perfect. I had a lot of icing left over and like someone else said it was a bit gritty and a tad to sweet for me. I did notice it was better tasting the next day. I will make the cake again but will either make changes to the icing or will use a different icing.

This was the second time I've baked a cake from scratch and this turned out so much better than the first!!! We LOVE, LOVE chocolate and this cake exceeded my expectations! It's so moist and fudgey! Only thing I changed to the cake was to lessen the sugar amount the recipe called for, we may love sweets but not the extreme sugary sweets. I used 1 1/2 cups and a pinch of sugar instead of the 2 cups. As for the frosting, the only cocoa powder I had on hand was 100% pure cocoa and though our 7 year old LOVED it, it was a bit too rich and mocha tasting for my husband - which I thought he would have loved. Will def try semi-sweet or milk chocolate powder next time. I am so glad to have found this recipe and decided to make it. I may never go back to box cakes again!

This is the best chocolate cake in my recipe arsenal.  It is both moist and dense.  I get raves every time I make it, as well as recipe requests.

Very very good! I subbed water for strong coffee, and it seemed to get better as it sat, but it didn't set long!

This cake is so tasty. I followed the directions to a tee and the cake came out super yummy. I had an issue with the consistency of the frosting. It kind of ran down the sides of the cake. I found that refrigerating the frosting over nigh thickens up the frosting so it doesn't run off the sides. Other than that.. Delicious cake!

I made this cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday and in a house full of cake-haters it's already almost gone in less than 2 days!!  This is the best cake I've ever made.  Also, my mixer broke just before I made it and it still turned out great!  WOW.

Best Moist Cake I've ever eaten, It has that fresh right out of the oven taste, not the hard edges or cake that taste moist for only one day. I love the flavor not overly rich but flavorful with each bit. I also like the simple ingredients, a new family favorite !!

I have made cakes for years now, but only once ever before from scratch with disastrous results. This one is super! It is moist, but also light and springy, too. I added some dark chocolate chips in.  The batter is very very thin, so don't fill pans more than half way. An 11" round took an additional 10 minutes cooking time. This made an 11" and an 8" round size from the same recipe. I used a vanilla buttercream frosting with it. Delicious!  So happy to find a recipe from scratch that is good as I seem to be sensitive to the chemicals in box cake mixes and store bought cakes.

I made this cake for a friend who is an admitted chocoholic. I took it to work and it was proclaimed "the best chocolate cake" they'd ever had! It tasted as good or better than the expensive chocolate cakes I buy from the best bakery in town. I'm not a cook, but I do enjoy baking occasionally and if you're wanting a WOW factor from a simple recipe, this is the one to try! I used boiling water (not coffee) because the recipient and I do not like coffee. It was fantastic! The quality of this cake is equal to professional level cakes. Very impressive.

this is great recipe.  I've made it once before, as a cake and it was great. But,do not, repeat, do not use this recipe for cupcakes.   when baked in a cake pan, the consistency is fine, but this batter is to runny for cupcake tins. tastes great anyway!!

Simply fabulous.  I bake a LOT.  I am replacing my old chocolate cake recipe with this one.  Moist, easy delicious.  This is very rich and sweet, so a little bit goes a long way.  If you are having a hard time slicing the layers for frosting try putting it in the fridge for a little bit.  It will keep it from breaking as you cut and lift the layers to stack.  I made it exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing.

Perfection! This cake was super delicious with no changes to the recipe. Very chocolatey and not too sweet. I didn't even have to cut any sugar from the icing which I normally do with butter cream frosting recipes. Thanks!

I love chocolate but we didn't like this.  These didn't work out as cupcakes.  Even though I filled the cupcake liner to 2/3, a few over-flowed and had an ugly appearance.  Anyway,  the rating is for the overall taste...it was dense and gummy.

This cake is amazing. I used my stand mixer and blended the dry ingredients first, measuring the flour the right way. While it was still running I added the oil and milk first, then eggs and let it run on medium high for quite a few minutes. When I measured out the water, I added a bit before microwaving. As it steamed out when boiling it came down to a cup. I turned off the mixer and poured in the water then mixed on the lowest setting for 30 seconds and then medium low for another 30 seconds. Since I only have 1 round cake pan I used a pie pan for the second pan. My 5 year old insisted we add some chocolate chips so we sprinkled a handful on top right before baking. Since I have a tiny oven I put one on the top shelf and another on the bottom, baking for 17 minutes and then switching for another 15. They came out perfectly. Next time I will try using coffee instead of water like one reviewer suggested. I would like to see if it would work with a substitute for the eggs, so we can lick the beaters and not waste any chocolate. The color was very dark, the texture was fluffy and moist, and we ate half of it before we had a chance to make the frosting. Super yummy and easy! I will make this cake again and again.

Holy Moley! This cake is awesome.  It's like a super cakey brownie.  The cake alone is delicious.  No icing is needed, but the icing is good too.  I saw on here that someone used a drizzle instead, which would probably be great, I was thinking something like a black forest type topping as well.  Delicious cake.  Thanks for all the prev. reviews guys, I would have thought I was doing something wrong had I not seen that it's soupy.

I really like the recipe, just the frosting is really sweet. I made this cake second time, and cut down on the sugar, I've put 3 cups confectioners sugar, still too sweet for me, but my family loves it. Next time maybe I will cut back more on sugar. Also, leave the cake to cool out completely before cutting it. It's much more easier. Overall, good cake recipe :)

Very thick and rich. Tastes like brownie cake, a little too sweet for my liking, but family loved it. If you love chocolate you'll love this. Icing was great and easy to work with, had a lot left over too.

I made this recipe for a friend's birthday -- my first time making a cake from scratch.  After reading the reviews, I opted to substitute one cup of hot coffee for the water in the recipe.  It turned out fantastic and was a hit with all of my friends!! Instead of buttercream (not a fan), I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting and it was the perfect match for this cake.  I will actually be making this again today for my partner's birthday party..

Didn't come out how I'd expected at all, it was too bitter and more of a dark chocolate taste. I'm thinking it could have been a mistake on my part, however.

The cake is very good and moist although it wasn't easy transferring it from the pan even 12 hours after it was done baking. The icing though it not good at all. Its extremely sweet and you can taste the sugar. Even an extra 2 tables of butter didn't help. Went with store bought instead

I love this recipe! I have used it on cakes and cupcakes adding 1 cup of brewed hot coffee and 360 g bag of semisweet chocolate chips! It's just perfect and everyone loves it!

Wow, I absolutely LOVE this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing it! I decorate cakes and I have been looking for a good chocolate cake recipe for quite some time now. This cake was VERY moist but sturdy, which is great! And it is sooo yummy it doesn't need any icing or anything, it is just perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and I say this recipe is definitely a keeper! The only thing I would suggest is if you are flipping it out of the pan to decorate, put a piece of parchment paper on the bottom of the pan to make sure it doesn't stick.

This cake was SO moist!  It was very "watery" when it went into the over, I was skeptical, however, it came out quite flawless. By far, the best chocolate cake recipe to date!

Tastes good....but too sticky.  When you break it apart it looks normal, but it is sticky when chewed, kind of gummy.  It's kind of weird.  I'll go back to my old recipe.

Soooo good! My kids and I made this 3 times in one month for different occasions (we didn't eat all of it, we shared). I also substituted coffee instead of milk in the frosting. Very moist, very dense, very decadent. Our go-to chocolate cake.

Very moist, super chocolaty, amazing cake! We didn't use the frosting recipe part (made our own cream cheese frosting instead). The only change we made was reducing the sugar (still came out pleasantly sweet) by about half and using a 50/50 whole wheat and white flour mix (to add a little fiber). Great recipe and definitely converted my friends away from using box cake mixes ever again.

The cake was very simple to bake and the instructions are very clear too. Its light, fluffy and delicious. Though I feel that the icing was a bit excessive it still tasted amazing and everyone in the family loved it! Definitely gonna bake this again soon :-)

This cake is awesome, and a chocolate lovers dream! I have made it with both hot water and coffee (not changing anything else), both are delicious. I used to think no homemade cake could compete with a boxed mix. I know that seems wrong, but it was my opinion, based on previous homemade recipes I had tried. Then I gave this cake a try, and it blew all other recipes (and even boxed mixes) away! SOOOO GOOOOD! Thanks for sharing it!

This has been my go-to chocolate cake recipe for years,whether it be baked in a 9x13 pan, 3-8" layers, 2-9" layers, cupcakes......all work great, but a little common sense goes a long way!I often use coffee instead of water and have iced with every flavour imaginable.

Followed the cake part completely but used my chocolate sauce recipe instead of the the frosting. Never used boiling water in a cake batter before was I was interested in seeing what happened. It was great! Moist, fluffy, and tasted decadent. I topped with whole walnuts and halved strawberries. Made it last night and there is only one piece left!

We made this cake and we cut back like 1/2 cup of cocoa on the frosting and I think like 1 cup on the powdered sugar also on the frosting. We loved the cake.

This cake turned out great--and I read the instructions too fast and dumped the boiling water in with the other wet ingredients. Oops. Still great!
Here's how to avoid sticking: Grease the pans, then put cut-to-fit circles of parchment paper in the bottoms, grease them, and flour the whole thing. The cakes will turn out beautifully and the parchment paper peels off.

The cake itself turned out very moist and flavorful. The frosting is another story. The frosting is so full of unsweetened cocoa that is is almost chalky instead of smooth the way frosting should be. Not very sweet as it is overwhelmed by the cocoa. I will make the cake again but next time I will use a different frosting recipe.

Made cupcakes! Switched hot water for hot coffee, reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, filled tins NO MORE than 2/3 full, baked 25-27min.  Also only made a third the icing while cutting out more sugar (1/4c butter, 1/2c cocoa, 1/3c milk, 1 1/2c icing sugar, splash vanilla) it was plenty sweet and I still used only half. I suppose you could pile it thicker...

Yes, this IS the best cake in the world!  Amazingly moist, and melt in your mouth delicious.  Replaced the the boiling water with freshly brewed hot coffee.  Also, used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa in both the cake and frosting.  Wished I'd taken a picture...it was very dark and pretty, but it went too fast!  This will be my 'go to' chocolate cake from now on!

Perfect, I followed the recipe to a T and it was absolutely amazing!!! Who knew the secret to effortlessly frosting a cake would be homemade frosting.

Yum!  But a little too sweet, might use a little less sugar next time.

Loved the way this cake came out. It was very moist and a big hit. I'm not a chocolate fan at all and neither are my kids, but we all liked it.

Okay, I read a lot of reviews for this recipe and I seen that people had trouble getting it out of the pans or that the batter over flowed in the oven. Honestly, I was starting to worry about making this cake because I thought it was going to turn out really bad! I made a few changes to the recipe, but I think I could have left it the way it was because I believe I have a recipe a lot like this one. But anyway, I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar, one cup of coffee instead of water, and I melted 1/2 a cup of chocolate and mixed it in too. The cake tuned out really moist, and sooo good! I didn't fill my pans quite as full as I would normally because I didn't want a mess like others had, but that didn't happen, and they came out of the pans with no problem. I think it would have been good even if I hadn't changed the recipe. I'm making it for someone's retirement party it was that good!

These are lovely rich and moist. Easy recipe to follow. Probably could have cooked for an extra minute. Added just a small amount of Betty Crocker frosting on the top but they are so rich don't really need it but made them taste incredible. Cant wait to have another one tomorrow. Only strange thing in the top layer becomes quite sticky moist after baking so it looks a bit strange if it is not frosted.

It was an absolute LOVE at the birthday party that I baked this cake for. I actually had run out of confectioners sugar by 1 cup, for the icing. I substituted with a cup of standard granulated sugar. It turned out a bit crunchy and gritty. However, the guests were enthused, saying that they loved the crunchiness and the little crystal spurts of sugar in the icing. So if you think your guests will like the extra crunch and crystal, go for that last cup of sugar in the icing to be granulated. ;)

Very, very good.  Made a big dog cake for my son's 3rd birthday, as well as a strawberry cake for his twin sister, and the chocolate cake was by FAR superior.  It was fudgy and moist, and it took well to sitting a couple of nights (cooling and decorating take time).  I will make this one again and again!  Also not difficult as recipes go, and the kids helped out a bit.

Fantastic!! Made this cake for my son for his birthday as a special request. He's a chocolate freak! This was the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It was very moist and delicious. I got a ton of compliments on it and best of all, 2 thumbs up from my son! Didn't change a thing on the recipe made it as stated.

This cake tastes great. It holds it's shape pretty well and moist. I used this recipe as my chocolate cake for my kitkat almond joy birthday cake. The  icing like everything else out there is sweet so I suggest a thin layer of it.

Moist, delicious cake!!  Followed the advice of one reviewer and used a cup of hot brewed coffee instead of hot water - the cake was amazing.  The frosting was delicious - this is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for posting!!

This cake was a hit! I used almond milk instead of regular milk, apple sauce instead of vegetable oil and tea instead of plain old boiling water. The tea I used is David's Tea, Chocolate Rocket flavour. It definitely added deliciousness! I used Green and Blacks' cocoa cuz it's a personal favourite. For the icing I used a homemade white chocolate cream icing which complimented it well. I cooked it in a single bundt cake pan for about 25 minutes on a slightly lower temperature to avoid burning the top. It was super moist and scrumptious!

I just wanted to say that I made this cake AND frosting with margarine and soy milk (Brother-in-law has milk protein allergy. yay.) and it came out so rich and yummy, none of us could finish a piece.  
I wouldn't have changed the recipe if I didn't have to, and I won't change it for my birthday next month! ;)  I'll bet it's delicious!

Was skeptical after seeing the soupy batter after follwing hte directions, but it they baked up beautifully!! Moist and chocholately.  The batter does rise quite a bit, my  heart cake pans overflowed while baking, so next time will leave more room.

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe. I made it for my husband's birthday and it turned out amazingly. I only make about half of the recommended amount of frosting, though, because even with two layers I ended up with a giant bowl of extra frosting.

Espresso-Cinnamon variation.  Substitute one cup strong-brewed coffee or espresso for the boiling water.  Add one teaspoon to one tablespoon of cinnamon to the frosting (depending on how "spicy" you like your icing).  After frosting, lightly dust with cinnamon and powdered sugar.

This cake came out perfectly!  This was my first time baking a chocolate cake.  My daughter and I felt like the frosting may not be enough to cover the entire cake so we made more only to discover that the amount that the recipe makes is perfect!  We loved the moistness of the cake!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Wow!  A lot of chocolate!  I was concerned as everyone else was about the thinness of the cake batter but it turned out fine.  I had to add more milk to the frosting because it was so thick in consistency. Cake is wonderful! Icing is very sweet.

This was my first time making a cake from scratch, and first, let me say: The cake tastes awesome. The icing and cake flavors go very well together. Truly devlish!  

For the presentation: I was thrown off by how moist the cake is. It was sticky! Adding the boiling water really makes a difference in the texture. It was so sticky, I had trouble removing it from the greased and floured pan.  Also, the cake stuck to my spoon when putting on the icing, even though it was completely cooled.  I was also surprised with the amount of cake the batter made.  I could have used double the cake for the amount of icing!

All in all, this is a keeper.  As I improve on my technique, I'm sure I'll be able to perfect the process.  This was a good start!

This cake is awesome!!! The only problem I had was the layers baking uneven so my cake look a little funny. But as long as it tastes good, that's all that matters, I am no professional cake decorator :)
The frosting was even better. I had to add a little more sugar than what was called for to thicken it up a bit. 
I will continue to use this great recipe!!!

This cake was moist and delicious. Easy to make, not much longer than an out of the box recipe. Not overly sweet but wonderfully chocolatey. Will definitely be making this again. It was a little too much batter for my cake pans and it did spill over a bit when it rose but well worth it. May be I'll make two rounds and a cupcake. Love this recipe, made just as directed and it was PERFECT! This is our new favorite cake recipe! Best part, we know what's in the cake! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is my "go to" recipe for chocolate cake. I like to bake mine in a bundt pan - it is the perfect amount of batter, and turns out beautifully each time. I found with a bundt pan, there was way too much frosting, so I cut that in half. It's delicious!

I started to make this cake and once I was done I sat down to read the reviews. I was shocked at all the negative feedback it received, I then became nervous and worried about my cake. Surprisingly  it was so delicious my family is requesting that I make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very moist cake, not too rich. So easy to cut in nice wedges. Not crumbly at all. EASY  and quick. No need for the artificial tasting box mix anymore!

This was a hit. I made it for Thanksgiving, and my family has asked for it for Christmas and New Years. I also used a white cake recipe and layered white/chocolate for two cakes. YUMMY!!!

This is absolutely delicious. So moist and so delicious. I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the oil because I don't like to use oil in any recipe and it turned out perfect. I also substituted water for the milk because we don't drink milk (and thus never have any) and it was fine. I use Ghiradelli cocoa powder. I make this every time I want to make a cake. I do 2 9-inch layers and there is WAY too much frosting, and I load it on, but I haven't figured out exactly how much is perfect (half the frosting recipe is too little). We just end up saving it - it is very fudgelike.

This is the only chocolate cake recipe anyone should ever have. It's moist, dense and couldn't be easier to make. I've made this cake several times and it always comes out perfect. Be sure to use the best cocoa powder you can find and always use real vanilla extract! None of that artificial stuff.

This was more like 4.5 stars...it could be a little more dense, i think the boiling water is a little too much, but it has great flavor and is very moist.

This cake is a winner! It was so easy and scrumptious. It reminds me of a smaller version of Claim Jumper's chocolate cake. I followed the directions exactly and with excellent results. I'll be passing this one around.

WOW....I just realized, after reading the rest of the reviews, that I COMPLETELY OMITTED the boiling water.  The cake turned out GREAT!  It was moist and oh-so-chocolatey.  I wonder if the fact that I used a bunt pan made the difference??

I made this using coffee instead of water as other reviewers suggested. It was good, but didn't rise as much as I would like both time I made it. So good flavour, better the second day.

I just made this cake. I haven't made the frosting yet. Made a operator error when attempting to take out the cake from the pan. Took a bite of the pieces that didn't come out of the pan. And wow, it tastes good. First cake I ever made competely from scratch. Will use this recipe for all future chocolate cakes I make in the future.

This cake was very light when I took it out of the pan and I was concerned because I thought it would have no substance. But it somehow was airy but very dense, almost brownie like. It maintained a very dark brown colour, which makes me think chocolate, chocolate, chocolate! A very sucessful recipe, out of at least two dozen chocolate cake recipes, I think I found my favorite!

This was the best chocolate cake I ever made. I will never again buy boxed cake mix. Came out very moist. Mine was a little on the dense side but not much and I loved it that way. I'm a huge chocolate fan and may put chocolate chips in the batter next time a little gooey-ness!

Wow!!!  This really IS the best chocolate cake EVER!!  Super easy to make and even the frosting was incredible.  I made the frosting vanilla (without the cocoa) and it was probably the best frosting I've ever had.  I'll do the chocolate frosting next time. Can't wait to make this again!

This was hands down the best cake I ever made, I did not have mike so I used heavy cream in the batter and icing, also toke pinkdk's  suggestion and used coffee, the coffee really maximized the chocolate flavor. The cake did not last long. This is really a great recipe, glad I found it!

Very delicious chocolate cake-this recipe's a keeper.  I definitely suggest using only half the frosting---I cut the recipe (only the frosting part) to 2/3 the recipe and it was more than enough.  Very moist-no adjustments needed. I've already recommended this recipe to my sisters and friends.

I didn't add as much sugar (3 cups) to the buttercream, but the texture, gloss, and flavor of both the cake and icing were perfect.

Great chocolate cake! Moist with a nice crumb...I got two layers out of this recipe, and it would leave really thin layers if I were to torte it. I cut the recipe for the frosting by 2/3, and used it only for the top and piping around the filled center, which was ganache. Rich and delicious. Will use the cake portion again, for sure.

Update: I let this sit overnight in the fridge and upped it from 4 to 5 stars for the cake portion. Letting it sit really brought out the flavor, and the cake itself is just as good or better than any bakery cake. I've been looking for a chocolate cake recipe that is not so dense and heavy or dry, and this fits all three. Definitely a go-to cake recipe.

This cake is just plain delicious!  Although I've made it exactly like the recipe says, I also like using coconut oil instead of veggie oil.  It gives it a really nice twist.

I made cupcakes with this recipe, it was AMAZING, although I will say that if the cake isn't cooled completely, it does stick to the paper lining a lot.  The only change I made was to use olive oil rather than veg oil because it was all I had on hand.

This is an extremely delicious cake. I followed pingdk's lead and used strong coffee in place of the water. I had no problems with pan size or overflow when I followed the recipe as written. I made a ganache for the frosting, so can't rate that, but the cake itself is a thing of beauty.

This cake came out absolutely declic!! I used a bundt cake pan instead of the 2 loaf pans in direcions. You MUST give this recipe a try. Yes it does come out watery after adding the hot water but this is normal. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!! I've been using boxed cakes for 10 years...I will never go back!

I halved the recipe and made 12 cupcakes.  They definitely rise well - though they flattened out a bit while cooling.  The tops were pretty crispy on day one, but softened up to normal cake texture by day two.  The texture of the rest of the cupcake (besides the top) was soft/fairly moist.  The taste was pretty standard chocolate cake - not amazing, but pretty tasty under a good frosting - I used a mint cream cheese frosting, rather than the one in the recipe.  I also stirred about a tsp of instant coffee into the boiling water and added about 1/2 tsp imitation butter flavor with the vanilla (I add that to most cakes - esp ones that don't contain butter - it seems to give a richer, more professional taste).  I'd make this again in a pinch because the ingredients are things I always have on hand, the batter comes together quickly, and the taste was pretty good.  I'm still searching for a five-star chocolate cake recipe, though.

LOVED IT!!! I made it and I thought that the cake was really moist. I ran out of milk when I was about to make the frosting but it turned out just fine. I thought that it would be too sweet, but it was a big hit. Will def be making this again!

For the icing I added a few tablespoons of cream cheese to make it less sweet, it made it taste even better! I had to wait longer then 10 min. before taking the cake out of the pans as well.

Fabulous! I made the recipe exactly as written except that I made a 13x9 sheet cake and I dropped cherry pie filling (1 large spoon, about 4 cherries) in each serving. It was fabulous and my family all loved it. The frosting was my favorite part of the whole cake though, I must confess. Will make this one again.

UPDATE: Made this cake as cupcakes last night. Most moist cake I've ever had. Made the buttercream icing on allrecipes to top them. YUM!!

As stated in previous reviews, I didn't use the entire amount of confectioner's sugar for the frosting.  I probably used more like 4 2/3 cups.  Otherwise, everything came out perfectly.  It may possibly be the richest cake we've ever tasted.  It was amazing.

This cake is really moist and rich. The best part is it's so simple. I did cheat with store bought icing, but it didn't take away from the cake at all. Honestly, because the cake is so moist and full of flavor, you could get away with a simple dusting of powdered sugar. This is now my permanent chocolate cake recipe.

I thought these cupcakes were great, I was shocked when I added to boiling water. I thought something went horribly wrong. But thats how it is suppose to be I guess. I just put them in a bowl with a spout and poured it into the cupcake liners. I found that pouring this batter was much easier than spooning regular batter. The tops of my cupcakes turned out crunchy, which everybody liked. I made Crème de menthe frosting with these. Everybody loved these, including my picky boyfriend who hates anything that isnt a chocolate chip cookie.

Super easy to make and fluffy and moist. Will not buy boxed cake mix anymore. I only used 1-1/2 sugar to cut down on the sweetness. I layered it in the middle with chocolate pudding then frosted the outside. I think I will use hot coffee next time to enhance the chocolate taste.

Very moist and rich! We are not coffee drinkers at this house but I did use coffee instead of the boiling water because I think it really enhances the flavor of chocolate. I used this for my daughter's birthday cake and everyone loved it!

i absolutely love this recipe!!! I prepared the recipe exactly and it came out sooo perfect!!!! I frosted it with a caramel buttercream and put a milk chocolate cocoa buttercream in the middle then I garnished it with pecans and chocolate shavings!!! Such great reviews from my family and friends!!!. It was like a turtle cake:) This will def be my go to chocolate cake recipe from here on out. I was skeptical at first because of how watery the batter is but like I said this cake was perfectly moist and delish!!!

After reading a lot of the reviews, i decided to try this recipe - and I am so glad I did!! it was the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  Very moist, and did not fall apart.  I used cherry preserves for the filling and it really complimented the chocolate.  the frosting recipe is also very good!

This cake is truly superb - very moist, very chocolately, rich and creamy icing.  I've never tasted a chocolate cake this good, seriously!  The only changes I made were switching the cup of boiling water for a cup of hot brewed coffee, and I had to bake for 50 minutes before a toothpick came out clean.  I had no spillage at all when I divided the batter between 2 layer cake pans.  Perfect amount of icing to complete the 4 layers with generous amounts.  I'd give this 10 stars if I could - truly scrumptious!

maybe it was just because I had such high expectations for this cake given the great reviews, but I was not impressed. It just tasted like a giant brownie, which is great if you like brownies, but I don't. The cake came out uneven, one side was higher than the other. For the frosting, I used less than 3 and I still had too much frosting. I will not be making this cake again.

I don't ever rate the food I make but I HAD to rate this one...SO good!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! The cake was so moist and tasty, and the icing was perfect - not sweet like store bought but just like the high end cupcake stores. My friends were all hassling me for the recipe. I will never buy a boxed cake again!! (which is what I always did before *blush)

It's pretty hard to come across a moist, delicious cake recipe that doesn't use prepackaged cake mix and pudding. I made one little change to this recipe, and that was melting 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into the boiling water before mixing it in with the batter. The cake turned out wonderfully (as with other reviewers, I was concerned about the batter being too watery) and it tasted like the cupcakes you buy for $5 bucks each. Awesome recipe!

Mine turned out SO CRUMBLY. I had the hardest time frosting it. I partially blame the pan I used (I'm a baker just starting out so I have a lot of hand me downs) because it all started by the cakes getting stuck in there. Maybe if that hadn't happened it would've been much easier to frost but it just fell apart for me. The frosting is amazing!

Made this cake last week for a friend's birthday, and yes, it's very moist and delicious.

As suggested by others, I added 1 cup of hot coffee (instant vanilla coffee), reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups instead of the 2 cups as per the recipe and used unsalted melted butter instead of the oil.

I frosted it with a boiled icing and sprinkled the top and 4 layers (I sliced the cakes horizontally in 2) with toasted coconut and skor bits.  Everyone loved this cake - will be making this cake again.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday. It was a huge success. Very moist and the icing was great! Even better the second day. Just a note the batter will look very watery. But it rises perfectly.  Perfect recipe for anyone with a sweet tooth!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. He told me he wanted a chocolatey cake and that's exactly what this is! It's super easy to make and the frosting takes almost exactly as long to make as the cake does to bake so you don't have to worry about doing two things at once. 

I do have a TIP though for you frosting makers: if your frosting is too hard to mix, try using your hands. Squishing the frosting between your fingers really helps it to mix together.  :)

THis cake was AMAZING!.  I didn't have a full 3/4 cup of cocoa so added 1 oz of semisweet choc and also used 1/4 butter and 1/4 oil.  The rest I did exactly as written.  Make it in a bundt pan.  It is soooo moist.  I did not make the suggested frosting...just make a glaze of my own concoction.  Definatley will make this again.

Tasted amazing!  Would have given it 5 stars, but when baking in the oven the cake overflowed all over the bottom of my oven.  Not sure why this happened or what I might have done wrong, but it turned into a HUGE mess!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. It was a huge success!!! One of his called weeks after to say he had dreamed about the cake I made. It was rich and moist and delicious. The boiling water is probably what did it. 
I think it is important to not cheap out on the cocoa, invest in a good one. 
For the icing though I cut the icing sugar down to barely 4 cups and it was quite sweet. Also I didnt end up using all the icing on the cake even though I spread it on quite thick. 

This will be by default chocolate cake from now on!!!

Best cake ever! I was looking for a good recipe to make a bday cake and tried a Martha Stewart recipe before this one and that one was dry and bland, THIS cake is perfectly moist and flavorful. I was worried because my batter seemed really thin but it bakes wonderfully. Will be using this to make my daughters birthday cake next month, I'm positive it'll be devoured as fast as my 'test' cake was!

Very delicious! Very moist, had trouble getting it out of the pan but it came out great! I made chocolate frosting to frost the top and sides, and made a strawberry frosting for the filling. So yummy!

Very rich and moist cake. Great for the chocolate lover - and doesn't give that heavy feeling you get when eating a rich chocolate cake. It's always a big hit, and I get requests for it all the time. Great recipe!

This cake doesn't bake up nice, even and dry. Its a sloppy disaster in the making. I attempted it TWICE this afternoon, and even with a longer cook time and less water it came out too moist to hold together! It tastes great but there's something really wrong with the texture... Unless you're attempting a lava cake!

The cake is amazing. The recipe is perfect. I haven't found a chocolate cake recipe that is better. It's super moist, rich flavor, but not to heavy. However the icing in this recipe is not that great.

It was the best chocolate cake I have had in a long time!. We switched the boiling water to hot coffee, kept everything else the same. The cake came out moist and its intense chocolate flavor made everyone happy. This will be our recipe for chocolate cake from now on!

This cake is phenomenal; the crumb is perfect and moist (not fudgey). This recipe came recommended by my sister-in-law, and it will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe. Changes: I used dark chocolate cocoa powder because that's what I had, and I used strong coffee instead of water because sis recommended that. WOW!

I made this into cupcakes without the chocolate frosting that was suggested.  I had some peppermint frosting that I bought during Christmas that I thought would taste really yummy...and it did!

The batter does look sort of soupy once the boiling water is added, but it cooks just great.  For the cupcakes, I filled the first set about halfway up the liners and the second set I filled 2/3 way up the liner.  2/3 was too full for these and many of the second set spilled out onto the pan.  I also hand mixed every ingredient as I put it into the bowl.  Super tasty!  My daughter said I should make them every day!!  :)

So very good and moist.  I used the cup of strong coffee as another reviewer suggested and it definitely enhanced the chocolate flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent chocolate cake! Followed recipe to a T, just used my own icing. This is the first time I have gotten a chocolate cake to taste better than the boxed chocolate cake (which is made moist and fluffy with artificial chemicals) This recipe will be my new stand by.

Not too sweet, easy to make! I wasn't sure when I made the batter and the consistency was a little thin, but it came out excellent. Most def will be using this recipe in the future!

I'm with Eli on this one.  This is the only recipe I use for chocolate cake and you must follow the instructions to the letter.  With scratch cakes; unlike the boxed cake varieties which allow more room for error, you must be pretty precise.  Do test the cake to see if it is done and I usually take the cake out when a few crumbs adhere to the tooth pic.  If you over bake the cake you will have a dry cake on your hands and no amount of frosting will help.  I also substitute the boiling water for coffee which really enhances the chocolate flavor.  Wonderful moist cake.

This is probably the best chocolate cake ever. It's so rich and moist, but not overly rich and not too sweet. For the frosting I only used 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar because I don't like a super sweet frosting. I've made this recipe 3 times and each time it turned out fantastic.

Awesome cake - I mixed by hand as I don't have an electric mixer and it came out fine.  I was worried the cake might have an 'oily' taste which I really hate from the canola oil - but all you get is an intense, moist chocolate cake - wonderful!

This was an awesome cake.  I made it for my daughter's birhday and it was a hit!  I did have to thicken the icing with some flour, but over ask it was a good cake,perfect chocolate taste without being overly sweet.

I made this cake exactly as directed, with no deviations. It was delicious at first, but had a strong after taste of eggs. My kids wouldn't eat it, so we ended up throwing it out and making brownies instead. I poked a toothpick in the middle when it was done baking, and it came out clean, but the cake was pretty sticky so it's possible that it was undercooked. I probably won't be making this cake again.

Very good! Used to make cupcakes and made 24 regular or 48 mini cupcakes. Just make sure if you make cupcakes bake them for less time otherwise they'll be very dry. Will make again but however you make these DO NOT OVERBAKE! :)

Wasn't as good as something that came from a box. Would have been a bigger fan if the reviews hadn't led me to think this was going to be the most mind-blowing cake ever. Frosting had to much cocoa in it for my taste, ended up completely altering it with caramel sauce and cane sugar and it came out better. Meh, overall not a bad taste but not amazing.

Awesome Cake!!!  I didn't do the icing because I had some I needed to use, but it was the best chocolate cake I've ever had!!!  My husband hates chocolate cake and he even liked it!  The only other thing I did differently was made it in one cake pan because I didn't have smaller ones!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  I'm fighting the temptation not to eat a second piece!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  I've never made icing from scratch and have only once made a cake.  This was such an easy recipe and was a hit with my whole family!  I can't wait for an excuse to make it again.
(I did have to add a little more milk to the icing--maybe 1/4 to 1/3 cup?) to make it a little easier for me to spread on the cake.  And, like another review says, if you don't cut the cake in half to make four layers, you have a lot of icing.  But I just used a generous amount on the top and sides.  Love this cake!

LOVE this cake & frosting!  I added 1 T of Chambord to cake and frosting instead of vanilla - it's a delicious option.  And I also tried Grand Marnier too - equally as good!

I made a birthday cake for my daughter combining this chocolate cake recipe and the ganache recipe from Martha Stewart's website. I used whipped ganache between the layers and to cover the whole cake. Then I covered the whole cake with unwhipped ganache to make it look shiny. I It turned out great, better than store made cakes. Thanks for a great cake recipe.

I will make this cake again! It was as moist and as chocolatey as promised. I did substitute coffee for the water but otherwise the recipe is perfect and easy to follow. My son who won't eat cake devoured it! I used the 9 inch pans as stated and had no problem with overflow at all. Make sure you grease and flour the pans well as it was a bit tricky getting them out but I did and it was divine. Thank you so much!

First I have to point out that while the cake was baking, the oven was mistakenly turned off.  I don't know if I made the mistake or someone else in the household did it. ( I have a tendency to forget to turn the oven off)   Even though the cake was a bit dry (my fault) it was still very good.  When I made the icing I only had 1 stick of butter so I added a half tub of cream cheese.  It wasn't enough to change the flavor but added the necessary fat and it had a creamy texture.  For someone who doesn't eat a lot of chocolate it is a very rich cake, but also very good.  Took care of my craving quite nicely.

Love love love this cake!! I make this for everything and always get asked for the recipe (in between full-mouthed mumbles of 'omg'). This takes a lot of will power to not eat all in one go!

I don't use this recipes frosting though, I think sticky caramel compliments it much better, making it super sweet & rich. I just use the tinned caramel and melt it down with some cream. I also add in dessicated coconut and/or copped nuts to the caramel.

Makes a great slice or cup cake as well . Enjoy.

This was the easiest and best tasting homemade chocolate cake I have ever made.  I baked it in a bundt pan, and made a light chocolate drizzle.  It stayed moist for days, and was a hit at my work - everyone adored it.  I am never making a boxed cake mix again.  I also am going to try using hot coffee in lieu of the hot water as advised by a previous reviewer - however this cake is absolutely wonderful AS
 IS!

Love this recipe!  No changes necessary. I am no longer allowed to make cake from a box, if my husband has his way;). I took this to our friends' for dessert and it was a big hit with everyone.  Delicious!

Super moist cake which we liked but I'm not a fan of the frosting. Next time I'll use the cake recipe to make a bundt cake and then a different recipe for a chocolate glaze.

This is the most AMAZING chocolate cake recipe I have ever had! The icing was a little to chocolate for me (i prefer milk chocolate over any kind of chocolate) so I added about 1/2 a cup more milk and more powdered sugar to make it a spreadable consistency and now I love it!!! I also put milk chocolate chips in between the layers! :)

This recipe is awesome!!! To alleviate the batter overflow I used 3 cake pans and baked for 20 minutes.. then I did not need to slice into layers.  Also used the cup of coffee that one reviewer suggested.  The only thing I would do differently is to line the pans with parchment other than that recipe is perfect.  Enjoy!

Fantastic cake!  We didn't put the vegetable oil in (accidentally of course) and it was still very moist.  Haven't tried the icing yet, but the cake is my new favorite!

This recipe was really great! I was looking for a recipe that used cocoa powder so that I didnt have to go to the store before I baked! Out of my laziness I found this gem of a recipe! So good, moist and delicious aspecially because I thought I might have to sacrifice some flavor for not using bakers chocolate, but that was not the case at all! I will say the frosting seemed like it wasnt coming together at first and I added a little milk (maybe a teaspoon) and then just kept mixing it and it was perfect! Might have been fine even without the milk if I would have been more patient! Everyone loved this and it was gone in a day! I will say we cuut the frosting in half because I wasnt filling the cake with it, and it was still too much, but that just meant we had some extra to eat!If you want a cake recipe to keep forever, this is it!

An exceptional chocolate cake that is very moist and delicious.  Storing it in the refrigerator will keep the buttercream frosting at a great consistency.  The cake actually got tastier each day.  I used coffee in place of the water just for a twist, but the recipe as written is amazing!  Very easy to make and none of it went to waste... just to my waist.

the cake was marvelous! i failed to do the icing though cause my cake mixer is broken, and it was quite impossible to stir by hand! will definitely do this again, and hopefully i would have bought a new cake mixer by then and tried the icing as well...

My cake turned out super moist and amazing. It's my favorite from-scratch cake recipe. I substituted the boiling water with coffee,  and put it in a glass 13x9 at 300 for an hour, and added a good amount of mint extract in the mix to give it a chocolate minty flavor.
I'm going to be using this much much much more.

I thought this cake had great flavor, but for some reason i found the texture to be slightly strange. Kind of spongy and elastic. But everyone else seemed to really enjoy it. I really liked the icing. Great flavor, smooth and creamy, but it is not a stiff icing so it would not work for decorating. I think next time I will try a different cake batter with this icing.

An absolutely wonderful recipe! I made it for a going away party for my friend Josh, and I followed the advice of some of the reviewers on here and used a cup of strong hot coffee rather than hot water, which turned out fabulously. I frosted the cake and then decorated it with white frosting designs topped with M&M's. I would just advise people as we're getting into summer months to be super careful when frosting this in a warm room, the frosting started to melt for me and my top layer slid a little bit. I was able to carefully slide it back into place, and then I had it sit in the fridge for a while before I took it out to serve. Amazing recipe, though!

I really liked the recipe for the cake; I didn't make the filling. The batter did look very wet and syrupy, but it came out really most and thick once baked. I made cupcakes and they came out great. They were a nice dark brown color. I topped them with a cream cheese whipped cream (on this website), and it worked well.

This cake is definitely extremely chocolaty. It cooks up really soft, not good for stacking at all. The taste a bit like Betty Crocker, too. The best part is the icing. It's spectacular. I'll definitely be using that recipe again and again.

I wanted a nice moist chocolate cupcake recipe. This is it. It tastes very good and its moist. However, I made these as cupcakes, and I was a little hesitant. I peeked in the oven and saw they were rising like normal cupcakes, so I didn't worry about it. Then, after I took it out, they went flat and in. These are great to put frosting on, but not too attractive by themselves. In addition, I added "instant coffee crystals" to the boiling water, to make mocha cupcakes. They turned out alright, but I suggest adding a cup of plain coffee instead.

It tasted like regular chocolate cake. It was nothing special, and not as moist as some of the reviews seem to suggest. I fudged on the frosting, it tasted way too sweet. So I scrapped it and made a vanilla frosting.

This is the BEST chocolate cake i've ever made and trust me, i have made A LOT! I think the boiling water makes all the difference, it mades the cake so much moist! Instead of makin the frosting that was proposed, i made a simple melted chocolate and heavy cream frosting, it was DELICIOUS!!

This recipe is simply awesome!!!   The cakes came out super moist and not too sweet.  I used half the ingredients to make one batch of cupcakes for my 4 year old.  I filled each cup to about 3/4 full, baked at 350 degree for 15-18 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean.  Makes a perfect dozen.  They puffed up very nicely, and still very moist the next day.  They're as good as, if not better, than some bakery cupcakes.  I did not make the frosting this time, will try it next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

The best chocolate cake recipe I have ever made or tasted. Rich, moist, chocolate, not too sweet- amazing! I've made it with the Pioneer Woman's mocha frosting and with peanut butter frosting from this site, both were incredible. Highly recommend this recipe!!

I made this exactly as it said and it turned out awesome! Very rich and moist. The batter was runny but it cooks up fine! This made a bunch of frosting I had some left over which my kids used on graham crakers!

Why haven't I discovered this recipe until now??  One of the best chocolate cake recipes!  The only thing I did differently was to use coffee instead of water and add a handful of chocolate chips.  I made it in a 9x13 pan and topped the cake with 1/4 of the frosting.  Will def. make again.

I love this recipe! It's easy to follow and makes a delicious cake. It's super moist. I learned the hard way not to stack it to high or it will fall, but a couple of layers is ok. This seriously is my favorite chocolate cake recipe! You will love it!

The cake is delicious and was very easy to make. It is about a million times better than a box cake. I will use this recipe again. The frosting tasted great, but was WAY to stiff. I couldn't spread it at all. It was the consistancy of playdough. My kids and I made little flat circles with it and just covered the cake with the frosting like shingles. It was actually pretty cute.

This recipe is GREAT! I made cupcakes instead of a layer cake and they turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe as written and while the batter is VERY watery, it bakes up just fine. I did not fill cups as full as I normally would, based on other reviews but could have as they were small since they did not raise much (meaning they would not have run over like others were saying). I baked at 350 for 12 minutes and they came out perfectly. DO NOT use Pam for pans, grease and flour as stated in recipe. I halved the frosting and still had quite a bit left over. I am making another batch today, they are that good. Thanks! :)

WOW! Really Yummy! The cake came out moist, and the frosting is definitely one of  the best frostings ever! I added a spoonful of creamcheese, and it gave it a slightly creamier taste BUT it was delicious without the creamcheese too! Thank You!

Very good but this true to it's name it's EXTREMELY chocolatey! My sister is a huge chocolate fan and she LOVED it. I halved the recipe and made too little cakes and iced them. Rich, chocolatey goodness. Try it and eat it and don't regret it!

I made this cake with a seven minute frosting; it turned out great and looked beautiful. I think next time I will reduce the amount of salt or leave it out. I didn't cut the cakes in half horizontally because I thought they were too thin.

AMAZING!!! The best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I was a little skeptical about the icing, but it goes perfectly with the cake. I however halved the icing recipe and didn't use all the cocoa powder or the milk. I only halved it because I don't like a lot of icing on my cake. Half the recipe makes the perfect amount. I also recommend sifting all the dry ingredients. For the cake and icing. I didn't and  my icing had lumps. Still good, but next time I'll sift. All in all an amazing cake.

The batter honestly feaked me out since it was verrrrry liquidy.. BUT as the other reveiws said, it turned out to b a normal cake with amazingly dark color. However it was breaking alot. Infact even after leaving it for an hour to cool down it still broke. The texture was nice n moist but the flavor was NOT chocolaty at all. I guess I ll add some dark chocolate next time.Also I wonder if anybody noticed that the sides n edges hardened alot as compared to the regular cake...

I have always been scared to make a homemade chocolate cake.  This one was easy and delicious.  My picky husband said it was the best cake he ever had.  I would definitely recommend.  Very easy to make.  I did not slice each layer in half...just stacked normally.  Frosting made way more than needed.  Next time I will split frosting recipe in half.  Yummy!!

This cake was tasty but mine turned out very dense.  I had to add more milk to soften the buttercream and it was still very thick.  My cake also was very heavy and not as moist as I expected.

I don't know what I did to this cake, but I totally ruined it! Both layers broke in the pan.   Both cake and frosting tasted great all thrown in a bowl though! I'll definitely try this one again. Maybe I'll let them cool more before flipping them out of the pans.

Best chocolate cake I've ever baked or eaten. I used the hot water but next time will use the coffee instead as recommended by other reviewers. I made a double batch in 1 bowl to make 3 nine inch cakes. I then used a peanut butter frosting to ice for my Dads birthday. Everyone loved it. It was chocolatey and moist. I even made a few cupcakes with the leftover batter I had. Equally as delicious. I've found my go to chocolate cake recipe and won't need to look any further!

I made this cake for a relative's birthday, and he and his family absolutely loved it! I had a small piece, and I must say that it was very moist and delicious! I followed to the tee, and it came out perfectly, however, I used store-bought frosting for the cake. I highly recommend this recipe to the chocolate lovers out there!!

Delicious!  The whole family enjoyed this soup.  I cooked as directed except added about 1/2 Cup of  colby-jack cheese.  I will definitely make this again and possibly save some of the bacon for a topping. Yum!

This cake was really great! If you are a chocolate lover, this is definitely the cake for you! My cakes came out a bit "domey" as some of the other reviews, so I just cute a little from the top to make it flat. It turned out great! Thanks!

This cake was fantastic.  I followed the instructions exactly and made it into 4 layers.  The only thing I did different was not using as much oil.  I did a test run the day before using cake flour and the full amount of oil but it refused to come out of the pan.  The next day I used regular all purpose flour and slightly less oil and it came out of the pan.  Baking time definitely seems to be off as it took a lot longer than I anticipated and had many holes poked in it from testing.  Good thing frosting covered that up.  My husband drenched his pieces in Hazelnut coffee for breakfast and inhaled the whole cake in a matter of a couple days!

cake was pretty good, a little bland, added more cocoa. and while it was good it came out so ugly! sort of bubbly in the middle and then crusted over. this cake isn't good if you're susie homemaker who loves beautiful cakes. i'm not very experienced yet, but i've made much better cakes before. not my favorite recipe.  the frosting: i added 1/3 more butter and a little more milk because without it the frosting was gritty and bitter.

Excellent cake! Although I made a few alterations. Instead of 1/2C oil, i used melted butter. Also, I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Sounds weird, but makes it that much sweeter!

I didn't get to finish this cake, as it stuck to the pans horribly despite greasing and flouring the pans well beforehand.  We ate a few of the crumbled pieces to test the flavor and I found it to have way too much cocoa flavor, and tasted quite bitter.  I used a high quality unsweetened cocoa, so I'm not sure what the problem is.  I'll try it again sometime, and hopefully it will come out of the pan.  Will try parchment next time.

I only made the cake portion of this recipe so far and I have to say that it is really tasty.  I always substitute apple sauce for oil but other then that, I changed nothing.  Really moist.  I way super nervous when I added the hot water and the batter became a runny mess but it turned out perfectly.

I needed a cake that would hold up being stacked 8 layers high. (Full not split). This cake literally took the cake. It was dense enough to handle being doweled and baked up beautifully uniform and even. I had no problem with it overflowing, but when I put it in my pans it only filled 1/2 full with 8" rounds so I am wondering if I have deeper pans then average. The butter cream frosting is wonderful ( I omitted the chocolate powder)  and my R2D2 cake is a hit!

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake recipe. I've made it two times, but with different frostings. It comes out perfect everytime and I will definitely be making it a lot more because everyone (including myself) loves it! Very moist and super easy to make, and it's never stuck to my cake pans! Definitely deserves 5+ stars! Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe for cupcakes with a basic buttercream frosting and they turned out AMAZING. Substituted 1 cup hot coffee in lieu of water and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. Yielded about 2 dozen cupcakes (just tossed a bit of extra batter). WONDERFUL. Making it as a 4 layer birthday cake for my FIL tomorrow. Can't wait!

Just used this to win "honorable mention" in my county fair for cupcakes. Thanks RACH56!

I had the same problem as another reviewer with my cakes coming out "dome" shaped. I left it as two layers, and I shouldn't have. I really like the taste of the cake and I'll make it again.   For those who aren't already super experienced bakers, the frosting was a NIGHTMARE. I've never made butter cream and every instruction I found online said "cream butter with sugar" and it was all sorts difficult. Also, it made WAY too much, and I also only used the 3.5 cups of sugar that another reviewer stated. I still found the frosting as only "ok." Next time I'll try the cake with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

The cake and frosting were outstanding! I made cupcakes, and the batter filled 24 cups. When the cupcakes were about half way done baking, I sprinkled some crushed peanut butter cups on top, which sank a little into the batter. They took about 20 minutes to bake. After I frosted the cupcakes, I sprinkled them with some more finely crushed peanut butter cups. Outstanding!

I have no idea what people did wrong to give it less than 3 stars. I followed the instructions, except I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. My cake came out chocolatey, sweet and moist. I made it for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it. I used the Wilton Classic Wonder Mold cake pan in order to make a dinosaur cake and I had no problem releasing the cake from the pan at all. (I am only rating the cake. I did not make the frosting yet).

This receipe will surely satisfy your chocolate fix. Follow the receipe just as described and like previous reviews don't worry about the thin runny batter. Frosting is incredible!

I followed the recipe exact, except for using hot coffee in place of boiling water like someone else suggested. I too was skeptical and almost didnt add all the coffee because the batter started to look unbelievably runny, but I did it anyway. I baked for about 35 minutes in 2-9 inch rounds and it was perfect. I greased the pans generously with bakers joy, and after resting for 10 minutes in the pans, they came out beautifully. The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 was the icing. The cake was perfect, but the icing was grainy. I think it has way too much cocoa powder in it. May just be my personal preference. I will bake the cake many times again, but find a new icing recipe to accompany it.

Amazing! I followed one reviewer's advice and replaced the boiling water with a cup of hot coffee and it only added to the flavour (coffee is like vanilla extract in that way). Don't be afraid of the soupy batter after adding the water/coffee... the cake will cook up just fine and will be beautifully moist when it's finished cooking. I made three 8-inch round layers and topped them with a homemade chocolate buttercream icing. It got rave reviews from everyone at the table, and many went for seconds. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is very good but not your typical dense chocolate cake.  It is extreme chocolate.  Even though this is a 5 star, I have had some others that I like just as well that are more dense.  This didn't overflow for me in oven because I cooked it at 325 for a little longer and put a wet wrap around pan because of my 11 x 15 pan I cooked in.  No problems and came out perfectly.

amazing!!! The cake was absolutely moist! I placed it in a small cake pan, and because I wanted to make to cake I separated the mixture, filled the pan 1/2 full. I shouldn't have because the cake turned out to be too thin, i should have filled the pan 2/3 full. But no big deal. It still turned out great!   I followed the cake recipe, although I realized I hadn't 2 cups of sugar, I substituted honey and it came out alright. I also changed the boiling water to expresso as a reviewer suggested. It was EPIC. :>  The frosting I changed a bit. I encountered a same enough frosting recipe that I have tried, and I felt that it lacked a bit of chocolatety taste. So I changed the milk with chocolate milk and the lessened the sugar. I made too much frosting though, but it tasted awesome! :) THANK YOU RACH56! :D

I've tried out a lot of different chocolate cakes, and I'm usually disappointed. I tried out a different recipe last night, and it turned out nasty and dry. I needed a cake for today, because I wanted to make one for my dad for his birthday. I tried this one, crossing my fingers that it would turn out moist and yummy, and it did! Thanks for a great recipe, I'll make this again for sure!

This is the same recipe as on the back of the Hershey's coco. It is my favorite recipe however, when I started it I thought I was making a new recipe. I realized it at the last moment before adding the boiling water and instead decided to add boiling coffee. Should be interesting!

Fantastic! I tripled this recipe and made a 4 layer 9" round and a 9x13. I only had to double the frosting, since the 9x13 was only one layer. The batter is super thin and it baked much longer than 35 minutes (maybe 45 for the rounds and 60 min. for the 9x13, until a toothpick came out clean) in my convection oven, but the results are great. It was rich, moist, and super chocolaty. Several people asked for the recipe.

PERFECT!!! I operate a bakery out of my home and decided to try this for a shaped cake for a party yesterday. I was a little concerned at how thin  the batter was putting it into the pan, but it came out just perfect!! So moist and held the second tier great! I did have to do a crumb coating before the final icing, but its soooo worth it. Everyone at the party said it was the best theyve had.

This cake has turned out great! I just started searching for a chocolate cake recipe to make for my daughter's second birthday in a week and I wanted to try it out before party day. This is definitely the cake I'm making! It turned out fantastic. I love the frosting as well (although I only had 4 cups of confectioners sugar, the consistency still turned out fine and it tastes great) I'll probably use a pink cream cheese frosting for the party :) Thanks for the recipe! Definitely added to my "box"!

This recipe was awesome - rich and moist and loved by all.  I put in an extra 1/4 cup cocoa in the batter to make it even more extreme.  I'm making it again today for some other people, it was so good.

I was disappointed by the way this cake turned out. The boiling water made the batter very runny and it did not set up well. I also used my own buttercream recipe because this one was way too sweet. I would not recommend this recipe.

Very good chocolate cake! My only question is..what is the significance of adding the water? Before the water was added it had a very nice consistency and an AMAZING flavor! I had never tasted a better cake batter before..I swear I could have eaten it just like that. But after the water it seemed extremely runny and the flavor was extremely diminished...

While the cake itself is really good--it's the buttercream that's my favorite.  It's fantastic!  and soo easy to whip up.  I use it for everything calling for chocolate frosting.  You can't go wrong with it.

Tried making cupcakes with this recipe. Followed it exactly as written. Each cupcake over flowed as others had written their cake pans did. Second tray I only filled 1/2 way instead of the usual 2/3 full. Still had the over flow problem. Too much time trimming edges and a mess to have as a favorite chocolate cake recipe.

This cake came out great!!! It was moist but not falling apart. The batter was very "watery" but baked up perfectly. I had an odd issue with one cake baking faster then the other. It very well could have been an issue with my oven. The frosting I found to be a little daunting to make because I do not have a stand mixer. Thats A LOT of 10X sugar to beat up and I think I might even up the vanilla a tad, maybe an additional 1/4 tsp. or possibly a little more cocoa powder. To me it seemed to taste an awful lot like the 10X sugar more then anything. Ill have to tinker with it some. It didn't bother anyone else. The cake disappeared very quickly. Small slices are highly recommended!! And taste fantastic the days after baking!!

Just amazing. People kept asking what kind of chocolate I added for the cake to be so dark. I have done this recipe twice and people just go crazy with it. Today was the second time and I doubled the recipe. There was nothing left!!!! This is truly a great recipe because of the great taste and consistency, the easiness and the lightness (the batter doesn't have any margarine/butter). I added coffee instead of boiling water. 5 stars very well earned.

This cake is fantastic.  I've made it as written, and I've also just made the cake and added cream cheese frosting rather than the chocolate frosting of the recipe.  Both are phenomenal.  I make 3 9" layers, baking for between 20 and 25 minutes, taking them out as soon as a toothpick comes out clean.  I will never make a different chocolate cake again!

Excellent! Makes a huge amount of icing.  Would have plenty with a half or three quarter batch of the icing.  Very moist and delicious.

Wow!  A chocolate lovers dream.  This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe.  I make three layers with three cake pans because I can't cut straight.  Other than that, no changes.  A great birthday cake!

OMG I cannot believe how excellent this cake is, moist, chocolaty the best I have ever had. Made frosting with only 3 cups of powdered sugar and extra milk. I could have eaten the whole bowl. Well worth the cheat from my diet!!!!

This is the genuine article!  As suggested by Allermom, baked in a 13x9 pan for almost 40 minutes.  Used only half the amounts for icing because it was one layer.  Yummy and rich.

This is one of the best cakes and icings I have ever made or tasted. This says a lot about a cake, because I am super picky about my cake. Loved it and will be making again and again.

I've made it twice and neither time did it rise.  I bought some knew baking powder before I knew the trick to "testing" it.  I would love to make this cake and it come out fluffy.  My cake tasted wonderful just dense and flat.  I chocolate box cake just doesn't taste the same as this one.  The chocolate satisfaction is not in the box mixes.  I can rate this cake a 3 based on the chocolate fix you get when you eat it.  Until I make a fluffy one following the directions perfectly it will stay a 3.

I am having a hard time finding the words to describe how much we loved this cake. If I could give it ten stars then I would rate it an 11. I for one am not a huge fan of cake mixes. They always have "the taste". I can detect it a mile away. BUT- cake mixes are great because they are always moist. This wonderful cake was the ONLY chocolate cake recipe that I have made that achieved perfect, perfect moistness. It was perfectly chocolatey, yummy and moist. I will never look around for another chocolate cake recipe again. I have eaten three pieces tonight already and I promised I would stop at one!! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

The cake part was excellent but the frosting was way too sweet even though I used about a cup and a half less confectioner's sugar than required.  I will reuse the cake recipe but next time will use my recipe for milk chocolate frosting.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I had another recipe I used before but it tended to be hit or miss.  This was perfect the first time.  Very moist and the icing is awesome. It was also very simple to make.  The only change I made was I didn't cut the layers in half.  It was more than fine without it but I did have a good bit of icing left over.

I made this cake for my wife, she was mad at me for an entire week because she couldn't resist it.  It's much better than box cake, and for all the guys out there, making a cake for your wife that is not "boxed" gets you lots of brownie points! :)

WOW this cake is so good! But let me explain why I only gave it 4 stars. I followed the directions exactly and then put the batter in two 9 inch cake pans and baked. When I pulled them out both cakes had run over terribly and both cakes fell. It was a complete mess and all of the ingredients had been wasted. After reading all of the reviews I just couldn't believe that no one else had this problem, as I followed the directions exactly. I'm sure the cakes fell b/c there was too much batter in each pan, but that's what the directions said to do, so that's what I did. Anyway, I decided to try it again, b/c I was making it for my husband's bday and I really wanted to make him a cake. So instead I put the batter in a bunt pan and halfed the frosting. The cake was amazing!! And so moist, but VERY rich! Will make again, but only in a bunt pan. Thank you!

This cake is sooooo good!  The frosting is amazing and I loved the richness/moistness of the cake.  It's just like a chocolate layer cake you would get from a restaurant.  I'll definitely be making this often for parties.

This is a very good chocolate cake, easy to make and came out very moist. I love chocolate and thought it didn't have enough chocolate taste so next time I may add more cocoa. I frosted this with Peanut Butter Frosting which was excellent; tasted like a Reese's cup.

I changed the yield to 18 servings to make three nine-inch layers.  Batter didn't overflow the pans.  I ended up with three layers of perfect chocolate cake.

This cake tasted really good! However, it stuck really bad in my cake pans. I used non-stick cake pans and I only greased them (didn't flour them) so perhaps it was my fault the cakes stuck in the pans, but I'm afraid to try this recipe again for fear that they'll stick again-even if I grease AND flour my pans. I made the cake as written and used a whipped cream/cocoa frosting-it was so light and fluffy! :) Overall, this cake was tasty, just the fact that it stuck really bad in the pans makes this recipe rated only a 2. :(

This was quite good but nothing great. I bake without frosting and found that this was not as good as "black chocolate cake" on this website. I did up the cocoa to 1 c and I put a tsp of coffee powder in the boiling water. I like that it took about only 10 mins to mix up. NOTE - Do not use a springform tin to bake this - I did and some of the batter leaked right out!

This recipe is virtually foolproof.  The end result was a nice velvety crumb, that stood up neatly to slicing into layers.  Make sure not to over bake for a moister cake.

The cake was incredibly moist and fluffy. It was half gone the next day. I added coffee instead of boiling water, it was great! Husband loved it!

GREAT TASTING CAKE... THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS THAT I USED A CUP OF STRONG COFFEE IN PLACE OF THE BOILING WATER!! THAT REALLY BRINGS OUT THE FLAVOR OF CHOCOLATE AND YOU DON'T TASTE COFFEE, I ONLY CHOSE 4 STARS WAS BECAUSE THE CAKE IS VERY CRUMBLY AND I USED IT FOR A SCULPTED CAKE!

I made this cake into a barbie princess cake and everybody thought it was delicious!! I made the cake and buttercream on the tuesday, froze it overnight, then iced it (for the skirt of the barbie) on thursday and it was still incredibly moist and fresh for saturday's party! The only change I made was halved the amount of icing sugar for the buttercream icing. It just didn't need so much. Thanks - shall definitely make again!!

I made this for my mothers birthday and the whole family loved it!! Chocolate Cake and Chocolate Icing is my favourite dessert of all time and this is the best cake and icing I have ever made! I like frosting to have flavour not just sugar.  This is a perfect blend of butter/chocolate/sugar flavour.

This is the best chocolat cake. I made a change by making a chocolate mousse for the icing... It helped to even out the heaviness of the cake wth light fluffiness of the mousse.... try it ..., then on top I put cherry filling It looks just as impressive as something you would by in a store.

this cake is superb. i am baking this cake in a 18x10 dish. i just put second layer of my cake into oven. and i was hardly able to stop my self from keep on "trimming the sides" of the first one.  even without any frosting, its superb. i did not have baking soda so i used 3 teaspoons of baking powder. still it came out great. though next time i sure will try it with baking soda and check the difference.

WOW! What a rich cake! I admit, adding the boiling water had me concerned but this cake is excellent.  I did not half the layers and simply made a 2 layer cake. And b/c I was short on butter, in the icing I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/4 cup butter. This is an excellent cake overall. Very moist. The icing was "workable" and I was even able to put some into an icing bag to create borders. I will keep this icing recipe to use for other things also. The name "Extreme Chocolate Cake" fits this recipe!!!

Wow, this cake is amazing! It's moist, tasty, and not so hard to make. My advice to bakers...get an electric mixer. I didn't and have sore arms because of it. But, it was worth it.

OMG...so good!!!  The frosting is TO DIE FOR!!!  I did do cake flour instead of all purpose and didn't use quite all of the boiling water, cause the batter was starting to get really thin as I was adding it.  This was the perfect cake for my chocolate fanatic husband's b-day!  Thanks!!!  UPDATE:  Made this again but into cupcakes!  Works perfect and this time I went ahead and used all the boiling water which made this even better (more moist) than the first time, so don't be afraid of the thin batter!

The cake is very good.  Just as easy as opening a cake mix and the ingredients are most always avaliable in any kitchen.  Loved the ease of mixing this cake also. Can recommend this to anyone who wants good chocolate cake. I did not make the frosting given.  I used a mocha cream frosting.  Made a very elegant looking cake

AMAZING!!!!!! Made this tonight, followed recipe exactly and it turned out PERFECT!!! made the frosting, but only enough to ice between the 2 layers, I am not good at cutting the cakes in half lol, made the pro ganache for outer frosting and added a small tub of cool whip to it to make it more fluffy and cut the sweet on it a little, was a wonderful combination!! Thank you SO much for this recipe, I will definately make this again

The cake recipe was perfect!  I used 1 C of coffee instead of hot water, but did everything else as directed and it turned out FANTASTIC!  I only gave it four stars because of the frosting... it was OK but it really didn't seem to do this cake justice.

This cake is absolutely delicious - moist and chocolatey.  Just the way I wanted a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting to taste, without being over the top.  My sister and I made this with our kids (ages 6 and 2), and it was so easy to throw everything in the Kitchenaid and let it do the mixing.  I loved that I didn't need a bunch of separate bowls.  The batter was very thin, but the cake layers cooked perfectly.  I just left the two layers intact.  The cake was very crumbly, and presented some challenges to me when I was icing it.  So, it wasn't the most lovely cake I've ever seen, but it was delicious.  I'm keeping this one as my "go to" chocolate cake recipe, unless I can find something just as yummy that doesn't crumble.

Very good tasting cake, quite moist and dense. The batter is super runny, and at most about 1 1/2 inches deep after rising during baking. You'll definitely have to layer it. I did not try the frosting.

Great texture, flavor, and moist, but light cake!  I used egg substitute with no problem, and frosted with peanut butter buttercream frosting--2/3c peanut butter, 8 Tbsp butter, and 3/4c confection. sugar.  Also baked at 325, which added a bit additional cook time, but with great results.

I like the cake, but the icing ruined the flavor.  I wonder if the people complaining about there being too much batter are using 8" pans instead of 9".  I used 9" and there was a perfect amount of batter for both pans.  I'll be making the cake again, sans icing.  Thanks, Rach.  :)

Fabulous cake! the cake portion of the recipe is spot on! great texture, great taste! I did make one change. I boiled the water and then let it sit for about 5 minutes before I added it to the mixture.  As for the icing; I changed the recipe to: 1 cup real butter, softened; 3/4 cups unsweetened cocoa powder; 5 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, 2/3 cups milk, 1 tsp vanilla. the original amount of cocoa powder seemed to much to me, so I added it a bit at a time until I liked the taste, which was about 3/4 cups. Also, I prefer a creamier buttercream so I upped the butter. Thank you for a great recipe. My family and neighbors loved it!

I am re-reviewing this after many, many, many times making this cake.  The batter looks perfect until you add the water - then it turns into a soupy mess and you may be afraid you've ruined it, but stick with it because this is the best chocolate cake ever!  This cake is moist and crumby and the frosting is like an airy, whipped chocolate mousse.  My favorite alteration is to use 1t peppermint extract/1t vanilla extract and top with mint icing and chocolate ganache.  To die for!

Absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe to a "T" but I cut it in half. I'm notorius for making dry cakes, no more! It was delicious. The icing was excellent too. Thank you so much for sharing!

If you are looking for the perfect moist and easy to prepare cake look no further!  Ingredients were ones that I had on hand and it came together quickly.  I did substitute 1 cup of coffee for the 1 cup of water bc of personal preference but this is just a common flavor variation.  As others have said do not be alarmed by how watery the mixture is after adding the liquid...it does turn out!  I baked this in 3x 9" pans and was impressed with how big, light and fluffy this cake was!  Gone in a mere 24 hours!  Straight to my favorites for sure!   I think I will add some raspberry flavoring to the frosting next time...

I thought this cake was a disaster.  The cake didn't rise as expected, so I couldn't make 4 layers out of it.  When I tried to take it out of the pans, they stuck horribly to the bottom, creating a huge crumbled mess.  I 'patched' it together with the frosting which turned out very grainy & way too sweet.  I was about to throw it out but my picky 24 yr old son wanted to try a piece. He carried on so much about it, it was almost funny.  He said his stomach said, "what heavenly food stuff did you just feed me?"  He said it was THE BEST cake he had ever eaten & he questioned whether I had actually baked it or really bought it.  He couldn't stop eating it & asked that I make it on a regular basis.   Go figure......maybe I'll give it another shot.  4 stars for winning over my very critical son.

Beautiful!  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and cream instead of milk -- simply because that's what I had in the house.  I also used coffee instead of plain water, and I made a chocolate glaze instead of frosting. This cake was rich, chocolatey, and moist! Loved it!

I bake cakes to sell for special occasions.  I baked this for a lady's birthday.  I baked it in 2, 9" square pans.  Instead of the frosting, I made ganache and poured in between the layers and over the top, then made chocolate rectangles and put them around the two layers, for a "basket" look, then filled the top full of dark and white dipped chocolate strawberries, and tied a ribbon around the "basket" to look pretty.  I had wonderful comments about it.  The cake was very moist.   It can even be eaten without any icing or ganache and taste great.

Super sweet and rich. The center of my cake fell and I'm not sure why. I need to keep practicing. It's very moist and more dense then a boxed cake mix.

I m actually surprised that this recipe has received such great reviews. i followed everything to a T and it turned out not so great. The frosting was WAY too sweet. The cake tasted too floury. I am not even sure I want to try to make it again.

This is the best chocolate cake ever!  It was so easy to make and tastes great! I was a bit worried with how soupy it got after adding the water, but it turned out fine. Remember to mix the batter for the full 3 minutes, it makes it lighter.

absolutely hands down evil piece of weaponry a calorie counting person like myself has ever faced. This is absolutely my mortal enemy. I cannot rave about how much I love love love this cake. This recipe just the way it is, is awesome! I used a different buttercream frosting though.... I used 2 Cups butter, 9 cups of powdered sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla, 2 1/4 Cup of unsweetened cocoa and 1 cup milk and it gave me soooooo much frosting which I love love love. That and if you want an even chocolate-tier

I made this recipe for a party of 50 for the first time.I was a bit worried when I poured the boiling water and the batter turned out so runny.I baked it as written in the procedure and was surprise how it turned out.It was a sure hit especially when I made a mocha mousse as filling instead of the butter filling in the recipe.

I made this cake for thanksgiving, amazing. It was the only thing that wasn't leftover. I only used two baking pans, it didn't go over but look close. Next time I will use three. Batter waterly compared to my usual betty cocker. It was easy, I will use again when I'm in the baking mood. Too much icing, I frosted three cakes and still can get at least one more

Fudgey delicious!! I made this for Thanksgiving dessert.  I've tried many chocolate cake recipes; this is the best yet.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made the frosting with 1/3 cup half-and-half and 1/3 cup of 1% milk (what I had on hand).  I did have to add a few more tablespoons of milk than the recipe called for.  I always make my own frosting, can't stand the stuff in a can, and I'll definitely use this on my white cakes also.   I suggest trimming off the outer edge of the layers before frosting (easier if you first put it in the freezer for a short while).  I only had a sliver of a piece as some of the relatives (husband included) wanted a second helping..forget about the pumpkin pie!  I've already been asked to bring this to my sister-in-law's at Christmas.

Excellent!!!  Very moist.  I was worried about the soupy consistency, but it turned out perfect.  Very moist.  The frosting was perfect.  I did have a hard time splitting the cake into layers, so I just used two layer.  Still wonderful.  Everyone ate it up fast.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used Hershey Special Dark Cocoa. The cake is brown but does not have a chocolate flavor at all and the great part is that the cake is not super sweet. It is very moist but not chocolatey enough and I used coffee to add depth. Made a four layer cake and I added chocolate mousse in between the layer which incread the chocolate flavor of the overall cake. I would definitely make again.

I made this exactly as written. PERFECT!! It makes a very good cake. The batter scared me as it was SO thin but it all turned out in the end, then disappeared. I used canned frosting, I would not do that again, it did not do this cake justice. I will definitely be making this cake AND the frosting again.  As for the person who used melted butter - NEVER use melted butter, it has to be solid or use oil.

I made this cake twice! It boiled over the pans both times.  Only one cake would even come out of the pan.  The frosting was super delish & I will definately use it again, but the cake was a miss!!  The mess out the pan tasted great, but looked terrible.

THE BEST chocolate cake in the world.  End of story.  Family constantly demands that I make it again, starting two seconds after they finished off the last piece. Would be 10 stars with a fudge frosting.

Join the gym if you make this cake as you cant stop eating it, as i normally dont like chocolate cake as i find them too dry, Made a 16'' cake & it lasted 2 days. followed the recipe to the T. I filled mine with eclair cream. I didnt make the frosting as I still havent found a frosting i like unless it is cream cheese , most are too sweet. Anyone have a good recipe for frosting pass it on please:) But you will never be disappointed on this chocolate cake unless your on a diet:) I am now after eating the entire cake:) YUM YUM YUM.

I am a true chocoholic and this cake was absolutely amazing!! I followed the instructions to a T and was impressed by how soft, moist and chocolately it was. I was a little sceptical as far as the boiling water and the resulting batter consistency were concerned but both cake and cupcakes ( this recipe makes 36 cupcakes!!!) came out wonderfully! I have made it three times within the last week and will be making again tomorrow! Yum, yum, yum!!

I'm not a huge cake eater, but this was one of the best I've tasted.  Not only did it stay moist, but it had a great texture and flavor.  It is very, very rich so a little goes a long way.

I followed the recipe exactly for the cake part and it turned out AMAZING. I was apprehensive of the boiling water stage but it's delicious and everyone is raving about it. I didn't have enough butter to make the butter cream so I just made a different kind of fudge-y icing and that worked well with the cake.

Great receipe. I didn't cut this into 4 layers, so I cut the icing recipe almost in half and it turned out great. Cake was very moist.

I was really worried about it due to the thinness of the batter after adding the boiling water. However after baking it I have found this is the best ever cake I have ever had. It was so moist. Kids and adults begged for more. My son called it the "Death by Chocolate" cake. A sure fire winner.

I made this cake two days ago, and I'm glad I waited to review it, because it improved with age.  It is not my favorite, but it is very chocolatey and moist.  If I make this again, I think I will use a different frosting.  I think I'd like this with a milk chocolate mousse between the layers and the outside frosted with homemade whipped cream. Update - made again with milk chocolate mousse in between the layers and homemade whipped cream on the top and sides.  I didn't take the time to do chocolate curls on top, but next time I will. Wait a day to serve this cake. It really improves with age. With the mousse filling, it deserves five stars in my book.

I loved this recipe! I made it for my cousins 8th birthday and she loved it and she doesnt normally like cake. One thing I found helpful was adding a tiny bit of cinnamon and then when I frodsted it I did a crumb layer (a thin coat of frosting used to gather cake crumbs) and then froze it and then did another layer of thicker frosting. This cake also tastes really good with cream cheese frosting. Thanks for the great recipe! :]

This is the same recipe I use that was handed down from my grandmother.  It actually originated on the back of a Hershey's cocoa powder can.  I make this for all special occasions to rave reviews!

Without a doubt, the most amazing chocolate cake I have ever eaten (which, trust me is saying something.)  It was wonderfuly moist, and the icing was a perfect consistency.  Five stars are not enough.

Cake was outstanding!  Made 4 8" layers and baked 20 minutes.  As per other reviews I made the cake the night before.  I used this frosting and it was good but maybe a little sweet.  I make a better buttercream from an old family recipe.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday, and it turned out perfect.  I used half oil (1/4 C) and half applesauce (1/4 C), and used soy milk instead of the milk to keep it non-dairy.  Instead of the frosting, I whipped up a container of whipping cream and added a few drops of red food coloring to make pink frosting.  I only made 2 layers, but it was perfect.

I like this recipe, it is low in fat, and big in Chocolate taste!  I used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil for extra moisture and lower fat.  Instead of a cup of boiling water, I used 1/2 c of hot coffee from my morning coffee!  I came out really great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I, too, used freshly brewed coffee instead of water, but the best tip I have for this cake is to make it a couple of days ahead before serving.  It tastes sooo much better!  I didn't use the buttercream frosting; opting instead to use a chocolate kahlua frosting.  Very rich, very decadent. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This is the same recipe that is on the can. It is a good cake, diffently not overly sweet. That was good because I had such a sweet frosting and a mousse center. I'll make again. I used three 8" cake pans. It took about the same amount of time to cook.

This is an excellent recipe. The cake came out so moist and was probably the most moist chocolate cake I had made or tasted. I followed the cake recipe exactly and I didn't experience any spillage. However I did cut the frosting by half and had exactly enough for the cake. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent crumb and texture.  Very rich chocolately taste.  I was skeptical because of how thin the batter was, but it was perfect.  I frosted with eggnog frosting on the top.  Delicious.

Oh my what a cake! I'm a big fan of chocolate cake and this is by far the best I have ever made! I have made it several times now, and it comes out perfect every time. It's best eaten 2-3 day's after baking, then it tastes really moist, like chocolate brownies. I also add 100g of choc chips to the recipe. I'll never bake another choc cake again!

Very good cake...VERY chocolatey. The frosting is wonderful, but I might try it with a cream cheese frosting the next time around...just to break up the chocolate.

This cake is awesome!  My husband who is not a big chocolate cake person cleaned his plate.  It was very moist and not to sweet.

This cake is awesome! Very moist and chocolatey. I was kind of scared to bake it when I saw how thin the batter was after adding the boiling water, but it came out just fine. I used a different icing, but will be trying the one mentioned in this recipe next time. I especially like this for cakes baked in shaped pans, because the texture is kind of dense and it holds its shape well.

Ok, so like everything...i completely alter the recipe.  I made my own icing.  I subbed some wheat flour and whey protein for the regular flour and some Xylitol for sugar.  All of these subs and still a rockin' chocolate cake....yummy!

this recipe is the best chocolete cake recipe I have ever used! I put a little bit more milk in the frosting to make it more spreadable. Really Yummy!

Hands down, the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever made.  It was a bit messy the first time I made it but that was just because of my lack of experience icing a layer cake LOL.  I've now made it a couple times and it's been a hit everytime.  The icing recipe makes a very generous amount of frosting, just the way my family likes it!

This was fairly good. What I really liked about it was that it did not require using whole chocolate bars because that tends to get quite messy. The icing was superb but the cake could have used less water. The batter was very thin and took much much more than the mentioned time to cook. The end result was fairly good. I tried making a second batch in cupcake moulds those faster to cook

This was sooo good!  Especially the rich chocolate frosting.  I will make this again, although it is dangerous to have in the house.

Didn't have much chocolate flavor.  I would have been  better off with a boxed recipe.  I was going to bring it to a friend but it's really not good enough to pass on.

This is an excellent cake!  Although I didn't make the chocolate frosting that was provided in the recipe, I thought that the cake turned out very  well.  It was moist and very chocolatey, to the satisfaction of all those who ate it.  I would definitely make this cake again.

The frosting was extremely difficult to spread and I have to agree with some of the other reviews...the boiling water ruined this recipe.

It's very good but I found it to be quite heavy although I like heavy so that's not a problem. It's extremely moise.
