Great dip!  Fun and easy, but not cheap. Have always relied on this recipe as a crowd pleaser. 
For a low-fat version that has just as much flavor, use fat free refried beans, reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat (or 2%) sharp cheddar cheese... don't much care for the flavor of the Mexican cheese blend... it might depend on the brand of cheese.
Hints for making guacamole:  Make sure avacados are dark green and slightly mushy.  Instead of peeling the avacados, it's easier to just cut them in half, pop out the pit, and scoop the flesh out with a spoon.  Go ahead and squeeze the juice of one whole lime onto the avacado... no need to measure it.  
In addition to adding taco seasoning to the sour cream, I also mix some with the refried beans.
I prefer to spread the guacamole first, then the sour cream, since the guac is heavier.  
Lastly, throw on some jalapenos with the other toppings for an extra little kick.

i have made this dip so many times for work, every time we have a "party" its requirement!  sometimes if the tomatoes don't look good in the store, i will substitute those for a layer of salsa, and it tastes excellent too.  i also like mine spicy so i put in extra taco seasoning plus ancho chili powder.  i've even used light sour cream and light cheese and no one knew the wiser!  lastly, i like to buy the chopped olives in the can, they are so easy to use and bite sized...  comes out great every time!!

I have never made a seven layer dip before, so i was a little nervous (it was for a family get together), but everyone loved it. It was so good. My husband isn't too big on dip, but he said he really liked it. I wouldn't change anything with this recipe! Thanks for it, it was a hit!

This is always such a hit! And it is easy to adjust it to personal tastes (guacamole-hater here!). I prefer this recipe to the one I saw that blended cream cheese with the sour cream, I think that's just overdoing it.

We brought this for watching a football game and it was gone by the end.  Very tasty (even when I substituted fat free sour cream), and simple to make!

very very good - I ate 1/2 myself and now I feel a little ill but that's the quantity, not the dip...I added a layer of pickled green chillies and also a layer of salsa, left out the green onions and olives as I didn't have any but it was still great.  Added chopped red onions to the guacamole.

This was great, and so easy!  I prefer to use sliced olives so folks who don't like them can pick them off easily.  Instead of garlic salt, I used 1/2 tsp. plain salt (didn't think garlic flavor went.)  I also omitted the pepper, since the taco seasoning has plenty of spice and flavor.  I used light sour cream the first time I made this, and fat-free sour cream the second time -- both were just fine!  Just a personal preference - I think 1 1/2 cups of cheese is plenty. It's also good if you add a layer of finely chopped lettuce when you add the green onions, just to have extra veggies (but then it becomes an 8-layer dip!). Thanks for the recipe!

This did not go over well at my 'Mexican Theme' party - the only thing I can attribute it to is that I used 'Hot' taco seasoning instead of normal and it was a bit spicy.  This got great reviews online, but only about 1/3 of the dip was eaten...it seems like something was missing to give it a special oomph! like cream cheese or shredded lettuce to add more texture.

This is such a wonderful dip.  I was worried the taco seasoning might be a bit overpowering, but it was perfect.  I serve this dip at our poker nights and everyone LOVES it!  I get creative with the presentation by applying the olives and tomatoes only to certain areas.  This way, picky eaters can  still enjoy the dip.  You can't go wrong with this!

I made this dip for both my niece's birthday party and an oscar party the next day.  It was a hit at both!  I received sooo many compliments!  The only thing I suggest is to add half an 8 ounce package of cream cheese to the avocado mixture and also up the salsa to a 1/2 cup.  Use a hand mixer to blend it and the guacamole turns out creamy and to die for!  Great recipe!

Excellent! We made this for New Year's Eve and enjoyed every bite. I used fresh, crushed garlic in the guacamole (instead of the garlic salt) and omitted the taco seasoning (mixed into the sour cream). It was fun dipping through the layers. (The teen actually sneeked some more during the night ... a guarantee that this is kid friendly!)

This was an amazing dip!!! Wonderful with tortilla chips. I used only 4 teaspoons of taco seasoning because 1 ounce seemed like way too much. It was perfect! We also omitted the salsa and used just cheddar cheese.

This was delicious & got a lot of compliments! I only made a few changes due to what I had on hand & wanted to make it a little healthier...I didn't have fresh cilantro/green onions, but that would've tasted great. 1 whole pkg of taco seasoning would've been too much. i used 1/2. Great w/lime flavored tortilla chips :)

I was nervous at first because I had never made this recipe and was bringing it to a party where this was to be one of the more main appetizers.  I store bought a back up just in case, but in the end didn't need to bring it out because everyone gobbled up this dip and raved about it.  I will definitely be adding this to my list of 'what to bring to parites'!

I made this for a group of guys - who loved it!  The  most time consuming thing was mashing the avocados and making the guacomole - next time I'm just going to buy the guacomole pre-made as the taste is somewhat overshadowed by the other ingredients anyway.

I made lean ground beef, seasoned with one-half of the taco seasoning packet and then mixed it in with the beans before layering.  Turned out pretty good.

This is a favorite whenever I take it to a gathering. It is also very good if pre-made guacamole is used instead of making it from scratch. Sometimes I substitute a little salsa for the roma/plum tomatoes. It is always a hit.

LOVE this dip! It is always a big hit and never any left over! We like it spicy, so I use "Hot" Taco Seasoning and spice up the guacamole a bit. After initial review and several dips later we tried throwing the left overs on chicken fajitas and it was AWESOME!

I loved this recipe.  I have given out six copies of it so far.  I just saw it last week and have made it three times. Once for a b-day party, once for a house warming and once for myself cause I realized that it was so good and I gave it all away.

Hubby is having his annual Super Bowl party as I type. The yelling is kept to a minimum by the bonanza of buffet items available to the guys. This recipe is one of those. It was quick and easy and very very tasty. To make it more satisfying for the guys I add 3/4lb of finely crumbled cooked ground beef and an 8 ounce brick of cream cheese to the refried beans.He's been back to the kitchen twice for refills. I think they really like it, noooo? Thanks for a good one Dinah.

This is a dip I have made many many times...I do make a few changes however.
Depending on my crowd I sometimes delete the quac...I ADD taco meat....lettuce and tomatoe...You will not believe how fast this dip disappears!

Very good.  I make this all the time and it is always received well.  For times sake, I did cheat on the guac. and bought from the grocery store.  Also the guests do not like olives, so I just omitted them.  Make sure that you refridgerate this for a bit before serving...makes the taste just that much better.  Thanks for the post.

Excelent recipe.  Just like my granny brings to the church dinner.  Only suggestion I have is to serve it with scoop-size fritos.  They hold up much better to the heaviness of the dip than a thin tortilla chip.  The tortilla chips usually break when trying th dip.

Excellent, definite party pleaser. I also added a layer shredded lettuce before putting the cheese and tomatoes on top. The guacamole layer was especially good. I added 1/2 a pkg of cream cheese to it also.

Makes GREAT gifts w/ a nice little plate and spreader!!!!  My friends LOVED it for Xmas!!!!!  Thanks Dinah for bringing this one "back to life"!!!!!!

This dip is always a hit!  My husband and I are not tomato fans but we like salsa, so we replace the diced tomatoes with salsa and nobody seems to mind.

Best dip ever!  I don't like sour cream or olives but this was delicious as written.   I made it with Wholly Guacamole just because avocados in the mid west are expensive - turned out so good I almost just ate it with a spoon.  Will definitely make again and again - thanks!

So good.  I make this just about every time I have to bring a dish to work or to a family gathering.  Sometimes I cheat and do a can of Rotel tomatoes if I don't have time to slice tomatoes, and it's still fantastic.  This dish is so easy and it disappears fast!

My family loved this dip! I did add half the taco seasoning to the refried beans and the other half in the sour cream. I made Taco Seasoning I for this. I think though next time it could use a little more of the sour cream layer as it was very thin. I used pico de gallo instead of salsa and again on top instead of chopping tomatoes and green onions. I forgot to buy black olives, but they weren't missed. I did use 3 avocados instead of 2 because I wanted a litle more guacamole. I made this in a pyrex pie plate and it was just right. Excellent recipe. Even though this is called a "dip" we eat this stuff as a meal. Thanks for a great one!

Yummmm....I used 2 regular tomatoes and added some shreadded lettuce... I also omitted the garlic salt as I think taco seasoning is fairly salty already...good thing I did, I think it would have been unbearably salty.

everything I used as the recipe calls for.

Excellent

We love this - have to have it during Sunday football games.  I usually put a little shredded lettuce and extra salsa on top with other veggies. That's what's great - you can make it to suit your tastes.

This appetizer is Very good!  I took this appetizer to my brother's for Easter and everyone loved it.  The fresh avocados and cilantro really make it.  It looked like a lot when I put it into a 9x13 pan, but it sure went fast!

Excellent.  Held up very well.  I made it earlier in the day and let it sit in the fridge until the evening and it was wonderful.

This is an awesome dip! First time making it and it was a hit at a potluck :) the seasoning in the sour cream makes it different from the typical dip! It took longer than I thought to put it all together, but super easy!:)

I don't understand the rave reviews.  My family didd not care for this dip.  I took it to work and no one there would eat it either - and I work with all men!    The taco seasoning in the sour cream ruined it, it was completely overpowering.  The picante in the avocados wasn't right either.  I will never make this again.

I was really disappointed by this recipe. My husband loves guac. and Mexican food in general and he said this was "okay." I brought it to a potluck and didn't get any comments on it. It has a very "oniony" taste and not a lot of flavor. Sorry!

This dip is awesome!  I've made it twice and it disappears in an instant!  In the recipe it says you can make it in a 9x13 pan, BUT I have to DOUBLE the recipe for that size pan.  I recommend using a pie pan if you don't double.

Classic party dip and great snack.  I grew up on this as the ubiquitous New Years Eve Dip but haven't made it for years.  The taco seasoning mix in the sour cream is a very nice touch, so don't skimp on that!  My children are having this for dinner tonight, they like it so much.  Thank you!

Very tasty and well received at our Super Bowl Party. Did need to add 2 extra avocados as the cilantro was overpowering. Also thought the taco seasoning was a bit strong in the sour cream layer, but I did make my own (Taco Seasoning I found on this site) so it may be more "potent" than the store bought kind. So I doubled the sour cream, too. I layered it in a 11x7 glass dish and it filled it perfectly.

Delish! For time purposes, I used guac dip from the refrigerator section of the grocery store. I put this out at a relatively small gathering of family and friends. It was GONE and the platter looked like it had been LICKED before I had time to get dinner on the table!

This is an excellent dip.  I added four pieces of crumbled bacon to the refried beans for more flavor. I like it better if you chill it before serving to let the flavors blend together and allow the layers to set up (although this does make it harder on the chips).

The only problem with this recipe is that when I am making it for a party, I always have to make sure I make two. It disappears immediately. My guest always talk about it even days later. Great recipe.

Easy to make and everyone loved it.  I had debated on whether or not to make it because we already has so much food at the Super Bowl party, but I'm glad I did because it was gone in a heart beat!  I am giving it a four because I think the beans should be doubled.  So instead of 16 oz, use 32 oz.  The beans got lost with everything else.  I will definitely make this again but will double the beans.

Truly Outstanding! I am a very self critical cook and 99% of the time think I could have done something different to make it better. Not this time. I assembled it on a large dinner plate and flattened it a little so you could scoop. Looked very pretty and tasted great. I only used 1 T of the lime juice and didn't have quite enough sour cream so used some cream cheese spread with it. Grated my cheddar. Didn't use cilantro; ground coriander instead. Recipe called for a "bunch" of green onions, I used 5 green onions. I recommend a thick sour cream and a sturdy corn chip.

Everyone I make this for raves about it. I do add one jar of mild salsa to the refried beans and cook over low heat prior to placing them in the dish. I do make half with black olives and half without. I love olives, but not everyone does. It is always a big hit!

I make this when I need a quick easy appetizer for a party and don't feel like fussing to much. I like to mix the taco seasoning in the refried beans, and mix ranch dressing into the sour cream. I never have any leftovers of this appetizer when I bring to a party. This is very easy to make lower fat with fat free refried beans and light sour cream and low fat cheese. Avocado is good fat...so it doesn't count.

I made this dip for a staff meeting for work and it was a success!!! I followed the receipe just how it's listed except for two things, i didnt measure my lime juice i personally love lime so i added to my taste and instead of the regular refried beans I added jalapeño refried beans just to give a kick! And it was great! :) thanks for the receipe!!

made this when my brother's friends were coming over and I added a couple more things hoping they would eat less of the little apetizers (and it worked!!) added some bacon bits, mozzarela (1cup + 1cup mexican style cheese). and mixed some cooked ground beef with the refried beans. they loved it

This recipe is always a favorite when I bring it to gatherings. I do use a different recipe though for the guac (which alone is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser by itself!!)- Thank you Dinah!

Excellent seven layer dip recipe. I made this for a football party and it was a success!! I added a little more than an ounce of taco seasoning to the sour cream other than that I followed the recipe as is.

Everyone who tries it loves this dip.  I serve it with large tosada chips and do variations also.  Instead of refried beans I add a small can of corn & can of drained black beans to the tomatoes mixture. I have also used red or yellow onion instead of green onion.

GREAT recipe! Got so many compliments. Definitely will be making this one again. As many reviewers recommended, I used low fat sour cream and low fat cheese. Although, I added a 3 tablespoons of non-fat yogurt to the sour cream mix because it seemed like I needed a bit more sour cream for a full layer in my dish. Still just as flavorful and no one knew the difference. I also chopped some pickled jalapenos and put them as the last layer on 1/2 of the dip so that those who like spicy food could get a little more of a kick. The crowd loved it and said I should have put them on the other half as well. I would definitely recommend it if your crowd likes something a little more spicy!

Wow!  What a wonderful recipe.  The dish was scraped clean at the party I took it to.  The can of refried beans that I used happened to be the spicy kind, and that added some great kick.  Also, the recipe doesn't mention it, but you should seed the tomatoes so that things don't get too runny.

I've made a version of this recipe for years with amazing results, however, I loved the salsa addition. I skipped the cilantro and made my own taco seasoning to control the salt. This stuff is so good, you don't even need chips; just a spoon! Thanks Dinah!!

I made this dip for a superbowl party I was hosting, and to say the least, it was more of a hit than the game! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I made the following changes: 1) I added taco seasoning to the refried beans, heated it over the stove top for about 5 minutes (to get the taco flavoring throughout), and the let cool. I also added seasoning to the sour cream like the recipe said. 2) I added some crushed red peppers to the guacamole to spice it up a bit and 3) I added sliced jalapenos to the top of the dip just for an extra spicy touch. It was a huge success at the party! Will be making it again! Thanks!

We love this recipe!  I made this for a party and it was a hit, then I made a  few modifications next time i made it.  Icut the tomatoes in half and doubled the black olives, I also used red onions instead of green.  My husband and I agreed it was better the second time around!

This was a HUGE hit over the holidays!  When I made it a second time, I doubled the guacamole portion of the recipe, used 6 plum tomatoes and 2 3.25? oz cans of olives--just to beef it up a bit.  (I love guacamole, so I just had to double the recipe  :)  )  I would give this 10 stars if I could--it was absolultely wonderful, and I'm already getting requests for it!  Thank you soooo much!

I made a double recipe of this for coffee hour at church.  I thought perhaps I had overestimated the amount, but  there was only about 2/3 cup of it left, and someone asked to have it to take home!  The only minor change I made was to add some cumin to the guacamole, as I'm a big fan of cumin.    

It was a bit labor-intensive with all the chopping and mixing, so I was hoping the time spent was worth it--and it was.  So much better than store-bought versions!

I thought this was good, and easy enough for my kids (10 and 13) to do with a little supervision. The only thing I would change is doing a layer of salsa instead of tomatoes, as I felt the tomatoes didn't really add anything except color. I will make this again.

My only complaint is that the ingredients spread in the 9x13 dish are very thin compared to the photo.  The photo shows thick layers, but following the ingredient list, it looks nothing like the photo.  If I made again I would either double the quantity or use a smaller dish.

Made it exactly as the recipe said to, It turned out great and got devoured. Probably could have added a bit of heat but we already had a lot of other spicy stuff to eat so it was fine without. I will definitely make it again.

SUPER easy!  This is my go-to dip recipe for parties and family gatherings.  Add as many ingredients and less to your liking.  You can't mess this up!

I have made this twice in the last month.
I made it for Christmas and New Years. Very simple and I love the flavor. It was gone within a 1 1/2 hrs, Only thing I changed was I used 3 avocados.
I made it one with mild and once with medium salsa.
I have noticed a reviewer said it wasn't cheap.
This recipe cost me $12, It was well worth it. try buying this premade in a store, Cant beat it.
Only regret that I do not have any left, LOL
Oh.. try adding shredded lettuce to this dip, it doesn't work
Thank You.

It was gone in about 5 minutes and a guest asked if I had the ingredients to make a second batch. 5 stars for sure. I did add 1 extra avocado to add a little more heft to the guac.

Added a tablespoon cream cheese to guacamole, and lettuce on top.  Excellent!   6/19/16  I now add a layer of salsa on top of beans.  Still a favorite.

My family loved this layered dip!  I was a bit skeptical about mixing taco seasoning with the sour cream but it was very flavorful.  I loved the idea that the guacamole was homemade not from a tub ;)  I followed the recipe instructions exactly except that I used more avocados (as mine were small), sour cream, refried beans, and shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese (instead of the Mexican blend...I like to shred the cheese myself as it seems moister that way).  I'll definitely make this dip again :)

I made this for a Super Bowl party. I am not much of a cook but this was easy and the whole dish was gone before half time! I agree with the other comment about the jalapeños I think that would have added a little something, next time I make this I will definitely add them :)

If you have ever made your own guacamole, or love layering Mexican treats together, this is a great recipe. I have made this a couple of times. The first time I did it by the directions, it was good, but needed a little extra. The second time I made it, I heated the refried beans before putting them in, I used a little extra sour cream with medium taco seasoning, and for the guacamole, I grinded/mashed the avocado, then added cilantro, tomato (salsa with the juice drained works too), pinch of salt, a little lime juice (squeeze a wedge of lime for a fresher taste): it should become a chunky paste. Then on the top layer, I put a very thin layer of non-seasoned sour cream, and topped with tomatoes and cheese (I don't like olives). It is definitely a crowd pleaser, and a great snack for a family movie night.

Just tried it ... I bought the avocados and plum tomatoes on Saturday and waited until they were ripe today! With the perfectly ripened tomatoes and avocadoes, this dish was sensational treat for a snow day (what luck!!). I thought it wasn't too hard to assemble, and I could see this being a crowd pleaser for gatherings.

Thanks to the last reviewer for the great suggestions.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  The only changes I made involved using ready-made guacamole, using extra sour cream and less of the taco seasoning.  (I find packaged seasonings too salty - personal preference.)  I added about a half cup extra low fat sour cream.  But then again, I can't imagine ever complaining that a recipe uses too much sour cream!  I used previous suggestions and added chopped hot pickled jalapenos on top.  Everyone gave it a big thumbs-up!

Great dip thanks!! Took to work for a potluck and everyone was raving. Even people that hated olives and guac were still going back for more. I do recommend the chopped olives because if you hate them, you cannot taste them as much when the chopped oposed to sliced.

I made this dip yesterday for my son's fifth birthday and it was a hit!  Every one loved it and finished one whole pan and half of the other (I adjusted the recipe to feed 30).  I did put my own little twist on it by using Newman's Own Pineapple Salsa instead of regular salsa, I seasoned the refried beans with garlic salt and pepper for more flavor and added an extra amount (1/2 a package more of taco seasoning mix) to the sour cream and it was fantasic.  Thank you for the recipe and I will save it and use it again.

Made this for the family over the weekend served it with tortilla chips.  I put cheese on top of beans first and baked until hot and bubbly, then proceeded with rest of directions adding fresh baby spinach.  Everyone loved it and couldn't wait for seconds.

I gave this five stars because the recipe was simple and easy to follow (which is important to a beginner cook such as myself). It is also the best seven layer dip I've ever had, blowing the store bought stuff out of the water. I made it for a BBQ over the weekend and my guests loved it. I will make this again for sure.

Soooo good. I will be making this again and again. I also used the Taco Seasoning recipe instead of a packaged mix, and this was excellent. It disappeared on the 4th of July!

Great dip! I followed the suggestion of several reviews and mixed 1/2 of the taco seasoning to the beans instead of the sour cream. I prefer my sour cream plain. Came out delicious~

Wonderful! Use ready made guaca-salsa from Trader Joe's and skip a few stips! This doesn't look very pretty in a casserole dish, but if you make it in thin layers on a large platter, it is beautiful and feeds more people!

Seven Layer Dip was great for football playoffs. Everyone loved it.  I added guacamole. I also added the taco seasoning to the sour cream/cream cheese mixture instead of the beans as the recipe suggested.  I used fat free beans, fat free sour cream, and low fat cream cheese and no one could tell at all! Kept it in the fridge overnight and it was even good as leftover with lunch the next day. :) THANKS!

This was your traditional seven layer dip that was popular at the party I had. It does make a lot, so be prepared for that.  I left out the cilantro, but it still came out great. I will make this again! Oh one more thing, I added about 1/2 a cream cheese block (4 oz) to the sour cream and then I microwaved the beans and sour cream mixture a little before adding the rest of the layers. If you do cook it a little though, I would recommend refridgerating the cooked portion before adding the rest of the layers.

I had several family members over for dinner last Saturday evening. Everyone raved about this. The only difference I did was to use purple onion instead of green. Very good! Will make again

This wasn't quite as good as 7-layer dips I have made in the past.  The guacamole mixture didn't taste right, and the mexican cheese blend I used didn't seem to be as flavorful as plain old Cheddar.  That didn't stop my guests from making this dip disappear, tho!  I'll have to do some tweaking on it next time...  Thanks, Dinah!

It was great even though I didn't have the ripest avocados.  Next time I'll make sure to shop better.  I also added diced red onions and jalapenos to the veggies on top.  Very good!

Was a big hit at a bbq last weekend.  But I had to laugh at the number of servings the author says the recipe created.  There were only 15 people at the BBQ, and it was gone in 30 minutes!  I guess if you had a lot of other appetizers, it could go further, but for my crowd, I would say it serves a max of 20 people.

I  am not a big fan of canned refried beans.  So I go to a local taco shop and purchase their refried beans.  I also add more cheese and avocado.  My coworkers love, love, LOVE this recipe and I will be preparing it again for them this week for a potluck!

I made the dip but i used frozed black beans and a pound of seasoned ground beef that I added onion and taco seasonings to. I also hate cilantro because to me, it tastes like soap or pine sol so i added flat leaf parsley instead for color. Another add in was black olives then I added lime zest and cumin to the sour cream.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The fresh cilantro and guacamole is a nice touch.  I added 1lb ground beef and mixed with the refried beans for the bottom layer.  Made it a heartier recipe.
I also added shredded lettuce at time of serving.  Was a heavy dish and all was eaten! Huge hit

Perhaps a suggestion as to the size dish/platter to use to serve this would have been helpful.  I used a 12" oblong platter and the dip was still  about 4" high, way too high to get a taste of everything is one 'dip."

Do not change a single thing!! This was a HUGE hit...the taco seasoning adds a layer of perfection...don't just use plain sour cream! The taco seasoning is a must!!

Great dish! I tried this for cinco de mayo! I love a good Mexican meal. I opted to add a little protein. I added a layer of ground beef making it an 8 layer dip!! I also nixed the olives as the kids would have picked them out anyways! What can I say picky eaters! I can say say this was a hit! My husband even liked it! I’ll definitly be adding this one to the rotation! Thanks allrecipes till next time!

I make this for many gatherings. I use the canned diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of fresh, for extra flavor...and because it's usually a "last minute" kind of dish for me. I occasionally add lettuce to the top, too. Everyone loves it!

I used Bush's spicier refried beans instead of the normal ones, and added a few candied jalapeno's just for a kick.

It was fine - we made it for camping lunches on the beach. I would just use regular sour cream - mixing it with the taco seasoning (which I did ahead of time to let it sit a day or two) wasn't good enough to be worth the extra effort and container to me.

Nice Recipe. I had a few tweaks based on what I had, and the fact that I buy guacamole, I don't make guacamole. I wasn't sure how much I should sub with, so I used the whole package, which turned out to be too much. But it's a great 7 layer base recipe that can be tweaked as needed.

Used fresh garlic, not garlic salt. Added a teaspoon of guacamole mix to the avocado. Used white pepper instead of black pepper.
Tasted great and it was gone by the end of the  party, but I think it needed more salt. My bad, didn't use garlic salt then compensate with kosher salt. I would and will next time NOT MIX the taco seasoning with the sour cream. I will mix it into the re-fried beans and layer the sour cream plain. (It kind of also looks like that in the picture?)

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I did sub black beans (I hand mashed them), and added a layer of chorizo sausage on top of the beans.  I also used two cans of Rotel tomatoes with chilis instead of fresh tomatoes.  This is a keeper!

Great dip!  I like to mix only 1/2 package taco mix with the beans to  keep the sour cream white.  Use good sturdy chips for dipping.

I love it. However , I changed it a bit. 7 layer dip turned into a 6 layer dip. Beans black olives melted Colby jack cheese avocados sour cream nonfat pico de Gallo salsa. I also could have added cooked shredded chicken. But I decided not this time.

It was the dip I was looking for, made one like it a very long time ago and lost the recipe in the divorce..lol. I made this last weekend and it was a huge hit. I did a few things a little bit different though to make it like the old one I loved.. I added 1 tsp of the taco seasoning to the refried bean layer and I also drained the tomatoes once I chopped them so the dip wouldn't get soggy. I made it in the morning and was very happy it wasn't soggy when I served it later that evening. I served it with two types of salsa chips, the plain round ones and the scoops.. Making it again this weekend

This was a huge success.  One of the best ones I have had yet.  I just did not use a whole bunch of green onions about half that and I added a red bell pepper with black refried beans.  Everyone loved it!

This was a hit camping! I added jalapeño juice to the refried black beans and mixed it up and spread it into the dish (it gives it a nice flavor and not so stiff when you scoop it out)... Then I layered jalapeños on top refried beans along with chopped green onions. I didn't have lettuce so I chopped up avocados and made a layer with those. Pretty much used everything else the recipe called for.... Oh I mixed sour cream and cream cheese with taco seasoning that really was good too.... Enjoy everyone! :-)

It is delicious and easy to make.  I made this exact version and one with a thin layer of chorizo on top of the beans for my meat loving friends.  Both were great!!!!  Just remember that chorizo has a very strong taste, so all you need is a very thin layer. I also add chorizo to my stuffed peppers. 1/4 chorizo to 3/4 ground beef.  Then add whatever else you like.  Happy cooking!

I use this recipe all the time and my family loves it! I have one brother who specifically asks for this every time there is a family get together like the Super Bowl. I add one pound of ground beef to it as well and it's delicious! Thank you!

I take this dip to parties and there is never any leftover.  If I don't want to make the guacamole myself , I use prepared guacamole, found in the produce section. Very popular dip and easy to make!

This was really good! I especially love the guacamole recipe. (I added some lemon pepper and garlic pepper) I didn't really measure anything and instead of taco seasoning, I used a little cumin and chili powder in the sour cream. I doubled the refried beans, and added some iceburg lettuce. Yum!

Very yummy.  I went ahead and made guacamole with the avocados and used that for a layer.  The salsa/avocado mix just didn't cut it.  I made this for a party and when I went back for seconds, it was long gone.  Bummer!

I love that this is such a good dip for any time of the year. I altered it a little, but only because I know what I like and don't. Dip is also good to keep around the house with some tortilla chips in case any guests show up. FABULOUS!

This recipe is such a crowd pleaser. I brought it for game night and everyone loved it. I did make a couple of changes- I doubled the sour cream, avacado, and olive amounts. Also, I didn't really measure how much cheese I was putting so that may have been doubled as well. This recipe is incredibly addicting!

I was looking for a recipe to replace an old recipe I can't make anymore because it called for Seven Seas Green Goddess Dressing (which was discontinued).  Anyway, I gave this a try for a Labor Day Party and it was a hugh hit.  It has the basic ingredients from my old recipe.  These blend so well.  The cilantro in this recipe gives it a really nice fresh taste.

Great!  Made it for Christmas and I'm going to make it again this coming weekend!  I accidentally left out a couple of the layers, (cheese and lettuce,) and it was still great!  I'll remember them this weekend!  I think I'll skip the cream cheese and just do sour cream though.  It was a little hard to mix together.  Yum!!!!

This dip is fantastic.  I have made it before but not with guacamole.  The guacamole is the key.  So, SO, So, tasty.  I found it hard to mash the avocados so i used a blender.  It worked well.  This is a keeper!

I used half a pack of taco seasoning and seasoned the beans instead of the sour cream like someone else suggested.

I love this recipe - it is TOO good!  It's my guilty pleasure when the family is having a bad week, (it has been a surprise dinner for a few Friday nights).  Not the healthiest - but oh-so-good!  I have made it four times already and will continue to make this untill the end of my run!  That's for sure!

Everyone loves this dip! The only change I make is to add the taco seasoning to the beans instead of the sour cream and I dont use the whole packet, I use 1/2 to 3/4 of it. Great recipe!

This has been a hit at parties. The homemade guacamole makes the difference. I made one change, I added Mexican fiesta Rotelle to the guac and the dip. It was really good.

I made this exactly as written except for using sliced olives instead of chopped.  Everyone loved it.  Even my husband who doesn't care all that much for beans.  He finished off the leftovers the next day.  Excellent recipe!

I made this for our cinco de mayo party, it was really good and disappeared quickly. I used low fat sour cream to make it a little bit healthier. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo pot-luck lunch at my husband's work, and he said it disappeared in no time. I omitted the cilantro (my husband hates it), I used more like 12 ounces of sour cream and 1½ packages of taco seasoning. I used salso instead of tomatoes, omitted the onions, used maybe 1½ cups of cheese, and omitted the olives (we're out!). Oh, and I used fat-free refried beans. It took maybe 10 minutes to make up! I saved a little sour cream/taco seasoning mixture to use as a dip here at home, we'll pick up some chips today and it's good with pretzels! Thanks for sharing, Dinah!

Loved this! This was my first time making this-it was great! I did change a few minor things: I made my own guacamole: 2 avacados,2 tbsp fresh lime juice & tsp salt and instead of tomatoes I used salsa, I also heated it up before serving to melt the cheese, everyone loved it! I also used lowfat sourcream, you couldn't tell the difference at all. Thanks for posting!

Was very good - I warmed the whole dish in the oven for just a few moments to soften the cheese before serving. Very good. Everyone loved it!

SOOO good!  I left out the olives (my husband doesn't like them), and added a dash of cayenne.  Big hit at our New Year's party!

I made this for a Halloween party. It got rave reviews. On the side I added some Jalapenos for added spice. Will definitely make again

Exactly what I was looking for!  It was a hit at both the Super Bowl party and New Year's party!  Shared the recipe with many already.  I could eat this for dinner, I loved it!

This is exactly what I was looking for when I began hunting for this recipe!!  The guacamole is good on it's own as well.

this dip is amazing, just making the guacamole itself is awesome, i have yet to find anyone that does not like it after they try it.

Fixed this for a Christmas Eve and it was a big hit. Indeed it dissapears a lot faster than putting it together.

I omitted the cilantro because it's not a fav at our house.  However the fresh made guacamole is superbe! Lime really brings out great flavor!  Also left out the taco seasoning didn't have any on hand.  Used freshly made refried pinto beans and fat free sour cream for a lower calorie/fat dip and everyone loved it!  It's one of the best I've had!  Thanks!

I made this for my sister's baby shower and everyone loved it. I did cheat and use store bought guacamole, but that made it much easier to put together the morning of the party.

Loved this dip!  I didn't use the mexican blend cheese, but I'm sure if I had it would have been better!  Also, I didn't need to use 4 roma tomatoes.  2 roma tomatoes covered the top nicely.  But I love tomatoes, so I would have liked it with 4 too.  I just wasn't sure if my guests liked a lot of tomatoes.  So ..  

Will make this over and over again.

Very good version of a great appetizer.  I made this for a houseboat party over the holiday weekend and it disappeared in about 15 minutes!  I cut the avocado into chunks and mixed it with lime juice and seasonings but didn't mash it as I like the chunky texture more.

This dip was very good. For extra flavor,  I used already prepared guacamole instead of plain avocados & refried beans w/green chiles. Yum!
