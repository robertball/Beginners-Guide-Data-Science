I used a milk chocolate cake mix, and I swear to you it merged into something almost completely void of flavor. For some unknown reason, I put it in the fridge overnight.  Tasted amazing cold the next day.  *shrug*

Alright, I HAD to make this cake after all the reviews. However, I wanted to also make it healthier. I used Egg beaters in place of eggs, sugar free pudding (as dark chocolate as I could find), fat free sour cream, and fat free cool whip. Then followed the recipes and remaining ingredients list as originally published.  The end result... AMAZING! I didn't even chill it yet!  The frosting is good if you like ganache or that real semi-sweet taste. If you don't, top it with something else. However, the cake was so moist and good... it doesn't even NEED frosting!

It's good, but it had the definite, unmistakable flavor of a mix. The texture is super moist with a nice, fine crumb. If you want that true, clean chocolate flavor, however, you gotta bite the bullet and make the cake from scratch. It really doesn't even take that much more time than this one does. The glaze/frosting was not too sweet, which we like. It's a glaze if you don't refrigerate it. If you want it to be more spreadable than drizzly, then refrigerate it for 10 minutes or so. If you like mixes and don't mind the artificial taste, then this is a favorable option, I suppose.

I have made this several times and have even made different flavors. The last time I made it I used yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding, and used my own icing and it was amazing! I never use the glaze that they suggest but instead make a homemade icing. I also don't use the chopped up chocolate, I feel that it takes away from the amazing moistness of the cake. No one ever knows that it's a boxed cake mix!

It's a little fluffy and light for me.  I prefer a more dense and richer cake.  But overall this is a good cake.

I have made this cake on at least 4 occassions, mostly for my church group, and it is without a doubt the best chocolate I have ever tasted. I even make the frosting recipe which can be a little overpowering if you are not a chocolate lover , as I am. (;>

Not truly the best ever, it didn't have the rich, moist but still fluffy texture that I wanted. I will try again though!

Wouldn't change a thing! My family and I really loved this recipe, it was very moist and fluffy and a nice alternative to the packaged cake mixes on their own. Very easy to make especially for an inexperienced baker such as myself.   I took the advice of another reviewer and chilled the frosting before spreading it on the cake and it turned out great. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I just made the cake without a different frosting, but it was still great! Moist and a lighter texture than you would think.  I only used about 2/3 cup of sour cream because that's all I had.  Didn't quite have that homemade taste, but was probably better!

This is an awesome cake. I do cheat because of the effort... I add 1 up of mini chocolate chips rather than chopping up the squares. Everything else as is. It was originally for my husband, but by the 2nd or 3rd one, it's now my cake. I call it Death By Chocolate. Truly one reason to keep living! 10/18/09 I tried using a bundt pan and it looks great!

I LOVE THIS CAKE yet i do mine slightly different, I use a milk chocolate cake mix. I also make the frosting out of milk butter cocoa and powdered sugar. I then top the cake with hulled strawberries and drizzle melted semi sweet chocolate across the top! Its incredible!

Everyone thought this cake was great but I didn't make the glaze and used mini morsels instead of the chocolate pieces.  I started with a devil's food mix not just regular chocolate.

This was easy to make but for some reason I do not believe my 5 kids and/or husband will ask for me to make it again. Just not a big hit at my house.

Moistest, most delicious chocolate cake I ever ate.  I used a cup of semi sweet chocolate morsels instead of bar chocolate.  I also used reduced fat sour cream but you couldn't tell the difference. Best chocolate cake ever - better than any scratch cake I've ever made.

My family loves this cake and it really impresses guests yet is simple to make. I follow the recipe as is (or I just coolwhip between the layers).  I'm not sure about using another kind of cake mix as others post: I think what makes the cake is all the different chocolates really compliment each other.  Definately chill it!

I made this cake for my dad's birthday. The only substitution I made was to add chopped up peanut butter cups instead of the chocolate since I was using PB frosting. I made it using 2 8" pans and it was fine, took 35 mins. The batter is VERY thick, like brownie batter. They did puff up in the oven quite a bit but flattened nicely when cooled. Everyone really liked it, it was very moist. Not a lot of fudgey chocolate flavor but that might have been due to competing with the peanut butter. Will definitely make this again, maybe trying a different frosting.

This has been my "go-to" recipe for a rich, moist chocolate cake for the last two years. All my friends and family are always requesting b-day cakes because I do fancy fondant cakes, and I always get rave reviews on this cake w/ a good fudgy buttercream frosting. I've tried a few other recipes along the way, but this is the best by far!

I was searching for a way to jazz up a boxed cake mix, and this was fabulous. I didn't make a chocolate cake and I didn't make the glaze. Rather, I used a cherry chip cake mix, a vanilla pudding mix, 4 eggs, ½ cup sour cream, ½ cup plain yogurt, ½ cup oil, and ½ cup water. I then frosted it with Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting (on this site) and it was awesome for my daughter's fifth birthday. For the cake I made, it was better after it sat for a day: it became more moist and more flavourful than if I'd served it same-day.
