One of my favorite cake recipes! I add 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract to cover any hint of the yellow cake mix flavor. I have made this for many people,and most comment this is the best cake they've ever had! I make a simple glaze with white sugar, warm milk, and a dash of almond extract.

I improved the chocolate flavor by adding 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder and 1 teaspoon of instant coffee to the chocolate half.  It did a better job of bringing out the chocolate and hiding the yellow-cake flavor.  Overall, this makes an excellent and impressive cake!

This cake is so great!! and so moist!!... I made mine with a white cake mix, didnt have yellow.. I also only used 3/4 cup water..I mixed in macadamia nut pieces..I did not use the chocolate syrup at all, instead made a chocolate icing and drizzled it over the cake when it was still warm.. MMmmm!!  Cant wait to make it again for St Patricks Day dinner for dessert!

i frosted this cake with pistachio pudding and whip cream.  the presentation was heavenly.  however, the taste was eh... boring.  i couldn't taste the pistachio in the cake mixture even when i ate it all alone.  the frosting made this cake, and next time i'll just eat the pudding.  --UPDATE-- i tried this again because i needed a "green" cake, but i tweaked it a bit.  i used 1 cup water, 1/3 oil, 3 eggs, 1/4 chocolate syrup and a drizzle of extra chocolate syrup when all the batter was in the bundt pan.  i baked it for 45 minutes, and it was terribly delicious.  the flavors were much more enhanced this time around, and my critic brother ate more than a couple of slices.  now, that's saying a lot.

This cake is awesome, but you MUST use a cup of orange juice in place of the water. It makes the cake more flavorful and moist. It even stays must days afterwards (if it lasts that long)!

i was in a pinch and needed a cake to make with things on hand.  made this cake for my sister's birthday.  it's a very pretty cake that looks quite difficult to make but soooo easy!  my sister and i thought it was too oily and perhaps should be a little sweeter but the lack of sweetness could have been due to the oil.  some other guests could not stop eating it - they thought it was GREAT!   i'd make again in a pinch but would cut back on the oil and replace w/more chocolate syrup.  thanks for sharing this great idea.

Great recipe!! Just like my mom used to make. Very quick and simple and it tastes delicious--especially covered with Cool Whip. My 15 month old daughter loves it too.

My mother made a cake very much like this one when I was a kid. It came out awesome! One word of advice tho, this cake, for some odd reason, it needs to sit for a good day or two before it is moist. When it first comes out of the oven it is a bit dry. I think the pudding mix just has to sit or something. Because by the next day it is so moist and oh so good! So be patient and make it the day before you want to serve it. Well worth the wait.

This is my stand by for the last 30 years whenever I need a quick cake.  So yummy and a great crowd pleaser.  This is especially good for people who do not like frosted cakes.  Just sprinkle with a little powdered sugar and you are good to go.

Nice variation of bundt cake. Used some thinned chocolate frosting and green colored white frosting with almond extract to decorate the cake.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this numerous times for company and it never fails that they ask for the recipe.  We always sprinkle each slice with powdered sugar.

I love this cake, a friend used to make it many years ago.  But I live in Denver and the two times I've attempted it fell in the center.  Does anyone have high altitude suggestions?  This doesn't happen when I make a cake mix with no additions.  Only when the mix is altered.  Thanks!

So good!!!  I used orange juice instead of water.  I used extra chocolate syrup and also some chocolate chips, which made it fudgy without drowning out the pistachio flavor.  I topped it with pistachio pudding and chocolate syrup.  Very moist.  Instead of the cake mix, I use 1 1/2 cups of white flour, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of baking powder, a combination I took from my yellow cake recipe.

Good Cake, very moist.  I frosted mine with pistachio pudding mixed with whipped cream.  I wanted just a little more pistachio flavor to come through.

Very moist cake. Used 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup (becuase I ran out) but it still tasted chocolatey. I baked the cake in a 13x9in. pan for 35 min. instead of using a tube pan.

Great recipe just use 1/4 oil and 1/2 teaspoon of almond oil. I also added 5 drops of green food coloring to pistachio batter. I also placed batter into more of a checkerboard configuration inside bundt pan, instead of just straight color layers, and then I made some zig zag "swirls" through batter.

Have been making this for years and it's great as is.  Snowed in and bored so I took it to a new level.  Add almond extract (always have), substituted melted butter for oil (makes it much richer), and for fun, instead of water, used 1 cup cold coffee.  OMG, coffee gives the cake much more depth.

Very good. Would have liked to taste more chocolate and pistachio flavor instead of the yellow cake mix. I even added more cocoa powder to the recipe for more of a chocolatey taste, but the yellow cake taste came out nonetheless. I poured the easy cake glaze from another recipe on this site and it was delish!

A very moist cake with a fairly subtle pistachio taste...I dusted the top of the cake with powdered sugar.  Yum!
