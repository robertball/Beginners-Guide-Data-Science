Very good!  I left out the extra pasta water, but it was plenty moist.  We didn't have zucchini and can't eat cheese, so I left those out as well.   It was very flavorful even with just salt, pepper and basil.  I threw the pasta and veggies together and let them sit in a covered dish for 30 minutes while we went trick or treating and it was perfect when we got back,  still warm and flavors well blended.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The garbanzo beans smelled really awful and I had to extract all of them from the vegie mixture. Also the vegie mixture was pretty bland and dry.  The noodles were good I couldn't get them to mix into the vegies so I kept them separate.

This was a very pretty dish. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the flavors.  A little salt and pepper did wonders.  I didn't add the broccoli (seemed like it had enough veggies) I also used dried basil and whole wheat pasta. Both seemed to work just fine. Definately a keeper!

This is not only healthy with all the green veggies, it is delicious! I have made it twice now for my family and they really like it. My son adds a little extra feta on his.

This dish is so healthy and delicious.  I used butter to fry up the veggies, and totally drown the finished product in feta... mmmmmmmmm... delicious!

Added about 3 TBSP of pesto, 1/4 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 diced jalapeno, 2 green onions. Good, easy, & nutritious. Without additions, think this would have been rather bland.

Good, not great.  A little bland.  We did try adding chicken broth instead of pasta water and some garlic, but still missing something...

Very good, fresh recipe. Made it to spec the first time minus the garbanzos, but next time I would recommend: cut out the beans, double or triple the basil, add some garlic, steam with chicken broth (alternatively just use diced chicken), and add some black and white pepper to the zucchini, then again with the green onions. Overall, works really well, and I'll certainly make it again!

Absolutely delicious! Everything in this is healthy. I could not find papparadelle pasta so I just cooked whole wheat lasagne noodles and cut them in thirds but I'm sure fettuccine or linguini would have worked well. This is a must try if it is your first time having vegetarian.

Used canned black beans instead of garbanzo.  Delicious!  Did not add the cheese or broccoli but they weren't missed.  The onions,  I chopped raw and topped the finished dish with.  Fresh basil is a must.  I added whole leaves  after it was plated and hot .  They wilted and added a nice flavor.

It didn't have enough flavor in my opinion so I added some seasonings - a greek styled mix, and a little pesto. I also used a mediterranean herb feta. I also used mini lasagna noodles as  I didn't have the pasta listed in the recipe.

I have to admit I just used this as a starting point, so I used a zucchini, frozen green beans, and some frozen broccoli and cooked them with mixed herbs (fresh herbs that come frozen in little packages at my local store)and the olive oil, salt, and pepper. I didn't have garbanzo beans nor green onions and used chunks of fresh mozzarella instead of feta, since my family prefers it.  Sorry about all the changes, but it was still delicious!

Done it two ways: original and our modified version. You can add as many of the original ingredients as you want (the fresh basil is nice) I use whatever pasta we are in the mood for and substitute whatever green veggies we have (2 or more, sometimes frozen) including broccoli and green beans, and we add a little pan fried bacon w/ caramelized onions + salt and pepper to taste. We blanch the green veggies, strain them out, and use the same water for the pasta. A little bacon really improves the overall flavor...bacon, broccoli, and feta are a winning combination!
