This is very good!  I bought a cheaper cut of meat, and could only marinate for three hours, but it was still very tasty.  I added a chopped red pepper to the skewers and not only did they taste great, but they looked pretty also.  Definitely will put this into my grill rotation of recipes!

Great flavor.  My husband and I thought it was wonderful.  There were a few changes I made to the recipe.  First, I used about 3/4 the pepper the recipe called for because of other reviewers' comments.  Second, I used about half the ginger because I ran out.  Third, I added about a tablespoon of vinegar to the marinade.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  We highly recommend!

This one is GREAT!  My family loved it.  I did use a fresh pineapple and a 6oz can of pineapple juice instead of the can of chunks, used T-bones instead of sirloins, and added green peppers to the skewers.  I can hardly wait to make this again.

I loved this marinade.  Simple ingredients I had in the house, and the meat really had a nice taste.  The pineapple is a nice touch, the kids loved that part.

This was good but a bit too peppery to me.  I increased the brown sugar to 2/3, the pineapple to a 20 ounce can, decrease the pepper by half, and it takes on a much sweeter taste.  Good base.  I've use it with chicken only so far.

These were good, I would add a little more seasoning per my taste.  Definately will make again.  I would maybe recommend fresh pineapple as the canned pineapple sometimes falls apart when skewered.  Thanks!

I had fun putting this meal together! I used London broil, fresh pineapple, red peppers and onions, skewered them on individual skewers (so I could be sure each item was done the way I like) and served over rice for my hubby and with Flat-Out bread for me. I put them under the broiler for about 3-4 minutes per side and unfortunately came out with pretty well-done meat, but otherwise it was very tasty! Will have to try this one again.

Wonderful recipe... marinade works well with chicken as well.  Even my picky son who won't eat Chinese or Japanese food loves this.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe.  Everything has such a wonderful flavor--and it was very easy.  I plan to experiment by adding different vegetables to go with the beef and sauce.  Great!

These were great! The marinade was absolutely delicious! I also put mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and zucchini on the skewers and did them on the Foreman grill because I don't have an outdoor grill. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

Used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and fresh ginger to the marinade. Skewered the beef the next day along with red pepper, red onion, mushrooms (and yes, pineapple). This one got a sixth star from DH, but there seems to be no where to place it. Oh, well, slide on the tip of that last skewer!

This recipe was tasty enough. We used fresh, not canned pineapple. However, my kids described the texture of the beef as "fuzzy". The pineapple in the marinade also acts as a natural tenderizer. Next time, I will add the pineapple chunks when we are ready to grill the skewers. Still, there was nothing left on the platter.

I used fresh pineapple chunks, pineapple juice, and some raspberry vinegar in the marinade.   Very good.  Added other veggies like mushrooms, green/red peppers, and zucchini to the kabobs too.

I have made this recipe a number of times now and it is always a huge hit!  Typically I throw a bunch of additional veggies onto the skewers along with the beef and pineapple (mushrooms, red pepper, onion, zucchini).  I usually throw everything all together with the marinade into a plastic bag and let it sit for about 20-30 minutes.  Last night we tried this with chicken and it was superb!!!  I will be making this for years to come!

This was very good.  The reserved sauce was a little grainy but I didn't warm it up which probably would have resolved some of that.  We had it over Jasmine rice and they were nice together.  We'll def. make this again

These were SO good! So flavorful!  I did use strip steaks cut up instead, just as a personal preference. Will definitely make these frequently.
