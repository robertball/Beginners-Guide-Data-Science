5 stars with these modifications--added to basic recipe: 2  brown potatoes, cubed;1/2 lb baby carrots sliced thin; 3/4c fresh snap peas; 1/4c Hot Madras Yellow Curry powder; 1T Turmeric; 1T red pepper flakes, and 2tsps hot chili pepper powder [we like our food spicy]. 2tsps dry ginger; 1tsp dry basil; 2Tbs brown sugar; 1tsp lemon juice; 1/4c fresh chopped cilantro; 2T jar minced garlic; 1 whole green pepper diced. Before serving over white rice we topped with coarsely chopped peanuts, thin sliced green onions, and raisins.  OMG this is wonderful. I am on a curry high.

We would give this recipe a 4 1/2 stars if it were possible.  We think we'll add some extra spices and maybe some garlic next time and leave out some of the water in the fast chicken soup base.  It was really good.  I used the coconut milk and low sodium broth.  I also just put in white chicken meat and didn't use a whole chicken.

Great receipe.  However, I did not use the receipe for the fast chicken soup base, I used swanson chicken broth.  Not sure how much it affected the taste but I got rave reviews.  I also added way more curry then suggested.  Probably 3 tablespoons more.

This was super tasty! I did tweak to our liking by adding 3 TBL curry as others suggested, leaving the extra water out and only using 2 quarts chicken stock.  I also added 1 TBL cumin and about 1 cup of cooked rice.  Fantastic soup and this one going in rotation around here.  Yummy!  Thanks!

I agree with the other reviewer that this recipe needs a bit less water in the Fast Chicken Base, but other than that it was just about perfect!  The coconut milk was a great touch that added to the soup's texture as well as the curry powder.  I did however use 3 tbsp rather than 2 with the powder, and believe that this added a bit more flavor.  Very nice recipe to have in the collection!

I left out the cilantro because I'm not a fan, but otherwise this is a tasty soup. I put it through the blender for my friend had her wisdom teeth removed and she thought it was fantastic. This soup is even better the next day : )

I used orzo instead of chickpeas and added an extra tablespoon of curry powder.  Oh, and I just used chicken breast and cooked it with the vegetables and box chicken broth for the soup base!  It was delicious!

My boyfriend and I love this soup! In fact, everytime I ask him to get groceries, he comes home with coconut milk and chickpeas, just for this. I've made it with boxed chicken broth before and it's good, while not quite as homey. I also have switched it up by adding leftover curried potatoes when I didn't have chickpeas, it was just as good!

Like the others, less water is advised.  To make up for this addition, I added a tsp of garlic power, 2 TBSP of peanut butter & a couple splashes of Maggi seasoning.  Also cooked with flat leaf parsley as Cilantro isn't our thing.  Finished w/a wege of lime squirted over the top.

It had great curry flavor but was still missing something.

My husband really liked this, and I thought it was just okay. We all felt like it needed to be served over basmati rice or something. Will probably do that with the left overs.
