Delicious.  I was a little nervous trying out a recipe looking for "dry" and "chewy" pork, but everyone raved about the amazing crust, and it really was very moist as well.  I didn't have time to let it rest overnight before pan-frying.  I imagine it would have made it even more delicious, but it was five-star even without it.

Ok, I actually served this during the Super Bowl.  Wife said, "Oh my god!  I am at a five-star restaurant."  My au-pair from S. Africa said it was great ... a 4.5 star.  I would give it a 4 only because five stars for me means my eyes roll up into my head and we didn't quite get there.  What I would say about this is that it is strangely difficult to find recipes for a pork shoulder roast (which is ALWAYS on sale at the super market.  I LOVE port shoulder roast and usually brown it (lots of smoke and hot fat) then cook it all day real slow.  This was pretty easy, albeit not available until the next day, but very easy and very good.  My one complaint about the recipe is that it should give cooking time per pound because my roast was 8.5 lbs.  I stuck a meat thermometer into the middle and cooked it to 160 degrees before turning off the oven.  I was happy with that.  You don't need to change anything with this recipe.

I was looking for a roast pork recipe "Like Mom Made". I have been looking for a recipe of this type for a long time - and this one is perfect. The key is being very generous with the spices. If you can find a roast that has not been trimmed to death - even better (more flavor). 

The idea of searing the slices gives a great texture and is a step you do not want to pass up. 

Great recipe! Enjoy!

This is just like Grandma made! The flavor was incredible for such a simple recipe. It will definitely become a regular in our house. Look forward to trying more recipes from Chef John. Thank you for sharing!

I was not surprised at how awesome my roast turned out. I've tried about a dozen of Chef John's recipes and they're always amazing. I used a 7 pound roast and added an extra hour in the oven. Pan searing made it incredible. The flavor is a great change to the same old BBQ pork we usually prepare.

Great recipe John! I keep messing up when I take the roast out to thaw, so I have had to reduce cooldown times in the fridge to as little as two hours! That said it has been cold when cutting and turned out lovely each time. Not sure what I'm missing by not letting it cool, but I WILL follow exactly the next time! Six stars is appropriate, thank you for sharing!

This is the first review I've ever posted here, but I had to rave!  I was a little nervous about so few reviews, but every one was so positive I tried this on the mystery roast I found in the freezer (since I have no idea what I originally intended to do with it!).  That's actually how I found this, by searching the roast as an ingredient. I like that I had all the ingredients for the roast on hand, although not the accompaniments.  My whole family thought it was fantastic.  I really love the make-ahead portion; this would be great for company because the time-consuming part is already done.  Thanks for the great recipe AND video!

I made this per instructions, but served it on Chef John's "beans & greens" instead of using the salad topper. Excellent flavor - juicy & tender. A keeper for sure! Thanks, CJ! I love YOU and all of your recipes that I've tried. (Yours are the only videos I watch...so entertaining & informative!)

I cooked this up with mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans. Followed to directions exactly for the pork and it has officially been added to the monthly rotation per family request:) No changes needed. It was amazing. Thank you again Chef John!

This one is a keeper! I wanted to do something besides BBQ pulled pork with the pork shoulder I purchased and decided to try this. So glad I did! I used a 6.5 Lb. Bone-in roast and baked it for 4 hours before turning off the oven. It was great, but I’ll test the meat temp at 3 hours the next time as it was over 165F when I turned off the oven, so I think it could have cooked less. Nevertheless it was still soooo crusty and flavorful when I pan fried the “steak slices” after letting it sit overnight in the refrigerator. The bone in this roast was fairly large and hampered the slicing somewhat, so I had a few chunks along with several nice slices. I used about twice as much garlic since it was a larger roast, and sprinkled it with lots of Himalayan salt, black pepper, Penzeys Bavarian seasoning (crushed brown mustard, rosemary, garlic, thyme, bay leaves & sage) and Penzeys Pork Chop seasoning that I mix with smoked paprika. (Salt, granulated garlic, white pepper, onion, ginger, and natural hickory smoke flavor + smoked paprika). To die for. I’ll definitely make this again and recommend it to my friends and other family members. Thanks, Chef John, for cooking your pork shoulder the “wrong way.” For me it’s the only right way from now on!

Outstanding meal. Despite the two day timeline, preparation isn’t too time consuming. The twice cooked pork is both crunchy and tender. Family loved the dinner. Serving with white beans and greens is a nice touch. I’ll probably explore other serving options in the future.

This tasted like pork belly;  it had a slightly chewy, tender, fatty, meaty, yet crispy (paradoxical) texture.  After frying, the slices looked a bit dry.  I drizzled some of the reserved, defatted juices from the roasting pan to make them a bit more juicy and appealing.  I served mine over steamed rice and yellow string beans.  Very homey and yummy dish!  I would like to make this again as it is a great way to prepare a cheaper cut of pork.

My friends and family love this.  I get requests for it all the time.  I have to say, I've now come to rely on Chef John and his recipes.  Unfortunately, I make a massacre of carving anything with a bone, so I'm using a boneless pork shoulder roast now.  It requires lead time to roast one day, chill, and serve the next, but it is so worth it.  FWIW, I just make the roast...not the beans and salad.

This was so good and so easy.  I had to make some minor changes - no fresh garlic but I had garlic powder.  I did not put the salad stuff on top.  Still.....so good.  I baked this on a day that I was home and making a different meal.  The next day we had this.  So easy!  I also changed the olive oil in the pan to butter and added some beef broth when heating this up.  DH loved it!! YAY  Chef John does not disappoint.  Sorry for the changes, but this is a keeper.  We have 1/2 left to freeze for another easy meal.  SWEET!

Ok, I'm a BIG fan of Chef John, but I went looking for a way to use a grilled pork tenderloin in a different way, so that's how I got captured by this one. I made a Chinese BBQ pork tenderloin and wanted to present the leftovers in a new way---this fit the ticket perfectly. I already had cannelloni beans in the pantry, so all I needed was the romaine and cherry tomatoes. Hubby and I both loved the freshness of this---the vinegar soaked salad atop the sliced roast pork over the beans was delicious!!! Give it a try, you'll be surprised. Thx,  once again, Chef John!
