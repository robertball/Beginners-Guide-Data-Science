I made this for my husband and myself last night, because the snow we got on the weekend put me in a "comfort-food" mood. Like others, I added extra seasonings to suit our tastes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and the onions with the meat, and added three crushed garlic cloves and a tablespoon of Minor's beef broth concentrate. I also covered the casserole for the first hour, which kept it nice and moist and helped the potatoes cook properly. I then removed the lid for 15 minutes, which helped set up the dish nicely. Last, I didn't add any cheese at all, and didn't miss it. I felt that cheese would only make it greasy and heavier than I would have been able to stand. Granted, it's not gourmet, but it was created with kids in mind, after all. It was definitely something I'll make again when I feel like comfort food.

This was so good and much easier than shepherds pie- and with alot less mess. I did add a layer of green beans and added a few more seasonings to the meat as it cooked. I used some garlic, basil and paprika which made it flavourful.  It was a big hit with my family and i will certainly make it again.

Wow!  A recipe from "yesteryear."  Add some baby carrots and you have what we used to call "College Casserole" - for obvious reasons -  you can increase the recipe and feed all your hungry classmates.  Also after graduation, you can fix this and feel all your friends who are still looking for jobs - inexpensive and very good!  Thanks so much for sharing this.  I had forgotten the recipe.

If this recipe had had more seasonings listed, I definitely would have give it four stars, however, as written, it would have been very, very bland; at least for our taste. I added garlic and onion powders, a half of an envelope of dried onion soup mix, a small can of mild green chilies and a pinch of cayenne. We thought it was really good and I'll definitely make this again. Thank you!

I prepared this recipe as written, added a can of creamed corn, and layered the ingrdeients in a crockpot.  It cooked on LOW all afternoon and was delicious, no fuss, & didn't heat up my already warm house.

This was 5 star with some modifications suggested by others.  Needed some seasoning. Here are the changes:
1. Brown meat with onion and garlic.
2. Add minced garlic and beef broth concentrate to the liquid. If you don't have the concentrate, just use some powdered gravy mix, or something similar to jazz up.
3. I used beefy mushroom soup.
4. Here is the biggest tip:  Microwave the potatoes (thinly cut) for 8 minutes on high before putting into casserole. This will lessen your cooking time considerably.  Mine was done in 1 hr 10 minutes. Cook first 55 minutes with foil on, last 15 uncovered.

Awesome comfort food.

Hubby says this one is a keeper! I used cream of celery, 1 can mushrooms, small can of green chilies, garlic salt, parsley flakes, and added grated monterey jack to the sauce. I covered it but I think it you would just end up with sauce as last layer, it would dry out a little more. I put cheddar cheese on last 15 minutes, let it rest for 15 minutes out of the oven to set up. Easy and adapts well to what I had on hand!

This was a great casserole.  My husband said, "this is really delicious" after all three helpings.  I added some sour cream to the soup & milk which gave it a richer flavor.  I forgot to add salt & pepper but we didn't even miss it.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours and the potatoes were perfect.

This turned out a lot better than other "poor-man" style hamburger casseroles I've tried. I added some garlic powder to the soup mixture to liven it up a bit, but I was overzealous and overspiced it, so I thinned it out with some extra milk and a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise, which worked well, as there was a perfect amount of sauce. I also added about 3/4 cup each of sliced carrot and celery to the sauce. I probably put more than the recomended amount of cheese on, too; I did't measure. Another thing was the recipe didn't specify whether or not to cover; it's definately one to cover! This will go on my recipe rotation.

This was awesome.  The flavors combined together perfectly, and it was great comfort food.  I used 50% more cheese- I used white extra sharp cheddar.  I've made it three times since!

Made this last night - added onion and a can of mushrooms to the ground beef when browning it. Really enjoyed it, easy and tasted very good.  Nice comfort food.

I, like the others tweaked the recipe a bit. While the beef was browning I used seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder and italian seasonings and cayenne pepper w/ a little worshestire sauce. I also added chopped green pepper and the onions and about 4 garlic cloves minced, to the beef. When I layered I put the potatoes (which I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and old bay-it gives a kick), then the soup mixture (which i added seasonings to as well and doubled), then ground beef,then sharp cheddar cheese shredded, I repeated layers without cheese and put foil on and put in oven. Took out after 1 hr 15 min and then added shredded cheddar and shredded pepper jack on top. Served with crescent rolls and peas. Absolutely delicious. Nice change from handburger helper. All products I had in the fridge or pantry. I have 3 kids (10,4 and 3) and they ate it all up and asked me to make it again. Will def make again!

I grew up on and love casseroles like this!  So hearty and comforting.  However, I've been trying to eat more natural, and canned condensed cream soups are not natural.  I mean, I work in natural foods, I should know better!  So I used my own recipe for 'Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup from Scratch,' which can be found in my recipe box (I used beef broth).  This came out as good as, if not better than, the canned stuff!  I used a 13x9 inch pan, covered it and baked at 375 so it would get done quicker.  In one hour we had our completely delicious and from scratch meal!

I've had a variation of this recipe for quite awhile and it's delicious everytime I make it! I add a can of green beans (drained) ontop of the potatoes, the ground beef and onions ontop of the green beans, and then I pour the milk and soup mixture over everything. I also add a couple shakes of garlic salt instead of normal table salt because I feel it gives the dish more flavor. I've made this recipe with and without adding the cheese ontop and both ways are scrumptious!
Also, I find that the potatoes take an awfully long time to cook in the oven (although I may just slice mine too fat) so I cook the slices for a couple mins in the microwave before placing them in the casserole dish.
A very yummy recipe.

8 28 13 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/26609/hamburger-potato-casserole/ ... So there I was w 2/3# cooked ground beef,& potatoes to use.I did the ingredient search (love that!)&,after looking@scallloped potatoes& hamburger,&jiffy casserole,I decided to go for this one pretty much.This is one of those norecipeneeded recipes,but since there is one ya  look. :D It's one we've all had.It comes together fast&tastes like it's more than it is.I thinly sliced four unpeeled potatoes&used half can skim milk.I mixed together everything except the potatoes (& cheese,which I forgot :O  :D).That&added3/4t salt, 1/4t pepper&garlic,1/2t worcestershire&onion powder(already sliced the tatoes sooo...no fresh this time).Don't use a deep dish on this one - or it will take forever - &leave some "bubbling" room unless you like cleaning your oven.I put mine in a cold oven&it took 2hours. After baking,I sprinkled with some cheese, paprika & parsley.Kinda pretty & it was eaten by the 14yr old boy.Yay!This really does taste better than it sounds&is an inexpensive dinner.I avoid most "cream of" recipes&while you may know it is by the size of the tiny mushrooms,you might not by the flavor.I'm keeping this one.2/13 Added half envelope onion soup mix&cream for milk.Covered about an hour starting w a cold oven.Returned w oven off for maybe 20 - time to thicken, set.Out&then a little parmesan&paprika. 8/13This is good with reduced fat ground pork&cream of chicken soup,too.And,no matter how thin those potat

I added additional seasonings to this casserole and I used Simply Shredded Potatoes (1 bag). It turned out great - added a spoonful of sour cream on top for even more flavor. The only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars is because without the additional seasonings this would be very bland (for our tastes that is.) I also made a side of wild rice which accompanied this dish perfectly. I would recommend making this - just make sure to saute your onions, mushrooms, and garlic. Add some dill weed and thyme. Very good. I added a picture for all to see! Thanks.

Excellent recipe!  I added onion and worchestershire sauce to the beef as it cooked, and added whole kernel corn to the soup mix.  I served this to 100 people at the  soup kitchen, and I got rave reviews.  Thanks!

Excellent! I used 3 c of Bob Evans seasoned shredded hash browns (from the refrigerated section) along with Campbells mushroom with roasted garlic soup and added 1/2 teas dried parley which made it a bit more flavorful and less work. Diced frozen onions cooked with the hamburger instead of added later seems to enhance the flavor. My husband doesn't often eat leftovers, but he has hidden these for a later treat!

I took some of the suggestions that people said.  I used 1/4 cup sour cream, can of Italian green beans, 1 pkg of Lipton onion soup mix, Colby Monterey Jack cheese, since that is what I had available, which ended up being over a cup, plus extra sliced potatoes.  I put all that in a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish and all of it was eaten in one sitting.   I would definitely make this again.  Since I used the onion soup mix I didn't add salt or pepper.

This was sooo tasty! I used 2 cans of condensed soup and sauteed the onions with the beef.  I also mixed some cheese (used a Mexican blend) into the layers, and added onion powder.  To speed up the cooking process I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then turned it back to 350 for the rest of the hour, and it came out perfectly.  Whole family loved it!  Next time I will add mushrooms.

I'm going to give this five stars on the way that I made it.  I added some sour cream to my sauce because it didn't seem like there was going to be enough.  I used most of a  med. size onion for the sauce and when browning the meat.  I added spices (to taste) like garlic salt, oregano, and parsley.  It was super good.  The family loved it.  I wish there was more, but my husband always gets the leftovers for work.  My 2 1/2 year old was more interested in watching a movie, but he did eat it without complaints.  I'm excited to make this again.  Very good.  Like others have said, nice change from Shepherd's Pie (hubby said the same thing!).

As I was making this, I remebered that a former "friend" of mine used to make this all of the time with ground elk and tater tots. This casserole has an amazing flavor considering the simplicity of ingredients. I used cream of celery, sauteed finely chopped onions and garlic with the hamburger and I cut the potatoes into small cubes. I also added some cumin and chili powder while browning the burger, and mixed the potatoes in evenly right before transfering to a 2 qt round dish. I also covered it for about 50 min and then cooked uncovered for about another 10. No cheese this time, and I didn't even miss it.  This is such a great tasting, inexpensive and EASY dish to make--I'll be making it again and again. Thanks for the walk down memory lane, too! :-)

At first nibble I rated this as just good simple comfort food.  But before dinner was done the adults had had 3rd helpings and my son had seconds.  It's nice how the sauce lends itself to additions (I added a little dry mustard and some sour cream).  I covered it during cooking after noticing how dry the top layer of meat was getting. Next time I'll cut the potatoes much thinner--it took the full 90 minutes and a few of them still could have used more time.

This is definetly a keeper. My husband loved it and was a very nice change from sheppards pie...I added chopped garlic and onions to the beef, and to the soup, a little worchestershire and brown it...Cover the casserole with tin foil and the potataoes will cook just fine, remove foil, add cheese and presto dinner is ready....a real KEEPER.

Great, easy, simple recipe! Slicing potatoes made easy by using mandolin. Needs loads more seasoning; I used a generous heap of black pepper, garlic powder, rosemary sea salt, and it STILL needed more seasoning after it was done. Great to experiment with!

Hmm.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I sauteed the onion (2 full cups of chopped vidalia - should have used an onion with more bite but the quantity was good) in a tablespoon of butter, then browned the turkey with a healthy dose of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb and some celery salt.  Since this recipe is basically dressed up scalloped potatoes, I layered the meat and potatoes (5 good sized idaho spuds sliced really thin with a mandolin slicer), three layers of spuds, two layers of meat, then dumped the liquid (to which I added a heaped teaspoonful of minced garlic) right over the top.  I pulled the potatoes away from the sides so the liquid could get all the way to the bottom.  I baked it, uncovered, at 350 for a full 90 minutes.  Then added the cheese to the top and put it back in to melt (about seven minutes).  The potatoes where UNDER COOKED in the middle layer and almost done on the top and bottom layers.  We could have gone a full two hours, I'm sure!  The flavor was ok but there is still room for improvement.  Maybe some chopped chives or scallions, maybe some red pepper flakes, I don't know.  Hope this helps!

I changed this up quite a bit but it was really good for a quick dinner. I used 1lb beef cooked with taco seasoning and a can of corn, 1.5 lb baby potatoes sliced, cream of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, 1/2 cup beef broth, & 1/4 cup sour cream. Instead of layering the sauce, I mixed it in with the cooked ground beef mixture and layered that with the potatoes. Very easy! Next time I would also add green chiles.

I loved this recipe.  I boiled the potatoes to soften them while I browned the meat so that I didn't have to cook it for so long.  I also added 1/2 and pound of sausage to give it a little more flavor.
My husband loved it, we will have it again.

Really great taste. I would recommend putting the cheese on at the end and then putting it back in the oven for 5 minutes, or cheese was way over cooked.

This is a great basic recipe! I followed other reviewers suggestions and seasoned the potatoes with salt & pepper. I also added about 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies and pre-cooked the potatoes in the microwave because I was pressed for time but this turned out fabulous! Thanks so much, this is a keeper and can be changed up easily!

This was surprisingly decent for a quick meal. I added diced onions and garlic and steak seasoning to the hamburger. Did not have green beans (and didn't really want) so I added corn, tossed it in the 1 hour timed oven and headed off to the gym. Decided not to mess with cheese when I got home. It was warm, ready and waiting in the oven when I got home. Served with fruit and bread/butter.

So, here's what I did to make it a bit more flavorful... I used 1.5 lbs extra lean ground beef and added 1 packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup and 1 tbls of Worchestershire sauce to the hamburger as I cooked it.  I also added a couple of tbls of dried minced onion because I didn't have a fresh one and my dh loves onions.  I left the skins on the potatoes because we prefer them that way.  I added 2/3 cup sour cream to the soup mixture and left out the salt & pepper.  Cooked for 1:15 minutes covered.  Added the cheese (extra sharp cheddar) and cooked uncovered for 15 minutes.

This is pretty good comfort food. I didn't brown the meat, just made patties with very lean ground beef and used spicy seasoned salt. Also added extra onion and green pepper strips.

This recipe was great. I added some carne asada flavoring to the ground beef to give it an extra kick. I then made it basically like a lasagna - potatoes, sauce, meat, cheese & then repeated again. My husband and kids really liked it. Will do again soon!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because as it is, it's fair.  I doctored it up and it turned out really good.  I used 5 med-large potatoes and cooked them in the microwave until they were done.  Once cooled, I peeled and thinly sliced them.  I fried the hamburger with onions and fresh garlic, added lots of pepper, Mrs. Dash, basil, beef bouillion and half a head of cabbage, roughly diced.  I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with milk, sour cream, mexican cheese dip, pepper, beef bouillion, onion flakes, garlic, chili powder and Mrs. Dash.  Inbetween layers of potatoes and meat mixture, I added lots of cheese and the sauce.  Baked it 1 hour and 10 minutes at 375.  It turned out pretty good!

My family really enjoyed this, a great new way to use ground beef. Although I did saute 6 chopped garlic and one chopped white onion and than add it to the ground beef. Also added about 1/2 cup brown gravey to soup mix. Will make this again.

I think my only real complaint here is that I like a more seasoned beef.  I caramelized the onions in one pan, and char-grilled the beef before adding them both in one to finish off the brown.  I also subbed out some of the milk with sour cream.  It came out very good with my tweaks.

I found this recipe by accident and boy am I glad!  My hubby is strictly a meat a potatoes guy and he loved this dish. I tweaked it a little; added the sour cream as suggested by another reviewer and added a layer of cheese in the middle.  I also put in more spices, garlic and onion powder, some parsley flakes and a pinch of basil, and cooked the meat with a couple of bouillions cubes. It turned out absolutely wonderfully and gave it a more "cheesburger" flavor.
I used foil to cover it and the potatoes were nice and tender after only an hour in the oven.
Thanks for the great comfort food recipe!

Thanks!  Very easy to make.  I made it just as written except that I used cream of chicken soup.  3 cups potatoes ended up being about 1.5 lbs.

Simple, comforting dinner.  This was easily prepared and baked.  After reading some other reviews, and seeing that many commented on the dish being a little bland, I decided to up the spices right from the start.  I also just mixed the soup with the beef to make layering easier.  I added in some onion salt, seasoned salt and pepper.  No one commented on it being bland, so it must have done the trick.

My husband and son both loved this!  I was short on time, so i left the skin on the potatos, thinly sliced them and boiled them.  While they were boiling I browned the beef.  Then let warm in oven for 15-20 minutes.

I love this recipe the way it is, but at times I do a little change up and make it more italian.  I add garlic powder, basil and oregano to the beef when browning, and some more to the soup mixture, then I use the italian 5-cheese blend of shredded cheese instead of cheddar.   I've also done this in my slow-cooker, on low for about 7-8 hours....adding the last amount of cheese about 1/2 hour before serving...yummy!

Awesome comfort food :) I added some extra seasonings (when cooking the meat), added a big spoonful of sour cream, and some shredded ched to the soup mix (I think next time I will add a little less milk because of that). I quarter sliced the potatoes so they would be easier to eat for my toddlers. And I covered with foil.. will make again for sure.

I have made this 3 times now. Fix your hamburger meat to taste. I add chili powder, onion powder, garlic, powder, and sautee the onions before putting in the mix. I also add garlic powder salt ad pepper to the soup mix. I layer with cheese and i put mushrooms in the layers. Cut your potatoes small otherwise you will be baking this dish for several hours. My boyfriend says he could eat this everyday. It's very good and easy!! I also took it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it.

I took other reviewers advice & seasoned the meat with garlic, onion, pepper, and seasoned salt.  I also added some onion soup mix to the milk and mushroom soup mixture.  I substituted the ground beef for ground turkey.  My kids really liked it (amazing!).  My husband and I thought it was good & I will make it again.

This is good -- it is one of those recipes that you can play around with to suit your family's taste. I added onion soup mix to the meat for a bit of extra flavor. I also used hashbrowns too.

This was pretty good. The kids loved it.  I like it because its simple and I had everything for it already in the kitchen.  Could have used more seasoning on the meat.  I think next time I will add taco seasoning or something like that!

My 2 picky kids wouldn't eat it because it didn't look appetizing, but I really liked it.  It will be one of those dishes I make when I run low on ingredients and creativity.  I did make a few CHANGES though.  I didn't have all the time it called for, so I took the suggestion of others and boiled the potatoes before hand.  Because I cut back the baking time because the potatoes were boiled, I added the onion to the hamburger when I was browning it.  So I reading about all these bland casseroles, so I added a packet of TACO SESONING to the hamburger as I cooked it.  I think that the flavoring was perfect and I didn't have to just wing it with adding this spice and that.

I read the reviews and added garlic to the meat and cooked the onions along with it.  I also added 1/2 container of sour cream to the "sauce" and an extra can of mushrooms.  
I ended up having to bake it quite a bit longer and even then the potatoes weren't done.  I don't think I would try this again, even with all the additions, it was very bland.

I slightly modified this recipe. I heated the milk and soup with velveta cheese, and I cooked the onion with the hamburger. I also layered the cheddar with the potatoes. We're such cheese lovers. It's got to be alot for us! It was fantastic! Thanks for the great idea!

Very good and pretty quick. Added a little garlic to the burger while cooking, a can of corn with other ingredients, doubled the cheese, added the other half in the middle somewhere. Will make this again for sure.

It was easy to prepare and my youngest son, the picky eater, actually had a second helping. I had to use cream of chicken soup instead and added a few other spices to it. My son also said to layer some cheese in it next time. I'll try it and see how it goes.

This was pretty good but next time I will make some changes.  Add onion and garlic to meat while frying.  Some worchestershire sauce for extra flavor and corn.  Also, I think the layers should be meat first, potatoes and then soup.  It dries up on top if you don't put the soup last.

I thought this was nice.  I however did alter it just a tad.  I used garlic salt and pepper sprinkled over every layer.  i forgot to add the onions but it was fine with out them.  I also used some all purpose seasoning in it as well.  My husband suggested I use red devil in the mix next time for a little zip. I may try this. but it had enough flavor as it was.  the appearence is not great but taste is not bad at all.

My husband was hankering for something with beef and potatoes and cheese and I happened upon this recipe and thought I would try it out.  He does not like cream of mushroom soup in anything, so I substituted cream of chicken soup and it still turned out wonderful.  It was very filling and would be great served on a cold wintery day.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again in the future.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was pretty good!  My husband thought it was a good weeknight meal.  Now, if I can only adapt this to the slow cooker!  I would go easy on the salt, as it was a little salty for my taste (and I like salt).

Very easy and quite filling. Good for people like me who aren't good at cooking. Make sure you cook a little bit longer than it says or your potatoes will be hard.

I used the recipe as a template. I know that we like our food a little more flavorful and jam packed with veggies. With this in mind I added paprika, fresh ground Himalayan sea salt, fresh ground peppercorns, and freshly chopped garlic to 18 ounces raw 96% lean ground beef, 3 ounces of fresh chopped portabella mushrooms and 3 stalks of green onion.  As this mixture was about 3 minutes from being Cooked I added in 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables.  While meat mixture was cooking I cut up 1 3/4 pounds of Yukon gold potatoes. I sprayed casserole dish with a 3 second spray of Pam on bottom of dish.  Placed a layer of potatoes on base on casserole dish and added some ground peppercorns to potatoes.   Now that meat and veggies were done I added the can of mushroom soup and 1/3 cup of skim milk to the meat pot and created all one mixture. I layered meat/ sauce mixture over the potatoes and repeated the process on the next layer. For a total of 3 layers of potatoes. There was very little meat/sauce mixture for a 3rd layer of meat which was ok because I had made sure to reserve a ladle size amount to spread lightly overtop. I covered the top with 1 1/2 cups low fat Mexican cheese blend. I covered entire dish with aluminum foil and baked in 350 oven for 70 minutes.  After 70 minutes I removed foil and cooked for an additional 4 minutes.  I let dish sit for 15 minutes and then added a stalk of cut green onion to top for color.  I hope my suggestions help others.  Just a reminder everyo

Just a real nice casserole.  Needed 2 hrs in oven, prob because I used a casserole dish and it was not as spread out.  But so worth the wait.  Hubby put ketchup on, I liked it w/out.  Awesome leftovers, too.

Stumbled upon this for an easy and yummy weekday meal that used what I had on hand. As written I feel like it would have been a little bland so I added my own flair! I added garlic and onion powder and celery salt to the ground beef while I browned it. I also added red chili flakes to the soup mixture because my husband and I love spicy! I used red potatoes which I'm not sure makes a difference and I also chose not to peel them (unnecessary as far as I'm concerned.) I used half cheddar cheese and half part skim mozzarella to cut out a little bit of fat. 

Turned out great! Very delicious and easy! My husband and our friends loved it. Sometimes simple comfort food is just what you need!

Tips: Cook the onion and ground beef together, add some paprika too. Mix a couple of tablespoons of mayo in with the soup, add a can of drained green beans, use a mixed blend of cheeses, and really slice the potatoes thin. Awesome-we ate every bite at one sitting!

This was a great, easy recipe. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, 2 lbs of hamburger meat and 2 cans of sliced potato. A dash of garlic salt to the meat. I layered it put shredded cheese on top. Very yummy and easy. I have also made with ground turkey and you can't even tell.

In an 11x7 pan, each "layer" of meat (1 lb) is more like just some meat sprinkled around, and it takes at least 1 1/4 cup of cheese to actually coat the top thinly. The casserole tastes  very good, especially if you add more seasonings. Cook time shown here is perfect if you cover the dish.

I am making this for the second time tonight and I have to say that it is really good. I did change a couple of things. I cooked the meat and onion together and added a little more seasoning (season all, garlic salt). I also used cream of potato soup because my husband dislikes mushrooms. Because of the bland taste of the potato soup, I did add more seasoning than salt and pepper (garlic, garlic pepper, season all). They both seem like minor changes to me and I really like this dish. It is very much "Meat and Potatoes!"

Excellent recipe. Hubby raves about it.  He asked for a small microwave to plug into his generator to heat this dish while on hunting trips!  Only change I made: season the hamburger with garlic salt or if I forget, sprinkle it on top before serving.

I read past reviews and did as some suggested and used some garlic while frying the beef. I also seasoned it with seasoning salt while browning. I think this dish would be a little bland if you do not season the meat. I do a dish similar to this layering peas, sliced onions, etc and seasoning each layer with salt and pepper before pouring the soup mix over top. I think this dish is very versatile.

I love casseroles. I doubled this one. 2 lbs. hamburger,2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Used one onion, and about the same amount of milk in it. Also put a can of corn in the hamburger mixture. I made this after work so I wanted it kind of fast, so I used 2 bags [20 oz. each] of "fresh" shredded potatoes, there over by the eggs in my grocery store. I put one bag of the potatoes on the bottom of a 9x13 pan [sprayed of course], seasoned them, put some cheese on that,layered the hamburger mixture on, put some more cheese on that, put my last bag of potatoes on that, seasoned that and put the last of my cheese on. I cooked it on a high heat,[we were hungry]425* for about 40 min. It was a nice change from using noodles all the time for a casserole.

Excellent casserole, although I changed a few items, I doubled the cheese mixed half in the soup mixture.  Added diced jalapenos and garlic.  Delicious!!!!!  I will defintely add this to my collection.

I found this over a year ago and have made it several times, because its simple to put together and delicous.
Be sure to season the beef well...as you would for any other dish. I add onions and celery when browning the beef...everything else I did as written.
Excellent recipe...my husband and child both love it.
Thank you :)

This was very good, my family loved it and, although I doubled the recipe, it was nearly gone.  I give it only 4 stars because I think the amount of milk is a little to much, it was kind of soupy when I took it out of the oven.

Much better than I expected. My hubby wanted it again the next night! This would make a good potlock dish, or when you have lots of company over.

This is a good.  I par boiled the potato's so I only had to bake it for 1/2 an hour.  I also added some sliced fresh mushrooms and the next time I will add some sliced celery.  I will definitely make this again. Quick, easy and tasty.

Definitely a keeper!  It was either go out to eat or use things I had on hand to cook.  I fed in ground beef & cream of mushroom & chose this recipe.  After reading the reviews I added onions with ground beef, garlic powder & cajun spice. To the milk mixture I added a little fresh parsley.  You can season to your own personal taste.  Slice the potatoes very thin to reduce cooking time.  I cooked the potatoes about 4 minutes in the micro & heated the liquid also.  Cooked covered about 45 min & then added chesse & cooked uncovered for about 5 mins.  We all loved it.  Would be an inexpensive meal to cook for company served with salad & corn.

I liked this recipe...but since I'm from Louisiana you know that I had to make a few changes.  I seasoned my ground meat and when I cooked it I add about half a pack of seasons blend while I cooked it. For the soup mixture I also added some extra seasoning, a packet of dry onion soup mix, garlic powder and one cup of milk. I added some frozen corn as a layer. Melted some velveeta on top and it was great!

This was a very tasty recipe. I made no changes but next time I will likely double everything as the ingredients only filled my casserole dish (9x11) halfway. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was a little disappointed.  Prep time took longer than anticipated, and once I put everything together, I thought to myself, "That's it?"  I found myself scrambling to add more ingredients to help it out.  However, the end result was fine, and my family still ate it.  So I guess you could deem it somewhat successful.

We are surely talking "meat and potatoes" here but it was good. Very filling and most inexpensive to make. I added a can of green beans and next time will include a can of mushrooms also. I was out of onion so used onion flakes instead. Good stuff, serve with warm biscuits and a salad and you're set!

Good recipe.  Definitely kid friendly - and very simple to make.  I used about a 1/2 cup more potatoes than called for, and for that reason (I think) it was a bit dry.  Next time I will use as many potatoes and increase the amount of cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks!

My family loved this. It used up the leftover potatoes.  I added worchestershire sauce and garlic salt to the meat after draining.  I also used sour cream, milk and cream of celery soup instead of the cream of mushroom.

This was a very good recipe. I added 3/4 cup of sour cream and a 4.5 oz can of mushrooms (drained). I put the hamburger on the bottom of the pan.then the potatoes and poured the soup mixture over the top. I sliced the potatoes very thin.I Stirred it all about half way through cooking time then maybe once or twice more. I cooked it for 1 and 1/2 hours to make sure the potatoes were done.It was very good and even better the next day when I took some for lunch at work.My husband also liked it. Thank you for sharing.

Loved this recipe with a few modifications after reading the advice of the other great cooks.  I had no onion so I spiced with garlic powder, onion powder,  pleasoning seasoning and a little salt and pepper.  
I also added a can of mushrooms, and 1/2 cup of sour cream.
I stirred a few times while baking to keep the hamburger from
getting dried out on top and also layered the potatoes on the
bottom with the meat mixture next and sauce on top.  
I also microwaved the potatoes prior to baking for two-two minute sessions at full power to cook the potatoes a little more.  
The total cook time was still 1 and 1/2 hours.
My husband loved it and even came back a short while ago to
eat some of the refrigerated leftovers.  He said it even tasted
great cold!

Great old fashioned meat and potatoes kind of meal!  One note: recipe called for an 11x7 pan, but I used a 13x9 pan.  This larger size made the meat look sparse and spread out over the potatoes, so next time I'm going to try a smaller pan.  Also don't OVER-brown your ground beef or it'll get too brown in the oven.  Great recipe!

This was very good although I did alter the recipe a bit.  I added garlic and extra salt and pepper.  I also added sour cream instead of milk because I was out.  Added a little parsley. It only took about 45 minutes to cook and maybe I sliced the potatoes too thin.  My husband loved it.

This was not bad, but it does need a lot more seasoning for our taste.  Maybe, season the meat after draining the fat.

My two youngest (4 and 1) absolutely loved this recipe.  My oldest (7) did not.  I added garlic and mushrooms and fried the onions with the hamburger.  I also added sour cream to the soup mixture.  I found it very filling and nicely flavoured.  It seemed to me to be alot like scalloped potatoes with ground beef in it.  Thank you.

Really enjoyed this for dinner. A really nice taste and although it takes awhile to cook, it really fills everyone up.

I have to say I made this again, but cheated a little: I didn't feel like peeling spuds, so I used a box of dehydrated scalloped potatoes. I made the sauce as per the box, instead of using the milk from the recipe. The result was pretty good & it was ready in 20 minutes! I also added a couple cups of frozen peas.

I turned out really great, except it seemed to be missing something to give it some added kick.  Maybe put some hot sauce in there to kick it up a notch.  I also suggest adding more potatoes.

Only  thing I did different was to boil the potatoes prior to putting everything in the oven.  It speeds up the process.

I decided to boil my potatoes to save time, I also sauteed my onions, minced garlic and nature seasoning while cooking my hamburger meat, when I put the casserole in the oven I cooked it for 25 minutes and then I topped it with cheese and broiled in for 6 minutes. I served with mixed veggies! So yummy and it's not bad on the carbs and that's a plus for me.

I made this last night and it was a hit! My sister is extremely picky when it comes to food because she is autistic. She loved it!

I did make a few alterations while preparing the hamburger. I added 2 cloves of garlic, green onions, green bell pepper and paprika.

Also, used a stick of butter and rubbed it along the bottom of the casserole dish to keep from sticking but it also gave a buttery flavor to the dish. Just a thin layer.

Cover it with parchment paper for the first 45 minutes. This helps keep the potatoes and hamburger moist. Aluminum makes it too hot and causes the top to be crunchy.

Added a very thin layer of mild cheddar cheese so it wouldnt be too heavy. Highly recommend this dish!

Simple, yet delicious. I’ve eaten this before but this was first time I made it. I made one batch for us and had no leftovers. Wish I did. I used an 8x8 pan and followed recipe just did this. I cooked beef and put it on he bottom of the casserole dish. Then I layed the potatoes as even as possible on top. Then put that milk, soup, onion mixture on top. Same concept as recipe just minimal steps. Took about an hour and 15 mins to bake. Plus few mins to melt cheese.

I too made some adjustments to the spices. I I sautéed my onions and garlic then sautéed the meet I then added Worcestershire, ketchup,(it is a cheese burger Right?)salt, pepper and a little chilly powder. I also cooked it in my crockpot and let it cook all day on low.  20 minutes before serving I took the lid off sprinkle the cheese on top put it in the oven at 350° just to cook out some of the moisture that was left and Viola delicious! There were no leftovers!

Great comfort casserole. Agree on sautéing onion with meat and adding garlic. Everyone loved. Have made with both turkey and ground meat. On my rotation.

The casserole was a runny mess! First, it took over 2 hours to get my 1/4" thick cut potatoes to be soft enough to eat and it lacked salt! I seasoned with s&p and garlic while the meat browned and then added more s&p and garlic while assembling.  I guess not enough though.  Mine didn't look like the picture at all. After the first 1.5 hours I noticed the sauce was so runny it was like potato beef soup. I added cornstarch to thicken up. I will try this one again with some modifications like temp and seasoning and putting cornstarch in with the soup mix from the beginning. But so far this recipe is a thumbs down unless you add your own pizzazz to it, which defeats the purpose of a recipe for those who don't know how to modify

I made some slight variations to the original recipe but this was an excellent starting point. I added garlic, chopped fresh green beans, used a spicy jalapeno cheese, and used cream of broccoli instead of the cream of mushroom soup. I microwaved the sliced potatoes for about 3-4 minutes just to help cut down on baking time. Overall this was very good and we'll be making it again!

The only difference in making this dish was the fact that I cannot eat mushrooms so I have used cheddar cheese soup or cream of potato soup instead. In a pinch I have used beef broth with cream stirred into it. A great comfort food for a cold night.

This was delish!! My two teenagers devoured it.  I used 1 lb of hamburger and 1/2 lb of sausage. I also used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom.  6 medium sized potatoes, cut thin seemed to be just the right amount. I topped it with sour cream but my kids put ketchup on top. To each his own I guess. I'm sure this will be great in the morning with a fried egg on top. yah boy!!

I made this for dinner, used exactly what it called for, only thing I did was covered it for an hour and then 15 minutes uncover, then added the cheese for the last 15 minutes for a total of 1 hour and 1/2. Will definitely make for my coworkers.

This is a good basic recipe but you need to add the things your family likes. I added Worcestershire sauce to the Mushroom soup, 3 finely chopped cloves of Garlic,and I sauteed sliced mushrooms along with onion before adding on top of the meat. It was a bit dry,so next time I'll add more milk.

I agree with others, needs a bit more seasoning.  I didn't bake it, just cooked it on the stovetop like I would hamburger helper.  It tasted good, and I will make again, but add some extra seasonings.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried baking the fries alone first and that helped. Also I used season salt on the burger which gave it a lot more flavor, and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. When it's all done my family adds chopped pickles, tomatoes, bacon bits and a bit of ketchup and mustard. This way everyone gets to eat it just the way they like it.

I made this Recipe as written and would have given it a 5 star rating just because everyone liked it. I decided to give it a Four because it is a great stater Recipe. Everyone in the family thought it needed something to make it great, Peas and carrots were suggested, also would taste great with a small dab of sour Cream. I would recommend this recipe as it but it can be changed a little to add more flavor.

This is a quick and easy recipe whenever you're ready for some good comfort food.  I did make a few changes.  I cooked the onions with the meat and added 8 oz of cream cheese to the sauce.  I also covered the dish with foil to help cook the potatoes and then removed foil for the last 1/2 hour.  I added garlic to the meat as well.  I'm thinking next time I may try adding green chiles in the layering as well as some mushrooms.  There is so much you can do with this basic recipe.  Definitely will make again...and again!

Awesome easy recipe! I ended up with a ton of potatos and was looking for new stuff. I did use a tiny bit more than the 3cups of potatos so I used 2cans o f cream of mushroom soup, more onion I added a beef bullion cube some oregano rosemary and i forget the other. As well as garlic and some garlic and onion powder after reading the reviews. Only because I'm a flavor freak. I added the extra cheese from my small packet of shredded cheese in one of the layers. I'm quite happy glad I read the reviews I'm sure I'd like it even without the extra but they dif made a difference and will be making this again. Leftovers for tomorrows lunch too.

I've made this for years with some slight differences.  I usually use cream cheddar cheese soup instead of mushroom.  Some times I will use cream celery or cream chicken soup.  I cut the potato slices very thin.  Depending on how much I make, I might add two cans of soup instead of one.  I start out baking on 400 degrees for at least twenty to twenty five minutes.  I do cover the dish with aluminum foil or a lid depending on what baking dish I use but it's best to cover it.  After twenty or twenty five minutes, I take it out, mix it up, return it to oven on 375 for about fifteen to twenty minutes.  I then remove the foil or lid, and add grated cheddar cheese to the top, place it back in uncovered til the top cheese begins to brown.  Overall, it takes only 40 to 45 minutes to bake for me, every time.  I do add milk, onion, seasoning.  It's an easy meal to make and easy to change up some ingredients for variety from time to time.  Some people add chicken instead of beef and I have even used sausage.  By the way, I don't layer it, I simply mix it all together.

I added a splash of Worcestershire and cooked the onion with the ground beef. I also didn't layer. I just blended everything together. The whole family loved it!!

Thanks to the excellent reviews on Allrecipes.com I knew that this would have been fairly bland for our tastes.  Add some Louisiana-styled hot sauce, garlic and Worstershire sauce to the gravy and pre-cook the spuds in the microwave for 10 minutes.  You'll have a good meal out-of-the-oven in 25-30 minutes. The addition of extra veggies would have been good as well.

I gave the recipe 3 stars because I did add a few things which I'm sure made it more tastier! With my additions I would've easily given it 5 stars.  My husband didn't even add salt and pepper - something he does almost automatically with almost everything!  What I did:
Sauteed a can of mushrooms and 2 cloves minced garlic along with the already called for onion when I was browning the meat.  Added approx. 1 tablespoon garlic powder, a bit more salt and pepper, and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  Covered the dish with foil and baked for an hour.  Then I took it out of the oven and sprinkled on the cheese.  The cheese melted while I opened a can of refrigerator biscuits, split them in half, and placed them on top of the cheese.  Then back in the oven for an additional 15 minutes or until the biscuits were done... all I can say is YUM.  Definitely will be making again!

Yummy!  Everyone in my house loved this!  Which is rare.  I used instant mashed potatoes tho because i don't like the taste of the tubs of mashed potatoes.  Next time i will also use canned green beans, my hubby prefers those over frozen bc he like them mushy.  Great receipe.  Maybe i will make this again this week....

Great recipe would be five stars but as many reviewers noted it needs much more seasoning. Even after I took others advice and added more seasoning it still needed more.  I will make this again but will season more aggresively.

Thia was good - as per other reviews (needed more flavor), I added a couple tablespoons of worchestershire to ground beef, onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, and shredded carrot mixture, and to the soup mixture added a pinch of nutmeg. Baked uncovered at 300 for over 1 hour, topped with cheese and baked 15 min. I will definitely make this again with my additions.

I loved this. Easy, plus my toddlers loved it, which means total score in my house. Only thing I did was instead of Cream of Mushroom soup I used Cream of Onion because my husband is allergic to mushrooms. Plus I added Garlic seasoning. It was Great !!

We loved this- the key is to slice the taters very thin. I did add some salt, pepper, and garlic since we love garlic. So delicious, easy and comforting.
Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I had hamburger and wanted to make something that would last a while. I realized I had no onions after I started this recipe so I added Lipton Onion Soup mix and I added red pepper flakes for a kick to the meat. Good choices. Will be keeping this recipe.

Edible but not sure its worth it just for a cheap easy meal.  Id rather bake, fry, or anything the potatoes seperately.  It was not horrible, just not the most appealing mix of textures.  Maybe even putting the meat mix on the bottome, then cheese, and then potatoes on top so they could crisp a little, kind of like a shepards pie, might be a little better for my family.

This is a great recipe, everyone was almost licking their plates.  I thought it was perfect as is.  I didn't think it needed any extra ingredients, it's all about the potatoes and the cheese so it doesn't need anything but the salt in my opinion.  The only thing i did different was put the oven at 450 instead of 350 and it was done in 30 minutes, then i added the cheese and put it back in for 10 more minutes...awesome, thank you, will definitely make again!

Pretty good recipe. As suggested by others, I made a bunch of changes. First, I added salt, pepper, and italian seasoning to the beef. Secondly I put all of the beef on the bottom of the pan. Then, I covered it with a layer of mixed vegetables. Cubed potatoes went on top of this layer. For the soup mixture, I sauteed some fresh mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and mixed it into the soup mix (made otherwise as stated). I poured the mixture over the casserole and topped with a bit of cheese. Very good! I will be making this one again although I'm sure it won't be the same next time!

very bland. But a good base recipe. I added three cloves of garlic to the onions, which I sauteed before browning the hamburger. I added the can of soup to the meat in the skillet and warmed it up. Then I added about 1/3 cup of white wine and let it reduce a minute or two. Then I added the milk. I added sliced carrots in with the potatoes and layered cheese along with everything else. I ended up using cream of potato soup (because I had it and I don't care for mushrooms) and it turned out great!

My hubby and 3 kids all love this recipe...I always add extra seasoning, and a can of mushrooms to the hamburger.  Instead of cheese for a topping I make a box of stove top stuffings and spread that over the top the last 30 minutes of cooking...it gives it more flavor and a nice texture. Everone loves it and its great on a cold winter day.

This recipe was very tasty.  Like other reviewers I added additional seasoning and garlic.  I also added mushrooms.  I sliced potatoes very thin and it definitely took the full 1.5 hours to get them tender.

Browned hamburger, onion, garlic and pepper.  Added cream of mushroom soup and milk.  Mixed well.  Cooked potatoes in microwave about 5 minutes.  Cubed and added to meat mixture.  Added can drained green beans.  Covered and simmered in 5 minute increments until potatoes are done.  Didn't even add the cheese (maybe next time).  Awesome!  1 pan and cooked on top of the stove and didn't heat up the house for an hour plus.

I didn't measure my potatoes and had closer to 1.5# of beef so I added an extra can of cream of mushroom.  Also added in a layer of green beans.  VERY easy and the kids loved it.  Will def keep in my file.  Thanks!  =)

YUMMO! I used simply potatoes homestyle sliced potatoes (in a bag in refrigerated section) to save time ... otherwise, made as called w/the small addition of extra seasoning of ground beef as other had stated -- 2 adults and 3 children age this and there as not one piece of tater/meat/cheese left! I think someone actually licked the pan!  Definitely will be making this again! (doubling obviously)  Thank you Gravyclan for this awesome recipe!

The recipe is ok. I found it alittle bland the first time I made it. It should have more seasoning. The second time I made it, I added italian seasoning spice, garlic powder, and sweet basil to the ground beef. I also added some fresh mushrooms, peas and carrots. It tasted much better with the added spices!

Made this last night. GREAT!! Even my wife liked it, and she is not much for ground beef.  Next time, I will double it for left-overs.

We enjoyed this! I seasoned the ground beef with paprika, basil, garlic powder and garlic salt while it was cooking, and sauteed the onions along with the beef. Otherwise, made as directed, and it was a big hit! So easy! Thanks!

This recipe can be made more quickly and still taste yummy.....use a 16 oz bag of tater tots instead of peeling all those potatoes...and cut the cooking time to 40 to 30 minutes....just till bubbly.

I doubled the amount of soup and milk (big family) added some spices, few handfuls of matchstick carrots, and thinly sliced turnip (just to add more veggies to the meal).  Very good recipe.

Very good. Used this recipe as a base for my own.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and shredded the potatoes instead of chopping them.

I added this recipe to my box way back in 2003 I just tried it 1/13/2010 It was great A big hit with all who tried it. the only thing I did differnt  was mix the browned ground beef with the soup mix it made it easier to layer. Just wish I had tried this one sooner also very easy and fast

I made this the other night and after reading many reviews about taste I decided to add 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the mix also, since people saying rather bland as is.  Even with the garlic added, it was still rather bland and needed quite a bit of salt/pepper to fix it up. Also, cooking time wasnt enough for me, saw reviews about that, but didnt change it.  I cooked for 75 minutes at 350, then topped with cheese for 15 minutes more.  Wasnt cooked, ended up turning oven to 425 and cookiing almost another 45 minutes, and my potatoes were very thin, used the Kitchenaide attachment for thin slicing! Hubby only rated a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10, will try again, but need to be more creative with the spices or something.

It's only OK because it is VERY heavy. I cooked the beef with garlic and half a cup of onions. I also hand cut the potato since I didn't have a mandolin. This recipe doesn't quite explain the layering order very well. I put meat on the bottom, poured soup mix on top, then potatoes (then do it again). I would recommend putting a layer of potatoes on the bottom to help soak up some of the juices? Also, adding a LITTLE bit of cheese into the layers too. For the top layer, add some of the soup mix so the top potatoes don't dry out and get hard (we just tore this top layer off). I probably won't make this again though.

I made according to the recipe except I added some garlic salt and a little more onion. It was very bland as many have mentioned. Although it was edible, it could definitely use some more spice. Glad I didn't make it for company. Will not be keeping this recipe around for future use.

Yummy!  I made additions though.  I cooked the ground beef in sweedish meatball seasoning.  I used cream of mushroom with garlic, added sour cream to the mix. Next time I will layer cheese in with other layers.  As long as you slice the potatoes thin you should only need about an hour in the oven covered.

This a very good and easy casserole.  It beats the "boxed"  hamburger casseroles by  a long stretch.  I have always made scalloped potatoes with onion/milk/mushroom soup but had never tried adding ground beef until I found this recipe.  It's a keeper!  For those who find the potatoes are not cooked through, cover the casserole for the first 45 minutes of baking.

This came out pretty good, but I made one change and if I make it again I will defnintely make another change.  I am not a huge fan of cream of mushroom soup so I used cheese and broccoli soup instead which tasted good, and I would definitely add more meat next time and maybe some more vegetables. But overall it was tasty :)

I think this is a really good base recipe.  I read the reviews before making this and made some of my own changes as well.  I added the onion to my ground beef as it was browning, and also added seasoning salt to the beef while cooking.  I used cream of celery soup, added the milk and salt and pepper and miked well.  I was going to be out of the house for a while so I cooked this in my crockpot.  I first layered half of the potatoes on the bottom, added 1/2 of the soup mixture, then added the beef and onion mixture, poured a can of drained corn on the meat then layered the rest of the potatoes and topped it off with the rest of the soup.  I cooked this for 2 hours on low, then kicked it up to high for another hour.  Added the shredded cheese on top and it was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This Recipe is great for Picky Eaters. It is a little too bland for my taste, but my picky brother and daughter loved it. Instead of shredding the potatoes though I used a bag Frozen Hash Browns. It worked great. This recipe will definately be used again.

I used sweet potatoes instead (trying to eat more since they are a healthier option). I also added sauzon seasoning to the hamburger when I cooked it. For the cheese I used what I had, shredded cheddar and parmesan. I was very impressed! YUMMY!

Not bad.  I added worcestershire to meat and onion and garlic.  I also added green and red bell pepper.  Mine was a little runny.  I will try a thicking agent next time maybe gravy mix.  Easy fast meal.

This casserole had very good flavor. My family loved it. Only change I made to the recipe was to use ground turkey instead of hamburger.

Might need to do something different...everyone said it was good, but not to really make it again! LOL I'm thinking this is going to go in the lineup, but maybe like twice a year. Sorry....but thank you for posting.

It was pretty much what you'd expect.  I followed the recipe, except that I subbed Quorn crumbles for the beef.  It tasted simple but good on a cold night.  I would not serve it to other people, though, and I doubt that I'd make it again.

An okay recipe.  My family ate it without complaint, so that is always a positive thing when I try a "new" recipe.  I didn't change the recipe ingredients, but I did brown the onions with the ground beef.  I read other reviews about the potatoes not cooking within the bake time.  I didn't have that problem, but I used Yukon Golds as my potato which I think tends to bake more easily.

It's in the oven cooking as I type. There isn't a more versatile Casserole I've found. You can add whatever you want to this! I doubled the sauce(another can soup with 3/4c milk). I'm huge on seasoning hamburger as it cooks anyway so it wasn't much of a hassle for myself...I added Green Pepper, Fresh Diced Garlic, Tenderizer -unseasoned of course, Hamburger Seasoning by McCormicks...LOVE THAT STUFF, 1 large onion diced. To the soup mixtured I added 1 can drained G.Beans & 1 can drained diced chilis. Found that mixing the hamburger in with soup mixture is much more effective and distributed better. Just tasting that mixture was yummy. Can't wait to see how it all comes together for the final product.

Tasty. This casserole can be tweaked every which way depending on what you like or have on hand. Different kinds of potato, different cheeses, and any veggie.Add whatever seasoning you wish as it does need more seasoning. Good starter recipe.

It is not even out of the oven but I tasted it and my goodness this is great. I believe that this will be a family favorite. The only thing I changed was I added cubes of velvetta to it because I love things cheesy and it was a good addition to this recipe but I kept the rest the same. Thank you so much for this recipe I will make often!

The dish cooked perfectly! But unfortunately I used taco seasoning based on all the reviews saying it was better that way. Not true! I feel the taco seasoning ruined it. Next time I make it I will leave it out. I did change a few other things. I cooked the onion (a quarter of one, the listed amount of onion is outrageous!) with the ground beef. Then mixed in some garlic powder, basil, and paprika with the cream of mushroom & milk so that the sauce itself had a lil bit more flavor. It said to layer the ingredients, so I put the beef on the bottom, then the potatoes spread out evenly trying to to over lap each other(that I sliced really thin) then poured the sauce on top. Cooked uncovered for 1 hour and 20 mins... then put the shredded cheese on top and cooked until it melted.
Cant wait to see how it turns out next time w/o the taco seasoning!

I made this for my husband to take hunting with him and he forgot it in the fridge so I had it for lunch the next day. I have to say I was impressed!  It tasted good and was filling; I'm glad we now have a bunch in the freezer!  I added some frozen peas and carrots, used cream of mushroom soup (w/roasted garlic) added mushrooms and a big scoop of sour cream.  I ended up cooking for about 2 hours so the potatoes were done, could have been the dish I used to cook in.  Will definitelyl make again with lots of veggies.

This is so good. I double the recipe because otherwise it just doesn't go very far. And I like to get creative and add different veggies to the meat, ( it gets theme into my kids easier that way) I also mix a little hot pepper sauce to the meat.

Husband & son really enjoyed this recipe.  I wasn't a big fan though.  I have to vote with other people about it being a little bland.  Also, I had to cook it for almost 2hrs. before potatos were completely done.

I made this exactly as written & it was excellent.  If anyone found this "bland" it's because they didn't add enough salt & pepper.  I also used Sharp cheddar cheese which gave it a lot of flavor.  Will definitely make this again because I always have these ingredients in the house!

after reading the reviews for this dish i seasoned it heavily and added a can of green chilis, baked it covered and added cheese after baking.  It reminded us of the flavor of corned beef hash.  Delicious!

I actually would give this recipe a 4.5.  I used added 1 can cream of celery with the cream of mushroom and added a dab of sourcream.  I didnt have any milk so I subbed with a little water and it was fine.  ALso, adding some adobo seasoning, garlic, onion, cuman, and salt/pepper to the meat turned out really well.  You can also easily change up the cheeses as well, I have used colby and also have used mexican (w/o the seasoning) and both turned out fine. This is a good recipe to use up things around the house.

Make sure the soup mixture covers the potatoes and you're in business.

My husband thought it was a bit bland, but he managed to spice it up on his own.
The best part is that my toddler ate this.  I finally found a recipe that he'll eat.  Thank you!

I'd say this is a 3 star recipe as far as flavor is concerned, but I'm giving it 4 stars because it is so economical. I added a layer of frozen peas, making it a full meal in one dish. I browned the meat with garlic and cumin, and omitted the onion (boyfriend's preference). Nothing bad about this dish at all, just nothing too special. Great meal for when you're on a budget though, thanks!

Everyone I cooked this for loved it! I added a can of Campbells Beefy Mushroom too, we like things saucey! So good!  By nuking the potato slices in the microwave for a few minutes you can cut cooking time alot!  Cover too, that helps. Enjoy this time!

my husband wanted a quick hamburg casserole. I hesitated because I don't normally like that type of meal but it was delicious & my husband asked me to send in my review. ***** rated I did add a bit of garlic powder to add a bit of taste. It was very delicious.

I added 1 cup of sour cream.  The rest I left the same.  This dish is delicious.  This is easy and will definitely find itself in my recipe rotation.  I may add corn to it next time for added veggies.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I doctored this a little by adding mushrooms and sour cream to the sauce.  This was a good meal and will be added to my recipe box.

After much doctoring I still found this recipe to be rather bland and highly greasy.

Great recipe.  It looked a little funky coming out of the oven, but it tasted great.  The two things I added was sauted garlic before I browened the beef and cheddar cheese to the sauce mixture.  I would also add more beef next time.  The huby & kids ate it up!

Yummy & easy! I made a vegetarian version by using faux hamburger soy crumbles in place of hamburger. 

We also microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes. Just enough to give them a jump start in the cooking process; then sliced them.

This was OK.  Warm, filling, and easy to make with ingredients on hand.  I cooked the potatoes first, fried chopped onion and green pepper along with the hamburger, and added soy sauce and about 1/4 cup sour cream to the sauce.  Will make again when short on time.

Simple and satisfying.  Used Cream of Mushroom with Garlic Soup as it caught my eye and also sliced some fresh mushrooms on the top prior to baking. UPDATED REVIEW = Have probably made this a dozen times or more now but last time fried the onions WITH the ground beef as per other reviewer's and topped with Velveeta.  Marvelous!

This is a good, throw-something-together-for supper type recipe.  However, you have to add extra onions, spices and sauce to keep it from being so bland as others have also said.  I also added cut-up celery along with onions and green pepper while frying the hamburger.    The basic recipe is good, but for all these extras, I gave it just 4 stars.

This was very easy and I liked that it called for things most people usually have on hand.  I made it exactly as specified but next time I will add more spices and maybe some mushrooms as some of the other reviewers suggested.  My husband loved it exactly like it was.  I felt like the potatoes got too soft - but I cooked it the entire recommended cooking time and I covered my pan with foil -- so I probably should've cut the time down.  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted Cream of Celery for the Cream of Mushroom soup, and that turned out very well.

There was not enough liquid to cover the ground beef, and so it got a little burnt at the top - I had to stir and smash the ground beef down halfway through the baking to make sure that it wasn't overly cooked on top.

My whole family loved this recipe -- even my picky three-year old.  I sliced carrots and put them on top of the potatoes and added a can of mushrooms.  I also didn't have an onion, but I sprinkled seasoning salt on top of the potatoes also.  Great when you don't have much in the cupboard.

I gave this recipe a horrible review in 2003. I shouldn’t have. I made this tonight seeking a comfort meal and boy, I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve learned a few things since 2003. I covered this dish tightly with foil for the first hour of baking. I uncovered it and baked it for about 15 to 20 minutes longer to crisp the top layer.  I took it out of the oven and sprinkled cheese over  the top and loosely covered it with foil.  As for adding garlic, etc. to the sauce, I did,  but that’s up to the cook.  Also, I may have sliced the potatoes a little thicker than “scalloped”.   It was delicious.

This was a great meal that my husband especially loved.  My pickiest eater (11 year old) even liked it.  My ten year old wasn't thrilled with it, but she's not a fan of hamburger.  I added extra cheese on top, but found it very filling and delicious.

This was okay.  You really have to use LEAN beef.  The hamburger I used was only 85% lean (it's what I had on hand).  I fried it and drained it very well or so I thought.  When the dish baked up there was a lot of grease at the bottom.  It was kind of soupy.  I had added a lot of extra cheese which binded it a little, but it was still greasy.  If I ever make it again I will be sure to use the leanest ground beef possible.  The taste was good, just had an unappealing consistency.

kids liked it. Quality of hamburger used in this recipe makes a big difference in the flavor. I wouldn't use 6 month old freezer meat, save that for your tacos :)

My husband made this for us and it was delicious!  This is a very hearty meal with that stick-to-your-ribs quality.  I didn't find it bland in the least.  The onion and sharp cheddar cheese give this dish loads of flavor.  It's a keeper!

I made this for dinner last night and my kids would not touch it.  My husband and I thought that it was ok, but a little bland.

This was very easy.  I actually used canned sliced potatoes to cut the time down to about 25 min.  For the most part this was ok- it was missing something.  Not one for throwing food away, I heated it up next day and added salt and more salt.  It was better the next day.  I probably won't make this anytime soon.

Pretty tastey for such a short list of ingredients. It caught my eye because I hadn't been shopping in a while and I needed something fast to make w/ limited on-hand ingredients. This one really fit the bill.

It was good. I like a little more flavor, but this is a great base recipe. Like many others, I added more spices, garlic powder, onion salt, a dash of basil and oregano. Not bad! Not bad at all!

I wasn’t impressed. Next time I will add more cream of mushroom soup, finely chopped bell peppers, and more seasoning (cumin and garlic). Also, maybe a small can of cheese soup. Just me opinion

Very easy recipe. I made it tonight! I did however sauté the onions with the hamburger meat, and I seasoned the meat with minced garlic, onion powder, seasoned salt and some basil. I also covered with foil for the 1st hour and the potatoes were cooked and yummy. I topped with cheese and melted and then sprinkled with paprika and parsley. Everyone went back for seconds and there is none left. Great little meal, will add to my arsenal of go to meals.

I made this for as a quickie meal, for my husband, as I have some kind of flu right now and didn't want to get elaborate with dinner.  I could not really taste it, but my husband ate it all up. I guess I will have to make it again to see if *I  like it. lol

We saute the onions with the hamburger and boil the potatoes to 3/4 done, there is no reason this needs to bake for 1.5 hrs. Boil the potatoes while browning your hamburger and it only needs to bake for 25-30 min to heat up and melt the cheese... Also using Velveeta cheese is much creamier...

Very Good Recipe, although it doesn't freeze well. I suggest using dehydrated potato mix if you're going to freeze for later.

I made this, but had to revise a few things. 
I browned the ground beef with the onions, salt & pepper. Drained and sat aside.
I usually always have a can of cream of mushroom soup, but realized I didn’t once I started cooking the meat. BUT, I had some sour cream and a packet of mushroom gravy mix! To a bowl I added a cup of sour cream, the packet of gravy, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, few splashes of milk, salt & pepper and whisked all together.
I layered the sliced potatoes, then the “mushroom mix” I made, ground beef and shredded cheese. 
I did two layers, topped it with cheese, covered it with foil until the last 10 mins of cooking.
We loved it!

Made with cream of chicken soup because hubby doesn't like mushrooms. Needed double the soup mix and had to cook 2x as long in order for the potatoes to be done. I might boil the potatoes so it doesn't take so long to cook. Hubby approved!

As I do with most of the recipes I try here, I read everyone's comments and combine the tips they give to make it better. In this recipe I chopped up some fresh mushrooms and browned them with the meat and onion. I used one can of the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup and one can of beefy mushroom soup. I used 1 of the soup cans filled with milk. I also added a handful of shredded cheddar to the soup mixture. I greased the pan with butter. I layered everything like I was making a lasagna. I went ahead and topped it with more cheddar before baking. As I always do with casserole dishes, I over cook them to make sure that it's done. Nothing more disgusting than an under cooked casserole dish. Especially when it has potatoes in it. I let mine go for about 90 minutes. It came out completely perfect. My wife went back for seconds which means this is a keeper. We got 2 meals out of this with a side of green beans once and a side of fresh steamed broccoli the other. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have any potatoes, did some quick thinking and added leftover mashed potatoes in layers instead, along with leftover mixed veggies from the night before.  Otherwise, I prepared it exactly as the recipe said.

I'm here to tell you the taste was absolutely fabulous, too loose to be a casserole, but the right texture and consistency for a stew.

Next time, I'll make sure I have potatoes on hand and make it the right way.  And I bet it'll be scrumptious.

But the time after that...?  Well, my man and I practically licked the casserole dish clean tonight, so I'm aiming for that result again.  YUM!

I loved it. I gave it a 4 since I did think it needed more added to it, which I did. I added pretty much whatever I had in the kitchen!  Also, if made the way it says to it would take forever without cooking the potatoes a bit first. 
But I'm definitely making again!  It's a keeper.
Kids love it!

I used to make this when I was a teenager for my brothers and I.  Was a different name back then though.  I introduced my husband to this casserole and he LOVED it!  He uses either roast or hamburger for the meat.  For the onion, try using french fried onions!  Awesome flavor and extra spice and consistency.

No changes and yes will make it again (making sure to allow for enough bake time for the potatoes to get cooked all the way. )

This was so yummy. As others have said my family compared it to hamburger helper but better. I used 5 med-large potatoes that I sliced and precooked for 6 minutes in the microwave. Didn’t have cream of mushroom so I made 3 cups of beef broth, added cornstarch to the milk and added it to the broth along with extra spices to our taste. Layered the potatoes and meat and dumped the broth on top. Baked covered 1 hour 15 minutes, added the cheese then 5 minutes uncovered. Fabulous. Just adjust seasonings to your taste.

This is similar to a recipes we had growing up.We called it Lutheran hot dish as it was always served at Lutheran funerals. It had carrots in it also along with more onions and seasonings and was baked in an electric roaster.

It was very easy & it was a hit with my husband. I did add more seasonings & chopped jalapeño peppers to jazz up the flavor. I also used homemade “Cream of” soup, instead of the canned stuff to keep it a bit less processed.

I made this recipe for dinner for the first time the other night for me and my husband. as of right now I will only be giving this recipe 2 stars  because it was just really plain and bland. Don't get me wrong, it was a really cheap and easy recipe to make but it just didn't have any flavor at all. I do believe if you would add extra seasonings to the meat when you are browning it and cook the diced onion with the meat it would give it more flavor. Also salt and pepper the potatoes to taste before layering them in your casserole. If you are more of a onion lover then a mushroom lover, I suggest you use the onion garlic or  onion condensed soup. You could layer your casserole with french style green beans instead of just layering the top of the casserole with cheese.  I would suggest layering the whole casserole with cheese, I thought it tasted much better doing it that way instead of just layering only the top. Be sure to salt and pepper everything to taste.

Very good!!  I did add seasoned pepper, I use it on everything I make.  I also put ketchup on mine and loved it!!  My husband tried ketchup on it and liked it.  He put picante sauce on it the next night and still liked it!!  He said I could make this anytime and to keep the recipe.

This is so good!! I made the recipe exactly as is, but I also added a little garlic and layered some green beans in it. I ended up cooking it about an hour and 45 min, but that could have been cause I cut the potato too thick. Heats up nicely as well for work the next day. Will make this again.

This is just like my old friend Judy's wonderful comfort food casserole but with cheddar added. I always add extra seasoning, always a hit.. Cook first 55 minutes with foil on, last 15 uncovered. Awesome comfort food.Cheese added for last 15, let it sit at least 10 min to set up once done. *food hack- this is also just wonderful without the cheese, add some garlic salt to the soup mix.

OK, this was a last minute dish. I generally followed the recipe. For the milk I used half n' half. I added celery and some zucchini.
And like everyone else I used more spices - simple, e.g. basil, 
home grown tarragon, 1 head of garlic etc.
Very tasty and good.

I  have made this several times and my husband loves it!  Last time I made it, I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cheddar cheese soup.  Flavor was amazing and husband went back for 2nd and 3rd helpings, then asked if I  had enough to fill me up, when I said yes, he finished off the entire casserole. So, modified is now the go to for me!

I jazzed this up a bit by using Italian sausage. I also sauteed the onion with the sausage. I added the mushroom soup, milk and spices into the onion and sausage so only end up dirtying one pan. I also layered cheddar cheese between the sausage/soup mixture and the next potato layer. Cooked covered with foil for 1:15, then removed to brown on top for the last 10 min. Cutting the potatoes thin also helps cut cooking time. My son and I loved this recipe. Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times and never really changed it. Loved it just the way it is.  Today, though, I boiled the potatoes before hand, it just takes too long to cook in oven!  I cooked for forty minutes, put cheese on top and cooked for ten more.  With leftovers, if breakfast time,  I'll add an over easy egg after heated in microwave, and it's DELICIOUS! Try it yourself!

Tasty, reminds me of hobo dinners.  I used nacho cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom, cooked the onion with the ground beef, covered for an hour then sprinkled cheese and put back in the oven till it melted.

It’s not a bad start. I used the slicer part of the grater to make them thin, I also timed this recipe by 5, huge family of all boys. I did add velvetta cheese to the broth, because we all love cheese. It turned really smooth and creamy. The cook time with the thin potato’s was 50 minutes. I also sautéed the onions then cooked it with the meat and other seasonings. Not bad at all.

Family loved it. 
My changes....
Preheat oven to 400
Used Ore-Ida Diced Hash browns (GF) Used GF soup
Coated casserole dish with Olive oil
Layered Diced Hash browns, added hamburger and soup mixture next. Layered drained green beans next. Baked for 30 minutes (recommended cook time on the hash browns).
Added cheddar cheese after 30 minutes and baked another 15 minutes.  Very delicious.

I doubled the recipe.  I'll grant it's not the healthiest thing that I cook but it is one of my two favorite dishes and super easy to put together.  My onions are already cooked with my hamburger meat (I precook several pounds).  I mixed the soup and the milk and put it in a four cup measuring pitcher.  It's much easier to get it all over the mix that way.

I added Garlic and Turmeric to it but otherwise followed the recipe.  This was great and probably would have been still good without my two additions to it.  Next time like others have suggested I will put the cheese on in the last 15 minutes or so it was crisp but not burnt at least when it was done but would have been better if it was stretchy and gooey instead.

the dish needed cooking spray or butter to prevent the potatoes from scorching; the cooked meat dried out in an hour and twenty minutes that it took for the potatoes to become tender, the cheese over the top just looked like i was trying to cover a mistake. I cooked the onions with the meat because it made more sense. The one can of soup w milk didn't seem to be enough. Added salt & pepper over the top of the potatoes to get it right before layering.  Next time I have meat, potatoes, onions, cheese and spare time, I'm making something else.

This is a great meal!  My wife and I love this type of stuff. Sure. I added a couple things just because I had them---four stalks of celery, fresh mushrooms and half a tub of ricotta  cheese. It tasted great!

Made this a couple times and a big hit! Sautéd the onions with cut up bell pepper and a tsp of beef bouillon in olive oil be for adding to soup and milk. I also didn’t peel the potatoes.

Yes,  I made some changes. Recipes in reviews states a blandness. I felt that also so here is what I did. 
 Change hamburger to Jimmy Deans Breakfast Sausage of your liking.  Sage, Original, Turkey, Hot or Mild.  I also used Cream of Potato instead of Cream of Mushroom.  Use your favorite.  Add Tsp. or more of minced Garlic. Last I used 1cup heavy cream for texture.
 I baked at 325 for 1 hour.  Perfect. Your oven may be different. Check in 1 hour and taste test.
 I omitted cheese as I top it as a leftover in the microwave. Doesn't need it anyhow. It's an option.

This is the 2nd time I've made this - it's pretty good and easy. I have a granddaughter that doesn't like mushrooms so I use cream of chicken soup and I add some mixed vegetables (kind of like a reverse shepherds pie) and it turns out great! Everybody likes it and I don't have any left overs.

This is similar to ham and potato recipe I used to make.  I usually have ground beef in freezer so this is easy to make in a hurry without going to store.
I would suggest using ground beef  rather than ground round as the meat becomes drier with leaner meat

I followed others’ advice and added a half packet of onion soup mix and seasoned the ground beef with garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. I also added a can of green chiles and added jalapeño wheels on top. It was really, really good. I wish I would have doubled the recipe for leftovers.

I added frozen corn on each layer and changed the cheese for a mozzarella / parmesan mix because that's what I had on hand. My husband loved it, so yes, I'll make it again. Any recipe that can be put together and popped into the oven for an hour gets my vote!

The only thing I changed was that based on other reviews I added some spice. I added taco spice to the ground beef and it was really really good.
Will definitely make this one again and again.

Very nice and simple...I only used pepper for seasoning...Cheese and soup had more than enough salt...Not at all bland to me..., but it may be to those who have an overly laden salt diet.

Family was okay with it.  A little bland though.  I didn't have plain Cream of Mushroom soup, so I added Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic.   Part way through eating we added either hot sauce or salsa to give it more flavor.

I roasted the potatoes ahead of time in the skillet after browning the hamburger. I put the onions in with them and added minced garlic. It helped cut down on baking time in the oven and added some flavor! I will make this again!

Add celery seed and garlic next time.  I grew up with boring and bland food in the midwest as my father is extremely picky.   This would fit that bland bill but I've learned these are a great basis to build off of.  I used more ground beef than what it called for.  I used about 1/4 tsp black pepper and same on salt.  I'd probably add a little salt to when cooking the ground beef and maybe just a pinch then in the soup mixture.  May also add in sliced or diced mushrooms.

Hi,  I think this is a good basic hamburger casserole recipe  but as prepared not very flavorful.   After reading some of the reviews I got a lot of good ideas on how to improve it.  For the sauce  I added a packet of brown gravy and about of cup of frozen carrot/ peas microwaved.   I prepared the meat by first  cooking  5 half strips of bacon, add onion then about a pound and a half of 85% HamB, then a small can of mushrooms, salt,  saute til cooked and drain excess fat.  I layer starting with potato, sauce, meat ending in meat.  Cooked covered in glass dish for 1 hour 30. Add cheese to the top, cover and return to oven and turn off oven.   In fifteen minutes your full dinner is ready.  BTW I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, it is very effective in producing thin even slices.

My Family went crazy over this!!! I tweaked it a bit. Used some heavy cream in the recipe and more cheese and added bacon. But it’s so easy and was a HUGE crowd pleaser and I think it was even better the next day!! Actually making this again tonight using some barbecue bacon!!

Very easy to make and a wonderful dish. I use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and it adds another layer of flavor! It is very simple very good and very filling! I do recommend letting cool a little and that will let it thicken up to the perfect consistency. I also use better than beef bullion paste to season the burger and it is very tasty!

I was really looking forward to trying this and made it right by the directions except leaving out the onions as my family does not like them. I was disappointed in how bland it is! It is good but just blah no kick!! I added some red pepper flakes to my serving and it was better. I still want to try this again and try to improve it, adding garlic, green peppers, red pepper flakes and mushrooms next time!!!

I didn't have much in the frig to make anything, so I thought. My husband is full-blooded Norwegian and loves his potatoes. This is the first time he ate leftovers not once but twice. So easy to make and flavorful.

Only gave a 4 because I did modify based on the reviews and after tasting the wet ingredients together.  It was a hit for sure and will definitely make again.  My changes, added one packet of French onion soup mix (dry) to the wet ingredients and added fresh garlic and then after the addition of the cheese at the end of baking I also added velveeta to melt because the potatoes on top were crispy like chips and the meat directly below it seemed really dry and it did help it but next time I think I will cover it and not let the potatoes get like potato chips.

I'm giving this  four stars because I heeded other cooks advice and added  additional seasonings...with those additions it rates 5 stars! I added garlic,  portabella mushrooms, extra onion, and a can of diced green chiles.  I parboiled the potatoes before assembling the casserole, and cut the cheese to reduce the fat. I baked it uncovered for about an hour. The green chiles really gave it some zip and made this recipe a keeper.

I am going to give this one another shot, because I think I just had the potatoes sliced too thin, so it was very heavy on the potato taste, and the sauce didn't permeate it well.  So the warning here is not to get the potatoes too thin  or they just clump together.

Fabulous everyone enjoyed it. I agree with other reviewers i made it with the cheese but it does not need it. I put peas in it for something green. Definitely will make again. You can double this easily.

If I could give this 0 stars I would.  Followed directions to a t and what I got was a runny flavorless hamburger and potato soup. Threw it back on stove made a gravy with the massive amount of liquid it produced and salvaged it.

This came out drier than I thought it should.  It has good flavor, but I think it would be better with an extra can of "cream of" soup, either mushroom or onion.

Made some changes to the recipe to suit our family.  Substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of celery.  Added chopped garlic, red pepper, chives, and bacon to the ground beef.  Then once it was put together and cooked I added jalapeños and sour cream to the top.  It was delicious.  Will be making this again!

I agree with the others on more seasonings,  garlic and red pepper flakes made my hamburger yummy. I used cream of cheddar cheese soup cause it was all I had, and great call on a layer of green beans in the middle, yum!

I'm a pretty good cook and this recipe looked like something my husband and I would like. It was awful. I baked It in a glass baking dish which was fortunate because when I took it out of the oven the potatoes were still raw. I had to microwave it. It was really soupy so I added breadcrumbs on top to absorb some of the liquid and baked it 15 more minutes. Still soupy. Added more cheese and baked it 10 more minutes. Nothing could save it. I should have just made hamburger steaks  and French fries with the ingredients I wasted on this casserole.

This dish was delicious, and very easy to make! I altered it slightly by using diced potatoes instead of sliced potatoes, and I added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the soup mix.

Had to improvise with the soup..used cream of chicken & mushroom. We also added more cheese and waited to put it on in the last 15mins. My husband loved this & requested it be made again. This was very easy to throw together.

Was a huge hit with my family, even 8 year old granddaughter who doesn't like potatoes too much asked for seconds. But don't like mushrooms so I used cream of Chicken to substitute and added a little cheese with each layer. I also altered the last layer to potatoes, meat and then the mixture in fear that the meat would dry out. Glad I did! Covered with foil and cooked on 400 for 1 hour. OMG so good!

Great starter meal, but if you want to add some zest to it. About a clove of garlic (minced) a hint of chili powder to taste and red onion to sauté with ground beef. Instead of regular Idaho potatoes, use sweet potatoes. And  For the cheese, use parmasan and provolone, and put the oven to broiler for two minutes to crisp up the cheese.

Turned out great. I used cream of chicken soup because I dont  like mushrooms and almond milk because it was what I had. I would have put some cheese in the cream sauce to add more melty-ness. Tasted great.

I used potato o'brien potatoes and used less milk becuase I felt that it was too soupy. With a whole bag of the potatoes I would have used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup.

I will make this often. My grandkids loved it and I can add some veggies. I did season the hamburger with Worcestershire salt and pepper. Also added garlic and shredded green peppers to the soup mix. Baked in a 13 x 9 pan and covered with foil for about half the cooking time. Added a little more cheese to cover the entire dish well. Everything came out perfect.

I made it once as written, and it was tasty; made it a second time and tweaked it and loved it.  I left the skin on the potatoes, doubled the amount of onions (and sautéed them in olive oil til they were nice and brown before adding to the meat) used cream of golden mushroom and cream of chicken, and added lots of extra seasonings like garlic & onion powder, thyme, a dash of smoke flavoring.  This is a fun recipe to play with.  I’ll probably make different tweaks each time I make it.  Oh, and I crocked it.

I made this as stated, except for a couple of minor changes. I sautéed the onion with the hamburger, along with minced garlic, and I used canned evaporated milk (undiluted).
It definitely is tasty comfort food, but rather bland. I think next time I will increase the cheese (maybe stirring it into the casserole) and use half sausage and half hamburger. 
Has anyone made it without cooking the hamburger first? Surely it would cook while in the oven, and the resultant drippings into the potatoes sound good...

Turned out very good.  I ended up adding more cheese (my guys LOVE cheese!) and instead of slicing the potatoes, I cubed them and they turned out just fine.

Do not pay any attention to negative reviews. This was SO good. The only thing i did different was add one extra can of red ench sauce and some shredded zuch. It was amazing and so easy. I am making again tonight. I used flour tortillas because that is all I had. Oh and I used cottage instead of ricotta. Very yummy

I didnt use mushroom anything because I have so many who dont like them in the house. I made a strogonoff sauce with the ground beef instead. Added garlic powder and paprika. Layered with a tiny bit of cheddar in between sauce and potatoes then topped with bacon I chopped fine and fried and a little parsley. Was amazing! Happy family!

Gave it a 4 on the original ingredients.  I seasoned the meat a bit more with garlic and a few other spices.. Gardnished with Italian parsley  and Mexican blended cheese. Will do it again with possibly other ingredients.

We loved this recipe for it's simplicity and it's comfort food appeal. I added sliced carrots and garlic powder, otherwise we enjoyed it as written.

I had NO trouble getting my 2 and a half year old to DEVOUR this meal. So quick and easy and even my good ol' dad came back for seconds. A few things I changed was to cover the pan with tin foil so the potatoes don't dry out, next time I will remove the tinfoil the last 15 minutes before adding the cheese to crisp up the taters a bit. I used the more mild green onion and next time I will season the beef a little and saute a few fresh mushrooms with it as suggested by a few others. Might add a bit more cheese in with the layers as well. I've been looking for a good Sheppard's Pie recipe, this one is very close and SO much easier.

I only made two small changes.  I added three slices of chopped bacon to ground turkey instead of hamburger because I don't eat hamburger. My husband said it was the best thing I ever made! Haha! He says that every time he loves a dish. I will make it again.

I made this casserole exactly as written for my family, and they all enjoyed it. Comfort food at its best. The only suggestion for improvement I would make is to cover the casserole with foil  before baking, or the top later of meat dries out. When I checked the dish for doneness at one hour, the hamburger on top was crispy and dry. I added foil for the last half hour of baking, then added the cheese to melt and it salvaged the meat. The kids did not notice that the meat was almost ruined, and the foil and cheese helped to restore some of the moisture to the meat. 

Although my family which usually prefers spicy food, thought this was great as written, you could easily spice it up a bit with your favorite seasonings or additional vegetables like chopped bell peppers, but it was delicious just the way it was  presented in the recipe. Thank you!

I added Green Beans... I was out of Basil so I added some Paprika and probably way more garlic salt. I added a touch of onion powder too. Sautéed the potatoes and onions to cut down on the cook time. Covering with tin foil definitely helped it all cook better too! Delicious - I’ll definitely make it again!

Very nice & easy recipe as is although perhaps a tad bland (can see why it'd be a kid favorite).  My husband also loved it and asked that it be added to our regular menu rotation so here's what I've done to make everyone in our family happy:  Doubled the recipe using 5-6 cups sliced taters, one cream of celery and one cream of chicken ( yes, chicken really does work very well with beef) and only one cup of milk.  Kept the beef to one pound and spiced it up with extra garlic and onion (either fresh or powdered) along with a half teaspoon or so of celery seed and salt.  Layered much like a lasagna with thin layer of soup in very bottom of 9"x13"" pan and then potatoes with another thin layer of soup over that.  Burger and choice of  veggie up next with choice of cheese lightly sprinkled over; continued layering thusly and  topped with beef & cheese.  Covered with tinfoil and baked for one hour at 400 degrees.  As is, this recipe is a super solid 4 stars but with our preference changes, we now rate a fabulous 5!

It is very good. Added onion powder, garlic powder, minced garlic, salt and pepper to the ground beef while it cooked. Also added salt and pepper in the mixture. It only took one hour to cook. Sliced potatoes super thin though. Does taste like shepherds pie.

This is an easy recipie to make, but my husband thought it was disgusting.  "Needs a lot more flavor" and I had to agree.  A little powered garlic woul help a lot with a little rated cheese on top would also help this dish, although I probably wwill not make it again.

I read the comments and being from South Texas I headed the reviewers that suggested it needed some spicing up.  I ended up adding garlic, onion powder, onion soup, and a small can of Hatch green chilies.  It came out really good so someone needs to add the ingredients and rename the recipe

At all. Need to season the meat very well next time and I would also season the potatoes and mix the sauce with the beef and then pour it on the potatoes before baking. 
After reading the reviews, found so many added this and that this. This recipe as is is not 4 or 5 stars. A lot of us follow recipes to the T so giving 4 stars to a recipe you changed so much is not accurate.

This was a great family/kiddo hit. Like another reviewer I used the crockpot to cook it. I also added an envelope of french onion soup mix to the meat then layered it all in the crockpot including a bag of frozen mixed veggies. Super easy, inexpensive meal with enough to pack for lunches tomorrow.

I made this and it was a total and complete waste of ingredients.  If I ever get desperate enough to try it again I will use spicy pork sausage and lots of salt.  Potatoes call for lots of salt.  Move on.  Don't make it.

I made this recipe and used a few extra potatoes, changed the soup to Cream of Bacon as this was all that I had at the time. I did use the aluminum foil and cooked it for 50 minutes, then put the cup of cheese (which I would use more next time) and continue baking it until the cheese is melted. I would use less onion and possible put some garlic or other spices as well.

I WOULD DEFINETLY MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.

My 9 and 10 year old loved this!   I found this recipe as I had ground beef and potatoes that needed to be used.   I used shallots versus onions (that's all I had) and substituted Cream of Potato soup as I didn't have the cream of mushroom.  Added garlic based on some of the other reviews and threw it in a cast iron dutch oven.   Not much left over as my 9 year old son had thirds...thanks for the recipe

We LOOOOVE this recipe. When I found it we ate it probably twice a week!

Small changes I made: I use 1.5 pounds of ground beef because we like our food meaty. I made the first layer of potatoes a dull layer but the 2nd and 3rd layers I was a little more sparse. I used too many potatoes once and it overwhelmed the flavor of the other ingredients. I also don't measure the cheese. I just spread enough to cover it. Bake it covered in tin foil for an hour and then I remover the foil, add the cheese, & pop it back in the oven for 5 minutes to melt it. 

Then it's meaty, ooey, gooey, cheesy heaven!

this is comfort food at its finest. No need to whip out a box of Hamburger Helper when you can go for the real deal. you can feel the quality of the ingredients versus a box. This is a easy tasty recipe. It's one of my go-to is especially when it's a comfort food night.

Nice and easy.  To make it easier, I dice and boil the potatoes, then just mix and baked to melt the cheese.  Quicker than layering and waiting for potatoes to bake.  If doubling the recipe, I'll do one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftovers and this fit the bill.  Leftover gravy replaced the soup,  Au gratin potatoes already had the cheese,  and I added in the leftover asparagus too.   The recipe is fast and easy, and I'll be making it again.

Great quick hearty meal! I just add extra seasonings that we typically favor. I love using gold potatoes for this and I cubed them instead. Works great with chicken or deer as well!

One of the all time great "comfort food" dishes - and this recipe hits the mark. This goes together quickly, especially using a food processor for slicing potatoes to cut down prep time and ensure uniform slice thickness. I followed the recipe, however, did add diced garlic to saute with the ground beef and onions and a couple dashes of Worcestire sauce to the milk mixture. I covered with foil for the initial baking, but removed it when I added the cheese topping. The creamy sauce, softened potato slices, hearty ground beef and browned, melted cheddar cheese all came together in a warm, wonderful belly-filling way - YUMMY!  This is simple, inexpensive, uses common pantry/kitchen ingredients and turns out great, you can't do better than this!

I will make this recipe again using the suggestions for adding additional spices and vegetables. I did not add cheese. Our family makes a quick and easy version of this in a large fry pan. Fry hamburger and onions, salt, pepper, garlic. Add diced potatoes to the pan. Then  adding enough water to cover and cook the potatoes. Once the potatoes are cooked thicken with a little cornstarch mixed with water. Easy and a very quick meal when you have hungry kids coming through the door after school and heading back out for  sports.

As I am recently retired I have become a house husband. i have always loved to cook and now I have the time. We had 1 lb of ground beef and little else. I didn't want to settle for hamburger.
This was easy. My wife loved it and she told me to put it in our "regular" dinner list. A last minute off the cuff meal that was a big hit. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this because I was sick of the same old hamburger recipies. I added more garlic powder and onion than it called for. I also added Lowery's seasoned salt. I put a light layer of shredded sharp cheddar between one of the layers.  I substituted cream of onion soup. Next time I'll use cream of celery. The taste of onion was a little too pronounced. I covered it tightly in foil and it cooked in 50 minutes. I put a layer of sharp cheddar  on the top and let it cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes. We loved it!

I made onions and browned meat together, and cooked about 50 minutes +10 with the cheese.  It cooked potatos ok but I think could have gone a full hour.  I? baked uncovered.  It turned out well, I? like it, but needed a few spices more.  More salt maybe, I? think one person said she used Lipton dry soup.  Sounds yummy!

Followed the recipe exactly except I was running out time so I boiled the potatoes and then made it.  I cooked it for about 53 minutes then added the cheese.  It was very yummy but next time I think I will flavor the ground beef and possibly put it in the liquid mixture before layering with the potatoes.  I may add a touch of sour cream to the liquid mixture also.

Great recipe. Takes a bit of time so good for a Sunday dinner with leftovers for taking to work.  I used ground turkey and added mushrooms. Otherwise, pretty true to the recipe. I did double the recipe and if I did it again,I would add a layer of cheese at each layer instead of just the top.  Yummy!

I made this for myself and 16-year-old son. I just finished my first helping, but I'll be going back for a little more. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup and don't like mushrooms, so I made a bechamel (white sauce) instead. I also didn't have cheddar, so I topped with a taco blend. My kid is a very neutral and unopinionated type and even he expressed liking it. I'll definitely be making it again.

It turned all all hard and dry . Will not be making again. Sorry. I added more spices but it was so dry and burnt up on the bottom I'm probably going to have to toss it out, but at least my potatoes were done. Lol.

It was a lot like Shepherds pie. I did cook the onions with the meat.  I also added lots of garlic and other seasonings. It was good but not what I was expecting. Very easy to make. And little clean up. I kept it uncovered and it turned out good.

It could use a little twaeking, a bit more flavor and 1 can of thecream of mushroom soup isn't enough.  Otherwise on point it was still good.

Family loved this casserole and I will definitely be making this again! There are a few very minor changes I would make to suit our tastes...1. I would lightly salt each layer potatoes 2. I would add a handful of cheddar cheese to each layer...just to make it a little cheesier, although it was also good just following the recipe.

I made it according to the recipe. Good and fairly easy to prepare. Cutting the potatoes was a little time consuming. It did need a little more flavor when it was done. I added garlic salt. I did follow one persons advice and covered the dish with foil for the first 1 hour and 15 minutes. I then uncovered and added more cheese to the top and put it back in the oven uncovered. Only a single serve portion left between 5 of us. I did split the recipe between 2 8x8 dishes. One for now and one for later.

Yummy and quick but I needed to add some spice. Added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and sprinkled on Slap Yer Mama Cajun seasoning (we live in Louisiana, no spice is sacrilege) along with 8 oz of chopped mushrooms. I like some of the other additions that were mentioned. I'll have to try them.

Made in the late evening to go with morning eggs and coffee. It used a whole small onion and added Lawrys seasoning along with garlic powder, some Sriracha pepper seasoning. The potatoes were super thin. Sharp Cheddar for covering and it was fantastic. Also added extra black pepper but I like a little kick. Only one that didn't like was my 10 year old who is one finicky kid.

This is almost identical to a dish my mom made for our family many, many years ago. We loved it. Only difference, she made her own white sauce. You need lots of onions, and whatever other flavors your family prefers. It is easy to personalize.

It was okay. The burger I used was organic and 90% lean. It made the dish bland.  I might try it again with veal and more spices.

I went by the recipe except  I added some ground sausage for a little bite and I heated my mushroom soup on the stove and added a little milk and cheese to it.  It made it cheesy throughout  and made it easy to pour evenly over entire dish.  Fell in love with it and can't wait to make it again!

A quick scan of the ingredients revealed I'd need to season to taste with this recipe. Also, I had to make a few substitutions since the pantry was nearing empty (a grocery trip is imminent!) That said, I subbed maple-flavored sausage for the hamburger and browned it along with 1/2 of a chopped onion. I also added seasonings to taste, as I generally do when browning meat. I sliced my golden creamer potatoes paper-thin, as I'd taken note of many of the previous reviews that stated they weren't done after the allotted baking time. I didn't have any canned soup, so I had to sub a packet of country sausage gravy. Also out of milk (I know, I know), I used a cup of half & half and a cup of unsweetened almond milk mixed in with the gravy packet. I mixed the sausage, potatoes, gravy mix as well as a couple handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese and French fried onions together in a large bowl until well combined and then spread it into a greased 9x13" baking dish. I topped the casserole with some additional cheese and covered with foil (I knew the cheese would provide extra moisture while "steaming" the potatoes under the foil). I  baked for 1 hour at 350 and then uncovered for an additional 15 minutes to ensure done potatoes. I added a few additional French-fried onions the last 2 minutes and set the oven to broil on low.  I let the casserole rest for 10 minutes after removing from the oven and the potatoes were perfect!  I will definitely make this casserole again!

Hard to rate because I changed some important parts. When I first read the recipe my thought was, "this is the kids version". So I set out to make the adult version and it turned out great. I wish I could say it was brain surgery but it wasn't. I switched the ground beef to pork sausage and I added two good size cloves of garlic chopped. I sauteed the onion and garlic in a little olive oil before adding the sausage. Then I followed the recipe. Really good.

This was so good!!  It is rare that I make something that my whole family raves about but this dish was a hit!!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to cook the onions along with the beef as I like them well done.  Great comfort food!

This is a great basic recipe and I did make a few changes. I diced up a large carrot, and a stalk of celery in addition to the onion and potatoes. I also added a 4 oz. can of drained sliced mushrooms. I didn't think It had enough liquid with just the one can of soup and milk so I added a half can of cream of celery soup and an additional 1/2 cup of milk. For seasoning I added 2 teaspoons of beef bouillon granuals but left out the salt. My husband absolutely loved this dish. I made it in the morning so it was ready to pop in the oven when we got off work

I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery and added a packet of beef bouillon. The top layer of  the beef got a little overcooked even with tin foil. My fault though. I think next time I am going to put cheese as a layer. Not a bad recipe.

This is a wonderful basic recipe! I added celery, carrots, anaheim chili and more spices to kick it up and it was wonderful. It would be easy to make and good the way it is written but we wanted more vegies and found it delicious!

I made this because I already had the ingredients for it.  And it was okay.  I made it following the directions and made no changes.  And it tasted fine but a little bland.  I was tempted to at least some garlic and onion powder but I wanted to be true to the recipe the first time I made it.  I think this could be better with some added spices to give a bit more flavor.  Which is what I will do if I ever make this again.

OK, I liked it but my DH didn't. I had added a lot of chopped onion to the beef and jazzed up the mushroom soup with onion soup mix and garlic. For some reason, it didn't click with him...I sure thought he would like it.

I do not read or would I give a rating if it wasn't done as called for. At all times you people may "tweak" to your hearts content but keep it to yourself. Easy and a good comfort food. Thanks for the good idea.

We enjoyed this dish.  It was hearty and tasty, as well.  Next time, I will use turkey burger or drain my lean ground beef well, before the baking stage, as it was a little greasy for my liking.  Also, I added beef broth to the soup and just 2 T. of milk and a little ketchup. All-in-all the great recipe!

Great basic recipe that you can make your own!  I added fresh diced onions and Italian seasonings to the browning of the meat. I layered it similar to recipe except that on the first layer of meat, I added 1 can French style green beans, fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced tomatoes with a sprinkling of shredded Mexican cheese on top. Next was the last layer of meat, then the soup mixture topped all.

This was real comfort food!  My whole family enjoyed it. I did season the ground chuck I used with onion, basil, garlic, salt, pepper and another seasoning blend with Parmesan cheese.  It was so good but next time I might add green beans to the mix.

My picky-eater husband really enjoyed it, as did our 3 kids. Instead of using a cream soup, I used pureed carrots and they didn't even know it.  I'm going to make it again but with a couple of changes; no salt, use garlic & add more onion.

I made it exactly per the recipe. It was good, and I will be making again. But I have to agree with prior reviews and double the sauce and add a little more seasoning. But that's just my families personal preference.

I agree that it is on the bland side, but that was OK with my husband and me.  I added salt, pepper and a little garlic powder to the beef as I was browning it.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 dish & needed more than 3 cups of potatoes.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and covered the dish with foil for an hour, took it out, sprinkled the cheese on it then let it bake for 15 minutes without the foil.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly.  I will make it again, next time I will add a can of sliced mushrooms as my husband and I like them.

This was great! Used leftover Taco meat, added some smoked paprika to the soup mix and put shredded cheddar between each layer. Will definitely make again.

Pretty good with seasonings. I seasoned the ground beef with onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, S&P, and a couple TBs of Worcestershire. Added lightly sauteed onions and mushrooms to gr beef before layering. Used 1c milk, added two big spoonfuls of sour cream and a heaping tablespoon of dry onion soup mix and a few grinds of pepper to the sauce. Layered variety of cheeses before adding the sauce in each layer. Also seasoned the potatoes before topping them each time. Used 9x13. Leftovers heat well.

My only substitution was using dehydrated potato slices instead of fresh.  Added about 1/3 cup chopped Portobello mushrooms & 1/2 tsp Penzey's roasted garlic powder. Delicious!

This is a basic, good place-to-start, hamburger and potato casserole. As written, the recipe is very bland, but is easily bumped up with minced jalapeños, salsa, or the like.  Also, leaving the mixture uncovered in the oven will dry out  the hamburger meat, long before the potatoes are done. I'd suggest covering the dish with aluminum foil while in the oven and only removing at the end when melting the cheese.

I made this for my picky 14 yr old daughter and her friend. I basically followed the recipe except they we're starving, so I microwaved the potatoes until they were almost done. Then I followed the rest of the recipe. Didn't take near as long to cook.

I microwaved the potatoes just before slicing so the cooking time was reduced to about 25 minutes, and added some crushed garlic along with the onions when frying the hamburger but otherwise followed the recipe.  My 7-year old ate three helpings, so this recipe will be a keeper!  I'll probably make more of the sauce next time because I like lots of gravy.

Great comfort food! I cooked it in an 8x8 and covered the dish with foil. I added garlic powder to the ground beef and cooked the onions with it. I also added a can of corn and lots of extra cheese. We enjoyed this.

This was a very simple recipe to follow, especially for a beginner like me.  My boyfriend LOVED it.  I took the advice from the previous reviews to add additional spices like garlic/onion powder, dried parsley, basil, and dried cilantro.  Definitely cover it with tin foil, as it kept everything moist.

I made it tonight and it was a hit! I am pretty decent at cooking,  and this was fun and easy to prepare. It's bland in the best way, great for people with acid reflux or sensitive tummies. You can do so much to this recipe to make it "more exciting" but I think it's just fine the way it is for my family and I.

After reading the previous reviews and being a experienced cook, I tweeked the hell out of this recipe.  I added the milk not as much, velvetta and sharp cheddar and some smoked gouda.   I diced up red and green bell peppers,  green onions and fresh garlic.  I also had to throw in that good ole Lawry's seasoning salt,  garlic power and a touch of onion powder.  I also pre boiled half way the potatos.   end result no leftovers.

I made this twice with same results both times.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and it didn't help much.  Not much flavor and the potatoes were not done.  Needs to cook longer.  Will not make again.

I'm new to cooking but always enjoyed it. This was extremely easy to make and easy to prep. Very inexpensive as well! I'm going to eat this tonight with the family then I'll remake it tomorrow to fix any errors and send some to the neighbors.

Seasonings are definatly needed for this recipe. just following the directions was not working. I ended up having to cook  it for around 4 and a half hours before the potatoes were cooked through. the flavors were there though so I will make again but next time I think I will try in the slow cooker as suggested.

Based on other reviews I did add some spices that I thought looked good. I think if you keep to the spices you know you enjoy it will be great! I cooked mine with foil for one hour, then turned the oven to warm as we had some serious time till dinner. About 1/2 hour head, we added the cheese and put it back in the warm oven without the foil. It was perfect when served. Really very tasty and so easy! We will be having this again!

I took the advice of one reviewer and added creamed corn. Unfortunately that made it too soupy, so next time I'll add a drained can of regular corn. I put it all in the crock pot on low for 10 hours and it turned out great. My 6 yr old ate it, which is a plus. It definitely needs the salt and pepper but it is a good, simple recipe. I put the cheese on top and it got a little brown, so maybe the cheese could go at the very end for the last hour or so.

The second time I made this, the meat got a little crunchy, so next time I'll cover the pan until the end when the cheese goes on. I added frozen corn and should have increased the yogurt (in place of the sour cream).

Pretty easy meal to prepare.  I prepared this ahead of time and pulled it out of the refrigerator to cook later in the day.  I added some onions to the ground beef mixture for a little bit of extra flavor.  Very tasty "comfort meal".

My husband and I liked this recipe.  Nothing fancy but easy, ingredients on hand, and filling.  I stayed true to the recipe but cooked the onion with the ground beef and added some garlic powder.  I also added approximately 1/3 cup of sour cream to the soup and milk mixture.  Finally, to make it easy on myself,  i mixed the ground beef  and onions into the soup mixture and layered with potatoes.  Definitely comfort food.

I made it mostly as per recipe, except that I used Greek yogurt for part of the milk and added some garlic and parsley. I baked it with the cover on for most of the time.  Seemed a bit watery, so I mixed some cornstarch/water mix and stirred it in to thicken a bit and then put on the cheese for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  It came out great.  Will make this a regular dish in our home.

The recipe is basic and a good starting point to add one's own touches. Its flavor needs a boost so I added extra seasonings, mushrooms and green beans. I will make it again and, as suggested by another reviewer,  add 1/2 packet of onion soup mix.

I made this last night.  I added fresh garlic, onion and red bell pepper chopped to the meat, before cooking.
 
It was gone in five minutes.  No leftovers

This was loved by my family. 
I made it following the directions however,  I pre-seasoned the hamburger with herbs and spices. Also followed the directions of some reviews by adding mushroom soup mix. 
Next time will increase the amount of mince. That's because my kids love meat. 
Will definitely make it again.

Comfort food, made it on a cold day.  My picky eater said I can make it again.  I took what others commented and added a bit more garlic and spices.  Will make it again, I covered it during the cooking process, one hour then added the cheese uncovered for 10min.  It was cooked through.

I only had cream of bacon soup on hand so I had to use that.  What a great substitution that turned out to be!  The kids want me to make it again, myhusband says I  should make a double batch.

This was a good recipe thanks for sharing.  I eliminated the cheese because I didn't see a need.  I use cream of mushroom soup and it was good I season my ground turkey and my potatoes before cooking.  I then add frozen green peas and carrots and it was awesome.  The cooking time was longer though probably because my dish was more than the recipe.  But it was good thanks again for sharing.

I made this recipe as is to see how it tastes. It's fulfilling and I will be making it again. When I do, I'll probably tweak it a little just to add my own spin on it.

Omg such a simple recipe but loaded with goodness! My husband came home from work and saw the casserole and just kind of looked at it like oh OK, but once he sank his teeth into it, he was hooked! I served it with a salad and crusty bread and he had a second serving of it! I will definitely be making this again.  It's a keeper!

I tried to Doctor this dish up as suggested and still found it to be a little bland.  It was ok but I prob won't make this recipe again. Perhaps if I used sausage instead of hamburger....

For some extra seasoning I added a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, as apposed to regular. It was very easy to double the recipe because I used a mandoline for cutting the potatoes. Definitely will make this again.

Finicky husband liked it, a good basic dish, and like other reviewers, I added a few more spices like onion powder, garlic powder and ground celery seed to wake it up a bit .....  I also added cheese to each layer, and would double the ground beef next time.

I have made this only I added french cut green beans.  I layered it with the potatoes first then cooked hamburger then green beans and when potatoes were done I added the cheese until melted.  It has always been a favorite and quick meal for our family.

This is very good as is but lacked a little something.  The second time I made it I added garlic and a couple of splashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  Very comforting and delicious.

I made it just as it was. My husband is from Germany & very picky about his food. Then he lived up north. I am a southern girl born and bred so our differences in food have been many. He liked this recipe. I didn't change a thing although I agree wrapping in tinfoil for 50 minutes or so is a good idea & I love the idea of cooking the potatoes a bit in the microwave.

Make this but added corn,rotel, gralic, and cayenne pepper to the meat. Very good and made it like that because the first time I tried it while being good was a bit bland for my taste. Simple and good.

I am giving this 4 stars because made as is it is bland, but it a great base recipe to "make your own". I cook an onion with the hamburger.  I add sour cream, garlic, parmesan,  and beef bouillon to the soup mixture.  I also add a layer of american  cheese in the middle. There are lots of possibilities with this recipe.

Kids loved it.  I did as some others suggested and cooked meat with onion and garlic. I added a few tablespoons of sour cream to the soup/milk.  Also used frozen, diced potatoes which made it super easy!!!

This is a great recipe. I did adjust a little to suit our taste but it's good without changing a thing. I added a little chili sauce, garlic powder,  1/2 of the onion to the meat, pepper and a small can of chopped green chili to the meat while cooking.  I also added another 1/2 can of soup to the soup mix. I seasoned my soup mix with the other half of  fresh onion and a few spices. Layered potato,  sauce, hamburger, shredded cheese and repeated.  I covered loosely and baked as directed. My family loved it, there were no left overs.  You can top with a touch of sour cream if desired.

This turned out so good! The only things I altered was I mixed the soup/milk mixture in with the beef (which I added extra seasonings to) and I doubled the cheese because 1 cup just didn't seem like enough to me. I sliced the potatoes very very thin and covered the dish with aluminum foil and they were tender after an hour of cooking. It was a hit with the family and I will be making it again.

I really like this recipe because it reminds me of the comfort food my mom used to make.  Like many others I added spices to suit our tastes and I think it would have been fairly bland without them.  I had to make this gluten free so I made Glen's Cheese Sauce from this site to use in place of the cream of mushroom soup.  It's pretty thick so after it was off the stove I added more milk to make it the right consistency for the casserole. It worked really well. I also added green beans and next time I think I'll throw in some corn as well.  It's one of those dishes you can switch up easily depending on what you have on hand.  Thanks!

Ok, let me start by saying this is a pretty good not at all quick to bake casserole.. with that having been said it's not bad. Though it is QUITE bland. Some alterations to this recipe would be much needed. First, I used Cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, I doubled the sauce. I would HIGHLY recommend adding a layer of shredded cheese to the middle layer too I think not would give it some extra flavor. This is a keeper though. It's a great kid friendly recipe.

I've made this several ways. It is one of my husbands fav's. I have added green chillies, mushrooms, always onion and garlic powders, etc. A great dish to leave to your imagination.  It'll be used in our home for days to come. I usually cover the dish till cheese time.

I made this tonight and only changed it by seasoning the meat to my liking. It was great. It's a casserole, like au gratin potatoes sort of thing. Kid friendly and hearty. Meat and potatoes, hard to go wrong! Will make again. (COVER IT!!! I Used a dutch oven)

Great recipe! The only alteration I made was that I caramelized the onions before I added them to the soup mixture. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The family LOVED it!

You could adjust this recipe in many ways to make it your own and just the way it is would be a lovely thing to take to a potluck where tastes are varied and you can't do anything too salty or spicy. Next time I'd do some adjustments with herbs, spices or some sriracha just to take it up a notch.

Not bad at all and it fills my husband up.  I did make on change.  Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used cheddar cheese soup.  I don't use cream of mushroom soup in anything.  Can't stand the stuff!

I made this recipe with leftover taco meat.  I sauteed the onions with a little bit of green bell peppers and garlic.  I added the soup to the sauteed onion mixture add the taco meat.  I did two layers: potatoes/soup meat mixture/potatoes/soup meat mixture then added enough (thin) layer of potatoes topped with cheese, covered with foil.  Cooked as directed removed foil last 5 mins and broiled until golden brown.  Remove from oven and let stand for 10-15 minutes before serving.  Everyone had two servings!  A keeper recipe and I'll made it for a crowd (pleaser).

This recipe as written is ok, but bland. I've made it several times now and have tweaked it a little here and there to fit our tastes. Beef onion soup mix is a must! Also, I like placing onions and fresh garlic in with the meat as it cooks. Trust me, no matter what else you choose to add, those 3 simple things are a must! Don't give up on this recipe, just give it your own personal touches. ;)

I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I added a little bit of hot sauce to the mixture. Also added paprika and garlic salt seasoning to the meat. It was delicious! Sprinkle a little cheese in each layer too.

This makes a tasty meal if you add a little seasoning as you go. I added about 1/4 t of pepper, 1/4 t of seasoned salt, and 1/2 t of onion powder to the beef as it was browning. I also sprinkled a little paprika on each layer of potatoes. I took the recipe a step further and poured a can of condensed cheese soup on the bottom of the casserole dish; the cheese bubbled up nicely throughout the dish. I covered my dish with foil and baked for about an hour and 10 mins. Then I removed the foil and sprinkled on the cheese and baked for another 5 mins.

With a couple of tweaks, this is delicious! I cooked the onion along with my beef, which I seasoned liberally with Lawry's. I hit the soup hard with some black pepper, and layered as directed.

My husband ADORES this - for the first time in almost three years of my cooking, he says I made something that tastes like "a Mom dinner." His mom is big into cream of mushroom soup. ;)

But even without those rose-colored glasses of memory, I thought this was hearty, delicious, and perfect for cold weather.

I cooked it as suggested and it was dry. My cheese burnt. I will cook it again but put the cheese on for only 5 minutes or so and I would use sour cream instead of milk. Possibly add more ingredients as some have suggested in the reviews.

Great recipe! The biggest problem was the potatoes would not cook. So the next time I cooked this for the family, I made several baked potatoes, let them cool down then hand cut them. This helped the cook time from an hour to about 30-40 minutes in the oven.

I added carrots, green beans, garlic, fresh basil and red wine. Still a little bland. Next time in place of the milk, I'll use Greek yogurt to make it more creamy. I also waited until the end to add the cheese and broiled it for a couple min. I'll make it again, it was cheap, simple and the kids like it.

This is good old comfort food!! Added more seasoning to our taste, lots of garlic, fresh ground black pepper and more onion than recipe states. Needless to say, there wasn't much for leftovers! But those leftover tasted even better the next day!!! Would definitely make this again and again. Versatile too, add different veggies to your liking!! Easy and yummy recipe the whole family will approve of.

I used this as a base idea and went from there.  Instead of using sliced potatoes I used frozen shredded hashbrowns.  I used an entire onion and cooked it along with several cloves of garlic with the meat.  I also added sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic powder and parsley to the liquids.  I mixed everything together and poured into a casserole to bake.  Turned out pretty good especially considering how simple it was.

I give this 5 stars but I made a lot of changes. haha. First, I sauteed a large pkg of mushrooms and several leeks in olive oil. Then I added a tsp of garlic powder to the ground beef. Then I also used about a half cup of feta and a quarter cup of shredded parmesan. Also used my homemade cream of mushroom soup. Mmmmm

Hubby loved this!  Note, I added; green pepper, mushrooms, green beans & a packet of brown gravy mix (to the soup/milk), lastly I used white cheddar as it's all I had on hand.  Easy and delicious!  
PS bake covered.

My kids really enjoyed it. I did not think it was so bad either. Next time I just may add a seasoning that I like on hamburger while its cooking just to add to the salt and pepper. Really loved it.

Kids and adults alike love this. We typically use lots more spices but that's personal taste. Easy and good.

This is very good even with the changes I made. I suspect it would be even better add written. My husband is allergic to dairy so I omitted the 1/2 & 1/2. I also only has 1/2 green pepper so I used 1/2 of a red pepper with it. Also i didn't have any cloves so I substituted cardamon. It turned out very well considering the changes. My husband loved it! It was a bit spicy but we like it that way.

My family loved it!!  I doubled the recipe because I have 4 growing children and they all had more.  I cooked the onions with the hamburger and added some chopped garlic to it.  And I used 3 cans of soup with a little extra milk.  Used extra seasonings on the hamburger and also in my soup mix. Will definitely make this again!!

I made this tonight, and made it a low calorie meal by using healthy cream of mushroom, a little less potatoes, extra lean ground beef, fat free and regular cheese, and fat free milk. I did a bit more seasoning because of the lighter choices. It was very good! I recommend adding carrots, peas, and corn for a little twist. It was all gone in no time. The whole family loved it!

I made this as directed it was good. I made it the second time  with these changes and it was fantastic:
I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, 5/8 cup milk , red onion and some chopped jalapenos and sprinkled with smoked paprika. Sprinkled jalapeno jack cheese instead of cheddar. Yummy :)

Excellent basic recipe but definately need more spices,onion and some garlic.  I added Cayenne pepper, paprika and chilli flakes along with 3 large bulbs of garlic, one red onion and one regular onion to the ground beef.  Could even add mushrooms and bell peppers to the ground beef as well as other spices next time.  Very tasty and inexpensive.  Great bang for your buck.  Easy and quick.

I made this hb potatoe casserole and I omited the onions and subbed onion powder.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead of  cheddar.
I used garlic powder &  blk pepper. It was needing a pop in the spices. But was good. It was fantastic the 2nd day as leftovers.  I will definitely make again. Its a hearty meal and I even had seconds which I never do.

Oh my... this has got to be one of the best comfort food recipe about there...Made it for the wife two days ago and she requested and encore, were making it again...... Spice it up slightly and you'll find it tasking to keep the fork down...Layering it lasagna style good with me but for some heavenly results, I'd suggest getting your hands in there and mixing the hamburger, CoM soup, cheese and potatoes together... add peas or spinach for extra nutrition and the kids will still dig it.....be sure the sink the potatoes before you foil up the casserole dish ... Mmmmmh.

I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat while cooking and seasoning salt to the soup mix, and even topped with french fried onions and cheese, but still thought it was kind of bland. It was edible, but not my favorite dish. I also added cream corn as a layer as suggested by another person.

I made this for our family of 6 [3 generations in the household] the other night & it was a HUGE hit. First off, I have to say that the longest part of the prep was peeling & cutting the potatoes as well as browning the meat. Other then that, this meal was so easy to prepare. :) So I did make some changes, and then I realized that to make it a little better for us that like mushy potatoes I would need to tweak the recipe a hair the next go around. My alterations were as follows: 1. Min. of 3 lbs of ground beef is needed [I doubled the recipe cuz there are so many of us], next time I will use upwards of 5-6 lbs. 2. I will be pre-peeling, pre-slicing & pre-cooking the potatoes next go around [some pieces were a bit hard & most of my family likes ours mushy]. 3. I used 3/4 cups of milk & used at least 1-1 1/2 cups of water to cut the cream of mushroom soup. 4. Because the cream of mushroom soup is salty added salt is not necessary. 5. I had mine in the oven for a min. of 1 3/4 hrs. Because the potatoes were quite hard after 1 hour of cooking. Also cream of mushroom soup is crazy heavy on sodium, I'd suggest using low sodium soup instead AND I doubled the amt of soup. I used 2 cans instead of 1. - My son & I killed the left overs of this the following day & I am planning on making it again in a few weeks & will probably triple the recipe so that everyone can eat left overs the next day. Also I found that more is better w/the cheese. This was a GREAT recipe. Will keep it 4ever. :)

This dish didn't come out well. The flavors were there...sorta...the potatoes were cooked, but there was a lot of liquid on the bottom and it wasn't milky, looked greasy, and the cheese became gummy as it cooled. I wasn't impressed at all. It certainly wouldn't win any awards of any kind. I honestly think this recipe would do better with a cheese sauce somehow instead of a condensed cream soup with some mushroom bits & pieces, maybe some broccoli pieces.

everybody liked it so it's been put in the "make again pile" :) the only thing I did different was a little garlic powder and I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand so I used cream of celery. Plus I added fresh chopped celery bc I had some.

This was delicious! I added a couple sliced mushrooms and cooked the onions with the meat. I also added a clove of minced garlic, and a little seasoning salt. I cut the cheese down just because I didn't have a whole cup. Yum, yum!

In my opinion I think it needed some veggies, and more seasonings added. This time I tried it with more veggies, and more seasonings, and it came out delish. I would say make it to taste. Add whatever you want to add to it.

Make this casserole easier by pressing the raw ground beef into the bottom of the casserole dish, then add diced fresh onion, (can of green beans optional), then sliced potatoes, season to taste, top with slices of cheese, and then pour cream of mushroom and milk mixture on top. Bake for 1 hour at 350. Top with french fried onions, and serve. The ground beef cooks up tender and crisp against the casserole dish bottom. One of our family's favorite casseroles!!!

I added 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix to punch up the flavor, and used baked potatoes that I had left over from another meal. Baked for 20 minutes, added cheese. Very good!

Made this last night and everyone loved it so much I am making it again tonight for our church pot luck. I cooked the onions with the hamburger and added a bunch of Cavender's Greek Seasoning. I don't know how something so simple could taste so amazing.

I have to say I found it lacked a whole lot of flavour, while the ground beef was cooking I added 2 cloves of garlic and fresh mushrooms  and to the mushroom soup I added 1package of onion soup mix.

Super easy, super good!  My boyfriend said, "this is my new favorite". Would be really good with frozen peas or mixed veggies.  I am for sure adding this to our weekly rotation.

Read the reviews and decided to try this casserole.  Made a few tweaks from the reviews:  Used 96/4 hamburger and browned it with half the onions and then added a few tablespoons of the soup to the browned hamburger before putting it in the baking dish.  Also used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and 2% shredded cheese.  It was great and I've cooked it twice already.

This was utterly delicious. I really thought it would turn out like just another mince meat casserole. But oh....what flavor. My boys devoured it!! I will be making this again and may even make it for my month end potluck at work. Thanks so much for sharing it.

Made this last night, huge hit with the whole family.  My only addition was bacon that I cut up into small pieces and fried until just crisp.  Put bacon aside let grease in pan, added onions for a few minutes, then added the burger.  Not healthy I know but flavored the meat well.  Sliced redskin new potatoes extra thin and layered everything.  reserved some bacon for garnish.  Added cheese on top and reserved bacon and it was a quickly put together meal (though it must bake a while to cook potatoes) that helped me use up hamburger.  My 6 year old said it was her *favorite recipe*

I lost my original recipe for this, made this plenty when my children were little. The only thing my recipe called for that this one doesn't is a some cream cheese. I can't remember if it's half or a whole package, whick now sounds like alot! lol My kids loved it and it was cheap to make,we were so poor then. I would make a huge bowl so we could have leftovers. Always served it with a jello salad. Will have to try this again someday.

Great recipe and easy to make; all prep. I added Garlic as I do to pretty much everything and this dish received a thumbs up from my wife and kids. As many Parents know, the kid endorsement is important as many children are particular with the look and taste of the food they eat. Usually, if it looks unappetizing, then they aren't going for it. We will make this again.

This is a great base recipe that can handle a lot of variation. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken plus a quarter of a bag of french onion soup mix (I chickened out, it could have used much more). I used about 3 and a half medium/large Yukon gold potatoes, sliced on my mandolin to 1.5mm. It cooked perfectly in 1 hr. Like others I also browned my meat with garlic and onions. I served it with sour cream on top instead of in the sauce so people could use as much or as little as they like. It was good and simple enough to put together, I will make it again.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. The potatoes, though thinly sliced took forever to cook. The second time I sliced them and boiled them before adding to the casserole. I also added a can of Rotele and that gave it a little bit more flavor. Overall great recipe, especially for cold days!

My wife can't eat canned soups, so I made a bechamel sauce and threw in some cheddar as a substitute.  I tried pre-boiling the potatoes, but they were sliced thin on a mandolin and became too brittle after just 7 minutes.  Probably better just to let it cook 2+ hours if needed.  I made an extra layer with frozen mixed veggies.  This was a big hit and reheated nicely in the microwave.  We'll definitely do it again.  Just remember - respect the mandolin!

I mixed the soup, salt, pepper, and milk in with the drained, browned ground beef and onions in the skillet so didn't need to dirty a mixing bowl.  I followed the list of ingredients but next time will add more seasonings as others suggested. I covered with foil until I added the cheese.  I also like the suggestion of mixing additional cheese in with the casserole as well as on top.

This is a good recipe for what it basically is.  Added onion and garlic to the browning of the hamburger, added about a half cup of sour cream to the soup, as well as about a 1/2 cup of beef broth, and some Alfredo sauce.  It made it very creamy and good.

Great comfort food casserole! I took the advice of prior posters and cooked the potatoes in the microwave beforehand to cut off some oven baking time. I also subbed Morningstar Farms Veggie Ground Crumbles in place of ground beef and used taco seasoning in the "meat." Very tasty! Will make again.

Made this vegetarian by using Morningstar Farms Crumbles instead of ground beef. Also took reveiewers' suggestions and modified it - this is a great recipe b/c it welcomes changes! Used frozen hash browns b/c I had them and don't usually eat them and hoped this would make them taste better. It did! Used yogurt with the mushroom soup along with some fresh and dried herbs - thyme, oregano, basil, parsley. Mozzarella on top and snuck a little in between the layers. Also added a minced fresh jalapeño but it was totally lost in the end. Sautéed carrots with the onions and garlic, then added the crumbles. Layered as written in a crockpot and was done in 2hrs on high. Fab comfort food, easy and perfect for a hot summer day.

Kids and hubby liked it, but we all thought it needed a bit more flavor.  I did follow the advice of some of the reviews; added sour cream to the soup mixture, veggies, garlic and paprika to the ground beef. But it still needed something else/more. Nevertheless, I like this recipe for it's flexibility to accomodate ingredients on hand and for it's potential.

I wanted something simple and different to make with ground beef and found this recipe.  ... I added 3 cloves of garlic which I sauteed with the burger and onion.  I then added the soup, milk and pepper (I usually never add salt , plus the soup already had enough salt in it )  along with a frozen veggie mix  (carrots,peas,limas, beans, corn) and simmered for a few minutes before layering in the casserole dish with the potatoes (I was fortunate to have fresh dug potatoes from my brother's garden). I did as someone else suggested and covered with foil until the last 15 minutes of cooking time and the potatoes were done just right.    I used the cheese I had on hand... Monterrey Jack... which I shredded and sprinkled on top after the casserole was done baking , replaced the foil, and left it melt from the heat of the casserole.   I had my brother and his wife over for dinner and everyone absolutely loved this ~~ I kicked mine up a notch and topped it off with fresh diced jalepeno pepper!!  Thanks for the great recipe ... I will definitely be making this again!!

My family loved it. To make it a little easier I used canned square potatoes, added a square of cream cheese, and used dried onions. My family liked it so much, I am making it again tonight and I just made it last night. Also, I didn't layer, just mixed it all together with cheese layers in between. Way easey and good!

This was very quick and easy. I browned the meat with onions and bell peppers. Added it all with soup and milk after meat was drained and cooled.  I had some pepper jack cheese left over and added that on top with american cheese.  This was wonderful as well as easy.  This one goes to the top of my list for quick easy meals.

Our kids like this dish, which makes it a goto meal.  This is an easy thing to make  and we always have hamburger, potatoes and cream o mushroom soup. Great for families and just a good comfort casserole.

It was good. Tasted a little too greasy for my taste, but other than that it was good. Might try it with ground turkey next time.

This was wonderful!  We made it as is and it was delicious!  My 3 year old daughter ate it and she hates all potatoes.  I think next time we might try mixing some cheese in the casserole too instead of just on top, but the cheese on top was very yummy too.  It got toasty and browned.  YUM!!!!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I mixed together and made in crockpot. Cooked faster than I thought but was still good! Used cream of celery bc it's what I had and added some garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper to the meat.

I felt this had plenty of flavor and it was really good.  But, I don't know what I did wrong.  How many times are you supposed to layer this?  I had this in the oven for the designated time, but it came out burnt on the bottom and the meat on top was burnt also.  Next time I might try this in a smaller dish or layering it 3 times instead of two.  I might also cut down the time it cooks for.

Made this last night for dinner....it was so-so.  I was nervous about the potatoes being cooked all the way, but they were perfect!!  I topped my layers off with meat and then baked, and the last 5 minutes added the shredded cheese.  I won't finish the top with meat next time, as I found it very crunchy and over cooked.  My husband said it was okay and compared it to Hamburger Helper Potato Beef Stroganoff.  Might make it again if I'm strapped for cash....as it is a very pocket book friendly meal.

Omg, this is so delicious! I can't believe I've never had this before. This is very easy and inexpensive to make. I took the advice of another review and added some sour cream into the soup/milk mixture..yum! I also added some garlic powder to the meat while cooking. It all came together very nicely. My husband and I loved it! Will make again and again! Thank you!

Had I stayed with the recipe, this would have been horribly bland. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tsp of Worst. Sauce, didn't peel the potato and used ground turkey. Instead of layering, I decided to mix all of the ingredients together before putting it in the oven. Covered with foil, after one hour I added the cheese, cooked for 15 minutes (uncovered) and removed and let it sit for about 10 minutes. The sauce was a tad thin, but OK. Served with hot sauce, green beans and salad. I'll make it again as it's economical and tasted decent after the extra's I added. I may add peppers next time. UPDATED: Added a bag of frozen green beans before baking and we all really liked that!

I found this recipe a bit small to feed an entire family.  I would double it.  Also, it was lacking a vegetable if you were using it for a full meal casserole.  I think corn would go nicely.  I also added fresh garlic to the meat as I browned it.  A very nice flavour.

This is awesome.  I have this recipe as well, my mother used to make it for me and my siblings and now I make it for my 6 kids and they all LOVE it.  I use cream of chicken soup instead and a few shakes of onion powder in place of the chopped onions for my finicky eaters.  Great!

This was good. It did`t fill up a 2 quart casserole dish, I added about a pound and a half of hamburger and used a can of green beans and a can of mushrooms. Then I carmelized the onions came out good

I thought it was very good.  Only made a couple of changes.  I had mushrooms that I needed to use, so I sauted them along with the onions.  Added a few drops of hot sauce.  Not enough to make it hot, just to add a little more flavor.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I shredded the potatoes instead of slicing them which I think was a mistake. I can only imagine how much better it would have tasted if I sliced them. If I went by how it tasted with the shredded potatoes I would rated it a 2 but I didn't think that would be fair considering I didn't follow the exact recipe. I will attempt to make it again the correct way and hopefully re-rate it a 5!

This recipe is a keeper in my house.  My kids loved it and asked for seconds.  I didn't really care for the cheese on top...made it a little greasy.  I added onion powder and garlic powder along with minced garlic to the ground beef/soup mixture.  I covered my pan and baked for exactly 1 hr and came out wonderful!

This was a good very quick meal. The whole family loved it. I did use 2 cans of soup just because my family likes it more saucy and I added some Durkee onions at the end. This is a good twist on shepherd's pie that I will be making again, thanks.

I followed this recipe exactly and it ended up tasting like something out of a box.  It was good, both my husband and daughter enjoyed it but the recipe could definitely be tweaked a bit. Next time I'm going to add some spices and mushrooms to try to get a more complex taste.

This is wonderful!  I changed the recipe a bit by using Simply Potatoes Homestyle Slices & cooking the onion with the ground beef. I lowered the cook time to 40 minutes before putting the cheese on top to be melted. It was quicker & less mess.  Yum!!!

Easy, quick, tasty, and filling meal.  The only thing extra I did was to layer velvetta and add some garlic powered to the ground beef.  This is something I will make again.

easy, quick prep. dinner with basics you usually have on hand.  substituted the cr of mushroom w/ what I had, which was cream of celery.  did add basil and 3 cloves of garlic, 4 potatos instead of 3, and a can of mushrooms.  i think it still needs a bit more seasoning, but it was a hit w/ my kids and hubby. hubby didn't think it needed anything else. will make again.

I done gone an cajunized da recipe.  I added garlic, bell pepper, and celery.  I substituted fat free half and half for the milk and salt free cajun seasoning for salt and pepper.  After browning the meat I mixed it with the mixture and let it marinate.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  It was delicious and will make again.

Loved this easy recipe! My husband requests this a couple of times a month. I make this exactly as written but I do add a can of sliced mushrooms in with the soup. Thanks for the quick meal idea.

It was alright.  If I make it again, I won't layer it, I'll mix it all together.  Maybe through in some sour cream and garlic or something.  It was very bland to us.  We used a lot of salt to "taste" it.

I served this with a dollop of sour cream on top. I also used half sweet potatoes and half Russet potatoes. It was very good, very easy to make, and inexpensive. I think I will probably make it again. I think that you could also add some different kinds of root vegetables to make it more nutritious, and it would probably still taste good. Yummy comfort food. :)

This definitely needs some seasoning.  I used quite a bit of garlic and onion powders along with adding some beef bouillion granules to the burger while cooking.  The add-ins are virtually endless and it's a relatively simple meal.  Definitely season it up, though!

I thought this was a great recipe that you can do many things with.  I subsituted cream of chicken for the mushroom since my family does care for them.  I did add minced garlic to the hamburger and a few other spices to the soup mix.  I added a layer of frozen greenbeans.  I did follow a few other reviewers tips and microwaved the sliced potatoes to save cooking time and covered until the last 10 minutes of baking.  I will be making this again; it's a low cost meal that my family enjoyed!

I usually read the reviews before I try a new recipe, but, I was in a hurry to find something quick to make.  It is an easy recipe to make, but, it was definitely bland.  I didn't really give it much thought until we started eating it!  If I made this again I would add lots of garlic and maybe steak sauce in with the meat.

Very good - a great casserole to take to a potluck dinner.  I added some red pepper flakes, garlic powder, parsley and some frozen mixed veggies.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  It was tasty & one could really play around with this recipe, adding leftover veggies, etc.

This was good and my husband and I both enjoyed it. Nice and warm for a cool fall day. I did not have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken (which I was very hesitant of) it still turned out great.

An okay starter recipe. Added mushrooms, celery and sour cream. Didn't add the cheese, might have helped. Just didn't sound good with cheese. Will do next time though.

My family and I loved it!  It was easy to make and tasted great. I made  a few alterations, I added green peppers when I browned the hamburger, and to the soup mix I added some basil and I didn't have fresh onions so I used french onions instead and for my kids I used american cheese slices instead of cheddar and it turned out wonderful! We will definitely make this again.

Family loves it. Get frequent requests for it. Next time I think I will do as other users suggest and try to sneak some veggies in it. But it's a good, easy, simple recipe that uses ingredients I always keep on hand.

Good recipe.  If you are looking for a 'hamburger helper', this is 10x better than anything that comes out of a box.  We used 1.5lb ground beef and used it as a main course with a vegetable on the side.

Well, I knew going in this would be bland, so, I just kept adding garlic salt and pepper between the layers.  It turned out ok.  I will put in some fresh mushrooms in the meat mixture next time and maybe add a few more spices to zing it up a little.  Thank goodness I wasn't pressed for time because it took a full hour and the potatoes still weren't done.

This recipe is so yummy. I followed the recipe but I added more mushroom soup and added onion soup mix, and combined my hamburger in my soup mixture. I also used hash browns also like some else suggested. I will make this again. It was a hit with my family.

This was a good stick to your ribs meal. I changed the condensed soup to a Campbells pepperjack cheese. It made it very tasty. The kids didn't want to try it since the potatoes weren't mashed. But the hubby and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Thanks!

We liked this hearty casserole and will make it again. Next time I think I will use 1 1/2 cans of soup and mix the soup and meat together, potatoes on the bottom and soup over that. I also sliced the onions and put them over the potatoes because we like the flavor of the onions that way. I covered the casserole with foil for the first hour and then melted the cheese on top. The potatoes were just right, not mushy, after one hour. Thanks for an easy dinner fix.

This was tasty and very easy when I needed to make a quick dinner.  I added Jamaica Me Crazy spices, garlic, and feta cheese on the top.  Next time I would even put some green pepper in it. This will definitely be a recipe added to "My Favourites"!

This was so bland and lacking flavour.  I took one bite and had to do something to fix it so I added a spice blend.  This needs spices.  Its an alright base for a casserole but it needs more.

This was good.  I added garlic to the Soup and covered it with foil until time to add the cheese.  I made it this time with ground deer which I had trouble eating, but everyone else really loved it.  I am going to try it with pork chops next.  I think that will be really good.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Very good, easy & quick recipe.  The only thing I did differently was that I cooked it in the microwave because I was short on time.  Took about 20 minutes on high but my microwave is not very powerfull.  Turned out great & I had NO leftovers.  Will definitely make again.

My husband & I thought this was a really good meal!  I used cream of celery soup, because we don't care for mushrooms.  I also used an extra 1/2 can of cream of celery because I ran out of sauce.  To cut down on some fat, I also used Fat-Free Milk.  Although this recipe was time consuming, I would definately make it again!

My husband and I both thought this recipe was ok...kind of bland though.  I might try again and add some spices to give it more of a kick.
