I have used this brine for years.  It adds a perfect amount of flavor to the turkey. Instead of following these cooking directions I follow it up with the honey smoked turkey recipe I also found on here.  Doing the combination of these two recipes makes amazing turkeys.

I've used this brine recipe for years but instead of putting it on the grill, I put the turkey in a turkey bag and roast in the oven. It's my go-to for turkey!
