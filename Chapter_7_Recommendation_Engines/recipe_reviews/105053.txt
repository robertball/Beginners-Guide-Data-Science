For me this recipe is a very good starting point and has proved to be very versatile.  It has become almost a show stealer from the main course.  Took the advice of several other reviewers and added about a tsp of garlic powder to the dough.  Dough was a little sticky and I did add about an additional 1/2 of flour overall to keep it manageable.  Also greased pan with olive oil and then sprinkled some cornmeal to keep it from sticking and poked holes in dough. Changed butter spread to 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter 1/2 tsp oregano and a clove of garlic and spread on the dough.  Then from BATMAN BEYOND's review of Parmesian Foccacia Bread (a bread machine recipe) which suggested chopping a fresh tomato - I used two small ones and some fresh basil as well - and saute in just a little olive oil with some fresh garlic salt.  Then sprinkled the tomato mixture over the butter/olive oil spread on the dough.  Lastly sprinkle on the parmesian cheese and bake.  I used the same temp, but it took about 10 minutes longer to bake and set up in the middle.  So good!  This was gone in absolutely no time and my kids beg me everyday to make it...

Bread came out great the first time.  My husband loved it too.  I combined steps 1 and 2 by mixing the yeast, flour,salt and sugar with HOT tap water then mixing in the olive oil.  I covered it and let stand until doubled in size.  The final product was very nice with a nice texture.  I will make this again.  My husband thinks this will make a great pizza dough too!

4 stars for a great flat bread but I felt this recipe needed more flavor.  I made it twice.  Both times the dough came out perfect.  Someone mentioned that this dough should be a "wet" dough and sticky and not to add more flour.  That advice was perfect.  I just made sure I had enough flour to roll with and on my hands so it wasn't to hard to work with.  
The first time I made it I put in 2 cloves of crushed garlic in the dough while kneeding it instead of using the powder and it wasn't enough. It was still a nice flat bread.  The 2nd time I added 4 cloves and used about 1tbs of garlic powder and it was more flavorful  I also left the cheese off until it was about a minute from being done and I brushed it with butter and then put on the cheese and cooked one minute and took it out of oven and let it melt while it rested.  I liked it much better that way, then what the original recipe calls for.

Very good!  I started the dough in my bread machine, and while it came together perfectly, once it was removed, it was extremely sticky and difficult to work with.  I had to knead in a TON more flour to be able to work with it.  While I was kneading in the flour, I also added some minced garlic and italian seasoning to the dough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  These were very good!  I cut them into strips to serve like breadsticks and had marinara for dipping.  We'll have these again for sure!!

Love this stuff! We enjoy great pizza with it. I add freshly minced garlic (2 cloves) and 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to it when I am mixing it up.  Once it has risen, I roll it out, place it on a large pizza pan and bake it for 5 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then I top it with pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings.  Back in the oven for 25 or 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Some of the BEST pizza we have had.  YUM!

I've made this twice, once with the recipe as written (great), and once substituting the garlic powder for 3 tbsp. or so of minced garlic (even better).

(Originally reviewed 25 March 2008 -edited for spelling) I did not have any bread flour, so I simply used 2 cups plain flour and added in 4tsp of vital wheat gluten.  In reading the reviews, alot of people noted that the dough was sticky and that they added in extra flour, perhaps they are not aware, but this type of dough is considered a "Batter yeast dough" - this means it will be sticky, and you should NOT add any extra flour, except for perhaps a small sprinkling of flour for the area in which you end up kneading the dough. I don't even bother to knead it. I let mine proof in a glass bowl, once it has risen I invert the bowl onto a parchment lined baking sheet and lift the bowl away. 
Instead of plain butter, I used a butter that already had garlic & herbs mixed into it, and then I used fresh grated parmesan, and a 6 italian cheese blend plus additional mozzarella cheese.  I also added some garlic powder and italian seasoning into the yeast dough.  This is
comparable to a focaccia I normally buy at a local delicatessen.

I've been wanting to try this recipe just because it sounded good but I was afraid to try making bread by hand.  Well, last weekend my 13-year old breadmaker walked off the counter last weekend and broke, so today I tried it this recipe.  My kitchen smells so good.  Followed the recipe exactly, and was surprised at how easy it was to put together.  I now have a double batch rising to make pizza for supper (I plan to divide it into thirds since the dough was thick).  Thanks for the post.  I will be making this regularly.

Really liked the texture of this flatbread! I didn't use all the butter the recipe called for on top- made a garlic/butter sauce for dipping instead. I think next time I will add a little more cheese and some Italian herbs and go for a cheesy bread. Also will try this as a pizza dough. Thanks for a good recipe!

I'm rating this recipe on taste and workability.  The finished product's taste and texture was wonderful!  I added minced garlic to the dough at the very end and dried oregano after putting on the cheeses.  My daughter is gobbling it up. The workability of this recipe, however!!!!  I threw the ingredients into the bread machine on the pizza dough cycle and when it was done I had a bowl of soup.  I needed to add a good cup of flour to make it even remotely workable, and it was still sticky.  I also had to scrape the thick layer of residue off my kitchen table.  Also, there was way too much butter.  Maybe 1/3 cup is necessary if you work with some spreadable ingredient like margarine, but with melted butter, I ended throwing out half of it.  While the finished product is soft and delicious, I greatly did not appreciate the inaccurate list of measurements.

This was SO GOOD!  I put fresh garlic in the dough, as others suggested.  Plus, since so many people thought it would be good for pizza, we used it for that!  It made the best pizza we've ever had - we'll never buy store-bought again!

This is very good and easy to make.  I buy the instant yeast by the pound so it is cheaper and can be kept in the freezer for several years. When I made this, I mixed the first 6 items, using very warm water and with instant yeast there was no need to proof it.  I also added a teaspoon of Basil and 1 of garlic powder too.  1 Tablespoon of the instant (quick rise) yeast equals 1 envelope of yeast. After letting the dough rise, I placed it on a large pizza pan that I had well oiled.  I put oil on my hands too to spread the dough and flatten it out to fit the pan.  After that, I melted the butter and added the garlic powder to it.  I spread the mix on top of the dough, sprinkled a goodly amount of oregano on top and topped it with about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  I baked it at the suggested temp and time.

Absolutely delicious...it's almost identical to a famous pizza chain's hand-tossed pizza crust.  VERY easy to make, and very easy to change up.  I plan to add chopped green chili to the dough and top with mexican cheeses.  This is a perfect bread, adaptable to whatever dish you are making.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

This has quickly become a family favorite.  I mix the dough with my Kitchen Aid dough hook. I added garlic to the dough, however, I do not add any extra flour to the dough; yes, it appears to be a little sticky but I leave the dough in the mixing bowl, cover it and allow it to rise in my warm microwave.  When the dough has doubled in size, I sprinkle my pastry cloth with about 1/2 cup of flour and knead the dough by hand for about 1 minute.  I press the dough into a rectangle and then roll it, lift and place in the prepared baking pan.  Unroll and press to fit the pan.  I brush the dough with butter and allow to rise a second time for about 10-15 minutes. Sprinkle with cheeses and extra garlic powder.  Bake and cut into strips. Delicious!

This makes a very nice flatbread!  I didn't change anything with the ingredients of the amounts I used, other than (1.) adding a little more flour to make it slightly easier to work with and (2.) "eyeballing" the amount for the toppings.  I have made this a few times and added some good quality pepperoni with some homemade pizza sauce to dip it in and it was great.  A word of advice -- Several people have said that they use this for pizza crust.  I was skeptical, but I tried it anyway ... Not good, not good at all.  This flatbread has more of a bready texture and not enough chewiness for a pizza crust.

Everyone really loved this.  I would add a little more salt to the dough next time, or sprinkle kosher salt on top.  Really fast and easy.  Sprayed oil on top and then topped with parmesan and fresh rosemary and diced garlic, will add garlic to dough as well.  Would brush with butter as suggested.

I have already made this twice since finding the recipe.  This is very good and pretty easy to make, especially considering I don't bake that much.  I liked the recipe because I already had all the ingredients, but it still turned into something special.  I thought it was pretty garlic-y, which I love!  I served with jarred marinara for dipping.  Yum!

This recipe was great!  I used 1/2 spelt flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour, fresh chopped garlic, and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Turned out soft and chewy.  Thanks!

Loved it, easy to make and my first try at making any homemade bread. We had it with spinach dip and it was perfect, I used a pizza cutter to cut it into strips for dipping!

I tried to make this on dough setting on bread machine. The dough came out sticky, worked in 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour.
After a short while was able to roll out
and get ready for oven. I brushed top with olive oil, not magarine. I used only 1 T garlic powder, and it turned out fine.  The bread texture was light, and the seasoning worked out perfect.

So good I can't believe I made it! and easy, too! I've always been intimidated by any bread recipe that called for yeast. Well, I've been challenging myself lately and decided to go for it. This bread practically made itself. After I let it rise, I put it on the floured surface to roll it out, but I didn't have to. I'd gotten out my rolling pin for nothing. I just put it on in the pan and put the butter and other toppings on it. So good. I will be doing this again. Thanks for this recipe Gina!

Fantastic.  I added a bit of dried basil which was nice and gave it a bit of color.  I think next time I will roll it a bit thinner as it rose a bit and add a bit more cheese.

This recipe I will definatey use again! I never managed to make a good foccacia, this bread is a wonderful alternative. I was very surprised my dough wasn't sticky at all. But I didn't use fresh garlic at first. When I added the garlic, the dough became sticky! So I suppose it's the garlic which makes it sticky. My first one was a little bland, so I sprinkled some sea salt on top, yummm. On the second one, I put some halved cherry tomatoes, yuummmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Again, the dough wasn't sticky at all. I didn't even have to use any extra flour to roll out the dough, amazing!! I let rise it for at least one hour. I will experiment a lot with this recipe I think.

Per the review of Toasty Mama Took the advice of several other reviewers and added 6 cloves minced garlic to the dough. Dough was a little sticky and I did add about an additional 1/2 of flour overall to keep it manageable. Also greased pan with olive oil and then sprinkled some cornmeal to keep it from sticking and poked holes in dough. Changed butter spread to 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter 1/2 tsp oregano and a clove of garlic and spread on the dough. Then from BATMAN BEYOND's review of Parmesian Foccacia Bread (a bread machine recipe) which suggested chopping a fresh tomato - I used two small ones and some fresh basil as well - and saute in just a little olive oil with some fresh garlic salt. Then sprinkled the tomato mixture over the butter/olive oil spread on the dough. Lastly sprinkle on the parmesian cheese and bake. I used the same temp, but it took about 10 minutes longer to bake and set up in the middle. So good!

This bread was so good! My husband and I ate a whole loaf by ourselves. I used real garlic and added dried basil to the butter mixture. I also put a clove of minced garlic in the dough. Turned out perfect.

This was good- I just thought it was wierd that it wasn't kneaded at first.  It was really sticky and hard to handle after the first rising.  But it baked up so soft and fluffy, it made it worth it to me.  I used half whole wheat flour and threw a bunch of fresh chopped garlic in the dough.  Went very well with spaghetti and meatballs.

Excellent recipe as is coming from a person who can't cook/bake at all :) after the first try I did use some other tips, I now add 1 tsp garlic powder to the flour mixture and poke holes in the dough once its on the pan. Also, for some reason I simply could not roll the dough out without having to add a whole lot of flour so instead of adding flour like other reviewers did i just dip my fingers in flour and stretch the dough onto my cookie sheet and it comes out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!! I used all-purpose flour and only 1/4 c of butter. I used the bread machine and had to add more flour to make a dough because it was watery as is. I added cheeses I had in the fridge together with parmesan and sprinkled some dried herbs on top to give it color and flavor. We all loved this bread. Baked it on a 9X13 pan but can even make thinner.

Made this recipe as given except I used half whole wheat flour.  I was satisfied with the outcome but next time I will probably mix fresh pressed garlic  into the butter instead of using garlic powder.  It was easy to make and turned out a very basic, very adequate bread with a nice texture.  No raves but no complaints either.  I can see why others are using it as a pizza crust recipe.

I made this bread this afternoon and it was quite good.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the bread as well as a little Italian seasoning.  I would have liked a more potent garlic flavor (garlic powder would have probably done that--just like the recipe said!).  The bread was super easy to make, had a great texture, and we thought it was very yummy.

I definitely will be making this bread again.

I really enjoyed this.  I actually made it in the early afternoon for dinner.  This reheated well in a 350 degree oven.  I also added a little oregano, but any herb would work well. Sun dried tomatoes would made a nice addition to the top.  I would suggest to proof the yeast before continuing.

Really great recipe!  I love to make it and just dip it in spaghetti sauce.  Tastes just like cheesy garlic bread you can buy at most pizza places.

This is a great recipe for a quick garlic bread. I did the dough in my kitchen aid mixer. I did have to add probably another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of bread flour to make this dough not be so sticky. I did make this on a rainy day, so that could account for the stickiness of the dough. I also sprinkled the top of the bread with 1 tsp of italian seasoning. I only used 4 tsp of garlic powder (instead of the 6 tsp) it called for. I could have used the entire amount though. It wasn't overwhelmingly garlicy. I also only used Mozzarella cheese because that's all I had in the house. This would be a great base for pizzas. My husband loved the bread.

I used whole wheat flour and sprinkled some fresh thyme on  top. I reduced the 1/3 cup butter to 2 Tbsp. I reduced the 1 cup of water to a tad over 3/4 cup (1 cup made the dough too sticky and hard to work with). It was delicious!

This was amazing.  I basically followed the recipe to a T.  I added a little bit of garlic to the dough and about 1/2-3/4 cup more flour and I also sprinkled some sea salt on top before baking as well as adding pepperoni.  I will definitely make it again.

Bread baking just doesn’t get any easier than this.  I was looking for a simple bread to go with the soup I was making for supper and ran across this.  I made a portion of the bread and adjusted the seasoning to compliment the soup.  I also let it rise a little longer on the second rise because I wanted a lighter texture of bread.  It came out perfect.  It has great flavor, soft texture, and great chew.  If you’re new at bread baking this is great bread to start with.  It’s a great recipe.

This is really good. I would like to try it for a pizza crust sometime just to see how it would be compared to what I'm using now. One word of advice, make sure you bake in the oven in a pan with sides!  The butter will run off and make for a very smokey house!!  I won't do that aain!

We made this for a Christmas party and topped it with cream frache, smoked salmon and capers and it was very well received.  The bread alone is moist and very tasty.  We plan to use this recipe for pizza dough as well.

This recipe is easier than it sounds!  The second time I made it, I put minced garlic into the dough during needing.  This made it require more flour, but really added to the flavor.  I also suggest adding italian spice or additional cheese to the finished bread.  I brushed it with olive oil instead of butter, which worked  well.  It seems like too much needless butter in my opinion.

I too put garlic in my dough. It was good but I'd rather just have french bread.

This is very easy to make and yummy!

I added a variation to it myself by adding chopped garlic cloves to the bread dough. Yummy

The texture of the dough was fantastic, after I added some extra flower. It is very sticky and not like I was used to, but it turned out wonderfully. The flavor wasn't what I was expecting it next time I will probably add some extra garlic. I did like another review were suggested and waited until the last few minutes of baking to add butter and cheese.

4.5 stars.  I made this as a crust for a pizza.  Baked it, with the margarine on the crust, for 5 min. until the crust is no longer sticky.  Topped it with sauce and various toppings and  baked it until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and slightly browned...about 20 minutes more.  This makes a crust that is not thin, nor thick...more like a hand tossed crust.  I will use this recipe again for this purpose.
*UPDATE* 10/20/17 Made this again, this time as written and it was very good.  I did have to add more flour to be able to handle the dough.  And I wasn't able to spread the butter, so I melted it and brushed it on the dough before going into the oven.  I also added garlic powder to the dough and sprinkled it on top as written.  Baked without the mozzarella on top, added it in the last 5 minutes instead...we enjoyed it!

Excellent flatbread dough that is chewy while being very simple to make.  I did have to add more flour (probably close to 1/4 cup) to the bread machine since I mixed the dough in that.  I didn't feel the extra flour made the results too dense.  I also scattered some cornmeal on the pan before placing the dough freeform on the pan.  Topped with roasted veg, parmesan, fresh thyme and rosemary, and prosciutto after spreading a little olive oil and fresh ground pepper.  Yum!

Used whole wheat flour and it tasted fantastic! Sprinkled garlic powder and italian seasoning on it. Baked it on my pampered chef stone and it turned out PERFECT!

Mmmm, mmmm, mmm! This was so delicious!! I was so surprised that it turned out well even when I didn't have proper tools to make this. I used hot water for step one (the yeast) and used 4 cloves of minced garlic with sprinkles of garlic powder. I also followed another reviewer's tip on putting the cheese on for only a minute. It was really good and it turned out to be more like bread than like flatbread.

Perfect!  I have very little bread baking experience.  I followed the directions exactly and the results were great.  The garlic is strong, but so good.  I want to try this as a pizza dough next.

This bread is fabulous- and quite easy to make, which is a big plus in our house. I did make one variation- I only used 1 tablespoon of garlic powder as I didn't want the garlic to overpower the parmesan and butter flavors.  
This one's going in my favorite recipe book!

I worried about the review which called this a 'sticky mess from start to finish', and they were certainly right.  But I just kept adding more flour until it wasn't sticky and figured at worst we'd just end up pitching it.  But to our surprise it was quick, easy and delicious.  My 5 yr old could have eaten the whole thing.  We cut it in strips and dipped in spaghetti sauce...yum!  Thanks!

Excellent bread, personally I think don't skip the butter step, it makes the bread so yummy (although not very healthy). I use whatever cheese I have on hand for the top, it always comes out great!

Followed the directions to a T...this was a sticky mess from start to finish. I was surprised it turned out so poorly, considering the reviews and the fact that I am very experienced making bread.
