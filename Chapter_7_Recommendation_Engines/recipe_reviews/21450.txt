I used thawed frozen orange juice concentrate (NOT watered down) for more orange flavor. I also used soured lactose-free milk. I baked my muffins at 350 for just under 20 minutes. They smelled amazing and looked just like they should--I don't think there was enough liquid in this recipe, these turned out dry for me.  I'd try these again but I'd add a quarter cup more of orange juice or so.

Excellent! These are delicious muffins. If you would like additional orange flavoring, use Â¼ cup of defrosted,  undiluted orange juice concentrate (from frozen orange juice) instead of just plain orange juice. I also used golden raisins. This recipe is a keeper.

I tweaked it by using honey instead of sugar, zested a whole orange, then juiced it, which was about 1/3 cup.  I used milk to make up the difference between the 1/2 c milk and 1/4 cup oj.  (Juice the orange and put it in a measuring cup then fill the rest up to 3/4 cup with milk.)  I topped the muffins with chunky turbinado sugar...yummmy.  :-)

Made them yesterday. I didn't have milk, so I used 1/4 cup half-half and more orange juice to make up for the milk. This resulted in a more intense orange taste, which everybody liked. I also added 1/2 cup dried figs, which gave a bit more sweetness to the muffins. The only problem was the oven temperature. After 20 minutes at 400F, the muffins were burnt on the bottom. I will try 375 next time.

Love the flavor in these muffins and find, like other suggested, that dried cranberries do compliment the orange.   Have substitute frozen orange juice (thawed) which gives them a deeper flavor.  Depends on your taste.....

First muffins I ever made and they turned out PERFECT! I added candied orange instead of raisins and half a teaspoon fresh ginger (those were just in my cupboard), so I guess there's plenty room for improvisation! Thanks!!!

Incredible  ! I just pulled them out of the oven and I'm having on right now... absolutely perfect consistency/texture. I made some changes ONLY because I didn't have any oranges, just orange juice, and I only had a TBSP of sugar left... so I added dates, cranberries, golden raisins. Instead of sugar, about 2 TBSP honey, and only 1 TBSP sugar, a little vanilla & almond extract (I never measure sorry :/) and maybe 2 tbsp extra orange juice. Topped them with cranberries or granola made from 1/4 c quick cook oats, 1tbsp brown sugar, 1tbsp butter, & dash of orange juice. SO GOOD!!! I will definitely be using this as a base recipe for future muffins, THANKS! :):):)

Simple delicious :D  I warmed the raisins in the microwave for 30 seconds and kept covered with the orange juice to plump them up. I also used brown sugar instead of white (used a little less)

I made these exatly as the recipe is written, the only exception is that I didn't have an orange to zest. These are not very good. They taste like slightly sweetened white bread with raisins, they do not have a muffin texture at all. I will not be making these again, sorry.

Great muffins! Except that I think I'll need to add more orange zest (another tablespoon) ... I just love the smell of baked orange zests...I put 1/2 cup sugar and kind of regreted it... the muffins weren't too sweet and i would have like it sweeter... will put as per recipe next time :)

I thought it was very flavorless and gross. Most people said it was good the first bite and then the after taste would hit. I wouldnt do this recipe again.

I added pecans, 1/2 ts pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 ts nutmeg. I dusted the tops of the muffins with a little cinnamon before I cooked them. These were great. I might try next time to soak my raison in the OJ for a while (if I have the time) or use cranberries. The thing about the muffins that I liked was that they were not so much sweet but more spicy.  More attitude than a normal muffin. My neighbor keeps asking me for this recipe 4 weeks after I dropped some over at her house.

This recipe is great. Simple and easy to make--just the right sweetness. That said, I did not use the orange zest and I used dried cranberries instead of raisins!

I have just baked these muffins, and they are absolutely divine!  I did not feel like going shopping for ingredients, and was looking for a recipe to use with ingredients I had.  Our group has to serve tea and snacks tomorrow after the morning church service, and I'm sure they will love these.  I made 4 times the quantity and got 4 doz beautiful looking muffins!  I baked them in paper cups.  To top it all, it is one of the easiest recipes I've ever tried, and I will definitely be baking this again in future.  Many thanks for the recipe!

Very easy recipe. For us they turned out a bit on the dry side, even though I added a bit of extra orange juice in case the raisins needed it. Tolerable, but not as moist as other recipes we use (the ones that use yogurt). I really liked that this recipe has so little sugar, but these also seemed overly salty to us. Next time I would reduce the salt and possibly increase the sugar slightly. Really like the combination of orange and raisins; just seems to need a bit of tweaking in our kitchen :) Oh, and the crust on top looked amazing - they are a really beautiful muffin :)

In 2009, I made a recipe from this site called Orange Raisin Muffins. They were wonderful. I saved the recipe to Word and have made it at least a dozen of times since then. My friend asked for the recipe and I sent her this link, just assuming it was the same recipe. Her muffins were not good; tasteless and dry. She swore up and down that she followed the recipe exactly. When I looked at this recipe versus the one I had saved in Word, I realized it wasn't even close to the same recipe. I can't seem to find the other recipe, so who knows what happened, but trust me, there are much better orange raisin muffin recipes out there. The one I loved had you grind up the whole orange, peel and all, in the blender, which gave it an amazing orange flavor. It also used butter instead of oil, more sugar, all juice instead of milk/juice, and a different ratio of baking powder, baking soda and salt.

WOW
these muffins are great, fluffy, soft, and light. the orange is great and tangy. I added a bit more sugar, and cooked for 22 mins. i also added dark chocolate chips for some sourness. definitely a keeper!

This recipe is really dependent on the raisins for its sweetness. If you don't get a bite with some fruit, they are bland. 

To health it up a little, I replaced 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat and replaced the oil with applesauce - didn't like the flavor much, but my toddler ate them.

I liked this recipe because the little amount of sugar needed to sweeten it. It turned out moist and with a good flavor. This will make a great breakfast muffin. The only thing I changed was to put half wheat and half white flour. I will make it again.

I made this recipe with approx. 1/3 wheat flour, and used the juice from the orange I zested.  The raisins added that needed sweetness to make this yummy.  Also, my batter was a little THICK so I bumped the temp down to 375.  Maybe that's also why mine were chewier.  Mine did turn out a little 'heathy tasting' - but it was my own doing.

Loved this recipe! I used butter instead of oil and because I don't like too much sugar, I used only 1-1/2 tablespoons. The sweetness of the raisins was enough to bring out the flavour. The batter seemed abit thick at first, but the muffins turned out beautifully. Next time, I'll cut down the baking time to 18-19 minutes, so it won't turn out too dry. Every oven is different, so will adjust accordingly. Anyway, on the whole - the muffins were really delicious. Definitely will use this recipe again and again. It's going into my recipe file for keeps.

the only reason I'm not giving this 5* is because the 1st time I made these, the presentation wasn't perfect for me, as they didn't all turn out the same rounded shape & quite a few cracked on top when fully raised, Maybe they were a little high in the oven, but they were really light, and plenty moist enough, very tasty and the orange taste was not overpowering.  I glazed them for a shiny look, with confectionery sugar, some of the orange juice and a tad of water. The second time I made these, some of the muffins the raisins had sank, but a colleague at work told me to flour them before adding to mixture, so will try that, I probably mixed the raisins instead of the folding action. will have to keep an eye on that for next time, I may give it a 5 then:-)

Kinda bland but luckily I had extra raisins (actually I accidentally spilled them into the batter) so the muffins were edible.

These muffins are so good.  Perfect orange flavor.  I did cut back the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and did not add raisins.  I may try golden raisins the next time.
