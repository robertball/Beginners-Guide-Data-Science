I'm not a huge cole slaw fan, but this is pretty tasty. I did substitute the mayo for plain, full-fat greek yogurt and it made the dish healthier and creamier.

I've been making this Hawaiian coleslaw for about 20 years and it's one of our faves.  I use packaged coleslaw mix and leave out the raisins.  Making it the day before you intend to eat it gives time for the flavor to marry.   It's a nice flavor blend of sweet and tart with the added crunch of the chopped almonds. Yummy.
