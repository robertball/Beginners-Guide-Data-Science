These brownies were great! very moist!
only things i did different was that i used 1 cup of regular butter, softened to room temp.
added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
and i had to cook it for about 35 minutes.
other than that these were the best brownies i've had yet!

Had guests over tonight but realized 30 minutes before that I didn't have dessert.  Found this recipe and all RAVED over it!!!  Instead of the butter, I did use coconut oil and it was awesome!!  Probably will never buy a mix again as this was SO easy!!!

I used 1 cup of softened unsalted butter and added 1 tsp. of vanilla like other posters suggested. I also added a 1/2 tsp of salt and used 3 eggs instead of 4! I baked it for 35 mins and it came out perfect!

We used margarine instead of buttery spread, and they turned out moist and chocolatey, better than a box mix.

Things that work on this recipe:
-Mmmm chocolate
-Simply constructed/ingredients are usually stocked in the pantry
-Taste was alright

Things that didn't work:
-Lots of eggs and butter... but it's dessert so who's counting
-Took twice as long to cook in an 8x8 (normally don't have to add that much time for thickness, and who wants 1/4" brownies) and the edges rose heavily while the middle sunk, which leads to...
-Too cake like and not chewy enough

Overall not bad; but not great either.

These brownies were good! Moist and rich enough. I decided to cut 1/2 cup of sugar and used butter instead and baked it for 30 minutes. So easy to make and it looks solid!

Yummy brownies. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you should ALWAYS use salt!!! ALWAYS!!!! So I added a 1/2 tsp of salt. Family loved them.

I didn't have cocoa or sugar.  So, I substituted Nesquik (2 cups worth)- my kids loved them!  Although they were slightly dry.  We will remake, possibly with less eggs next time.  (A little cake like) .

The flavor was good but they were barely even cooked after 30 minutes. So it was a matter of guessing when they were done.

Wonderful. I only had butter so that was used. I also skipped the chips so I could cook them in heart shaped mini-tins. Plan on these for a bake sale. 5 star approved by those I shared with. However, the next three times I made these, they fell completely flat and over flowed beyond use. I'm an experienced cook, but my baking skills have deteriorated since my daughter is so much better. But I did salvage the crumbs into a biscotti recipe to replace chocolate chips!

Ok I made this on a whim, so I had to adjust some things. I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup margarine ( I didn't have enough butter) I added some vanilla too. It took an hour in the oven. The edges rose and the middle sank. It literally fell into pieces when I took it out of the pan. Maybe I just suck at cooking idk. It tasted pretty good; kinda dry. I wish I tried adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt, as others suggested, but  I didn't. I think I will be using another recipe next time; I am very disappointed.

I've made this twice. Both times I used regular butter. The first time it was perfect. The second time I didn't have any chocolate chips. I thought the brownies shouldn't need them that bad, so I made it without them. It was a big mistake. It was dry and didn't taste very good or chocolatey like the first time.

I used butter and vanilla as a substitute for the Melt.  They were pretty moist but really lacked in flavor.  I'll be trying a different recipe next time.
