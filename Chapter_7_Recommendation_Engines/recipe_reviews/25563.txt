This frosting was just okay - I should've heeded the advice of many others and added more cocoa powder and less powdered sugar, as the overwhelming taste is sweet, not chocolately.  Also, the cocoa powder and butter really need to mix for awhile, and get a spatula in there to make sure it's not at the bottom of the mixer...I found a little residue at the bottom after I added the powdered sugar.  I made this to frost chocolate pound cake from this site, and didn't end up using it (the cake stands alone and the frosting just wasn't good enough)...I'll let my kids decide if they want to put it on the cake or just on graham crackers later!

This frosting took a rather average "Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies" recipe and made it one of distinction! I used half a recipe for a 9x9" pan, using butter rather than margarine, a little less powdered sugar, a bit more cocoa and half and half, a couple teaspoons of corn syrup, and about 1/2 tsp. chocolate extract in addition to the vanilla. Creamy, soft, satiny, glossy, chocolatey good.

This is a fudgey tasting chocolate frosting that sets up nicely without cracking or getting hard. I used butter instead of margarine, added 1/4t salt, and cut the sugar to 3 cups, since some reviewers said it was too sweet. This was perfect for my family, especially on Karen Dunn's Chocolate Applesauce Cake (this site). Thanks for a great treat, Tianne.

i added a lot more cocoa powder and it was pretty good, but next time i make it i'll use softened butter instead of margarine. definately let it rest and re-mix it before you use it.

I loved this recipe!  However, I found that I could feel the sugar and cocoa powder in the texture of it.  So, I let it rest on the counter for a fews hours.  Then, I whipped again.  It was perfect after that!  Thanks!

Good, creamy frosting. Quick and easy. Be sure to mix the margarine and cocoa well-no lumps. I used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. It was sweet enough. A little more cocoa would give it a richer chocolate flavor. Will make often!

WONDERFUL!! I'VE FOUND THAT USING COCOA INSTEAD OF CHOCOLATE PIECES ALWAYS MAKES A BETTER TASTING PRODUCT. I ALWAYS USE COCOA FOR FUDGE, CAKES, FROSTINGS, ETC.  IT JUST HAS A DISTINCTIVE FLAVOR THAT I ABSOLLUTELY LOVE...& THIS ONE'S SO EASY. ALSO, IT HELPS TO SIFT TOGETHER THE COCOA & SUGAR FOR A SMOOTHER TEXTURE!

Nice frosting!  I used butter instead of margarine, added more cocoa and used half and half instead of milk.  I had to play with this a bit, but overall pretty good.

Great, creamy recipe.  Use BUTTER.  If you get lumps after you add the cold milk, just zap the entire mixture in the microwave for 10-15 second and mix again.  I used 3 cups powdered sugar (was perfectly sweet) and increased cocoa to 2/3 cups. Use heavy cream for a shinier finish (similar to a ganache texture).  Also, you can subsitute buttermilk instead of milk for a wonderful buttermilk, chocolate frosting.  If you do, keep sugar at 3 1/2 cups. **I use this to frost Dark Chocolate Cake II - super.

Super good, and super easy!  I put it on top of "Black Magic Cake" (from this site) that I made into cupcakes.  Great!  I would suggest not adding all the milk at once - I alternately added milk, then the confectioner's sugar, and didn't end up needing all the milk.  Might have made it a bit runny if I had used it all.  I also use 1/2 this recipe on the "Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies" from this site - awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

I needed a quick and easy chocolate frosting recipe to go with the peanut butter brownies that were cooling. This was it! So quick and easy and you can do it all with a whisk! I did, however, only use two cups of the sugar and it was great.

The reviews were so mixed on this that I was almost afraid to try this recipe...I'm glad I did. I used a 1/2 cup butter and followed the recipe otherwise. What I got was a creamy frosting that held it's shape when piped in a big swirl on the top of peanut butter cupcakes. This was neither too sweet or too cocoa intense. I'd highly recommend this recipe to others and will use it often.

I don't know why this recipe only has 4-1/2 stars.  I have used it for years and it's the only chocolate frosting recipe I ever trust.  It is extremely versatile - can be piped, or thinned and drizzled and everything else in between.  I don't know how many times I've made it - seems like zillions and it always comes out perfect.  Have made it with regular cocoa, as well as Hershey's special dark cocoa.  It is a wonderful frosting and/or filling.

The frosting turned out get great, chocolatey and moist.  I changed the measurements a bit -- 1/2cup butter, 3/4cup cocoa  powder, and 2 cups sugar.  That way it wasn't too sweet like some of the reviewers mentioned.

I only used maybe 3 TBS of milk and I ran out of icing sugar after only using around 2-1/2 cups... But it turned out delicious! I didn't have that too-sweet taste going on that some people have mentioned. I didn't melt the margarine, and I beat the icing for a bit, then let it sit for 30+ minutes and beat it again. I used it on Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing, Tia!

Toward the end, when I was adding additional powdery stuff to adjust the consistency, I added more cocoa powder instead of more confectioner's sugar.  I feel this really enhanced the flavor, as it was getting too sweet and not chocolate-y enough.  I was so pleased with the result.  This is a great, easy recipe which I will surely use often.  Many thanks to the author!

I took the advice of others on here and increased the cocoa and decreased the confectioner, and it's still too confectionery tasting.  Not a fan.

Like a few others, I subbed butter for the margarine and didn't bother to melt it. I used it softened and it was fine. Also used whipping cream in place of the milk because I had it and also figured it would hold up a bit better for piping purposes and I was right. Excellent taste.

Really good frosting.  I was a bit hesistant at first because I never made a buttercream type frosting with melted butter...and yes, I used butter not margarine.  I took the advise of other reviewers and added a couple extra tablespoons of the coco and cut back to about 2 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar.  Used this on the Cream Filled Cupcakes from this site.

I think this is a great chocolate frosting!  I used *real* butter and upped the cocoa and it was very chocolatey!  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but it tasted good to me.  If you are a chocoholic, this is def for you!  I swirled it w/vanilla butter cream frosting to top red velvet cupcakes.  Thanks for a great chocolate frosting!

My absolutely favorite chocolate frosting! It comes out perfect everytime and the taste is creamy and delicious.  I do use butter instead of margarine, but otherwise everything else the same.  The better the cocoa powder the better the frosting!

I just made this recipe with my two girls, ages 5&7 , and not only was it easy, it was delicious. The girls helped me mix and measure so it was a group effort,and when I asked them what they thought I should say in the review they said "Write that it is so good we almost fainted!". I think that sums it up nicely. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome *VERY* chocolate frosting. I was really worried at first when I mixed the butter and cocoa (seemed like not enough butter and was really dark). Then I moved the mixture into my blender (no REAL mixer sadly) and- WOW! After not giving up and adding more and more of the sugar (I had to stir by hand at first each time I added sugar) the frosting got very thick and wonderful! I used the full 3 1/2 cups of sugar and a little more then the called for milk (mine was nonfat). I will NEVER buy chocolate frosting from a can again! Thank you this was my first time making frosting and I feel great. (: Oh, I made cupcakes BTW. I think this might be hard to spread on a large cake. It's kind of like the frosting (icing) you find on donuts (only thicker).

This frosting has great consistency, and easy to spread, but a little too chocolatey for me. Very dense and rich. Overall, a good chocolate frosting though.

I would reccomend this recipe if you don't have any evaporated milk--that's what happened to me!

First thing, make sure that you sift all of the powdered sugar through a little strainer, it makes it finer and not gritty.. 
I used butter, not margarine, and I actually doubled the amount of  butter to 1/2 cup and it worked out well, it wasn't melted either, it was warm..
Like a lot of reviews said, I added less powdered sugar and more cocoa and it turned out great! Really good frosting :) I am using it for my amazing chocolate cake.

Definitelyl reccomend trying this! Check many reviews to see what people suggest adding! (:

This frosting was really good! It came out creamy and easy to spread, but I used significantly less sugar than called for (just under 2 cups), and like many people suggested, added a bit more cocoa.

Just used this to top Dark Chocolate Cake II from this website. I only had skim milk, and no vanilla extract on hand, but this still turned out fine. Definitely reduce the sugar.

Really good frosting... I did add an extra tbs of butter (not margerine) and a tbs of honey to cut the taste of the powdered sugar. So much better than the store bought stuff. Thanks Tianne for the great recipe!

I took the advice of others and upped the cocoa.  I started at 3/4 cup and then just added enough powdered sugar to get the consistency that I wanted.  In subsequent batches, I threw in even more cocoa.  Everyone thinks it is the bomb!  I had no problems with clumping (I used a hand mixer) and just threw in cocoa at different times during the mixing process using a "taste as you go" method of measuring.  *WARNING*  This method can cause severe sugar shock!

Wonderful and I will never buy store-bought again!  (Keep in mind that this recipe calls for confectioner's sugar and if you have ever made icing for cookies, you know you have to keep adding milk until you get the consistency you want.  If this frosting is too thick, just slowly add a little more milk.  If it is too loose, slowly add a little more sugar! You can't go wrong. Thank you very much.

bad bad bad! I made this frosting for a cake and it COMPLETELY demolished it...it was way too sticky. Instead of spreading over the cake, it just made the cake completely come apart...do not make it!!! It ruined my good cake! :(

A nice basic frosting, albeit a little grainy. Like others, I upped the cocoa to 2/3 cup, and used only 2.5 cups confectioner's sugar.

This is sooooo good!  I used about 1/4 cup less powdered sugar than the recipe calls for, and I had to add more milk for a creamy consistency.  This tastes incredible with the Chocolate Mayo Cake submitted by Virginia Godd. It also looks very pretty.  It's WAY better than store-bought frosting.

A nice glossy frosting. This frosting was smooth in texture and easy to frost, "Banana Cupcakes," also from this website. I cut back on the amount of powdered sugar to about 3 cups while increasing the unsweetended cocoa powder a bit more. I opted to use 1/4 cup of melted butter instead of margarine and half and half milk with 1 tsp vanilla extract. I had to beat the frosting a bit until I achieved a smooth consistency then added a bit more half and half and sugar where I thought necessary. What I liked about this particular frosting recipe is that it did not hardened up at all on my cupcakes and it maintained its creamy texture. Also, this recipe uses cocoa powder whereas others call for chocolate squares - a nice change. Thou I am not a chocolate fan I had no complaints from anyone.

None of my 5 family members were thrilled with this. Even after the suggested adjustments (less sugar, more cocoa) it was sickeningly sweet. It tasted like putting hershey's syrup on top of cake. It was easy, though, which is why it does get 2.

I liked it and so did my husband, the really picky eater!  Given other reviews I increased the cocoa powder by about a tablespoon (I like chocolate!).  Then as I was mixing in the powdered sugar I did some taste tests.  At about 2.5 cups added it was sweet enough for my simple cake.  I then added enough milk so that it would spread without tearing my cake.  After those minor adjustments it was perfect!  Thank you for the recipe.

This Chocolate Frosting is great just as the recipe is written.  I took the advise of other reviewers and found the frosting was ruined.  When I did make it according to directions it came out great!  If it is too sweet I would suggest adding a bit more butter instead of cutting down on sugar.  When you cut down on sugar the frosting will not have the correct consistency.

Thank you! This is wonderful.. it tastes like the betty crocker packaged chocolate icing, without that strange aftertaste. Also, it is much easier to work with & spread. I followed the reviews and only used 2.5 cups of sugar

This frosting had such a smooth velvety consistancy, and it had a wonderful chocolate flavor.  My only suggestion for people trying to frost a double layer cake is that you will need to probably double the recipe and add more milk so that it  won't pull your cake apart.

This recipe is a good start, but I felt it was way too sweet for me.  It also got thin the first two times I made it, so to try and balance out the sweetness, I threw in two VERY heaping tablespoons of shortening in it along with a pinch of flour, and wow, it got fluffy, chocolately and just wonderful!  This altered version, for me, is a keeper!  thanks for sharing it1

A solid and good chocolate frosting, but not exceptional.  I prefer my frostings to be VERY  chocolately and rich.  It frosted my cake nicely, but the next day it was a bit droopy and runny on the cake.

Love this icing.  After beating, the consistency was perfect.  I didn't have to add more milk or anything.  Frosted the "too much chocolate cake" recipe.  Both turned out perfect.  Icing was sweet but not too sweet.

I made this on a whim one night and it turned out great. Super simple and tasted just like the frosting that you'd buy from the store.

I'm so glad i cut down on the sugar. Even without the full written amount, it was really sweet.
However, it was an incredible frosting to go with the cake I made, and very easy to spread!

Not great. I tried this with all the suggested modifications and still had to punt.  The mixture seized after I added the milk, so I had to re-warm it over a double-boiler before I could blend in the sugar.  Then, after sitting covered at room temperature for about an hour, it was too stiff to pipe through a large star tip.  Fortunately, I was being lazy and had used a zip-top bag instead of a pastry bag, so I was able to add milk and knead it until it was loose enough to pipe.  But then it was too much like ganache to hold any shape and just sort of oozed all over the tops of the cupcakes. It does taste good, but I won't bother with it again.

Super easy--was looking for something to go on a 8x8 vanilla cake at the last minute.  Cut this in half, added a dash of salt and used butter.  Good flavor, good texture.

Good with revisions... Made cupcakes last night and saw this recipe for frosting. Only read a couple reviews, but most said the chocolate flavor didn't shine through. I kept the recipe the same except added one square of unsweetened chocolate which I melted along with the margarine. Delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. (after the addition of more chocolate). ;)

Awesome! I did add an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa, and 1/2 cup less of powdered sugar! Smooth, rich, creamy, easy to work with! I was skeptical melted margarine? I'm a believer now! Yummy!

Very good!  I halved the recipe to lightly frost an 8x8 pan of "Quick and Easy Brownies" from this site. I was able to use a whisk for the first part, and a spatula to finish it up. Great flavor, color & texture.

This was ok...just very sweet.  Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and add more cocoa and less powdered sugar.  I don't think the butter mixes as well when it is fully melted - I think softened would be better.  I will also add a little salt.  I did use butter because I don't care for margarine.  I found that 3 1/4 cups powdered sugar made for a spreadable consistency.  I let this mix on med-hi speed in the Kitchen Aide for about 5 minutes to make a nice, fluffy frosting.

Really yummy! I put this frosting on the chocolate chip cookie dough + cupcakes = the best cupcakes ever recipe. I followed the advise of other reviewers and used real butter, 3 cups of powdered sugar and about 1/3 cup of extra baking cocoa. It had a rich chocolate flavor. This is my new frosting recipe:) THANKS

This was very good and quick to make. I used oil instead of the suggested melted margarine. I decreased some of the powdered sugar and increased some of the cocoa powder to make it more chocolaty. I also used hot water instead of the milk to keep this recipe non-dairy. I used this to frost the inside and outside of a double layer s'mores brownie cake and topped the cake with mini marshmallows, chopped up graham crackers, chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. I then melted some extra chocolate chips into the left over frosting and drizzled that over the cake! It was delicious!!

I tried the recipe as it is, and I couldn't really use the frosting that it yielded. I tried again and cut the sugar back to 2-2 1/2 cups, and increased the cocoa by about 1/3 of a cup. I also added in some coffee, as I had brewed some while making the Black Magic Cake from this site. The frosting was then a bit runny, so I had to add flour on top of that, but after all the alterations it turned out great. The recipe listed here isn't anything special, but it lays a good foundation and you can easily play around with it to get a sweetness and consistency that suits your tastes, and in that sense it was very helpful. Also, one mistake I made was not to sift the cocoa powder and sugar, so I did end up with some clumping, but will remember to do so next time.

Very good chocolate frosting. I used 3/4 cup Ghirardelli cocoa  powder and 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. I put the powdered sugar in a little at a time to blend into a very nice frosting. This frosting is a little stiff, but it is just what I wanted. Nice and fudge tasting. Held up to sitting out all day at birthday party.

I initially planned to follow other reviews and cut the sugar down when I made this, but I found that I needed all  the sugar to get the right consistency. So, I ended up following the recipe exactly and it turned out great. If you're expecting frosting just like what you get in a tub at the store this isn't it, but  this does have a rich chocolate flavor and it was great on cupcakes. It was pretty sweet and a thin layer of frosting was plenty. It would be perfect for brownies too! I had enough for 15 cupcakes.

Very good frosting recipe. The first time, I prepared as directed, but the second time, I made a few changes. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, and it had a richer, more chocolate-y flavor. I also added a dash of salt, which cut the sweetness just a little. This is a great recipe to use as a base!

Great base recipe... I think next time I will take the advice of others and use more cocoa powder and less powdered sugar (I only made a half-batch this time) but it's still good.  It goes great with the zucchini brownies (also from this site).  Yum!

This is so good I wanted to just eat spoonfuls. I used dutch processed cocoa and heavy cream. I added the sugar gradually probably about 2 cups. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This frosting was good, not great. Definitely very easy and quick, good when you need something fast. It tasted a bit too "confectionary" for my liking. But it did the job. I used only 2 1/2 Cups Powdered Sugar and that was definitely enough; I also added 2 tbl spoons of milk after mixing in the sugar. I might make again if I need something quick, but otherwise i'll stick to my Buttercream Frosting.

I used Dutch-processed cocoa instead of the normal cocoa powder and the frosting turned out to be super chocolatey, darker and delicious! I also added less sugar (2 1/2 cups) to avoid the cloying sweetness other reviewers have mentioned.

I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and increased the sugar content by adding Splenda to the recipe.
Mine turned out nice and fluffy.

I must have done something wrong, maybe I didn't mix it enough after I added the milk and vanilla but it was grainy and thin. I threw it away and made a different chocolate frosting.

Very chocolatety frosting, a little thin, (but that may have been my fault for not beating it long enough), I'm not sure that the kids cared though.  It was good on top of the chewy peanutbutter brownies (from this site).  Thanks Tianne.

I took the advice of many...  used only 2 Cups icing sugar which was plenty sweet for me and added an extra quarter-cup of cocoa.  I also used 10% cream instead of milk and butter instead of margarine.  Tasted rich, smooth and lovely on my Chocolate Zucchini cake!

Easy and quick, very tasty! Saturday night and my boyfriend wanted cake, I didn't have frosting so I made this, also used butter (what I had) . The only problem was the butter cooled too quickly.  I quickly added hot water to the pan I melted butter in popped the mixing bowl on top and it easily warmed the mixture. I will make this again

This is what I changed:

2/3c cocoa powder, 2c confec sugar, 1/2tsp salt, 1/2c "I can't believe it's not butter". (Didn't have any butter but this worked out great!) & 2/3c of heavy cream. Sift your sugar & cocoa!!! If you don't have a sifter do like I did and use a small wire colander. It makes your frosting smoother and the heavy cream made it look like a chocolate ganache. I don't like overly sweet frosting so the 2 cups of confer sugar worked out great for me. I used a spatula to mix everything, no mixer needed.  I always read the reviews before I start which always helps in my cooking & baking.

I'm the 500th review!  :)  I found this recipe to be good and so easy but wish I had known the following before starting: 1. 3 1/2 c powdered sugar is too sweet, as other reviewers have commented.  Should increase cocoa & decrease sugar.  2. When the milk is added to the butter/cocoa mixture (note: margarine does not enter my house), the combination seizes up and won't combine with the milk until the sugar is added.  Just makes a sloppy mess.  Once sugar is added, all igredients meld together perfectly.  3. Cake decorators: the frosting WILL form a nice crust suitable for decorating. 4. Would be a little less one-note with the addition of 1 tsp. espresso powder 5. This recipe makes a lot of frosting - too much for my little 9x9 pan, but probaby the perfect amount for a sheet cake.  Definitely appeared to be more than the 2 cups stated.  6. I used a wire whisk in lieu of a hand mixer and it turned out great.  7. I used Trader Joe's cocoa and next time will try with a higher-end (Callebaut,Valrhona, Pernigotti, etc.) cocoa product.  Good recipe!

This is an amazing and easy recipe. I had to make black colour frosting for a Mickey Mouse cake for my son's 1st birthday. I did everything to make black frosting without black colour (online people suggested mix all sorts of colour to make black but nothing worked). Then I decided to use a dark and thick chocolate frosting and this did wonders!!! The reviews were correct use a less sugar and just keep beating it for a little longer. The more I beat the frosting and kept adding blue and green liquid colour to get black colour the shinier and soft it became. The frosting tasted heavenly. Going to save this for all my chocolate cake adventures ??

This recipe was just what I was looking for. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but I'll have to cut back a little on my next try. The first chocolate frosting I've made...all natural is AWESOME! I used butter instead of margarine. Thanks for sharing. My son helps me. He made the cake and helped on the frosting. I even let him spread. :)

This is by far the absolute best chocolate frosting I've ever made or tasted!!!!!! It's the perfect consistency and taste! For personal dietary reasons, I don't use dairy milk I use coconut milk, and it works great. Thanks for the recipient Tia!

Great frosting, what else could be said? Easy to put together, creamy texture and great chocolate flavor. I'll be bookmarking this one, thanks! Oh, and I didn't read a single review prior to making this, which is unusual for me. I did nothing "extra" here, no changing amounts, no pre-sifting any of the ingredients, just followed the directions as written for a smooth, yummy frosting.

I gave it four stars because it's easy, but there were some problems. Next time I make this, I'll definitely have to add more cocoa, as this had a much more sweet-sugar taste than it did a chocolate one. I'll definitely use butter next time instead of margarine. Margarine just doesn't taste right, to me. And, I'll sift the cocoa powder into the sugar, instead of beating it into the margarine/butter. It took forever to mix with the margarine, which made the whole recipe take much longer than the 15 minutes stated; and I couldn't get it smooth until I started adding the sugar anyway. One thing I did by accident that I found I liked, though, is that I added too much vanilla. I was measuring over the mixing bowl, and spilled probably about an extra teaspoon of vanilla into it. I think that may have made me like it more than I would have if I'd used the measurement in the recipe. This isn't a horrible icing recipe, over all; but it does need some tweaking to make it better.

I had a major mix up. I used 1 1/3 cup of cocoa and then used three cups of powdered sugar but it was some of the best frosting I'd ever had even if it did keep sticking to everything. By the time I was done I was literally covered in frosting. Frosted 15 large cupcakes easily.

This was great, I used it to decorate a large chocolate chip cookie/cake. There was plenty with about a cup of frosting left over. I also used butter ( I never use margarine in anything). I will use this recipe again. Used this again for a birthday cake and it's fabulous, once you give it a taste you have trouble stopping. One reason I like this recipe is I always have cocoa powder on hand. Update: I have a grandchild that can't have milk (and therefore butter either) so I modified this using Crisco butter flavor shortening for the butter and Almond milk in place of the milk. It was still great and no one even noticed.

This is a good recipe, but be careful about adding more powdered sugar.  i added to much the second time I made it, and the result was a thick, hard to spread frosting.

I made this frosting for some vanilla cupcakes, and it was perfect! I used butter instead of margarine. One recipe will frost about a dozen cupcakes, so if you're making 2 dozen cupcakes, be sure to double this recipe.

Very good and easy, added a little half n half to thin so it would spread easier and little extra punch of flavor.

Bump up cocoa to about 3/4 cup and just add enough sugar to right consistency - no where near 3-1/2 cups!

This was not appealing to me. It was kind of bland. I'm not sure if it was the ratio of cocoa/powdered sugar or what, but it just didn't work. Not enough chocolate flavor. I don't think increasing the cocoa would help. I wasn't fond of the texture either.

Very good fudgy frosting.  Based on suggestions from other reviewers I used 3 cups powdered sugar and a bit extra cocoa powder and a dash of salt.  Put in extra milk until it was the proper consistency for spreading.

It was tastey. I use butter instead, and a LOT of extra sugar because it was too liquidy. I added as much as  I needed until It was a lot thicker.

Great taste. I used melted butter instead of margarine, but accidentally added the powdered sugar before the milk. It turned into a crumbly mess. I added the milk afterward, but there were still crumbs in the frosting. I used about 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.

This frosting is so good.  I made it this past weekend for Graduation cupcakes for my niece (see photo I posted).  I'm making cupcakes with this frosting again this week for my husbands birthday treat to take to work!  Yum!  I made it exactly as written (using the margarine too).  Turned out perfectly!

I don't see what's the big whoop. I don't think it's that great. It is overwhelmingly sweet, and not thick enough either, I had to add more cocoa and powder. Plus I dislike the way the butter is melted, it should have just been softened this would help with the consistency of the the thin frosting. The good news was my cake was bitter, so if your cake is not too sweet then this frosting will taste okay.

I was hoping for a thicker, "whipped" texture like in most of the cupcake photos on here where they have swirls on top.  Mine came out quite runny.  Maybe adding more powdered sugar would have fixed that, but I felt that it was almost too sweet already, and didn't want it to be more so. I tried adding more cocoa, but it didn't change it much. The frosting also looked grainy.  The milk didn't beat in smoothly or easily at all.  Is this because I used butter instead of margarine?  Or maybe because it was my first attempt at homemade frosting and just missed some unwritten rule?  Don't get me wrong, the taste was still nice on the cake that I made, but it's a good thing it was just a square pan cake for my husband and I that didn't need to look "pretty".  I didn't get the overall result I was hoping for.

This Frosting Recipe is good.... but I will have to agree with the other reviewers that I did tend to taste a little powder sugary..... But still very creamy and good.... next time I will try adding more butter and cocoa.... Will definately use again though

I'll confess, I changed alot of this recipe. But, in my defense, I cannot have dairy or sugar, and I didn't want my gluten-free cupcakes to be naked.   I used butter, coconut milk, carob powder with a splash of cocoa powder, and 1 2/3 cup coconut sugar and 1/3 cup powdered maple syrup. It had moments where it was really difficult to blend fully, but I let it sit for a bit, then went back to finish beating it. It turned out for me a cross between a thick glaze and a soft frosting. (if I could use powdered sugar, it would've been perfect!) As it was,  the flavor is AMAZING!!! So delicious! Thank you for this base recipe!

I used this recipe as a basic formula for my own dark chocolate cupcake frosting.  I used 1 stick of butter, 1 cup plus 4 tbsp. dark cocoa, 1/2 cup heavy cream and only 1 1/2 cup confectioner sugar since I wanted the frosting to be more chocolatey than sweet. I whipped this all in my kitchenaid for quite some time, then I piped this onto Simple White Cake (from here) cupcakes and it was TO DIE FOR.

Great frosting recipe! I did what other suggestions and increased the cocoa powder and decreased the powdered sugar.  Although it was a lot more runny than I had hoped, it turned out great!

Very good recipe. I had no margarine, so used butter. I will add more cocoa next time to give it an even more chocolatey flavor and DEFINITELY scrape the bottom to make sure you don't have any butter/cocoa residue left or it will appear as lumps later! Beautiful texture and appearance - definitely a keeper!

Great frosting! Lovely rich chocolate flavor. The only changes I made were to use real butter instead of margarine and I added an extra tablespoon of milk. Turned out nice and creamy!

Delicious and so easy! I cut the recipe in half and used about 1/3 cup less sugar than called for and it was the perfect balance of sweet and chocolate. I used on "Butter Cake" recipe on this site made into cupcakes. My husband's favorite is yellow cake with chocolate icing and he ate 4 cupcakes before I could finish frosting them. Yummy!

This recipe needs doctoring.  I use 1/2 cup of real butter, 3/4 cup cocoa, 1/3 cup milk, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 cups powder sugar and it is perfect!  Also, sift all dry ingredients to ensure a smooth texture.  Give it a try this way and you'll be happy!

Yum. I used three cups of 10x sugar and it worked well. It took a bit to stir and mash the lumps out of the butter and cocoa powder but well worth it.

GREAT! i used real butter and 2 1/2 cups sugar. also i refrigerated until i was ready to frost and it was very thick and rich. in fact so thick i didnt think it would be enough to frost a whole cake but it was more than enough so dont skimp on the middle layer. worked great

i loved this but i must admit i butchered the original recipe based on other's reviews - upped the cocoa to 1 cup, decresed the sugar to 2 3/4 cups, and increased the milk pretty significantly. the result was a thinner, satiny chocolate glaze, not so much a frosting. it was delish!

Wonderful recipe!  Thank you.  Per other reviews, I only used 3 cups of sugar and it was just right.  The recipe made enough to cover a 9x13 cake generously.

OMG Good!  I used 1c of cocoa and 3c of sugar.  I did have to add about 1 Tbsp more of milk.  Didn't seem like it was going to be spreadable until I added all of the sugar.  Then the little extra milk made it great!  We will use this again.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I think it had too much sugar in it. It basically ended up like a chocolate buttercream, which I wasn't looking for. However, if you only add half of the amount of powdered sugar called for, its perfect.

Wayyy too much sugar and not enough cocoa. I ended up mixing in a tub of store-bought chocolate frosting just so I could use it. It didn't taste good at all.

Yup - a little less white sugar - little more cocoa powder and this is perfect!  And I added the milk as I went so as not over do it since I'd changed the other ingredients.  Thick, chocolately and fudgey - very tasty.

This is the same frosting recipe I have used for many years. It always turns out great. I also love to mix a container of cool whip topping with a store bought container of chocolate frosting for a wonderful not so sweet whipped frosting keep the cake in the fridge.

Good, but very very sweet.  Good texture and spreadability, good chocolate taste.  The small quantity of butter compared to other frostings is made up for by the large amount of sugar!

Delicious! Made this to go on 'Chocolate Cupcakes' and it turned out so well. Great flavour and consistency. However, I used it to spread on 16 cupcakes and there was a lot leftover, so I would reduce the quantity next time. Many thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe turned out great even with a few substitutes for my food allergic son (peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs).  I replaced the butter with 3 TB of light flavored olive oil and rice milk for the milk.  I followed the advice of others and heaped the 1/2 cup cocoa powder and used only 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar.  The flavor and consistency was great.  (It goes great with the Divvies cupcake recipe found on Martha Stewart's website.)

Oh Yum! This was great, cut the confex sugar down to 3c. as per other reviewers, used butter instead of margarine and Hershey's cocoa. Scrumptious on my boxed vanilla cake!LOL...so glad I didnt have canned frosting in the house cause this was perfect.

This was just ok for me. very sweet and had a weird taste to it...I cant put my finger on what it was.. in order to get it thick enough, i would have had to put a lot of powdered sugar in it, but it already had too much when I quit adding it...eh...I wont make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  Very rich and super easy when you use your hand mixer.  I used my kitchenaid and it came out perfect with no lumps.  My husband told me to never buy the tubs of frosting again!

Fantastic! I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups because it was already sweet enough for me. I also added just a little bit of orange juice (since I was frosting a chocolate and orange cake). Really was great. Would not have frosted a 2 layer cake, but worked well for my single layer 9x13 cake (not frosting the sides)

Spread easily and was nice and chocolately.  I used butter (instead of margarine) and I used only 2.5 cups of powdered sugar and it was sweet enough to my taste.  Nice and simple recipe.  I recommend adding the sugar a half cup at a time and tasting to see how sweet you like it.

This frosting is great- so quick & easy to make, good chocolate flavor and the thickness is adaptable to your tastes, depending on how much milk vs powdered sugar you use. For those of you experiencing lumps, make sure you always start with room temperature ingredients. It makes a huge difference!

i had to mess with the amounts of everything here since i had just over a quarter cup of cocoa and not a lot to frost anyway. so i tried to adjust the best i could, and it still came out great. very smooth and sweet and chocolatey. we used margarine and soy milk, too.

I thought this frosting was excellent but I used 1 cup less sugar than called for (hence the 4 stars). It was the perfect amount of sweetness, had a rich chocolate flavor and smooth creamy texture. It went perfect with my yellow bunt cake that I made from a boxed mix. I hate canned icing and this was a very easy alternative for a quick desert. I made it in about 5 minutes while the cake was in the oven.

This is a fabulous recipe.  For easier mixing, try combining the cocoa with the powdered sugar, WELL, with a fork.  Definately adjust the sugar to your taste and it also cuts/or increases in volume well by adding a 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup crisco shortening.  I also increased the cocoa to 2/3 cup for those of my customers who are "REAL" chocolate lovers.

Wow this is good. And I like that it doesn't have a ton of butter. I only added about half the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I think I should have added a little flour as someone suggested to thicken it up a bit.

This recipe was delicious.  I didn't measure the sugar, as most reviewers suggested, so I don't know how much sugar I actually used.  It felt like a lot, though.  The taste was wonderful and very easy to spread onto a yellow cake I made. I will definitely use this again.  Great flavor!  (I recc using a bit more cocoa, as others suggested)

EASY!  I mixed this with a whisk!  But, I had a freak-out moment when my butter and chocolate turned into cement!  YIKES!  But, I put it into the microwave for 10 seconds and that was enough to mix in the milk and vanilla.  I freaked out again when the mixture got sooooooooo thick, but adding the sugar made for a silky and easily spreadable icing.  It goes on beautifully and tastes great.  I did the sugar to taste and I don't think I used quite as much as the recipe called for- I 'eyeballed' it as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for this recipe, it's WAY BETER THAN ANYTHING FROM THE CAN!!!

A good chocolate icing although it didn't come out fluffy, it did taste great. I might make it again, but I still prefer the old fashioned crisco chocolate icing, it came out fluffier. This would have been easier to do if I had mixed the powdered sugar and cocoa together then added the liquids. The cocoa/margarine clumped when I added the cold milk and took a bit of work to get the lumps out.

Delish!!  I don't bake a lot, but today I had a mean sweet tooth.  I made the cheesecake brownies from this web site that called for choc. frosting.  Didn't have frosting so I had to make my own.  In case you are wondering, all we use is skim milk and it worked wonderfully.  I also only had 2 1/2 cups conf. sugar and it also worked out great.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness where others said this recipe was too sweet and the consistency was good too.  I iced a 9 X 13 pan of brownies and still had plenty left over.  I experimented with the leftover and added a little peanut butter to it...double yum!!

Just made this with my 17 y/o stepson Zach ...telling him he was able and that it would be way better than the instant stuff he was craving.  It was our first collaboration, a much-needed (and good) bonding exercise. He is thrilled with the results and amazed that he can actually do this.  BUT, less than HALF the sugar was more than enough.
wow...he is chatting away and has made a sandwich with the chocolate spread and peanut butter, so thanks a million!!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I am glad I did not add 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to the other ingredients!!  I didn't have enough in the house to anyway, but I added about 2 cups probably.  I thought even then it was quite sweet.  So I was in a pinch.... I needed my icing to be a bit thicker and I ran out of powdered sugar(which I really didn't want to use anyway since it was already very sweet).  I just took a chance and added about 2 Tablespoons of all purpose flour to the mix and guess what?  The icing got a little thicker and even tasted less sweet which was good!!!  So I really do love this recipe, but now I added a TWIST!!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I would have never been able to make my own creation without it!!!

This is our favorite chocolate frosting recipe!  I also personally like it as it calls for cocoa powder and not baking chocolate squares.  This recipe makes a very chocolately, rich, spreadable frosting.  We love it on homemade yellow or white cake.

This was an awesome recipe!  I did add a little more cocoa powder at the end, because with the 3 1/2 cups sugar, it was a little sweet, but that was the only change I made.  Definitely a recipe I will use again!

I'm glad I didn't add the amount of sugar the recipe called for. I only used two cups and it was still very very sweet. I added more cocoa powder, and I used 3/4 cup of butter like other reviewers suggested. the frosting turned out okay. it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. next time I'll use a little less sugar.

I made this recipe as written and my frosting was VERY lumpy and VERY thin -- so I had to add addtl powdered sugar and cocoa to get it to a decent consistencey and THEN the taste was just SWEET. It pretty much ruined the cake that I made.

I used 2 1/2 cups of icing sugar instead of 3 1/2 (feel that I could reduce even more), increased the cocoa content, and reduced the milk to slightly

This frosting recipe is super extra chocolatey and fudge-y.  It was very rich.  Got Milk?  I also used a half cup of butter instead of 1/4.  I don't know exactly how much milk and powdered sugar I used.  I just little bit of the milk then a little bit of the sugar until it got to the consistency I wanted it.  It was very easy to spread.It turned out gr8.  I doubled the recipe to frost a double layer cake ( the One Bowl Chocolate Cake 1) from this site.  I also was able to pipe it out of a decorating bag to decorate and write on my cake.  I wouldn't recommend doing any advanced cake decorating with this frosting because after a while it kind of gets melty.  (Well, I guess you could try sticking it in the fridge for a while, but I didn't try that)  I can't wait to use this frosting on a yellow cake.  (There on 2 "Chocolate Frosting I"s on this website.  If you give anyone a copy of the recipe make sure you are giving them the right one)

Good recipe--IF--you change the 1/4 cup of butter to 1/2 cup.  As soon as I saw the recipe it really looked like the proportions were off.  1/2 cup cocoa is a lot for 1/4 butter and over three cups of sugar.  The additional butter makes it excellent to spread and still retains a nice cocoa taste.  Overall an easy recipe to make as well as eat.

This recipe has a yummy, rich taste.  However, I found that it is very sticky to work with.  I had trouble with it peeling back the top layer of my cake.  The flavor is wonderful.  I will definately use this one again.

too much milk. I had to use way too much powdered sugar to make it spreading consistancy. The taste was average for chocolate frosting. I'll keep looking.

3.5 stars...Easy to make, pretty good taste, and easily spread. Smooth texture, but too light in color & chocolate taste for me. I would add more cocoa if I try this recipe again.

Very good recipe.  I frosted a cake with this.  I cut down on the sugar and used only 2 1/2 cups and it tasted great anyway.  Not overly sweet.  I also substituted soymilk for regular milk and it worked fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for the flavor of this frosting.  Not enough chocolate flavor - too much sugar.  My husband liked it but he seems to like any and all frostings :)

I was searching for chocolate icing that was a little bit more buttercream but with chocolate.  I didn't really consider this recipe that..but it was still a good recipe.  A pleasant suprise. The icing was incredibly sweet and tasted like dark chocolate.  It sets really nice.  My husband loved this.  I put it on chocolate cupcakes.  I would make this again.

The best! This is similiar to a recipe I've been using in the past, but mine didn't include the margarine-what a difference! I loved it. Make sure you mix the cocoa and margarine first like the directions say-I put it all in together and the cocoa left some lumps! But the taste is great! It's my new frosting recipe.

Fabulous frosting! Cocoa powder and margarine were a little chunky at first, but smoothed out as I added the powdered sugar. I only added about 2 1/2 cups of the powdered sugar, which in my opinion was perfect. Thanks!

When I found this recipe I was in dire need of a frosting recipe after already failed with another one on the day of my husbands birthday. This was NOT the answer to my prayers!!!  I think the recipe tasted way to much like the powdered sugar and lacked rich chocolate flavor.  I dont think I will even give it to my little ones for fear of the intense sugar rush!!!  I guess I am off to the grocery for a tub of frosting.

Delicious and easy.  I used softened, not melted, margarine.  Note:  It was just enough for 2  8" layers...might need more if I was doing larger cake.

This was my first homemade frosting and I believe it was a great choice.  I did not know where to find cocoa powder so what I did was I bought chocolate chips and melted them into the same amount of cocoa powder that was needed.  It worked so well.  One catch was, I bought milk chocolate chips because I tend to not really like the taste of semi sweet chocolate but I must say that although what I produced in the end was really sweet, it is a terrific recipe, and I can substitute reeses peanut butter chips and white chocolate to make other kinds of frostings, thank you so much!

Good taste, made with butter. One tip for people in colder climates, make sure the house is warm. My butter and cocoa seized up and I had to put over hot water to get it smooth again. Lesson learn.

I used Irish Butter and evaporated milk because that is all I had.  I halved the recipe because I just made our famous Wacky cake in a 9 inch pan  It is absolutely the best frosting I have ever tasted and I love  frosting more than the cake!

If you don’t have a lot of time and want to whip up a batch of chocolate frosting quickly, this recipe is for you. However, there is a trade off: the frosting, while intensely chocolate-tasting and rich, is only okay from a flavor perspective. It won’t win you any raves, but you probably won’t have any complaints, either. Pros: No need to leave butter out for softening; Comes together easily; Spreads smoothly.  Cons: Flavor seems slightly off from what a chocolate frosting should be; Overly cocoa powder flavored.  The only change I made is substituting butter for the margarine.

This frosting is amazing and not overly sweet. I thought it tasted a bit like chocolate pudding but that is a great thing in my opinion. I put it on a chocolate cake and it was perfect!

It tastes good, but it was very, very thick and would not spread easily so I added more milk a little at a time to make it smooth enough to spread.

I decided to make this because I had most of the ingredients on hand.  Used almond coconut milk and butter.  Used 3/4 cup cocoa powder and only 3 cups of powdered sugar as other reviewers suggested.  Turned out good!  Used it to frost a 9x13 tray of brownies, there was just enough frosting for them.  Will make this again.

I followed this recipe loosely. I used only 2 cups and 2 tablespoons of the powdered sugar. I used coconut milk, and added 2 tsp of coffee extract. It was a nice guideline to have, and got me a decent texture to start off with. I definitely think the OR calls for too much sugar, and you can definitely add a bit more cocoa powder.

I used butter (is always better than margarine), 1/2 c plus 1Tb (or so) cocoa, and 3 c of powd sugar. My husband loves it! 'Very chocolaty'.

Thanks to MommyFromSeattle for the Buttermilk idea. I added 1/3 cup buttermilk and 3 1/2 cups of sugar and 2/3 cups cocoa powder as she said. I melted the butter and used my stand mixer to mix. This made a perfectly sweet, but not too sweet frosting that covered 24 cupcakes perfectly. I will make this again and again.

I should have read the reviews before making this. It was awful. It was clumpy and I could taste the powdered suger in it. It was gross. I would never make it again. I used hersheys icing recipe and it was delicious

Like other reviews I adjusted this recipe. First, I used butter and I didn't melt it. I let is soften up. Then I whipped it with my mixer. After, I slowly added in the coca so that it wouldn't fly up and make a mess. After mixing that in I alternated between the milk and powered sugar. By alternating between the milk and sugar you can control the sweetness of the frosting. Instead of vanilla extract I used rum extract to give it a little kick since it was for St. Patty's Day!

I followed the suggestions of others & used 3/4 C of cocoa powder and butter instead of margarine & reduced the powdered sugar.  Also used half and half instead of milk, about 1/2 C.

The only change I had to make was microwaving the milk butter and cocoa mixture (cold milk doesn't mix with melted butter!) After the added twenty seconds, I let them mix for two minutes or so, to cool down before adding the powdered sugar. It turned out perfect, and I whipped it for about an extra five minutes, and it got even creamier!

3.5 cups of sugar to .5 cups of cocoa?  I used a cup of each and the frosting was still a little too sweet.

This was really good and I don't even like chocolate cake or frosting! I made it twice in two days. I made it with the simple n delicious chocolate cupcakes on this site. I used butter and 2 and a half cups of icing sugar but other than that I kept it the same. Update: I made this again and this time I used all the icing sugar called for. It was enough for 24+ cupcakes. Next time I might add some more milk to make it less stiff.

I used butter and I added a little more milk to make the frosting very spreadable. It was a very good choice for the zucchini chocolate cake! Made enough for a 9X 13" cake.

Nice, easy recipe. I made a homemade chocolate cake and half a can of store bought vanilla whip icing. I only had 1 cup of powdered sugar left so I used that and halved the rest of the ingredients; added more cocoa as suggested by others. I used butter instead of margarine. I put the rest of the store bought stuff in it and whipped it up. It made it a nice whippy texture.

I used Special Dark cocoa powder to make this dark chocolate frosting. I used softened butter instead of melted butter and added pinch of salt. I just added an extra bit of milk or extra powdered sugar to get the consistency I was looking for. I used it to pipe on cupcakes and it worked just fine and tasted delicious.

So far, so good!   I made it and incorporated suggestions from other reviewers.   I used real butter, melted, and then added sifted cocoa powder.  When I added the cold 2% milk, though, it had clumps, so I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds, and it was creamy again.   I only used 2  1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar.  When I was done with that family and I did a taste test and felt it needed some adjustments.  I added about a tablespoon more sifted cocoa powder, 1/4 tsp more vanilla and a pinch of salt.  It passed the taste test! Haven't frosted the cake, yet, but I suspect it will be delicious!  Four stars only because of the adjustments to suit our tastes.  Great foundation, though.

These cupcakes were tasty, but dense like corn cakes. They did not rise over the cupcake liner and were heavier than desired.

I doubled the batch to frost 24 cupcakes, but a single batch would have been enough!  Like many other reviewers, I used butter instead of margarine, a bit more cocoa powder (1 tbs), and about half the powdered sugar.  It combined well and had a nice chocolate flavor - yum!

I made this but used less than 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. I wanted it to be very chocolatey without being overly sweet. It's good on a yellow cake.

Ridiculously easy; made a modification. I used an exceptionally good Dutch cocoa (Droste) and cut back to 3c powdered sugar. It is the richest, most indulgent frosting ever. Why would anyone buy the artificially colored/flavored garbage when this is so easy and so much better?!

I've tried a million chocolate frosting recipes and this was the absolute best! I was out of milk so I just used water instead. It tasted so good that I ate a good bit of it with a spoon while my cake was baking! :D

I needed a quick frosting recipe for chocolate frosting using Cocoa Powder. I had to frost 72 cup cakes. I loved how this recipe came out. I did modify it a bit. I used 3/4 cup of melted salted butter and a 1/4 water in place of the margarine.( I didn't have margarine.) I also used homemade vanilla extract.Don't use imitation vanilla splurge and get the real thing. If you want a great frosting use quality ingredients. I think what makes a difference in this recipe is what kind of cocoa powder you use. I use the exact amount of what was called for in the recipe but used a premium cocoa powder. I used Ghirardelli Majestic cocoa powder (20/22% cocoa butter content). It was fantastic. I am not a lover of average chocolate...but this was way above average.

I made this just because I'd never made icing before and realized I had never seen my wife make icing on any of the many cakes she has made in our 33 years together.  I only made a half recipe since I had no intention of making a cake (yet). I estimated the milk (eye-balled it) using about two thirds of a quarter cup measure. I followed the recipe exactly except for splitting the recipe in half, but it seemed to be missing something. I melted a Baker's bittersweet chocolate cube in the microwave and mixed it into the frosting and it was phenomenal!

The recipe is too sweet as-is. I tried it with 2/3 cup cocoa and only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, but the result was still sweeter than I prefer. Also the '12' servings were not enough to fill and frost a 2-layer 8' cake. I would need to double the amount to have enough for filling and frosting. I am not sure if this due to the change in the amounts or not, but the final result also left a slight chocolate after-taste that lingers for a while.

I followed others' suggestions and used 2/3 c. cocoa and 3 c. powdered sugar.  I tripled the recipe for a layer cake.  Great rich, dark, color and creamy consistency, even hours afterward.

I decided to make this frosting for my chocolate cupcakes based on what I had available in my pantry and I ended up not using it. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm not sure what happened but it was not thick like frosting. It was more like the consistency of cake batter and the taste was bland. I will not make this again

This is a good fudgy frosting.  I used it on a white double layer cake and there was just enough frosting for the whole cake without having to make more to fill in places.  I used butter, I don't buy margarine, and I used 1/2 cup only because I glanced at the recipe without my glasses on and and that's what I thought I read.  I also upped the cocoa powder to 2/3 Cup because of what I had read.  Another thing that I changed was that I used heavy cream instead of milk.  I wanted to use up what I had and turns out it worked great!  I always sift my powdered sugar, and I also sifted my cocoa powder before I added them.  Takes any and all clumps out ahead of time so you don't have one pop up.  I will definitely save this recipe for further use.  There's always something else that needs chocolate frosting!

Tastes delicious and it actually looks chocolately,unlike the last two I've tried. Only problem is that it makes very little for a cake. I had to triple the recipe.

Just made this. I followed the recipe exactly and it seemed SO thick, not creamy like I was expecting. But I hadn't read any reviews yet like I probably should have. I tasted it and it was too sweet and not as chocolatey as I would have hoped. After then reading some reviews I added some salt and a little more milk. That made it creamy and balanced out the sweet level and now it is pretty good. I have a feeling there are better recipes out there however.

Why was mine gritty? I whipped & re-whipped. I added more milk. I let it sit out & rewhipped. I heated. Still gritty. What did I do wrong? The flavor was nice enough but the texture was crunchy. I used organic powdered 100% cane sugar. The kids I made it for ate it right up but it was a lot of work for it to be not great.

Really nice! I did what other people did and changed it to 3 cups of sugar and 2/3 cups of cocoa. Used dark chocolate almond milk in place of regular milk--to get a "creamier" feeling, I added the 1/3 cup, then later added an extra 1/4 cup, but it might be better to just use 1/2 cup next time, since now it's a little runny. But it's great, and I'll definitely use it again! Tastes great on top of brownies.

This turned out great! I added sugar half a cup by half a cup so I could see how creamy it would turn out. I am not sure how much sugar I ended up using... I think some where between 2.5 and 3 cups. I also used butter instead of margarine.

Oh my, I sure loved this one! However, it is necessary to keep adding Cocoa Powder until you reach the taste you desire! Quick and easy, for a more fluffy texture, I added two tablespoons of marshmallow cream and 2 tablespoons of hot fudge!!

I used butter and only put in enough powdered sugar to make it a frosting consistency. I also added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp cinnamon. Fantastic!
I would recommend heating the butter/milk/chocolate mixture, otherwise the milk will cause the butter to solidify.

This frosting is so darn easy to make, it's hard to imagine anyone wanting or needing to buy the store bought stuff. It even has a similar spreading consistency. I used it to frost a brownie cake. For some reason, first time I tested it with 1/2 a recipe I had to add 1 Tblsp of milk for proper spreading consistency. Second time, I made a full recipe and didn't have to add any extra liquid. It is very sweet, but what frosting isn't. Only change I made was using butter instead of margarine, just because I like the taste better. I would use this on a cupcake recipe in the future. Make sure to have beaters handy, a spoon will cause clumping. They are needed to make the frosting creamy. TY, for the recipe.

I had to tweak this recipe as I went.  First, I added a bit more than 1/2 cup cocoa powder.  Then I realized there was definitely not enough for my 2 layered 9in-round cake so I added another 1/4c of butter (instead of margarine, by the way).  And boy was I glad I slowly added the powdered sugar.  Even after increasing the butter and cocoa powder, I still only used maybe 1.75c of the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I did have to use a whole 1/3c milk (but that is with me doubling the butter).  2 stars for the base, but with my adjustments, 4 stars.  I will continue to look for other recipes that do not need so much tweaking!

Always dubious about suger quantities I made this with abut 20% of the suger listed and it was perfect.  My sugestion is that the suger quantity should be 20% of what is listed with guidance to add suger to taste if one likes sweater treats.

I replaced the melted margarine with melted coconut oil, doubled the cocoa powder and only used two cups of powdered sugar.  The resulting frosting was fantastic and much healthier. Great texture as well.

Decent, quick icing. I was restricted by stock of ingredients, this was the most feasible recipe. However, the flavor was a bit weird, most likely due to with what was used (toll house cocoa and an off brand of confectioners sugar). I tried twice, once with vanilla extract and once with almond extract. I really preferred the almond.

Couldn't eat this frosting on our cake! Ended up pretty chunky and grainy.  Also, it needs more cocoa powder for the taste.

This is my go to chocolate frosting recipe, I've been using it for over a year and it is just the right balance of chocolate and sweetness for me and my family.  I always double the recipe because one recipe isn't enough for my chocolate cake.

Horrible! The flavor was not even that chocolaty and the texture was horrible even after making it twice and adding a lot more powdered sugar.

Easy and fast to make. Delicious! My kids and their friends keep asking for more. The frosting goes well with pretty much everything. I use softened butter instead of melted and I add more cocoa powder and less sugar, making it more chocolately. When I have some left over, I whip up some brownies and frost them with it.
Best recipe for chocolate frosting, make it a lot.

if i had followed this to a "t" i would have ended up with chocolate crumbles.  i added more milk (and more cocoa as per other suggestions) and what i got was a rich creamy frosting that was way too sweet for my tastes. this rating is for the actual recipe.  if i used more milk and way less sugar from the beginning it probably would have been better for my tastes.

Works great vegan also- substituting almond- or soymilk- and easy to spice up with just about anything, cinnamon,cherry, etc.
Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Great Recipe-doubled awesome as well.  Topped my famouse Banana Choc Chip cake for a bunch of hungry youth and it was a hit!!  I used less icing sugar only cause i ran out-i prefer it this way.  Add an extra dash of vanilla extract or almond extract it helps play down the sweetness of the icing sugar.

This frosting is soooo good!  It is a thicker more fudge like frosting.  I did add more cocoa and less sugar like others suggested.  I also used some dark cocoa in place of the regular cocoa.  I used this on the Dark Chocolate Cake II recipe (on this sight).  It was a smash hit.  The only suggestion I would make is if you are making a layered round cake double the recipe.

Very good and very sweet!  I used real unsalted butter and added a tad more cocoa and a tad less sugar.  Next time I think I will increase the cocoa and decrease the sugar even more!  This frosting has that great homeade chocolate frosting taste (so much better than canned frosting)!  It was the perfect amount for 12 cupcakes (or half of a cake recipe).

I am not a fan of margarine. I like the more natural organic butter. So I substituted them. When I added the milk the butter went back to its more hard form. So I heated it very slightly on the stove until it was melted again and then added the sugar. It worked great...just in case you favor butter like me.

It tasted fantastic, but I had to double the recipe for a 2 layer 8 inch cake and it still wasn't quite enough. I didn't care for the consistency either.

This is really easy to make! I only used about 3 cups of confectionar's sugar. It was really easy to pipe. I used a little more margarine, probably about 2 more teaspoons. I found it took a while to smooth out when I mixed it with margarine and the cocoa, but as I gradually added the sugar, the clumps started to disappear. All in all, GREAT RECIPE, QUICK AND EASY!

DELICIOUS!  So very good.  I used this chocolate frosting to frost a chocolate cake that I found on this website as well.  The cake was fantastic, but the frosting really gave it the creamy, chocolatey texture and taste that I was looking for.  It's very easy to make and the end results are teriffic.  Definitely one of my favorite frosting recipes!

Great taste. I also reduced the amount of sugar and increased the amount of cocoa.  I didn't sift my dry ingredients beforehand though, so I ended up with bits of sugar/cocoa that wouldn't mix.

This is my first time making chocolate icing or frosting. It turned out very good. I added just a little more milk because it seemed a little thick. I really enjoyed this. Thanks.

PERFECT FROSTING  I changed it up a bit, using 2 cups cofect. sugar and 1 tbsp. butter add to the marg. I found by melting the marg and adding it  to the cocoa then  mixing it  on high with an electric mixer it gave it the perfect texture and using 2 cup of cofect. sugar makes it not as sweet but the chocolate taste really comes through. EXCELLENT RECIPE I WILL USE THIS ONE FROM NOW ON  THANKS

Delicious! I also modified it, as many users suggested. I used butter, although I hear that you could add more to make it 1/2 a cup, depending on your preferences. I used slightly more than 2/3 cup of cocoa and slightly less than 2 cups of confectioners sugar and it was just mildly sweet. I feel that 2.5 cups is too sweet. I also added a dash of cinnamon just for kicks. Someone also suggested adding a tablespoon of your favorite prepared coffee to give it a mocha taste. Loved the frosting!

I only used 3 cups of sugar. Nothing about this frosting stood out to me. My roommates and I agreed it was overpoweringly sweet and had a funny aftertaste. If I were to make it again I would add more milk. However, I do not plan on making this again.

I thought this frosting was very good. I was surprised at how easy it was to make and that it did, in fact, resemble store bought frosting. I followed it exactly, but used butter and 3 cups of confectioners sugar. I really think 2.5 cups would have been enough. It was fantastic on cupcakes! Thank you so much for posting!

This is a nearly perfect chocolate frosting. I did however, cut back the powdered sugar to around 3 cups, but this is great with a soft creamy texture and the right amount of "chocolateness"! :)

Super easy and great for the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III make in 9x13" pan, single layer.  Eyeball in a little extra cocoa.  1/2 the recipe is sufficient for a full cake coating.  Then the whole thing can just be mixed in a 1 cup measuring cup and wisk.  One bowl, one cup, and one pan for a complete frosted cake, not bad!

I agree to add more cocoa powder. I probably used 2/3 cup.  I also added a dash more vanilla extract.  It's good. I put it on Aunt Mary's Chocolate Cake.

This is my new go-to chocolate frosting recipe!  I'm only giving 4 stars because, like others, I used more cocoa powder and less powdered sugar.  It ended up perfectly smooth & creamy - I could have eaten a whole bowl without any cake!!

YES! De-lish! I put too much milk as others did but all you have to do is let is set in the refrigerator to thicken (you need at least 30 minutes to do so), or use as a glaze.  I frosted 22 cupcakes w/half of the recipe & microwaved the rest to use as a fudge sauce over brownies & raspberries the next day, tasted sublime :)!

This was a pretty good recipe although i found that i had to add almost another 1/4 cup of milk to get it to a spreadable consitency. Also followed other people's advice and used less sugar and more cocoa.

I substituted butter for the margarine and used only 2 1/2 cups sugar. The taste came out alright but the consistency was a little runny. Next time I'll cut back on the milk.

Loved this frosting!  Altho, to be honest, I did tweak it a bit.  3/4 cup on the cocoa & 3 cups of the powdered sugar - sheer perfection!  Got rave reviews on home-made walnut brownies.. will be a staple henceforth.  Thanks Tianne!

Loved this frosting! I made some yellow cupcakes and decided to use this frosting.  It was a great combo.  Some reviewers have said it was too sweet.  It is very rich and sweet so if you aren't a sweet frosting fan don't even bother using this recipe.

Really good frosting.  Went really well on yellow cupcakes.  Followed the advice from others: more cocoa powder (2/3 c or so) and less powdered sugar (2 1/2).  Will definetely make again!

Followed recipe exactly, icing was strong and WAY too think, so added more milk gradually until the consistency was a little more tolerable.

I didn't want to go to the market to get chocolate frosting so I used this recipe which used ingredients in my cupboard and directions easy to follow. This was the perfect consistency! I followed others' recommendations and used more cocoa and less sugar. will probably make this frosting over buying from now on.

This frosting is just fine, especially if you need something quick, but it's nothing special.  As other reviewers, I used butter and I used less sugar and a tad more cocoa.  I found the consistency a little gooey and bland in flavor, so I added about a tablespoon of cream cheese I happened to have on hand, and I think that helped both the taste and consistency.  One note: I tried and tried but could not get the butter/cocoa mixture to combine with the milk.  However, once I started adding the sugar, everything incorporated just fine.  Although gooey at first, this frosting does firm up a bit on the cake after awhile.

Oh my, this was yummy!  I cut this in half to frost Sandy's Chocolate Cake made in my bundt pan(from this site, also cut that recipe in half).  As others mentioned, I used butter, not margarine, scaled back the sugar and added more cocoa powder.  This was a wonderful consistency, went beautifully on my cake and really looked fantastic!  **SO GOOD**.  Will absolutely make this again!

This frosting is amazing!!! I followed the recipe exactly and only left out around 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar because I had the consistency I was looking for. All I can say is YUMMMMMY!!!!! I used this on the Peanut Butter Brownies on this site.

The ingredients are great for this recipe, but I gave it a 4 because I tweaked the amounts because of other users' reviews. I used 3 cups powdered sugar and added 2-3 tablespoons of butter to the 1/4 cup called for. This took care of the "too sweet" problem, and I didn't have to add extra cocoa powder. It also helped make the frosting creamier. :)

Hmm, I don't really know how to feel about this. I may change my review when my neighbours and parents give me some feedback. It was kinda hard to work with, and I definitely had to add more milk. I haven't spread it over my brownies yet but I am afraid it will ruin them / rip them apart because it's pretty think. I think I'll toss it in the microwave to make it smoother before putting it on the brownies. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

A very delicious, easy-to-spread frosting which creates its own smooth finish. I found that I needed about 1/2 cup extra sugar to get the consistency I desires.

I read other reviews and followed their advice to sift the cocoa and powdered sugar together before adding to the butter.  I needed less milk that listed and I used an extra 1/3 cup cocoa.  I also followed others advice and chilled the frosting overnight and then beat it again in the mixer and it had a very nice texture.  I used it on the Dark Chocolate Bacon Cupcakes on this site.

This was not the dark fudge frosting of my dreams.  It's too sweet and not chocolately enough as written.  Heeding advice, I added 2 TBSP dark coffee, and decreased powdered sugar. Still not happy, I ended up adding another round of butter and cocoa and then it could stand up to the Black Magic Cake on this site.  I will keep looking.

This turned out perfect for me, not too much chocolate taste but still sweet. I substituted butter for margerine. I used this recipe for a filling to go between cake layers, so I simply added one cup of frozen whipped topping to the recipe and it turned out in more of a mousse texture, which worked fantastic!

This got good reviews from my fans!  Was looking for something quick and easy to top a regular box cake mix, and this hit the spot perfectly!  I did use butter instead of margarine, and made sure to really mix the cocoa in.  Then I substituted Heavy Cream for the milk, using about 1/2-3/4 cup, making more of a whipped creamy frosting.  Worked fabulously!

I followed another reviewer right off the bat and went with 1/2 cup butter instead of the 1/4 cup margerine.  All else the same and came out perfect with not additional milk or confect sugar needed.  This is a very quick and easy recipe with great results.  Probably not my choice for a special occasion but great in a hurry or even cupcakes.  Sweet but not too sweet.  Spreads nicely.  Comes out light in color.  Everyone liked it.

Rating the recipe as written, I don't think it was very good.  The taste was what you would expect from chocolate frosting, but all I could taste was the vanilla, and the texture was awful.  I ended up scrapping it and using the Chocolate Buttercream frosting recipe on this site.  The ingredients were almost the same, but called for hot fudge sundae chocolate as well.  The main difference in preparation was that it called to sift the ingredients.  I may have had more luck with this if I had sifted, but as written the result was very grainy and not something I would recommend.

I slowly added sugar, tasting occasionally, and ended up with an extra cup of sugar.  Delicious dark chocolate frosting! It is a 5 star recipe with less sugar.  I frosted the Dark Chocolate Cake I on this site and it was delicious!

Very chocolatey and good consistency.  Made enough for me to frost a 2-layer of 9" rounds.  I also added a bit of salt, used butter, and did 3/4 cocoa, 2 cups powdered sugar.  Beat a lot of air (4-5 minutes) into it too, and it's perfect.

I think this frosting was pretty good.  I made it for some cupcakes I found on this site.  I thought it was just gonna be chocolate frosting but it had more of a dark chocolate taste to me.  I had to use 4 cups of powdered sugar just to get frosting consistency. I would use this recipe again, I would just lessen the cocoa.

Love this receipe it is delicious. I made it just like the receipe and put it on a yellow cake and it is very good. But I needed a little more milk. Didn't need to change a thing.

This is delicious frosting, and so easy!  It's not the best I've ever had, but for being so easy and still tasting good I'm giving it five stars.  I used it on the One Bowl Brownies.  When I need a quick chocolate frosting, this will be the one I go to!

Delicious!  I took another reviewer's advice and increased the cocoa by 1/3 cup and sifted it into the butter.  I also decreased the sugar to 2 cups total, which I thought was perfect because I like dark chocolate.  It turned out very smooth and chocolatey.

This frosting tasted very good. I made it with 3/4 of a cup of cocoa instead of the 1/3 cup. It was a bit grainy so make sure you sift the powdered sugar.

As with other reviewers, i found this recipe to be much too sweet, with not enough of a chocolate flavor. I am rating the recipe as it is written, not according to the changes suggested by other reviewers. Still, a solid, easy recipe for the future, with the other reviewers' suggestions. Thanks!

A WONDERFUL frosting!  
I used half and half for a richer taste.
Also, feel free to add more cocoa powder for a richer chocolate taste.
*Also, add some peanut butter to it and you have a delicious chocolate peanut butter frosting ~ just add a little more milk too ;)
So good, you can eat it plain!

Great frosting. I made it with the too much chocolate cake, and I poured it on top of the bundt cake. It made a perfect liquidy center of the bundt. I had added a little more milk to the recipe so I could pour it on top of my bundt cake. It was AWESOME! If you love chocolate, then try these two recipes together, and you will be in heaven. I was not a chocolate cake fan, and now I am in love.

I followed the advice of others and used less sugar.  I only needed about 2 cups with some added cocoa powder and it was perfect.  This frosting was fantastic, just not exactly as the recipe calls for.

Good recipe. I decreased the p. sugar by a half cup and increased the cocoa by 1/3 of a cup. I was pleased with the result. I also placed the wet incredients in the bowl and then added the dry ingredients. It mixed well and the result was a nice spreadable frosting.

I made this exactly as written and it was pretty good.  It tasted exactly like the frosting that you buy at the grocery store, which I suppose is good, but I was really looking for something better (maybe creamier?).

Despite using powered sugar it still felt granulated.  It was kind of runny and I followed the recipe exactly.  Will not use in the future.

This was simple and VERY tasty but it didn't stay on my cake like I expected.  I even added more confectioner sugar like the recipe suggested but it was still too thin and ended up being a mess all over the counter.  Still tasty though, lol.

Very nice and creamy...had to add alot of sugar cause the cocoa was too bitter for me. It turned out though really nice on top of the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake"...My boyfriend loved the two together even though he prefers fruit cakes. =)

like what others said,
add more cocoa powder and instead of adding all of the powdered sugar at once, just add half and add a little bit more at a time!

I made it with the amount of sugar that was called for and it was too sweet. Next time I'll cut it down by a cup like others have suggested. I also used butter that was softened, not melted, and added 2 tablespoons more to make it creamier. Besides being too sweet the texture was great-smooth and light. Thanks for the recipe.

This frosting was a life saver when I ran out of store bought stuff. And may I say that I will not be going back to store bought as my husband said this is the best frosting he has ever tasted. I did make an adjustment though that seemed to tame the sweetness and give it a better consistency. I added 4 heaping tablespoons of nutella. It was fabulous. The subtle hazelnut flavor and less sweet nutella chocolate make this frosting perfect. I could eat a whole bowl!

I used a 1/2 cup of butter and it worked out great for me. It is sweet but you can up the cocoa if you want it less so. I used evaporated milk so it would have a little longer shelf life. Thought it was great! Thanks for sharing!

I tried the original recipe first but it was too sweet for me and not that chocolatey. The 2nd time I made this I followed some suggestions and used 1/2c butter, added more cocoa and milk about 3/4c of each then cut down the sugar to 2c. It was great. My husband liked it as well considering he's not fond of sweets. Thanks for the recipe.

I had to alter this recipe a bit. I upped the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup, decreased the powdered sugar to 2.5 cups, and added about 4 times the milk. With the directed amount of milk, the frosting was incredibly thick and could not be spread at all. After adding the extra milk, it was much easier to work with. The taste is pretty good, although I don't have much to compare it with since I don't make chocolate frosting that often. I had more than enough to frost a double layer chocolate cake.

It's not bad, nice chocolate flavour but a little too sweet for my tastes.  I've made it for my son's birthday cake and I know he'll love it since he loves anything sweet and chocolate.  But I doubt I'll make this one again.

Take this from a person who doesn't like chocolate frosting, this frosting is delicious!!!!  I love this frosting and so did everyone who ate my chocolate cake.  The bakers at the party all wanted the recipe.  Follow the tips in the reviews. I found them all useful.

I thought this was ok.  I frosted the Too Much Chocolate Cake with it and it tasted great the first day, but by the next day it had turned pretty hard and dry.  I definitely wouldn't make it again.  Next time I'll either try another recipe or just use a pre-made frosting for a creamier result.

When made as directed, this was a bit too sugary-tasting for our preference.  Adjusted to add less sugar and more cocoa per previous reviews, plus a touch more margarine for richer flavor.  Adjusted taste was very yummy, but consistency was not thick enough like store-bought frosting.  Not sure what it's missing ... this would be an excellent drizzle-type frosting, it was fantastic when it soaked into the cake - but not quite 5 stars for what we were expecting.  Again, I think it's just a matter of personal preference.

This frosting was great and I got several compliments.  It was smooth and creamy and stayed that way for a couple of days (instead of getting dried out the way some frostings do).

If you want a smooth, glossy frosting microwave it for 30 seconds and spread while hot. Otherwise, I find it difficult to spread...

I resolved the problem about the "funny" texture,placed the melted butter (or margarine) and 1/4 cup chocolate powder in a sauce pan over low heat fire and stirred for 2-3 minute until I get I creamy-like mixture then pour the mixture into the mixing bowl with the rest of the ingredients as directed in this recipe. I highly recommend using an electric mixer to get the smooth consistency. I only used 3 cups confectioners' sugar.

This was excellent...so much better than the store!  I used ghiradelli chocolate and it was plenty chocolate-y enough although I added a little less sugar too.  Plenty to frost everything I needed for my double layer cake.

the original recipe was too sweet, too much confectioner's sugar.  like others, i suggest decreasing the sugar and adding more cocoa powder.  other than that, its an ok frosting.  very smooth and doesnt crack.  the taste is just off to me though.

Great chocolate frosting recipe. My fussy husband couldn't resist licking the bowl clean.  Like other reviewers - I didn't put in as much sugar as the recipe called for. I did think it was chocolaty enough, so I didn't add more cocoa like other people did, but I did put it on a chocolate cake so that may have helped.

Mmmmm... Reminds me of grade-school cafeteria frosting! (yes, that's a compliment!) I upped the cocoa a bit and added less sugar as recommended. Also beat with my mixer to eliminate lumps. Perfection!

delicious!! I followed recomendations to add more coaco and less sugar,  it seemed a little thick before I even started adding the sugar so I added about 1/4 cup extra milk.  the consistency was great for spreading and it set really good.

this is my first review...i loved this recipe. it's like you get a "do-over" if you think you didn't add enough sugar, milk, is it thick enough...etc. I don't think there is an easier recipe, if you add more cocoa (which i did...a lot more) the recipe is not wrecked, you can modify as you go and it is easy to frost a cake. thanks!

Rather too sweet (and not enough Chocolate) for my taste... even though I followed the other reviewers and reduced my sugar and increased my cocoa powder. I think I'll give this recipe a pass the next time I need Chocolate Frosting.

This was OK.  I find I still prefer the fantastic recipe on the back of the WoodStock Farms powdered sugar bag.  That is FABULOUS icing.  Everyone goes crazy over it!  Back to this recipe,it will do if you don't have something better.  The flavor is not bad but not super rich & chocolatey.  The texture is a little thick - hard to spread.  It tastes pretty good.  It will do the job.  I'm just spoiled by the other delicous recipe!

This frosting is great.  I made it twice this w/e - once on a yellow cake, and once on brownies.  Rave reviews.  I did use butter instead of margarine though, because I don't like margarine.  I also found that I needed less 10X sugar than stated but that's just personal preference since I prefer frosting a bit on the creamy side.  Definitely a keeper and very easy.

This was really easy to make and sooo good. I used Valrhona cocoa, so the frosting had a deep chocolate flavor. Like other reviewers, I cut back on the sugar. I also used a wee bit more vanilla. I'll make this again and again.

I found out we were going to a cookout and needed something to bring that was quick.  I had a small chocolate cake that I had made and frozen in the freezer.  I thawed it and whipped up this frosting.  It was perfect.  It tasted great and looked really smooth.  It saved the day!

Great one!! Easy to make and cheap (used margarine instead of butter).  I loved deep chocolate taste, so I reduced the sugar a bit, and upped the cocoa powder.  I paired them with One Bowl Chocolate cake III - oh yummy!

The frosting turned out great.. I added powder sugar to taste and not what the recipe called for. People were asking if the cake was Sarahlee brand... it was JUST that good.

I am a cake decorator, and at first I wasn't so sure if the consistancy would be creamy enough, but as I kept adding the 10x sugar, it became more creamy.  It was easy and fast to prepare, and very delicious!  I added 1/4 t salt so it wouldn't be too sweet and it worked fine!  YUMMY! 5 stars!

The only trouble I had was beating the butter and chocolate mix in with the cold milk and vanilla. I ended up just adding 3 cups of powdered sugar in before the other ingredients were mixed together. It turned out perfectly too! I agree with others when they say 3 cups is about the right amount to add, although you probably could go as low as 2 1/2. I frosted the "Dark Chocolate Cake I" from this site with this recipe. They went well together.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is sooo easy, and fast. I added a little more cocoa, just my preference, and used chocolate milk, because it needed to be used up. The end result was chocolately, and creamy, more than enough to thickly frost a 9x13 cake. I also did not measure my sugar, but I'm sure it wasn't the called for amount. Kids loved it.

I needed some chocolate frosting for one of my favorite desserts, the Chocolate Eclaire dessert submitted on this site by Kristie Behrens.  This frosting recipe was the perfect consistency and had a great flavor.  Cut in half, it was also the perfect amount!  I, like other reviewers, went easy on the sugar and taste tested as I went.  I used a bit less than what was called for and it came out great.  Easy and quick when I needed it in a pinch.

This is a very yummy and economical recipe.  I used this frosting with a boxed fudge marble cake and it made a very rich and tasty topping.  I do highly reccommend you heed the advice of others to go easy on the confectioners sugar.  I probably only used about 2 1/2 cups.  I didn't really measure I just went by taste and consistency.  I also used half and half instead of milk.  VERY yummy!

This was my first time making frosting for a cake. I'm pretty much a griller, not a dessert maker, but anyway this was super easy, a very light frosting, I was suprise at how easy it spreads.
It's not too sweet, even though I did'nt measure my sugar I just kept adding until I got the consistency I wanted and the amount, I first thought 1/2 cup of chocolate was to much as I tasted my frosting as I added the sugar, it tasted bitter to me, but I ajusted that with the sugar and milk. The end result was very very good. I was thinking as I spreaded this on my cake, well there will be no more can frosting for me. I can not wait to try other frosting recipes, Hey I just may become a dessert maker yet!!!!!. 5 stars.

I had already mixed the cocoa and butter together before I realized I was almost out of powdered sugar.  :(  I had less than one cup left, so I used it, with just two splashes of milk.  It wasn't sweet enough, so I added about 1 TBS of honey.  This sweetened it just enough without changing the consistency.  It was still too bitter to eat by itself (I'm a milk, not dark, cocolate lover) but it was perfect over Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies from this site.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I followed some previous reviewers' advice and didn't even bother measuring the powdered sugar.  I'm certain I didn't use a full 3.5 cups, although if I had been icing a layer cake, the consistency I was happy with might not have been firm enough.  I like a frosting that doesn't steal too much from the cake, and this is simple but good, just perfect.

Lovely!  Creamy, rich, easy to work with.  I'm not sure how much sugar I actually used, though.  I just kept pouring it out of the box until the consistency was right.  Will definitely make again!

get a big glass of milk.. this is great. i made a butter chocolate cake and toppped it with this. i did add about a 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee (about equal to 1/8 - 1/4 cup of coffee.) and it was definitly the finishing touch for me. i used decaff since i used so much cocoa (i ended up using about 2/3 cup rather than 1/2 cup)pretty yummy!

Very good! I will be using this recipe all the time from now on.
I baked 24 cupcakes and halved the recipe, I had plenty of frosting for the 24 cupcakes.
I can't wait to try it on chocolate cake too!

when i first tasted this just from the spoon i didn't think i was going to like it.  my partner said it tasted it too sugary and i thought it tasted very much like cocoa.  we put it on chocolate cupcakes and the frosting tasted pretty good with them, but definitly NOT my favorite icing recipe, not sure if i'll use it again.  i think i would prefer one made from chocolate chips instead of cocoa.

EASY to make and delicious!!  I used extra cocoa powder, but left everything else the same and the frosting came out fudge like.  I used it on a brownie topped cheesecake and it was superb!  Will never use frosting in a can again.

The best part of the chocolate cupcakes I frosted was definately the frosting.  It was just like I had smothered them in fudge. Very chocolately.  DELICIOUS!  Great texture and color.

Great! is all i have to say, easy fast and good! Did not make any changes other than using butter, I gradually added the sugar until I met my desired consistency. My college buddies will enjoy this cake ;) I know it. Thanks Tianne.

Great recipe!  I think I added about 4 extra teaspoons of milk before I got it to a consistency that I liked.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  This frosting has a great flavor.  The chocolate isn't too overpowering.

I was looking for something to satisfy a chocolate craving, and this just didn't do it for me.  Not enough chocolate flavor.  When I tried to add more coco powder, it didn't have the right consistancy.  I had to tweek the recipe too much for it to come out o.k.

When you're looking for a quick, good frosting with ingredients you have on hand, this is it.  It is easy to adjust the consistency simply by adjusting the powdered sugar as well as by adding more cocoa for more of a chocolate flavor.  If you want to kick it up a bit, add some flavored extract such as rum, almond, or orange.  Or mix in some cream cheese.

I use this frosting for the Dark Chocolate Cake recipe found on this site, and I couldn't have found a better combination.  I first made it when I was living in the UK, and I was using Cadbury's cocoa powder (a fabulous baking cocoa, far better than Hershey's I'd say), and it was so incredible.  It was hard for me to keep enough frosting to put on the cake itself--I kept sticking the spoon in for a 'taste test' every few minutes.  Certainly not for my mother, who is diabetic, but perfect for the rare sweet treat.  Thanks!
