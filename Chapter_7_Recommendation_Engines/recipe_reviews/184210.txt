My husband and I loved this!!  This was my first ever attempt at winter chili and I'll not look any further for another recipe.  To speed up the process, I used precooked chicken strips that you can find in the grocery store.  The rest was a breeze!  My picky 7 yr old thought it was just OK, my 11 yr old thought it tasted like Grandma made it - which is a HUGE compliment!  Thanks for putting this recipe in the Feb. American Agriculturist along with your web site.  I can not wait to try more!!

I took this to a church luncheon, and it was well liked.  Makes a large crock pot full.   Meal in one!  Karen
