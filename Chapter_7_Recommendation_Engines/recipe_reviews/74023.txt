I made this dish for my family and boyfriend last night and it got RAVE reviews. Coming from my dad especially that's saying a lot. I did make a few changes though. I sauteed the chicken with 3 cloves of garlic and paprika first until just brown and drained the fat. Then I mixed the ingredients for the sauce increasing the dill to 5 tsp and tripling the onion soup mix and poured the mixture right into the pan! Brought it to a boil reduced heat and let simmer for 30 minutes. Why turn on the oven if you don't have to? The stove offers more control over doneness. So tender and flavourful. Thanks for the recipe!

I am so glad I found this recipe. It's very similar to another dill chicken recipe I have but slightly lower in fat. The only thing I changed was I cooked everything in a crockpot instead for 7 hours and instead of using cream of mushroom I used low fat cream of chicken. It made a lot of gravy and I served it over mashed potatoes. Excellent!!!

This recipe is FABULOUS! The only change I made was to triple (at least) the dill which gave a fantastic flavor. I've made this recipe several times and I did find that (at least for me) the comment at the end "The longer you can cook it the better it will taste " did not work - the second time I left it in the oven about 10 minutes longer than it calls for and it turned out bland burnt and dry. I'd follow the directions to a T and you'll get a great easy chicken and some gravy for mashed potatoes too!

This is really good and easy to make. Next time I make this I will mix everything toghether and then pour over chicken. I think it would be better that way. Great recipe.

My family enjoyed this recipe thanks to the help of some reviews. I think the recipe as-is would not be that great. I used chicken tenders which worked out great because there was no grease from the chicken and it cooked much faster. I also mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and then poured it over the chicken which I seasoned w/ salt and pepper. I added about 3x more dill and I am soooo glad I did that but next time I'll add even more! The sauce was really runny and I wanted it to be more gravy-like so I ended up having to add some cornstarch to get the right consistency I wanted. I also added broccoli and corn to get some veggies in. Overall this dish has a good flavor and it's fast and easy which is always a thumbs up for me.

Taking a suggestion from another reviewer and being short on time I tried this in the crock pot. It came out a oily greasy bland mess. I might try making it again - this time following the recipe exactly!

I added garlic of course and increased the dill. Also served it on rice instead of mashed potatoes. Made glazed carrots as a side. We all liked it very much!

Recently tried this recipe I used three large boneless chicken breasts. My husband and I did NOT like this recipe - it basically tasted like boiled chicken with no taste.

This recipe is delicious. My boyfriend and I tried this instead of a traditional Thanksgiving meal and we were so happy we did! A jar of French Onion dip worked well as a substitute for sour cream and onion soup mix. I sauteed the chicken with ginger powder minced garlic and a splash of olive oil and to the sauce I added sage and cilantro to taste and a tiny pinch of cream of tartar to thicken it. I did as suggested and cooked the whole thing on the burner. It came out absolutely moist and delicious and we had enough gravy for two more meals (over potatoes fried and baked both taste great). Fantastic!

I hate giving this a four star but I did make changes and it was not exactly a I'd give my right arm to eat this kind of dish. As per other reviewers I added more dill to my taste (Love Dill!) and more onion soup mix. It probably could have done with less milk but my boyfriend liked it that it wasn't thicker. I added a tablespoon or two of cream cheese. I'm not sure what this does to it I've just seen it done with other recipes with cream of mushroom. I think it made it richer in taste but I am still learning. I did also brown the chicken. I added the rest to the chicken let it boil then simmered 30 min. Next time I may use cream of chicken instead just because my boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms. Overall I really enjoyed it as a weekday meal.

This came out gloppy for me. I won't be making this dish again. Glad that I added more dill as others suggested otherwise it would have been a super flop of a dish. I used boneless/skinless chicken vs. bone-in which I don't think would have changed the consistency too much. I made it based on most of the rave reviews and found it disappointing.

I added some mushrooms and thick onion slices but it was really runny and couldn't decide if it wanted to be a soup or a sauce. Not good enough to have again....I'll pass.

I like to brown the chicken in a little butter with some sliced onion and fresh minced garlic before layering it in the baking dish. I also increase the amount of onion soup mix to a full envelope. We like this over buttered egg noodles. It reminds me a little of swedish meatballs only with chicken.
