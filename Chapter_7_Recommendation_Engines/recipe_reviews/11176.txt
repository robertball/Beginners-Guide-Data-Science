This recipe is much improved by cooking in microwave.  Use 1/4 cup of hard margarine or butter and 1/4 cup peanut butter.  Combine butter, peanut butter and cocoa in microwave on high for 1 min 30 sec.  Add remaining ingredients stir and cook on high for another minute.  This will yeild a smoother, more solid fudge.

I followed the suggestions to microwave the ingredients and made only a small batch (being reasonably wary and only one person) and the result was a peanut butter flavored chocolate like fudge. it's similar to the Microwave fudge recipe by gayle (I think that's her name) on this site, not a terrible fudge at all. This was worth every star for ease and for the tinkering of others. will make again next time i need a fast fix.

Fast and delicious, what more can you ask for? I used around a pound of confectioners' sugar (I didn't measure but used around ½ a 2-pound bag), ½ cup peanut butter, 6 TBS cocoa, 6 TBS milk, and 1 TBS vanilla. I melted the PB, sugar, and cocoa together in the microwave for 90 seconds, mixed in the milk and vanilla, and cooked another 30 seconds. I then beat it with a wooden spoon for a minute. Instead of an 8x8" pan, I used a 3.5"x5" mini loaf pan. It was ready to eat after around 45 minutes in the freezer! Thanks for sharing, Barbara, and thanks for your helpful review, Marg Buchanan!

I love this recipe.  The powdered sugar is hardly noticeable in this recipe compared to others I have tried.  In another review someone mentioned microwaving it and I agree that it helps make it creamier.  The one difference I would do is leave the peanut butter at 1/2 cup if you want the stronger peanut butter taste and either omit the butter they suggest or add maybe 1/3 of a cup.  In the future I might add a  whole cup to increase the peanut butter flavor.

the taste is good, an equal mix of peanut butter to chocolate. but, i didn't have much luck with making this recipe. the fudge wouldn't harden after sitting in the fridge overnight. i mistakenly put in 2 cups of confectioner's sugar (1 pound = 4 cups), so i had to remix in the missing 2 cups! even after the addition, it still wouldn't harden. i ended up leaving it in the freezer overnight, which did the trick, but i have to keep it in there otherwise it gets very soft of gooey in the fridge. don't get me wrong, the taste is good, but i will try a different recipe before i come back to this one again.

I was looking for a recipe with the ingredients I had on hand for my "chocolate fix". I made it exactly as given but added walnut pieces at the end of mixing. I used a high speed KitchenAid mixer and mixed for about 4 min. Maybe wasn't necessary to mix so long, but I wanted it to be real creamy and it was. I folded in the walnuts with a wooden spoon. It set up nicely in the fridge after about 4 hours. This recipe is fantastic if you don't have everything on hand such as chocolate chips or marshmallows.  I will make it often for me and my family since it is so very easy, tastes terrific,  and satisfies my cravings.  Thanks for posting it!

i "fudged" this recipe with what i had on hand.  I used majority butter and only a smidge of peanut butter and used water instead of milk.  Not bad.

It is a lot easier to mix up if you melt the peanut butter.  It's also better if you can leave it in the fridge over night before serving and I would suggest storing whatever is left in the fridge.  Regardless of when you serve it, it tastes great.  I am addicted to this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I used a cheap dollar-store peanut butter which was on the runny side and also used about 1/8 cup butter, and used the microwave method most described here.  I had a hard time mixing mine in with the sugar and had to nuke'n'stir it a couple of more times before it was mixed well and malleable enough to spread into a pan.  End result: A bit too oily--wish I had used less peanut butter and less butter--but otherwise excellent!

Wow we were in a sweet fit, well times are poor right now for my family and we are budgeting. I couldnt go to the store and buy anything so i used what I had on hand. I prepared everything like said except I didnt have cocoa powder, so I used hot chocolate cocoa powder. I combined everything and folded/mixed it a little. Heated it for 90 secsin the microwave. I dont have an 8X8 pan so i lined my mini muffin cup pan with liners. I used a melon ball sccoper and scooped it into the liners. I evened them out also I topped with chopped pecans and melted caramel bits(melted with a tablespoon of butter & a little milk). I refridgerated until it was firm YUM!! Thanks for this you helped my family with our sweet tooth:)

I made this fudge exactly to the recipe, and quickly satisfied grandpa's need for chocolate/peanut butter. Wait for it to completely firm...no way...he dug right in when he found it in the fridge. Dusted what was left with powdered sugar. Yum!

For a no bake recipe this was fantastic.  Our Boyscout troop loved it.  Just a hint of peanut butter makes it a tasty, quick treat.  Knead the ingredients together for a smooth and well blended recipe.

This didn't turn out well. There was too much sugar and it didn't harden in the fridge. It looked more like thick melted chocolate. I ended up baking a cake and spread this on top and in between as icing. It turned out alright.

Not bad...considering it took only about 3 minutes to mix up. For quick fixes, this recipe is the one....but I still like the traditional fudge with marshmellow cream best!

I thought this recipe was OK.  It was difficult to mix everything until "smooth" because it was very thick, it never got hard, and it's too powdered sugary for me (I like a stronger peanut butter taste).  But, it was ok, and definitely was fast!

What an easy, excellent recipe! No more standing around watching the fudge boil to the soft ball stage, no more gritty fudge. This was perfect and smooth.

Although, the title of the recipe is misleading. I was searching for a peanut butter fudge recipe, and this one popped up. This is more of a chocolate fudge recipe with some peanut butter in it. Husband had his heart set on peanut butter fudge, but I sure enjoyed it. I'll make a whole lot more at Christmas for friends and family.

I followed the directions exactly, but it would not harden up enough for me so I tried storing in freezer and it's a little more like very soft fudge now but if you leave it out for long, it starts to melt again or soften up too much.  It's better for icing. I don't see how peanut butter would harden up this way.

Fudge just didn't solidify (even when microwaved). Didn't taste bad, but was just a mushy liquid.

not exactly sure what I did wrong but neither the stovetop method, or the microwave worked for me. I ended up having to knead the powdered sugar in so now I have a clump of chocolate/peanut butter "dough" to do something with. Will try putting the microwave at a lower temp next time

Although this recipe is extremely quick, it had a very hard time firming up. I had to stick it in the freezer, but as soon as I tkae it out it gets smushy again. The taste is a bit much for me. Way to much like confectioners sugar than peanut butter or chocolate. It was OK for a fast fudge.

This fudge is okay but I prefer my sisters recipe which takes longer but tastes more like fudge. This recipe, which I’ve tried 3 or 4 times, either doesn’t set up or sets up too hard and the texture is not what I’m used to. Probably won’t make this again.

Really fast and tasty! Double the peanut butter. If making a half recipe, use 1 & 3/4 cup powdered sugar, a whole recipe, use 3.5 cups powdered sugar.
