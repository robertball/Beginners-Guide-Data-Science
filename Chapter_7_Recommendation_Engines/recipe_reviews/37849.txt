This was the easiest pasta that I've ever made, all it takes is the time to cook the pasta.  Made it when I invited friends over last minute and everyone loved it.  Could use a little more salt, though.

I've made this many times (although I go half and half, salad dressing and sour cream) and they love it every time!  Quick, easy, and yummy!

I thought that this was going to be pretty good, based on the reviews and the 4 star rating, but I was wrong. I like miracle whip and basil, but this recipe was disappointing. The flavor was very dull despite all of the ingredients, and honestly it was too much effort for so little flavor. For better flavor with less effort, just toss some pesto, parm and salt on your pasta. I will stick with that from now on.

i loved the taste and how it combines meat, vegetables, and pasta all in one. the garlic powder was not very strong but added a nice taste. this is one of my favourite pasta dishes that i have made over and over again! don't be stunned by the miracle whip ingredient, it tastes wonderful with the spices.

This was really easy to make, and was pretty tasty too. My husband liked it, I gave it three stars cuz I'm not a big fan of miracle whip.
