Try substituting crushed canned onion rings for the corn flakes. I eliminated the onion powder and did this. I also reduced the cheddar chees by 1/2 cup. It was fabulous and everyone took the recipe home!

I used this for a New Year's Day Brunch and it went pretty quickly.  I liked that I could prepare it the night before and then pop it in the oven that morning.  I will use this again!

I love this recipe! It's so simple and you can make it the night before for brunch or breakfast.  After making it a few times I only made a few minor changes.  I used 16 slices of bread, deli sliced ham, and sliced cheese instead of shredded.  I used 8 eggs, 3 cups of milk, 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I increased the cornflakes to 5 cups (crushed well) and 1/2 cup of melted margarine.  I then layered in the following order bread, ham, cheese, ham, cheese, bread.  I found that if you layer the ham and cheese itâ€™s more evenly distributed.  I poured the egg mixture over, then cornflakes and baked at 350 for one hour.  Awesome!

I found this recipe on allrecipes in Dec.2001.  We've been making it for our Christmas breakfast every year since.  It's our absolute favorite!  I usually cut back on the milk by a 1/2 cup.  It's a delicious and favorite breakfast meal with our family. Thank you!

I made this for my family Christmas morning.  It was NOT a hit with my kids.  I made according to recipie and seemed to be too much bread, the amount of swiss cheese seemed strong.  Next time I may try with more egg and less bread.

Great dish! Instead of using breAd crumbs,however, I like to use hashbrowns. The frozen bag with the onions and peppers already in it is the way to go. All I do is brown them on the stove before Mixing them with the rest of the ingredients to bake. While they are browning, I like to spice them up with salt,pepper, ground mustard,onion powered and a touch of hot sauce. Add the hashbrowns to the dish first then pour your eggs on top. Then add whatever meat you'd like and top with cheese! Works out a little better than bread because it's not so soft..it's more of a hearty breakfast taste with more flavor!

This is a really good breakfast dish! Every bite was light and fluffy with the right combo of ham and cheese.  Next time, I might add some chopped red/green bell peppers (we love them in almost everything) just to see how it goes, and I will reduce the cornflake topping (personal preference...a little too much crunch for me).  Thanks Kelly, this is a keeper!

A great base, but I did make several alterations to bring it up to a five star for our family. Added more egg, used croutons instead of bread and added mushrooms.

This is our favorite breakfast casserole.  The others, with sausage, seem too greasy to me.  We halve the recipe and make it for Christmas morning.  To the egg mixture, I add Worcestershire sauce, Tobasco sauce and some mustard powder.  Instead of onion powder, I finely dice 1/4 cup onion and sprinkle it on with the ham and cheeses.  We love this!

I've made this twice and it was awesome both times, however, I (as Usual) did not follow the recipe exactly.  I used 1 lb of ground sausage the first time.  I also used all cheddar cheese and omitted the swiss.  The second time I used sliced "little smokies" and substituted shredded pepper jack for the swiss.  On one occassion I substituted the corn flakes for Special K.....always a hit!

This recipe was very good and easy to do.  I made it for a baby shower and it went over pretty well.  I used all Swiss cheese (I think...I can't remember).  After it was done, it had to set a little, so don't immediately try to eat it.

I forgot to add the cornflake topping, but I doubt that would have improved it.  It was very light and fluffy, which I actually didn't care for. It made it taste like it wasn't baked, which it absolutely was. My recipes that call for toasting the bread first come out more to my liking.

Exellent and so easy to make.  I made it for work.  Prepared it the night before, popped it in the oven and it was all gone by lunch time.  This is a keeper and I could see how great it would be for when you have a bunch of overnight guests.

Very good....I mixed white bread and rye bread cubes and used leftover honey ham from Christmas dinner (you know ham on Rye). I didn't really measure...just coverd bottom with bread cubes, layered with cheeses (probably more than called for). I did use the exact amount of eggs/milk. Didn't put the cornflakes on top since I didn't have on hand, but did top with some fresh minced jalapeno peppers. Everybody loved it.

Bread finished a little soggy and cheese runny.  I prefer the casserole with home fries rather than bread.  But easy and Looked good.

I prepared this for a basketball team breakfast and the boys loved it!  I used 8 eggs instead of 6 to give it a little more liquid and since I didn't have corn flake cereal, I used crushed buttery crackers mixed with the butter on top.  Delicious!

I thought this was pretty yummy! I made it for Chrismas Breakfast. I only made a couple of changes; I used frozen shredded potatoes instead of bread and I used French's Fried Onions instead of Cornflakes. Oh, and I also added a couple extra eggs and a layer of chopped sweet onion! It took about an hour and a half to cook all the way. I put it in before we started opening the gifts and it was finished when we were done opening. Next time, instead of just diced ham, I would use sliced ham and then dice it, just for a better texture. Overall though this was quite good and everyone loved it! It's also great with a little cholula sauce!

I have made this recipe several times but instead of onion powder have substituted dry mustard and it's delicious. This is also our Christmas morning breakfast along with fresh fruit salad.

This dish didn't cook very evenly for me. The outside pieces were much better than the ones in the middle, and held up a lot more like what is in the pictures. The flavor was okay, no one had seconds. I did feel the bread could be cut down significantly. My mother in law's favorite part was the top of it. I would have named this recipe breakfast stuffing.

I took this recipe to work and everyone loved it!  I altered the recipe slightly simply because of what I already had on hand.  I only used 14 slices of bread because that's all I had.  I used sliced deli ham instead of cubed and replaced the swiss cheese with an italian blend.  I'm making it again this weekend for my husband to enjoy!

I love this recipe for it's effortlessness.  If you can make a sandwich, you can make this.  May be a bit bland for some people.  It can definitely be spiced up a bit with the addition of tabasco sauce or cayenne.  You can also use sharper cheeses &/or lots more ham.  Also, I always use about a tsp of dried mustard.  Still, a great base recipe.

We call this "breakfast" casserole, mainly because the all the egg in it and the cereal topping along with the muffin like fluffy"ness" this casserole has. ITS SO DELICIOUS.. we did make a few alterations that improve the cooking time. 
ALTERATIONS:
Well one is we don't let it sit overnight we just let it soak in the fridge for a 1/2 hour.. and bake it just a tad bit longer so its not as runny.
Also a fun tip: dont mash ALL the cereal topping.. it makes for a better topping when you only mash half and leave the rest of the cereal whole! :) yum!

Made this Christmas morning and it was a terrible disappointment. My 4 children did not care for it at all. This recipe has way too much bread for my liking and was very bland. I will not make this again.

Great recipe!  I don't like corn flakes so I used the crushed fried onions as a topping and my friends loved it!

Flavour is great but it didn't cook all the way through.  I had to pop it back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes as it was runny and the cheese hadn't melted in the center.  I added spicy Italian sausage, 1-1/2 tsp of powdered mustard (to the egg mixture) and substituted a mozza/edam shredded blend for swiss cubes.  I also don't like the crunch of corn flakes so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead and it worked great!

I made this for my daughter's birthday brunch, and everyone liked it: no leftovers!  I substituted whole wheat bread for the white bread.  For the topping, I just crushed french fried onions ( maybe a little over 1 cup) & omitted the onion powder and butter.  I forget to grease my glass casserole dish, and it came out fine.  Don't skimp on the bread, or it'll be a bit soggy.

I didn't have time to let it soak over night, but it was fine. I added twice the amount of eggs and it was great. It doesn't reheat in the microwave very well. I liked it, but my dad wasn't fond of the soggy cornflakes when it was reheated

I have made this recipe for years putting in various fillings.  I prefer it with 6 more eggs.  This creates a firmer but not too firm quiche like casserole. Without the extra eggs, I found this version tasting more of the bread. I use very cheap bread which due to the air in the bread makes the caserole very light.  

I also have just pulled off the crusts and then made several layers of ingredients and egg mixture.  I think it mixes better and the top is neater. 

I put sides like bacon, salsa, tomato, avocado, ham, red pepper, etc on the table and everyone can make their own favorite.

I have made this dish several times over the past 7 years, but decided to comment on it now because of what I made it for.  I made this for a brunch where I am going to school, and they all wanted the recipe and commented on how good it is.  I like it because it is easy to make and tastes really great, although I use montery jack and colby cheese with the cheddar cheese.  Turns out really great, and I usually buy a ham steak for the meat.  I will continue to use this recipe for years.

Made this for a brunch, and I was just not impressed, sorry to say.  Our guests liked it ok, but I could tell it wasn't knocking their socks off.  I liked the ease of assembly the night before, but I found it took much longer to cook than the recipe stated to get the doughy quality out of the middle.  Which then made the top really crunchy.  The swiss flavor was nice, but it just seemed to be lacking to me, even in texture.  Possibly the addition of some onion, mushrooms, more spices? I might try again with some changes.  Thanks!

I gave this recip 5 stars after some tweaking.  I used only 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese.  I put 1 cup of it into the mix, and omited the cornflakes and added the other 1/2 cup on top of the finished casserole just prior to baking.  I also reduced the swiss cheese to 1 cup. I made the casserole with 10 eggs.  I also added 1/2 a cup of broccoli florets, 1/2 a cup of diced onions instead of onion powder, and a little bit of leftover green and red peppers.  I used potato bread instead of white and tore it up into small chunks and placed in the bottom of the pan.  I made this over Christmas when we had several relatives spending the night. I was hoping for leftovers but it was all gobbled up and people took home the recipe!

I just made this for a family gathering and it was a hit.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of ham, used 8 eggs and only 3 cps. milk and used a parmesan italian french bread loaf cut up as the bread and it was awesome.  The cornflake topping is the best, just less butter in it!!

The flavor of this casserole was very good although way too much bread. I even put four more eggs than recipe called for as others did and middle of casserole came out very soupy. I cooked casserole 15 minutes longer than recipe said and middle was still way to runny.

This was very easy, and most everyone liked it. 
Next time I would use less bread; the center just seemed a ittle too soggy, like it couldn't cook long enough without burning the top. I would cut the cheese down just a bit as well.

I thought it was ok but I'm not a big fan of swiss cheese. However, I took it to a church breakfast and everyone loved it! One friend now asks me to make my "souffle" every year. So, by going by those responses I'd say it's a hit and very easy to make.

We liked this very much. I added some garlic powder, freshy ground pepper, a little greek seasoning, worchestershire sauce and a dash of hot sauce. This punched it up for my personal taste but have made it just as the recipe says and even thought it would be too bland for me, it s was very good. I use the corn flakes and really like the crunch it gives. 
Next time I make it I might add chopped onions and diced hot peppers (I like spicy things)but truly, the recipe is good even without tweaking.

I made this recipe for a family brunch. It got rave reviews from all! I did change the recipe a little. I used 8 slices of toasted bread cubed, 2 and 3/4c of milk, and 5 eggs. I baked it for 1 and 1/2 hours at 350.

So good!  I just made this for my boyfriend, and we both loved it.  I prepared it and then cooked it right away, instead of letting it chill overnight, and it was still wonderful.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of onion powder, because that's what I had on hand.  Wonderful breakfast casserole....so cheesy and zesty!

This brunch casserole was popular at a recent pot-luck event. The only ingredient I added was some dry mustard, it blends nicely with the swiss cheese. You can use this as a good basic recipe and change the meat, cheese, or topping. 
I'll be making this often...thanks, Kelly.

Easy, and tasty!  I didn't have everything on hand that the recipe called for, so I substituted with all Colby/Monterey Jack cheese and sausage.  It worked quite well.  I think it was even better the day after it had been baked!  The cornflake crust was the best part!  I will definitely make it again, but I'll add a little salt to the egg and milk mixture.

I made this Christmas morning, and my inlaws were super impressed with my culinary skill!  I took a pass on the cornflake crust (I figured there were enough carbs to go around!) but it tasted just great without it!  It will definitely be an annual tradition at my house.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Waaaay too many cornflakes, and the center was cooked, but not hot.

Made this recipe for Christmas brunch.  I thought it was delicious!  Unfortunately, the guests were split about 50/50 on whether they liked it as much as I did - some did not like the mushy texture of the bread.  I will definitely make again, but for those that are less texture picky!

This dish was fast and good! However, there are some changes I made. I didn't use 18 pieces of bread. I only used about 12. I had sliced swiss so I just cut in little squares. Also-- after the first layer of bread I didnt put the rest on top. I didn't have room! It still turned out wonderful. I promise this is dish is great.

My family (adults) all found this casserole too rich.  They put a slice on their plate Xmas morning and did not finish it.   I was so embarrassed because I told everyone how good it was. The added cornflakes also make it not a positive experience at all for my family.

this was surprisingly good. i was nervous the bread would come out really soggy but it didn't. the recipe doesn't specify what bread to use so i cut up some dense french bread from costco and it was wonderful! i like to add more spices than called for and i forgot to. it was a little bland with just the suggested ingredients. still very yummy!

My mom has been making this receipe for years, just without the swiss cheese and with real onion instead of the powder. it is by far my favourite breakfast casserole EVER! I can't attest for how good it tastes with the swiss and onion powder, but i can bet using real onion is better :) if you haven't tried this dish you should DEFINITELY give it a go! I usually make it and let it sit overnight then bake it the morning of the brunch or breasfast. Yum!

I thought this was easy and great for a hungry crowd.  Although the kids were not crazy about it, the adults loved it.  I would make this again, but maybe put less bread in.  Seemed a little undercooked so I reheated it and it was fine.  Great breakfast for a brunch!

Didn't have a lot of flavor besides cheese, should have added more spices. Took over a hour to cook then it was too done.

This recipe was very good! My husband said with his first bite while his mouth was full: "...this is really good!" and went back for seconds.  We both did.  I made the recipe for 4 but added one more egg with a little milk and onion powder.  Otherwise the bread chunks were somewhat dry.  This recipe is a keeper!

I also subbed out the corn flakes and onion powder for the fried onions- everyone liked it alot- the bread really did soak up the egg- and it all cooked up fluffy- I was nervous taking it out of the oven, it looked like the middle was not done, but it was- everyone loved it- I did add a bit of dried mustard to the recipe. came out awesome- everyone has asked for it again

Very easy to make, and a huge hit on Easter morning.  I added about 1/2 the required amount of swiss (we didn't have enough on hand), and it was still delicious.  It is probably even better with the appropriate amount of swiss.  Highly recommend.

Very good recipie.  Easy to make and can be prepared in advance.  Got rave reviews at two different brunches.  I baked it in a larger pan (10 x 15) and added 2 eggs and a bit more milk and corn flakes bc the topping was too buttery for my taste. Also added sauteed diced onions for flavor.  Wonderful company breakfast meal.

This was pretty good. I made it the day before New Year's and my hangover thanks you so much! Everyone enjoyed it but I thought something was missing. I think I'll try some chopped onions and season the bread cubes next time. I absolutely love the cornflake topping, never used them for anything but cereal! Reminds me of the store-bought vegetable lasagne topping I love so much. This is a 5 star recipe for an easy no-fuss breakfast but I can only give 4 since it really needs a little oompf to make it great. Either way, I looked pretty cool dishing this out while everyone else could barely get off the couch! Thanks so much!

I made this for a work breakfast.  I didn't have ham so I used maple bacon and I used potatoe bread.  This recipe is delicious I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. Making it again tonight for family. thanks

I love this recipe.  It has the right balance of flavors that makes it a hit.  I make it on Christmas Eve and serve it Christmas morning and my entire family went wild over it.  I did change it just a bit.  I omited the onion powder and used 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard instead.  If you like onion with your eggs I would definitely use it as well.  The taste of the dijon mustard with the eggs and milk (custard) really adds an extra zest.  Thanks for a wonderful breakfast casserole that always leaves an empty dish!

I really enjoy making this for weekend visitors. It's easy to fix it up the night before & then cook in the morning as everyone is getting started for the day. I typically serve it with fruit. It's very tasty and leftovers heat up well.

Served this recipe for a church breakfast for 65 people and had nothing but RAVE reviews and everyone asked for the recipe which is a sure sign it's great! I personally loved it too! As a cook I seldom do the recipe exactly as written and in this recipe I added additional ham since 8 oz's didn't appear to be enough.

Recipe is "just okay". A little bland for me and the soft texture is a little off-putting. I wouldn't make it again but give it three stars for its ease of assembly and convenience in the morning.

I made this for Christmas morning brunch. It was a hit with all. I did alter the recipe a bit. After reading the one star reviews, I backed off on the bread. I used 10 slices rather than 18 as it called for. I added a few strips of bacon cut up. Also used 8 eggs rather than 6. I had to sub motzerella cheese for the Swiss. I think next time I will go with 9 slices of bread. That should be plenty. Still, it turned out great and everyone loved it.

We liked this pretty well. I didn't have cornflakes, so subed w/French onions...good flavor. For our taste, a little less bread, more egg and not so much butter. I definitely liked making it the night before! Will make again.

I made this 3 days ago for Easter brunch.  I'm a strict vegetarian so I can't speak for how this dish tasted, but it got a very good response from the carnivores in the crowd. I made it for about 15 people total.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I baked it in two separate 8 x 8 pans instead of 1 13 x 9, because I was serving it at two different functions.  I didn't change the oven temp or cooking time and the casseroles came out beautiful! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Usually I make omelets on Christmas morning, but we were pressed for time this year.  This casserole was so easy and delicious that it may be the new tradition.  The mix of cheddar and swiss cheeses gave excellent flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but some of us liked some Tabasco on top.  Next time I may add some to the egg mixture.  Buttery crunch of the corn flake crumbs was great, too.  Definitely a keeper.  I may half the recipe to make just for my husband & I for a quick brunch or dinner.

I think there was maybe too much bread, and it was a little eggy for me, but I think both of those are just personal preferences...I'll definitely be making this again, thank you!

Put this together last night for breakfast this morning. I halved it since there are only two of us tho I did add an extra egg (totaling 4). I made it as is except I toasted the bread cubes (I had white burger buns & they worked fine!) & added chopped chives since I got my recipes mixed up & bought them mistakenly, so I added them. We werenâ€™t crazy about the topping due to the bit of sweetness, I would use regular breadcrumbs or maybe try someoneâ€™s suggestion of French fried onions instead. Cheese & ham mix was very tasty. I will make this again & may experiment with sautÃ©ed onions and peppers in the mix.

Has become a favorite, but I made a few changes.  Substituted bread with 1 1/2 pkg. frozen o'brien potatoes, used 8 eggs instead of 6,  and instead of 3 1/2 c. of milk, I used 3 c. milk & 1/2 cup of half n half. Also added 1/2 cup diced green onions, plus added another 1/2 c. of ham.  Baked for about 50-55 minutes. Has been requested by family & friends for various brunches & holiday functions. Have given recipe to at least 12 people in last 3 years!  Usually only a small amount is left after a meal.

I made this and the Overnight Blueberry French Toast for a brunch, and although everybody raved about both, there wasn't any of this one left!  I added some frozen O'Brien Potatoes with peppers and onions in with the ham and cheeses.  Definately will be making this one again!

I added garlic powder as someone suggested, the seasoning was right.  Will add more ham, less bread next time I make it.  Good use of leftover easter ham!

I like this type of dish for weekends/holidays when we have guests because it saves me from being a "short order cook" every morning.  I used a bit less milk and butter, and found it needed a bit more cooking, but overall it was well received and we had some leftovers which were very good reheated.

I added an extra egg and would use approximately 10-12 ounces of bread. A little to much bread for me no per my family.  Good flavor.

This is a good recipe. I use leftover ham from a ham I cooked in the crockpot. I changed one thing. Rather than using bread I used a bag of hash browns, the kind that is in the refrigerated section of the market. Other than that I made no changes and it tasted great. I like to cut this up and freeze it in single serving sizes, thaw it out in the fridge the night before and then pop into the microwave to heat the next morning. Makes a quick and filling breakfast and cheaper than fast food. A little salsa served alongside is a great addition.

I made it for Christmas the last two years. I added two more eggs, onions and green peppers and a touch of pepper. It was a huge hit! I'm actually looking at it again because my wife wants me to make it for a women's church event!

As a FACS teacher, I have used this with students for a number of years. It has always been a great hit, numerous requests for recipe.   I've used various cereals (what was left in pantry at end of school year. (Corn flakes, a Rice Krispies, Chex, etc). I've substituted whole wheat for half of bread. Changed cheeses - not all kids are big on Swiss.  (Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, etc)
Tried rye for 1/4 of bread...  Too strong, maybe 2-3 slices.

Loved it. First christmas with no leftover egg bake.  I made a few small changes...i used rolls as i had no bread, i added some fontina cheese and i used ritz crackers instead of cornflakes...although i think the ornflakes would be yummy...i didnt want to buy them for 1 dish.  Will make again and again.

I was so lazy with this recipe!  I was running out of time before the company was coming, so I just laid the bread in the bottom in slices, laid deli ham over it, I only had 1 cup of shredded cheddar available, and laid the bread over top. I used only 3 cups of milk.  Despite my laziness this casserole turned out better than last year's version of a similar recipe.  I only let it sit for 30 min before baking but it was perfect.  I'll definitely use this recipe next year.

Score... I've been looking for this recipe! My mom used to make it every Christmas morning. She used potato chips instead of corn flakes, and added fresh diced onions, mushrooms, and green peppers, but other than that, this is it.

This recipe was very tasty.  The only changes I made were to add 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce to the eggs and milk, and also used deep fried onions as suggested by others.  Can't wait to make it again.

Fabulous!!!
The only changes I made were I used 1/2 medium onion and added some green pepper (about 1/8 cup).
I did notice I was suppose to let it sit overnight until I went to make it, but I still wanted to make it to I skipped this step and it still turned out great.

The crunchy topping was a nice addition to a fabulous recipe.  Everyone in my family rated it being a 8-10 out of 10 points.  My husband said the leftovers will be good for lunches, I agree.  
I highly recommend this easy delicious recipe.  Only comment if you are looking for a recipe with more egg substance, this is not the one.  This is more like a strata.
