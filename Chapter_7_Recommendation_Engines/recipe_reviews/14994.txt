Fairly easy to make, unique pie but wonderful flavor & rave reviews from everyone. Hint: dont let the pie cool too much before you flip it as becomes impossible to remove from the pan. If this happens, put it back in the oven just long enough to soften the sugars back up and flip it quickly!

I tried this recipe because we were tired of plain old apple pie. It is so good. This has become a family tradition for the holidays! I don't know who came up with this recipe, but THANK YOU!

top (or bottom), the flipped side, didn't cook for me. Just a doughy mess. Not too flavorful.

Awesome concept and a scrumptious, gooey addition to an apple pie that took it over the top! Made this pie last night by happenstance. I had a ruined pie crust/dough and needed to disguise it and voila! A delicious find. This pie was enjoyed by everyone who tried it this morning. A girl who loves apple pie and who I actually made it for said,"This is the best apple pie! Ever!" I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I used another recipe for the pie crusts; pre-cooked the thinly sliced(1/8") Granny Smith apples and the ingredients for 15 mins over med/low heat and then cooled. Tasted it for its sweetness and sprinkled another 1/4c. brown sugar. I generally drain the filling, so it's not runny/slimey, which I find so prevalent in many pies. It's a process, but I will make it again for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing cmsassman!

This recipe turned out great.  The apple mixture wasn't overly sweet, so it went really well with the candied pecans.  If you aren't worried about presentation, you can use crumbled pecans (like I did because I had to shell them) and it tastes just as yummy!

This is a great alternative to traditional apple pies!  My family loved it and said it was a keeper!!!  I've made it a few times and found real butter spreads more easily in the bottom of the pie plate than margarine.

I made this delicious pie, it is a keeper! I used my own pie crust though.....we had a friend over to enjoy with us. It is beautiful to look at and to eat! A mixture between a apple and pecan pie. Thanks so much.

This was fantastic.  I made it for my husband's family and they loved it.  It was gobbled up fast and given many compliments.  I will definitely make this again.

I have been making this recipe for many years, and always get great reviews. I think I pulled it from a Pillsbury cook book that I borrowed from a friend. I had lost my hand-written copy of the recipe, so am very glad to find this again here.

I love this pie. I have been making it for years and I'm not allowed to attend the Christmas family get together without it. The easiest way to remove the pie from the pie plate is to line the pan with parchment paper and then spray the paper before putting in the pecans and brown sugar. I let the pie sit for 5-10 min. then flip it out on the serving platter and the parchment paper peels right off.

I have made this several times as written.  When it gets to the holiday season, people start asking when I will make it.  It's quite impressive when presented.  I have a tray with curved edges which is just the right size for this pie.  Keeps the caramel from running all over the place.

Taste so good! I added a handfull of broken walnut pieces to fill in around the pecans. My wife says it's a keeper. She keeps snitching a forkfull before dinner!

Made this for my hubby's bday since apple pie is his favorite! He loved it and couldn't get enough! I'd like it better with the addition of 1-2 cups of fresh/frozen cranberries. My husbands only complaints were he had to share with others and he gained weight.

I have made this countless times. I got the recipe off the back of a Pillsbury box years ago. The only thing changed is spreading the butter in the pie pan then the pecans then sprinkling brown sugar over them. The recipe I use you melt the butter, stir in the brown sugar then spread that in bottom of the pie pan, then layer the pecans in top of that. Great recipe everyone at work asks for every time I bring it in.

This recipe is the best ever. I love to cook, but I rarely bake. A friend shamed me into making an apple pie rather than buying one pre-made for a dinner party we were attending. I found this recipe and am now grateful I was shamed! I did use prepared crusts. Followed directions as written and it was remarkably easy and everyone raved. Now making it for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

This was very good and fairly easy to make.  My pie broke apart just a little when I flipped it, but the flavor was great and a nice change.  Very well received at the Thanksgiving table.  Thanks for sharing this, louc4!

I tried this recipe this week, it was fabulous.  I made it as written except I needed more pecans to coat the bottom of the pan - so probably 3/4 of a cup. I was really skeptical about getting it out of the pan in one neat looking piece. I read other reviews which stressed the importance of getting it out of the pan in no more than five minutes after taking it out of the oven - so I set the timer and removed it successfully after 5 minutes.  The center sank a bit but it was great.  Guests loved it.
