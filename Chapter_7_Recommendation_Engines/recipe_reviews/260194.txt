I guess I’m just not a fan of red curry. I found the fish sauce to be completely overpowering and off-putting, even the  in the finished dish. I will say that all of the components were cooked well and had a good texture, which I’ve found to be a problem with a lot of instant pot recipes. If you don’t mind the fish sauce flavor, definitely give this a shot!

This was so awesome.  Made it as my first Instant Pot meal.  We love Thai, Indian curry food.  This is mild but very flavorful.  I made it exactly as written in the recipe.  I don’t change the recipe first time I make it, regardless of the reviewer comments.  After I ate some, which was amazing, I did squeeze some fresh lime on top.  I enjoy lime with pad Thai and similar dishes, and it goes very well with this too.  My only big suggestion is to wait to eat it.  Let it cool down for an hour to let the flavors blend.  It was too hot when we tried eating it, so we waited and ate later than usual.  Next time I’ll make it earlier in the day.  And the recipe makes plenty for 4 people with lots of leftover.  Could easily feed 6.  

 I’m grain and dairy free, meals like this make think I’m not missing anything without them!

This made a wonderful dinner and the textures were fantastic. I will add more veggies next time but other than that, this was a perfect recipe.

Fantastic, flavourful, awesome!  I really didn’t change much at all. Added about 1 tsp of kosher salt, and a frozen chunk of spinach. Followed the recipe to a T otherwise. Also, I recommend serving over rice. Strangely, all I had was Uncle Bens garlic parmesan and the combo was perfect.

Delicious. I used boneless chicken thighs and diced tomatoes as substitutes as I had them in the house. I definitely will make this dish again.

First time I’ve ever had, much less, made a curry dish, but this is delightful! I would add some ground red pepper next time to spice it up a little more. I didn’t use fish sauce, just a mixture of soy sauce, Worcestershire, and rice wine vinegar.

This is a great recipe! I used Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, which I found at an Asian market. I will be making it again for sure.

Did I do something wrong ?  This is weak.  I thought the curry paste would make it too hot for my family but this has all the flavor of Big Brother slop.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  The Instant Pot worked perfect using this recipe.  We will definitely make it again.
