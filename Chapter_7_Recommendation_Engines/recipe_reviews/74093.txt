I couldn't find the adobo seasoning in the store so I used a recipe I found on the internet to make the adobo.  I rubbed in the spices and let the roast sit in the frig for 2 days.  I increased the bacon slices and green onions to 12 each.  I laid 6 slices of bacon out, put 6 green onions perpendicular to the bacon slices, laid the pork roast on top of the onions, put 6 more green onions on the roast going the same direction as the bottom ones, covered it with 6 bacon slices, and tied it up.  I cooked it in a covered pan on the grill and uncovered it the last 15 minutes to brown the roast and bacon.  It is a beautiful presentation and the taste is superb.  Great recipe.

This was the best pork roast ever!
Omited celery salt and green onions, because I was out.  Made adobo out of
4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. dried oregano, 1 tsp. black peppercorns, 1/2 tsp. paprika, and 1 tsp. salt. put in small processor until a paste was formed.  Very good pared with mashed potatoes, green salad and Clos du Bois Shiraz.

Really good.  I made an 8lb bone-i roast, and doubled the quantities here.  Don't have a grill, so put it in the oven (covered with foil) at 350F for about 2.5 hours (til the internal temp was 160ish).  Came out moist, tender and really tasty.

Made this for an 8 lb boston butt pork roast (doubled the quantities), and just laid regular onion slices and bacon over the top (didn't butterfly/tie up).  Cooked it in a pyrex casserole dish in the oven for 2 hours at 400, covered with foil for the first 1 1/2 hours. It was AMAZING, and all my guests raved about it. I'm definitely doing this again.

This is a great recipe, thank you for sharing! I use the rub part of it on any kind of meat, not just pork roast - steaks, lamb chops, etc. Rub the spice mix on the meat, marinate for a few hours and grill. Delicious!

This was very good.  I just expected a little more out of it.  The spices seemed as if they would really compliment the pork but when I pulled it out of the oven, all of the spice flavor was in the juice in the pan.  It did not stay on the meat.  Although my picture does not show it I did butterfly the meat, although I used regular white onion istead of green onion because that is what I had.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Absolutely perfect! This is my go to rub for pork, chicken breasts, and even venison. Can't go wrong with this mix.

It was good although as most, I did mine slightly different. I direct grilled it at first with a little apple wood just enough to brown it and give it the grilled flavor. Then I put it in a foil container and covered it with foil onto indirect heat to finish. Juicy and tender.
