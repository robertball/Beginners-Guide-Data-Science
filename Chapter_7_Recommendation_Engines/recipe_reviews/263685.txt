It's amazingly light and fluffy! I found this recipe and served this to a couple friends a few months ago... who still talk about it to this day! 

It's highly recommended~

My gluten-free guest liked it.  (I put sugared strawberries and whipped cream on top)  I think if I made it again, I would find a smaller springform pan.  It was only about an inch thick.
