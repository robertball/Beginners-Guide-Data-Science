Chili-ghetti Haiku: "Pretty tasty meal! But I made mine casserole, and put in oven." I prepared this ahead of time and put it in the oven at 350 covered for 20 min., uncovered for 10 to get the cheese nice and brown. I like the ease of having a casserole-type noodle dish like this made earlier in the day (if not the day b4), making dinnertime alot easier on me - oven on, Ding, sit down to eat. My parents like to eat chili scooped atop spaghetti noodles and this reminded me of that, only everything was all incorporated. Tasty ~ we'd eat it again!
