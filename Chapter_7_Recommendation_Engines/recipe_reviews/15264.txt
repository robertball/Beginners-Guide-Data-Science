This recipe is wonderful!
I used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. smart beat instead of 1/2 c. shortenning. And I did not roll the dough I just made it into balls and flattened them with my hands. I used ground ginger instead of ginger roots.
It came out VERY delicious crunchy at the bottom but soft inside.
Thank you very much for this recipe. I will use it with different spices and flavors in the future.

These are a perfect way of getting ginger-root into my 3 yr. old. (Ginger-root keeps her from getting carsick.) We cut these with little heart-shaped cutters and dipped the topsides in sugar before baking. (Lots of fun for my little helper!) I had to hide some because everyone else in the house was eating them! Oh, these freeze nicely and thaw quickly.

A very nice, simple cookie that my husband actually ate and asked me to cook again - the only other type he likes are Anzac biscuits which are also crunchy. I want more crisp crunchie cookie recipes!!! The dough was a nice consistency and handled very well. I will add a bit more ginger next time.

yum!  I substituted butter instead of shortening because I was out.  I think next time I'll chop the ginger even finer so that it incorporates better.  I dusted them with some granulated sugar right before popping them in the oven to give them a little bit of sweetness.  I'll definitely make these again... Maybe with a little crushed up peppermint candy in the batter to give it a holiday flair.

Not ideal for use with cookie cutters.  The cookies turned out to be good with tea , but bland on their own.

Very tasty, good consistency, something a little different.  I used sushi ginger - minced it finely by rolling a pizza cutter over it.  This worked fine, but it would probably taste better with fresh ginger.  These cookies are a good consistency for shipping.

Followed recipe exactly. These were very dry and crumbly. The taste is ok. I am going to add allrecipes /sugar-cookie-frosting icing to them to jazz them up a bit.
