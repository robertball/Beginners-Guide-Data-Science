This came out really good. I've made it before, but it was better because I heated the dish before throwing the chicken in this time, and eliminated the soggy bottom issue.
For only 2 chicken breasts, I still used 1/2 cup mayo, mixed with granulated garlic, onion, seasoned pepper and celery salt. Coated the chicken with all of it, then the cornflakes. Sprinkled with dill and lemon zest. Yummy dish, and I'd make it again... this way. Thank you.

My Grandmother made this for years!  I can't believe I stumbled on this (thanks to recipe seach and and empty pantry close to grocery night).  I cut my chicken into strips (chicken tenders) and add a little onion powder to the seasoning mix. I spray the bottom of the baking dish with a little Pam so nothing sticks and bake them at 350 for 30 - 35 minutes turning once during baking. These come out so tender and moist with a light crispy coating even using lite mayo.

I hate mayo! And this recipe was awesome!!!!! So juicy.  I didn't have cornflakes, so I used bread crumbs, but I bet cornflakes would be good, too. I followed the recipe exactly except for the bread crumbs, and next time I will not change a thing. Yum!

Very moist and forgiving. If you make a mistake, it's still very good. I add about 50% more lemon, use "honey" type corn flakes, and garnish with lemon zest after baking.

WOW!  I received many compliments from my husband when I cooked this for dinner. I love to find a chicken recipe that my husband loves. I didn't measure the ingredients and used Special K cereal.  Thank you William!

Mixing plain yoghurt with the mayo (half and half) removes a few calories and doesn't affect the flavour.  I've also used bread crumbs in lieu of corn flakes.

We were not too crazy about this recipe. I'm sure that anyone who LOVES dill will like it, but unfortunately that's not us. Not sure why other reviewers thought this was bland - we thought the dill flavor was WAY too potent (followed the recipe exactly). Hubby said, "if you make it again, change the seasoning". I will try again, but will substitute the dill for garlic or something else we prefer. Also, make sure you crush the cornflakes into small peices, or you'll have a mess when cutting into the chicken. This was my first time using corflakes as a "breading", and I didn't crush them enough. Lastly, I agree with another reviewer - there was no "Allow excess to drip off" - the sauce was too thick for that. I'll update my review when I make it again with changes. I think it will make a nice "base" when modified with a different seasoning. :)

I would give this 5 stars, but I didn't exactly follow the entire recipe.  I made the mayo sauce and added just enough milk to make it thin enough for dipping.  I used Orange Roughy fillets, dipped them in the mayo mixture, then a mixture of 30 crushed saltine crackers, 2 Tbsp. flour, and 2 Tbsp. instant potato flakes (see Chicken Fried Chicken recipe on this site).  Then I fried them in a skillet (flip only once so you don't disturb the coating).  Then I drizzled some of the reserved thinned mayo mixture over the fried fillets.  It was soooo good!  Even my super picky husband really liked it.  Just thought the flavors in this mayo sauce seemed more suited to fish.  That's  what would make it a 5 star recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. However, the second time I skipped the mayo but added the spices to multi-grain flakes instead of corn flakes. They baked real nicely but the bottom flakes were soggy.  DELICIOUS!!

Very yummy chicken, the entire family loved this. I made one change. I used organic bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes.

"Succulent" is definitely the word that describes this chicken. The mayo makes it very tender and the corflakes give it a nice crunch. I baked half with bread crumbs and I think the cornflakes tasted way better.

Meh......maybe it's me.  I tried to get a crispy crust by sauteing in a skillet.  Worked, but the flavor is still lacking.

I took a few tips from the other reviews and made the dip the day before.  I didn't have corn flakes so used a bit of cereal, almonds and unsweetened coconut. I added lime juice and a few tablespoons extra as the dip seemed a little thick.  Even with pre-heating the pan, the coating got a bit soggy on the bottom, but over all it must of been pretty good because picky husband ate every last bit and was looking for more!  Next time I think I really need the crunch of corn flakes, but I would keep the almonds and coocnut.

This was a nice recipe.  I used to do something similar, but using butter before dipping in the cornflakes.  This variety actually gave it much more flavor.  I will make it again.  Kids and hubby liked it a lot.

Fantastic! I used thin-sliced breasts instead of pounding the chicken and it cooked fast and was so tender and juicy!  I also used crushed fat-free croutons instead of the breadcrumbs and left some chunks.  It was great flavor and texture.  Will definitely make this again!  Served with wild rice and steamed asparagus.  Delish!

This chicken was delicious! I couldn't believe how easy, fast and wonderful it was. I was nervous about the dill after reading some other reviews, but made it as is and it was wonderful! I used a Honey Bunches of Oats-type cereal with almonds and the sweetness of that combined with the dill was surprisingly good. It was also extremely moist and the flavors really went all the way through the chicken. One thing I think made a difference is I used Hellman's Mayo for the best flavor (regular - not low fat) and I sprinkled the chicken with salt before coating in the mayo mixture. Also, I took another reviewer's suggetion and crushed the cereal in a ziplock bag before coating the chicken in it. I kept all the measurements the same and just used three boneless breasts - had enough coating left over for one more piece of chicken, but oh well - not too much waste. This is one of our new favorites. Perfect for a weeknight dinner! Next time I'll take a photo since the posted photo doesn't due this recipe justice - it looks very attractive when cooked. Highly recommended! Thank you! Thank you poster!

I loved this recipe. I've made chicken countless times, and this is by far the most moist it has ever come out of the oven. I loved the seasoning. It was a family hit!
I would not change a thing. Saved to favorites!

Very good and easy.  We like dill so that was no problem.  I used Helmann's light mayo and extra corn flakes.  I did not pound the chicken so I baked it an extra 15 minutes.  The corn flakes were extra crispy but still juicy chicken and delicious!  Fiance approved.

Basic recipe was very good, but I thought the chicken was a bit dry.  Loved the dill in it.  Also, I substituted sour cream for the mayo.

We really liked this recipe.  I made no changes to the recipe.  The only thing I did do was to increase the amount of corn flake crumbs to coat the chicken.  Also, I think the mayo mixture would make a great sandwich spread.  My husband loves tomato sandwiches when the tomatoes are fresh & I can't wait for him to try this.

a unique combination of flavors makes ordinary chicken taste better. it's a bit messy to handle, but is a quick and easy process. i added a teaspoon of all the spices and mixed a 1/4 cup of low fat mayo with 1/4 cup of regular mayo. the entire resulting flavor was good. one point: be sure to adjust your cooking time/temp if you don't flatten your chicken to 1/4". i ended up adding about 15 additional minutes at 400 degrees in the oven and finished it for about 2 minutes on my george foreman grill before the insides were not pink anymore. just be sure to check and see what works for you!

As much as I enjoyed it, my family did not.  It was rather bland.  I will give it another go-perhaps with more seasoning

I put fressh dill and a small amount of clives in the mayo and used lime juice, because that's what I had.  Used crushed croutons.  I've read that  Greek  yogurt can be substituted for the mayo.  I'll have to try it;   that would be a lot less fat and calories!!!
Baked at 385.

EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!

Love this recipe.  Haven't changed it much.  I used Special K because I never have corn flakes.  Moist and delicious.  Thank you for this one.  My husband seldom likes chicken, but this one did it.

This was so awesome and easy! I didn't have dill weed so I Googled what to substitute and it suggested either parsley or basil and I did a little of both. I also accidentally used 1 table spoon of lemon juice; it turned out well. I also didn't have corn flakes. I wanted to used french's fried onions but didn't have those either, so I settled for crunched up rice chex. I cooked it for 20 min and sprinkled shredded Colby Jack cheese over top and cooked for another 10 min just to be sure on the meat. I didn't pound the chicken breasts either, but I cut them in half length wise to make them thinner. It really helped soak up the juices. Even with my extra cook time the meat was so juicy. I'll defiantly be trying this recipe again with the corn flakes and my idea of French's Fried Onions.

I used thighs and breasts because my boyfriend prefers dark meat.  These stayed so juicy with a crispy outside (I heated my dish before).  Even the leftovers went fast!

The mayo part of the recipe was nice, but I added honey into it and garlic powder into the bread-crumb mixture.  I also placed diced tomates and "italian" cheese on top of the chicken and melted it for 5 minutes.  It came out wonderfully!

Moist and tasty.  I love the taste of fresh dill and mixed up the mayo/dill mixture the day before and let the flavors blend.  I had to bake the chicken about 5 or 6 minutes longer than the recipe said, because I didn't pound the chicken as thin.

Will definitely do again! Didn't have regular corn flakes, had Special K Vanilla with sliced almonds and wow! This turned out Great! Thanks for the recipe. I thought the mayo would be overpowering - no way! It was wonderful.

This recipe was a hugh hit in my house.  I did add a little more dill because I am a big dill fan.  Also, I mixed the Mayo mixture up the day before so the flavors had time to blend well.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts so they didn't take as long to cook but they did make wonderful chicken tenders that didn't need any dipping sauce.

To be fair, I did make a few changes to this recipe.  I used fresh, crushed garlic, skipped the dill and seasoned salt, and added about 2 tsp. of regular mustard.  Also used bread crumbs instaed of cornflakes.  Even with the changes, I can't see that they would make much difference in the recipe.  It turned out nice and crispy after I put it under the broiler for about 2 min.(after reccomended cooking time).  Would make a good base recipe for something else, like chicken parm.  No great shakes on it's own, but not bad, either.  My husband said he would eat it again.  This was super easy and quick.  Made the whole meal, including asparagus and one of those instant-type noodle dishes in 45 min. flat.  It IS very messy, so be prepared.  I'm not sure what the submitter was talking about with the "let the excess drip off" stuff with the mayo.  It definitely doesn't "drip".  I had to kind of rub it in.  I'd make it again, but use more seasoning and top it with something.

I thought this was delicious! I didn't have dill or garlic but used oregano, basil, thyme and rosemary with the mayo (Hellman's). Adding the lemon made a nice consistency. I put salt and pepper on the chicken before dredging through the mayo mixture. Also, I didn't have cornflakes so just used regular breadcrumbs. I pounded the chicken and then sprayed the dish with Pam. This gave a nice little crust to the chicken. I will definitely make this again and would love to try with dill and garlic.

Pretty good but I felt something was missing.  The chicken was nice and juicy but the flavor was a little lacking for me.  Next time I will punch up the amount of spice and try adding some others along with it.  I used plain bread crumbs instead of corn flakes since we never buy them, maybe next time will try it with seasoned breadcrumbs too.

This is a great, quick, and easy recipe. I prefer to make slices through the breasts first, coat the breasts with tandoori powder, then apply the mixture of mayo, lemon juice, etc.. before adding the cornflakes and baking.

Can't believe I found this recipe on here.  I have been making something like this for years & everyone always raves about it!!  I do make mine with miracle whip & less seasonings, husband's preference and also use bread crumbs.  Might have to try the cornflakes & some seasonings tonight & see how that goes over as we were already planning on this for supper!!  Great recipe!!

This dish was delicious. I made exactly to the recipe, with the exception of the corn flakes. I didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I used other similar crunchy cereals I found in my cupboard, Rice chex, and bran. I think you could substitute any crunchy non-sweet cereal in here and it would taste really good.

Very moist.  I halved the dill and didn't add lemon. I heated my pan like someone suggested and added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  Hubby really liked it as did I.

Awesome recipe!  I used chicken tenders with this and it cooked faster. It was so juicy and tender!  I coated it in crushed Corn Chex cereal instead of corn flakes to make it gluten free for my husband.  It was great!  Even the kids loved it and we didn't have any leftovers.  Making it again tonight.  :)

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner for me and my husband. It was quick and easy and I had everything in the kitchen for the ingredients. I probably could have put more lemon juice in it but in all it was delicious. I will keep this recipe for a long time. My husband isn't big on chicken but he ate the whole thing!

Great recipe! I didn't pound the chicken down just because I hate doing that so my chicken had to cook longer. Next time I'll just cut them into strips like someone suggested. I used "it's a dilly" instead of plain dill and everyone liked it! :) definitely a keeper.

My kids call this recipe Cereal Chicken! I made this dish hoping that my picky eaters would like it and I was told that it was the best chicken EVER! It's now a staple meal in our house.
After reading the reviews, I did preheat the pan and I melt about 1T of butter in in before I put in the chicken. I have never had a sticking problem. Also, my family is not huge on dill so I cut it down to 1/4 teasp. Finally, I use much more than 1/2 cup cereal. I just dump a bunch in a zilpoc and smash it up. My kids say- the more "crunchies" the better! Special K works great too, if you don't have cornflakes. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Funny story on these.  I keep my ceral in ziplock bags.  When I grabbed the 'cornflakes' and made these I didn't realize they were frosted flakes instead.  My husband took a bite and has teased me ever since.  Overall... these are ok.  Messy and the outter breading does not stick to the chicken well.  Just be sure you use cornflakes, not frosted flakes on accident.

This is a great idea for a quick, easy chicken dish.  And it tastes great!  I was expecting more "pop" from the corn flakes.  But the mixture helps keep the chicken moist and flvorful.  I might try marinating the chx in italian seasoning for a few hours before making, just to get a bit more flavor.  This would also be a great activity with small children!  They would love the dipping and corn flake part :)

OK, OK, first the changes: I cut my chicken breasts into 1" cubes for nuggets. I had 1.2 kg of meat and doubled everything except the lemon juice - will double that next time. Plus I added 1/8 tsp cayenne. The amount of mayo mixture was just perfect, none to 'drip off', none left either. Very good, will make again.

Despite the funny name to this recipe, it really was very good!!!  I was worried it was going to be too much dill, which I like, but don't love.  It wasn't though, all the ingredients went very well together to make a very flavorful chicken dish.  I tried a reviewers idea to heat the dish before I put the chicken in the oven so the bottom wouldn't be soggy because I hate that.  It didn't work for me.  I heated it and then rubbed some butter in the bottom.  It started sizzling and I immediately put the chicken in and then in the oven.  I even broiled it at the end for a few minutes.  Maybe I did it wrong, I don't know.  I have never tried that before, Oh well!!  It was still great and I will make it again.  It was good enough to deal with the soggy bottom!!!  Thanks!!!

I made this chicken last night, it was good, but not great. The bottom of the chicken was soggy. I think next time, I will just coat the top of the breast. I used 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 light sour cream. I also used Curves Honey Crunch. Its Whole grain and it was very crunchy. Also there is only 1g of fat in 1 cup.

This is great for a working wife.  Even though there is just my husband and myself home now, this recipes is great for us.  It comes off as a pains taking effort to get a fine meal on the table when it doesn't take any time at all.  Keep up the good work

I made this for my family, and they loved it! My step daughter HATES mayo, and she loved this! She didn't even know it had mayo in it! It was delicious, and easy! It will be a favorite for a while in our home.
