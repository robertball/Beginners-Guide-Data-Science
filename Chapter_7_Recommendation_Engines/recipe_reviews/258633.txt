I subbed an Anaheim chili for jalapeño because jalapeños are too spicy for me. I found this to be bland. I don't think the jalapeño would have added the extra flavor, just extra heat. I feel like this could easily be 5 stars with a few tweaks... but I have no idea what those tweaks would be. More orange zest? Lime zest? More garam masala?

OK, if you're a summer person, you need to make this salad...It's a perfect mix of flavors and texture. loving the mango and citrus combination..
So ..I had 1 change, I used frozen cooked, deveined, and shelled shrimp (but thawed prior to making the dish) , the hour sitting in the fridge is perfect for the blended flavor...
please have a patron tequila and lime cocktail with this...awesome!

Perfect summer food! The only thing I changed was increasing the garam masala to a full tablespoon and using canned diced jalapeños (because if I can avoid rubbing jalapeño in my eye while cooking, why use fresh??)

I loved all of the different color and texture there was to this and it turned out good. I did think it needed just a little bit more seasoning but that is my only complaint.
