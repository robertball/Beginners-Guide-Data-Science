It is very seldom that there is a recipe that doesn't work that I can't fix.  I tried several approaches to this one which included  pre-cooking the bacon, partially cooking the bacon, using bacon crumbles. Changing the size of the mug and so on. No joy. This dog just won't hunt.

7.18.16   I rarely change a recipe first time through, particularly if I’m the first reviewer, but I did make a couple changes in this one.  I never eat 4 slices of bacon for breakfast (that's a lot of bacon to fit into a coffee mug)) and even two tortillas seemed excessive to me, so I used 1 tortilla and 3 slices of bacon (1 more than usual).  When I took the mug out of the micro, the tortilla was sitting in about 1/2” of bacon grease (totally didn’t like that), so I set it aside on a paper towel to drain.  I know microwaves cook differently, and cooking this at 4 minutes in mine made it hard as a rock, inedible, had to throw it out.  Don’t want to discourage others from trying this recipe, but I’d recommend you set your timer at 1-1/2 to 2 minutes for a first check, adjust your time accordingly, and it just may work for you.  I like the concept of this, but unfortunately, it was a failure for me today.  Doubtful that I’ll try again, just move on.  I'm giving this 2 stars only because I think the key to success here is getting the timing right for your microwave...good luck!
