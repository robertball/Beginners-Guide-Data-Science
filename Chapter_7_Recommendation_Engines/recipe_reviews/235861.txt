To me, candy corn just tastes like, well, sugar, not much else in the way of flavor. IMO the only thing differentiating it is its color which you could achieve just by adding some orange food coloring to your favorite frosting recipe.  And a word of caution...when you’re putting your saucepan down into the water bath, make sure that the water level isn’t too high.  I ended up with some water seeping into the pan and then had to add more 10X sugar to get it to the right consistency.  There’s nothing wrong with this icing, it’s OK, but to me, I don’t know that it’s worth the cooking and the water bath steps involved.  Sorry, Christine, maybe others will see it differently.
