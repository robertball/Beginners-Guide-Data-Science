Great dish! Spiced it up with some Tobasco. I think this will be especially good for cool weather.

The onions and red bell peppers just do not taste right with sweet potatoes.  Bake the potatoes and split with some non-fat butter substitute for a better taste.

These were yummy.  Even without the sour cream.  I will definitely make these again.

I liked this.  I actually chopped up my potatoes and tossed them with a little butter, salt, pepper, and ginger.  Then I cooked it like a casserole and topped it with the onions and peppers.
