I made a few small adjustments because we're on a tight budget this week and I wanted to use what I had on hand. I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of american cheese and because I didn't have green olives on hand, I doubled the pickles. We don't care for sweet pickles, I used garlic dills instead. To fill it out a bit, I threw in some chopped celery. Good quick dinner (when combined with some seasoned steak fries dug out of the deep freeze) at the last minute.

These were really good! I was looking for something different to do w/ leftover hot dog buns (besides the obvious), and stumbled upon this recipe. I did omit the hard boiled eggs, and added an extra can of tuna. I didn't measure everything exactly, just did it to taste, also adding a little salt and pepper. The flavor was great. I really enjoyed this take on a traditional tuna sandwich/melt. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My mom always made these for us and now I make them for my kids.  I make exactly as the recipe says and they are great.  For parties, I cut the buns in half so they're smaller and then after I take them out of the oven, I put them in the slow cooker on warm to keep them heated.

I went a little off recipe with this one. I don't like onions or green peppers, so I didn't add those. I like olives but didn't have any so I left those out, too. But this is a great recipe for customizing to your personal taste! I think you could make the tuna how you like it, then make the coneys. In fact, I think this is so great, I am passing this to a friend who has a Boy Scout's troop. She is always looking for recipes and I think this would be a perfect camping recipe! Great for kids! Thanks so much for the post!

Not too bad. I left out the olives and green pepper. I used dill pickle relish and shredded cheese. Made a decent light supper with some chips and a fruit salad.

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and dill pickles instead of sweet relish.  It was okay, but a little bland.

i actually had everything to make these. i was surprised at how the bun crisped up nicely. i thought these were really good but hubs said the filling was mushy. he wont eat tuna melts and this was my way of sneaking one past him- hey, at least he ate it! i was going to serve this w/ coleslaw but it was too cold so i made cabbage au gratin from this site(tastes a lot like mac and cheese) instead.

I don't really understand why this doesn't have higher reviews me and my kids love it...my husband doesn't care for the eggs in it...but other than that I make this once a month.  The kids love getting served their dinner in a foil wrap.  They are a little messy to eat though so keep some napkins near.

This recipe has been in my family for several generations.  Everyone loves them!  Pickles aren't in my family recipe, but it sounds good.  I use cheese slices and place 1/2 slice on each side of bun before I add the tuna mixture.  My Mom liked to spread "Cheese Whiz" on the buns.  Enjoy!

My mother used to make these when I was growing up and they were a big hit!  This recipe is pretty much like the one she used except she only used two boiled eggs, no olives or onions, 2 tbsp. of sweet pickle relish and only about 3 tbsp. of mayo. I add onions when I make them, but not olives, not a favorite in my house.

These are sandwiches are fabulous! We don't like cooked green peppers, so I left them out and used more pickles and olives (we like it with rings). I used grated cheese, and put just a bit on top of the filling to stretch it. You can place all the sandwiches in one pan and then wrap the pan tightly in foil, if you want to skip the bother of individual wrapping. My family loved these.

I think it was the sweet pickles that got me.  Might try with kosher pickles.  Thanks for the post.
