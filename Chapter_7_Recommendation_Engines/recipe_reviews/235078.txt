Very tasty appetizer!!  Made this for a big crowd and wasn't sure of everyone's tolerance or liking hot jalapeños so I reduced the amount  of these to only 2 (could have safely gone with three).  After mixing everything together I thought it needed just a bit more seasoning so added a bit of salt and maybe 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  This took it over the top and everyone loved them!  Thanks for a great recipe KristenM1.

Family and guests loved them!  I used Serrano peppers to make them a little spicier.  We like a kick of heat.

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I made them exactly as described and had plenty of the cream cheese mixture to make more mushrooms than the recipe called for.  I will be making these again.

UPDATE:   The mushrooms were AMAZING and my guests couldn't get enough of them.  THanks so much for this wonderfully easy recipe! !   

ORIGINAL REVIEW:    Okay at first the cumin ingredient freaked me out and seemed out of place but I still used it.  And so glad I did!   Also, I just used a very tiny can of diced jalapenos drained - easier than donning gloves and chopping.    Admittedly I have not even stuffed and baked the mushrooms yet because I am finding this to be one awesome cracker spread!!!   So I guess I shouldn't rate the recipe in full just yet, but I'll give the filling a high five and I'm sure the shrooms will be awesome!

really good balance, I used smoked cheddar (all I had on hand) and it was very good. Cumin was a nice touch. I tossed in a bit of parsley since it was on the cutting board.

Straightforward and delicious and while versatile, this recipe created a lot of flavor with the bite of the jalapeno pepper. I recommend 35min in the oven because those 5mins really melt the appetizer together,

Delicious!!! I made this for a party and they were gone in minutes. Several wanted the recipe and everyone loved them. I am making them again for an event coming up. What's great is that you can adjust the spice by adding or reducing the jalapeno's in the recipe. Originally I reduced it to 2 peppers but am confident that 3 is the perfect number for middle of the road heat that will not scare away those that don't like hot.

These turned out awesome again!!  We are really into super hot foods though so we made these using Habaneros instead of Jalapenos.
what an awesome flavour.  Even those that thought they were "too hot" still said they were yummy.  100% recommended

If I make it again, I will add some goat cheese, and maybe some pine nuts or pecans for texture.  The recipe as written sounds great, but does not deliver.

Delicious! Instead of chopped bacon, I wrapped them with a half of a slice of bacon. just cooked the bacon half way then wrapped them and cooked for 30 minutes @ 375. cooked on broiler pan to allow grease to drain. Thanks for the recipe!

SO GOOD!  I only used 3 jalapeños (seeded) because they were very large but I think next time I'll use the full 5 because we like a little more heat.  I sautéed the onions and jalapeños together before adding to the cheese mixture.  I sprinkled crushed pork rinds over the top (we're doing low carb) before baking but they'd be great with bread crumbs or parmesan too, the texture was nice.  My husband and I both thought that the smallest of the mushrooms were the best, each bite was a little too rich in the larger mushrooms.  Regardless, this recipe is definitely a keeper and I will definitely be making these again!
