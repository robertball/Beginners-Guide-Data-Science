I did not freeze tofu but instead put it in a colander and drained in the fridge for five hours. Then I crumbled it into chunks before mixing in other ingredients. If you use extra-firm tofu, it gets firm enough without freezing to be shaped into patties. I added two tbs of cornstarch as an additional binding agent. I also added miso (soy bean paste) for extra flavor. Added also shiitake mushrooms stir-fried with diced carrots. These patties are good even cold. My husband, who never cared for tofu, eats them.

These are pretty good burgers...but there are way better tofu burgers out there.  I baked these as the recipe suggested and they came out great...I couldn't bring myself to fry them in that much oil...kind of defeats the purpose of eating tofu in the first place!!

These are very tasty! I used Nasoya five
spice seasoned tofu and they were 
wonderful.  I served them like hamburgers,
with lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup etc.
My boyfriend loved them, and he hates
all vegetables :)

As a Peace Corps volunteer, Im always looking for easy vegetarian recipies that can be made with basic ingredients.  These burgers were fantastic and even worked out in improvised conditions.  I added mushrooms and peppers since celery doesnt exist here and that was fine.  Then baked them in the oven for about an hour, making sure each side was browned.  Ill make these often, thanks!

I had a hard time getting these to stick together, so I added a torn up bread roll to the mix and it worked great.  I also cooked these in the oven.  Yummy!

I am currently moving to tofu and made this for me and my boyfriend. We love it. I used the baking method and had some variations: 
*Squeezed the water out of the tofu for 20 min between plates & paper towels
*Then soaked the tofu in beef stock for 20min before crumbling into the baking pan
*Sauteed green peppers instead of celery
*Add fennel seed for a more meaty flavor
*Add cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes to add spice(we like spicy)

With the cheese and egg it will do well in the oven. Used 2 eggs instead of one to make it bind a little more.

Like another reviewer, I used chopped shitake in place of the celery and added some chili powder.  I also added an additional half egg I had sitting in my fridge.  Even with the extra egg, the final mixture didn't stick together and there seemed no hope of making anything remotely resembling patties.  I greased a two quart baking pan, packed the mixture in, baked it according to directions and cut it into squares instead.  The end result is good and I'll probably make it again, but it's really more like a casserole than a burger.

These tofu 'burgers' were great! Warranted, getting them to hold together was a challenge, (I added a dash of bread crumbs) but once they were in the pan, the oil kept them all in individual patties. I did add a little Adobo seasoning, parsley, and finely chopped red cabbage (in place of the onion) and about a tsp of dried minced onion. The consistency was a little more "fried chicken sandwich" than "burger" but delicious all the same and the whole family, including the meat-eaters, loved them.

I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese but that's about all I did differently and the way the recipe was written they really would not have turned out had I not put in about a half a cup of flour because it was so watery. Tip to all and to myself: (next time), make sure you drain the tofu really well, because if you leave too much water it won't work. That said, with the flour that I put in, they turned out and they were tasty. :)

I loved this recipe! It ws my first time cooking tofu and it turned out delicious. I used lite tofu and cut way back on the oil, thereby making it very healthy as well as tasty. I threw in some garlic, too, for more flavour.

I added an extra egg white since my mixture was not binding well. Once in the hot oil... they didn't hold their shape and I got frustrated and started "scrambling" the whole thing. Maybe my tofu was old? It had been frozen for longer than 72 hours... :( Don't think I'll try it again since the flavor wasn't that good to me. I'm sad... :(

Tasted kind of like plain scrambled eggs pushed together.  I did everything as the recipe asked, besides using 1/2 a cup of oil.  I used 1/4th of a cup and it was still way too much.  I had a problem trying to keep them together.  I wouldn't mind trying this recipe again, but I would definitely add more seasonings and less oil.

It would be really difficult to fry these because it was hard enough trying to mold them to bake but they were really good. I didn't freeze the tofu and as other reviewers suggested added shitake mushrooms. I problably won't be making this again though

Wow! These were fantastic! I changed a few things - used portobello mushrooms instead of celery, swiss instead of cheddar and I baked instead of fried. But they were easy to prepare, easy to bake and soooo yummy! Even my boyfriend ate some, and he's fanatically anti-tofu!

These were absolutely wonderful!!!! I even added a few extra spices just to test, and it tasted amazing! It's also good to add flour to the mixture after you have shaped it up so it will stick together and fall apart less!

Thanks for the recipe! This is sure to be a favorite of mine for a long time.

I found this recipe really boring and tasteless!  I baked instead of fried it, and it had a horrible texture.  It might be better if it's fried, but I wouldn't make it again.  Sorry!

We like these better than Boca burgers -- the texture is so pleasing!  I also added finely chopped shiitake mushrooms and chilled my patties in the fridge for 15-20 minutes to help them stay together.

I don't freeze the tofu beforehand. I drain in cheesecloth in a colander. And I add chopped peppers and scallions to the mixture. I love serving them on nice, fresh, while grain rolls with wasabi mayo, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, and sometimes a pickle. Yummo!

I made these without the cheese, added about 1/2 tsp. cumin powder, 1/4 cup oats, 1/4 cup wheat bran, and 1/4 cup shredded zucchini. Then stuffed them in bell pepper halves, baked them, and they were delicious. You could not tell you were not eating meat. Sprinkle just a little olive oil on them about halfway through baking so they don't dry out so bad before the peppers are done. Yum-Yum!

Tried these last night for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I was never a huge fan of tofu but I'm trying to eat better and decided to give this a shot. I used exra-firm tofu, drained for only about an hour then squeezed the heck out of it. I didn't bother with the freezing thing. I added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and a little bit of cumin but other than that didn't do anything differently. I baked them and served them on ciabatta rolls with spinach. These won't replace my hamburgers but are tasty.

We really liked this recipe when we tried it a couple of nights ago. It tasted great!
 I got frustrated when I first put it in the pan because it doesn't hold together at all.  But you can just dump in the whole thing and flatten it out.  Don't be tempted to cut it or anything until it has browned on the bottom so it will set up.  I was too impatient.  Give it about 5 minutes before you even test it.

It was bit eggy in my opinion. When I would fry it, it smelt and looked like I was cooking scrambled eggs.
Initially, I couldn't get this to hold together well in the pan either. I ended up freezing the patties and it worked better the second day.

My attempt at making these failed miserably.  I was afraid that they wouldn't stick so I added an extra egg, and then they just wouldn't stay together in the frying pan so I baked them and they ended up tasting a bit too much like egg.  I might try this recipe again just to see if I could fix my mistakes, but other than that I'm not its biggest fan.

LOVE IT! I froze the tofu and, after thawing, made sure I got as much liquid out before breaking it up with my hands and combining it with the other ingredients. I added 2 T nutritional yeast, some grated carrot, 2 t dried Italian spices, and another egg, then fried them in a hot pan with a couple tablespoons of olive oil. They held together great. This is one of the best uses for tofu I've tried! Really flavorful and toothsome!

I  fried the tofu burgers in a spray of Pam and it turned out great - I did not add cheese but I added fresh parsley they stuck together well in the pan and they are absolutely delicious- I cooked on high heat so they browned well!

I added super fine shredded carrots and a bit of All Season and plain bread crumbs to help keep it together. So yummy!

I had to add breadcrumbs. I have to say these were awful. There was no taste, very bland even w/ flavored bread crumbs, and keeping them together in the pan was more of a challenge then these were worth. I Sorry!

I found the recipe to be okay. I made some changes though. After I thawed the tofu according to directions and sautéed the celery and onion mixture I combined it in a bowl with two eggs because the ones I have are small and I also added about a tablespoon of garlic salt and about half a tablespoon of season all along with pepper. Then I preheated the oven to 350 degrees  and covered a cookie sheet with aluminum foil (to keep the dish load to a minimum) and I placed the patties on it and put in the oven and I cooked them for about 15 minutes on one side them I flipped them and cooked them for another 15 mins.

First time cooking and eating tofu - just sounded bland & boring. I was pleasantly impressed and will keep a few of these ready to go in my freezer! The only thing I did different was add a little cornstarch and fry in olive oil. Even my husband thought they were good! I'm sure there is better out there - but decided a 5 star was the way to go. Thanks for the recipe!!
