I was looking for a recipe for banana fritters b/c my husband grew up on them.  His family is Haitian and this is a traditional thing they make.  I couldn't use his mother's recipe b/c her measurements were not exact.  It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  I thought this was a good recipe, but I would add more sugar to the batter.  My husband and I both agree that it needed more bananas.  I think that if you like it for a desert, more sugar would be appropriate.  It also depends how much you like bananas.  We like the taste of bananas to be very strong and noticable.  Also, I tried a previous suggestion and piped it out of a bag.  The oil was way too hot and they came out like burned funnel cakes.  After the first attempt, I used less heat and transfered the batter to a bowl and used a 1/3 measuring cup as my spoon.  The looked just like his moms.  With more sugar and more banana, I would make this a five star recipe! (I also only use overripe bananas so avoid having to throw them out.  They also seem to be more sweet.)

Great snack, easy to make. I used far less than 2 qts. of oil. They came out like banana fritter donut holes. My husband couldn't stop eating them. If you don't have ripe bananas on hand, pop the top on an underripe banana and nuke it for 15-20 seconds or so, they mash right up.

When I told my husband I was making banana fritters for dessert, he looked at me like I had two heads and said, "O.K. Whatever."  After tasting a few he exclaimed, "These are fantastic!"  They are a perfect little dessert when you don't want to spend a lot of time preparing and/or shopping because all of the ingredients are on hand.

Very tasty...not too banana-y.  One thing - the oil at 375F was too hot, start at 325F and work from there.

It was fine and the texture was just right, but I used nowhere near 1 quart of oil and the banana flavor was barely detectable as Chevonne said. Based on that and other people's comments of blandness, I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and added an extra banana. Wonderful. Beyond that, just some tips: a) A piping bag isn't really necessary. The trick is to drop the right amount of batter in the oil all at once, otherwise you get these strings and odd shapes. I used on overfilled gravy ladle and let a dollop drop in. b) Eggs and milk should be room temp or you risk having a browned outside but uncooked middle. c) Use a lower temp. All stoves are different, so do a test batch at 325 first, then adjust. I ended up using 275 to avoid browning too fast and cooking everything in the middle. d) Don't overcrowd the pan. Each fritter lowers the oil temp, and it's much easier to manage five or six than 10. e) Don't add sugar to the batter, otherwise they'll brown faster. I also used tongs to flip and remove them from the pan before sprinkling with powdered sugar. Great recipe!

These are delicious! When I make these again, I'll probably try adding a bit more cinnamon and banana. I did as a previous reviewer suggested and placed the mixture into a ziploc bag and piped it in spirals into the hot oil. The result was a nice circular spiral that looked awfully close to a donut, minus the hole in the middle!

I gave five stars because of the changes I made to the recipe. Instead of 2 bananas I used 3 bananas, i used 3 tablespoons of milk, 3 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. As someone else mentioned I too used lower heat. With these changes it was absolutely delicious.

This recipe was ok but I thought it was a little bland, even though I doubled the cinnamon.  I might try it again by adding another half of a banana, more cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg.  Good texture though and easy to make

this is a super good recipe! my daughter and I made this for a sweet breakfast and we loved it. However we did add an extra banana and instead of coating the fritters in powdered sugar we used cinnamon sugar. All in all this is a great recipe!

These were soo yummy! My family couldn't stop eating them. I do think, however, that they could have used more sugar and bananas, but my kids loved them for breakfast with syrup!!!!

AWW  I forgot about banana fritters.  I used to make these when I worked at Furrs Cafeteria and I fell in love with them.  These are not quite the same but wonderful just the same.  I have to admit I use extra powdered sugar to coat!  If you're gonna blow the calorie counting you might as well do it good!!

i like the recipe except for me it would have been better made out of muffins then being deep fried. it just seemed way to oily for me and it seemed like a banana fried heart attack.

These were so simple! I have never made fritters before, and have only eaten them once or twice. A week ago I bought a big bunch of mini bananas, and they were very ripe so I wanted to check out some banana recipes and found this. I used 3 mini bananas for each required regular banana. I was also out of nutmeg, so I omitted that part, however, I will definitely use it next time.  I am also going to double up on the cinnamon, as I love a strong cinnamon flavor. They aren't very strong flavored, so you definitely have room to experiment; But these were great just as they were!  I only used about 1/2 q. of oil and cooked them in a wok (not electric).  If you were to top these with some caramel along with the powdered sugar, they'd make a great dessert!

WOW these are delicious.  Simple..quick..easy...I just fried them in a pan on the stove since I don't have a deep-fryer.  Mine came out perfectly light and fluffy, not the least bit doughy inside.  Just fry them to a nice golden brown on each side, like you would with any fried food.  I can't wait to try these with other fruits and flavors throughout the fall and winter.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!!

I didn't add enough eggs or use enough oil, which is probably why mine turned out like really soft pancakes. Still, they were really good. We served them with honey and maple syrup.

Not a 100% fair review since I added more banana than the recipe called for because the top rated review recommended it. I think that it was this reason that the middles ended up very doughy. Also, The top review recommended dropping this into the oil using a 1/3 cup measure which made the fritters too big to cook thoroughly without burning the outside. If I were to try this recipe again, I would stick to the original.

Very Good! I really liked the subtle flavor of the banana and cinnamon in these. I also like how they puffed up and were almost pillow-y. I do agree that 375 degrees is too hot to start these at because they get way too browned before the middle cooks all the way through. Next time I will start at 325 degrees and go from there. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made mine too big and so they didn't get cooked in the middle before they burned on the outside.  But they were still delicious!  My boyfriend especially liked the "undercooked" ones!

Yum! being vegan i sub'd a few things. milk- soymilk, eggs- egg replacer, margarine- earth balance. being health conscious (i know it's deep fried! just saying) AP flour- WW flour, sugar- agave syrup. used maybe 2 Tbs of powdered sugar sifted over. if you have overripe bananas and are tired of banana bread try these. they are super addicting... youve been warned.

These were pretty good.  I did use more banana in them, a little vanilla, and maybe just a smidgen more cinnamon and sugar.  We couldn't determine if we liked them better smaller and crispier or larger and fluffier in the middle.  Both ways were great with extra powdered sugar over the top!  I can see where this batter would make excellent funnel cakes and I may try that with this recipe next time!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasty!
But, I used the modifications other reviewers made, such as using more bananas (I used 4) and 1 tsp cinnamon.
I forgot to add more sugar and regret that as the amount of sugar written in the original recipe is small, therefore I had to sprinkle more confectioner's sugar and cinnamon powder of the fried fritters.

I loved the taste of these fritters, but they were just way too greasy for me. I tried making several adjustments to the batter, but the best I ended up with was something akin to a greasy funnel cake. Don't get me wrong, it was TASTY, but I wouldn't feel good about making it for the kids for breakfast again. It might do for a sweet tooth satisfier on a VERY rare occasion, but I'm not sure how often my sweet tooth and the presence of overripe bananas will coincide.

I substituted whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar. If you like really sweet you may want to increase the honey to counter the whole wheat flour, but I prefer slightly less sweet and this was perfect. After frying I drizzled more honey and dusted with cinnamon. It eliminates all of the refined sugar and flour, and is still delicious! About as healthy as a donut is going to get!

Kids loved them. I might add a little more cinnamon & nutmeg next time. I also friend these in a flat bottomed pan (no fryer in the house) and they worked fine. A little greasier than I would like, but there were no complaints from the table.

You need to cook the heck out of these things. Just because they look brown doesn't mean they are cooked in the inside.

 I think you could just use roll dough from a can put a banana slice in the center, fry it, and roll it in sugar.

They were good but i thought they tasted like an over-fried pancake so in that case i ratter make pancakes minus the extra fat. But this is the first time i make fritters I didn't know what to expect.

This recipe is a little bland... i think it's better if you'll add one more tbsp of sugar, double the cinnamon and add one more tsp butter. i put more confectioners sugar on each fritter to have it more sweet.

This recipe was spot on! However, I had 3 very ripe (almost throw away) bananas which I used instead of the 2 suggested in the recipe. Also, I added a pearl size drop of vanilla extract and a pinch and 1/2 of cinnamon. I served one fresh off the frier with a small scoop of Edy's Samoa cookie. My boyfriend who is very particular about desserts hollered from  across the den "HMMM, absolutely delicious!" He even stopped what he was doing and came back upstairs for seconds. - Want to get to a man's heart? Delight his taste buds with some good eats, you can add this one to your personal recipe book. ;-)

I usually LOVE anything banana, but not this recipe.  To me and my husband, we just didn't think it had much flavor.  The taste was really bland to us.  I even added more banana's and then banana extract.  Nothing helped.  I won't be using this recipe again.

WOW. I literally just made these about 20 minutes ago and I had to log on right away and leave my review. These were delicious and very quick and easy to make. My mom had given me a large bag of bananas early this morning and this recipe was definitely what I needed. Like suggestions by others I actually added 2 more bananas, 2 more tbsp. of sugar and little more cinnamon. I also added a little banana extract to make sure I had that banana taste. My 3 boys were gobbling these up as soon as they were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Now the real test is my husband who loves bananas but is tired of banana pudding. We'll see what happens when he gets home. Thanks!!!!

Great pancake batter! I followed the recipe word for word, minus the sugar for dusting, and instead of deep frying the batter, I made delicious banana pancakes! I also left tiny little chunks of banana in the batter. It made 12 pancakes, cooking 4 at a time on a flat skillet. They are so flavorful, I just ate them plain with my hands while standing up and cooking/cleaning up. They would be a good food to easily pack up for kids or adults to eat on the go.

Surprisingly easy mess free recipe. I added 5 tablespoons of sugar instead of the 3, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/4, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg instead of a pinch, half a banana more and they turned out great! My brother had them with ice cream and said they were delicious.

I made this exactly as suggested except that I used two very ripe plantains rather than bananas, and I didn't bother measuring the heat of the oil - I just waited until it sputtered when I tossed a drop of batter in. :) They were awesome and much less hassle than I thought they would be!

I couldn't stop eating it!  I followed the advice of others and added a heaping amount of cinnamon and a little more nutmeg.  Didn't use the confectionar sugar since it was sweet enough as is.  I used a ziplock bag and pipped the batter into the oil (which is easiet), it didn't look that pretty but it tasted great.

This wasn't for me at all... had too much flour taste and I cna't taste the banana at all, DH thinks it's ok but told me to put in more banana if we decide to do it the next time. If I ever make this again, I'll put in more sugar, banana and cinnamon. Thanks for posting anyway :)

This was great to satisfy some major sweet teeth in my family!  You must make sure the oil stays hot or too much will soak into the fritters and make them greasy.

Easy to follow, tasty!  Follow saproper's advice though -- oil hot but not too hot as it will brown too soon and middle will not be cooked.  Excellent easy recipe, fun way to use overripe bananas!

All I got were greasy little banana pancakes. Don't get me wrong; they were tasty (very pronounced banana flavor, which was awesome!) and will be eaten, however, they weren't even remotely close to what I expected a banana "fritter" to be.

Really good recipe!  I made adjustments as others suggested (1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla, an extra banana)  turned out nice.  I think I would prefer them as pancakes, not fried, but they were yummy!

This is a good "fried treat" recipe, but it didn't have much banana flavor. I don't think I will make it again.

Mine were not nearly as pretty as the pictures, but they were quite delicious. I added a little extra cinnamon and a dash each of vanilla extract and almond extract.

I made this recipe and it turned out great, but that's because I added one banana, an additional tablespoon of sugar, and put in a whole teaspoon of cinnamon rather than 1/4 tablespoon. However, it is a good base recipe that you can spice up to your liking.

These were so quick and easy to make, and sooo good. I came across recipe because I was looking for a way to use up my very ripe bananas (other than banana bread). Now I will make a point to make these in the future because they are simply delicious and full of banana flavor!

I increased the recipe to 1-1/2 x original.  I substituted Splenda blend (1/2 cup in recipe and used 1/2 cup original Splenda with 1 tbsp corn starch to dust after frying) and it worked marvelously.

I made them using a fry pan with about 1/2 inch of oil to shallow fry. My husband loved these, but he drizzled chocolate syrup and maple syrup on them to add flavor. I think next time (yes, there will be a next time because we always have bananas), I will try some of the suggestions to add brown sugar or more cinnamon as I feel they need a little something more.

Before I made these I read all the reviews. So, I used 3 bananas and added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar AND 3 tablespoons of white sugar. I also used extra cinnamon and added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I dropped them into the hot oil by the tablespoon and they turned out really good! I am only giving this 4 stars because if I followed the recipe exactly they would have been lacking flavor.

My husband and I both loved these! I used 1/3 cup of sugar in these and was liberal with the cinnamon too - delicious! I fried them in small round scoops and had to leave them in the oil until the outsides were pretty dark so that the insides wouldn't be mushy. Even though they were darker than I would have liked (more brown than golden brown), they didn't taste burnt at all. A few people commented that they weren't banana-y enough, but I think as long as you use large bananas you will be fine. (If mine had been smaller, I would have used three.)

These were pretty good and an easy way to use up ripe bananas.  I also had all the other ingredients on hand.  I piped them out of a ziplock back with the corner cut off.  I then swirled them into the hot oil.  They turned out thin, therefore they cooked all the way through and were not doughy on the inside.

These are good, but I added 2 tbls spoons more sugar, 1 more banana and banana baby food. I know that sounds weird, but it actually tasted better with 1 jar of that in it. More flavor. I will make these again with those adjustments!!

I thought because of all the good reviews this was going to be an awsome recipe. Every one I made was so gooey in the middle. Yes my 4 year old loved them but she eats anything. What a waste of time and all I got was goo and that gross feeling you get when you fry things.

I added 1 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp maple flavor, and substituted 1/2 tsp cinnamon blend for the cinnamon and nutmeg.  These were delicious and disappeared quickly.  I also used a cinnamon/ sugar blend instead powdered sugar on some of the fritters.

We thought these were awesome.  Good banana flavor, added about half a small can of crushed pineapple, as per someone else's suggestion.  I think the extra juice made the insides nice and soft, but not undercooked.  Forgot the milk but it turned out fine.  Had them with honey but I thought it overpowered it, will try with apples and confectioner's sugar next time...

I made these with apple instead of banana and they were great! I used two peeled and cored apples and diced them up in my handy chopper. We experimented with large and small fritters but found that if we made them too large the middle didn't cook completely. Make sure you sprinkle with lots of powdered sugar or else you probably won't find them sweet enough.

This is a great easy recipe. I found that if you make them larger and deep fry them a little longer they have a soft moist texture that's very good. My family loved them. Thanks Vicki!

Giving 5 stars due to super easy way to get rid of ripe bananas.  My husband and son really like them, my husband said it was like a banana funnel cake.  I made exactly like the recipe in a deep frying pan except I didn’t have nutmeg.  I had to turn the heat down after the first batch because they were starting to get too dark. 2 min per side worked.

Make your oil a bit cooler and cook a bit longer if you want the center not to be too mushy.

I was looking for something different to make besides banana bread and thought this recipe would be a nice change.  I substituted the white flour for brown rice flour, used coconut oil for frying (didn't deep fry), used butter instead of margarine and, since I didn't have baking powder, I used 1/4 tsp. baking soda plus 1 tsp. vinegar to replace the missing ingredient.  They came out like little silver dollar pancakes!  Very tasty.  I liked them with and w/o the powdered sugar.

LOVED IT, though I forgot to add the salt and baked it instead of fried. 

Added an extra banana, mine were a little small, added 1/4 cup more flour as well. Kinda ended up like baked pancakes, but still good.

With doughnuts, I usually look for yeast-based recipes, but I thought I'd give this one a try. I started the oil at 325 as some suggested, and after some trial and error, I found that the best temp (for me) was around 339. I find that the bananas make it hard to tell if the fritter is cooked or raw. I thought the banana flavour was fine - I noticed a lot of people said it wasn't enough. I used very ripe bananas. The final result was okay but not one I'd make again, and I didn't even make the full batter.

very yummy.  my son gobbles them up.  I handed one to my husband and he said that he doesn't like bananas, then proceeded to eat half the plate.  my favorite part are the little itty bitty ones.  I have made them per the recipe and have made them with added peaches.  the ones with peaches added were the best, I think apples would probably work just as well.  others have complained that they are too doughie.  they can be.  it is best to make them small, spread the batter when addind to the oil or squish in the middle half way thru frying.

This is a very good recipe for banana fritters--I've made it several times.  I like the consistency, as they don't come out soggy like most other recipes I've tried in the past.  To kick up the flavor, I add a little vanilla extract and extra cinnamon and nutmeg.

I had 3 very ripe bananas on hand and my nieces sleeping over. we made these for breakfast. I used all 3 bananas and put a full teaspoon of cinnamon. These are the only changes to the recipe that I made. we sprinkled with powdered sugar and ate them warm. We all liked them but I most likely will be making my banana bread next time instead of this recipe.

We used all spice instead of nutmeg (we didn't have any in the house), we also used vanilla instead of milk (also because we had not gone grocery shopping).  We dusted the fritters with sugar on all sides then put on cooling rack.  They were great!  Some also drizzled chocolate on the fritters which gave it more flavor.

I made some variation to this recipe, instead of the flour, I used Hungry Jack pancake mix. It turned out soo good ! Crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. I also added an extra banana to get a stronger banana flavor. I just ate like 4 pieces while I was frying it :-) If you want it sweeter, you can always put mores sugar or jam on top.

It was a pretty good recipe but I did half the recipe and I did not have any  baking powder so I use 1/2 tsp baking soda vinegar instead  and I added  another cup of flour because it seemed to runny.  I also add some more sugar because I like this sweet.

Great recipe, easy. I used 3 bananas and more sugar. My 4 year old daughter thought I was making banana bread which I make with chocolate chips, so I tried making them with chocolate chips, yummy! Then I tried adding chunky applesauce and something went wrong, consistency wasnt right, but still a fun and easy recipe. Thanks :)

These were absolutely delicious. I surprised my boyfriend by making them because he hasnt had them in years. He wanted to eat them all in one sitting.  Tip: Watch them when u put them in the pan they fry in seconds after they inflate.

Really good! I used overripe bananas and half and half cream instead of milk (only because I didn't have milk on hand). A little greasy, but that is to be expected. A great (occasional) treat!

These fritters are very moist and tasty. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract for extra flavour. They seem to cook too fast at 375 F, so I set my oil at 350 and cooked them approx. 6 mins. Also took icing sugar and milk, mixed to a thick drizzle consistency and drizzle over the fritters

Thanks for the recipe.  I tried these in a chinese restaurant the other day and got it into my head I wanted to make them.  I made them for the first time tonight and they were delicious and fun to cook.  My wife loved them too.  But.  But.  But. You have to try them with syrup. Put some syrup in a bowl and place the fritters on top, or just drizzle the syrup over the top of the fritters.  The choice is yours, but add the syrup to taste.  It can be quite sweet.  Vanilla icecream and syrup with the fritters is good also.  The kids love em like that.  Very sweet options I know but hey.  It is nice .

Well, I never thought I'd say it but these were better than my grandmothers.  They were fluffy and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Not too sweet.  Perfect! UPDATE: For the leftovers, instead of dusting them with powdered sugar, I shook them in a little cinnamon and sugar mixture and this was wonderful!  I think next time I will do this from the start and skip the powdered sugar.

These were a really quick and tasty snack. I served them with coffee in place of a doughnut. After tasting the batter, I took the suggestions of several other reviewers and added an additional banana and some brown sugar to sweeten them up a bit. I also didn't have any nutmeg so I had to use pumpkin pie spice and it turned out fine. I will make them again in the near future.

Mt husband and I were married in Jamaica and it was there that we first had banana fritters. I am not a big banana eater, but I would eat these for every meal. The only thing we changed is to dip them in cinnamon and sugar instead of powdered sugar. May I highly recommend giving these a try!

This recipe was delish and I would make it again using the following recommendations:  add another banana (the banana taste was a bit too subtle for me), double the cinnamon and use less oil.  I used a regular frying pan with a little over a cup of oil.  That was more than enough to fry up the entire batch!  Enjoy!!!

Great recipe!  I think they were just sweet enough, not too overpowering with banana flavor.  The only changes I made to the recipe is that I used half whole wheat flour and olive oil rather than margarine.  Very light and yummy.

I had some overripe bananas and about an hour before heading off to a friends with the kids.  This recipe fit the bill.  After the first batch (too doughy for me and desired more flavor) these are all the adjustments to the recipe.  3 very ripe bananas, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, an additional 3 TBL brown sugar, lowered the oil temp to 330 degrees, used a 1 1/2 Tbl ice cream scoop filled only 3/4 of the way (the small amount cooked through), shallow fried in 3/4" oil, turning after fritters were bubbly on top and brown on bottom, immediately sprinkled with sugar cinnamon mixture (for flavor) and after they cooled a bit to eating temp sprinkled powdered sugar on top (for appearance).  They were very good.  My friend thought they were delicious and I left there empty-handed.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I just made this for a potluck food sale, and i have to say it is SO GOOD i think i gained 10 pounds while i cooked them because ach one tha didn't look perfect i said "ooh, better eat that one!!"
its kinda hard to get the oil the exact right temp for them to fry, they burn so fat if you dont watch it. for those of you who dont like gooey insides, it might not be for you. myself i think the gooey is the best part, after all it IS made with mashed bananas, you cant expect it to be like a cake donut that is dense. After mine were slightly cooled i sprinkled a mix of granulated sugar and cinnamon. I also added more cinnamon and sugar than the batter called for and it was GREAT!!!

These were quite delicious and were gone before I knew it. I used 3 bananas and was glad I did - I really enjoyed the flavor. I added extra sugar as other reviewers suggested. I ate them hot as soon as they were done but my boyfriend thought they were a little mushy. He preferred them after they had cooled and dried a bit. Overall great recipe and easily tweaked.

I made a batch of these and ended up with too many so gave the rest to my next door neighbours who loved them! Great recipe although next time I would add a little sugar to the batter mix to make the fritters sweeter. A simple, quick and easy sweet treat!

This is a really good fritter recipe.  You really only need about a 1/2 inch of oil in a pan for these.  2 Quarts is overkill.  The key to keeping these from cooking too long is to use a small amount and spread it out.  The do puff up quite a bit.  I ommitted the eggs (my Jamaican friend never uses eggs) and they came out just fine.

Yummy!!  Add more bananas and sugar and cinnamon than called for, for more flavor.  Also, good to add raisins if you are a raisin lover.
I did 1 1/2 recipe and used four bananas.  It was about right, I think.
They grow twice the size as they cook.

Tried this, adding an addt'l banana, 2 more Tbsp of sugar, and piped it into the vs. dropping with a spoon. They turned out okay, had to cook in oil little longer than I'd have expected thus making them a bit greasy. Still, it's a good basic recipe when you're in the mood for something like this, it's very easy to make.

This is a great way to fatten up your skinny three year old! I added walnuts, vanilla and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. Then pan fried in 100% olive oil. She's been eating them all morning!

Light and delicous when adjusted to 3 tbs white and 3 tbs brown sugar and liberal cinammon and nutmeg.  Use an ice cream scoop to drop the batter in and they'll look like chubby little golden pancakes.

Delicious. I didn't use so much oil, as I wanted to shallow fry them. 
They were light, fluffy, and great. Easy to adjust the cinnamon, sugar, flour etc for your taste.

These are really very good.  I prefer them sweeter than the receipe calls for, so I added sugar like the reviews suggested.  Really a wonderful receipe that will stay in my receipe box.
Also, I put powdered sugar and pancake syrup on them.  Yummy!!!

These were delicious.  They turned out a little dark, but that's probably my fault.  I dropped them by the spoonful as the recipe said and had no problem with them cooking all the way through.  Could be a little sweeter maybe.

I didn't have any banana's so I replaced them with a can of crushed pineapple.  It was very good, a nice tropical twist.

I made this for my husband and 2 kids. My husband thought it was just okay, but my kids loved it and even though I'm not a huge fan of bananas, I really enjoyed this. I added a little more banana and cinnamon per other reviews.

I really enjoyed this unusual and simple recipe.  My husband was impressed, even though he was initially wary because they "looked funny."  A very tasty and versatile snack, though they don't keep well.

This just wasn't what I was hoping for. I made these with  grated apple and they were not sweet at all. I added extra sugar and spices and the taste is not there, even with LOTS of powdered sugar. I will look for a better recipe.

I nade this up for my girlfriend after she got out of work and we both loved it. I added some mushrooms to give it a bit more texture and I also served it with garlic mashed potatoes. We had enough for reheats and it was quite good even reheated. A delicious recipe for those tired of same ol' chicken with gravy. Excellent!

I have been searching for a quick and easy fritter recipe. This is very good. I like the fact that you don't have to dip the fruit in the batter-which can be quite messy.

This recipe was really tasty, and easy to make, my four year old helped me. My husband thought I used a mix to make this, it was great!
