I didn't care for the taste of the turnips paired with the spices so the second time around I made it with potatoes and it was fantastic!

Easy to make!  The spices took out the sharpness of the turnips!  It was spicy without being over powering!  Great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for lower cholesterol. Great for replacing your home made fries. I would  baking instead of frying. Put the oil in your pan, then the turnips and spices. Toss altogether to mix and pop in the oven about 350-375 for about 30 minutes. Less fat that way.

Very good dish.  I can't give 5 stars because I changed it somewhat:  I used 3 potatoes and 2 turnips; omitted black mustard seed because I didn't have any; and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes instead of the 1& 1/2 t. grd red pepper (BTW, the directions do not include using the grd red pepper).
