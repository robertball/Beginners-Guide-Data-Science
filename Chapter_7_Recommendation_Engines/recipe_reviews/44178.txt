I had to give up apple sauce (which I loved) when I was pregnant with my son.  This sounded so good that I had to try it.  It was wonderful, but since I wasn't using it for a glaze or filling and it was too sweet.  I'll cut down the sugar next time...otherwise it would be really good on french toast as well.  One other thing I changed was using dried cranberries which added in a great way!  Thanks for the recipe!  I can eat apple sauce again!

Very tasty sauce, and can be modified to your liking. I have made it with AND without the raisins due to particular preferences or because I didn't have any on hand. The one in the pics is without raisins. Depending on what I want, I might omit the cinnamon and add a bit of Grand Marnier. 
Love this sauce and have used it also to eat 
alone...
I DO recommend that you add a pinch of salt, it will brighten the flavor so much more.

Loved it with a few changes.  Used 1 apple and 1 pear.  Only used 1/2 cup of liquid-1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of apple juice.  Did not use white sugar used mixture of coconut sugar and date sugar to make it a little healthier.  Cooled the sauce and wrapped it in fillo pastry sheets.  Baked for 20 minutes in 350 oven.  Everyone loved them!

I will serve these apples as a side dish.  I used what I had in the kitchen.  Peach wine, orange extract, dark raisins.  The flavor was wonderful.
