Not bad. I thought the over all flavor was lacking something but I'm not quite sure what (sesame oil maybe?). I wasn't overly keen on the pine nuts and celery. This was ok for a change but isn't something I'd make again. Thanks anyway!

Made as written except I left out the pine nuts due to personal preference and added chopped water chestnuts instead. I too felt the recipe as written lacked something so after tasting it I added some sesame oil and Sriracha which bumped the flavor up a notch. Good base recipe just needs some amping up,
