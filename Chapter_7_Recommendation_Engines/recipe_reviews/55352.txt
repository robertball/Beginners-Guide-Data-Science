I really liked this, I tried it with brown rice which was still good, but I found that I had to extend the cooking time quite a bit.  If you try the substitution add the apples later, as mine cooked all the way down!  I added some ginger as well, a good side dish or light dessert.

This is great with apple butter pork loin from this site and different from other side dishes.  I found an easier way to make this in the microwave.  People were commenting on the apples cooking down and if you do it in the microwave, they don't disappear from the dish. I used Uncle Ben's Ready rice in the pouch which takes 90 seconds.  I cooked that first and then put that in a 2 quart casserole dish with all the other ingredients but instead of using 1 1/2 cups of apple juice I used 1 cup of apple juice and 1/2 cup of apple butter.  Microwave it on high for 5 minutes and stir then on high for another 5 minutes.

My Husband loved this.  My apples cooked all the way down though, you could taste them, they just dissappeared when I stirred the rice.  Thanks for the recipe! OH... and I added chopped walnuts, I think that was a very nice addition.

Don't change a thing with this recipe and you'll be in for a treat!  I tried the Grilled Brown Sugar Pork Chops from this website and thought this recipe would go nicely with them.  Boy was I right!  Our whole family enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for something new to try with rice and this will definitely be a keeper as I can make it year round.  Thanks for submitting!

Delicious! I substituted a mix of brown and wild rice. Package directions said to simmer 45 min, so I added apples and everything else 15 min before the end of cooking. I also substituted dried cherries for raisins and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.

Husband liked a lot.  Made it in the rice cooker with 1 1/2 cups rice, and 2 1/4 cups apple juice (other ingredients left the same).  Added more juice after it was done to break it up a little, as it was sticky.

very good. I used a granny smith apple and ocean spray apple juice for the rice. I followed recipe ingredients (no adjustments needed) and cooking instructions to a "T". Rice came out perfectly fluffy, tasty like cinnamon and apple-y rice. It paired nicely with the Brown Sugar Pork Chops, also from this website.

Great recipe! I also used brown rice which the cooking time says right on the box 45min. Added apples about half way done, but I would like to try adding them right from the start to see what happens. Hubby loved this and so did I. I too paired it with the apple butter pork loin.. wow it was good!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and I'm giving it four stars because it was pretty good and had definite potential.  (Think of my rating as a four-minus.)  I liked the combination of cinnamon and apples in this rice, however I think it needed more flavor.  Maybe some butter and/or sugar to bring out the apple & cinnamon tastes.  I served it with the Caramel Apple Pork Chops recipe from this site and the two went together well (as long as you don't mind cinnamon and apples in both your main dish and side dish.)  I'm thinking the leftovers from this rice should make good rice pudding, so I'm going to give that a try.

Yum! That's all I can say. We left out the salt and parsley and the kids like the leftovers with milk for breakfast. I also add a bit of ginger to suit our tastes here.

 Almost forgot, we add a few spoonfuls of sugar when eating the left overs with milk!

I've made this a few times as is and we liked it.   I always use brown rice and put the apples in a bit later so they don't cook all the way down.  The other morning I made it for breakfast.  I left out the parsley, used cider instead of the apple juice, added a touch of ginger and 2 T. brown sugar and before serving I drizzled each bowl with a bit of maple syrup, a sprinkle more cinnamon and a handful of chopped uncooked apples, pecans and raisins for crunch.  It was a huge hit!  I put another pot on to cook already because they will be up soon asking me to make it again.  Great hot breakfast change!

Made this with granny smith apples and it was good but was on the tart side which I like.  With using granny smith the apple didn't break down a lot.  Used this with grilled brown sugar pork chops from here and it was great!!

I loved this! I made it with pork chops and it complimented it perfectly. I didn't have raisins so I substituted it with craisins and it was so delicious!

This was a pretty good recipe but I found that I had to add water to my rice in order to make my rice cook fully.  Additionally I did think it was just a little too sweet.  I will likely make it again with pork chops, but will reduce the apple juice.

Call me crazy but you know, this made an excellent breakfast rice. I used a Granny Smith apple, golden raisins and omitted the parsley and used apple pie spice instead. I did add a couple tbsp. of butter to the apple juice so the rice wouldn't stick to the pan. With a little brown sugar stirred in and a float of FF half-n-half over the top right before serving, this was heaven in a bowl. Even my kids fell in love with it! This is a keeper!

The minute I read this recipe, without even reading the other reviews, I knew exactly how I was going to tweak it.  My mother was an excellent cook, and never made plain white rice.  She always began by sauteing rice with onion - so that's what I did here.  I sauteed the rice (I used Uncle Ben's converted rice) in 1 tablespoon of butter, along with a couple of tablespoons of chopped onion.  After about 5 minutes, when the rice was nicely browned, I added apple cider (not juice) along with the other ingredients, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, using golden raisins and a Granny Smith apple.  I cooked it for 20 minutes and let it sit covered for 5, because that is what is called for on the Uncle Ben's box.  I thought it was wonderful, and afterward, when I read the other reviews, I think the addition of the butter and the onions cut the sweetness and added that something extra that others found this recipe may have lacked.  I made it with the grilled brown sugar pork chops and thought the combination was just too sweet.  I would definitely make this with pork chops again, but maybe just simply grilled ones.  I wasn't sure how I was going to like the cinnamon flavor in rice, but it worked!

I loved this recipe! Since others had commented that the apples got mushy, I put them in with 10 minutes left in the cooktime. I also added a tablespoon of butter. I will definitely cook this again many times!

Yep, yum. Based on other reviews I wanted to add a little butter, and because I had a leek in the fridge, I chopped that up, fried it in butter, then proceeded with the recipe. Will be added to the rotation; tonight it was served alongside the roast sticky rotisserie chicken from this site, the perfect dinner at a fraction the cost of a restaurant meal. Thanks!!

This is good. I tried it first with brown rice and it did not work. It would not soak up the liquid. White rice worked just fine.

This was just okay.  It smelled heavenly and all of my kids were excited to try it, but no one liked it.  It tasted fine, but was just too sweet for my family's tastes.

A great twist on rice! Served this to my dinner guests and they loved it. So did my picky kids! I served this with baked chicken breast, salad, rolls and asparagus. Wonderful!

This recipe was delicious!  It worked very well with dinner, but later I spooned it over vanilla yogurt (kwark for those in Holland) and it was even better.

This was excellent!  I made it for Christmas dinner, to accompany a fruit glazed ham and roast duckling.  It went well with both.  I used regular white rice and used some of my own home-made frozen apple slices with cinnamon.  I forgot about the parsley, but it was so good without it, that I doubt I'll add it when I make this again in the future, which I will surely be doing!  Thank you for this recipe.

This rice had really good flavor, but for some reason mine would not get soft.  I only had brown rice so I increased the cooking time and added the apples and raisins in the last 15 minutes.  I ended up adding close to another cup of apple juice and it still wouldn't get soft :(

Since a lot of the reviews commented about how this was more of a dessert than a side dish, I made a few changes to make it more 'adult' as some of the reviewers were calling it. I used 1/4 c of wild rice, 1/2 c white and put that with the apple juice, 1 1/2 cup of water and raisins in the rice cooker. While that was cooking, I browned 1 medium onion and just before it was done browning I added the apples. Once completed, I added the onion mixture to the rice mixture. Very light, flavorful and a great sidedish to compliment any meal. Next time, I think I will use dried cranberries instead of or mixed with raisins. I have made a similar mixture using pineapple juice. This rice is a great bed to serve salmon on.

I was walking through Krogers trying to come up with something to feed the family for dinner.  I had pork cutlets in the fridge, and the the line "Pork chops and apple sauce" from the Brady Bunch popped into my head.  I whipped out my wunderphone and googled apples and rice this is what I chose.  It is a very sweet rice dish, and quite a pleasant surprise.  The only complaint, and it's mine, everyone else loved it, is that it needed more salt.  That may be on me because we typically buy low sodium chicken broth..  But this is a definate "do again".

Ok, the reason this gets only 3 stars is not because of how it tasted, but because it did not call for enough liquid!! I kept having to add more apple juice to get the rice to cook all the way through. Anyone else have this problem?? The taste was very sweet, my kids gobbled it up. I will probably make again, but tweak to give it a more "grownup" flavor.

I think it was a little too sweet for a side dish. It almost tasted like apple pie! Which idn't a bad thing, but with dinner it might have been too much. Also my rice took a really long time too cook, so I would adjust the time for softer rice.

made the recipe with minute rice, adding apples halfway thru the 17 minutes.  it was done within the recipe's stated time.  i thought the flavor was pleasant - didnt think more cinnamon or was needed and didnt think it was too sweet.  the apple juice i used was from healthy balance so it contains less sugar so maybe that's why it didnt taste too sweet.  but i guess i'm not a huge rice fan anyway so no one in my family really ate this up.  but i do think if you like rice, it would make a fantastic side dish to several main dishes.  we served it with ham and thought it was good, but think it would be great with grilled pork chops too.  definitely a recipe worth a try, esp. since it's so easy to make.  thank you!

This was just so so.  It wasn't totally gross, I just wouldn't make it again.  The apples were good, just the texture with the rice and apples wasn't appealing.  Flavor ok, texture eh.

An excellant change to ordinary rice. However I cut down on the apple juice, mixing it 50:50 with water. Also nice cold. I made it with Basmati Rice but washed it well first.

This was very good!  I served it along side pork sirloin roast as an alternative to the usual mashed potatoes and gravy.  I didn't have any raisins or fresh parsley so I substituted with diced celery and dried parlsley flakes.  I used a red delicious apple which held up in nice diced cubes and didn't go mushy while cooking.  I will definatley make this again and be sure to have raisins on hand nest time.

The apple juice didn't flavor the rice in the way I thought it would.  The only change I made was to omit the parsley.  My family thought it was good, but I won't make this again.

Making this was a lot of fun, especially as a beginner cook. I've made it a couple of times and did little things to tweak it. 1) I usually end up cooking the rice for 20 minutes. It's not much longer, but I just find it helps the rice take up more of the apple juice. 2) This maybe be due to inexperience, but I've had a problem with the rice getting burnt. So, while it's cooking, I stir the rice and apples periodically to prevent the rice on the bottom from getting burnt. Also, I used a non-stick skillet rather than a saucepan to help with that issue as well. 3) If you want to make the rice sweeter to use it as more of a desert, use apple cider instead of juice. In the future, I want to experiment with different apple juices/ciders to how much of a difference the sugar content of the liquid will make on the sweetness of the final dish.

We thought this was a little bland. The second time I eliminated the salt and added 3/4 - 1 teaspoon chicken broth base. (My preference is Better than Bouillon). I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins and added just a pinch of garlic powder. Also, make sure your cinnamon isn't old. This is a great time of year to replace spices as they frequently go on sale for 50% off. Nice combination of spice & savory!

We tried this recipe with the Grilled Brown Sugar Pork Chops, as suggested by other reviewers.  It is a keeper, just as written!  I used jasmine rice, and let it sit for 10 minutes after cooking, as per cooking instructions for that variety of rice.  We thought this would make a nice dessert with a little cream poured over it.  Thanks for a great recipe!  We'll definitely be making it again.

Yum! We really liked this, even a bit sticky as it got. I used part basmati ricepart regular long-grain white because that's what I had around. Smell is wonderful. I might use part water, part apple juice next time to cut down on the sweetness. It was really tasty, but a bit too sweet for your standard side.

I always rate the recipes by how much is left after dinner.  Not a whole lot was left.  Being a novice baker, I may have forgot that adding sugar into rice may make it burn.....while I didn't burn it.....we'll just say it browned on the bottom.  Top was good.

Very interesting. It almost reminded me of a mushy rice pudding. The raisins were great as they added a great burst of flavor when you bit into them but the rice itself was a little bland.

This was ok, a little sweet to me for dinner.  I served these like many others, with the grilled brown sugar chops (in my case, pork steaks).

I substituted brown rice and it was still yummy.  The apple juice I used was cold, so it took longer to cook... 1.5 hours!  The liquid boiled off in about 45 min, but the rice was still hard. I had to keep adding water a cup at a time, letting it boil off, until the rice cooked.  I was surprised at how long it took, but it was worth the wait.  This is really good with the brown sugar pork chops from this website.

This was really good and went great with pork chops.  I added a tablespoon of butter to it at the end and it cut into the sweetness of the dish just enough.

Very good!  I used brown rice and left out the parsley.  Went very well with the drilled brown sugar pork chops from this site.  My husband loved it!

This was okay.  My 3 year old ate it. I was not so excited about it.

A pleasant and unique variation on traditional rice. Quite easy to prepare. A touch on the sweet side.

I love this rice. When I make it again, I will try diluting the apple juice a bit though.
I tried it with the apple raisin pork chops recipe on this site but I found it to was too "appley". It was a nice complement to Maple Chicken though.

It had potential. I used a rice cooker and so I needed to add 1/4 more apple sauce. I paired with a very flavorful pork dish and that was my mistake. It was too overpowering for the rice. I think this would be good with more cinnamon and covered with milk for a warm healthy desert.

This was a very sweet twist on rice.  It reminded me a lot of apple cinnamon oatmeal, minus the oats.  This recipe would act better as a dessert rather than a side dish-- it's just a bit too sweet.

I can see that this could be good with pork chops.  
I deleted the parsley and used it as a light, not overly sweet desert.
