The taste is good, the whipped topping isn't really necessary though. Also, when spreading the cream cheese, make sure to warm it up a little or else the cake will tear. I'd make it again without the whipped topping. Overall, a good recipe though.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday, and he LOVED it. In fact, I gave some to my neighbor, and she's been asking me to make it again ever since! This cake lasts an amazingly long time in the refrigerator, and freezes well.

Looks as good as it tastes!  Don't leave off the topping, it really adds to the presentation.

This cake is the best combination of cherry cheesecake and black forest dessert--we loved it!  I left out the whipped topping (because my cake baked up so wonderfully fluffy, there wasn't enough room at the top for it), and it was perfect even without.  This is a great make-ahead dessert that I will definitely make again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good dessert.  I used a Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix (I always use Duncan Hines). I used 2 cans of cherry pie filling instead of 1, because 1 can would barely cover the top of the cake, and I used an 8-ounce Cool Whip instead of whipped topping mix. **UPDATE** I made this again, but I used an 11x15-inch pan instead of a 9x13-inch, which worked out much better.

This cake was excellent and easy to make. It stays moist and the cream cheese layer really pulls it all together. My family ate it within a few days. By the last piece, the whipped topping was beginning to dry out a bit. This would be a great cake for a potluck or party, when you are fairly unlikely to have leftovers! I'll make this again, I am sure.

This recipe was great!  I did add the whipped topping, but would've of been good either way.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!  I will make again.

Very yummy!  I took this to a Sunday dinner before Valentine's Day and everyone loved it.  I did modify it some.  It made so much cream cheese filling I used it in the middle and frosted the top cake with it.  I used the cherry filling that ran off to decorate the top.  I didn't use any whipped topping.  Still very good!

l made this cake for  Easter dessert  and l put green food colouring in the cream cheese and sugar and red cherries with pink whipping cream..
lt was excellent and Spring looking with the colours..l find it tastes much better after sitting 24 hrs.  Kept in the fridge, the slices with layers was showing and overall, would make it again.

I liked it..but i didn't absolutly love  it.  It was a nice change from  
using  icing. And it did taste like black forest cake.
