1.25.17  I suppose it depends on what you’re using it on, but I drizzled the vinaigrette on  some fresh apple slices and orange segments, and the oil was just a bit too dominant for me.  If I make this again, I’ll add more vinegar and a little more chile-garlic sauce (lost that flavor completely) which I think would complement the tart cherry juice well (all just personal taste preferences I suppose).
