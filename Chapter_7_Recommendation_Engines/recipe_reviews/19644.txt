Fantastic! with a few modifications as follows.

don't fry the eggplant: brush a little bit of olive oil & cook them in a oven at 450 till moderately soft...you don't want mush...

bechamel sauce:  I don't get why everyone is saying this makes too much sauce?!  It doesn't, trust me.  You want at least an inch high layer of this when it's done cooking, so use the ingredients as written.  I do agree with adding the extra eggs.  I made the sauce as directed, then as it cooled I added two eggs yolks one at a time, blended that, then I added the 2 egg whites (which I had first beaten till stiff with a mixer).  Next time I might try the 3rd egg as some recommend for even more firmness.

meat sauce:  save calories, don't brown the beef in butter!  Increase garlic to at 2-3 cloves.  I used italian seasoning for "fine herbs".  Add a big pinch of sugar to cut the acidity.  I used about 1/2 tsp of salt, and 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper.  I made the meat sauce one day ahead (to save time on the big day & to allow the flavors to come out).

mysterious olive oil:  I don't know where that 1/4 cup of olive oil is supposed to come in?  I never used it.  Certainly didn't miss it.

construction:  Use a big/deep lasgane pan.  The 9 X 13 glass pan isn't big enough.  

To be more authentic you can add a thin layer of potato in the bottom.  Peel two potatoes, slice them about 1/4 in or less slices, brush with small amount of olive oil, roast in 450 oven for about 15 minutes.

Having parents who lived in Greece for years, we had many variations of this dish.  The best one is using sliced potatoes as well as eggplant.  If you add 3 egg yolks to the white sauce, then beat the whites to a stiff peak and fold them in your crust will puff up beautifully.  It is wonderful.  Even my 3 year old loves it.

Superb!  I live in Greek Cyprus and this recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted to cut out the extra cup of fat from the olive oil and butter so I broiled the eggplant until browned with olive oil sprayed on top & bottom of thin slices.  Diminished the cinnamon & nutmeg to 1/8 tsp ea., (did use oregano, basil & thyme)and left the nutmeg out of the bachamel.  I used only 2T butter in the meat sauce.  It was fabulous!  I'm glad it makes so much--can't wait for the leftovers!

The moussaka was very good, but I give this 3 stars for a few reasons. First, if you have never prepared Greek food before (ESPECIALLY moussaka) this recipe is very poorly written - it's way too vague. 9 x 13" is not a big enough pan by any means - go larger. Second, it calls for way too much onion and eggplant. I cut 1 1/2 onions and 2 eggplants and didn't use them all. The writer called the bechamel a "thin sauce" but it actually should be very thick - about the same consistency as a yogurt. Make sure to drain your meat very well and, if necessary, spoon out the liquid before adding the meat to the casserole. Let your moussaka cool for a good 30 minutes before serving. 

This is a good recipe, but my greatest advice if you have never made moussaka before - seriously, review the recipe several times and start cooking it 4 hours before you intend on eating it. Also, if possible, have a friend/child/spouse on hand to help you out. Don't give up, it gets easier as you go!

This was awesome!  I have been to Greece, and must say, the flavor was very authentic!  I had to make numerous modifications, however, to make it more lowfat to suit my taste.  I steamed the eggplant instead of frying in olive oil, and omitted the 1/2 cup butter in the meat mixture (don't forget to drain the meat fat before adding the spices).  I substituted 1/4 tsp. oregano + 1/2 tsp. basil + 1/4 tsp. thyme for the fines herbs, and increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp (key!).  I cut the butter for the bechamel sauce in half (i.e., used 1/4 cup), and added 1/4 tsp. salt + 1/8 tsp. pepper to it.  I used only 3/4 cup parmesan instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I took other reviewers' advice and folded 3 beaten egg whites into the bechamel sauce (discarded the yolks instead of adding them to the meat mixture) - this was key to making the top part authentic!  In addition, I think 1 layer of eggplant is more of how they serve it in Greece, but if you want a taller casserole, make it 2 layers.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. I had tried one from another site some time ago and vowed I would never make it again. But when I learned of this site, I gave it another try because the recipe was so different, I figured "how could I go wrong"? I KNOW how Moussaka should taste (my in-laws are Greek) and this is it! One reviewer suggested adding 3 egg yolks to the bechamel sauce (I did) and another reviewer suggested beating the whites to form a soft peak and fold them into the bechamel sauce (I did that too). I followed everything else to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing.Well, maybe just a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg on the top before popping it into the oven.Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe...it's a keeper!

This was a really nice find.  I followed all of the suggestions to make it more healthy: eliminating or cutting out fat), I grilled the eggplant, cut out the wine (didn't have any on hand), beat three egg whites and folded into the bechamel and substituted marjoram for parsley as I didn't have any dried.  This recipe is time intensive and the bechamel sauce cannot be interrupted - be prepared for that.  The only thing that I didn't like was that it didn't plate up nicely.  However, the taste was sublime and so next time I make it (and it's entirely appropriate for company), I will make it in ramekins.  A very good, authentic flavor and after revisions, a healthy recipe.  (With all changes, brought total calories down to around 360/serving, assuming 8 servings.)  Very filling w/a green salad.

I'm lucky to live near a fantastic Greek restaurant and their moussaka was to die for. It's easier to buy it there than to make this recipe...HOWEVER, it tasted very good. The prep time is longer than 45 minutes, so please make sure you're not making this after work (like I did). I did use a non-stick pan for the eggplant and spray it with Pam to cut out some of the fat. I also left out the stick of butter in the meat mixture and used a little olive oil instead. I mixed a 1/2 c. parmesan with a 1/2 c. feta - made it authentic! The bechamel sauce turned out well as written in the recipe. I put two cups on top of the first layer of cheese and then the other two cups on top of the second layer of cheese...otherwise, there was too much bechamel for one layer.

I enjoyed this recipe. Followed other recomendations. layered the filling with the sauce (middle and top). really needed to organize the ingredients so they would follow the flow of the recipe and I felt there was an extra butter mixed in there. But maybe it's cause I didn't brown the beef with butter. No difference to me, still tasted great. also to save time, I cubed the eggplant and sauteed in olive oil. I also cut back on the nutmeg because I don't like a lot of that flavor with beef. Thanks for the recipe. (used up a good amt of eggplant from the garden this year)

I never had moussaka before, but this was very tasty.  I made some minor modifications -- I used feta cheese instead of Parmesan, added 3 beaten eggs to the bechamel sauce (puffed up nicely when baked), and eliminated any extra oil/butters (I broiled the eggplant with just a spritz of cooking spray).  I even used skim milk for the bechamel sauce and you wouldn't even know the difference.  This is a great company dish.  It presents beautifully at the table.

I omitted the nutmeg, used only a sprinkle of cinnamon and used the reviewers recommended basil, thyme and oregano for the 'fine herbs'. I browned 1/2 of the eggplant in the olive oil (yes, it does soak up the oil fast and takes more than recommended) and I sprayed 1/2 half of the eggplant with spray olive oil and broiled it. I didn't like the pieces of eggplant that were broiled. The pieces browned in oil were much better tasting, so next time I would try to decrease the butter more and not alter the original cooking method of the eggplant. I used shredded parmesan instead of grated and couldn't really taste it in the dish. I added one egg to the meat mixture which helped it hold together well and I added the 3 beaten egg whites to the sauce. I would cut the 3 egg whites in the sauce to 2 the next time as the bechamel was stiffer than I like it. I prefer it to 'melt' into the meat mixture slightly when heated in the microwave. I doubled the meat amount and had plenty of eggplant (used 3 medium sized) to make two pans of the dish. I give it 4 stars because it's not quite as good as the moussaka made by my ex-boss who is a Greek Chef.  I will make again and try not to alter the recipe so much and if it is better I will upgrade my rating. All in all this was a good dish, but messes up LOTS of pans. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is pretty good. I did make some changes right out of the gate, but it was to make it to more closely resemble my families recipe (that I cannot find anywhere!! Have to beg my mom for it again)  First and foremost,  I used 2 small eggplant, brushed them with olive oil and broiled them for a few mins each side. I also put in a layer of peeled and med. sliced Yukon gold potato in substitution of some of the eggplant. No need to pre-cook. They will soften in the oven, and absorb all the yummy flavors! Next, I used ground lamb, not beef. I browned it in the skillet, using just it's own juices, not the butter. I drained off half (not all) the juices and added in my garlic and such. Do not omit the nutmeg and the cinnamon! I know this might sound weird, but this, combined with the ground lamb, is essential to the authenticity of this dish. It tastes heavenly! One thing I would suggest too is cutting the portions to 12 or more. Moussaka is SO rich. I usually serve it with a gorgeous Greek salad. Yum yum Yyum!!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!....my family said this was the best tasting thing EVER...COMES OUT PERFECTLY...we will never order moussaka again in a restaurant!!
1. I dipped the eggplant in egg, then in breadcrumbs, sauteed the slices in olive oil, then drained on paper towel.
2. made mine with 2 lbs ground lamb, 2 eggplant...skimmed off grease, added the spices and wine, then simmered 20 mins.  
3. Sliced 2 large UN-peeled potatoes, boiled them till al dente, and used as my bottom layer only. Made a nice firm base for the casserole
4.Bechamel sauce: use whole milk
   * increased by half
   * took off heat when thickened and added 2 egg yolks, stirring gently till incorporated
   * then folded in 2 whipped egg whites
   * folded in the nutmeg instead of
     sprinkling on top 
5. Used Italian seasoning and McCormick "Greek Seasoning" instead of fines seasoning, plus the cinnamon and nutmeg where indicated.

I wish I had baked the eggplant instead of cooking it in olive oil. The eggplant soaked up all the olive oil then rendered it out during cooking. The result? I spent four hours cooking and ended up with a big pan of gross hot oil and a broken sauce. You might have also mentioned that the eggplant should be rinsed after sitting in salt!

For me this was a 2 1/2 hour ordeal so I strongly suggest preparing this dish a day ahead if you're pressed for time. For the eggplant, I lightly sprayed a skillet with cooking spray and browned both sides until the eggplant was pliable but not mushy. It's also key to salt and drain them well to draw out excess water and lessen the bitterness. I nuked 2 potatoes in the microwave, peeled, and sliced into rounds.Then, I added it to the bottom layer.Also, I used 1 whole cinnamon stick broken into thirds instead of ground cinnamon.For the mysterious fines herbs I used dried oregano,thyme,basil,and tarragon to taste. Come to find out, according to Wikipedia, fines herbs consists of PARSLEY, TARRAGON, CHIVES, and CHERVIL. Who knew? I had 85/15 beef, but I still had to drain the fat after browning it.Simmer the sauce until it's the consistency of thick meat sauce for lasagna;not runny sauce for spaghetti. I added about 2/3 cup plain bread crumbs for it to set up for easier serving.The only thing I changed about the bechamel was I quickly whisked in 3 egg yolks to the sauce during the last couple of minutes of cooking.It was the perfect amount of sauce for this dish (that is if you are using a deep dish rectangular pan (I used the aluminum disposable type. This would be too much sauce for a regular 9x13. The bechamel was okay, but I think I will try a cheese bechamel next time.I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed with sauce either.Opa!

Easier and healthier way to cook the egplant: After slicing and salting, brush one side with olive oil, place in Med-HOT pan for 3 min or until lightly browned. Brush other side of eggplant before flipping to brown the other side. As others did, I added a layer of thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom of the baking dish before the eggplant and i'm glad i did. It really gave the dish a nice foundation and additional texture. Perfect amount of sauce which created just the right thickness topping. Used ground buffalo for added flavor. This was delicious! Took much longer to make than 2 hrs... start this in the afternoon for dinner.

This is delicious. I read some of the other reviews and made the following changes:

-- Eggplant -- used just one medium large, rather than 3, because I wanted it to fit in one 13x9 pan, which it did, perfectly. Used the original amount of meat,  tomato sauce, wine, etc.

-- Potato -- added a layer of potato on the bottom for authenticity. Sliced 3 medium potatoes about 1/4" thick, steamed til almost tender and just put them on the bottom.

-- Ground beef - browned this by itself first, drained off fat.

-- Onion -- used just one, sauteed in a little olive oil.

-- Garlic -- used 3 cloves

-- Egg -- meant to put it in the meat sauce but forgot, so just added it to the Bechamel as others suggested -- worked great -- nice slightly custard-y effect

-- Bechamel -- used only about 4 c milk because a) we were almost out of milk! and b) only using one eggplant. Adjusted butter and flour down to accommodate less milk

-- Cinnamon and nutmeg - skipped them out of personal preference

-- Oregano -- added about a teaspoon or so of dried for extra "Greek" flavor

This is definitely a keeper. Not hard, just takes a bit of time -- with 2 people cooking last night it was easy and fun and well worth it.

Great recipe! Only changes were that I broiled the eggplant instead of fried, and added an egg to the béchamel sauce after it thickened. After reading reviews of runny sauce, it could be that you didn't cook the sauce enough before putting it on top, it takes about 5-10 min of stirring after all the milk has been put in to see it really set.
 It does take longer than 45 min, lots of time went to prepping the eggplant, so set aside some time.

This is EXCELLENT!  I made this GLUTEN and YOLK FREE:
1. Do Broil the eggplant rather than frying -it takes too long and the egg plant wants to soak up the oil.  Just brush on top of each slice and flip when golden.
2.Fine herbs is an herb mix -i didn't have everything but I used some crushed Rosemary, basil and a tiny bit of thyme -I don't care for thyme -to replace the fine herbs.
3. 1 clove of ELEPHANT garlic -not sure how that relates since the flavor is mild.
4. Skipped the wine -I don't drink, used water instead.  
5. Bechemel sauce: I used the butter, about 1  to 1.5 cups plain yogurt, 2 egg whites and added more of the nutmeg, cinnamon plus salt and white pepper to the sauce.  No need to cook it.
I then layered it on a dish (just one layer of each) and baked for 1 hour.  It was DELISH!  Next time I think I will cut the butter in the sauce in half -it was tasty but a little much.  YUMMY!  Thank you for this recipe.  It hink I will double this reipe next time since my family ate it all for dinner!
I have since tried it using the fine herbs -no good. I much prefer my method above.  Also half the butter is not as good, maybe you could cut it by 20% but honestly I will just use it all next time

This was delicious! I tried to fry the eggplant but it didn't work well since it is so porous. If you breaded it like when you have Parmesan it might be easier. I baked it instead. I had no breaf but I used lamb, beef, veal meatloaf mix and it was great. I thought it might be too much bechamel at first but it wasn't after all. I halved the recipe and it worked better than it seemed so I made it in a smaller pan. I never had moussaka but I thought it was great and I would definitely make again. I used the same pan for the sauce and the meat and just rinsed in between to cut down on clean up. If you do certain parts at the same time you can drastically cut down on time. For example while the eggplant sits make the meat sauce. Then while the eggplant cooks make the bechamel. The meat will cool enough to add the egg and then everything is ready to be layered.

This! Oh my God! Feeling nostalgic about our recent Grecian honeymoon, I decided to make this on a whim. My husband and I moaned after EVERY bite.  And even though it's a very rich dish I went back for seconds (and he for thirds). I broiled the eggplant instead of fried it. Had to do it in batches, so that took some time.  Two medium eggplants were plenty (sliced 1/4 inch thin on my mandolin). I cut the second and third layers of parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup each, and added a a few tablespoons to the bechamel, as well as 1/4 t nutmeg, still sprinkling some on top at the end. 

The meat filling is so amazing on its own I plan to make it for stuffed peppers and zucchini and who knows what else when I don't have the time to put this full recipe together.  

Also, because I knew it was time consuming I prepared this in stages; I made the meat mixture a day ahead, broiled the eggplant and combined the layers in the morning, and prepared the bechamel 1/2 hour before I was ready to pop it in the oven.  Seemed a little less overwhelming and messy that way.  I will be making this for Christmas this year!

Yummy!  Moussaka is always my “go-to” dish whenever I eat Greek.  I followed the modifications recommended by WSBLEND by adding the extra eggs while making the sauce, not using butter to brown the beef, and using a deeper pan for the baking.  I also added the potatoes because who can say “no” to potatoes?  It was tasty and I was lucky to have some leftovers the next day for lunch…but only because I saved a piece for myself before my guests arrived.

Delicious! I have only made Moussaka once before, but it didn't seem quite right to me, but I found this recipe and thought I'd give it another try. I am very glad that I did. This recipe was amazing! 
I made the meat portion of the recipe the night before, as others suggested, to save on time. Yes, it was very time consuming, yes it was totally worth the time.
I also did as other suggested and added 2 extra eggs (separated and blended in) and I used 2 medium sized eggplants and two potatoes.
For the eggplant, I cut it into rounds and set them out with salt, then I broiled them on each side for about 3 minutes. It worked out wonderfully. The Moussaka was a delight for everyone who ate it.

In case any wants to know how to Scald Milk... it's not necessary anymore as long as your milk is pasteurized... but is the authentic way and does add to the flavor.  

Here you go:
Heat the milk to 180 degrees. At this temperature, the milk should just begin to come to a light froth:  you will see around the edges of the pan, where tiny bubbles will form. This point can be determined visually or with a thermometer and can be done in a double boiler or, if you pay close attention, over direct heat.  You can also scald milk in a glass bowl in your newfangled microwave oven, checking it every 15-20 seconds.
To prevent scorching, be sure to stir the milk as it heats.

This recipe is absolutely delish! I went to Greece on my honeymoon and never had moussaka better than this. The only thing I add is a layer of potatoes on the bottom. They soak up a lot of the juice and are out of this world! Definitely try it, you won't regret it.

Great recipe with all modifications by WSBLEND. A few additional notes to help:  1) Definitely make the meat a day earlier for improved flavor and, more importantly, to simplify prep. If made ahead, warm the meat to make spreading easier and temps more uniform. 2) Definitely layer roasted slices of potatoes on the bottom as WSBLEND suggests. Use 4 medium peeled potatoes.  Use a food processor to slice uniformly if possible. Use nonstick sheet or lightly olive oiled sheet for baking. Salt/pepper the slices lightly before roasting for extra flavor. Overlap potatoes on the bottom of the pan. 3) Definitely use eggs for sauce as WSBLEND suggests. Better flavor and consistency. Three eggs seem to work best. This is the appropriate amount of sauce - do not reduce as some suggest.  4) Use 1.5 lbs of meat for richer composition. With extra meat make sure to increase other ingredients accordingly for bold flavor. 5) No need to use butter for meat. Definitely consider baking the eggplant - much healthier. Bake until top is golden brown. Beautiful! 6) Don't be afraid to make the sauce even with the top of the pan. I didn't have any problem with juices overflowing. 7) Use real grated parm cheese if possible. So much more flavor. 8) Leftovers are even better!

Good. No need to add an egg to the beef mixture, for sure. Red wine- very important, for too much tomato flavor causes the meat part to taste more like bolognese than moussaka. Loved the bechamel sauce, will definitely make this again with lots more of the spices (cinnamon and nutmeg).

Nice and very authentic recipe - good to see a recipe using beef and not lamb - most moussaka recipes seem to suggest lamb - the Greeks rarely use lamb!! Only changes I made were not to fry the aubergine, but to plunge it into rapidly boiling water for one minute. Also I used a combination of 2 aubergine and 4 thinley sliced medium potatoes (which I parboiled for 10 minutes. Nice flavours - will use this again.

I LOVE this recipe, been to Greece a few times and I think this recipe is amongst the best I've tried.  I love rich food and the original recipe is awesome - but for those trying to cut down on the calories or richness: 1) the olive oil can easily be halved when frying eggplant, or elimated altogether in favor of olive oil cooking spray, done under the broiler, 2)the bechamel sauce can also be reduced by at least a third, as there is more than is reasonably required, and 3) the cheese can be cut down to 1 cup total, and any kind of cheese works well, I've tried with Mozz, Cheddar...it's all good! Guaranteed to be a favorite for adults and kids alike.

Wow.  I rarely take the time to review recipes and feel guilty because I rely so heavily on the reviews of others.  This recipe deserved taking the time to review.  We followed a low-fat version and broiled the eggplant after brushing with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and italian seasonings.  We did not use butter to brown the sirloin and added the equivalent of egg beaters instead of a whole egg.  For the bechamel sauce I used 1/2 of the called for butter and actually used Smart Balance (which does excellent as a substitute for most butter recipes).  I used skim milk and added 1/2 cup of fat-free half-n-half.  Otherwise, I made the bechamel exactly the same - no additional eggs.  I also used less than the called for parm cheese but honestly can say we didn't miss it.  This recipe was more than a "keeper".  It is now going to be a part of our regular rotations.

Ten years after having moussaka in Greece for the first time, I finally worked up the courage to make it and it was A HIT!  This recipe was a great base and with all the combined suggestions, it made it perfect. As one person said, it's not a 45 minute recipe. It was a lot of work but well worthwhile. Maybe with practice, it can become a 45 minute prep and an hour bake time.  The amount of sauce was perfect not too much as few said. 

After reading through many reviews, these are the changes as per many reviewers or just because I didn't have something on hand:

- I didn't peel the eggplant
- separated 3 eggs, added yolks to cooled meat filling and beaten egg whites to the bechemel sauce. 
- no red wine in hand so I substituted chicken broth
- omitted the butter altogether
- -omitted the nutmeg on top
- omitted the dried parsley (didn't have any
-used 1/2 a jar of Ragu (that's what I had on hand)
-  added an additional tablespoon of flour
-placed a couple of sliced potatoes on the bottom (peeled, sliced and baked 15 minutes with olive oil)

I'm sure the original recipe was good but this was Delicious nonetheless!

This is so delicious and not difficult to make, just time consuming.  Had moussaka for the first time in Athens, Greece this summer and this recipe is similar to that dish.  I made this recipe for a Greek Night at a friend's house and got rave reviews!

I cut the recipe in half but kept the meat mixture amounts the same, assembling it in a 9 x 9 baking dish.  Upon the suggestions of others here to make it more authentic, I added 1 (15 oz.) can of diced tomatoes (drained) to the meat mixture, and added one tempered egg yolk to the bechamel sauce to make it fluffier.  Excellent flavors.  I will make this again.  Thank you, Peggy, for sharing this very tasy recipe.

Excellent, easy recipe. Tasted wonderful. I didn't add the egg to the meat mixture, because I like the crumbly meat texture...think Greek style sloppy Joe! Enjoy! Oh, and adding some fresh herbs on top, what was put into the meat sauce, gives it a nice finishing. Some cinnamon gives it an aroma to die for!

This tastes almost too good to believe. Even before the bechamel is done, a slice of eggplant wrapped around some of the meat mix is enough to make you want to stop there, and just serve it up.

Here's another way to cook the eggplant. After sweating it, I used a basting brush to brush on a little olive oil before putting it in a medium hot pan. It browned well, cooked quickly and wasn't saturated in oil.

I used 1 1/2 cups of fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned tomato sauce. Instead of dried herbs, I used about a half a bunch of fresh parsley, fresh oregano and fresh thyme. (Thank heavens for those organic "meat mix" and "poultry mix" packages at the grocery store.) And a little more cinnamon than suggested.

The sauce was so good, I'm thinking about making it meatless and freezing it to use as a base in future dishes.

We eat gluten/dairy free. A bechamel made from almond milk and corn starch for the thickener works fine.

Yum! We've made this several times. I agree, add a layer of potatoes with the first layer of eggplant. We have a small family, so we divide this into 3 9X9 casseroles and freeze 2 and cook one.

This is the first time i tried making moussaka and i loved it.  If i would change anything next time, it would be to adjust the spices and herbs and add more but cut back on the nutmeg a little but its all about personal preference i think.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe, but it does need a few revisions.  As previous reviews mentioned, you need to add egg (beat the whites) to both the meat and bechamel scauce. Also, up the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.  That was a good suggestion. The only problem I found was that it came out a little on the runny side.  I think these are the things I should have done: 1. really dry out the eggplant before frying/baking and rather than tomato sauce, I'm going to use a paste next time around.  hope this helps!

This turned out exceptionally well. I added 3 egg yolks, then three beaten egg whites, to the sauce as it cooled. Prep time is significantly greater than 45 minutes. I love the cinnamon/nutmeg undertones.

This was so easy and yummy.  I made a smaller batch, an 8x8 pan size.  Also followed the review that added separated eggs to the white sauce. mmmm.

it is worth every second it takes to make this dish.    The flavor is a party in the mouth.     Will take the suggestion to bake the egg plant the next time to save on calories.    Yummy and thank you!

I've eaten Moussaka in a variety of places (including Greece), but this was my 1st time making my own.  Also my 1st time cooking w eggplant.  This came out surprisingly delicious!  Instead of frying the eggplant, I dabbed olive oil on it w my fingers, then cooked 1/2 the eggplant under the broiler & the baked the other 1/2 (both turned out fine).  My eggplant in the finished product was still slightly bitter; next time I will let it sit longer w more salt to prevent this.  I accidentally left out the egg.. it came out ok, but I can see how the texture would be better w the egg & will make a point to remember next time.  The only changes I made were to add a thin layer of cooked potatoes on the bottom, & upped the garlic to 3 cloves.   The proportions were perfect, including the sauce.  Like another reviewer said, you want a lot of sauce; that's how this dish is supposed to be!  I used a glass baking dish that was the perfect size (even for all that sauce).  The bottom dimensions are 9.25"x13.25", but it flares slightly to 10"x14", & its 2.5" deep.  It says 3L & 3Qt. on the bottom of the pan (it's an Anchor Hocking from a set of 3 I got at Target, with this being the middle-sized pan).  Hope that's helpful to some!

We loved this! I did make a few modifications as per some reviews and was happy with the results. We chose to broil our eggplant instead of frying. Used a teaspoon of olive oil margarine instead of butter when cooking the ground beef. Only had one onion and increased garlic to three cloves. Strained off all the excess fat/grease. Upped the cinnamon to half a teaspoon and used Italian seasoning for the "fines herbs". Replaced the red wine with beef broth. Once again, for the bechamel I used olive oil margarine instead of butter and opted to add the nutmeg directly into the sauce. I also added three egg yolks, and beat the whites until stiff and folded it in once the sauce was done on the stove-top. The eggplant layer was quite thin since we only had two of the three called for; I would definitely use potatoes next time as well since many reviewers claimed that to be authentic. I think the cheese could be left out, but did use a mix of Parmesan & Romano.

I have made this twice, once with bison meat, once with lamb.  Both were delicious!  I love the flavors!  This is a very delicious recipe...the first time I made it I was overwhelmed because of all of the pots going at once (I'm not good at multitasking when I cook!), but I just saved the topping to make once everything else was done.  It is very fast and that way the milk doesn't burn...thought it might help other new cooks to know!  Great recipe!

One of the most delicious dishes I have ever made. Omit half the butter (in sauce) and half the cheese to reduce fat. Sauce ABSOLUTELY needs eggs to thicken it - I added two whole, beaten eggs and it was perfection.

Made this last night - it tasted awesome - almost as good as in Greece!  I would like to make these suggestions:
-Soak the eggplant in salt water for about an hour to get rid of the bitter taste.  
-I microwaved the eggplant until soft to reduce the fat, then drained them on paper towels.

ENJOY!  This was very good!

well... after much anticipation from the great reviews and the wonderful smells as i was cooking my moussaka... i was frankly a bit disappointed.  i found that the bechamel sauce was out of proportion to the rest of the ingredients (too much) and overpowered the taste of the eggplant, meat sauce and cheese.  i may make this again, but would reduce the amount of bechamel sauce by 1/2.

This is my fourth time making moussaka, each time from a different recipe. I altered this one to one eggplant, one zucchini and about 6 small potatoes (parboiled). 

I was confused by the instructions, I didn't know if the eggplant was to be fried in the oil or the butter, but went with the oil and needed a lot more oil than 2 tsps. I also fried the zucchini.

Also, I browned and drained the meat before adding it to the onion, garlic and spices. I didn't omit the butter, but might do that on a second batch.

I didn't know what fine herbs were either, so I substituted italian seasoning and it was fine.

This is a great recipe, but it took nearly every pan I had to cook it! Maybe I need more pans? 

This is a lovely recipe that I will add to my binder!! I was going to rate this a 4 because of the confusion with the directions, but even if confusing, this is a five star recipe!!!

So good!  I used ground lamb instead of beef and added guyere cheese and 2 beaten eggs to the bechamel sauce to thicken.  It was wonderful.  Would add another can of tomato sauce next time.

This moussaka recipe is outstanding! I returned from my first visit to Greece, wanting to share this wonderful traditional dish with my family. I followed the recipe except followed a few reviewers' instructions. 1. I used a lasagna pan, 2. I added 3egg yolks and 3 stiff egg whites to bechamel sauce, 4. I only had one eggplant so for the top layer, I used 2 potatoes, 4. Instead of frying the eggplants and potatoes, I cooked them on the griddle with a little olive oil, 4. I added 1/2 c of feta to the top layer of parmisan cheese.  Next time, I would double the meat to use the lasagna dish... I felt the meat layer was too thin. This was absolute heaven and reflective of my terrific visit to Greece!

This came out really well...it has a different taste with the cinnamon and nutmeg, but it was delicious! I had a lot of eggplant in the garden, so it was perfect to use it up.  I used 3 medium eggplant.  It does take a lot more prep time.  It took me an hour and a half to get it ready for the oven, and I'm an experienced cook! After reading the reviews I mostly stuck to the recipe.  I didn't want to add another 15 minutes and dirty a bowl to beat egg whites.  I used ground beef and ground turkey for the meat (it's what I had.)  I also used the Bechamel sauce recipe without adding any eggs.  I also put an egg wash and breadcrumbs on the eggplant, but I think next time I would just add the cooked eggplant.  I was thinking of grilling it on my George Foreman grill.  I also used my 11 x 13 lasagna pan and it was perfect. (I just realized I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of turkey, so I accidently doubled the meat, but it was fine, without the extra meat it would have fit in a 9 x13 pan.) .  I also let it sit for a half hour out of the oven to set.  Really good and will make again.

Very good!  I made the meat sauce as written.  Cooked the eggplant slices in the oven at 400 for about 40 minutes, until they where soft.  I skipped the bechemel sauce part, just because I was lazy.  So I simply mixed the eggplant in with the meat and it was good!  Thanks for the recipe.

absolutely delicious! it is key to salt and bake the eggplant slices before layering.  otherwise, it will turn out extremely runny.

I enjoyed this Moussaka very much! Trick from the Greek cook (Maria) of my friend in Corfu, fry the eggplant in olive oil and let stand in a colander overnight. Quite a lot of oil will drip out!

Absolutely fantastic. I made this yesterday for dinner and it was practically inhaled. I did add a layer of mandolin-sliced, potatoes to each layer of eggplant and it worked amazingly well (par-boiled sliced for 5 mins first). I think what impressed me the most was how effortless the bechamel sauce was to make - that'll give you a real sense of achievement if, like me, you hadn't made that before.

This is really good, it is like a greek version of shepards pie. I like adding some sliced potatoes...more cinnamon,nutmeg, and some allspice. Oh...no need to fry the meat...lamb is better choice too. I used italian spice for the fine herbs, and used a can of diced tomatoes and even a can of whole tomatoes...italian blends.  The white sauce is pretty good...didn't have white pepper or white wine though it still tasted good. I want to try adding some artichoke hearts along with the eggplant potatoes layers. I also sprinkle parmesean cheese over the meat too..this is good.

It was good, but next time I'm going to put less nutmeg than it says to put - the nutmeg was a bit overpowering, but otherwise I liked it.

Absolutely delicious!  I made a number of changes to the recipe after reading the reviews:   (To the beef mixture) I used 1 big eggplant (not a huge fan of eggplant unless it's super tender) which I cut into 1/2" disks rather than lengthwise; omitted the 1/4 cup olive oil; used 2 lbs of ground beef; 3 cloves of minced garlic; no fines herbs and fresh parsley instead of dried and fresh oregano.  (To the bechamel) After I made the sauce and allowed it to slightly cool, I folded in two egg whites which I first beat until frothy (soft peaks??) which other reviewers had suggested.  I'm SO glad I did because the sauce set up really nicely.  I omitted 1 cup of parmesan cheese as I didn't want this to be a "cheesy" dish and sprinkled 1/2 cup of the cheese between my beef and sauce layers.  Some other things to note: I soaked the eggplant slices in a bowl of liberally salty water until a little tender then broiled it at 450 deg for ~ 5-6 mins (watch it closely; my 1st batch burned!) until tender. The result was that the eggplant ended up melting in with the other ingredients which I personally loved.  Also, as someone suggested, I put the 2nd amount of nutmeg into the sauce instead of on top which alllowed it to meld with the other flavors rather than stand out.    The only thing that I didn't like was how watery it was despite draining off all of the liquid from the meat. This didn't detract from the taste, though!  We LOVED it as did our guests and everyone had 2nds!

This was not only my first time making moussaka it was my first time eating it. I will try baking the eggplant next time. Aside from it taking way longer than the recipe said (again it was my first time) it was very good. Thanks for sharing it with us.

Delicious.  I bought a huge box of eggplant from the farmers market for a rediculously low price(about 40 pounds for $10).  I pickled half of it, like my Italian grandmother used to, and have been looking for recipes for the rest.  We are going around the world with eggplant recipes.  I have made a lovely eggplant parm(Italy), a wonderful eggplant curry(Indian) and last night this Greek Moussaka.  I think this is my favorite so far.  After sweating the eggplant I very very lightly applied some olive oil and put the slices on the grill.  This not only saved me a pan but gave the eggplant a wonderful flavor.  There is just something about grilled eggplant that is just soooo good.  I also used Penzeys greek seasoning instead of the fines herbes and parsley and put a layer of zucchini under the bechemel.  Other than that I left the recipe as it was written.  It was a lot of prep but soooo worth it.   I will definately be making this again but tonight we are off to France for Ratatoulli.

Here is a helpful hint regarding the eggplant absorbing too much oil. If you dip the eggplant into beaten eggs first the oil will not absorb. You can do all of this eggplant in about a half a cup of olive oil and there will be oil left in the pan afterwards.

Very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and made some changes for my personal preference but I think it would be very good just the way it is.  But I like potatoes as the first layer and just boiled up 4 medium baker's the day before and refrigerated them so they were redy to peel and slice when I was assembling the casserole.  I kneaded 1/2 cup flour into the lamb (subsituted for the beef) before frying it and that helped the casserole hold it's shape.  To speed up cooking the egg plant, I made a mixture of half water, half canola oil and salt and pepper.  Then, I dipped the eggplant in it before spreading them out on a large teflon coated baking sheet and baked them at 425 degrees until brown on both sides.  It worked out well.I didn't put any egg in the meat sauce, but gently stirred two beaten eggs into the bechamel sauce at the end.  Also, I put a whole cinnamon stick in the sauce while cooking, and removed it before refrigerating it overnight.

Amazing!  Be aware that this recipe is a lot of work.  I had a lot of balls in the air while I made this one, but my hard work paid off and it was delicious. The moussaka was a little runny at first, but after it sat for a while (maybe 30 minutes) it cohered to itself a little better.  I cut the leftovers into big pieces and froze them individually to bring to work for lunches.  They defrosted and reheated beautifully!

I used minced lamb instead of beef, as I think this is more like the moussaka I have had in Greece, where sheep are eaten rather than cows. I also sliced and lightly salted the aubergine and baked it in the oven without oil for 30 minutes instead of frying it, as this cuts the amount of oil in the recipe. I added slices of part-cooked potato to the base of the dish before adding the meat mixture - this makes the meal go much further, and is how I have eaten moussaka in Greek restaurants. I served it to friends and there was a scramble for second helpings. Their verdict was "The best moussaka we've eaten outside Greece!"

Recipe was great, would give it 5 stars with a few modifications.  Added lamb to the ground beef for a nice rich flavor for the minced meat.  Used 2 crushed garlic cloves instead of 1 and doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Added 2 egg whites to the bechamel sauce to ensure a fluffy top that would brown nicely.  Delicious traditional greek fare, VERY filling.

Just finished eating this and it was delicious!  I followed the advice of others and only made half the bechemel and it was quite sufficient.  Also, I didn't fry the aubergines because I know they soak up a ton of oil and others had spoken of it being too oily - instead I put them under a grill, brushed with oil - worked fine.  Lastly, ran out of parmesan so topped it with cheddar which was very tasty and browned nicely.  The only tip I'd have is wash the aubergines after you've salted them.  I forgot to do this, and the dish was slightly saltier than I might have liked it - but that was my fault.  Cook this recipe, you'll enjoy it.

Fantastic! Was a huge hit here. Only thing to change is the sauce - a little too much is called for in the recipe. So next time perhaps cut the sauce down to half.

Fantastic. I used only two eggplant, and added pine nuts to the meat sauce, and it was a big hit. It is a bit on the oily side as noted by previous reviewers, but dry frying or steaming the eggplant takes care of that. Really nice!

I haven't made moussaka in forever and this recipe was spot on! It's going into my recipe box for sure. I think that next time I will follow as  another post had mentioned and brush the eggplant with olive oil and roast them a bit in the oven while cooking the meat. I cooked the meat without any butter since this dish is so rich.

This is by far the most difficult recipe I have ever attempted. I live in NJ where there are a million Greek Diners that have Moussaka on the menu. The next  time I order this I am personally going into the kitchen and offer the chef my first-born child. WOW. I am an accomplished chef and this was so time-consuming but EXTREMELY worth the effort!!!!!!! I combined two of the recipes - this one and the one for Grilled Eggplant Moussaka as I wanted the potatoes in it and added cinnamon which the other recipe did not. I also added the egg yolks (but not the whites since I am allergic) and this recipe is absolutely scrumptious! Awesomeness! Next, I'm trying the Gyro recipe...

My wife loves Mousaka. I spent time in Cyprus and she had the best Mousaka ever in a small restaurant across the road from our hotel. This recipe comes as close as possible to that experience. I made enough for 6 people using this recipe. But, I did not need three eggplants. I found two medium size were plenty. Get them black, soft and lightweight for the best. I used a thin potato base and roasted the potatoes in the oven with the prepared eggplant - 10 minutes each side at 350. I lightly sprayed with Olive Oil when I first put them in and when I turned them. I used three egg whites in the Bachemal Sauce (which my daughter insists I can, therefore, not call it Bachemal Sauce. I did up the meat sauce the night before and put it in the refrigerator overnight. I mixed in the three egg yolks. I didn't use as much Parmesan as the recipe calls for but did a liberal sprinkling of Parmesan on the meat layer, on the top eggplant layer and the sauce layer. The whole experience took me a good four hours. I am sure it will be quicker the next time but the rave reviews I got was worth the effort. And, in that four hours there was a lot of down time waiting for things to happen. My wife retired from the kitchen last year and handed me the pots and pans for my enjoyment. This recipe just made my reputation.

One medium onion would be fine and I would highly recommend draining your meat and cooking off the wine and tomato sauce until it is a very thick mixture. As for the béchamel sauce, there should have been 1/2 cup of flour rather than 6 Tbl and either cut back on the milk or add the last only if you need it. The sauce was way too thin and I cooked it at boiling for about 15 minutes which should be more than enough time. The pan needs to be at least twice the size. The taste was good but that's about the only positive.

Thanks for the recipe! It really does come out great! I do recommend giving yourself a longer prep and cook time. If you're not and experienced "cook" then somethings are a left to figure out a little. I used just one large onion, 2 eggplants (it just depends how much you'd like) and for the béchamel; I removed it from the heat let it cool slightly and added a whisked egg so that it would hold together a bit better. Other than that, I thought it was pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Cheers!

Awesome takes extra time and some changes.  I pretty much followed this recipe with some changes via post by WSBlend.  I used 2 pounds of meat and added a thin layer of potatoes on the bottom.  Used 3 cloves of garlic, 1 small onion doubled the tomatoe sauce and wine.  Instead of frying the eggplant I lined eggplant slices on cookie sheets lightly oiled and baked 20 mins in oven at 450 covered top with foil.  Same with the 2 sliced russet potatoes but for 10 mins. I used the 2 eggs in meat yolks first and whites beaten and folded in.  This recipe takes much longer to prepare but very much worth the effort.  this was my first time making this I served it to company who had never had it before with rave reviews and they left with the recipe.  Next time I will make it with half lamb and half beef and I may try it with fresh spinach in the meat mixture.  But it is excellent as is.  I highly recommend adding the potatoes!  Yummy!  Oh I also added 1 cup of sauce on top of the first layer of meat and the remaining sauce on top.

This was mediocre at best.  We live near a restaurant that has a fantastic version & this didn't compare.  I followed the recipe almost exactly- except we omitted the wine (didn't have any), and added egg whites to the bachmel sauce like others suggested.  It was also incredibly labor intensive and the time the recipe suggested was off quite a bit.  The 2nd star is there because my entire daycare group ate this & enjoyed it... but it's way too much work for 6 toddlers.  Update:  I've made this a second time & it was still a very labor intensive recipe.  I took it to a pre-school dinner & most that tried it enjoyed it.  I still prefer the restaurant version near us, however IF I had 2 days to make this, I would use this recipe again.... I'm adding more stars.

I have made this twice following most of the other reviews (add potatoes, grill eggplant, omit butter, add eggs to sauce).  It is good, but a little bit bland...even after I increased the seasonings in the meat.  I think next time I will experiment with a different recipe.

This is a lot like the classic recipe in the New York Times cookbook that I have made for ages.  I think using tomato paste instead of sauce is an improvement, and helps the moussaka to stay firmer.  I also used cottage/ricotta cheese folded into the white sauce-I think there is even a Greek fresh cheese that is better.  I added grated Parmesan or Romano- 1 cup.   In Greece, this dish is made in advance, and "sets up", so that it is easy to cut into portions.  There is no need to serve it boiling hot.  You can just rewarm it gently when ready to serve, and there should be no problem. Also - no dried herbs!  Only fresh parsley will work - and some oregano, if you can find it.  I also broil my eggplant - it is healthier, easier, and faster.

My husband and I did not care for this dish.  I have had moussaka at Greek diners before and really liked it, but this one was just mushy.  The texture was weird.  My husband said it was like eating pumpkin pie because of the texture and the taste of cinnamon and nutmeg.

I'm not sure if anyone else had this problem, but my eggplant absorbed the oil like crazy! I went through a lot of oil trying to fry the eggplant, so it ended up coming back out in the baking process, leaving the final dish very loose & oily. I followed the suggestions of adding egg white to the sauce and yokes to the meat but it still wasn't firm enough. On the upside, the taste was very good. I will try making this again, but will brush the outside of the eggplant with oil and prebake them instead of frying. I love the taste, so i'm going for it again!!

wow! i didnt have enough eggplant so subbed the rest w/ potatoes. i took the advice of the reviewers and roasted the eggplant and potatoes at 475 for 15 mins. i also added the yolk to the meat sauce and the white to the white sauce.i used all the nutmeg and cinnamon called for. it made a little too much white sauce for me. next time i will decrease it a bit and layer it in.i cant wait to make this again w/ more potatoes! i made this the day before and served it w/ cucumber couscous salad.

I made this recipe last night and it got rave reviews. I grew up with Greek grandparents and I admit that I liked this moussaka even better than the ones my grandma made.
I broiled the sliced eggplants at low temperature but otherwise followed the recipe.

Thanks so much for sharing it!

this was exceptional, well worth the effort, the only thing I did different was increase the garlic, and no "fines herbs" as I found too many definitions for this. I added lots of fresh parsley to the meat when it cooled and a little more on top of the bechamel. I will try with gournd lamb next time...

This was absolutely excellent. My first time making moussaka, but not my last. I followed the directions exactly except lessening the cinnamon and nutmeg just a tinge. I was afraid of it overpowering all my hard work, but it would be fine to use the amount listed – it’s not much after all. Thanks for the terrific keeper Peggy!

I am not the most experienced cook so this took a fair bit longer to pepare, especially because I had never cooked with eggplant before. I live with two men in their mid twenties and they both screwed up their nose when they saw me buying the eggplant at the store.  However they both went back for seconds and both took left overs to work. Thank you for such a brilliant recipe, they think I am a genious!

Better than my local restaurant!!!  I also added potato slices and used Chinese Five Spice (which contains cinnamon and nutmeg).  The meat sauce is EXCELLENT.  It was a bit time consuming, but I felt like a real "chef" while preparing it and the end result was wonderful.  Even better reheated the next day!  I will make this again and again...

I needed more oil since the eggplant soaked up a lot of it.  

Making the bechemel takes patience.  It takes a long time to thicken.  Maybe some corn starch would help?

Very tasty all in all.  Try sprinkling in some saffron at the end.

this was excellent! i used the meatless ground beef instead of real ground beef and added 3 eggs to the beschemel. lessened the amount of butter and dry fried the eggplant. maybe i'll try it with real meat next time, but it was so good with the fake stuff!

This is a nice "change of pace" dish. I omitted the "fines herbs" since I wasn't sure what that was! The nutmeg & cinnamon gives it a pleasant, distinct flavor and I liked it with the meat. (I think we used a little more nutmeg than the recipe called for however).  My 5 year old didn't like it, but my husband did.

We thought this was terrific!  My neighbor, the source of the fresh eggplant, was so impressed I sent her the recipe and she's been making it to freeze for future pleasure.  I didn't read the reviews before making it the first time, so it was a bit greasy.  But dry-frying the eggplant in a non-stick pan and draining the beef before adding the seasonings made it better.  Also, I substituted "Cavenders' Greek Seasoning" for the fines herbs and it was great!  Will definately make again and again!

I took a few liberties but it came out great. It is very rich but make it and enjoy. 

The pervious reviewers noted that it was a bit greesey, this is most likely due to the meat (try extra lean ground) AND the sauce. It appears as if the oil comes out of the butter as the sauce is cooked. 

There was one note about needing all of the eggplant. I would tend to agree. I used 2 and it was good but 3 would have been better. 

I added ~3/4 cup of feta cheese. This worked out since I had a larger pan and it added a nice flavor. 

Cooking the eggplant takes quite a while. I used a regular pan. This forced me to use some oil and cleaning the pan afterwards is a pain because the oil cooks on after that much time. Be sure to use a non-stick pan and cook the eggplant dry.

Excellent!!  Made as written with only addition being sliced Yukon gold potatoes with each layer of the eggplant.  Used Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning in place of the non-descript, "fine herbs."  Really great-tasting moussaka!!

Frustrated that this took 4 hours but it was delicious. 
To help anyone trying this for the first time:
1. Give yourself time! And prep all ingredients because there is a ton! 
2. Eggplant: 'm glad I had 3 eggplants because I baked/broiled 1 as per reviewers comments and we hated it. In the end I pan fried 1&1/2 large egg plant ( no salt or sitting just straight in the pan) and placed it on 2 sheets of paper towel then 15 min later flipped them onto 2 new sheets. (They absorb the oil and you'll want to get that out but the flavour is great) 
3. Add 1 potato sliced to this recipe. Gives it a base and some structure. I sliced 1 medium red potato (skin on) and covered the bottom of the 9x13 pan (I used a dark metal pan covered in foil). Make Sure they are not overlapping. Spray with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Bake in the oven on 400 for about 15min if you cut thick pieces. 
4. Lamb or beef is great here but depending on the type of meat you'll want to brown it in olive oil and discard some of the juices. Then add onions & garlic (I used 3 large cloves). Cook till onions get a bit soft and aromatic then add the wine and spices. Simmer till it's a bit thick. I used a cast iron pan and 20 mins was perfect. 
5. Eggs! So the first time I made this I used 5 eggs by accident- 2 in the beef & 3 in the bechamel.. It was fine but I recommend adding 2 yolks to your beef mixture (once it has cooled) and 3 whites to the bechamel. This makes it light but is totally optional if you like

Yum! I listened to the reviews and added eggs to the béchamel sauce, and used oregano/basil/thyme for fine herbs. Cut down on the butter everywhere I could. I am pretty certain I messed up the béchamel sauce. You really do have to pay attention, which doesn't happen with 2 toddlers running loose. But, it baked up fine. Tasted great, thank you for sharing!

The best, the very BEST moussaka, that I have ever eaten! I thought 4 eggplants would be too much but it wasn't. I found it is also important to let the dish sit for 30 minutes after taking it out of the over to let everything firm up. We loved this recipe and will absolutely make it again.

Excellent flavour! Don't cut out the nutmeg or cinnamon! I used garden fresh tomato sauce and a nice red wine with the addition of a bit of mint from the garden. Only downside was that I had a bit too much meat and bechamel sauce that went to waste so as to not overflow the pan. Mine was rather runny, though exceptionally tasty, upon first cutting into it so I would wait a good half hour for cooling to solidify it.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did have to substitute ground lamb for the ground beef due to a food intolerance, but this came out fantastically.  Will make this again without hesitation (and I HIGHLY recommend this with lamb!).

Sadly though, I can confirm, due to experimentation by a dining companion that this is also fantastic with tortilla chips...

Thank you for this recipe for a dish that was really popular in the 1960s and needs to be revived.  I had continued to make it, but modernized it by microwaving the egg plant (5 minutes). I use fresh tomatoes when possible - two are enough.  I have always topped the dish with a cup of Greek yoghurt rather than bechamel.  I add a couple of eggs to the yoghurt, and it is probably good to whip the eggwhites though I never used to. I do not use any cheese - it is not necessary. I always use ground lamb for a more authentic flavor.  You can also use left-over lamb roast if you chop it fairly small - it's a delicious option for leftovers! This dish can be very healthy and low fat (just omit the egg yolks).

I was very worried to make this dish because I have never liked eggplant, but I received one in my CSA share and decided to give it a try. What a nice surprise! I didn't just swallow it down, I actually liked it! It has a really nice flavor, and the eggplant blends in. The kids weren't crazy about the bechamel sauce, but didn't complain about the eggplant. I will make this again for company I think. This time I cut the recipe in half and it fit nicely in a small oblong dish. I made the recipe as directed except without adding any butter to the ground beef mixture. I also forgot to scald the milk first for the bechamel. It took forever to thicken (more than 20 minutes?) and I had to add an extra TBL of flour, but it eventually did thicken. I served this with a simple side salad of tomato and cucumber slices drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and topped with feta cheese.

The taste was great, but didn't keep the form once I cut it... but that's my own fault because I put too much sauce in the meat...I used Barilla pasta sauce (garlic and roasted tomato) since I didn't have tomato sauce. I did go quite generous with cinnamon and nutmeg. 
I had already sliced the eggplants thin before I looked at the recipe (I was originally planning to make something else but I changed my mind) but I think it worked out anyways. I like the idea of potatoes on the bottom. I will try it next time. I was just wondering how I can make the Bechamel sauce more healthier... I felt much resistance using 1/2 cup of butter but I didn't want to mess with it too much, I was already using 3 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup half and half. I wonder if I can sub the butter with something else... I may try the egg yolk and egg white next time. I didn't use butter for the meat sauce. 
I did pour olive oil on bottom of the pan and spread it with paper towel prior to laying the eggplants. In the recipe it says to heat "the olive oil" for frying the eggplant... so olive oil is not a mystery I guess... 
I didn't have "fines herb" so I just used tumeric and marjoram. 
The taste was just wonderful and my 3 yr old daughter loved it too!! 
I will keep practicing to perfect this recipe!! 
Thank you for the great recipe (I know I changed a lot of minor things but definitely gave me a good foundation, and reviews were very helpful as well!) !!

Excellent! I was cooking for a large group, so I doubled the recipe and  added 3 eggs to the sauce. I added extra cinnamon to the meat and a tsp of sugar. I'm not a fan of nutmeg , so I used some allspice instead of the nutmeg, it was incredible! Also, don't forget to rinse the salt off the eggplant and give them a squeeze, they turn out perfect! I also  parboiled some Yukon gold potatoes in chicken broth and sliced them 1/8 " thick and made that my first layer as others suggested to make it more authentic. Give yourself some extra time to make it, it's well worth the effort!. My favorite moussaka recipe yet! No need to look further! Thx!   -Peachymojito

This dish was delicious! I hadn't made moussaka in years, could not find the recipe I had used and found this one. This dish is very involved and requires use of several pots and dishes. it took most of the afternoon to complete. In the future I will make the meat mixture the day before as was suggested previously. I used the suggestions of others: roasted eggplant in oven, did not use butter to brown the ground meat, used a layer of golden potatoes, also roasted in oven about 15 minutes, for the first layer. For the meat I used a pound of lean ground beef and ground pork (my family does not like lamb). I served this with sour dough dinner rolls, a salad with strawberries, goat cheese, toasted walnuts, with poppy seed dressing, and of course dessert. It was a big hit! Rebecca

Substitute parmesan for kefalotiri if you're able to find it. Will really dramatically improve the recipe. Instead of the bechamel sauce, I used the kefalotiri to make a cheese sauce. I would only recommend doing this if you really like cheesy dishes.

Dairy free version: I used full fat cashew cream and coconut milk instead of milk.  I did add potato slices on the bottom and three eggs to the bechamel sauce.  It reheated in the microwave very well.

This tasted absolutely DELICIOUS!!! I love moussaka, and I decided to challenge myself with this recipe. The flavors were absolutely heavenly, but the texture of mine was a little off -- hence only 4 stars. I made it exactly as prepared. It did NOT take only 45 minutes to prepare. Also, it took at least 75 minutes to cook properly. The beschamel wasn't nearly as solid as I would have liked. The extra eggs that reviewers mentioned would have probably helped. Also, I agree that baking the eggplants would have yielded a better, faster, healthier result. It was still a total hit at my dinner party, but I wish it was less mushy.

Very good and easy enough. I made one of these that you were to bake the eggplant pieces that had been dipped in egg and Italian bread crumbs prior to assembling. More work but it had a bit more character to it. I used a lot more cheese (Italian blend) just because I had so much on hand and wanted to use it but really liked it that way. Totally forgot the egg, didn't seem to miss it.

I’ve had moussaka before in restaurants and this isn’t quite what I remember.  Maybe it comes down to the brand of red wine, mix of seasonings, or maybe it’s because traditional Greek  moussaka is made with lamb and not beef.   Really wanted to like this one.

Lesson learned-always read reviews from the lowest ratings up. I would have known that this would turn out to be a soupy mess. I actually told my husband I thought it was too much sauce when I was preparing it , why didn't I trust my instincts?

SO worth the time and dirtying up some dishes (that's what a dish washer is for, people!).  Athens is our favorite city and this recipe brings us back to our fond memories of Greece.  Will make this often!

I made this recipe for guests the other night- it was a hit! I followed the recipe to the T, but followed the advice of some by adding an egg to the bechamel sauce, on top of the one in the meat mixture. It held nicely. I think the only thing I will do different for next time is use canned / diced tomatos that I will drain. Simply delicious!

Good recipe. nice find. 
Would work as written but these were my mods: I only had two eggplants & I messed-up part of one with my roasting method so in the end I had enough for an 8x8 pan but it turned out great.  I tried to roast the eggplant & it mostly worked but I burnt one of them to the pan (not recipes fault & roasting works fine so I'll do that again next time.) 
For my reduced volume I used 3/4 lb ground beef and I used McCormick's "Greek seasoning" as my fine herbs. Neither my husband nor I like a heavy cinnamon/nutmeg taste so I used just a dash of each in the meat & none at the end. It looked like a high ratio of onions as I was cutting them so I only added about 1 medium white onion. (At the end I realize that 2 onions as originally recommended would've been appropriate, so again, follow the recipe.)  No other mods, except I only used about 1/2-3/4 of the bechamel. (remember I had a smaller pan.)  I think my meat & bechamel might've been a little thicker than it would've been otherwise but I wouldn't have changed anything. 
The recipe refrigerated well & actually "set" overnight so that the form (even after reheating) & flavors were better the next day. 
The wine is essential don't leave it out. 
Thanks for the recipe.

Last night was my first attempt at making Greek food.  I picked this recipe because it looked good, sounded good and easy and I had all the ingredients on hand, but one the fines herbs.  I just added a little tarragon and sage (a suggestion I found online).  My husband absolutely loved it.  He said it was the best thing I had ever made.  I love to try new recipes. We had it with Riunite Lambrusco Emilia.  It was the perfect wine with this dish.  I give it 5 stars plus!

Really disappointed with the results. Followed recipe exactly and it ended up being a goopy, oily mess with way too much sauce sitting on top. If I even bother to try it again, I would make half of the sauce or less, but I doubt I'll give this a second chance. Waste of alot of time and money, basically inedible.

added the extra eggs to the béchamel only I thought it was actually too much. I let the sauce reduce quite a bit and then stirring in the egg really thickened it too much. I also used zucchini instead of eggplant since the other "hates" eggplant, and lamb instead of beef. In the future, I would use a smaller pan and make it thicker. I think my lasagna pan was too spread out. Also put sweet potatoes on the bottom (precook at 450 for 20 mins in oo) but in the future I would leave them out. It was just too much flavor mixing. Will try with just plain potatoes before completely throwing this idea out.

Very flavorful. The preparation time is way off the mark. Make the day before or start at lunchtime if you want this for dinner. I took some suggestions from the reviews, including adding sliced roasted potatoes to the bottom of the dish (I've always had it that way) and adding the eggs to the bechamel. Next time, I won't add the eggs. The crust was puffy and eggy, but the sauce didn't settle into the top eggplant layer, leaving it rather dry. That was not in the original recipe and I can't fault it, so 5 stars it is! Excellent. I am bringing this to feed a crowd for Greek night. Opa!

Ok, prep time was WAY longer than 45 minutes. We normally eat a late dinner, but I started this at 7:30 and didn't pull it out of the oven until 11. Needless to say, we ordered pizza and had this for dinner the following night. I popped it back in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes, until the sauce was bubbly. It was really good! DH liked it better than I did, but I think that's because I was bitter about the cooking time ;-) I did add a layer of potatoes to the bottom, but otherwise I didn't change anything. Because of the prep time, I probably won't be making this again for awhile.

We loved it!  In fact, I liked it better than what I have eaten in some restaurants.  Did make a couple of recommended changes - did not fry eggplant, put a thin layer of potatoes on bottom and used less butter.  We are actually looking forward to leftovers!

Fantastic, I had no idea what Mousakka was or was supposed to taste like, but my husband and I loved it.  I have now started using the meat sauce in my lasaugna.---

I followed others peoples advice to half the cinnomon and nutmeg, and use an 1/8 tsp each of oregano, basil, and thyme for the fine herbs.

---No need for the butter with the beef.  I used cooking spray instead of 1/2 cup oil on the egg plant to cut calories.---

I used 3 eggs separated in the white sauce.  Added egg yolks to the pot once thickened, and beat the egg whites until soft peaks formed and folded into the sauce.   It really does make it fluffy.  Next time I will probably half the white sauce, as we found it a bit to much, and another way to cut the calories in the dish. (Do use 1 egg in the meat sauce).---

Oh ya, this dish seemed to take forever to make, I was in the kitchen an hour and a half before I got it in the oven, so if you plan ahead, I would make the meat sauce ahead of time, like the day before.  Maybe I'm just a slow cook too ;P

This is my first time making moussaka. I broiled the eggplant, then chopped them up. Used less butter and a bit more beef.  It was a little too runny for my liking, and the bechamel sauce needed more thickening. I do like it, tho. I served it with a greek pasta salad.

Went to Greece on hour honeymoon and ate Moussaka like it was going out of style. I've been searching for a recipe that is as good as we remember & this is pretty great. I did bake the eggplant and baked/added a layer of potato too before putting it all together in the oven. I also added 2 egg yolks and one stiff egg white to the white sauce (came out AWESOME). BTW, this makes the perfect amount of white sauce, not too much at all. This dish IS labor intensive, but it's worth it!

Found this recipe when looking for alternatives to eggplant parmesan. This was a very tasty dish. I added three whipped egg whites to the bechamel sauce and it turned out just right. As with others I also baked the egg plant till it was just softened and used fat free milk in the bechamel sauce to make this dish a bit healthier. I added a layer of thinly sliced roasted potatoes to the bottom, which added a welcomed flavor/texture to the mix. I think the second layer of eggplant is unnecessary, one layer each works just fine, slices nicely and holds together well. My wife and daughter (age 1) both enjoyed the dish, it was the first time each of us had eaten moussaka.  I will likely make this dish again, good way to use up egg plant from the garden.

This dish is certainly missing something.  I could not even get though one piece without feeling sick.  I am pretty sure if you like Moussaka this is a great recipe, but with never having it before, I did not really know what to expect.  I think it needs some crunch to it, or something firmer in it.  I might be good mixed in some macaroni or something. On a good crusty bread even.   Some aspects of this dish were awesome.  The meat was excellent and the eggplant I absolutely  loved ( I really like eggplant).  WAYYYY to much sauce.  If you cut it in half... that is how much I use in a whole vegetable lasagna. Also, it took way too long to make.  Three hours!!!

Really tasty and very fancy recipe that I made for company. There were 4 of us and there was plenty for dinner for two the next day plus my husband took some to work for lunch.   I took the advice of whipping egg whites into the sauce and adding the yolks with the milk. I did not find that I had too much sauce. The dish came out a bit on the runny side the day it was made (it solidified in the fridge overnight) because I didn't get the chance to salt and dry out the eggplant before browning it. That's probably also why it required a bit more oil to brown in the pan. I'd like to try baking it next time. It didn't really have any negative effect on the taste though! Yum!

Well, this was my first time ever making Moussaka, so I followed the written recipe. It had a nice taste, I wish, though, that they told you to drain the meat after browning because the end result turned out quite greasy. Maybe that is supposed to be a given, but again, first time making it - so I followed the recipe to a tee! Next time I'll read the reviews before attempting it again.

Very good recipe!!!!!! My husband requested this for his birthday dinner.  Although it is time consuming, well worth it!  Next time I would just put the eggplant in the oven as others have suggested.  Highly recommend!!

This was very tasty and unique and I will definitely make it again. It turned out pretty soggy, though, and I think I would use only about half the bechamel sauce. Also, make sure to cut the eggplant slices pretty thick because after roasting them (or frying, as the recipe originally calls for), and then baking them in the casserole they will be cooked down to a pretty mushy state.

I was feeling adventurous when I decided to make this. The texture was great and the hint of nutmeg & cinnimon made the dish interesting in a good way. Took a little more effort than usual, but it was worth it.

This is an excellent recipe for moussaka.  The only thing I do differently is to bake the eggplant in the oven.  This was a hit when I served it at a dinner party.

Delicious!  I have made this recipe a few times and it is delicious!  I broiled the eggplant and took others' advice to fold in 3 egg whites beaten to stiff peaks.  Cut out a lot of the butter (none in meat, 1/2 the amount in the bechamel sauce).  I love it!

This was a very tasty dish.  The only changes that I might make next time are the addition of a can of diced tomatos and maybe a bit more parm cheese, but other than that, it's really good.

Thank you for adding this recipe. It was incredible. I've never cooked eggplant in any shape or form, but wanted to try this dish and it was well worth the time and effort. Next time it should not take as long now that I've prepared it once. Thanks again, even my picky son loved it.

I made this last night for Hubby & I. I did as others suggested and broiled the eggplant, did not brown the hamburger in butter; I upped the garlic and used 3 eggs. Everything else was as the recipe stated. I used 3 MED sized eggplants and my onions were a MED. size also. I only say this as I was unsure as to what sizes to use & it was PERFECT! I used a pan that was 8X12 BUT is 4" deep. This made a lot & next time I make it for just the two of us I will cut it in half. As others have said this is company good. I assure you I will make this again. It was better than you would get in a Restaurant! ****I have made this a few times now. Love it even more!****

I dirtied every pot in the kitchen making this, and it took a few hours, but SO worth it.  I loved it and am making it again today with the gorgeous eggplant I got in my CSA box this week.

Just sooooo good! Really authentic. The down side is that is took me 2 hours to prep and then another hour to cook. So have lunch then make it for dinner. I think I would make it healthier next time by baking the eggplant, draining the meat and adding less butter. Alot of oil is on the dish. Before I tasted it I said I am never making this again/too much work. Now that I'm eating it. Have to make it again!!!

You really should change the beef to lamb-only about 5 bucks a pound and the flavor change is worth it. Adding the extra garlic is a good choice too... A really fun edit to this dish is to slice the egg plant the short way so you get disks of the vegetable and then compile the whole dish in extra-big muffin tins. Two tins of 6 cups each uses the all the ingredients perfectly, fill all the way to the top with the bachemel and bake for about 40 minutes at same temp. REALLY great for dinner parties.

This turned out really bad for me, but maybe it was my fault and so I'm still awarding 3 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was perfect for moussaka, but the texture was awful.  The eggplant was overdone to the point of total mushiness, disintegrating completely into a slimey pile on everyone's plate.  Maybe I cooked the eggplant too long in the first step when trying to brown it?

Lots of work, messy, but really very good.  I followed suggestions and used 3 eggs plus 2 egg whites in sauce.  I also added a little more cinnamon than recommended.  I broiled the eggplant in the oven and it came out great.

First off, I have NEVER had Moussaka. This recipe was very good if you are in an eggplant mood. Next time, I'll have to bake the eggplant because frying it did not turn out so good. Also, it took about 4 hours from start to actual eating so next time I have to start cooking earlier. ***COOKING NOTE*** I used Domaine Evharis, Ilaros, Regional Red Dry Wine of Gerania, 2006, Product of Greece.

Chop the eggplant and roast with olive oil in oven.  Add three egg yolks to the topping.  Whip the egg whites and fold into topping.  Bake as normal.

I never made Moussaka before and it turned out great, everyone loved it, tasted very similar to the Greek Restaurant I go to, if not better. I did follow the advice of many of the previous reviewers, by broiling the eggplant, using very little olive oil, and adding feta cheese in addition to the parmesean, and itlaian season for the fine herbs.

Excellent!  My 5-year-old son had been wanting something with eggplant in it, so I fixed this for him.  He LOVED it, and so did I.  I did divide the recipe in half because it makes sooooo much, but I still put it in a 9x13 pan.  Delicious.

I broiled the eggplant slices for about 8 minutes instead of frying.  I also didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I used half a jar of pasta sauce (7-herb variety), and it turned out great.  I'm not sure what the traditional way of serving moussaka is, but I served it over white rice, and it was excellent.

This was great.  Use lamb instead of beef for more authentic flavor.  I doubled the spices, including the garlic, and baked, instead of fried, the eggplant, as other reviewers suggested.  Makes a lot of bechamel sauce, OK with me.

This was my first attempt at moussaka and it turned out delicious! I forgot to add the egg to the meat mixture, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Adding the wine to the meat sauce is key. I will definitely be making this again!

excellent recipe..
i would add a little more eggplant to the recipe though
i made a few substitutions since some ingredients were not easily available...instead of red wine..i added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar into 1/2 cup of instant chicken broth...also instead of parmesan-i added cheddar cheese
the end result was awesome...
every1 really enjoyed it-will def be making it again...

A little time-consuming, but worth it! I made a few changes based on what was on hand: I used 2 large eggplants (4.5 lbs total) and, as another reviewer suggested, brushed them with oil and baked at 450. I didn't have any wine so I added a large tomato (chopped). I didn't have enough milk so I made up a quart of powdered milk and added 3/4 cup of regular milk. Even with my substitutions the flavor was great! I wouldn't recommend cutting into it right after it's out of the oven - it was a soupy mess for me. After refrigerating the leftovers in the fridge overnight, I was able to cut out the traditional square and it retained its shape when I  reheated it in the microwave. I probably should have let it set and cool a bit before serving it. Will definitely made again.

This is totally worth the work that goes into making it!  I'd eaten moussaka on a trip to Greece and was skeptical of my ability to reproduce this tasty dish.  But this recipe did the trick.  I broiled the eggplant instead of frying, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  We'll definitely be making this again!

This is a popular Egyptian dish, I have made it a few times for my husband and a few of his egyptian friends.  They all said it is even better than what they have eaten in Egypt.  I make my bachamel sauce a little bit different, I dont scald the milk first  and I add 2 teaspoons of thyme and a beaten egg in the last minute of cooking.  This is a great recipe!

Wonderful tasting recipe, but it was swimming in olive oil. I would not change a single thing as the flavors were just right, but next time I'll try brushing the eggplant with the olive oil and broiling each side as suggested by others. Very delicious!

I see that i'm in the minority in that I didn't LOVE this recipe, but sorry, I didn't.  First of all, it took WAY longer than 45 mins to make it.  Secondly, let me straighten out the confusion re the browning the meat in the butter.  The 1T butter is for browning the meat; the 1/2C butter is for the Bechamel sauce.  I didn't read it carefully and although I couldn't imagine why, I used 1/2C to brown the meat. I did catch my mistake later and was able to drain my meat well.  My problems with this receipe are:  WAY TOO MUCH nutmeg... leave it off the top of the bechamel sauce.  That was the main taste of the meal and 1/2 hour later that's STILL what i'm tasting. Also, too much bechamel!  If I were to make it again (I won't) I'd make all the bechamel but I'd watch carefully when pouring it on..maybe cut out a third.  Oh, it did smell fantastic when it was cooking, though!

This recipe was confusing.  Where does the first listing for 1/2 cup butter come in?  When do I combine the butter and milk in the bechamel sauce?  I am not a gourmet cook - maybe that is the problem.  A lot of work for a so-so result.

Really great recipe Peggy, I recently came back from Greece and wanted a recipe that tasted authentic, the only thing I added when I cooked it a second time was a thin layer of par boiled potato on top of the beef mixture. Delicious.....

This was my first time making moussaka, and it was a total success.. it was so unbelievably good and authentic-tasting!  Totally worth the long prep/cook time.  I used 2 eggplants instead of 3, substituted a good bit of fresh flat parsley, plus oregano for the fines herbs and only made 1/2 the bechamel sauce (didn't have enough milk on hand) and it was fabulous.  Don't bother trying to make this low-fat.. just add the butter, oil and milk and indulge!!

I cooked this again last night and realized again how wonderful this dish is.  I do not fry the eggplant - I slice it and bake it on a cookie sheet lightly oiled with olive oil.  I also exchange the wine for more tomato sauce.I separate 3 eggs, beat the yolks and add slowly to the mixture, then fold in the beaten whites.  The little hint of nutmeg/cinnamon is what really makes this zing.

Thank you, Peggy!  I always order Moussaka in Greek restaurants but had dismissed the option of cooking it at home.  This dish turned out wonderful - and although takes a bit of prep time - was SO worth it.  Followed the recipe exactly except:  1) Cooked Eggplant without any oil (was afraid that they would taste funny as they looked burnt after being cooked, but were fine), and 2) substituted equal parts of oregeno, basil, & thyme for fine herb mixture.  Also only had 2 eggplants around but it was enough (although 3 is probably a more appropriate amount).  If you like Moussaka, you MUST try this recipe!

Good taste, but very greasy, even after broiling eggplants.  Extra cheese always a plus though!

We just got back from Greece and wanted to try this recipe.  I am a beginner and it took a long to prepare but it was worth it.  I navigated the Béchamel and was proud of the outcome.  My wife also gives it 5 stars  (which is all that counts)!

OMG!!!  I have never made Moussaka before and this was the best that any of us had ever eaten...  I made it in pieces.. First the meat mixture and later that day the (broiled) eggplant... made the bechamel just before baking... I followed the recipe exactly except for a few tips that I got from other reviews... 3 egg yolks in the cooled bechamel and folded in the whipped egg whites, at the very end.. I added the seasoning (salt, white pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg to the bechamel while thickening..I also added 2 thinly sliced potatoes to the bottom of pan... 

This was fantastic!!  Holy cow!!  Will definitely make it again!!!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe and tastes great.  I used only 2 eggplants, and that was plenty, also just sprayed the eggplant with olive oil and baked at 350 F for about 15 minutes instead of sautéing.  I didn't have fines herbes so used tarragon and chives along with the parsley.  I think I forgot the egg but the recipe didn't suffer.  Will make this again.

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out wonderfully. I did add some sliced potatoes (boiled for 5 min in salted water) and a layer of eggplant also between the meat and bechamel sauce. I also added the egg whites to the bechamel and it came out lovely and browned and delicious!  I made most of it ahead the night before, assembled it and kept it in the fridge so the night of the party I only had to make the bechamel and pop it in the oven.  Wonderful flavour and everyone loved it!

The taste was good. I used freshly ground super lean lamb.  I sautéed the onion and added the spices for two minutes after the onion was sufficiently clear. I added lots of garlic then added the meat.  I made the casserole in a 9"x13" pan and it was too thin. I will use a 9x9 next time. 
I didn't stiffen the egg whites, but I will next time as the sauce was not fluffy. I added the cheese to the sauce after adding the egg. Scalding the milk was a great idea as it speeded up the cooking time.  This was just the perfect amount of sauce to go on top in my view. I just wish it was fluffier rather than creamy. I also did not fry the eggplant, I broiled it.  This was less work and with a coat of olive oil it did the job well.
Next time I will make the meat the day before as it didn't absorb the flavours I was hoping for.  My family of 4 liked it and it is very filling.  A side of salad greens is sufficient.  We have plenty of leftovers for lunches.   It wasn't like they make it at my favourite Greek restaurant in the city, but it was a good first attempt.  I think the sauce adjustments will improve it.

I'm using this recipe as a guideline to build on since we can't eat tomatoes or onions (replaced them with red bell pepper and celery).  I'll leave the butter out of the meat and make 1/2 the white sauce since I want to keep the butter to a minimum. The proportions of the dish do seem off to me (heavy on eggplant and bechamel) but that depends on your druthers.  Don't be afraid to play with this recipe to make it what you want.

Ever since I tried the moussaka that they make at restaurants I have been wanting to make my own moussaka.  I made some for my family and I and everybody loved it.  I especially liked how I learned more about cooking and some special terms.  Overall, making moussaka was a wonderful experience.

Absolutely fantastic! My whole family loved it. I changed only 2 things: I used vegetarian ground round instead of beef and I didn't use any butter to brown it.

This was my first time cooking Greek food.  I followed some other suggestions and added some whipped egg whites to the sauce.  Please note that this took much longer than 45 minutes to prepare.  I was fortunate to have help and it still took almost an hour and a half.  The dish turned out fantastic but I doubt I will make again just because of the complexity.  Obviously that is not a fault of the recipe just the nature of the dish.

It took me a lot longer to make than 1&1/2 hours. The recipe does not allow for the sauce to cool before you add egg to it. I made the version with eggs added to the two sauces

I made this; I started the day before because I know how long it takes to make (time consuming recipes stress me out); I have not been in Greece but I'm from the Balkan region and have not seen this recipe made with the béchamel sauce. I also have used ground pork because I get sick smelling the ground beef cooking. Much less fat if you get your hands on some lean pork. Anyway, I also use potato (2) and ended up using 2 eggplants not three. The potatoes give the dish a "comfort food" taste and feel. Make sure you salt this dish properly because the meat and eggplants absorb a lot of it. Still I didn't use cinn/nutmeg.

It was rediculously yummy. My dad makes this same recipe so I knew it was good. The only things I changed were instead of nutmeg I just added extra cinnamon, but that's my preference. The other thing is that I added some crumbled feta underneath the bechamel sauce and it added that extra greek touch.

3 hours of work for basically inedible ground beef soup. Of all my years of cooking, this is the only utter failure I've experienced. The eggplant sucked up all the oil only to expel it later. The sauce ended up separating, leaving a lake of butter/oil/grease floating on top (and I had drained the ground beef too!!). Utter drek, never again. Someday I will go to Greek restaurant and see what this is supposed to be like, because this surely can't be it.

After travelling to Greece, we were pleased to find this great recipe so we could reproduce our daughter's favorite Greek dish at home!

Just as good as what we had in Greece & better than the local restaurants!
We took other reviewers tips & use all 3 eggs in the bechamel & this turns out perfect every time!  We like it better than lasagna!

This was really good! I made it for my husband after we went to a local Greek festival and had some moussaka there. This recipe was just as delicious as the one we had at the festival. Maybe even better!

Made this the other day.....so good!  I used Italian seasoning instead of the fines herbs and left out the nutmeg.  I did not add any extra egg whites to the sauce....mine did not run.  Instead of the fresh eggplant, I used a bag of Trader Joe's frozen grilled eggplant and zucchini (rinsed off the marinade and patted it with paper towels).  I will make this again!

Very good recipe. It reminded of a Greek place I used to go to when I was in Australia. Really authentic  flavors (besides the ground beef but still excellent). I did follow others advise with adding two egg yolks to the meat as it cooled and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also layered the bottom with 3 potatoes (sliced) and also baked the eggplants and potatoes in oven. I added beaten egg whites to the white sauce and it fluffed up beautifully. I might add another pound of ground lamb next time. This is definitely a time consuming prep meal, so make sure you take enough time out . Worth trying for sure!!!

Loved all the flavors but had some trouble with the recipe steps. 

I followed the suggestions by WSBLEND for the white sauce.  Mine still did not rise as much as I would have like but the flavors were great.  It was very soupy but we just dished it out and ate it anyway.

I served this dish to my Greek husband, his brother and my parents. Everyone really loved it and my brother-in-law even enjoyed cold leftovers the following morning! I followed all the modifications suggested by other reviewers ie. grill the aubergines, add an extra egg, make sauce day before etc. My husband rated this 6/10 for authenticity as he could tell the aubergines and potatoes hadn't been fried. I am scoring it 4/5 as I found the bottom of the pan was a bit soggy and the slices didn't hold together firmly. I will definitely make this dish again but I will try frying the aubergines to see if it tastes more authentic.

Soo good and authentic!  I really miss Greek Town in Chicago and this is just as good as good as my favorite restaurant's moussaka.  I did incorporate 2 eggs to the bechamel sauce as other reviewers suggested and it worked out nicely.  I also added a thin layer of sliced potatoes to the pan 1st

Recipe is easy to follow and makes a great moussaka.  I added a little extra cinnamon and made a little extra bechamel for the top.  First time making moussaka and must say it is a great dish for a larger group.

First - I don't understand the posts about adding the egg to the sauce.  It's supposed to go into the meat - when/where/how do you add egg to the sauce, and what is it supposed to do if you add that?  Puff up or something?

Okay...strike one - this dish could have been an utter disaster.  I sliced eggplant thin - and was baking it as some recommended.  Unfortunately, my thin, delicate slices stuck to the pan (yes, I had oiled them), and then ended up crisping too much (I forgot them...duh).  So I sliced up potatoes instead.  I knew some versions (and some mentioned here) that you also use potatoes.

Strike 2 - I didn't realize until too late, I had no parmesan cheese.  Used mozzarella instead.

Strike 3 - what is "fines seasoning?"  I used Italian.

With all that being said.........my kids LOVED it.  My daughter wants to take some for lunch tomorrow.  

I will try again with proper ingredients next time, and probably add more tomato sauce and wine to the meat (I may have had more than one pound, and it was kind of dry by the time it simmered down).  

YUM!

Love this recipe!  I normally compile a few recipes from this site, and tweak and play with ingredients, but this was the first Moussaka recipe I found. I looked it all over, and decided to try as (almost) is, with the addition of a few egg yolks to the bechamel.  Thanks for this, and thanks for making my life easy.  Great recipe, it turned out just like what I was picturing in my head, when I got in the mood for a good Moussaka.

My family loved this dish I did change a few things I used hunts chunky garden spaghetti sauce, 2 pounds of ground turkey one large eggplant and I used motzerella for the sauce I started with margerine and flour added garlic powder and nutmeng,salt and pepper and skim milk. Thanks for the recipe my husband got scared when he saw the eggplant but he loved it . I gave it four stars because I changed the recipe.

Too much work for such a disappointing recipe. I had to bake this for about 3 hours because the top was sooo runny. Maybe I did something wrong, however...save your $$ and spend it in a Greek Restaurant..(I have not found an expensve Greek Restaurant yet)....By the time you make this..you would already be home from the restaurant with zero dishes to wash... If ever I was to make this...I would go back to my old recipe which is not on this web site.

Nice recipe for Moussaka - not nearly as convoluted as many I've seen. I increased the garlic 3x and the other herbs about 2x. Really tasty, but much too oily. Would give it 4.5 stars as presented. Next time - and there *WILL* be a next time, I'm going to try nuking the eggplant to soften then a quick broiling in oven before assembling the dish - the idea being to bring out the flavor but avoid the oil. Will also reduce the butter by about half and bring the total garlic up to 4x the original.  Thanks for sharing, Peggy!

I used potatoes in addition to the eggplant.  I found that the dish was too salty, but they could be because of a number of reasons - my tomato sauce was salty or I put too much salt in. The cream sauce was clumpy with flour (I probably didn't mix it in very well). Also, it was too cheesy for my liking, I prefer mozzarella over Parmesan so the taste was a little too strong.

This was a great recipe and a bit adventurous for us.  We give it a 5 star but we tailored it a bit.  We ended up doubling parmesan using ground turkey instead of beef.  Highly recommended

Good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and I did not have great quality ingredients at hand but it still came out very nice. I will make it again following the reviewers' suggestions.

Great recipe! My husband didn't even know what "moussaka" was, but he gobbled it right up! I followed others suggestions and added two egg yolks to the bechamel, whipped the two egg whites and then folded them in. Great casserole alternative!

We loved this recipe. We had recently been to Athens and the food was wonderful, so thought if they can do it so can I!! I did play a bit with recipe, I cut eggplant diameter way instead of length ways, recipe calls for 3 eggplants...this is deceiving as you can get different sizes..I used 1 large eggplant this is more then enough. I didn't put in olive oil either, to cut fat I just put in oven under grill, works just as well. REd wine is somthing I would never have in my house as we do not drink, so I used half welchs grape juice and red vinegar.  When I made the sauce (who scalds milk now days!! not me) I do melt marg/butter then remove from heat and let cool a bit and add flour VERY SLOWLY while whisking it can and will cook and you end up a very ugly lumpy mess..I don't heat milk, I add a bit at a time and return to heat on low, keep whisking til it starts to thicken, I removed it from the heat after about 5 or 6 mins and let cool...it then completely starts to thicken then, don't panic if you boil forever and it doesn't thicken, it will after you take off heat. the sauce makes perfect amount..if you have too much, your pan is too small! It is a bit time consuming, but worth it, there is enough for my husband and I for 3 meals, so I usually freeze it after first time or 2nd left overs..serve with greek salad and fresh bread..yummy

The flavour of the meat was really good but the bechamel did not set at all. The size of the casserole dish was much too small so I used one that was 8 by 8 but much taller. That could be part of the reason the bechamel didn't set. Once one slice was out the bechamel just ran into the corner. I might trying adding eggs to the bechamel if I attempt this recipe again. Is that what makes it fluffy? The flavor was still good but definitely not great for company.

This was absolutely delicious.  I forgot to add the beaten egg to the meat mixture, but it turned out fine.  I didn't have the fines herbs, so I added some oregano and rosemary.  The only red wine I had available was a fairly sweet dessert wine, but it turned out fine.  I think it would have been even better with a dryer vino.

YUMMY! I've been craving for moussaka for so long and this recipe is almost perfect. The only modifications I felt that were necessary for me was to double the amount of tomato sauce and add in a  a couple of teaspoons of tomato paste onto the ground beef sauce and half a teaspoon of sugar. Also, i agree with others that placing the eggplant in the oven would be better so that the eggplant wouldn't be mushy and have a nice texture to it. Also, I think that the eggplant is just as nice even when it is not peeled and the skin was left alone. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

As soon as my boyfriend took a bite, he told me we had to make this again.  I baked the eggplant and added a layer of thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom of the casserole.  I used thyme and oregano as my "fine herbs."  I also added two eggs to the bechamel; the yolks I added directly after it had cooled a bit, and I beat the whites lightly and folded them in.  I forgot the parmesan cheese until the very end, so it just got sprinkled on top.  Still yummy!

Loved it!  Made a few changes to make it "lower carb".  Used heavy cream instead of milk, and used a low carb bake mix instead of flour.  I did, however, add potatoes for the bottom layer, but cut really thinly; I only used 1.5 med potatoes.  I love Greek food.  Thanks for this recipe.

This recipe is identical to one in a Greek cookbook I've had for years. I have made it several times now, and wonder why it has so much liquid in it when cut into. I used eggplant that had been salted and set to dry between tea towels for a couple of hours, then they were broiled. What I had left were slices that were paper thin (no water left!), yet still there was much liquid. At our favorite Greek diner, it never looks that wet, but the flavor is very comparable and good.

My first Moussaka was stunning thanks to this recipe. I impressed my guests!
I especially like the cinnamon taste in the tomato sauce.

I made this recipe for dinner with a friend and she got hooked on all things eggplant as a result. The flavor was perfect, much like moussaka I've had at Greek restaurants, but it came out a little runny. I will let the eggplant drain longer next time. The yolks in the bachamel sauce were a good idea, as was cutting out the butter. Make sure you give yourself a lot of time for this recipe. It's worth it!

I had never tried Moussaka before, and even though this is a very time consuming dish, it is now one of my favorites! To cut down on time, I took other reviewers' advice and broiled the eggplant. I had so many slices that it took several batches and was more time consuming that if I would have fried it. I couldn't find fines herbs at the supermarket, so used oregano, basil & thyme. I also added 3 egg whites to the bechamel sauce.

This recipe is a good start if you don't mind making a few common sense changes.(like cutting the bachamel in half)  But if you're a follow the recipe exactly kind of person, you should find another recipe!

Made it last night - my first time to make moussaka - this recipe was very time-consuming (definitely longer than what was indicated) and did use a lot of pans.  The bechamel sauce quantity was too much but the consistency was perfect (not too thin nor too thick) - therefore it did sort of drown out the flavours of the meat and eggplant, so I'll reduce the amount next time.  The taste of the cooked parmesan cheese inbetween the layers and on top was great.  However as the amount of salt was not specified, I was too cautious with it, and it came out not salty enough.  Next time I will use a more concentrated tomato sauce and add a bit more wine when simmering the beef, as well as a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg  to give it more taste and a tangy flavour.  Overall, I thought it needed more flavour and salt, but my picky Mediterranean ex-fiance loved it !  In any case it was a fun experience.  Will make it again, but will start early - practice makes perfect ... and makes faster too !

Not much information on how thick the sauce is supposed to be. Fun to make and even better to eat. Its Moussaka not Moose Ka Ka.

Using suggestions to reduce fat and separate egg whites and yolks, this was a big hit at our church "International Dinner". Thank you. Wonderful flavors. I used a French herb combination that included lavender for the "fine herbs" . Very nice.

Took a little bit of time to make, but it's worth the effort!  Really a very savory dish that we couldn't get enough of.

Lots of ingredients, but don't be discouraged.  White sauce and other flavors tasted like yia yia's.  Forgot to add the egg, so meat didn't cake up, but overall taste just like it should.  Don't skimp on the eggplant!  (Made it without the wine.)

My husband and I do not like eating Moussaka in our favorite Greek resturant, but we both enjoyed this dish. Next time I will try using less oil with the eggplant as the dish came out a little greasy. It still tasted great however, and all of it was gone within a couple days.

Wonderful recipe just like my grandmother used to make.  I did add in ricotta and whipped the egg whites before adding to the sauce, as suggested.  It was quite messy but totally worth it.  This definitely tastes better the next day, too.

This was great, and did NOT last long. It made a huge pan, and I had hardly any leftovers. I am a vegetarian, so I substituted TVP (texturized veggie protien) for the ground beef, and next time I think I will use the fake frozen ground beef. I will definitly be making this again!

This recipe sure is a nice one.  It makes eggplant edible for me and went quite well with a tossed salad on the side.  I made it for company and everyone wanted seconds!  The only thing I did differently is I used less butter than called for in the recipe.

This is Wonderful!  My husband who is not a big vegetable man ate two portions!  I skipped the browning of the eggplant and just put in pan raw and added about 1/3 lb of ground lamb to the beef.  I made this for just the two of us and am going to try freezing leftovers!!

This was awesome!  The only bad thing I have to say about this is, it wasn't pretty plating it.  It did not stay layered as I thought it was, but that could have been my fault.  I did not use 3 eggplants, instead I added some potatoes & zucchini.  I eliminated all other fat for cooking as I grilled all my veggies.  Instead of fine herbs, I used as the other reviewer stated 1 tsp. each oregano, basil & thyme.  To the meat I added an additional 14.5 can diced tomatoes.  Instead of all Parmesan cheese, I added some feta also.  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!!!!

A very authentic Moussaka - I did not find it oily at all because I did not use butter to brown the lamb, I also drained the grease from the pan before adding it to the rest of the recipe.  I used zuchini the next time I made it, since I dont really like eggplant.

Very good, original taste, and easy to make.
Tends to be too oily: substituting a little bit of olive oil to the butter proposed for the browning the beef helps to solve this problem.
Seems very difficult to prepare in 45 minutes.  I take 1h30.
Requires many skillets and saucepans.  Or be prepared to temporarily store parts of the dish in a couple of bowls.
I suggest adding cinammon and nutmeg to your taste, just before simmering the beef.

This sounded so good but I had no eggplant and just macaroni...So I made the red sauce using ground lamb,1 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp more cinnamon, only one onion, mixed it with cooked macaroni and 1 to 1 1/2 cup grated parmesean in a dish..covered and baked at 325 for 35 minutes..My family loved it...Thanks!
Easy and Awesome!

This is excellent - I have never cooked moussaka before, and wasn't sure about how it might come out, but it was a hit.  I dry-sauteed the eggplant in a non-stick wok, and it was fine; although next time I will cook the eggplant longer, since some of the thicker pieces were slightly undercooked.
I also used the suggested herbs as a substitute for fines herbs with no problems.  I made the mistake of ignoring the other warnings about the amount of time and work this requires, and it made for a late - (but much appreciated!) dinner.

Thank You, Peggy. Am not much of a cook, (in my mother's opinion, but then again who is) but I made your recipe and it was a hit. I had some trouble with the eggplant but i figure it out. I didn't used fines herb instead I used basil, parsely and thyme and the flavor was phenomenal!
Also, I used a vegetable spread instead of butter and the consistency remain the same. If you're like me wanting to impress a mother chef go for it this the dish to do that with!!!

An excellent, recipe - I found it pretty easy. Try grilling the eggplant to reduce grease, about 5 minutes each side. Also try with ground lamb for a more authentic taste.

Delicious!  Prepared this recipe for my wife and two daughters and drew rave reviews.
I followed the recipe almost exactly - I did not have any "fines herbs" and also added 
a bit (1/2 C) of Feta cheese.  
Took a couple of hours to complete the dish.  Next time, I'll double the recipe and 
try freezing some.

There is far too much grease in this recipe.  I was able to cut the grease considerably by not sauteeing the eggplant in oil, but simply dry sauteeing.  Without the grease, it is very tasty.  I made the recipe twice. The first time as written, the second time modified.  My family loves moussaka and I was happy to find a recipe to work from.  Thankyou.

Very similar to what we had in Greece.  A little time consuming, as you have to cook eggplant separately, but sure worth it.  Great for big group dinner and party.

I’ve made this a bunch of times pretty much as written. One huge hack and great timesaver: buy frozen pre-breaded eggplant slices. I get it at Trader Joe’s and 2 boxes is the perfect amount. Cuts about an hour of time (and lot of mess) from this “project” recipe and tastes great!

I have made this dish 2 times, we enjoyed this dish very much. the first time I made this dish as instructed, I found the dish retained too much oil & béchamel sauce too loose after cooking. the second time , I did not fry the eggplant I cooked them in the over , coat lightly w/olive. oil if you cook them on a sheet pan turn them over . the béchamel sauce I added a little more flour to make a tighter sauce, after the adjustment I though the dish was excellent.

I think this recipe could be a lot better. Loved the suggestion of the potatoes, I only had one in the fridge but even just that one potato made a difference in the dish, the stiff peaked egg whites are definitely a must. I still struggled with overcooking the eggplant, I wish someone would give an exact time they are supposed to roast in the oven, super easy to overcook them. I hope someone posts a better recipe for this dish, honestly really like it it's just hard for me to make properly.

This was so good! I followed the advice in the most helpful review about baking the eggplant. I also omitted the entire egg. It came out perfect and everyone loved it.

Loved this.. Even the kids loved it.  We don't drink or use alcohol in our cooking so I substituted with a little bit of apple cider vinegar.  The eggplants I drizzled a bit of olive oil on and then airfried them in my air fryer.   The eggs I omitted.  This turned out sooo delicious! A great way to get kids to eat vegetables.

I love moussaka and this was delicious. I did use a layer of potato at the bottom and added the eggs to the bechamel sauce as others have suggested. I might increase the spices to the meat a little next time, but I will definitely be making again.

I added a layer of thinly-sliced potatoes on top of the meat mixture. My biggest problem was the bechamel sauce was way too thin, not sure what I did wrong. Everything ran after letting it sit for 15 minutes.

I'll never make it again although it tasted quite nice.  Considering that such things as the Fines Herbs need to be made by hand, the time estimate was way off.  Likewise, the type of eggplant should have been mentioned, as it appears that in the video it was not the the common kind of eggplant locally grown.
Delicious, but If we ever have it again, it will be at a restaurant.

I have never made moussaka before and I  like to follow recipes to the letter frist time around.  I did that and it turned out amazing!!  I think it helped that I used eggplant fresh from my son's garden.  This was so impressive , I  will make this again for a dinner party or family gathering.  Thank you so much!!

I had a disastrous time with the bechamel sauce! Way to thick and pasty.
I topped it with mashed potatoes instead in an attempt to salvage the tragedy. 

There was just too much prep in total for myself.  
This dish just wasn't for me so that's why there's the lower rating.
Eggplant seemed greasy, but everything smells yummy, and the dish looks pretty overall.

It took me a lot longer to make than the directions indicated, but it was worth it. My husband had never had it before and was quite skeptical until he tasted it - then he had two servings!

The recipe is easy to follow. It was just as good as the best moussaka that I ate in Greece, rich and full of flavour. The dish also freezes very well.

I forgot to add the beaten egg to the meat.  I’m not sure what difference it made but it was so delicious.  My hubby had two helpings and even my 7 year old declared she loved it.  A new family favourite for sure.

Takes some time but well worth it! I only used one eggplant and then added some thinly sliced potato as well. Switched to ground lamb since it’s my husband’s favorite and that seemed more Greek to me. In a convection oven took about 45 minutes. I only added the cheese on the top for the last couple of minutes. I don’t much like lamb or eggplant and yet I wanted seconds of this! Great recipe!

Talk about comfort food! Such a great recipe, I sliced the eggplant really thin with my mandoline, used a few more sprinkles of nutmeg, and because I have some gluten free family members, I used 3 tablespoons of corn starch instead of flour for bechemel , those were the only changes. It is a wonderful recipe and will definitely make again!

This is my go-to recipe for Moussaka.  Today we’re snowed in and I made it from my pantry.  I didn’t  have  ground beef, and no Parmesan cheese.  So I substituted ground lamb and goat

I made this recipe and the spices were so delicious -but I added and 8 oz tomato sauce simply because I had about 1 +1/4 lbs of ground beef and I made too many potatoes-the family loved it and I will make this recipe again-it turned out perfect!

Used Greek Moussaka seasoning from Greece, baked the eggplant slices rather than frying them (2 medium eggplants) and added 1 egg to meat mixture and 2 eggs to bechamel sauce - delish!

Update: Made it again changing the bechamel sauce a bit: used allspice instead of nutmeg (all I had),  a bay leaf and 1 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese and three eggs. So good!

I followed the recipe, kind of.  I always tend to add more spices than they state in the recipe and I also used the eggs in the bechamel.  The taste of the meat mixture was spot on with what I remembered eating at my favorite Greek restaurant in Houston.   I now live in the Ozarks and Greek restaurants are pretty hard to find around here, so I have to learn to make my favorites myself.  I did also use the potato in the bottom and I put a layer on the top instead of the eggplant.  The bechamel didn't rise like I hoped it would but I think that was my fault.  I added the whipped egg whites while it was probably still too warm.  The layers held up and it did look and taste wonderful!  I do not understand the reason for cooking the eggplant and the potatoes before assembly though.  They will both cook while the Moussaka is baking for an hour.  I had both, cooked and uncooked potatoes and eggplant in this one and by the end, everything was cooked, so don't see the reason for doing it beforehand.

I used turkey hamburger with little butter & olive oil.  Sauté 1 large onion & garlics  x4, then added meat and drained grease, Very important.  
For the bechamel sauce I used almond vanilla milk.  And don’t forget to slice Yukon potatoes to place on bottom of pan.  This adds texture & the flavors mix into the taters. :). Next time I will try lamb.  All & all this recipe was great!!!  I just love mousaka & now I know how to make!  God bless....

The eggplant really soaks up the olive oil. I would bake or broil them if i made it again. The hamburger needs to be drained very well before adding the spices. Mine came out with 1/4 of grease/oil in the bottom of the dish. Aside from the fact i did not like the taste of eggplant, i just did not like this dish.

I used 2 good size eggplants.  They do vary quite a bit in size but I found 2 large ones to be perfect.    I used ground lamb because that’s the way I grew up with moussaka.  The recipe and seasonings were perfect.  Everyone enjoyed it.  
As said before,  be sure to use a deep 9x13 pan.  Mine was filled to the top!  It’s a keeper for our family!

The recipe came out very good  but next time I’ll make two changes. I’ll add a little more egg to the meat sauce and will cook the eggplant in the oven to keep them more solid.

Never had it before so I can’t compare, but it’s my mom’s favorite dish. She moved to a town a few years ago that doesn’t have a restaurant that serves it. I’m in town visiting and decided to make it for her, following one of the suggestions for baking instead of frying the eggplant and adding an extra egg. Amazing! I’ll definitely make this again!

Subbed out wheat flower for arrowroot due to gluten intolerance.  Equals the best mousaka I've eaten in authentic Greek restaurants.

I will make this again....even though it was "labor intensive".  I'll have to read the reviews and see if there is a quicker way to "fry" the eggplant.  That seemed to take forever!

Forgot to mention I only cooked it for 50 minutes which was about 5 minutes too much as it was more browned than I like.

My granddaughter went to Europe and this was her favorite dish on her whole trip so we had to find a recipe so we turned to Allrecipes and found this to match the best.  We used grilling zucchini instead of eggplant and it worked great. We followed suggestions from reviewers and put a layer of sliced roasted potatoes down for the first layer followed by zucchini, meat mixture, Parmesan cheese, zucchini, bechamel sauce. We also took the advice about using 3 eggs in our moussaka. We incorporated the egg yolks in our cooled meat mixture and beat the egg whites until stiff and incorporated that into our cooled bechamel sauce. We baked it for one hour and then broiled it for 2 minutes to brown a little. Garnished with shredded fresh basil. My granddaughter said we nailed it. It did take several hours to make and bake but so good and fun to make. We will keep this in our recipe box forever. I made fresh focaccia bread to go with this and a nice Greek red wine that she bought on her trip finished our gourmet Greek meal.

Very Good!!!  Like some I had a hard time with the size of the  9 x 13.  It just wasn't enough and had both bechamal and eggplant leftover - no biggie.   Many people reviewed saying they left the 6 Tablespoons out of the meat mixture - read carefully, it says 1 Tbs in the meat mixture and the 6 Tbs is in the bechamal.  This is a fatty dish so if you cut out things you will not get the same effect as a true Greek restaurant.  I used the right amount of butter and cream instead of milk and it tasted just like real Greek cuisine!!  e?p???t????

The flavor was fine, but the bechamel topping was not what I wanted it to be.  The moussaka and toppying were soupy.  After I ate the disappointing results, I pulled out another cook book and looked at a recipe I'd used in the past to make moussaka.  My cookbook recipe had a bechamel sauce in which 4 beaten eggs are tempered into it prior to baking, which bakes up into a  firm topping as the picture for this recipe shows.  I recommend this recipe for flavor, but the texture is not typical of most moussakas -- soupy.  Add 4 eggs or so to the bechamel sauce prior to baking and the results will be more typical.

Delicious. The only adjustment I made is I added a half cup of ricotta to the bechamel instead of the egg. Perfect.

It was AMAZING and my very Greek friend applauded my efforts. My autistic son has to be reminded to take bites as we eat, not with this dish! He quickly was ready for seconds! I followed the advice of the top rated commenter with adding the two yolks and two beaten egg whites to the bechamel and it was perfect.

Amazingly tasting moussaka, even got compliments from the Greek friend! Not being Greek myself this was quite flattering. First time making it, it took quite a while to have it ready, around 3,5 hours from start to finish, but it was worth it in the end. I would probably reduce fat next time I make it and improve bechamel sauce.

Brush the Eggplant with olive oil and sear in the pan. Do not fry in olive oil because it just soaks up all of the oil.

Great recipe, but you need much more than one 9x13 inch pan to hold everything. I had to use an *additional* 9x9 inch pan to hold everything.

This had a very good flavor, but next time would take some of the reviewers suggestions. I made this as written, but next time my changes would be to broil the eggplant (frying in the olive oil made it way to greasy), and I would add two eggs to the white sauce. I didn’t add the eggs, and it never formed up. The time table is way longer than indicated. It took me a good three hours. Also needs to test at least 30 minutes out of the oven.

This is the version that is closest to what I make from being taught in Syria  - and it is delicious. I highly recommend using fresh parsley as opposed to dried as it imparts more flavor to the meat, as well as gives it a fresh herbal appeal, and I personally prefer to use the wonderful spice baharat (instead of the French herbs) for the meat (it is sweet with just a little kick) with a pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes. Adding heat to the meat  brings a delightful contrast to the sweet flavors of the bechamel  spices. I must say, it is delicious either way, but if you have access to middle eastern spices - try the baharat version as well!

I used ground lamb just because I thought it was the right meat for moussaka. Based on reading the reviews I went with 2 regular eggplant and broiled in oven (but not long enough to make the slices mushy) after brushing with olive oil on top side. Used 2 eggs: beat the yolks and add to the meat sauce after it had cooled for about 10 minutes and beaten whites folded into béchamel sauce both after it had cooled to some degree. I found an hour and a half prep (but I had the eggplant prepared for broiling in advance).  All in all it was a great looking meal but I did find it could have used a little more salt (I tried to be cautious with it) and the béchamel didn’t set so I put it back in the oven for an extra half hour.  I did use skim milk and think I could have cut back by half a cup to a cup and obtained a better consistency.  Also, the eggplant was still fairly firm which wasn't necessarily a bad thing but I think because I sliced it a bit too thick in some cases.  This is my daughter's favourite meal.

I tweaked it for Chicken.
Diced the Eggplant into 1.5" -  0.5" strings,
Used a very lightly coated medium-hot iron pan for browning,
{skips the oil removal step}
Added Rosemary, Thyme, Cumin & Ginger [tiny amounts], 
Chopped Tomatoes,
Feta Cheese, 
[a recommended Wine substitute] (thekitchn.com/simple-nonalcoholic-substitutes-for-red-and-white-wine-tips-from-the-kitchn-184394)

Allow the mixture to "reduce" before placing in baking pan too.
**********
My Husband's heritage includes Spain, Native Mexican Indian & mine includes France & Greece. Thus the "tweaks"...lol.

Allow the mixture to "rest" from the oven so it will firm-up for easier [prettier...lol] serving.

Allow any leftovers to cool well, so that condensation makes it all soggy. 

We LOVED it!

I made as is and we didn;t love it.  It is more complicated that it needs to be and honestly it lacks flavor.  When i was in greece i had this dish and it had way more pronounced flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also the dish was super greasy!

We liked this but I did make changes following some of the suggestions in the reviews regarding adding eggs, etc. I did omit the cinnamon because I forgot to add it and used my own homemade marinara sauce in place of tomato sauce as I make a simple base recipe so it can be used in most all recipes.  I did add a layer of 1/4" sliced potatoes that I boiled in heavily salted water for 5 minutes, no more. Left skin on.  We felt it helped make it a heartier dish & I've seen recipes (one my Melissa D'arabian, food network) that used potatoes.  I added the nutmeg as we like the flavor.  It's only two of us and I got two dinners out if it plus a lunch.  My husband works 12 hr shifts so he's a heart eater!!.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe & review suggestions! Both helped me make a recipe we enjoyed.  By the way, it was my first time making moussaka and I didn't feel it took that much time for this type of dish.

This was tasty, though a bit of effort.  I made minor changes, I used Chinese eggplant and I added oregano to the sauce instead of parsley. It came out really well.  Next time I might drain the eggplant longer.

Good recipe but it is vague. The eggplant size should be specified. I used large eggplant and ended up having enough to make two pans worth.  The 13x19 pan should be deep and the bechemel should be really thick on top. It took me over three hours to make it, browning the eggplant took a long time even in a large skillet because the recipe says to cut it length wise meaning I could only brown three pieces at a time. I agree with others that the meat needs to be drained. And 6 tablespoons of flour was too little. My whole dish ended up very soupy. I made modifications before baking the second pan and it came out perfectly.

I was looking for a recipe for eggplant, having gotten tired of the usual parm or breadcrumb ideas.  I don't think this is a true moussaka (no potato, no lamb), but it serves very well as an eggplant dish.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and whipped the egg whites and folded them into the bechamel, into which I had incorporated the yolks.  Made for a yummy topping.  Next time I think I will omit the sausage and add the potato, to have a nice meat-less meal.  BTW, the cinnamon and nutmeg lend themselves well to this dish.  Thanks for posting!

I made this recipe for my family because I got eggplant in my vegetable delivery and needed to cook it in a way that my picky eaters would like.  My husband does not like eggplant at all and he went back for seconds.  I loved it, and my 7 year old ate it without complaining.  

I did make a few alternations based on other reviews.  I baked the eggplant in the oven instead of frying.  I also added two stiffened egg whites to the béchamel. I went a little heavy on the cinnamon.  I used my own homemade sauce instead of an 8oz can.  And lastly, I added sliced potatoes to the bottom of the pan.  I can't wait for leftovers!

One of the reviews noted that it was a pretty involved recipe and took a long time to make.  I didn't think it took all that much longer than it takes me to make lasagna.

This was very good and easy to make. I grilled eggplant and I used cornstarch instead of flour to make it gluten free. I also have made it with grilled zucchini instead of eggplant. I had a lot of both vegetables from my garden, so sometimes I used both! To make it even healthier, you can use ground turkey instead of beef.

Needed to make a few modifications, but was delicious. I added a layer of sliced potatoes at the bottom and brushed with oil then baked the vegetables. There is no need to fry and use so much oil. I also used a bit of sugar to balance the acidity of tomatoes that were added. The volume of cream is perfect, you need a thick layer.

I made this recipe yesterday exactly as directed, except I had to omit the chervil (part of the "fine herbs") as I could not find it.  It was edible, but not tasty (very strange taste to all of us) , and my family has requested that I not make it again.  It was a TON of work to make and so very disappointing.

I made this per instructions...and then I followed some of the comments for the bechamel sauce....Before I started the sauce I separated 3 eggs.  While the milk was boiling I used a stand mixer to whip the egg whites into stiff peaks, then set aside.  I whisked the butter and flour in the sauce pan, added the milk...took off the heat, and whisked in the 3 egg yolks. finally whisked in the stiff egg whites (lightly), poured over the layers of eggplant, meat, (and I added sliced potato) and baked.  Everyone loved it!

Good recipe and really helpful reviews.   I baked the eggplant on a sheet pan after tossing with chopped garlic and evoo.  Added a layer of sliced parboiled potatoes as a base layer.  As far as the meat sauce some reviewers thought was runny, an old Betty Crocker intl cookbook recipe says to add 2/3 c of Parmesan cheese and 1/3c of breadcrumbs, as well as 1 beaten egg (which I did) and that did the trick.  I happen to love a nice high layer of custardy bechamel to cut the richness of the dish. I have found the key to making bechamel is to wait until the butter and flour go back to a thin consistency and then add the hot milk.  I bake the dish at 375 since my oven is electric and doesn't seem to hold an even temp.
This is a dish that really tastes best the day after it is made.

Pretty sure this recipe is missing a step, there should be eggs added to the bechamel! I only used half the sauce  and it was plenty.... it was already a hot runny mess. Had i added eggs to it, it would have  firmed and been a nice crust and i would have used full amount. The eggplant can definitely be roasted,  not only to cut  calories but for the ease of it.  Looking forward to trying again.

Followed the recipe exactly. The meat mix was very tasty. The bechamel sauce was very thin-so I added more thickener which was lucky as the whole dish turned  out extremely liquidy anyway.
It was not even close to done at one hour. So I cooked it another 45 minutes, and then browned it under the broiler.
The overall takeaway by the family was that it has potential but was blah and like an amorphous mass as the recipe stands.

Great recipe.

I used a pound each of ground chicken and ground lamb. This recipe has a nice spice blend. I added tomato paste instead of an egg. And made my bechamel to my desired thickness..

I made this as written, except I doubled the amount of cinnamon and I also used soy milk for the bechamel sauce, which needed a tbs more flour to thicken the mixture.  I didn't have fines herbs so I just used tarragon instead and it was fine. Oh, and I also added an extra egg to firm up the meat mixture.  It's important to drain the meat when it cools, otherwise your moussaka will not keep its shape when served. 

This recipe is so easy and absolutely delicious!  It looks and tastes far more complicated than it is. I will definitely make this a family staple.

I used a mix of lamb and beef and left out the fine herb (since I didn't have any at home). Can't say that I've had mousakka at a restaurant before but the dish was delish :)

Made this today with eggplant I had had prepped and frozen a while back. (I lightly bread and pan fry the slices after the salt soak, then freeze)
Changes I made- used a can of FIRE ROASTED DICED TOMATOES instead of tomato sauce and skipped the wine bc I didn't feel like opening a bottle and I'm saving what I have for something later this week. Personal preference- when I had this in Greece, there were CHUNKS of tomatoes.
Used LAMB instead of ground beef for authentic flavor, but at $10 a pound for lamb, ground beef will be fine!
BECHAMEL- I made 1.5 times this recipe, because I LOVE bechamel :-) I did not use all the milk because the sauce was at the consistency I wanted- it was thick but still poured. I like the sauce to work a little into the nooks and crannies, but mostly stay on top. I had reached the point where the roux was no longer thickening the sauce to where I wanted it, so I stopped.
Proclaimed OUTSTANDING by my Greek husband and Greek friend!

I made this dish as part of a Greek menu for my grandsons 1st birthday party. It was my first time making it and it was a hit! It was rather easy to put together and it will become part of our family dinners as we love eggplant. The only change I made was not frying the eggplant in oil. I did brown it in the pan to soften it a bit. Thanks for posting  this recipe!

I will make this again, following the directions more closely. LOL  I used Japanese Eggplants that I had on hand, and the flavor of the eggplant did not complement the rest of the dish...  Use the big black eggplants.   
I Loved the Bechamel sauce on this dish!!  I have often disliked it in the past, but it is PERFECT on this dish!

I've made this before. not this exact recipe, but it's very nice anyway. The technique I used previously was to add a potato or two to the layers of eggplant as well. Thinly sliced just like the egg plant is. That adds a bit of mellowing  to the eggplant as well as adding some stability when serving.  
I love Greek food.

This was very good, but very rich.  I think next time I will do as one reviewer suggested and bake the eggplant in the oven instead of frying it. It took up quite a bit of oil when I fried it.

This was really wonderful!!  I halved the recipe and only made a few changes, based on some reviewers suggestions.  I used one large eggplant and about 1/3 lb. of ground chuck, and about half of the onions called for, but a little more garlic.  We grilled the eggplant (for about 5 minutes on each side)on an oiled grill after salting it.  I did rinse the eggplant off (and dried it well) before grilling since I have found that the eggplant can be too salty.  I did increase the cinnamon and garlic a bit.  I also folded one whipped egg white into the bechamel sauce, as some others had recommended and used the remaining egg yolk to mix into the cooled ground beef mixture (I don't think the lack of egg white in there made a difference).  I also used half parmesan and half feta in the layers, with just a little parmesan on the top.  I used a square casserole (about 9") and made two layers, as called for.  It was time consuming, but well worth it!  The two of us could have finished the four servings, but were able to use will power to save just a little less than half!   We will definitely make it again!

I based the success of this dish on how well it compared to the moussaka I have had in Greek diners up in NYC. This was every bit as delicious. I only had one large egg plant on hand so I cut back on the milk by 1 cup and the flour by 2 TBS. I did everything else as it's on the original recipe. I really hate it when people add or take away items from a recipe and then rate it. Changes in ingredients change a recipe and it's not fair to the one submitting the recipe. I had read on some reviews that the sauce was thin. This bechamel sauce can be a bit tricky if a new cook. The thing you must remember is the sauce thickens as it cooks. So--just keep cooking it until it's thick. The flavor of this dish is first rate. Next time I make it, I will bake the egg plant instead of frying. I bake it for my egg plant parm and it passes the test with my Sicilian relatives. Otherwise, I won't change a thing other than perhaps the number of egg plants used. My husband and I are alone, and the one large egg plant was perfect for us.

Fantastic, although I had to use only two eggplants and we now have bechamel sauce enough for another round, and then some. 
Still, fantastic recipe. The cinnamon really lends extra flavor. Will try baked eggplant rather than fried next time, though.

I have made this 3 times.  I follow the recipe mostly except due to dietary needs I use whole fat coconut milk instead of cow's milk and I don't use cinnamon (candida diet reasons). You won't miss the regular milk, and your mid section will thank you.   I don't use the wine either, I subbed pomegranate juice once. I add a good handful of shredded monterrey jack cheese or mozzarella to the sauce near the end.  My husband and toddler loved it too.  I crave this now, it's sooooo decandent.  But, I don't mind the effort, it's easier every time I make it.  However, it takes some time.  I like having leftovers of it so I don't have to cook dinner for days when I make this.   And it's so easy to reheat, just put some on an oven safe plate in the toaster.  Don't let a microwave destroy your hardwork.   I add some steamed potato slices to the bottom, lightly salted and today I added some grated zucchini atop the meat and spinach to the cheesy bechamel sauce.   (I suggest salting it lightly and letting it draw out the moisture, then squeezing out the water with a paper towel, so it doesn't make your dish runny).  Sneak in the greens without your kid noticing, they won't taste the spinach and pick it out, it's so good enrobed in bechamel.  Make this, you will have a crowd pleaser and you will be hooked.  I've had this at restaurants, it's one of the best comfort foods in history for sure, if you like lasagna and greek food, you will love this, it's got a nice tang from the eggplant and

It was a lot more work then we thought it would be, it took an extra hour over what the recipe said. It was VERY greasy (even though we used very lean beef), the eggplant was chewy, and the mixture of spices really didn't work for us. It didn't come out the way the picture looked.

I too followed  posted suggestions.  I added thinly sliced potato, baked both potato and egg plant in oven, rather than frying.  Brushed with olive oil, salt and pepper and added a little garlic powder.  I baked till slightly browned.  I did not add butter to the meat and was generous with spices, adding more cinnamon, nutmeg and parsley.  Next time I think I would use fresh parsley rather than dried.  Cheese sauce was exceptional, used two egg yolks which I added after cooled and folded in two beaten egg whites.  Puffed up and browned nicely.  This is a labor intensive recipe.  Would make meat night  before to save time.  Great left overs as well.  Definately a do again recipe.

This was my first time making moussaka and the other reviewers were right - it is time consuming! Fortunately, it is also quite delicious. Since I noticed so many reviews modified a bit here and there, I followed advice and added 3 beaten egg whites to the bechamel sauce. To save calories, I reduced butter for the sauce to 1/4c and also skipped browning the beef in butter. Seasonings I rarely measure out as tastes vary so much, but I used roughly 1/2 tsp for each of the herbs (I used oregano, basil, thyme for the 'fine herbs' and stuck with the 2 tsp for dried parsley) and increased the cinnamon to a full tsp. I was very pleased with how well this turned out. I do wish the recipe were written a little better; reading the reviews is helpful but one should not have to rely on them for clarity, hence the the 4 stars. I'll make this again in the future, though it'll probably be a while due to the time it took.

Delicious. Seared eggplant slices in a lightly oiled non-stick skillet.  Used a spatula  to press slices into skillet. This helps with the browning as well as it squeezes out some of the moisture. Also, used a  touch of sugar and reduced balsamic  instead of red wine.

Luv the recipe!   I swapped out the beef for turkey.   Yummy.  Thanks for sharing.   About 30 years ago, I ate at this restaurant in Irvington, NJ.  that served great moussaka.   Your recipe brought back great memories.   Thanks again.

I absolutely love the depth of flavor in this dish. I did add egg yolks to the bechamel as others suggested for a firmer topping, and I added some fresh grated nutmeg as well. Next time I will add more tomato sauce, or canned tomatoes with their liquid, to the meat mixture because I like serving this with couscous, and it needs a sauce.

This recipe was great but I changed a lot so it would be to my taste: I baked the eggplant so the dish wouldn't be greasy. First I generously salted all the eggplant slices (cut crosswise not lengthwise), waited 30 minutes, then rinsed each one in cold water and patted each one dry with a clean kitchen towel.  Then lightly  brushed them in olive oil and baked for about 10 minutes at 350. As far as the meat mixture, I used 1.5 lbs lamb which is fatty. So I cooked the meat, drained it, then returned it to the pan and added the spices, tomato sauce and the wine . I did reserve a little bit of lamb fat to cook the onions too. I doubled all the spices and felt it really enhanced the flavor. As far as the bechamel sauce I made it with a little more flour so it would be thicker. In my opinion the white sauce should be very thick because if not you end up with a runny Moussaka. I added some allspice to it as well. In all, I thought it was a great recipe, I just chose to make it less greasy and add more spice. I would recommend! And use lamb! Such great flavor and that is the traditional way!

I think it needs more spices. This turned out to be a bit bland for me. More nutmeg, cinnamon and probably mace would help push it up. It was good otherwise.

Yuck! Followed directions to the "T". Way too oil, even after draining and patting the eggplant numerous times. Feels like I waste half a paper towel roll. Bechemal sauce was bland. This was difficult to eat. I rated it 2 stars because it has potential. I wish I had baked or grilled the eggplant. Also, would have left off the bechemal and top with grated cheese.

I halved the recipe and I cut the eggplant into cubes instead of slices.  I also made the bechamel sauce by melting the butter, then add flour and cook for a few minutes, and then add milk. This dish tasted fine but it was a soupy mess.  Almost like the consistency of chili.

Thank you!!! My husband is Greek and I scored so many points making this for him. Maybe I'm a bad cook but for me this was like a five hour ordeal, really took so much time. It was worth it though. I normally don't like Moussaka, but I even ate this DELICIOUS!!!

made this almost exact to the recipe but added mushrooms to the onions and garlic. Also substituted quinoa in place of the beef. Also added a layer of yukon gold potato slices to the layering. OMG, it was the best moussaka I've ever had.  I will post pics later. I had a few friends assigned to each task. 

1 salted out the eggplant
1 did the potato slices
1 did the quinoa in the rice steamer
1 did the béchamel sauce
and we all contributed to the assembling. 

what a great recipe and a fun dinner party dish!

This rating is for the recipe as written. Though with a few modifications it was excellent.  

I did sub turkey for beef and roasted eggplant (and potatoes) in the oven rather than fry. I found it necessary to turn up the heat and add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I added the stiff peak egg whites like others have done. I also only did one layer because two didn't sound/look appealing and there wasn't room anyway. This recipe proved a nice foundation for the dish. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is delicious!  We got 2 small eggplants in our CSA basket this weekend and I was determined to make something my husband and I would like and this fit the bill.  I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 baking dish.  I didn’t have any white pepper, so I sued fresh ground black pepper and I had to mix my own fines herbs (parsley, chives tarragon & chervil), but it worked out great.  Also, I didn’t have fresh parmesan to grate, still, the dish was fantastic!

It turned out like a greasy, mushy, tasteless pile of yuck.  And i've had awesome Moussaka before. It was more layered out like Lasagna though. We spend all day following the directions exactly! And i'm an outstanding chef. Something happened along the way.

I have tried various recipes for Moussaka and this is hands down the best one.  I did make two changes.  I used store bought bechamel and I used mozarella cheese instead. Otherwise I made no changes.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! This recipe is the right balance of authenticity and simplicity (or as simple as Moussaka can be haha).

This was very good.  I have wanted to make it since I had some in a restaurant 2 years ago.  I followed the hints from the person who said to add eggs to the bechemel sauce and it needs eggs in order to set.  I think I could have baked mine a little longer, but it was great and we have great leftovers.

Darn good, and fun to make, though it takes a while. This would be a perfect way to cook with a friend or kids, since there are several steps going on thaat you  could split up. he coolest thing about this recipe for us non-Greeks is the vaguely exotic taste of all the spices. It's a really pleasant change from all the traditional Italian and French and Mexican flavors we're all pretty used to. Mine came out pretty drippy, though, and it's an awful lot of work for a weekday. Also, the Bechemel is bland and the beef is pretty boring. I wonder if there isn't some way to kick up the fresh flavors a little bit while drying it out a touch.  Drippy or not, though, it tastes really good and keeps in caserole form in the fridge for a week.

I used ground turkey instead of beef, browned it using spray oil and added 2 garden fresh tomatoes and a dash of sugar to the meat sauce.  I also grilled the eggplant to make this dish a bit healthier.  The finished product was delicious!

This recipe was amazing, better than any moussaka I've had in any restaurant. The traditional way to make it would be to use lamb, but I don't particularly care for lamb, so using beef was just fine by me. This recipe was perfect, however I did add mozzarella to each layer, for a total of 2 cups. I also had fresh tomatoes from the garden, so I made my own tomato sauce to mix with the beef instead of canned, which I think makes a huge difference. My husband was in heaven while eating this, and asked if I can make it regularly. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband has made Moussaka for years, but it has always been a little different every time, as it's out of his head from tasting it while vacationing in Greece, but this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  Now we will always use this one to make it great every time!!  Thank you so much for posting it!

This recipe DEFINITELY needs more time than is indicated.  I can't say that this dish turned out as good as some of the moussaka I've tried at Greek restaurants, but it didn't taste bad either.  My family wasn't crazy about it, but that may have just been because I ended up preparing this on a hot day last week (not anticipating the weather would be as hot as it was).  We just weren't all that hungry & there ended up being a lot leftover.

This was OK, but I admit I did make some changes.  I lightly egged and breaded the eggplant before frying.  I did not quite use all of sauce.  I also added potato slices to the bottom layer.

My one year old LOVES this, and that sells it for me. When mine comes out of the oven it is pretty runny, but the next day it is much improved. The first night I usually just serve it over rice. It is really delicious, but to get the full five stars it would need to live up to the moussaka served at our local Greek diner... and it just doesn't.

Very good taste, but I thought the eggplant almost got lost in the beef mixture.  I think I need to add more eggplant or something else for texture and substance next time I make it - but I will be making it again.

I have never had Moussaka before and I was looking for something new to cook with my eggplant, so I thought I would give this a go. I am so glad I did. It was a big hit with the whole family! I followed the recipe as written. This was very yummy!

I didn't think this was too bad but the fiance said it was awful. I think it was the eggplant, he had never had eggplant & I had but didn't like it too much the last time I tried it. The eggplant this time did't taste too bad to me, but again I'm rating this by averaging out 2 people's views. I used mozarrella & a little parmesan in place of just plain fresh grated parmesan. I served with Greek Pasta Salad I from this site & homemade pita chips with garlic & olive oil hummus.

As other reviewers said, it's a lot of work, but it is worth it in the end!  I suck at roux, so I made a paste of cornstarch and water and added it to my hot milk...then I added a bit of butter.  For the eggplant, I sprayed some olive oil on it and let it brown on both sides instead of frying it in oil.  We salted it and rinsed it before.  We also used lean meat to cut down on the grease.  It was great and I'm sure it'll be even better tomorrow!

Absolutely fabulous. Just as good as what I had in a Greek restaurant here in WA state. I omitted the red wine. My only complaint is that it was a little oily, but the flavor was fantastic. I used someone else's advice and substituted oregano, basil, and thyme for the fines herbs. Would probably cut the bechamel in half next time too.

I am not a very good cook, but this dish turned out great!  I love the mix of spices and ingredients that was put together!  The nutmeg was a great added bonus!

This recipe is great if you are willing to make a few obvious changes (especially to cut down the fat.) I took other reviewer's advice and cut the sauce in half and broiled the eggplant, and it was wonderful.

Delicious but greasier than I like.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, fresh parsley instead of dried, and broiled the eggplant instead of frying.  I also only made & used 3/4 of the bechamel sauce.  Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.

This recipe was excellent. I did forget to put the egg into the ground beef though...So I can't wait to try it again next week! My husband says its better than the moussaka we get at authentic Greek restaurants. Thanks so much!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made this for a large group so I tripled the meat and the seasoning that went with it (don't need to triple the bachemel sauce) and I baked it in a large deep casserole dish.  I also substituted lamb for the beef and added two cups of Ricotta cheese to the bachamel sauce.  Everyone loved it - including my vegetarian friend!  She even had seconds!  Anyone who doesn't like this recipe just isn't a fan of Greek food.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a keeper!  I used the left over Easter lamb for it, rather than ground beef.  And it was scrumptious!  Time consuming, labor intensive to make, though.  And my four year old daughter gave the dish mixed reviews!

I had tried Moussaka in Cypress, but was afraid to try making it - that it wouldn't taste the same.  BUT, this recipe is fantastic.  It takes a bit of time, but it is worth it!!  I didn't have any "fine herbs" so I just used oregano, basil,  and thyme - it tasted great!  My boyfriend made the bechemel sauce :)  We loved it and so did our friends!!
