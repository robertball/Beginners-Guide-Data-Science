I ran short on time and only marinated this for about 2 hours. I also used my inside grill pan, turned on the fan and BOY was this Good! Once it was grilled to yummy perfection, I drizzled the leftover dressing over the dish. My kids Already love broccoli and this recipe only solidified that love! THANK YOU VERY MUCH CristalM

I was leery of the prepared dressing in this, but remembered I'm lazy and followed the recipe to a "T".  I'm a an; a big fan!  Mr. LTH and I both enjoyed this (and he didn't complain about grilling it!), so it'll be a go to veggie grilling side in our world. THANKS for the recipe, CristalM!

Will make again.  I only marinated it a short time and it was still good. I have also cooked it on the stovetop and it was fine. Kid approved.

My husband, who does not like veggies but is trying to find ways to eat them, said he would eat this every night.  I felt the dressing was a bit over-powering and will use less next time, but that is going to vary based on what kind you use (I used homemade).  It was also a bit crispy to my taste, so I will cook a bit longer next time.  I marinated for only 1 hour and it had lots of flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Wow. Thank you. Both of my children ate it and they hate broccoli. It was spectacular and easy to prepare.

I marinated for 6 hrs and threw on charcoal grill. The heat was medium high ,so the broccoli took 12 minutes to cook,instead of 7. We enjoyed this as a side dish with marinated  tri tip steaks,and grilled garlic bread from the all recipes website. I would have given it 5 stars but the charcoal taste was a little strong. My bad,not the recipe. ;)

Made my own balsamic vinaigrette (quick to do!) and marinated for about an hour.  A grilling mat was very helpful when cooking.  My husband and I loved it, the picky teen turned up her nose as usual.  Served with green beans and grilled ham to meet our Paleo diet restrictions, yum!
