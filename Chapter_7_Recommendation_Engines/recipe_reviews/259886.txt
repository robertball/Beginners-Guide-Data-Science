Tasty but a little too salty even using the low sodum soy sauce.  Recipe was very easy to make.  Very generous-sized portion.  I made this to top stir fried veggies with rice noodles.  Would have liked the consistency slightly thicker.  I will make this recipe again and will add a touch of cornstarch to thicken and will reduce the soy sauce from 1 cup to

I didn't have the ingredients for true teriyaki, so I looked for something similar- and found this. This is an easy replacement teriyaki sauce using everyday ingredients. I didn't even have enough sugar so I made it with half white sugar and half honey. I also didn't have mustard, but doubled the garlic and ginger. I simmered it for 45 minutes to reduce and thicken. It's tangy and sweet. It's not true teriyaki but it is a great substitute.

Easy to make but the soy sauce was overpowering. Ingredient amounts need to be adjusted. Mine tasted better after adding more Brown sugar. Sauce never thickened.
