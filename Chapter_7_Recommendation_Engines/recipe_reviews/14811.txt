First,definitely use toasted slices of cocktail bread-rye or pumpernickel.2nd, don't use mayo,it just doesn't go well with the cream cheese.I suggest sour cream. 3rd, add the dry dressing mix a little at a time, and taste...until it's to your liking. Using a whole packet is way too much! Half would be better. Dry or fresh dill, either works well. I'll make this again with the above changes. The recipe, as is, is just much too strong and salty and greasy, and the bread does nothing for it.

THANK YOU!!! This recipe was a huge hit at my family reunion, and was SO easy! I used plain Melba Rounds, and splurged on a seedless English Cucumber. It sliced very thinly, which is key in this recipe. I used fresh dill on top; tiny sprigs arranged to look like seagrass. A faint brushing of paprika added the final color. My relatives thought I had been to culinary school! Chilled on a crisp white platter, these make a great addition to any party!

Amazes me that this recipe got even one bad review. It's awesome! I used triscuits. Also took a reviewer's advice and used seedless cucumber. Used Good Season's italian dressing mix - the normal kind. Used about 1/2 of it - kept tasting until I was satisfied. Sliced the cucumber very thin. Sprinkled fresh dill on top, didn't use any dried. Used the amount of mayo recommended in the recipe, otherwise I think the mixture would have been way too thick. Mixed the spread the night before - I recommend this, the flavors were even better the next day. My guests loved these and so did I! They will be a party standard from now on.

Rewrite of Review - 
I used fresh dill and thinly sliced english cucumber for garnish. Doubled the batch and took to a wine/fondue gathering (spring 2007).  
Was VERY WELL RECEIVED, except the crackers ended up getting soggy before the end of the night.  They were all eaten though, soggy cracker or not.  Next time I'll serve separately using a decorative bowl with a butter knife so people can spread on the crackers or bread themselves.

I took this to a potluck, set it down, and came back a few minutes later to a table of people with guilty expressions!   This was a welcome change to the usual chip-and-dip fare, and especially nice for summer.  I used sprigs of fresh dill on top rather than dried - which makes them look as good as they taste.   I will definitely make this again!

This is a very yummy recipe.  I used less of the italian seasoning, about half per cube of cream cheese.  I think it tastes better that way--not as strong.  I also added the dill into the mixture and topped with fresh dill for a pretty presentation.  I used the baguettes slices.  Everyone enjoyed.  I also had them with Toasteds wheat crackers and liked them even better.

This recipe was wonderful!  I made these for a bridal shower and everyone loved them!  No one believed me when I told them what the ingredients were because this recipe was so EASY!!!  I used fresh dill instead of the dried and mixed 1 tbsp. in with the cream cheese mixture in addition to the dill I sprinkled on top.  I got tons of requests for this recipe and the bride has requested it to put in her Newlywed recipe file.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe, Dianne!

I had to travel (via public transporation) to a potluck, so I made the creamy spread, and brought the sliced cucumbers and melba toast separately.  You know how you dont want to eat too much of what you brought, so that others can eat it?  I couldnt stop eating this and felt horribly guilty the whole time!!!!  It was great with the melba toast, and all of these were gone.  I may try to use this recipe with finger sandwiches.  THANKS!!!!!!

I am a picky person when it comes to recipes from this site. This was WAAAAY better than I even expected! And I expected alot from the reviews! I added fresh dill, minced, to the cream cheese mixture and after the flavors had time to mingle (8 hours or so) the fresh dill taste was HEAVENLY. In my opinion, fresh dill for this recipe is a must. A helpful hint: use a potato peeler to peel the cucumber, then just keep going at it with the peeler to create a bunch of thin cucumber slices. when you get to the seeds, stop. You'll end up with PLENTY of slices from one or two cucumbers. Then take each slice and wrap it around your finger like a little circle with it. Then you lay it on the cream cheese spread, and its super fast and easy that way. If you want to get even fancier, you could put a sprig of fresh dill inside the little cucumber ring. A thin peel of cucumber is just the right amount for this recipe and is more pretty than thick slices as some people have done.Preparing it like the photo is hard to arrange. (the curly little twist.) I used ritz crakers which were absolutely WONDERFUL with this recipe. I am going to use it for everyday eating too! It's addicting! And SOOOO easy to make if you use ritz crackers!

This was a nice refreshing treat, and a good way to use the cucumbers in our garden.  I toasted the bread but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I had 2 slices left over, and dh and I thought they tasted better the next day after the herbs and cream cheese blended well overnight.  Next time I'll make the cream cheese mixture the night before.

I hosted game night with 26 adults.  I doubled the recipe & still these were gone within 30 mins.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  It is very good & easy.  The cream cheese part can be made the day before.  The recipe does not say whether to toast the bread or not.  I assumed since it was called "toasties" that I should but I decided at the last second not to.  I do think it's better when the bread is NOT TOASTED.  FYI - your grocery deli will slice the bread for you.

I love this, but I often add a thin slice of Roma tomato this as well, since it tastes good, and the red tomato looks so pretty with the creamy white spread and pale green cucumber.

I can't believe that I've never reviewed this.  I am addicted to these!  I see myself always having cravings for these yummy little appy's.  I do like to lighten this up a bit and it doesn't sacrifice flavor at all.  I use light cream cheese and instead of mayo, I use fat free sour cream.  I don't normally use the full package of italian seasoning.  A third of the packet is normally zesty enough with the brand I use.  I do add in a little dill as well into the dip.  This dip alone is great for veggies, chips, etc!  I do toast my baguette slices to give them a slight crunch.  After pulling out when they are still warm, I slightly drizzle with a little EVOO and take a garlic clove and rub all over the tops.  The combination and texture of the crunchy toasts, the zesty topping, and the fresh cucumbers and dill, compliment each other so well!  They are delish!  I can't ever stop eating them, they are so good!  Thanks for this addicting recipe!  I'm always making them!

Sometimes simple is better and that is the case with this recipe.  EASY, yet people are impressed with it.  Sprinkle the dill on top and it looks gorgeous!  I served this with 2 other types of "bruschetta" - goat cheese with roased red peppers and balsamic drizzled on top, and a classic bruschetta (tomato, red onion, parsley, garlic, s&p, olive oil and red wine vinegar).  GREAT appetizer!

To make the cucumber slices even prettier, score the length of the cucumber with a fork before slicing. I agree that half of the dressing mix is plenty. You can combine with cream cheese only and leave out the mayo. This is a great summer appetizer and easy standby recipe.

Awesome appetizer!  I brought this to a pot luck at my work and everyone thought they were wonderful!  I also used all Fat Free ingredients and no one could tell the difference! 
The only thing that I did different was added about 1-1/2tbsp of garlic powder and the added the dill to the recipe and put additional on top for garnish.

Went over great!  A few touches that were a succes:
1) Only use 1/2 packet of italian dressing mix
2) Add 2 tsp dill weed to the cream cheese mixture AND sprinkle some on top
3) Let the cream cheese mixture sit for at least a couple of hours to let the flavors mix
4) Slice the cucumber very thin and then slit 1/2 the diameter.  That way you can twist the slices to make a pretty presentation.  (I used 1.5 cucumbers total.)
5) Slice the baguette into 1/4" slices.  (I didn't toast and I'm glad with how the final product tunrned out.)  I used a mini French baguette which was nice. 
I also used Neufchatel cheese and reduced fat mayo which worked great -- no one missed the extra fat!

TOP SHELF..If you want to impress someone with a recipe this one is the one as YOU WILL impress your guest with this recipe. I made it as directions stated. As other reviewers said the entire package of Italian dressing to some may be too much, so taste as you mix this together. We VERY much enjoyed the blend it made using the entire package of dressing along with Hellmann's real mayonnaise. Slice the cucumber very thin lengthwise to get a little curl. If you have dried fresh dill it adds a wonderful essence to the flavor. (If you grow your own dill you will want to dry some for this recipe in the future) Use a fresh baguette for best results and cut it on a slight angle. Take along copies of this recipe as YOU WILL be asked for copies of it.

I could eat these all day! They are absolutely delicious. I substituted sour cream for mayo simply because I don't like mayo. I also took the suggestion to add fresh dill to the cream cheese mixture. Because I was using frsh instead of dried, I used 6 teaspoons instead of just 2. I googled "Cucumber ribbons" and I found a site on how to make the cucumber slices look pretty :)  I granished with sprigs of fresh dill and they look SO pretty! Great, great recipe! Thanks!!!!

this website is unbelievable. I've been trying new recipes in cookbooks and never had the high success rate this site offers. This recipe is no exception. I made quite a few appetizers and this was among the top 3 gobbled up.  It's cucumber and dill balances the heaviness of cream cheese to give the illusion of a light appetizer, but indeed is quite hearty.  This is particularly appropriate for summer brunches and Martha-Stewart-like presentations. Only thing I did differently was to peel every other width of the cucumber to make it appear stripes; then when slices, adds a little more interest to the already adequate presentation.

Easy to make and wonderfully delicious.  I took this to a "girls only" get together and the only thing left on the plate was the cucumber slices I used as garnish.

Tried this and like it.  I have a similar recipe that is always a hit.  It calls for Hidden Valley ranch instead of Italian-style ( no mayo) and pita bread.   I spread the mixture on the pita,  slice with a pizza cutter, then add the cucumbers.  Sprinkle a little lemon pepper seasoning on top.

I got this recipe many years ago from this website, and it's still always the biggest hit.
Use a vegetable peeler to slice the cucumber so very thin and you can pile it on for a great presentation.

This is so overly salty, that we could not use it, because of High Boodpressure issues. I wil l  try it next without the seaoning mix and adding dry garlic and onion powder and some white pepper. I might also switch to using sour cream rather than Mayo, it contains  less sodium That might do the trick.

Who would have thought something so simple could be such a hit, and taste so good?  I thought at first the cream cheese, and Italian dry mix.. too much, right? TOO strong, but when combined with the cucumber on top (I skipped the dill) it was a perfect combo!  It was the big hit of a baby shower I hosted!  Melba rounds were used for the base, and I'm so happy with them I'm going to make them as a snack for my family this weekend!
Thanks!

I never rate or review even if the recipe is amazing, so that means this one is way past amazing.  I have made it several times for family and friends with rave reviews.  I have used it as a dip as well.   If you like cucumbers and dill you really need to make this.  I am one who would like to give more than 5 stars, i'm just saying.

So Amazingly good and easy! I got many rave reviews when I made this and ALOT of recipe requests! I did half the Italian dressing mix and used just a little less mayo and used fresh dill in both the dip and on the top. I also diced some cucumber and added it to the mix. It added a little bit of crunch and made it so refreshing. I have made this twice so far and it is my new favorite thing to bring to parties. Plus, the presentation is beautiful with a super thin slice of cuc on top.

I have made this several times and have used 2 different dressing mixes.  The good seasons is perfect with a full packet but the wishbone is too strong if you use the entire pouch.  Thought I'd throw that in as I see in some reviews members say to cut back on the seasoning mix. I only make it on super fresh baguette bread and with fresh dill...yum!
I agree to mix the spread a day ahead as it tastes better the next day. Thank you Dianne!

I have made this basic recipe more times than I can count.  However, I do a few slightly different things.  First, you do not need the mayo.  It tastes just as yummy without the extra calories.  In fact, I usually use the 1/3 fat cream cheese.  I mix the dressing and cream cheese together and refrigerate a few hours (overnight is even better).  This makes it harder to spread, but the taste is better.  Then spread (not too thick) on party rye.  I find the square "manufactured kind" holds up better than the fresh bakery type, although the latter tastes better.  Slice the cucumber as thin as you possibly can and top with a sprinkle of dill.  These are by far the easiest appetizer I make and one of the most well-liked.  The way I make them, I use 1/2 loaf of bread and about a 1/2 cucumber, so double if you want to use it all.

These were great. Can't wait to make them again. I received many compliments, and there were no leftovers:) I made this recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I noticed they tasted better after they sat for about half an hour. It's different, simple and affordable.

I LOVE this recipe. It's such an easy an refreshing treat. I always use slices of English cucumber, it is worth the extra cost. It makes the whole dish very pretty. I use lightly toasted slices of Asiago bread from Panera. They can cut it in perfectly sized and uniform slices in about a minute. I don't sprinkle dill on the top, I mix it in with the other stuff. The spread is so good, I use any leftovers as a veggie dip. It's great with red peppers!

I personally didn't think these were much, but my guests enjoyed them & several even asked for the recipe, so I'm making them again for this year's SuperBowl party.    I toast my slices of French bread (in the oven) for the side that I'll spread the creamy mix on -- to keep them from getting soggy.  And I finely chop up half a cucumber to add to the cream cheese/ Italian/mayo spread.  I sprinkle a little dill on top each one and I top with a half a cucumber slice.

What a nice appetizer!! Fresh and yummy and different. We put it on low sodium Triscuits and loved it. I used fresh dill and hothouse cucumbers....so so good!

Phenomenal! I used toasted bagel chips instead of a baguette, but that was simply for easier prep.

I've taken these to two parties and they were a hit both times.  I used Toasteds crackers because my local grocery store didn't have baguettes.  I also mixed the dill in with the cream cheese and other ingredients and garnished the top of each cucumber with fresh dill.  Very impressive presentation.

Two parties in one week and people loved this!  It seemed frou-frou to me, but even the guys enjoyed it - light and fresh tasting - a nice change from heavy, meat and grease-laden appetizers that are the norm!  The cream cheese mixture DOES make a LOT - in fact, I split it between the 2 parties.  I used a total of 3 loaves of cocktail rye rounds, 3 cucumbers, and fresh dill.  Note that in a single layer this DOES take up a lot of room on a platter, but could be lightly layered and fanned out - impressively pretty.  I didn't make them in advance, but brought the seasoned cream cheese mixture, the sliced cucumbers, the chopped dill, the bread, and my platter to the party and quickly assembled it there.  Thank you, Dianne!

Amazing! I've made this twice and everyone LOVES it. 

The first time, I sliced a baguette, oiled each slice and baked them for a few minutes to golden brown. Then, I made them look just like the picture.

The second time, I skipped the baguette and got bagel chips instead (go the baguette route). I also used fresh dill and only used half of the Good Seasons packet which was awesome because the whole thing is way too strong. And instead of putting cucumbers on the top, I just chopped them into chunks and threw them right into the dip.

Next time I make this, I'll use the baguette like last time as well as fresh dill. I'll make each one individually with the cucumber on the top instead of in it, and I'll continue to only use half the Good Seasons packet.

Heavy--fattening?  Some people have no imagination or creativity.  Made this with fat free cream cheese, light mayo.--so  where is it "heavy-fattening"?  Love it with a slice tomato as suggested!  Any less calories & it would be cardboard--of which I am not a fan!

i use Miracle Whip instead of Mayo and that makes it a little more sweet. you can balance that with some lemon juice if you like. i also grate my cukes and drain them. that intensifies the cuke flavor and makes them easier to bite.  they are always a HUGE hit at any event.

Twist on my favorite cucumber appetizers (on pumpernickel with sour cream and lemon pepper).  I don't know why they call these "toasties" since there is no instructions to toast the bread in the recipe.  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and used Triscit's.  Next time I will go back to the pumpernickel cocktail bread.

This is truly a wonderful, simple, delicious recipe! I made these in a snap the night before a baby shower and they held up well in the fridge, everyone raved about how good they were. I got one of those long, narrow French baguettes at Target and they sliced it for me at the bakery counter, it was perfect. This is now my go-to recipe when I need to make a yummy, easy snack for a party. Delicious!

I've made these about 10 times since I saved the recipe, and its the most requested recipe I ever get. Theres never any leftovers! However, I always double the recipe, and even then I don't use the entire .7 ounce package of dry italian seasoning, if so the flavor is way too strong! I can't imagine using the whole thing with only 1 block of cream cheese. I also add garlic and onion powder to the mix, and sprinkle a little paprika on top when they are done.
Awesome!! =)

Do spring for the hot house cucumber for this recipe. The lack of seeds is nice. Also don't skimp on the cream cheese mixture on the bread. Do lightly toast the french bread. It was supper yummy by following these simple things

Unlike other reviewers who were worried about the mix being too strong, I didn't mind - I used the whole packet of Italian seasoning, and even mixed it the day before and let the flavours blend overnight. Also, I did use mayo as directed in the recipe, not sour cream as other reviewers suggested. I thought the cheese and mayo mixed REALLY well and the next day the blend tasted great. I spread onto sliced and toasted whole wheat french baguette. Then, inspired by the photo with the recipe, peeled and curled strips of cucumber on top. Sprinkled with dried dill as directed in recipe. Thought this was easy, looked great, and tasted fantastic. DON'T change the recipe (except for toasting the bread)!

These were wonderful.  Just remember:  as soon as they are prepared, they must be served.  I made the mistake of making them at home, popping them in the fridge for about 30 minutes and then taking them to a reception.  Unfortunately, they were quite soggy.  However, I did taste them while I was making them, and they were very tasty.

OOHHH...someone please give me an excuse to make these again.  These were TERRIFIC!  Went over well at a recent birthday party I threw for my daughter. So light and delicious.  I would even make this for a light lunch or dinner.  Used fresh dill...it's a bit cheaper than dried.  Such a good recipe.  Kudos Dianne!

I used this recipe for a Christmas open house.  This was the most complimented item I fixed for this affair.  I had more people ask me for this recipe than any other.  One man even told me that he had attended a lot of open houses this season and said that this was the most tasty, well presented item than any he had had in a long while.  My compliments to the owner of this recipe.

Made these for an appetizer at a party.  They were a hit!  I would recommend using a pinch of salt along with the dill to bring out the flavor of the cucumbers.  I think next time I'll also use a flavored cream cheese.  Definitely toast the bread.  I used a whole wheat baguette which enhanced the flavor.

These were a hit at a Labor Day block party!  The platter was empty long before the BBQ was fired up.  After reading previous reviews and experimenting, this is what I recommend:
1) Use all of dressing mix in the cream cheese and make it the day before.
2) Use fresh dill, not dried.
3) Add 1 Tbsp fresh dill to the cream cheese mixture.
4) Slice mini French baguette 1/4" and toast lightly under broiler.
5) Use potato peeler on English cuke for curly, thin slices.

I don't understand why some of you gave this recipe low marks. You can pretty much "guesstimate" the amount of sodium & fat content just by reading the recipe! If you have health restrictions just simply don't make it!

I have made this for years.  It is one of my favorites!  I do not add mayo, but I use whipped cream cheese and let it sit out for 15 - 30min before I make them.  I use 1/2 a package of the salad dressing mix.  It mixes and spreads easily and doesn't get soggy.

I have made this appetizer for 2 completely different occasions and both times, everyone loved it!  I had people coming up to me for the recipe!  It is a nice light addition to any summer party!  The only thing I changed was the amount of dressing mix. I mixed in 1/2 a package, then added more seasoning to taste.  I will definitely be making this again!

Used sour cream instead of mayo and pumpernikel bread instead of french. Also used Italian dressing mix from this site.

Two words...simply delicious.  I toasted the sliced french bread in the oven for about 5 min on 375 just to get a little bit of moisture out, (didn't make them "crunchy.")  I only used about 1/2 of the Italian dressing mix and I used fresh dill in lieu of dried.  These things are highly addictive!

As suggested by other reviewers, I only used half the packet of dressing mix, and used half mayo, half sour cream.  I also mixed the dill right into the mixture.  I toasted the french bread before assembling and had no problem with sogginess.  Absolutely a five star recipe with these changes!

Yum!  Here's a tip: you can use italian salad dressing in a bottle instead of the dry mix.  It works just as well. :)

The spread tastes great.  I tried using toasted melba rounds and found they got soggy pretty quickly.  These are much better with multigrain crackers.  Seedless english cucumbers are worth the slurge.

These were great!  I actually liked them on untoasted bread than toasted.  It might have been my baguette but it was so crunchy it was hard to eat.  The spread was delicious and my dinner guests were putting it on crackers, untoasted baguestte and toasted baguette.  The contrast of the cool, crisp cucumber and the flavorful spread was great.

These are wonderful and they went over great at a recent party I threw (50 ppl).  I used mini loaves of rye bread which made it quicker to prepare (I made a lot of them!).  Everything else was exact to the recipe.  Will use this again and again.  Note:  Don't be fooled into thinking these are too "dainty" for men as these babies were mostly devoured by men.  When it comes to great eats, there are no gender issues.  Use fresh dill and if you toast, toast lightly.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent. Actually, what I wanted was the spread. We've normally made "cucumber sandwiches" with pumpernickel cocktail bread, cream cheese mixed with Italian seasoning and slices of cucumber. But the cream cheese was always a little hard to spread. The addition of the mayo is brilliant and the spread in this recipe tasted excellent and was super easy to put on the bread.

I made this for company and everyone liked it. The change I made was I used the mini rye loaf (usually found at the deli counter) and cut different shapes with cookie cutters. Just make sure the shapes are big enough for the cucumbers.

I've used this recipe repeatedly now for all sorts of occasions and they are always gone in a blink!  I use the Pampered Chef's dill mix on top and it's great. (No..I don't sell PC, so I'm not advertising Ü, but if you get a chance to buy it -go for it! Perfect for this recipe!)
Thanks for sharing a fantastic recipe!

Excellent receipe.  Made these for a few ladies I was having for lunch and they all agreed that they were yum.  I even made a cuc. sandwich with the cream mixture.  Kid friendly, I didn't give a good rating because of the slicing of cucumbers.
Otherwise...I will use this recipe lots!!

Delicious. Perfect as written. Made mixture aday ahead of time. This would be good on baked potatoes, crackers, dip for vegetables and I'm sure I will find more items to use it on. A keeper.

I used crackers instead which is ok if you plan on eating them quickyly not ok if they sit. The cracker gets soggy. Next time i will use the sliced baquets.

Easy to make.  I had a number of canapes and this was rated the favourite by my guests.  

I used fresh dill and half the italian dressing mix. Made the mixture the night before to allow the flavours to blend.

it's perfect after a few changes/got a 4 as it isn't perfect as written. I made the same changes as previous posters. At first I did make it as written. The seasoning flavor is too strong and the mayo too sweet for me. So...I added a second pgk of cream cheese and 1/2 a cup of sour cream. THEN it was just right for my tastes. So....in the end I used half the Italian seasoning and half mayo/half sour cream.

These are great, if you like cucumbers, you had better make a lot of them as they go really fast.

These were so much better than traditional cucumber sandwiches!!!  The creamy topping for the toasties was delicious enough to use for other things.  It may be my new dip!!!

This sounds wonderful but, as a novice cook, I must ask -- why are they called "toasties"?  Are you supposed to toast the bread slices, and if so, how?

These are so delicious.  I gave 4 stars because I changed it a bit to make it easier & so I didn't have to use mayonnaise (which my family doesn't like).   I used Philadelphia Cream Cheese Garden Vegetable flavor.  With that you will not need to add any seasoning to it.  Just toast the bread, let cool, spread on the garden vegi cream cheese, top with cucumbers, & season with dill.  It's that easy!! & they were SOOO good!  Me & my friends ate them all with a few bottles of champagne.  It made a great appetizer & I've made it again for parties. They always disappear fast!

I made this for a recent baby shower and everyone really enjoyed it. My only substitute was using mini bagels instead of baguettes as the baguettes I had purchased were really hard and crumbly. The flavor with the dill and cucumber is somewhat reminiscent of tzatziki. To make the cucumbers look more decorative and ribbon-like, a potato peeler worked great!

These are so good and refreshing.  I made them for a girls night and per other reviews only used a 1/2 a packet of the italian seasoning.  It came out wonderful.  I served on toasted Rye bread pieces.  Delicious!  I will be making this again!

Great recipe; I have a recipe very similar to this. The key to mine is to soak the cucumber slices in 1/2 cup cider vinegar and 1 cup water for about 30 minutes prior to assembling the sandwiches. It gives them that little "something extra."

I couldn't find baguette so I substituted with a regular french bread.  That was my mistake.  French bread is a lot softer than baguette.  When I took this to the New Year's Party they sat there and got soggy towards the end of the night.  I will make sure to use baguette next time.

These are always gone by the end of the shower. I made a lot this time to make sure I had enough and I am glad..... People came back for seconds and thirds! Highly Reccomend this Recipe!! A lottle tip is to toast the bread before you apply the cream cheese mix.

I have made this several times for parties, it has always been a hit. The biggest tip I could offer is use English (hothouse) cucumbers! They are more expensive, but much nicer for this recipe. I like to run a fork along the peel before slicing and topping the toasted baguette slices. Ranch dressing/dip mix can be used instead of Italian. I also prefer to use fresh dill and sprinkle some on top of the toasties for garnish. Don't forget to ask the bakery to slice the bread for you. Easy and yummy!

I made this with toasted slices of Viennese bread. I took the cream cheese out of the fridge an hour or so in advance so that it was nice and soft, and easy to mix with the other ingredients. I added the Italian dressing mix a little at a time because I wasn't sure how salty it would be. When I make these again, I will more than likely omit the dill - I am a big fan of dill usually, but I didn't much care for it in this recipe. Anyway, we ended up with a great little early evening snack. Thanks, Dianne! (PS I made these a couple of days later but used toasted English muffins. I think they might be even better than the bread!)

There is something special about this recipe.  We usually toast only one side of the bread under the broiler.  It gives it a bit of a crunch. Both sides seems like a little much

These were a hit at our Christmas party last night!  I used sour cream instead of mayo, and I also used toasted plain bagel chips that I found in the deli section instead of bread.  This recipe was great because I could make the cream cheese mixture the night before and just assemble them right before the party.

Fabulous! I would give these more than five stars if I could because it is tasty and simple to prepare. I used a fresh baquette and experimented with toasted bread as well as untoasted. I prefer the untoasted. Only downside is this is a bit salty. This morning, the spread thickened up a bit so maybe if you used some milk, it would be thinner as well as less salty. Reminds me of Aloette. I can see using leftovers with pasta, cucumber sandwiches. Also used more dill than the recipe called for and garnished with fresh dill from my garden.

DELICIOUS and a big hit at the cocktail party I took it to!  As other reviewers did, I added fresh dill to the cream cheese mix, used less of the salad dressing mix, spread on cocktail pumpernickle, and arranged them in rows on a platter, with every other row adding diced red peppers, and garnished with a sprig of fresh dill.  Beautiful presentation and it looked so gourmet for as easy at it was to prepare!  I'd planned on having cucumber sandwiches with the leftovers the next day, but my hubby ate it all up that night when we got home!

All I have to say is WOW!  I made these for a "girl" get together, I was worried I had too many with all the other food I had.  I was shocked when I went to grab one and they were almost gone!  I got many compliments on these.  My mom liked them so much she made more the next day.  I mixed the dill in with the mixture AND garnished the cucumbers with it as well.  I was worried because I didn't have time to toast them like some had suggested, but I didn't have a problem with the bread getting soggy as other reviewers had mentioned.  These were so easy and so tasty!  Highly recommended!  My husband just informed me that we were having friends over this weekend.  Great excuse to make them again!  Thanks for the recipe, it will be a regular!

This was so easy to make and a huge hit at my July 4th barbeque. I toasted the bread though, which I thought (due to the name) should have been in the recipe. I just sliced the bread, put them on a cookie sheet under the broiler for a few minutes, turned them over to toast on the other side and then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. They were the perfect barbeque appetizer. Thanks!

These are great! I used melba toast and they were so crunchy. I also used an English seedless cucumber the small extra cost is well worth it.

This is a great appetizer! The recipe is always requested when I make this. I also use Zesty Italian seasoning or Galic Italian for more of a zip, seedless cucumbers and fresh dill. It makes for a great looking presentation. It is cool and refreshing for any summer occasion.

These are amazing!  I bought a French baguette, but it was hard as a rock, and I didn't have any crackers.  Late New Year's Eve, what do you do when you have it mixed up and the cukes sliced?  Toast some bread and cut into squares.  I will make time and again, and just might use toasted white bread on purpose.

This is GREAT! I substituted plain white melba toast rounds for the baguette and it really lent a yummy crunch and hold up much longer without getting soggy or stale tasting. It is also good to make the spread a day ahead to let the flavor really pop. I also topped mine with fresh dill in leu of dried for presentation.

This recipe has been a family favorite for years and I make it for every holiday and is always the first app to go.  I always serve it on the small pumpernickel deli breads (seems to be the best combo for flavor) with the Seven Seas Italien dressing mix-about 1 tblsn of mayo per package of cr. cheese. Topped with cuc and dill- You can't go wrong!!

This is really simple to make, yet delicious! I used Knorr Creamy Dill Mix instead of the Italian Dressing Mix and added the cream cheese/mayo called for in the recipe as posted (I didn't follow the recipe on the back of the Knorr packet).  Just so happens the Knorr mix was on sale so I thought I'd try it.  I found heart shaped lavosh crackers at the supermarket.  They made my hors d'oeuvres look especially elegant and they tasted great.

This recipe has set the new "Movie Night" record for appetizer-eating record.  The entire tray was gone in 10 minutes.  I used whipped cream cheese and more than called for to tone down the dressing mix.  Also great on a roll-up turkey sandwich the next day.

I have substituted fat-free cream cheese and reduced fat mayonaise for this.  It is still a crowd favorite!

These were beautiful and very, very tasty.  I took them to an office potluck...I assembled them in about 5 minutes in the office kitchen and I received several requests for the recipe.  Would make a great St. Paddy's Day appetizer (very green!).

Tried a recipe similar to this years ago and liked it. Maybe my taste has changed, but I wasn't crazy about this. Seemed like there was too much mayo and I didn't even use the whole amount. I also think I would prefer ranch mix or just some spices over the Italian dressing mix. I did use fresh dill incorporated into the cream cheese.

I made this when our family was doing a surprise boat outing for a b-day celebration. It was perfect for the occastion and easy to serve! As others suggested I modified the recipie a bit: replace mayo with sour cream (I'm sure greek yogurt would work well also).  I do recommend this recipie as it is very easy & well recieved by many!

Made this recently for a church potluck, and adjusted the Italian Dressing mix as most suggested (1/2 pkt).  Everyone who had them raved about them -- even some kids! Very easy to make, doesn't take long, and people think you are some sort of guru!  Making them again in a month or so for a special event as part of the hors doeurves.

Huge win and hands down the favorite item at this month's brunch. Wish I had bought another cuke! I do have almost enough cream cheese to do another loaf worth. I personally found .7 ounces too much of the seasoning, but am glad I mixed that part up the day before to soften the herbs and meld the flavors. Want to try again with rye bread and fresh dill :)

This is one of my regulars when preparing dinner for guests.  Simple and flavourful and lets me concentrate on finishing the cooking of the rest of the meal while guests munch and talk.  I always prepare the spread ahead of time to allow flavours to mingle.  I prefer to use a crispier cracker such as Melba canapés than sliced french bread.  I usually a little extra dill right into the spread and always top with fresh dill.

Delicious. I used fresh dill rather than dried, and added the Italian seasoning to taste. I wound up using about 1/2 of it. I HIGHLY recommend using this to taste, as this is your salt component and people have very different tastes for saltiness. Had I used the whole package, I think it would have been far too much for me.

I served these at a baby shower and everyone seemed to enjoy them. I put some cheese mixture on slices on baguette, then a slice of English cucumber, then a small sprig of fresh dill... GREAT presentation.

I had leftover cream cheese mixture, and it tastes lovely on crackers or on bagels, too. Anywhere that a savory cream cheese goes, this works.

Instead of worrying about the crackers or bread getting soggy, and also to save calories/carbs, I just sliced the cucumber into 1/4" thick rounds and spread the cream cheese mixture on top, then sprinkled with dill. It might not be for everyone, but we loved it. We also loved the recipe as is, too!

These were good, and simple. I have used cocktail rye bread, baguette and white bread. I always put fresh dill on top. They looked very pretty and are so light and refreshing in the spring. I think prefer soft white bread (crusts cut off-and I cut into shapes or triangles) as I think the chewiness of baguette and the dryness of the cocktail bread just do not work as well. Overall, delightful.

I made this exactly like the recipe except I used whole wheat Melba rounds (thank you previous reviewer). It was a HUGE it -- folks kept saying they were addicted to this appetizer. For a bonus, I used a cake decorating bag and tip to put the cream cheese mixture on the Melba rounds which made it really easy (think cheese-wiz) but looked fancy. (Use a wide tip so the chunks of Italian dressing seasoning don't get caught).

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was all good, but the dip part was the best. There was more dip than there was bread so we pulled out some wheat crackers. I seriously thought people were going to start licking the bowl. 

I will be making this again and again!!

I made this recipe because of all the great reviews.  I used half the dry mix and it was delicious.  I bought toasted garlic bread rounds, but they got soggy before the night was half over.  I loved the flavor of the spread, but will use it as a dip in the future.

Delicious!  Made mine for a party on regular white bread with the crusts cut off and cut in half... super easy and very economical for a big group!

I used 3/4 of the seasoning pack, put on crackers and used regularly sliced cucumbers (not too thick or too thin) and topped with dried dill.  I made the cream cheese mixture the night before.  Several people asked me how I made them and told me how good they were.  

Very simple and fresh tasting appetizer (I made them for a baby shower but my dad sampled some too and said they were really good).

Super simple/easy to make/complimented = great recipe.

Holy cannoli these are fab!  Loved it and all the people in my household and a few friends are addicted!  I love the recipe just as it is but seeing how good they are I am using reduced fat mayo and cream cheese next time to cut the guilt factor...

I've not made this recipe but had to applaud all you amazing photographers!  The pictures you took of this dish are beautiful.  I especially like the ones that show the cucumber sliced super thin and twisted atop the baguette!  Lovely to look at!

Loved these.  Made them to take to work but by the time I was done sampling them, there wasn't enough to take to the office.  S-o-o-o, I ate the rest of them the next day. :)

Yum! I used sour cream instead of mayo and mrs. dash instead of the italian seasoning.  Served them on rye tricuits and it was great and SO easy.

Awesome recipe as is, even with regular cucumbers! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used the baguette and toasted it in the oven at 350 for 5 min. first before putting on the toppings. It did not get soggy at all.  I think this step was left out of the original by accident since they are called toasties!  The cream cheese mixture did seem really salty when I tasted it by itself so I was a little worried, but once its on the bread with the cucumber it was fine.  I would not cut down on the seasoning packet because it needs the flavor.  I put a 1 tsp of the dill into the cream cheese mixture and the other on top.  I would NOT use sour cream in place of the mayo either! Wouldn't change a thing if I made it again  and I'm sure I will!

mmmmmmm.  I toasted some soft French bread in the brioler.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and def did not use the entire package of Italian dressing mix (maybe half).  The cukes and the dill gave it just the right amount of cool against the salty of the cheese spread.  I made it for my daughter's 3rd birthday party and it was a huge hit.  Yummy!!

These are wonderful!  I served them to my family when they came to dinner. They taste fresh and the mayo/cream cheese mixture is delicious. I used Triscuits as another reviewer suggested. I didn't have the dry Italian salad dressing so I substituted Italian seasoning and it worked fine. I will make these often!

I began using this recipe shortly after it was posted and it is ALWAYS a hit! I am asked for the recipe by almost every party goer each time I bring it and it goes fast, so plan on doubling the recipe for a crowd!  I usually make the recipe as is, but have used garlic toasties, rye bread squares and various other breads.  I have also let the mixture stand on its own as a dip.   Soooo happy I found this!!  Thank you!

Very good recipe, but honestly next time I will probably only use 3/4 of the recommended dressing mix because I found it a slight bit too salty.  I added extra dill though which helped that.  I wanted to make the dip ahead of time, so I chopped the cucumbers and just added them into the dip, I loved that.

OH MY YUM! I've made this recipe several times now and each time they fly off the plate!  I have baked the baguette circles for 5 minutes at 375 degrees and i love the "crunch".  My entire family loves these....from my 3 year old all the way up to my 10 year old. Thanks for such a yummy and EASY appetizer!

Just Awesome! although if you leave them out for long, they DO get soggy. Maybe (as advised in other reviews) let guests spread the cream cheese mixture on the toaties themselves.

Perfection! I took these to a party and got rave reviews... They were so simple to put together and delightfully tasty! Be sure to put a few aside for yourself as they do not last very long! These are great for a shower or a luncheon. Thanks for submitting this one; I will make it again and again.

I  took it to a small get together last night. I  made it just like it said except I used pumpernickel cocktail bread , I didnt  toast it I  made  dip  ahead of time, and I  cut my  english  cukes with the processor. I also  added dry  dill right in  with  cream cheese, which i mixed in  processor  also. Bought fresh  dill and put a sprig on top. When I got to the party I  put it all together then. Out of 8 people  all  8 loved it. And there was one  fussy person there  too  so I was suprised. I will make  many more times, next time  will try  french  bread. also make sure to make dip night before  or  chill at least a few  hours

I have made this for two separate baby showers - and both times it has been a hit.  People always compliment how delicious it is - and ask for the recipe.  Also, I love how gourmet it looks on the platter.  When I make it I include the following variations: I half the salad dressing mix, and sprinkle fresh dill and paprika on the top.

This was so nice and different - not to mention simple which is a must for appetizers which get so fussy! I toasted the bread to help keep it from getting soggy and a used the italian dressing to taste instead of the whole packet. Everyone loved them and I thought they were a great little bite - even the kids ate them.

Disappeared at a shower.  Really yummy.  After making using the original recipe, I now use fresh dill instead of dried and use salt, white pepper, and a little bit of onion and garlic powder instead of the italian dressing mix.

I threw a party this past weekend and made these as one of many appetizers, and they were a HUGE hit! They looked fantastic (as though they had been professionally catered) and everyone was so impressed when they learned that I had made them myself. I almost felt guilty because they were SO easy to make! I will definitely make these again!

This is a great appetizer recipe. I used about half of the Italian seasoning and sprinkled fresh dill over the top.  The second time I made this recipe I used Toasteds wheat crackers and like it even better.

I used a marble rye bread that I lightly toasted and used a frozen dill cube in the cream cheese mixture.  Turned out great, everyone loved it!

Taste great, I used pumpernickle bread sliced in halves, added dill to the mix and on top of cucumber slices. You can also use vegetable cream cheese (tastes exactly the same and shaves off some prep time.)

I LOVE this recipe. It's easy and tastes AWESOME! It is a little time consuming to put together though. So if you are like me, and put things together for a party at the last minute, you need to make a little time. You may want to add a dash or 2 of dill in the cream cheese mixture as well.

I wish I had used a mixer, to mix the cream cheese, mayonnaise and dressing mix, so that it would have been creamier.  But, it came out yummy anyway.  These would be perfect for a bridal shower, or baby shower, or just for me to snack on all day long.  Thank you!

These are FANTASTIC! They have become a staple for me to bring to parties, BBQ's and family get-togethers.  They are light and very tasty. Make the spread the night before and let the flavors blend. It makes a lot so grab a extra loaf and few extra cucumbers. I suggest using english cucumbers, less seeds and usually tastes good, not bitter like regular cucumbers occasionally do.

Makes for a beautiful presentation. I cut the cucumber with my pampered chef veggie cuter and made it look so pretty. I used bagel chips instead of baguette. I also used the pampered chef dill mix instead of just dill. Also added a pinch of salt and pepper. Everyone loved them at my recipe club meeting.  thanks for sharing! :)

EVERYONE loves these!  It's like a little bit of salad on a big crouton.  Men, women, and children eat these up.  They are very simple.  I have even forgotten to add the mayo and they are still a huge hit.

Everyone asked for the recipe. I thought the second layer was hard to spread over the cucumber and the dill might have looked good sprinkled on top. I used fresh dill.

I mixed up this recipe the night before just as others had suggested so the flavors would meld.  I used bagel crisps instead of baguettes...the crunch and size of these were PERFECT!  In addition to the slice of cucumber and sprinkle of dill, I also added diced red pepper around the cucumber slice.  What a great presentation they made.  I brought them to a "recipe club" exchange and they were a hit.  Not one left!  Definitely will do again!

These are so terrific.  Watch out what dry ranch dressing mix you buy though.  I have tried a few different ones and some really change the flavor.  Experiment to find the one you like best.

The second of my tea favorites this sandwich is a sure pleaser.  Because of the cream cheese it's a little harder to transport, but still easy to make and fast to go.

I really liked this.  I used a packet of Good Seasonings as a reviewer suggested.  I just need to figure out the best cucumber-to-baguette-slice ratio for me.  It was well liked by my group.

This is a great base recipe. I improve it with a few modifications. Instead of mayo I use miracle whip. I mix some dill in the mix. I put the mix on the bread. I use different kinds of breads. After putting the creamy mix on the bread, I cover it with mozzarella cheese. Pop it in the oven and broil it until the cheese start to melt. Then put the cucumber and dill on top before serving. YUMMY!

I followed the advice of others and used just a little over half of the packet of Italian Seasoning. Definitely add it to taste. Half of the packet or a little over was perfect for me. I also toasted the french bread slices under the broiler first. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Pretty good the first time for a light snack, it was perfect for a brunch. I don't think I will make it again because the italian seasoning flavor was just too much for me.

This was just plain delicious. I put in about 3/4 of the Italian dressing mix and used bagel crisps instead of the baguette. I also used a peeler to make very thin slices so it looked nicer and was a little easier to eat. It was a bit salty but still delicious. I will definitely make this again.

These are great. We served them on Melba sea salt crackers. I used a vegetable peeler to make ribbons of cucumber that I then folded onto the dip.

Excellent appy. Easy, fast and cheap. Double bonus I made the cream cheese mixture a day ahead. It was a tad salty, so next time I'll either use less dressing mix or more mayo. Fantastic on those little store bought pita rounds.

Pretty good & simple recipe to make.  I toasted the baguette slices w/a touch of melted butter (425 for 5 minutes). I also took the advice from another reviewer - used sour cream instead of mayo & slowly added the salad dressing mix to taste (about half).  Love the cucumber idea, different than my normal spinach dip.  Got complemented by several people at the party. Thumbs up!

Very good. A tad on the salty side but still worth it. I used an English cucumber and sliced my bread thin and toasted it. I the mayo adds a nice little tang. Next time I will add my own Italian dressing mix to cut down on the salt and avoid what ever frankinfood is in the store bought junk. I used fresh dill and added some in the cream cheese mixture. I made the cream cheese the day before to really alow the flavors to meld. All our guests enjoyed this one

This recipe is a keeper.  I used rye Triscuits and it was delicious!  Only adjustment was that I didn't use all of  the salad dressing mix - I used about 3/4 of the packet.

Fantastic!  I doubled the recipe, and only used one italian dressing packet.  Used L/F cream cheese and lite sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  Used 3 regular cucumbers, sliced paper thin on a mandoline, and fresh dill.  Had spread left over.

I had a Tea Party this weekend to promote my cakes, candies and other treats I sell, and these babies were as big (if not bigger) a hit as the sweets!  Everyone wanted to know how I made them and were shocked to hear how super simple they were to make.  I will be adding these to my list of "popular party foods"!  So Yum!

Made exactly as written. They were a big hit. I think maybe a bit less of the italian dressing though.

Good...but used less of the dry Italian salad mix (too salty) and added a squirt of lemon juice and a little dill in the mix, not just on top.

I've made this several times, and constantly get asked for the recipe.  The flavor is a little too strong with the whole italian dressing packet, I use about 3/4 of the pack.  I do very lightly toast the bread before assembling.

Perfect. I recommend peeling the cucumbers so people aren't taking off the entire cucumber slice in the first bite. I made these with Triscuits.

Changed this to my preference of sour cream instead of the mayo and turned out wonderful. I also chopped up the cucumber instead of slices.

Not phenominal but yummy and so simple to make, also visually pleasing.  My four year old approves so it's good in my book!  Next time I think I'll use cream or milk to soften the cream cheese instead of mayo, or just use whipped cream cheese.

Surprisingly, I loved this.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  This will be a new staple for parties at my house and when visiting others.
**Edit- Made this for a family function and everyone loved it.  My SIL said that this needs to be put on the menu each time we get together.  Edit again: this gets requested from family and friends whenever I go visiting and ask "what can I bring?"  I do use less than a whole package of seasoning so that it doesn't get overpowering.

I don't understand why anyone would change this recipe. It all works very well together. Mayo and cream cheese are used togehter all the time. The bread choice is the only thing I think you need to change up as needed. Very good recipe and I appreciate it very much.

I have this exact recipe. Someone said to use sour cream, UGH! And to use only half an envelope of italian seasoning...well it is all up to you, but I'd say stick to the original, you just shouldn't toy with success! It's easy to make, a hit at parties, showers, friendly get togethers...everyone wants this recipe! Thanks for sharing it!!!

Fantastic! I made these for the Royal Wedding party I attended, and everyone loved them. I could eat the whole batch by myself although would never get the chance! I did use the whole season packet and I think it was really flavorful, although some salt-sensative people may have found it salty, I thought it was perfect. I also did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream since that's what I had on hand. Can't really say if that affected the taste much but boy was it good!!! I made with mini bagels to make my transport easier, however I am sure they are even better on the french bread. This recipe can be adapted into several things, I think I am going to try making turkey pinwheels with the spread and cucumbers. Yummy a must try!

Wonderful recipe! I served it as a dip with slices of cucumbers and slices of baguette on the side. I added the dill to the mix and as others stated only used 1/2 the dressing mix! Those who do not like cucumber still loved the dip. It was gone in no time!

I won best dish with this recipe at an Easter Tea!! I followed the directions for the spread, used an English cucumber and sourdough baguette. I did use less dressing mix, but like other reviewers said, it's all a matter of preference and taste. Absolutely wonderful, I will be making this again and again!!

It's super easy to make, and it's always a hit! Looks very pretty on a platter for a party or you can just make up a batch to snack on. Leave off the cucumber and dill and it goes great with spaghetti!

I decided to give this a try because it had such high reviews.  I wasn't impressed with this at all.  It didn't have much flavor and it had a wierd texture.  I used Good Seasonings Italian dressing mix and something in it gave the cream cheese a gooey texture.  I also tried making it with pumpernikel cocktail bread.  There are much better simple appetizer recipes out there.

These were delicious.  I didn't use as much dressing mix as called for, but the taste was perfect.  I tried "toasting" those little mini cocktail breads, but it didn't work out as good as I planned.  Next time, I'll stick with the untoasted bread and some triscuits.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are incredibly easy to make but are absolutely delicious.  A perfect summer appetizer.  I have taken these to several events in the past 3 months and have been asked for the recipe by at least 10 people. And they are not bad the second day....love them!

Super easy, indeed! And incredible flavors that really go well together. I followed the recipe but used sour cream instead of mayo as a personal preference. Dry dill weed works just fine, though fresh would be fabulous!! Great, easy addition to any appetizer table!

I totaly disagree with flowersandxandy4me.. Mayo and cream chesse go great together.  I make may dips this way.  You can also add sour cream with the mixture it changes but makes it even tastier..   I made this for a Christmas party.. My friend could not eat it because she is breast feeding.. (didn't know you coudn't eat cucumber breast feeding) Everyone loved it.. I used fresh dill and seedless cucumbers and added some onions for flaver and crunch also I left the spread in the frig over night.. The best part was the french bread.. Aww I loved it so much I am actually making them again as sandwiches for my birthday 3 days after Christmas.. I am going fishing and can't imagine a better snack.. Yay thank you so much

Thank you!  Just made it!  Delish!  Did a double-batch with one packet of seasoning.  Sooooo yummy!  Good thing I made a double batch, because with my "taste testing" there wouldn't have been any left for the guests!  :)

We do something like this every year for Christmas Eve so we don't have to cook huge amounts of food.  We mix ranch dressing and cream cheese (leave out the mayo). You can put it on any kind of toasted bread.

This recipe is excellent. It is very easy to make. I made it many times for parties/potlucks and everybody just loved it. It is gone before any other dish. Everytime I made this recipe, I made the spread the night before and assembled it an hour before serving. Thanks for a wondeful recipe.

I made these for a baby shower this past week-end but I had poured over so many recipes that I got confused and bought goat cheese rather than cream cheese. I wasn't about to make another trip to the  store so I made them anyway with the goat cheese and they were delicious! Nearly everyone in attendance was vegetarian and gave them that "Oh no, not another cucumber sandwich" look. Everyone raved about the bite of the goat cheese and the seasonings. (Whew!!)  Thank you for a goof-proof recipe. It will be a pleasure to make these again.

One of the best appetizers.  My sister and my best friend both always ask me to bring it over.  I just made one change which probably is what makes this recipe the bomb: use half the amount of dill and mix the dill in with the spread, do not sprinkle dill on top.

These were FANTASTIC! A great alternative to cucumber sandwiches. I combined all the ingredients the night before to let them really blend together. My guests devoured them and then asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! Refreshing! Pretty!
I served this as an appetizer at my dinner party with great reviews. I made fresh French Baguettes from this website as my base and it was great. I did use half of the Italian seasoning as it would have been too salty otherwise. I also had fresh little cucumbers from the garden on top which were delightful. My Mom made this 20 years ago and I forgot about them until I saw this recipe and I so glad I found it back. I won't lose this one.

Even more scrumptious if you let the flavors in the cream cheese mixture meld over 24 hours.  I liked using sour cream as a substitute for mayo, but that's just a personal preference.

These are great--especially with some fresh garlic mixed in before you spread it on the bread.

This recipe is addictive, you can't eat just one. I don't like dill so I omit it. I make the cream cheese with spices two or three days ahead of time then prepare everything just before the party. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I only used 3/4 packet of the Italian dressing packet.  it seemed strong at first but once the whole thing was thrown together, it was the perfect balance of all flavors.  I used fresh dill. Shaved cucumber on top really gave it a different look and was a big hit at my party. Thanks!!

We LOVE these tasty treats!  I like to use the "zesty" Italian dressing mix for an extra zing.  Also, the spread definitely comes together best if you let it sit for a few hours, even overnight.  Helps to blend the flavors more evenly.

I just made these for our Christmas Eve party, and they were a huge hit. Everyone loved them. I did one platter with cucumber slices, and the other with tomato slices. I used more fresh dill then called for which was delicious, the only thing I would change is less italian mix, and more fresh herbs. Tasted great!

I recently had a holiday party where the guests would bring an appetizer. I had 4 different appetizers on my list including this recipe. I made up the spread ahead of time but ended up not serving these because there was so much food already. I did however put these together the next day for a little snack and they are wonderful, light and refreshing and very easy to make. I wish I would have had the chance to serve these to my guests but I guess I'll have to wait until next time.

My best friend made these for a party. They were delicious, very refreshing but rich at the same time. My only suggestion for improvement would be to use fresh, rather than dried dill weed.

This is now a family favorite. I make sure to use fresh bread. To make ahead. I prepare the dip and slice cucumbers ahead of time. Then just put together. they are best when prepared right before serving. It is a nice light app for all types of meals.

Just as the other reviewers claimed, this recipe is great.  I have found that whipped cream cheese is easier to mix than solid cream cheese, but both taste excellent.

Make the crostini ahead of time and it helps save time on the day of a party. Good, easy but use fresh dill-- it's a much much better flavor!

This is the perfect shower food! I wish I could give it more stars because it was that good. I used the amt of c.chs and mayo but then added the seasoning until it was to my taste. Chilled overnight and then cut a baguette and layered with the rest... everyone loved it! Many asked for the recipe. Thank you!

Super yummy.  Got rave reviews.  Very fresh and light tasting.  Only used 1/2 packet of the salad dressing mix, then sprinkled a little more until the taste was right.  The local grocery store's bakery will slice the baguettes for free so don't forget to ask! I've made these several times and added a mint leaf one time and served alongside mojitos to drink.  Yumma-licious!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. To make it easier I put it on Triscuit crackers and it was still a hit.  I can only imagine how good it would be a baguette.

This was ok.  If I make this again I will cut down on the mayo.  For some reason the tast of the mayo overpowered the spread.  I have to admitt, my guest really liked them and asked for the recipe.  But personally I found the mayo was a little too much.

To make these, I sliced the bread very thin and drizzled some extra virgin olive oil over them, them put them in a 400 degree oven for six minutes--gets them nice and toasty!  Mixed dill in with the cream cheese to increase the flavor, then added mini shrimp and crab meat, and finished with a sprinkle of paprika.  They got rave reviews!

OHMYGOSH this one's a hit every time (different groups of people each time!).  Thank you Dianne!!!
Tip: I was in a BIG hurry one day and had the gal in the bakery dept. cut the french stick in half and run it thru the slicer for me...saved time and they were all evenly sliced.  Perfect!

Very yummy....I made them with both a french baguette and crackers.  The crackers actually went over better.  I also used buttermilk ranch in lieu of Italian & fresh dill instead of dried.  Everyone except those who don't like cucumbers at all loved these.

Thanks, Dianne,I made these for a recent dinner party, and they were all gone in a flash! The adults AND kids loved them.  I did two things differently. I ran a fork all the way down each side of the cucumber after it was peeled to make it decorative, then sliced it afterwards.  I also used grape tomatoes, sliced in wedges, and placed them on top to add color and a slightly different taste.

A delicious appetizer, every time I make these they are a hit. Good with crackers if you don't have time or ingredients to make the french bread rounds.

These were great.  I followed others' suggestions and toasted my bread.  Also, because I had it on hand, I made some topped with smoked salmon instead of the cukes and it added color to the presentation as well as variety.  Two appetizers in one!

This recipe was a big hit.  Very easy to make.  A local store slices up their day old baguettes and sells them.  That was much easier than slicing it myself.  Also, I had some extra spread left over and used it as a sandwich spread the next day for lunch.

I made this recipe for a holiday party and ended up with rave reviews and no leftovers. I followed the recommendations and topped each toastie with a small slice of red pepper - they looked like I had them catered in! Very easy and extremely tasty - I will make these again.

This has become a favorite of my family since the first time that we made it.  It is such a refreshing snack and so much better than chips and other high calorie junk food.  We make with fat free mayo and reduced fat cream cheese and it tastes just as good.  Thanks.

These were wonderful! I made them for a small group meeting for church and the ladies just raved! Very easy to prepare, simple ingredients, and an elegant presentation. These will most definately be served again! One thing, maybe I missed it, but definately toast the baguette slices before you assemble. Mine got a little soggy, but were still delicious.

I only use about 2 tablespoons of mayo and I add some chopped veggies like broccoli, carrots or red peppers to give it some color and taste.  I love this one!

Excellent recipe, very attractive on the plate.  A few hints, do not slice the bread on an angle, and get the smallest, thinest cucumbers you can find.  This recipe makes a lot of spread.  I will make this again it was a hit at a cocktail party.  Thanks for the recipe.

I catered a party for my friend and this was a huge success.  Definately a keeper.  This is a simple recipe.Cocktail rye bread is perfect in this dish if you don't want to use the baguettes.

This is an easy recipe, but the product looks very fancy for parties.  It tastes great too!  Just make sure to slice the french bread as thin as you can - when the bread is too thick, it makes it hard to bite into it.

Supper yummy!  These are very quick to prepare.  I brought them to a party and they were the most popular thing there.  I did find it easier to mix the dill in with the mix instead of on top.

This recipe is AMAZING. I have been using this for years. Every time i get invited to a party- every single person asks if i will bring it. i ALWAYS have some extra dip (my bad on my part, i never seem to buy enough bread) and my mother always asks for the remaining leftover to eat later at her house. So so easy to make! Thank you for this recipe!

This was a big hit on Easter.  Everyone loved it.  The mayo and cream cheese went together perfectly.  I did put the dill in the spread insead of on top.

i tried this recipe based on simplicity and reviews.  It is simply wonderful!  Although it makes a great deal of servings, there is never any leftovers as my family just loves them and snacks on them thoughout the day.  An excellent dish for gatherings.  I put this in my favorite recipe book!

This was a delicious healthy change for an appetizer.  We didn't have the Italian dressing mix so we added dill, basil, and garlic powder instead and it was still amazing.  

Our guy friends that normally eat wings, chips, and cookies loved them!

This was an awesome, easy, and well received recipe from all ages, including my picky teenagers! I used whole wheat crackers instead of bread to lower the calories (and leave more room for the main course). The cucumber was best when cut just before putting out for the crowd.  I will definitely use this more. I couldn't keep them on the plate!

I think next time I'll make with a ranch dip instead of the Italian, it just didn't match well overall with the dill flavor.

I used soft pumpernickle cocktail bread instead (personal preference) and the results were just awesome! Definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a big hit at our party.  A Norwegian friend thought it was a Scandinavian recipe and Indian friends thought it reminded them of an Indian recipe.  I agree that adding the seasoning to taste is a good idea.  Used dried dill in the cream cheese and fresh dill sprigs as garnish. Served on a chilled platter.

My niece made these at a family party. Everyone loved them as is including the four year olds.  I have also made the mixture, chopping up the cucumber and spread it on tortillas then roll and slice for rounds. Outstanding!

I made this for a pre-nursing school meet and greet and it was a HUGE success. I'm a guy and made it mainly so the ladies would have something other than the usual finger food to eat, little did I know it would disappear!  My only tweaks were that to keep the sodium down I used the salad mix until the salt level was right to our low sodium diet tastes and then finished off  the seasoning with Mrs. Dash Table Blends until the flavor was right.  Made for a very yummy appetizer that was low sodium as compared to making it with the salad mix which is crazy high sodium.

Easy to make, great tasting recipe. Used a sprig of fresh dill on each piece and it looks as good as it tastes. A great and different recipe that tends to impress people.

I made these for a bridal shower and they were the least taken/eaten. The ranch flavor in the cream cheese was a bit too strong for most.

This is something I take to all parties.  I use Ranch dressing mix and sour cream and party rye bread.  Never any left and I always double the recipe.  Going to try the Italian dressing once just to compare.  Sounds goods.

Such a simple recipe, but SO delicious!  This made a lot of filling so I used white bread with the crusts cut off instead of the baguette.  Thank you!

Great simple recipe you can make in a flash! I made italian dressing mix with another recipe found on this site and doubled the recipe. I made it all in the food processor and plan to use the leftovers in a pasta salad.

Everyone loves this snack and it's perfect for every occasion. Dill is  a lovely compliment to the cucumber, but if you don't have any, salt and pepper works just fine too. My favorite is using a baguette for this recipe. 5 stars!

Er, what provides the "toasties" in these toasties? I double checked, nowhere does it say to toast the bread! I did anyway. I skipped the mayo since I used whipped cream cheese and it comes out of the tub simple to spread. Thanks for sharing your recipe, we really liked these and can see using other veggies sliced thin for their crispiness in this recipe, too!

This dish is so easy to make and makes any guest happy! I made these for a Bridal shower I hosted and had to make some substitutions due to half of my guests being sensitive to gluten and/or dairy. I ended up using Tofutti instead of cream cheese, gluten free bread instead of baguette slices and it came out just as good! My non sensitive friends enjoyed them just the same.

Made these for a pot luck at school for a group of teachers and they did not last very long! They were quick, easy and delicious. While making them I couldn't help but sneak a few! I made the dip the night before so it would have better flavor the next day.

This was awesome, the only thing I did was cut back to half packet of ranch mix, just to cut down the salty taste, my preference.  My family went nuts over these and fortunately, we've had an abundant crop of cucumbers this year.

I just had this at a party on dark cocktail bread.  It is good.  I made it according to this recipe and it was just the same flavor.  My opinion is if you change the bread or toast rate the recipe according to the ingridents.  So I rated this a five.  I will use it again and again.

I have been using this same recipe for years.  I use garden cukes and prefer not to peal.  We also like to cut our cukes alittle thicker to taste the cuke.  Always use cocktail bread, but will try the baquette.

this recipe is called 'toasties', but nothing in the directions suggested the bread should be toasted. Did i miss something? I ended up placing the sliced bread under the broiler for a few minutes then proceeding with the spread and topping. Everyone commented on how delicious they were.

Very good. Recently had these at a family reunion. A relative gave me the recipe. I brought it home and made them for some of my neighbors in my apartment bldg. They loved it so I shared the recipe with them. I used the whole packet of seasoning mix and some thought it wasn't strong enough. Next time I will try the fresh dill with it. Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty! I made a few changes, though. I had Miracle Whip which I used instead of mayo. italian seasoning and garlic salt took the place of dressing mix and I also mixed a bit of lemon dilly dip mix into the cream cheese mixture instead of the dill garnish.

If I could give this more starts I would! This is the best appetizer. Quick, easy & delicious! Every time I make this to take to a party it's the first to be eaten up:) I came across this recipe a couple of years ago & have made it more than 2 dozen times. My family also makes it. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME recipe!!!

Definitely too much seasoning, I used what the recipe called for and ended up having to double the rest of the ingredients to tone down the seasoning. Didn't need as much mayo as the recipe called for. Added some fresh dill, which improved the flavor, and sprinkled some dried dill and a bit of paprika on top (thank you fellow reviewer that was a good tip) I think the seedless cucumber idea would've been awesome. My guests and I found the round crackers preferable to the french bread, though both were tastey. Will try it again sometime with a little more tweaking.

Very refreshing and would be wonderful on a hot day.  I took others recommendation and used sour cream instead of the mayo.  I also used garlic and herb flavored Italian dressing.  They were great!

Soooooooo good!  Picked up a loaf of french (italian) bread at Hy-Vee, sliced it up, broiled it on low, topped it with creamy mixture, add cucumber slices, and topped with dill - soooo good!!!  I forgot to add the italian dressing mix, and it was still good!  Makes a great cracker spread - yum!!!

This is great!  Because I live in a country where you can't buy Italian dressing mix, I instead added a little garlic powder, paprika, salt, basil, and a dash of olive oil.  I'll definitely make this for my next party!

I just use one brick of cream cheese (no mayo or sour cream added) and add a half bag of the zesty italian dry dressing.  Zesty is the key.  Mix the cream cheese and dressing together and let sit overnight to blend the flavors.  Than spread on deli sliced mini rye bread, sliced cucumber on top with dill weed and seasoned salt on top.  Yummy!

i also love cream cheese & green olives on good white bread, cut in triangles & cut off the crusts for a more appetizing look. years ago, i would get coloredun sliced  bread (don't remember where i got them) & slice the bread lengthwise. Then i would smear on the whiped creamcheese, & put sliced olives on some, marachino cherrie juice & chopped cherries, cream cheese & chopped pineapples, & any other number of things you could think of. then roll it up, nice & tight, & you might want to chill for a bit.  Then just slice as usual & triangulate them also. various colors were a boost.

As written, I would only give these four stars because as others have written, the topping is too salty with the amount of dressing mix in the recipe.  When backing it down by half, it is perfect (for us anyway).  We have served these several times at parties and they are always popular.

I made these for a wedding shower and everyone loved them.  I liked them but thought they were a little too salty (and I love salt!) so next time I won't use as much salad dressing mix.  Also, to lower the fat content, I used lite cream cheese and plain yogurt in place of the mayo.  I also added some dill to the cream cheese mixture.  These are very fast and easy to make, and it looks like you spent a lot more time and effort!

Perfect!  I was looking for something simple, easy and economical to add to my menu for my daughters wedding reception last summer.  Found this recipe and they were a huge hit.  We used a variety of crackers.  I gave out the recipe and now they show up at every bridal shower, baby shower, wedding reception or party I attend at my church.

This was a huge hit at my Christmas Party! The funny thing is, I used a ranch dry dressing mix!  I wrote it down wrong on my shopping list.  Still turned out great!  Followed all the other instructions.  Reminded me of little tea sandwiches! I didn't have any leftovers!!

This was a big hit at my x-mas party.  It's so easy and can be assembled ahead of time.  I used toasted pumpernickle cocktail bread.  I agree that full package of the italian style salad dressing would have been too much.  I used about 60% of the package.  Delish!  Will definetely serve it again.

I first made these for a bridal shower several years ago.  They are very easy, and look very good.  They have now become a favorite, and I am always asked to make them.  I almost don't want to confess how simple they are!

These were a hit at my party the other night. The only change I made was to toast the bread slices first. Dry Ranch salad dressing would be a good substitue for the Italian if you prefer.

This recipe is very easy to make and is well liked by everyone.  I followed someone's suggestion to use Melba Toast rounds, but I think the whole package of dressing mix is a bit much.  Someone has suggested using 12 oz sour cream and the whole package.  That sounds really good, and I'm definitely going to try it next time I make this!

This is great.  Easy and tastes great.  I did use melba toast instead of baguette.  I wanted something more crunchy.  I tried Toasteds, wasn't as good, but still o.k.  Used it for a party and everyone loved them.  Will definately use it again.  I also used 12 oz. of cream cheese and same amount of Italian dressing mix. Worked great, otherwise it would have been too much seasoning.

These came out sooo yummy!  I made the mixture around 10am and refrigerated it until about 2pm, toasted the french bread and then made up the little bites. I also put in about 1 teaspon of dill into the mixture.  Everyone loved it at the 4th of July party and I will make this one again!

I have used this recipe over and over with rave reviews every time, and have even been asked to bring it to bridal showers, luncheons, potlucks, etc.  I use the skinny baguettes and seedless English cucumbers from Costco sliced very thin and follow the recipe exactly.

Easy and delicious appetizer.  Perfect combination of cool and crunchy and creamy, and the dill adds just the right amount of zesty.  Be sure to buy 2 cucumbers-- I cut my cuke into 20 slices an had loads of the cream cheese mix left over, as well as plenty of baguette, which I enjoyed with butter.

This was a winner! I used baguette slices, toasted in the oven, and even the next day they were barely soggy. I also used half an envelope of dry ranch dressing mix, as I didn't have any Italian, and it was tremendous!

These were a hit at the baby shower I hosted. I would suggest toasting the bread slices first in the oven to crisp them up (be careful not to burn them) before spreading on the cream cheese mixture. I wouldn't make these too far in advance of your serving time. Also, if I made these again I would put less of the Italian dressing mix as it made the cream cheese mixture extremely salty.

These were fantastic!  I made these for my sister's bridal shower and they were everyone's favorite.  The only thing I did differently was add the dill to the cream cheese mixture like other suggested and topped each one with a sprig of fresh dill.

Made these for our flower party the day before my wedding. I didn't think people would like them (especially because of the crowd) but they all got gobbled up! They're a good 'grazing' snack.

I made this for a shower and it went over very well. I mixed it together the night before and added half (1 tsp)of the dill. The next day I spread it on cocktail rye bread and used seedless cucumber and sprinkled with the remaining dill. It was a big hit.

Best app ever! - use dried dill for sprinkle and very thinly sliced cucumbers.

The italian seasoning was a bit strong for my taste... When i make it again i won't use as much of it.  Other than that, it was very good!

There is absolutely nothing that I would change with this recipe. It's especially perfect for baby showers or gatherings. I sometimes make these for my husband as a pre-dinner snack.

This recipe was amazing - I made it on Easter Sunday and everyone asked for the recipe. I used chopped fresh dill instead of dried, adding a little into the spread as well as sprinkling some on the top for a pretty presentation! I also used an English cucumber as it is less watery. I also suggest making the spread the night before, and spreading it on the bread just before you serve so the bread doesn't get soggy. Will make again and again!

I made this for a baby shower for work. I made the dip two days in advance and assembled the sandwiches at work. It was easy because I made the sandwiches like a sub and then cut them in snack sizes. The only change I made was to mix the dill weed with the other ingredients and I also added smoked salmon to some of the sandwiches, yum! The spread went great with the cucumber and salmon on toasted bagel for breakfast. It’s a very easy and quick recipe and fool-proof. This will be my go to vegetable dip and spread.

These were really good, but I did make some minor changes. I toasted pumpernickle squares to make "crostini's" and spread the cream cheese mixture on top. I then layered a very thin slice of an English cucumber, and sprinkled fresh chopped dill.
Rave reviews from everyone!

This is one of my favorite appi's.  I make as per the recipe, but place a sprig of fresh dill on top of each toastie to make it pretty. :)  There is NEVER even one left when I take these to Girls' Nights In.

These are so easy and taste great! I used a small loaf of sliced, party-sized pumpernickel and they sure disappeared quickly at the party we attended. Oh, I also used an English cucumber. They're worth the price in my opinion. No big seeds and no peeling necessary. This is a fantastic tasting and very nice looking appetizer... thanks for sharing the recipe!

Fabulous recipe and so easy! I first used this recipe for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. I had extra of the cream cheese mixture so I used it as a dip for carrots and other veggies. Everyone wanted the recipe! I plan to use it many more times for upcoming showers, dinner parties and home shows.

YUM!  There is something addicting about this dish.  I used zesty flavored Italian dressing and had it on white toast (because I didn't have any crackers or other bread).  I had enough for leftovers and I think it tasted better the next day.  Would be a great dip for veggies, too.  I will make this again, thanks for the receipe!

Delicious!  These are so simple yet they look impressive and very pretty.  I used an English cucumber sliced very thin.  Instead of putting one slice on top, I staggered three slices, and it was a very nice effect.

I tested this recipe thinking it would be good to serve at my friend's baby shower. I was very pleased with it, but only used about 2/3 of the Italian dressing mix. The whole packet would have been overpowering. Excellent, easy appetizer!

This was just alright. It was very easy to make, but it was just so so. I probably won't make it again, unless I just want something easy that I don't care if anyone is impressed. Not bad, just average.

This really is very tasty, very attractive, and VERY easy.  Per another's suggestion, I used cherry tomato slices in addition to cucumber slices.  I do think I will try Melba Toast rounds next time to give some crunch.

These were fantastic- simple, quick and they taste great.  I used a little less mayo than called for and I added a little more Italian seasoning as well.  I can't wait to make it again.

We ate them all.  Delicious!!  This recipe got rave reviews.  I used melba rounds.  I found even the melba rounds started getting a bit soggy after 20 min.  Good this I only made about 20 at a time.

I thought this was pretty good.  I think you have to be careful with the amount of cream cheese mixture you put on.  If you put on too little, they are too dry.  If you put on too much, the Italian seasoning taste seems a bit too strong.  But when you get the proportions right, this is very yummy.  Thanks!

Very good! I made this recipe for a get together I was having with my girlfriends, and it was a hit. I served it on crackers, but i think next time I will try Melba Toast. Very refreshing!

Loved these!! Made these for the first time for an appetizer party on Christmas. Loved the freshness and I used fresh dill instead of dried. I served this on little round toasts and sliced the cucumber thin. Will make these again!

loved these, made them for a friends party and they were a hit even my kids loved them. I thinly sliced my cucumber and sprinkled dried dill on top I also added a small dabb of fresh dill in the middle which made it a little more attractive.

Have made several times now.  Mix cream cheese mixture and chill at least 3 hours before spreading on bread.  This is so VERY good.

My guests loved these!      They disappeared so fast, I almost didn't get to try one myself.  I lightly toasted the bread on both sides using the broiler.  I assembled them a few minutes before my guests arrives so they wouldn't get soggy.  Also, I sprinkles some fresh chives and fresh ground pepper on them - - yum!

Wonderful recipe. Make sure you put the dip on the bread and add the cucumber before serving. I thought it would get soggy so I placed everything seperately, and people were dipping chips into the dip. Its not as good on chips, so next time Ill put it together for them ahead of time. I loved this recipe.

The spread was good but it wasn't as popular as I thought it would be (I took it to a baby shower). My husband really liked it though. It made a whole bunch though so unless your making 50 don't make it all.

Wow, I took this to work for a holiday activity and everyone was asking for the recipe. The one thing I would differently is make sure the cream cheese is decently soft before I begin. I used Trader Joes Mini Toasts. They get soggy after a while but then they taste like mini cucumber sandwiches. So as an update to this, I've found that if I'm pressed for time and/or bringing it to a potluck that I know they will be sitting out for a while, I don't bother with the cucumber part. I make the spread and leave a box of crackers next to it and treat it as a spread instead. It also tastes great on bagels.

LOVE IT! We are doing South Beach so we use light mayo and light cream cheese.  Also, we use celery and cucumbers without the bread, which I have tasted it both ways and I think that it is much better without the bread! You can use any veggies and it would be great! We made it for a Bridal Tea and it was a huge hit, but my husband also loves it, so it's very universal.

I've made these twice now and people do seem to love them.  I just made them for Easter and people were trying to figure out what was in them.  I felt they didn't need to know how simple they were, so I just let them keep guessing.   If you put a little fresh dill on top of cukes at the end, they look like they were catered.

These were delicious. The only thing I changed was to use dry dill salad dressing instead of Italian. Really great!

Amazing!  Who would have thought that this combination was such a bit hit!!  I made these for an At Home Spa party yesterday and they were devoured!  Very light and delicious.  If you have trouble finding baguettes, the Pilsbury french bread works great.  I used that, used about 3/4 of the package of italian seasoning, skipped the dill and everyone still raved.  Definitely a keeper for any upcoming gathering.  So easy to make too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used the pre-sliced mini loaves of rye bread available near the deli counter and toasted each slice for a few minutes in the oven, without turning.  Then I spread the slices with cream cheese and topped with a thin slice or two of english (seedless) cucumber.  I also omitted the dill.  They were still wonderful and very well received.  I made teh cream cheese mixture the night before and just assembles the appetizers the day of the party.

This has been one of my go-to recipes for so many parties.  They are quick, easy and delicious.  The only changes I made are using reduced fat mayo and cream cheese to cut extra calories and fat.  These make great finger food.

This is an easy appealing appetizer.  I used triscuit crackers instead of the bread & garnished with another dollop of the cream cheese mixture, more dill & diced green onions.

I've made these twice now.  This first time they were too salty, so I added only half of the required amount of dressing mix the second time around.  Big improvement.  I would make this again.

served at a baby shower and loved by all.  I couldn't find baguettes at my store, so I used similar size bread. I think it was possibly a little bready, maybe sliced thinner would help.

These were very tasty and attractive. I used fresh dill instead of dried. I ate a lot of this before it reached the party it was intended for, I just loved it. I had leftover filling and I used as a dip for crackers later : )

These were so good!  Wouldn't change a thing except to maybe add a little piece of red pepper to the top of each cucumber to give it some color.

I made these appetizers for the children in order to broaded their horizons when it comes to food.  They all looked at them funny, but once they tried them, they liked them.  I think these little toasties have a wonderful flavor and a  beautiful presentation. Thanks for sharing!

We made these for an appetizer at my sister's baby shower.  We doubled the recipe because of the number of people coming.  Needless to say we ended up coming home with only 4 little pieces of bread which were consumed as soon as we got home.  Very delicious, very easy, Definately will make it again!

I made these to take to Easter dinner.   They disappeared in a matter of minutes.  Several people told me how much they like them and asked for the recipe.   I followed this recipe exactly except I topped them with the cucumber AND half of a grape tomato.   Very easy recipe...I will make these again.

Very good and very easy.  Served at a wine tasting party we were hosting.  Definitely mix the night before, needs the time to bring out the flavors. I spread on Carr water crackers. Made some with spread only,and some with chopped sweet red pepper and cukes, topped all with dill. Very colorful presentation. Makes enough to spread on the entire box of crakes with plenty left over. Works well as a veggie dip too.

This was fantastic! Simple to prepare, and a refreshing change to all the hot and greasy appetizers we usually have.  I get requests for this recipe all the time. I toasted some of the sliced baguette in the oven for a few minutes and it provided a nice contrast between the juiciness of the cucumber, and the crunch of the baguette. People seemed to prefer it this way. This is a keeper!! Thanks Dianne!!

Easy and tasty. My husband LOVED these things. My only problem with them is they are a bit salty. I cut the dressing mix but it didn't make that much of a difference. Otherwise, wonderful!

I spread this on cocktail rye.  It was just average, IMHO.  I made it as part of an appetizer buffet and had quite a few leftover.  I think using sour cream instead of mayo might have helped or using the french bread.

Simple, impressive, elegant!  I used a Japanese cucumber and sliced the bread and cucumber at a slant, served it to my RV camping group and got rave reviews.  Even my fussy husband ranted and raved.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I used the light rye bread that you use for appetizers and it was delicious. The only thing that I did differently is I mixed in the dill with the cream cheese mixture.  Easy and quick and I'll be making this for Xmas as well!

This was very simple and easy to make. I used small pumpernickel bread slices I found in the bakery instead of the French baguette.  I also used Cool Ranch salad dressing mix instead of the Italien.  I took it to a summer party and everyone really liked it.

I made these as appetizers for a dinner party, and they were absolutely wonderful.  My fiance really liked them on rye cocktail bread, although I prefer them on the baguettes.  I put half the dill in the dip, and then sprinkled the rest on top. Need to have another party so I have another excuse to make them!!!!!

This was a huge hit in the summer months--guests were very impressed and thought the appetizers were "classy".  You can even substitute fat-free or low-calorie ingredients and get the same great taste!

These are the best, I haven't meet anyone yet that haven't enjoyed them, they are so simple to mix up and cheap. I've made them for showers, recitals and just for snacks at home on a summer day. I give these treats five starts all the way around !!!

This recipe was very quick, but I thought it would have been better, not everyone ate it and I had left overs, but I did think it was good on crackers.

For as easy as they were to prepare, these were really very good.  I brough them to an office potluck, and I got complimented by almost everyone who tried them.  Very simple but very flavorful as well.  I used fat free mayo and reduced fat cream cheese, and I put dill in the spread in addition to that which I sprinkled on top.

i made these for a dinner party and not a single one was left by the end of the evening.  what makes that even more remarkable is that i had only invited TWO other guests (besides my husband and me).  now that says a lot!

I have used this recipe several times for get-togethers and it is always a big hit.  I use the tail sandwich bread slices instead of baguette slices and decorate the plate with lettuce.  VERY pretty and the kids like it as leftovers.

Great recipe!  Used zesty Italian dry mix. Thought that was what I read. I'll have to try the plain to see if it comes out better. Added to make it fancy smoked salmon and dill sprigs.

Was a bit strong with the Italian dressing mix but other than that delicious. Next time I’ll add more cream cheese or less Italian dressing.

I’ve made this a number of times for various get togethers and it’s always a hit!   I follow the recipe exactly with exception of toasting the baguette slices.   I would feel if the bread weren’t toasted, it would have a soggy texture to it.

Very easy, relatively inexpensive & attractive. I made  the recipe as written & used English cucumbers.  I used a baguette, although it would be good on crackers as well. I  liked the idea from the video of making “runnels” in the cuke to add interest. It makes s lot but I brought it to a party & there were none left!

The only think I did differently was to toasted the bread a pit under the broiler, just a 30-1 min on each side.  I let them cool and the prepped them.  They were really very good.  
*I've also sprinkled with fresh chopped parsley.

This was good. I put in garlic instead of the Italian herb seasoning and used clubhouse creamy dill seasoning instead of fresh dill since I did not have it on hand. Worked out good.

Our family has made these for years the exact same way and we love it. It never lasts long at a party, so I would never be concerned about anything getting soggy, and if it does, looks like people will still eat them anyway! We always use cocktail rye - it adds another dimension of flavor! Thanks for sharing!

Easy and SO delicious.  The video suggests a sprinkle of paprika and while it adds color I don’t like the flavor with added paprika.  This is a keeper recipe.

This is an light, refreshing appetizer. Incredibly easy . I opted to put it on crackers instead of the baguette. It is so good, you could probably even make it as a topping for cucumber slices with the dill on top. Mary ...8-8-2018

Overall, it was good.  It was also easy to make. However, I agree with one of the other reviewers that the ranch seasoning should be reduced.

This was an awesome addition to the menu of a bridal shower my daughter and I hosted.  It was so simple to make the day before and keep in fridge until ready to serve. I used a mandoline to slice the cucumbers and   I served with the already prepared crusty bread medallions one can buy in the supermarket.  It was so quick and easy that I keep the ingredients on hand, as a quick dip.

I made this recipe over last holiday. You have to eat these quick or they will get soggy over night, they are not meant to be stored in the refrigerator for any time.

This is an easy appetizer that kids and vegetarians  enjoy so I regularly bring it to parties.  I use rice crackers instead of bread because they don't get soggy as quickly. I also use the light Philadelphia Dill Cream Cheese spread instead of the mayo mixture. This makes preparation even quicker and easier.

Delicious.  Made for party and served on both rosemary sea-salt Triscuits and Italian herb large crouton-like breads.  Used fresh dill.  Used mayonnaise as directed.  Used half the Italian seasoning mix.  A family hit!

I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise, and I also took the suggestion to taste as I added the Italian dressing.  I spread the mixture on party rye instead of baguette slices.  Everyone loved it!!  Quick, easy, and light.

Wonderfully refreshing flavor with the chilled cucumber and easy to make.  I did toast the banquettes though and that provided a non-soggy/crisp that I think it needed. I tried it without mayo after reading previous reviews, but added it after finding the cream cheese to be too heavy alone. Added hellmans olive oil mayonnaise and the texture and taste was creamier and  had that little extra that it needed. I took it to a party that I didn't know was catered, everyone was asking catered for the recipe, lol.

So I did do some changes, opted for sour cream instead of mayo and put the S&P in the cream cheese mixture along with the dill. Sliced a french loaf on a bias and toasted it in a pan with butter. Was really good assembled, even better when I drizzled balsamic vinegar on the bread then spread the mixture topped off with the thinly sliced cucumber  (which I just used a peeler to make the slices)

I signed up to bring cucumber, cream cheese 50 sandwiches (cut in 1/4s) to my son's school pen pal tea party. Since I couldn't make them the same day of the party, I would make the sandwiches the night before. I couldn't find any recipes that wouldn't make the bread soggy the next day. I tested this recipe several days prior to the party, made a sandwich the night before and had it for lunch the next day. I used honey & milk bread, spreading it on both sides of the bread. The bread wasn't soggy at all. It was just as fresh as if I made it a few minutes earlier. I used 1/2 a packet of seasoning instead of the whole packet. It would be too salty, in my opinion for a full packet. My son liked it better as a dip. I used English cucumbers since they have less seeds and more flavor. It also tastes great on crackers, not premade. After 2 loaves of bread and doubling the filling, the sandwiches were a hit and no sogginess. Thank you. Will make again.

I kept all the ingredients the same and chilled the mixture overnight. Used a mandolin slicer to get the cucumber sliced thin. The only thing I changed was toasting the baguette slices in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit until it gets crispy to feel and then adding the rest of the ingredients on top.

Easy, easy appetizer that makes a nice presentation!  I used 1.5 tbsp. of the Italian dressing and scissored some fresh dill in with the mixture.  Let it sit in the fridge for part of the day.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and used a carrot grater to slice the cucumber thinly, rolled it on my finger and placed it on the bread.  I didn't care for this method because when taking a bite the whole cucumber tended to come right off.  So next time I will get a seedless cucumber and put a single slice on top (whether it's round or a decorative flower) or even matchstick strips going vertical would work.  I will definitely make this again!   It was great with the french baguette, but I will also try pumpernickel  and rye to change it up.  Also, I did use fresh dill for everything.

I love cucumbers and came across this recipe during the summer and decided to give it a try.  I am just now getting around to reviewing it.  These were delicious!  I served  them during a small gathering of friends at my home, along with some other finger foods and everyone raved about them.  This will definitely be a keeper recipe for me, especially during the Summer season.

Enjoyed by all at Bible Study. I used 8 oz of Whole Foods Cream cheese with garlic and chives with 1/3 cup of mayo (may use sour cream in place of mayo). To this mixture  I added:
only 1 teaspoon of dill. 
1/2 packet of good seasons Italian all natural salad dressing mix. 
1 green onion (green & white parts) thinly sliced with kitchen sheers. 
Mix these ingredients together and spread on sliced rounds of baguette bread that have been toasted toast in oven for 8 minutes at 375 degrees. This keeps the bread from getting soggy. Top with very thin slices of English (seedless) cucumbers.

I feel silly reviewing this.  I have made this a few times, and then have forgotten all about it.  Going through my recipe box, wow, there this recipe is, and I think I'll make this again next weekend for a gathering.  It's always a hit.  Easy, quick to make, and it always looks so nice.  I do like to make the cucumbers fancy, so I do twirl them into shapes.  I think that the cream cheese doesn't need all that mayo, so cut back on it.  The seasoning is to taste, I like a lot, but most people don't.  Fresh dill on top looks better, so try to use that if you can.  It isn't a terribly special appetizer, but it is easy to make.

Made these for a cookout. Big hit. Toasted pumpernickel and rye then cut to size. The next day I had a cucumber sandwich and used the unused mixture ( excellent). A definite keeper.  Thank-you

I will make this again to prove to friends and family that I can make a healthy snack.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat mayonaise, 1/2 of the seasoning mix, and Melba toast. I also ribbon cut the cuke and they came out beautifully.

It was so delicious! They were gone in under 10 min at the party. But be  sure to use American baguette.

I made the recipe exactly as written (with the exception of using pumpernickel cocktail bread) and it was wonderful. I brought these to a pool party with less than 20 people and there were no leftovers. They ate all of them and I got a lot of compliments on them.

Absolutely love this snack. I use Melba toast instead of the baguette sometimes and they're easy to do.

Received rave reviews when I served this to my family on Easter.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was because you definitely cannot use the entire Italian dressing packet.  Like so many previous reviews mentioned - be sure to taste as you go.  I ended up using a little better than half of a packet.  Otherwise, this was a fabulous recipe and it made a nice presentation.  I highly recommend it.

I've made these a couple times for a couple different get togethers. Super easy & fast to make. Always goes fast too. REMEMBER to add dill. It gives it that extra something.

I served this appetizer before Christmas dinner and they went quick! I love this recipe because it's not too filling and serves as a crisp appetizer. I did put the baguette slices with some olive oil in the oven for a few minutes to toast them before topping and it tasted great. I ran out of cucumber before I could top all of the baguettes so I spread some garlic and butter on the rest and put the remaining spread in a bowl and that went over GREAT. Very good recipe to serve as a quick appetizer!

This was delicious. I toasted the bread with a little olive oil and I added sour cream and a little milk vs. the Mayo (not a big mayo fan).

After reading the reviews, I made this for a Bridal Shower because it was easy and I thought it would make a nice appetizer on a warm day.  My sister, who can't eat anything without first adding salt, told me it tasted salty, and asked how much salt did I put in it.  I am guessing the salty taste came from a combination of the mayo & dry salad dressing.  In any case, this would have to be severely tweaked before I would make it again. It was basically a waste of time & money.

My family loves these! Only thing to be careful of, is don't put too much of the dry Italian mix in, or it'll be way too strong! Add it to taste really! But otherwise, this recipe is very good!

this was a really good recipe, but I think the entire pkg of dressing mix it just too much! I piped this into the mini toast cups also found on this site and placed a cucumber rosette inside each one w/ a spring of fresh dill... It wowed everyone at the tea party!

Excellent! Definitely cut the salad dressing mix to half because it will be much too salty otherwise. I made this for a shower, and people raved! I think it would also be excellent to put chopped cucumbers in the dip and serve with bagel or pita chips instead of making sandwiches.

This was really good and the best part being how easy it was to make...couldn't use dill weed though as it was too expensive for a teeny bottle...so I chopped tiny bits of the cucumber peel and placed over cucumber slices.  Also I used only half the Italian dressing packet as reviewers suggested.  On the day of big party I wil make double amount and place dip over melba  toast  or crackers.

i love this recipe. i only use 3/4 pkg of dry dressing mix. I make it the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors marry together. It is a light and refreshing finger sandwich I like to serve at showers or receptions!

I used half the amount of seasoning and still thought it was a bit salty.  However, the toast and the cucumber balances out the saltiness perfectly... I garnished with fresh dill sprigs and a small dash of paprika.

The flavor is so good.  I have yet to find a way around the soggy bread/cracker issue.  So the last few times I have made it, I have left the cracker/bread out for everyone to spread themselves.  Really great though.

This appetizer is always a big hit.  It's incredibly easy to make, inexpensive to shop for, and great for any size group of people.  I make it with light mayo and low fat cream cheese to reduce some of the fat intake, and it still always gets great reviews.  There is usually more spread than baguettes, but leftovers are great on bagels as well.

should be called 'creamy herb cuumber toasties'  The dressing mix is the most prominent flavor.  Because so many previous reviews did not make according to directions, neither did I.  Trmmed the edges of cucumber(peel is bitter), used Melba toast, and added dill to the cream cheese, and garnished with fresh dill.  Very easy to make (I like that for sure!!).

Good appetizer!  Make sure you spread a decent layer of the cream cheese mixture.  The original recipe calls for a thin layer, but you don’t get the creamy herb taste if you put it on too thin.  I used party rye bread instead of French bread, since I had some left over from our New Year’s Eve party.  Will definitely make this one again.

I have used this recipe several times now for various bridal showers and other events that required an appetizer. It has always been a big hit (I've seen people trying to secretly stuff a few more into their mouths as we were wrapping the party!)It looks great whether you use fresh dill or not, its easy to make, and it tastes good...what more do you need?

This was EXCELLENT!!  We had left-over dip here at work, so we ran out and bought a box of Ritz crackers.  That went great with them too!
Only one suggestion... you may want to keep a mint handy for after.

These are wonderful!  I'm not even a huge fan of cucumbers, but these are so good.  My sister made them for a ladies' lunch and they were a huge hit.  We didn't use dill (don't like it) and we used lightly toasted cocktail rye bread instead of a baguette, and everyone wanted the recipe!  We made the topping and prepared the cucumber the night before, but make sure to assemble these right before serving - they don't look great after sitting out a long while (not that you should have that problem unless you make way too many - they'll get gobbled up fast)!

Good and easy.  Made for a dinner party and had none left.  I used pre-sliced pumpernickel squares and toasted them and then added the topping.  Liked it better when the bread was toasted.

If you like cucumbers, these are additctive! I made them twice for a family BBQ and everyone (especially my four year old) loved them! I did toast the bread just a touch until it was crispy. Thanks for the recipe!

I was confused by the name "Toasties".  I wasn't sure if you were suposed to "toast" them, but I was doing a neighborhood party for 200 and didn't have the time to fuss.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 loaves of baguette bread which I had the bakery run through the slicer.  They looked terrific and I got several compliments on them.  We had extra of the spread, but then my helpers that did the spreading were men, and they didn't spread to the edge of the bread.  They were very tasty.  I would recommend them without hesitation.

This is a WONDERFUL appy recipe!  I used light cream cheese, and toasted the bread before assembling them.  I also used some red pepper, sliced very thinly, and fresh dill for garnish.  Thanks so much for sharing!  These are simply delish!

I love easy but tasty recipes and this is definitely both!  You can mix up the cream cheese mixture the day before a party then all you have to do is assemble them the day of the party.  I followed the recipe without any modifications and I had to refill the plate more than once!  Wonderful flavor to the cream cheese and the cucumber is a great crunchy topper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was GREAT!  I made the cream cheese mixture ahead of time, and then just put everything together that day.  My boyfriend's sister went WILD over these - so bonus!!!  Easy to make, yummy to eat.  Next time, I'll try with lower fat ingredients, only so that I won't feel guilty eating a ZILLION of them!  Thanks!

I made these tonight for a party.  I used cocktail pumpernickel and toasted it lightly before topping it.  I DO not usually like cumcumbers and I thought this recipe was AWESOME!!  I loved the flavors.  Thanks for sharing.

By far the best new appetizer recipe I've tried in years.  I've made these for 2 bridal showers, three picnics, and a couple times when my husband and I were just craving them.  The PERFECT summer appetizer!!!  Many, Many Thanks!

I made these for a cookout to test before making them for my daughters wedding reception. I used a package of dry buttermilk ranch dressing mix instead of the italian. I used fresh dill instead of dry. They were gobbled up in a flash. This is a keeper and so easy to throw together. Thanks for sharing Dianne :)

These were fantastic! I used a cheese slicer to cut the cucumber really thin - and if it came up too thin I just put two slices on the baguette. Very good recipe!

Dry ranch dressing mix can be subbed for the Italian. This is great spread on cocktail rye or pumpernickel too.

I liked the ease of preparation & they look pretty with the dill sprinkled on top of cucumber.  Although I did not sprinkle dill on each one, not everyone likes it.  I used mini loaves of pumpernickel & rye bread, found these by  the deli department in Shoprite.  I doubled the ingredients to make more of the spread. Next time though I would not put 2 whole packets of dry dressing mix in it was a little overpowering.

I made this to take to a baby shower, and it was a big hit.  It was very easy to make, and if I hadn't run out of time, I would have liked to add diced red peppers to add more colour.  I will certainly make this again, and we had lots left over to use as a veggie dip at home.  Delicious!

I was excited about making these, but I was a little disappointed with the results.  They were just ok.  Kind of bland.  I took them to a BBQ, and had leftovers.  Probably won't try them again. Sorry.

Used low-fat cream cheese, English cucumber, fresh dill, added finely chopped red bell pepper, some shredded carrot, only 2 tbsp mayo, chilling for several hours.  Wanted to try-out before taking to gathering.  My husband, who eats everything, didn't even try them.  Made some the following day but toasted bread.  Liked it better with a little crunch.  Nice presentation but not sure if it will go over well.  Doubtful that I'll make this again.
