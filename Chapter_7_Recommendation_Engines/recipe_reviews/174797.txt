This was a very cute cake. The only problem I had was the cake was a little crumbly when I frosted it.  I might freeze it next time.  I made it for my son's 3rd birthday party.  He loves pirates.  Arrrr!

I used the White Butter recipe for this and it came out great!  Brought it to work as we were having a Pirate theme Halloween this year and everyone loved it!!  So creative!

So fun!  This was my first time making a cake in any other shape than the regular old cake pans, and I think it turned out great!  The diagrams were easy to follow and overall pretty simple to complete.  I took the good advice of another reviewer and slightly froze the cake before frosting to prevent crumbs from mixing with the icing.  The only adjustment I had to make was I needed TWO cans of white icing... when I mixed the leftover chocolate with the white, it was way to dark to be skin colored, and wouldn't have been quite enough either.  I also substituted cut marshmallow for the gum for the teeth- worked great!
