SOOOO GOOD!!! I didn't have cardamom, so I used half cinnamon and half nutmeg to replace it and it still turned out so delicious. Poured it into a dish and froze it and my friend and sat and devoured the entire thing with two spoons. I also used sweetened condensed milk, i assumed the recipe called for that. Added a bit extra cinnamon just cause I like lots of it, but this turns out like a smooth artesian ice cream!!!

Good recipe  - this is much more authentic than the other one on this site with bread in it.  Also, I did not add the sugar - it was sweet enough with the condensed milk.  I simmered for longer than recommended to make it richer.  It was delicious.

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have saffron but love the cardamom taste.  Was really a yummy and delicious treat for sure.

Made this for an Indian dinner party and it turned out well. Left out the saffron and didn't add any extra sugar. I froze it in mini-cupcake trays, one metal and one silicone, covered with aluminum foil. The silicone ones turned out more even and also were much easier to pop out of the form.

WOW - it tasted like an artisan ice cream, so rich and creamy and fragrant with cardamon but very easy to make. Everyone asked me for the recipe. This will be a regular from now on. I might half the sugar next time, or not add it at all.
