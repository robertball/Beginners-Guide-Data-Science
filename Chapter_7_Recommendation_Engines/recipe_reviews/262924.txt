Well, somehow making stir fry in the pressure cooker didn't seem quite right, and mine did end up with quite mushy vegetables.  But I did put it on for 16 min instead of 12 - I guess because I made 1 1/2 recipes so I thought it might take longer?  I rated it 4 stars for flavor however.  Not sure how the other reviewer ended up with dry meat; I had so much liquid, and not enough time to reduce it as much as I wanted, so it was very stew-like.  I used half the sugar, which was plenty.  What I learned from this recipe was the garlic!  Roasting a whole head of garlic (or 1 1/2 in my case) in the oven and then adding it all to the meal was delicious!  I probably doubled the ginger, which was still mild.  I also added more than a little oil - probably 1/3 - 1/2 cup lard.  The meat had no fat so it needed it.  I don't think this recipe created a time savings over stir-frying, since you had to reduce the resulting liquid.  Next time I will probably just stir-fry it, but keep all that garlic & flavor!  My meat came out very tender, which was great, and I do wonder if I'd need to pressure cook the meat to get it that tender quickly.  Perhaps I'll pressure cook the meat and stir-fry everything else, when I make it again.

Taste was good but beef was dry.  Not wasting steak on it again.
