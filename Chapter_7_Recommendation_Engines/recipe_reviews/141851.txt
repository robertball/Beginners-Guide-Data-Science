I've been looking for a sweet & spicy nut recipe that doesn't use butter or egg whites (so they'll keep longer)...and this one is really nice!  I added 1/2 teaspoon salt and I'm glad I did.  I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 teaspoon based on other reviews, but then it was barely detectable at all.  Next time I will definitely add the full 1/2 teaspoon...and I'm not one for a lot of cayenne.  I reduced the oven temp down to 325 degrees to try and avoid the burning that other reviews mentioned, but mine still burnt a bit on the bottom.  Next time I'll lower it down to 300 degrees and check them at 12 minutes instead of 15.  I also used parchment paper (not foil) and had no problem with the nuts sticking.  I plan on making these again for holiday gift giving...Thanks!

These make an AMAZING salad topper!  I added in a few pinches of sea salt, ended up with a sweet, spicey & salty treat!  Perfect on my baby spinach salad, with a homemade honey, bacon and mandarin dressing, red onions, mushrooms, and crumbled goat cheese....Mmmmmm mmmmm!!!!! Friends say it's straight out of an upscale restaurant :)

These were EXCELLENT and really easy. I have another recipe that is much more complicated. I followed others' comments and added 1/2 tsp salt and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper because my family does not like spicy food. Also, I would recommend spraying the aluminum foil with cooking spray.

One of the best pecan recipes I have tried.  I don't like egg whites and this was just what I was looking for.  These are a great post-workout snack and I use them on my salads.  Yummy!  One note - you must let them carmelize in the oven or they will turn out grainy.  They won't burn if you keep an eye on them! I stirred them every few minutes after the sugar started to brown.  If you take them out too soon, they will be grainy!

What a great taste!  I can't stop eating these pecans.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar and (hopefully) reduced the calories.

Easy and fast.  I added cinnamon to the sugar mixture and sprinkled sea salt over the pecans before putting them in the oven.  I put them in for 15 minutes exactly and they came out slightly burned. I would recommend 12 minutes

Excellent!  I added 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla, then added 4 dashes of ground cloves and nutmeg. Quick, easy and delicious, and I'm making for 3 families at Christmas! Thanks for the recipe, this one's a keeper!

This was very good.  I didn't use as much cayenne because the people I was making this sald for didn't like spicy food.  Next time I would lower the temperature to 300 because some of the smaller, thinner pecans were overcooked and burning after 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Also, some became glazed (caramelized) and some didn't. I will definitely use this again for my next salad.

These are really good! I used walnuts, it was what i had. So easy, I didn't heat til boiling.  I just warmed the mixture till sugar dissolved.  Next time, I will just skip the stovetop step and mix everything together and put in oven.  I followed the exact recipe and these are very yummy.  I can't stop eating them.  If making for more than yourself, double or triple this recipe.  Will make again, so simple.  If your worried about the spicy factor, don't. They are just well flavored.  I don't like things too spicy, so these were perfect.

So many of the glazed nut recipes call for egg white. I simply didn't want to be bothered. So I chose this one. Then I started playing...added some salt, sprinkled in some cinnamon...Sneaky hot sweet nuts. Yum. They've been referred to as the "devil" nuts because you can't stop eating them.

Just the glazed pecan recipe I was looking for! Easy and tasty, but I used 2 TB water and 1/8 c sugar to avoid the cloudy, sugar clumping. Just a sweet sheen on the pecans.Thanks!

These were wonderful! Very easy to make and a hit with everyone. I only used 1/4 tsp. of cayenne (it still had a kick) and 1/2 tsp. of salt for that salty/sweet flavour. They were great added to a salad of mixed baby greens, blue cheese, strawberries and raspberry vinaigrette. They are also perfect as a snack with your favourite cold drink.Very crunchy & fresh!

I was going to give this 4 stars because at first they taste uninteresting and it was difficult to get them all covered.  BUT, as I sat down to write the review, I could not stop eating them!  A little too spicy for me (and I like spicy), but my tongue will just have to suffer.  These are addictive.  Somebody take them away, please . . .

Was looking for something quick and easy and came across this.  So easy and everyone in my family loved.  I finally had to hide some from my grown boys so I could add to my salad, the whole purpose of making these.  Starting my 3rd batch already.  Only takes about 30 minutes total.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  So easy...so delicious!  I doubled the recipe, added cinnamon (one of my favorite spices) and salt as suggested....fantastic!  These are not bland at all as one reviewer reported.....perhaps the cayenne pepper was old and lost its punch?  I lowered the time and temperature as suggested, and stirred them once while baking.  I used heavy duty foil with no problem.  Definitely making these again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I added these pecans to a salad last night and they were wonderful !    Even my husband who's not crazy about pecans liked these in a salad.  Its the mix of the sweet/hot that makes it.   I will make them again.

I made these for Christmas and served them with a salad of greens, sliced green apple, thinly sliced cheddar with a raspberry vinaigrette from this site. I did reduce the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and the mixture dried out when cooking (perhaps because of our altitude?), so I just added a little bit more water. Otherwise, it worked perfectly and I loved it. My kids actually ate these too and they are very picky.

This is so easy and delicious - just make sure you let the sugar carmalize before adding the pecans or you get a bit of a grainy texture to the coating.  Delicious!

This recipe is not my favorite.  Maybe I baked them too long but the pecans turned out a little too crispy and they tasted bland, even with the cayenne pepper.

I'm giving 5 stars even though I changed it according to reviews and what I had on hand. My version would rate 4 stars. I used chilli powder because I did not have cayenne. I added a dash of paprika, 1/4 t cinnamon, 1/4 t vanilla and 1/2 salt. I used 2 T of water and cooked the 'syrup' in the microwave at 30 sec intervals. I baked in a convection oven @ 300 for 12 min stirring at 6 min. I sprinkled with additional sea salt when done. I'm sure I will make these again but with the cayenne and I will leave out the cinn and vanilla.

Fantastic. The cayenne adds an unexpected kick and a whole different dimension to the flavor.  I added a pinch of cinnamon.

This is a yummy and easy recipe. I tripled it and followed as directed for my first batch, then for my next batch I added vanilla extract which gave it what I thought was missing. It is easy to change it up, depending on what you are looking for. I think I will try adding cinnamon next time. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

My husband and I LOVE these.  I make them using Splenda in place of sugar and they are still wonderful.

I incorporated the comments from others and included the 1/2 tsp sea salt. I typically give these out as christmas gifts and make both sweet and spicy depending on the person. I mix up everything but the cayenne over medium heat plus add 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tap nutmeg. After heating up I split in half and then add the full 1/2 tsp cayenne. Always a favorite!

This is fantastic!!  I added ½ tsp each Kosher salt and cinnamon, and reduced cayenne to ¼ tsp, as suggested in other reviews.  Also increased water to 1 ½ Tbs to thin the glazed slightly which helps keep it from hardening before all the nuts are coated.  My last alteration was to substitute turbinado sugar (Sugar In the Raw) for white sugar to give the glaze a more complex flavor.  At 350 degrees for 12 minutes each batch turned out perfectly.  I hope all the people getting these nuts for Christmas gifts from me like them as much as I do!

This time, I doubled the recipe, used Demerara sugar, adding 1/4 C more after doubling the amount of sugar. Also, added 1/2  tsp salt. I made it in a large pot, so the sugar mixture boiled quickly. Take care not to burn the mixture like I did last time. The large pot made it easy to quickly dump in the pecans, mix until well-coated without pecans spilling out. The sugar mixture is H.O.T. Dump the coated pecans onto a large rimmed cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. We live at 7500’ and the 350f oven at 15 was still good. Next time I will try sprinkling with coarse salt. 

 Easy, quick, yummy!

I halved this to try, and they came out very good. I liked the fact that they did not contain egg whites. I used parchment paper and transferred to a new piece while pecans were cooling. I did add 1/4 tsp of salt as a reviewer suggested, and it added to the flavor. Even though I stirred a few times while baking, there was a tinge of burning after 15 min. Next time I'd take them out a few min earlier (or lower oven temp?)  I like to add these to a spinach salad with dried cranberries and blue or goat cheese. I also like the suggestion of adding vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, etc which would be nice for Christmas gift-giving. Thanks for this great recipe!

Very tasty, and so easy to make. I like to add a little more cayenne though. It also benefits from a pinch of salt and a bit shorter baking time.

Second time around! I increased the water to 2 tablespoons as suggested by another reviewer which eliminated the clumping.  Added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I also sprinkled on 1/2 teaspoon of coarse sea salt right before baking for 12 minutes.  Reduced cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon. Turned out perfect!!!

By reading the other reviews because I like my stuff spicy or add an additional half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper even though I made a double portion. I also added salt which helped the flavor along a lot. They taste really good. I just would have rather them have more of a smooth glaze vs a crust.  by reading the other reviews, because I like my stuff spicy, i added  an additional half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper  because  I made a double portion.

But considering how much I pay for some at Trader Joe's, it's more economical for me to make them at home and I will definitely be doing that again in the future!

Delicious, easy, and so addictive. Perfect for a holiday party. I used 2 teaspoons more water, added a pinch of cinnamon, simmered the leaves from a sprig of fresh rosemary with the sugar and water, and baked the nuts  10 minutes longer. Loved!

The pecans turned out great. I used them as a topping for a salad of baby arugula, spinach, and cherry tomatoes, with an olive oil-based dressing. The sweet and spicy pecans went very well with it.

Adjusted recipe for 3 cups of pecans. Added salt, as suggested by reviewers, full measure of cayenne, and baked at 300 for 15 minutes. No problem with burning. Only problem I had was when I removed saucepan from heat and started stirring in pecans. Mixture hardened up almost instantly which made it tough to coat pecans. Next time I will add pecans at end of 2 minute boil, then take off heat. Still delicious even with that hiccup. Took sample to neighbors. 15 minutes later they knocked on back door asking for recipe!

I would have given it 6 stars! I also followed what other reviewers did by adding the salt and I also added some fresh ground pepper. I reduced my oven temperature to 315 thinking I didn't want them to burn. My oven must be on the cool side because I cooked for about 7 extra minutes and the nuts were still a little tiny soft. However, I made a double batch. My husband and I ate them on the salad and then ate almost all of them before i could put them in an air tight container to save them! They are absolutely easy and DELISH! Thanks for the recipe!!

Easy and delicious.  Tossing these onto a salad makes it a salad people will love -- great crowd pleaser for having company over.
