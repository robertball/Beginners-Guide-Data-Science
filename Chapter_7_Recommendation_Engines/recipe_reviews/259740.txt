I made this for a potluck where about a 100 people showed up. I used 5 pounds of a cut up butt roast. Could not find New Mexico Chilies so I used a Black (Negro) dried chili.  I regret not pulling some out before taking to the potluck. Very good, just the right spiciness. Served on flour tortillas.

we are new mexicans and have been enjoying carne adovada forever. what's not to enjoy about marinated pork braised in chile colorado. i looked to get an idea on the time in the IP. i did in pot-in-pot so i used 30 minutes, bouncing off the 20 minutes shown for braising in the pot. with p-i-p i can keep the direct liquid down.
of course carne adovada can be done a million ways, but USUALLY i chunk and marinate pork shoulder for several hours or overnite, brown it, braise it, then refrigerate it for the next day [common for braises] and serve it in chile colorado made up seperate, tho it usually includes the braise juices and is thickened with the braise vegetables INSTEAD OF FLOURING THE PORK AND MAKING IT STICK WHILR BROWNING [better taste too].

try this with costillas [pork ribs]! instead of chile colorado, sauce it with mole poblano or green chile.  great in ALL WAYS.

don't forget the homemade beans, either pinto or black.

This was my first InstaPot recipe and it turned out great! I used Papatillo dried chiles, I was told they are the least hot ones. I had never used dried chiles before, it was a surprise to see how good & authentic it tasted. That being said, if I wanted to take a shortcut, I would try to buy a ready made sauce and skip the whole soaking the chiles and using the blender. 
One thing this recipe didn't mention, but I added a cup of water to the pot before cooking, then I cooked it for 20 minutes and the gravy and meat turned out perfect. My cooker defaulted to 1 hour when I hit the stew setting, but I'm glad I made the adjustment for only 20 minutes or I think it would have overcooked. I used the flour to dredge the meat, it took awhile but I think it added a good consistence to the gravy and more texture to the meat. Overall, a great first experience, my husband loved it too.

The only thing I added was to de-glaze the pot with red wine before putting the meat and sauce back in. Served with Mexican cabbage pico de gallo on flour tortillas.

I'll be making this again and again! I think I'll omit the flour next time,  had a few problems with that but overcame in the end. Great flavor! This was the 1st time I've worked with dried chili's and couldn't be more pleased.

My first Instant Pot recipe. Had lots of problems with `burn`. Next time I will try to avoid buildup on the bottom of the pot by either sautéing in a separate pan and/or not using flour. The dish itself was delicious!

Other notes: I found dried New Mexico peppers in the Hispanic Foods section at my local supermarket. I also used the Instant Pot to heat the broth for soaking them.

I sautéed the pork shoulder in a cast iron skillet to avoid any burning issues that some other people have had.  This is the first outing with the pressure cooker and it turned out perfect.  I had a 6 lb. pork shoulder so I increased the liquid to 6 cups and had no problem with burning.  Plenty of leftovers for later on.  Instead of putting onions in the sauce, we used them as a garnish and it was great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very flavorful. I didn't have New Mexico peppers, but small, dried Japanese red peppers gave it a lot of heat. It made a lot of sauce for the amount of meat, so leftovers became a soup.

I sprayed the  pot with cooking spray and omitted the canola oil to reduce calories. Followed advice of someone who had made it and poured a little red wine into the pot to deglaze  it and stirred up all the browned bits before adding the meat back into the pot with the sauce. I had read that the newer pots were very sensitive an d could give you the burn warning if you did not de glaze the pot. So that worked for me.  Meat was so tender, this was my first meal cooked with the instant pot, so lots of experimenting to do.

Only thing I would change next time is not adding the chipotle option. The chipotle over powers the other flavors. Also, I don’t have an instant pot so I used my oven. Cooked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.

This recipe does notwork.  It sends the instant pot into burn mode.  Then you try and fix that but finally give up and serve it.  Its done and safe to eat, but not pressure cook.  The gross stuff didnt go away and thats no way to eat a taco.  Go back to the lab.

I tweaked it a bit and didn't use flour (that's not really part of the authentic Mexican recipe so not sure why add it to this one). I found that unnecessary.  However, this recipe might not be best for instant pot as it continuously said "burn" even though at one point I took it out of the instant pot, completely washed the pot, put it back in and tried to start it all over again and it still said it after about 2 or 3 tries. I think I'd rather do this particular recipe in the crock pot to avoid it sticking to the bottom.  Flavor was good but there was something missing. I think I'll add that secret Mexican ingredient next time as well... ;)
