I make these every Christmas and Halloween!  I use a fairly big dollop of peanut butter right in the middle of the cracker and when I top it with the other cracker I smoosh them until the peanut butter is at the edges.  I also use almond bark with a teaspoon of shortening, rather than chocolate chips.  It microwaves great and the shortening makes it smooth and easy to dip.  
Another tip: Make sure that you get off every bit of excess chocolate or they will be sitting in a little puddle by the time they cool and won't be as attractive.  
One more thing: These are so easy to decorate!  I always use holiday sprinkles, applied right after I dip them while the chocolate is still shiny.  Alternatively, I put a little chocolate of a contrasting color (white chocolate if I dipped the cookies in milk chocolate, or vice versa) into a baggie and melt it in the microwave.  Then I snip off just the barest corner and squeeze it back and forth over the cookies to make a nice pattern.  OR I buy candy food coloring and turn the white almond bark whatever color I like!  
Hope these tips help someone!

I make these every Christmas but for the life of me, I couldn't remember their other name. This is really cost-effective to make (especially when you coupon and get crackers, baking chips and peanut butter for cheap!) and it's also kid friendly. The flavor of these is almost like a Butterfinger. These always are the hit of any cookie tray and I always get asked for the recipe (and really, I've had people shocked when they find out really what's in it) so make sure you bring paper copies of the recipe. This bends to whatever kind of peanut butter you have, wether it's chunky or smooth, and whatever baking chips you have on hand. You don't have to have a double boiler, you can melt the chips in a microwave safe bowl 40 seconds at a time, stirring well at the end of every 40 seconds until it's the right consistancy. I recommend you use a name brand peanut butter if you can, only because with some cheaper peanut butters, they can get liquid-y and sometimes seperate and it's not pretty. This is also good with peanut butter/marshmallow fluff or peanut butter/Nutella. It really is super bendable and really fun to play with. Even adding a teaspoon of extract, like peppermint, to the melted chocolate is a whole other way to make it different. NOTE: You should guesstimate that it's one bag of chips per sleeve of crackers. That's how it usually works out for me.

A trick I have discovered....put a stack of crackers spread out on a kitchen towel, then fill a pastry/icing bag with the peanut butter and squeeze a dollop of peanut butter on each cracker (the towel keeps them from scooting all over the counter), top with second cracker and dip.  I also melt the chocolate in my electric fondue pot.  Use low setting and it works great.

We have a recipe very similar to this.... only differences are we call ours Ritz Cookies, and use chocolate almond bark, white has been used too, but family likes the chocolate best. The almond bark is smoother, coats easier, and hardens nicely.

I've been making these for years with wonderful results.  My family has comapred them to the Girl Scout Cookie Tag-a-longs.  Supper easy to make and are especially special to recieve.  You can even make them look more festive looking by drizzling some white chocolate on top.

A favorite treat of my Brother In Law.  Made some with peanut butter and vanilla almond bark, also some with Nutella and chocolate almond bark. The Nutella is my favorite!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

Oh my gosh!!! Being the wife of a hockey goalie, I couldn't resist making these because of the cute name and the ease of ingredients and preparation. What a treat!! These came out so good... whoever reviewed them before and said that they tasted like the Girl Scouts cookies Tagalongs, was right on the money!
Thank you for such an easy and tasty recipe that will keep my hubby and boys smiling for a long time!

We always make these around Christmas time.  We always use chocolate almond bark because the semi-sweet tastes too bitter/dark.  So good!

I made these and liked them very much. However I found them to be very salty it maybe the cracker that I used (regular ritz). I think next time I will use the reduced sodium ritz. Thanks
Oh I also used chocolate almond bark instead of the chocolate chips.

Very easy recipe.  The semisweet chocolate didn't seem sweet enough with the salt of the crackers and peanut butter.  Next time I will try milk chocolate.

These are great, but better is you mix the peanut butter with a little MARSHMALLOW FLUFF before spreading (in my opinion.)

I've been making these with my grandmother every Christmas since I was old enough to hold a fork. The only difference is that we would put peanut butter on one Ritz cracker, then marshmallow fluff on the other. We make and dip these and buckeyes at the same time, since the chocolate is already melted... Wouldn't be Christmas without them.

Oh my are these ever addicting not to mention absolutely delicious! I found I needed to add butter to the chocolate to make it smoother and to add a little shine. I did half with crunchy PB and half with a spicy PB. Just about anything goes with this recipe....jam, marshmallow creme, hazelnut spread, almond butter, cashew butter etc. Who thought such a simple idea could be so darn good?! Thank you so much Denyce!!

These are fantastic, but I do make a few changes. I prefer to use chocolate almond bark as it's got a smoother texture. Second, I like to spread one cracker with peanut butter and one with marshmallow fluff before sandwiching them together. Wonderful treats!

I make this recipe every year, it's been a tradition since I was a kid. We have used almond bark melting chocolates in the place of semi-sweet baking chips or Baker's brand melting chocolates. Simple and easy to do, even the kids have fun helping in this area by putting the peanut butter on the crackers and sandwiching them together.......

Is now a new staple in my list of holiday goodies. I made some with just PB or Nutella or PB and Fluff. The plain PB ones were my favorite. Will try with milk or white chocolate next time. Used semi-sweet cause I had it on hand and they were a bit too bitter.

These sound disgusting, but are so good! I make them every Christmas. Never knew they were called "Hockey Pucks". We always just called them "those good cookies".

My grandfather started making these one Christmas for the family, and I have been the one to carry on the tradition!  We make these with chocolate almond bark and I probably eat an entire batch by myself over the season...SO DELICIOUS!!

Love these!  You can also use the peanut butter Ritz Bitz for bite-sized treats!  I added Christmas sprinkles on top and they were a hug hit with everyone!

These were good & they do remind me of the Girl Scout Tagalong cookies. Next time I think I will mix in some powdered sugar with the peanut butter to change the texture and make it sweeter.

This was one of the most popular treats at my office holiday potluck. I used colored candy sprinkles over all the pucks before the chocolate set to make them look festive and cheerful. I was asked for the recipe over and over. I tried melting white chocolate chips to make tuxedo pucks, but the chips didn't melt correctly. The semi-sweet baking chocolate melted perfectly in the microwave and was rich, but not too sweet. I used low-sodium crackers to avoid over-saltiness. An additional note - if you have a very oily or creamy peanut butter, the cracker sandwiches can get really messy. Next time I will let the peanut butter get a bit more solid in the fridge before beginning the assembly process.

I love these! They are a family favorite!! I made these last year for a get together and all my friends wanted to know how to make them! I usually make mine with chocolate almond bark. I melt the chocolate almond bark in the microwave for about 1 minute, stir and put back in for 30 seconds or until smooth. I then dip the cookies into the almond bark, if the chocolate starts to thicken just throw it back in the microwave. I then let the excess chocolate drip off and place on foil to harden. Delicious!!

These are really good with white chocolate coating. I haven't tried them with the semi-sweet. These are so simple to make, but everyone loves them and is shocked when they learn the "cookie" is actually a cracker!

These were yummy and fun to make with kids. I took the advice of many  and used chocolate almond bark, which is easier to melt and dip.   These taste a lot like Butterfingers.

I add a twist to these once in a while.  I put jelly/jam or i use chocolate spread with fluff.  You could pretty much do almost anything inside of this quick recipe.

These are loved by everyone who tries them!  As previously suggested, I melted the chocolate in my fondue pot and to make the chocolate smoother/easier for dipping, I added some heavy whipped cream that I had on hand.  I made these and the "Fudge by Dana" all in one day with the fondue pot, and loved that I didn't have to turn on my oven at all. :-)

I made these today using chocolate almond bark instead of chocolate chips.  THEY WERE AWESOME!!!  The almond bark melted in about 2 min. in the microwave.  I used a decorating tool to pipe on the peanut butter which was easier than spreading each cracker with a knife.  I speared a cracker sanwich with a fork into the peanut butter middle and dipped it in the chocolate and made sure it was good and coated, then used another fork to gently push the treat off onto a rack to drain and set.  The coating was the only tedious part but I found this recipe to be very easy and yummy!  There are so many ways to change it up and make it different each time.  Next time I will try white almond bark, or chocolate frosting on one cracker and peanut butter on the other and sandwich those together before coating, add sprinkles, anything really!  I will make them again and again!  Thanks for a great but simple and impressive treat!

These cookies are so easy and delicious! The only change I made was using milk chocolate in place of the semi-sweet. Perfect combination for those of us who love their salty peanut butter but also love their sweet chocolate. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and a nice treat for the kids.  I used brown sugar-cinnamon Ritz crackers, i would not recommend them. The cinnamon overpowersteh peanut butter. But had I used the right crackers, these would have been wonderful. I'll be making these with the right crackers again soon.

Everyone liked these!  I used low sodium Ritz crackers and thought they were perfect.  The only problem was coating the sandwiches in chocolate - it took FOREVER.  But it's worth it, and I'll definitely make them again.

OMG!! So simple I had my young daughters assemble as an activity to keep them busy.  So good, they were hard to stop eating.  I used 36 crackers or 18 cookies total and used a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips that I just melted in the microwave and dipped the sandwiches in while using 2 forks to hold onto.  Just the perfect amount of chocolate.  Sprinkled with decorative sprinkles.  I have got to try these with rasberry jelly and/or marshmellow fluff.  So additive.

These are so easy and so delicious. These turn out pretty rich and and perfect for a holiday cookie tray. I would love to try these with grahams crackers next time and be more like s'mores. A co worker has made these every year for the Christmas and I always liked them, now I have the recipe too. Thanks!

The flavor of these was great!  I topped with red and green sprinkles for Christmas.  I would change the chocolate mixture a bit, however.  I melted 12 oz. butterscotch chips, 12 oz. chocolate chips, and half a block of paraffin (wax for candy making) in a double boiler, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth.  The mixture turns out very silky, and stays that way.  It is a fantastic tasting and easy-to-work-with melt, and works great if you dip what's leftover onto macaroon cookies (see "Macaroons III" on this site).  Thanks for the recipe!

I make a version of this "cookie" but instead of using chocolate chips, I use melting chocolate, or "bark" and it melts much easier than the chips.  These are the easiest goodies to make, and are yummy!

Really yummy, but a few problems:

I used chocolate chips as the chocolate, and they made a coating much too thick.  They wouldn't dip, and the few I finally managed to get entirely coated were much, much too rich.  

I don't know if using almond-bark-type chocolate would have worked better?  A candy coating made specifically for melting might work better?  Or thin the chocolate with a little shortening?  I ended up just smearing some chocolate on both sides of the sandwiches, which was super yummy, but not very pretty.

The recipe made far more than 24 (not a bad thing).

It seems like the proportions are a little off.  You don't actually need the whole jar of peanut butter, but I ran out of chocolate long before I ran out of sandwiches, and this was with me only putting a little chocolate on the tops and bottoms--not fully dipping them.

It's still a super yummy candy--thanks!

I first started using this recipe back in 1983 but I always used white chocolate. Then I branched out to white chocolate on one side, cool completely, and then regular chocolate on the other side. Thank you.

These are so good!!!  I added a small amount of parafin wax to the melted chocolate, which helps the chocolate stay on the cracker better and gives it a nice shine.

These are so simple and so good. You have to work quickly so that the peanut butter doesn't melt in your pan, but you get the hang of it.

I love love love these!  I use chocolate almond bark and melt it in the microwave for ease.  I have tried using the pre-made Ritz Bitz peanut butter sandwich crackers - was much easier, however the peanut butter just doesn't taste real.  As another poster suggested, putting the peanut butter in a bag a squeezing it on really helps cut the messiness out as well!

I made my own version - Instead of the PB and crackers, I used Oreo sandwich cookies. I coated half of them with melted white chocolate and drizzled some chocolate on it or some colored sprinkles or some rainbow sprinkles on top. I coated the other half with melted brown chocolate and drizzled it with white chocolate or colored sprinkles. I placed them on a parchment lined cookie sheet and into the refrigerator to set for about 20 minutes. It was quite a hit with the kids and super easy to make!! the kids were able to help out as well!

These are terrific, but I've never made them using regular chocolate, I always use white chocolate or almond/vanilla candy coating.  And, I've never heard this called this, but I make these every Christmas and they are probably the most raved about item I make!  They are highly addictive!  I always make extra otherwise we'll run out because people ask for more.

I've been making these for a few years now. My mother-in-law has been making them forever. I ate the ones she made and OH MY! I couldn't believe something so simple, could taste so good. We only use white almond bark for the covering. We've never made them with brown chocolate. Try them, and you'll be hooked=)

These are the best around Christmastime! I use Ritz crackers, along with creamy peanut butter and chocolate bark. They remind of the peanut butter patty cookies from when I was a Girl Scout!

I wasn't sure how these would turn out, but they really are SO good!  My daughter was able to help me make these with no problem. :-)

I used chocolate bark, because that is what I had in the house.  Also used Honey Butter Ritz crackers, and I think they are even better than regular ritz because they aren't salty.  My husband was skeptical, but he loves them, too!

These are fantastic!  They remind me of Girl Scout Tagalongs.  I usually only make a few cookies at a time, when I have a chocolate craving.  I've never made a whole batch, because I'm afraid we would eat them all in one sitting - they are that good!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe. I used chocolate almond bark instead of the chocolate chips. It seems to melt better for me and it reheats nicely when the bark starts to get hard. For a smooth coat just use a fork and after dipping, gently tap the side of your bowl. they are fabulous. My family has me make these every year.

I thought these were ok.  I liked the taste but my boyfriend did not like the cracker taste at all.  The chocolate was way to sticky, which made a mess when you tried to eat a cookie. Maybe it was because I used semi-sweet choc. chips, I'm not sure but I may try using the almond bark to see if my results are any better next time.

Yes! Yes! Yes! A chocolate-and-peanutbutter-lover’s dream come true! Put extra pb in a few of them; they were my favorites. Didn’t have wax paper, so I used a non-stick baking sheet instead and popped cookies in the freezer for 20 minutes; that worked great. Also, I was lazy and used chocolate chips to save a step. I may be even lazier next time and nuke the chocolate instead of using a double boiler. Fun recipe.

OMG!  I was so happy to come across the recipe for these!  A lady at the church I used to go to made these all the time.  They are TO DIE FOR!  You can use white chocolate also, but my personal favorite is milk chocolate.

We make these every year around Christmas.  Everyone loves them.  However, instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, we use chocolate almond bark.  I've never tried chocolate chips, but the almond bark is very smooth.

I've been making these for several years (after getting the idea from my aunt)...I actually just looked them up now to get exact measurements so I could figure out the nutritional information for a cookbook I'm putting together.  But I will agree with all the other reviewers, these taste EXACTLY like Girl Scout Cookies Tag-a-Longs to me...and WAY cheaper!  And they're ridiculously simple to make!  Try them, you'll love them!
