I give this recipe a 5, but I made several changes to add more nutrition & flavor. I used only 1/2 can garbanzo beans and added another 1/2 cup of lentils. PLUS, 2 cloves finely chopped garlic, 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped

I spent a rainy Saturday making five different kinds of veggie burgers from the site.  I wanted to load up the freezer because summer is a busy time for us and these would make for easy suppers.  I have to say this has been our least favorite burger so far.  It is just so dry.  I added Moroccan seasoning and served them in pita with cucumber sauce.  Even with the sauce they were just overwhelming dry.  I think it's the nuts.  None of the other recipes used nuts.  I love nuts, but apparently not in my veggie burger.  It seemed to get worse the more you ate it.  Our stars lowered throughout the meal.  I couldn't bring myself to finish one.  It was better with feta and olives but that's only because they were making the lack of good flavor.  I'll not be making these again.

We're tough on ratings, but we would still give this four stars.  We all liked the flavor and texture.  Only one of the five of us didn't like the nutty flavor.  To make them stick together better I've heard you should refrigerate them for an hour or so before cooking.  They were a little crumbly, but we didn't find it too bad.  The avocado is a great compliment.  We didn't use the ranch dressing since we are vegan.

I loved these.  I think this deserves 5 stars even though I did have to change it up a bit.  I used walnuts and pumpkin seeds and made mine vegan by using veganaise instead of an egg.  I used chopped chives instead of diced onion because that's what I had on hand.  My seasonings:  garlic powder (no fresh garlic on hand), smoked paprika, and black and red pepper.  And I used lentils...again what I had on hand.  I also added a dash of liquid smoke and tamari.  I used a food processor, and I even overprocessed the mixture a bit, and it's still fantastic.  I had no trouble with mine staying together.  I just handled them gently when flipping, and they did fine.  I served on toasted ww buns with sliced tomatoes, broccoli sprouts, and smoked tomato dressing.  Oh yeah...I'll be making these again!

The texture of this was really great, and it didn't take very long at all to make.  The avocado tasted good on top, and I added a little salsa.  Don't let the nuts scare you off on this one--the flavor is excellent!

Awesome texture! But you need to majorly "doctor" it as it was so bland the first time I made it.  I added two crushed cloves of garlic, half a veggie onion bullion cube (crumbled) and topped it with garlic mayo. I also pureed less than  HALF (the half included all the egg, bullion and garlic) of it and barely mushed the other half, so it would stick.  This was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!

Wow! These were incredible, even after reheating for leftovers the next day! I used a combination of walnuts and almonds, and only had dried parsley. I skipped the cheese, used a regular bun and topped them with tomato, scallions, and ranch because that's what I had available. I followed the proportions, and got 4 large patties, not just two. I will make these again and again!

This is a good veggie burger recipe, although I found that it made "4 servings" or large patties rather than 2 as written on recipe.  I do also believe it needs a lot more spice, they tasted just a little too bland for my tastes but found that when reheated the next day the texture and taste was a lot better than when first making them.  As for the crumbling and falling apart, try adding in "vital wheat gluten" if you're not allergic to wheat products; it helps hold them together.  Next time I will add in more onion, minced garlic, seasoning salt and whatever else my spice cupboard entices me to.

Made this one last night - quite good except I ended up with about 6 burgers not 2!  Also, next time I will try and add another egg.  While the burgers didn't crumble in the pan - they crumbled very easily after they cooled..

I guess I should have read the reviews before embarking on this adventure as my patties sadly crumbled upon flipping if following the recipe as is.  It's not a flavour for everyone but it's not bad at all.

Will this replace a burger for a non-vegetarian? no. But does it taste great? Yes!!! The flavor was great! the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they did not hold too well. To help with this, I made mini-burgers, and made sure that they chared a bit on each side. It did help some, but did not completely eliminate the problem. I will still make them though

I thought this was a great template for soy-free veggie burgers. I didn't have chick peas, so I used black beans. I didn't have parsely or the ranch. The patty itself left a lot to be desired in the way of taste--BUT I put cheese, avacado and ketchup on it and then it was fine. I think this recipe is very flexible. The key ingredients being mashed beans, nuts for texture and egg to hold it together. Then you can add all sorts of things to give it flavor. I should have added some more seasonings to boost the flavor, but I was in a hurry. I did chill my mix in the freezer for about 10 minutes to make it less gooey and that seemed to help the burger hold up well. As someone who abhores walnuts and isn't a fan of sunflower seeds-- I was impressed that the nuts didn't bother me at all.

Hubs thought these were OK, I thought these were the closest thing to a hamburger that I've had yet.  Mine fell apart, so I might try the wheat gluten if I make them again per another user's suggestion.  Mine also made 4 large patties, not two.  Overall, not a bad veggie burger.

Smashed blackbeans with green onions are better in this than the lentils. I also added some Wright's Liquid smoke (Hickory flavor), and 1/4 cup strong black tea to help with forming the patties.

The taste is good, but I found it very difficult to make the mix into proper patties. I ended up just spooning the mix into the pita - it was great, but not a burger, just a sandwich filling.

My husband and I thought these were pretty good.  I added half a cup of diced mushrooms and used some peanuts instead of sunflower seeds, because that is what I had on hand.  I followed the other users advice and used 2 eggs and refrigerated them for a couple of hours. But they still fell apart.  Tasted good, but they didn't stay as one patty.  We ate them as a regular burger, on a bun with tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup.  YUM. But, I wonder what will make them stay together?

WE love this. They taste great, are simple to make, and brown up and look appealing! There are 5 in my family and I double the recipe. We have eaten them plain and on buns but haven't tried the pita and avacado yet.

I doubled the mixture and used a can of butter beans, & a can of kidney beans instead of the chick peas. I used mixed chopped nuts and mixed seeds, I also added a tablespoon of mayonnaise,  tabasco and cayenne pepper. I dipped them in breadcrumbs after shaping them. They were lovely, very nutty, I may reduce the amount of nuts and seeds next time.

I am a nut-aholic and have been looking for a nut burger recipe for ages. I used almonds, walnuts and a dash of sesame seeds.  Garlic powder, dash of cayenne, salt, pepper and parsley.  Added a tbsp. or so of breadcrumbs, chilled the mix for a few hours and it cooked perfectly.  Tasted great...I'm so glad I tried it. I'm not a vegetarian but this is much better than a beef burger!

I didn't follow directions very well, not cooking the nuts, not thinking and adding 2 tbsp. of olive oil to the recipe (still not sure about that one), but I liked these burgers.  I am taking them to a potluck, so I made several small burgers.  I think they will go over very well.  I'm new to vegan cooking and have been concerned about really bland food.  These seem to have lots of flavor.  I need to make up some sauce to serve them with, bc I won't be serving them with buns.  Back to a recipe search!

First of all, I'd say this definitely serves 3-4, not just 2. I made it into 3 patties, and the burgers were still huge.

I first tried chopping everything by hand and smashing the chickpeas with a fork, but the mixture didn't hold together - it was way too dry and crumbly. So I transferred it to a food processor, which did the trick, and the patties held together. Definitely use a food processor or blender! 

It actually did taste kind of meaty, but I think I'd prefer different seasoning. I'll probably try making it again, but I'll divide it into 4 patties, and experiment with spices - maybe Italian seasoning, or southwest seasonings.

As is, these burgers have a great texture and appearance but the taste is really bland. I think it's the ranch dressing and cheese they add in the original recipe that gives them any taste whatsoever. I mean, you can taste nuts...but that's about it. I don't eat cheese or ranch dressing, so I wouldn't dress them up with those ingredients. I took the first version of this recipe and covered them in tomato sauce and ate them that way. It was OK. The next time I made them I made modifications based on a previous recipe I'd found for vegan 'meatballs', adding chili powder, pureed cooked peppers, garlic, liquid smoke, balsamic vinegar, nutritional yeast, miso and onions. HUGE difference. This version was great! I really love lots of flavor, as well as a good texture.

These were the best veggie burgers I've ever had! They tasted like regular ground beef cheeseburgers!! We will definitely make this a regular meal in our house.

The second time around my family really enjoyed these.  The first time they were really dry and fell apart really bad.  The second time I made them I ground the walnuts and sunflower seeds really fine and added 2 eggs.  They held together perfectly!

This recipe is easy to make and makes more than the recipe says. I had enough to make double the amount. I served it with Root Vegetable Chips. Delicious!

These were wonderful.  I spiced them up a bit and through all the ingredients in a processor for a short burst to help with the sticking problem.  Added garlic, basil, liquid smoke, and some Worcestershire sauce.
