I took this to a dinner party and had many requests for the recipe. To the previous reviewer (the first one to write a review) please don't rate a recipe as only 3 stars if you have even not made it!

Haven't made this yet, but I have a surplus of grapefruit and lemons from my trees this year, and I love making ceviche with all of the fresh seafood we have here on the northwestern Gulf coast of Florida. Can't wait to try this.
