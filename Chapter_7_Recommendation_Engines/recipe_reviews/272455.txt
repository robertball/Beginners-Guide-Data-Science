4.5.19  Not being exactly sure what shallow muffin cups were and only having a regular muffin tin and a mini muffin tin, I chose to go with the mini today.  I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings, used a small cookie scoop, and ended up with 24 delicious little mini tarts.  For a variety of flavors, I used orange marmalade, strawberry, and plum with star anise preserves for the filling.  The tart shell almost melts in your mouth, and using the food processor, this is so very easy to make. I was thinking “thumbprint cookies” when I was filling with the preserves, but they certainly don’t taste like cookies, definitely pastry.  We really enjoyed the bite-size tarts, and I’ll use the mini-muffin tin for this recipe in the future.  PaulaM11, thanks for sharing your recipe.

It warns against putting too much jam in them but I would actually be generous with the jam. I followed the recipe and didn't think there was enough jam. They are super delicious and decadent either way! I would note that they dry out within a few days so eat them while they're fresh. :)

I made these this week. The only difference was that I had to add an extra cup of flour to form a ball. However, the dough turned our beautiful even with this change. Delicious with home made jam (chokecherry, wild blueberry and wild plum). Rave reviews from folks on Movie Night. Next time I’m thinking lemon! Thanks, Allrecipes
