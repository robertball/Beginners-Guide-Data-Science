This is my recipe and I just noticed the directions were changed by AR.  The first part of cooking the pasta really should be done at the last minute. It's important to make the tomato mixture and let is sit a bit so the salt draws some of the juice out of the tomatoes and creates more 'sauce'. Of course, you'll need juicy tomatoes to start! The step with the pasta water was only intended to be used if you needed more sauce, please don't dump it all in!

Recipe Group Selection:  25, August 2012 ~ FANTASTIC selection this week!!  Definitely a "must try".  I chopped my tomatoes (didn't bother seeding) in the morning and added the sea salt, pepper and EV olive oil - then refrigerated it all day.  I set it on the counter for about 2 hours before using them to come to room temp.  By doing so, it created enough broth that I didn't need the pasta water when mixing it all together.  I had never tried, nor bought prosciutto before.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.   This meal came together quickly and made for a pretty presentation.  I served it with a toss salad and rolls.  We both LOVED it and will be having it again soon with all the tomatoes we have left in the garden.  DH said the leftovers were great for lunch the next day, always a plus.  Thanks Wyattdogster for sharing this recipe.  It is a "winner"!

I followed the submitters advice and started with the tomato mixture and made the pasta last. To avoid the possibility of tough skins, I peeled my garden tomatoes by scalding for 30 seconds and then placing in cold water - the skins slipped right off. I was a little leary of adding the full amount of oil called for even though olive oil is the healthy oil but I did as the directions stated and didn't regret it. The tomato mixture made enough of its own juice that the addition of the pasta water was not necessary for me.  I didn't have shallots so I diced up some onion instead. Followed the rest of the instructions as indicated and topped with Parmesan cheese. I had never had prosciutto before and although I didn't care for the proscuitto on its own, it was a good addition to this recipe. I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the light fresh flavor. What could be better than fresh tomatoes and basil in the summertime? Thanks for the tasty recipe Laurie!

I made this recipe as part of the AR weekly recipe group selection. I have to say this dish well exceeded my expectations. I didn't have any fresh garden tomatoes and had to buy from the grocery store. The nicest looking tomatoes were plum tomatoes. I chopped them up with seeds, skins and everything nature gave them. I let them sit with the basil at room temperature for a good two hours in the olive oil. Luckily these were exceptional tomatoes and I was amazed at how much juice they made. I had no need for the extra water. I've never had prosciutto but was happy to find fresh sliced to order in the deli of our grocery store. My son had his girlfriend over and all four of us ate every last bite. This was really an easy summer meal, so few ingredients and yet so full of satisfying flavor in every bite. I certainly will make this again and again. Thanks Wyattdogster, I would never have thought this one up on my own. Just wonderful!

Delicious and light! I cut the 1/3 cup of olive oil back to a scant 1/4 cup to save a few calories, and I still had no need for the pasta water. I definitely agree with the reviewers who recommended putting the sauce ingredients together an hour or two ahead of time at room temperature to let the flavors combine. My daughter couldn't keep her fork out of the bowl - I thought I wasn't going to have anything left for dinner! She said it tasted just like bruschetta. I used the campari tomatoes they sell at Costco and they worked great.

Recipe Group selection 8/25/12.My friend gave me several heirloom tomatoes, fresh off the vine and a pattypan squash.  I had planned to prepare this as per the recipe but had to stretch it in order to feed unexpected guests.  I prepared the tomatoes as written, then I cut the pattypan squash and sauteed it in a mixture of butter and EVOO with 4 cloves of garlic and half a large sweet onion, diced.  When the vegetables were almost ready I added my pancetta, which was diced, to just crisp it a bit and boiled my pasta.  At this point I added my tomatoes and the pasta to the pan and tossed it all together.  I served it on individual plates with freshly grated parmesan and fresh ground black pepper.  I didn't need any additional water.  This was very well received, in fact, I thought my son in law was going to lick his plate.  Thanks wyattdogster for a great meal that we will have as long as my plant keeps giving me basil and I still can get best quality tomatoes.

Excellent recipe!!! But I prefere to do it with Spanish iberico ham, Prochiutto is good but pata negra ham is something else, at least the one I buy online in jamonarium.com . They have some kind of ham bites idela for salads like this, and the taste is strong and juicy.... delicious!!! 
Thanks for the recipe guys!!!

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! Hubby doesn't care for angel hair, so I used thin spaghetti (16oz. box). I made the tomato mixture a few hours before dinner, also adding in the basil, to allow the flavors to blend and to create more 'sauce'...worked perfectly, and there was no need for the extra pasta water this way. The cooked shallot and garlic was a nice addition. This has such a light, fresh flavor, and that was exactly what I was hoping for. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this salad with whole wheat pasta.  The salad was a nice change, not heavy but light and refreshing.  Next time I will put more garlic and try it with bacon.  My family really enjoyed it.

Great Summer dinner! This was very light, yet still filling - and SO fresh! I used grape tomatoes (quartered), because I had them on hand - wish they'd been juicier - I will go with regular tomatoes (per your instructions) next time. Thanks, Wyattdogster - this is a keeper!

My husband and I loved how this turned out. I added asparagus since I had it on hand and I knew it goes well with prosciutto, otherwise followed the recipe to spec. Was best fresh and the leftovers lost the pizzaz it had when it was fresh. Was a simple and fresh dinner.

The perfect lunch!! I almost went to my favorite Italian food place for a to-go lunch, but last minute I changed my mind and decided to make something myself. So glad I did. I guess the only change I made was to use very thinly sliced yellow onion in place of the shallots, because I didn't have them. LOVED!!

I did not find this recipe as extraordinary as many find it. It felt like it was lacking something. Some additional salt maybe? It was bland....I think the prociutto did add a bit of flavor but it was still bland

Delicious light summer pasta.  I followed the directions for the most part, but I prepared the tomatoes earlier in the day, based upon the suggestion of others on this site.  I added one small minced garlic clove and refrigerated the mixture for six hours.  1-2 hours before completing the recipe, I brought the tomatoes out of the refrigerator so they could come to room temperature before I added them to the rest of the ingredients.    All of us enjoyed the pasta, and I will definitely make it again.

Wow! So very good. I followed the directions (including the directions given by the original poster in his review), and it turned out beautifully. I also followed his suggestion and to use a garlic-infused olive oil. The whole family loved it. Fresh and delicious. Great for summer! Will definitely make this again!

This was just ok but I don't think I would cook it again. I don't think that 4 oz of prosciutto is enough for one thing.

We no longer eat white pasta so I used Bionature 100 % Whole Wheat Spaghettini and it turned out very nicely. I used a larger amount of yellow onions (no shallots available), more garlic cloves & halved grape tomatoes. Next time I will marinate the tomatoes longer than one hour and will try reducing the olive oil a bit. I will definitely make again! Thanks for this easy recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I went a little light on the garlic and added some grilled asparagus.  I also crisped the prosciutto a little before I added it, as another reviewer suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so easy and so tasty. It was a great way to use up tomatoes from my garden.  My eight year old who likes nothing loves this pasta. A keeper for sure.
