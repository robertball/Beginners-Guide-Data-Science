Thank you for this recipe Arvilla.  My 5 kids loved it.  I did increase the sugar content for the batter mixture to 1 tablespoon.  Made it just that little bit sweeter.
Also note that it is REALLY important to keep the frying heat low and not be tempted to rush the frying process as the outside will cook nicely but the batter will remain quite gooey on the inside.  
Thanks again!!!

I've never made my own zeppole - but have eaten enough to know which type I like! This recipe hit the nail on the head. Tasted delicious, just like my aunt's!! To spice em up a little bit - we add some pine nuts (pinnoli) and raisins. The raisins really add a touch of sweetness. Also great when you dip them in a cinnamon & sugar mixture.

I have never eaten Zeppole before but I thought these were good and pretty easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I'll increase the sugar to 1 tbsp. as others have suggested. I think I might also try a sugar/cinnamon coating rather than just confectioners sugar. One addition note, I dropped the dough into the oil using a measuring tablespoon and it only made about 25 cookies rather than 35. They about double in size as they fry.

This recipe is great..These doughnuts are fabulous...I made about 8-10 batches in one weekend! My husband took some to work and they offered to pay me to make them!! My kids all loved them as well and my husband like them plainrather than sugar coated..I did both a powdered sugar coating on some and a cinnamon sugar one some others...they both are super..next i would like to try a glaze of some sort..the only thing I changed from the original recipe is the ricotta..I use cottage cheese instead and do not cook the mixture before frying.oh yeah also about a tablespoon more sugar to the mix too. I am suprized they do not have more Zeppole recipes on this site.Thanks for opening myeyes to a wonderful treat.

These are not authentic zeppole...these are "fritters".  The real zeppole uses yeast, flour, water and bit of sugar, that's all.  You fry in oil and the result is a light, spongey texture. You can find the real deal zeppole sold at fairs and in pizza places.  There is no comparison.

I give this recipe 5 stars!  I made it 3 days in a row.  The only difference is that I changed step #2.  Did not heat the ingredients before frying.  I combined the wet ingredients first and mixed it with a fork.(The eggs & ricotta).  (SORRENTO makes VELVETY SMOOTH 15 OZ. RICOTTA.  Then I added the dry ingredients and mixed it and covered the bowl.  Let stand for 30 minutes-1 hour minutes before frying.  I used a regular 3 quart pot filled 1/2 way with vegetable oil.  FANTASTIC!!!

I'm speechless! Seriously, I don't even know what to say about these except that I can't get my mouth to stop dancing. I've had zeppole's at friends homes and at country fairs, but have never made them myself until today. What have I been waiting for? Because I made these on a whim, I didn't have any ricotta in the house so I subbed with vanilla yogurt. Trust me folks, it worked amazingly well. I also used one tsp. of vanilla and two teaspoons of sugar. I can't wait to make these for my daughters next month! Thank you SO much for a fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!

The only thing I changed was to mix everything without heating first. Instead, I let it sit to blend for around 30 min. They were perfect, especially for company/special occasions! Hint: Another way to serve these is by setting them on your platter, drizzling honey across the zeppole, then dusting with conf. sugar. Yum!

I've made these before with a different recipe and actually prefer these. Totally yummy!! Made exactly as written and wouldn't change anything. No, they are not super sweet but the confectioners sugar makes up for that. Great way to use up leftover ricotta. I actually only made half a recipe and it was perfect!

I just tried this recipe and I am blown away! I grew up in NY/NJ and every weekend my family would go to the local pizza place and pick up dinner and zeppoles for dessert...I live allll the way in California now and I am soooo happy to at least find  a recipe that makes such amazing zeppoles! Thanks soo much for the recipe!  I did change it up a little though: I added about 1/2 tsp more sugar to a half batch (18 servings) and it made a huge difference!

Tasty... I increased the sugar in the batter to 1 tablespoon, and added a bit of cinnamon to the icing sugar for dusting. I also found that dropping by full tablespoons made -way- less than 35... half-a-tablespoon is better (makes them more bite-size too). Only about 1/2 of my zeppole turned by themselves too... so be forewarned, don't wait for them to turn over on their own if they seem to be brown enough or they could get overcooked! Still, a good recipie.

Although I'm not a huge doughnut fan, I loved the taste of these & they were fun to try. I did a half recipe, but used 3 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I recommend frying to a dark brown for a crispier outside. Perfect with a fresh cup of strong coffee.

I was so pleased with this little treat.  My boyfriend said that it tasted just like his mother's, which was one huge compliment!  I actually drizzled mine with honey after dusting it with the confectioner's sugar.  I am making this again for a Sunday brunch.

These cookies are quick, easy, and delicious. I made them to bring into work, but they didn't make it that far. These cookies were gone in less than a half an hour. I followed the directions exactly and they came out great!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  It's lighter than I remember at the feasts and less greasy but that's a good thing.  Although I don't know where the serving size comes from, I doubled it to get about 30.  Maybe mine were bigger but I prefer them this way.  Also took the sugar advice and agreed, I might even add a little bit more next time.  Fantastico!

These are amazing, I had them once at an international foods festival and they were called Greek balls. I looked for a recipe everywhere and when i tried this I was exstatic as was my family. They are great with a little honey or maple syrup (a natural one tastes best.) I will be making these regularly. I did use 1T sugar and a lil more vanilla then called for, but excellent!!!

Love it! So easy and fun to make. My brother ate some b4 dinner, and could not wait till after dinner to have some more! The dough itself is not sweet at all, so I might add a little more sugar next time. However, with the icing sugar, they taste great. I also dipped some in chocolate, which were really good too. In lebanon, we have a similar kind of fried doughnut, but without the ricotta. And to sweeten then we dip them hot into simple syrup, which would have worked perfectly for these as well! Thanks a lot for this recipe, love it!

YES!  Now I don't have to wait to go down the shore in the summer!!  These are fabulous, and I forgot the vanilla!  They seem to be not quite as dense as I'm used to, but that is completely ok.  I put a few in a bag and just added the powdered sugar to it, shook, and voila!  Excellent!

I followed the recipe as directed, increasing the sugar to 1 TBS as recommended.  The zeppoles were VERY light & airy.  I'm giving 5 stars for a doughnut recipe everyone loved, but I have to keep searching for a zeppole recipe to duplicate the ones made in New York.  Zeppoles you buy in NY are more dense/doughy.

Very good recipe! However tradional italian dounuts contain usually orage or lemon zest. I used about 3 teaspoon of sugar, a dash of cinnamon and about 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest. It was heaven in my mouth!!!:)

Good texture. Surprisingly they don't turn out too dense and the ricotta flavor is nice and mild.  Definitely drizzle honey over them.

These could not have been a bigger hit! Not only with my family, but with the neighborhood kids as well, with copies of the recipe going home to their parents. Amazingly easy. Next time, I am going to do half confec. sugar and half cinnamon sugar.. Thanks for this keeper!

didn't care for it that much. doesn't taste like the zeppole you get in Brooklyn or at street fairs. i think this one is too eggy or something. if you coat it in confectioner's sugar the way you are supposed to, you definitely do not need to up the amount of sugar in the dough.

These are fantastic!!! I make at Christmas time the potato zeppole, but wanted to try to find a recipe for the ricotta cheese ones...On a recent trip to NYC we had dinner at the Art Museum at Robert's restaurant, for dessert they had bomboloni which they said were a ricotta fritter, so I'm thinking ricotta zeppole and this is it, they taste just like this, thier's were a little more moist but I think if you added more ricotta you would get that result, I prefer them just the way this recipe turned them out, they were perfect!!! I did add 3 tsp of sugar like others posted and I liked the result, not sweet at all, I put cinnamon sugar and 10X sugar in a paper bag and shook them when they were warm, I had a party in my mouth!!!!

I hate to give a bad review but these went straight into the gargabe. I must stress that I didn't use ricotta (I didn't have any) I don't know if that made a huge difference. The texture was like old dry bread. Not at all like I remember them being. I was excited when I found this recipe but, disappointed with the results.

This recipes was good but I would suggest adding some lemon or almond flavoring to give it a little more punch.  Other than that the zeppole were great.

This recipe came out amazing! We followed the recipe exactly except we substituted cream cheese instead of ricotta because we didn't have any on hand. It was still fantastic, but only made 15 zeppoles instead of the advertised 35.

This recipe is truly perfect !  The only thing I did different is I added a lil more baking powder and sugar.  I also added extra ricotta for moisture.  The Zeppole came out exquisite !  Very, very good recipe especially for first timers.  Will recommend to anyone, anytime.

EXCELLENT! A few changes I made:  I used 3 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I rolled my zeppoles in cinnamon sugar. They are fantastic, and I could eat the whole batch! One batch made approximately 15 medium sized zeppoles. I made two batches :)

Great Recipe - almost exactly like my mom's except she added lemon zest to her batter.  I know someone expressed "whats up with ricotta" well, zeppole's are made with ricotta if following an Italian recipe and do not have a filling in them as someone else posted.  Thank you for the recipe - they were delicious and reminded me of my childhood!

These were very similar to the zeppoles I got at the county fairs in new jersey as a child, much better than I expected. They were soft, tender, and delicious. My friend agreed, and was eating them almost as fast as I could get them out of the fryer! I just threw mine in a bag with some powdered sugar and shook them up, just like we did at the fairs. Wonderful recipe, really brought me back. I did change the sugar to one tablespoon.

I'm shocked that some chefs rated this recipe so poorly considering it is quite authentic.  Ricotta is a staple in a zeppole recipe and most that I have seen call for a 1-to-1 ratio (or somewhere near that).  One egg is probably enough, though we enjoyed these just fine with the two called for in the recipe.  As many others have stated, a little extra sugar and vanilla are necessary in the batter; next time I will try almond extract even though that is getting away from a traditional zeppole.  Overall, this a great zeppole recipe, that if tweaked just a little can stand up to any other recipe out there.

After reading the reviews, I decided to give these a try; I've been looking for an easy doughnut recipe, and this fits the bill! I followed everyone else's lead and added 1-2 tsp vanilla (good thing), but otherwise followed the recipe as it was. They were disappearing as quickly as I turned them out, and next time I'm going to double the recipe, since I didn't get as many as the recipe said, even though I used a teaspoon to get them bite-sized

I just finished making a batch for the first time and increased the sugar to 1 tbsp. It was very good but still needs more sugar in the batter. I will make them again but will increase the sugar even more next time.

The taste was just okay. I loaded as much powdered sugar as I could because I didnt think they had much taste. Very easy to make though. I added extra sugar to the recipe as some other reviewers suggested and I also added a bit more vanilla. I thought I would taste more of the cheese but I didn't. Sorry I won't be making these again.

Taking into account what many others had said...I added some extra sugar and a tad extra vanilla and some butter extract...I was VERY generous with the powdered sugar.   VERY GOOD...VERY SUPER SIMPLE!  I made 1/2 a recipe for hubby for a "weekend afternoon snack".  BIG hit with husband and a no muss/fuss treat! MANY THANK for posting this...5 STARS all the way...just remember to DOLL UP if you want some extra flavor.

Thanks!! I was dying to try something different and sweet made with Ricotta!  Whipped 'em up this morning - adding in a lil' extra vanilla, a lil' extra sugar, and a splash of Almond Extract.  These little gems taste exactly like the carnival Mini-Donuts my kids have been riding my tail for all summer!!  Rolled in Cin-Sugar, due to lack of 10X.

I've made this a couple times, and would definitely recommend using a thermometer.  One time I didn't, and they came out raw in the middle (a bite I wouldnt wish upon anyone!). They really are inredibly good, whether they're exactly like the zeppole you've had before or not.  Cinnamon sugar is my favorite topping for these :) Guests are always impressed as well!

Awesome!  I had never tried these before.  Was just looking for a way to use up some ricotta I had left over from making lasagna.  For me it was like eating little pizelles in ball form.  Next time I think I will try to use either anise extract or almond.  That would make them even tastier.  Will definitely me making these again!

I am a New Yorker living in FL and these taste just like they do in NY. I have not seen them here in FL, so when I found this recipe I made them and my family loved them. Especially my husband(also from NY),he ate almost all of them.

This is my first time making anything like this so I didn't really know what to expect.  These have a nice crispy, yet soft texture and if you take them out of the oil a tad early it leaves a creamy filling inside which is kinda nice (although I can taste the flour).  I wanted them sweeter than the recipe called for so I used 3 tablespoons of sugar.  They were still just mildly sweet in my opinion.  My husband and kids thought they were great though.  I thought they were okay.  It was fun to try something different though and my husband is asking me to make them again so I probably will.  ;-)

I made these for a Multi-Cultural Party at school (I am Itallian). They are a bit like doughnuts or beignets- light and fluffy. The recipe was very easy to follow, but I tweaked it a little. I added a bit more sugar and vanilla like some other reviews suggested and only put half a tablespoon of batter in the frying pan for a more manageable sized bite; all turned out well. They were delicious, and were a big hit at the party! Thanks for the awesome treat- I will definitely be making some more over the holidays!

I am a professional Chef and graduate of the CIA.  I now have 3 sons at home and was cooking for a rainy night "sleepover." I was looking for a fun Italian dessert to compliment spaghetti and meatballs. This recipe had the best ratings. Although Italian, I did not grow up on the authentic Zeppole, so I'm not sure what I should have expected, but I was able to churn them out to the kids in brown paper bags in no time at all. No yeast, no rest time, no mixer. "Zeppole" maybe not- easy, fun, tasty dessert? They LOVED them!!

This was a nice treat. A good Italian donut. My family liked it but prefer the zeppoles i make by frying pizza dough. This recipe actually taste like fried cake to me but my mom thought it had an eggy taste(not in a bad way). I might try this recipe again.

I had these at a wonderful bakery in Seattle and my oldest child was not with us so I looked for a recipe and ended up here. All I can say is FABULOUS! I even substituted sugar-free honey and splenda in the recipe and they were awesome. Next time I am going to try making them with Coconut Flour for even less carbs. Great recipe!

as an italian from da bronx i have had many zeppole in my life.
after makeing these the first time i thought they were just ok. size was good fluffy and yes you are supposed to use ricotta in them. i found the taste not 100%. i think i may have used a little too much salt but something still seemed off  i'm not quite sure what is off about them. i will have afew friends try them and ask what they think. i will try to make them again and tweek it a bit and then review again

This recipe is amazing!  I have never had zeppole at a fair, but I have had funnel cake, and it really does taste like little funnel cake balls.  I am so glad for reviews - I had to read them all before feeling confident enough to make these.  Here are some pointers if you've never made something like this.  you can use any size saucepan of oil, as long as there are at least 2 inches deep of oil.  Make the oil as hot as you can without burning, but after a batch or two you'll find they cook much faster and will need to watch carefully and possibly turn the heat down.  A 1/2 Tbsp is the PERFECT amount of dough - the rounder the better - they WILL turn over by themselves, but only if the batter is somewhat round in shape.  I personally dont understand why you mix it in a saucepan over low heat, but it does work and it is very sticky!   (you know it is ready when it sort of looks like a unified dough) I also used 1/8 cup of sugar - it seemed to be the concensus on here to use more sugar.  My insides were perfect, and I think it was because of hot oil and small amounts of dough.  It is a super quick and easy recipe.  I would suggest serving them immediately, it is hard to keep something like this warm - maybe they'd do ok in a warm oven- I'd love any suggestions for this as they taste much better warm!

Great stuff.  Don't forget to add a touch more flour if it's humid.  Frying in my skillet, I had the most success making them small, frying for a scant 3 minutes.

just a suggestion, My Mom, from Italy, Colobria, usto make these w/ no ricotta and no sugar, but added dried zuccini squash, and at easter, would add buccala, dried cod fish,after being soaked overnight in water, changed often. try it, its better as a side dish to a main meal.

I've never had these in a restaurant so I think they are pretty good.  My son says they are nothing like the ones
sold at the Italian restaurant near us.

I was so thrilled to find this recipe.  I have craved for over two years now!  My husband was thrilled also so he doesn't have to hear me whine anymore.  They tasted great and I have been asked for more from my kids.  Thank you sooo much!

One of the best recipes I ever tried!  I too increased the sugar,and the vanilla.  One trick, instead of sprinkling them with powdered sugar, put the sugar and zeppoles in a brown bag and shake.  Also, be patient when they cook, let them get a nice golden brown and a little crispy.  I made them twice in one weekend!  Family loved them.

Followed the recipe. Good recipe but definitely not Zeppole! Change the name and I'll give it 4 stars. It's more like a Canadian timbit or fried cake pop. Does need more sugar and since it's not Zeppole I would add more ingredients in the batter to make it more tasty like chocolate chips, or chocolate powder,berries or sprinkles. Tried one with some chocolate chips does fry we'll.

Tripled the recipe with no problem. Added fresh grated cinnamon to batter before frying. Was delicious! All gone before I could get picture.
Hint used thermometer to measure oil temp. Adjusted heat as needed.

Great recipe! Just like the ones at the San Gennaro feast in NYC. I def needed this to cure my case of homesick! Only note* is that mine needed a nudge to flip over- maybe they were a bit crowded in the fryer. Keeping this recipe for the future!

1st I want to say the recipe was good (needed ++ sugar).

The recipe is not a Zeppole recipe as Zeppoles have few ingredients like flour, yeast, oil some salt.

I am from Brooklyn and always looked forward to the Feasts where Zeppole was the most wanted dessert.  Served warm with confection sugar in a brown bag.  

To me, its more similar to a benyas ( beignets) flavor which are very good also.

These were awful. They have very little flavor.  Cook them too long you have chewy results. Under cook them and you have a gooey inside. I tried making them sweeter. And adjust temp and cook times. And they were awefull every time.

It turned out fine. Very light and spongy. The bigger "drops" didn't cook all the way through, but the smaller balls were good. 
I followed the process from another recipe that called to mix dry and 'wet' ingredients separately and then combine them together.  
I do think that it  should have more sugar or maybe I put too much salt, so they turned out a bit saltier than I'd like. The sugar powder helps, but I'll try to make it again deviating from the recipe a bit. 

Overall: good.

This recipe is excellent! The only change I made was to add use 1 TBSP of sugar as others mentioned. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. They are delicious and really easy to make. I highly recommend it!

I missed the instructions that said to put the ingredients in a saucepan and heat them. I just mixed them together and dropped the batter in the hot oil and they were terrific!  I did increase the sugar to 1 tablespoon. After frying I rolled them in cinnamon and sugar or sprinkled with powdered sugar. They were delicious!  I never had zeppolis before (what kind of an Italian am I?) but these were really good.  I used a small cookie scooper which made small donut hole sized zeppolis. Perfect size to pop in your mouth!

I have done these both ways, just combined the ingredients for the batter and yes they stay a little gooey inside but just a tad and are awesome. Then I did mixed them ontop low heat as per recipe and the batter does yield a "cakier" Zeppole. I like both, way too much! They defenetllybare not the same as the "festival" yeast version but scrumptious none the less. Will make these way too often for the good of the weistline!

My mother-in-law knew how to make Zeppoles when she was a little girl and was searching the web for a similar to exact recipe from her childhood. When she came upon this recipe her search had came to an end. Not only was this recipe delicious, it was easy, fast and literally cooks on its own. Thank you for sharing this recipe. 
Happy kookin'

This is actually a more authentic recipe. My family is from northern Italy and this recipe using ricotta yields a very similar zeppole to what my great grandmother used to make. The yeast version is cheaper and can be left out unbaked longer, that's why it's more common. But yes, these are more cake-like than the ole brooklyn street fair vairety.

I made these the other night and they were beyond delicious! I have made many zeppola recipes over the years as they are a staple at Christmas!  I DID make some CHANGES and we loved how they came out. The true test is how good they are the NEXT DAY! These did NOT disappoint.. Ok..Changes...I did NOT blend over heat.I added wet to dry ingredients and then fried.  I added 1 1/2 c ricotta (not 1cup) and  I also added 1 TABLESPOON of sugar as other reviewers suggested and loved the addition although these will not be super sweet which is nice!   Fast and easy and so good!

They were delicious!  Airy, light - had to add a little extra ricotta and milk but so yummy!

As a kid I always loved these and now I wanted to share it with my son. This recipe was on a point! People are saying oh it Doesn't need ricotta cheese but it's a tweet that works. I did add slightly a more sugar in the recipe. Keep in mind you are sprinkling sugar after down. And if you don't have a deep fryer use a sauce pan and on low heat. A+++++

These are actually called sfinge or sfinge de ricotta, zepole is fried dough and just as good but without the cheese but these were so very good! I also increased the sugar as other reviewers had and it was great!

Followed the suggestions of others and did the following for a 1/2 batch: no salt, 2 1/2 tsp sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and I didn't cook the batter.  They were GREAT!

These are absolutely authentic and delicious!  We ate them with cinnamon/sugar and honey, but the most popular was powdered sugar.  They are very similar to the light and airy Biegnets from the French Quarter in NOLA.  The only thing I did differently was that I made up the batter about 2 hours before I fried the Zeppole.  I just left it in the pan I had cooked the batter in.  I'm not sure if this is what made them so light or just because of the recipe, but I'll definitely find out when I make them again!

My rating erased :( ... it said something like "made smaller scoops like half a tablepoon and would add more sugar to it"

So good with cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar! I prefer the cinnamon though. We made the mistake of trying to cover an Oreo with this to make fried Oreos and they wouldn't turn on their own bc of the shape and didnt have much flavor. The reason I give this 4 stars is because it's definitely not sugary enough! Next time gonna use about a tablespoon of sugar

Sorry but there just wasn't enough flavor. Nobody went back for seconds, maybe some flavored extracts would help or cinnamon. It has potential and I'll give it another whirl.

We just christened our new deep fryer with this recipe and they were great! We halved the recipe and ended up with around 15 zeppole--delicious!! don't skimp on the powdered sugar at the end!
