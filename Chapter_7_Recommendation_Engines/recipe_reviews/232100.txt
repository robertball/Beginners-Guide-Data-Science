Very good, and a snap to put together.  One change I made, out of necessity, was to use light cream.  It was perfect--I can't imagine that it would have been any better with heavy cream.  I also added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  Oh, yes, and I didn't layer it: I sautéed the vegetables, made the sauce, and added the cooked chicken and pasta--all in the same oven safe pan--topped it with the cheeses, and baked it.  Wonderful dinner, super easy clean-up.

After I added the milk and cream, it liquified and stayed liquified.  Twice, I had to add  more flour-water to thicken.  This recipe has a lot of ingredients and quite a few steps, and I was just a little disappointed at how it turned out.  Yes, it was O.K., smelled wonderful when cooking, but the final product just didn't live up to my expectations, just a bit bland..  Not bad, but not outstanding either.  Please don't let me discourage you from trying this recipe because we all have different tastes, and I did rate it at 4 stars.

I added Parmesan cheese in lieu of the other cheeses and let out the mushrooms.  Tasted great!

Very good recipe,I did not have a red bell pepper, so I used a green bell pepper and also put in some celery that I wanted to use up.  I don't care for Swiss Cheese, so I used Colby Jack instead.  I doubled the recipe and have 2 large casseroles. One for now and one for later.  Not sure if it will freeze well or not, but I am going to give it a try.

I followed the recipe and would bump the pasta to 12oz and substitute cornstarch for flour.

Very tasty!  I added some extra flour because it mention the sauce should’ve been thick but mine wasn’t. Add 1 extra tablespoon of flour but also did a full cup of mushrooms. We are a cheese family so I added 1/4 cup of all cheeses to the top. This meal was a hit.

Delicious!I made a few changes because of what I had on hand. Used Italian blend shredded cheese in place of the swiss cheese and I had no cream so I added a little more milk. Biggest thing was I used a leftover rottiserie chicken. My wife loved it more the second day.

This was amzing ! I love how simple the recipe is, but the favors are very complex ! I grilled the two chicken breasts in garlic/ chili infused olive oil seasoned with Cajun seasoning. This made a big difference in the sauce. it had a subtle heat which was so good. I used half yellow/red onion. Biggest change I made was using cheese raveolli. The entire family loved this recipe !! This is a keeper for sure

I'm a beginner cook so I want to take a moment to share a peeve of mine about recipes.  So often, and this is one of them they are not well written.  So much is left  ambiguous, vague, or uncertain.   What size casserole dish?  How thin the strips, and so on.  Sure you experienced cooks can wing it, but it trips me up and frustrates me.  

That said, it came out pretty good.  Not sure if it is as intended, but hey, I'm full.  

It stayed pretty liquid for me too.

This was a huge hit, I substituted mozzarella for Swiss cheese and topped with the Cracker Barrel Italiano blend of shredded cheese, I made it with Fusili pasta and it was delicious!  So good to find a new recipe that is so similar to one of our favourite restaurant meals!

My family loved it. My daughter is very picky so I made her a separate dish without the onions, peppers or mushrooms by adding a bit of the other ingredients to a small sauce pan for her sauce. Her's tasted similar to chicken Alfredo. I used penne pasta since I did not have fettuccine. I would add more pasta and mushrooms next time.

Absolutely Delicious.  I didn't change a thing except add a bit extra cheese.  A bit time consuming, but plenty of yummy leftovers.
