I gave this recipe 4 stars because I changed it a little. I used 2 jars of Heinz canned chicken gravy. (it's low fat and lower sodium than soup) I used sauteed fresh mushrooms and also added 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef while cooking. I used frozen veggies since I think canned ones are really gross! It was really good with some cheese sprinkled on top of the potatoes the last 15 minutes of baking. My husband has requested that I make this once a week! Thanks for the great recipe - even though I tweeked it a bit - I hardly ever stick to an original recipe, though.

Excellent! This is the only way I can get my toddler to eat vegetables. Here are some changes I thought made it even better, though: (I used instant mashed potatoes to save time) I started with a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then a layer of shredded cheddar cheese (1 to 2 cups), then the meat/vegetable layer, then the next layer of mashed potatoes, dotted with butter, and finished it off with crunchy fried onions. Cooked an extra 10-15 mins because of extra potatoes. Yummy!!

Like so many other reviewers, I changed this a bit. I used 7 potatoes, boiled them for 15 minutes, then mashed in about 3 TBS Country Crock spread and a few TBS milk. For the filling, I used the ground beef, 2 stalks of celery (chopped), half a small onion (diced), a 15-oz can of kernal corn, a can of 'shrooms, and a couple handfuls of frozen peas. I omitted the celery soup. I did use a can of mushroom soup, plus a splash or three of milk and a few TBS of sour cream. Yum! As recommended by MLTS, I decided to do potatoes on the bottom, then filling, then potatoes on top. Oh, I also used an 8" square pan for a thick pie, and it was almost overflowing - in fact, I put foil under it in the oven because the filling started to ooze around the potatoes! Very tasty! Thanks for sharing, Sue! Maybe this will convince my husband that Shepherd's Pie isn't horrible!

Best shepherd's pie ever! Only thing I did differently was I added a packet of Lipton onion soup, 1 beef boullion cube and 1 cup of water to the beef. I think it made the taste of the beef stand out a little more. I let it simmer for about 5 minutes until all the liquid was absorbed then added frozen mixed veggies and the soups.  I also topped it off with an italian blend of shredded cheese the last 15 minutes of cooking.

Drain the liquid off the veggies!!  Of course I couldn't JUST do the recipe... I added about 2tb of worcestershire sauce and 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the meat. To the potatoes (Dan Quale WAS correct) I left the peels, added milk, 1/2 stick of butter, 2 cloves of roasted garlic, and 1/2 -1/3 cup of Tillamook medium cheddar cheese (grated). Whipped untill creamy. WOW- it was great!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!  My whole family loved it.  I did follow some of the advice from others and doubled the mashed potatoes.  Also, to help give it more gravy, I used chunky vegetable soup instead of mixed vegetables - and I also added a can of whole kernel corn. I will use this recipe again and again.

I don't know why people rate recipes either high or low when they have altered the recipe, added ingredients and even water... and complain that it's not right or soupy. I fixed this recipe pretty much as is except I had more hamburger so I added one more can of Cream of Mushroom soup and a few more potatoes for the top. My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. This is a great recipe, thanks STP.

Don't waste your time with this one; I thought it sounded bland -- added Worcestershire, rosemary, Montreal steak seasoning, shredded Cheddar cheese, & parsley flakes.  Leftovers went from the fridge to the trash can.  Sorry about the brutal review, but honesty is the best policy...

I like to make this with a jar of mushroom gravy instead of the cream of mushroom soup. It makes a more traditional shepherd's pie and I think adds more flavor.

When browning the beef I added a clove minced garlic also a tablespoon dried minced onion and a little seasoning salt. In my mashed potates I added a mixture of two cubes chicken boulion in 1/4 cup water (boiling) and let dissolve I also added an egg and a little milk and garlic, minced onion and a dash of seasoning salt. I topped with Chedder and sprinkled paprika on top of the cheese. It tasted absolutely amazing

This is a great recipe that is fool proof!  I dolled it up a bit but that is the fun with a basic recipe.

First, I have never made mashed potatoes with reserved water.  Use milk, sour cream, yogourt or any other dairy product to make a richer batch.

Who can brown ground beef without adding an onion?  I included a good sized white onion that gave depth to the taste.

I did not have canned vegatables, but a package of frozen vegatables worked well.

After I assembled the dish, a generous sprinkle of paprika was a good finishing touch.

Here is a caution.  I used a good sized baking dish and it still ran over.  Put a drip catcher under the pie when baking and save work in the long run.  Until next time - enjoy!

This was a nice comfort meal, and I suspect it will be very nice during the cold weather.  I added shredded sharp cheddar to the mashed potatoes, and then sprinkled some on top before baking.  I also added some Worcestire sauce to the ground beef, for a little more flavour.  The family enjoyed it.

We love this. I save time by buying the pre made real mashed potatoes. I also add an extra 8.25 oz can of mixed vegtables. I really love the mushrooms in it but my son doesnt so I make half with and half without mushrooms.

Want to make this healthier? Use natural ingredients!  Instead of the soup, use about 1/2 cup sour cream and milk, mix in a TBSP of brown gravy mix, some ketchup and whisk together.  Use fresh or flash frozen veggies instead of canned. I used peas and carrots.  Sautee onions and garlic with lean ground beef or ground turkey.  Season with salt and pepper. Top with real mashed potatoes and dot with real butter. Pack up tomorrow's lunch before serving because there won't be any left!

I used to loathe shepherd's pie when I was a kid, but for some reason, thought I'd give it a shot with this recipe, mainly because some of the fantastic tweaks done by the other reviewers. Added cup of water with beef boullion cube and packet of onion soup to the beef before adding soups and veggies. Put mashed potatoes on bottom, then cheese, then beef, then more potatoes. Delicious. My boyfriend, who was skeptical, because "Shepherds pies are usually bland" ate it up. The kids too! Will definately make it again!

This is a good base recipe, but like so many others I made a few changes to suit our tastes.  I seasoned the ground beef as it was cooking with rosemary & thyme.  I also used fresh baby carrots, a small onion, chopped celery and some mushrooms rather than canned veg (yuck).  I mashed the potatoes with a little butter and milk and left out the butter on top.  I baked for 25 min.  then added shredded cheddar and baked until bubbly (about 5 min.).  This was really good with my changes.  My hubby and my daughter both liked it so we will have it again.

When browning ground beef add a cut up onion and spices to your taste for more flavor. Use fresh or frozen vegetables. Only use 1 can of cream (mushroom) soup - 2 cans made it too soupy. Add cheese to top when baking. This recipe was Okay - Thanks for posting

It was St Patrick's Day yesterday, so I invited friends and made the traditional Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner. However my daughter doesn't like Corned Beef so I decided to include a Shepherds Pie, and I tried this recipe. She loved it and so did everyone else! 

A great recipe to spice up to your own likes. In regards to the mashed potatoes, I followed my own recipe, I use evaporated milk and lots of butter, salt and pepper. 

To the ground beef, I added a large chopped onion, some garlic, salt, pepper, celery salt and red pepper flakes. 

For the one can of mixed vegetables, I instead used two cans of green beans. 

Once all put together, I baked until the potatoes began turning a nice golden brown, I removed from the oven and covered the top with grated cheddar cheese and popped back into the oven until the cheese was melted. 

This I will make a again splitting it in half, one for dinner and one for the freezer. Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious! I did tweak it a little. I used ground turkey that I browned in a frying pan with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and worschire sauce. Also, I cooked double the potatoes so I could line the bottom and cover the top with them. I added garlic, butter, cheddar cheese and a little milk to the potatoes. I put in a 1/2 a bag of frozen peas and a 1/2 a bag of mixed veggies. I did not add the celery soup. Instead I added 1 can of cream of mushroom and some milk and flour. I guess I changed a lot, but it was good.

Thought the way the recipe was written, it might be bland, so added onion, garlic, celery, & green pepper to the meat while browning. Didn't have any mushrooms, so left those out. I added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the top of the potatoes about 15 minutes before I was to take it out of oven. Very good, & usually have all of these ingredients on hand.

I made a couple changes and hubby and I both loved it :)  First of all, since there is just us I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan.  I used cream of broccoli soup & frozen veggies as opposed to canned.  After adding the meat and veggies mixture to the pan, I dotted that with about a tablespoon of the butter, added the potatoes, then dabbed the rest of the butter.  Then, I baked it for 25 min., pulled it out and topped it with cheese then baked it another 10 minutes and served with cornbread.  Was a good dish for a chilly fall evening :)

I've always liked Shepherd's Pie, but I've never tried cooking it myself.  My husband has never tasted it, so I thought I'd try to cook it.  I'm telling you, my husband loved it! He said I should cook it more often.  He didn't know it was my first time! This recipe was so easy to follow and it tastes great! Thanks!

I have used this as a basic recipe more times than I care to mention. It's fantastic! But I am an experimental cook. I love trying new flavors and new concepts. So here's my recommendation: start with the basic recipe first. Really. Try it just the way it is written. Then make modifications as you wish. I have added Worcestershire sauce to the meat and it was great. I have swapped out the soups for premixed gravy and that was awesome. I have put cheese on top and crust on the bottom to make it pot pie-ish. This last time I used a can of tomato paste with gravy mix. It always comes out delicious. But the recipe, as written, will not fail you.

This was really good, but I made a lot of changes, first off I sauteed the beef with onions, added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas, seasoned with salt & pepper and a bit of all spice, when it was all cooked I added a can of Heinz Mushroom Gravy instead of the condensed soup cans.  I also used the Betty Crocker instant mashed potatoes (2 pouches), sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top and baked it in the oven for 30 minutes @ 350.  Following that I set it on broil for a few minutes to get a nice golden top.  It was really good and my family really enjoyed it and asked that it becomes a staple recipe.  This is what I would do a bit differnetly next time: I would only use 1/2 a can of gravy, and I would doulbe the amount of mashed potatoes and put a layer on the bottom and the top.

This was a big hit at the homeless shelter.  I recommend it for occasions when you need to serve lots of people a well-balanced meal!  We also used vegetarian hamburger crumbles in one batch and no one could tell the difference.  They're pre-cooked, too, so that helps.

excellent recipe.  Shepherd's pie is traditionally supposed to be plain and simple.  Even though there are simple ingredients, it is far from plain.

Pretty good, but needed more seasoning. We also used the light versions of the two soups, and it was yummy. Also we seasoned the potatoes with lots of garlic. Will make again!

I used fresh veggies, carrots, celery, onions, and frozen peas.  I sauteed the carrots and celery, added onion and garlic. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  I did end up truning on the broiler to crisp up the top.

Quick, easy, and tasted good. I added a layer of cheese before the mashed potatoes. I would make this again.

Despite following the recipe this was bland and lifeless, not to metion watery(?). Not the hearty dish that I recall from childhood. Guess I need to try to figure that one out on my own.

Went with just the cream of celery soup, as well as about 2 tbsp of minced garlic, in my ground beef and veggie mixture. Per another reviewer, I did a thin layer of mash on the bottom of the pan with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top of that. Then the layer of beef and veg, a sprinkle of garlic salt, and my thick layer of mash. About 1/4c of chopped green onions finish off the top of the pie. It was delicious! *I should also note that I prepare my mashed potatoes with a generous helping of milk, salt, and black pepper, and whip them with the hand mixer until fluffy and light*

This was a great quick meal and made a ton of leftovers!
I used instant potatoes (8 servings on the box) to speed up my cooking time. I also didn't have a cream of celery soup so used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Worked GREAT! Very creamy and yummy. Not sure why so many people said it came out soupy, mine was not that way at all. Used 2 cups of frozen/thawed veggies. (carrots/corn/pean) And sprinkled the top with shredded chedder (a handful) about 10 minutes before it was done. Wonderful and yummy! Thanks.

We liked it alot. I made the sauce as suggested, added a little worshestire sauce, frozen vegetable mix. I used both cream of mushroom and celery. I wouldn't omit either one of them otherwise it would have come out too dry. I guess I like a little sauce with my potatoes. Too much meat sauce for the amount of potatoes. Either double the potatoes or save half of the meat sauce and freeze it (which I did). This way it makes a quick easy dinner next time. I did put grated cheddar cheese on top and mashed my potatoes with butter and a little milk. I used 8x8 glass dish.

I've been looking for something like this for quite a while. I liked the taste of this, but I thought it was a bit too soupy, not as firm as I would have liked. 

First of all, I added chopped onions, garlic and celery to the beef as I was browning it. I also added some oregano and Worchestershire sauce. I cooked it down until it was nearly dry before adding only one can of cream of mushroom soup. I thought a second can would make it too wet and I'm glad I did. Also, I added a little cream to the potatoes because I thought they were too dry. I also over salted a little. 

But all in all, it was pretty good and quite filling.

My family loves this Shepherd's Pie! The only changes I made were to increase the amount of mashed potatoes on top (we prefer making them from Yukon Gold potatoes), and to use frozen veggies in place of the canned.  Excellent recipe!

Mmmm, we liked this! I used frozen mixed veggies and fresh mushrooms and omitted the butter on top, but followed the recipe other than that. It actually is pretty healthy if you use healthy selection soups, omit the butter and use 93% fat ground beef. As for spices, I sauteed some garlic and minced onion with the ground beef and added some more garlic and onion powder after I mixed the veggies together. I will definitely make this again!

I made this according to the recipe with a couple of minor exceptions - I used 1.25 lbs ground beef (only because my grocery store sells it packaged that way, impossible to get only one pound) and I added some chopped onion and a clove of garlic while I was browing the ground beef, in addition to some mixed steak seasoning I had in the pantry.  Even with that, I thought it could use a little more seasoning, although it tasted good, was simply a little on the bland side.  I left off the butter on top of the mashed potatoes and instead topped with some grated cheese based on several other reviews and thought that was a tasty addition.  I would definitely make this again, possibly adding celery and green peppers with the onion and garlic during the browning, and maybe a little more seasoning like chili powder and paprika.  It makes quite a bit and is very filling, so I would consider splitting between two pans (if you are cooking for a small family) and putting one in the freezer for later.

YUM!  I altered just a bit.  I made the mashed potatoes with a bit of cream cheese, milk and garlic.  I put a small layer on the bottom of the pan before the meat went on.  For veggies, I used a carton of fresh mushrooms, a can of carrots, a can of corn, and half a bag of frozen peas.  I also sauteed an onion with the beef.  After the meat and remaining potatoes were added to the dish, I sprinkled 1/2 pound of cheddar cheese on top.  Delish!

this recipe is super easy and super fast, i love it! if you add a raw egg to potatos while mashing them, they will come out nice and golden out of the oven. also, i put some cheese on top of the potatoes before they go in the oven, for a little extra goodness. 

you can make chicken pot pie in a similar way, just switch out beef for chicken and potatoes for pillsbury pastry.

This was a great recipe.  My husband actually liked it!  The only things I did differently were:  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the ground beef and seasoned it with Tony Cacheries(?), instead of mixed veggies, I cut and steamed fresh carrots and added them to the beef mixture...and lastly, I made the mashed potatoes with milk and butter.  I thought there were plenty of mashed potatoes for the dish...I might have prefered more ground beef!  I will definitly make this again.

This was truly fantastic. I made changes for things i had on hand/prefer. I browned the ground beef. While that was cooking I microwaved pea/mushroom frozen veggies in the steam bag. Then i mircrowaved betty crocker's mashed potatoes (i usually make them from scratch, but it was a weeknight and they tasted really good). Once the meat was browned i added a teaspoon of minced garlic and some onion powder, s & p. I threw in the veggies when they were done and a can of cream of mushrooms and golden mushroom soup (i used slight less then the whole can of that). I mixed. 

In the casserole dish i layered potatoes, then some shredded cheese, then the meat/veg mixture, then potatoes, then cheese. I baked it on 420 for 15 minutes, then added some fried onions (canned) and baked for 5 more minutes. Yum!

I loved this recipe! We are a vegetarian household, but we like some flair in our food, so I used the Morning Star ground beef substitute. I also whipped the potatoes in my mixer with a little sour cream. I sprinkled cheddar cheese over the meat layer. I also used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup since I only had 1 can of cream of mushroom. I would also suggest to make double the mashed potatoes. I had a thin layer of mashed potatoes, but it was still amazing! Thanks so much!!

My husband,son and parnets loved this sheherd's pie!
I did do a few changes.I added 2 more potatos...an extra pound of hamberger and a half of cup of onions and dry Lipton onion soup.
I cooked the hamberger in water...drained,added dry lipton onion soup and the onion.After cooking a couple of minutes I added the can soups.
Then I spread the mash potatos(which I added salt,pepper,garlic,butter and cream to) on top,baked 45 minutes,then added shredded cheese on top and cooked 10 more minutes.
I did not add the veggies.I had broccoli and peas on the side.I did have to cook more potatos which I served on the side too.Sounds like a lot of work but really it was not.Family said I did a great job.
Next time I am going to layer corn beef hash on the bottom...the hamberger mixure in the middle and then the mash potato on top.The corn beef hash is my husband's idea and it sounds good.

As per other reviewer's suggestions, I added 1/2 onion, 1 clove of garlic and some Italian seasoning to the meat as well as some Worchester sauce.  I also left out the can of celery soup and used frozen vegetables.  The meat mixture tasted great, but unfortunately was buried under an inordinate amount of mashed potatoes.  I literally had to search out the meat from underneath the potatoes.  As a result, I would suggest lessening the amount of potatoes or increasing the meat mixture.  In the end though, it’s hardly the same recipe after all the changes I made so I don’t think it fair to give it too low of a rating.  Besides, if I had been more aware of disproportion of mashed potatoes versus the amount of meat mixture I may have held back on the potatoes and it could have turned out pretty yummy after all...  I'm going to keep looking for other Shepherd's Pie recipes...

Oh, this recipe was amazing!  Some other reviewers noted that there was not too much flavor so I made sure that I added seasoned salt and Mrs dash to the recipe and the beef.  I also added onion.  My husband loved it so much he took the rest to work the next day for lunch...which never happens!

This was my first attempt at this sort of dish so I picked one I thought would be easy. And this sure was. Very easy and very good. I put cheddar cheese on the top of the potatoes and seasoned my meat and instant mashed potatoes with cajun seasoning. My husband wants me to make this regularly because it was great for dinner and lunch the next day. Use 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef and put in a 2 quart dish.

I used a can of cream of tomato in place of the celery soup, added a little shredded cheese to the potatoes, and sprinkled a little more on top.  This was devoured so fast I almost didn't get any!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Yum! Made this last night and my husband already wants me to make it again. I sauteed a half onion and lots of garlic, then cooked it with the meat. Used instant potatoes (8 servings) and stirred in some grated cheese. When finished, topped with a few more sprinkles of cheese and finely chopped fresh parsley. Very easy to make and so good we couldn't wait to have some more today! :)

I really didn't like this dish.  It was bland and had too much creamed soup in it.  I will definitely go back to my old Shepherd's Pie recipe.

Lots of pre-packaged ingredients..... my kids like it but they are 2 and 8.  I thought it was OK.  I added pepper to the veggie meat mix.

Best Shepherd's Pie ever.  We substituted the canned veggies with a pack of bird's eye frozen, and then added extra frozen corn.  We also added a pack of onion soup mix.  We'll definitely b making this again!! Yum!

As is, its a good foundation recipe. The first time I made it, it lacked the flavor I was hoping for so I improvised the second time. It was very flavorful with the following alterations; After draining the fat from the (2 LB) ground beef, saute 1/2 yellow onion diced, 2 diced celery stalks and 1 large minced clove of garlic. Mix together the soups, beef, saute and vegetables. Slice 8 oz FRESH mushrooms and 3 pats of butter to the bottom of the baking dish and bake about 5 minuted before adding the remaining ingredients. When mashing your potatoes, use milk & 2 Tbs butter instead of the water. A few minutes before removing from the oven, change the temperature to BROIL to brown the top of the potatoes. ENJOY!!

You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  It's sooo easy and my whole family loves it.  I've made it a bunch of times.  The first time as written (but butter and milk in potatoes, not the liquid) and it was really tasty.  The next time I add worchestire sauce, onions and garlic to the meat while browning, and it was even better.  I think any way you make this dish, it will turn out great!!  Thanks STP!!!

Made this tonight for the first time.  I did make a few adjustments based on some of the reviews I read (substituted beef gravy for the soups).  I also sauteed an onion prior to browning the meet.  It was DELICIOUS.

Didn't have cream of celery so used cream of chicken. I did have to add a good bit of salt and pepper, and cooked my "meat" (vegetarian) in some onions and garlic for more flavor. Used frozen veggies too. With a little added spice this was a 5-star, but as is it was a bit too bland so I went with 4.

Simple recipe with great flavor.  I have been making this recipe for several years now and my husband and son ask for it on a regular basis.  Sometimes I just use leftover veggies from the frige rather than the can of mixed veggies.  Still turns out great.  I also like to put cheddar cheese on top but by judging from the pic's that are posted, so do alot of people.  Thanks for sharing!

The flavor of the ingredients was really very good. I adapted the recipe to my slow cooker, which didn't work out too well. It ended up being more of a soup/stew! But it tasted great!

This was ok and very soupy. I read the reviews and added a packet of onion soup and some water to the beef. I also added some worchester sauce and ketchup to the beef,veggie and soup mixture. The cream of celery added a weird flavor but it was better baked. I added some milk and sour cream to my potatoes and it made them very mushy in this dish. I think next time I would only use one soup and probably golden mushroom or something with more of a beef flavor.

This is a great base recipe, here are my tweaks: Sauteed onions and garlic first, then added the beef and cooked it all together. After draining the beef and combining the soups, I used fresh frozen veggies. Mixed it all together and added enough Irish Killians beer to make it soupy. I let it simmer the alcohol out before doing the rest.

Mashed Yukon gold potatoes with cream and butter for the topping.

Even the kids liked it!! To die for.

This was really tasty!  I changed the recipe up a little.  I used 3 potatoes, used half the meat and instead added some sauteed onions, broccoli, and celery to the meat mixture, and baked it in a 9x9 square pan, and it turned out well.  It only cost us about $10 to make and it fed us both with more than enough leftover for lunch.

Very kid friendly recipe. I sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on top 10 mins before baking time was complete. I did not have mixed veggies so I used green beans. Will try with corn next time. This is a nice basic recipe that I will be making often!

I've always used cream of mushroom in my shepherd's pie.  I didn't follow all steps though.  I used 1lb ground turkey, 2 pouches of garlic & herb mashed potato mix and a little bit of nibblet corn.  i did cook the potatoes with 1 can of veggie broth and 2 cups of water to give it the missing veggie flavor.  i made this in a small square casserole dish and buttered the dish instead of sprayed it.  i put a small portion of potatoes on the bottom of the dish, just enough for a thinish layer.  sprinkled some corn on top of that.  i browned my meat and added garlic salt, pepper, salt, and a sprinkling of basil.  i added a large can of cream of mushroom soup and stirred them together.  i put that in the dish, then put the remaining potatoes on top of that.  i dotted it with butter and added another sprinkling of pepper. yum!

My partner loved this. For dietary reasons next time I will change up a bit. First time around I used a whole small box of instant potatoes (felt like cheating) and that was way too much for me personally so here goes for my changes: I would up the meat to 1 1/2-2lbs which I browned with a little garlic and olive oil, salt and pepper and steak seasoning. Not really sure what the canned mushrooms added so next time will only add if I have some already in the pantry. I did a large can of Veg-All but next time I think I'll add just a can or two of corn and 2 cans green beans. I was served this once by an Englishman who layered it with meat, veggies, potatoes, and then cheese. Might try the cheese but not exactly a healthy addition! Lots of juice so it could stand to handle more veggies if using the recipe as stated. Very good and easy when using instant taters so something I will keep around for one of those nights where meal-in-a-bowl is welcomed!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I probably would have added some onions to the ground beef while browning if I was just making this for myself, but my kids and hubby don't like onions so I left them out.  Everyone raved about it and there was just a serving left over, which my daughter and I split later in the evening!  Very delicious and easy.  Great way to get veggies in the kids diets.  I'll definitely be making this regularly!

I thought that this is a good and easy recipe.  I did make a few changes though.  I sauteed coarsely chopped onion and minced fresh garlic clove, and then added the extra lean ground beef.  There was no need to drain.  I also steamed fresh carrots and then chopped them, added one can of peas, the mushrooms and the soups.  I also added mild cheddar on top of the potatoes the last 15 minutes of baking.  I will definitely make this again, but I am going to substitute a can of onion soup for the celery because the celery taste was a little too strong for us.

it was good, but honestly isn't anything topped with mashed potatoes and cheese good? Added mixed veg. from freezer section and instead of cream of mushroom i added a jar of mushroom gravy. Added onions to the meat when I cooked it. Needs salt. Good left overs.

I thought this was Delicious!! I did season the beef as I cooked it with garlic and onion powder and creole seasoning too. I also used a box of garlic and herb mashed potatoes instead of making from scratch. I definitely think the boxed potatoes are the way to go!! Next time I will use lower sodium soups since the processed potatoes have so much salt in them. So easy and no leftovers!

Living in Okinawa, Japan, you definitely don't get that many opportunities to eat Sheperd's pie.
 Followed acouple of the other reviews Directions, Made my potatoes differently and added cheese at the end.
 but I gotta tell you, That dish is Amazing.

The family loves this recipe -- it is Scrumptious!  Great comfort food; very easy to prepare.  To really simplify, I try to keep cooked ground beef on hand, so I can throw this together quickly.  I have also used the "store bought" ready-made mashed potatoes (trying to stay away from instant).  Using precooked meat and ready made potatoes, meal goes together very quickly.

This makes a great hearty main dish. It needed a little more flavor for me so I add onions, parsley, garlic or other seasoning. Also, I occassionally exchange the ground beef for left over chicken or turkey. Venison or cubed beef work well too. If you don't have much time, you can use instant potatoes as a short cut.

Excellent! I took some comments from others and used them - I cooked the ground meat with an onion and garlic. I also used a bag of frozen peas and a bag of frozen corn. Doubling the potatoes allowed for a layer of potatoes on the bottom of the casserole dish and I also used fresh mushrooms. Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe, but, I did change it a bit.  1)I used ground turkey. 2) 1 small onion & 3 garlic cloves to saute the meat with 3) I used fresh mushrooms & green beans 4) I also used a can of corn 
This was a great base recipe!!  I can't wait to try it with ground beef.

Awesome!  I'd never had Shepherd's pie before and didnt think I'd like it, but my husband  asked me to make it for St Patrick's day.  I added some frozen peas and substituted a 2nd can of cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have cream of celery, and I topped it with shredded cheddar and it was delicious!!  I will definately make it every March!

This turned out great and I will make it again.  This time instead of the canned vegetables, I used fresh vegetables I had on hand, cooking them in a little butter and broth.  I also added some dry sherry.  Great, fast recipe!

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!  I did take the advice of others by doubling the potatoes.  It was PERFECT!!  We all loved it so much we ate it for dinner the next night!  I give it 5 stars, even though I modified it just a bit!

I had lots of mashed potatoes left over from Christmas and I needed something to do with them...I hadn't had Shepherd's pie since I was a kid.  This recipe (minus the celery soup) was wonderful!!!  My DH loved it as did I.  I think it would be too loose with another soup, and just the one wasn't overpowering.  Also as a child we always used corn, because it is sweet and adds a nice balance of flavors.  I simply used a birdseye steamer bag full of carrots, corn and green beans.  I steamed them first and added them in place of the veggies in the recipe.  PERFECT.  Just enough of that sweet corn flavor. One other touch, I put grated cheddar cheese on top. This recipe is great to tweek to your taste.

I cut back on the soup.  I used only one can of cream of mushroom and left the other can out.  It would have been too soupy with it.  I also mashed more potatoes than called for, used frozen mixed veggies and added extra cheese on top.  I also put extra seasonings.  I'd say this was a pretty good recipe.

Need plenty of spices to add flavor.  Otherwise, it was ordinary although I appreciated the simplicity of the recipe.  I used instant potatos to save time.

This was just ok.  I added fresh rosemary and worchestershire to the beef, just to jazz it up a bit, I thought it was too generic otherwise.  Hubby was not too fond of it, but ate it anyway.  Not sure I will make this again, maybe if I am stuck in a rutt for something to make.  I think there are better recipes for this out there.  It is very easy though, which I liked.

Good but a little bland. I added garlic & onion powder,beef boullion powder, minced onion. I only used 1 can of soup (too soupy w/2) & 1 1/2 lbs gr. beef. Turned out great. Fantastic leftovers!

This is really a wonderful dish, but I had a couple of modifications. Since I don't like the cans of mixed veggies, I just use a can of green beans instead. I also go ahead and mash the potatos with milk too. Every time I serve this to someone for the first time, they love it.

I felt the recipe as written was just OK.  After making some changes, we liked it much better.  Added sauted onions, garlic powder, & parsley flakes. I also sprinkled some beef boullion crystals into soup mixture to give it more of a beefy flavor. Had to substitute cr. of chicken for the celery, but tasted just as good.  Added some cubed potatoes to the mixture before mashing the rest, which we liked.  But I definitely recommend using instant potatoes instead - cuts the prep time in more than half.  If you really like the cubes added to the beef mixture, you can always throw in some frozen hash browns - same result.

Very good although it needed a little something maybe next time I will make it with tomato soup or red sauce with a little garlic or so........ I put 4 kraft single slices down before the potatoes and it turned out excellent!

Excellent recipe.Will definitely add it to family favorites. My husband loves onions so I added two chopped onions while browning the hamburger. I added one tablespoon of beef soup base mix to the two cans of cream of mushroom soup (didn't have cream of celery soup on hand)for a nice brown gravy.  And instead of the canned veggies, I used leftover cooked carrots, broccoli, corn, and green beans.I didn't add any salt because the beef soup base mix has some salt in it. Absolutely delicious. Thanks Sue.

Fantastic! The first Shepherd's Pie recipe I've tried, but I will look no further! I used instant garlic mashed potatoes and topped it with Chedder cheese and it is a frequent request at my house! Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!

I doubled this recipe for church.  Made the meat mixture the night before and then topped it with instant mashed potatos and cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it.  The kids that were there even gave me hugs!

Very good for an easier version. Next time I'll probably use fresh veggies because canned veggies just really taste like canned veggies no matter what you do with them. My family liked it

This is delicious! I spiced up a bit by putting a layer of crescent rolls on the bottom of the pan and topped the dish off with some cheese! A+++++ I will most definitely be making this again. Also it feeds an entire army so be prepared for lunch for the rest of the week :)

Great recipe! We used about 1.5 lb ground beef and a few more potatoes than the recipe called for, we also added a whole bunch of carrot chunks, garlic, and fresh onions to the mix with the mixed veggies and mushrooms. Definitely drain the veggies!

This is great! I made it with ground beef and vegetarian style and it was devoured! I did use Worcestershire sauce and some garlic for flavoring but other than that it's the same recipe.

I also made a few adjustments: used 1 jar beef gravy and 1 cup sour cream as suggested, with 1 lb ground beef and 1 pound turkey sausage, with sliced fresh mushrooms and onion browned and drained.  Had left over mashed potatoes as the topping.  YUM!

I jumped on the bandwagon and made a couple changes. I used Progresso Pot Stew added to the hamburger, and I did not add mushrooms. Other than that, I followed everything else and everyone loved it. I will be making this again.

This recipe is delicious! I made a few modifications using the ideas from some of the other reviews posted to this recipe. I used Bob Evan's sour cream and chive instant mashed potatoes for the bottom of the pan and the top of the filling (it took 3 containers). I used the idea of spreading shredded cheddar cheese on the bottom layer of potatoes and finished it with the crunchy fried onions from MLTS. I sauteed onion and mushrooms together until they cooked down and then added the beef. Instead of draining the beef juice, added McCain's onion and beef gravy mix to the juices while cooking the beef with the onions & mushrooms. I then added a 15 oz can of whole kernel (from BMCAR) corn and 15 oz of frozen vegetables. I then took the idea from Duckball and used 8 oz of sour cream instead of cream of celery soup. Other than these changes, I stuck to the recipe. It was DELICIOUS!

I followed the recipe as written but it turned out too runny and not much flavor. I did drain the canned vegetables. Without changing the recipe, I have to rate it low.

This turned out pretty good, I only had mushroom soup so I used 2 cans of that. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It was good, a change from my usual beef broth shepherds pie recipe.

VERY GOOD! Everyone loved this hearty meal! I didn't have mushrooms so I used an onion, used a can of peas and carrots instead of mixed veggies, and instant Butter & Herb mashed potatoes to save me some time. I will certainly be making this again!

Simple and tasty. I used pre-made mashed potatoes the second time, and it was still good. But I must warn you that it added a lot more liquid.

I have been looking for a quick and tasty Shepherd's Pie recipe and this is it. Great comfort food. I did modify a bit based on preference, it was excellent. Instead of cream of celery I found Campbell's Beef and Mushroom soup and used that, I think that was the perfect addition and made a nice creamy and beefy gravy. I omitted the can of mushrooms, added a small onion, and substituted a 16oz bag of frozen mixed veggies instead of canned. I also added some shredded cheese and milk to the mashed potato topping. Will definitely keep this in the fall/winter rotation! Thanks!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband loved it.  He had to stop himself from having 3rds!  I would have given it 4 stars because I did tweak it slightly since it seemed to lack a bit of flavor.  I'd also make a few changes next time based on other reviews.
I added 1 box organic condensed mushroom soup but couldn't find the same in the celery soup so I added about a quarter of a can of cream of celery soup.  Next time, I'd skip that altogether.  I had to add some beef bouillon  because the flavor just wasn't really there.  This helped ALOT.  Next time, I'll add some garlic to sauté with the ground beef, I'll probably add a dash of Worcestershire to taste, less cream of mushroom...and definitely a few more potatoes.  5 wasn't enough and it wouldn't cover the entire thing.  There were so many gaps.  I added a little milk and butter to the mashed potatoes which I'd do again...and also melt cheese on top!

Very good with the following recommendations by another reviewer. Instead of the soups used 1 jar of Heinz chicken gravy. Cooked beef with 2 cloves of garlic & added cheese to the top of the casserole dish before putting it in the oven. yum, yum.

Great recipe, I did cheat a bit and used powder potatoes as a substitue and it still turned out great. I think next time I'll just stick with the mushrooms and mushroom soup, didn't quite love the celery soup taste. Will definitely be making this again, great for leftovers too!

I made this for St. Patrick's day, and it was a hit!  Everyone went back for seconds.  I did change it a little bit, because of what I had on hand.  I used instant mashed potatoes, skipped the mushrooms, frozen mixed veggies, and then added a beef biuillon cube.  Very easy, and very good!

This turned out great. I totally agree with the reviewer who suggested setting aside leftovers ahead of time, to avoid the very likely problem of having an empty pan. I made a few adjustments. First, I used seitan crumbles instead of beef (to make it vegetarian). Next, I followed some reviewers' suggestions to use a packet of onion soup mix (mixed with 1/2 cup water)--because of this, I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup. Instead of using canned veggies, I used fresh onions, celery, green beans and carrots. I didn't have mushrooms, so left them out. Yum!

This one one great, but it did need a little tweaking. I used cream of chicken soup (don't like mushroom), and cooked half of a chopped onion, couple cloves of minced garlic and about 4 tbs of Worcestershire sauce into the meat while browning. I also used frozen mixed veggies. Came out great, with requests for more!! All in all, good skeleton recipe, but definitely wiggle room to make some changes to suit tastes...

I made this vegetarian style with fake ground beef  and it was the best shepherds pie I've ever made. I like to use lima beans, corn and green beans, or whatever is leftover in the fridge. Will make this again for sure.

Very filling, very tasty.  Kids loved it.  The only thing I did differently was use more potatoes than called for, seasoning them as I would if I were to make mashed potatoes as a side dish.  I also garlic powdered the meat/vegetable mixture to taste before topping it with the potatoes.

Great!!! Followed some of the suggestions of other members, and added some seasoning salt, some garlic, and topped it with rows of tater tots instead since we had a big bag. Gave it to my boyfriend with a beer and he loved it. Very good stuff!!!

I followed the recipe but added some shredded cheese and frenchs fried onions. I think this would have tasted better with sauted vegetables instead of canned.

I made this for my family and my lilttle girl just couldnt get enough of it. I normally make a traditional Shepherd's pie with lamb, but this was a good way to use the old standby of ground beef.  I didnt have any mushrooms on hand, so to bump up the fiber, I included a can of blackeye peas.  Sounds crazy, but it went very well with the beef and veggies. I will definately be making this dish again.  Thanks!

I made this tonight for dinner, and it passed with flying colors!! Everyone complimented it, and I just barely have enough left to eat for lunch tomorrow. I should've made the honey cornbread to go with it!! Great recipe. I added a little shredded cheddar on the top about 15 minutes before it was done...

It was good and very easy. I ended up having to half it because there was only 2 of us eating. I shopped up garlic and sauteed it with the beef which gave it a great flavor. My husband is very picky and did not like it so much, but overall I thought it was pretty good.

I'd never had Shepherd's Pie before but gave this one a try. Easy and the family ate it up. I followed some suggestions and added half a chopped onion while browning the ground beef and put a tsp of Worchestire in as well.. then topped with cheddar cheese for the last 10 minutes. I will make this again.

I loved this recipe after a little tweaking.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and omited the cream of celery soup and replaced it with a packet of french onion soup mix and 1 beef boullion cube.  After browning the beef, onions and garlic(another add), I added 1 tbsp of flour and pepper.  I cooked that for a few minutes and then added a cup of water.  I let that simmer for 5 minutes and then added the cream of mushroom soup, ketchup (2 tbsp), 2 cans of veggies, and parsley.  It was great!!!  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

Great!  Instead of the salt, I added 1/2 a bag of Lipton Soup Mix like a reviewer suggested.  Had I not done that, I think it wouldn't have been as flavorful.  I drained the vegetables but later added a little water to thin it out to make it more like gravy.

WOW that was fantastic , everyone loved it...I m a begginer making sheperd's pie for the the first time (I only cooked african food all my life) and I was pleased with the results. I took many suggestions like doubling the potatoes and putting some at the bottom and I used frozen veggies instead of canned. Thanx for the recipe. Very hearty =)

I enjoyed this recipe a lot. It was a nice change to the generally tomato-based meat portion of the pie I often prepare. The only thing I didnt care for was that using the can of soup instantly upped the sodium content of the recipe exponentially - but that can be solved with using a low-sodium version of the soup.

Great recipe - I used a can of corn instead of the mixed veggies, and just the cream of mushroom soup as I was out of the other type, and it still turned out wonderful!

I used frozen veggies (corn, geeen beans, and carrots) because I think canned veggies are gross. I was pressed for time so I used packaged mashed potatoes (something I NEVER use - Grandma, forgive me) and it came out delicious. My husband was skeptical - he never liked shepherd's pie as a child (neither did I), but my daughter requested it so I figured I'd give it a shot. It was so good - way better than I remember it from my childhood. I think the soup adds a little something extra (I used cream of celery) and makes it nice and creamy. Will definitely make this again!

I made this tonight, with a few variations.  I cut up two carrots, two celery stalks and I browned the beef with 1/2 a large onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  I added frozen green beans, and put a sprinkling of breadcrumbs on top.  My family gobbled it up, but I thought it was lacking a little on flavor - I'd make it again and try and add some more spices - maybe some heat with cayenne or red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so yummy!!! I would definitely recommend using both soups. I also took the advice of another reviewer and browned the beef with minced onion and garlic. I used dried shitake mushroom slices since that is what I had. I used frozen corn for the veggies. Also, I used instant four cheese potatoes (2 pks). So good and very easy. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was pretty good. After reading some of the other reviews I also left out the can of celery soup (it would have been WAY too soupy with it). We added peas to ours but will probably try another veggie/veggies next time. I did add some garlic and broiled steak seasoning salt to the ground beef for extra flavor. Cheese is a must on top. A good basic recipe and easy to make your own.

I cooked meat with half an onion and added a bit of worcestershire sauce and a variety of spices. My children do not like green beans so I added corn and half a tomato, chopped. I only used 1 can of soup and topped the mashed potatoes with cheese, then cooked covered.  It was very good.

I made this recipe to take to a church pot luck and it turned out pretty good and was easy.  I used ground turkey instead and fried it up with one greated carrot and some chopped onion.  (I wondered WHY this recipe didnt include onion?).  I also used a can of peas and carrots, although next time I will use some frozen peas and carrots, since the color of the canned vegetables was a dull grayish color.  ICK.  I thought using 2 cans of condensed milk was a bit much, but it wasnt THAT soupy.  Next time, I will probably use a little more meat in the recipe anyways.  I also added some milk and shredded cheese to the potato mixture before adding it on top. Used an extra potato just in case, would rather have too much than not enough.  Will probably half this recipe next time for my hubby and I, and might use instant potatoes if in a hurry.  This is a great recipe to make early in the day when you have time, then just pop in the oven later in the day when the usual hassles start.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you Sue for this.  I have been looking for a recipe for Shepherd's Pie and this was the one.
I used corn and fresh mushrooms along with onions and it was a hit with my husband.  We enjoyed it just
as much the next day.  This has become part of my collection of recipes.

This was creamy and very tasty.  My husband and I both loved it.  I added all sorts of frozen (I prefer them instead of canned) vegetables, real mushrooms, and made a few more potatoes than called for.  Great recipe!

We use one can of Cream of Brocoli instead of Cream of Celery and that adds a lot of flavor.  It's easy to make and will be in our regular rotation.

This recipe is so simple and was a complete success. I used instant mashed potatoes (butter and herb flavor), ground turkey, peas, carrots, spinach and celery, and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.

Sadly, my husband and I did not like this very much.  But I know people have different tastes, so if this sounds good to you, you should give it a try!  The prep was very easy, so that is why I gave it two stars.

I suggest using instant mashed potatoes (make enough for 8 servings).  Tastes great and cuts a lot of the preparation time.  I don't care for Shepard's pie normally, but this recipe is very delish.

Wonderful.  My 2 year old loves this!  I skip mashing my own potatoes and buy instant.  Definately try this recipe with instant roasted garlic potatoes (I use Idahoan brand), they add a terrific flavor to the dish!

This was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Was so easy to make! I just sauted onions with the ground beef,  used instant mashed potatoes and topped the potatoes with cheese.  My family loved it.  I wasn't quite sure about draining the mushrooms and veggies, but I drained them anyway and it turned out great.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I also added garlic and onion to the mix, as well as fresh mushrooms (not canned) and frozen veggies.  Easy and pretty tasty, however I feel it's lacking something.  Will probably make again but will be in search of that needed spice.

Really great taste!  I made it with chopped ham instead of ground beef, and it was delicious.  I also added cheese, milk, and butter to the mashed potatoes.  It's already a family favorite!

This delightful soup will warm you from within.  I have tried it several times now and it will always have a starring role in my soup repertoire.  I agree with those who suggest the lighter sour cream, and I once made it with yoghurt instead.  Awesome!

Yummy and filling! I thought this recipe was VERY easy to make especially if you use instant potatoes on top.  I'm not a big fan of instant potatoes but in this casserole I don't think it's noticeable and it cuts down on prep time.  My husband really liked this dish and asked me to make it again.  I will!

This is really good! It took forever to make, probably partially because our oven doesn't work properly, but it was totally worth the wait!! I'm not a big fan of celery, so I just used 2 cans of mushroom soup. I also used frozen vegetables instead of canned; I just microwaved them for a couple of minutes before throwing them in the skillet. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Had leftover mashed potatoes from Christmas, so I added some butter and cheese to taste and the result was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I ate almost the entire pie myself.

This was a hearty dish made with simple pantry ingredients. Based on other reviewers’ comments, I sautéed fresh mushrooms, 2 cloves garlic, half an onion, and 2 stalks celery after I browned the beef, and prior to adding the remaining ingredients to the skillet. I also opted for frozen veggies instead of canned. I prepared the meal in the morning and refrigerated it until dinner time. It was ready to pop in the oven. I baked for 40 minutes uncovered to compensate for the cold casserole.

I made this for dinner last night but added a few things. I’ve never been one to follow the recipe to a ‘T’  Added sausage links (quartered), a zucchini, turmeric to the ground beef as it was cooking, with garlic, yellow onions and bacon! Cut the bacon into bits then fried it up on its own. Cooked the sausage in a toaster oven and combined everything together. Smoothed the potatoes on the top, covered with cheese. Baked for 15 min then put French fried onions on the top and cooked it for another another 15 or so. Family loved it, might have turned it into a casserole

This was a nice "comfort food" dish that definitely stuck to the ribs, but the taste was unfortunately very "blah".  This is after I substituted 8oz of fresh sauteed mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic, and some Worcestershire.  I will make it again as nobody actually disliked it, but I will try to see what else I can do to add some flavor.

Great recipe. I add a block of shredded sharp cheddar between the mix and the mashed potatoes. I also make the mashed potatoes a little different with sour cream and lots of butter.

I use a simpler recipe on this dish.  No can of mushrooms and no celery soup and I sometimes use instant mash potatoes and add a little garlic.  Salt and pepper to taste. Everything else is the same.   I've been making it for years and its one of my husbands favorite dishes in the winter.

Great, simple recipe. Made mine with 5lbs potatoes mashed with the fat from the browned meat plus a little cream and plenty of butter. Also sautéed a sweet onion in with 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground lamb. Salt, pepper, and a handful of Penzey’s spices.

Other people’s reviews were very helpful for this recipe. I took others’ advice and put milk, margarine and garlic in the potatoes. I also added dill. I used veggie ground round as I am a vegetarian and found I only needed one of the soups. I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and the sliced mushrooms. I was sure to drain the veggies as someone else suggested. Also, after half an hour in the oven I switched it to broil so the top got nice and browned and crispy! Yum.

Had leftover mashed potatoes and green bean supreme after Thanksgiving.  Great way to use things up.  I would season the potatoes a little more next time but wonderful/simple recipe.

Added some crushed garlic and chopped onion when frying meat. Used 10 potatoes instead of 5. Added some milk and sour cream to the potatoes (instead of reserved liquids). Sprinkled grated cheese over the mashed potatoes. Delicious. My family loved it!

I made per the recipe except I put butter and milk in the potatoes. It was very bland. If I made it again I would fry an onion with the beef, add tomato paste, garlic and black pepper.  I put ketchup all over it to get it down.  I did like the creamy texture the soup gave it.

Actually merged three recipes; 

Mashed potatoes (2-3 large Idaho) and garlic with a little cooking liquid and 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese.  

For meat mixture, added 1/2  onion, finely chopped and 3 cups frozen mixed vegetables. Left out canned mushrooms.

Added 5 minutes at 400 degrees convection roast to brown the top.

Great recipe!  I added fresh chopped onion and frozen mixed veggies to the beef and soup mixture.  Also used 2 lbs of ground beef, added a tablespoon of beef base and about 2 cups of water.  About 20 minutes into baking time, added some shredded cheese to the mashed potato crust.  Delicious!  Family loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Turned out great. I tweeted it a bit. Thinly sliced potatoes and butter on bottom as a crust. Bake in oven with some rosemary for a few mins. Used frozen veggies instead of caned and sautéed onions and fresh mushrooms. Assed cheese and paprika to top and added sour cream and freeze dried onions to potatoes. Great recipe to start off from because u can tweak it to your tastes :)

As many others have said, this is a delicious base recipe. I added a little Worcestershire sauce, and used fresh mushrooms, ground turkey and just for the heck of it, some bacon. My husband was apprehensive until he tasted it. Then he had thirds (haha!). I will definitely make again.

Doubled the recipe. Followed recipe but tweaked it a little.  Left out celery soup and mushrooms.  Added onion and garlic  to the raw hamburger meat before browning.  After adding the mixed veggies I also added 1 can chopped tomatoes and sprinkled in no salt seasoning.  Cooked instant potatoes instead and sprinkled in no salt seasoning to the potatoes as well.  Very good!  Last 15 minutes of cooking I  sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese.

This recipe is easy to make and delicious. I substituted the canned soup that the recipe called for and used cream of chicken and cream of potato instead. Next time I make this I may use a smaller baking dish in order for it to be a deeper pie. My family really liked it and I will definitely be making it again!

I made this in single serving pie tins so they're easier to share.  I made the mashed potato topping with a full stick of margarine and about 3/4 c of whipping cream instead of following this recipe, and also and used a frosting pipette to put the potatoes on top. Last but not least, I added a sprinkle of dried parsley for a prettier presentation.

Very good!!!! I tweaked it a bit as well.... I didn't have cream of celery so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead. I added rosemary, thyme, oregano, basil, sage, and coriander for some flavor to the meat. Only a couple shakes of each though. Very good!!!

I made this Recipe yesterday with some slight modifications.

I used fresh mushrooms vs. canned and for my Crushed Potato, I used a mix of Sweet Potatoes and English Potatoes, added Milk, Butter, Cheese, Salt and Black Pepper. Yummy!

I really like the simplicity of this Recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Super simple to make. 20 minute prep and 30 to bake. Tastes pretty good for a simple dish. I'd recommend adding shredded cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of baking time. Would have made it a 5!

No changes, I won't make it again.  I am a slow person and when I made this recipe I needed step by step instructions. I didn't know if I dranied my vegetables or not and I didn't.  My  dish was a disaster, was all runny and feel apart.  I didn't add liquid to the soups  either.  Sounded good though. Thanks anyways.

I'm giving 4 stars because it was a great base recipe.  I doubled the ground beef and added an onion, garlic, rosemary and sage while it was cooking.  I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots instead of canned.  For the mashed potatoes, I found that 5 large russet potatoes was plenty, and I mashed them with 3tbs butter and some milk to make them creamy.  All in all it came out great.  I will definitely make this again!

Made a few changes...and it was so yummy! I used Marie Callendar frozen pie crust( I know its not traditional sheperd's pie) but really made this so delicious! I also added garlic, a little ketchup, and diced tomatoes to the meat and vegetables mixture. I then made the potatoes with half-and-half & butter, spread on top and baked for about 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees. SO GOOD wow:)

While you are browning the meat I recommend adding some onion powder, garlic and black pepper otherwise it is quite bland. I also used more taters because you can never go wrong with taters.

As most of you, I followed the basic recipe but modified with preferred ingredients an for what we had  on hand.   

First, we used frozen corn niblets as the main veggie.  My wife insists on this, I have no say in the matter.   
Second I  added one can of beef vegetable soup to provide more flavor  and veggies.
Last I added fresh graded parmegan cheese on top and let that melt  about 8 minutes before it was done.  I ended up doubling the quantity for a large family and we  polished it off tonight.   I didn't double on the soup  though as I was afraid it would get too watery.   So you might want to try 1/2 can for thicker consistancy.  

Out of the oven it was bubbling up the side and I feared it would be too soupy, but after cooling a bit the  gravy thickened and it was very ease to eat an entire serving with only a fork.

I added garlic salt, oregano, and flavour was good. Grated cheddar cheese on top. Used one can corn also.
 Bad thing,
It was very runny like soup. I only used one can cream mushroom soup. Now my family won't eat it. I have to eat it all by myself..
I had to drink my dinner......Lol

Great starter recipe to an otherwise bland dish - my daughter and husband loved it! I don't care for the gamey flavor of lamb and would make it 3/4 ground beef and 1/4 ground lamb.
I made it with mushrooms, peas, green beans, onion; I added some seasoned salt, garlic powder and black pepper. I made Potato Buds for the topping. Also layered a generous layer of shredded cheese between the bottom portion of beef mix and top layer. Sprinkled cheese on top before adding potato with dots of butter.

I tried this recipe tonight. The meat mixture was very good. The only thing I feel it needs is a bit more to the potatoes (a bit of cream, salt, and pepper should do the trick!) Overall, it was a great meal for a cold night!

Please bear with me, this is a cool fact/story and the family's recipe from at least 8 generations ago. Most people make this with beef (and even my kids will ask for seconds!), but they don't know the story of this delicious meal. It's called "Shepherd's Pie" because that's who traditionally would make it: poor shepherds with little money, few ingredients and no time. No one with any money would be caught dead eating it. And because the shepherds had so little money, they used what was on hand, namely the lamb in their flocks! (Often the ground pieces after butchering.)

Try this with ground lamb next time, and it'll be just that much better (and it's pretty perfect in this form). Also, if you have wild or regular garlic, throw that in (1 or 2 cloves minced) while browning the meat with the salt, pepper and onion powder. Don't be afraid of over-seasoning the meat: it has to carry a lot of flavor (lots of garlic and a fair bit of onion here!). When making the mashed potatoes, try using some sour cream or yogurt instead of milk and butter alone; you get a nice zing to keep it from being bland, especially with all that cheese. Also, it was always served with biscuits or cornbread, both with honey butter.

That's how my Scottish AND Irish great-great-grandmothers wrote it down for us (and it had already been staple foods in both houses, consisted an "old" recipe even then, so who knows how old this recipe is...I guess the good, basic ones last!) Somewhere they'll be smiling if s

Great recipe.  It was my first time making shepherd's pie and I did not have everything the recipe called for, so I improvised.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup because my family does not like mushroom soup.  I didn't have another can of soup, so I made used a tablespoon of beef flavored Better Than Boullion in a cup of water thickened with cornstarch.  I used corn and carrots because my family does not like peas.  Everything else I followed correctly, and it was delicious.

This has become a staple at our house.  We don't put in the mushrooms, we do frozen veggies as opposed to the can, along with 2 pounds of meat.  It turns out great every time!

Really good flavor but I found mine turned out a little soupy and did not set up as well as I had liked.  I will try to thicken the sauce next time and add heartier veggies to make a better pie.

I made this with leftover turkey and used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery soup. It was yummy, but I should've added a little more salt or some kind of seasoning. It was a little bland.

Had  to substitute for what I had in the house, and I knew I would. With six inches of fresh snow I was looking for some thing that wouldn't make me go to the store for one or two ingredients.You cn't call yourself a cook if you don't put your own touch to it! Now if we just had a recipe for Coca Cola!
This will become a standby!

This is a good recipe. It is simple to understand and follow and it is quite tasty. I followed this recipe but instead of using ground beef I used the left over pot roast I had in the fridge. But I plan on using this recipe the exact way it was written.

Very easy to make. I spiced it up a bit with sage, rosemary, minced onion, seasoned salt, etc. Also, I used a bit more potato (I used large potatoes). I would recommend even more. Another change I did was 3 cans of mushroom soup because I used 1 can each carrots, sweet corn and green beans. I didn't add the cream of celery soup or the mushrooms.

This was very good. I'm not sure what a "real" Shepherd's Pie is supposed to taste like, but I made a different recipe from this site last week, which was fairly good, and this is even better. What made it better that the other was the addition of a good amount of vegetables, and the base was pretty creamy with the two cans of soup. I made this pretty much exactly as written. I used Russet Burbank potatoes, which were barely medium-sized, and cooked them for 15 minutes. (I did think the mashed-potato topping was a little skimpy in my case, so I'd recommend larger potatoes.) The mushrooms I used were "pieces and stems" instead of "sliced", but it tasted the same to me anyway. I baked the whole thing for 30 minutes, at which point it was bubbly but not golden at all - but I was pretty hungry by then. This was also a good recipe in which to use ground white pepper instead of black, and best of all I got to try out my brand-new masher. (I usually read all prior reviews before posting my own, but there are 238 of them now, so I'll skip that step.)

If you have to add so many things the recipe doesn't call for to make it taste good, is it really a very good recipe to begin with?  I would never have made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  Requires some sauteed garlic and onion at the very least.

I never leave reviews, but for this I had to because I'm a terrible cook and this recipe turned out great!  I used instant potatoes instead of making my own (the 6-7 cup recipe was not quite enough) but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. My husband, bless his heart, is a great sport about my futile attempts to cook but does not give false compliments so when he said it was awesome, and then had a second big servings, I knew we had a winner.   Thanks for the great "so easy even I can do it right" recipe!

This was delicious!!  I only had a little leftover, which I reheated for dinner.  I added butter and milk to the mashed potatoes instead of using the water that I had boiled them in and instead of using a can of mixed veggies I used a small can of corn, a can of mushrooms, and a can of carrots.  I also put sharp cheddar cheese on top for the last 15 minutes of baking.

I'm going to give this recipe four stars, mainly because I altered it a little bit.  But it wasn't bad at all. I used ground Turkey meat instead of the beef it called for.  (Wish I hadn't - the texture just wasn't as good as ground beef)  I also used frozen veggies (peas and carrots) the way some of the other reviewers did instead of canned. And, then to save time, I used instant potatoes.  Surprisingly, no one could tell that the potatoes weren't homemade.  So I would definitely recommend the short cut if you're in a hurry.    One last thing to mention, this makes a LOT of food.  Make sure you have a big enough family to eat it, or plan on eating Shepherd's Pie for a few days after making it. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

By far the best recipe for shepherd's pie that I have found... I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and crushed up some garlic and add worchestershire sauce while the beef was browning. I also added cheddar cheese to the top halfway through the baking. A recipe worth keeping! Thank you for sharing it!

This is an easy, yummy recipe! I used the frozen veggies (peas, carrots, green beans) and added onion.  I also only used one can soup (cream of mushroom) and used 1/2 can of Murphy's Stout beer instead of the other can of soup.  It was YUMMY!  I also omitted the mushrooms.

We don't like mushrooms, so I made this recipe with a can of cream of celery (I only had 1) soup and a packet of country gravy.  I browned the beef with chopped onion and garlic.  I thought it was a good change from the classic tomato-based shepard's pie.

The recipe is great - giving 4 stars not for taste but for accuracy - the beef makes it Cottage Pie not Shepherd's.  Great nonetheless.

Just made this tonight to use up some potatoes I had.  Didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup or mushrooms so I used Cream of Chicken instead.  Also, used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and ground turkey.  Despite these changes I was hoping it would be delicious but it just wasn't.  As others have said, too bland.  I had to add a ton of salt with almost every bite to make it taste like anything.  Will try a different recipe next time.

For something so simple and easy, this was great! I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted frozen ground meatless. I also used deli mashed potatoes to speed it up and it came out fabulous! I had to stop my husband from getting thirds! And there's still enough left over to freeze for another night.

Good recipe. I always shied away from Shepherds pie because it sounded bland. I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.

I enjoyed this.  I added worstechire to the beef and soup.  I used two cans of mushroom soup instead of the celery.  I also added garlic powder (didn't have fresh), onion flakes and cheese and french fried onions on top of the potatoes.

This was yummy.  I too changed the recipes a little...I used a french onion soup packet and one beef bouillon cube with 1 cup water and let the beef simmer to add flavor.  I then added one can of corn - drained the liquid off.  I also admitted the cream of celery soup and added a few splashes of milk.

I love this recipe because it's simple and so easy to adjust with what you have in the pantry. I've cooked it as is and have varied from time to time depending on what I have on hand. I love to use fresh mushrooms and tend to use two of the prepacked and presliced ones found in the veggie section of the store. We've use ground turkey, ground lamb and ground beef. All varieties taste great. And I always add shredded cheese on top.

This is the first bad review I have given to a recipe - but I had to do it.  My daughter asked me why I made something so bad - and I had to agree.  Unfortunately I wasted all of these ingredients and my time on this recipe.  Please don't waste your time.

Absolutely delicious!  I used frozen mixed vegetables and left out the mushrooms, but those were the only changes I made.  This will definitely be on my menu regularly!

Loved, loved this recipe! Went over very well with hubby and kids, too.  This is so easy to make.  Although I'm sure it would be just as good as is, I did make a few changes.  I used shredded roast beef in place of the ground beef.  Frozen mixed veggies rather than canned.  And a 1/4 cup beef broth added to beef/veggie mixture.  The combination of the cream of mushroom soup and cream of celery soup is wonderful.  Nobody in my family likes cream of celery and I had absolutely no complaints.

This was really tasty.  The only change I made which I'm glad I did was I used fresh veggies instead of canned.  It added texture and I think it's more healthy.  I chopped carrots, celery, and onions into small chunks using a chopper and cooked them with the ground beef until they were al dente... still had some crunch not mushy.

This is the first shepherd's pie recipe I've tried, and it turned out really well! I used instant instead of mashed potatoes, and i used a can of chunky vegetable soup and a can of cheese soup instead of the mushroom & celery soup and mixed vegies. It turned out really well!!

Yummy! I used your recipe and also some of the suggestions in the comments. I used a can of veggie soup (not condensed) instead of the mixed veggies, I seasoned my ground beef with Worcestershire sauce, garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper. I also added some frozen corn to the mix. Lastly, I topped the potatoes (which were whipped in milk and butter) with a 5 cheese shredded mix. I got rave reviews and everyone went back for seconds, except me, I was stuffed :)

Awesome recipe!  My boyfriend and kids loved it.  This was super easy to make, I even had filling leftover so I froze it to have a quick batch ready for a quick meal.  Thanks a lot for your recipe.  My daughter wanted me to add that IT ROCKED!

OMG, very tasty!!! I did make a few changes b/c I didn't have all ingredients. Instead of canned mushrooms & vegetables I added 1 can of corn kernels, 1 can cut green beans, 2 carrots chopped (from the chicken soup that I just made) and I added one extra potato.. In the mashed potato mixture I also added 2 spoonfuls of butter to make it creamier. Next time I'll add some milk as well to make it even more creamy... it comes out nicely with a thin crust on top... yum.. delicious!! can't wait to see my hubby & toddler's reaction to it. I LOVE IT!! You will too!

Great!  I used extra potatoes and added a little sour cream (instead of the cooking liquid) when mashing them.  Frozen mixed vegetables and fresh mushrooms worked well.

This recipe was easy to make, but I thought the use of the condensed soups left this dish a little bland tasting.  I wish I would've added more herbs or spices of some kind.  I would probably make this again, but I'd definitely have to modify it so that the filling has more flavor.

This recipe was a real hit at my house.  It is easy to make and tastes delicious.  I used frozen vegetables instead of canned for some extra flavour. I also added some garlic to the mix and grated cheese on top of the potatoes.

Very easy and great recipe. Added onion and used fresh mushrooms when browning the ground beef. Also took a reviewer's advice and used chunky vegetable soup for more gravy and added more potatoes for the topping.

Just got done eating this easy to make dish.  I must say the wife didn't initially share my enthusiasm about making Shepherd's Pie.  She said she had tried it once or twice before and didn't like it.  Not only did she like it but she brought some of our leftovers to her Mom and Sister.  Their reviews are still pending.  I will make this again but I'm considering using less potatoes.  I used 10 (because of several reviews I read) but I'm thinking 6-7 might be more around the ball park for us.  Overall, great dish.  Definite rib sticker.  Thanks for an easy to follow recipe.

I loved your idea of adding the cream of celery and mushroom soups!!! It made such a difference!  I used ground turkey, sauteed some onions, didn't use mushrooms (didn't have any), and made garlic mashed potatoes topped with cheese just because I wanted to do something different...but it didn't need these alterations to make this a totally awesome Shepherd's Pie!!!  Thanks :) Everyone loved it.

Very good... I did not have potatoes so I used sour cream and chive flavored instant potatoes. Seasoned with what I like, garlic. Placed potatoes on the bottom then cheese the meat mixture, cheese and potatoes on top. My husband really like it.

This was great! I did (of course) change a few things. I used instant mashed potatoes as some suggested to save time. I put a layer of potatoes on the bottom as well, added more vegetables, brown the meat with some chopped onions, added a little bit more cream of celery (but not quite two cans) just to make it more creamy. My two year old nephew ate it thinking it was "mashed potatoes" and loved it. He does not eat vegetables at all and he gobbled this meal up. When my sister came to pick him up he said, "I love Aunt Katie's mashed potatoes! They were yummy!"

I doctored this recipe up a bit to match my preferences and based on what I had in the house. I used a recipe for traditional mashed potatoes to put on top, used frozen/thawed veggies, used a can of cream of mushroom plus a bit of sour cream and milk. I also substituted ground turkey for the beef.  It turned out wonderfully, but I'm sure the recipe as written is tasty, too. It's definitely a good base recipe to have fun changing up.

I really liked this recipe!  I'm a single mom of 2 and work full time, so I used some short cuts and made it quick and easy.  I used premade Bob Evans mashed potatoes and precooked them in the microwave.  Used 1/2 lb ground beef seasoned with Lawry's, salt, pepper and a few other spices. I only had one can of Golden Mushroom Soup, so I mixed and heated that with the burger, a can of mixed veggies, a can of mushrooms and a can of corn.  Topped with the mashed potatoes and sprinkled with a little paprika and dotted with a little butter.  Baked per the directions.  Turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

Recipes like this one taught me how to cook for my family. It's still a staple and my favorite. I always get excited shopping for the ingredients. Except I hate the potato chunks in the mixed veggies, so I get a frozen one without it. This time I got fresh mushrooms. It shouldn't be too much of an added effort.

This is really good but is bland. I wish I would have flavored the meat and added onions--I *did* add two tbsp. of Worchestire sauce; however it still lacked in flavor. The texture was delicious and I made the Traditional Mashed Potato Recipe found on allrecipes which really, really added to the comforty-yumminess that is Shepherd's pie--I think next time I will use either one or the other can of soup since mushrooms and celery are in itself a bland veggie, and add garlic to the meat and sautee more onions. The soup made it seem like Chicken Pot Pie--great idea. Spending the extra 10 min. for the potatoes was worth it.

I liked this recipe because of the simple ingredients.  I did make a few changes for personal preference.  One was to use premade refrigerated garlic and herb mashed potatoes.  This really speeds up the preparation part of the dish.  I also added a bag of frozen pearl onions prepared as per the bags instructions.  My family loves onions.  The other change was to add cheese during the last five minutes of baking.  This is a very good dish that I will make again.  I plan on trying it with frozen mixed vegetables in the future.

Well - on the "pro" side, this recipe made a ton of food and cleared out my pantry of that can of cream of celery soup that's been there for almost a year. On the con side, the two cans of soup did make it really soupy, and the canned veggies - kind of gross looking. However, the beef needed the celery flavor for balance. Next time, I'm going to try another recipe for this dish, maybe with fresh veggies instead of canned and with just one can of cream of something soup. However, if I were to make this again, then I would double the beef and the potatoes, keeping the two cans of soup, and make two casseroles. In conclusion: I'm just not sold on this one.

Thanks for the handy recipe.  It was a hit with the dinner guests. I modified it with instant mash and used instant beef stock instead of the cream of mushroom.  Frozen mixed vegetables did give it more colour as recommended by one of the reviews, and the cheese topping was another great idea too.  Thanks!

This is pretty good! We enjoyed it very much. I added garlic powder and my own combination of fresh vegetables, sauteed (carrot, celery, peas, onion). We will be making this again, certainly.

I thought this was really good, DH LOVE it.  Granted, I doctored it up quite a bit...I added onion, garlic power, onion powder, used frozen mixed veggies, also added a beef boullion cube, only used 1 can cream of mushroom (definitely think it would be too soupy with 2 cans), but added some celery seed to make up for the celery soup and used fake mashed potatoes to make it easy.  Thanks for the base recipe!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe and I will be making this again. Things I changed: I added in 1 beef bouillon cube and a dash of Italian seasoning to the beef mixture, left out the mushrooms, and used Butter & Herb Instant Mashed potatoes. Next time I will probably add in some chopped onions, and my husband suggested putting this in a pie crust.

Excellent recipe!  The potatoes I used were a little on the small side and so the coverage on the top was a little thin.  For some, 6 potatoes would be the way to go.

The recipe was easy but definitely lacking in taste and I doctored it up big time by adding some cayenne pepper, black pepper and italian seasoning to the meat.  It was only OK and looked disgusting the first time and even worse later so I will definitely not be making this again.  I gave three stars only for the ease of prep.  Otherwise, I would only rate two.

Nice and simple.  Some cheddar sprinkled on top when baking was a nice touch -- thanks for that suggestion.  Definitely comfort food without a lot of fuss.  Thanks for the recipe, Sue.

I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this one. I was in search of a new recipe I could make with hamburger meat, and was very excited when I found this one, it sounded great and had a lot of good reviews.  Not only was it time consuming but it did not look appealing at all and the taste was not much better.

Very good just the way it is, but also a good recipe to adapt to one's own tastes...My family doesn't like instant mashed potatoes, so I always make this using left over mashed potatoes from an earlier meal...it's easy to make a little more potatoes the first time around, then you will have the leftovers on hand for something like this.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

My family *LOVED* this recipe and I have made it several times since. I even made extra filling and froze it to use at a later date. Add extra spices according to your own tastes and add the veggies your family likes the most.

Nice easy recipe to follow.  Has good flavor but for some reason the mash potatoes on top always ends up runny, real or boxed doesnt seem to matter.  Good size plus left overs for this family of 4.

We grew up eating this casserole in my house, but we always had cheese on top of the potatoes, so that's the only change I made to this recipe. It was great! Thanks Sue :)

My family loved this.  I made it for them before I went to work tonight.  I wasn't sure if they would like it but it was something easy & quick to make.  My husband called me at work and said "THIS IS GREAT STUFF!  I can't get the boys to stop eating!!" They saved me a small bowl.  Tasted great..  THANKS!

I useda can of mushroom barley soup instead of cream of celery.  I also added some sliced fresh carrots, sauted onion, and a few spices.  I added some paprika and bacon bits to the potatoes, and some chives and velveeta.  It was yummy!  Everybody liked it very much.  I also used some Mrs. Dash seasoning in the meat mixture.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Versatile to play around with, yet quick and delicious.

So simple to make.  I sauteed 1/2 a chopped onion and added that to the mixture and added spices of various kinds until I liked the taste.
Cooking and mashing the potatoes took the majority of the time for this recipe.  I'll try instant in the future.  
This isn't a gourmet recipe but it's tasty nonetheless!

Good Recipe. A little too much mashed potatoes and not enough meat mixture. I like more seasoned mixture so I'd probably add some onion and garlic.  It's a little lacking in the taste.

This has become my husband's favorite. I didn't have cream of celery soup so I substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup. Blows the calorie count but isn't that what comfort food is all about?

My whole family loved it!  My husband asked me why haven't I made this before!  I sustituted the real potatoes for flaked potatoes that I needed to use up.  It worked wonderfully!

This is a very good recipe that tastes even better the next day. I wasn't sure whether to drain the mixed vegetables or not--would like clarification. I used the roasted garlic instant mashed potatoes as suggessted by another reviewer. I think that I would prefer the homemade kind as in the original recipe. I will make this again. Thanks.

Not a single bite of this went to waste!  My husband and I loved this so much, we packed the leftovers for lunch!

I was looking for a way to use up some ground beef and I'm glad I found this recipe!  I added some green onion for flavor and color and frozen green beans and corn.  Also, used garlic instant mashed potatos on top.  Will make this one again.

It was good but time consuming.
