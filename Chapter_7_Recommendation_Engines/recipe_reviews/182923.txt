The flavor of this turkey is INCREDIBLE. I just skimmed the pan drippings and thickened them, and it made the best gravy we've ever had. My husband has requested that this be the only way we make turkey in the future. To be fair, you probably need to allow a bit more than two hours to cook the turkey. My 13-lb turkey took about 2.5 hours, and that was after I re-sealed the foil and cranked the oven up to 500 for the last 20 minutes of cooking. It worked, but not in the time specified.

I should have known better then to think this turkey could have cooked in 2 hrs!  After 4 1/2 hrs and it still wasn't done I took it out and cut off the breast meat so we could eat!  I'm so glad I wasn't cooking for my parents or In-laws!

The best turkey I have ever cooked!!!!  My turkey was 12 lbs (as the recipe calls for) and it cooked perfectly with 2 hours oven time! Couldn't be easier! I will never make it any other way!!!! Even if I do have to allow extra time for a bigger bird...

Wonderful. I had a 20 pound turkey so I doubled the recipe. Amazingly it cooked in under 4 hours. The turkey is so moist and has amazing flavor. I did make a few changes because of what we had on hand. We did not have fresh parsley so I used fresh thyme, and the leafy part of celery. Other then that all was the same. Love this recipe and will likely make my turkeys like this again. LOVE IT.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I had a 13-lb turkey and it was done in about 2 hours.  The white meat was extremely moist and the drippings made a very flavorful gravy.  After the first hour, when I removed the foil, I did have to add more broth to the pan.  And I am allergic to tomatoes so I skipped adding the tomato juice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and was very, very pleased.   I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was the most flavorful and moist turkey I have ever made.  Served for Christmas eve the family all raved about it.  I did leave out the tomato juice as I don't like it and I added about 15 more minutes to both processes so and extra 30 minutes total for a larger turkey.  I do cook my turkeys breast down and when I turned it over my husband said what is the matter with this turkey is it cooked? I told him the brown part was on the back so if you want a brown breast cook it breast up.  I will always use this recipe to cook a turkey just wonderful.

Yes, like other reviews have said, it really needed approximately 2.5-3 hours to cook, but this turkey was the most tender, delicate of my cooking life.  Caveats include: the gravy made from juices in the turkey was FAR too sweet, what with all the fruit juices, so plan ahead and have turkey stock on hand. Loved this recipe.  Browned up like something on the cover of a magazine. Lovely.

I cooked a 12 lb. bird exactly as this recipe states and it was the best bird I've ever cooked and at 60 I've cooked a few! Sealing the foil so it doesn't leak but is not touching the bird is the secret. I also cooked mine at 425 the whole time! Fell off the bone!  Only way I will cook a bird now!

Was skeptical but my needed to cook a 10 lb bird quickly since I also wanted to brine.  DId a quick 4 hour brine (double the kosher salt) and cooked for two hours in the oven, did not reduce temp,  It was great.  As good as my more long and involved Martha brine/cook recipe.  Will definitely do again.

I have gotten wonderful compliments on this turkey recipe.  My family loves how moist and flavorful it is.  Unfortunately, I must be doing something wrong, because both times I have made it, I have to bake for about 4 hours.  Other than that, though, awesome!    I would like to have a recipe for gravy made from the juices though.  Does anyone have any recipes that they have used?

Unless you enjoy salmonella and the like it is best not to let the turkey sit out of the fridge for an hour.  A lot of chefs suggest letting the meat stand at room temperature  before cooking but it is a dangerous idea and serves no real purpose.   Meat takes a dangerously long time to warm up and food lab studies show it it not necessary.  A little extra cooking time is faster and safer.

I have been making two hour turkey for many years.  It  always comes out good and not dry.  I decided to make this version and I am quite pleased.  First of all the way I have been making it required you to flip the turkey half way through cooking.  This version doesn't require you to do that which is awesome.  Believe me flipping a hot turkey isn't fun.  This turkey came out juicy, and very flavorful,  When I made the gravy from the dripping it was delicious!! This will be my new go to recipe every time I make a turkey  Two Thumbs up!!

I give this recipe five stars. I have never ever cooked a turkey and this was the easiest turkey recipe ever. The turkey was so moist and I hate dry turkey so I was in love with the flavor!!! I did NOT add the cognac as I felt it wouldn't be needed. I had about 25 people try my turkey and every single person was so impressed and asked how I made it so juicy! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! I can't wait to make it this year!!!
