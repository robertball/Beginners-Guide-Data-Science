Yum!  I was looking for a way to use up some great northern beans and this was terrific.  Even the kids loved it!   I served it with warm pita bread.  I used dried parsley, but next time I will use fresh.  I can't wait to try it with the roasted red pepper variation.

This was my first attempt at making hummus.  The recipe was easy.  I may try adding more spice next time.  Overall, very good for something so very simple.
