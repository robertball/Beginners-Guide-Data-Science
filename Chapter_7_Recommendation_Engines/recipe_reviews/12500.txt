Cipatte is a staple in our family and a largw number of families in northern new brunswick.  We grew up with it but with game meats (moose, deer, rabbit,). Great alternative to turkey at christmas.  Remember to keep adding water otherwise it drys

I used this recipe and used the "Tourtiere spices " recipe on this site for the seasoning. I made a pie crust and cooked in an iron pot. Just like my friend Nelly from Quebec. In QUebec they make this for Christmas eve, but it is a wonderful hearty dish for the winter. The long cooking time makes it perfect.

My mom makes this pie for every holiday and they call it "Ci Pie" (See pie).  Tastes great and not to spicy for kids.

I did not make this, but I am québécois, and this recipe derives from the lac st jean region of Quebec. Most recipes use about 5 to 6 lbs potatoes, we don't use ham. Maybe salt pork, but not ham. The dough is not a regular pastry dough. It has baking powder on it.  Cipate is seasoned with cinnamon and cloves
