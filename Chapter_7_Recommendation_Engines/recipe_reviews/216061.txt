This is an excellent hot dip! I followed the recipe to the letter, and everyone could not stop eating this.  The package of dry Italian dressing is what really makes this stand out, and really packs a flavor punch. I had this on my appetizer table with assorted crackers and sliced toasted baguettes. It seems the winner was the sliced baguettes. I'll use this recipe again for sure. I could see adding a bit more cheddar wouldn't hurt this at all. It's quite addicting, different and I highly recommend this. We all enjoyed this very much. Thanks :)

This is a good dip - and a change from the usual suspects at the appetizer table.  The first time I made it, the broccoli was too "chunky" and still a little firm, which I didn't personally care for.  The next time I made it, I cooked fresh broccoli florets and then finely diced them before mixing in.  I actually preferred it this way, but it might just be my own personal tastes.  It had good flavor, but I did go ahead and add some black pepper.  I served this with slices of french bread.

Very tasty, I changed the recipe slightly. I used more cheese and I also used ranch packet instead of the italian dressing mix. It is also good with taco season.

Perfect!!!!  I didn't have frozen broccoli, so used fresh broccoli and steamed it, then finely chopped it. Worked perfect. Next time I am using fat free or reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream to reduce the fat content...I am sure it will work fine. This was simply awesome....the whole bowl was gone before any other dishes.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some fresh broccoli.  I used the florets from 3 stalks.  Microwaved broccoli for 3ish minutes.  Chopped and used ranch powder (4T) instead of italian dressing b/c that is what I had on hand.  Definitely think the broccoli should be a little pre-cooked and chopped well.  Delish!  I made a day ahead to taste and make sure it was good.  Then, put in mini crock-pot the next day and served at small get-together.  Served w/ pita chips and tortilla chips.  I think it would be good w/ any # of dippers.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This dip is very good.  I used about 3 fresh broccoli florets (steamed and finely chopped) instead of frozen broccoli.  My family loves it.  I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream and you can't tell whatsoever.  Yum!

Very easy and yummy. I accidentally sprinkled the remaining cheese on top before baking so I baked it for 20 minutes total. Turned out great!

The only things I did differently were buying the generic brands of the ingredient and using broccoli florets (instead of chopping them up) and it was a HUGE hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it and it was good hot or cold!

Everyone really enjoyed this at our Thanksgiving gathering; most everyone at the dinner complained that it was so good, they ate too much and weren't able to eat as much at dinner!!

Yum! I served this dip with Pita chips and it was a huge hit. Also, to keep it hot, i heated and served the dip in a small crock pot.

Made this for the SuperBowl party...not too much got eaten, however, there were only guys here and only one of them liked broccoli.  I thought it ROCKED.  Took it to work the next day and it was devoured.  Made toasted French Bread, also from this site.  Good thing I had saved about 1/2 C. for myself that I left at home.  I reheated it and put it over a baked potato for supper.  YUM!  I think next time I will add about 1/4 C. of cream because I felt it was a bit thick.  Overall this is a keeper.

I used the Good Seasonings Zesty Italian and low fat versions of the ingredients as well.  THe broccoli was crisp because I left it frozen in the fridge for 24hrs, it was perfect.  Out of 9 appetizers, mine was the only one completely gone

Made this for the Super Bowl and it was the only food gone before kick off. Definitely making at LEAST 2 next time! I added more broccoli than the recipe calls for and I definitely think it was a good choice, helped a lot with the texture. Next time I'll probably add a bit more cheddar, because, well, I just love cheese!

This was well liked by everyone.  Very easy to make as well.  Would make again.  I served it with crackers, celery sticks, and baby carrots.  Would also be good with tortilla chips.

This dip was a hit at our thanksgiving party! Perfect as is.
