Hubby thought these were just okay, but didn't like the almonds.  I thought these were big time chocolate overkill--a little goes a very long way. I would really encourage using only half the amount of chocolate chips called for. Easy enough to put together, although the dough isn't as crumbly as the recipe suggests.  Definitely a pretty bar, and definitely not a favorite of mine.
