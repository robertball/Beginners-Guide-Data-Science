Why are people rating this, and rating it one star when they haven't made it?  "That's not how this works, that's not how any of this works." Unless you have made a recipe, move on.  You have no business to rate it! I normally look at 4 star and up so I am glad I took the time to read the reviews on this one to see the ones to ignore.  You are taking a recipe's rating down when you  never even tried it.  I wish AllRecipes would just remove your review as it BS.  I made it and made some substitutions and additions and it was great.  Everyone loved it.  I used shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta, added green onions and used fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

I missed the can of tomatoes and chili’s and used cheddar. Dusted with flour instead of velveeta but our picky kids loved this. Will eat it again (leftovers) for dinner and will make it again.

Very tasty.  I did not have any chile peppers (did not want to go to the store just for that, don a mask and gloves and all that...) so I chopped up some pepperoncinis instead.  And I have minced garlic in a jar - and am not sure what the measurement is for a clove of garlic, so I put 3 heaping teaspoons of the minced garlic in it...and it was wonderful.  I also used a turkey breast we got from Costco, pre-cooked and ready to go.  I had put it in my crock pot with some chicken gravy for about 6 hours just to further tenderize it, and it was to die for.

I like just following the recipes as stated.  If you have similar or so many different things to add - submit your own recipe.  I really enjoy just following - 
This was very good.

Because of the stay at home limitations,  I had to make a lot of changes.  Used a combination of rigatoni and elbows.  Used 3-10 oz. Cans of diced tomatoes with chilies,  used shredded cheddar and shredded mozzarella.  I had the green pepper and onion. The fresh mushrooms were a must! It made a huge amount and there's only one of me,  so had to find room in the freezer for several more meals worth. Would make a great family meal.

I made this using real sharp cheddar. My husband doesn't do tomatoes so made a variation and added lightly cooked broccoli before baking. We loved it! Will definitely make again.

I made this a few days ago for dinner, and leftovers.  Didn't have mushrooms, so left those out.  I crushed up some ritz crackers and mixed with shredded cheese and added that to top.  Turned out pretty darn good.  Will go into my football tailgate recipe file, as well as any potluck I need to attend.  Made enough for a crowd.

It was really good and it makes a lot. Definite leftovers! Just before taking it out of the oven I threw some cheddar cheese on top and Durkees fried onions. Delicious! I also think this would be fun to make with grilled sausage from the barbecue instead of chicken.

My kids who are usually very picky thought it was good. I thought it was tasty but I thought it should be a little thicker. It tasted very good though. It took a while to put together. I would make it again definitely.

The mushrooms seemed like an odd addition to this recipe but they really added flavor. This casserole had just the right amount of spice. Cheesy goodness delight.

This was great and easy to make. I too had to adapt ingredients slightly due to the current quarantine. I didn’t have any mushrooms, so I compensated by adding more onions, chilies and peppers.   I used meat-free, chicken substitute and it was delicious!  I halved the recipe and it still made quite a lot. Will definitely make again!

Even with the Rotel, this casserole was just okay for us. I made from scratch chedder cheese sauce, because I don't care for Velveeta. However, even by me making a cheese sauce my family didn't want seconds.

Followed the recipe except. Did not have the  mushrooms. Very good. It was way too much. Froze over 1/2 of it. There are only 2 of us but splitting the recipe leaves you with 1/2 can of 2 ingredients and I didn't want to store thhem.

This was delicious! No penne at the grocery store so I used rotini. I also added some buttered bread crumbs on top. The whole family had seconds. I’ll make this again!

It might have been a higher review, as I was cutting the recipe in half for two people. Left. The can of tomatoes out and mild chilies out. I will make again.

I made half the recipe but even for just the two of us the whole would have been nice to have some to freeze.  It is truly a pantry casserole nice to have.  You could use canned chicken, I had a roasted chicken.   I had red and green bell peppers, so used both.  Just the right amount of noodles and velveta.  Hate to waste food right now so this is perfect. Quite yummy.

This one’s a keeper for me! Would be a great dish at potlucks! I didn’t use the whole box of ziti, only about 3/4. And sautéed the chicken chunks with the vegetable seasoning as another person said he did. I melted the Velveeta in the microwave first too, but not sure that was necessary. I added some Mexican blend cheese, too, and also on top before I put it in the oven. I used mild Rotel as my husband has a sensitive, Yankee palate. He still said it was hot. But I thought it was perfect. Reminded me of chicken enchiladas. Thanks for sharing it.

It’s pretty solid. Cool the chicken for like 5-10 min with the onion and peppers.  Tons of leftovers.

Family really enjoyed the dish even my daughter who can be fairly picky. Very easy to make. I didn't stray from the receipe except used fire roasted dice tomatoes and fire roasted Rotel only because that's all that was available! Definitely will make again.

Fantastic as-is. I'm not the "best" cook. The thing was, preparation and reading the recipe BEFORE starting! There is a LOT of stuff being cooked. I have a large 9x13" casserole dish, and I had to leave some of the elbow macaroni behind! And I had to up-size pots on the fly! Wow! 

So plan to use bigger sized pans, and you'll be impressed with the flavor. There's just 2 of us, and this lasted us all week! Yummy!!!

I wouldn't consider this "out of the pantry," but never the less, it was pretty darned good. I made it as written.  Next time, I might consider fresh ricotta and a homemade cheese sauce instead of Velveeta. Maybe, I don't know. Sometimes I'm so wishy-washy.

This was a very bland recipe. Maybe cumin or other spice would help. I didn't have any processed cheese , so I used cheddar cheese with a little milk. That may have been the mistake.
