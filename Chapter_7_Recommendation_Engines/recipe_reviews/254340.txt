I only changed things up a little. I used a good organic marinara sauce. I added sauteed onion. A little more red pepper than called for and I sauteed the zoodles separately before adding them to the sauce. I added Parmesan cheese at the end when plated. The result, was amazing. We were not convinced as we were cooking it that it was going to be any good. Boy were we wrong!! This one is going on the rotation for sure.

It was good and simple but I think that it needed more layers of flavor. Next time I will add sauteed onion and more garlic.  Keep peppers in strips instead of chopped. Sprinkle cheese when plated.  I also found it to be a little soupy so I will sautee the Zoodles separately.

I received a spiraletti for Christmas and have since been looking for recipes where I could use this awesome tool. My fiancé and I are on a low carb diet and this recipe was right up our alley. great flavor... 
A few things we did differently...no spinach...as we didn't have it on hand, but would love to try it with spinach next time. Also, after reading another review we decided not to add the noodles to the sauce. Instead, we served the noodles with each bowl so they remained crunchy.

I used Harris Teeter brand marinara for my sauce base. This was a great meal but I wonder what can be done to keep the zoodles firm? Next time I think I'll soak up the extra moisture with a paper towel and keep them separate from the sauce.

As others have said, saute garlic and onion first, then brown the meat.  I used Rao's marinara, which was excellent.  While cooking, it didn't look like anything special.   But holy smokes it was DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone loved it. We'll make this regularly from now on.  Super easy skillet meal.

So delicious. My husband isn’t a zoo sled kind of person or anything close to pasta. He absolutely loved this recipe. I added a bit more spice and it was just perfect.

A good marinara sauce is key to this recipe and I used my favorite, "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" found here on Allrecipes.  I will put this in my TNT folder and make it again. Thank you Megan for sharing this.

Made this with a chopped onion, little more garlic, sliced mushrooms, and our homemade marinara from our garden tomatoes we canned.
Cooked the zucchini noodles in the microwave on paper towels for about 5 minutes, then added them.
Dear husband and I absolutely loved it! Had it with freshly-grated Romano on top, with some homemade Zero-carb garlic-mozzarella toast.
Heaven on a cold, Illinois January day. Definitely a keeper!!

Soo Good!! Soo Easy!! Only change I made was to caramelize an onion as I was prepping all the veggies.  I made this in my electric frying pan, so even clean up was a breeze. My husband loved it even though he had never heard of zoodles before! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe....

This is a fantastic recipe!  Unfortunately, my husband does not do well with bell pepper so I skipped it.  Did not turn out soupy at all.  I will add sauted onion next time as I add onion to most recipes.  Thank you for sharing.

I am very pleased with this dish.  I made it tonight with very few changes.  I had to take advantage of the fact that my husband is out of town to try this, because I had to make sure that it is delicious before I try "zoodles" on him.

I omitted the olive oil since the recipe said to sauté the turkey and garlic together.  I added a little red wine because I love adding wine to marinara.  The only other change I made was using asparagus because I didn't have spinach and I LOVE asparagus.  Oh, and I added some shredded parmesan when served.  Yum!

I've made this recipe several times since I initially saw it last month. It's the perfect dish for cold, rainy, or snowy days when you're home and preferably snugly in a comfy bed or couch.

Just made this tonight and it was a huge hit! I didn't have ground turkey on hand but I did have frozen, uncooked shrimp that I thawed and tossed them with a little lemon pepper. I sautéed an onion with the garlic, green pepper, red pepper flakes, and added a can of diced tomatoes along with some tomato sauce. Let it reduce down so it wasn't watery. Put the zucchini noodles in the sauce the same time as the shrimp. 3 minutes later it was done and delicious! I know there were several changes, but I think this recipe is such a good one that you can  use it in many variations. Love that you can have a lot of 'pasta' and you don't feel full or stuffed after the meal. Served with side salad & small slice of garlic toast.

The zoodles should be cut into manageable pieces. Simmer the sauce to evaporate the liquid from the spinach and zucchini .

Really big flavor from a quick and easy recipe.  This has been added to our permanent rotation.  I topped with freshly grated Parmesan and added more red pepper flake and it was delicious.  Great recipe - thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe. I used Classico marinara to keep it as gluten-free as possible and it really made the flavors pop. Love that this dish is as tasty as it is healthy!

This Was GOOD!  Will make it again...and again.
I use a mortar and pestle and grind up the pepper flakes.  Also, we like onion so I through a cup of chopped onion in.  What it needed?  Black Olives.  Forgot to throw them in...Next Time!

I made this without spinach because I didn't have any, but it was great.
