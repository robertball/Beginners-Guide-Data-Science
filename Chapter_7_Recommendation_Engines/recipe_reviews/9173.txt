This recipe makes a good meat pie... but it is not a traditional Tourtière recipe.  A true Tourtière requires no herb, no garlic, no chicken broth (water is used instead), but rather the following spices: cinnamon, cloves, all spice, salt and pepper.  So, as a French Canadian, I would not mind serving this meat pie say on a cold January night, but certainly not on Christmas Eve (Réveillon), as it would break the tradition.

I liked this recipe and the spice blend.  I use a variety of meat pie(Tourtiere) recipes and have been making them for a long time. Sorry Tyggrette, there are as many "traditional" recipes for tourtiere as there are ways to prepare meatloaf!  Each Region of Canada prepares it differently.  Besides, spices don't make a tradition, people do.  This is a nice recipe and a recommended try.  Thanks, Claudette

This pie is DELICIOUS! Even my five-year-old husband who refuses to eat like an adult LOVED this dish! It was easy to make and tastes great. I was nervous about using a spice like mace on meat, but the spices were perfect. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

This was easy & a big hit with the kids, but the adults found it typical of traditional European country-fare: filling, but a bit boring. It was tasty, but a little dry. I'll be serving it on cold winter days........maybe with a gavy or sauce on the side!

Good recipe.  I agree with the use of pork only and the spicing in this version.  Every French Canadian, myself included knows the BEST recipe for tourtiere and it's their's!  Part of my family Christmas is a friendly discussion around the dining table as to whose tourtiere is the most 'authentic'.  For me, tourtiere and home-made chili sauce IS Christmas.  I've never met a tourtiere I wouldn't sample!

In the process ... having to sub spices: allspice for mace, marjoram for savory, (used sage). Olive oil for the bacon fat. I added a stalk of celery & more garlic, probably 2 cloves. I'm combining w another recipe here that adds unseasoned, mashed potatoes with the meat mixture, less than 2c mashed.  'Not so sure I'd like "meat pie" - & it'll be more filling with a little potato action. My ground pork was only 1#.  I "repinched" the spices - meaning allspice, sage & marjoram.  It filled a deepdish pie plate.  'Kinda reminds me of Shepard's pie mixed together.  'Thinking the "good"-ness of the pie depends on the chicken broth since it's the predominant flavor added. Mine's homemade so it'll probably be good. 'Baking at 375 like I would a regular pie since it isn't all that wet - to need a higher temp...Done in 45. Still reminds me of Shepard's pie.  'Not a bad thing, just meaty - & with potato addition - a bit potatoey.  :?  :D  'Think this is a "man food".  I'd like more spices & ingredients, but that'd be an entirely different recipe then.

My husband liked this, but it seemed a little to rustic to me.  Maybe with some cheese or sausage to give the flavor some depth.

I really liked the spice blend in this pie and recommend it.  It's a great do ahead meal, and this pie freezes well. Thanks, C

This recipe provides excellent flavor in the filling.  As I am not familiar with a tourtiere, I cannot judge about it's authenticity.  I would like a binder of some kind, as the meat wanted to spill out of the crust when serving.  Thanks for posting!

The filling has an excellent flavor, but I would like a binder of some sort.  The meat was very loose inside the crust, and did not stick together in the slice.

The flavor of the meat was good, but I felt like there should be some sort of sauce to hold it together. It just fell apart on the plate.

Very flavorful. I was afraid it might be bland, but loved it as is.
