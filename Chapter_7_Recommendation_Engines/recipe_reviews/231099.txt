This was my first time trying Chayote and it was pretty good. I did not know if it needed to be peeled or not so I peeled it.I cooked it exactly as recipes stated and sprinkled extra red pepper on top before serving.

I really enjoyed this. I've never had this kind of squash before, but feel the it is a very versatile veggie. I added mushrooms, onion and bell peppers. The only thing I made sure of was to stir fry for 3 Or 4 minutes, then reduced the heat to medium/low and steam for an additional 12 minutes since this squash takes longer to soften. Added soy sauce too. Very good!

This was my first time trying chayote squash and  I enjoyed this recipe.  I used less red pepper flakes, sesame oil instead of butter and chopped sweet onion instead of garlic.  Also added a handful of toasted cashews before serving.  The sesame oil gave it a greater Asian flare!

First time I've eaten Chayote and I really liked the recipe.

The photo seems to have nothing to do with the recipe though.

New type of squash for me.  I peeled because another reviewer did the same.  I added more sugar, and I also threw in a little bit of sesame seed oil.  Overall, very easy and tasty.  I'll make it again.

I just made this. I gotta say, absolutely wonderful :) I would also say use a bit less red pepper if you don't like spicy.

This was so goodâ€¦ had like an asian zing to it.  Mine didn't soften all that much but I didn't mind the crunchiness.

I added button mushrooms sliced thin, with Indian style home-made milagai-masala-podi (aka ground spices and chilli rub).
It came out with good consistency as recipe advised.
I go easy on Olive oil in addition to butter :-D

I made this but added calabaza squash, mushrooms, onions, bell pepper s and vegetable broth and cooked until the chayote squash was tender. Loved it!
