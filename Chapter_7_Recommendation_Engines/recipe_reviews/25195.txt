I did this recipe, but I'll go 1 less step. I did not sautee the onions or add the butter. No need. Ever since I was a kid, my mom never used a recipe but made peppers without precooking everything. This was the only recipe I could find that did not ask you to do that. She thought I was nuts to precook all my ingredients. I used this recipe for the amounts. I used uncle Bens converted rice and added one egg to the meat mixture. I also added italian seasoning along with the salt (must be kosher or sea salt huge difference!)and pepper. I used 85% lean ground beef. I had enourmous peppers, (i used 4) so I halved them and layed them in a deep baking dish. Instead of tomato sauce I used 2 jars of marinara and 1 jar of water. I poured them over the stuffed peppers and loosly covered the baking pan. I baked it at 300 for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. They came out perfect! My baking dish was stoneware, so I do not know if that makes a difference, but it was great! The peppers were not way overcooked at all. Try it this way. It is soooo easy! Thanks!

FINALLY, Someone who knows how to make Stuffed Peppers! That is right. You do NOT cook the meat mixture before adding it to the peppers to bake. It WILL bake fully in the oven.  If you cook the meat before you will lose all the needed flavor! You do cook the rice, then chopped onion, Italian Seasoning, a little garlic and pepper. Mix this all together with the meat add to peppers. I would have given this 5* but you do not have Tomato Soup. If you use this instead of the Juice,it has much more flavor.

As originally submitted, the result is very soft, and a bit bland, with a steamed instead of browned texture.  But my husband mopped up every bit off his plate with bread and we thought it was an ideal winter comfort food. We even got our 9 year old to eat it when we omitted the onions. 

It was very fast and easy to put together.  I loved that we could skip precooking of the rice and browning of the beef but did not like having to cook the onions.  To save time, I melted the butter in the microwave, stirred in the chopped onion, and nuked it until translucent.  If you use converted rice, you can put it all together and pack it into a crockpot on low for 7-10 hours.  Use only half the liquid and pour it over the tops of the peppers.  Top with your favorite cheese just before serving.  I tried it with pasta sauce and tomato soup instead of juice with good results.  I have also substitued any combination of bits of garlic, corn kernels, celery, carrots or cooked beans for all or part the onion when onion haters came to dinner.

This was pretty good! I used V8 instead of plain tomato juice and red bell peppers instead of green. I also added some "Mrs Dash" Itailian seasoning and crushed red pepper to give it some zing. Give this one a try.

I thought this was outstanding - best stuffed pepper recipe I've come across yet.  I made mine with red, green, and yellow bell peppers and added a little brown sugar to the tomato juice while it was simmering.  Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing it!

We really liked this recipe.  I added some chopped celery and a grated carrot to the onion, along with some minced garlic.  I also used V8 juice and added some seasonings to that.  It was GREAT!  Will make again soon.

This was GREAT!  I am eating it as I type. I cut the recipe in half, and did it with 2 red, 2 green.  I altered the recipe due to all the reviews about it being bland.  It does say salt and pepper to taste. I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic to the onion and butter mixture. I even added 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley to the meat mix and salt and pepper.  I also used a large can of tomato sauce, and added about 1 1/2 large cans of water.  (I used the can of sauce to measure) I cooked on medium for about 2 hours.  (a more current review)-when I posted the previous info I did not write if I used instant rice or not.  Recently I used this recipe again but with reg. rice and like previous posters, the rice on top was crunchy while the bottom was mush, and the pepper was so soft it fell apart by the time it was done cooking.  USE INSTANT that's what I must have used the first time and had wonderful success.  I usually use instant for everything but I was out this time.  INSTANT RICE IS KEY!

This recipe turned out perfectly!  I added some garlic, tabasco, and extra spices (oregano, and basil).  It was excellent.  A meal in a pot!  I will definitely make it again. :)

Very disappointing.  I read the reviews and tried to alter it but it still didn't help.  The taste was bland even after adding garlic and italian seasonings.  And, the instructions could be better.  It took me awhile to figure that this is done on the stovetop and it doesn't specify whether to use "minute rice" or regular rice.  I used jasmine rice figuring that cooking for 3 hours would cook it - wrong.  After 2 hours the rice on the top was still crunchy so I had to tip them over to try to get them in the sauce enough to cook the rice, even though I was basting them every 15-20 minutes. And, I didn't know if I should cook them covered or not.  I left the lid on thinking that would help the rice, nope.  Oddly, the rice that was deep in the pepper got horribly mushy.

I read all of the comments on this recipe and was a bit worried about the outcome!  Changing the recipe as described below, I have to say - this was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten!  I'm serious.  If anything, I over-seasoned the sauce and will be a bit more careful next time. And there will definitely be a next time!  The dish was so good, I had a dream about it, and woke up wanting it for breakfast!

I scaled it down to two servings.  I used 2 red bell peppers.  On that scale, I added one small clove of garlic, minced, and 1/2 shallot, chopped to the meat mixture.  Also added cumin, oregano, various other spices, liberal salt and pepper and chopped parsley.  I used minute rice.  For the sauce, I used part tomato juice, part tomato sauce and 1/4 cup strong beef broth.  I added red bell pepper and celery to the sauce.

I didn't cover the peppers with the sauce, (they kept turning over when I did) but did spoon it over them throughout cooking.  I partially covered the pan, and simmered for 2 hours.

Next time, to add more fiber, I'm thinking of adding some kind of beans to the filling.

Absolutely scrumptious.

My husband and I both enjoyed this for dinner with mashed potatoes on the side.  I was worried it wouldn't taste like much, so I added some cayenne and southwest seasoning.  We also put some parmesan cheese on top of the peppers at the table.

This is good, 
but I added some crushed garlic to the onion, some majoram to the meat, and some sugar to the sauce
Result: Just like my Czech grandmother used to make :-)

YES!  This is how I always had stuffed peppers growing up as a child!  I used minute rice and they didn't turn out mushy.  I only used 4 peppers stuffed and made the rest of the meat mixture into balls and cooked them in the juice.  Made a nice gravy we poured over mashed potatoes.  Thank you!

I really like stuffed peppers an thought the rice to mean ratio was good.  I did not use as much butter as the recipe calls for to cook the onions and I added a little thyme and basil to the beef mixture when it was cooking. I make my own marinara sauce and put that on top of the peppers, then I add the tomato juice to half way up the pepper not until the peppers are covered as mentioned in this recipe.  Anyway they were excellent

I live in Hungary and this recipe is pretty close to what you will find here.  I used standard hungarian yellow/green peppers and if you lay the pepper down longways into the pan, the rice should cook evenly.  I didn't pre-cook the rice and they came out perfectly (about 2.5 hours). Also, keeping with Hungarian taste, I used ground pork.  Would also be great with slightly hot peppers.

This was pretty good!  I only made a few changes:  I used soy burger crumbles, I added about 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning, I added 1/2 tsp of basil and I didn't add any salt (I think it was pretty salty on its own).  There is a LOT of sauce left over, perhaps it can be used to make a soup or something.  I cooked mine for 2 1/2 hours (the first 2 hours with the lid on, the last 30 mins with it partially off).  I didn't have any problems with the rice not being done or being too done.  I basted the peppers about every 30 minutes.  This was great and I would definitely make it again, maybe increase the spices the next time.  They were even better the next day.  I think I would use red peppers the next time because the green were a little bitter.  Update:  I made it again as written and it came out really good but I might add some red pepper flakes the next time for a little kick.  I cooked it for 2 hours with lid on and 30 mins with lid partially off.

Great basic recipe. I always have to make recipes my own so I added to the meat; a great no salt seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 cup of pureed tomatoes from a can. I used all red peppers, piled the meat high but leave room in pepper for meat to cook. I add the rest of the large can of pureed tomatoes over the peppers to cover, plus I add one large can of petite diced tomatoes and a bit of water; maybe 3/4 cup. Top peppers with mozzarella and melt just before serving. I serve each pepper on a bed of rice pilaf with the juice over the rice. So... so... good.

[UPDATE]  I follow this recipe exactly as written almost everytime using Uncle Ben's Converted Rice and have never had any issues with the rice being crunchy on top and mushy on the bottom.  The only thing I have done differently is twice I used a little V-8 with the tomato juice (I wanted to finish an opened bottle of V-8).  My suggestion for those who have had rice issues is to make sure your peppers are wedged into a single layer in your pot OR weigh them down with a plate or steemer basket so that there is at least 2" of sauce covering them.  When I "stir" them, I am usually just making sure they are still covered and sometimes move them around the pot like a carousel.  My extended family asks me to make these several times a year for our monthly Sunday dinners and they bring large empty yogurt containers to take any home that survive dinner.

All generations of my extended family have been eating stuffed peppers their entire lives and without exception, they believe these are the best they have ever had.  I have been asked for this recipe so many times that I have it saved on my computers at work and home so I can forward it upon request.

Everyone loved these stuffed peppers even made in the middle of summer.  I used one can of tomato juice and one can of tomatoes in olive oil and garlic. Added some water.  When making the onion mixture added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and lots of paprika.  Added salt & pepper to the onion mixture.  I also used 1 cup of uncle bens brown rice.  Added a chili pepper which did not make it hot at all.  Added a little bit of basil.  Used different coloured peppers to suit different tastes.  Baked in oven for over two hours.

My mother also made this when I was young I just needed the cook time. Thank You. By the way for even tastier peppers with just the right season mix add one pack of Lipton spanish rice per pound of beef instead of white rice. You get the rice and seasoning all in one. My mother taught a cooking class for 25 years. Lucky me. :)

I thought this was great.  I chose to use red, yellow and orange peppers instead of green peppers.  Also I added a bit of sugar to the sauce.  Will make again.

I always make my stuffed peppers like this but I use ground chuck, add a can of tommato soup, and seasonings (seasoning salt, pepper, galic)to hamburger mixture.  Then i poke holes all over the peppers with a fork and then stuff them.  Then simply place in large cooking pot cover peppers with tomato juice you can also add an 8 ounce can of V8 juice adds a nice flavor.

A fool-proof recipe.  You don't have to cook the ingredients before stuffing them in the peppers, and even when they float upside down, the stuffing stays inside.  After running out of V8, I used a combo of ketchup and water to fill the pot.  Pretty darn tasty and not too much work!

First, let me point out: this is not Italian food.  If you are tempted to add garlic, basil, oregano, parmesan cheese, hot pepper or spaghetti sauce, then you don't understand what this is and you may well be disappointed.  Find a meatball recipe instead. 

Also, if you are loathe to add salt when you are cooking, then you also will likely be disappointed. With salt as the main seasoning, you need to add a good amount.  I used salted butter and then added almost 1.5 teaspoons of salt and a scant half teaspoon of pepper. I made it exactly as described, except I added about half a cup of water to the meat mixture because I like a softer consistency. I used converted rice. It was fantastic.  Served it over mashed potatoes...great on a chilly day!

thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe.  It is so much like what my mother made for use regularly when I was a little girl.  It is a great meal on a cold evening.  I prepped it the night before and my husband put it on to cook when he got home from work.  We topped it with sour cream.  YUM
The only change I wil make in the futute it to replace the tomato juice with sauce to create a thicker sauce.

At last a recipe that is very close to how my Hungarian mother made stuffed peppers.  The only change was I added a can of campbell's condensed tomato soup (undiluted) to the tomato juice.  It sweetens it a little. I sauteed the onion with a tsp of crushed garlic and added a splash of worcestshire to the ground beef.  Served with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad.  I felt like I was ten years old again :-)

This recipe was very good.  A little on the greasy side for me, so next time I think I will leave out the butter and use turkey meat instead.

These are wonderful peppers. I didn't have tomato juice on hand so I used a 26 oz. jar of marinara sause with 2 jars of water. It was just as sausy at the end. The marinra gave it a little kick too! My father in law rated it right up there with his mother's (who happens to be Slovakian as well) peppers. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I will have to agree that it needs extra salt and other spices, but that is what makes it great! You can fix it to your own taste. I added a lot of italian spices to the tomato juice. I found that the yellow, orange and red peppers added an excellent flavor over the green. We also added shredded cheddar cheese and tabasco sauce to it after we cut it up on our plates. My nephew does not like onions, so I made him a couple without onions and marked them in the pot with toothpicks in the top. I highly recommend this recipe. It is fast and delicious!!

I agree with others who found this recipe to be bland- however, the ease of preparation and clean up means I'll make it again.  I added corn and garlic and thought I overseasoned by adding extra pepper even more garlic but my man put hot sauce on it nonetheless- next time I make it I will add more spices for sure!

This was easy and smelled good while cooking - however it was way too bland for my family's taste.  I used V-8 instead of tomato juice and tried to spice it up as others suggested, garlic, more onions (not sauteed) and fresh black pepper.  It was still not what I expected but would work great for families that weren't raised on cooking from Sicily - with lots of seasonings!

The beauty of this recipe is that it is easy!  I may add more spices/flavoring to the meat and rice stuffing next time.  All the tomato juice is left over at the end - this could be used to make a soup.

Unbelievable how good this is.  It sure makes a lot though.  Had to cut it in half and that was plenty for 2 adults, 1 child.  I still can't believe that the tomato juice turns into that delicious sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

Being from the Czech Republic and graduating from Cordon Bleu, I had  to find a middle ground between what I was taught and going back to my mother/grandmother's teaching. For this dish, I prepared the peppers by parcooking them in boiling salted water for about 5 minutes to soften them and cutting down on cooking time. I added tomato paste mixed with Mexican oregano to taste, which will wake a bland dish up quickly. Also I chose to use ground lamb and add a 1/4 cup of red semi sweet wine to my mixture while it is cooking and before placing in it in the peppers, it just adds a flair to the flavor. Then putting the tomato paste, oregano mix, on top of the peppers to cook, gives a blend of togetherness in this dish.

These were pretty good. However, I would change out the tomato juice for V-8 and add an additional 1/2 lb of hamburger to actually get 8 peppers.

I will use this recipe as my "go to" stuffed peppers.....LOVE how you use raw ingredients but next time I'll use a tad less rice. U also opted to use a watered down tomato sauce instead of the juice and added chopped celery.

This was great!  I made them with red, orange and yellow peppers (not as bitter as green) and they turned out fantastic! I did however have to add alot of salt, as they were lacking a little.  I also garnished with grated cheese when served to "kick it up a notch".

Very good!  Halved this and substituted tomato sauce with some water for the juice.  Also added some parsley and garlic salt.  Will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe Moeliz.

I tried baking it and one review gave directions on doing that.  The rice never cooked.

This is a Great recipe.  I also used cooked rice -- a large container of hot cooked rice from the Chinese restaurant helps at all stick together before you put it into the pepper.  I would've used an egg but I didn't need it. I used 2 cans of tomato soup.  It comes out perfect that way.

Soooo disappointing.  Very bland, and it was hard to understand why it got good ratings from others.  I realize most of them made changes and additions to the base recipe, but this is not worth making.  We discarded most of it, and will go back to my usual way of making stuffed peppers....was hoping for a really ramped-up variation, but this is not it.

Finally, a recipe that does not precooked everything.  Using all ingredients raw make it simple, the way it was meant to be.  Thanks for reminding me.  Yummy fall recipe.

This is my VERY favorite Stuffed Peppers recipe! I have been making this , not often enough, ever since I joined Allrecipes, which is YEARS ago! I DO ADD oregano and garlic. This is the BEST RECIPE for STUFFED PEPPERS. I covered it with salsa last time, and this time half salsa and half tomato juice! NOT IN THE LEAST BLAND! AND cooking it on HIGH in crockpot for 3-4 hours!

Great recipe! The closest I could find to my grandma's!
All the other recipes I've found call for cooking the rice first, or cooking the beef first.... HOGWASH! This recipe is the way to go ??

These were really good.  I sliced the peppers in half long ways and laid them flat in a casserole dish and covered with the sauce.  Took about 1-1 1/2 cook time in the oven.  My husband says this was the best stuff pepper he's ever had, and he doesn't even like stuff peppers.

My family was very impressed with this recipe. Even my kids who claim to dislike peppers cleaned their plates. I'm not a fan of green peppers so I used yellow. I did not pre cook the onions before adding them to the mix. I used quick-cook 15 minute rice.I followed the recomendation of one reviewer and substituted ground pork for the beef. Everything cooked evenly. Served with mashed potatoes. Great recipe!
