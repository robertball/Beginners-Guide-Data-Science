This recipe is delicious and easy! For a slightly healthier fish bake the mahi-mahi, because that works too.

YUMMY!!! I boiled the sauce and put more over fish.  I grilled by putting double layer of tin foil on grill and forming a boat by folding up side.  Grilled for exactly 8 mins, this method works for any fish and keeps it from sticking. No need to even flip the fish just shut the lid and leave for 8 mins. This works for any fish less then 1 inch thick.  I also used frozen Mahi Mahi from Sams and let completely defrost.

Really, Really, Really good stuff.  The only change was dried ginger instead of the fresh (didn't have any on hand).  I also added just a bit more honey after.  I baked the fish instead of pan frying (for the health factor) and reduced the sauce in a pan and poured over the fish.  Really liked how this turned out.  Thanks for the post.

Loved this recipe overall!!!

Once I get a feel for the main recipe, I like to play with the ingredients.  

My adjustments to your already great sauce are for personal preference only:  2 T. balsamic vinegar, 2 t. freshly grated ginger, 1 t. fresh key/Mexican lime or Meyers lemon juice (sweeter than regular lime or lemon juice). 

As a variation, I add a smidgeon (1/8 t.+/-) of garlic/chili sauce (can be found in Asian food section of most grocery stores) because we enjoy a little heat.

To highlight the fish, I usually serve it over a fluffy rice, flecked with bits of color such as minced cilantro, mint, or parsley, grated carrot or citrus peel and add a bright green veggie such as asparagus, green beans, or broccoli.

I've made this a few times now and I've made a couple changes to suit our tastes. I doubled the ginger and garlic. I placed the fish and marinade in a casserole dish, let it sit in the fridge 20 mins, then put the casserole dish in the over and baked it for 20 mins at 400. It's good pan-fried too, but baking it cooks it evenly so it stays juicy and really soaks up the marinade. Also I find the oil spits and makes a huge mess when made in the pan. Delish and no mess after!

OMG!!  This is incredible!  I am eating it right now as I am rating it.  I scaled it down to 2 portions and used the frozen mahi mahi filets from Costco.  I also used dried ginger as I didn't have the fresh.  I will be making this often.  Thanks for the post!!

I just have to say that if anyone rated this below 4 stars they did not prepare it correctly. (also unfair to rate recipes poorly because you burned it) I found the directions and all the ingredients perfect! This made a fabulous mahi salad.  I used the glaze as the dressing over a medley of lettuce, yellow bell peppers, red onion and fresh broccoli. The best tasting 6 WW points I ever ate.  Thanks Diana!

We really enjoyed this.  I grilled the Mahi Mahi rather than pan frying and it was superb.  The marinade/glaze is definately versatile enough to be used on shrimp, chicken, pork, and even beef.

This was fabulous!!!! I am still thinking about it four days later. Even my kids and husband who do not like fish, loved this dish. I used crystallized ginger instead of fresh and it turned out perfect. Served with a sauteed mixture of green beans, sugar snap peas and mushrooms. Placed the mahi mahi on top of the veggies. Also used the frozen mahi mahi available at Sams Club.

Served this for a dinner party and it was fabulous. I would double the marinade to have more sauce to pour over the finished dish.  Very easy.  Would use over chicken or pork also

This was very simple to prepare and yummy!  The little ones even liked it!  The sauce reminds me of a ginger sauce served at my favorite restaurant!  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used 1½ tbls of cider vinegar.  Also, I didn't have fresh ginger root so I used ½ tsp of ground ginger.  I managed to slightly burn mine but it still turned out yummy.  I will definitely make this again.  I will just start frying at a lower temperature next time.  :)

I had never cooked mahi mahi before, but we had it on a recent trip to Havana and decided to give it a whirl. This was a very good recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the fish   for a few hours, baked it (saving the marinade) at 400 degrees F. for 20 minutes and cooked/reduced the reserved marinade until thickened and poured it over the baked fish.  It was delicious, and we are making the recipe again for company this week-end.

Fantastic flavor! One of the easiest fish recipes I have ever made.  Love it!  I'm making it for the second time tonight!  My balsamic vinegar is pretty sweet, and I like a lower glycemic index sweetener, so to make it a bit less sweet, more sour and to add a bit of heat, I used agave nectar instead of honey, added a bit of key lime juice, and some habanero chili sauce. Tip for the ginger: keep a piece of ginger root in your freezer.  When you need fresh ginger, you can easily break off a piece, peel it and grate it, all while still frozen, and it's way easier than when it's not frozen.

This is fabulous.  Even my husband, who doesn't like fish unless it is battered and fried liked this.  I doubled the sauce / marinade and added about a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce.  I had a lot left over.  Next time rather than just cooking and reducing the sauce I will thicken with corn starch.  I sprinkled the fish with sesame seeds and baked the marinated fish for 10 minutes at 450.  Garnished with  fresh cut chives.  An amazing....light meal.  BTW, I served this with jasmine rice, cold sesame noodle salad and a creamy cabbage salad.  (All left overs from another meal.)  It was perfect.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmmm! Made the marinade per the recipe then reserved a few tablespons for basting, which was plenty because we only needed 2 mahi mahi filets. Let it marinate 1-1/2 hours then grilled for about 8-10 minutes. Did not add salt, I think some of the folks who found this salty may have seasoned their filets but it's NOT necessary or advisable to do so, just a bit of fresh ground pepper but please do not add any salt! Was NOT overpowering for the delicately flavored Mahi, just DON'T marinate too long, & would be a great marinade/glaze on other fish as well...The hubs usually dislikes any meat or seafood with a flavor profile anywhere near the sweeter side but he loved this & we definitely will make it again & again! Oh & one more thing - use only FRESH ginger!!! PLEASE DO NOT SUBSTITUTE GROUND GINGER - IT IS NOT THE SAME!!!

Don't bother to fry!  Baked is better.  I doubled this recipe and I fried half as the recipe states, then I baked the rest in the oven at 400 about 20 minutes.  The baked really brought out all of the flavors.  I suggest you use the fresh ginger root, it really added to the flavor and consistency of this dish.  I used Tilapia because my store was out of Mahi Mahi and it was great!  I love the taste and this will go into heavy rotation in my house.

This was excellent. Instead of frying however, I left the Mahi Mahi in the marinade and baked it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.

Really, Really good. I made it exactly as written, using only 1-2 tsp of oil in a non-stick pan to sautee. Served with steamed green beans and coconut rice. Everyone loved it. Yum!

My fiance and I both loved this recipe.  I used ground ginger because it was on hand but I think fresh ginger would be even better next time.  I pan-fried mine in sunflower oil.  It turned out perfectly and I will keep this in rotation.

We loved the ginger glaze for the mahi mahi.  Yes, it comes out very dark, almost black, but that is to be expected when dealing with soy sauce and balsamic vinegar.  It's absolutely delicious and would be great on chicken and pork too.  I baked the fish at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Super yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe, Decodiana.

I am disappointed that I had to use salmon for this as the market did not have mahi mahi.  I really enjoyed it anyway.  I marinated the fish for 2 hours and used probably just under 2T of ginger.  It was excellent.  I added some cornstarch dissolved in cool water to thicken it.  I baked it on a bake sheet at 450 for 15 minutes.  i took it out, brushed with glazed and returned to the broiler for 3 minutes until the glaze carmelized on it.  I let the fish rest for 3-5 minutes before serving and served it with sauteed cabbage and bok choy on the side.  Wonderful.

Easy and delicious. This is full of flavor. I will definitely make it again. I added the remaining marinade to the pan after turning the fish. That was just enough time to reduce the marinade AND glaze the fish, all in one step. Hubby loved this.

This was DELICIOUS! I made it once with fresh ginger as directed and it was AMAZING. The second time I made the mistake of switching to ground ginger and it was yucky yucky. lol Stick to the recipe, it's PERFECT!

I will say right up front that I used this on boneless chicken breasts pounded to half an inch thick and grilled on a stove top grill for 2 minutes per side instead of mahi mahi and it was wonderful! I'm positive it would taste just as wonderful on mahi mahi, or halibut, or any "white" fish. For my taste it would even work on turkey! The marinade itself produces a beautiful shiny glaze of a rich mahogany color. The sweetness of the honey and balsamic vinegar is balanced with the saltiness of the the soy sauce and pungency of the garlic to produce a tangy sauce that's sweet but not not cloying.  I liked the sauce so much that, rather than reducing it in a skillet, I took the reserved marinade and brought it just to a boil in a saucepan. Then I mixed a heaping teaspoon of cornstarch and a third cup of water and added that, boiling gently just until the sauce thickened. This yielded almost one full cup of sauce. I set it on the table for my family to add as they liked. I will definitely make this again.

Tried this recipe tonight with Mahi Mahi fillets. I am a semi-gourmet cook and I didn't salt the fish at all, but the resulting marinade and fish turned out tasting salty and the soy sauce or maybe it was the vinegar gave the fish an off taste. I wouldn't try this again.

This was very good. The marinade has a fabulous flavor. Ive started using the marinade sauce to dip egg rolls and potstickers in its so good. I would highly recomend this recipe to anyone who enjoys fish.

I loved it!  My changes were to decrease the soy sauce by 1T because I'm sensitive to soy;I added a T of olive oil in it's place and sprinkled a little cayenne over the fillets for some heat as well.. I grated my garlic along with my ginger for a "full flavor" please try this recipe with fresh, not powders.. :)  Soooooo yummy!

Pretty good!  We're trying to cut fat & calories, so I omitted the oil and baked the fish at 400 for about 30 minutes (it was frozen).  I didn't reduce the glaze on the stovetop, but it did get fairly thick in the oven.  I think I don't care much for the taste of mahi mahi, but I'm sure this would be good with most any white fish.

In all fairness, I am not a fish lover which probably influenced this rating.  Also, I used talapia instead of mahi-mahi because thats what I had.  It was very good though.  I will probably try this again but make it a hint sweeter this time. Just my personal preference.

This is a great recipe!  we were on vacation and got some mahi mahi fresh.  Luckily, our condo already had most of the ingredients.  Definitely fry this in a very hot skillet to caramelize the sauce.  I had the leftovers for breakfast.

The sauce was outstanding and really made this a 5.  I baked the fish on 450 for 15 minutes instead of frying.  Very yummy.

This is easy and DELICIOUS! Both kids ate seconds. Followed directions easily from just a quick glance. Served w/brown rice, sauteed spinach and steamed brussel sprouts. Cleaned my plate.

I gave this a 5 star rating not only for taste but my 7 and two year olds ate it. I added minced purple onions which when I baked it in the oven caramelized and tasted beautifully.  I doubled the sauce, but left the honey at 3 tbs as it tasted sweet enough for me.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes which I think was a bit much.  Next time I will check it at 25 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.  Its a keeper!

Awesome. One of the best marinades ive had. I made a few adjustments, i added about 30-50% less spices than the recepie called for because it seemed like a lot, and I added a few squirts of lemon juice and some cayenne pepper for some heat and let them marinade for 2-3 hours. I made a combo of mahimahi and tilapia, and baked them for 17-18mins at 400F, both came out great. Im probably going to try it on chicken sometime.

Great Recipe!  I used a lemon infused balsamic vinegar (Trader Joe's) and added a good splash of lime juice - yummy!!  It would also be good with some coconut rum added.  The glaze really toned down the somewhat strong flavor of the mahi mahi.  I will try this on salmon next.  Thank you Diana!

I couldn't find mahi mahi so I used Talapia instead.  My whole family, all six members, loved this recipe!  The glaze compliments the fish so well!

This recipe is a keeper!  I made it using swordfish and enjoyed it, as did my husband and 8 year old son.  Though I served it with a romaine salad and rice pilaf, I think it would be better with plain rice and a nice, light fruit salad (I'm thinking mangoes and pineapple and mandarin oranges would be nice.)

Definitely worth a try!

Not anything that I will make again. Mahi is one of my favorites, but this glaze totally overpowers the fish. Way too sweet. Cut the honey by at least a T if you don't want this to taste like ginger-balsamic syrup. Or try it with chicken. The only thing I added was a few shakes of Sriracha. Served over coconut jasmine rice & broccoli. We didn't finish the fish.

Awesome recipe.  I changed only the way in which I cooked the mahi mahi.  I too grilled it (medium heat, direct, 4 mins each side) and then heated the reserved marinade to pour over just before serving.  The Best!  My husband loved it and said it was a "keeper".  I think it's something I definitely would prepare for guests.  Thank you!

This was a good recipe - my husband inhaled it!!  I cooked it for 4 minutes on each side and I thought it was too overdone.  Next time I will cook less - and might add some asian hot sauce to the sauce!

This was an easy and lovely marinade. I found out, however, that I am not a fan of mahi mahi (not your fault and not factored into my review/rating). Fortunately I had the foresight to have marinaded some tilapia filets also. The marinade worked well with the delicate fish. I will definitely use the marinade with other seafood favorites. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is the first time I have cooked mahi mahi; and I am so very glad I found this recipe. YUM!!!  I loved this dish, and it was surprisingly easy to make.  I did turn the fish more than once while in the pan-make sure you DON'T do this-it lost a lot of the carmalized layer--which is soooo tasty.  Beautiful dish!!!!

My 10 year old boys and my wife (who doesn't like "fish") all loved this dish.  I skipped the salt before adding to marinade and it was almost too salty.  I would suggest low-sodium soy sauce.

The market I went to didn't have Mahi Mahi so I made it with flounder instead.  Still delicious! Followed instructions to a tee. The husband loved it.

It was good.  I halved the whole recipe.  Teryaki-ish.  May use a little more ginger next time.  Will try a different recipe though next time.

There was no mahi mahi at the fish market so I substituted sablefish. Made the marinade according to recipe and marinated the fish for about 2 hours. I then baked it (including the marinade) in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes. This turned out beautifully.Spooned some of the baked marinade over the fish as I served it. Everyone raved about it. I'll be keeping this recipe handy!

Delicious.  I use Gluten-Free soy sauce (Tamari) and where it says to marinade the fish with skin side down, I actually marinade it with the meat side down.  That way the marinade soaks into the fish.  My husband I love ginger so I increased the amount (2 tsp).

I registered for this site just to review this recipe.  The marinade is perfect; not too sweet, not too salty (like so many of the other recipes I've tried). I did make a few alterations: I couldn't find Mahi Mahi at my local grocery store so I used tilapia, and I baked it (20 minutes at 400) with the marinade as some other reviewers suggested. I think this marinade would be great on just about anything! Great recipe.

Excellent recipe with LOADS of flavor!  I've made the recipe several times because my mahi-fishing husband loves it cooked this way the best.  I found it to be too salty/tangy for my taste, so this last time I made it with low sodium soy sauce instead and I'm now in love with this dish as well!

I really wanted to like this. I paid a small fortune for the freshest fish while in Florida. I prepared exactly to the recipe. My family was not impressed. Rather bland and boring. Needed some crunch or texture. Will not repeat.

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  Simply said.  Made exactly as stated in the recipe, sauteed in the skillet (skin side down first) and it was just heavenly.  Served with a side of Japanese Green Beans and Mandarin Orange Salad over brown rice.  You will not be disappointed with this recipe.

I was looking for a way to cook Mahi Mahi that would step things up a bit and this fit the bill perfectly. I had all the ingredients on hand. I only made one minimal substitution and that was organic blue agave for the honey, I thought this recipe was fantastic. 

My only caution is that when I placed the fish from the marinade to the hot pan, I found the residual marinade on the fish began to burn before the fish was ready to flip. For this reason, I would recommend heating the pan to just medium rather than medium high.  Regardless the fix was easy. Vinegar deglazes pans on the spot and since the marinade has balsamic i went ahead and poured my marinade into the pan with the fish and allowed the marinade to deglaze and reduce simultaneously. The end result was perfection. The Fish was juicy, tender and flaky. The glaze was amazing. Can't wait for the left overs tomorrow. This one is a keeper!!

Absolutely fantastic!  Only thing I did differently was to add chopped green onions to the marinade.  It was delicious and not a single bite of fish was leftover.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The marinade and sauce were good, I am just not sure about the cooking method.  All the sugars in the marinade caused it to burn before it cooked through.  I may try this again in the summer and grill it instead.

This was a really flavorful glaze!  For me, the fresh ginger really made it, so I would not sub dried/ground ginger for the fresh root.  This marinade would also be delicious for pork chops.  Thanks!

My whole family loved this.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I substituted a generous 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and it was great.  I think I will try it with the fresh ginger next time.

This recipe is "okay" but to be honest it really lacked a good ginger flavor. This tasted like wanna-be teriyaki sauce... which is fine, if you want a teriyaki flavor. Wasn't what I was expecting... overall this was good, not great.

My husband says "Yeah! Give that a 5!"  Even the kids ate it up.  We had frozen mahi mahi, thawed in the fridge covered with the marinade for a few hours then drained off the liquid.  Cooked the fish on the charcoal grill and the sauce on the stovetop to reduce.  Served with brown rice and steamed green beans.  Excellent.  Thank you for the recipe.

Tasty and quick! I did not change any of the ingredients, but I did change the cooking method.  Rather than preparing in a skillet with oil, I baked this in the oven & then drizzled with the reduced glaze.   I think this would work really well with salmon, also.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Freakin' FANTASTIC!! I was surprised that something so simple to make could taste so great. My whole family loved it, even one of my son's friends that don't like fish. I cooked ours on the grill. I had a small piece left over which I ate the next day. I don't usually eat left over fish but this was great reheated. I will make again, again and again!!

I would rate this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  It was very tasty!  My husband is not a big ginger fan, so I was afraid he would hate it, but he absolutely loved it! I will definately make this again.  Really easy and pretty fast.  Not bad for a weeknight meal, but fancy enough to even make for company!  I just used the frozen mahi mahi filets that you can get at Costco and it worked perfectly.

I am not usually a fan of fish... or ginger... but I went for it anyway and it was fantastic. I used ground ginger instead of fresh, and I bought the marinated mahi mahi from Trader Joes, but I still made the glaze and it was perfect. I used more garlic, and added sesame seeds. I served it with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad (also on allreceipes and is fantastic). I will be making this again, thanks!

Easy and very flavorful. Just personal preference, I used 2 cloves garlic and decreased the vinegar by half. Also added toasted sesame seeds and a  few snips of cilantro at the end of cooking. Superb with a nice presentation.

Fabulous. This was my first time cooking mahi mahi and this recipe was a lovely way to get my introduction. I used ground ginger instead of fresh but the flavor was still great. Will try with the fresh stuff next time. I served this with couscous mixed with green onion and diced tomatoes - I think the mahi mahi and its glaze should go with a very simple side to allow the taste to really pop.

Delicious! I found it was easier to slice the ginger into very thin pieces. The slices also added a nice decorative touch. The marinade works well with chicken, too.

This was my first time preparing mahi mahi.  I didn't have fresh ginger root in the house, so I used about 3/4t of ground ginger.  The taste of ginger was overpowering.  Next time, I'll try with the freshly grated ginger root.

This was awesome.  I had to cook the fish fillets about twice as long as instructed...perhaps these fillets were thicker than most.  The extra cooking created a crispy crust that tasted real good.  This is a dish that I would be pleased with if I ordered it in an upscale seafood restaurant!

I would recommend baking the fish as pan frying something with a high sugar marinade makes it very quick to burn.  I would also use a lower heat to make the glaze as, once again, it is quick to burn.

Delicious.  I cooked it in a bit of butter, but it was awesome.  Not a huge fish lover, so the glaze makes the dish!!!!

I made this exactly as written and watched the Video too which was helpful.  It was sweet and tangy, if you like that.  I served it with broccoli and bread.  Rice would have been good too but we were wanting a light meal last night.

One of the best fish recipes I have ever made! It turned out nicely cooked, and even though the marinating time was short the flavors were still strong! Great dinner dish for when you don't have a lot of time, but want something yummy. The glaze is delicious, I may or may not have licked it off the plate...

Delicious, moist, healthy and easy!  Baked in the marinade for 20 min on 400 and it was perfect. My husband who hates fish even loved it. Yummmm!  (Agree with other comments...don't add any salt. It's already salty enough from the soy sauce)

Very yummy!  I removed the fish from the marinade, patted it dry, then grilled it on a lightly oiled grate. The marinade reduced on the stove while I did the grilling and it came together wonderfully! Great recipe! Thx!

I loved it, but I will go a bit lighter on the balsamic next time.  I also found that on med-high 3 minutes is plenty per side.

Marinade is excellent. Followed what others suggested: I took the glass dish and threw the whole thing in the oven @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Everything came out amazing. Broke up the fish, served it with rice and poured much of the marinade (from the glass dish) over the whole thing... perfect.

Have made this twice now.  The only change is both times I have not had fresh ginger so I used ground & did not use the extra salt.  I am sure its even better with fresh ginger.  Also I have baked it to make it healthier.  400 degrees 17-20 minutes.

I almost never come back and rate, but this dish was amazing! I followed the directions exactly except I had to sub regular veg oil for olive oil because hubby is allergic. We just finished the meal and even my very picky 7 year old loved it. Hubby said " save that recipe!! " I also pinned this to pinterest.

I really enjoyed this recipe with a tilapia fillet. It fit my taste preferences perfectly so I didn't/won't change anything. I scaled it downed for just one person and accidentally put too much ginger. It caught me off guard when I took the first bite, but it was still a delicious dish! It goes great with brown rice. 

Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly the way it was written.  It was the BEST fish dish we have ever had, and was better than any seafood restaurant we have ever been to.  The flavors are amazing, and just right to compliment the firm, sweet mahi mahi.  Served it with pineapple/cilantro jasmine rice and green beans.  Perfect flavor, and quick too. Thank you decodiana for posting this recipe!

Best mahi recipe ever! I turn it into fish tacos and my kids & husband love it.  I add shredded lettuce, diced tomato, chopped red onion, chopped avocado and wrap it all in a warm flour tortilla.  I even whip up a little lime crema sauce to add a dollop to the top.  Absolutely delish!  Should make a larger batch because I never have any leftovers of this one in my house.

It was simple. I admit I did add more honey for the reduction only because I prefer a sweeter sauce. I needed a recipe to change things up with my costco bag of frozen mahi-mahi. This wonderfully did the trick. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this dish.  However the next time, I'll use 1 tablespoon less of the honey.  It was a tad too sweet for my taste buds.  I also baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes instead of frying it.

This is fantastic and very easy. I serve it on a bed of spring mix. The glaze makes an excellent dressing for both the fish and the greens.

OMG this is one of those rare moments where I want to jump up and down for finally finding an easy and delicious fish recipe! Usually my fish turns out dry, undercooked, etc but this fish was so moist and flaky and the sauce was perfect! Thank you!

I made this recipe with cod instead of mahi mahi, and it didn't turn out very good. I'm sure it would taste better with mahi mahi but I didn't think the sauce was anything great either. I think this recipe is just okay.

This was everything I like about a recipe: it was easy, full of flavor, and all of the ingredients were already on hand in my pantry or fridge. I even had frozen mahi mahi already in my freezer, but that is the only ingredient that I don't consider a kitchen staple.
I ate it with a side of edamame for a healthy dinner.

DELICIOUS!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added some lemon juice and the garlic chile sauce. This tasted BETTER than what I've had in restaurants. Great over mahi mahi.  Will definitely be using this again and again.

This is a perfect way to prepare mahi-mahi! It was super easy and really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for using dry ground ginger because I didn't have any fresh. Fantastic!

This was very good! I made two changes because I did not have all the ingredients on hand. I used real maple syrup in place of honey and 1/2 t dried ginger in place of fresh. I marinated for more than an hour, just due to timing, and found I had to turn the heat down to med from med-high to avoid burning the fish. Thank you for sharing!

Tried this with tilapia because it was on sale at my Fresh Market. It was amazing! Super easy, I marinated it for a bit longer and served with sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Can't wait to try it again!

This was absolutely delicious!  Didn't have fresh ginger so just used dried and it turned out great.  Crumbled the cold leftovers and put them in a salad the next day with romaine, fresh spinach, cherry tomatoes, red onion, sesame sticks and a little balsamic vinigrette...it rocked!

For me, the sauce came out looking very black but tasted great.  The fish had just the right amount of flavor from the marinade.  This was my first experience cooking mahi mahi, and I feel it was successful!

This sauce is perfect!  The Mahi filet's I picked out were over an inch thick, to compensate I browned them in a skillet for 4 minutes on each side and then finished off by baking at 375 for 10 min, the Mahi came out perfect.  My wife and I both raved about this recipe and cannot wait to make it for friends.

This is an easy and tasty recipe. I'm not a fish person and it was the first time I'd cooked fish. Was super easy and I didn't really feel like I was eating fish. Instead of pan searing the mahi mahi I grilled it between 2 pieces of foil on our indoor grill for about 5 min. Used Costco frozen Mahi Mahi fillets. Sauteed some green beans and onion in a little lemon juice and topped it with the fish and the glaze.

AMAZING! The only change I made was lightly searing the mahi mahi on the frying pan and then baking it in the oven until done.

This recipe was awesome... it was a great way to introduce my hubby and kids to fish. My husband, who swore he'd never eat fish, gobbled this up. Both my kiddos did too and were asking for seconds. The combination of the flavors in the sauce are what makes this dish so wonderful. I marinated for longer than the recipe stated because I put it away in the fridge earlier in the day for the sake of convenience later. Super easy, family friendly dish. I served it with brown rice, green beans and a salad for a fast, healthy dinner. Will definitely make this again!

Made this for dinner tonight and it's a definite winner!  I just realized when re-reading the recipe that I forgot the garlic! It was still awesome, but definitely would have been better with the garlic.  Definitely won't forget that next time!  I baked this in the oven just b/c it was easier for me.  My filets were thick and took about 18 minutes at 425. I only made 2 but left the sauce amount the same.

We really enjoyed this recipe!!  The only change I made was we only had 2 fillets but did the full recipe for the sauce.  I used dried ginger and added a touch of white wine.  Cooked for about 4 minutes on each side.  Served with fried rice and broccoli!

Marinated the fish for a slight bit longer than 20 minutes.  Baked it in the oven and it turned out great.  Be sure not to over cook it.  I think 10 minutes would have been plenty.  Sweet and salty...Yum!  Served it with cold sesame noodles.

This recipe doesn't need another 5 star review - but this was excellent!  My husband and I both absolutely loved it.  I used dried ginger, as I was out of fresh, and it was great.

Delicious!  I had tilapia filets in the freezer so used that instead of mahi mahi.  I marinated for a couple of hours instead of 20 minutes and also used the half the marinade for some green beans.  Yum.  The fish was light but full of flavor.

FANTASTIC!!!! Five stars was not enough. Made this for our Sunday supper, and even the non fish lovers LOVED IT. I did double the recipe and it was a good thing I did. They were pouring the sauce over the coconut rice I made to go along with the fish. I did want to lighten it up a bit so I grilled it on the BBQ on top of heavy duty foil. No hassle clean up too. Fantastic! We will be trying this on chicken also. YUMMMMM

I followed the recipe exactly and was extremely disappointed.  The honey in the marinade caused my fish to burn on the outside after two minutes on med-high heat.  Fortunately I didn't wait the full 4-6 minutes before realizing that and was able to save the fish by finishing it in the oven.  Though the fish itself turned out okay in the end I did not care for the glaze. All I could taste was balsamic and soy sauce and it completely overwhelmed the honey and ginger flavours and, most importantly, the fish itself!  Save your mahi mahi for another recipe!

Strong ginger flavor.  Fish was dry. I don't know if there's a way to keep mahi mahi soft & moist. Thanks for letting me try the recipe.

This is my new favorite food! The glaze on this fish, which my husband and I used on tilapia instead of mahi mahi, should be put in a jar and sold. It's delicious!

This was a delicious recipe for Mahi Mahi. My 16 year old critic loved it and went back for thirds. I used low sodium soy sauce.  I added a 1/8 of a habanero and blended the marinade in a blender.  Then when I reduced the reserved marinade I added chopped green onions, a  splash of sesame oil and a dash of sesame seeds.  This was a fabulous recipe with brown rice and stir fry vegetables to compliment.

Great flavor and easy to fix. I'll probably make a little more marinade next time, so I'll have more glaze.

Marinating and then glazing the Mahi Mahi overpowers the fish and you lose all taste the fish. I think its a good combination but maybe just glaze it while cooking??

OMG!!! This was so easy to make! The sauce was delicious! Great recipe. I added a little cornstarch diluted in a little hot water. Made the sauce a little thicker and richer.

Today in Oahu someone gave me some ONO much like Mahi Mahi. I followed recipe but steamed it in foil on the grill.  It was very good but wish I would have pan fried it then finished with the glaze sure it would be fantastic!  Happy with how it did come out but think the pan fry will give it that extra something with a slightly crispy edge.  A Keeper!

This is one if my favorite fish recipes!  I've used it for mahi but I like it even more with salmon.  The marinade is wonderful and the sauce you make at the end can be used on anything.  In fact my wife told me she'd pretty much eat anything I put that sauce on!  I prefer adding corn starch to the sauce at the end rather than cooking it down due to time.  Don't use too much or it will turn into a ginger jelly mess.  I love this recipe!!!

The glaze is amazing and that's what I'm giving the 5 stars. I did increase the quantities but maintained approximately the same proportions (although I'm an eyeballer rather than an exact measurer). I used this on thick salmon steaks. I marinated the steaks for 2 hours (not for any reason except that I wasn't ready to cook until then). I baked the salmon at 375 covered in foil for 20 mins while I reduced the glaze in a sauce pan. Then removed the foil from the fish, spooned the glaze over the steaks, and baked for another 5 minutes uncovered. Served on top of a rice medley with a side of carrots braised in a sauce that was similar to ingredients in the glaze. Both I and my husband, who isn't necessarily a fish fan, loved it. Will definitely keep this recipe and try again the next time I have Mahi-Mahi on hand.

This was VERY good, my husband requested I make it again within a week of the first time I made it!  The only change I suggest is frying the fish over Medium heat (Medium High burns the outside while leaving the inside almost raw) and then cooking the marinade to make the glaze over Medium High heat!  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!!!!

We were not crazy about this on the Mahi Mahi, and in fact didn't use the extra sauce at all because it was too overpowering, yet the fish was too strong also.  But we tried the sauce with chicken and it was great!  Will use this again with chicken probably, and maybe through in some grilled pineapple, too.

Made this tonight for dinner, and we did not care for it. I have to agree with another reviewer's comment on how it was too salty and had a acidic taste.  Next time I will try the Macadamia Nut Crusted Recipe instead.

Amazingly simple. I used frozen filets, marinating them 45 min in sauce, which I enhanced with 1 tsp oriental hot chili sauce. I baked them 30 min, covered, in a 400 degree oven.  While the fish was cooking I reduced the marinade in a small pan, med heat 10 min, then low until fish was ready, served fish and sauce over couscous with stir fried veggies.It was fabulous.

Such a good recipe.  LOVED IT.  I did like others suggested and baked my fish instead.  Just pour all the marinade off into a sautee pan, then put the fish in the oven and bake at 400 for about 20 minutes.  You can make the glaze while the fish is cooking.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM

This was DELICIOUS!

I was leery when I saw Balsamic Vinegar as one of the ingredients, but I used the recommended 3 tbsp and it came out FANTASTIC. This was soo good, it's going in the recipe book. Will be made again!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly - maybe marinading a little longer - and it was excellent!  The mahi mahi turned out nice and moist with a nice brown, almost crust on it.  I did make the glaze and served it next to the fish instead of on top.  The glaze was a little too much for me and since the fish already had a great flavor, I didn't need the glaze.  Thank you - I will make this again!

My family had mixed reviews about this recipe.  My husband would have given it 5 stars, the kids (9 and 7), would have given it 0 stars, and I thought a 3 was appropriate.  We prepared this recipe with one minor change.  We found out after we had started that we were out of honey, so we used sugar instead.  The glaze tasted good, although I didn't feel like it actually "glazed" on the fish.  Maybe this was due to the sugar instead of the honey, I'm not sure.  Anyway, it seemed like more of a marinade than a glaze.  The mahi-mahi seemed too fishy, and it overwhelmed the taste of the sauce.  If we try this again, and we might, we will try a different type of fish with it.

This review is only for the marinade, because I used salmon rather than Mahi Mahi. I love salmon, but I generally make it the same way and I was looking for something different. This sauce was out of this world! I marinated the salmon in the sauce and then roasted it in the oven. So flavorful and delicious. I'm giving the recipe 4 stars rather than 5, because I had to increase the ginger significantly to get the best flavor. Thank you for the marinade recipe - I'll be making it often!

Wow - this was fantastic!  I was looking for a fish recipe and was trying to break out of my salmon rut, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  It was really easy (the most complicated part was the marinade!) and tasted like something you would eat at a fancy Chinese restaurant. The flavors in the sauce itself and with the addition of the fish are great - I highly recommend this recipe!  

I'm reviewing again because we've eaten this a couple of times lately and it is just fantastic.  I've been using tilapia because it's cheaper, easier to find, and better for you, and it works out great.  I have served it twice with sweet potato fries - somehow the flavors work really well together, and the sauce is so yummy I dip the fries in it!

Fantastic! I'm not even a fish lover, always end up frying it! This was delicious! I cooked it on the George Foreman grill for 4 minutes, fast and easy. Just reduce the sauce in a small pan...Thanks!

This was a good recipe, my family lighted the mild flavor. I didnt put the balsamic vinegar and it had a real nice honey flavor. I also add to the marinade when cooking some shallots.

This glaze is yummy and sweet. I used only 2 thick mahi maki steaks with the skin on and subsituted rice vinagar instead of balsamic. I marinated each side for ten minutes in the glass dish and fried it in the pan. My suggestion would be to be careful with your cooking time and temperature. I used a Calphalon skillet on a regular gas stove and when I left it on the skin side for four minutes, the skin was charred and the inside was a little too rare, so I might be better to flip the fish while cooking if you use thicker pieces. The glaze was really good though and I think it could be used on salmon or maybe even pork tenderloins.

This recipe was superb.  The glaze is very flavorful and a perfect combo with the fish.  I served it with a simple brown rice pilaf, green beans and whole grain rolls.  Fabulous and healthy too!

Usually I am wary of powerful sauces like this because I don't like my fish drowned in muck. I usually stick to the simpler garlic/olive oil/citrus marinades, but I tried this one and it worked nicely. The top of the fish had a nice flavor while this inside maintained a true mahi quality. And it really is a total cinch to prepare. For a difficult fish to prepare well, this is a nice way to do Mahi.

This recipe is in my regular meal rotation.  I typically use it on salmon, but I imagine it would work on lots of types of fish.  The only change I make is to use a little less oil in the marinade itself.  I love that it makes a nice sauce to go with the fish.

Such a great staple recipe! This dish looks elaborate enough to serve to company, but is also simple and quick enough for a weeknight meal. Quick tip: I noticed when I fried the fish on medium-high heat, it left behind a black gunky residue in the pan that was hard to scrape off. I fry my fish on medium to medium-low heat for a bit longer instead. It's easier to scrape any residue off the pan (if any) between the fish fry step and the glaze reduction step, and also makes a moister, more tender fish. Just my two cents. Besides that, I never deviate in any other way from the recipe. So good and easy!

This is delicious!!! The only thing I did different is add double as much ginger as the flavor of it didn't come through enough with just the 1 teaspoon!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. One thing I'll probably do next time is marinate in a freezer bag to save on dishes, but don't have to change the recipe itself. Served with couscous and green beans. A great meal for a busy weeknight!

Did it with Tilapia and ground ginger bc that's what I had on hand...was awesome! It paired well with string beans and sweet potato. The sweet from the fish meshed well with the potato.

I just made this recipe and it was dissapointing. I scaled it down to 2 portions so possibly that was the problem. It lacked flavor and my family did not enjoy it either. I won't be making this again. (:

Just had this for supper! Awesome!   

Made up the sauce in a Pyrex dish and only made two Mahi Mahi filets from Costco. Put in refrigerator for 20 minutes then 375 degree convection oven for just under 25 minutes. 

Sauce was excellent over the rice as well!

The glaze was terribly bitter. I had to rinse off the glaze so we could salvage the fish.  No clue as to what went wrong.

I made this and it turned out well. I then tried the marinade with tofu, and it was fantastic! Since the marinade has such a strong flavour, it really enhances the tofu (which is notoriously boring). After letting the tofu sit in the marinade overnight, simply toss in rice flour (for a crispy coating)and fry it.

Wow this was really good. Followed recipe to a T and it came out perfectly. Even my fussy teenage boys liked it.  Made rice and salad on the side and it was a great, healthy meal. I will certainly make this again and use this marinade recipe for other types of fish.  I wonder how this would be with chicken or even pork?

This was really great! Thank you! I followed it basically as written, except that I downsized it a bit for the amount of mahi I had. Oh, and I totally forgot the garlic, but the vegetables I made along side had so much I decided it wasn't worth throwing it in at the end! Was excellent with white rice and a stir fry of mushrooms, soy beans, onions and cilantro. Merci.

I had to substitute the fresh ginger with powdered ginger but even my pickiest eater who is 5 years old, loved it.
  So had to edit review because I made this again only I couldn't get the mahi-mahi so i used catfish. I originally used this when we lived in Florida and fresh fish was easy to come by. Now we live in Utah and the assortment is more limited. However, I found that the glaze still tasted fabulous on the catfish too. And my now 9 year old picky eater still loves it. I have used dried ginger and also now found the Spice World Squeeze ginger adds more of a pop to the flavor. It's now my go to as well as the minced garlic that Spice World also has in squeeze or glass jars. Save this busy mom time on the mincing process. Enjoy this on white rice. Also I always double the sauce because my family is Huge on sauce. They love to drown everything in sauce so the double up is a must for sauce lovers.

My husband and I made this last night, and we loved it. I would definitely make  this again, and maybe add other variations to it (or will try baking it next time). I would definitely make this for company- it's easy, delicious, and impressive! I also think other fish  or meat could be used as a substitute- as to what a few other friendly fellow chef-eviewers have said. Thanks for posting this! :)

We love fish and try to eat fresh fish two or three times a week. I have favorite recipes but was looking for something new...found this and have used it 5 times in the past few months.  I have used it with swordfish, mahi mahi and halibut....delicious each time.  My family loves it.  My new favorite fish recipe!

This was a great recipe! If you use alternating amounts of honey or balsamic vinaigrette, it will change the fish nicely to sweeter or saltier. This is a perfect weeknight meal!

This was really quick and easy as well as delicious. I also used dried ginger as I didn't have fresh and it still turned out great. My husband and 3 year old daughter really enjoyed it too. I will make it again!

Excellent flavors!  I pan fried it this time but next time I will definitely grill it.  Loved the glaze and my husband said we should try some orange peel in it.

Thank you so much for sharing this fantastic dish.  I got my cast iron skillet fired up and seared it on both sides.  It got those great grill marks and added the extra sauce when I dished it out.  The flavors are great.  I'll definitely be printing this out and making it over and over.

AMAZING! There are no words to say how great this was! I was scared to try b/c I don't make fish very often. I only made a few changes, I didn't have ginger root so used the regular spice, also only marinated about 15 minutes due to time. 
Cooked 5 minutes on each side and it turned out perfectly. My first 5 star rating and it is very much deserved.

Made this tonight, delicious.  I did what others said and doubled the sauce, baked it at 400 for twenty minutes and boiled and reduced the sauce to spoon over the fish when done.  I added some cornstarch, I like thick sauce.  Everyone raved over the flavors.  I will do this with other types of fish.  Thanks for a great recipe that was so easy.  Next time I might use reduced sodium soy sauce, it seemed salty to me when I doubled it.  I am not a big fan of salt, others might be.

I used 1 less TBLS of balsamic than the recipe called for because mine was very old I thought it may be stronger than usual. The only change I will make next time is adding a little more honey or substituting the honey with sugar.

Delicious!!  I baked mine instead of frying, which totally eliminated all of the oil.  This reduced the calories to only 84 per serving!  Bake at 350 for 15-18 mins then top with glaze.  Definitely going in my rotation!

Sorry, but I thought the sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the fish. We had fresh wild-caught Mahi Mahi, and it was just too much for the subtle flavor of the fillets. This might be a better recipe for frozen Mahi Mahi (as suggested by other raters). The marinade tasted great before it went on the fish, so if I make it again, I will not marinate prior and will use a lot less.

Was very good. I did it with a brown rice and put the marinade on the rice. Definitly try to buy low sodium soy sauce.

Pretty dang good!  I double the sauce, put the cooked hot fish on raw baby spinach (it will wilt) and spoon the sauce over the fish.  A lot like Pf changs sea bass dish.  Serve brown rice on the side.  Boyfriend loves this!

This was amazing. My wife thought this was the best ever. I put the peice of fish over a bed of spring mix, and used the glaze for the dressing. Some diced up peaches over the salad was the final touch. Super tasty.

I was in such a cooking slump....until today! This was a game=changer for sure! I cooked it with the ingredients as it was written--including the fresh ginger. Go for the fresh stuff, folks. It's a key ingredient, so why compromise flavor? In my opinion, it makes a huge difference. I did improvise and grill the fish rather than saute it. Like another reviewer suggested, I reduced the remaining marinade down and drilled it across the fish. That's the way to go! It tastes a lot like the ginger sauce at Japanese restaurants. You must try this!

Tried this tonight but instead of cooking it in veg oil I used olive oil and instead of cooking it over med-high heat I turned the heat to medium as on med-high it was burning and cooking too fast. Great taste though.

I love quick, easy flavorful recipes I don't have to tweak!  I was looking for a great Mahi Mahi recipe my husband would eat.  (picky about fish).  Not only did he eat it, he loved it and so did the kiddos.  The only thing I would do different is make more sauce because it was so good.  Paired it with Oven-Roasted Asparagus from this site and Bazmati brown long grain rice.  Fabulous!

The marinade/glaze was overpowering and the taste of the fish was disguised by all the 'WAM!' flavors. Prep time was quick and easy and cooking the fish was also fast. A simple salmon with salt and pepper tastes better than this. I will not be making again.

I thought the original recipe was pretty good, but for my personal taste,  I felt the balsamic vinegar taste out weighed the ginger flavor.  So when I tried it again, I made two  substitutions.  First, the soy sauce for Japanese Shoyu, a less salty, milder soy and Mirin for the Balsamic.  Fresh ground ginger is a must, the powder just doesn't cook the same.

I made this last night and all 4 of my kids and husband loved it.  We don't eat a lot of fish at our house but I know how good it is for you so I thought I would try this recipe.  It was amazing.  I would highly recommend it, even if you don't like fish!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  Strong (but tasty) ginger flavor that went well with the fish.  Quick and easy for a weeknight dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I substituted sesame oil for the olive oil, and added a small amount of thai basil.  It was so good!  Glad I followed the recipe otherwise.

AMAZING! The Ginger Glaze was to die for. The only variation I did was use a vingarette instead of balsamic simply because I didn't have any. It didn't hurt it at all. Deserves an award!

The marinade for this was awesome, however it did overpower the fish.  Next time, instead of marinading the fish I am going to reduce the marinade and drizzle it over the fish before serving.

My husband thought it was really tasty, but I thought it would have been better with a little less honey and more ginger and garlic (personal preference). It could have been the pomegranate balsamic vinegar that I used instead of regular to make it taste a bit sweeter. Thanks for the recipe! :o)

Fantastic-I tossed it under the broiler instead of pan frying it and just reduced the glaze in a saucepan. Was a huge h it with the kiddo too.

Really good recipe.  Grilled this on the BBQ and oh so tastey.  Severed with Orozo Rice and steamed spinach as side dishes.  Can't wait to serve this one for company.  It is that good.

This is a wonderful dish.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly how they are, but I followed another reviewers suggestion on making foil boats and grilling it.  I served it with Coconut Rice and Almond Green Beans, both recipes from this site.  It was amazing and everyone loved it, no left overs.

This was great! I made it once and then decided it needed a few additions. I added a tiny bit of salt, some red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, and about two tablespoons of ginger garlic paste (found at asian markets) to the marinade. Then pan fried for about 3 min each side. I like my fish really moist. It was so yummy!!!

It's so easy, it's ridiculous! I just finished making this dish, which we have had about 6 times in the last couple months since stumbling upon the recipe. If I could give it more stars, I would. I have to say, I don't love fish...never have, but it turns out I LOVE mahi mahi after eating this delicious dish. I have substituted rice wine vinegar instead of balsamic for a more asian spin on it. I have also found that I like to double the recipe for the marinade to make more of the awesome glaze to drizzle over rice and veggies. Other than that, I stick to the recipe. You won't be disappointed!

Made this for a party and everyone loved it...even the non-fish eaters tried it and liked it.  People ate more fish with their desserts, which was funny!  I used about 6 cloves of garlic and pressed about 2 Tablespoons of fresh ginger thru my garlic press.  I marinated the fish for about 3 hours.  Yummy!

This was just ok. I was excited to make it after reading the amazing reviews.  I followed the recipe except I added more garlic which I always do and it just didn't do much for me.  I love fish, love sauce on fish.  Not sure what was missing for me but it was just ok.

taste wise: awesome, burst with bold flavor. Reminds me of japanese teriyaki sauce. level of difficulty: super duper easy. health wise: if you have diabetes, this will take your blood sugar to the roof. But overall, great recipes for lazy cook like me. By the way, you can use some of the glaze on the salad so you won't need to add more dressing on the salad (save some calorie counts).

Absolutely delish!  Won't make Mahi Mahi any other way after this.  If you are looking to impress someone with a very simple recipe, try this one, you won't go wrong.

This is delicious...I used salmon instead of mahi mahi.  I didn't have time to marinate it either so I poured the sauce over the salmon and baked it at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  It was very good...my boyfriend said it was the best dinner I have ever made.

The sauce is what really makes this recipe. One reviewer said it tastes similar to sauces found in asian cooking & I have to agree. Without it, the fish is kind of bland :) but its good for you. I overcooked the fish but I think the sauce itself is awesome.

This is a delicious glaze/marinade recipe! I substituted local whitefish instead of the mahi mahi, and omitted the salt & pepper seasoning. I marinated the fish for about 20-25 minutes, during which time I cooked some brown rice and started sautéeing some mixed vegetables (asparagus, peppers, mushrooms...). I then added the fish to the cooking vegetables in the skillet, and cooked it for 3-4 minutes per side (it was a thin fillet). When everything was cooked, I poured the marinade on top & let it cook down, then served the fish & veggies on top of a bed of rice. It was absolutely delicious & will be part of my recipe repertoire from now on! Thank you!

Very good! I overcooked the Mahi Mahi (by accident, of course!) Yet, it still came out great and the sauce was absolutely outstanding over rice. Served with sauteed green beans. Will definitely make again.

This is a Great Marinade Recipe and can only be improved by keeping "Gourmet Garden crushed herbs" on hand You get them in the produce section and they come in tubes. They freeze great and then you can add fresh ground ginger, lemon grass, garlic, and chili pepper to the marinade in a matter of a minute and be done with fresh tasting goodness being the reward!! Yumm

Wonderful dish...didn't change a thing!  My only problem was the splattered oil when I put the fish into the hot oil...next time I would decrease the temperature to medium.  Hubby liked the reduced glaze on his rice as well as the fish.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was delectable. My boyfriend is generally nervous in the kitchen, but I had him follow this recipe and it came out *perfect* ... I made some mashed potatoes on the side and drizzled the excess marinade over it. I'm drooling just thinking about it. So delicious.

I would not change anything with this recipe with the exception of the cooking method. I find it a little difficult to get the fish to cook evenly on the stove-top. However baking the fish at 400 degrees for 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested cooks the fish evenly and makes for a succulent fish dinner. I then use a small saucepan to cook down the glaze and pour it on top of the baked fish fillets. I made this along with the recipe for "sesame noodles" from this site for a romantic dinner with my special lady and she was pretty impressed. This recipe is definitely worth the effort.

My kids and hubby loved this too!  Fast and easy - including the marinating time.  I used frozen filets and defrosted them in their individual packages in cold water first.  Didn't take long at all.  Served it with mixed rice mix and Chinese veggie mix.

I made this dish for dinner tonight and it was amazing!  It was incredibly easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand (well almost...I only had ground ginger instead of fresh) I also decided to bake the fish (16 min @ 400)instead of frying and it was delicious. I served it with brown rice and fresh green beans and there were no leftovers.  this will definitely become a regular dish in my house.

This dish was delicious!! My husband and daughter equally enjoyed it. I initially considered doubling the marinade/glaze amounts because we like a good amount of glaze or gravy on our food, but the recipe as written resulted in plenty for us.

Definitely use fresh ginger! This was incredible. I used 3 frozen tilapia fillets and baked it at 220 degrees C for 30 minutes, turning over in between. Baked it while it was still frozen, so there was a lot of gravy. I used half a tablespoon less of honey and upped the soya sauce a little. Very yummy!

This is the second time I have used this marinade.  I think this is a wonderful way to serve Mahi Mahi.  A family member loves burned food so I used a cast iron skillet and cooked at a medium high heat on the skin side to sear for 6 minutes, then turned down stove for meaty side to finish cooking time. Came out great. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! I grilled it on the BBQ and served it with an Asian inspired rice and vegetable mixture.

Very easy to make and great flavor. The 20-minute marination is perfect for making a side dish to go with the fish. I halved the recipe since it's just for my husband and I, but I added the same amount of ginger root and garlic. I will probably add even more next time. I also did not add any salt to the fish before marination. I'm adding this to my recipe folder!

I used this on chicken because I didn't have any mahi mahi layingn around, and it was delicious!  So easy and so good.  Another recipe you can't screw up!

I marinate mahi mahi or tilapia for 30 min-1 hour in this marinade and then broil the fish in the oven- easy, nutritious, and delicious! (I've also used it as a marinade for chicken kabobs- like a delicious, savory teriyaki.) It is a favorite with my kids. Once I used ground ginger because I was out of fresh. It was still good, but the fresh ginger gives it that extra zing. This is one of my go-to recipes. I give it 5 PLUS stars!

Excellent dish and easy to make. This was a real crowd pleaser. The only thing I changed was to add more fresh ginger. I used the frozen Mahi Mahi from Costco and fed 14 people - no leftovers.

A quick and tasty marinade for mahi mahi.  The balsamic vinegar added a little extra sweetness.  I could see this working well with chicken, salmon, or boneless pork chops.  Thanks for sharing, we will make this again!

Yum! I didn't use Mahi Mahi, I used either cod or pollack ( just grabed what was in the freezer). I didn't marinate it too long because I didn't want to "cook" the fish, since mahi mahi is a meater fish than the pollack or cod it can take the long marinade time. I didn't use honey, I used brown sugar.  I loved it. I served it with Carrots and brown rice.

Very good recipe!  I've prepared it as is and it is very tasty.  My whole family loved it -- hubby, teenager and 4-year old!  I look for quick and easy recipes and this recipe fit the bill!  I've substituted the honey for a maple agave blend syrup and still delicious!  This recipe is indeed a winner!

Excellent.  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Teriyaki and I did use garlic powder and ginger powder, but it was still an easy and delicious recipe.  We grilled the fish and potatoes.  My husband liked it, but not as much as I did.  No matter, I'm the cook in the house!  Sorry, but the food was gone before I could take a picture!  Thank you for sharing.

I thought the balsamic vinegar overpowered the sauce.  It wasn't tragic, but I'd leave out the balsamic next time.

I used this on salmon and next time I'll double the sauce.  It was fabulous!!  I made jasmine rice and placed the salmon on top and would have liked a little more sauce to have with the rice.  Great Meal, Thank You!!

Excellent!  Even my husband, who is not a fish lover, thought it was excellent.  I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add some heat and would do that again.  Cooking time listed was perfect and the glaze is a must!  Would be equally as good on tuna and/or salmon.  Surprisingly, very filling.

Delicious!! I had to use apple cider vinegar due to hubby's aversion to balsamic :( but it was excellent! The only thing needed is about 1/2-1 teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in a tbsp. or so of water, BOILED with the marinade. I must note that this marinade is incredible with chicken, and makes an amazing sandwich with a pineapple slice, SWISS cheese, tomato and mayo on a roll!

When my 5 year old son found out I was making this for dinner, he said, "Then I'm not eating anything tonight!"  But we have a one-bite rule in the house and when he finally tried it he ate it all and asked for more.  "You can make this every night!" he said.  My one year old gagged on it at first, but the second time we had it, she also gobbled it up.  Score one for the mommies!  Yes, and daddy loved it too, even though he usually objects to fish.  I also baked this dish instead of frying it and it turns out tender and yummy!

I'm a chef at a country club, and during the off season I cook dinner a few nights a week for a family.  They were looking for something different, and that wasn't made with tons of oil and butter.  I found this recipe and both they and I LOVE IT!  It's so easy and delicious.  If your local grocer of fish market doesn't have mahi mahi, you can substitute with haddock, scrod, or swordfish.  I just throw the swordfish in the oven for 10 minutes to ensure it cooks all the way through!!!  AWESOME!

Yum! This is a great recipe for fish lovers (me) or people who are so-so about fish (the rest of my family). We all enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly as it is for rating purposes, but next time I will use the grill since it's my preferred method for cooking fish. I might add a bit more garlic, as well.

Didn't really like the combination of flavors - skewed too sweet for my taste and probably too much ginger too.  Hubby was fine with it though.

Basic ingredients, foolproof, and delicious! Only used 1 tbsp. of olive oil. I made this twice-- first baked (1 lb of mahi, 400F, 15 min), then on the George Foreman. Both were great, but the george foreman version was far superior. I'm sure it would be even better on an outdoor grill.  Served with a colorful mixed greens salad and brown rice-- nice and healthy.

very tasty.  I thawed frozen mahi mahi and patted it dry and it absorbed the marinade nicely.  Let sit for 10 minutes or so then baked.  I ran out of balsamic vinegar so I was a liitle light on that, and used ground ginger and garlic powder but it still came out tasting great.  I was a little concerned that the sauce would overwhelm the fish, but no such problem.  The glaze on top of the baked fish was delicious. I'll definitely make this again.  p.s. had it with a glass of gewurtztraminer which went with it nicely.

This fish is absolutely delicious! The marinade is very easy, marinating time is short, but enough time to steam some rice and throw together a salad, and PRESTO!  You've got a 5-star meal.  The glaze is quick and very yummy - make extra for the rice.  Fish is melt-in-your mouth tender, and you'll want to savor every bit. Thanks - this is a keeper, for sure!

I was at a loss as to how to serve mahi mahi, but this did the trick! I skipped frying it, and broiled instead. From what I can remember, it only took a few minutes!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband raved about how good this was throughout the meal.  Instead of a glass dish I put the marinade ingredients in a ziptop baggie, squished them around and put the fish in it.  As others mentioned I too baked the fish to reduce fat.  I was in a hurry so didn't take time to make the reduction which I was sorry about once we were eating.  Also, I was out of fresh garlic and ginger so used powdered; can't wait to make it with the fresh spices.  Served it with a brown rice dish.  I'm trying to find more easy, nutrious fish recipies and this will now be a regular for us.  Thanks!

This was a big hit.  It's similar to a salmon marinade we use often, but without the orange juice.  It goes well with mahi and would work well with other fish as well.

I threw this together for my husband who loves fish.  I kept the glaze recipe the same, but only used 2 mahi filets.  After marinating, I baked the fish at 350 for 20 minutes while I cooked the excess marinade on the stove until it cooked down into a glaze-like consistency.  We give this 4.5 stars.

Very good "full bodied" flavor.  I also used powdered ginger since I didn't have any fresh on hand.  Came out very tasty!

Delish! I couldn't find any Mahi Mahi so I used Tilapia instead. I baked it instead at 350 for 15-20 minutes (anymore it will turn dry!), and it turned out fantastic! This recipe is highly recommended. :)

Ohhh this is good!  I doubled the sauce and cooked the fish on the BBQ using foil as previously recommended.  My 6 year old son gobbled it up!  The sauce would be good with chicken or pork but be sure to make extra!

Absolutely delicious, though I baked the fish in the oven for about 15 minutes instead of frying and then thickened the sauce, serving with steamed veggies and rice.  I also substituted fish sauce instead of soy sauce, due to being allergic to soy.

We thought this was very good and will make it again for sure!  I used dried ginger and 2 tbs honey, 1 tbs molasses.  I will try making it with fresh ginger next time because it might make it even better.

This was really really good. I never cooked dolphin fish before and so when I saw the frozen bag of them at Costco I decided to try it and came on AR to find a good recipe. I have to say this is a keeper. The only thing I would suggest is to start reducing the marinade in another saucepan before you start to fry the fish, that way, by the time you are ready to serve, the fish and glaze are warm.

It was a nice glaze, but it really hid the delicate flavor of the mahi.   Also, medium high heat just burns the sugar/honey if you're not careful.  I ended up microwaving the leftover marinade for the glaze because the pan I fried the mahi in needed some therapy (that was without burning the fish).   It's a pretty decent flavor, but we live in Hawaii and are quite spoiled by a huge array of ways to eat mahi.

I had not enjoyed Mahi in the past, but thought this recipe was a good reason to try again... it was so fantastic that I now make copies of the recipe and hang them on the door to our seafood counter at our butcher shop! We are selling more mahi-mahi than ever, and everyone loves this! THANKS!

One of the best dishes I've made from this site! I followed the recipe to a tee....just made a little more sauce. It was great poured over the fried rice I made to go along with it. My husband has already asked me to make this again. Thanks :)

This was phenomenal! I didn't really follow the exact measurements for each ingredient, just looked at the list and added a splash and a dash here and there. The hubby said it was "awesome" and was sad that fish doesn't seem to keep well overnight once cooked :-( (I served this with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli/squash. It looked great on the plate and tasted even better!) Thanks so much!

I made the recipe as is, and did NOT burn it, however I think while it was good, it needs to be tweaked, the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar should be no MORE than 2 Tbsp each, I think the honey could be swapped w/ brown sugar w/ better results.  I also think the option to add more salt is crazy -the soy sauce is salty enough!

This was wonderful!  I made 2 slight changes that worked out well.  First, I cut back the honey a bit because I prefer less sweet marinades/glazes.  Second, I seared the fish in a pan then added the marinade and threw the whole thing in the oven @ 350º for 20 minutes and basted the fish twice.  The fish came out super moist and truly glazed.  This was also due to personal preference and nothing else... I find that when I marinate using soy sauce pan frying doesn't please my palate like baking does.  Served the fish over sesame ginger quinoa with green beans on the side... added more marinade over the whole thing - DELICIOUS!

I added 1 TBL mirin and a dash of wasabi powder to the marinade/glaze it tasted GREAT.  I grilled it (as per a previous review), for me that was a mistake the marinade that was on the fish never really set so when I went to put the glaze on it just slid off of the fish, but the taste was still there and it married perfectly with the rice and stir-fry I served with the fish.  I was just a bit weak on it's own hence the 4 star

Absolutely delicious for a quick weeknight dinner.  I prefer to double up the marinade, and use half for the fish, then add red pepper flakes to the 2nd half for the reduction.

This is a recipe I've memorized and pull out often to use for lots of fish, not just Mahi Mahi. Be sure to use fresh ginger! Makes all the difference. (I frequently put  slices of the root into my garlic press before mincing and squeeze the ginger juice directly into the marinade.)

this was good and i didnt think i'd like it since im kind of tired of the soy sauce fish recipes.  I did add rice vinegar for half of the soy sauce and used only one tbsp of honey and 2 cloves of garlic.  I defiently licked my plate afterward!

This recipe was amazing! I loved the sauce and I just couldn't get enough of it. This was the first time I had mahi mahi, and it turned out. I used dry powdered ginger because I didn't have fresh, and it was so good! I would definitely make this again. The fiance loved it too!

This recipe was easy and wonderful tasting. I have also tried the marinate on pork chops and it turned out great! I doubled the marinate and added corn starch over the stove for more sauce.

Amazing and SOOOOO easy! Used only 2 fillets and the marinade was just enough so would double for more portions.  I served over a bed of sticky rice with a side of zuchini and onions.  This was the best and easiest recipe I've ever used from this site :-)

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe!  The only changes I made were to add more fresh garlic and marinate the fish longer.  I then grilled on the BBQ.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!!! Even with all the great reviews, I wasn't expecting it to be THIS good!  It looked and tasted like something from a restaurant, and it was so easy and quick!  Will definately be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy - I added scallions to the sauce and also increased the quantity a little bit.  No need to measure,just guess and throw it in! Loved it.

I just made this recipe , the only thing I changed was I added 1 t groung ginger to the original recipe and I also doubled the sauce before the glazing reducing process. I baked my Mahi Mahi for 25min  started out at 375 and then turned up to 400  and was perfect, I served mine with fresh steamed broccoli green beans and white rice . I use the glaze to top fish but also on the rice. MY husband said a make again meal,and I agree. My only issue is my kids are young and wouldnt eat it, not cause they didnt like it they just wont even try it.I did get my almost 9 yr old to have some and he said it was good .Another tip is to watch out for bones, I had several in my piece from my market , they are large long white sliver type bones, easy enough to pick out and find .

I have made this twice, once in a frying pan and once on the grill.  Simply delicious!  I recommend cooking this on the grill, because it will make a MESS of your pan.  I changed it a little, I used 4 tbls of honey and only 2 tbls of the soy, it was perfect.

I doubled the ingredients for the marinade. We like to have extra sauce to put on the rice I serve eith this awesome dish. My husband loved it so much I made it for his parents and that went over so well I made it for my family when they visited! I haven't served it yet that I wasn't asked for the recipe! Very easy and you can do ahead and let it marinade all day.

I've made this twice now, without the garlic because it bothers my son's stomach.  I also marinaded it for several hours. My family loved it, with my 10 year old telling me I should make it every week, and my 15 year old skinny son who I have to encourage to eat, and is practically a vegetarian, had seconds of the fish.  I served it with Uncle Bens's Ready to Eat Brown/Wild Rice.  This is definitely a winner, I love not having leftovers!

The glaze is excellent. Try to use fresh, wild caught Mahi Mahi and fresh ginger if you can.  My wife and neighbors thought it was one of the best meals they ever had.  I served it over mashed yams and a side of fresh mango,blackberry and apricot. It's sweetness added a complimentary touch to the glazed fish.

Wow! This was fabulous. I thought I was in a fancy seafood restaurant!  I had to use powdered ginger, about a teaspoon. When I made the glaze I added 3 tablespoons of Rothschilds Apricot Mango Wasabi Sauce. I can't wait to make this one for dinner guests. Thanks for an easy yet impressive
recipe.

Fantastic!  My husband doesn't normally like fish, so, I am tying to find a recipe that he will like.  He loved this.  The reduced glaze drizzled over the top really makes the dish.  The market didn't have fresh mahi-mahi so I used salmon steaks instead.  I also broiled the fish  - about 4-5 minutes on each side (for 2 inch salmon steaks).  It was perfectly cooked and had wonderful flavor.  I do think if you opt to use a thicker cut of fish like we did you will need to marinate it longer to really have the flavor soak in.  Really Delicious.

This was a very good marinade.  I'm used to using jarred stuff, so this was a nice change of pace.  I happen to like the jarred marinades, but this was easy enough to make.  I might use again.

I added sesame seeds when reducing the sauce, and will probably use regular vinegar in the future, since balsamic isa little scarce where I live.

This was fantastic!  I made it for my mother, who generally dislikes anything but fried fish.  She rates it a 10 out of 10.  Thanks!

I thought this was ok.  Being asian american, I eat a lot of dishes with ginger & a lot of fish.  This seemed like a faux-asian or asian fusion attempt to me.

Very good and easy to prepare. I followed the recipe but dredged it in Panko crumbs. It gave the fish a crunch that really adds to the dish. Yum.

Served this dish at a dinner party and it was a hit.  Be sure to have an extra sauce pan ready since I wouldn't have wanted to turned the marinade into a glaze in the same pan as the cooking fish since it definitely left burned parts behind (even though the fish came out perfectly).

This was wonderful!  I didnt change the ingredients at all, but I grilled the fish instead of frying it in a pan and it was great.  I served it with wild rice pilaf and steamed veggies.  My entire family loved this one.  This will definatly become a regular meal in my house. Thanks for posting it!

This is a great recipe!!  So easy to put together, and tastes great too.  I used three crushed garlic cloves, and reduced the marinade in a different saucepan at the same time the fish was cooking.  Served with steamed broccoli and brown rice.

I followed the recipe as is except I used frozen mahi and canned garlic and ginger. Served with saffron rice and spinach, and it got raves. Yum! I'm eating the leftovers right now and if possible, it's even better than it was last night!

The only thing that bothered me and I don't think anyone else mentioned it was that something in the marinade made it splatter all over half my kitchen when I put the fish in the pan. I reduced the heat to medium and it took a little longer to cook, and it ended up with a nicely blackened crust that looked really cool! So all worked out well in the end, except for cleaning up the kitchen.

Next time I'll try it on the grill, and probably with salmon or pork - something less mild than mahi mahi.

This was a delicious marinade for the mahi mahi.  I, too, didn't have fresh ginger and garlic, so I substituted for dried ground ginger and minced garlic in the jar.  My husband and children loved it!  My family was ready to eat it again the next night, but of course there weren't any left over!  I look forward to trying the "original" recipe.

We love this recipe!  I agree with other posters that doubling the marinade is a must if you want sauce with your rice.  I just lay the fish over the cooked rice and pour the cooked sauce over the whole thing-Yum!  This was really good with some stir fried veggies on the side too.

This was FABULOUS! We chose to grill, rather than fry or bake. Should be marinated for 2 hours. Make a double recipe of the marinade, one to marinade and one to brush on during grilling. USE FRESH GINGER AND GARLIC!! Wow your friends with this recipe!

Loved, loved, loved this!  I used Ahi Tuna and I marinated the filets for about an hour (1/2 hour each side).  I added quite a bit of black pepper as we love it.  This was restaurant-quality fare.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Outstanding recipe, Diana!  I only used ~1 tablespoon vinegar based on reviews, but kept the rest as is.  We will try grilling it next time.  This will be a regular addition to our menu! THANKS!

Yummy!  The sauce could be used on chicken or other white fish.  I didn't have fresh ginger in the house, so I used ginger powder.  Outstanding flavor and very easy!  Will definitely make again.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I thought that the glaze was incredibly too sweet and too heavy for the fish.  You couldn't even taste the fish. The glaze would be good for chicken--but not fish.  I probably won't use this recipe again for mahi mahi.

Great marinade.  I baked the fish instead of frying it, 450 for about 10 minutes, and made the glaze in a pan.  It was great, I'll definitely make this again.  I think this would be good with tuna also.

This was pretty good. However, I covered the pan when frying the fish and 4 minutes was definitely too long for each side. The glaze turned out kind of clumpy. If I make this again, I'll turn the temperature down.

I'm NOT A SEAFOOD LOVER.  With that said, I am now sing the PRAISES of GINGER GLAZED MAHI MAHI!  It's a quick, easy recipe for those of us who don't do seafood or want to try seafood for the first time.  My husband & children love seafood & Dolphin Fish (a.k.a Mahi Mahi)is their favorite.  
I highly suggest ALL SEAFOOD FIRST TIMER'S to try this recipe.  For those "veteran" chef's & seafood lover's, add this to your recipe box!  It's a keeper!

I usually mess uo fish, and this was so easy you can't screw it up.  It was a great taste and the best fish I've had.  A good white wine and this fish you can't go wrong.

I didn't like this sauce. The vinegar made it way too vinegary and it burned in the oven deep into the dish. It also made it smell really bad. I have made this again and taken out the vinegar and just made it with honey and soy sauce and it was much better.

I cook Mahi all the time and this marinade is the show stopper!  I do use dried ginger and we grill it for about 3 minutes per side. The reduction of the sauce really makes it feel like it’s one of our wonderful Florida restaurants. The sauce is rich so I put some  on the fish and more on the side for dipping.  Outstanding!

Omg! Wow this was an easy & amazing recipe to make and eat! I used a low sodium soy sauce and used a little extra garlic as my family and I like garlic.  So glad I found this recipe and I will be putting this in our rotation of recipes to make!

Been making this for several years now. Its one of our favorites. Its 5 star in original form but i add 2 tbs of freshly squeezed orange juice and then its even better. Usually double the amount of glaze. Perfect with basmati rice. Quick and easy for company ... Guests always love it.

I did half a recipe, and cooked the mahi-mahi 4 1/2 minutes on one side, then just 3 minutes on the other.  It was perfect.

I loved this recipe. It came out so perfect.  The only thing I changed was I baked it instead of fried it. Just put it in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. Quick and easy!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Part of the reason is because I don't normally like fish, but I saw the mahi mahi was on sale and thought to give it a try. I only used 2 tbsp. of balsamic and 1 tbsp. of honey, as well as liquid aminos instead of soy sauce to make it GF. Served it with creamed spinach. Hubby and kids liked it too! Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe, although i cooked in the oven, i heated the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and put the fish in a 9x9 pyrex after 10 minutes in the oven i added half the marinade cooked for 20 minutes added the rest of the marinade and then cooked for 5 more minutes. Make sure the fish is 145 degrees Fahrenheit internal temperature

This was delicious.  We're not eating sugar, so I substituted stevia for the honey and didn't miss it.  

Also stirred fresh sliced mushrooms in the pan while the fish was cooking.  Served them over the fish and poured the glaze over all.  It was wonderful... 

Same results, second time.  This is going to come up often.  Tonight I didn't have fresh ginger and used ground.  It wasn't as good as fresh, but it worked in a pinch. 

Served Lime Cilantro Cauliflower "Rice" as a side.  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/221186/lime-cilantro-cauliflower-rice/#recipe-toolbar

Whole dinner is a keeper.

This was delicious.  I changed a couple of things...I used coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce {soy allergy}, coconut nectar instead of honey.  I cooked it in almond oil and topped it with some toasted sesame seeds.  Thanks DECODIANA!

This was a very delicious marinade. My mahi was very, very thin so I could not cook it very long and thus it did not create a glaze. So I only gave this 4 stars but will try this again later with thicker pieces to see how if it glazes well. The flavor is marvelous.

This recipe is amazingly simple and amazingly delicious!  I've made this recipe a few times now sticking to the recipe as written with the exception of substituting sesame oil for the vegetable oil - just because its in my cupboard and it needs to be used! Keep it simple, no tweaking needed. yum!!!

Perhaps the fish I bought wasn't good (From costco), but this fish was very tough and the taste barely made it through the skin. Wouldn't make again. The sauce itself was "ok".

5:00 and what's for dinner?  THis mahi mahi!  Not one bite left of this one, kids were asking for more.  All the ingredients for the marinade are staples so super easy and fast to assemble.  Only thing I did not have was the ginger root.  I used a scant 1/4 teaspoon of dried ginger for the fresh.  I also replaced the soy sauce with Bragg's Liquid Amino's, simply becasue that's what we use.  Printing this recipe off now and adding it to the family recipe box.

I actually tried the sauce on a salmon filet and it's excellent on it! I think it would taste great on chicken; marinating it for a short while. I love the sauce and will make a batch of it to have on hand.

Other than using dried ginger instead of fresh (same measurement), I made this exactly to recipe and we were blown away.  LOVED it!!!  Served with plain couscous and Kashmir Spinach.  Bonus: it made my whole house smell lovely!

Yum! We substituted the fish to ling ling, as mahi mahi is not easy to get here. Ling ling has a similar texture, so it worked well.

Great recipe, especially for a gingerphile.  I tripled the fresh ginger, and doubled the glaze.  I let it sit for two hours...i have used this recipe substituting the mahi with boneless pork chops, and chicken breast.  Equally delicious.  Great matched up with rice and fresh asparagus.

Fish cooks Perfectly in  oven 20 minutes covered at 400...I needed to reduce my sauce more which is my fault...It was just OK but I think it could be Great.  Gonna try again.

My wife was getting tired of fish, so we were looking for a new recipe. This was fantastic. It sort of had a hibachi grill taste and it wasn't hard to make. We will absolutely be having this again.

I made my sauce with all the freshness as suggested, added fresh orange squeezes and kept a few slices for garnish.  Made a coconut infused rice and a baby green salad for sides. I used some sauce on my Mahi filets in the pan and some on a chicken breast on the grill. Both were delicious! However...i think being a mile high the temp and time was too much, the Mahi was a bit dry. Next time I think lower heat will work better.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe because the sauce didn't turn out like I expected it to. There are better recipes for Mahi Mahi here, but also on different sites. Since I have all the ingredients I may make this in the future, and my the sauce will turn out better & I can rank it higher.

This is an outstanding recipe, the mahi mahi came out  wonderfully flavored, and the glaze was delicious. The only change I made here was to double all the marinade ingredients; I had eight pieces of fish. Having done this, however, I would probably make that much even for a smaller amount of fish, as the amount of finished sauce was appreciated. My wife even put the sauce (by accident, she was distracted) on some steamed green peas we were having,  and decided the result was awesome.

I would not make this again.  In my opinion this type of fish might be to thick or meaty for this recipe.  Not a fan.

I followed the ingredients part of this recipe exactly, but baked it instead of frying.  I looked at a lot of reviews that spoke of baking so followed them. I baked at 400 for 17 minutes.  That part was perfect.  In my opinion and my husbands, there was nothing that exciting about the taste.  Two things that were directly related to our problems: 1) my husband can't stop thinking about macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi, and I am not a fan of Mahi Mahi in general. That may have spoiled a more positive review. One other point, it was salty and I used low sodium soy sauce.

I used agave syrup instead if honey (lower glycemic), Bragg's Soya seasoning (less sodium), and doubled the fresh ground ginger. Lightly grilled on tinfoil on the BBQ. This recipe is a keeper.

I would definitely watch carefully if you choose to pan fry in the vegetable oil, the temp was too high on my stove, but I realize it could be the stove.  I think I'll try again, but bake per another user's review.  Also, I'd recommend using half of the amount of the olive oil specified. It didn't emulsify well for me and I actually removed some while it was heating.  The flavor is fantastic and I'll definitely give this another shot.  I didn't have a garlic clove and am not too crazy about garlic, so I used a little garlic powder and extra fresh grated ginger.

It was totally awesome.  I tripled the sauce recipe because I had very thick filets and more than 4 pieces.  It came out so good and my boyfriend loved it too.  So easy to make, definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

the glaze was too heavy/strong for my taste. I think my two filets were more like 4 oz, and I overcooked them, then carried the "burnt" flavor into the glaze. Will try again. My daughter, who doesn't like fish usually, liked this. Said it tasted like chicken. For that reason alone, it's a keeper! :>  Hubby and I like our fish a little more delicate.

I think the marinade would be perfect for salmon.  Served with brown rice & broccoli.

This is truly a wonderful way to prepare this fish. I chose to bake mine to make it healthier (350 degrees for about 10 minutes) The only ingredient I question is the olive oil added to the marinade. I think next time I prepare it, I will not add it and see how it turns out.

I would refrain from seasoning with salt as the soy sauce will provide ample itself. Otherwise, delicious.

I grilled frozen salmon and used this as glaze.  So yummy, so easy.

YUMMY is the one word for this recipe. I have to admit I added a little hot sauce, but that's because we like spice. Side dish was sautéed sugar snaps, sweet peppers, mushrooms, and shallots. Double Yum!

My family and I really enjoyed this meal. I never follow the recipe, if I know things can be improved I can't help myself, so I added 1/4 cup of dry wine(chardonnay or pinot grigio, be creative even a nice sherry.) Now, his did water down the marinade, so when it was time to prepare the glaze, I just added another tablespoon of honey to the marinade to help thicken it and sweeten it. I had very thick Mahi Mahi fillets so after I fried them , I finished them off in the oven on 400 degrees for 7 to 10 minutes. Note, I served them with homemade yellow rice (1/4 teaspoon of turmeric to a cup of dry rice in a bit of hot oil before adding water) and crispy garlic asparagus. I was quite pleased with myself, but my husband and my son made me feel like a master chef! I almost took a bow from the applause I got!

The ginger glaze is amazing over the Mahi Mahi.  I doubled the recipe for the glaze and it was a big hit.  I actually used this same glaze over salmon and it was even better than the Mahi Mahi (which doesn't have much flavor to begin with).

This is wonderful.  I add fresh pineapple to the marinade and cook it along with the fish.  I've made it several times and it's also great with salmon.  I don't use any vegetable oil to fry the fish...there is enough olive oil in the marinade to keep the fish from sticking.

soooo good! We love fish and mahi mahi is one of my favorites. We are always looking for new and greats seafood recipes as we eat it so often. We typically grill or bake Mahi Mahi so I wasn't expecting this recipe to be that great, the marinade seemed like it would be too mild....however the key is cooking the marinade down until it is very thick almost syrup and wow bold yet smooth flavor we used ground ginger and minced garlic for stronger flavor  and served with rice whice was awesome to soak up extra marinade!

My family really loves this recipe. We have tried it over and over. Sometimes changing the honey and using agave nectar, but either way it's a family favorite. My 8 yr old daughter even loves it. She request it from time to time. 5 stars!!!!

the sauce was great very flavorful. unfortunately the mahi mahi i had was prepackaged frozen and was not a good batch. but i feel the sauce would be great on a better batch of fish and was also easy to make.. i might try it on some salmon.

Believe it or not, but this was my first fish cooking adventure and it was absolutely delicious!  Ginger, garlic and honey are 3 of my favorite ingredients so I was immediately drawn to this recipe. My husband rated it restaurant quality and we both ate every last bite. I used some of the honey, ginger and garlic as a glaze for roasted carrots and also made cranberry and almond couscous. I may get creative with the ingredients next time and add some orange zest. The recipe was simple and fast and I can't wait to eat it again!

We don't eat a lot of fish because there are few recipes out there that are good.  THIS ONE IS TERRIFIC!  I substituted brown sugar for the honey and red wine vinegar instead is the basalmic plus I put in a touch of lime juice, and served it over rice.  Delicious!

I liked the idea, and the flavor was pretty good.  It is really easy to burn to the pan though, so watch out!  Probably a lesser cooking time would be the trick, as burning also meant overcooking.

Just made this for dinner tonight! Omitted the salt and omitted the oil from the marinade. I added a little extra ginger and a little Thai chili sauce, after reading the suggestion in other reviews. I also used salmon instead of mahi mahi and baked it for about 15 minutes at 400. We like our salmon medium rare. It was absolutely delicious!

After reading negative reviews, was a little concerned about making this, but it turned out amazing.  And it was so perfect because those of us who wanted to enjoy the yummy taste of the mahi mahi passed on the glaze, and those a little more squeamish on fish were well served by the glaze.  We did, however, omit the balsamic vinegar all together because our kids don't care for too much tang.  (upped the soy a bit for more volume and a better balance for our taste) Delicious!  And perfect with roasted asparagus!

This was a nice change from typical salmon recipes.   The flavors were well balanced and cooked down nicely to a syrupy glaze.   I didn't make any changes.

I used this glaze on salmon I was serving: LOVED IT.  (I was out of balsamic vinegar, and substituted malted vinegar -- which is something I love on fish anyways.)  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious!! I had never made mahi mahi before but picked up some frozen fish at Trader Joe's and looked for a recipe with good reviews. So glad I used this one! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder and the flavor of the fish/glaze was sooo good! The hubby raved about this one so i know it's a good one :)

I made this last night, and it was the best mahi mahi I've ever had. Used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, versus chopped garlic (because I don't care for bits of garlic in my food), and after marinating baked the fish on nonstick foil in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. It came out perfect. Flaky. Moist. Sweet and savory all at once. Served it with a side of veggies for a low carb, healthy meal. Loved it. Will make again!

This will replace my standard teriyaki glaze! The balsamic vinegar makes the dish - EXCELLENT!

Wonderful marinade for the fish and the glaze came out perfect! The only addition I made to the marinade was adding a little bit of crushed red pepper, which was a last minute decision as I felt like adding a little bit of a kick.  I served the fish with sauteed zucchini and brown rice.

Great dish.  I served with room temperature Udon noodles, using the sauce to flavor them too.  I also added Japanese spicy chili pepper, which gave this dish another element.  Served with Chardonnay!

This gets five stars in my book, because it's simple and very tasty and oddly enough I had everything in my kitchen. The sauce was exactly as described, sweet and sour.

My 3 little kids and husband are a little hesitant about fish but everyone loved this dish :)  I made it just as the recipe described and served the fish over steamed veggies with some more glaze on top.  Yum.  Saved and will definitely make again.

This fish was super. I had to use tilapia because that's all I had on hand, but the glaze made even that taste fancy. My only disappointment was that I didn't have a ton of glaze left over after marinating the fish - next time I think I will double the glaze recipe so I have plenty left over for sauce. Served this over egg noodles and it was a big hit with my husband! :)

This recipe is easy and delicious. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I substituted with ground ginger. Not knowing what the original recipe tastes like, I thought this was still very good. I cooked some brown rice and edamame and served it all with extra soy sauce. Perfect for a busy weeknight!

Unbelievably delicious! Now, I'm not much of a cook, but this was an incredibly easy recipe to make. I used a tiny bit less balsamic vinegar (not a fan) and a bit more ginger (def a fan) and the Mahi-Mahi was bursting with flavor.

My only problem was that, even following the directions perfectly, the fish burned (sort of) within two minutes, and so did the glaze. My sister says it was the honey. However, it didn't TASTE burnt, it just looked kind of gross. It tasted like heaven. This is my new favorite dish!

Very good! Will definitely make again. I also grilled the mahi mahi on top of the stove, and just reduced the marinade in a sauce pan. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1/2 tsp. as others suggested. Served the mahi mahi over fresh baby spinach, and let the heat from the fish wilt the greens, and poured the sauce right over the top. The sauce is very sweet, so make sure to have a large side to soak it all up (rice, lots of veggies, etc). Also served with side of grilled zucchini in sesame oil, sesame seeds, and soy sauce.

This was so delicious!  We got fresh Mahi Mahi from Whole Foods and cooked it for 5 minutes on both sides and it was very juicy and tender.  Make sure to watch the timing.  Over cooking fish will make it really dry.  It had skin on one side, but when we ate it the meat easily separated from it.  The marinade was a great balance of sweet, sour, and savory.  I really like ginger so I added extra.

I am not a fish lover at all, but I made this tonight to placate my husbands love of seafood. I doubled the sauce,except for the honey(4T instead) because I was afraid it would be too sweet. I also baked instead of pan frying the fish. I set the oven to 365 and cooked the fish for ten minutes. I felt like it wasn't cooking fast enough so I turned up the heat to 400 and cooked for another 8 minutes. It came out flakey and tender.I tried to thicken the sauce, which I removed before baking the fish, with corn starch but it never quite thickened the way I thought it would, but it was still very delicious. I served it with broccoli and rice. I felt the sauce had a strong enough flavor to hide the fishiness of the mahi mahi, which was a HUGE plus for me.

Made this tonight, used apple cider vinegar instead and baked 10 minutes each side.  It was decedant and my husband said seemed like he was eating a 5 star resturant meal!  Yeah - FYI very easy to make and this comes from a girl who doesn't cook much!

Delicious sauce!Tthis is a keeper. My kids dislike fish very much and I always try to find ways to make it to where they will eat it cause I love it. This recipe was the trick! I had Ahi fillets (not Mahi) and it was amazing. I think the sauce would work with any fish or poultry.

LOVED this dish!  I would have actually added a little more ginger other marinade because I found the sauce a touch sweet but that is my personal preference.  Made this for dinner for non-salmon lovers and it was a huge hit!

Yet another new favourite recipe!!! I made this with basa and it was amazing! I baked it in the oven at 400F and it turned out perfect. A few days later, I doubled the sauce, marinated chicken in it and made it into stir-fry. Still delicious, but it didn't thicken as I had hoped. Tonight I made it as a glaze on chicken, baked it in the oven at 350F but overcooked it! It tasted like disappointment! So, don't double, and watch you don't overcook it!

I'm a chef on a charter boat and have had guests say on a few occasions that this is the best fish they've ever had.  Can't argue with that!  And it's easy to prepare.  I make more marinade as it's so good over rice.

I found that the fish marinade burned to the bottom of the pan and the flavor wasn't great.

Won't be making it again.

Deeeeeelicious!  A real tummy pleaser in our house!  Did everything as written, but added some Sirrachi Garlic Sauce into marinade/glaze.  Nom to the Nom!  Make this tonight!  :^)

OK, I hate fish.  Well, I used to hate all fish (with the exception of tuna salad) until this recipe.  It's really that good.  Thank you so much for sharing.

My family liked the marinade but not the fish. This glaze would be great on chicken. My mahi mahi looked exactly like the recipe picture. I used 1/4 tsp dried ginger in place of fresh.

This was a big hit for Sunday family dinner. I seasoned the fish with salt, black pepper, paprika etc like I normally do, then added the glaze. Anything that was left over I made a reduction and drizzled it on top. Wonderful.... hubby wants it again this week...

Our family isn't big on fish and I've actually never made anything more than something with canned tuna as far as fish goes but wanted to try something new.  This recipe caught my eye and it turned out great.  We all liked it and would eat it again.  Actually I think the kids liked it more than I did, which is awesome as they seem to be harder to please.

I loved the flavors of the marinade but thought it was a bit powerful for the mahi mahi.  Next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce to cut back on the saltiness and also pair it with wild salmon which has a much more robust flavor that I think would taste fantastic with this sauce.  Thanks for the recipe, will make it again.

This was really good.  I did make a few changes but ONLY because I threw this together at the last minute.  I did not have fresh garlic or ginger root so I used garlic powder and ground ginger.  Still an excellent recipe.  Also, I never fry my food so I used the grill.  I did notice it wanted to burn but my mahi mahi filets were really thick so they took longer to cook.  You could use any mild fish like cod or tilapi too.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of doubling the recipes and adding a little more grated ginger to the marinade.  Marinated the Mahi Mahi for a half hour in the fridge.  Also Heated up a huge frying pan until it was very hot - sprayed on the pam and threw in the mahi mahi.   Heated the mahi 6 minutes each side.  I removed the skin.  It was so easy to remove like butter.  The beautiful Mahi Mahi was ready for serving with brown rice and steamed veggies.  Yumm.

Super delicious!  I'd never prepared Mahi Mahi before and found this recipe both simple and yummy.  My 6 yr old, who typically scoffs at fish, even ate half a fillet.  I reduced the cooking time a bit to keep the glaze from crisping too much, and it came out perfect!  Went very well with cilantro rice.  Will definitely be making again!

This was pretty good, I was looking for a different recipe to try & it was good. Although I'm not a huge fan of ginger (I know so why try this recipe when the name says it all lol!) But I thought the rest of the sauce would overpower it for me. But that's my personal preference.

The glaze is far too overpowering for any fish. It would probably work well for chicken, just not fish. Good flavor in general, but definitely the wrong protein with which to pair it.

I made this last week and just now got around to reviewing it. I tried this first with mahi mahi, and it was good but our mahi was not. So the next night I tried it on salmon and that was a hit. I might even try this on chicken breast....Very good recipe.

VERY good glaze.  I would prefer it with Seabass but didn't want to take stars away for personal taste preference as far as the fish.  I will use this recipe again, very very easy.

Great dish. I replaced the honey with maple syrup and added green onions. Served it with quinoa (1 C quinoa, half cube veggie stock, green onions and lemon) and asparagus. Will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed the spices and the glaze ...but Mahi Mahi was a little too strong in the fishy taste catagory. Next time I will use a milder white fish.

Absolutely fantastic recipe!!! Also tried it on boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was great. Marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 2 hours in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator and cooked it on the grill. Only addition was a little crushed red pepper added to the marinade because I love spice. It came out wonderful!!!

Great recipe!  My daughter asked, "Is this fish teriyaki?"  I made a couple of subs--agave nectar for the honey and coconut "non-soy" sauce.  It was really delicious.  A good piece of fish really helps!  I did have some trouble with cooking the fish evenly.  May have to try baking it.  But this is definitely a keeper.

Good sauce. Baked this fish but next time will try on the stove as the recipe suggested, and I think I overcooked it a little.

Did everything per instructions in original recipe. This has an amazing glaze and the Mahi was awesome. Served on a bed of basmati rice with cilantro and chopped red peppers in it for color. Side green was Italian green beans. Awesome presentation. I did double the recipe for the glaze, because it was smelling so good while the fish was marinating. YUM!

Excellent dish!! We used to low sodium soy sauce and it was still a little too salty for our tastes but overall AMAZING! I'd make extra sauce on the side because it's delicious. Will use with chicken next time

My husband--anti-fish man, as I like to call him--LOVED this. I did overcook his mahi, so its texture was more chicken-like, but I cooked mine perfectly and this was a DELICIOUS dish. DH actually asked for it again!

Delicious! I used a zip-loc bag to mix the marinade and hold the fish. I also did one bag with pounded chicken breast for the kids. I added 3T. of Trop50 OJ for sweetness. Cooked them both on my new panini/griller and they came out perfect. Husband and picky kids enjoyed. Thank you.

Excellent!  Made exactly as indicated - easy and tasty.  Next time I may spice it up a bit by adding some red chili flakes to the marinade, or dice a jalapeno or serano  for some zip.

Excellent recipe! The flavors in the glaze are wonderful and taste great on rice too. I will definitely make this again. Be sure to use real ginger, it is so much better than ground. Lite soy sauce can be substituted for regular and still tastes great.

Great recipe, and really easy once you've done it once.  As other reviewers have noted, even if you're only doing 2 fillets, you'll want to make the full amount of marinade so that you're sure to have enough glaze.  We sprinkled some sesame seeds on the fish after glazing it and served it over basmati rice.  My partner said it was some of the best fish he'd ever had.

Good recipe, flavorful but not overpowering.  A thick steak of mahi mahi needs to be cooked a few minutes longer than suggested.

I made this recipe as it, except I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground. This is a delicious, easy meal!

This was ok but nothing special. It could use some brown sugar for a sweeter taste that I feel would enhance this fish in a better way.

Wow - you will not be dissappointed with this one. It would cost a fortune to eat out and you will look like a "fine chef" when you pull this off the grill. Wonderful - we make this at least once a month.

This was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe, except used olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  I used Costco frozen mahi mahi.

Update November 15, 2010:  Looks like they might have changed the recipe to use olive oil.  I'm making it for the second time and I'm wondering if anyone has any other suggestions for what to serve this with. Last time, I used plain white rice.  Tonight, I'm using brown rice with a bit of crushed red chile peppers.  I have no idea what that will be like.

This recipe was terrific!  I always have a bag of mahi mahi on hand from Sams Club or Costco and was looking for something new to do with it.  My extremely picky 4 year-old ate it (minus the glaze).  It tasted like a restaurant entree.

My kids (ages 4,6,and 7) actually request this fish dish.  It's easy enough to make, using frozen (thawed) mahi mahi from Costco.  I like it best with fresh ginger, rather than ground ginger, but the ground ginger works in a pinch.  Be sure to boil the leftover marinade as sauce to put on the fish or on rice; that's the best part.

Great fish recipe.  We grilled it on the BBQ and it was absolutely delicious.  We used salmon and it was great.  I think you can use this recipe with any firm fish.

DELICIOUS!  Some of the best fish I've ever eaten and super easy.  I grilled it on the bbq about 4 min a side and today had a piece for lunch, cooked for 4 min in the george forman.  Even my 2 yr old likes it.  Don't substitute fresh ginger.  It's kind of a pain to grate it but it's wonderful!

The sauce is fantastic.  My partner and I love cooking together and he does the grilling and we do the prep work together. He does not like vinegar - but this recipe please him very much. We are planning on using the glaze on Tilapia,chicken (maybe adding some hot pepper flakes) wings..  A dipping sauce perhaps!  Very very very good

This was quite delicious and because I'm breastfeeding I checked to see if Mahi Mahi has high levels of mercury.  It has "moderate" levels so I looked up fish that are similar to Mahi Mahi that have low levels of mercury and found:  tilapia, flounder and white fish.  I used tilapia and it turned out beautifully.  My husband doesn't like a lot of sauce on things so I didn't pour the reduced sauce over his after it was cooked and it was still really nice.  Just a note: be careful not to reduce the sauce for too long or it gets gummy in texture.

Wonderful, easy dish. It is a family favorite. My 10 year old daughter requested this for her birthday family dinner and all 16 people, young and old raved about the subtle yet sweet flavor. I suggest to always use fresh ginger. This is by far the best Mahi Mahi dish to make at home.

This was EXCELLENT! And so simple and quick to make! I made it with 2 files of talapia, which i cut in half for 4 total pieces. I used 1/3 of each liquid ingredient (so only 1 tablespoon vs the listed quantity). I did not have fresh ginger so used tsp powdered ginger and I used the entire clove of garlic.  It was AWESOME. Very flavorful. Will definitely be making this again and again! I think using real ginger will make it better.

We liked this, but I think it needs to marinate longer. Without the reduced sauce on it. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  Served it with some sauteed snow peas. Yum.

Simple, yet delectable.  A new weeknight favorite of ours.  Cook on a high heat until the fish begins to flake.

OMG!  Perfection!  I got gourmet reviews from the family!  I grilled mine after adding a splash of liquid smoke to the marinade.  Saved the extra marinade and simmered while grilling the fish, it made a great sauce to pour over the grilled fish!  Served with White cheddar noodles and Veggie.  This quick and simple dish just became a staple in our weekly dinners!

Made this when a son-in-law and grandson were visiting, and we all loved it. I just E-mailed the recipe to my daughter, who said she "had to have it." I used powdered ginger and garlic powder, as I didn't have the others on hand. It marinated for at least 2 hours, and my husband added shrimp to the marinade; we grilled it all with oiled & seasoned veggies. It was wonderful, and we'll use again and again.

Very yummy...did ours on the BBQ as hubby prefers to cook that way if he is around and even better that it was the weekend and a beautiful day!  I will definitely have to try in the oven too...I don't do the 'pan fry' thing very much!  Great flavour!

I loved this recipe but I am a huge fan of ginger... My family didn't care for it and we had lots of leftovers, which just doesn't usually happen with 10 of us! Most people thought the ginger flavor was just too strong and overpowered the fish.

I guess I have odd taste buds, but I thought the marinade was VERY overpowering.  I didn't even pour the glaze over the fish after cooking (I baked it).  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used less honey.  Honestly, I couldn't taste the fish, only the marinade.  I won't use this recipe again.

I didn't care for this. The "glaze" was more like tar. I will definitely not make this again. It was a waste of perfectly good mahi.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I thought the sauce was a bit much for the mahi mahi and kind of overpowered it.  I did like the ease of the prep but likely would not make it again.

Excellent as described. Goes really well with a simple summer salad of spinach, mushroom, strawberries, gorgonzola cheese and the marinade/glaze is an excellent dressing.

I loved this sauce on the Mahi Mahi. Quite delicious, my teenage son and his friend also enjoyed. The only one that didn't care for it was my husband, he felt it was too sweet (what does he know LOL). I will be making this again.

Yummy marinate. We did not love the Mahi Mahi, but this marinate is good for any fish or even chicken. You can change the ginger to any other flavor you want, but this is the best base marinate recipe I have found. So much cheaper and healthier than the bottled marinades.

I just made this for dinner. I see why other reviews said people enjoyed this fish even though they don't like fish, the flavor of the marinade overpowers the fish! The glaze is great though. I would skip the step of marinating the fish maybe broil or grill the fish with a little olive oil and  put the simmered down glaze over the cooked fish. I would have to give the glaze a 4 star rating.

I'm not a fish lover, but my husband loves fish, so I was trying to find some thing that I would enjoy as well. This recipe was it, I really loved it, I actually ate the left overs the next day and they were yummy. I didn't change a thing. It came out perfect!

Over the top Fantastic! Caught 4 Mahi Mahi this afternoon in the Caribbean and captain filleted them at the dock. Can't get any fresher. Never made a glaze before. Used the 1/2 tsp ground ginger and grilled in foil tray for 8 minutes as others have done. Served with couscous with a little glaze folded in. Absolutely Awesome.

Took another users advice and doubled sauce. Also allowed the fish to marinate in glass casserole dish, let it sit in the fridge 20 mins, then put the casserole dish in the over and baked it for 20 mins at 400.

I couldn't find mahi mahi, so I just used frozen tilapia fillets that I had on hand. Very good flavor. The ginger is noticable but not overwhelming, giving it a nice fresh taste.

I have been using recipes from the Internet for years, and this is the first time I've rated one.  This is perfect for those who want a simple, elegant meal.  The glaze is amazing - I was out of Balsamic Vinegar and used Red Wine Vinegar instead and I can't imagine it tasting any better.  Thank you for sharing this, it will be one of my stock recipes.

This was our first experience with Mahi Mahi that was successful.  It was delicious and came together very easily.  We would highly recommend it to anyone.  The leftovers also reheated very well.  A delicious sauce that would go well with most anything and give a nice asian flavor.

This was amazing!  I didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar.  I also added fresh mushrooms and corn to the sauce, it was delicious!!!  Will def. make again soon!

This recipe is simple yet has a 5-star restaurant taste!  It is also perfect for boneless skinless chicken breasts, pork chops.....

I'm always afraid of trying new fish, but this was great.  I had to use dried ginger root, but otherwisw followed recipe exactly.

This was incredible! I bought frozen mahi mahi and marinated the fish for 2 hours prior to cooking. The only change I will make next time is to use only 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for personal preference. I doubled the amount of marinade and began reducing the marinade prior to cooking the fish on the skillet since others said it took some time. It worked out perfectly and the marinade was reduced to a glaze consistency right as the fish was done cooking! The fish turned out flakey, moist, and perfectly flavorful. I'm going to try this same marinade with salmon tonight!

The only modification to this recipe was 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar instead of 3.  The sauce reminded me of a rib or chicken wing sauce.  Very good, very different.

Made recipe with tilapia and it was very nice.  You could probably just cook all of the sauce together when frying the fish to save time.  Quite nice.

Very good dish.  I changed a few things, by adding 2 tablespoons of Sake, and substituting sesame oil for both the olive oil and the vegetable oil.  Has a very nice flavor to it, very easy to make.

easy + delicious! my boyfriend and i loved it. the only thing I did differently is let the fish marinate over-night....so the flavor may have been more intense then if I had marinated for only 20 minutes. Next time I make this, I'll probably marinate for a few hours.

Not my favorite recipe--the vinegar taste was too strong and I could barely taste the ginger, though I followed the recipe exactly (though I baked the fillets instead of grilled them). I might try this recipe again without the vinegar and with doubling the amount of ginger. Might also add a smidge of orange juice since I'm taking out the vinegar.

I just happened to catch a sale on Mahi Mahi so thought I'd try this recipe on for size.  Quick and easy to prepare.  I substituted Ginger Paste for the fresh Ginger root, though...came out FABULOUS! Thanks!

This was a great dish! I only made 2 pieces but still used the whole recipe for the marinade so I had plenty of sauce. I didn't have fresh ginger so used 1/2 t. powdered. My husband really loved this, will be making again for sure! Served it with roasted red potatoes and a salad.

Exellent!  I marinated for about 1 hr before grilling - I followed the recipe with the exception of grilling (instead of pan frying).  Each bite was bursting with flavor.  Served with vegetable couscous with the reduced marinate drizzled over the top.  Highly recommended!

Really great recipe, but a tad heavy on the soy sauce/salt flavor.  When I made it a second time, I reduced the soy sauce and the balsamic vinegar, but kept everything else relatively the same.  It turned out AMAZING.  I definitely recommend this.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I'm not a huge seafood fan and I had to make alterations to the original recipe.

five stars because it's healthy and my son and husband liked it. I thought it needed a little more flavor. I would double the sauce!

I am an avid fish lover and this was my first experience with mahi mahi. The fish was very strong and unappealing in taste and odor. The sauce for whatever reason did not reduce in 20 minutes, so I added cornstarch with a small amount of water to thicken the sauce. The sauce was extremely salty.  I will not try this recipe again.

This is such an awesome recipe!!! I am a personal chef and my clients are loving this Mahi Mahi! It adds a bit of gourmet that everyone loves! The only thing I changed was to use extra virgin olive oil instead of the veg. oil.....give it a try!

Absolutely delicious!  this was my first attempt at Mahi Mahi and everyone loved it, even my 2 toddlers.  Used dried ginger since I didn't have fresh on hand.  Making again tonight.  Goes well with green beans and wild rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have made this a few times.  The only difference I made was I used ground ginger and garlic powder, in place of the fresh.  The first time I made this, when I came to step 3, I think I overdid the "glaze" and it had a burnt taste to it, but I've learned from that mistake and it is always delicious now!

Quite good! This is a great marinade that flavors the fish in a short amount of time. I'm impressed that I was able to arrive home from the grocery store with a kind of fish I'd never cooked before and within an hour I had dinner on the table. This recipe is easily done with ingredients that I had on hand. The only thing I did differently was use dried ginger and cook the fish on the grill. It was great!

Excellent!  The only thing I added was 1 tsp of sesame oil and decreased the soy sauce by 1/2 Tbls.  I also baked my Mahi Mahi instead of frying.  I reduced the remaining marinade and it made a beautiful glaze.  This will become a regular on our dinner table.

The sauce makes a great egg fu yung sauce, too! We made ours with shrimp, green onion and jalapano and the sauce matched with it seamlessly. The sauce is definitely what makes this recipe great. We have found our gold standard for mahi mahi.

I was not quite sure what to think when I first tried this recipe as it is pretty different from what I usually cook.  Four bites in and I was impressed, ten bites in and I was in love.  I couldn't get enough of the sauce, and will definitely make this again. With as easy as it was to prepare it is something you could make often.  Served this with snow peas and water chestnuts sauteed in sesame oil as a side dish.  Supergood, and healthy to boot!

This recipe is great!!  My husband constantly has advice on the dishes I make, as he is a better cook than me.  And for this one, he says he wouldn't change anything!  I followed the recipe for the glaze (cut down for 2 people) and cooked the mahi less than 2 minutes on the flesh side and then left it on the skin side until the fillet began to flake on it's own.  Delish!

This was the best!!! I drizzled the remaining sauce over rice and my husband just raved about it. My three year old asked for more fish 3 times. I will always make my mahi mahi like this.

Today was my first time making Mahi at home, and this recipe was super. Delicious, reasonably quick, easy. My husband, who is a fairly recent fish-convert and decided non-foodie, pronounced it "delightful"--unheard of high praise!

Lovely.  I made it with Mahi Mahi and added Panko.  After it marinated I draped the fish in the Panko, then used a very hot skillet to cook.  Four minutes on each side was perfect.

Amazing! I used catfish (because it was on sale) and it was great!  I baked the fish for 20 minutes at 400 degrees instead of frying it.

This is a excellent recipe. Being a garlic lover I added two cloves of minced garlic instead of one. I did add onion sliced when I make my glaze, oh so good it was over this Mahi Mahi recipe. I will use this marinade on other fish in the near future. We loved it.

This was excellent.  Rather than pan sear the whole fish, I only seared the skin and then stuck it under the broiler for about 8 minutes. It is so much easier in my opinion to gauge when it is done that way.  I thought the glaze was really fantastic.  For my tastes, I would probably add about another 1/2 tsp of ginger, but my girlfriend who doesn't like ginger thought it was perfect.  Next time I think I will add a little Sriracha chili sauce to spice it up a bit.  I also agree that this would go really well with pork and I will be trying it soon.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I didn't make any changes to it at all and it came out perfectly.  The sauce has just the right amount of sweetness and not too much garlic/ginger. Will definitely be adding this to my everyday recipes and can't wait to try it with some other kinds of fish!

This was pretty good. It was actually our first time having mahi-mahi so I was searching for a good starter recipe. I think the marinade would also be good on chicken or other kinds of fish.

Very nice. I didn't want to use all 3T balsamic vinegar, so I used 1T balsamic and 2T rice wine vinegar, which I thought created a nice balance.  I'd love to try this with another type of fish.  The ginger glaze/sauce was great.

This recipe worked well, and my boyfriend liked it... I just don't like these intense, savory flavors with the delicate mahi mahi...  I think I'd prefer this method with salmon or some other strong-flavored fish.

I don't like the texture of the fish- it is a little rubbery. Perhaps if I make this in the oven next time. Also, this dish really needs the sauce to make it good.

I can't believe how long it's taken me to rate this recipe! I've been using this since the summer time and on EVERYTHING! Not just Mahi Mahi, but chicken, shrimp, and the best meal of my live was using this glaze on a Chilian Sea Bass. This marinade is perfect the way it is, and one of the few that I've come across on here that I haven't changed a thing!

Excellent!  Easy, healthy, and yummy.  Like other reviewers suggested, I baked my fish.  I also used about 1 T fresh ginger, only 2 T balsamic (the stuff I have on hand is really expensive), brown sugar instead of honey (I was out of honey), and no oil.  After the fish was done, I emptied the sauce into a pan and reduced it.  We served it over rice and a veggie medley.  Next time, I'll *definitely* double the sauce.  It was so, so good.

We loved this one!  It my first experience with Mahi Mahi and I have to say I was really scared making it for my husband who LOVES it.  Everyone in our family thought it was fantastic.  My husband asked if tomorrow was too soon to have it again... and there were no left overs!  We used the mahi mahi from the Kroger fish department

The recipe is AWESOME! I stuck to the recipe but grilled the fish instead of frying.  Mahi Mahi is a wonderfully tasteful white fish and is my absolute favorite so I was delighted to try this recipe. Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will be using it on a regular basis!

Very nice flavor. I broiled it on a foil lined pan instead of pan frying it. I put the glaze in a large Pyrex measuring cup (it bubbles up) and microwaved it for 3 minutes to boil it down and then drizzled some on the cooked fish and the rice I served with it. Very tasty.

I normally won't rate any recipe that I haven't followed to the letter, but the only thing I changed was the type of fish. Mahi was not available and swordfish was on sale, so I made it with that, not changing anything else.
I loved this! It was easy and oh so good! My husband really thought this was fantastic. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe turned out delicious! I only made one substitute and that was because I did not have balsamic vinegar. I replaced the balsamic vinegar with 2tbsp red wine and 1 tbsp vinegar. My husband and I loved this dish!

Yum! We are not "fish people," which made this recipe perfect! The marinade was so great that we forgot we were eating fish. I followed everything except I used rice vinegar and ground ginger. We will definitely be having this one for dinner again soon! Thanks!

Great combination of flavors. I agree with others reviewers that this can also be used to marinate chicken, shrimp and even salmon. I used fresh Mahi Mahi and grilled it.

Great recipe. I used the ginger you get with sushi since I always have that on hand for other recipes I make. I marinated it for a little over 24 hours (which was perfect I would even let it go for 2 days) then we grilled it. Very good the hubby and kids ate it up.

We grilled instead of frying and it was outstanding. The marinade is delicious -- definitely reserve some to make a glaze. It makes the meal.

The flavor was great but our fish had a fishy taste.  Not the fault of the recipe.  Our only available fish was frozen Mahi Mahi.  We will try this but with pork chops instead of fish.  The glaze is very good and tasty.  Sweet and soy tangy.

My first time cooking fish and my bf was nervous (as was I) but I picked a winner. The marinade was delicious. I used salmon and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes. This is going into the rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! This was SOOO good! I had to use powdered ginger,(about 1/2 teaspoon), because thats all I had. I was out of olive oil so I substituted peanut oil. I was afraid it would overwhelm the flavors but we LOVED it. (I didn't use it for the final fry though, I thought that WOULD be too much.) Hubby had the Mahi-Mahi, but I had salmon prepared the same way. Excellent! I will make this again, next time with the olive oil, to check it out as written. Thank you for this recipe!

Mahi mahi is not my favorite type of fish, but I will still give this 5 stars because the glaze is so good! Next time I will try it on tuna or tilapia.

This dish is excellent!! I usually make it with tilapia, so it only requires two minutes of cooking the fish on each side (the filets are thinner). Also, I usually double up on the amount of glaze so that we can have extra to put on rice and vegetables.

It was sweet and spicy, but not enough of either.  I'll make it again, but will increase the ingredients and use a different fish.  That fishy taste is just too strong for me.

MY husband loved it - I thought the sauce was a little overpowering.  Overall a hit though.

This recipe was unbelievably good!!  I've never made Mahi Mahi before but I will surely make it again.  I had to use powdered ginger, as it was all I had on hand, but it worked fine.  My family, including my 6 year old, loved it! We served it with brown rice pilaf and steamed broccoli!

This is a great tasting easy recipe. I used a ziplock bag to marinate, as I do all my marinades. The only thing I will change next time is use low sodium soy sauce and will not salt the fish. I thought it was too salty and took away from the other flavors. I will also try this with salmon.

I made this over the weekend and it was so easy and very tasty! I'm not a big fish person, but I've been trying more fish dishes and this was a winner! Hubby devoured it and wanted more! Served w/ coconut rice and green salad. Excellent!!!

I used only 2 fillets and kept the sauce the same. I had to cook them 6 mins on ea. side (didn't use the oil to cook)  and then covered and cooked for an additional 2 mins to finish them off. Some of the sauce got burnt in the pan so I had to quickly wash it out, added some oil and simmered the remaining marinade. My husband and I really liked this but it was very vinegar-y. I will make this again because it was easy, healthy and elegant but would probably omit one of the tablespoons of balsamic and add a bit more ginger. Great over brown rice!

I would not double the glaze as some reviewers had suggested.  It was good though.  We don't typically like fish, and we enjoyed this recipe and we will make it again.

I need to work on my mahi cooking skills (it was a bit messy to say the least due to user error), but this glaze was delicious.  I had all the ingredients despite being a novice cook, and the taste would really go well with any meat.  I'm eager to try it on chicken.  I would advise making more than necessary to drizzle over wild rice or pasta... YUM!

This was magnificent!! My family loved it, and my kids hate fish so now I have a recipe they will eat.  I also didn’t have fresh ginger so I used dried. And I have used this recipe with different fish. It is great with them all.

This recipe was fabulous! Wonderful flavor, and without having to marinate for hours!! I don't think there is a need to salt the fish as there is enough sodium in soy sauce to dehydrate the Pacific :) Very easy - no doubt we will have this one again!

My family loved this recipe!  I replaced the honey with applesauce and it turned out perfectly (I will continue to make it this way).  I used both mahi mahi and salmon, they were both great!  My 5 yr old and 2 yr old were practically licking their plates!

This is a wonderful recipe! The whole process only takes about 30 minutes, and yet the fish tasted like it had marinated for a long time. The sauce is quite flavorful and dark, in fact my only word of warning would be to keep a close eye on the sauce as you reduce it so that it doesn't burn. I will definitely make this recipe again! Even my finicky 16 year old daughter liked it.

By far, one of the best fish recipes I have tried. I also used powdered ginger because it was what I had on hand.

Definitely a keeper! The whole family enjoyed it....

I was not a fan of this recipe. I only gave it three stars because my boyfriend liked it. I thought the sauce tasted a bit overpowering and had too much soy sauce in it. If I did make it again (which I won't), I would put in less soy.

Great fish dish that is not fishy.  Served it on a salad of spring greens, red peppers, cukes and sliced almonds.  The glaze made a great dressing - it was almost like being at a restaurant.

This is excellent. I tried it with different fish. I have used speckled sea trout and grouper but mahi definatly works the best the texture of the fish holds up well in the balsalmic vinigar. I tend to cut back on the garlic just a hair but thats for personal prefernce. I have made this for several dinner parties and it has always been a hit. I like to pair it with fresh apsaragus and yellow or wild rice.

This marinade was delicious.  I used talapia instead of Mahi Mahi because that is what I had and I baked them in the oven.  Great healthy recipe.  I will definately make it again.

REALLY GOOD!!  I usually follow a recipe to the letter the first time I make it, but I didn't have olive oil, so I substituted with sesame oil. It really brought out some wonderful flavor. That is, if you like sesame...

We enjoyed this.  We used Trader Joe's frozen mahi mahi and were surprised at how well it turned out.  We did double the sauce part as per another reviewer, but had a ton left over.  Not sure I would do that again.

This recipe is exceptional. It's simple and oh so tasty and healthy. We grilled the mahi mahi vs. using a skillet and was very happy with the outcome. This recipe has become a staple in our house and we make it very often.

YES! I found some Mahi Mahi down in the bottom of the freezer that was starting to get freezer burn so I was looking for something that would have a good (little bit strong) flavor. This was super! I only had 3 fillets and the amount of glaze was perfect. It was so good I ate 2 of them for my lunch.

I probably only liked this 4.5 stars worth.  But the rest of my family gobbled it up!!  Even my 18 month old who doesn't eat meat well, and my picky 4 year old!  I am THRILLED.
I followed the recipe to a T.  YUM. (by the way, I had PLENTY of glaze, just don't let all the liquid boil out and there's enough!)

This recipe was too salty for me.  If I make it again, I will use reduced sodium soy sauce.  I also found that spooning the glaze over the cooked fish to be overpowering; I think I would have liked the glaze better just as a marinade.

Very aromatic and easy. I marinated the fish for about an hour in a zip-loc baggie (to save on clean up) and then grilled the fish. My family wasn't too crazy for this simply because it was a new fish to them. Probably will make again when Mahi Mahi is on sale again.

Nice flavor--but definately much too strong for a delicate fish such as mahi, as many other members have said.  This would be well suited to salmon and even tuna.  If you do use this recipe for mahi, I recommend just LIGHTLY seasoning each filet with salt, pepper, a touch of garlic powder and ground ginger, and then reducing the marinade as described (yes, adding a little corn starch helps to thicken nicely), and just using a little to sauce on the plate under the filet to serve.  I believe this will capture the flavor of the fish and the glaze nicely.

I agree with a previous reviewer; this fish would be better prepared with a lighter, fresher method of cooking. This glaze would be good on chicken or wings...it seemed to overpower the fish and I couldn't really enjoy the flavor. I'd rather do something with lemon and fresh herbs next time, for example.

Wonderful Mahi Mahi recipe!  I marinaded the fish for a few hours instead of the required 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.

Fantastic recipe - super easy to make, pretty healthy, and really wonderful flavor.  The pan frying puts a nice sear on the fish (makes a great presentation), but this might be even better on the grill.

The only change I made was to marinate in a zip-top bag - I like how the marinade stays in constant contact with the fish that way.

The glaze used in this recipe is soooo good! This is certainly a favorite in my house, and not just on fish! 

The first time I tried this recipe, I used tilapia. That was not the best choice. It is, however, very tasty on chicken and less "fishy" fishes.

I stuck to the recipe except for the following: added 1 tsp Trader Joe's cruched ginger (in a jar) IN ADDITION to the amount of fresh ginger called for; used ~3 cloves of garlic; and made a second batch of sauce for dipping using the changes mentioned above and decreasing honey to 2 tbs. 

Awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing!

UPDATE: Tried it with salmon tonight, even better than with mahi mahi! Made a couple of changes again. Skipped the jarred ginger this time and added ~2 tbs of fresh. Used garlic press for the 3 cloves of garlic and used 4 tbs each of balsamic vinegar and reduced sodium soy sauce.

This is an excellent fish recipe.  I followed the direction exactly as they are written and the fish came out perfectly.  My husband is not a big fan of fish but eats it because he knows its good for him.  So, I'm always looking for a way to make the fish that he'll enjoy better.  He loved this recipe and has recently asked when I'll make it again.

WOW!  What a terrific recipe!  Thank you!  I did some slight changes, as I used Tuna and pan seared the steaks for about 1 mintue each side and I didn't have fresh ginger so I used dried.  Terrific, my kids (ages 7 & 3) LOVED it!  thanks

My wife liked this, but I thought it was an absolute disaster. We both love Mahi Mahi, but I think that because Mahi is a saltwater fish, the amount of soy sauce should be decreased dramatically.  It was so salty for me that I took one bite and got rid of the rest.  Definetely not good if you ask me.  Followed the directions to the T.

This was an absolutely delicious dinner.  My husband was so impressed.  He felt it was a truly gourmet meal!  I didn't have any balsalmic vinegar, so I substituted red wine vinegar instead.  It turned out just fine.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

First time I cooked Mahi Mahi and this was a PERFECT marinade/glaze for the fish.  I cooked it on the grill and that added even more flavor, but next time I'll oil the grill better since the sugar in the glaze makes it stick.  Using FRESH GINGER is a real plus in this recipe.  Fantastic flavor and the glaze is excellent over rice.  THANKS!

I made this with roasted potates.  I marinated the fish for 4 hours while I went to run errands so it would retain the full flavor.  When I returned home, I just had to cook it.  Very simple.  My boyfriend hates fish, but loved this. He said this was my best dish yet!  Thanks for sharing.

I used ground ginger.  I've never marinated mahi mahi before, but from now on I will!  By marinating, I was able to cook the fish thoroughly and not be dry.  I had my burner too high resulting in a slighty burnt taste on the fish and glaze, so be sure to not rush, like I did!  I will also cut down on the balsamic vinegar, it was a little overpowering.

This marinade is excellent.  I substituted ground ginger, marinated Mahi Mahi about 2+ hours then grilled over direct heat.  PERFECT! Served the fish with roasted asparagus and baked sweet potato. Thank you for submitting this recipe.  I look forward to trying this recipe on chicken and salmon.

Hmmm... I suppose I will give this a three because my husband loved it and I could get 1 of my four children to eat it. I however wasn't impressed it was to salty for one and not enough ginger taste for me. Overall okay...just not good enough to make again.

This is a very good and forgiving recipe.  I realized half way through that I didn't have enough soy sauce, so I just used what I had - about 1 tsp.  It wasn't missed though.  I also didn't let the sauce achieve a good 'glaze' consistency, but it was still really good when poured over the fish.

I used 1 tsp powdered ginger and this turned out great.  Whatever is in the marinade does have a tendency to burn/blacken so don't be surprised.  I will definitely make this again.

This wasn't bad; no one complained, but it's unlikely that I'll make it again.

I loved this glaze but I guess I am not a Mahi Mahi eater. I used this glaze on chicken the same night I tried it on the mahi mahi and it was amazing. I will use this recipe again minus the fish. Thanx for sharing.

I though the recipe was okay.  It seemed to really over power the fish and I didn't even add the glaze at the end.  Perhaps next time I wouldn't maranade the fish but only make the glaze on the side and use a little of it drizzled over the fish.

This was absolutely delicious!  I had never made this type of fish before.  I made exactly as the recipe stated (although I did marinate it longer than 30 minutes), and it turned out great.  My entire family loved it!  I served it with Lipton Asian Style rice, and Bird's Eye frozen asian style vegetables (you can't get much easier than that!).  It went really well with the sauce for the fish, too!

So delicious and very easy to make.  I cooked the mahi mahi for four minutes on each side and it came out just right.  It went great with brown rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

This sounded like somthing we would really like, but it wasn't. We love Mahi, but this  recipe didn't do it any justice, and my house smelled terrible after pan-frying. Sorry!

Great end result, but 4-6 minutes per side on med-high is way too long on my stove.  I was very upset to see that one side of my fish had burned badly.  Thankfully, it was the skin side, so I just slid that off.  I'll try medium heat for 3-4 minutes per side next time.

Husband and I liked but the kids were another matter.  The first thing my youngest said was Mahi Mahi is not for Mehe Mehe.  I really enjoyed the glaze over the fish.

This is some of the best mahi mahi I have ever had!  Even the hubby ate it (this is a guy who routinely snubs fish of any kind).  Made the recipe as stated the first time, added some chili sauce the next time, both times came out delicious. Good stuff!!

I think this glaze was perfect!  I did substitute ground ginger for fresh ginger root.  However, it was still very good.  I will definitely make this again.

Because of the high sugar content in the marinade, it make the fish blacken very nicely in the fry pan. I used Orange Roughy, and really any kind of mild white fish will do great with this. Even salmon I'm sure! This is something you can run to the store, pick up the fish, and have dinner on the table within an hour or less, and a tasty one at that!

Awesome!  I marinated this for about two hours and then we grilled it.  I reduced the rest of the marinade to a glaze, but only spooned a little of it onto the cooked fish.  This is probably the best fish recipe I have found yet.

I was looking for something with a asian flare to try. WOW!!! This was the best Mahi Mahi I have ever tried.  It was extremely flavorful, and so easy to prepare.  My family thought that I slaved all day.

This was very good.  I cooked it on the grill and that helped flavor it nicely as well.  Fresh ginger is a must!  The marinate would work well on any "white" fish and would probably be tasty on chicken too.

I liked this.  I only had frozen mahi mahi fillets though, which might have detracted from the recipe (according to Mom, lol.)I doubled the recipe too.  Had some trouble getting the sauce to "glaze" consistancy, so I just poured it all on when I though it was close enough. Marinated it for about an hour and a half.  Might poke some holes in the fillets next time to have it soak up the flavor easier.  Reminded me of terriaki almost.

I was able to whip this up for me and my date in less than half an hour.  We both agreed it was the best fish we ever had home cooked.  I can easily imagine spending serious cash for this dish at a nice restaurant.  Make this once and you'll be convinced that you are now a four star chef!!

Outstanding!!!  I had read several comments about this recipe being "restaurant quality" and it is absolutely true.  I too used dried ginger, added about 1 TB of fresh chopped cilantro and cooked in a fish basket on the grill.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to use fresh ginger.  My husband has been raving about it for two days now and we will be making this for our next dinner party.

my husband said that this "tasted like something you would pay $17/plate for at a restaurant".  i added some chopped cilantro to the marinade and also added a little bit of chopped onions to the oil when sauteeing the fish.  i think those really made nice additions to this dish.  i served it up with rice pilaf for a quick dinner and the kids loved it.

We tried this 2 weeks ago.  It has a nice flavor, I guess because of the balsamic vinegar.  I found the cooking time to be very accurate and our fish was cooked perfectly.  I am making it again tonight.

Really good. Even my 7-yr-old, who is just getting 'adventurous' food-wise, raved about it. I'll definitely make this again, because it works great with the individually-frozen fillets I buy.

Very nice recipe.  The sauce is delicious.  I added orange juice for a little more flavor.  I also baked the fish instead of frying (450° for 10 min), but I left it in the oven a little too long, so the fish was a bit on the dry side.

This is an excellent recipe for fish. My husband liked it so much he asked me to make extra for him next time. I make it on the George Forman grill and serve it with CousCous, and steamed veggies. Quick and easy!

Absolutely wonderful!  Just like another suggestion I used apple cider vinegar instead of the balsamic and it tasted great.  If you can, use the fresh ginger it goes well with the rest of the ingredients.  I used my George Foreman grill instead of frying them and they were yummy.  Double the marinade though because you will want to keep applying it to the fish as you are eating it.

Best marinade/sauce I've ever had on fish.  Sweet and spicy, tangy and tart.  Just perfect.

I'm not a big fan of any fish that isn't fried catfish, but the doctor told hubby he needed to eat more fish so I'm branching out my fish recipes.  I was surprised that I enjoyed this.  It was quite good and I'll make it again.  The mahi mahi was a bit pricey (but worth it).  I used powdered ginger since I had some already.  I served this with mixed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  There was a bit of glaze left over so I stirred it into the veggies.  YUM!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but we thought the Balsamic Vinegar overpowered the other ingredients and we love balsamic vinegar.  I am going to try making this again without the vinegar.

This was just awesome!  The marinade caused the fish to blacken when cooked ( I lessened the vinegar to our taste). We didn't need to use all the glaze and the flavor was still absolutely incredible.  I served it with a simple fried rice (sesame oil, onions, garlic, cooked rice, eggs, soy sauce and a dash of cayenne)  A total keeper!

The taste of the balsamic vinegar overpowered this recipe.  If I were to make it again, I would omit it altogether.

I'm definitely keeping this one.  Just the sauce alone could be used for so many things.  I did grill the fish instead of frying it.  I think it gives the fish a better flavor and it doesn't stink up the house.

Fantastic!  Had to leave out the ginger and the garlic went in a little late (both of which I'm blaming on my sister), but the fish was out of this world.  Definitely serve it over rice so that you don't waste any of that great sauce!

I used this on salmon since that's what I had and I really enjoyed the flavor from the marinade.  I let mine marinate all day and then broiled it.  I think fresh ginger and garlic is the key.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so delicious!  I only had 2 mahi mahi filets, so I also used salmon.  We actually liked the salmon better.  The sauce turned out so wonderfully thick and sweet, that I really wished I had doubled the amount to pour on the rice.  I can hardly wait to make this again, and would not hesitate using it with chicken, or even better, on a pork tenderloin.  Wonderful recipe!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I substitute the fresh ginger root w/ 1/4 tsp. ground ginger and it turns out great.  I also have grilled the Mahi Mahi which also gives it an excellent flavor. If you aren't that fond of fish, this is a good recipe to start with due to the mild flavor of the Mahi Mahi.

This recipe is fabulous!!  The only fish I like is Mahi and Tuna and I have been dying for a great recipe!  Has so much flavor and it really is easy to make.  I keep a bag of frozen Mahi steaks in the freezer and between defrosting the Mahi, marinating and cooking I think it took about 40 minutes.  Great quick meal to really impress someone!

Yum, this was outstanding and so easy.  I cooked the fish on a grill pan and crisped the outside a little bit by accident, and it was a great accident which I'd try to duplicate.  The sauce reduced to an awesome glaze, and I served the fish and sauce over rice to absorb the sauce.  
Great idea, I will use this again.  I think the sauce would also work really well over pork, too.

Yum, yum, yum. What can I say but "YUM"!! I followed this exactly (except I used salmon and increased cooking time for thickness) and it was so tasty. Out of 6 of us here, 5 of us wolfed it down - the other one just doesn't like sauce of any kind! We had it with couscous and a salad. Absolutely fabulous! Will definitely be putting this into the rotation and will try it with other fish and maybe even chicken or pork. Thanks Diana!

I thought this was a great recipe. My boyfriend hates fish, ALL fish, and he said this was the best fish he has ever eaten! The sauce was mild flavored and easy to prepare--I am taking this recipe with me when I go back to college because it is so easy to make in a small amount of time (and so good). I found that the sauce only thickened after I cooked it a few minutes and then turned it off to cool. Once it thickened, it was delicious....this is the only prepared fish I have had that has not left me with "fish breath" or "fish burps" afterwards. Good recipe, thank you for it!

A quick and easy dinner.  I grilled the mahi and it turned our great and no messy saute pan to clean. I served this with steamed fresh broccoli, mango salsa and salad. This would be a great meal for special guests (and no one will guess it takes 30 minutes)!

This was probably one of the best fish recipes I have had in a long time!  Although, for those who are not fortunate enough to have a gas range (like me), be careful with the heat.  I did burn a piece just a little on one side, but the taste of the fish was so amazing that I hardly noticed.

Good, but disappointing for the first time trying mahi mahi.  It would make a good marinade and sauce for chicken and beef, though.  It probably had a lot to do with the fact the fish was bought "fresh frozen" instead of fresh caught.  Kind of hard to find fresh mahi mahi in Alaska.  Other fish and seafoods are, but not this one!

I liked this recipe! So easy and delicious. I used thawed mahi mahi from Costco. The pieces were thin so I fried for half the time, and it came out perfect. I might reduce the soy sauce by 1/4 next time, as I found it a bit salty, and already I used low sodium soy sauce.

Made this tonight.  Same directions other than adding salt and pepper to the marinade rather than directly to the fish because why not?  Consensus was that it was great, but that marinating time could be extended to pop even more.  So I would say anywhere from 20 mins to 2 hours would be great, whatever you can do.  It does make a bit of a mess when cooking in a skillet, though I'll take that and then be able to spend 20 seconds for the marinade to reduce any day over a more complicated oven plus stove version.  Maybe think splatter screen.  Or just be prepared to clean up a bit.

I loved this! It was really easy and tasted fabulous! Son and wife thought too much ginger. I love ginger so I loved it. If I were to make it again I would do half the ginger and see how they like it then.

It was the first time I've cooked mahi mahi and I did not make any changes. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again. It's good for a beginner!

Made as is but with Cod because Mahi Mahi was unavailable and it was amazing! Served with sautéed squash and zucchini which we dipped in the glaze.

I enjoyed the sweet element, as I haven't used a lot of sweet recipes on fish up to now, and served it over basmatti rice. Our fillets were a little thick so I might consider marinading longer next time to see if I can get the flavor to permeate a little more. I wouldn't call it an A+, but I'm kinda picky about fish, so this was still quite good for a fish recipe. I'll keep it and probably try it again sometime, maybe with a different kind of fish too (I'm sure it would go well with several varieties).

Baked it as was suggested, however, covered it while baking and thought the fish was a little dry.  Will make again, bake it uncovered.  Made this for two, halved the sauce.  Will add more honey next time.  Thought the 3 stars was my fault for maybe over cooking, otherwise will make again and will update my review.

Delicious mahi mahi! We've never been fish fans, but recently needed to make some dietary changes including fish. This was our first try at mahi mahi, and we loved it! Definitely will be having it on the regular.

I made it this evening.  I marinated it for 40 mins instead of 20.  Otherwise, I kept everything the same - didn't change a thing.  It's great! Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was OK. The mahi-mahi tasted fishy. Can someone tell me what I did wrong? And I think it needs lemon juice.  Also, 3 tablespoons of soy sauce is way too much. Very strong ingredient so I am glad I use less and it was still strong. Next time, maybe 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. We used liquid aminos as a healthier option.

Very tasty, I baked it for 20 min at 400 and then put almonds on top and broiled.  Fish was too dry, next time I need to bake less if I am going to broil at the end.  Marinade was great though.

Great recipe, followed ingredients pretty closely, subbing light soy sauce for regular due to health reasons. I had a Costco Mahi Mahi and 2  Costco Salmon fillets to work with so I put in two small Corning ware dishes, poured 2/3 over salmon, then added the Asian garlic chile sauce to the reminder and then poured over mahi for my husband that likes spicy. I put a little sake over the salmon. put in fridge for 30 minutes. Started a pot of Basmati rice while the oven was heating up to 390. Rice was ready to go to low heat and simmer the same time the oven was ready. Put both casseroles in oven and set timer for 18 minutes. Had perfectly done rice and fish all done at same time. Will add to rotation.

Easy and tasty.  The hardest part was dealing with the honey in my ice cold kitchen.   I marinated on the counter as opposed to the fridge.  Delicious.

Great recipe! Marinated in a plastic bag in the fridge which made it easier to coat all surfaces of the fish.  Spiced it up with a little heat from chili oil and red pepper flakes, and added a teaspoon of 5 Spice powder. Yum!

I used only 1 tbs honey for this; then made another batch using 3 tbs as the recipe calls for and used it as a marinade for cubed yams - about 5 medium sized, which I then roasted in a cast iron skillet at 375 for 35-40 minutes - delicious!

Meh. It was just okay. I wouldn't repeat this recipe. I had some leftovers that I coated in southwest spice and warmed up in the oven for fish tacos the next day. Those were far and away better than the original dish!

Pretty  awesome! So what I did slightly different than the recipe was tripled the ingredients, I had six filets to marinate and needed more sauce, and then rather than wait for the filets to cook, I heated the sauce in a separate sauce pan at medium/high heat with 2 TBSP of vegetable oil until it thickened - which had me finishing the fish at the same time the sauce was done. 

It came out awesome. My mom and dad were impressed, as I was I.

This was really good. I followed the recipe as written with the only change being a light dusting of cayenne on the mahi mahi to give it a zing and to counter the sweet, salty marinade. I opted to bake in the oven as Hula Kahlua had suggested. One less pan to clean and no oil spatters all over the stove.

Perfect.
Next time we make this, we'll hold back on 10% to 25% of the cajun spices.  the recipe amount wasn't overwhelmingly too much, but close. :)

I had to substitute red wine with apple cider vinegar because I didn't have any, but it was still tasty.  I also seasoned my mahi mahi with ginger, paprika and Old Bay before adding it to the glaze.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe and surprised, based on the number of great reviews.  I followed it exactly and thought the sauce cooked too quickly (due to the honey) and in four minutes on a side, it seemed overcooked.  The glaze quickly cooked down. I was surprised that the flavor was somewhat lacking, despite the ingredients.  Maybe it needed a bit more garlic.

This recipe is excellent and packed with flavor.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the Mahi Mahi came out absolutely wonderful.  I used a 12 inch cast iron pan and only cooked 2 fillets and I highly recommend this method.  This is definitely one that is a keeper and I'm also going to try the marinade sauce on other dishes.  My thanks to whoever submitted this as it was GREAT!

This was excellent!  I grilled salmon and mahi mahi after marinating in this sauce for about 3 hours.  The salmon was the bigger hit and my kids who claim to hate fish when back for seconds and thirds!  I did boil down the marinate and serve it on the side.  Everyone added that sauce to their fish because it was so tasty.

This is an excellent recipe!  I also took the marinade and boiled it down to use on top of the fish, and it was delicious.  Since there are only two of us, I split the marinade, and frozen two pieces of MahiMahi with it in marinade, thawed and cooked later, still wonderful!!  With those results, I made a batch ahead and froze 4 filets two at time.  Easy to pull out thaw and have an amazing meal!!  Fantastic, low calorie recipe!  I’ve had it fried, baked and grilled, all are amazing.

Excellent recipe! We had fresh MahiMahi from a Seattle fish market via John’s son, Jake. Absolutely stupendous! Served it to John’s Brother and his wife Kim, with a bit of NW salmon. Fresh pineapple, cheesy cauliflower and biscuits. Heaven! Thanks for the delightful recipe.

This was YUM YUM YUMMY! My 9 year old who is on the fence about fish, loved it!! My teen neighbor who doesn't eat fish, loved it! We told her it was chicken and she believed us! Even after we told her it was fish, she still ate it! It was a hit with the family and our friends! Definitely will make again. Didn't change the recipe at all until the very end. I added a finger sprinkle of corn starch to thicken the glaze. Didn't even water it down. Just a sprinkle with my fingertips dipped in the cornstarch did the trick!

I can't find Mahi Mahi in any regular grocery store, so I substituted. I would have done halibut, a fish similar in feel and texture, but at $18 for 2 fillets I said no thanks and used Swa insteadi, which still relatively inexpensive.

That's my disclaimer. Having said that, lemme tell you, as long as you're not using a naturally flavorful fish like salmon or tuna, this will absolutely work. My 15y.o. daughter who "hates seafood, why would you do this to me?" not only gobbled it up but served herself seconds. That good. 

I've never worked with catfish, but I hear that is also a comparable fish, might try that next Friday.

Cooking the fish at medium high heat is a mistake, especially at the suggested cooking time.  At five minutes on the first side the honey mixture went beyond caramelization and burnt the fish.  It was inedible!

I make this almost every week, but use the sauce when baking chicken breasts.  I can't have honey, so I use 1 tbsp sugar instead, add a pinch of hot chili powder, and use peanut oil instead of olive oil.    It's delicious!!!

Absolutely loved the soy-ginger glaze, which tasted as good as glazes I've had when out to eat, and I'd double the sauce next time! I only used one (massive) fillet and served this over a bed of couscous, and some extra sauce would've created some extra drizzling opportunities. To be honest, the mahi mahi tasted a bit too "fishy" for my palate, but that wasn't the fault of the recipe. The S.O. loved the entire dish, including the fish. 

I used the pre-chopped ginger that comes in a jar, which may not have been as good as freshly grated, but it's definitely preferable over the spice-rack ginger.

I did fry this but would consider baking next time. However, the outside of the fish browned nicely in the skillet.

I can not even tell you how amazing the flavor of this marinade is!!!!  if there were more stars I'd give it!!!!!  I add a small bit of butter to the end reduction glaze to soften it and give it a shine and depth of flavor, otherwise perfect!  I would recommend you double it though so you have more glaze.  I serve it with sautéed petite greenbeans and couscous.

The honey plus fying means the fish burnt on both ends within a minute or two, even at medium low.

Made it this evening... my wife and I loved it! Only made one small change in the recipe. I put the garlic thru a handheld garlic press instead of just crunching it. Looking fed to doing this one again soon.

This was very tasty. I baked it in the oven for about 10 minutes at somewhere between 350-400 (does anyone really pay attention?). And for the last couple minutes I turned the broiler on while basting the mahi mahi in the left over marinade. 

Fish flaked perfectly and tasted amazing.

My family and I absolutely enjoyed this dish!  It's very rare when the whole family likes it.  I followed the recipe exactly how it's written.  After reading some suggestions I plan on doubling the marinade and baking instead of frying.  Definitely making this again!

The marinade was very tasty.
4-6 mins per side would have been far too over done for me.
I  seared each side for less than one minute.

Wow was this good!  The sauce was AMAZING!  The grocery store did not have mahi mahi so I used tilapia instead.  Double the sauce!  I would suggest making rice with this so that you can put the sauce over it. Only thing that I changed was that I did not add the garlic as my husband can't eat it anymore.  It was easy to make as well.  Will definitely make again and again!

This looks like a really delicious dish to prepare, but is there any substitute for the Mahi Mahi fish, because I don't think it is found in my region

I didn't care for this at all. Made it according to recipe. Actually, I threw the remaining piece away.  Maybe I don't like mahi mahi.

This was sooooo tasty!!! I used salmon since I didn't have any mahi mahi and it went very well. I also baked it at 350 for 10 minutes per inch thickness. Next time I will make extra marinade to drizzle over top. That was excellent!

Oh my stars! This is delicious!!!  We are not ginger fans at all but I took a chance on it.  I used ginger powder instead of fresh. We loved it so much we used it on other meats too and ate it twice this week.

This is a favorite of ours.  Instead of fresh ginger root and fresh garlic I use Ground Ginger and Garlic Powder (no salt) from my spice drawer.  After marinating take out of marinade and bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  Yum!
PS Didn't use any salt... after all there is enough salt in the soy sauce!

Caught fresh mahi mahi in Hawaii and prepared it as directed. Only difference was I foiled wrapped and BBQ'd the fish,  I even made an additional batch of marinade as a sauce.  Was disappointed to be honest. THE soy sauce and ginger overwhelmed the flavor of the fish and masked it with a strong sweet ginger taste that I wouldn't choose  again

The sauce didn't mix well with the fish. I couldn't eat the fish. But I poured the sauce over some sweet peppers and they were delicious.

I made this after a trip to Costco where I was adventurous enough to buy mahi mahi fillets.  I searched allrecipes and found this glaze, it was perfect!  So easy, ingredients I had on hand, and it was like eating in a restaurant.  I topped it with some diced mango and avodado, and served with a side of basmati rice.  YUM, will definitely make again!

This was delicious, and very quick to prepare. All the flavors were perfect, and made  a sweet marinade with an Asian flare. My husband and daughter loved it too. I will definitely make it again.

Followed the ingredient list exactly but baked it for 20 min on 400 degrees. Delicious! Next time I will try reducing the sauce a little more in a fry pan as it was still pretty liquidy and I had to spoon it on top of the filets. Will bake them in a little bit of the sauce and the rest I will reduce. Quick and easy recipe too!

Great dish. Super easy to make. As the marinade reduced to near half I reduced heat to thicken the glaze. Help the ginger and honey stand out.

Made this tonight and thought it was pretty good.  Everyone in my house ate it so that says something.  I started it around 4 and let it sit in the marinade for 2 hours.  I swapped out the honey for agave syrup because we are trying to watch our sugar intake.  Sautéed zucchini noodles in the remainder of the marinade and it was very good compliment to the fish.

No changes and it still is fantastic on all different types of fish.. I have tried in on Cod, Mahi and  Grouper.  It is great.  Will make it again.  I reserved some of the marinate and warmed it in a sauce pan to pour over the cooked fish.  It makes it even better.  Try it you will like it.

This really sounded good and the reviews were great . . .  however, it turned out terrible.  I don't know if I did something wrong, maybe too much balsalmic vinegar or something.   My vinegar is organic, so maybe it is stronger or something but it was way overpowering.

The marinade tastes amazing.  I used this on a couple of wahoo steaks last night.  I followed the baking suggestion that someone commented on doing before.  I should have marinaded them longer than suggested as they were rather thick steaks but it tasted really good and helped keep the wahoo from drying out.

my store did not have mahi mahi so i substituted it with tuna. unfortunately 6 minutes of cooking was a bit much for the tuna and it got slightly burnt. easy to peel off so no biggie. the sauce is tangy like teriyaki and i enjoyed the ginger taste in the background. overall a simple and tasty dish.

This was a great tasting marinade. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1/2 a teaspoon of dried instead. We grilled in on the gas grill for about 12 minutes on a piece of non stick grill foil.  Was very tasty and I will for sure be making this again. Next time I will let it sit in the marinade for at least an hour before I grill it.

Made this using flounder vs mahi mahi, but worked very well.  love the marinade and the flavor it imparted on the fish.  I liked the marinade so much that I used it on pork chops and it was fantastic.  I'll be making this again as well as using the marinade on various other meats.

Fiance gave it 4.5 stars and I give it 4. Served with steamed broccoli and soba noodles, and doubled the sauce to spoon over everything. Also used saw instead of mahi mahi. The sauce was delicious. Will make again!

I was excited to try this recipe.  However, we found this to be just sub par - nothing overwhelmingly great about it and I would not make again.

I made this today and loved it.  I didn't have mahi in the house and made it with tilapia. The marinade was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  this would be great with chicken as well

WOW is all I can say.  Very delicious and gourmet.  Something served at a gourmet restaurant.  I served this with Ginger Scented Jasmine Rice (Pretty much add fresh ginger to jasmine rice when cooking).

I made this recipe as written and it turned out glorious.  Family loved the mahi mahi, and my lil guy and a family friend raved about it.  Paired it with a coconut jasmine rice topped with mango and some sautéed bok choy (both recipes on AR), all of which complimented the meal very nicely. They are already asking to make this a staple meal in the house.  I have to agree.  Definitely found a keeper.  Great recipe, thank you!

The glaze alone would make cotton balls edible.  I will make this again for sure.  I flash fried it in a hot pan and then finished it off in the oven.  Be careful when reducing the marinade.  It got thick fast and was almost unusable after it cooled a little.

I use this now favourite. sauce  from the recipe  as my go- to TERIYAKI marinade for my baked chicken also! I loved it as is but double the recipe for extra sauce for chicken and rice. After a few times I tried adding a couple tsp of cornstarch in cold water mixture to thicken the sauce a little- optional change.

I eliminated the vegetable oil, and broiled the Mahi Mahi about 3 minutes on one side and about 5 minutes on the other side.  It was delicious! My 4 year old loved it,  and my husband said this should go in the regular rotation :-)

This recipe turned out fabulous.  Very tasty.  I baked the fish in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Alleviated the fish odor that occurs when using a fry pan.  I served it with a brown and wild rice side and corn on the cob.

This turned out really good! Loved the flavor of the fresh ginger, will probably make the marinade and glaze for any white fish we make. Only changes I made was to the quantity of the glaze. I like a lot of sauce and used it for the steamed jasmine and veggies we had as sides. Thanks!

This turned out really great.   I served it with brown rice and sugar snap peas.  Next time, I think I will double the sauce so I have more to drizzle on the rice too.

I thought the soy sauce was overpowering the other flavors.  I would probably only use 1/3 of what is called for.  I also wouldn't salt the fish first.  Between salting the fish and soaking it in soy sauce, that is a lot of salt flavor.  I would also cook over just medium heat, not medium high.  Bits of the glazing burnt in the skillet while cooking the fish, so deglazing the pan with the remaining marinade had a slight burnt taste, and the fish was a bit overdone at 4 minutes a side.

The seasonings and cooking time were perfect.  I used a cast iron grill pan for the fish.  I dis a squash medley as a side dish and added some of the excess marinade to it while it was cooking.  It was a very nice complement to the fish.

I love making this dish. 
I like to make it with a medley of steamed Zuchini, Red Bell Peppers, and String Beans in addition to the  plain white rice.

Very good and simple. I used thawed frozen mahi mahi and decided to broil the fillets rather than pan fry them.  I think that this method broiled off a good portion of the glaze, but I think baking would be better or using our George Foreman grill.

We both enjoyed it, I didn't change anything, except I just made 2 pieces of fish.  This is my first review here, it is a keeper.

this was SO easy to make and love that it uses all ingredients that I usually have on-hand. I  baked the fish at 400 for 15 mins instead of pan frying, and served with roasted cauliflower dusted w/ smoked paprika. perfect weeknight meal!

I don't cook often and I have inly cooked fish once before. This recipe was easy - even for a man who can't tell a teaspoon from a tablespoon - and delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This was so easy and yummy!  The sauce is to die for!  My only regret is that I didn't double the sauce so that I would have had more glaze to pour all over my dinner.  It is great on couscous and vegetables too.  Also, I grilled the fish and it turned out beautifully

Excellent.  Followed the recipes except I made mine in the oven wrapped in foil.   I thought it had the perfect flavor to complement the fish.  Not over powering.  Will definitely make again.

Recipe is perfect but I made a couple health conscious tweeks! I only used 2 tsp olive oil on the pan and only 1 tsp for the marinade for 3 five oz fillets. Also, didn't need salt and pepper and I used 1/2 the sugar required. Delish!

Fantastic Taste. The only change I made was using teriyaki soy sauce instead of regular (we were out of regular). I think I'm going to leave it in for my recipe. This was a great meal. Thanks!

This is my favorite fish to eat!! I love this recipe bc it reminds me of what I had on our trip to St. Kitts last year. I dint have fresh ginger or a clove of garlic, so I used the powder ones from my spice rack. It still turned out wonderful!

I've made this fish entree about 6 times already with mahi we caught fishing.  We also caught some huge wahoo's and had them cut into steaks.   It was oh so good and different for a fish dish.

The glaze recipe tasted good with the Mahi Mahi. I paired it with asparagus spears. Interestingly, the glaze tasted delicious on the asparagus. Another side dish was spaghetti with mushroom pesto with parsley and thyme.
All in all, the meal tasted good, and next time, I probably need to find a bottle of wine that will compliment the light flavors of the dish.

Great recipe. The glaze tasted amazing when having a bit of ginger in each bite. Without the ginger, it wasn't anything special. Will make it again but possibly adding a bit of orange to the glaze or substituting orange for ginger

Great recipe. The fish will really absorb the sauce if done right. I love ginger so I added plenty extra and kept the pieces a little mashed up but larger. All the flavors blended together and there was no overpowering ginger taste.

I live in the Florida Keys and my husband fishes for Mahi often, so recipes like this are great.  I gave this one a 5 star rating for its bold flavors.  It is as good if not better than some I've had at restaurants.  I will be saving this recipe and making it often.  Only difference is I will be baking it as suggested by some of the other ratings as healthier option.

Made this for my crew at the fire station tonight.  I baked it on our Traeger wood pellet grill.  The flavor was amazing.  The guys loved it.  Definitely keeping this one for next time.

The only changes I made were I used dried ginger and garlic powder instead of fresh. I let it marinate for about a half hour and I pan fried for 5 minutes on each side. It was delicious.

My goodness! This was super easy and delicious. I did make some changes because the original glaze was just too tart. I added  2 T. brown sugar with me already doubling the recipe amount. I didn't marinade, just slow boiled the glaze to reduce. Then I seasoned the mahi with salt and pepper and fried in vegetable oil according to directions. Then poured the glaze over the fish and cilantro and lime rice. You've got to try this. So very quick, makes this one of my new go to meals.

Just got through eating this and was a little disappointed.  I think I would have loved it with a little more garlic and ginger and a little less vinegar and salt.  The salt in the soy sauce is enough you don't need to salt the fish before frying.  But balsamic vinegar has a very strong taste and for me just a little goes a long way.  I will try it again with these changes.

I hate cooking my husband is the main chef in this house. However he dared me to make him a meal tonight, thank God I came across this recipe.  This was super easy to make and amazingly tasty. I didnt have fresh ginger so I substitued it with powder ginger. The smell filled the kitchen and it kept my husband guessing the ingredients all night. Ty ty ty to the originator, w/ recipes like this maybe Ill cook more.

Wonderful flavor combination.  Use lower heat to cook fish and reduce sauce. Sauce reduces quickly and burns easily.  Watch it carefully. Great served over wild rice with the fish and a grapefruit avocado salad.

I wound up having to use albacore tuna steaks in place of the Mahi Mahi out of necessity, but otherwise made no changes. I think I would cut back on the soy sauce a little next time because it made the fish a hair too salty, and it overwhelmed the ginger flavor, but other than that, a great, quick, easy dinner!

This recipe was easy to make. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, because that's what I had on hand. The marinade reminded us of teriyaki flavor which was not our preference.

I am not sure what happened with the people who gave this recipe negative reviews but its delicious!! My husband loves this and asks for it almost every week! This type of recipe for fish is not my favorite but even I think its really good! I have served it to company as well and they thought it was very tasty.

Really good!  First words out of husband's mouth was "oh wow!"   Used dried ginger, a squirt of sriracha and cooked on the George Foreman. I used the mahi mahi filets from Costco too.   Served with rice pilaf, a salad and warm French bread - awesome, EASY dinner!

This is one of my favorite fish recipes. I have to admit I have only tried it with Mahi Mahi but I have no doubts it will work with other fish and chicken as she says. This recipe is so very easy to prepare. I have both grilled it and pan fried it but using Le Creuset skillet. You can't get a more even heat than from their cookware. No sticking whatsoever. I serve with a white rice and marinated grilled asparagus. A very filling meal.

Excellent.  Your guests will think you really labored over this dish -- it is very flavorful and looks great.  I've always utilized ground ginger, as I simply never have fresh ginger root on-hand and use 3 tablespoons of minced garlic, rather than crushed.  I've also used this recipe on tilapia, and it's superb!

I can't get enough of this sweet, mild, and tender dolphin. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a restaurant quality dish. The cook time was accurate(medium)as long as you dont have the burner too high. Spray olive oil will do. Weight Watcher Points - 6! Serve this with wild rice and for presentation, pack the cooked rice in a ramakin then turn upside down on the plate. Add fresh spinach and drizle the glaze over it. Beautiful!

Great tasting recipe that wasn't too difficult to make...always a plus! I let the mahi mahi marinate in the refrigerator longer than the 20 minutes the recipe calls for; at least a half hour up to an hour. Even without the glaze you could taste the sweet flavor come through the fish nicely.

This was really good but 4 to 6 minutes on each side was way too long on medium high heat on my electric range. Two minutes each side was enough and next time I'm going to try it baked!

Loved this recipe! I used someone else's suggestion and baked it instead of frying (not sure if that makes it any healthier, but it was easier when timing with other foods) and it was delicious. I used coconut oil for health/flavor and that worked really well. Served with rice, teriyaki veggies and an avocado-mango salsa (on this website) and everything was a huge hit!

This recipe was super easy!  Didn't use the oil in marinade and cooked it on the grill.  My husband(49yrs) is a newbie to fish dishes. He said he wants it again, this week!  Incredible taste!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper

Easy and delicious. Made it for a dinner party and no leftovers.  Making it again tonight.  Didn't have balsamic, used cider vinegar, don't know if it would be better with balsamic....

Cooked this for my wife and had a neighbor over for dinner (He brought us the mahi mahi which he had caught the day before).

Everybody, (myself included) loved this.

Very easy to make.

Fast, easy and flavorful - what more can you ask? I served it with green beans sauteed in garlic with almond slivers and black beans. This will definitely get added to the recipe rotation in my house!

The garlic and ginger with the honey, soy saucei and balsamic were incredible. I didn't use any oils. No extra fat is needed -ever. We prepared mahi-mahi and portobello mushrooms then grilled serving the final product over greens. The 'dressing' was enough for the greens. I'd make this again..no oils because fat is fat- there are many other ways to create flavor.

My teenaged son and I made this as one of his 'cooking lessons' and we really enjoyed it.  I followed the directions (w/exception of substituting 1/2t dried ginger) but I didn't panfry it on the cooktop.  I followed the cooking directions of reviewer "Hula-Kahlua" (Feb 2009) and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes while thickening/cooking the marinade in a saucepan on the cooktop.  The fish was flavorful and moist without the sauce, but DEFINITELY serve it with this delicious sauce.

This ingredient list is amazing! My kids love it.

I made it with the following changes:

1. cheaper swai/tilapia from sams
2. and baked it for a few
3. roughly chopped the garlic because i like how crunchy it comes out when broiled.
4. served with white rice
5. topped with sliced green onions

Notes:
I think the key to this is to use a better quality honey and soy sauce. I like tamari style better than kikkoman. Also, it's better to spend a little extra time making sure it's all thoroughly mixed.

Great recipe. I used cod instead of mahi mahi as it's what I had on hand. I served this with rice and asparagus. The only change I might make next time is to add some spice to it.

The taste of this recipe is very good, however, the fish turns out quick gray in color.  I will make this again, but not for a dinner party.

Delish! Followed the recipe exactly. I did make only 2 pieces of fish but made the full recipe for the sauce. I would recommend making all the sauce...we also put it over our rice. Served with green beans also. Perfect.

Wow! This recipe is absolutely delicious. We live in Ecuador and get fresh dorado (mahi mahi) from the fish man. The ginger glaze is absolutely wonderful; and we often put some of it on the vegetables or rice that we make with it. I make the entire recipe for the glaze & refrigerate the remainder that I do not use because I usually cook for 2. It keeps for at least a week.

This was amazing! My first time making Mahi Mahi or this recipe. I tweeked the recipe a little cause i'm a dork and used the 4 fish fillet recipe when i only had 2 fillets being marinated. I did marinate in fridge for about 2 hours. Baked it until internal temperature was 140 flipped the fish once in the middle of cooking. Added a bit of cornstarch and water to the glaze to thicken the sauce. And as another commenter suggested I used pure maple syrup instead of honey cause that's what i had on hand and I used Red Wine Vinegar instead of the Balsamic cause I didn't have any. Also added a tsp of chili garlic paste to the sauce. YUMMO! Major! Will be making this again. Served it with red bell peppers and broccoli :D

This stuff is just great. Not only wonderful for most fish, but also makes quinoa very tasty!

I wanted it a bit thicker so I added some cornstarch(about 1-2tsp. Keep in mind, by doing this leftover Ginger Glaze gets a bit "jelly" like.

i enjoyed the recipe but think i would have liked it more if the flavors were more bold and pronounced.. i used dried ginger and garlic and wonder if that made a difference.. this was pretty good but nothing spectacular.. either way ty for the recipe

Yum!  The only change I made was baking instead of frying.  Will definitely make this again.

Maybe my proportions were off, but my glaze wasn't very glaze-y. I think maybe I had too much oil from the pan. I also believe the recipe says to cook the fish longer than you should. Fish does not take very long, you should go by your instincts. With all that aside, the flavor was very nice and sweet- perfect to calm a sweet tooth and to pair with rice. :)

Used dried ginger since I didn't have fresh.  Had to boil the marinade for quite some time before it turned into a glaze.  We thought the fish was bland without the glaze.  The glaze really made it better.  Not a 5 star recipe but worth making again when in a hurry.

I followed the recipe for the glaze, but used it on salmon since I couldn't find any mahi mahi. The ginger was a bit strong for our taste. My kids ate the fish only after removing the outer sauce layer.

Flavor was good.  Hubby thought the mahi mahi was a little fishy though. I wasn't in the mood for fish, so I was meh about it.  Kids liked it ok.

Made it just as prescibed here. Served with Kale (2 cloves of pressed garlic, cup of minced onions, teaspoon of cumin, pinch of salt) because it was the only green vegetable I had. It was amazingly delicious and beautiful with the contrast of the fish, sauce, and bright green kale. The recipe and the combination are keepers.

As others have said that  reviewed this recipe....while the sauce is delicious, it overpowers the delicate flavor of fresh Mahi. However, the sauce is delicious and I think would also be great on Salmon or Chicken.

I accidentally overcooked the fish but it was still delicious! The ginger really brought out the flavor. Used baked zucchini as a side dish. I'm definitely making this again sometime soon!

Was really good, like many others, no fresh ginger on hand. Use the dried, no problem. Really easy to prepare. Like any other fish, Don't over cook it.

The recipe was delicious, however, I think the marinade was a little overpowering for the fresh Mahi Mahi. I loved the flavor but probably marinated the fish too long. I'd like to try it on another fish or meat where it wouldn't soak in as much! Overall, though, I liked it quite a bit!

I was out of honey, so I used plum sauce instead.  It was an amazing substitute.  Then, when I was reducing the marinade, I decided to toss in a half a can of pineapples and a few Tablespoons of Mirin.  I make sushi often, so these ingredients are more common in my household than most others.  I chopped up some onions into the sauce as well.  It was so juicy and delicious.

Absolutely delicious. For the last year, I've been searching for a tasty honey ginger glaze to marinate fish. I've tried several. This is the only one that I will repeat - it's the right combination of tangy and sweet and it thickens into a lovely glaze. This is my new go-to recipe.

Deee-lish!  My husband is picky when eating fish, and he raved about this recipe.  My kids loved it, too!  I agree with another reviewer that next time I'll make more of the marinade to have to put on the fish when serving, but only because it's so delicious!  Great with steamed veggies, mashed potatoes, side salad...  mmmm

This recipe had a fantastic taste! I could not find Mahi Mahi in our grocery stores, so i used tilapia instead, and it was great! Perfect blend of sweet and savory, and also makes a very pretty presentation. Thanks for sharing!

Only change I made was to omit the oil and broil the fish instead of pan cooking.  The marinade thickened up nicely as a glaze but it lacked something to make it really memorable

Normally would have been more comfortable grilling mahi, but it is way too cold to be out there today.  Turned out to be great tasting and easy to put together.  Highly recommended!

I followed the suggestions of grilling the fish- it probably made it taste better.  My husband said it was ok, but not a recipe that he would want again. He ate a little then made a peanut butter sandwich.

This was delicious!  I replaced the olive oil with toasted sesame oil to add a bit more flavor and cooked it in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes (but this would depend on the size of your filets).  Hit with husband and one of my two children which is a win in my book!

I made this recipe exactly as directed with the exception of cooking the fish on the grill instead of on the stove.  It was easy, delicious, and my hubby said he could "eat this every day".  Definitely a keeper.  Served with Avocado Mango Salsa also on this site.

I don't like fish, but my doc gave me a choice between eating more fish or putting me on statins. This recipe is tasty enough that I don't mind eating it once a week, and easy enough with minimal clean-up that I don't mind making it.

I thought this was pretty good - think I should have wiped the pan out before putting in the sauce - the residual oil left in there seemed to interfere with the sauce reducing.  Flavor was good though and I would use this with a different fish - decided Mahi Mahi is not my favorite!

Very good and flavourful!  I opted out of adding salt as Kikkoman soy sauce is salty enough.  A must-try for all fish lovers out there!

This is an excellent recipe for fish. The sauce is delicious, very rich and decadent. My husband loved it and my picky 18 month old ate the fish  with enthusiasm. I also like there is minimal prep time, it makes things much easier for me on a weeknight, since I am working mama.

I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely delicious!!! I served it over fresh wilted spinach sautéed in garlic and sesame oil. I also pan fried the mahi in sesame oil for 3 minutes per side. It came out perfect!!! The marinade reduced and was poured over the filet. I used mirin and ponzu with the garlic and fresh ginger. I can't wait to make this again and possibly using different proteins.

This meal was so delicious!  I wanted the Mahi Mahi to really soak up the flavor so I let it sit in the mixture for 2-3 hours and was very pleased.  I served it over the Asian Rice on All Recipes (it's basically coconut rice) and garnished it with roasted coconut flakes and chopped up celery leaves (we were all out of parsley).

I substituted the mahi mahi for salmon, since I couldn't find mahi mahi at my grocer.  It was a great recipe, and very easy to make.  I even garnished with some sesame seeds to tie in that sesame flavor from the oil.  I think that in the future, I would use less balsamic vinegar, as it overpowered the dish just a little bit.

This recipe was easy and very tasty. I would double the glaze if you are making 4 fillets. I only made 2 and it was just the right amount. Wish I would have made 4 though because we both wanted more!

This was good, but not great. With all the reviews so wonderful, makes me think I should try it one more time.  I baked it, and didn't get the "glaze" so much.

Would have been 5, but I modified it for a authentic eastern taste. Used Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar, Toasted Sesame Oil, and Palm Sugar instead. Plus added some sesame seeds for texture. Delicious!!

The marinade was particularly good and I intend to try it with chicken and pork.  I bought sub-par fish (thin in bag at grocery) and feel sure with a better cut of fish this would be better.

Love this recipe as is. I've never grilled the mahi mahi, but I've pan fried it and it's quite delicious... can't wait for a nice warm day to pull out the grill and try it that way :)

This was truly amazing. It was my last atempt to achive a great tasting Mahi Mahi dish because it's taste is quite bland without the perfect seasonnings. I used maple syrup instead of honey because I didn't have honey on hand. It was a perfect alternative. I was in heaven! My husband who is very difficult really liked it. Also, I see why people say they used it to marinate chicken/beef/shrimps: it tastes exactly like teriyaki sauce served at my favorite japanese restaurant Thank you so much for this receipe, it's now a staple in my house!

Very tasty!! Easy to prepare ahead and allow to marinate for hours as the fish thaws. Reduction is very tasty. Add some asparagus, lemon greek potatoes with a salad and you have a great meal!

Reviewing on behalf of my husband since I don't eat fish.  Made this for him last night.  He liked the flavors, but I think I reduced the sauce too much so it turned into a burnt, taffy like glaze.  Would be nice if the recipe noted how long to reduce the glaze to avoid my problem.  Not an expert chef by any means, so maybe it was just my lack of experience.  Went well with brown rice and edamame.

I made this and it was wonderful.  The only change was that I grilled it in a mesh pan on the gas grill for 4 minutes per side.  I have never been a fish fan, but this has made me one, try it, you'll love it!

I'm not a big mahi mahi fan but my husband likes it and he sent me a link to this recipe.  I made it tonight and it was pretty good.  I was short on time so I substituted dry garlic powder and ginger powder for fresh...next time I will try the fresh stuff.  I also halved the recipe since it is just the two of us.

I've never rated a recipe before but I had to comment on this one.  We just finished dinner and there's not a leftover to spare.  Yummy with rice and sauteed veggies.  I made extra glaze to pour over the veggies and the kids ate it up.  Thanks for submitting this!

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I used about 1 teaspoon of olive oil instead of vegetable oil to pan fray the fish. The ginger was very strong for my taste, so I think next time I will cut the amount to 1/2 teaspoon.

I made it as written.  I would tone the honey down a second time, as it was a little sweet; however, the fish was delicious!  Would be great with a side of buttered rice and snap peas.

Tasty recipe for Mahi Mahi. The cooking time is perfect, fish wasn't dry and sauce was delicious. My version came out a little on a spicy side though.  I made it with chili-garlic paste instead of ginger (didn't have any on hand), used some of the sauce on steamed broccoli. Used foil on grill as another  reviewer suggested, what an excellent idea!

What a wonderful recipe.  Made exactly as written and it was awesome, easy, fast and delicious!  What more could you want?  It would also be great on chicken or pork.  My whole family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe that will help me add more fish to my diet.

Just one more 5 star review for this recipe.  I made it as directed and it was delicious.  My daughter who hates fish even liked it.  Thanks for a good, fast recipe that's full of flavor.

Really good!  I used Tilapia and Mahi filets, and grilled them, while the sauce reduced on the side burner.  Both were excellent.  The Balsamic marinade/glaze didn't seem to have enough Ginger, or that flavor didn't seem to compete with the vinegar.  Will double the ginger amount next time

Pretty good. The sauce wound up being quite thin, like soy sauce so next time I would thicken it with some corn starch.

I made this tonight for dinner.  My husband is not very fond of fish but we've been adding it more to our diet.  I prepared this as written (other than 1/4 tsp dried ginger instead of fresh).  My husband took one bite and said it was by far the best fish I've prepared so far.  I would even serve this simple dinner to company.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Cooking time is too long, and I don't think frozen fish cuts it, but the sauce is great.  I'd try 3min one side 4 min skin side next time

This was good.  Made with salmon- no Mahi available.  Put the fish in the marinade for about 30 minutes.  Grilled the salmon.  Boiled and reduced the marinade, poured over the fish and brown rice.  Had good flavor...had to leave the table to take a call, when I retuned, tasted the rice- so much more flavor.  Should have let the marinade set a bit before pouring over rice and fish for the flavors to develop.  Easy and quick to prepare with basic pantry ingredients.

This dish was amazing and those are my husband's words! Will definitely make again. We didn't have any honey so I used pure maple syrup which I think made the dish even better. We also served it with garlic/olive oil couscous and it was all to die for.

This had to be the fastest, easiest and best tasting glaze ever.  I would like to try this on chicken as well because it is just too good to just have when I make fish which isn't often.  No need to shop for these ingredients since I already had them all.  The only thing I substituted was ground ginger and it was still amazing.

This was delicious!  I give it a 4.5 - it's a 4 without the glaze, but a definite 5 with it!  I can't wait to try it on salmon!  I just now realize I forgot to add the olive oil in the marinade - didn't miss it though.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A very good, relatively simple mahi mahi recipe.  Although I think it could be tweaked into a 5-star recipe, alas I am not experienced enough to make this happen.

This was pretty good.  It was flavorful.  I grilled ours.  It enhanced the flavor to pour the leftover boiled marinade over the fish before serving it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS. I fried the non-skin side of the fish first for a couple of minutes, then baked it while I made the sides. Wonderful! Thanks so much for sharing!

OMG.. this was so delish! My brother who does not eat fish other than salmon even loved this. This was my first time using fresh ginger and I was pleasantly surprised. This dish was easy to prepare yet tasted like it took hours. I will surely be making this again. I served with ginger glazed carrots and crusty french bread.

Loved this! Used dried ginger and replaced 1 T of soy sauce with lime juice (not sure what possessed me to but it sounded good). Also added some more brown sugar and corn starch to thicken when reducing. Would be good on any fish (especially salmon) as well as chicken or pork.

Fantastic flavor!  I marinated the fish, then wrapped the fish in aluminum foil and put it on the grill.  I had tripled the reciped for the glaze and I reduced the remaining glaze per the recipe just to have extra sauce.  We loved it and are going to try it with chicken or pork.

I made this dish today for my girlfriend and her dad and it was phenominal. I didn't boil the marinade down to a glaze consistency though, so the fish was still very tasty with a mild flavor of the marinade. Definately a keeper.

Great recipe for mahi mahi.  I used 1/2 t. dry ginger and broiled the fish rather than fried it.  Great recipe!

I used Tilapia fillets and followed the rest of the recipe correctly. This was great! I served it over brown rice with some of the balsalmic dressing poured over the top.

My husband and I absolutely loved this ginger glaze.  I did use tilapia instead of mahi mahi though.  My two younger kids thought it was great but my oldest thought the taste was a little too strong.  Overall it was delicious!

Easy and amazing!  Followed the recipe as written, using frozen mahi mahi filets from Costco.  The reduced sauce poured over the finished fish is soooooo good.  Served with jasmine rice and baby bok choy.

A big hit with my dinner guests.  I grilled the fish instead of frying.  I will keep this recipe for future use.  The marinade/sauce would be good with pork, chicken, salmon.

This is a good recipe for fish. I let it marinade for about two hours and the flavor was good but seems to missing something. May tweak it next time.

This was so good. We used light agave nectar instead of the honey because I can't have honey and it was still good. I even put the sauce over my broccoli.

The marinade alone lends a light asian flair to grilled mahi; however, the reduced glaze slightly overwhelms the delicate flavor of the fish.  Perhaps using rice wine vinegar in lieu of the balsamic might tone it down a bit.  I will use this again to marinate fish, but use the marinade/glaze on something a bit more substantial, like grilled chicken.  Overall, a recipe worth repeating -- thanks.

So good and Soooo easy. This amt of sauce would be good for 3 servings of fish. We loved it! The only change I made was 1 tb. of cider vinegar since I didn't have balsamic.

Incredibly delicious. Took the comments from one of the "most popular" reviews and added lime juice and a little hot pepper sauce to the marinade since we like things citrusy and hot. Then I had hubs cook it on the grill and use some excess marinade while grilling. The honey helped give it just a hint of crispiness. Served over a bed of mixed lettuces and spinach sprinkled with sliced almonds for a super healthy yet delicious and tasty summer dinner. Absolute perfection I tell you!

It had a pretty good flavor.  I used Crappie instead of Mahi Mahi so that is probably why it didn't turn out perfect.  It was definitely decent and I'd try it again with Mahi Mahi like it says.

Delicious. Flavorful glaze but not too heavy. I added more garlic and used crushed ginger from the asian market instead of fresh. I marinaded the fish while it was defrosting and it didn't take fishy at all.  I served it with plain couscous with the glaze as a sauce and wilted kale tossed with a little bit of sauce.   A restaurant worthy meal, will make again!

Yum!  I made this first as an appetizer, since it was my first time cooking this type of fish.  Yum, Yum, Yum.  It totally trumped my main dish.  One suggestion is to double up on the sauce.

Quite good!  I baked this with some veggies and they soaked up the flavor.  I didn't have enough regular honey, so I mixed in some raspberry whipped honey.  It turned out great, and other honey flavors would be fun to try!

Mahi Mahi is not in season right now so I used this recipe with tilapia and baked it. It turned out AMAZING! Thank you so much for this recipe. I've made it a few times already and it will stay with me for life!

Very easy recipe!! I really enjoyed the glaze... I did change a few things but nothing drastic.  I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger and balsamic vinegerette since those are the things that I had on hand.

Oh my!  I doubled the ginger on this recipe and pretty much followed the rest of the instructions exactly.  This one is a definate keeper!  I grilled it on tin foil out on the grill.  I usually don't like basalmic vinear because it is so strong.  But this recipe balances it perfectly with the honey/soy and you don't really get an over powering of anything, except the ginger, which was perfect.

This glaze was absolutely delicious! I did bake the fish at 350 for about 14 minutes, and it came out full of flavor. I will make this again and again. The only thing I would say is be careful with the fresh ginger, the flavor is very strong.

outstanding blend of flavors, just enough to ginger to make it interesting, could have used a bit more garlic for my taste. I can imagine adding more things to the marinade/glaze. But it's near perfect as it is. Thank you!

Cooking Mahi Mahi for the first time, this recipe sounded appetizing so I tried it. Went to the cupboard and what do you know no honey. Being resourceful I tried Sorghum at 2 Tbsp and followed the rest of the recipe. We loved it, only have to be careful as this formulation can make it a little too crispy if left too long on one side. Thanks for a great recipe!

Best fish recipe I've ever had.  It matches up against any fish resturant I've been to.  I happened to have ginger honey available, so I didn't use the fresh ginger.  I also didn't use salt and cut down the soy sauce but 2/3.  I only did this because I'm on a low salt diet.  I made it on the stove this time, next time I'm going to try it on the grill.

THE BEST!  I steamed my frozen tilapia in a zip lock steam bag for 3 min. (always turns out perfectly cooked fish).  Then I poured the reduced sauce on top.  It was exceptional!  We will try it on grilled chichen next time.  Thank you.

I didn't have Mahi Mahi available to me at my local grocery store, so I used Tilapia instead.  The sauce was very good, the fish was tender, and I can imagine how good this marinade would be on a grilled tuna steak as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I would probably rate it at 4.5, but it's purely personal tastes. The sauce for this recipe is awesome, but I'm not the biggest fan of mahi mahi. My fiance, on the other hand, loved it. I just thought there was a little too much fishiness still coming out. Honestly that could have been my bad fish-picking abilities, so hopefully I wil make this again and redeem itself. Also, it got dry on the edges pretty quickly. I think I just need some practice...

This was INCREDIBLE.  I made it for an anniversary dinner and even surprised myself.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with steamed snap peas and carrots.  For an inexperienced cook like myself, this was manageable, and it came out great.  Thank you!!

Really good - I baked the fish for health reasons - in little foil packets and then opened them at the end to crisp them up.  Came out great!

This was really good! My husband and both kids enjoyed it. I used dry ginger instead of fresh because it's what I had on hand. I also grilled the fish instead of frying making a foil pouch and basting several times with the sauce. Will definitely make this again.

Can you say, delicious! I prepared this as indicated and wouldn't change a thing.  I served the mahi mahi over a portion of quinoa.  The quinoa soaked up the glaze nicely and made for a tasty texture with the fish. Enjoy!

LOVED this sauce. However, I used chicken instead of Mahi Mahi.   I doubled the marinade and set half aside to top the chicken after it was cooked.  I marinaded the chicken in the sauce for a few hours.  My husband grilled them and they were fantastic and very lean.

I used this on salmon because it was on sale. And I doubled the sauce recipe so I could use it to cover the grilled veggies and linguine that I served with the dish.   It.was.fabulous!

The frying temperature was a little high - my fish got a little charred on one side very quickly.  There wasn't as much flavor as I'd like, but it was a quick, easy meal on a weeknight.  I served steamed vegetables and white rice with the Mahi Mahi and my fish-hating boyfriend ate it without complaint, which is all I can ask.  I probably won't make it again without modifying the recipe.

Excellent marinade. I have had Mahi Mahi a couple other times before and this has been the best so far. I love how it takes away the fishy taste. Thank you!

Made this true to the recipe and the sauce is overpowering - it kills the mahi-mahi and the soy sauce makes it absolutely salty while the ginger is very strong.  It smelled great, easy to make and sounded fantastic - just did not go off well.

I found this to be incredibly easy and delicious.  My only adjustment is that I didn't add any ginger.  The flavor was still tangy.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

I love this recipe! I tried it with frozen Mahi at first, and it did burn quickly but I blame that on my inexperience with cooking fish (My dad always cooked the fish). Regardless of the burn, it was still very good. I think the sauce/marinade is very versatile and so far I have made it with the recommended Mahi, wings, shrimp, and tonight I'm trying it with chicken! I prefer to bake or grill to reduce fat, and is perfect served with brown rice and sugar snap peas!

This was ok. My glaze wasn't really a glaze. I think next time I'll add less vinegar and add more ginger. I couldn't taste it. But it's a good starter recipe.

Excellent, both Bryan and Megan like it.  I put half a fillet in my salad.  Very good.

I made this with Tilapia...as there was no Mahi Mahi at my grocery store.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, it turned out just wonderfully.

This was good and I'll make it again, but we weren't floored by it.  It was a nice change of pace since I tend to make fish the same way everytime!

Used brown sugar since I didn't have honey.  Glaze overcooked quickly.  Will try again with honey and will probably try baking instead of frying.

Great recipe. I don't think the reduce glaze is necessary because the fish has a great taste without the added reduction sauce.

This is an excellent recipe. The sauce thickened beautifully and tasted awesome. Perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The presentation of the fish was superb. My husband loved it, as did I. Will definitley make again and again.

Though store bought Mahi works just as well, I first tried this recipe with fresh caught Key West Mahi. The marinade doesn't overpower the fish so it's flavor is the main attraction. Pairs nicely with Jasmine rice.

Fantastic!  So easy!  I used dried ginger and minced garlic from a jar so I wouldn't have to make a trip.  Also used frozen mahi mahi from Sam's club, but even the ingredients not being fresh, I can't imagine this tasting any better.  It is a lifesaver for a quick, unique break from baked chicken breasts.

This was pretty good but I wasn't hugely impressed. I was expecting the mahi to be a bit carmelized maybe and it never did. Maybe I didn't marinate it long enough? I like that it is easy and I will probably try it again.

Loved it!!  I cook for a family of 10 regularly, and it can be hard to find something everyone likes.  This was sooo good, we were lucky a neighbor blessed us with fresh mahimahi and I had to use it right away.  Made the marinade how recipe asked, and realized we had more fish than sauce... so I added another big glug of shoyu/soy sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar, tripled the garlic & ginger, and some crushed red pepper.  Followed recipe for cooking, it was beautiful, the outside nicely crisped w/ high heat, the inside tender & moist and very flavorful.  Still needed a lil more sauce, so I chopped up a little fresh pineapple, with juice, juice of 1 lime, 1 orange, 1 tbsp brown sugar, salt, pepper, more fresh ginger, and 2 dashes hot sauce.  Boiled it, poured it on top the fish after cooking....magnifico!

I really liked this recipe! I recommend doubling the garlic and ginger and marinating in an air tight bag for more than the recommended 20 min (I did 45 min). I also added a pinch of Kosher salt to the marinade.

This was excellent, my hubby always groans when I say were having fish. But he raved about this one. So did the kids. I did use frozen Mahi Mahi from SAMs, broiled it and heated the sauce in a pan.

This was an easy and very delicious recipe, and I pretty much followed it exactly. The only change that I will make the next time is to only put a spoonful of the simmered sauce on top of the fish; this time, I dumped all of the sauce on top, which was too much.

WOW!!  This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I decided to exclude the honey.  I used Extra Virgin Olive oil instead of Vegetable oil, to make it a bit healthier.  It was so quick, easy, and no mess!  The fish was so tasty, I cannot wait to cook this for my husband!

I made it for a small dinner party we had and being my first time to make fish it was perfect! The flavor is bold and delicious! I should have put the extra sauce over the fish but still had just the right amount! Paired it with Chateau St. Michelle Riesling and broccoli. Perfect!

This glaze is one of my new favorites. I use ground ginger instead of the fresh and leave out the salt, but other than that, the glaze is really good as is.   Also, when I make it on the Mahi Mahi, I bake it instead of frying it.  It also tastes fantastic on chicken and shrimp or thrown in on stir-fried vegetables.  The glaze is pretty versatile, which is good, but the taste is what makes it amazing!

Made this last night for the first time.  A friend gave us the recipe and I was quite surprised to find the EXACT recipe on Allrecipes!  It was absolutely wonderful.  We used Amberjack.  The only change was I doubled the recipe.  Also, be careful grating ginger - I ruined two nails :(

This fish is delicious, and the glaze its perfect for it! However, it comes out if I salt the fish before marinading it - the soy sauce makes it plenty salty. Goes great with some mashed butter potatoes and steamed asparagus :)

Wow! This is really good. The only change I made is to sub 1/2 t ground ginger for the fresh.

WOW! this would be great on Chicken too. The reduced marinade was wonderful spooned over the mahi-mahi. Marinated longer just cause and baked the mahi-mahi. Finger Licking Good!

Not a winner for me, my husband thought it was "pretty good".  I'm more of a fan of lemon type sauces on fish so I knew this was going to be a change for me going into it.  I thought the soy was a little overpowering, if we made it again I may try to reduce the soy amount and increase the honey.

Awesome marinade!  I used salmon fillets and stuck pretty close to the original recipe.  Used 3 cloves of garlic and maybe double the ginger for an extra punch.  We grilled the salmon and served it over couscous, with the leftover marinade that I had reduced on the stovetop.  This one definitely goes into the regular rotation.

An excellent recipe.  I've cooked Mahi Mahi several different ways and this is my all time favorite.   I followed someone's suggestion and served this on top of a bed of sauteed snap peas, green beans and mushrooms.  The glaze enhanced the flavor of the veggies as well.

You nailed it!!! I grilled  mine rather than the skillet.....  I marinated it per instructions then placed it on the grill with medium heat. I place the skin directly on the grill with mesquite chips....when skin turned black and hard I removed it......YUM YUM.... Some call this fish on the half shell....Try it.....You will be impressed..

My family loved this!  I forgot to salt and pepper the fish prior to marinating and it tasted wonderful.  This may have taken care of others who said this dish was too salty.  I was also out of fresh ginger so I used 1/2 tsp of powdered ginger.  I will definately make this again.

Friends loved the sauce and plan to use it on other fish!  Turned out well.  Baked it at 400 degrees like others recommended and was done perfectly.  Also let it marinate for 4 hours and wasn't overly done at all.

I couldn't find any fresh mahi mahi in my area so I used tilapia instead and this was absolutely delicious.  My husband raved about it for two days!  This glaze will become a family favorite, by far my favorite way to serve fish now.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.

This was very good and I will prepare it again.  However, I must have reduced the sauce too much as it turned into a tar upon sitting and needed to soak the pan in order to clean up.  I made this again and it was excellent. It is now in my receipe book.

Absolutely delicious!  I made some for my family and some friends and they all loved it.  Even our children loved it!  They asked for seconds, which they never do with fish.  I doubled the marinade and left it marinating in the fridge longer than 20 minutes (mostly because I had so many other things to do!).  Still, it was great!

Excellent Recipe, unfortunately our grocery store ran out of Mahi Mahi so we used Salmon fillets.  Also, we used more ginger than instructed because its one of our favorite ingredients.  Easy preparation, easy cooking and easy clean up.  We will definitely be making this again soon!

This recipe is fantastic. Just the right blend of ingredients. I followed the recipe just as it is and will make this again. I make something very similar with the exception of the balsamic vinegar and ginger. I love how the balsamic vinegar and ginger round out the flavors of the other ingredients and provides depth to the total flavor. I would have given it more stars but 5 is the limit.

Easy & delicious..followed the recipe exactly, except that I used swordfish instead of mahi mahi (my grocer was sold out).  To compliment the dish I made white rice and ginger/orange flavored snap peas.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used cider vinegar and dried ginger as I didn't have balsamic vinegar or fresh ginger.  I would also double the recipe as the sauce is so good and I would like more.  I served this with jasmine rice and salad.  Everyone loved it!

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish!  I only had 10 minutes to marinate but we poured the extra sauce over the fish as we grilled it.  Also, I didn't have fresh ginger so I had to use powdered.  This still turned out fantastic!!!   Thanks for the super recipe Decodiana!

WOW!!! This is the first time I have cooked Mahi-Mahi, what a wonderful steak fish. This recipe will be hard to beat. It does not need any help I just had to add it my recipe box so why not give a review. Perfect as is, follow the recipe and enjoy.

Great dish -- the only thing I changed was the method of cooking.  I used my griddle and sprayed each side of the fish with vegetable oil Pam.  Therefore, I was able to cook the marinade on the stovetop while the fish was on the griddle.

this was a fantastic dish.  be sure to keep an eye on the fish, as it tends to cook a bit faster than you might think!

This was a fantastic dish paired with Vouvray.  My children liked it also.  The sauce tastes like teriyaki.  I will be using the sauce on chicken and sliced sirloin.  I followed it exactly but doubled it due to the 48oz of Mahi I made.  One tip: make sure to clean out the pan if you need to fry more than one batch.

I love fish but we seldom have it because my husband isn't a big fan. I made this and he loved it. Asks for it at least once a week, and always eats any leftovers for lunch the next day.

Good dish. The sauce gets a A++. I loo forward to trying the sauce out on other things. Next time I will make more too, because my hubby was rather disappointed in not having seconds.

I used this glaze with both mahi mahi and tilapia, both baked and on the foil grill-boat as suggested, with dried ginger.  I LOVE this glaze! It's wonderful with rice.

I used frozen mahi mahi in a box from Costco and these really turned out great! The glaze is awesome and it really takes no time at all! Sure, frying always makes a bit of a mess, but that has nothing to do with the rating of this recipe! 5 stars all the way! I made it for my husband and he was very impressed. :) Thank you!

Just made this recipe and maybe I did something wrong, but it wasn't as great as I expected.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but the flavor was just "off."  Tempted to try it again though - I love Mahi Mahi and this sounds like a great recipe.

I thought this was pretty bad. It didnt cook the way it says it does and I didnt feel like the fish had any flavor. The glaze was alright but it wasnt great either. My boyfriend wasnt crazy about it either. Maybe this one just wasnt for us.

I followed this recipe except I used salmon instead and also used no garlic. It was delicious with just the right amount of bitter and sweet taste.  It was amazingly delicious.  I still have not yet been turned wrong by this site and its members!

I loved this recipe... if it were only me I would rate it a 5, but hubby thought it was just ok... of course he is not as fond of "sweet" main dishes as I am.  The fish was so mild, and I also let it "blacken" a little, but I thought that was part of what made it so GOOD.  Also I doubled the sauce, and I feel it really was not necessary.  I had a lot left over and ended up dumping it out, which made me kind of sad, because it tasted so wonderful I hated to see it go to waste.   I will definitely make this again!!

LOVED this!  So good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except since I didn't have ginger root I did as one reviewer suggested and used 1/2 tsp of ginger powder.  I served with rice and another allrecipes item, Greek Vegetables.  A perfect meal!

Awesome recipe!!!  Both of my girls (ages 11 & 16), plus my husband, loved it!!  We've been trying a different fish every weekend and this one fit the bill.  I grilled my fish and did the sauce on the stove instead.

Really good, I didn't have ginger so I left that out and used a ginger coconut sauce bought at Whole Foods on top, which I heated in a saucepan with mango chunks and then served on top with fresh mango on the side.

I thought this glaze was fantastic!  Super easy and tasted like something I wold get at my favorite Japanese restaurant.  Sort of teriyaki-ish.

Delicious! I used tilapia and had to use brown sugar as I was out of honey. Added just a touch of chili garlic sauce to give it a kick. Served it with veggies and potstickers, and used the sauce for dipping.

Absolutely delicious!  I served the mahi mahi with pineapple slices and Hawaiian sweet rolls.  The sauce is amazing too! so dont discard it after you're done marinating the fish.  I doubled the amount of sauce as did other viewers.  Made it another time with chicken instead of fish.  The chicken was dry even though I marinated it for 2 hours.  So, definitely will stick with the mahi mahi :)

The flavor was really good.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used dried.  Fresh ginger and more garlic would have been better.  Also, I'd double the quantity of sauce ingredients.  There wasn't much for the fish to marinate in.  Grilling or baking the fish probably would have been better too.  The honey tends to burn/stick a bit.  My kids and hubby liked it too, which is a miracle!  Will make again...

The best recipe for fish, my hubby loved it.I used Salmon instead of Maui Mahi and I changed the marinade time for about 2 hours. I then broiled it in a pan that I lined with foil for easy clean up. 5 minutes on each side of the fish instead of pan frying it. No mess I loved it.

This is so easy, fast and delicious! There are not too many ingredients and most of which will most likely be found in your home already. I didn't even need to go to the store because I already had everything. And after reading the review that said it was 6 WW pts I love it even more. I am definitely adding this recipe to my favorites!

I use this recipe over and over, but I only give it four stars because I could never get my head around the balsamic, I always use rice vinegar or rice wine vinegar. It's great because it's so simple to make and the flavors are wonderful and intense. I recently made the sauce and basted a roast duck with it - WOW! It goes great with any firm white fish (My kids dunk their fish sticks in the sauce)if Mahi isn't in the budget.

Yummy !
I'm not particularly a fish sort of person, so I guess this review has a bit of a bias, but it was really yummy. Next time I might put more honey and/or ginger. Cooked at 400 for 20 minutes, came out perfect.

This was great! My company loved it and it was easy to make. Dried ginger worked fine and I made extra glaze. My only recommendation would be to place the cooked fish in heated oven to keep hot while heating the final glaze. It cooled a bit even though it was wrapped in foil. Other than that a great success.

Thought the recipe was delicious.  I don't like fish but my husband does so I try to find a few recipes he can enjoy.  He loved this one.  The onlyt hing is that with the temp and the time cooking, it almost burned.  I'll keep the temp a little lower next time.

It was ok.  I love ginger and have been really looking forward to this recipe so I was shocked that I didn't think this was the greatest thing on the planet.  The only difference I did was that I made with tilapia since I didn't have mahi mahi.  I know that would have made a tiny difference but plenty of other reviewers have made with various kinds of fish and all thought it was far better than I seemed to think.

This recipe is wonderful!  I prepared it exactly as directed and used frozen (thawed) mahi mahi from Sam's.  I reduced the glaze and left it on the side rather than coat the mahi mahi just incase I didn't like it.  Once I tried it I instantly put it on the fish.  My husband liked the flavor of the marinated fish so much he said it didn't even need the glaze.  This recipe is very easy and tastes excellent!

I did not (or would not) make any changes to this recipe and it was wonderful.  My husband raved about this meal for days.  This is in my list to do again. I used ginger from a jar. Great flavor!

Very easy to make, using ingredients I keep on hand.  Hubby and I both liked it, but it's just not outstanding, flavor-wise.
I served it over rice cooked with leeks, peas, and carrots, and topped it with a pineapple slice.  Made a nice dinner; thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a family favorite! I actually use salmon instead of mahi mahi and it turns out great. The taste of the fish really compliments the glaze flavors. I make this dish about once a week!

An excellent recipe that I've made time and time again since I first made it. Play around with portions of soy sauce and vinegar until you find a combination you like the best! I highly recommend using fresh ginger; I've tried this with both powdered and fresh and there is no doubt in my mind the fresh flavor is far superior.

And not only does it work great on Mahi Mahi, but I've used this sauce with mixed veggies, green beans, and other fish. The Mahi Mahi steaks are still the best. This should definitely be in any simple chef's repertoire.

One of my favorite ways to prepare mahi mahi. Great flavor and easy to fix. I usually serve it with a salad and a side of rice pilaf.

I'm actually really surprised that I didn't like this recipe and feel like maybe I did something wrong, but I followed it to a T except for I used ground ginger rather than fresh (admittedly, could have made a huge difference), and I grilled the fish outside. I thought the glaze was very overpowering for the fish and too strong, and didn't even like the flavor of it that much, let alone the strength. From the impressions of my mom and stepmom, I don't think they were very impressed either.
I guess if I made it again I would cut down on the glaze rather than doubling it as some people have suggested, and I might wouldn't even bother marinating the fish first. I didn't think this strong stickiness went at all with delicate fish, sorry.

All I can say is YUM.  We actually use this recipe with tilapia and even better if I can find it, with halibut.  I haven't actually tried it with Mahi Mahi but it is great on anything!  A regular in our rotation now.

The first time I made this with mahi mahi.  It was so delicious! I figured it would be good on anything, so I tried salmon and OMGosh, to die for!!!  We even grilled the salmon after marinading it and then topped it with the sauce.

Fabulous!  This was my first time  cooking mahi mahi and I won't be looking for another recipe.  The only change was that I used ground ginger since that is what I had on hand.  I loved the sauce and agree with other reviewers stating that it's versatile.  Will definitely make again and share with others.

This recipes was super tasty and sooooo easy!  I made up the marinade this morning and let mine marinate and finish thawing in the fridge throughout the day.  The taste was nice and mild.  It didn't overpower the  mahi at all.  I served it with ramen noodle salad, snow peas, and a side of the sauce for dipping.  The kiddos ate it right up as if it were chicken nuggets from that "Mc" place!

Delicious!  Very easy to prepare... i ended up marinating the mahi mahi for about 45 minutes and the flavor was just perfect.  I had 2lbs worth of mahi, so i grilled half and sauteed the other half.  Grilling made the fish a tad bit dry, but was still very tasty!

I took the other reviews & my family wasn't very impressed.  We like fish, but do not love it.  We chose to bake it bc I don't fry anything b/c of the fat etc.  I baked it b/c another person said they had, but it wasn't very good. We ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Too sweet for my taste.  I would back off on the honey.  Make sure you get a high quality filet, this marinade will not compensate for average Mahi Mahi.

This dish is absolutely wonderful! After finding this recipe over a year ago I have made it countless times! Marinade makes a perfect glaze that compliments the mahi mahi perfectly--I make extra sauce and serve it over asian vegetables. Thanks!

I tried this recipe last night for the first time.  Even my non fish loving daughter loved this!  Great very favorful marinade.  I think the fresh ginger and balsamic vinegar really make it.  I will use this marinade on other fish as well as chicken.  Very easy.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Really, really good—no complaints. I did not pour the glaze over the fish in the end—and I thought the fish had enough ginger flavor from marinating—but I did pour it over basmati rice on the side. Yummy!

This was delicious! I used catfish because that was the only thing they had at my little neighborhood grocery store and it was still very good. I may try grilling this next time.

I figured with 500 reviews I couldn't go wrong with this recipe!  All I have are two words HOLY MOLY!  This was absolutely FANTASTIC!  By far one of the best dishes I've made in a long time!  We had company for dinner and there was not one speck left!  I did double the marinade/sauce because we like a lot of it.  I served this with rice and steamed mixed veggies.  Thank you for posting this...it's a keeper and I will definitely be making it again!

This dish was fantastic!!!  I only had 14.4 ounces of mahi but still used the measurements for the recipe as is for 4 servings (following other reviews advice of doubling the sauce).  My changes: I doubled the marinating time to 40 minutes - turning once.  I didn't rub the fish with salt and pepper.  I doubled the garlic and eyed the fresh ginger but I think I used more than it called for.  I chose to broil the fish in the oven for 12 minutes in a metal baking dish covered with aluminum foil.  Then I reduced the sauce in a skillet.  I served the fish over jasmine rice and spooned the sauce over it.  This was definitely the best fish I've made yet and I will absolutely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not much into eating fish but I'm trying to eat healthier these days and I tried this recipe.  I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for the fact that I just didn't care much for the fish (my own problem) but my husband who is a big fish eater really loved this dish and would eat it again for sure.  Next time I am in the mood to try fish, I'll probably try this one again.

This is an excellent recipe!  I'm NOT the primary cook of the house and I was looking for a nice meal to make for Mothers Day.  I decided to do a Hawaiian themed meal.  I made this, Maui Onion Salad Dressing, and a Hawaiian Banana Bread.  This was the star of the meal.  My kids are afraid of any food with any sort of black coating.  The sugars in the marinade blackened while cooking, but they ate it anyway.
The only thing I did differently was that I rotated the Mahi Mahi fillets while marinating.  
I used the frozen fillets from Sams Club (about $5 a pound, 2 pound bag) which made it a very affordable meal.
I was a mothers day hero!  Thanks!

I made this as written but for two mahi mahi fillets (I wanted it to be saucy). Oh, I also marinated it for a couple of hours. Despite the fact I overcooked it (my bad), it turned out good. Nice combination of flavors. Served it with noodles and "Snow Peas Oriental." Thanks!

Great on frozen fish, as it totally obscures the taste of the fish.  I think this could be improved by cutting back a little on the balsamic vinegar and increasing the soy sauce.

This was so simple and easy, and it tasted like i spent 3 years in cooking school! I followed the recipe just like it said and it turned out lovely. I served it with jasmine rice that I mixed with green onions and cilantro, and a side of bok choy. Delicious!

This dish was excellent! I made few changes... instead of olive oil I used seasame oil, and instead of frying it in vegetable oil i used peanut oil. Instead of fresh ginger I used powdered ginger, and instead of soy sauce I used a store bought ginger garlic marinade by La Choy. I marinated the fish for about 30 minutes. When I went to reduce the marinade, I noticed it was really thick (the store bought stuff has a much thicker consistency than plain soy sauce) so I added a couple of tablespoons of orange juice. This fish was amazing! Didn't even need the extra sauce - I used that on top of some brown rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

Not having Mahi Mahi on hand, I used Blue Hake instead.  I doubled the recipe to have extra sauce for the rice that I served with the fish.  I do think the sauce was too overpowering for the Blue Hake, and I plan to try it again with salmon.

The glaze was great, but it really overpowered the mahi.  I think I'll try it with a stronger fish next time.

This is delicious! I used tilapia instead of mahi mahi, and I marinated for probably 30 min on each side.  I loved it!  I burned the glaze, so that wasn't good, but it's great without the glaze and I think I'll use it as a marinade for any white fish from now on (as I can't make the glaze!).  Thanks!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!!  I didn't follow the directions exactly because I TOTALLY forgot to marinate this for 20 minutes prior to cooking.  OOPS!!!  Next time I will because I know it will taste even better if I do.  I did follow the recipe exact and didn't double anything.  I might add a bit more ginger, but it was perfect.  I even used the sauce to saute vegetables.  It was great!!  Will make this again REALLY soon.

this recipe is absolutely fantastic! i followed all of the proportions - the only thing i changed was that i doubled the sauce, added WAY more ginger and a little more garlic, forgot to add salt and pepper (after eating it i feel like salt & pepper would actually take away from the dish) and marinated the mahi mahi for two days instead of 20 minutes. the person i made it for said it was one of the most delicious things he's ever eaten, and i agree!

I prepared this recipe last week and loved it. We served it to some guests, who really liked it as well. 

My glaze turned quite dark, darker than I think it was supposed to; I probably did something wrong. I used a pretty large pan to cook thes in, perhaps the liquid was too shallow and reduced too quickly. I'll watch that more closely next time.  

Other than that, we loved it. I'll absolutely make it again.

Pretty good.  I may have marinated the fish too long, but it turned out alright.  The sauce is wonderful, but the fish is rather bland without the extra sauce on top.  I'm thinking to save time I should just bake the fish and pour the sauce on top after reducing it.

This was a very good recipe.  It had wonderful flavor but next time I prepare this recipe, I will reduce the balsamic vinegar to 2 TSP.  The balsamic was slightly overpowering and I did agree with another reviewer, it does not need additional salt.  I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

I'm not much of a fish eater, but OH MY GOODNESS this was awesome!  I personally disagree that the glaze was too potent, but that could be due to the face that I'm not a fish fan. My boyfriend loved it, and said it was the best meal I've ever made.  I made this dish with some organic quinoa, and a side of avocado, tomato, and corn salsa. It was to die for! Enjoy!

It didn't help that my fish was slightly burnt however I did not like this. My mom liked it but I wouldn't finish it. It wasn't anything special and it had a funny aftertaste. Will not make again.

This was really good. The marinade was FABULOUS though. I think next time I make it I'll just serve the fish right out of the pan and skip reducing the marinade for a glaze. It was just a little overpowering, as mahi mahi is a pretty delicately flavored fish. Thanks for the post!

Very good.  I did double the garlic and ginger since I thought the soy sauce might overpower the sauce.  I did cook my fish a little longer than 6 minutes since they were really thick fillets.  I will def be making this again...maybe next time try it on chicken or porkchops!!

This is a fast and easy recipe for fish.  I added in some extra ginger and garlic to make it more spicy. My husband and I both really enjoyed the mahi served with brown rice and broccoli sauteed with garlic and soy sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I didn't have any honey so I subbed 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I boiled the left over marinade with a little chicken broth til it reduced by atleast half for sauce. Very flavorful and still light!

Good stuff.  I don't like any fish except catfish, but tried a little taste of Mahi Mahi while out with some friends and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm in the middle of eating this dinner right now and it's fabulous!  The sauce is great and my advice to people who think the sauce is too runny: let it sit for a minute.  The sauce will thicken as it cools.  Great dish.

This was my first time cooking mahi mahi. I never thought I would say this because I love seafood but this fish was a little too "fishy" for me. We use a maple salmon recipe with similar ingredients and we LOVE that one so we'll probably stick with that.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was ok.  I used salmon since I could not find Mahi mahi anywhere. I think it could have been marinated longer because the fish was a little bland.  I liked the sweetness of the glaze but I think I cooked the glaze too long because it came out gooey. My husband wouldn't even finish his and threw it out.  I think next time I'll try the glaze with chicken instead of fish.

I thought this was a GREAT recipe. Loved the fish. We grilled it on the BBQ and used Basa instead of Mahi Mahi. The glaze was a bit runny but I still loved it. It was a nice change for a meal. We also BBQ'd/grilled zucchini after we did the fish and it soaked up some of the sauce. It tasted beautiful as well. We served it over cous cous and thought it was a GREAT meal. Will make it again for sure. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was just ok. I had high expectations because of all the reviews, but it was nothing to write home about. The glaze needed some cornstarch or thickener, and maybe also some lemon juice and cilantro. The recipe would be good with a fruit salsa to liven it up a bit.

This is an excellent recipe.  We are a non-eating fish family so I substituted with chicken and doubled the sauce.  Family loved it.

The flavor was great and we will definitely make this again.  We used Salmon instead of Mahi Mahi, and the cooking temp could have been lower but it still came out GREAT!

We loved this!  So easy to prepare and my it was great to have a fish that my 18 month old son and my 3 1/2 year old daughter would enjoy!  I did use ground ginger instead of fresh because it was what I had I thought it was great!  This is the most easy, fabulous recipe!

Really great flavor... I would use this on chicken as well. Pan seared the mahi-mahi, then finished up in the oven. To thicken the glaze, added a little cornstarch.

Great recipe.  I made it as written.  My fish cooked in 3 min per side, but was room temp to begin with.  This would be great w/a mango salad and rice pilaf.  The glaze could be used on other meats as well.  Simple and fast.  This will be a regular for us.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars at best but I think part of the trouble was on my part.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the honey, as it's hard to measure, so I eyeballed it.  I don't think I put in enough.  I used frozen fillets from Trader Joe's.  I think the quality of the fish was OK but you really need to keep a sharp eye to be sure the fish doesn't overcook--it cooks fast.  I wish it tasted better because of all the glowing reviews, but with all the recipes to try here, I won't be making this one again.

Great recipe. It was very easy to make and I had most of the ingredients at home. I served with rice and steamed vegetables. The whole family loved it. Will make again. Maybe even with chicken instead of mahi.

OH MY GOSH..i was skeptical about my husband liking this recipe but we both loved it. I served it with uncle bens butter and garlic rice and some steamed green beans!!! The recipe says to pour the leftover marinade into the leftover oil in the pan to make a glaze but honestly the pan was too icky for me to do that. The marinade from the fish had already "over" glazed and slightly burned in the pan. But the fish was not and did not taste burnt at all. I simply put new oil (about 1-2 tbs) in a new pan with the leftover marinade to glaze...it was so good i drizzled some over the rice and green beans as well...Mmmmmmmmm

I made this last night with no modifications.  This was the first time I had Mahi Mahi and it was great.  My wife usually doesn't care for a lot of fish, but she liked the texture and non-fishy taste of this one.  We got it straight from the fish market.  For those of you who have never had Mahi Mahi, it's a flaky, yet meaty fish.  I think it's texture is similar to a nice tender piece of chicken.  My wife and I also loved the Glaze.  Very tasty.  Great recipe.

I was delighted to have received several Mahi Mahi filets as a Christmas gift.  I prepared this recipe tonight and we loved it.  The marinade reduced to a beautiful dark syrup that had just the right amount of tang and sweetness.  I also served rice which was perfect for the sauce.

My son who is not very fond of fish really liked this dish and so did I. We both loved the sauce. The only change in the sauce I did was add one more garlic clove. My husband didn't care for it because he could taste the soy sauce which he doesn't like, so I am going to try this again but replace the soy sauce with Yashida sauce to see how that would turn out. I will make it again anyway because it was a big hit with my son and I. Thanks again.

I love this dish.  My roommates, who hate fish, loved this dinner.  It's been weeks and I'm dying to make it again!!  I would recommend making more marinade for extra sauce also, but this was just amazing.

As is there is a bit too much soy sauce it the recipe (I even use lite soy).  I think I would cut down to 2 TB.  I used this on marlin and it worked beautifully--good all-purpose marinade.

This ginger glaze is outstanding and incredibly easy. I substituted crystallized ginger in place of fresh because that's all I had. In addition to the mahi mahi, I've made it with chicken breasts and that is delicious, too (marinated the chicken breasts all day then grilled them). Will be trying this with shrimp next. Great marinade..thank you for sharing this!

OH. MY. GOODNESS. 
I just had this about an hour ago and it was amazing. My husband loved it too. His exact words upon tasting it, "Ohhhhhhhhhhh. ohhhhhhhhhh yeaaaaaaaaah." And this continued until he was done with his food. So yeah, Im making this again.
I didnt change anything, only added an extra clove of garlic since my hubby and I love garlic. I will be making this for the rest of our lives.

I thought the marinade wasn't good at all, but I'm giving it 3 stars because the type of fish we used could have changed the outcome. I couldn't get Mahi Mahi or the equivalent her in SE Asia, so we used Dory.  Still, I won't try to make it again, even when I can get the right fish.

This is VERY good.  I had one 8 oz fillet with skin so I cut the ingredients by 1 /2.  I like more rather than less.  I kept 1 teaspoon of ginger root and one large clove of garlic.  I marinated the fillet for about 3 hours in a plastic bag placed in the refrigerator.  Being a novice cook, I had the oil temperature too high and burned the skin.  I reduced the heat by quite a bit and the rest went quite well.  I successfully reduced the marinade and –WOW!! – was it ever good!  I served with brown rice & dill, a small side salad and a wheat roll. EXCELLENT!  Thanks Diana.

My fish stuck to the pan. Next time I will sear for 2-3 min instead of 5. 5 min is way too long. HOWEVER, the sauce is AMAZING. my husband cant stop talking about it and begs me to make it.

This was truly fabulous!! I will definitely make this again.  My husband loved it, even talked about it several times the rest of the evening.  I agree that it would also be great with chicken.  The only thing is that it did not take 4-6 minutes each side to cook.  You need to adjust the time to the thickness of the fish fillets.

This was delicious! They didn't have mahi mahi at my grocery store, so we substituted sashimi grade marlin instead. We also baked it in the dish with the sauce instead of pan frying it. This will definitely be in our regular rotation!

I did this with tuna steaks & it came out fantastic. I cut the ginger & used ground ginger instead of fresh. I'm not a ginger fan, but it came out better than I expected. I paired it with an Asian salad I found on this site. My husband was pleasantly surprised!

Overall this was a good dish. Although next time I would add less balsamic vinegar and more garlic. Very tasty and went well with the Mahi Mahi.

This sauce is amazing! I tried it on salmon and for some reason it didn't work as well. My husband put it on mashed potatoes. I love that you get a citrus flavor without using citrus. I'm going to try it on chicken next. Thanks!

This is absolutely amazing! I have never cooked fish before but it came out to die for. My husband loved it as well, though he asked me to reduce the balsamic vinegar because it was a tad strong for him.

This has become a favorite of the whole family, including my 4 year old.  I really think it is the best fish I have ever prepared at home.
I usually serve it with a Thai Mint flavored rice and green beans sauteed with fresh garlic and olive oil.

My husband made this for dinner the other night, only difference being he grilled the fish.  It was excellent - the marininade flavors compliment the mild, meaty fish perfectly.  This will be a staple in our dinner rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was good, however once I flipped the fish over to brown on the other side, it began to burn after two or so minutes. Maybe more V.O. is necessary? Still tasted good.

This is an easy, excellent fish recipe. The marinade is delicious and makes a great pan sauce (I decreased the soy sauce by 1 Tbs to cut down on the sodium, and it still tasted great). Served with rice and some sauteed veggies, this made a quick and relatively healthy dinner. I used tilapia (no fresh mahi mahi) and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I marinated the fish for 1 hour and served it with steamed rice and steamed broccoli. Delicious! Next time I will try it without the additional sauce. The fish was very flavorful seems like it would taste delicious without the extra sauce and calories.

My husband told me this was better than any resturant fish dish he ever had! I am not very confident in my fish cooking, so that made my day. It was good- and as I was eating, I could not believe I had cooked this!

Super easy to make.  My family enjoyed it.  I prepared the fish in the George Foreman grill and used a small sauce pan to reduce the marinade into that yummy sauce.  I will definitely make again.

This is one of the most delicious recipes I've gotten off this site! It is sooo easy too.  Definitely DON'T skip the fresh ginger, it is a must!  Fresh ginger can be frozen to keep for longer so that it's always on hand. I followed the advice of the first reviewed listed and grilled for exactly 8 minutes in a foil boat - it was cooked perfectly!!

DH loved this.  I am not a fish eater, but tried a bite.  It tasted a little too much like soy sauce for me,  but DH disagreed.  Since I actually like soy more than he does, it was probably just my bite.  I'm going to try it on chicken next.

Outstanding sauce recipe that works for any type of meat, though preferbly tender ones, so that it marinates better. I couldn't get hold of the vinegar specified so i tried Apple Cider Vinger. Cool~ Can lessen on honey though, since ACV's relatively sweet too. Oh! And try adding a just a little starch powder to make the sauce more... saucy/gooey.  The original recipe's sauce keep spilling off my fish.

Excellent, easy-to-make glaze and marinade, lots of flavor with a few ingredients.  I'd use it on all types of meats, and have also cooked the glaze in to rice and cous-cous.

I think the glaze is good but it does over power a mild fish.  I think in the future, I will use something more subtle for mahi mahi.

I liked this recipe.  I used Salmon instead of Mahi Mahi becaused that's what I had in hand.  I thought the sauce was quite good and will probably make it again.

I have made this dish as originally written and with the simple substitution of rice vinegar for the balsamic. GO FOR THE RICE VINEGAR! Much better flavor, not as overpowering. I also grill the fish instead of frying it to make it a little healthier. Great flavor :)

Was it edible....yes.  Was is good...it was okay.  Will I make it again...no.  Why...because I like to taste the food.  I my opinion this sauce was sooooo overpowering and heavy for something as delicate as fish...we could hardly tell that we were eating fish!  Mahi Mahi is such a delicious fish and a little lemon or lime with some herbs such as rosemary or just a little lemon with salt and pepper would have been a million times better.

WOW - Can I give it more than 5 stars?  I did marinate longer than 20 mins (about 45) and I grilled them on a grill pan indoors.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!!  This was restaurant quality even with me cooking it!  I did use a bit more ginger as others recommended.  Good idea, but don't go too overboard.  I gave the recipe to a friend to try the next night..She spooned the marinade over her rice instead of the fish when she served it, and the taste was a bit too much.  Also, my pan blackened a LOT, so I was concerned..But once the sauce was spooned over fish, you couldn't even see the black marks.  Unbelievable dish!!  5 stars!

This glaze is so good I would eat road kill as long as I had this sauce. Seriously though, I add a little extra ginger - I also double the glaze so I can use it on rice. It is really delicious, and even better when you use a good Balsmaic Vinegar and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I have made it several times and everyone loves it. I am going to try it on other types of fish and maybe even chicken.

Soooo Good.
I used Salmon instead, since there was no Mahi Mahi at the grocery store and it still came out great.  I may try this sauce for a seafood stir fry.

Very Good, doubled the recipe. I might use less Soy Sauce next time.  I love basamic vinager and the fish was wonderful.  The soy sauce just seemed like it was overpowering.  Will make again, I would like to try this with salmon.

This is really tasty, but the kitchen got pretty smoky when I added the fish. Maybe the pan was too hot. Served with steamed haricots vert and white rice, with the sauce drizzled over the whole shebang. It looked very fancy.

This is really tasty!  I had some leftovers and was very suprised to discover that after being reheated, this tasted as good as-- or maybe even better than- when it was freshly made.  The marinade/glaze is delicious on shrimp, too.

This is really good! I marinated it a little bit longer (35 minutes) and added lime juice to the marinate (about a teaspoon). Yummy! I served it with orange cilantro rice (the recipe is on allrecipes). It was perfect.

we took another user's advice and grilled the filets on our george foreman for a healthier option.  delicious!  we'll definitely make this again and again.  maybe add a little less honey if you like your glaze less sweet.  but great as it is!  thanks!

I may have ended up cooking my Mahi Mahi a little too long, but it tasted a lot like chicken which I, and my girlfriend loved, since I don't eat chicken.  Would definately make again.

Not bad for my first attempt at mahi-mahi. I used 2 Tbsp of reduced-sodium soy sauce, and it was still a bit much. Next time I will use more honey, as I was expecting the glaze to be sweeter than it was. And I will marinate the fillets skin-side up--the flavor seemed to collect on the skin, which we threw away. Served with jasmine rice and Quick Sesame Green Beans from this site.

This is a great marinade for virtually any type of fish or chicken.  Especially for those "stronger" fishes - this sauce is flavorful and delicious.

Loved it!  My husband despises fish and I am trying to get him to eat more because it is so good for you!  After he tried this he said he would eat any fish that tasted like this!!!

This recipe is terrific.  The cooking instructions are very good - follow them and your fish will melt in your mouth.  I cooked the mahi mahi for exactly four minutes per side.  Thanks for the recipe post!

I have made this a couple of times.  The cooking time varies, depending on the thickness of your fish.  It is a good recipe as written.

Really easy and delicious.  I doubled the ingredients to make the marinade/glaze and let it sit a little bit longer to make sure the fish really soaked up the flavor.  I don't like fish very much, but I'd definitely amek and eat this again!

This glaze was excellent.  I cooked it for my wife over the weekend, and it turned out wonderfully.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  Instead of cooking on the stovetop, I used a grill....and it was excellent.  I think I'll try the marinade/glaze on some chicken in the future...

This was nice in that it was so quick to prepare.  I think I overcooked my fish a bit as it was a little dry.  I'll try again.

This was a good recipe, sweet and salty with the honey and soy; would have liked it a bit spicier so will add more ginger and chiles next time.

I wish I loved this dish! I gave it a 3 star for ease of preperation, but I really didn't enjoy any amazing flavor. I served it over rice and it was okay, but I probably would not make it again.

Outstanding.  I rarely cook anything, but this was easy AND awesome!  We've been looking for a way to make the great sauces/glazes you get for fish in some Oriental restaurants.  This one is excellent!

The glaze was delicious, but didn't "fit" with the mahi mahi.  Mahi Mahi is such a great fish, the glaze really distorted the taste of it.  However, we used this glaze with salmon and it was great.  I imagine it would  also taste wonderful with chicken.  I would give it five stars for ease of preparation.  It was by far the quickest and easiest fish recipe I have ever used!  Plan to use it again!

Fantastic and really easy to make. The sauce takes a while to reduce, so I put it in a small saucepan as soon as I start to cook the fish. Thanks for sharing!

this recipe is really tasty. I like the soy sauce with the ginger and balsamic vinegar. I didn't really measure anything, i just poured and guessed and it turned out really good. I also tried it with salmon and it was good with that also.

So fast, so easy, so good.  I pan seared the fish for a minute on each side to lock in the juices and it was fabulous!  The sauce is a delilcate blend and keeps your attention the entire meal!

Good sauce, we didn't care for the Mahi Mahi though.  Would probably be really good with a different fish.

My family LOVED this!  It's very hard for my to get my husband to eat fish (he only eats it if it doesn't taste fishy, ugh) and he said we could add this to our permanent menu, lol.  My kids enjoyed this too, although my 4 year old like it better without the sauce.  Wonderful blend of flavors, and we didn't think any one ingredient stood out over another.  I served this with the orange asparagus from this site, wich I have reviewed as well, and they complimented each other well.

This is fantastic - My picky, fish-hating 13 year old daughter had 2 helpings of this "chicken" (hey, what ever works!)  I will for sure make it again!

This was great!  I used ground ginger and added some lime juice as well.  I sprayed skillet with Pam instead of using oil and kept the heat at medium.  Will definitely make again!

GREAT RECIPE.  I AMDE IT WITH MAHI MAHI AND WITH ORANGE ROUGHY.  THE MAHI  MAHI HAD A FISHY TASTE.  I'VE ONLY HAD THIS FISH ONCE BEFORE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS NORMAL OR BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN IN MY FREEZER FOR A WHILE.  THE O.R. WAS A HIT AND SOOOO GOOD.  I'M GONNA MAKE THIS GLAZE WITH SHRIMP, CHICKEN, VEGGIES.  IT WAS VERY GOOD.

This was awesome!  My whole family loved it, even my youngest son who is not a big fan of fish!  We were scraping the sauce off the platter.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I sprayed my pan with Pam instead of using oil to fry the fish and I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger.  This is a keeper!

I am not a fish eater, but I am on weight watchers and trying to eat healthier.  Fish was good, but the sauce made it great.  From someone who doesn't like fish, 4 stars is great!

I can't believe how great this meal was with such limited preparation and cooking time.  My husband went back for thirds and continually raved about the food.  I had a hard time keeping myself from overeating it.  Fantastic recipe!!!

Very tasty!  I would omit the honey next time or maybe use less since my family do not enjoy 'sweet' ingredients in their main food items.  I also thickened the sauce with corn starch.  This is a keeper.

I don't eat fish, but I made this for my husband last night. WOW IT WAS GREAT. I did try the glaze and it was fantastic. I am going to try it on pork chops next. Give this a try.I'm also planing on glazing a ham with it.

This was very good. My grocer did not carry Mahi Mahi, so I used Rock Fish instead. I marinated my fish for about 8 hours and it was very flavorful. I served it with Basmati Rice, Grilled Aspargus and Corn on the cob. Thanks Diana, I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

Not impressed, but it was probably my fault.  I marinated the fish for a few hours and I think think that it overpowered it.  I did not have fresh ginger so I used a couple of teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste.  My husband liked it so I will try it again, but marinate for the 20 minutes like the recipe states.

Excellent.  This was so incredibly easy.  I made it exactly as directed (except I used powdered ginger because I couldn't find the fresh I had purchased) and it was wonderful.  I would feel very confident making this for a special dinner.  This is a keeper!

This was a good recipe.  I added more ginger than the recipe called for, and it was too much.  Next time, I'll stick with the original amount.  And I doubled the amount of the marinade so that I'd have enough to spoon over rice!

Super easy to make and tastes great.  I could not find fresh ginger root and used grated ginger root - still works!

This is great! I thought it needed a little more honey, but I like it sweeter than the recipe calls for. It is good either way though. If the glaze does not thicken, don't worry about it, it still tastes good poured on top of the fish.

Excellent recipe. Ginger flavor was perfect, not too overpowering and the sweetness just right with the natural flavor of the fish.

The best! Wanted something different than our usual butter and garlic sauce. This is great - I'm still licking the pan. For those afraid of "overpowering" the fish - make something else. Anytime you combine soy sauce, honey and vinegar with a mild fish........it's gonna happen. But this recipe imparts a wonderful sweet/tangy kick to fish, or anything you'd like to spice up. I marinated for several hours, and had to sub about 1/4 tsp ground ginger for the fresh and red wine vinegar for the balsamic. Also used maybe a tsp of chopped garlic from a jar. I wasn't expecting much, just something a bit different. But it's so good I'm amazed. Had to sit right down to write this review. Will definately make this again and again! Thanks so much for this one!

GREAT!!!! to make it healthier I adjusted this recipe slightly.  I used Splenda instead of honey, light soy sauce,and lite salt.  The next day, I cut up the left overs to be used in my salad.

I grilled this instead of baked. Quite possibly the best fish I've ever had!  Even with all the substitutions I used: dry ground ginger, cider vinegar, canned minced garlic and only olive oil. It was simple, quick and delicious!

The sauce was very good but my butcher did not have any frest mahi so I used frozen--I should have just used a different type of fish instead. I used apple cider vinegar and doubled the recipe for the glaze and the glaze was wonderful! I'll definitely try this again, but with fresh fish or chicken.

This is the BEST recipe for Mahi Mahi I've ever had. My 3 year old LOVES it. I've made it several times but never had the balsamic vinegar on hand so I've used apple-cider vinegar instead... I don't know if it makes any difference to the taste, but my whole family loves it.

We used this as a glaze on salmon and it was fabulous.  I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, also.  We also grilled the fish and drizzled the glaze over it before serving.

We didn't care for this.  Might as well have simply marinated the fish in teriyaki sauce... results are the same with less effort.  Save the teriyaki for the chicken or beef.

This recipe was simple, quick, tasty & most of the ingredients you already have on hand (store bought, pre-chopped ginger works great too).  The glaze really jazzed up the mahi mahi.

The 1st time I made this I followed the directions exactly and it was fabulous. The 2nd time I used salmon and grilled them & that too was excellent! This recipe was easy to follow and it will be in my recipe box for a long time! I want to try it with chicken, too! (I also used powdered ginger 1st time b/c I didn't have fresh and it was still wonderful)

marinating the mahi mahi for 30 mins wasn't long enough, as it turned out bland but marinating it overnight made it fairly tasty. it looked beautiful when cooked, too :)

I loved this recipe! My supermarket didn't have mahi-mahi or a similar fish, so I tried it with tilapia. I had to adjust the cooking time since tilapia is much thinner (around 2-3 minute per side), but it was delicious.

The sauce was not as sweet as I thought it would be and never really turned thick. Other than that, it was great over couscous! It tasted like the food you get at Hibachi and my boyfriend loved it.

This was truly excellent! I used rice wine vinegar instead of the balsamic, and adjusted cooking times to my cut of fish. Great with rice and raw pea pods or grilled asparagus.

Great recipe.  Added a little extra ginger, and a little bit of red pepper for kick.  Great for non-fish eaters!

This glaze would be fantastic on any fish or chicken. Great recipe. Received rave reviews when serving this. Even those who don't like fish liked this one.

Great flavor.  The kitchen smelled so good that even my non-fisheating daughter wanted to try it (and liked it).

I made this recipe using Salmon and it, too, is delicious.  I tried a bite before placing the glaze on it and I wasn't too excited but the left over marinade glaze just makes it zip.  I added twice as much ginger as the recipe called for because I like the extra zing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my husband's new favorite dish!  We have made it several times already and he also loves the marinade with pork chops as well.  My three kids also love the taste.  Thanks so much!

This was very good! I am always afraid to cook fish, because in my opinion, it never turns out well. But this time, I even finished my whole fillet! My glaze did not thicken, so next time I will cook it longer. I used the pan fry method. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! Reminded me of my Mom's cooking growing up in Hawaii. Even satisfied my very picky eating Son! Will definitely make again.

This dish is wonderful.  The flavors blend well without being over powering.  I cooked my fish on the grill.  I also recommend the recipe for "Halibut with Rice Wine."  This one is also a winner.

Very good glaze!!  Loved the extra sauce for dipping.  Still great flavor on the second day, but the fish looked unappetizing because it had turned brown from soaking up the extra sauce. Next time I'll leave the extra sauce in a separate dish.  Would be good on a salad too!
