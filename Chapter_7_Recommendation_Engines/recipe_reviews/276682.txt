OH my YUM!!! This is SO damned delicious?I had a mouthgasm!!! Don t judge! You know the well known green bean casserole most have gotten sick of over the years? Here s a tip: make fresh green beans and use THIS sauce - just pour it over the green beans...add some crispy onion straws and talk about an improvement to the (un)loved classic!

Good sauce. The directions don't tell you when to add the parmesan cheese so I added it with the cream.
