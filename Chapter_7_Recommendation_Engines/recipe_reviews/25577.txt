Very good, moist cake  - I made a few adjustments. Used 3/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. Splenda in place of white sugar.  Used 3/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil in place of 1 c. oil.  Took a little longer to bake - almost 1-1/2 hours.  Delicious - will surely make again.

Yummy yummy and did I say Yummy??? This is exaclty what my mother made, such a delicious moist cake, not at all like the easy "cake box mixes" that we love and are guilty of serving our family! My hubby loved this, thanks for sharing!

This cake is absolutely wonderful!  I had a lot of figs and decided to experiment - had never made nor eaten a fig cake.  I chopped up some fresh, ripe figs instead of using canned figs and made it in a bundt pan.  It is so moist that it would be just as good without the icing.  I'll definitely make it again.

THIS WAS AWESOME!! My family (the ones into figs anyway XD) LOVED IT! I only made the cake so this is about the cake only.
We do't have allspice here in Egypt so I put in a mix of my own: Ground Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Cloves and Ginger about a teaspoon each and I used baking powder instead of baking soda, I used half a cup oil n half melted butter instead all oil. The cake came out moist n sooo tasty one thing I'd change is add more sugar next time, but if u're making the Icing then u're all set!

This is a review of the cake only (not the icing). I typically don't like things overly sweet, so the only change I made was to skip making the buttermilk icing. It was sweet enough without. It's a delicious, spicy, moist cake. I used home canned figs and it turned out wonderful. I used a bundt cake pan and had some trouble getting it out of the pan. Make sure you grease and flour the pan very thoroughly.

Delicious cake! Super moist. My mother in law makes homemade fig jam. so i used that for the fig base. I made it for my Dad's birthday. Everyone. Loved it. Do yourself and your family a favor and make this at least once!! Thanks for sharing the recipe. Yummy!  If I had one suggestion, make it and let it soak up all the icing over night. Then enjoy the next day.

I made this last night and was very pleasantly surprised.  (the cake part only, as I didn't have the ingredients for the icing) This was a hit even with the kids, who aren't fans of spice cake.  I used fresh figs. Excellent recipe!

This cake was delicious I made a few substitutions based on what I had available. I used a jar of figs I canned last year (more than a cup) so I cut the sugar down to a half of a cup of coconut sugar, toasted chopped almonds instead of pecans.. I mixed the figs into the batter quite a bit and added extra nutmeg. We ate it without the frosting and it was moist and well  spiced!

This was a good cake, I made it as per the recipe except I used fresh figs. We found the topping a little sweet so the second time I made it I skipped that part and just made the cake - which we preferred.

The cake itself was ok. Moist and spicy.  The 'frosting' however is another story.  If you cook this mixture to 240 degrees you have caramel canduy not a frosting. It ruined the cake. I will keep the recipe because I can my own figs and this is a good recipe to use them up.  Just don't cook the icing to 240 degrees.  It really doesn't need a glaze.

Amazing!!!! My neighbors fig tree grew over into our yard im so glad it did. Im not one for measuring so i over did it a bit on the figs and nuts (which to me only made it better). Instead of using the icing i substituted the caramel icing VI recipe from this site- fantastic addition!! Will definitely be making this again.
