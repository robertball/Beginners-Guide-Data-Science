Fantastic cake!  Very easy to make and unbelievably tasty!  Everyone loved it, or so they told me anyway.  
I didn't need to bake it for 70 min., only 50.

DELICIOUS! This is my first time making this cake and it was easy to make. I think it needs less oil and I baked it for maybe 38 minutes. I also use a glaze on it.

I made version I & II and both were gone in moments!  I will try to rest of the versions as well. But version II is the favorite.  The hot icing is wonderful. I love this cake!

I have made this recipe multiple times with yellow, strawberry, or lemon cake. I cooked this 42 minutes, omitted the pecans and omitted the brown sugar and cinnamon when I made it with strawberry or lemon cake. Huge raves and requests for repeats from coworkers. Used buttercream frosting to finish.

This cake is easy to make and delicious.  I used the glaze for Sock II.  My husband couldn't wait for it to cool down!!!  I'd only make half the quantity of glaze next time though.

Very good! Easy to prepare, pecans gave good flavor and texture. A little less sugar in the batter and the addition of a glaze would be great. Would definitely make again.

I really don't know what the excitement is about this cake.  I found it rather boring, AND I, too, burned it.  Not horribly, but definitely burned.  And that was at 45 minutes bake time.  Won't be making this again.

I burnt the cake.  70 minutes was way too long.  Otherwise it looked fabulous while preparing it.  I shall try it again, but not tonight.

Extra points for being so easy! I tried this recipe because I had all of its ingredients in my pantry. It was fast and tasty. I'm sure a glaze is nice, but I didn't think it needed it. This would be a perfect coffee cake too. I'll be making it for my next breakfast/brunch gathering. Like other reviewers have said, WATCH THE TIME. It was done in far less time than the recipe suggests.

I would prefer a homemade cake, but this was good. Actually mixed up brown sugar, cinnamon and pecans in the cake instead of on the batter. came out pretty good and the family like the pecans in the cake better. Also, came out a nice tan color.
