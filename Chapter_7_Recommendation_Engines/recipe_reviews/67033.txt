I've made this recipe numerous times but I follow the original Kraft recipe which calls for 2 teaspoons of Worchestershire sauce and also a dash of cayenne pepper.  That's may be why the previous reviewer said the cheese ball was so wet and the nuts just sank in because the amount of sauce is incorrect Even using 2 teaspoons of Worchestershire sauce can be a little over-powering and take away the cheese flavor. I've cut back to just one teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce.

This is one of our all time family favorites.  It is something that everyone expects me to make for our get together's.  I also got the recipe from Kraft on the cream cheese wrapper.  Everyone thinks it is mine.  Sometimes I split it in two and make two small cheese balls depending on the number of guests...    One for the party and one for later.  I leave the cheese out until pretty soft then it is easier to mix.  Or you can shape it into a bell and use the green and red peppers to decorate for Christmas parties.

Just made this for a party I was hosting. It was a huge hit. However the dip was very soft, so when I tried to roll it in the pecans they sank into the cheeseball. Next time I will let the cheeseball set in the fridge for a bit and then roll in the pecans. It did look like a hot mess when I was done, but was very yummy.

This is a great cheese ball and highly recommend it.  The reviewers that had trouble shaping it may I suggest that you chill the mixture until stiffened and then the nuts will not disappear and you can make a very attractive centerpiece.  Good luck....do this with all cheese balls.

A tip: I let the cheese sit 1-2 hours if I have the time and then mix all the ingredients. Wrap it in saran wrap, make a ball and chill. THEN roll in finely chopped pecans. I love cheese of all kinds and this recipe has been used for years in our family. I never cut the worcestershire down, it adds to the flavor for sure. Along with the lemon juice. I only omit the salt. Happy eating :)

Reminded me so much of my grandmothers!  My touch? green onions instead of regular, and a new surprise...A-1!  I ran out of Worcestershire and subbed it. Nice diff!

Delicious, but too wet for me, I think. Next time I'll reduce the amount of Worcestershire as someone recommended (to 2 tsp. rather than tbsp.) and probably reduce the lemon juice as well. While I did love this, I still prefer the recipes using jarred dried beef as a flavor component! Thanks for the recipe!

My uncle shared this recipe with me, and everyone loves it so much!  I usually make a cheese log since so there are more nuts-per-cheese, and I like to use wheat thins since they are sturdy enough. It's true, when it's all mushy, the nuts sink in.  It's better to refridgerate and then roll it I guess, but I'm always doing it last minute, so it ends up kinda messy but quite yummy! I never add any salt, and I always forget which is one or two tablespoons or teaspoons.  But it always has pizazz! I really like it for the holidays because the green peppers and red pimentos look so festive!

This was a HUGE hit at my recent family party!  I made a few of the recommended changes though. I used green onion instead of regular onion, and i used jarred pimentos, which worked very well. I also reduced the amount of worcestershire sauce to 2 tsp instead of 2 TBSP, and added a dash of paprika.  I let the ball chill in the refrigerator over night, and rolled it in the pecans just before serving. I will definitely be making this for all parties to come!

I love cheese of all kinds and this recipe has been used for years in our family. The only thing we do differently is we only use 1 tsp of Worchestershire and also add about 2 tsp of horsradish that comes in a jar in the dairy section at the store. It just makes people say"what is that" Really gives it good flavor

Sorry but this was really bad. Total waste of hard earned money. Followed the recipe exactly. Didn't change anything. Very disappointing.

Great to make ahead and was a big hit before Christmas dinner! I added some seasoning salt and garlic powder to it.

I made this recipe this afternoon for Christmas Eve tomorrow.  Excellent taste!  I used green onion as one reviewer suggested, and cut down the Worchestershire sauce to 1T.  I used Lawry's Seasoned Salt instead of regular salt.  The consistency looks good.  I'll chill then roll in finely chopped pecans tomorrow.  Delish!

I have used this recipe for years. The only thing I add is red pepper to taste. It gives it a little kick. It is a must at all my family gatherings.
