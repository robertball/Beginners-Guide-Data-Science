I remember these cookies from back in the 70's. It's always been a favorite..it's simple and the results are always a hit. They're especially pretty when you add red or green food coloring to frosting...very festive. Try them...you won't be sorry.

I made these one year for Christmas and our good friend, went nuts over these. His birthday just passed and I made them for him, again. I had to make them two days in a row. Everyone loved them and couldn't get enough. On the holidays add some coordinating sprinkles to the frosting to match the holiday. I added kisses to the top!

We have had this recipe in our family for years, as well, and love it!!!  A good thing to know, is that if your family has any nut allergies, you can actually make these without rolling them in the egg whites and then the nuts, and they are still spectacular! (And a lot less work!) :)  We also like to use seasonal M&M's for these - Easter, Christmas, etc., they are beautiful and tasty any time!

My mom used to make the jam thumbprints for the holidays. This is a cute and sweet rendition of her recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made these by the recipe, using homemade glaze instead of store-bought frosting. They were a bit on the labor intensive side, but the end results was certainly worth the effort. They are a step above your normal thumbprint cookie! They were lighter than they appeared and I was surprised they were not as overly-sweet as they looked. I'll take a batch to the folks at the chemotherapy clinic tomorrow. Thanks, Michelle9493!

I made this for my husband who grew up eating these and  loves them. I made Italian Meringue Buttercream for the frosting (which makes them a whole lot less sugary sweet) and dipped the bottoms in either dark or milk chocolate. It changes the flavor profile immensely and is very good. A childhood treat remade for adult tastes.

I have made this recipe for as long as I can remember. It is a staple at holiday meals, especially Christmas and Easter. We leave off the nuts and use the various holiday colored M&M's. My favorites are the peanut and peanut butter.

Delicious! My husband said it was the best cookies he has ever had. I thought they were really tasty. I added jello sugar to make colored/flavored frosting and did not add the chocolate. Just some colored sprinkles. They looked very pretty and tasted as good as they looked. I thought this was an easy recipe that looks deluxe as far as presentation goes. Very yummy!

Overall tasted good. Recipe is exactly like my thumbprint cookies with raspberry jam. To me the frosting and chocolate covered peanut just didn't make sense. Lots of work.
