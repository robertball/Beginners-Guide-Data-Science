This recipe is awesome! Thank you Carol.
I read all of the reviews and was concerned about how this would turn out. I, like some other reviewers consider myself a A+ baker, especially cakes. So, I would have felt bad if this didn't turn out well. But, I noticed that many others had success and I thought surely I could use their suggestions. I wrote out all of the suggested adjustments to this recipe and did those, and it tastes...well, heavenly!
If you don't want to go through all the reviews, here's the adjustments...
Use 1&1/2 cups of milk instead of just one. Wait till the other ingredients are mixed before you make your meringue, and then fold it in rather than beat it. 
I also made a few other adjustments to make mine low fat. I used skim milk, and light butter with canola. I made 24 cupcakes and they are wonderful!
Note that the batter seems thin, but it makes up moist wonderful cupcakes.
Also, do make sure to notice that you are suppose to sift the flour first, then measure and add baking powder and salt, then sift all together three times. I'm wondering if some of the other reviewers didn't notice that you were suppose to sift the flour before you even measure it out to add the baking powder and salt. It could have been the difference. 
I hope you decide to make this recipe!

While white and yellow butter cakes can have a tendency to be dry, this was not the case here. This is a beautiful light and fluffy, MOIST white cake. I don't know if it was necessary or not, but I added an extra 1/2 c. of milk as other reviewers suggested. I will be curious to try this recipe with the amount called for next time, to compare.  Thanks for sharing this "heavenly" white cake recipe!

I found this cake recipe to be terrific. I just made it for my office for someone's birthday, and we are all eating it up as I write this review.
This recipe makes a very rich, white cake with a very moist crumb.  
  I do agree with the people who added an extra 1/2 cup of milk -- it's necessary. The batter probably would have turned out fine without it, but I thought it looked a lot better with the extra milk.
  Another suggestion I would make is to flip around the instruction steps in the recipe, as I did.
  I made the butter and flour batter first and then covered it with plastic while I whipped the egg whites into meringue. I feared that making the meringue first, as the recipe instructs, would cause it to run or weep or go flat while I was making up the other batter.
  Overall, I really endorse this recipe if you need a white cake.

This cake is absolutley delicious!  I took the advice of others and used an extra 1/2 cup of milk.  It's moist, light, fluffy and oh so good.  I can't wait to try this with a number of fillings, frostings and for cupcakes.

Made some minor changes here - folded the beaten whites in rather than beating them in (holdover from culinary school - always fold in something you've whipped), omitted the almond extract, and baked in a 9x13 pan rather than 10x15. It came out lovely and fluffy - and seems to stay moist with the amount of milk recommended, if kept tightly covered. Served it with fresh blueberries and sweetened creme fraiche one night and homemade hot fudge another - it's also great on it's own! Thank you, Carol!

I have made this recipe several times, and find it necessary to add a little more milk than the 1 cup listed--the batter becomes very heavy without approx 1/2 cup extra milk to smooth it out. This is a dense, moist cake & very delicious.
I have found that half the recipe makes one dozen very generous-sized cupcakes.
The baking time is somewhat shorter for the cupcakes--you have to start keeping an eye on them at the 25-minute point so the tops don't burn.  My daughter (6 rs old) loves it, even with the ready-in-a-can
frosting from the supermarket.  I have also used a home-made whipped cream type frosting with excellent results.

I was concerned about the cake being too dry after reading the other reviews  but I think the key is to do the required sifting as the recipe calls for. This cake was great and it took a lot of work but well worth it after you get all of the great reviews from Family and friends. I did add the extra 1/2 cup of milk. I too used the White Cake Frosting recipe submitted by Amy Parsons and everyone just LOVED IT. I will use this White Cake recipe as my new basic cake from now on.

Amazing recipe! I made this for a cake for mothers day and got rave reviews! I made it with homemade strawberry filling and awesome homemade creamcheese icing. I decorated it and it looked as good as it tasted!(This cake is my profile picture!) There is no other white cake recipe I will ever use!

This cake was wonderful! I baked it in 3 pans and then put layers of whipped cream and sliced bananas between the layer.  I frosted it with whipped cream.  Absolutely delicious!  I did add and extra 1/2 cup milk.

This is a Swan's cake flour recipe.  Following the instruction to the "T", it failed but after second time with my modifications, came out superb!  Make sure eggwhites are at room temp.  Next, make sure you use a non-metal bowl for eggwhites.  Next, beat eggwhites till soft peaks form, THEN gradually add sugar while beating. Then gently fold in the whites into batter. This will ensure the outcome of the eggwhites to be fluffy and make the cake delicate, light, moist as a true white cake should be! With the modifications-TOTALLY SUPERB CAKE!!  I definitely use this recipe again with my modications for the perfect outcome of this cake

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  It tasted very flat.  Even adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk it was still too heavy.

This cake is wonderful and made a huge hit with my family - they were asking for another one before the first one was finished!  It was a little heavy, but very moist and delicious.  I was a little leary of beating in the meringue, but since other reviewers said they followed the recipe exactly and it came out great, I did it this way.  However, next time I might try folding in the meringue to see if it comes out a little lighter.  I also mixed the batter first, then did the egg whites, and also added another 1/2 cup (almost) of milk as other reviewers suggested.  I used 2 tsp of vanilla instead of the almond extract, baked it in 2 9 in pans and frosted with a chocolate butter cream.  YUM!  This one will be made again - thanks, Carol!

Almond extract was overpowering. The cake its self (texture, nice and moist etc...) was excellent. Next time I'll either be cutting back on the almond or going with all vanilla extract. Make sure you use the extra milk suggested by other users! EDIT: I gave it another try this time only using vanilla extract, 2 tsp, and it was great exactly what I had been hoping for the 1st time I made the cake. There are a few keys to making sure the cake turns out: like I mentioned above, use the extra 1/2 C. of milk and then also SIFT SIFT SIFT! Sift your flour before measuring, if you don't your flour will be compacted and you'll end up with more flour than you need, and then sift all dry ingredients together before adding. Prepare your batter BEFORE you whip your egg whites (and don't overbeat, you'll end up with a tough/rubbery cake) so they don't start to deflate and then fold into batter in thirds. First third add and mix well to loosen up the batter so you can gently fold in the next third, incorperate and then fold in the last third. The batter will be on the thin side and that's fine. Get into your pans and get it into the oven as soon as possible. Time sitting out=volume lost. Hope this helps some.

I am a baker, by profession.  I feel that this recipe is ALMOST perfect.  The texture and crumb IS perfect.  It's the taste that i have a little problem with.  To me, it tasted too much like flour.  But, everyone that i gave it to LOVED it.  Next time, i will double the vanilla and leave out the almond.  I too added the extra 1/2 cup of milk.  Actually, i only had 1% and heavy whipping cream, so i used half of each.  Overall, it's great.  The recipe itself was fairly easy.  I do think it's important NOT to beat the egg whites back into the batter, but to fold them in.  You dont want to deflate them by beating again.  Will use this recipe again.

I followed the reviews and added an extra half a cup of milk. The cake came out moist and tender. Also I didn't have cake flour so I used AP flour I just subtracted 2 T per cup. For the egg whites I'm lazy so I bought Egg Whites in a container. I wasn't sure if it would work or not since I had never used them but they whipped up just fine. My hubby took a bite and said "Oh My Gosh!" so it must be really good! I made this into cupcakes. I baked at 350 for 16 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow - how fortunate that Carol decided to share her recipe.  I'm not easy to please, so I took a chance and made the original recipe - NO adjustments.  I highly recommend you do the same in this case.  I followed the recipe exactly and it truly is heavenly.  The flavor is the shining star of this recipe - spectacular.  The other thing to love is it is somewhat dense AND very moist.  I can see it would be great for layered cakes, specialty cakes, whatever.  The batter is thick - don't freak out.  It will be divine if you follow the recipe properly.  I made it in a bunt pan, so naturally my cake required more bake time.  Use a toothpick to test it before you take it out.  I also recommend watching the video that allrecipes.com made for this recipe.  I served mine with "chocolate ganache" (by INGRIDEVOGEL), strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream.  Update:  I made this twice today (cupcakes then layer cake) and decided to add 1/2 cup of extra milk to see what other's reviews were talking about.  The extra milk throws off the balance of flavor and texture in the wrong direction.  If it's not broken, folks, don't fix it.  Unless a boxed cake mix texture is what you are aiming for.   Take my advice - follow the original in this case.  You'll be in heaven.

Wonderful recipe! I did use AP flour because I was out of cake and it came out perfect. Do add the extra 1/2 cup of milk and measure your flour after you sift. You really should sift it at least 3 times. Also, fold in the egg whites to keep the air in them. Perfectly moist and wonderful tasting cake (or cupcakes in my case, got about 25). Will definitely use again!

The first time I made this cake it was dry but it had a very nice flavor. I made the adjustment of an extra 1/2 cup of milk and it came out EXCELLENT. This cake is sooooo good and super moist. I also folded the egg whites in the batter instead of beating them in.

I LOVED this cake!  I typically don't like white cake because of the dry texture and plain flavor.  Not this case with this recipe!  Made this for Father's Day, for my husband.  Added jello to it, how his Oma used to do it.  (I tried the white cake without the jello, too) Used an 8min icing and marshmallow fondant.  Thanks for the recipe!  I won't ever use anything else for white cake!  ps I did not make any adjustments as others suggested and it turned out absolutely beautiful!  No need to waste time trying to "fix" or "perfect" this one.

You have got to be kidding me!!! This cake is sooo GREAT.. I also used the extra 1/2 cup milk as well in my cake and wow its amazing... I used a the Fluffy Buttercream Frosting Recipe by Dee  that is on the site, except i used almond extract instead of vanilla. My Husband and I both agree that the 2 of these recipes together makes one stellar cake it was better then all the professional cakes we have ever had!!! Thanks for sharing!

I was not impressed with this cake at all. I followed the recipe but added the extra milk, which was suggested by other reviewers. I found that the cake was heavy and dry. It baked up very well though and was easy to icing. I used parchment paper and lightly oiled the sides of the pan. I did not care for the taste of the cake, although, it did taste a little better the second day. I probably will not make this cake ever again.

This cake didn't impress me. I have read reviews that it was "more like pound cake"...not so- I found it much more like sponge cake. It was moist, and light. A little too light, very airy and porous. The batter was luscious- I added 1/2 extra cup of sugar, folded in the egg whites, and as many did used extra milk. The cake did rise well,my hopes were very high. I began to notice the cake was not aromatic, even with the extra extract I added. My daughter came home and thought I was making corn muffins. The cake is bland, and for an unknown reason tastes and smells like it was made with some cornmeal. Would probably work very well with fruity filling...Overall I felt it was too much work for a cake not much better than a box of mix. Sorry, I did not like it.

Everyone loved this cake. I too added the extra milk (1.5 cups total) and I also made my own cake flour as I do not buy this (1 cup flour minus 2 TB with 2TB cornstarch added, then sifted 3-5 times). Don't forget to sift the powder & salt together like the recipe calls for. Very dense yet moist. My daughter said it tasted like pound cake! This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This cake is ok.  It is heavy like a pound cake.  Used it for my daughters birthday and everyone ate it but no rave reviews. Don't think I'll make it again.

Very elegant cake, and equally delicious! Followed others suggestions such as adding 1/2 extra milk, preparing the merengue last and folding it in. The undertones of the almond extract really make the cake. Perfect with a good buttercream and raspberry filling. Absolutely happy with the results!!

This cake is phenomenal! Light and fluffy, and so tasty.  I did use the suggestions from others, used 1 1/2 cups milk and folded the egg whites in rather than beat them in.  I made cupcakes and in a convection oven, they only took 15 minutes, there were 24 and enough for a thin 8 inch cake.  Fantastic!  This recipe is a keeper forever!

This is white cake perfection! My son requested a white cake for his birthday and this is the recipe I chose despite the weird reviews. First of all the recipe really needs to be followed with the exception of adding another 1/2 cup of milk. Unlike cooking baking is more of a science project. Every ingredient and process serves a vital purpose to the end result of the cake. In this one you must sift the flour then measure it out then sift all the ingredients. I admit it's a cake that will test how many large bowls you have in your kitchen but the end result is worth it. I did fold in my whipped egg whites until fully incorporated rather than mixing in since I was using my KA to mix (didn't wanna decimate the poor things).  I also find it pertinent to adjust cake recipes for my altitude which I did with this one. I didn't have any problems with the cake being flat or falling in the middle. Now if the cake didn't rise or turned out like a biscuit (which I find highly impossible) you did something wrong. This is not a dry cake it is very moist. It's not dense its very light and the texture and crumb will rival any box mix alive!!

I just baked this cake and had great results. Very moist and easy to work with. My family really enjoyed this cake and said it was not the normal dry white cake you would get from the grocery baker. I was really pleased. This was my first cake I ever baked from scratch. I alos used the extra 1/2 cup of milk. Yumm!

I was disappointed with this recipe, with all the rave reviews. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk, per other users. I thought the cake came out a little dry and dense.  Its not bad, but not phenomenal, as I was hoping. The search for a good homemade cake recipe continues.

I just make a wedding cake for a small wedding of 45 people, and used this recipe.  Everyone at the wedding loved it, it was a dense, moist, flavorfull cake.  I will definately use this recipe again.

This recipe was fantastic.  I loved it.  This was my second go at making it, the first time I did not use the right temp a big no no.  I did make a couple of changes.  I see eveyone was adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk, but I did not.  I loved the texture the way it was, but did find it just a bit on the dry side the frist time, along with cooking it at a lower temp which also helped it to be on the dry side. Second time around I added 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup.  As I said I did not want to change the texture because it was truly perfect and I knew adding more milk would do just that.  I also omitted the Almond.  It's not a favorite of mine in cakes, so I just used more vanilla. Other than that no other changes. Just follow it to the letter. I also see where folks are saying do not beat the egg whites in or whip them in with the blender.  The video did show where the egg whites were begin folded in, but I can see where in the instructions if you did not watch the video people would mix them in with the blender.  If you do use the blender, use the lowest speed and just mix until they are incorporated. I paired this light, fluffy, moist white cake with a light vanilla buttercream frosting.  Excellent!  Thank you, Carol!

I forgot to add the extra 1/2 c milk like so many reviewers suggested. I regret that, as the cake is very dense and a bit crumbly without it. I loved the flavor and it was definitely at hit at the party. I just feel like a little extra moisture would have made it out of this world. I did whip the eggs as the final step and folded them into the batter as opposed to beating them in.

Amazing! My 14yr old daughter said "This cake will make even Jesus cry". LOL. Anyways, I too added 1/2 cup more milk, but I also added 1/2 tsp more of the pure vanilla extract and only 1/2 tsp of the almond extract. Personal preference. The two most important ingregients that I added to this recipe was Patience and Love. With that added, this cake came out so moist and fluffy. Very Delicious. A must try. Definitely a keeper. Thank you Carol for sharing.

A great basic white cake. This was my first time beating egg whites to soft peaks (or any kind of peaks), and this recipe made the process easy to follow. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of milk to the batter, per other recommendations; I think it made all the difference. The cake baked up light and airy; while not moist, it certainly was not dry. There wasn't a huge amount of flavor, but I think that is typical of white cake; I used some very sugary (store-bought) frosting to add some pizazz. 

I actually used this recipe as a base for homemade funfetti cupcakes (just add large colored sprinkles into the batter before you spoon it into the tins). Cupcakes received rave reviews, so I will definitely be using this recipe again. This recipe would also be great for petits fours, a cake with jam in it, etc.--anything where you don't want to cake the overpower the frosting or fillings. 

Note: I was able to use the 4 reserved egg yolks the next day in a recipe for egg fried rice (also found on this site). Waste not, want not!

YUM! This was great! Moist and delicious! I sifted 3 times as directed and added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract. I followed a review and folded the meringue in the batter until well incorporated.  I did not have cake flour so I used all purpose with cornstarch added the ratio is  1 Cup of all purpose minus 2 TB, PlUS 2 TB of Corn starch. You can google it. I did this during the last sift.

I used this recipe for the Coconut Poke Cake on here.  It was wonderful! ( I tasted some before I turned it into the poke cake and it was still moist and wonderful).

This cake is a very nice cake. Moist and fluffy the only thing is for me it is a bit to sweet. I will make it again but I will cut back on the sugar. Everyone else this evening really enjoyed it.

Great, just a fantastic cake, so moist!  I took other reviewer suggestion and added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and I also made the batter first, then whipped the egg whites and added.  I put this in 3 round pans and used Pastry Cream for Pies (also on AR) as the filling and loaded on fresh sliced strawberries between each layer and my own buttercream frosting and the cake was a HUGE HIT.  Thank you so much, this will be my go to cake recipe!

Not impressed, it may do better made as cupcakes and I may try that sometime. I only make cakes from scratch, so I was over whelmed with the directions. I did not like the consistency of the cake when baked. It was edible.

The name of this cake says it all-HEAVENLY!  I rarely make cakes from scratch, but this is one where I will make the exception.  It is well worth the time spent to make this.  Like other reviewers, I mixed the batter first, and then whipped the eggs whites and gently folded together.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out, you need to carefully read the recipe and measure your flour AFTER it has been sifted.  I baked mine in 2 - 9 inch rounds for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Amazing flavor and texture.

Absolutely delicious! At first I was concerned that this cake may be too heavy, too dry or too bland as some reviews stated, but it turned out perfectly for me. I did add the extra 1/2 c of milk and made sure to use CAKE flour, sifting once before measuring as the recipe stated. Also, start watching for doneness 5 - 8 mins early. I topped it off with the "white cake frosting" recipe submitted by Amy Parsons. Served it next day. Very moist!

While this cake is very moist (like other reviewers, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and extra vanilla) and has excellent texture (very light and soft, not too spongy), the flavor is off.  It tastes like a sugar cookie that has been rolled out in a little too much flour.  
You definitely need to modify the directions: cream butter and 1 c. sugar; alternate adding dry ingredients and milk (you don't need to BEAT each time until smooth, just mix on low speed--if you overmix, the gluten will overdevelop and you will get holes and tunneling in your cake); add flavoring if you did not add it with the milk.  Now you should beat the whites and remaining sugar to soft peaks, then FOLD in gently (I usually add my beaten egg whites in 1/3's--a trick I learned in culinary school).  
I could not in good conscience give this recipe any better rating since the directions are wrong, I had to add more milk and vanilla than the recipe called for and the flavor was lacking to my taste (if you like cake that tastes like a sugar cookie--this is for you).

After searching for the perfect white cake recipe, I have finally found it!!  This cake came out perfect - moist and delectable!  Of all things, I do not own a sifter, so I just whisked my cake flour and dry ingredients.  I did follow the suggestions of previous reviewers: 1 1/2 c. milk and folding in the meringue at the end.  I paired this with the Special Buttercream Frosting for an amazing result!!

Made this for my youngest daughter's birthdday, and was very disappointed to find out that it left a horribly awful salty taste in your mouth after you ate it.  My daughter was very upset and barely touched her birthday cake....I will never make this again.

So delicious! I made the modifications suggested by other reviewers (1.5 cups milk and beat the egg whites last, then folded them in) and it was just perfect. Really moist and flavorful.

While this recipe took quite some time, I have to say it's definitely worth it. Make sure you set aside at least forty-five minutes of prep work before the cake actually goes in the oven. I put my batter in two 8 inch pans and it baked at 350 for about 28-30 minutes. The taste is wonderful (I added only 1/4 tsp of almond extract due to the overpowering flavor of it and 1/2 cup more milk). It almost tastes like a slightly more vanilla-flavored angel food cake it's THAT fluffy. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again... even if it is very time consuming to make!

I was so impressed with this cake! It is exactly what I have been looking for - dense but extremely moist & tasty! The flavor is perfect - sweet (but not too sweet) and the hint of almond and vanilla is sooo yummy! I'm making a couple of sculpted birthday cakes this month & I have been searching for a nice white cake - my search is over! Thanks for a great recipe! (I followed the instructions about sifting the flour before measuring & then sifting it again 3x more with the baking powder & salt. I also whipped the heck out of my egg whites until they were forming nice soft peaks, then incorporated it thoroughly into the batter. The batter was thick & fluffy - like cool whip, and it baked into a beautiful moist cake. YUM!

I have made this cake 2 times now. Once as 2 rounds and once as cupcakes. One batch makes 3 dozen cupcakes, which was exactly what I needed! I do add an additional 1/2 cup milk as previously suggested. It turns out a little crumbly, but sooo good! Perfect with homemade buttercream frosting.....yum!

I made two dozen cupcakes for a baby shower using this recipe. They turned out light, moist, and delicious. I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the batter and used 1 1/2 cups buttermilk instead of regular whole milk. Then I beat in half the egg whites and folded in the rest. I also used two teaspoons vanilla bean paste for more vanilla flavor along with one teaspoon almond extract. It was a tasty combination. Great recipe! Next time I'll make a layer cake.

My favorite cake has always been white birthday cake.This is the only time I've come really close to it tasting like a store bought cake.I just made this cake today and it is wonderful!It's very important to sift the dry ingredients all 3 times;and also to add extra milk like so many other people said.I even went over the 1 and a half cups of milk-just a bit- until the batter felt right to me.Also I used buttermilk instead, since I had some I needed to use.It added a nice flavor to the cake.I frosted with buttercream icing.I didn't have any almond extract but the vanilla seemed to work fine.I also didn't have parchment paper so I greased and floured the 9 inch cake pans and they were done perfectly after exactly 30 minutes.I am definitely keeping this recipe!

This was heavenly indeed! I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" square pan for 30 minutes.  As others mentioned, I too added extra milk (1/4 cup since I made half the recipe). The texture was absolutely perfect, moist and tender with a fine crumb, but not dense. I will definitely make this again and again!

I've been a faithful fan of Allrecipes for years, but always stayed quietly underwater. This cake inspired me so much that I finally made an effort to register so that I can write a review, for I felt it just wouldn't do this cake justice otherwise. Thank you, Carol, for 1000 times for this recipe! I don't consider myself too experienced of a baker, and my first try turned out perfectly, having exactly the texture that I've always dreamed my cakes should be but never came true until now.  I followed Laura Taff's alterations: 1 & 1/2 c. skim milk and 1/2 c. butter with 1/4 c. canola oil. In addition, I used powered sugar instead of granulated sugar. Per Laura's suggestion, I switched around step 2 and the first half of 3 in the recipe, i.e., mixing the batter first before making the meringue. I sifted the cake flour before measuring, and then sifted 4 times after adding in the baking powder and salt. I beat on low really well after each addition of a small amount of flour/milk. I used 3/4 c. cartoned egg whites and it did work - just had to beat longer. I folded in the meringue with a wooden spoon, and I used an oven thermometer to make sure it was preheated and kept at the right temperature. I used aluminum cups and baked for 20 minutes. Aluminum is superior to non-stick or silicone. The result was so perfect that I almost cried. My coworkers all went crazy after those cupcakes. Again, the key is to execute this recipe with the diligence and patience of a scientist. Three key

baked per recipe except added half the almond called for as peppermint instead.  made the cake sort of taste "fresh" but not too minty (which I liked).  otherwise liked the cake but it was pretty crumbly - would have liked somethign that broke off more cleanly while eating as a cupcake - this mix yielded lots of crumbs.

SIFT the flour then measure it, yes there is a BIG difference if you don't. I too used 1 1/2 C milk (maybe use 1 1/4 c next time), made the meringue first then folded it into the batter and added some pureed strawberries to some of the batter. This gave me 24 cupcakes plus a small round layer. I thought these were pretty good, very moist and delicate but there is a hint of eggyness to them. I topped these with a strawberry cream cheese frosting.

I have tried this cake for two seperate events and both times it was the talk of the party. Excellent taste, very moist, and melt in your mouth good. It is worth the extra time it took to make this cake. Wonderful white, wedding like cake.

I made this cake last night and it was amazing! I took the suggestion of following the instructions in reverse order to avoid the Meringue falling and it worked out well. I also added the extra milk to avoid a drier cake. This is a great cake if your looking for something that can hold a frosting. Don't forget to sift! I think that really helps even distribution and a fluffier cake.

I literally made an account just so I can comment on how amazing this cake is! I did use an extra 1/2 cup of milk like other reviewers. I made two batches separately and baked in 12 inch round pans for a big two later cake. It's the perfect base for strawberry shortcake. I stored it in the fridge after topping with whipped cream and strawberries and it stayed moist and delectable! I'll be making this over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!

this is great to decorate and use as a base for wedding/birthday cakes. I did fold the egg whites very delicately, and I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk. It worked beautifully: used white chocolate creme patissiere to fill it, wetting the 2 layers generously before with sour cherry juice, which contrasted beautifully with the cloying sweetness of the white choc. Also, the juice tended to give a soft pinkish color to the cake, which is the desired effect, as the party was for my little girl. So versatile, it's a keeper!

Great recipe. It makes a lovely cake. Not being a fan of almond extract I still enjoyed it, but the family LOVES it and insists I make it again [and again, and again, and again. . .]. It has a great crumb and I didn't find it dense at all.  The trick is to make sure your eggs whites peak and that they are folded in, so be gentle. If you are unsure of how your egg whites should look or how to fold them in the video is a great reference. 
 
I made it as written and with an additional 1/2 cup of milk. The batter is a bit thicker without the added milk, but I could barely tell the difference in the end results. Both were wonderful. It's a keeper.
 
I am anxious to replace the almond with other extracts, such as lemon or orange, and add some zest. I am sure it will be a great base recipe to play around with and make your own. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this cake 5 or 6 times now, and I can not believe I haven't reviewed it yet...It does take some work, but it never fails...be sure to sift your flour before you measure it...it is the most versatile, flavorful white cake...100X better than a box!

Deeelish!!!  Perfect texture.  I made this 2x already, once with almond extract and once without. Both were good, but the almond flavor is very prominent. I used this cake to make tres leches cake and it was completely devoured by my family.  I am a professional baker and this recipe is A+ in my book

In search of a good white cake recipie, this one sounded excellent and after reading all the reviews i thought it would be a winner. WOW was i ever wrong. It is very heavy which wouldnt of been a problem had the flavor been good. I followed directions to a tee, as well as the extra 1/2cup of milk as suggested. I loaded it up with Wiltons fluffy boiled icing and that did not even help it. I would of been better off with a box mix. I deffinatly would NOT reccomend this recipe to anyone.

This cake is fantastic! I did take the advice of others and add 1/2 cup more milk than called for. I also made the flour, butter, and milk batter before mixing my meringue and FOLDING, not beating, it in, until it was just combined. The only thing I will do differently next time I make it is add less almond extract, as I found the flavor slightly overpowering, but this is just a personal preference. This was the softest, moistest homemade cake I have ever made, and believe me, I've made a lot. Definitely try this recipe!!

I've made this recipe twice now and it worked great as a cake. If you use this for cupcakes be aware that these rise a lot so don't fill the liner up more 2/3rds. I made that mistake and they overflowed. I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Great white cake recipe! I used this to make a delightful almond chocolate cake. I brushed the layers with ameretto before frosting with a vanilla butter cream. Then I made a chocolate ameretto ganash for the top. WONDERFUL!!!

I think I am a fairly good baker and this cake had me really excited.  I found it dry and my husband = waiting so patiently for his white cake= wouldn't eat it. I went by the recipe exactly.

Added the extra milk like suggested and it did need it. I thought the almond extract was way too powerful.  I would add more vanilla and less or no almond extract next time.

I am making a wedding cake in October and have been looking for a good white cake recipe. This one turned out delicious and moist but I didn't like the way it baked. I used round pans and the cake fell inwards on the top part so the sides weren't straight up and down anymore. The bottom part was bigger around than the top part which makes filling, stacking, and icing more difficult.

My husband loves white cake without frosting, so I make him one for his birthday each year.  I decided to try this recipe this year. He loved it! It was as white and light as angel food cake without the sponginess that often occurs. Rich and custard-y in spite of no yolks. This is a keeper!

Delicious and simple.  I used for my mother's birthday cake and it was divine with a buttercream and strawberry filling. Decorated the top with fresh spring flowers and the cake looked and tasted beautiful.

Like other reviewers - I added a scant extra 1/2 cup milk and worked with the egg whites after all other steps!    I get why this is called "Heavenly" - because it tastes like a cross between birthday cake and angel food cake.  I would use this recipe again - but did think it had a strong egg-white taste.  I hoped this cake would have a sweeter smell  - like other cakes I've fixed.  But - a solid choice for a basic birthday cake.

The flavor of this cake is incredible. For anyone who has had problems with this cake here are my takes: 1) you MUST use cake flour (I used pie flour from an Amish store. It is called pie flour but it is for cakes and cookies too. 2) you MUST sift the flour before adding the baking powder and salt. I found that after sifting the flour you end up with more than 2 3/4 c. More like 3 1/2 c. So you need to get rid of the remainder of flour- NOT put it into the dry mix. 3) I did follow another users suggestion to mix all ingredients BEFORE making meringue & fold it in- NOT beat it in. I think these 3 things were the key. I also made it in 2 9-inch round pans and it turned out great!

This is a wonderful cake as written. I did not find it either dry nor dense as some other reviewers have written. I made cupcakes with the recipe and they came out wonderful. I baked them for only 20 minutes and they were perfect. I'm using this recipe for my son's birthday party in August.

Mine came out tasting a little too much like flour. I made sure I sifted before I measured and sifted 3 times like the recipe said. I added the extra 1/2 c milk like everyone suggested so they texture was very nice. I also added a little extra vanilla extract becasue the dough tasted like it needed it. The cake smelled and looked wonderful. I will tweek it and try again. I will then update my review.

I followed this recipe word for word and I ended up with something that resembled cornbread. It somehow managed to be strangely heavy and awfully dry. The taste was just okay.  I'm puzzled how others made a beautiful cake out of this! I keep thinking that I must have done something wrong, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But I went over the recipe a few times and I'm sure that I followed it correctly. It was very time consuming (sifting 3 times, etc.) and I was disappointed with the end result. I guess I'll try something else.

I thought this was a very good recipe ingredient-wise.  I followed the ingredient list exactly; however, I did fold in the egg whites instead of just mixing them in.  I also used these for cupcakes, baked a little over 20 minutes if I remember correctly.  It made 36 regular sized ones.  They were also very moist.  The kids loved them!

I used this recipe in place of the boxed cake mix in the Rainbow Clown Cake recipe from this site.  I made cupcakes and they came out moist and delicious.  I think that two of the keys to this recipe are beating the eggs until frothy and sifting the ingredients the proper amount of times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is hands down the best white cake recipe out there. I had a huge order for white cupcakes and scoured the internet for HOURS trying to find the best one. I tried a few out and was not pleased. Desperately I tried this one and W-O-W. This makes awesome cupcakes as well. Follow the directions to a T and you will be glad you did. However, I took the advice of others and added additional 1/2 cup milk. I have not tried it with just the 1 cup milk. This is the white recipe I will use for the rest of my life. Perfect for wedding cakes, sheet cakes, cupcakes, bundt cakes...you cannot go wrong! Go make it. Now.

I thought this was a great cake.  My friend and I made it today we did end up using the extra half a cup of milk and it worked wonderfully.  I have not tried the cake w/o the extra milk so can't talk about comparisons.  In between the layers of this cake we did put strawberry preserves then a layer of whip cream and then sliced strawberries on top of that before adding the next layer of cake.  And we did this is 3 8" pans.  For the icing we did a whipped cream but made the icing one a little sweeter than the one we did for the layers.  The cake was amazing and delicious.  A great spring/summer cake.  I'd love to try it again with different fruits for the filling.

This is the first cake I've ever made from scratch. I personally found it too dense for my liking but everyone else who ate it really enjoyed it. My mother used to be a wedding cake maker and gave this recipe her approval so I certainly can't complain!

This cake was awesome. I have made it twice and came up with completely different results. I tested out the recipe the first time and it came out great. One of my daughters gobbled it up without icing and wanted a piece whenever I would let her have one (I think she would have sat down and eaten the whole thing in one sitting if I would have let her). I had the cake out on the counter because it was just a test cake and my husband kept nibbling on it.  The second time I made it I had a lot going on and wasn't paying as much attention. I made two round cakes instead of one larger one. I overcooked them and it was not good at all (like I read about in a few of the reviews). So when you bake it make sure to take it out when it is still white (because it is a white cake). If you wait until it is golden you have waited too long.

This cake just tasted like a sweet biscuit dough. I followed the recipe exactly.  Did not see other reviewers suggestion to add more milk.  I am going to try to make it again.  The only thing I didnt do was I used splenda instead of sugar.  My Husband and I did not feel well so we enjoyed the sweet biscuits I spread rasberry jelly on top and squirted some whip cream.  It was a lot of work and effort for just a biscuit.

This was the worst cake recipe I think I have ever tried. It looked beautiful but tasted dry and uninteresting. I made it for my husband's birthday- big mistake! I should have listened to other reviews and stayed away from this cake.

My business partner and i used this recipe for a sample cake for finding the right white cake recipe. It looked so perfect when we got it out of the oven. Smelled great... then, turned it onto a cake board and it went flat! also cut it in half, put icing in the middle and around the outside. Decorated it with beautiful blue and purple roses, wrote happy 1st anniversary on it for her wedding anniversary coming up. It looked so beautiful! Then, we cut it and took a bite.  it was more like a flavorless angel food cake.... this was very dry and it fell apart while frosting! i would not reccomend this cake!

This cake recipe is a little labor intensive, but completely worth the effort!  I've never made a "from scratch" cake before and even with my first time I found it to be pretty easy.  I lowered the yield recipe to make a trial cake, sifted the dry ingredients a few times and FOLDED in the soft peaked eggs.  The result was a seriously fluffy and moist cake.  In fact, a piece of this cake was left out overnight and it was STILL soft and moist in the morning.  The taste was just so-so, but I left out the almond flavor b/c I didn't have any on hand.  I am definitely going to make the full yield recipe for my daughter's bday party tomorrow.  Finding an awesome icing to top this cake is going to be my biggest challenge.  ENJOY!

Wonderful for a basic cake recipe. I made cupcakes with the batter instead of a whole cake and they come out simply delightful. Not too sugary sweet, nice and fluffy but with some body.

I did not care for this recipe! I think Duncan Heinz tastes better and much, much simpler.  I followed the recipe to a "T", even used the tips from other ratings, and the cake was flat.

I totally messed up the order of the recipe (two toddlers in the mix) and it still turned out awesome. I am planning on putting fondant on this cake. I always make muffins to try the cake. So far they are a great consistancy and nice taste.

I absolutely love this cake, and everyone keeps raving about it every time I make it.  I used the extra 1/2 cup of milk(I use 1%), I use I can't believe it's not butter, and i use 2 tsp of vanilla extract and omit the almond extract.  I also followed the advice to make the meringue last and fold it in to the batter rather than beating it in.  It really is a heavenly cake!  I used the recipe on this site for buttercream frosting and it is a to die-for recipe!

The almond extract has to go.  It was way too stong and everyone commented about it.  It was also a little dry.  I was pretty disappointed.

I made this cake for my son's fifth birthday.  After many disappointing homemade versions, this was a winner; in my daughter's words, "superb."  I took the advice of one reviewer and made the butter/flour mixture first and the meringue second, and added an additional 1/2 cup of milk.  This recipe is the best; it's moist, tasteful, great!  Thank you.

Made this today in the form of cupcakes for DD's birthday.  Yummy cake!  I took the suggestion of others, and used 1 1/2 cup milk.  Made the batter first, then made meringue and FOLDED in.  Makes a very fluffy, Heavenly, batter.  Great tasting, moist cake.  I topped with buttercream frosting.  Beats storebought by a long shot.  This made 48 cupcakes , filling the cups 1/2 full with batter.  Takes a little extra time, but soooo worth it!  I am freezing some (minus frosting) for another event.  Thanks for the recipe.

This cake baked beautifully and evenly.  I paid attention to other reviews and measured the SIFTED cake flour.  I also measured the cake flour before I sifted it, and I assure you that there's a big difference.  The only other change I made was to add an additional 1/2 c. of milk.  I'm happy with the results.  I used Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting from this site to frost and pipe onto the cake.

great recipe; like a sponge-cake almost.  I added 1 1/2 cups of milk, and beat the egg whites last, after I addedd the milk and dry mixture, so they would stay puffy.  Make sure to beat everything a lot, I think that is the diffrence between a flat, dense cake and a light one.  I spent about 5 minutes creaming the butter and sugar and close to 8 minutes beating the egg whites.  Thank you for the recipe; great with chocolate frosting!

This cake is a pain. I made it twice...Once as stated, and it was dry, dry, dry. Tossed it in the garbage, and took the other reviewers advice...added a 1/2 c of milk. The flavor is not the problem...it is flat. I would not use the pan size that is recommended unless you like flat cakes. Use a smaller pan size, or stick to the rounds, and stack. 1st time, my fault...second time, recipe's fault..sorry.

A lovely light & moist cake. I left out the almond essence as I really dislike it. Had to add an extra half cup of milk as the mix was a little dry before baking. Good base for adding any additional flavour you like.

Will not be making this again. I love almond flavour but I didn't think it mixed well here. It was crumbling apart, not light and fluffy and as others have said is kind of floury tasting. I even got a bit of a cornbread taste from it. Not at all what I was looking for.

I wish I could have tasted the cake made by someone who rated it high... this just did not work out for me, although with the proportions I should have guessed it would be too much flour, and that's just what it tasted like- flour. Perhaps a half cup less would have made it better. It rose well, but it was so dense, not light and fluffy even though my egg whites were perfect. I wanted this to be heavenly, but it wasn't.

I agree with other reviewers about the need for a touch more milk to the batter. The cake was a little dry in my opinion so extra milk will likely fix that. I made this in my brand new 10x15 inch baking pan and cut the whole thing into a number 4 shape for my daughter's birthday party. She loved it!

This cake is great! It is a VERY dense and filling white cake, which I like. Almost a carrot-cake like texture. I made it for Father's Day because my dad only likes white cake. He loved it! This is my 3rd or 4th time making this cake, and here's my suggestions: Add the extra 1/2 cup milk, it made a difference for me. Also I took the advice of another user and made the batter before the meringue. Much easier. Also I only add 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of 1 tsp, or else the almond flavor is way overpowering for me. Also makes great moist cupcakes! Thank you!

this cake is delicious. i am making my first wedding cake in a few days and have been testing all kinds of different cakes.... this one is by the best one i have tried. it is a fairly dense cake, but sooooo moist and delicious. the texture is so soft and superfine and heanvenly because the cake flour is sifted so many times, but the work is work it. i do think it tastes a tad too almondy, but that can be fixed easily, i just won't use as much next time. very good cake!

I can't believe how awesome this recipe turned out.

I BUTCHERED this recipe:
I ran out of milk, so I substituted leftover evaporated milk and water to finish out 1.5 cups of liquid. I used Pillsbury self-rising flour and added no extra baking powder or salt. My meringue was a sloppy mess because I didn't have an electric mixer, so I dumped it in the blender. I didn't have any almond extract so I added extra vanilla to make up for it. I increase the proportions by 50% and pour the batter in three 9" pans. The cake came out of the pans like a charm, but when I tasted it, it seemed not sweet enough and too floury-tasting. I was upset since this was for Thanksgiving. So I stacked the thin, lopsided layers in my cake saver and left it there until Thanksgiving morning. That all happened Monday night before.

THEN... I bought Pillsbury Butter Cream Whipped Icing. When I took off the lid, the layers were exceptionally moist and just barely crumbly. When I iced it, the smell was so wonderful. I grew excited and couldn't wait. I tasted it. It was WONDERFUL. My friends raved about it and it was gone in less than 24 hours. I recommend this recipe to everyone who looks to bake a cake from scratch for the first time. I vote this recipe for FAIL-SAFE quality.

OH MY GOSH! I really don't know what the bad reviews are about because this was absolutely moist, flavorful and delicious...the best white cake I've ever had...and easy!!I didn't sift any ingredients. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and baked it in two round pans, layering sliced bananas inbetween. I also used soymilk(1 cup & 1/2 cup) instead of milk and it turned out amazingly. I used the recipe for One Bowl Buttercream Frosting from this site and it was a complete hit. My brother in law deemed it "slammin'!" The only problem I had was it sort of stuck to the pans so next time I will probably grease and flour the bottoms. Do yourself a favor and make this today!!

I did not think this cake was very heavenly.  Even with the extra milk, it was dry and not sweet at all.  For the time it took, it was very disappointing.

I made cupcakes with this recipe instead of a cake. They were awesome! I took the advice of Eavenger and folded the meringue in, and omitted the almond extract. I did everything else exactly as the recipe said. They had the perfect texture and tasted great. I put them in for about 25 minutes. I will definitely make these again!

While looking for a good white cake recipe I stumbled across this. There were many poor reviews that mentioned that this cake was crumbly and "cornbread" right. I think I'm an excellent baker so I have to admit that I thought maybe they had made it wrong, but that it would be good when I did it. 

It wasn't.

This cake was quite a disappointment. The taste was there, but the texture was so poor that not even a decent flavor could save it. 

It is edible. It isn't BAD - just disappointing. I won't be making it again.

This was my first scratch cake attempt.
I thought the cake came out just right - not too sweet, not too dry, not too heavy.
Thanks, Carol!

i had high hopes for this cake, but was sadly disappointed.
i found this cake to be too heavy, despite adding the extra 1/2 cup of milk everyone else suggested..
and from the words of my sister: "this cake has no taste" - yes.. i too found it to be bland.. 
i will return to my hunt for a good white cake recipe :(

This cake ended up too much like angel food cake for my liking! I was looking for a vanilla cake that wasn't too dense and heavy. It was very easy to make and I used the other reviews to tweak the recipe. Very good and light and fluffy. I added raspberry mousse for filling and topping which was delish. Used 2, 9 inch pans and were done in 25 mins, started burning at 27!

Came out really nice. I think almond extract can be an overwhelming flavor, so I halved it to 1/2 tsp. I still felt the flavor was too much so next time I will omit the almond altogether. Otherwise, really happy with it. I followed other suggestions to make the merengue last and I upped the milk to about 1 and 1/4 cups. It was moist and delicious!

Mine came out a little bit dry, but I believe that I over baked it a little bit. It still had a good taste and with good frosting, you wouldn't really care it it were a little dry. My only dislike about the recipe is that it is time consuming because of having to sift the flour so many times and if you are not taking your time with making sure  you do not get any yolk or water into your egg whites, they won't whip! I had to start my egg whites over because of this. Instead of beating my eggs in, I too, folded them in. Next time I might try the suggestions of adding just a little more milk as well. If you take your time, you will have a great cake. If this is something you want to make on the fly, you may want to consider something else.

This cake is fantastic. The flavor and texture are perfect. This cake will seem dry if it is cold. Bring it to room temperature for at minimum of 30-35 minutes before serving and it is perfect. Also, make sure the butter, eggs and milk are all room temperature before using. This recipe is a keeper!

This cake would have been great if I'd bypassed the instruction to use parchment paper, which I could not separate from the cake.  It tasted good, but the whole thing was a mess!

This recipe was really good. I also added an extra half cup of milk and my cupcakes turned out great. I also did a chocolate variation. I added 1/3 cup of cocoa and omitted the almond extract. I probably should have added just a bit more milk but they were still good and not overly sweet. I tried one without icing and was worried that they would not be sweet enough but once i added chocolate buttercream they were just sweet enough. Good recipe. I will definitely use this again and again.

I haven't even finished making all the cupcakes from this recipe and I LOVE it!  Light, fluffy, moist, AMAZING!!!!  So far I've made 24 cupcakes and I still have more batter.  I will frost these with lemon cream cheese frosting.  I cannot wait for the finished product!  Like other reviewers, I added 1/2 c milk and saved making the meringue for last and folded it in rather than beat it in.

This cake was okay, it was a little bland and not quite as fluffy as I had hoped. Next time I'll try adding some sugar to the whites to keep them fluffy.

I had a pot-luck wedding and my contribution was this cake, as my wedding cake.  I am so amazed with how perfectly it comes out every time, sweet and fluffy, it was delicious and got raves reviews all around.  I made it filled with a cream and frosted with vanilla butter cream. I'll be making it every year on my anniversary, and I so look forward to it!  It is truly a heavenly cake.

I have tried several white cake recipes, in my search for the perfect WHITE cake.  This one came out in the top. Tied for whiteness with only one other cake, but top in taste, and texture. Spongy soft and moist without the flour taste but a light sugar cookie.  3 of the white cakes recipes I tried tasted like that and thats not what I want!!!  This one tasted that way the least.  Made half batch for a test batch and other then that followed it to a T.  Next time I will up the vanilla to 2tsp just for personal taste.   GREAT the way it is.  Only gave it 4 stars since I could not give 4.5 stars. My personal taste would be only up the vanilla (for a 5 stars) otherwise PREFECT WHITE CAKE!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!! :)

A big success with cupcakes.  I did add the additional .5 cup of milk and a bit more vanilla extract.  Fluffy, white and kids gobbled them up.

Absolute delight! I make a lot of cakes and wanted to try something new! With the meringue and the reviews, I thought why not! I have to admit I was concerned that it felt dry after baking, but then when I tasted it, no worries! Wonderful!

Never have I had a recipe that required so much work for such poor results!  I've tried this recipe a few times, from following the recipe exactly to experimenting with different amounts of flour and milk, and no matter what each time I get a cake that is dense and doesn't hold together well.  I find that no matter what I do I have to bake it for at least 20 minutes longer than the recipe says.  I haven't given up, as I need a good white cake recipe and I'm determined to find a way to make it work, but I could not recommend this recipe at all!

I was so excited when I found this recipe.  I wanted to make cake pops and mix homemade lemon cream frosting with this white cake.  I followed the recipe perfectly, even had my mom go over it with me as I baked.  I sifted the flour mixture 3 times, and I even added real vanilla from the bean.  But, it tastes like a glorified pancake.  Delicious pancake :(  I should've read these reviews first because it seems everyone changed up the milk portion and added more!  Well gee, maybe it would be a good idea to update?!  I'm so bummed right now I don't have enough time to start over...I'll just use it anyway.

This cake was really good. After reading other reviews, i decided to add the extra 1/2 cup of milk since so many people suggested it. The batter seemed really thin, but the cake came out great. On my second cake, i didn't add the extra milk to see how it would turn out, and it was just a little bit  more dense. The flavor of the cake is great.

Wow!  I added the extra half cup of milk as suggested in the comments, and this cake was amazing!  I also had to sub in AP flour and cornstarch for the cake flour, but I think it turned out fine.  I made it as a 9x13 and cooked it about 35 minutes, and used cream cheese icing modified from Cream Cheese Icing II on this site.

I am sorry to say that this was one of the dryest and dense cakes i have ever made. I would not reccomend this to anyone. This creator is obviously a very talented cook though by seeing the picture. :)

This is really moist and yummy. I suggest reducing the salt though. It goes well with Seven Minute Frosting.

I did what most people on here said - added an extra 1/2 cup milk and beat the egg whites last so they didn't droop.  It was FANTASTIC!! The name really does live up to it.  It is truely Heavenly.  I wll use this as my basic white cake recipe.

I was very pleased with this cake!  I made cupcakes out of it and couldn't stay out of the batter alone.  It's hard to find a homemade cake recipe that is not heavy and overly dense.  I thought this one was perfect.  The almond extract gives it that something special and the texture is nice and light.  I did need the extra half cup of milk that other reviewers suggested, so thanks to everyone for recommending that!  I am using a chocolate mousse frosting on these, but I plan to experiment with different toppings/fillings.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This cake came out scrumptious! Light, fluffy, moist--everything you'd want a white cake to be. I made this today for Mothers Day and it came out splendid. I definitely recommend it. Just follow the top review and make the meringue last, and FOLD it into the batter. It will not be dense! And do NOT OVERBAKE! Mine was done in only 20 minutes, in two 9 inch pans, so watch it carefully.
I'll definitely be making this again.

Absolutely amazing! This was by far the lightest, fluffiest cake I've ever had. The flavor was perfect, much better than any boxed white cake. I took other reviewers' advice and upped the milk to 1 1/2 cup, and I swapped the almond extract for additional vanilla. Instead of beating in the meringue, I folded it in with a spatula to be sure it retained it's lightness. Other than that, I followed the recipe, right down to the multiple siftings. This is now my go-to recipe for white cake.

OMG! SO DELICIOUS! I did however, make all the adjustments that "LAURA TAFF MADE. ***SEE HER REVIEW FROM JUNE 2006".  She also lists how she made hers low fat.  I however stuck to the regular style.  The only other adjustment that I made in addition to hers, was that I only used 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of 1 whole tsp.  I find almond extract to be extremely strong so I wanted to tone down that flavor a bit.  OTHERWISE, THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND TIME BUT WELL WORTH IT! IT COMES OUT SUPER MOIST AND FLUFFY!  ****MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE MERINGUE LAST AND THEN "FOLD" WELL INTO THE MIXTURE (I DIDN'T BEAT IT IN AND THE RESULT IS AMAZING)!   Thank you Carol!

Looking through the reviews I was expecting a truly "heavenly white cake". After almost 1 and a 1/2 hours in the kitchen trying to get this together, I got a very heavy cake. Even after I put in 1 and /\2 cups of milk, like everyone else suggested. I will probably not make this again. Back to the boxed white cake mixes I guess. :$

This is good but not my favorite. It is more like a sponge cake...very dense but light. I don't think it would be good to torte. It didn't really rise ( and yes I sifted the flour first and then sifted together 3 more times) and it didn't do well in cupcake form-they shriveled up. But it does taste good.

Great recipe. I did have to add the extra 1/2c milk others talked about and I would also watch it with the almond extract. Maybe 1/4 to a 1/2 a teaspoon instead of the full. It kind of overpowered the cake. Also, don't be afraid of the weird texture after you mix everything. It gets really thick and fluffy to where you have to fold it over with a spatula and it makes a lot of batter but it doesn't rise as much as you'd think in the pan. I frosted mine with buttercream icing (recipe from the powdered sugar bag) and the cake soaked a lot of it up so I would put a little extra between layers.

Made these according to directions, but added the additional 1/2 cup milk that so many others recommended.  I thought these were great.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  Fairly moist and fluffy (as far as homemade goes).  The whole family enjoyed them.  I made 19 cupcakes with the batter, cooked them about 24 minutes, and frosted with pink whipped cream frosting.  Mmmmm!

this cake was exceptionally delicious! the only thing different I did was use regular four because I didn't have sifted cake flour. I had to look up the equivilants for each other (it wasn't a big difference) and then it was perfect! I had made a homemade cream cheese icing that added an extra UMPH... hope this helps.

My 12 and 14 year old daughters made this while my husband and I were out shopping. They did nothing right, forgot some ingredients  and it still turned out wonderful. Can't wait to make it next week- the right way with all the ingredients and see how it turns out. :-)

Im hooked! I will never make a box cake ever agin! This is sooo good with my famous chocolate frosting! Its a very moist cake (which i add 1 1'2 cups of milk and a little extra almond extract). I make mine in a 13*9 inch pan and bake it for 45 mins (till the middle isnt liquid anymore). It may vary depending on the oven..THE BEST CAKE!!

We cracked the code!! This recipe tastes like a betty crocker white cake box mix, just the same! I loved it! I added the additional milk, folded in the whipped egg whites and instead of adding almond extract I put two teaspoons of clear vanilla extract. DELICIOUS!! This cake does rise really well so make sure to not over fill the cake pans. This is recipe is a keeper!

I was looking for a white cake recipe that uses butter and not shortening. I followed the recipe exactly.  I used whole milk and did not add extra the way many people did in the reviews. I don't like to change baking recipes because that is a good way to mess it up. Baking is a science project and not like cooking. I whipped the eggs and sugar until soft peaks formed and then transferred it to one of the bowls that I used for one of the sifting steps.  I have a kitchen aid and only one bowl and in order not to wash in between steps this is what I did.  I added the butter and sugar to the same bowl that I used to whip the eggs and sugar. You can do this without messing up the recipe, but you can't cream the butter and then use the same bowl to whip the egg whites, they won't whip because of the oil.  I am saying all this for the novice baker. I know most of you already know this.  I also used the air whip on the mixer to add the meringue back to the batter. I used a low speed and mixed it in.  The cake was light and fluffy and tasted very good.  My guests thoroughly enjoyed it and remarked on how good it was.  The batter consistency is not the same as a box cake, so don't expect it to be. You can tell by looking at it, that it is light because it has all the air whipped into it. I used the parchment paper in bottom of pan, the cake came out without a crumb in sight.The cake was moist and light. Follow the directions as they are written and you won't have any problems.

I used this recipe to bake a Barbie birthday cake ( the one with the doll in the middle, the cake is the dress) and it turned out fantastic.  My husband even asked if I had bought the cake at a bakery- he thought it was delicious!

I have a mixed review about this cake. It was delicious, 5 stars on taste. But I was expecting it to taste and be the texture of white fluffy cake. It was not at all. It tasted , smelled and looked like sugar cookies, which I'm not complaining about because they were so good, but was expecting something different.  I made mine into cupcakes and 1 batch makes exactly 24 cupcakes , I followed the advice of one reviewer to cook for 16 minutes at 350 but it was a little undercooked I found 18 minutes was better. I made these cupcakes for my sons soccer game and I had parents coming back for seconds , so all in all I would make these again for sure. But would find a different recipe if I needed to make an actual white cake.

Amazing! One of the best cakes I've ever had. I added the extra 1/2 C milk like many other reviewers said.

This cake came out soo soft and fluffy! Love it... but I did change it a little. I like white cakes but I decided to add egg yolks to it and it still came out fine. I also did half/half butter/shortening and added 1/2 cup more milk. This came out perfect!!! I made cupcakes w/ this recipe and I should have put less batter in each cupcake. My cupcakes are huge! I will know to put less batter.

The cake's taste and texture is awesome! Sifted the flour before measuring(makes quite a difference) used the recommended amount of milk. I did mix in a small amount of the beaten egg white first before folding in the full amount.

Wonderful cake - light, moist, and just the right sweetness. I followed the other reviewers suggestions - added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and folded rather than beat in the egg white. My mother always told me to fold in egg whites so that you get more 'air' into the cake making it lighter. I used an 8x3" round pan and made 7 cupcakes as well.

I used this cake recipe for my own wedding. I didn't have almond extract so I used double vanilla. The Cake turned out wonderful, and I used it with the recipe for Wedding Cake Icing (recipe found on Allrecipes). Everyone really liked the cake! The recipe was easy and delicious.

would give 4 1/2 stars only becuse it needs the extra half cup of milk. besides that this cake came out perfect for me. nice bakery style consistency to it. i did fold in the egg whites instead of beating them in as called for in the recipe. next time i may go a little less on the almond extract as it seemed to be a little overpowering in the cake. will make again

This is it folks, the perfect white cake recipe.  Be sure to follow suggestions and use 1 1/2 cups of milk and you'll be very happy with the results.  This cake can be frosted with so many different variations, I've done it with whipped cream & straweberries, white cake icing, and also milk chocolate frosting and it is always awesome! I make cakes for birthdays on the side and this recipe is a keeper.

Moist cake with good texture!  I will be adding more vanilla and almond next time because it had a very overwhelming egg and milk taste. The taste was not that bad, but I would have rather tasted the vanilla.

Had to try this cake and it is very good.  Thank you to Laura for summarizing the changes.  I would add one more.  It didn't taste quite sweet enough for my taste so I added 1/2 cup more sugar, and when I make it again I think another 1/2 cup should make it just perfect.  Mine fell in the middle for some reason when testing to see if it was done, but it was a hit at our Staff meeting here at work today.  I also love the fact that is makes enough for 3 layers or a 15X11 cake.  Used butter cream icing with it and it was easy to ice.  Good to have a home made recipe as I have always used a mix for white cake before.

This cake turned out absolutely fabulous!!!!!!  It is so super light and fluffy.  It is the best white cake I have ever had!!!!  They were so light, it was like an airy yummyness!  I was a little worried about using the almond extract, but it did not make it taste like almond at all and gave it an enhanced flavor.  The cake was indeed white.  The only change I made was an extra 1/2 cup milk (used 1% milk)  I also used cake flour and did the sifting that it asked for.  It was the first time that I have ever sifted anything.  I think I will sift the confectioners sugar for the icing as well because I think it will taste better and look better.  I made cupcakes with this recipe and it made 24 exactly.  I had company over and they tried them too and they raved about them!!!!  I am bringing them to a social event and I know that they are going to be a gigantic hit!!!!!!  I encourage you to make them.  I don't see how you could go wrong!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY!   It was dense-not like a pound cake but like a hunk of lead. When I took it out of the oven it immediately shrank and pulled away from the cake pan.   It had no flavor but for the flour.

NOT A MOIST CAKE AT ALL. Very crumbly, poor presentation.I filled the two 9" cakes with the frosting and it became lopsided in the fridge because this cake is so crumbly. Everyone at my New Years party loved how the cake looked, but few applauded the taste.

What a great white cake, so light and moist with a nice flavour.  It freezes well if you want to make it ahead of time but don't want it eaten.  Takes to other flavour like orange with a chocolate icing if you don't like almond.  Makes good chocolate chip cupcakes too if you add 1 cup of chips.

When we made this cake, it was flat, heavy, dry, with an okay flavor. We followed the recipe to a 't,' though, we added 1/2 cup extra milk, as suggested by other reviewers. Hmmm. Don't know what happened. But, I would never make this again.

Beautiful white cake, delicious, moist...  My 12 yr old made this cake by herself, with excellent results.  She did add an extra ½ C milk as suggested by another reviewer. It's hard to stop at just one piece of cake.  It's that good.  We will be making this again.

I've always wanted to make a homemade white cake and I have found the perfect recipe. The texture is somewhere between an angel food cake and a sponge cake. I made a lemon flavored-whipped cream-cream cheese frosting. If you cook it too long then it will be dry like corn bread. Wonderful cake.  ADDED TO REVIEW LATER:  I made this again, but this time the eggs did not form soft peaks. I think it was because I started adding sugar when the eggs were foamy instead of beginning to peak.  But I used it the eggs anyway.  I also took the advice of many reviewers and added an additional 1/2 cup of milk. I also use full fat milk.  My cake turned out excellent and a tad lighter in texture.

This was a delicious light cake perfect for frosting! Remember: sift, sift, sift, then sift again! I did change the amount of almond extract because I knew that the people I was serving it to were not into almond. I did 1/2 teaspoon almond, 1 1/2 teaspoon clear vanilla. It was decadent and once again I was asked for the recipe. My secret? AllRecipes!!!! Thank you, Carol!

I RELY ON THE REVIEWS TO LEAD ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT THIS TIME, I WAS TRICKED.  EVEN THOUGH I SIFTED THE CAKE FLOUR, THEN MEASURED IT...THE CAKE WAS STILL DRY.  I WILL TRY ANOTHER RECIPE OR JUST SETTLE FOR A BOXED CAKE.

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE....IT IS SOO MOIST AND EASY TO DECORATE WITH FROSTING. I DID ADD 1/2 MILK DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THERE IS A DEFERENCE BUT IT CAME OUT WELL. THIS WILL BE THE CAKE I'LL BE MAKING FROM NOW ON UNTIL I CAN FIND ANOTHER ONE THAT CAN BEAT IT... TRYING TO LOOK FOR A CHOCOLATE RECIPE THAT IS SIMILAR TO THIS CAKE... THANKS AGAIN FOR THIS RECIPE....LOVE IT!

Mmmm...delicious. I used a buttercream frosting home recipe on top of the cake. Absolutely fantastic! A bit flour-y at first, but turned out great. Kinda thick, but will make again! Try it with a glass of milk for perfection! :)

This was the first cake I've ever made from scratch and it turned on FANTASTIC. I am new to cake baking and decorating, and I couldn't have been more pleased with the results!! (I even baked this with a toddler trying to assist- and it still turned out foulproof!)

Awesome, delicious cake!  The hint of almond extract adds a lot!  I will definately be making this recipe again!  I made it in a 8" round cake pan, 3" tall.  It worked out great, I had to cook a little longer though.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I have been looking for a white cake recipe that didn't turn out dense like pound cake, and this is it. It's so light and fluffy. Better than our local bakery! Only change I made was adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk and increasing the vanilla by half and decreasing the almond extract by half. Delicious!!!

I was looking for a white cake recipe for my peanut butter and jelly cupcakes... this was incredible!  When I made it, I set it to only 8 servings which made 7 cupcakes.  That's even more than I needed since it was just a trial run.  I left out the extracts all together, but it was so light and fluffy.  I will definitely be using this recipe on a much larger level next time!

I followed this to a T plus took others advice about the milk. It takes a lot of effort to make  It doesn't rise at all, and has a bitter, sour taste. Will not try again.

This recipe made a great tasting white cake.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions about the order in which to do the steps and I think that helped.  Definitely don't forget to sift the flour before measuring it.  And just a side note: I didn't have regular milk so I just used the vanilla soymilk I had on hand and it still worked out perfectly.

Very delicious and moist! I did use 1 1/2 cups of milk like in other reviews. I also forgot to add in the vanilla and almond extract but it was still amazing (I think the icing I used made up for it!) For the icing I used the Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing recipe which I then made a raspberry jam filled birthday cake for my dad. This recipe was a big hit! Loved it, God Bless!

THIS CAKE WAS AWESOME! This is my new favorite cake recipe! I made it for my daughter's 2nd bday (elmo cake), i added rainbow sprinkles to the batter! It was PERFECTLY MOIST and so delicious! Got lots of compliments on it. The almond extract gave it a little extra deliciousness!

I made this cake according to the recipe amounts after reading the reviews which were helpful, especially the one about measuring the flour AFTER shifting.  the only difference is I used extra fine sugar.  I'm trying out different white cake recipes for my sons wedding and his fiance is lactate intolerant so I used that type of "milk" and margarine instead of butter.  It turned out to be a very good textured cake that was very flavourful.  I may have found "The" cake.

Guys this is one of the best recipes out there.  I used this recipe for my wedding cake, and this I changed up this recipe and added orange and lemon extracts to give it a spring flavor taste (keeping the vanilla extract.  This recipe may seem to creat a mess if you are not stationed properly, but it is deffently worth it!!!!!!!

I used 1 1/2 c milk and added an egg yolk the third time I made it and it was much less crumbly and easier to frost. I also only used about 3 1/2 tsp baking powder instead of 4 so it wouldn't have that weird baking powder taste.

Yes add more milk and I beat the egg whites a little stiffer and it was quite a cake! YUMMY! I used a strawbberry cream filling and the traditional all butter buttercream frosting to finish it off.

Nice recipe, it made a very moist white cake.  I baked it in a 9X13 inch pan.  It's a little bland on its' own, but would be stellar with some sort of filling...lemon or berry maybe.  Maybe it was just plain to me because I made a white cake with white icing!  I'm going to try this recipe again in the spring or summer with a fruit filling, it's worth keeping!

I don't like cake, but I made this and I loved it.  I feel sick because I ate so much.  Did add the extra milk and folded in the whites.  I did not sift the flour as I could not find my sifter, so I whisked it, and it seemed to help.  Was moist and not too heavy at all.  This is my new favorite cake recipe!

I'm not sure I made this cake come out so "heavenly"! I followed others recommendations to increase the milk by 1/2 cup (to avoid dryness). I did not use cake flour (but all purpose flour substitution as recom. by All Recipes site), sifted flour before and after measuring. I mixed, then added in meringue mixture last, as someone recommended. I used two 9" round cake pans, but they were only 1"deep, so the batter overflowed into my oven 1/2 way through cooking time and spills began burning, which, I'm afraid, added more of a "hellish" smoky taste to it. It also didn't come out of the pans very well, despite greasing/flouring them.  I don't ever give up on a recipe without trying it a second time...so, when I attempt it again, I'll try deeper round cake pans or try a sheet cake pan, and maybe use slightly less milk.

I do not consider myself to be an "A+ baker", but this was still easy to make and turned out nice. I did add the extra 1/2 cup of milk, which was a good choice.  Also, substituted 2 cups of organic brown rice flour and 3/4 cups all purpose flour, for cake flour.  The result was an almost angelfood-like texture, interesting. (I did this because I didn't have cake flour and I thought the rice flour was a closer texture, so this was a gamble.)

I thought this cake was bland and dry, even though I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk others suggested. I had very high expectations after reading all the reviews and was very disappointed. I will continue my search for a great tasting, moist white cake as this is not it.

Wow..wow..wow.  This will be my permanent white cake recipe (I have a cake decorating business)!! I followed the directions exactly, but I folded the meringue in first and then beat it in.  It was so moist and fluffy! The whole family loves it! I can't wait to hear what the customer says!!!

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  
This cake is gorgeous, its so light and fluffy, it practically melts in your mouth.  I had to make a spare cake just so i would have enough to serve with hungry little fingers constantly pinching a taste here and there lol.

The only thing i would recommend is make sure you cream the butter and sugar for long enough - around 5 mins, the lighter the butter and sugar the lighter the cake will be.  

I also used castor sugar and found the texture to be marginally smoother... overall, this is a gorgeous cake.

This cake has a wonderful flavor and holds up well with consistency when working with kid's birthday pans. It didn't take long to make also

I have never made white cake until I tried this one.  It was a little more time consuming with the triple sifting and beating the egg whites than I am used to. However it turned out really well.  We served it to company and they all had more than one slice and were raving about it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe.  Mine turned out kind of heavy and thick, but I figured out that it was because I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour.  I didn't use almond extract, but added the extra milk that others have suggested.  Great flavor, will definitely make again with cake flour!

Followed the recipe exactly! Made two batches and baked in 9x13 pans for about 35 minutes. Made a two layer cake with them, and it turned out great! The cake has such a nice texture and tastes amazing.

This makes a tasty cake. However, I carefully followed the instructions, added an extra 1/2 cup milk, and still found that it was a little bit dry. The flavor was great, but it was not as moist as I would have liked. I baked it in two 9" pans for 23 minutes.

First time I ever attempted making a cake from scratch. This is the fluffiest cake I have ever ate or made in my life. The only thing I would suggest to the recipe is to mention that it tastes more like an angel food cake than a white cake, although still delicious! And TO THOSE MAKING THIS CAKE: Read all directions before starting everything.. I wasted the eggs and some sugar because I thought it meant to put in 1/2 cup of sugar at a time until you had a cup and a half... then I read on, and you put the rest in later! Woops! So read carefully, all the way through, before starting!

But an AMAZING cake! I was proud of MYSELF for making this cake =]

SOOOO GOOD!!!!! light and fluffy, not overpoweringly sweet, perfect for cupcakes too! One tip, make certain you beat the eggs till at least soft peak form, if you don't the cake will poof down and loose all the air bubbles as soon as it's out of the oven. When I first tried this recipe the eggs were old and were taking a while to beat so I just didn't bother beating them all the way. MAKE SURE YOU DO!!!   ***i always use Fluffy White Frosting with this cake, goes very nicely, like eating a cloud :D

I was thoroughly disappointed in the turnout of this recipe. I made an all-purpose flour substitution, which could be the culprit... otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was very dense and tasted similar to cornbread. Not a great idea to decorate and serve cornbread for your mother's birthday :(

This cake didn't taste good at all. It got really crispy on the outside and was a real heavy type cake. Followed directions as shown and baked @ correct temp. Can't understand why it turned out so bad, I'm usually a good baker, but not this time.

There is no other word besides heavenly to describe this cake!  It was awesome.  It has a fantastic flavor, it was moist and and held up well to frosting.  I will be making this cake many times in the years to come.  

Update 11/7/2015: I've been making this cake for years now and all I can say is leave it alone and do exactly as the recipe says.  When I make this for friends they think I went to a bakery.  Couple this with a good buttercream and you have an excellent cake, moist with a fantastic crumb.  Not heavy at all, but in fact super light and fluffy.  If you follow the recipe.  The only tweak can be flavorings.  Most of the time I make it with just vanilla.  You can do any combo of extracts/flavorings you like.  Just keep the moisture content to the recipe ratios.  2tsp total.

Spectacular. I will never go back to boxed white cake mix. I have a cupcake obsession, so I followed directions almost exactly - I only altered the recipe to add an extra egg white. The cupcakes were fluffy and fantastic. My office was shocked that this was a scratch cake recipe. I had one coworker who refused to believe I didn't buy them from a bakery. I did use cake flour and I sifted the living daylights out of it. I recommend this as an easy stand-by for an intermediate baker, or someone who is ready to try scratch cakes while following the directions carefully!

This is the same recipe from a 1950's cook book called Blue ribbon birthday cake. It was always our cake recipe Mom used when we were kids. However, mine came out like a sponge cake for some reason. Not quite like how I remember it. The whites may have not been beaten well enough.

This is the only recipe I will be using for white cake from now on! I added  
1/2 cup more milk. I batter will be stiff until you add the whipped egg whites. I only sifted the dry ingredients once 
and my cake is super moist! Better than any box cake for sure.  I also used only 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of shortening because I ran out of butter!  Well worth the time on this cake!  Try it you wont be dissappointed!

Great cake! I added 1/2 cup more of milk and used more vanilla rather than almond. I decided to add 1/2 tsp more of vanilla and some more sugar after I tasted the batter. Turned out very moist and yummy. I think I might make this one again :)

this was excellent!! very moist, very flavorful. I followed the recipe to the tee except i warmed the milk a bit so when it was mixed with the butter it would soften it a bit. I also did sift the flour 3x's as specified. I will use this recipe all the time. Much better than box!!!

Delicious white cake.  This is a very heavy cake..just what I was looking for.  I followed others advice and creamed the butter with the flour first and then did the egg whites.  I used regular flour and the cake seemed fine.  I also added about 2/3 cup more milk as others did.  I used about 2 tsp. of vanilla because I didn't have almond extract.  For the icing I mixed 8oz. cream cheese, a 1lb. box of powdered sugar, and 2 tbls. of milk.  This would make an excellent coconut cake by substituting 1/2 of the milk from the batter with fresh coconut milk and shredding lots of coconut onto the icing!

I added the extra 1/2 c. milk recommended by other reviewers and still the cake was too dense and not light enough.  Further, the flavor could have used another 1/2 tsp of almond for a boost.  I didn't have parchment paper and did OK without it, by shooting just a couple quick spurts of no-stick spray into the bottom of the pan(s.)  The edge was a little tough.  Tasted more like a box cake than the bakery cake I was going for.

THANK YOU so much for this quick, easy and delicious recipe. I read the reviews before making it, so added the extra 1/2 cup milk as a just-in-case - it came out light, not-too-sweet and absolutely delicious! Living in a higher elevation, I was having a hard time finding a cake recipe that stayed light and moist, as well as rising properly. This one sure did! Again, thanks so much!

My daugher requested a white cake for her 7th birthday.  I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it!!  I've never made white cake from scratch before, and it was so easy and it tasted better than some wedding cakes that I've had!  I made it a double layer in round cake pans.  It was topped with Barbie decorations and she was so pleased and she loved the cake as well as the whole family!  Thanks!!

This is a gem of a recipe--I would give it 7 or 8 stars if you would let me!  I followed the directions exactly and came up with a gorgeous-textured, good-tasting cake that could take a little handling as I decorated it.  The old recipes with butter are absolutely the best!  Thank you!

This cake was moist and larger than I thought it would be when I placed it in the oven! It grew two inches higher  and cooled to a little less than a quarter inch short of the top of the pan.  It’s a good recipe to keep. I highly recommend it. I covered it with egg white frosting. My husband and an employee loved it????

This is the better cake recipes that i have found. Most of the other ones i have tried comes out tasting like sweet cornbread (yuck), but this one is pretty good. Next time i will reduce the vanilla because i taste to much vanilla. Thanks for recipe.

I'm 19, I go to college for Art. I'm just learning how to cook and bake. It was awesome! This was my first cake made from scratch! I baked this for my grandmother's 82nd birthday. She loved it! She said it was the best birthday gift I could ever give her! For those who have been struggling, I would recommend what other commenters have said in the past: Sift the cake flour first and then measure your ingredients, then sift everything 3 times. I also added another half cup of milk. And (my secret ingredient to a moist white cake) I added to the measured ingredients before sifting 3 times, instant vanilla pudding mix. 

Overall it was GREAT! It was a hit at my grandmother's 82nd birthday! Everyone took a slice home!

Success! My only ingredient change was to use just vanilla flavoring--personal preference. All amounts (including the milk) were kept exactly the same. I did change the order of how I prepared the contents by beating the egg whites just before I folded them into the batter. Everything was at room temperature. The texture and flavor were perfect, light, moist, and not too sweet. However, I could see that any technical deviations, e.g. not sifting the flour sufficiently, not measuring exactly, or stirring/beating in the egg whites could produce less than satisfactory results. Happy to find a recipe that really works.

This had a really good flavor, but my cake turned out a bit dry and denser rather than light and fluffy.  I am not sure what I did wrong, but I will try again perhaps with some recommendations from reviewers.

Great recipe thank you for sharing..I did like others and added the extra 1/2 cup of milk and instead of the 1 teaspoon of almond extract I used 1/2 teaspoon and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  I also mixed the ingredients first before making the meringue.  Fabulous recipe will definitely be my go to recipe for white cake...thanks!

This cake turned out beautifully and delicious!  I followed the recipe except for the following:  I added an extra 1/2 cup of whole milk as suggested by other reviewers, and I made the merengue as my last step and then folded it into the batter.  After reading reviews for a different white cake recipe, I beat the butter and sugar on high for about 8 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl a few times - I think this was a key step.

I used this recipe for my daughter's birthday cake and it turned out wonderfully despite being made the day before the party, a good buttercream frosting kept it nice and moist. I did add the extra 1/2C milk as mentioned in other reviews, doubled the recipe and divided each batch by 4 to make an 8 layer rainbow cake. PHEW! I also used all vanilla extract

Decided on this recipe out of many for my son's birthday cake. Only substitutions were 2 tsps vanilla, thereby omitting almond, and upping milk to 1 1/2 cups. I followed"bakers rules" and folded meringue in. I had a blast putting this together and got rave reviews!  This is a definite add to the recipe box!

I was successfully able to triple this recipe for a larger sheet cake. :) It worked out great. :) I used it to make a 16x16x2 sheet cake. All I did was triple all the ingredients :) I rewrote the recipe with the amount of each ingredient adjusted. In addition, I made some notes to help while making this AWESOME CAKE. I have two Kenmore mixing bowls. Use the smaller Kenmore mixer bowl to make the meringue and use my whip attachment . Note to self, takes a least ten minutes or more to get a soft peak to meringue . Use the larger Kenmore mixer bowl for creaming butter and than adding the white sugar. My dry ingredients and milk will be added to this bowl. Combine my dry ingredients in a regular large mixing bowl. When adding meringue fold into cake mixture a little before turning on mixer. I added the meringue in portions. :) This prevented the batter from over flowing out of the Kenmore larger mixing bowl. :) Will definitely be using again :)

I read the reviews and also added the extra 1/2 cup of whole milk, and I have to admit this white cake recipe is really great! The texture is fairly unique; like a mix between angel food cake and traditional white cake, but it's a happy medium. Holds its shape very well and easy to cut into layers.

This recipe is very dense and more like a pound cake.  I did sift my cake flour as directed and followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/4 c. extra milk.  The flavor was nice but after two days this cake became so crumbly it was hard to eat.  I wouldn't recommend it for a layered cake because it is quite heavy.  I was making a layered cake so I ended up making a different white cake recipe that would be light and fluffy.  I was disappointed in this recipe and would probably not make it again.

This recipe created the best cake I've ever made!!! It was awesome! I made it for a baby gender reveal party and the guests couldn't get enough of it! I was asked if I sell them (um-no) and two people contacted me a couple days later asking me to make another one!
I will say this though....this recipe is a - lot - of - work! I'm not one who bakes from scratch much anymore, I typically doctor up a box mix but this was definitely worth the work.
I followed the many suggestions around the extra milk and folding in the meringue. Heavenly is right!

This is a wonderful, wonderful moist cake. I reduced the sugar to only 1 cup, since I used a very sweet frosting; I also (as suggested in other reviews), increased the milk by 1/2 a cup (for a total of 1 1/2 cup of milk). This is a keeper. I finally found a great recipe for a homemade white cake. Thanks for posting.

I tried this recipe, thinking it would turn out good seeing its high amount of good reviews. But i totally agree with people who said this cake is not good

It taste just dough and nothing else. Though the skewer came out neat from centre, it just taste flour! I used the half cup extra milk as many said

Totally disappointed with the cake.

I used this recipe to make Zuppa Inglese. Baked in two 9" round pans, replaced the almond extract with 1/2 tsp rum extract. When cooled, I sliced each cake into two layers for a total of four. I alternately filled each layer with peaches, strawberries, mascarpone cheese and chocolate mascarpone. Then wrapped in ladyfingers and topped with a whipped cream frosting. The cake was fabulous!

This cake is so delicious. A big problem with white cake recipes is that they can tend to taste like angel food cake and/or be dry. Not this recipe. It is outstanding! I live in CO, so I adjusted the baking powder to 2 teaspoons for high altitude. I used 1 and a half cups 1% milk, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and no almond. 
I did sift the flour into the measuring cup then leveled the top. This step is very important, or you might use too much and make a dense cake! I then sifted all the dry ingredients together 3 times. 
Make sure ingredients are at room temperature, and that the butter is still kind of firm and not melty.
 Also,  whip the egg whites last, not first. Do not get any egg yolk in your whites or any fat what-so-ever, or your whites won't whip up. Egg whites whip better in a glass or stainless steel bowl. Plastic can retain a greasy residue. 
 Alternate the flour and milk starting and ending with flour. Mix only until each addition disappears. Do not over mix. 
If you take these steps, your cake will turn out heavenly! I will look no more for a white cake recipe. Gonna make one today! 
UPDATE: I made cupcakes yesterday. Awesome! I took the time to weigh the flour, and It came to 9 ounces. As long as you don't go over that amount your cake should not come out dense.

I'm so happy with the way this cake turned out.  I followed others' tips and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I baked it in two round cake pans and then sliced the cakes to make 4 layers.  I iced it with Rick's Special Buttercream Icing. The vanilla flavour is fantastic.  What a treat!

I thought this turned out beautifully.  I had to adjust a bit, using 2 1/2 C all-purpose flour, and I used about 1 1/3 C milk since other reviews suggested more milk. And then I didn't have two sticks of butter so I used applesauce for 1/4C of butter. But otherwise I did as instructed, baked it in a Bundt pan for around 45 minutes, and it's moist and fluffy and delicious!

This is absolutely the best white cake recipe I have ever made. I've used it for a couple of family functions now to make cupcakes and everyone loves it. I use a maraschino cherry frosting with it that is delicious with the almond flavour.
The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1/2 cup milk upon the suggestion of others, otherwise it is made exactly as written.  I do agree that those who have not had luck with this cake may not have noticed that the recipe indicates to sift the flour before measuring.  This is very important!

I used this cake as the middle of a three-layer wedding cake (sandwiched with chocolate).  Per other reviews, I increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups, and threw in a dash more almond extract.  This has a lovely silky-soft crumb, just sturdy enough to hold its own against a denser chocolate cake, and froze/defrosted beautifully.

This was just a weird cake. A little dense, but not bad. WAY too salty, which is why I think some people thought it tasted like cornbread. More like a cross between sweet cornbread and angel food cake. I did use the extra half cup of milk, and folded in the egg whites. The taste was just off. Maybe try decreasing the salt and for Pete's sake use unsalted butter!

I thought this cake was moist and delicious. Did add about 1/4 cup of extra milk. I think the only this that I would change is to use less almond extract, maybe half the amount. It is a little time consuming, but well worth it. I used the Real Strawberry Icing from this site. Yum!

This is a very light, fluffy, and delicious cake! I used half the recipe to make 12 good-sized cupcakes and frosted them with the "white frosting" recipe on this site. Both the frosting and the cake are amazing, and together they taste like a lil slice of heaven. I will DEFINITELY be using this recipe to make a strawberry bar cake for Mother's Day for my mom. Yum! ***CHANGES I MADE*** I added 1/4 cup extra milk(add 1/2 if your using original recipe amount) and used all purpose flour since i don't have cake flour. Next time, i will substitute the tsp of almond extract for an extra tsp of vanilla, since i'm not really a fan of almond flavoured cake. Thank you for this amazing recipe Carol!

I made this cake exactly as written, no extra milk, no changes. It is so delicious and moist, probably the best white cake I have ever tasted. It's going into my favorites book.

I made this cake as written and it was tasty and dense on the day I made it.  I used a whipped cream frosting and layered in fresh strawberries.  We enjoyed it.  I could see though, how it could have been better with more milk and the folding in of eggwhites approach. 
The second day the cake was DRY and super dense, almost gummy.  I think I will try the recipe again ( next time I make a cake) with the modifications cited in so many of the other reviews.

4 stars cuz I changed it according to suggestions. = ] EXCELLENT place to start from, tho!! Added the 1/2c milk, certainly folded in the meringue, and no almond (no me gusta). So! All in all it came out like freakin heavenly angel food cake! I made 27 cupcakes & they were a smash hit!! = D However, some were afraid to eat them because they thought they were part of the art show (they were pretty hehe).

Absolutely fantastic!  I did modify it slightly as I didn't have cake flour, so used 2-1/2 cups all purpose flour plus 1/3 cup cornstarch.  I also bakes it in a 9"x13" pan.  It took 35 minutes to bake. I have searched for a light-weight white cake for forever and I have found a keeper with this one!

It was good, but I won't make them again as they taste like sweet biscuits with a cake texture. They didn't taste like cake.

Just made this cake today and LOVE it! I did add the extra 1/2 c milk like others suggested and I did not use the almond extract, just the vanilla and upped the amount some. It turned out great! A wonderful cake with great texture, does not crumble and holds up well!

For the past year, this has been my go-to cake recipe.  I make no adjustments.  Yes, the batter is thick, but it cooks up wonderfully.  We mix up the flavorings (just made it with rum extract last night - fantastic!), and use a whipped frosting rather than buttercream.  It's never let me down.  Be sure to store it in a cake container, though, as it does dry out if left out in the open.

Very good!  These just came out of the oven (I made cupcakes- 20 minutes at 350, and the toothpick came out clean).  They haven't cooled yet, but they're quite tasty!  I added the extra half cup of milk.  Looking forward to filling them with raspberry preserves and topping them with chocolate frosting!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is quite labor intensive.  But worth it!

I'm not a fan of white cake and i loved this cake. I didn't even get it quite right and I loved it. Gave it five stars cuz I know if I had done the meringue right it would have been even better. Awesome recipe, will definitely use over and over!

This recipe is great!  I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk just as others suggested and used only vanilla extract in one cake and orange flavoring in the other.  Add some cream cheese frosting and it's perfection!

What a wonderful white cake recipe!  As many reviewers suggested,  I used the extra 1/2 cup of milk, folded in the meringue at the end, and used all vanilla extract.  Otherwise, I did everything else according to the recipe, including all the sifting.  Result was sheer perfection.  I will never buy a boxed white cake mix again.

Great!!!!!! and Beyond that..  This cake barely made it to get frosted I wanted to eat the entire thing and I'm not a fan of cake too much. The secret to make this cake is to follow the instructions. Be sure to use sifted cake flour, and sift the ingredients again. Make sure to beat the egg whites into a meringue. The only thing I did do was add a bit of extra milk in the last step due to the fact my mix seemed on the dry side. My suggestion is to add a bit of extra milk until the batter seems about right, but the storing the cake tightly covered will keep it moist. Two days later this cake kept well tightly sealed and refrigerated.

I used this for cupcakes as I was running out of time to find a recipe. Big mistake. The flavor was lovely but the cakes were far too dense and dry. I'm not sure how this would fair as an entire cake.

Tastes just like a fluffy sugar cookie. The recipe gives the impression to stir the batter a lot, don't. Make sure not to over stir. Also, add a little more milk because it's too thick. Turned out great otherwise.

A delicious and delicate cake. I added 1/2tsp of lemon extract instead of the almond. I also added some lemon zest to the batter. It was light, moist and by far the best "white" cake I've ever eaten.

I loved this recipe.  I had another recipe that had something off with the sugar because the tops kept overcooking, but this recipe turned out perfect.  Definitely use the extra 1/2 cup of milk, it needs it.  And folding in the egg whites works well.  One thing I learned was not to use egg whites from a carton, they really don't whip as well, so the genuine egg whites are best.  I will use one tip I read today about doubling the vanilla (I too left out the almond as not everyone cares for that flavor).  I also didn't sift (I didn't have a sifter, I've recently bought a new one).  However I did kind of cut the dry ingredients with a knife for a few minutes and it seemed to turn out just fine, though I'm sure sifting will make it lighter. I bought an 8 cup sifter for double batches.  I found this a very easy cake to make, and will never use a boxed cake again.  The only thing I'm on the hunt for now is a substitution for some of the butter to make it a tiny bit healthier!

It is still in the oven, but I wondered about whether that was too much batter for 2 9" pans...Yup!  Smells good, batter tasted excellent.  I suspect it will be a winner!

this cake is good. you will have to experiment with different flavors to get the right taste you may want.  I omitted the almond extract and used butter emulsion and 1/4 tsp of lemon just to bring out the flavors of the vanilla and the butter. Will make again but play with the flavorings a little more.

That's the last time I change a recipe. My cake turned out horrible because I just threw everything together without following the directions. Why does it matter if you sift the flour or beat the eggs to a fluff? What difference does that make if everything's just getting mixed together anyway?

A+!
This is traditional white cake the way it's supposed to be done!It takes a while longer than yellow cake because of the meringue. That's what makes it WHITE cake, and not yellow.

Amazing! I love this cake.  I increased the milk to 11/2 cups and I used Almond milk (I was out of regular milk) and I didn't have almond extract, I used 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract in it's place.  Also folding the meringue into the cake worked well.  I filled the cake with guava jelly and coconut flakes and it was omg fantastic.  I normally would make a frosting but I used a can of fluffy white and placed toasted pecans and coconut on top and believe me, this is one of the best cakes I've made.

After much trial and error, I've finally found a great white cake recipe. This cake is very moist and fluffy. Please listen to other reviews and add the extra 1/2 cup of milk. This will be my go to recipe for white cake now. Makes for a great Confetti cake aswell.

Delicious! Made my own cake flour, left out the almond extract, used a cream cheese frosting (care of allrecipes of course!), and added fresh strawberries.  My husband, my two sons and I thoroughly enjoyed this cake - very moist, light and tasty!

This was a nice cake. It was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. I would have liked a little more flavor, so I will keep looking, but if you are using a butter cream it would be perfect.

This recipe is from a 50s cookbook that I have, I actually made this recipe for my husband's birthday, giving it a try, instead of 3/4 C butter, it calls for shortening (The original recipe), but the exact same amount of each ingredient, butter or shortening it's okay, not the best.

But I am giving my rating to the original person who printed it in the 50s since it's their recipe.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! The almond extract makes the cake taste GREAT - just because I love the smell of almond flavoring anyway.  The cake itself surprisingly turned out more light and fluffy than I would expect from a standard slice of cake.

My 12 year old daughter made this for her first "scratch" cake, with verbal assistance only. It was delicious! We added the extra milk and folded in the merengue. It sat over night, covered, and we decorated it next day. It was perfectly moist and delicious. It sank just a bit as it cooled, but probably because it cooled all the way before we remembered to take it out of the pan. It's good for decorating, because it remained flat and didn't get that hump in the middle that cakemix cakes get. May try some other recipes but this will be a "go-to" when we need perfect results.

I used this for cupcakes and doubled the vanilla, leaving out the almond extract.  I added cream cheese icing and my crowd loved them!  Nice and dense...feels substantial and not all crumbly like box mixes.

I usually stick with the Wilton white cake recipe, but I didn't have enough egg whites so I tried this recipe and followed the suggestions of others. I was very please with the texture and density of the cake. However, I found it to be very salty. Did anyone else have this problem?

The cake turned out pretty well.  I added the 1/2 cup of milk that others suggested and folded the eggs in at the end.  The flavor is great and it's very moist and light, but I made cupcakes, and they didn't rise very well.  Luckily, my son is turning one, so he won't remember the funky cupcakes!  I think it would be fine for a regular cake pan, just not cupcakes.

I thought this cake was just ok.  It was fairly time consuming to make and the end result, in my opinion, was not really any better than box mix.  

As others have stated, the cake doesn't really rise very much, which made for some funny looking cupcakes.  I did have enough batter to make 24 cupcakes and still have some batter left over.

Moist and delicious. I did use the extra 1/2 cup of milk that others suggested. I put lemon curd in between the layers and a simple white icing all over. It was fantastic. Even got rave reviews from my soon-to-be in-laws!

I used this recipe for a baby shower cake a couple of weeks ago. It was divine! Filled a 12" and a 6" round pan with one batch. Made a second batch to complete the cake. It was so moist and fluffy! I did read the comments ahead of time and reduced the amount of milk as recommended. The sifting process took a little extra time, but is well worth the effort to have such a great cake. The vanilla and almond extracts make the cake very flavorful as well, which is unusual for a white cake. My family didn't get to eat any since it was for a shower, so last weekend I made half the recipe just to eat at home. My precious granddaughter chose the icing color and called it "her" cake. It was a big hit - didn't even last the whole weekend!

This is an excellent white cake!  I always add an extra half cup of milk, and it is the moistest cake I make.  I've served it many ways, including frosted with cream cheese frosting and topped with strawberries on one occasion, and filled with chocolate custard another.

Wow! It turned out perfectly! Taste is lovely as well. I added the 1/2 cup extra milk. I made 2 cakes, 1 with strawberry extract, and the first the merange didnt turn out but it didn't hamper the cake at all.

This was WONDERFUL!  I did add an extra 1/2 cup milk and did step 2 after step 3.  It was moist and fluffy and perfect!  Everyone gave it 5 stars!  I used this as the base for Rainbow Clown Cake and the possibilities for extracts are absolutely endless!  Orange and lemon and rum.  Yum....  Thank you!  This will be my go to for White Cake!

Great moist cake!  Nice and light.  My 17 year old son ate 1/4 of the cake before I stopped him.  He loved it.  This is the first scratch white cake I've liked.  I did add the 1/2 cup water as was suggested.

I was so excited about making this cake and it was absolutely the driest cake I have ever made.  I received a new Kitchenaide for Christmas and was truly disappointed the way it turned out for my company.  No time to change or make another cake.

This recipe was great for what I needed it for.  It is very dense so it was easy to carve into a shape for a cake.  It was very yummy and moist too though.  A little heavy on the almond flavor for my taste so next time I will decrease that, but other than that it was a great tasting and easy to make recipe!  I will be making this again!

I made this cake once and will be no means make it again. The flavour was very bland and it crumbled very easily and left your mouth feeling dry.

I made it with eggnog to eventually turn it into a Christmas sherry trifle... mmmm... didn't read the reviews (to add the extra 1/2 c milk) until after my lumpy and stiff dough was a'cookin'....  but it'll probably taste fine anyway..  if it's dry, one can always add more sherry...

I have now worked with this recipe 3 times personally and had my Grade 10 foods class make cupcakes, and them decorate them.  I read a number of the reviews and made sure that the sifting happened correctly and that we used 1 1/2 cups  of milk.  My son loved his cake and my students all give a resounding yes to this recipe.  This recipe is sturdy enough to stand up to decorating and still tender.  I am placing this in my pile of must keeps.

really good cake, it was a bit dense (but I like a slightly denser cake) but also moist. I saw that other people said to add an extra 1/2 cup of milk, but I decided to add 1/2 cup of amaretto into the batter. Tasted amazing! Made a nice layer cake out of it with chocolate icing. Would definitely make again!

Perfect flavor! Perfect cake! I did skip the almond essence because of allergies and use clear vanilla. I used it in an insulated pan and after baking the center fell by a tiny bit -but it was still perfect and moist and made me a rock star for my kids birthday. And FWIW -I made mine the week ahead and froze it. It was awesome.

Love this recipe! The only thing I did different was add Sweet Dough emulsion and butter extract. I didn't need the extra milk. It came out light and fluffy and flavorful. This is the first recipe from scratch I've tried that tastes better than the boxed! Thank  you!

Added the extra 1/2 cup milk as suggested and also used the icing recipe mentioned by others. It was labour intensive, BUT well worth the extra effort. An absolutely yummy cake.

Taste was simple, a little bland, but not bad. But the huge problem I had was that every time I made this recipe, the cake would stick to the pan. When I finally managed to get the cake out, it would INSTANTLY break apart, leaving me with a mess on the floor and a horrible looking cake. Even though I sprayed on the pan so much, it still stuck. I'm not going to make this again!

This was absolutely delicious. Very light in texture. It didn't rise very high but with three layers I didn't mind. I'm pretty sure those who say it turned out "floury" for them didn't sift before they measured. Mine was excellent. I used two tsp. of vanilla as I didn't have almond extract. I also used a butter/margarine blend.

This cake was VERY good. It tastes amazing with Betty Crocker vanilla buttercream frosting. I made it with a couple friends and we're only 13! It was simple and easy. We'd made it for our class and they loved it! BY the time they ate it, it wasn't fresh but still very good. I reccomend this to people that have a sweet tooth.

This cake is okay. I've made it twice now. All the steps and effort are not worth the result.  The cake comes out tasting very floury and the texture is also off.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous when my niece requested white cake for her birthday, because I've made yellow, but never white.  So, never having made this, I worried that it would not be moist enough.  But it really turned out wonderful.  I followed the suggestions (1 1/2 cups milk, fold meringue in after everything else is mixed), and I watched very carefully to be sure it didn't over-bake.  I iced it with a vanilla buttercream and filled it with the same buttercream with fresh strawberry mixed in.  It was a huge hit, and I think was one of my best cakes yet (and I've make many many cakes).

I loved this it was so moist. I did the flour and the butter part 1st and then the egg whites. I also folded the whites in to give extra fluffiness. Adding the extra milk was a good idea and i omitted the almond ex and added 1 more tsp of vanilla. all in all this was one of the best cakes I've made thanks for sharing it.

It was a good cake, nice and fluffy, but the recipe calls for far too much almond extract, if I use this recipe again, I'll use half the almond extract

I didn't follow the directions exactly, as it was confusing to me. I also didn't have cake flour, so I had to use all-purpose flour which made my cake heavy and dry. I didn't like the texture of the cake. The next time, I will use cake flour and read the recipe thoroughly before I begin.

AMAZING!!  This was the best cake I've made, which is saying a lot, because I've made so many.  Not only did it taste good, but the texture was perfect.  It was light and fluffy.  I will definitely be using this again.

This cake was AWESOME! Yes it's a little denser than I'm used to but it still had a light flavor so it was absolutely perfect! I used the adjustments that were in previous posts (more milk, folding in meringue, mixing other ingredients before making meringue) and was VERY happy! I did have a hard time with my meringue and never got it to stiff peaks. It seemed to stay in a creamy stage for what seemed like 10 minutes of beating so I gave up and used it as it was. It was still fine! I used A whipped Cream frosting posted by Tom Parker and voila! Perfect birthday cake! I highly recommend this recipe!

Very good! This becomes my go-to white cake recipe. I bake a lot from scratch so I didn't find the recipe difficult to follow (of note, I folded in the egg whites instead of beating them). Since I can't have any dairy, I used a dairy-free stick "butter" (at room temp) and almond milk and both worked great (I do this substitution for all of my baking). I also increased the milk to 1.5 cups and decreased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp as was suggested by other reviewers.

I used an extra 1/2 cup milk and it only took about 20 minutes to bake. Absolutely luscious, moist cake. I would recommend starting with 15 minutes and watching it so it doesn't get dry.

I loved this recipe. I know making a cake from scratch is time consuming, but we all know there is a difference in homemade and from the box. This cake is very moist....very. I used a strawberry jam icing and everyone loved it. The cake is even great by itself because it is so fluff and moist, kind of reminds me of a angel food cake. Also, always fold in the meringue...not beat.

I wanted to say that I made a trial cake of this recipe. And, it was melt in the mouth good. I did use the extra 1/2 C milk as suggested, and I thought the batter looked curdled. But, the cake turned out great!

*** 03/03/2010 ***
I wanted to add that we left the cake sitting out for a couple days with just BC coating. And, it was still moist when we cut into it. I think this recipe is really good

There is too much butter in this cake, which makes it very heavy and although it tastes good, it sits very badly in the stomach. Will look for a lighter version in the future.

This was a really nice recipe.  I followed it exactly except that I decreased the almond extract a bit and made cupcakes.  They were very moist.  I have also made them with only a cup of sugar and half wheat pastry flour, half unbleached white flour.

I've never made a homemade white cake before, and I thought this would be a good recipe to try. I found it pretty simple to put together. I made it exactly as written, without adding the extra milk. I didn't want to beat in the whipped egg whites as the recipe said, because that would cause them to fall, so I folded them in instead. The batter was pretty thick, but not unmanageably so. The cake baked up very well, nice and high and golden brown on the edges. The cake itself  was pure white and tender, but slightly dense in texture. Not bad, but not as tender and soft as a cake mix. I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but it is a decent cake recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I think the flavor was good, although I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup because we're not big on sweetness. The flavor turned out to be perfect because, don't forget, your icing will be sweet too! I also added the extra 1/2 cup of milk as recommended by other reviewers. However, the cake came out really dense. Other reviewers stated they got light and fluffy results. I will try this recipe again but with different manipulated variables next time, perhaps without the extra 1/2 cup of milk.

Good recipe. The consistency of the batter was off so I did add an extra 1/2 cup of milk as other reviews recommended. I mixed the meringue just before adding it and didn't beat it in but folded it in thoroughly to keep the cake fluffy. It came out perfect.

I just made this cake as per the instructions.  I have to say I am a bit disappointed.  It really lacks in flavour dispite a more then generous amount of vanilla.  Definately needs more in terms of flavor.  I was looking for a denser cake so in that respect it was fine but not the cake you want if you are looking for light and fluffy. Merangues (sp?) should have been done second as suggested by others.  I might be willing to give it one more try and use some of the suggestions made.    Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe. Turned out lovely! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the waste of yolks. :P Sorry, I can't stand wasting anything. The cake was delicious though! I covered it with Bailey's Dark Chocolate Ganache and filled it with a Bailey's/Cream Cheese filling.

I was not so scientific when I made this cake and it still turned out great. I used all purpose flour and omitted the almond extract (don't like it) -- made it a tablespoon of vanilla (it wasn't a really white cake in the end-- but that's ok). I forgot to add the half cup of sugar to the egg whites-- added it all to the butter, but it didn't matter. It was a tender cake with lots of flavor. Made a chocolate buttercream frosting for it and it was all really rich and wonderful! Made my sullen 13 year old come out of hiding to eat a slice. That's good cake!

I followed the directions and made a couple of changes as suggested by other users but this cake did not meet my expectations even closely. I would have been better off using a boxed mix for a lot less trouble.   It shrunk in the pan quite a bit. I assume that is due to the meringue. Makes the cake look like I didn't add all the ingredients. The taste is OK but not heavenly. Sorry, but I just didn't care for this cake at all.

This would have been a good cake except there were about 3 teaspoons to much of baking powder. The cake turned out like white vanilla biscuits. and frosting made with shortening is like putting lip balm on after you finish eating. I would not recommend this cake unless you want biscuits with frosting.

The cake tastes great but it fell apart when I took it out of the pan. This was VERY disappointing as I followed all the recommendations. I won't be making this cake again.

This was a very tasty white cake.  It had the perfect amount of moisture and with frosting was a hit after Sunday dinner.  I added .5c of milk like others had suggested and it was great!

Holy !!!!!!! This is the most amazing melt-in your mouth cake I have ever tasted! I used this recipe to make 24 superb cupcakes and it was the exact right amount. Changes: 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and definately make the meraingue right before. I sifted the cake flour and sifted all the three dry inredients 3 TIMES! Make sure you do that. I really think it makes the most difference. I'm pretty sure thats all the changes I made. I almost dont even want to frost these beautiful cupcakes!

Im jumping up and down with joy finally a white cake that is light and fluffy that also taste great!!!! I looked at other reviews and went with the 1 1/2 c milk and mixed the egg whites last then folded them in. I added 2t vanilla instead of almond just because I prefer vanilla. I also didn't have time to sift and skipped that part .  The cake still turned out moist and fluffy. found my reciepe and will only use this one

I cannot give a rating on the recipe as is as I altered it considerably and it is lovely altered: light and fluffy!  1 cup of milk as indicated  but then after I beat in all ingredients apart from the whipped egg whites I folded in:  1/2 cup of ginger ale  followed by: beaten egg whites with sugar  The ginger ale added some lightness to the cake. I baked it in a round bundt cake pan, split it in half, filled it with raspberries and sandwiched the two halves and topped with a cream-cheese frosting for a birthday cake. Delish!

This is quite possibly the best cake I have ever tasted or made. I will never use another white cake recipe.  The only change I made was adding lemon extract instead of almond. Depending upon the humidity of the day, I may or may not add an extra 1/2 cup of milk like the other reviewers suggested.  Thanks a ton!

This recipe was fantastic!  I followed the measurements to a "T" and never needed to add any extra milk.  I can't believe how light and fluffy this cake was.  I finally found the perfect homemade white cake recipe.  This is going in my recipe box.....definitely a keeper.

This cake turned out absolutely awesome, and I added 50% more milk than the recipe calls for as others suggest in their reviews. The cake was so light and fluffy and moist, it was honestly the best consistency of cake I have ever made!

Good cake recipe.  I was using this cake recipe to make a "mock" olive garden lemon creme cake.  So I followed the recipe exactly..but added the zest of one lemon and juice from a half a lemon..gave it a light lemon taste.  I made it in mini cake pans and baked for about 18 mins.

I am expanding my cake recipes and this one "takes the cake" for a white cake recipe. Moist and delicious, and very white. Takes a little time to put together, but the results are  fantastic. I did however add a little extra milk as some other reviews suggested. I used this recipe for a layer cake with lemon filling and cream cheese frosting. Thanks.

I made this cake for my son's first birthday with the White Cake Frosting I from this site as well. It was an honour for me to make a beautiful cake for my son and our guests. Everyone raved about it! The cake was very moist and tasty (I used 2 tbsp of vanilla as I didn't have almond extract) and the icing is very professional looking icing and easy to work with. This recipe will always be the cake recipe I use! I'm throwing a baby shower for a friend in a couple weeks and I'm going to use this receipe again! Thanks a million Carol!

This cake is just OK.  It has a great flavor, but is VERY dense.  I mean, really dense!  I made it exactly how it's written, and am really disappointed.  For the amount of work that goes into it, to me it isn't at all impressive.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again :(.

I finally found a white cake recipe that I like to make and holds up well for decorating. The only thing I changed was add 1/2 cup of the sugar to the egg whites and whipped them into meringue. Also, I just folded the meringue into the batter.

This cake was awesome!  I made it for my son's birthday party and it was a hit.  Turned out light and fluffy. I froze the 9"x13" cake to cut into a puppy shape and it was very easy to work with.  Frosted with Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting on allrecipes and several people said this was the BEST cake they've ever had.

This cake turned out better than expected.  The only thing I wasn't wild about was the almond flavor - I thought it was a bit strong. I think I will reduce the almond to a 1/2 teaspoon next time.  Also, I made this with margarine instead of butter (which doesn't always work) and it turned out great.    P.S. - If you don't have a way to sift the flour just reduce the amount to 2 and 1/4 cups.  I did that and didn't need to add the extra milk others mentioned.  I'm glad I didn't, the milk called for was plenty.

This is an awesome white cake!! I didn't have any almond extract so I added 2 tsp almond paste to the recipe. It's perfect. Not too sweet either.   I will definitely be making this again!

Turned out great, thanks a ton for sharing, I substituted white for brown sugar & used orange zest instead of vanilla & almond. Added a little extra milk as the mixture seemed a bit dry. I used white chocolate as frosting, everyone loved it. Tks

This cake is excellent. I will admit it took me about two months to get it perfect, because at first it had a cornbread texture. After a few small tweeks it is now the moistest cake besides my mothers that I have ever had.

WOW this recipe was great the only thing I did different was I had no extract in my house at all and then suddenly it came to me...Lemon Juice! I didnt really measure it though I just kinda poured it in till I thought the batter looked about right. I also squirted in some limes, and then poured a lemon lime glaze over this fabulous desert everybody loved it! It wasnt even for a certain occasion just another ordinary night and I still had nothing left on the plate because everyone just loved it. Thank you so much this is now my official cake recipe

Not bad at all.  I can see why some said it was "eggy" or similar to angel food cake.  Overall, a super moist cake.  I made it with the additional 1/2 cup milk and did 2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cup of almond and it almost tastes like Duncan Hines white cake, which I normally use.  I thought it was a tad gummy so I may try it again using only 1-1/4 cup milk.  I ate it practically right out of the oven.  The true taste will be the next day after being in the refrigerator, and with frosting.  I still can't believe how moist it was.

I agree with others, more like a sponge cake. Taste was good. It was a lot of work, maybe not so much if you have a stand mixer. I used the extra milk and folded in the egg whites and then beat more. I will probably make again.  Thanks

While the cake is delicious, it takes WAY too much time for me. Between the sifting and beating, it took me quite some time to put this together, which is the challenge of a white cake, I suppose. I'll stick with my dense, dark chocolate cakes from now on...less work!

this was the best cake recipe ever. I made this one for my daughters 3rd birthday and all the parents raved. It reminded me of the cakes you eat at weddings, real professional. It did take time to put together but it was worth all the sifting and egg beating! I topped it with "quick and almost professional butter cream icing", lovely!

I've made this three times now and it's become a family favorite.  I failed to beat the egg whites sufficiently the first time and the cake was a little dry - but the flavor was so good, I tried it again.  This time I followed the recipe more exactly and it turned out perfectly. My only variation was to use 2 tsp. of vanilla and no almond extract. I also used bakers sugar the third time and it made it more moist as well.  I'm amazed I can make a cake this good.  Seriously, wedding cakes aren't this good!

I frosted it with Wedding Cake Frosting also from this site and it's just so good.  I'm using this recipe for my twin daughter's second birthday this weekend.

Good white cake, I followed the advise of others and didn't add all the almond flavoring...BIG MISTAKE.  I like my cakes to have alot of flavor. Next time, I'm going to follow recipe and add extra vanilla.

This really is an amazing cake. I didn't change a thing but just wanted to mention that I used 3 heart shaped tins and it turned out well. Just remember if you are doing this that the cake will require less time to cook....approx 23 minutes in my gas oven. Also, because these layers are thinner, make sure that they are well cooled before flipping them and definately use the oil spray and flour, parchment paper or wax paper in the bottom of the pan first. Thank you for such a great recipe!

I made this cake for my brother's birthday - and my husband liked it so much he requested I make it for his birthday, too! My mother also requested the recipe to give to a friend. I took a previous reviewer's advice about adding 1/2 cup more milk to the batter, making the meringue right before combining everything together, and measuring the flour AFTER sifting it (not before) - this definitely made the difference.

This was just okay way too dense might have to try sifting flour before measuring if I try it again.  Not very flavorful either.  Sorry just didnt do anything for me or my kids.

An AMAZING cake, honestly, I did a little dance after I tasted it. Very light, but held up to the mini chocolate chips and chopped cherries I added. Topped it w/ an american vanilla frosting. I added the 1/2 cup extra milk, creamed all ingredients together before whipping egg whites, and only used 1/2 tsp. almond ext. YUMMY! I'll definately use it again!

I have made this cake three times now and it is FABULOUS!!! However, I did tweak a few things each time and now I think I've found the perfect white cake recipe! The almond flavor was a little too much for me so I cut it down to 1/2 tsp. I added 1/2 C. applesauce which makes it even more moist. Instead of beating the meringue into the batter I folded it in. And I baked the cakes (two 9 inch pans) for only 25 minutes and they came out perfectly (although I do understand that oven temps vary).

This cake had a really nice flavour and was not as difficult as I thouht it would be to make. I didn't have cake flour so I just tried it with sifted all purpose flour and it turned out just fine.

I made a "test run" cake last week to see if this recipe would work for a wedding shower.  I replaced the vanilla extract with orange extract.  It gave the cake a light fruity flavor.  This is the recipe I'll use for the shower.  Thanks!

This cake is great! I have made it for an engagement party and a baby shower, and both times it got rave reviews. I must say, however, I have yet to try this recipe as written. I add half of an 8 oz package of cream cheese in with the butter and do everything else as usual. Makes for a nice dense cake...mmm.

Stop looking for a white cake recipe. This is it. It's has the same texture as a boxed mix but without the chemical bleached taste. The best! Everyone loves it! My personal choice for frosting is "Fluffy White Frosting" posted by Vickie.

I used soy milk and it was still so incredible that people who don't even like white cake had seconds.
I served it with a great homemade icing of cream cheese, powdered sugar, orange juice and a little amaretto.

You can't get a much better flavor in a white cake than this. This cake is fabulous. I followed the directions exactly. The parchment paper didn't seem to be enough, should have listened to my instincts and used Bakers Joy like I usually do when making cakes. I am frosting this with ganache because it is everyone's favorite here, will try the whipped cream another time. I am thinking other reviewer's didn't follow directions correctly maybe that was why there cake came out dense and not sweet. It is definitely sweet enough. It was reminiscent of a wedding cake flavor. *****Thanks*****

I consider myself to be an above average baker and this was the first homemade white cake that I have ever tried. It was phenomenal!! I took some to school and some to work. People were asking me if I would take orders for Thanksgiving. Another asked me if I would consider doing a wedding cake, it was that good!! I made sure to follow the recipe exactly including the sifting and adjusted the milk to 1.5 cups. A must for everyone to try!!

If I could give this more stars I would!! This is an incredible cake! Almost like a sponge cake but better!  I too added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and baked it in 2 9" heart shaped pans.  I then filled and frosted it with a whipped cream and pudding base frosting.  The taste and light texture was incredible!  Only problem I have found with it is that now EVERYONE wants me to make them one!

Easy to make and very good flavor - using vanilla and almond extracts is great.  I made no substitutions and baked it in 2 9-inch rounds. I gently folded the meringue into the batter (instead of beating as described) to maintain some lightness.  I put caramel sauce b/w the layers and frosted with sweetened whipped cream.  Will make again.

This recipes has a lot of steps.  I made a mess trying to sift the dry mixture three times.  I added a extra half a cup of milk as well as half a package of white choclate pudding mix. I made cupcakes and cooked them for a little over 20 mins. They turned out great.  I iced them with choc. buttercream and they were a hit.

Everyone loved this cake. I wish it was a tad bit more moist. But it held up well, and I used Raspberry filling in the middle of the cake. And topped it with the Buttercream icing (which wasn't my favorite).

Delightful! I had been craving cake, and this is just what the doctor ordered. I followed the advice of others and tweaked a couple things. I used 1.5 c soy milk (I didn't have regular milk on hand), 2 tsp vanilla extract, and no almond extract. It was actually a little TOO moist for me with that extra 1/2 cup of milk, but still delicious, and REALLY good topped with rasberries.

I also made this cake with the modificiations mentioned by Laura Taff.  Halfway through the preparation, I realized that some one had drank all the milk!  I had a can of evaporated milk, so I used that instead.  I used Country Crock instead of butter and vanilla extract only.  I was a little worried about the recipe after reading the reviews.  However, this cake turned out DELICIOUS  and MOIST.  My husband, kids, mother and brother all loved it.  I made two 9" layers.  I frosted with Duncan Hines whipped frosting.  I mixed some of the frosting with raspberry extract and red food coloring for frosting inbetween the two layers.  I did whip the eggs last and folded, not beat, them into the mix.  I will definately be making this cake again!

I tried to do cupcakes with it and the recipe took forever to make and it turned out dry and hard, even my icing couldn't save these cupcakes... maybe I did something wrong but i was pretty sure I followed the recipe right... anyway i might have done it wrong so i won't rate it... i don't suggest this anyway though

This recipe was more complicated to prepare that I had originally though, but it was well worth the work involved.  I made this cake for my son's first birthday.  It was really delicious and a big hit.  This is now in my recipe box, will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good basic recipe.  I've made it in 2 layers filled with lemon filling and in 3 layers for Tiramisu layer cake (made w/all vanilla extract).  I substituted a scant 2 and a half cups of all-purpose flour for the cake flour and used 1 and a third cups of milk.

I must say this cake was a huge hit at my house I put sliced strawberries on top which added a bit of a fruity appeal, it also made it a bit sweeter.  I often make baked goods for my hubby and seeing as my brother is visiting he is a cake lover as well and wants me to bake him one before he leaves.  I followed the white icing recipe and and it was great as well.  I followed this recipe to the T and it turned out PERFECT wouldn't change a thing!

This is the first cake I have ever made in my life that wasn't out of a box, and it turned out great. Even my wife was impressed, and said it was great. I used butter-cream frosting, and it was good, but next time I will try cream cheese instead. Pretty easy to make, and I will make it again. Good cake!!!

This is a moist but crumbly type cake. It is very good however, it tastes more like a pound cake instead of a white cake.

This cake was a delicious cake, it was a little bit heavy, and I had to add about 1/2 cup more milk... I recommend this cake with "French Buttercream Frosting". And a fruit filling.

I followed the instructions as written, except I used regular white flour and not cake flour.  My cake sank in the middle big time! Maybe I beat the batter too much.

Even though I made a few changes, and strayed from the listed directions, I will keep this as my standard white cake recipe. It did what it needed to do, which was provide a base for a red, white and blue gel food coloring layer cake. I used salted peanut butter frosting, and the overall cake turned out delicious. The changes: 1) I only sifted my flour mix twice instead of three times because I'm lazy. I didn't have cake flour so I replace a few tablespoons of flour with cornstarch. Not sure if that's actually a legit substitution, but...  2)I used butter flavored shortening instead of butter in the batter, because I really wanted the cake to be white for color the R, W & B color scheme. 3) I realized after about 10 minutes of beating my egg whites that I haven't the foggiest how to make a merengue. I gave up and just folded in the frothy mix  into the batter (like others, I made the batter first, then mixed the egg whites and sugar last) 4) I'm usually not a fan of  very sweet desserts, so I used only about 3/4 cup sugar in the batter mixture (but the full 1/2 cup in the egg whites). I upped the liquid from 1 cup of milk to one 1 cup of milk plus another 3/4 cups of light cream. My cake was a bit dense, but I love dense cakes. Also, it wasn't overwhelming sweet, so it makes a good base for flavor-potent toppings/frosting. I don't think I would care for this if it were paired with a standard buttercream. The almond extract was interesting, but I wouldn't miss it--more an "add

This turned out ok. I probably won’t make it again. Maybe I did something wrong, the recipe is a little fussy for me but I was craving white cake. The top and sides got a little overdone and were too brown before the middle was done. It’s almost more of a soufflé than a cake

I use this recipe as the base for all of my cake recipes now. Although I’m using sifted all purpose flour vs cake flour it still comes out live and airy. You can adjust/ add flavor by replacing about 1/3 of the flour with any instant pudding mix. I’ve done butterscotch, pistachio, chocolate, banana cream, and cheesecake flavored JELLO instant puddings and had fab results. I uploaded a picture of this cake batter after dying it to make multi colored cupcakes and it still tasted phenomenal. I’ve also taught this recipe to 2 of my friends and hopefully they continue to use it as well!

I’ve never had a cake from scratch work out, but I’ve never done a white cake, ( or one with whipped egg whites) I decided to try this because I had some egg whites to use up and was needing a good basic cake, this was perfect, except I did add the extra 1/2 cup milk the others suggested, usually I don’t care for white cakes cause they’re to spongy and dry and eggy, but this was a perfect basic cake. I want to try it with buttermilk in place of milk. And for those who said it tastes like cornbread, all cakes from scratch do when they’re still hot, especially with freshly ground flour, but wait a day and they’re the best!

This cake is fairly simple to make which is a must for me when it comes to baking. The cake had great texture and was not dry at all. I thought the flavor was good as well. It was very sweet, kind of reminded me of a sugar cookie. I'm definitely more of chocolate girl so this may be the only reason I didn't give this cake 5 stars.

Made it for Christmas and did not last long.  Loved it and will definitely make again. Made a three layer cake and used a cream cheese whipped topping. Next time, I will try a fresh strawberry glaze between the layers with the frosting. And add some chopped walnuts to the batter.

I made this for my daughter’s 3rd birthday party and it turned out great. I am recently gluten free and have a few family members who are also, so I substituted the flour for Bob’s Red Mill gluten free all purpose flour and I added 2 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. Gluten free baked goods require extra moisture so I added an additional egg and a total of 2 1/2 cups of milk (I used unsweetened almond milk). I added the milk a half cup at a time until the batter reached a good consistency. I made a cute bunny shaped cake and had batter left over so I used my silicon woodland animal molds to  extra mini cakes. They all turned out fantastic. The flavor was wonderful and the cake was moist. The texture was slightly chewy/springy but not in a bad way. Overall I am thrilled with how this cake turned out and all the party guests loved it too.

My son is strictly advised by his nephrologist to avoid egg yolks hence I was looking for an egg whites only recipe. I baked it in a microwave convection oven at 160 degree C for 40 mins & it came out absolutely fantastic....'Heavenly'.  Reduced all the quantities to half except milk. I added roughly 4 tbs of milk over the halved quantity. Also added some flour coated raisins to the batter. Never ever had a cake so moist, so light & so spongy. My wife & son loved it. Thanks a lot.

I used 1.5 c milk as recommended and it was perfect. ALSO, I made it using 1/2 c milk and 1 c strawberry daiquiri mix  and it made a delicious strawberry cake! I made my own cake flour by removing 2.5 Tbl flour and replacing it with 2.5 T cornstarch, sift all dry ingredients 3x, then continuing on as written.

This cake was so good, the best white cake recipe I have ever made. I did read the reviews and follow a few of the suggestions. I made sure to sift the cake flour once by itself and then 3 times with the salt and baking powder.  I also gently folded in the beaten egg whites. I added a bottle of colored sprinkles to make a funfetti cake. It was a big hit with everyone. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I took the changes others noted and retyped recipes 
Remember to sift flour before measuring and sift 3 more times after you add salt and baking powder.      

Changed amount of Milk = 1 1/2 cups.      
And I didn’t make meringue until after batter was completed then fold in.        I used cake bowel pan making individual cakes then filled with peaches and whip cream

I will make it again and it is now my go to white cake recipe! I added 0.5 cup extra milk, only 3 tsp baking powder, and 2 tsp vanilla but no almond extract. I also folded in the egg whites once between, which made for a lighter fluffier batter.

I made the cake and added the extra milk suggested by everyone. I don’t have a stand or kitchen aid mixer. I could not get my egg whites to form peaks. I used vanilla instead of almond. The batter tasted amazing and resembled cool whip. I frosted it with a basic vanilla buttercream recipe. The cake was extremely light and fluffy and the edges were very good. I did have a difficult time icing it since it was so soft it was tearing. I had to keep smoothing and throw edible gold glitter to hide the crumbs. I will try again once I get a mixer which whip attachment. Overall it was good!

This cake had a great flavor. I didn't have any almond extract so I added three teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of one. It was a little on the dry side but I may have cooked it a little longer than I needed to. Thank you for the recipe.

This is probably the worst white cake we’ve ever made. It’s DRY, like crumbly dry. I followed the recipe exactly. Baked it 30-33 min.  I let it cool completely and am so disappointed that I have to bring this to a 4th of July party. Embarsssing to say the least

DELICIOUS is the best way to describe this recipe. SUPER-EASY is the next best way to describe this recipe! The only modification I made was add 1/4 cup more milk, only because it seemed a bit thick-and I’m guessing that’s because of the amount of butter (not the normal 2 sticks)); and I folded my egg whites in at the very last. The cake is light, mellow and delicious!

This is an excellent recipe. I substituted 1 tsp lemon extract in place of the almond extract due to allergies. I also added an extra 1/2 cup milk as other reviewers had suggested. I baked it in two 9” pans for 28 minutes, but it probably would have been fine at 26 or 27minutes. The cake was perfect. It truly tasted like a bakery cake and wasn’t overly sweet. I cannot wait to bake it again.

I made no changes, and the texture and taste were fabulous. One reviewer suggested we fold the egg whites in, so as not to lose the volume, but I think the sugar stabilizes them quite a bit, so I just used my electric mixer, and the cakes turned out great! A lemon curd to spread between layers would be great to make with all those egg yolks...

I wish the recipe stated what to do with ingredients better, I had to read further into the recipe about how to add the ingredients together instead of telling me earlier to set things aside. Almost messed up the cake.

Made this recipe as is and it was excellent!  What was the BIGGEST help was the video demonstrating the mixing method. I'm a seasoned cook and probably should have known about this method but there it is...well worth watching!

Come to think about it I wish Americans would use weights instead of volumes. It's so much more precise.

This is the best cake I have EVER made. I usually just make a mix cuz they're easy and super moist unlike most homemade cakes, but decided to try this one. It tasted WAY better but it had the PERFECT texture. Will definently keep this one.

No changes and I followed the suggestions by another viewer to make sure to sift and then measure the cake flour and then resift. So, I didn't add more milk.  it is light and spongy and delicious.  I love almond flavor so next time I'll add a little more almond but that's about it.

I just finished frosting this cake and sat down to taste it. It’s amazing! It’s moist, it’s light, and it’s spongy. The smell is divine as well. I give it 5 stars. I followed this recipe exactly as written. Before making it, I read several reviews suggesting an extra half cup of milk. If you make this cake as it’s intended to be made, the extra half cup is not needed. Butter cakes take a little know how to make and here are a few tips. Make sure your cold ingredients have warmed to room temperate. Do not soften butter in the microwave as this method tends to make the butter too soft. Separate the egg whites from the yolk while cold and set the whites aside to warm to room temp. Make sure no fat or yolk gets in the whites. While the ingredients are warming to room temp, measure out your cake flour into a sifter. Sift out the 2 3/4 cup of flour. If you scoop out the flour using a measuring cup, you will come out with a dry cake. Once you have your flour sifted out in the appropriate measurement, add the rest of the ingredients as instructed and be sure to sift it all together 3 times as recipe states. While whipping the butter and sugar, be sure to whip long enough so the sugar dissolves into the butter and it becomes fluffy. Around 5 minutes. If yuh follow these tips you should have a great cake!

I really, really liked this cake but as the recipe stands it needs some improvement. I increased the milk by a half cup and decreased the amount of almond extract -- it was still too strong, next time I am going to only add 1/4 teaspoon almond.

That being said, this cake is definitely worth making.-- it's my favorite white cake so far, even if it does need some tweaking.

I made this cake and doubled the mix since i wanted more layers. It ended up making 4 8" rounds. Like many suggested, I added more liquid but only half not double.  That seemed to work out well and this unicorn cake was moist and a huge hit. I used a chocolate buttercream as filling and it offset the sweetness of the vanilla.  also left out almond and doubled vanilla like others.

I follow this recipes as shown, maybe add a tad more milk than what the recipe says. It's a family favorite, it's very soft and moist and nice flavor. I also do the creaming method and alternate the flour and milk and fold in the whites. I love this cake.

If you're using whole milk and planning to do a layer cake, do not add the extra 1/2 cup as suggested below or else the cake will be too moist from the added fat (the butter is plenty by itself) It will be delicious (and work well for cupcakes) however, just a bit too delicate once you trim the sides. If you're using skim or another type else, go ahead.

Definitely sift the flour before measuring, and sift it again multiple times. When you are adding the ingredients together as specified, don't overmix but do allow them to mix properly before adding more dry or liquid...when you are done it will be a light, fluffy batter that you then fold the meringue into. The batter never seemed that thin to me so I can't help but wonder what went wrong for people.  I suspect that all of the issues with dryness or heaviness have to do with over or under mixing, including the meringue...for instance if you overbeat the whites into firm peaks you will get a cake that has an odd texture and rises erratically.
I just made 6 of these and they all turned out quite well with a good texture and flavor. Don't lose hope from the bad ratings, it's a pretty good cake and got rave reviews from everyone.

This is a good cake. I made it exactly as described. I have made this three times now, and have learned that the results are better if I am sure to thoroughly combine the whipped eggs at the end instead of gently folding it in like I might do with a traditional 1-2-3-4 or similar cake.

This cake came out just as moist as a boxed cake! I would consider myself an amateur baker when it comes to cakes from scratch and this cake still came out moist and fluffy! I followed the suggestions from other viewers and directions exactly. I sifted the cake flour before measuring it, beat egg whites separately after everything else was mixed together and gently folded the egg whites into the batter at the end. You can tell how fluffy this cake will be by the way the batter looks.

I've read quite a few reviews and have added the 1 1/2 cups of skim milk instead of the 1 cup, and DID sift the dry ingredients. I have to say that this part takes the most time but seems to be worth it! I went all out and made the recipe 3 times in 2 days! This is for my son's birthday party and so far they loved the cupcakes! I'm sure the 4 tier cake will be another success!

Made all the recommended changes suggested in comments including adding half a cup of 2% milk, plus I folded my egg whites in and sifted all dry ingredients 5 times......... it was still too heavy. It's not horrible but just not heavenly. I think the trick may be in barely mixing (I guess). I consider myself a pretty good baker and this recipe is overrated. I really want to give it 3 stars but some people will find this dense cake acceptable, not me.

This was by far the worst cake I have ever made. It went directly in the trash. Shame on all you people who make changes and then review it as good or bad. Review the recipe as is, or you have defeated the whole purpose of the review process. I suppose shame on me for not reading all the reviews and noting all the changes people made because it was so dry. This was absolutely inedible as is.

It was some work. As others suggested I added an additional 1/2 cup of milk. Before I added the extra milk it was like cookie dough. Didn't have almond extract so I doubled vanilla. Folded in egg whites. It is good.   My kitchen is a wreck now lol.

Great! Just tasted too sweet because of the frosting I put, but overall this is a delicious and quite easy recipe. I made a mini version of this and basically estimated the amount of ingredients I needed, and it worked out very well! I topped it with some colorful sprinkles as well :)

Definitely not the most impressive cake . It's very lumpy, and in the 3 times I've made it, it had strange sour parts in the cake. ( I checked all the expiration dates to all my ingredients every time-nothing had gone bad!!!)  I've spent so much time looking for the perfect white cake recipe, and this is just not it. :( Also I suggest filling the cupcake liners only 1/2 way full when you make cupcakes, because this cake rises very high.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars, but the cake was 5 stars! Reason being, I made alterations to the recipe. I took the advice from other reviewers and used 1 1/2 cups of milk and made the meringue last. Also, I made buttermilk (1 1/2 cups of whole milk and 5 teaspoons of vinegar) and let it sit for 20 minutes. I used the homemade buttermilk in the recipe instead of regular milk. 

I baked the cake for 40 minutes because 30-35 wasn't enough, and the cake came out perfectly! It was extremely moist and fluffy! I baked it in two 9inch round cake pans and topped it off with a cream cheese buttercream frosting and covered the cake with coconut flakes. Everyone loved it and is requesting that I make it again.

Light and fluffy and delicious.  I changed the milk to 1 1/2 cups per everyone else's instructions and only used vanilla as I didn't have any almond extract.  We made cupcakes and they came out perfectly!  For the record, we baked them for about 21 minutes and that was just long enough.

I am a novice baker but I did my best to follow the instructions. I added an extra 1/2 cup a milk per other reviews.  The cake was not like a traditional birthday or wedding cake and not at all like a bakery cake. It was like a sponge cake. I wanted to love it but I didn't.

I made this for my Grandma's birthday and the best reaction was it was okay. I hated it. The almond extract made it taste awful and it was really dense. The recipe said it would be light and fluffy and it was not. That may be because the meringue didn't turn out properly I don't know, but I probably will never make it again.

Update: this recipe continues to be a family favourite for birthday cakes. Make sure you fold in the meringue and don’t overmix it. This is what keeps the cake light. Sift the cake flour before measuring!

This is an elegant cake.
My partner loves vanilla cake with buttercream frosting. This cake was luscious and perfect. We were both really impressed. Such a tender crumb.

I made the cake with the following modifications:
-Beat the egg whites separately into a nice soft peak and set them aside. I folded them in gently at the very end.
-I did not use almond extract- only plenty of good vanilla.
-I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk.

I used wax paper on the bottom of my pans. They released easily. Make sure you do not grease the pans!

CAKE REMOVAL TRICK:
Place your cake tins hot out of the oven onto wet dishtowels. The cakes will pop right out.  

This is a beautiful recipe. We filled with dulce de leche and it was glorious. Thanks!

Tastes really good but I suggest you make the sugar 11/4 cup if you don't want it very sweety and increase the milk a bit as well.

Made this cake for the first time today. I was nervous because it seemed like I might screw it up... I was making this as the base white cake for a Tiramisu cake from same site and it was a bday cake for my son.  It turned out amazing! Again, the mix was doctored a bit further since I incorporated this into another recipe, but still. It was truly wonderful and I'd make it again just to have plain. 

First, I made sure to follow the recipe's instructions of sifting the cake flour before measuring and also sifting the dry ingredients together three times. Next, I took the advice of previous reviewers and increased the milk by an additional 1/2 cup for one recipe. Lastly, I completed step #2 (making the meringue mixture) after mixing the rest of the batter, per the recommendations of other reviews. I took my time, and the results were fantastic. This cake mix worked perfectly for my other recipe... the cake was dense, but not too heavy, wonderfully moist and flavorful. 

More labor intensive than a box cake for sure, but delicious!

This recipe made 30 perfectly delicious cupcakes! I had to make my own cake flour with cornstarch, but followed the recipe exactly as written.  For anyone wondering, this makes a flat (no dome) cupcake that comes out perfectly even with the cupcake paper liner.  I used a small ice cream/cookie dough scooper (approx 1/8 cup) per cupcake and it made a total of 30 moist and delicious little cakes!  I will keep this recipe  to enjoy for years to come, thank you for sharing Carol!

DON'T TRY CUPCAKES WITH THIS RECIPE! :) The cake is moist, fluffy, and delicious (I used 1.5 cups milk and made the meringue at the very end before folding it in). I knew this was meant to be a sheet cake, but hubby wanted cupcakes. Alas, they came out flat as a board (and I can only imagine would have made a beautifully leveled sheet cake). I'll follow the recommended baking methods next time!

I am so over this recipe... one of the best flavored traditional cakes you can bake, but it is beyond finicky! For every 1 decent cake I bake, at least 8 rise beautifully only to end up flat dense brownies as it cools. I've changed butter and virtually every ingredient repeatedly and cannot pin point any consistent explanation for the problem. As someone who bakes and cooks very regularly completely from scratch I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone at this point. No one has this much time or quality ingredients to waste!

I was disappointed. Making this cake was quite complicated (requiring 5 bowls to mix) and mine didn't raise very well. I recommend a layer cake because my cupcakes were flat. The texture and taste are very similar to angel food cake. I didn't see the recommendation to add the extra milk, but I do agree it needs more milk.  Not exactly what I was going for but I guess they will do.

After reading the reviews, I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk, and the cake was perfect.  Light and airy, so much better than anything from a box or bakery.  I've made the cake twice, for two different birthdays, and everyone loved it.  One as a sheet cake, and one as a layer cake.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

The one thing I've learned from failing over and over again at making a simple white cake - is that cake baking is so scientific. And this one works!!! So you just have to follow directions EXACTLY.  Mine was delicious and beautiful - just like wedding cake!  I love love love it!

This is an excellent recipe, and I make it totally vegan!! I substitute almond milk (milk), earth balance butter (butter), vegan approved sugar, and Aquafina (eggs). I follow the direction exactly as the recipe called for. It's wonderful! Perfect every time!

My cake looked nothing like the other pics and the taste & density was nothing like described. I must have done something wrong :( it tasted like a cross between cornbread & pancakes and was very firm and dense no where near light & fluffy. I am very disappointed. I had a hard time getting the egg whites to fluff and sort of gave up so I'm sure that's why. I really was looking forward to finding a from scratch white cake recipe I can rely on, but this one won't work for me.

This has become my go to white cake recipe over the past couple years.  I see a lot of criticism that it's too heavy, but I myself enjoy a good dense cake.  I have made it many times as written and I have also added some of my own flair on occasion.  I once forgot the extracts towards the end, but it still tasted good and actually worked out well with the type of frosting I decided to use.  I've also used approximately 2mL of Amaretto candy flavoring in this cake and it was amazing.  It also carries other extracts extremely well, especially citrus.  It also makes for lovely cupcakes but it does have some rise to it so I would recommend filling the cups 1/2 full instead of the standard 3/4 full.

Delicious! I halved the recipe, included the increase in milk, made the meringue after the butter mixture, and made 12 medium sized cupcakes. They were really moist and had nice flavour without any extract.  I would like to give 4 1/2 stars actually because they stuck to the silicone cups and were slightly “gluey” so they tore and lost their shape. Perhaps I should have greased the cups, but I never do and other things come out nicely. I will use this recipe again for sure !

So moist, light and.... well heavenly.  This recipe is a keeper!  I've made this replacing the vanilla extract with coconut and the milk with unsweetened coconut milk.

I made this Recipe and i added the extra milk and some more water because it was still too dense for what i was using it for, Once i got it to the right consistency i wanted I put it in the oven and when the cake had come out, it tasted like pancakes. I did not like this recipe at all.

I love this recipe! First of all, use quality ingredients- Swan's Down cake flour, Domino or Dixie Crystals sugar, real vanilla, etc. You cannot bake anything well with sub-par ingredients. I beat the egg whites in a non-metal bowl until soft peaks formed, then gradually added the sugar.  I folded the meringue into the batter.  I also folded 1 cup of crushed Oreos into the mixture and baked it in two 9-inch square pans. I frosted it with a white frosting and sprinkled crushed Oreos on the top and placed Oreo halves around the bottom edge.

This might be the best cake I've ever made! I forgot to add the extra 1/2 cup of milk which I will do the next time and because I use almond baking emulsion, 1 tsp was a little much but those are both on me so no stars taken away. I made this as 2-nine inch cakes but omitted frosting and took one of the layers to my parents. It was evening snack time when I got there so they cut into immediately and each had more than one piece because they thought it was so yummy. While the steps are significant, they are critical and well worth the effort. I highly recommend this recipe and will use it from now on when I am asked for white cupcakes (my side job).

MMMMMM. I've made this recipe lots of times, yum yum YUM! I don't have almond extract, but it still works out fine, with marshmallow frosting or buttercream frosting or whatever. It is the answer to my endless cake recipe search.

Oh my! Fantastic cake! The element in my oven went out, so it baked at about 300 degrees. It was the best mistake ever! The cake was so moist, it was better than the bakery cake downtown! I purposely put the temp down to 300 the next few times I made this cake. Still fantastic. I made the cake once at the regular temp and it wasn't moist at all. Bake it at a lower temp for longer time. That's how you do it :)

No more using white cake mix out of the box.  This was a little labor intensive for me since I have never have beaten egg whites before.  Only changes I made is that I used organic cake flour, milk, and eggs.  I did an a little extra milk after reading the others comments. I used two round baking pans.  It came out perfect!

My girl and myself measured everything perfect!  But, instead using a mixer like used in this recipe, we used a new food processor from kitchen-aid. There is only 2 speed options, so I started in LOW but then I just switched to HI, and it was very fast, it could be that? Perhaps, this is my second try recipe but the cake is hard, like uncooked in the middle and kind of greasy... I used a unbleached flour, I do not what it was wrong...any guess?  Tks!

Used 1 1/2 cups of milk like most people suggested as well as only using vanilla extract. Flavor turned out great. Cake is definitely more on the DENSE side rather than fluffy and airy...even after sifting all dry ingredients three times. Easy to frost!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it comes out perfect every time! So light and moist! I did not feel the need to add extra milk and wonder if others are measuring the flour then sifting it when you need to sift the flour into the measuring cup then sift all the dry ingredients (I actually just use a whisk, much easier and yields same results). I also gently folded in the egg whites, as you should with anything whipped. Topped with the special buttercream recipe for my daughters first birthday and was a huge hit!

This cake tasted like it was made at a grocery store. I think it may be the almond extract that gave the cake a slightly unnatural flavor.  If you enjoy almond flavor, and a drier texture to your cakes, this is fine.

This is an amazing recipe!! Like other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups of milk and made the meringue right before folding it in. I did not have cake flour, so I subtracted 2 tbsp of flour per cup (but I still sifted it before measuring and then three times more with the other dry ingredients); I also 1.5x the recipe, which made an 8 in round, a mini loaf pan, and a 10'' x 2'' round (don't ask, it was for a french project). Additionally, I really wanted to try to make rainbow cake (first time!) and this worked beautifully! I divided the batter to make orange, red, green, blue, purple, and yellow, then dropped globs of batter into the pan. Next, I used a toothpick to swirl the colors together, which made a nice marbled effect. I baked the cakes at 325 and just eyeballed the time (I always bake at this temp because my cakes cook more evenly this way). The color was great, and after cooling, I wrapped them in plastic wrap to keep them moist. Thank you so much, Carol! (P.S. I'll add a photo once I finish decorating!)

I baked this cake for Easter and I used coconut milk in place of regular milk! I didn't use the almond extract because I was using the cake in place of a recipe that called for a box white cake mix. I read the reviews about adding extra milk, but I didn't because I poked holes in the three separate layers and I poured a coconut cream/sweetened condensed milk mixture over the cake to be absorbed over 8 hours. My daughter-in-law said this was the best cake I've made.

I forgot to adjust the milk to the suggested amount of 1 1/2 cup and the cake was dry. It had flavor and it looked delicious, but it was too dry for my liking. Luckily, my homemade lemon butter cream icing saved the day. I am going to give this recipe one more chance and this time use 1 1/2 c of milk. I am also going to use 5 regular egg whites or 4 xl egg whites. Stay tuned....

This is simply amazing. I agree with the rest is, save the first step for last. And I have always learned using buttermilk  instead of any other milk is the way to go. I use it even in my chocolate cake mix. No, need for the extra milk. Also, if you choose to make cupcakes don't fill them more than halfway. Thank you Ms. Carol...:))

I used a raspberry sauce filling which addded some moisture to the finished cake.  A white chocolate ganache icing was topped with whole raspberries for decoration.

This cake is wonderfully vanilla flavored and light as a feather. I made it and froze it for a week and it was still fantastic! Great scratch white cake recipe.

I've gotten about 2 dozen cupcakes out of one recipe as written; they're dense, but not too much so, they're fluffy, the texture is perfect. I actually forgot to add vanilla to my first batch (left out the almond as a matter of personal preference), and I could still happily eat them with no frosting; of course, the flavor was a bit flat with no extracts, but the texture is just that good. I did not add the extra milk that many others did, and so far no dryness problems, but I do make sure to use whole milk and real, quality butter (I love Kerry Gold) when I bake. It's not exactly health-conscious, but full fat = fuller flavor and smoother texture. Also, I whipped the egg whites just before adding them to the batter, and folded them in instead of beating.

It was a very nice texture... If you do what most of the other reviews say, which is to add 1/2 cup of milk in addition to the original 1 cup. Also always fold in your whipped egg whites, because mixing them in with your mixer decreases the air- which is the whole purpose of whipping them.

Moist delicious quick and easy. I made it for thanksgiving for my family and it might not make it till tomorrow.
I added m&ms to it to make fun and festive. I also added nutmeg instead of almond extract.

UPDATE: Since Thanksgiving I've tried this recipe a few more times, tonight I made 4 cakes 2 for my school in celebration of finals being over and 2 for my niece and nephews to enjoy at home. I still love this recipe!! I tried a few others and didn't like them as much, this time I added milk duds and m&ms into one of the cakes and used buttercream frosting YUM!

I have made this cake many times and definitely need to add the 1/2 cup of extra milk otherwise the cake is too dry. I also have attempted to use this cake and make a chocolate chip cake however due to the lateness of the cake and the weight of the chocolate chips I have been unsuccessful. I have tried to wait between five and seven minutes and then add the chocolate chips but they still sink to the bottom. I have not attempted to use mini chocolate chips yet I think those may work better. Just food for thought.

I wish I had read the reviews before making the cake. It was a tad dry and dense. I should have added more milk. Did others sift the flour and then measure the it?

The cake was really good...I used another 1/2 cup of milk.This cake is perfect for those people who don't like chocolate cakes.And it's also great for layering...I would defenitely recommend this to others...this has now become my go-to white cake recipe:)

This was an easy delicious cake ,but I decided to make it a bit healthier, I cut the amount Crisco to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup and I used orange extract. My family loved the moistness and rich flavor!!

I made this for a friend for her birthday who loves white cake. It came out wonderfully. So moist and fluffy which is rare for a white cake. Made it as written with the exception of adding another 1/2 cup of milk. I'll look no further for a white cake recipe because you simply can't do better than this.

I love this recipe. I made my own version of it though to suit my own tastes. I am not a big fan of almond extract since it is so strong so i cut it to 1/4 tsp instead. I also used fresh ground soft white wheat. I also made some other small changes but it turned out fantastic.

After reading all of the reviews I was really torn on whether or not to add an additional cup of milk. I decided not to and the cake was fantastic. Perhaps it would have been even better with it, but I didn't want to risk it and was very pleased with the results. It's a great cake: good flavor, great texture. I love the combination of vanilla and almond. I made this into cupcakes and in each, put one medium cookie scoop's worth of batter plus one small scoop. It yielded 24 cupcakes, which I baked for 17 minutes. Thank you for the recipe, Carol!

Well, would not using cake flour make my cake a dull tasting disaster?Made this for a special birthday and was embarassed !! I cook and bake often but obviously not the kind of baking that I keep cake flour on hand. All ingrediants were fresh so that wasn't the problem.

I used the suggestion of adding extra milk but I added 1 1/4 c milk and 1/4 c sour cream. Since, I didn't have almond extract on hand I used double the vanilla. The batter was fluffy and not thin. They baked up light and fluffy with an amazing flavor.  I would use this recipe again.

I have baked cakes for 45 years and this is the best white cake I have ever made, by far. It was light and moist. I did follow suggestions and added 1/2 cup more milk when the batter seemed too thick to me. I frosted the cake with vanilla buttercream and received rave reviews from my family.

This turned out great - light and fluffy the way I like it. I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk as others suggested (don't see how it would have been the proper consistency otherwise) and used all vanilla and no almond since we love vanilla. I also added a tiny bit of cream of tartar when making the meringue. This will be my go-to white cake recipe from now on.

I love this cake recipe! I have tried it with n without the almond extract and it is delicious either way.  I used red and blue food coloring for 4th of July cupcakes and paired them with a cream cheese frosting . . . Divine!

Beautiful and delicious cake! It's really important to follow the instructions exactly by creaming the butter and sugar well. This cake has a light and moist texture and tasty, too. This one's a keeper.

Mine came out very dry but tasted wonderful!  I thought I should have added more milk when I was mixing the batter before I folded in the meringue and will add the additional 1/2 cup milk as suggested in the reviews (should have read those before starting). The texture was great and taste was AWESOME so I was close to getting that New Orleans Traditional White Almond wedding cake.

I made these into cupcakes and they turned out flat at the top. I tried it twice and I made sure that the baking powder wasn't expired. I don't know why they turned out flat (maybe the batter is too light and airy?) but that didn't stop us from eating them! They were so good and so tender! Will definitely make this again as a cake!

Loved this cake. I despise the chemical taste of boxed mixes and really prefer to make things from scratch. I used this cake for the base of the Coconut Poke Cake on this site.  I added the extra 1/2 cup of milk other reviewers suggested as swapped the almond extract for coconut extract. The cake came out wonderful! So light and moist!

Wonderful recipe -- I read the reviews and adjusted the amount of milk to 1 1/2 cups and also made sure to allow sufficient time for creaming the butter and sugar (about 8 minutes).  I think 1 1/4 cups might actually work for the milk and will probably give that a try next time I make it.
I used a buttercream frosting, but am thinking a lighter frosting (perhaps even freshly whipped cream) and berries would be really nice.
Overall, the cake was really light and moist.I was extremely pleased with the results.  Also, I had several people ask for the recipe.

This was a good cake.  I did make as written, adding strawberries at the end.  It did find that it was a thick batter - but it was not dense.  I would make this again.  It was not overly sweet, which was nice.

I received mixed reviews on this recipe. Some people loved it and said it was the best they ever had and the other half thought it was just 'good'. I think the meringue really brings out a sweet almond flavor. I just wish it was a little lighter but I may have over beat it. I was looking for a very light and simple white cake recipe, although this was good, it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

I made cupcakes which everyone loved!!!!! I added 1/2 cup of milk as suggested. I also substituted the teaspoon of almond extract for another teaspoon of vanilla, thereby using a total of 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. This recipe is a keeper!

I liked how this cake turned out. It didn't taste quite how I expected it to, but we all liked it. I used this frosting: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/white-frosting/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=white%20cake%20frosting&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe

This cake taste more like an angelfood cake to me. I'm not sure if "heavenly white cake" is supposed to taste more like an angelfood cake? The submitter does say it's an older one and maybe it's just not to my taste. Just not what i expected. it is VERY dense cake (think pound cake or angelfood)I did follow all instructions exactly, including sifting, and i did use a bit more milk. If your looking for a birthday cake light and fluffy cake, i would try something else.

I have no idea what I did wrong with this recipe. It mixed  up beautifully, baked beautifully and then flopped! I baked it in two 9" round pans and it was beautifully rounded on top when I took it out. I set it on racks to cool and it immediately sunk in the middle. When it was cool the middle was only about half an inch thick! I was so excited when I found this recipe! I don't know if the cake just fell, or if something else is wrong. It seems really heavy and greasy. It was a delicious taste, but I just can't do anything with it. I would try it again if somebody could tell me where I went wrong? I usually am a great baker and everything turns out, so this one is a mystery to me! Email me at: 1013918@gmail.com

I've now made this cake twice and it's just amazing.  I think the almond flavoring is what makes it amazing.  This is going in my  "go-to cake" collection.  Thanks for sharing it.  As a side note, it tastes great with an american buttercream flavored with almond rather than vanilla.  It just makes the cake all the better!

This recipe is by far the best I've tried when it comes to making homemade cakes. It's a great base cake for adding all kinds of different flavors. What I love about it the most is the texture and moistness. I'm sooo glad that I found it and I plan to use it from now when baking cakes.

Having never made a cake where egg whites needed to be whipped and folded in, I was apprehensive as to how this would turn out. I figured I could easily mess it up somehow lol. I made this as is except I held off on whipping the whites until the end and I baked it in a butterfly cake pan (daughter's bday)---> it was PERFECT!! Not grainy, dry, or dense but light, moist, and fluffy. It hit me as I folded in the the whites that I forgot the extra 1/2c of milk others advised. Didn't use it and we loved it, but I might just try it next time for fun to see if there is much of a difference.

Excellent!  This cake definitely lives up to its name . . . "heavenly."  I wanted a light, white cake that I could make for my mom's birthday, so I chose this one and layered it with pistachio pudding and frosted it with whipped cream.  Delicious!

I was very suprised that this turned out so good! The batter seemed really thick even when added extra milk and as it was baking, it smelt terrible. I was planning on trashing it. But when it came out and after cooling I thought i'd do a quick taste just to see where it went wrong...it tasted GREAT! It baked beautifully and was very moist! I added 3/4 cup extra milk and extra vanilla extract.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it just was not good. The cake tasted more like a bisquit and was not that flavorful. Not very forgiving and crumbled when I was working with it. Don't think I will try this one again.

I made this cake for my birthday, and I couldn't be more pleased. I had to use imitation flavorings, due to a corn allergy, and doubled the vanilla. I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting. I will definitely use this cake recipe again.

This was a very moist and tasty cake. It took a few wxtra steps to make but it was worth it. My husband and preschooler loved it.  The flavor reminded me of an angel food cake.
I made it exactly as written. For those using extra milk, you may want to sitf the flour and then measure. I will make again. But I mau make with something other then almond extract as i am not a huge fan of almond extract...Maybe rum?

I tried this recipe using the adjustments that other reviews posted to make a cake for my sons 10th birthday, I am very glad i tried cake before icing, as it was awful. The texture was great but the taste was very pasty.  Will not make again.

I have made this cake several times and passed out the recipe to others begging for it!! I took the advice from one reviewer about changing up the steps. I recommend doing step #3, then do step #2. Your whites won't have to sit waiting that way!! Lovely wonderful cake!! I had issues making cupcakes from this recipe, as they didn't rise to a nice round dome! but sure that was my fault! Enjoy!!

This was a good recipe. Really liked the flavor of it, although I was looking for a little more moisture in my cake. If a biscuit and a poundcake had a baby, that would be this cake.

new baker here....tried this cake tonight....1st time to ever make a cake from scratch.....kinda tedious recipe, took a while to make, but if the cupcakes turn out as good as the batter.....OMG!!! I'm in trouble! It's so good!!! I think I beat my egg whites too much though, & I used 1/2 more cup of milk like many people suggested. My batter seemed a little "grainy", but YUMMO!!!cupcakes LOOK good....I'll test 'em in a few (that is if I have enough room after licking the bowl!)

All the sifting was worth it! I loved this cake, it was moist and so yummy. I will use this recipe for all my white cakes. I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the almond and it was delicious. Thank you!

The flavor is amazing and it does come out very moist.. BUT even after cooling off it tends to break easy. I made this cake 4times today, thinking I had done something wrong but every time it still kept falling apart. I'm not sure what went wrong. I folded the whipped egg whites in at the very end added that extra milk as suggested... It reminds me more of a type pf angel food cake but with much better flavor than a cake that can be used for a birthday.

Good basic white cake. It turned out great, it was a little on the dry side but still tasted good. It just wasn't quite what I was looking for. Maybe next time I will add some lemon or something else for more flavor.

Best white cake recipe I have found. I also added a 1/2 cup of milk and made my meringue after all other ingredients were mixed. I only sifted dry ingredients twice opposed to the recommended 3 times...it was still super fluffy and light. It didn't rise as well as I had hoped, but believe my baking powder may have been a little outdated. All my reviews I received on this cake were on the lightness and fluffiness. Delicious! Definitely will be the recipe for my son's 3rd b-day.

Awesome recipe! I made this as a white cake a few months ago, and today instead of vanilla/almond extract, I used the zest off two lemons and two tsp of lemon extract, (my hubby like a LEMONY cake)  and it turned out really good.

I just made this cake and I followed the suggestions in the reviews.  I wasn't totally awful, but it wasn't anywhere near great.  It turned out really dense, almost to dense.  I don't think the almond extract helped the flavor of this cake either.  I wouldn't add it.  I might try making this cake again, but I will most certainly change somethings.

I was excited to try this recipe after reading all the great reviews.  My family found this cake very dry.  I didn't add the extra 1/2 cup milk like previous reviews stated.  I would definetly add the extra milk and also omit the almond extract if I would ever make this again.

I made this for my sister, who requested a white cake one night. While the crumb is lovely and light and moist, the flavour was completely overwhelmed by the almond extract. I should have realised it because almond extract is so strong. I'd use 1/2 or 1/4 of the amount next time.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was light, fluffy. Not dry at all.  I did not have any almond extract so I did use 2tsp of vanilla, but wished I had the almond extract (love the flavor). I will make this again soon so I can add the almond extract.

I really loved the flavor of this cake.  But I found that it was pretty crumbly - which makes it hard to remove from the pans and to frost. I did add the extra 1/2 cup milk recommended by others - which may have caused the problem.

Wonderful flavor, but not as moist as I had hoped it would be. I wish I would have read the reviews about adding an additional 1/2 cup of milk, I did add a couple of tablespoons of cream because the batter seemed too thick, but that obviously wasn't enough. It has wonderful flavor, but next time I will be adding more milk. I made 24 lemon filled cupcakes, and topped them with "Best Buttercream Frosting" from this site. Heavenly!

This is a very flavorful cake and goes well paired with a cream cheese frosting. However, perhaps I did something wrong because the cake was not moist at all. When I was mixing it I felt that it was to dry and almost kind of dough like. I agree with the other streviewers it could use an additional 1/2 cup of milk in the recipe. All in all not fabulous but still good.

I thought it tasted like something closer to cornbread, my family thought so too but it's more than likely that I did something wrong lol Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what happened, anyone else get the same outcome? If you did, maybe we made the same mistake, let me know. But either way, it was awesome cornbread! The buttercream icing I used totally made up for the cake not being so sweet.

This is the first time I've made a cake that was edible! I'm still learning baking cakes, and mine was just a little flat, although that's probably because I tried to beat the egg whites by hand, and then forgot to add the vanilla/almond extract until the batter was already in the pan ... but I'm counting this as a success anyway! Thanks :)

This was a very easy recipe and positively delicious, i followed the other reviewers advise and used 1 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1, I also added more vanilla and almond extract and filled my layers with a strawberry filling the end result was great...I definetely recommend this recipe to any first time bakers...thanks a lot for a terrific recipe

I am not a baker and have always been afraid of making a white cake.  The sifting, the meringue-ing, you know, scary to a non-baker.  I went for it and followed the compilation of suggested alterations from Laura Taft and it worked!  I really did it.  It was so fluffy and delicious.  My kids loved it and I didn’t have to feel the guilt that comes from feeding my family a box cake with preservative and weird chemicals.  My cake came out almost Angel-Food like.  I had a little trouble with the meringue being that it was my first time.  Maybe I shouldn’t have tried to fold them in and instead followed the original directions to beat thoroughly into batter.  In any case, this cake was indeed, heavenly.  My kids ate it with no frosting!

This is a wonderful basic recipe for a pure white cake that can be used for many desserts, but definitely the egg whites have to be folded in otherwise it is too heavy.  I think that most experienced bakers would have done this anyway. It is especially good put together with lemon curd, topped with 7 minute icing and sprinkled with toasted coconut.

This cake tasted DELICIOUS.  I wanted to make it into a layer cake, but found it to be very dense, and because of the humidity the layers were sliding all over each other.  I used the extra batter to make cupcakes though and they were inhaled.  I will definitely use this again.

When I make it into cupcakes they turn out more like muffins.  Actually, once I brought them to a cook-out and I used half- whole wheat-half-all purpose flour and someone ate one and said,"This is really good cornbread!"  I love them and make them often.

Very good! I added little pieces of real strawberry for some extra flavour, and it ended up tasting like poptarts (in a good way). Very moist, but a little dense. That could have been the strawberries though.

Thank you so much for making this a success!

Today is my boyfriend's 26th birthday. I have had so much fun getting his cake together. I used two recipes Heavenly Chocolate Mousse, and Heavenly White Cake. He's mixed race and all his friends call him Panda bear. So, I made a black and white cake. I used the mousse as the filling. My only change was instead of water I used McDonalds hazelnut chilled coffee... and in the cake I used extra almond extract. I've never made a cake from stratch before, and I am so pleased. Also, yesterday as kind of a date I added food colouring to pieces of marzipan... and made little pandas. I told him whoever's were better in the end could go on his cake. It's beautiful thank you! I'm sure his friend's will love it!

A good cake, but not as dense as I wanted.  It tasted almost exactly like angel food cake, and I wanted more of a pound cake.

I tried this cake 2 times all with the same results.  The flavor was good, but the texture was very dry.  Try soaking the layers with Simple Syrup before you fill/frost.

I followed the suggestions below regarding increasing the milk.  I did make the meringue first and as long as you measure your ingredients first and and shift everything before you make the meringue it's fine.  This cake is tender, most and a bit dense.  Really yummy, I made two layers using making the recipe twice as I was feeding a good sized group.  I made my own mocha butter cream frosting because this cake was for my son and that's what he wanted.  The cake got rave reviews.

It is a great recipe.  I used the cake flour and did not find that I needed any extra milk for the batter.  But I also did not really like the texture, perhaps because I don't usually use cake flour.  My friends liked the cake and thought it was fine, but the next time I try the recipe I will try all-purpose flour and see what the difference is.  I did definitely like this as a good white cake recipe.

This is a good cake!  And I don't even care for white cakes.
I don't know what happened here, but I sure ended up with a LOT of batter, like 7 cups worth, which is not a bad thing at all.  Cake turned out lovely white, moist...and that taste is divine.
I didn't find it heavy, it baked nice and evenly, raised perfectly...didn't need my Bake Right strips, either.
This one is most assuredly a keeper!

Like several others on here have said, I followed this recipe exactly, even sifting the correct number of times, but the result was not entirely spectacular.  The flavour was actually sensational, but it was a very dense cake - hardly rose at all.  Normally my baking endeavours are a real success, so I'm not sure what went wrong this time.

Oh I am so dissapointed. I did everything as listed on the recipe. Even sifted all the correct amount of times. The only consulation on this is we can eat it for scrap cake prior to the event of which I was baking the cake for.  Too bad becuse it had high revues. Very disapointing.

I have been searching and searching for the perfect white cake, like the one I had made for my wedding, so I figured I would try this one. It was good,and incredibly easy, but almost has more of a pound cake feel to it, but not so dense. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor. It is great for strawberry shortcake, but I wouldn't say that it was Heavenly in the cake sense. I would make it again, but I would use it for strawberry shortcake...

FABULOUS!  I am a novice baker, and this was really my first attempt at a cake.  I made followed the directions exactly (With suggested substitutes, THANKS!) and it was WONDERFUL.  I made a flag cake in a sheet pan, with whipped cream (Off this website) for icing, and everyone raved.  Thank you for making me look GOOD!  :)

PS, I attempted to cut the recipe in half to make 12 cupcakes...not *as* great, a little crumbly.  I solved that by cutting it in half and making little layered shortcakes with the whipped cream and berries.  Everyone still raved.  :)

I will never buy another box mix! Wonderful, moist, great without frosting! It smelled so good while baking, my family had it gone before I had the chance!
It does take more time, but well worth it! I had no problem following the directions, as some people have confessed to.
I did change a few things as suggested.
I used about 1/4 cup more milk (evaporated/water mix), and 1/2 cup of shortening in place of 1/2 cup of the butter. Even with these small changes, it still gets ***** from me!

This is an excellent 'not too sweet' cake that was a hit at my birthday party. Caution should be exercised so as not to overcook as it gets a little dry... it may just be my defective oven but the top did not brown so we left for an extra 4 mins and it came out a bit on the dry side.

I did not care for this. I want a recipe I can print out and follow.  Maybe it does work with all the other suggestions.  I love to try new recipes but will keep looking for a 'white cake' recipe. Two thumbs down on this.

OK well  this wasn't a horrible cake.  But it wasnt an amazing one.  Our cake smelt great and tasted good too.  But it did not rise and it took us 3x the amount given in the recipie to make one full sized cake.  I was not happy.  But note to all you future bakers of this recipie>>>>>>>BEAT THE EGGS WELL!

Added the extra 1/2 cup of milk as other reviwers suggested and it was still a bit too dry.

I made this cake into cupcakes and changed the recipe alittle as suggested.  I put in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla and one teaspoon of almond extract, and I also did not separate my eggs well enough so the egg and sugar mixture got foamy but did not have "soft peaks".  Also I did not put any icing or frosting on the cupcakes.  The recipe turned out great and everyone loved it, but it just needed minor changes.

I was a little dissapointed with this cake. It tasted pretty good but I was not happy with the texture. It was very much like spounge cake to me, not very moist and that was with 2 Tbsp. of oil that I added. It tasted good with buttercream icing but it was not what I was looking for.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I finally found a perfect white cake recipe. This was light and spongy and dense but not heavy and had the perfect sweetness. This will be made many many times! Thanks for the recipe!
