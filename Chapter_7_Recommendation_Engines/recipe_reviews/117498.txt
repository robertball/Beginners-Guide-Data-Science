This was one tasty burger.  I added a small amount of breadcrumbs because the mixture was way too wet and I was afraid the burgers wouldn't hold together.  Cooked in a cast iron skillet until browned on one side, flipped over and finished in a preheated 425 degree oven for about 8 minutes, pulled out (had to poke it to let out some of the juice as it had bubbled) topped with provolone cheese and threw it back in until the cheese had melted. Oh so juicy.  Will absolutely make this again.

Don loves these burgers. He calls them meat loaf burgers, and always requests them.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I left the onions out because I'm not a fan of them. Well, I actually forgot to add them, but there was no remorse because of it. I read previous reviews that said the garlic was too strong, but I didn't feel that it was overpowering whatsoever. I'm going to recommend this recipe to all my friends.

these burgers came out very well. My bf and his family enjoyed them. i think perhaps adding mushrooms with swiss cheese would make a fine variation on this recipe, but was good as is. Thanks!

These were okay but the smoked provolone cheese I used just didn't seem to compliment this. I baked mine in the oven along with another dish. The flavor of the meat was okay but not anything impressive. Thanks this was a decent burger.

This is a good recipe, but I found using the chopped onion/garlic really overpowered the flavor of the meat for my taste. Next time, I will use garlic/onion powder instead. Also, I did not have an egg, so I just omitted it and the burgers were still fine. But overall, very simple to make, easy to modify to your liking... works for me.

Used ground turkey, egg whites, and sweet onion buns. Added a little extra garlic, and followed a reviewers suggestion and added breadcrumbs (Italian-style). Was really good! Will make them again.
