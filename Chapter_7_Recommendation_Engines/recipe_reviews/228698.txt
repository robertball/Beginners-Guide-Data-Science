This was so good I have to remake it to take a picture. I told my Hubby to leave the pasta and 1 piece of chicken for a picture. He ate it all. I slammed cupboard doors and yelled at him for 5 minutes and all he said was it was worth it. It was that good.

This was really tasty. I pleasantly surprised.  Only thing I did differently was serve the sauce on the side - I wanted the browned chicken to stay a little crispy

I must admit that we love everything piccata!  This was really tasty, especially since it took only about 25 minutes to get it to photo ready!  That's because I had everything at hand.  I seasoned the floured chicken with Papa's Seasoning Salt from this site (my new pantry staple), and I added maybe just a little more lemon juice and capers than called for.  I used a Costco boneless skinless chicken breast packet, and I cut the chicken horizontally to make it thin.  I do think many people overcook their chicken when they stovetop it--it really only takes about 10 minutes at the most when you cook it in a combo of butter and olive oil.  With some Trader Joe's capellini, this makes a wonderful meal!  Thanks, Progresso!

Did not find this to be very flavorful as written.  Sauce needed to be thickened.

Hubby and I thought it was ok....kiddos didnt like it at all.. lacking flavor big time and thats after I felt like I amped it up. I used a whole jar of capers, half a squeezed lemon, doubled the sauce which was way too thin, so I thickened the sauce with a lil cornstarch and water so it wasnt soup consistency. Served over whole grain linguine. Just lacked major flavor. This is my second time using these Starter sauces...and I dont think I will waste my money again. I do realize they are "starter sauces" ...but even though the recipes are quick and easy to get to the table, I ended up tossing food off of dinner plates last night....so sorry, but this was not for us.

With a bit more seasoning on the chicken (I used lemon pepper in addition to the salt and pepper) and more capers, we found this dish satisfying and pretty good. I served it over angel hair pasta and some garlic bread on the side.

Progresso keeps surprising me! I don't usually buy pre-made sauces, but decided to try this one because of the good reviews. I have to admit that the sauce on its own is not that impressive (I guess that's why it's called a "starter"), but once all the other ingredients are mixed in...BAM!  I didn't have to add any additional seasonings.  I served this over buttered garlic noodles.  I only had three chicken breasts, so tomorrow for lunch hubby and I get to fight over who gets the leftover. :)

I thought the flavor of this was pretty good. I made sure my sauce thickened up and my chicken was nicely browned before adding the sauce.

We loved it and will make it again.  I used the Progresso Creamy Parmesan Basil.  I added a little garlic while chicken was browning and followed rest of the recipe as written.  After reading the reviews, I was concerned it was going to be too runny but that did not happen to me at all.  I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water and added a half a box of cooked Fettuccini and the consistency was perfect. - Marilyn

Super quick and easy to make.  I'm not a HUGE fan, but for a canned product,  I can see it appealing to someone that needs to get dinner on the table quickly.  I did ask more lemon juice than the recipe called for and some fresh Italian herbs.  I served this with Trader Joe's spinach linguine.

This was ok. Pretty bland to start but for being so easy to throw together it wasnt bad. I made changes to help amp it up. I added Italian seasoning to the flour mixture. Then I browned the chicken pieces- set aside, and saut√©ed onion and garlic in the pan. Then I added the progresso along with a lot of extra lemon. I added the chicken back to the mixture with capers and artichokes. I also added a little artichoke liquid to the pan. It turned out pretty tasty after those modifications.

This was a hit at my house with variations. I did not have the Progresso stuff so I improvised using 2 cans of cream of chicken soup to which I added a teaspoon of garlic powder, a half cup of sour cream, a can (drained) of sliced mushrooms, and about 1 cup of dry white wine along with the lemon juice, parsley, and capers. I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the dredging flour and cooked the chicken in olive oil. We ate it with corkscrew multi-color pasta and it was delicious. Steamed veggies on the side also tasted great with a little of the sauce.

This was really good and so easy to make. My girls loved it with noodles and without the only thing they said it was a little to lemony for them so next time I'll use 2 instead of 3.

It was edible, but not great.  Didn't like the capers and the sauce wasn't great.

The lemon threw the taste off for me. Next time, I will just substitute the lemon with garlic or some other seasoning.

I am making this for a pot luck at Church tomorrow.  Had to substitute creamy garlic and mushroom from Campbell's Soup instead.  Also added peas.  Cannot find capers at my local grocery store.

I'd give it a 5 for easy, but it was only a 3 on taste. Not bad really, but there are many better recipes out there for chicken piccata. Hubby wants to add that there wasn't enough seasoning on the chicken itself.

One word for this meal: BLAND! I had high hopes because visually it appeared perfect. I was extremely disappointed after the first bite. I followed the directions word for word. The only flavor we could taste was lemon. The sauce had zero flavor and seemed to suck any other flavors from the dish. I even used a little extra capers but for some reason we couldn't taste them. I never, ever waste food but I couldn't finish my meal and when my husband asked if I wanted to save the leftovers I said no. I will not be using the Progresso Recipe Starters ever again. This tasted like something that you would buy in the freezer section of the grocery store.

Tried this the other night when there was no time to prepare anything else.  Sauce out of a can feels like cheating but this was flat out delicious.  Sauce was thick and great over the chicken and the pasta side.  Kids at it up.

I had no idea this was a rcipe when I made it.  We had chicken that had to be used (3 boneless breast & 8 boneless, skinless thighs). I found a can of the garlic sauce & a jar of chicken gravy in the pantry.  Mixed the 2 in a roasting pan, added chicken, parsley, some scallions & baked at 350 uncovered for 40 min. Served with mashed potatoes & green & yellow beans for color. The breasts were gone, thighs & extra sauce went into container in fridge.  2 days later mixed cut thighs with sauce & penne, served with honey glazed carrots. All gone & everyone loved it.

I made this with Perdue short cuts to save on time.  Obviously, didn't flour the chicken.  Added a bit more lemon juice than was called for and served over rice instead of pasta. Since I omitted the flour the sauce was a bit more watered down then I wanted but once it was poured over the rice it was fine.  Will definately make again.  This time I will dredge the chicken breasts in flour and follow the recipe more closely.  Overall the flavor was very good and super fast and easy to make.

This was okay for a week-night meal, but I don't know if I would serve it to guests.  It did come together fast, and my picky daughter liked it.  If I make it again, I will add mushrooms, and serve it with asparagus on the side.
