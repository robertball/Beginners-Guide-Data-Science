We all agreed this one has potential, but thought it needed to marinate in the balsamic / maple syrup and that the sauce should be doubled. I liked this for a quick and easy lunch and would definitely use it again, I'd just play with the spices and allow time for it to marinate next time.

A keeper with a little work.  I had two huge chicken breasts so I added some to this recipe - a little soy squce, hawaiian marinade,  spice brown mustard,  and honey to stretch it out and add more kick.  I also sliced up the chicken breasts in about 1 inch strips to cook them faster.I am not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar so I wanted to mellow that flavor out some.  It turned out great!  We served it with mashed potatoes amd vegetables,  but it would be great with rice or pasta too.  Especially if you stretch the sauce.

Amazing flavor !!! Cooked this about 5-7 minutes a side for halved chicken breasts. Next time would double the chipotle and garlic and reduce the sauce a little to thicken it. Most definitely a keeper! Even my 6 yr olds loved this.

This was lovely.  I'm gluten and dairy free and the chicken breasts turned out moist and delicious.  The marinade was rich and nicely balanced.  So easy to make.  I live in the mountains so perhaps that's why it took longer to cook to 165 degrees, but still came out so moist!  Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent and so quick! I didn't need the white pepper nor chipotle pepper.

So good. I made it with 2 chicken legs in my toaster oven at 350*F and it was done and delish in less then 20 min.
