This recipe was great just the way it was written and also is very good with other options added.  The second time I tried it with ham and green onion added to the eggs.  Both times I really enjoyed these breakfast burritos.  Thanks.

I made this as is and enjoyed it but the inside was a bit mushy for me. I’ve made something similar many times since by converting to a bowl (to save calories and carbs). I also add sautéed mushrooms for flavor and substance, sometimes chicken if I feel like it. Mix it all together and season with paprika, salt, and pepper. Delicious.

Very good.  We added green onions. Made it with whole wheat taco shells. Yum!

I always make the dish using only the base recipe.  This was no different, it was delicious.  I’m not sure what I will do next time because it really does not need to be modified.
