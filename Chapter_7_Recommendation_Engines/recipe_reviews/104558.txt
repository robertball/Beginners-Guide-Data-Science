I love this. The avocado gives the ice cream a gorgeous pale green color and almost a "green" flavor as wellâ€”it tastes really fresh, not overpowering & vegetal. We used sweet coconut cream, like you'd use for mixed drinks. As a friend said, "This would be wonderful served with light lemon butter cookies."

Mmmm...this was quite tasty. I kept waiting for a strange avocado taste after my first few bites, but it never came. It has a very fresh taste. It seems like an unusual combination, but it works perfectly together.

We used half & half instead of milk, added a teaspoon of vanilla and shredded coconut.  This ice cream is so refreshing and creamy. Probably the creamiest ice cream I have ever had.  The color is a very pretty pale green. Outstanding recipe!!! Thank you for sharing it.

I used two ripe avocado's, a can each of good quality coconut milk and coconut cream about 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of cocoa. It is delicious and makes a very nutritious snack for my grandson who is allergic to milk and eggs. Thanks so much for the idea!

This was a very tasty recipe, and a nice change of pace in our dessert routine.  It does taste very good with lemon biscuit cookies, and I think it would also be good with a banana cookie, too.
The only change I would consider making next time would be to cut back on the white sugar just a bit (maybe 1/3 cup instead of 1/2)... I think the sweetness of the coconut cream would still carry the flavor.  
Thank you for submitting this recipe.

its comes out beautiful and creamy. The only problem is that it needs to be eaten immediately because when it is frozen it is very hard to scoop and over time it goes a bit sour tasting.

I've made this three times now. The first two times were fantastic. The third time was a bust. It had a strong avocado plant taste. That said, taste your avocado before hand. If it has a strong flavor, it probably won't be good for this recipe. However, I did find that 1/2 tsp. almond extract had a strong enough flavor to overcome the taste.

Avocado and coconut would sound odd together but it's a great blend, espeically in icecream. My mother and I absolutely loved this recipe.

My PA Gina, originally from the Philippine's first turned me on to this; well actually it was just Avocado Ice Cream. But this is better with the addition of coconut. It will sure to please, in the summer heat.

Needed it dairy free, so replaced milk with Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. This was FABULOUS! You must like coconut, because that is the dominant flavour. But seriously, some of the best stuff i've ever tasted. NOTE that it does need a few minutes out of the freezer to soften slightly. And wait for soft, ripe avocados, or I can see this tasting "green".     YUM! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  even my kids loved it. I used an entire can of coconut milk and only about 1/2 a cup of milk. If you used all coconut milk this would make a seriously sweet and yummy vegan treat. Great for mexican night dinners!

I really wanted to like this, but... it just didn't work for me. I think I need more specific directions about the amount of avocado; the flavor was overpowering - and not in a good way.

This was a wonderfully smooth, fresh tasting ice cream.  It would be excellent paired with a sweet or spicy dinner.  Perfect pallet refresher!

Good lord! This was amazing. My favorite new ice cream I will make again and again. I will try withe the cookies. Yesterday was the first time I ever even tried Avocados. I made a salsa which kinda flopped, but this was heavenly. I even used  splenda in place of sugar and it came out fine. I used coconut milk and half and half. so fresh. Due to the fat content I didn't even have to pull out my Cusinart ice cream maker. It was practically ready fresh out of my Ninja blender. I will try the coconut or nuts with this next time. This would be great for Atkins diet. Not sure about the coconut milk for that one but you could sub with whipped cream. Dr Atkins would approve.

I don't often review recipes but this one was truly bad. The whole family took a bite or two, agreed it was inedible. This is my favorite ice cream flavor at a local creamery so I had high hopes for an at-home version. I think it was primarily the coconut cream that made it bad. It was sickeningly sweet and synthetic tasting. I may be brave enough to try it again and use coconut milk instead as it has a more natural taste. Also would use lime juice instead of lemon.

Coming from the 'I didn't know we had an ice cream maker when I made this until after I made it' perspective, so I mashed it into slush every 2-3 hours: SOOOO not worth the extra effort. I felt like I was back in the olden days mashing the ice cream to feed my starving family of 7. Taste-wise: VERY delicious (hence the 5 stars)! I'm sure if I made it in the ice cream maker it would have been wonderful. My mom didn't care for it. It was like eating a snowball. Next time I'll put in the ice cream maker :)

I haven't actually made this yet but it sounds wonderful, especially for my lactose-intolerant daughter-in-law. I grew up near Houston, TX in the early 1940's where avocados were not a staple ingredient in any grocery store but my mom did get them from a fruit peddler. Whenever they were available, she always made us some avocado ice cream, using our farm-raised fresh cream. Yummmm! Can't wait to try this with coconut!

This seems so bizarre that it wouldn't work, but it does!  It is so good that my sister requested I bring it for Easter dessert.  This is definitely a new favorite in our household.  Don't be afraid to try it, you just might like it!

However, it is always good to give a volume measurement since avos vary so much in size

After some experimenting I did like the end resulting ice cream.  The recipe calls for coconut cream.  COCONUT CREAM is not a sweet product and needs much more sugar than is called for in recipe.  Perhaps CREAM OF COCONUT should have been listed in the recipe as this would have provided the needed sweetness that I added with more sugar.

Good - a little sweet for me and I didn't taste as much avocado as I was hoping too, but the texture was awesome and I think I can play with it a little and get the flavor I was expecting. Thanks for the recipe!

This concoction was very interesting. I used 1 1/2 avocado and minimized the sugar. I love avocado, but I had a hard time eating this because of the consitancy. This is the most creamy ice cream I've ever had. But I'm used to the thicker texture with the avocado. I think if you love avocado more than coconut, you'll really like this. I just happened to like coconut better. It was definatly worth a try, and I've been wanting to make this. Maybe next time I would put in pineapple concentrate and less avocado. I hope this helps someone.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time; the taste was alright but the texture after freezing it  was more like a sorbet than ice cream.  I recommend using heavy whipping cream and whipping it to a whipped cream-type consistency.  Then add the avocado mixture to it before freezing.  It makes for a smoother texture and an authentic ice cream bite.

made recipe as written. Very creamy and smooth, it hasn't firmed up yet in the freezer, but the flavour is very mild and sweet, just a hint of coconut flavour (used full fat coconut milk), lovely smooth avocado flavour hits the back of the mouth. It tastes very fresh and mild. Would make again and maybe add a hint of cinnamon and/or cayenne to give it a bit of bite.

I halved the recipe, using 1 avocado, coconut milk instead of milk, sweetened pineapple juice instead of the coconut cream, only 1/8 cup of sugar, added the lemon juice, threw in about a quarter cup of shredded coconut (I LOVE coconut!) and blended it. I added a handful of chopped dates once it was done and it turned out delicious! I tried a spoonful of it right afterwards and it was so delicious that it never made it to the freezer! Thanks so much for sharing!

Ok, so this is the recipe I chose to christen the ice cream maker my boyfriend got me for my birthday.  It is strange and wonderful!  Strange and wonderful, I tell you!  I picked up coconut milk by accident and decided to give it a whirl anyway.  I think it solves the issues some had reported of the recipe being too sweet.  It tastes like California to me :)

When I made this recipe, it turned out way too sweet, and I felt the coconut overpowered the avocado.

I'm not big on either coconut or avacado, but this recipe is FABULOUS. Super easy, makes a good pudding if you don't have time to freeze, IMO. Tastes way better than any ice cream on the shelf; not only that, I don't have to worry about all the additives like syrups and artificial ingredients in store-bought ice cream. Why isn't a flavor like this on the shelves anyways??

I used a 13 ounce can of coconut milk and a cup of dairy half and half. The mixture lacked flavor so I added the grated zest and juice of 1 lime, increased lemon juice to 1 T. and 1/2 small can of crushed unsweetened pineapple, 1 tsp.vanilla and a dash of salt. Guest enjoyed the icecream for its pleasing and unusual taste, but all agreed it was too bland.

You can't taste the avacado?!? This was the weirdest tasting ice cream I have ever tried.  Better luck to you all!
