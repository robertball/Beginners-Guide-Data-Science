We loved this! I doubled the Italian sausage, added two minced garlic cloves and topped it off with fresh chopped basil. This was so easy to put together. This is a dish that will be made over and over. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious - my family of 4 all cleaned their plates. Per the other review, I added additional seasonings. I also doubled the meat and blended the diced tomatoes with the paste to make it less chunky (we all love meaty lasagna & none of us like really chunky sauce.) The best part was it took 30 minutes from start to finish when my normal lasagna takes 7-8 hours! I will definitely make it again in the future.

I had to add salt and garlic powder.  The tomatoes were a little sour, so I added some sugar.  It was ok.  I'm not sure I would make it again.

Made as directed, but added 1 tsp. oregano, 2 cloves garlic, and a pinch of fresh basil and it still wasn't good at all.  The canned tomato taste dominated this recipe, likely because the sauce isn't simmered to allow the flavors to meld.  Def won't be making this again.

This turned out great. Instead of regular Italian sausage, I used Italian links. Also, my 17 year old son doesn't link onions and I used onion powder. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. The links added a good texture to the meal. My son ate two servings! He called it bake-free lasagna. Would I change anything else? Well, there's always room for more cheese!

This was an easy twist on lasagna, that everyone liked.  The only complaint is it lacks seasoning as written and was a little bland for our liking.  I will make again but will up the spices and garlic.

This was really good! Enjoyed by everyone. I used gluten free noodles, bowtie wasn't available, but GF Rotini worked well. Next time, I might use extra seasoning, however, great recipe. Thank you Hunt's!
