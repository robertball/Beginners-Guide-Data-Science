The replacement mayo was great.  It tastes just like mayo without all the fat and grease!!

this was just ok.... i gave an extra star because i like the concept of the silken tofu instead of mayo - next time i'll use my favourite tuna salad recipe though and just steal the tofu idea from this. i didn't like the red wine vinegar - i prefer lemon, like i've used in the past.i also really didn't like the texture - i added another can of tuna to thicken it up

The flavor was a little bland besides the subtle spice that hit you at the end leaving an odd taste in your mouth.

Kinda bland, I ate it as a topper for a spinach salad, and it needed a lot of ff Italian to give it some zip.  Maybe more salt or some garlic powder or sweet pickle relish would have helped.  It was ok, but nothing I'll be rushing to make again.

It turned out good, since it was put in a blender it was super creamy, so I choose to put it on sourdough bread and sprinkle cheese on top and put it in the broiler. It was very tasty!

I put it at 2 stars because I had trouble draining the tofu from the vinegar and it was bland and sour as well.

This was  very good idea - to use tofu instead of mayo - but the end result needed some added spice. I added pickles and some black pepper at the end.

Followed directions and this came out tasting chalky with a weird aftertaste. I really wanted to like this :(  I just ended up making a mess in the blender. Maybe I used too hard tofu?? I dont know.
