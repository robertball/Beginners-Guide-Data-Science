I scaled this recipe to 6 servings, followed the instructions to the letter, and there's only one thing that I would do differently next time.  My gut was telling me to get some of the moisture out of the shredded potatoes, but the recipe did not specify this.  I would either wring the potatoes in a towel or put into a salad spinner to reduce the liquid released after shredding.  It took an extra 20 minutes to bake off the liquid in the dish.  BUT, these potatoes were delicious!  And if you have a food processor to shred the potatoes and onions, this recipe is soooooo easy.  Obviously, texture was different than scalloped potatoes, but the taste was similar.  Definitely making this one again.  Serene, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was very tasty. Made it as written and served with sour cream on the side because it reminded me so much of potatoe pancakes, just so much easier to make.
Two things to be aware of..may take longer to cook than specified and it really stuck to the pan and quite a bit was wasted.  Next time I will try oiling my cassarole dish first, but there will be a next time and a next time... Family loved it as well.

Light and fluffy this potato kugel was a hit with my wife and teenage daughter. Only thing I would do differently is to cut the onion smaller. I cooked it 15 minutes more until the larger onions were cooked. The flavor profile was delicious. Thanks again for a yummy recipie. Note: I used sour cream for dipping. Perfect.

This was so good!  I think I'll try it with cheese and bacon as a brunch dish!  It's a great side for almost anything!

I made this exactly how it was written. My family, who eats practically anything, did not care for it at all.

I have to say I've never never given a bad review on this site before but I made this exactly the way the recipe said and it looked nothing like the picture.

I will preface this by saying that I never post bad reviews of anything but this was just really bad. My god, what is wrong with this recipe? I followed it to the letter and it tasted so bland not even cheese could save it and looks like some sort of minced meat dish. My father eats absolutely everything and actually said “this is disgusting”. I’m being urged by family to toss it but I’m going to try to save it somehow.
