This pizza is so good that since we tried it Pizza night is not the same. For those that found this pizza grease I have a little change to share: Instead of the pepperoni use extra lean ground beef you may add a little extra flavor by using red and green peppers chopped. One more trick is to let the sauce cool down before adding to the crust so that the crust doesn't become soggy while baking.

I made this pizza on Monday night and was so thrilled with the flavor!  My husband and I loved it!  You can add any topping, but the flavors meld together so well and it is a hearty, homemade treat!  I will make this pizza recipe on a regular basis.  Thanks for the recipe!  I wouldn't change a thing!

This makes excellent sauce!  I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  My husband has never
said he likes *any* pizza but he liked this.

Would not be a Pizza I would "crave" but was tasty.  It is not necessary to use oil to cook bacon and pepperoni....they make plenty of "grease" to cook onions/peppers in may even drain before adding to tomato sauce.

A nice change from your regular pizza sauce.  I couldn't find pepperoni sausage, so I just added regular pepperoni when the bacon was finished cooking.  The sauce was a little runny; I might try adding a little tomato paste next time.

I went with Pattycakes suggestion and used some Italian sausage and then put my pepperoni on top. I added some black olives too but just because I love them and feel they make every pizza better. My sauce ended up a bit runny BUT that was probably due to the extra grease I added. This was my first time to make a pizza from scratch and I was thrilled with the results.

We really enjoyed this recipe but it was a bit too salty. I skipped the 1/2 teaspoon salt and we still found it salty. Maybe it was the bacon (even though I used reduced salt bacon)or the pepperoni  but I found with salted meats and cheese it was already salty enough without adding more. I will try it again and add more vegitables. I  made one pizza one night and used the remainder of the sauce to make up the second the following day for lunch. On the second day I threw in more onions and fresh mushrooms. Much better! Very good recipe though, the whole family loved it.

This was actually pretty good.  Not fabulous, but it had potential.  I left the oil out and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, but followed recipe exactly otherwise.  It needed a little more spice I think, it was a bit bland.  I will make again with some tweaks.

This sauce was Super Good! Easy and quick. I used some Italian sausage I had in the freezer instead of the pepperoni, I put those on top. This recipe is a bit deceiving, It is actually only the sauce. The name implies that it IS the pizza. I found lil 7oz bottles of Corona's in a six pack, soo cute! I used one and forgot to get the green peppers. I used the spices, onion, beer,sausage. Sauteed it all together and WA LA!! SAUCE FOR A GREAT PIZZA!! Thank You I will make this again:0

What an interesting way to prepare pizza. This has so many possibilities! I added spinach and cooked crumbled sausage. Even my spinach hating children loved it. Sadly, my husband hated this recipe. Maybe I'll have to work on tweaking this so he will like it better.

Oooh this was SO good.  Our Old Chicago restaurant closed down...but this pizza tastes like it's back in business!  
I used pizza crust packets and they best fit in a 9" round cake pan each.  I let the dough rest in the middle of the pan and then pressed the dough out and up the sides of the pan for a deep dish pizza.  
Our filling was minus the onions & peppers and plus black olives.  It was still amazing!  I used Bud Light Golden Wheat beer - wonderful!
The cheese got REALLY brown...probably because the toppings were underneath instead of on top.  I had pineapple pieces on one top of pizza and that cheese did not get as brown.  Next time I will put the cheese on for the last 5-10 minutes.
I'm eating the leftovers for lunch today and I can hardly wait!!!

I really enjoyed this. The addition of the beer is a really nice touch.  With most homemade sauce recipes I find that they are too sweet for my tastes, this one was not overly sweet.  It had a really nice balance.  I did add a little more salt than the recipe called for just to suit my personal preference. This will be our go to sauce recipe.

This was very unique.  Instead of using canned mushrooms, I sliced up some baby port mushrooms.  I used red bell pepper (it's what I had) and used Abita turbodog beer - it gave the sauce an interesting flavour.

This was really good and fun to make!  I only suggest that you use a really good crust.  Everything was awesome except the crust I selected.  The sauce was not watery either.  It was a tad salty but not too bad... so if you are sensitive to salt, I'd skip adding it to the sauce.

This was great! I improvised some things based on taste and ingredients on hand. 

I halved the recipe for one pizza. I made dough that rolled out to be about a 14 inch pie. I did not add the called for salt and I am glad; it was already very salty. I used fresh mushrooms, a large handful. Instead of using just tomato sauce I used one small can of tomato sauce (12 oz maybe?) and one half can of tomato paste (couple tablespoons)  to thicken it up. Was sure to drain off the grease from the bacon before mixing the sauce in.  I will for sure make this again, it was a big hit. 

NOTE: I think the nutritional value posted for this recipe is quite a bit off. I calculated this with my changes above (meaning NO pepperoni sausage and NO olive oil) and with my very standard 14 inch pizza crust recipe and it turned out to be about 400 calories and 19 grams of fat per serving/slice (total 8 servings per pie) and this is using a part skim mozzarella and trimmed bacon.  I don't think the nutritional value on the site is considering the crust or is considering only a thin, store bought crust and not a nice thick dough.

BEST PIZZA! Everyone went for thirds! I used Sam Adams beer, didn't use any meat or salt, added some pickled jalepeños and layered the cheese under the sauce. It had a nice kick to it. I plan on making it regularly- delicious!

Wow! Thank you for this recipe. Outstanding flavor. This was the first time I made pizza from scratch. I used this topping plus the dough recipe for the crust called "World's Easiest Bread Machine Puzza Dough." Fantastic.

tasty recipe but too salty. I did not add salt for the second pizza and drained the bacon fat before adding the tomato sauce and beer. this made the sauce less runny. I was not very very impressed but my family and in laws loved it.

This pizza was amazing! Served it as part of a pizza night with friends and it was the favourite amongst the non-vegetarians at the gathering. I made it exactly as written. I used a double smoked bacon and an IPA in the sauce. We have some leftover sauce that I am going to turn into a cheesy baked pasta. It is definitely a pizza that will get made many times over in our house. We also served the Husband Friendly Chicken Pizza and the Easy Tomato Basil Pizza, both from this site and both are recommended.

I put the pepperoni on with the cheese and browned Italian sausage with the bacon.  i think i would leave the bacon out next time. the beer was a great addition and helped make the sauce less sweet
