Sorry to say, it wasn't the best marinade I've ever had. I did marinate all day long and hoped it would impart more flavor. It lacked something, to give it some zing. Thought for sure with the lemon it would be fine but unfortunately it just didn't do it. I squeezed some fresh over it at the table and that helped. Might play with it some more.

I had some Meyer lemons to use up, I also found London broil on red tag sale. I looked up a recipe and this is what I found! I marinated them over night and fired up the grill. I made it exactly as written and boy was this just the Best!! I boiled the marinade and slathered it all over the steak. I cooked it perfectly medium well! This ROCKED :):):) Thank you Skunkee! Awesome recipe!

Marinade was good however it didn't really tenderize this cut of meat....even though it was pink inside, the meat was still not tender.  I wouldn't grill this again - I would however throw it in a crock pot bc/ the flavor of the marinade was good.

I did not prick holes in the london broil and doubled the amount of black pepper. I didn't have green onion so chopped a little yellow onion instead.  I also used a little more sugar by accident. Marinated overnight and I cooked in a slow cooker with a sliced onion. Not a whole lot of additional flavor but I liked that you could taste the meat. I don't think it would have been very tender cooked on the grill.

Great marinade and tender meat!  I like this marinade for gluten-free people - no soy.  Thanks Skunkee!

I used this marinade on Flank Steak, not London broil. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and cooked it on the grill. It was absolutely wonderful. I am not a particular fan of London broil, so I chose the Flank Steak instead. We had a crowd over for a weekend and everyone loved the flavor of the Flank steak.
