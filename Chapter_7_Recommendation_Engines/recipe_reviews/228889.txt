I first heard of Pretzel bread through Michael Symon on "The Chew." He said this was fantastic as buns for burgers. He was right. The rolls by themselves just wasn't our favorite, but buns for burgers now that's a different story. This recipe gives info for bread, rolls and chocolate rolls, but if you want to make buns...let the rolls rise again for 20 minutes and then put in the boiling solution.  I only boiled my rolls or buns for 30 seconds on each side. In all fairness, we didn't try it as loaves of bread. Five stars as buns (for us.)

I was so excited to make this because we have pretzel bread sandwiches in our cafe at work and I love them. I made these as rolls and they were gone in seconds. Will put this recipe with my favorites!

I made sandwich rolls, and the recipe yielded four good-sized ones.  The rolls were a little dense/chewy but, perhaps, this had something to do with the fact that I used regular "active dry yeast" instead of the "rapid rise" (didn't read the recipe thoroughly because I actually had some rapid rise in the cabinet).  Flavor was great, however, and I definitely will make again.

Made this for hubby - he's not a bread fan but does love his pretzel bread!!

For those who have issues with the rising:
1) Make sure the yeast is quick rise
2) Make SURE the warm solution is NOT too hot.  It will kill the yeast.
3) If you're still having trouble (I have issues with quick rising) try this.  Follow the directions up to and including turning the dough into the greased bowl.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Refrigerate overnight.  Then follow the other directions.

I do this for ALL my breads, as I can't get a consistent rise the other way - this method was in an old recipe for french bread, and gives me a consistent rise every time.  I never rise my dough at room temp, but always use the overnight method or I end up making bricks.

WOW! This is the BEST pretzel bread I have tried. I am a pretzel freak and very picky about soft pretzels especially coming from the NY area. These were absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe as directed except, since I was making rolls, I followed the advice of the person that said to let rise 20 min after punching down for rolls. The only thing I would change or add.. is to add Kosher Salt before baking!!! I plan on making pretzel sticks, nuggets everything with this recipe. This was great. Oh. .I also kept on 400 for 12 min, and then 350 for 10. Perfect!!!

This was my first time making pretzel bread and it worked! I made these into rolls for sandwiches. Tip:  Be sure to measure the water and baking soda correctly for the boiling process. If you use too little water to baking soda ratio then these will turn out salty. Too little baking soda to water then they won't have the pretzel taste.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I have tried this recipe 3 times and it never turns out. The dough never rises and is extremely dense. I follow the recipe down it the last word.

I just made these as 8 rolls, and they are delicious! They are soft on the inside and just a bit crusty on the outside. I forgot the egg wash, but I did sprinkle just a small pinch of kosher salt on them after I cut the cross on the top. They were exactly what I was looking for.

I used my bread machine and the ingredient amounts listed to make 8 rolls.  These are fabulous and the recipe is a keeper!!!  However, the rolls were a bit small for sandwiches, so I'll make 6 rolls next time.

I tried it twice over one weekend- yesterday and today. I made about 12 small long bread buns for snacking . 
The first try was alright, I realized that the dough was quite dry so it was not easy to form the shape I wanted. However the taste was great overall. The second trial today, I made them for the Super Bowl party. I have added a quarter cup of water when mixing all the ingredients. The dough turned out more elastic so it was better to form the shapes. Everyone liked it! Thanks for the recipe but it should be noted that the dough is quite dry .

I absolutely loved this recipe.   I made it exactly as stated, but next time I will make 6 buns instead of 8, reduce the baking soda water by a third, and use 1 teaspoon of salt in the dough, and sprinkle course salt on the top.  I made these for hamburgers and it was wonderful.

I made 8 buns. Boiled the same amount of time. Baked 10 min at 400 and then 7 at 350 which was perfect. The ones that I flipped again after boiling onto the pan had smoother tops. All were delicious!

I just made this for the first time & it is spectacular!!! Tastes like the best pretzels in bread form ever. I made about 8 rolls, boiled them the two minutes, baked at 400 for 12 mins., then at 350 for 6 mins. Can't wait for my kiddos to taste, they love pretzel bread & ham sandwiches in their lunches.

Great pretzel bread.  Didn't see to add salt to outside on instructions.  After baking brushed with butter and added course salt.  Very good.

To missem83: based on the problems you had, the most likely cause is faulty yeast. Yeast is a living organism and will die if it's too old or mixed into liquids that are too hot. Proofing is a good way to test your yeast. Mix the yeast called for in your recipe with about a 1/4 cup of warm water, or whatever liquid you recipe calls for. The liquid should be about 80 degrees- about the temperature for warming baby formula. You can also add a smidgen of sugar. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes. At the end of that time it should be foamy and giving off a distinct yeasty aroma. If it isn't, don't use it. Throw it away and buy fresh yeast. I usually use instant yeast, designed for bread machines. It doesn't have to be proofed before adding it to a recipe, so I only do that if I'm unsure if it is still good. I buy my yeast in large packages from warehouse clubs and store it in the freezer for much longer storage than would be possible otherwise.

Oh, how happy I was to try this recipe!  I had some of Costco's pretzel rolls a while back and loved them, but Costco is 90 miles away.  I tried this recipe and made them into small dinner rolls.  They were better than the Costco ones.  Next time, I will double the batch.  This recipe made 8 dinner rolls.  They kept very well.  I will freeze some next time.  Perfect with a ham and swiss sandwich with spicy mustard!

Turned out amazing, only things I did differently was I made 4 buns instead of 2 loaves, I only used 1/2 cup of baking soda to the 3 quarts of water (it's all I had), and I sprinkled some kosher salt on the tops after the egg wash prior to baking.

My first attempt at pretzel rolls! Perfect flavor and texture. The only thing I didn't like about it was the egg wash. It surrounded the rolls and made them stick a bit. Next time I'll try only whites.

I made these buns to go with pulled pork. They tasted great although the buns were a little tough. The first time I made them, i followed the directions but after I let the dough rise I couldn't get them to stick together to form little buns, which made them lumpy. So the second time, I made them into small buns before letting them rise but they didn't rise at all.. Not having the best luck with these but will definitely try again! Third time's a charm.

Love this bread. I've made small and big buns. The bigger ones are great for soup! Just cut the top and middle out and fill with your favorite soup for a warm, comforting meal.

These turned out exactly as described.  Word of advice - the dough will be very stiff and not easy to format into buns but patience pays off.

Love, love, LOVE this bread.  I used all of the ingredients without modification.  The only thing I did differently was I used a bread machine on the dough setting - turned out perfectly.  The bread has a wonderful consistency - not too dense, not too crusty, not too chewy... perfect.  My husband was upset that he liked it so much - he's worried about his waistline!  :)

Love this recipe. I've made 4 different sizes of rolls and can't keep them in the house. Notes: baking soda to water ratio is crucial or flavor can get a little weird. Also, my milk is always too hot straight off the burner, so I let it sit on a trivet and cool for a few minutes before watching the yeast and sugar bubble up in all it's goodness. For baking, it's usually a given, but I always let my yeast dissolve in the [milk and butter with sugar] for at least 5 minutes before adding salt and flour. Changes: started dough in mixer with hook until just combined and then kneaded. After rising, i pulled it into 20 popper sized rolls, boiled for 3 -4 ish minutes with 1/8 cup of honey, and then let them drain on a cooling rack. My slotted spoon is not super slotted so..... Finally, this last time I adjusted the temp to 350 for 20 minutes just to see what would happen. The result- just as delicious. This recipe is perfection and has become a staple over the last month, even being requested for holiday dinners. Thank you!!

LOVE this recipe! The only change I made to this recipe is that I don't really like cow's milk so I used what I had on hand which has been vanilla almond milk and it tastes great! I don't taste the almond milk flavor in it which is perfect. 
I have made this both as rolls and I also made sliders with these and wrapped the dough around the patty, caramelized onions and bacon and then used a beer cheese to dip it in. SOOOO yummy!!! When I made the rolls I cut them into 6 equal sizes and only cooked them at 400 for the time it recommended then took them out. For the sliders I kept them in for the full time recommended at 400 and then a about another 5-10 minutes after decreasing the heat to 350.

The recipe turned out great .  I did hold back some flour and add some of it during punching it down and shaping the rolls to be certain I did not end up with a super stiff dough.  I let the shaped rolls rise about 30 minutes before dipping them into the boiling water.  I would change the size of the rolls though. I made four and would make five next time.  I think the rolls would have kept the rounded shape better at that size.  Maybe even slider sized would be cute.  I used the dutch oven baking method.  (cover the bread for the first five minutes and then finish with the lid off - preheat your dutch oven first, then lower your bread into it.  Or, I preheat the dutch oven upside down on a baking stone and preheat it.  Easier than lowering loaves into the pot and then fishing them out after) The taste was slightly sweet.  The crust expanded, became nicely darkened, and was a bit crunchy like toast.  The texture / crumb was soft and would hold up well for burgers.  I made the havarti ham and cheese pretzel buns with parmesan garlic topping.  Very good roll for that recipe.  Giant Easter ham to finish.  :)  Just be patient, keep your eye on them while baking (internal temp around 204 degrees is about perfect), and cool them on a rack so they don't get soggy, and you will really enjoy these.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tastes just like a pretzel!! I made this as rolls and they turned out great. First time I've made a bread type item in awhile and this was a great one to get back into. I made this as rolls and wasn't sure if the timing would be the same. Worked out that the time after switching to 350 was only about 8 minutes. If anyone has different time suggestions, please post. I will be making this again.

I mixed this recipe in my bread machine on the dough cycle. I then took it out and followed the recipe the rest of the way. I made 6 rolls for sandwiches, and they turned out great. They taste yummy!

Love this recipe. Made 1/2 batch (rolls) just to be sure. They didn't even cool completely before they were gone. Thought the boiling solution was heavy on the baking soda but I wouldn't change a thing. This one is a keeper!!!
note: make rolls long instead of round for brats and hot dogs, perfect!

This is a great recipe.  I work in a Culinary Arts program at my local technical college & made these for staff lunch this morning (after having made them at home several times).  They never disappoint.  They're great for burgers or 'dogs (also done Lobster Rolls w/them) & I'm trying them this evening w/Philly Cheesesteaks.  YUM!!!

I made pretzel buns with this recipe for hamburgers. Easy as pie. The dough can be made in a bread maker -- just make sure that you follow the normal steps for that (my bread maker tells me to put the yeast in last). Recipe as written makes 6 really nice hamburger buns or 8 slider buns. Cook time and temperature seemed a bit off -- I scorched the bottom of my first batch, so on my second go-around, I only baked them at 400 for 9 minutes and then at 350 for 15-20 minutes. They came out just as brown on top but didn't scorch. :D

I made this recipes as directed and it was terrific. I made the 8 buns instead of the loaves. The bread did not rise to double in size, but did rise by 50%. However, in the hot oven it did rise more. This is not a difficult recipe and well worth the effort.

Turned out very well.  I did cheat and make my dough in the breadmaker, then proceeded with the boiling part.  Nice texture, soft but a little chewy and a nice crust.  Good recipe.

FUN and SO easy to make! I used Red Star yeast and oil instead of butter (I started following this recipe after I started another pretzel recipe...they used oil). I preferred the other recipes baking instructions: 450' for 10-12 minutes, so I stuck with that and was happy. I left the salt off some of the dough I shaped into knots and dipped those in melted butter and sprinkled with a Vietnamese Cinnamon & Sugar mixture...requested by my boyfriend. I had to force myself to stop eating these so we have some to go with our tomato soup for dinner!

I looked at several recipes on the internet before choosing to try this one. I can cook everything well except for bread. I've finally made good bread with this recipe. They tasted awesome! The family enjoyed them. I used bread flour instead of AP flour because I have more of it. And I made rolls instead of loaves. Anyways, I would totally recommend this recipe, especially if being a bread maker is not your strong point. Super easy!

This recipe turned out really great. I've made it twice, and on the second time around, I added about 1/2 tablespoon extra of brown sugar, and I made them into rolls rather than 2 loaves. If you're doing rolls, I'd suggest shortening the amount of time they're in the 400 degree oven... they were a little too brown when they came out. other than that, I'd say this is pretty foolproof.... I'm not much into baking bread and felt kind of clueless throughout the recipe but I was thrilled that they turned out great!!!!

These were easy to make and I thought they tasted like a pretzel. Even my husband said they were good, and he is VERY picky! Next time I make them I will reduce the baking soda in the water because I felt like the soda taste was a little too strong for me. Other than that, it’s a great recipe, thanks!

While it's no Sister Shubert's, this recipe worked wonderfully for me! For the record, in the boiling solution you will need 12 cups of water to equal 1qt, and if you're making rolls (as I did), keep an eye on the foam-like bubbles that form in the water. By the time I was done I was a little worried they'd boil over...

The only change I made was that I added about 1/4tsp of salt to the egg wash instead of sprinkling it on top (also as a way to help break up the egg). It tastes wonderful! The interior structure is quite close with no large bubbles, but still soft and flavorful :)

I had to resort to making my own pretzel rolls since my local Costco discontinued selling said rolls. This is a great recipe. Just be careful not to add too much flour. It took me several batches to figure out the best cooking technique. Cooking on parchment paper was a fail as the paper stuck to the rolls. Using cooling racks was not successful as the rolls did not rise properly since they sorta squeezed through the cooling racks instead. I finally buckled down and bought Sil-pat sheets (Amazon Basics, 2 for $10). They worked great and gave a great bottom crust.

Used Bread Flour because I like the texture better. Ended up adding about another 1/4 of flour during the kneading. Let my kitchenaid do the work for about 6 min. Turned out perfectly!

When preparing buns:
*this recipe should include an additional time to let the dough rise.
*Also, the recipe should instruct a decrease in time when boiling bun-size portions; which, when boiled for the same length of time as loaves, will yield only pretzels, and foreshorten the potential for buns, because the dough is then cooked through entirely during the boiling.
*Finally, the amount of baking soda listed exceeds a practical and palatable amount.

I've made these 3 times now--once, on a spur of the moment when the kids wanted them for sandwiches the next day. These are a bit dense, but so are the pretzel rolls at Costco, which we were comparing these to for taste, coloring, and density purposes. My son, who LOVES the Costco pretzel rolls, declared these better. 

I live in Colorado, so I made some adjustments due to the elevation: only 2 tsp of yeast per batch and I don't let it rise to full doubling or an hour--I do 45 minutes. Also, due to the dry weather, I need to add a bit of moisture to the dough as it's kneading (with my kitchen aid) to account for that. 

Other than those two or three adjustments, I make as written and they're amazing.

My gosh this was difficult! I was dreading the worst, but it didn't turn out half bad! Didn't use as much flour as recipe called for....otherwise it would be as hard as a brick! Still delicious

I did everything and exactly measured what the instruction said BUT...... when it came out of the oven& my hubs and i tasted them..... they were very very salty.... i ended up throwing them out bc it was that salty...... may be i should have just put 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of listening to the instruction.... gonna try it again w 1/2tsp n see if it will taste begged.....

I don't bake.  It sure looked and tasted like I did though!  Fabulous recipe.  I followed the directions.  Everything was easy and worked.  The only thing that was not exactly right for me was that I didn't need to bake it for as long as the instructions for the second stage of baking.  Every oven is different though.

It made a really great hamburger bun.  Although next time I will make them smaller as they were huge.

This recipe is fantastic! I made buns, and they are perfect for small burgers or sliders. I sprinkled a little kosher salt on top after the egg wash -added a nice complete pretzel flavor.

This is my go-to recipe for pretzel rolls. I usually wing up with 4-6, depending on how many people in feeding. I've also made them into pretzel nuggets for parties and they are always the first snack to go!

Holy friggin German bologna Batman! These came out perfect the first time. Luck I guess. Followed the recipe except when I added the third cup of flour the dough became dry so I added about a teaspoon and a 1/4 of milk. And it took a little longer than an hour to rise. I could have let it risen more I'm sure. But they were perfectly browned, soft, and chewy on the inside. My sister said she probably couldn't tell that from the ones at the German deli. 

Score!

These are AMAZING! Much better than any store bought pretzel rolls. I made them according to directions, but took the advice of another - after forming the rolls to cover with a towel and let rise another 20 minutes. Eight rolls are small for burgers, I would suggest making 6.  They are hearty, chewy, dense and YUMMY! Note: My dough took 1 1/2 hours to rise.

Aaaahmaaazing! I think I could give up all other foods and just eat these!! Made 6 rolls with the recipe last weekend and ate three right away! Dreamed of having them again all week. I am making the recipe again right now and I was totally disappointed that I didn't have enough flour to double the recipe. I will be making them into pretzel shapes this time or pretzel sticks and making some Maryland Crab Dip this evening so we can have Crab Pretzels!!! Mmmmm... Thanks for this awesome recipe.

I did the recipe exactly as it was written and it would not work. The dough was at no point cooked through and I know it was not the yeast (which was brand new). There was way too much flour or something was off.

Absolutely loved it. I didn't want to use 3/4 cup of baking soda, so I used only 2 quarts and half a cup, and boiled 4 buns at a time, but wow, they came out exactly like the pretzel bread I've missed from the states and Germany. 

I put deep fried chicken tenders on mine for a delicious sandwich.

These are great as buns!  We were looking for a twist on pigs in a blanket, and this recipe was the perfect fit.  We cut hot dogs into thirds and rolled the dough no more than 1/4inch thick.  Cut it into strips to fit the "pigs" and rolled up and sealed the seam.  You can even stick in some cheese before rolling for extra yumminess.  Boil for about 75 seconds and then do the 400 bake for about 10 minutes followed by about 10 at 350.  Watch for the depth of color you want on yours.  So very yummy!!!

Excellent! I used 1/3 whole wheat flour and still had a great result.  Dough was a little dry so I added few tablespoons of water 'til it was stiff but workable. The rolls are dense textured like a pretzel,  and don't rise a lot,  but have a wonderful soft, chewy, slightly sweet flavor.  I don't know how well they keep  because I don't think the extras from dinner will last until tomorrow morning.

Changes: used regular yeast,  1/3 whole wheat flour, 3 tbs extra water, made dough and froze it,  then thawed in an oven warming drawer. I did egg wash a second time immediately after they came out of the oven to boost the shine a little.

Love this recipe! I didn't have milk this time when I made them so I used powdered milk. They taste better this time around! They're soft on the inside, taste just like what you would expect a pretzel to taste like on the outside. Absolutely perfect! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Came out great! I had to figure out the water solution because it wasn't clear in the recipe. I also doubled the recipe and made 8 large rolls (instead of 2 like the recipe says?) and cooked it for an extra 5 minutes after I turned down the oven. I would have given it 5 stars but the directions were not clear.

Followed the recipe very close and first made hamburger buns. I then made another batch and refrigerated the dough. The next day I rolled it out, cut it into roughly 3 inch squares, I then put small slices of pre-cooked bratwursts I had leftover and a small slice of sharp cheddar cheese. I then rolled them up into a ball, making sure cheese and brats were sealed, let them rise for about an hour and then followed the recipe from dipping into soda bath and baking. Served with mustard sauce.

Turned out well but were a bit on the salty side.  I'm guessing if I boil them a shorter amount of time that might help.  Other than that, just like a pretzel, but in bun form!

I've made this recipe in the past and turned it into rolls with chocolate inside. I can't seem to find the directions for that now and perhaps it was on someone's review. Can anyone help?

I've lost count how many times I have made this recipe. It makes great buns. Only made loaf one time simply because it's easier to eat buns on the run. Try these one time....I can't even keep a double recipe on hand more than a day!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out exactly like the picture.  I made the rolls.  My husband asked me three times if I had really made them!  I will add pretzel rolls to my weekly bread menu!  This was a very easy recipe but so good that next time I will have to double it!

I tried it but the dough didn't rise! They were tasty but small! I didn't have quick rising yeast, that was probably the problem...going to buy that and try again!!?

Made this recipe and it was fabulous! Made it in my breadmaker so did not heat the milk and butter and made it into rolls but followed the recipe as it is written-Soft,sweet and crusty and so yummy-You will never buy rolls again if you make these yourself-This will be made again and again!

I have made this twice  I did not change anything before I rated it.  For me, I just need to practice on better looking rolls.  But this second time looked better than the first.  Love them!

The dough is very dense and the portions writing in the recipe is way too much for a single sandwich. So if I do this again, I'll be making this into 4 or even 6 portions instead of 2. Also don't boil this, it changes the texture..and not in the good way. I made one half boiled and the other half left alone then brushed in the egg wash. The half that skipped the boil was MUCH better, in comparison. 

TLDR: Way too dense, and portion into 4-6 buns instead of 2, and don't boil.

very good! They are nice and soft, Easy to make. I made mine too small because I though They would puff up, but they didn't. They stay the same size . Mine turned out dense but still awesome. I'm going to try making hot dog buns out of them!!

First time attempting any sort of bread other than pizza crust...and they turned out delicious!  I tried a small one out of the oven, a bit dense but delicious warm - it would be interesting trying them as pretzel knots.  Only got 7 rolls slightly smaller than my fist...for sandwich rolls I'd definitely make them larger, and I sprinkled a little sea salt on the top before baking, a must for pretzel rolls!

I made these in my bread machine, but other reviews said you couldn't get 8 good size buns so I made six.   Mine turned out huge. Next time will try to make 8.  I didn't let rise again, they didn't need it. Puffed up a lot in the boil solution.  I had to add a little more when the bread machine was mixing, approx. 1/4 cup, but I just added until the dough pulled away from the pan.  Baked 10 min at 400 and 12 min at 350.  Going to make burgers for these.  Honestly will make them again.

I thought these were better than store bought.  I made 8 rolls.  I think if I wanted them for sandwiches I would only make 4.  If I were to make again, I would use 2 qts water and 1/2 c baking soda.  I didn't need the whole solution.  I didn't put any salt on the outside, as with 2 t salt in the recipe I was sure they would be salty enough.  I was right.

Great and easy to make.  I havent made dough often before so I didn't understand the importance of working it for 8 minutes  otherwise, great with the taco turkey burgers we put on them.
