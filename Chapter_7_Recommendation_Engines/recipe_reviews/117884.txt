Lovely salad if you omit the water, which only dilutes the dressing. It's perfect and light without it. I added some arugula and a little radicchio and used kalamata olives rather than ripe black olives, but either would be equally as tasty. Really appreciated this recipe for not drowning the salad in a heavy, overbearingly vinegary dressing.

3/15/09:  This salad is very refreshing.  I love artichokes and the lemon is a natural accompaniment.  The only thing I would change is to use less salt, maybe only 1/2 tsp., in the dressing.  With the salt from the olives and artichokes, not that much is really needed.  I think I will make this again.  Romaine is high in vitamins A and C!  3/16/09 Update:  We had the leftovers tonight and I added more lemon juice and some white wine vinegar and it was much better.  The next time I make this salad I will use the following proportions:  1 1/2 Tbsp. water, 1 1/2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar, 4 Tbsp. lemon juice, 2 Tbsp. olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper.

This salad is awesome!  I would have given it 5 out of 5 but I made a modification which I think made a big difference.  I used 3tbs of lite italian dressing instead of water.  also used artichokes that were not packed in water as they have a more vineagary taste, which made the salad more flavourful!  loved it going to make it for the 3rd time tonight!

My parents and I thought it would have tasted just as good with cucumbers instead of artichokes, and we have a LOT of cucumbers from our garden. I also used a little bit more lemon juice than it called for since when I tasted the dressing initially it tasted like olive oil predominantly. Overall, a good recipe and one will will try again!

Very good salad.  Great for a hot summer night. I used marinated artichoke hearts because that was all I have but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.

This salad was pretty good. I cut the recipe in half, because I only had about 5 cups of lettuce. I used leaf lettuce, which is rather similar. The only thing I didn't add was the olives, because I am the only one that would eat them. For the black pepper I just did a sprinkle, as I do not care for it. The dressing had a nice flavor. ty

This salad was so easy to make and itwas a total hit at a recent gathering I brought it to. There was another salad for guests to choose from, but mine was the one everyone wanted! I got lots of compliments on the flavor of the dressing. Several people wanted the recipe. Thanks for this great crowd pleasing salad!

Made this for a group dinner that featured lemon in each dish.  It was perfect!  I ended up subbing Kalamata olives for the regular, and also put about 1 tsp. of lemon zest into the dressing.  Great recipe, thank you!

The ease of this recipe is what earns its 5 stars.  It is delicious, and I had everything on hand to throw it together at the last minute.  I used a bagged salad, and liked the lightness of the dressing - plenty of flavor but it wasn't oily.  My kids even gobbled it up!

This needs work as-is.  I followed the recipe but scaled it down and the only change I did make at the time was to increase the lemon juice by about another Tablespoon because as-is was (as a previous reviewer stated) too much olive oil taste.  If I make it again I'll replace some or all the water with white balsamic vinegar and I like another reviewer's idea of adding a little mayo although that may defeat the healthiness of it.  If you didn't add vinegar then I think marinated artichokes would help because it just lacks a little something as-is.

This is a delicious salad!  I used chopped olives in place of sliced and mixed them in with the dressing just prior to tossing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This salad is delicious and easy to prepare.  I usually use a mix of romaine and baby greens(for added color).  I also omit the water,reduce the salt and add 1 tsp of red wine vinegar to the dressing.   If you're feeling up to it home-baked garlic croutons finish this off nicely!

Excellent salad. Flavorful, colorful and refreshing. I followed others and used half of the recipe's water, substituting with half white wine vinegar and added extra (3 TB) lemon juice.

Light, crispy, refreshing... everything I wanted in this salad, it delivered. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this recipe-quite similiar to a lemony caesar as Kathleen states. I subbed tarragon vinegar as one member suggested and I'm glad I did. I think it would've seemed too light and watered down otherwise. I skipped the olives because I didn't have them and found that I didn't miss them. Shaved parmesan worked really well. Yum! Wish I hadn't waited so long to try it out!!

The salad was good, though I didn't really care for the water in the dressing.  I remade it with tarragon vinegar instead of water and added a clove or two of garlic.  Mmmm!  My lunch guest loved it!

FABULOUS!  I used all the juice from a lemon, and probably a little less olive oil.  I used white vinegar for 1/2 the water.  I loved how light the salad was.  Will definitely be making again!

Made this for the family last night.  It was fairly easy but I accidentally put chicken broth in the dressing as opposed to lemon juice (had them both in identical containers in the fridge) so I made the dressing over again.  Added a really tasty red wine vinegar in place of the water and extra garlic.

Great combination of flavours! This was a hit! I just made my own lemon garlic dressing (never any water!) but everything else was the same. Loved the addition of artichokes and olives. This will definitely be made repeatedly!

I used one TB white wine vinegar and no water & kalamata olives and it was quite tangy, which I enjoy. Very yummy salad, good to make for parties & potlucks.

Actually have been making this for years and years..  my parent's friend was a caterer in Chicago and gave me her recipe.  Definitely omit the water.  I always put the garlic thru a press.  Dry mustard powder is a must!!!

Nice summer salad, I left out the olives (don't like them) and I left out the water because I knew it tasted the dressing before adding it and liked it just fine, I knew it wouldn't enjoy it with the water. The artichokes went really well with the dressing; just an all around good salad. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. I left out the water and I cut the salt and pepper in half. Next time I will leave the pepper out all together and double the garlic.

I loved it....took another reviewers advice and did not add water to the dressing.  Other than that great salad and very fresh and light. Also added some lemon zest to the dressing.  Thanks!

This salad is soooo good! I have made it twice for dinner parties and it was a big hit both times. It is so light, fresh and tangy. The only change I made to the recipe was to use marinated artichoke hearts because they have more flavor. Tossed it right before serving and topped with shredded parmesan and fresh ground pepper. Delicious!

I could eat this every day.  The only thing I would change is switching to kalamata olives and doubling the lemon.

Got huge raves at the potluck I brought it to. I used half vinegar/half water. I'm planning on experimenting with using the dressing on all sorts of different salads.

I really like this salad!  I substituted vinegar for the water, added a pinch of sugar and a teaspoon of mayo.
