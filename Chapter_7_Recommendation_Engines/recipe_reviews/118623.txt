These are a MESS to make!  I couldn't get the garlic to stick, and there was too much ranch dressing.  I marinated the wings in it overnight in a zipper bag.  Two cups of BBQ sauce is way too much for just basting.  The foil packet idea doesn't work for wings - maybe for boneless breasts or thighs.  The wings fell apart and stuck to the foil - which is a mess with wings.  I ended up (trying to) remove them from the foil and just cook on the grill top and that helped.  Then I basted them with BBQ.  The flavor is good, but I don't think I'll make them again.  I may perhaps use dry ranch dressing mix and granulated garlic (less) on wings by itself, then a little BBQ sauce.
