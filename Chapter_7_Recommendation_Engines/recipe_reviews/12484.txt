My mother was the only one I knew who could make wonderful sweet potato pies.  This had to have been the recipe she used.  My husband and children went wild over them. - Nina

As sweet potato pies go it's OK.  You might think with all the butter it's sure to taste amazing, but I've made better recipes before with less butter and they tasted just as good, some even better.  Don't egt me wrong it tastes good, but if you want to be health concious there's plenty more spp recipes that are better. May be butter overload.

This made two awesome, artery clogging, pies...awarded 5 stars by my neighbor on her 98th birthday and my hubby.  But there is one very misleading ingredient here...6 sweet potatoes.  6 of the small thin tubers...or 6 of the huge, almost football size that I buy locally that are still tender to the skin?  I quickly realized that 6 would feed half of our small community and dropped it to 4...then could only get three into my large pot.  I weighed them and they came to 3 lbs.  So 3 lbs. of sweet potatoes is much more accurate.  Those pies sure disappeared quickly and deserved every one of those stars!!!

Perfect!  My fellow Americans and I really wanted some thanksgiving pie, but it is hard to find ingredients where I live right now.  This pie was simple, and everything was inexpensive and easy to buy.  I also melted some marshmallows on top because my husband insisted.  It was delicious!  Thank you!

Delicious! I followed the recipe ver batem and the pies turned out great!
I used Jiffy brand "just-add-water" pie crust mix which is wonderfully flakey. I also did not have allspice in my cupboard so made my own. Here's the recipe if you need it: 2 parts cinnamon, 1 part nutmeg, 1 part ground cloves. Just mix them up in an empty cinnamon shaker. Will be making this again and again! Can't wait for Thanksgiving!

This pie is GREAT!!!!  Over the past 2 years it has become the most requested dessert at family get togethers especially at the holidays.  My mom even has me make extra custard and she freezes it in mini pie shells to have whenever she wants one throughout the year.

This one is a keeper - the only modification made was I added 1 tsp vanilla.  Also, the next time instead of 2 pies I will opt for (1) 9" deep pie shell.

Husband wanted sweet potato pie for Christmas so I went with this recipe but tweaked it as follows:  4 big yams (unscaled recipe called for 6 but when we were shopping, we were looking at a different recipe); used nutmeg instead of cinnamon and ground allspice; nixed the salt.

The pies were an absolute hit!  Sent some to mother in law and she called and said she loved it.

This was my first time making a sweet potato pie.  It was great.  I did however make a minor change only because I wanted to.  I only used 2 eggs and I added about a half of cup of milk.  Great recipe. I will be making it again

i have always loved sweet potato pies, and not to be corny but when it comes to taste this one takes the cake.  I thought this was an excellent recipe only missing one thing... a touch of vanilla.  When making this i realized that although delicious that the taste needed a finish to it, and the only thing i could think of to add was just about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. so yet again thank you Nancy for the wondrous recipe.

To me a sweet potato pie is not a true sweet potato pie without allspice.  That is the key, that is what distinguishes it from pumpkin.  This recipe is the real deal.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used a Trader Joe's frozen pie crust which produced a fool proof pie.
For those who are unsure about how much sweet potato to use in your recipe,  I used six medium  organic sweet potatoes which  produce 
5 1/2 - 6 cups. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I have never made sweet potato pie before so I was a little intimidated. I found this recipe and I have to say that this was the easiest pie that I have ever made. The family loved it. I definatly will make this again.

Could someone let me know the amount of sweet potatoes needed? The pie sounds amazing and familiar, but six sweet potatoes? The sweet potatoes I have are Xlarge ( about 2 lbs each ). 
Would 2 cups or 2 lbs be the accurate amount needed?
Thanks! Hope to try this pie. Sweet potato pie a fav for Thanksgiving.

I used canned yams for two pies. Almost perfect. Maybe it could have been a little more sweet potatoe-y.

I have been making the pies with this recipe for at least 5 years.  Really easy, boiling the sweet potatoes makes the peeling and mixing super easy, and they always are a hit.

Great recipe!  I had two and 1/2 large sweet potatoes.  The recipe halved beautifully.  Use 2 large eggs for 1 pie.  My potatoes weren't completely baked; so I also gently boiled them (peeled and dark spots removed) for about 10 minutes.  I put a dash of allspice (none in the filling) and dash of salt in the pot with very little water.  1/8 tsp of vanilla in the filling.  This made a deep dish pie.

My 1st time making A sweet Potato Pie...it was good..although I combined 2 recipes 
I bought a bag of potatoes (small & ugly at Food Depot for $1.78)
1 stick of soften butter
1 1/2 cups of sugar
3eggs
1 teaspoon cinnamon 
1/2 nutmeg
3/4 milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
**I also would recommend a deep dish pie crust...I had enough to also make a souffle
*** mix egg and milk together and combine with other ingredients..Bake.&.ENJOY!!

I do these for Thanksgiving instead of Pumpkin. I have always prefered the texture and with a blender to mix the ingrediants it is also simple.
