Simple and delicious, just what I needed. I used organic reds, reduced fat sour cream, homemade dry ranch dressing mix and New York sharp cheddar cheese. This was very easy to make which I appreciated on a chaotic day like today--I just combined the ingredients quickly this morning and let it sit all day in the fridge. And I'll tell you, the longer it sits, the better it gets!

Simple, easy and delicious! I love red potato salads and when you combine bacon and ranch - what's not to love? I always leave the skins on for red potato salads for a little bit of added color and flavor. I used light sour cream and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix. I mixed everything together and let it chill for a few hours and prettied it up with some additional thin sliced green onion on top. I might try this with bleu cheese next time for something a little different. Overall, very good - thanks for a great recipe KristenB!

I've made a similar salad many times.  I use bottled ranch dressing, bacon bits, green onions and no cheddar cheese.  Make sure your potatoes are cooled completely or they'll absorb the dressing and you'll have to add more.  This can be served cold or at room temperature.  You don't have to worry about the mayo spoiling in hot weather because there's none in this recipe.

Yummy!  Only thing I did differently was add some hard boiled eggs.  My family asks for it all the time.

I wanted to make a potatoe salad that my kids would eat and this is it! Very easy to make, tastes great. I didn't add all the green onions just 2 and about 5 pieces of bacon but came out wonderful! Will make again and would definitely take to a potluck, I think it would go over very well!

I fixed this with some other salads for a meeting. Several asked for this recipe who usually don't like potato salad - I don't usually like potato salad, but this one was great.  Oh, and I served the bacon on the side so that my vegetarian guests could enjoy it too.  I also used already cooked bacon and save time, money and mess!

This recipe is so easy to put together and everyone will think you spent all day in the kitchen.  It was a little on the "ranchy" side, so next time I might just add 3/4's of the pack of dressing.  This potato salad was gone in no time.

I substituted sour cream for 12 ounces of plain Greek yogurt and used red potatoes. I also added hard boiled eggs. I ate a significant portion while in was making it. Very yummy.

It was okay- I would use fresh bacon over bacos and limit the amount.  I think I added too much which might have ruined it.

We absolutely loved this potato salad!  It is quite similar to my go to recipe, but the addition of the ranch just makes it even better.  I did add some chopped scallions and kept the skin on the potatoes, but otherwise made it as is.  This is a definite keeper for our summer picnics!

This was just OK, nothing spectacular to my taste buds.  I think it has to do with a particular mood as much as anything.  German Potato salad or plain ol' dill potato salad suits me better.

Excellent salad! I made it last night for a picnic and it was a hit. Even the kids liked it! I doubled the potatoes and increased the sourcream and it turned out excellent. Thank you for a good recipe that was very easy to make!

Yum! I love that this potato salad does not have mayo. It has everything you could possibly want on a baked potato.  We will be making this again.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I left out the shredded cheese because I didn't get low fat sour cream and I wanted to cut out some fat. Added the crumbled bacon when it was served so it would add some crunch. I haven't had much success with potato salad in the past, and even though I over cooked the taters this was delicious! I did a half batch and there was a little too much of the Ranch mixture. But I loved this recipe and will be making it over and over again!

I made half a recipe.  Used less than half bacon and it was so salty, we could not eat it.  Don't think we would like it even with less bacon.  Sorry.

The flavors in this potato salad were yummy but it needed more sauce as it was very dry. I would also reduce the cheese by at least a 1/2 cup as it was  way to cheesy and I like cheese. I also feel like the amount of bacon could be reduced to 1 cup. I used 0.4 oz. pkg of ranch dry mix and it was really ranchy. I can't imagine using a full oz. if it.SJS9

I discovered this recipe on my own some 10 years ago. I sometimes add a  little  bit of apple cider vinegar to give it more of a German potato taste.

I made this exactly like the recipe and brought it to a cook out.  A couple of veteran  cooks brought thiers, all  dressed up with lettuce and fresh parsley.  Mine was in a Tupperware container!!   In an hour or so, mine was gone, the other's hardly touched.  Later, I got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe, which I gladly gave out.  This  recipe is easy, repeatable, and consistent.  This recipe makes potato salad worth having!!

I made this identically as written as I do every first time making anything.  There is only one thing that I may change next time would be an increase a little of cheese. (Everybody loves cheese) otherwise this is a wonderful recipe

This was a great change up from the regular potato salad and I'd definitely make it again. It's the same process to get it together, so super easy in my opinion.

Very simple and easy to make.  I just made it to take to a summer neighborhood party.  I did make one adjustment.  The sour cream seemed to overpowering to me so I added 1/2 cup of Hellman's Mayo.  That tamed it to perfection! Vic

I followed this exactly as I needed a quick party-pleaser without being mayo-based.  It was outstanding.  I saved a lot of time and mess by using store bought pre-cooked bacon (toasted in the toaster oven until very crisp).

Loved this but mine dried out pretty fast. Used half a 5 lb bag of reds so maybe that was it? Curious if ppl are just adding extra regular ranch if they serve for more than one time?

Made this for a barbeque - wanted something a little different.  The red potatoes are the key as they don't break down (Mashed potato salad)  I added a little more garlic powder and some Montreal seasoning, also probably a full cup of Ranch dressing as well as the dry mix.  This one is a KEEPER!!

OMG !! Just made this today, for a bday party. The party isn't until sat., & had planned on making it a day ahead. I just tried it.. delish ! I didn't change a thing, except that I doubled it at the last minute, thinking it wouldn't feed enough. I only had 3 bunches of onions & was too strapped for time to run to the grocery store.
This tasted like a stuffed baked potato.. yum !  I guess as Kristen suggested herself, you could "make it your own" by adding your own spin on it. I may try, but I can't imagine it being any better !!!
Thanks Kristen.. by the way, this is the first time I have ever made potato salad in my life.

This was the first time I ever made potato salad &  this came out very good, but I gave 4 stars because the amount of bacon,  cheese, & green onions seemed to be too much to suit our taste.  I used 5-6 slices of bacon (which was enough), about 1 cup cheese, & 2 green onions and it was perfect for us.  I will make again but next time I will add hard boiled eggs. Thanks for sharing.

I subbed non-fat yogurt for the sour cream because I always do trying to cut fat, but with the cheese and bacon, that was a little futile.  Even with that sub it was still 5 stars!  Hubby loved it and I even tasted a little (completely off my diet).  Definitely a keeper!  I liked the fact that I could transport to the church luncheon today and not have to worry about it going bad.  Great idea!!!

Loved this!  How can it not be good with all these great ingredients.  I even used reduced fat sour cream, light ranch dressing (instead ranch mix), center cut bacon and 2% reduced fat cheese and it was still awesome.  Thanks KristenB for a great recipe.

My family absolutely loves this potato salad! I have always gotten rave reviews anytime I take this dish to get togethers. I love that it has zero mayonnaise!  I make this exactly as written and sometimes, depending on my mood, add more bacon or more cheese. And huge confession, I prefer mine served hot. Cold is okay, and my husband loves it like that, but I always heat mine up and it is just to die for. This has become my favorite version of potato salad. Thank you Kristen!

I'm not a fan of tangy potato salads and everything is better with bacon so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  Family that have egg allergy loved that it had sour cream.  It was a refreshing take on the usual potato salad.  Everyone loved it! I will be making this again!!

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have red potatoes so I used russets. I also didn't have the packet of ranch dressing mix so I used bottled ranch dressing and reduced the amount of sour cream so I had a mixture about half sour cream and half bottled ranch dressing. I also used Gouda cheese because that's what I had. This recipe will be delish with whatever type of cheese you have. I also put some celery and some finely chopped red bell pepper. My husband thinks he likes this better than the regular style potato salad! Another reviewer said it had all the components of a loaded baked potato-- so, what's not to like? Thanks Kristin!! This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be making it frequently!

A first for me using bacon in the potato salad. I'll be doing that again for sure. We just love the flavor it adds along with some Lawry's Taco Seasoning.

I love this potato salad with just a couple of changes. Instead of the ranch seasoning packet, I just sub my fav ranch dressing and decrease sour cream as necessary. Less salty. I sometimes add just a bit of mayo to thicken it up.

I made exactly as recipe said.  It was good, but I used the great value ranch packet instead of hidden valley, and maybe that's why it was just good.  I am not sure but mine didnt seem to taste like ranch, and I used the whole packet as it said to. Next time maybe the hidden valley has more flavor

I make a similar potato salad, but I add 2-3 stalk celery and 6 hard boiled eggs with the potatoes. I also use 1 lb bacon.   I then mix in a separate bowl 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream instead of 2 cups sour cream.  I also add  1 pkg ranch dressing, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a pinch of smoked paprika.  Mix the salad dressing with the potatoes and add salt and pepper to taste.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  I like to make it the night before to pull together all the flavors.  Everyone loves this potato salad.

Love this potato salad. My husband requested it as a side for BBQ ribs.  Next time I make it, I will use mild or medium cheddar cheese, as I don’t like sharp.

I made this for a friends and family BBQ, we are  traditional potato salad family and I was a bit worried that no one would like it because it wasn't what we grew up on.  I follow the recipe but added a pinch or 2 of mrs dash, Hence the 5 star rating. No leftovers, no complaints.

My family loved the fresh taste of the ranch dressing.  I have small grandchildren and they prefer this potato salad because they are not fond of the normal egg type potato salad.  Kids love anything made with bacon or cheese.

Thanks anyway!!

Something about this wasn't quite working for me in term of texture/consistency.  The amount of sour cream dressing seemed overboard at first - though I think the potatoes may have absorbed a lot of it, because after sitting in the fridge for a few hours the whole thing became really solid.  My potatoes were quite cool by the time I mixed, so I don't think that was the issue.  If I were to try making this again I might do half sour cream/half mayo and reduce the overall volume of the dressing a bit.  Also, not sure the shredded cheese is really adding anything here.

I made this as written...So good! I made 6 lbs of this for my friend's son's 16th birthday party and it disappeared fast. Most people were going back for seconds, some for thirds.

When I saw this recipe I decided to try it out because there was no mayonnaise or mustard in it. ...Everyone in my family loved it!!  We were all so pleasantly surprised because we've never liked potato salads in the past.  We've made it twice now and will definitely make again.   The only additions I made was to add some boiled eggs and a little salt.  I look forward to trying out some other additions as suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for  sharing this recipe - it's a keeper!!

Followed recipe exactly with fresh cooked bacon and left the optional skins on the reds. The family liked it but everyone agreed that it needed more "zip" and flavor even after letting it sit in the fridge for 2 days.  I usually doctor up the recipe's on here to my liking but decided to follow this one exactly since I've never had anything like it before. Next time I will use russet potatoes and sub 1/4 of the sour cream with mayo to get the "zip" that everyone seemed to miss.

I've been making this for years, but have called it Baked Potato Skins Salad.  At some point, I found I preferred the potato texture/dressing cling if I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them.  I have a quilted pocket for doing this in the microwave, so it heats up the kitchen even less.  Imagine using roasted...
Definitely use real bacon.
Always gets rave reviews, and then people wonder why they didn't think of it!  Those who usually turn their noses up at "potato salad" ask for seconds.

I have never liked potato salad, mostly because the texture of the egg in most recipes puts me off.  This salad is easy to make and absolutely delicious!  Even die-hard traditional potato salad lovers enjoyed this when I served it at a BBQ.
