The meatballs had a really good flavor, however, the sauce really needs some sugar. The cheese kind of gets lost, not sure I would use in these next time.   The sauce was tangy and very tart.  With some sugar I think it would make a world of difference.  The maple syrup didn't add enough sweetness.  I wish I had of tasted the sauce before I poured it over the meatballs. I would like to try these again but sweeten the sauce up a bit for a more tangy sweet balance.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks for sharing.
