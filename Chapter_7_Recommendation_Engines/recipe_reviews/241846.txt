This fish was so easy and so amazingly good. I had three 8.5 oz. fillets, so I just mixed up the marinade in a measuring cup and poured a little bit onto each fish while in sitting on their sheet of foil. I then sprinkled the Old Bay, salt and ground pepper, some minced garlic, and the teaspoon of capers, topping each with two lemon slices and a sprig of garden fresh rosemary. I then sealed all edges well into a pocket leaving room for the steam to expand. I also let the fish marinate in the foil packets for 30  minutes before cooking. I only made half the sauce since I could only get a tablespoon of lemon zest from my two lemons, but it was plenty for us. I just added about a teaspoon of minced rosemary and teaspoon of olive oil, a tablespoon seemed a bit much for our taste. I wasn't sure I'd like the sauce, but boy it sure was wonderful on the fish. I really wouldn't want to smother the fish with it since the fish was so refreshing even without it. We cooked on gas grill at 400° for 16 minutes and ate them right in the foil packets. This is going on our summer grilling rotation.

The whole family loved it!! I rubbed the dry seasoning on salmon fillets and let them sit about 15 minutes. Mixed up the lemon juice, white wine & olive oil, and poured it over the fish. Grilled it in the foil packets about 10-12 min, and it was literally the best salmon I’ve ever made!

I loved this recipe.  The sauce was the key component.  It is amazing!  I don't like salmon, but my son does.  So I made this for him and ended up eating half of his plate!
