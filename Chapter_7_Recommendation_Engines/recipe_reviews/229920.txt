Using 2 large sweet potatoes instead of 3 and 3 T sesame seeds instead of tahini, I found this to be delicious, especially with chunks of apples!

Oh wow!  This is one of the best recipes on this site.  Absolutely LOVE it!!  The coriander is a key ingredient and gives the recipe a distinctive taste.  Please do not make the recipe without it and then review it with only 3 stars because the recipe was 'bland'.  I did substitute 2 T. toasted sesame seeds for the tahini because I didn't have the latter.

I loved this recipe, and even my kids who don't really like hummus and definitely don't like squash, ate it.  I had some roasted butternut squash so I used that instead of sweet potatoes.  I also blended 2 T. sesame seeds in my blender before adding the rest of the ingredients, instead of using tahini.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious!

In all fairness, I didn't really follow the recipe.. skipped the garbanzo beans all together and just used sweet potatoes. Added cumin, garlic, olive oil, chili oil, salt and tahini to taste.  Its a wonderful idea for changing up the old hummus routine, and the recipe is flexible enough to suit anyones taste.

I love this recipe.  I use 3 Tbsp of olive oil,one clove of garlic,( I make my own tahini by roasting sesame seeds and grinding, so easy), added 4 Tbsp of lemon juice and lime zest because I use the myer lemon and they just don't zest well.  Great hummas!!!!

I really liked this recipe a lot, and will be making it again.  I'm giving it four stars, because I felt that something was missing.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic as per others' suggestions, and that really brought all the flavors together nicely.  Everyone really enjoyed this, and asked for the recipe.  I may see how some fresh cilantro tastes next time...

I followed the recipe as written. This was pretty good and a nice change from traditional hummus. The potato gave it a nice creamy texture and a light sweet taste, and the seasoning was mild.

One thing I like about hummus is that you can easily make the recipe your own. One could easily spice it up by doubling or tripling  the coriander and cumin, or use other spices such as garam masala or herbs.

Amazing recipe.  We loved it.  We substituted 2 Tbsp sesame seeds, toasted and ground up and a bit more olive oil for the 2 Tbsp tahini.

That poor dude who didn't follow the instructions to thin it out doesn't know what he's missing, does he?  This is some of the best hummus I've ever eaten.  And that's straight out of the blender.  Can't wait till it's been in the fridge and melded!  Thank you--loved it.  (Added more coriander & lemon juice; my yams were old SO! used a CAN of sweet potatoes, rinsing all the syrup off.  Don't know the difference, so, don't KNOW the difference.)

As written, it's a god start, but it was lacking something.  When I served it, threw an extra drizzle of EVOO and a sprinkle of paprika. It save it a slight of a kick that it was lacking before.

This was very good.  But I don't understand why weight isn't used for something so variable in size as sweet potatoes.  So, for the record, I used 2 average sweet potatoes that weighed  12 oz.  I thought the consistency and flavor was good using most of the garbanzo liquid; the recipe made 2 cups.

I love this recipe - as many do, I just tweaked after I made it the first time to add more of the spices that I love - the original recipe itself is very good!

i made this recipe as part of my Allrecipes Canadian Allstars challenge. This recipe has potential. i made the recipe as it was written. The texture is spot on. i did not use any of the reserved liquid from the garbanzo beans, however, next time i will double the corriander and cumin and perhaps incorporate some roasted garlic as i found the recipe on its own a little bland. i will also leave the  lemon zest out as i thought it to be a little overwhelming, but not terrible.  Overall, a good recipe!

I was a little worried the bean taste would be too strong but after a few hours in the refrigerator the flavors melded together very nicely. I will definitely make this again!

I used 2 sweet potatoes instead of three and black pepper instead of white; it turned out great. I added the 3rd sweet potato to leftovers the next day to beef it back up for enjoyment in the coming days on burritos, etc. A solid recipe overall!

From reading other reviews, I added some garlic, and more spices, more lemon, and only used 2 potatoes. Tried making this in my Vitamix...way too thick. I would recommend a food processor for sure.  It's tasty now, and I'm hoping even better after chilling for a while. Thanks for a great base recipe.

I used salt and a clove of garlic but none of the other spices the recipe calls for. It came out like a traditional hummus but with the sweetness of the potatoes, which I really liked!

Very good and different, especially with apple slices. Couldn't decide if I liked it better with or without garlic - both ways were good.

Very yummy. Good on vegetables for a healthy lower-calorie treat.  Didn't have tahini so used roasted sesame seeds as others suggested.

I had one really huge sweet potato from mom's garden.  So, in this case I only used one potato.  Also, I added garlic powder.  You can really taste the sweet potato and it's good!

I didn't have ground coriander so I added fresh parsley.  I thought the recipe needed more flavor. Just ok.
