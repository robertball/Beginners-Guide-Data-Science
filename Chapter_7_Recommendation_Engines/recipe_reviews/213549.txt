Absolutely delish! We all loved it! I was out of nutmeg so I used allspice which gave it a nice "apple pie" flavour. The only complaint is the chicken is really difficult to cook after breading. I think next time I'll brown the chicken first and then immediately bread to see if that works better.

This is right out of any classic Cuban cookbook.  The mixture of sweet and spicy is wonderful.  If you like this recipe, I urge you to look into Cuban cooking.  Its not firey hot like the rest of Carribean cooking and the flavors are fantastic.

I made the sauce to pour over drums and rice (because I didn't have breast on hand, and we are Gluten Free). The sauce was excellent. I didn't have nutmeg, so I added ginger instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. Still excellent, gave it a very tropical Pacific Islands flavor. I think it would even bee good with yellow curry. Great idea.

What a super yummy dish!  I used butter instead of margarine, crushed red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and regular rice instead of basmati.  Other than these minor changes I followed the recipe.  It was very easy (I did use toothpicks to pin the chicken breasts shut).  It was a longer process than a normal dinner but worth it.  Full of wonderful flavors, I'm looking forward to leftovers!

I made some changes, but the chicken was very bland. Papaya is not a strong enough flavor to do all the work here.  If I made it again, I would definitely add salt and probably other spices.

This was suprisingly delicious.  I went a lil heavy on cinn. and cayenne because I like a lil extra heat.  That cinn. was strong... oops.  Everything was perfectly timed and couldn't be happier.  Thanks for the recipe.

I picked some papaya from my new home's garden, and had no idea what to do with it.  Wonderful recipe, but the sauce was especially AMAZING!  Can't wait to make it again.
