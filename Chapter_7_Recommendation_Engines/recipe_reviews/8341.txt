What didn't burn on the floor of my oven was delicious. Overflow was unavoidable. It must be explained that this recipe should be mixed by hand since an electric mixer (in my case 5qt Kitchen Aid) will beat too much air into the batter as well as causing it to dry out in the oven. Very simple recipe.

This was the first pound cake I ever made and it turned out beautifully! I halved the recipe though cause after reading the reviews it seems that you get 2 cakes from the full amount of batter. I got 1 perfect sized cake. The batter does rise quite a bit and the top seems to brown fast so I had to turn down the heat 3/4 way through cooking. It smelled wonderful in the oven, yum! The taste of the cake itself is not too sweet at all, in fact it's perfect and I was delighted by this because it leaves opportunity for many different types of toppings! I served up some slices with a dusting of confectioners' sugar and a generous drizzle of Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce (found on this site) and it was great! I think I'll add some whipped cream to the combination next time around. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent Recipe...mine was very moist and firm...the outside was just a little bit crusty and it turned out a beautiful light golden brown.  It did take the full 90 minutes in my oven but I checked on it from 60 minutes and on...I had taken notice of everyone who said that theirs overflowed....I put a cookie sheet on a shelf below and lined it with foil.  There was some overflow but not a huge amount.  When I inverted it was a very large pound cake.  I did use 2 full teaspoons of Watkins double strength vanilla and the flavor was excellent. Loved this recipe...can't wait to try it with strawberries and whip cream..
Thanks

I've made this one about 10 times.  It's a great pound cake!  A LARGE tube pan does nicely with no overflow.  Sometimes I add some thing different, extra sugar, lemon extract, almond extract, food color swirls, etc.  One time I only had 5 eggs, and it came out fine.

The best fool-proof, versatile cake recipe I've ever used, and I've tried a lot of them. You really can't screw this up if you follow the recipe properly. As for it rising too much, I've never had it happen and I've done more than a dozen of them.  05 april 2009 - update: still my favorite cake ever. If you're doing large batches (i.e. professional baker), make the recipe for 24 portions, and it fits perfectly in a full sheet pan. Also discovered that it works fine if the oven is already preheated; just decrease the baking time and watch it closely.

This cake was soooooooooooooo delicious. I started out just baking one for a neighbor as a thank you gift. But it turned out so good and had my home smelling just as good, my husband had me to make another for our family. I did have some overflow the first go round but the second time i just filled my bundt pan a little over half and filled the rest in a loaf pan.  Two for the price of one!  Great!!

A delicious cake that is easy to make and not too heavy. When I put the mix in my 10 inch bundt pan it almost filled it t the top. I was worried about it overflowing so i tapped it on the counter several times to release some air bubbles and it didn't overflow, it did climb over the top though...careful!!

I have baked this cake several times now.It is so far the best pound cake I have baked. I just finished baking again with half the recipe and it still turned out great tasting. Awesome recipe or perhaps its because I always talk to my cake when in the oven that "PLEASE RISE&SHINE".

Good basic pound cake.  The outside of it came out slightly crisp and sweet, and the inside was very moist.  It raises very high so be careful.  I took the advice of another on here and used a cookie sheet underneath.  It will spill through the center hole of the bundt pan.

I like the texture of this cake as it's lighter than usual pound cake. Followed others' suggestion of spliting the batter into 2 pans. I'm glad I did coz it rises high! I also mixed 1/4 of the batter with cocoa powder n chocolate chips for a "chocolate surprise". Will add lemon or orange zest next time to add more flavor. Overall a good cake.

I give this recipe four stars, but only because I modified it.  Taking the advice of another reviewer, I completely eliminated the baking powder, making it a much more "true" pound cake AND entirely eliminating the overflow problem.  I also converted it to a lemon pound cake by substituting (1:1) fresh lemon juice for the vanilla, adding about three tablespoons of lemon zest, and reducing the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Taking the suggestion of another reviewer, I sprinkled brown sugar and choppped pecans in the pan before filling it with batter.  Baked (without pre-heating the oven) for seventy-five minutes (splitting the difference between the suggested bake times).  The resulting cake is really good; it came out of my (silicone) bundt pan cleanly and easily, although I did notice a very slight underdone swirl through the lower register of the cake -- maybe I should have kept it in the oven a bit longer.  Thanks, Diane, for a great foundation for a really very good cake!!

A beautiful pound cake. I have made it several times. Received plenty of compliments and requests for the recipe. The recipe actually makes 2 cakes not one.

After reading the other reviews and comparing this recipe to another i've used recently, i changed a couple of things, and it turned out great!  First, i eliminated the baking powder.  This eliminated the overflow problem and gave it a definite pound cake texture.  Also, i used 2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for a little twist.

It was delicious!  A perfect stand-by bundt cake recipe that can easily be slightly altered to accommodate different flavors.

Success!  Instead of filling my bundt pan completely, I spooned some off into a small loaf pan and did not have trouble with spillover.  Cooked in exactly 60 min (but should have taken out the small loaf sooner).  For glaze I mixed 1c powdered sugar and 2 TBS milk and splash of vanilla to drizzle consistency.  Served with berries and cool whip but it is delicious on its own.  Can't wait to upload a picture!

I've made this twice and everyone loved it.  Even relatives who are not "cake" eaters enjoyed it.  Moist, not too sweet!  I sifted powdered sugar on top!

I haven't been baking for a few years and am just getting back into it.  It was great to start with a wonderful success!  This cake turned out just perfectly.  Nice and moist, not too sweet.  Had 4 oz. of cream cheese to use up so whipped that with 1/3 c. confectioner's sugar and 1/4 c. o.j. for drizzling over.  I'm back in the saddle again!

Not at all pleased with this cake.  It is not a pound cake.  What you get when you make this is basic yellow cake.  It tastes fine and I wouldn't hesitate to use this for a birthday cake but it's too light and airy to be a pound cake.  I thought with 6 eggs in the batter that it must be a heavy, dense, rich cake.  It's nothing like that and I don't think I'll be making this again.  Thanks.

No overflow at all.  I guess after reading the reviews I placed aluminum foil on the second shelf second there was no overflow the first time I attempted to make this cake half of the cake flow over on to the stove that was because I preheated the oven.  the second attempt was also a failure.  I used 3 cups of sugar instead of two and a half.   However the taste of the cake was so good I couldn't let it defeat me this time it came out perfect.   This is my pound cake for forever. I use to make the 7 up cake but this one has more flavor I've never tasted a cake that you can actually taste the butter.  My recipe for life.

Excellent recipe - followed it all the way through using the tips of how to make a pound cake found under articles.  Cooked for about 65 minutes middle rack and came out wonderful.  Would like to expirement with leaving out baking soda to get a more dense cake.  Regardless this is a delicious cake!

This cake is amazing! With a very crunchy exterior, this cake has one of the softest textures i have ever tasted in a cake. I split the recipe in 1/2 and baked in a 9x6 loaf pan for 45min. My cake didnt overflow and rose to a perfect size, despite my beating air into it with my electric mixer(i think the air fluffed it up more). Instead of a sauce or frosting, i just sprinkled approx. 1 tbsp of sugar on top, which made a delicious crunchy topping. I also coated the pan with sprinkles of sugar after greasing it, which gives the cake a beautiful glaze. This is now my base recipe for a delicious & easy pound cake. Thank you Diane!

I have eaten my share of pound cakes, made by older relatives. This one was one of the best. My mom thought that I had been to see Aunt Catherine. After reading all of the reviews, I decided to put the batter into 2 bundt pans, and I am glad I did. Both rose to the top, but didn't run over. I will be making this one again, and will try different extracts, other than vanilla. Very, very good.

This pound cake is delicious, very moist, and reminds me of being a kid in south Georgia with my nanny in the kitchen pulling out a big pound cake from the oven and placing it on the window to cool.

This was my first attempt at baking any kind of cake from scratch, and it was delicious!!  I halved the ingredients to make a kind of "short, mini" bundt cake and it only needed 30 min. to bake.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I'm so proud:)

This was a great cake! I took the suggestions made by others and divided the batter in two pans! 
I also cut the sugar by half a cup.

Turned out great! Thanks!

This recipe sounded good and simple, so I tried it...  It was really delicious and super simple.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, but did pour a portion of the batter in a small bread loaf pan.  Everyone mentioned that it overflowed so I decided not to waste the extra.  It worked great.  Be sure to grease and flour the extra pan for easy removal.  The cake is very flavorful and needs only a good glaze. I used the one mentioned with extra lemon juice.  Made it last night and we finished the last of the cake this morning with coffee.  Delicious!!

The taste of this cake was good but the texture was not like a pound cake. If i was going to make this cake again, i would bake it at 300 degrees because the top and outside was nearly burnt but the middle of the cake wasnt close to being ready.

This was my first time using a recipe from an online source. I have to say that I was happy with the outcome the cake tastes very good. I used two loaf pans with it and it worked out very well.I also added extra vanilla extract.
Happy baking everyone.

Thanks for the delicious, yet simple, recipe. It was a real hit with my family. Yes, it rises very high, but mine did not overflow. I will definitely make again!

Terrific! I got a Festival bundt pan for Christmas and used this recipe for it. I didn't have milk the first time so used up some heavy cream I had in fridge. Yummy! This is a great recipe to use when my hens have been so generous. I serve this with strawberries, or raspberries. Forget calories, enjoy the cake!

I just made this cake tonight and it tastes DELICIOUS! It's light and moist, and rose
to the very top of my bundt pan.  The only complaint I have is the amount of fat and
calories--there's enough fat and cholesteral to kill a rhino ;-)

I made it for my granddaughter's birthday.  I took two cups of batter and added 4T cocoa powder.  I marbled it.   I baked it in a 10-cup heart-shaped bundt pan at 350 degrees for about an hour.  This recipe makes a lot of batter. Like others, I protected the oven with a sheet pan.  I had to "coax" it out of the pan, but to my surprise, it came out just fine.  I topped it with chocolate ganache.  I am definitely making it again!

Chose this recipe after discovering I have a bunch of eggs to use up.  Ended up modifying it for my preference and based on other reviews.  I cut the recipe in half and omitted the baking powder which gave me a single, dense loaf that turned out perfectly.  I used 3/4 cup white granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar which gave the crust a light crisp and great brown sugar flavor.  I also used half a teaspoon vanilla extract and half teaspoon almond extract with a splash of maraschino cherry syrup for an amaretto flavor.  I lowered the baking temperature to 325 as I was using a glass loaf pan and wanted to lower the chance of anything burning.  It came out perfectly golden and delicious after 90 minutes.  This is a great recipe to use as a base and was very easy for someone who had never made pound cake before.

This recipe turned out great if you're looking for that light fluffy pound cake. That is what my results were. I'm still on the search for that heavy old school pound cake recipe. I'm n Colorado and because of that we r suppose to add an extra egg. I did not do that n the cake fail n the middle. Nevertheless it still surprise lay light n fluffy and good tasting might I add.

This recipe was almost perfect for my purposes. I only had a 9x13 cake pan (silly, I know) so I was looking for something that would really fill up the pan and this was absolutely it. It was done in 60 minutes and was suprisingly browner than I wanted it. The taste was great but it was just darker than I was expecting. It was definitely a lot lighter than most pound cakes and it actually took a couple of bites for me to register that signature 'pound cake' texture. I served it both plain and drizzled with lemon sauce. It was great both ways.

I made this for 8 servings and it fit perfectly in a bundt pan.  It was good, but better the next day, after stored on a covered cake stand.  I served it with strawberry sauce and it was a nice dessert.  Not spectacular, lighter than most pound cakes I"m used to, but it was good.

I couldn't find an orange pound cake, so I've made the following changes to this recipe:
- I've reduced sugar to 2 1/4 cups;
- I've increased vanilla to 2 tsp;
- I've reduced (boiled down) 1/2 cup of O.J. to 1/4 cup and used it instead of 1/4 cup of milk.
- I've used 1/2 cup of milk;
- I've added grated zest of one orange.
I also baked it at 325F for 80 minutes.  It turned out very well, with a nice (however mild) orange flavour.  We had some friends over for tea and they loved the cake, having seconds and thirds.  Everyone's favourite part was the golden crunchy crust.  This cake is not going to become a kind of recipe I would make over and over, but I will make it again for Easter.

Delicious! I had no difficulty in over flow as I changed the servings from 12 to 10. It still produced a tall and fat bundt cake. Excellent flavor when I added a lemon glaze while the cake was hot so it would be absorbed. Thank you!

This recipe was wonderful.  It was very light and fluffy and moist. I don't know why others think it was too heavy unless they don't know what pound cake should be like.  This cake was much lighter than most pound cakes and yummy rich!

Excellent but many of the reviews said this would make two bundt cakes, so I made two bundt cakes.  It was well done at 60 minutes. It's kind of crunchy :(

This cake is fabulous. I made the recipe as written and used a 10" tube pan. I did substitute Watkins Hazelnut Flavoring for the vanilla. I ate the last piece after a week and it was still delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe. I look forward to using it for strawberry shortcake. Update: This cake freezes beautifully. The taste and texture loses nothing and is still wonderful and fresh.

This is a great pound cake recipe and changing the serving to 8 is perfect for a loaf pan. If you have a larger pan then you can keep the servings the same.

Very good pound cake.  I made it in two loaf pans, it rose quite a bit, but didn't overflow.  I also made whipped cream to go with it...very good!

This is a great cake! It is nice and moist, not as heavy as many pound cakes. I baked it in a tube pan and had no problems with overflow. It took 70 minutes in my oven. I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for a group and everyone loved it! I served it with fresh, sweetened strawberries and ice cream, but it was delicious by itself. I read the other reviews and baked it in two pans, one large tube pan and a loaf pan, to make sure it didn't overflow. This was not needed - it would have done fine in just the tube pan.

I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup of the white sugar. I think this added a nice flavor. I did place a cookie sheet underneath and was glad I did as I had some liquid leak through the bottom of my pan. Overall, this is a great recipe that I will use again.

I follow the recipes as it is except for the Milk, I modified this recipe into a strawberry chocolate chip cake..instead of milk I used strawberry smoothie, add 1 cup of fresh strawberry cut into small pieces/chunks...and 1/2 cup chocolate chip, red food coloring to make it pink...it's so moist...definitely a keeper. It did leave a behive shape of cake on the baking sheet though...good for tester :)

Delicious!  Going by other reviews, I baked on a cookie sheet for 90 min. at 325.  It was perfect.

Good Recipe, the cake turned out pretty good.  It was nice and soft. I used two pans like the others suggested and it was the perfect size because the cake did rise quite a bit.  I decreased the sugar because my family doesn't like it too sweet and it turned out nice.

well it tastes ok but it should really not be baked in only one pan.They say it rises high but yet tell you to putt in in a bundt pan.  The cake overflowed onto everything which means i now have a mess to clean up. It would be better if you make a bundt and a loaf or something that gives you more than one cake.

I made this cake tonight and although it was good it didn't come close to any pound cake that I have ever had. (reason for 3 stars) It was more like a basic yellow cake. I will use this recipe again but not as a pound cake recipe.

Delicious! Did not overflow. I used a large tube pan. I used 1.5 teaspoons lemon extract and the zest of 1 orange to give it a citrus flavor, instead of vanilla.  I poked it with a skewer and while still warm, poured a lemon glaze on top and into the holes. Buttery, with a crusty sugar top, and moist and gooey where the glaze soaked in. My new favorite!

I make cakes all the time....this pound cake was a total flop...I baked as directed and checked it at 60 minutes....took it out of the oven and put on a rack to cool....after it cooled I put it on a cake plate and half the cake fell apart...the cake is dry and tasteless....a real disappointment as I made it for company this weekend.....not sure what happened....as I said,  I'm a pretty good baker.  Perhaps 60 minutes was too long....

Excellent recipe and versatile as to what you want to add to it - chocolate chips, frosting, etc.  I will make this many times.  These simple ingredients are always in my house.  Also, I did not have any issues with it flowing over in the oven.

I just finished making this. I split the batter  between 6 small paper loaves to give away as Christmas presents. I used eggnog instead of milk. I have baked a lot of cakes and have eaten even more in my 51 years on this earth but I have never had one so tender and tasty or with a finer crumb. A keeper! I will experiment with different flavors.

I don't change recipes I rate. Made this delicious pound cake as written and wouldn't change a thing. It was absolutely fabulous. Couldn't ask for a better, more moist, and scrumptious  dessert. I did top it with the "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze," recipe found here on allrecipes; which was equally as good. Together, they make an amazing cake. My family couldn't get enough. Thank you for sharing.

This my first pound cake. I didnt change anything on the recipe. It made two bread loaves, beautifully brown, crisp as round the edge, light tasting for a fairly dense cake. Only needed to bake for 70 minutes in my oven at 325. I was impressed as were my friends who received a loaf also. Will definently be making again

I was riding my bike home from the grocery store, when I saw a huge bump too late. CRACK went six eggs in their carton. I got home and looked for a recipe using six eggs. I am so glad I found this one!
After reading some reviews, I made the following revisions:
1 3/4 c white sugar, 1/2 cup brown for a less purely sweet taste.
In place of milk I used a light (not too thick) yogurt, which helped keep the cake nice and dense.
I used a rectangular baking dish so I wouldn’t flood my tiny oven. I had spare batter for 10 cup-poundcakes. 
Chocolate chips on top for cuteness!

Great way to help use all those extra eggs! Always a crowd pleaser. Nice and moist. I generally use my lg bundt pan that I use for angle food cakes and it holds the full amount. I typically put a cookie sheet on the rack below the cake just in case anything goes over the top or leaks through the cracks on the 2-part bundt pan.

I will be making this pound cake for the 6th time today. After reading the reviews the first time baking it I purchased a heavy duty deeper pound cake pan from Amazon. The only thing I changed 3 of the times was using lemon extract instead of vanilla. One of my older recipes used the lemon which everyone loved but was not as good as this recipe !  Never too old to make changes. The pan purchased was a tube pan described special for pound cakes.

This pound cake is golden brown  mild glaze buttery goodness.  I only added  2 teaspoons of baking powder and I used a 10 inch bundt cake pan. Also when I pour the batter in you have to take a flat small spatula and flatten the batter lightly in a circle so it bakes and rise evenly. I also left a 1/2 inch of space in the bundt pan when I poured the batter so the cake have room to rise and will not overflow. I topped mine with whip cream preferably lite whip cream because it's not sweet and strawberries.

This pound cake turned out beautifully! I followed the recipe as is (with the exception of adding some lemon zest to the batter), and it baked up perfectly - no spill over whatsoever :) It took around 65 mins (give or take), which gave the top a nice crispy crust.  At first, I thought it would be too sweet with the 2 1/2 cups of sugar, but it was just right. This is first pound cake recipe I've found that didn't include complicated directions or ingredients that I don't usually have on hand (ie. sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt), and I'll make it again and again. Thanks for posting the recipe :)

Make this cake using exact measurements, electric mixer  and a 10-inch Bundt cake pan.  Baked it for 55 minutes., since it didn't look done at 50. Cake was a little stiff for my taste but decent enough. I add pudding  next time for moistness.

I made this twice on the same day and it rises great and tastes brilliant.  Just don't use it in a bundt tin as it is too sticky.  I couldn't get it out the pan.  I would give it a one star rating because of that, but it does taste amazing.

I have had better! But as a begginer this cake is by far the easiest homemade recipe. This definitely can be made by hand, and not messy at all. It does make about two cakes. Overall this cake was decent!

I haven't baked a cake for a couple of years and have a glut of eggs to use up, so I wanted something idiot-proof. Well, this cake certainly turned out well! As other people have mentioned, this makes a lot of batter. I ended up using the largest cake pan I have, which is big enough for a large birthday cake and the cake took one and a quarter hours to cook. I used lemon essence instead of vanilla and glazed it with runny lemon icing after piercing the cake a few times first. I've had many compliments. I will absolutely be making this again.

I used 2 tsp Vanilla extract and 2 tsp of butter flavoring.  We have not tried it yet, have to wait till tomorrow, Turkey Day ya know.  It baked lovely. I had my oven set to 300, as it cooks WAY hotter than it should, and 350 would have been to hot. I would have done 325 in a normal oven. I remember the first pound cake I made called for putting the cake in a cold oven, and start it off at 350, then 15 mins later turn it down to 325 for 90 mins.

My 16-year-old daughter made this without any problems. She was careful not to over beat the eggs so that there wouldn't be too much air in them. She also put a cookie sheet one rack under the cake pan in case it overflowed, but it didn't. It made one perfect Bundt cake. We opted not to add any glaze as it was sweet enough on its own. Very tasty and will make again!

I made this with gluten free flour and it turned out great! I also halved the recipe and cooked it in a bread pan because I didn't need a large cake. It did overflow a little bit. I didn't know if it would rise much with the gluten free flour but it did. I think next time I will split between 2 pans or just not use it all. It was SO delicious!!

I use this as my base recipe. I substituted lemon extract for the vanilla,  added 1/2 fresh lemon juice, & blueberry compote. Omg good! 

Sometimes I sub vanilla for almond also and fresh orange juice. 
 
Does make more than a standard bundt cake or dome cake pan can hold. You can split it into 1 LG and 1 small pan.

I've made this twice.  It is delicious and goes beautifully with strawberries and whipped cream.  The second time I made it, it did rise over a top a bit - but that was not a big deal.  Not too sweet.  It is a keeper

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, which I do recommend if you like a little spice.....I decided to attempt a Nutella swirl and I don't know if it failed because of the bundt pan (the recipe I was using called for a tube pan), or if it had to do with the two extra eggs, but the Nutella was so much denser than the batter that it all sank to the bottom of the pan and stuck to it even though I greased and floured it. NOT what I intended. It tasted amazing, but it wasn't very pretty. Oh well. Next time I will just follow this recipe but still add the cinnamon.

I decided to make this cake for my dad. He likes a moist cake with his coffee. I added orange rind and two teaspoons of orange extract to this recipe. The result was a super moist and fragrant cake. The second time I made it I added 1 1/2 cups of  ground hazelnuts for a moist nutty cake. This recipe is very flexible. I recommend it when time  is of the essence and the ingredients list is short. Enjoy....

I had some instant strawberry pudding in the pantry I'd been meaning to use and was looking for a recipe for a scratch made cake I could add it to. Found this recipe and followed the recipe except for a couple changes. I divided the batter and added the pudding mix to half. Then I just poured regular batter in first followed by the strawberry pudding batter next. I swirled it in the bundt pan and baked it at 325° for 80 minutes(checking my batter at 60 minutes and continuing to bake in 10 minute intervals until done) The cake came out perfectly moist and dense. I might cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups next time if using pudding mixes. But overall, very easy and tasty!

This recipe was great! I took the advice about not using an electric mixer and mixing everything by hand and I kept my cake from overflowing while baking. I also used 2 tsp instead of 1 1/2 because my family has a sweet tooth. I will definitely be making this again!

comparing all the pound cakes ive tried so far this was the driest one ever! it does not melt in the mouth like other cakes do.try melting the butter using warm milk until the dough becomes more smoother and easily can pour into the cooking pan!

This was the best pound cake that I have made in a long time, however, the batter was too much for one bundt pan so I also made a small loave, each has a different glaze.

Very nice. Used a large tube pan and baked it at 325 for 60 minutes. As far as pound cakes go, this one is moist and lighter than most. Thanks.
