Hubby loves these kinds of foods and really liked this one.  Wasn't too crazy about the onions but I will make this for him again and leave them out.  I used parmesan instead of cheddar just as a personal preference.

I used this as a guide. I had left over deer cube steaks and needed to use it up. While reheating meat I added the Italian season and the  pearl onions simmered  until onions became soft. Then added a 1/2  can dice tomatoes season with onion and garlic then 10 mins later added 3/4 c Chunky spaghetti sauce simmered until warm (all while adding garlic paper salt garlic and onion powder) added birds eyes steam corn and cooked down.. Covered and Let it sit for hr.  boiled elbow macaroni for 8 mins, drained.  Reheated  meat mixture on low heat. Threw macaroni rest of Spaghetti sauce, diced tomatoes and meat together in large pot and summer low for another 15 mins ..(stirring constantly ) turned off.. Let it sit with top shredded mozzarella.. Kids loved it. Ages 4-8-9.. My husband and I thought it was ok.. Definitely a kid friendly  meal:-)

Itâ€™s okay. Needs a lot of customization to make it flavorful. I turned it into a chili Mac and it was pretty good.

It was really good. I added garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper. The kids loved it.
