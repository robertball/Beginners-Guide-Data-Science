Went to 3 stores and couldn't find Habanero Heat Shredded Cheese, so I sub'd 4-Cheese Mexican Blend and added a chopped jalapeño.  I used Simply Potatoes Hash Browns (in the dairy section, not frozen) and Egg Beaters instead of eggs to reduce the cholesterol and fat, and this worked fine.  Garnished with salsa and sour cream this is a nice brunch/breakfast dish, but predominantly it's a shredded potato casserole.  My husband said he thought this would be good for dinner with a grilled smoked pork chop.  Whatever, we liked it!

This is a great recipe - makes a good burrito filling also. I enjoy making this on Sunday mornings and then packing leftovers to take to work for breakfast throughout the week. I use a random combo of veggies but use this recipe as a guide. I add green chilies as well and always just use whatever cheddar I have. I never buy frozen hash browns - I just peel and grate russets (& sometimes sweet potatoes) and that works fine. I add some cheese to be baked with but I put the majority of the cheese on top when there’s like 10mins remaining so that it’s melty. Putting it on for the whole time makes it too stiff for my liking.

This was delicious! I just added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Crowd pleaser for sure.
