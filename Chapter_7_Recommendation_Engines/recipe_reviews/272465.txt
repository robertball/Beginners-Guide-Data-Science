I love stuffed shells, but was not crazy about the cottage cheese. It made for a slightly soupy stuffed shell bake. Maybe all ricotta would be better. Additionally if you’re going to add onion and garlic it would be smarter to sauté them first. Also as much as I love garlic, the quantity used was overwhelming.

Not spicy enough for me despite adding chilli pepper flakes. There was way too much cheese filling for the small size of the pasta shells so I just tucked it all in around the shells.

I would reduce the amount of nutmeg  and I added another egg.
