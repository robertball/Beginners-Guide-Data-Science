So simple. I used yellow, orange and red peppers as well as a little bit of green pepper. I also added celery and ground pepper. Not having to blanch the cauliflower was a bonus. I let it sit in the fridge covered overnight and it was just the right crunch with beautifully melded flavours the next day.

This was an interesting combination of ingredients! It worked out well though. Next time I would blanch the cauliflower to add a better texture and add the taco seasoning for more flavor. Definitely would make a nice addition to a summer menu!

I added shredded cheese as well.
