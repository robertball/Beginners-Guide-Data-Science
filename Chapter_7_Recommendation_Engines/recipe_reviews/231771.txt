This was really good!  We had bought a cheeseburger pizza from a local pizza shop awhile back and liked it.  I did a search and found this recipe.  It was very similar to the pizza we had bought so I expected it to taste a little different.  I made a few adjustments--used 1 lb. of meat and less pickles (sprinkled them on top before baking like the pizza shop had done).  Thanks for the recipe!

What do you make when you're short on time and need to make dinner in a hurry? This would be it! It's basically a hybrid of two all time favorites pizza and cheeseburgers- what could be easier or better, right? I added a little garlic to the ground beef and sauteed the onion along with it. I used all reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese (about a cup and a half) and left out the mozzarella altogether. I definitely added the optional shredded lettuce and chopped tomato along with the dill pickle slices. And, while I have to admit that while I love pizza and I love cheeseburgers I think I'll stick to them separately. (Even though my husband loved it) This a really good recipe for a quick meal!

Used my own pizza dough, we grilled them on the gas grill, since too hot for the oven. Everybody said, "It taste just like a cheeseburger"...must have been good because four of us ate the whole two pizzas. Fun meal, thanks.

It worked so well.  I did add some steak seasoning to the meat while cooking, to give it a bit more flavour, and I used my own homemade dough instead of a bought crust.  I would have never thought of using a ketchup and mustard mix as  the sauce,something so simple but it really pulled it together.  I am so making this again.

We loved this!!!  We followed the directions exactly, except we added bacon as well.  The only thing we would change is to split up the cheese and put part under the meat/onion combo and part on top.  Will definitely make often!

Awesome. Made my own dough and added onion soup mix to ground beef, which is how I like my burgers. This will be a go to pizza recipe for me!

This is the first "hit" for a google search on Papa John's Cheeseburger pizza recipe.  If you're looking for that...keep looking because this is not it.

I've had PJ's Cheesburger Pizza every time they offer it...many times over.  And I don't even have to try to recipe to know the sauce is NOT simply a ketchup and mustard blend (actually sounds horrible on a pizza).  I can tell you by tasting it PJ's pizza, there is very little, if ANY mustard on the pizza.

Doubtful that PJ's sauce will be duplicated, unless we have insider help!

So good! I made a few alterations which shouldn't change the final product much. I made my own crust. I prefer to layer meat , then toppings, and (a little less) cheese last.  Most importantly, add crisped bacon and pickle slices (dried on a paper towel to prevent oozing) then bake. Yep, bake the pickles right on there! I also prebake my crust 5 minutes , load it up, and bake for another 10 minutes at 425.

A quick, easy, delicious meal I made for supper lastnight. I loved it! Husband liked it too, but thought it was too "mustardy". I thought the sauce was perfect! I made my own dough also. Thanks for the recipe....I'm definately putting this in my "yummy" recipe collection!

This was great! We loved it. My husband even texted our neighbor & told him to come over & have a piece because he wanted him to try it. He loved it too. I'll definitely make it again, maybe I'll  add bacon next time.  After cooking I topped it with chopped tomato & pickles. I skipped the lettuce because I didn't have any. Quick & easy to make.

Very good recipe.  I skipped the mozzarella just to cut calories down some and used Three cheese cheddar but other than that I stuck to the recipe with some lean grass-fed beef. And yes... it tastes just like a cheese burger. Thanks for the recipe.  :)

AMAZING!! Used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free crust mix.  I cooked the onions in with the meat to "hide" them from my 4 year old.  My family (husband, 4yr old, 10 month old, my brother, my parents) all RAVED about it!!  I will absolutely make this again!!!  Thank you!

Like most other reviewers, I used homemade pizza crust (cooked at the right temp for the recipe I used) but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The ketchup/mustard sauce was not sufficient when mixed with the ground beef, resulting in a kind of dry pizza.  The concept is good, especially for those feeding kids.  But for our tastes, the ketchup/mustard sauce was way too sweet. I would make again when the nephews come over but otherwise, will keep looking for different cheeseburger pizza recipe.

I took some liberty with this recipe, but the end result was really, really good.  I used my own homemade crust and I used homemade sauce in lieu of the mustard and catsup.  I also added cooked crumbled bacon to make it a bacon cheeseburger pizza!  Yum!  The dill pickles and the addition of bacon takes this pizza over the top in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, JILLENA!

Wow, tastes just like a cheeseburger.  I used thawed frozen mini-meatballs and cut them in thirds to replace crumbled meat.  I cooked it on the grill and it was wonderful.

Making this today, (doubled) with homemade whole wheat dough. Making one as directed in recipe except for adding crumbled crispy bacon and minus the pickles. The second will be with Animal Sauce ala 'In-n-Out' burger as the sauce and adding bacon, onions and mushrooms to the toppings. For the cheese I'm using Colby-Jack on both pizzas. Can hardly wait til they are done.

This tasted better than I expected. The Hubs and I enjoyed it very much. I just couldn't imagine a mixture of ketchup and mustard would make a good pizza sauce. I used a pizza dough recipe from Allrecipes ( sorry don't remember which one) and everything turned out delightfully well. We will make this one again. Thanks for sharing so others can savor the flavors!

This is delicious pizza. I made my own crust and added a bit of mayo after reading the reviews. I'm so glad the recipe included the pickles because I probably wouldn't have thought of that.

Really enjoyed it! Made a quick homemade crust from this site. Sauce was a little strong... maybe a touch too much mustard for my taste but still really enjoyed it! Did not put lettuce or tomatoes on.

This was really tasty! I did a few additions - mayo in the ketchup/mustard sauce, seasoned the meat and added a bit of barbecue sauce when it browned. We used double cheddar blend cheese and no mozzarella. Really tasted like a cheeseburger! The whole family enjoyed this.
