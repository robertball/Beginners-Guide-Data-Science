It's excellent although I used less sugar. It's a keeper. Thanks venymae and Dad.

Pretty good. The only reason for four stars (rather than five) is because I made a number of changes mostly out of necessity. First I cut the sugar down to a half-cup. I substituted cider vinegar for the distilled white (had no distilled white vinegar on hand) lime juice for the lemon juice (I had limes but no lemons in the house) and minced fresh onion for the dehydrated onion (you got it...what I had on hand). Nice tart/sweet dressing. May become a staple in my house! Maybe next time I'll even follow the recipe!Thanks

This was sooooo good. I have been looking for an alternative to the bottled dressings in the store for my Taco salad and this met all the flavors i was looking for. It is a little sweet and i did use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda. I think next time i will use straight sugar because for my needs it just compliments all the flavors of my taco salad so well. It cuts through the richness of the cheeses and the ground beef. Its just different enough from the store brands but still remains familiar enough to put on a classic salad.

Yummy! I made no changes. The ketchup flavor is a little strong at first but mellows out after it sits for just a little bit.
