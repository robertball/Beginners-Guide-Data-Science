Very Moist and great taste with no added fat (i.e.butter/oil) - wow ! I just had to rate this recipe after trying it so that everyone else would try it too ! I made 48 mini muffins out of this recipe (cooking time 13 min) and they turned out wonderfully. Modifications were: I put in two whole eggs instead of separating, used normal organic whole wheat flour, cut out the allspice, used only 1/2 cup maple syrup (the real stuff). I froze them and put them in lunches for my little girl and husband - they both love them - and I do too.

Wow!  I'm always looking for nutritious, low fat, low sugar recipes for breakfast and snacks, and this is one of the best!  I made the following changes, only out of necessity, because I think this recipe is perfect by itself:
--added an extra banana (it was going to spoil soon)
--decreased syrup to 3/4 cup (used sugar free syrup, because it's all I had)
--decreased sugar to 1/4 cup
--didn't have nutmeg, allspice or cloves, so I just added extra ginger and cinnamon.
I poured the batter into a 6-muffin pan and a square baking pan, and baked the muffins for 20 minutes, and the square pan for 30 minutes.  Silicon baking pans are great for this--don't have to grease anything, and they come out so easily!
---Update---I made these again the same way, except I added the cloves and nutmeg this time and tried decreasing the syrup to 1/2 cup, and discovered that I prefer using only ginger and cinnamon, and that 3/4 cup syrup is needed to make it sweet enough.

This bread is absolutely delicious!
I followed the recipe exactly, and found the results to be terrific.
A healthier version of the classic zucchini bread, but fantastic in it's own right.
A very nice combination of spices...even my picky boyfriend thought that it was great :)
Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  I used old fashioned oat meal and processed it to a fine powder instead of the bran and cut the syrup down more than 1/2 and added more pumpkin.  I added chopped pecans too.

Delicious recipe! I used sugar free syrup instead of regular. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The final product is very moist, yummy, and nutritious.

Very nice recipe.  Made some substitutions just based on what I had on hand - squash instead of pumpkin, 2 whole eggs instead of 1 whole and 2 whites, 1/4 cup maple sugar (ran out) and 1/4 cup honey instead of 1 cup maple syrup, 1/3 brown sugar instead of raw, didn't measure the zucchini - just used two I had on hand, regular whole wheat flour.  Could be slightly sweeter than I made it but was still nice.

I used 2 bananas instead of the pumpkin as I only had a large can and didn't want to waste the rest. I also used 1/2 cup lite syrup and 1/8 cup sugar and an 1/8 cup splenda (I don't taste the splenda if I use this little bit). I also used quick oats instead of bran simply because I had them. I didn't process them as someone else did but would next time. I also added 1/4 cup water. All in all, they are OK. I cooked for 30 minutes and it was too long. Not bad, but they taste healthy.

Delicious!  I made a few substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but it seems to be a robust recipe that can take a fair amount of fiddling and still turn out well.  Oh, and taking the suggestions of others here, I did cut down on both the sugar and maple syrup by quite a bit.  Maple syrup is expensive and half the amount called for works just fine if you add in a little more liquid elsewhere.

These were moist and very flavorful. I used All-Bran, wheat germ, and flax meal. I had to add a little bit milk b/c that made it a bit thick. I put some chopped nuts on top. This was a perfect recipe to help me use up a lot of my zucchini and that banana that has been on the counter for a while. Great for breakfast or a healthy snack. These are really good for you!

This recipe is amazing. My house smells so good. My kids even ate it and they hate anything whole wheat. I felt like I was indulging and scarfed 2 pieces down. I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I used regular whole wheat. I didn't have enough maple syrup so I used 1/4 cup maple and 3/4 honey. I also added 1 cup of pecans to the batter. This recipe is a keeper!

Fantastic whole grain bread. My husband, who I had to force to even try this bread once he saw the "green stuff!" wouldn't stop eating it! He cleaned the whole kitchen and even mopped the floor so that I would make more! HAHA! Thank you for the recipe. It's perfect.

Outstanding recipe--moist, flavorful, and amazingly without any oil or butter!  Admittedly I did change a few things and I usually don't review recipes that I've tweaked (because you're no longer reviewing the posted recipe!), but I did want to share the changes I made since they worked so well.  First, I had no pumpkin so I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead.  Two whole eggs instead of the one whole and 2 whites (laziness on my part), and instead of the maple syrup and sugar I just used 3/4 cup brown sugar, which was plenty sweet for my taste.  I also threw in a ripe pear that I had to use up, and that probably helped the moistness too.  I could easily see adding apples, carrots, whatever to this. I didn't have cloves or allspice so I left those out and it had plenty of flavor.  Lastly, I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.   Ok so maybe my version isn't at all like the posted recipe but it sure was good! I chopped the zucchini in the food processor, then took it out and mixed the rest of the wet ingredients in there (including the pear), and then poured the wet into the bowl of dry ingredients, then stirred in the zucchini and walnuts by hand. That was an easy way to do it. A few other thoughts: I could easily see doubling the amount of zucchini as it seemed a little light on that but if you are trying to sneak it in for your kids or hubby then leave it at 2 cups. And I think I will try this as a muffins because the edges were definitely the best part!

My husband eats a bran muffin every morning and I thought this recipe would be a nice change.  He loved it!  I substituted 1/4 c of applesauce instead of pumpkin and added 1 more mashed banana , 1 c of raisins and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was very moist and dense.

This recipe came out great!  I made it into muffins, instead of the squares and baked it for about 18 minutes.  The muffin stuck to the paper liner initially, but after a night in a ziploc bag the liners peeled right off!  I used regular whole wheat flour instead of pastry flour, and ommitted the allspice (because I didn't have any!)  I also used probably about 3/4 cup of pure maple syrup, and a little less than the recommended amount of brown sugar, because I ran out of both.

This is tasty and moist. It does have a different texture (from the bran). The pumpkin flavor isn't really noticable, but the banana really comes through. This is more of a cake than a bread since it isn't baked in a loaf pan. Min required less baking time than stated - about 45 minutes.

I really changed it up. I used spelt flour, 1/4 teaspoon pure stevia, 2 bananas 1/3 cup agave, 1/4 cup applesauce. 
I am munching on it now. Very healthy and very good

YUM! I didn't bake this quite the full amount because it was browning quickly, and it was plenty done. I probably baked it 40 minutes. I also (hanging head in shame) used white flour because I was out of wheat. But it was a wonderful texture and I'm sure will be marvelous next time when I use wheat flour. I also used wheat germ instead of wheat bran. I'm sure this will be a family favorite!

This was not too good. I couldn't taste any banana, zucchini or spices, all I could taste was excessive sweeteness, and I cut out the sugar entirely. It also came out globby and doughy on the inside but burnt on the outside. The batter looked and smelled great, but the bread was a flop. I was really disappointed with this. Don't try it.

I followed this recipe to the letter -- and did NOT get a "frothy" batter.  It was more like a bread dough.  Was an ingredient left out? -- like hot water?
I appreciate the effort, and was enthused by the ingredients ... but, am a bit puzzled that others had no problems with the "frothy batter."  :(

Delicious and healthy! I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour so I used half pastry flour and half whole wheat all purpose flour. Alike other reviews I used 2 whole eggs and decreased the maple syrup to 3/4 cup. I topped it with crushed walnut pieces, ~1/4 cup, which added a great crunch but also looked great presentation wise.

Excellent, dense, high fiber, low sugar, relatively fat free and DELICIOUS!  Substitutions I made by necessity were:  2 c bananas, 1 c zucchini, no pumpkin.  By choice 3/4 c maple syrup, 3 Tbsp coconut sugar,  2 whole eggs, 20% coconut flour, 2/3 c chopped walnuts, extra spice.  This is incredibly moist and delicious.  Far healthier than your routine banana bread.  I did large muffins and baked for 35 min.  at 350'.   It made 10.

This is a fantastic recipe that is easily adaptable and I'm very happy with it. Will definitely be trying this one again.
My edits are as follows:
Applesauce in place of all the pumpkin and half of the maple syrup (total = 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce)
cut the maple syrup to 1/2 cup (see above)
I grated two medium zucchini and ended up with closer to 3 cups than 2. worked perfectly with above modifications.
For the flour I used what I had - a mix of whole wheat flour, oat bran flour and almond meal. 
I only had whole cloves so I used my coffee grinder (after cleaning of course) to grind them myself.  Ended up with a little too much so this bread is on the spicy side but its delish! Bonus - extra yummy coffee coming up this weekend ;)
Lastly, I split this between a 6-cup muffin tin and a 9x5 loaf pan. So I got muffins and bread. Nice!
Next time I will try not to forget the golden raisins and walnuts and will add some grated carrot in addition to the zucchini.

I cut back on the maple syrup, but the family loved the bread.
