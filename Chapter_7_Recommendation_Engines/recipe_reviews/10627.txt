Cool variation on the ordinary chocolate chip cookie.  The kids love them!  You could use M&M minis too.  Next time I make them, though, I will use one LESS cup of rice krispie.

I found that using the rice krispies instead of the nuts added a whole extra dimension to the chocolate chip cookie. These were really a hit for my whole workplace.

Cookies are very easy and tasty.  They seemed to take a bit longer to get done then stated.  If it's a real crispy cookie your looking for, then look no further!

Tasty! The Rice Krispy's make them 'chewy' but we liked the new twist to a good cookie.

The krispies are a bit difficult to work in to the batter completely and they get a little chewy even in an airtight container, but overall pretty good.

These were interesting but not a huge hit at our house or with friends we shared with.  I think everyone has a certain way they like chocolate chip cookies and these were lacking a bit for our tastes.

A little too dry & crispy, my family prefers a softer cookie.
