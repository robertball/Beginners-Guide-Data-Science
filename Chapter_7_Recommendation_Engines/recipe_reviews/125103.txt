I love homemade granola and is this is right up there witht the rest! I made a few minor changes though....instead of sesame seeds, I used flax seeds, chopped pecans instead of almonds, I used a healthy tablespoon of Kelly's Pumpkin Pie Seasoning from this site instead of the just cinnamon in the granola recipe, reduced the oil to 1/4c. and added dried cranberries at the end. So very good!

I was going to give it only 4 stars, as it isn't very sweet at all, but I've changed my mind -- it's perfect. I left out the fruit so that it would be more versatile -- I can always add fruit later by the serving. I plan to use this to top applesauce, to top yogurt, to top ice cream, and most especially to eat with milk for breakfast in the mornings. I did cook mine longer than stated but I like mine darker than most. Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good for the most part. I love granola and would give it 5 stars by itself. This recipe was good, don't get me wrong. So whoever made this recipe, you did great! Please make more recipes!

So so good!  I made two slight changes to meet my family's needs.  I used flax seed instead of sesame  seeds and I used all chopped pecans instead of sunflower seeds and almonds.  I would also do 1/2 almonds and half pecans.  This is light and delicious.  My kids love it on greek yogurt!

This is a great granola base to follow.  I took a few things out and added a few things in (it's usually no problem to mess with granola ingredients as long as the swaps are similar, i.e. dry for dry, wet for wet), and while I cut the oil and honey by half, I still really enjoyed this recipe.

Very good!  I had read one comment which stated it was not sweet so I added about 1/4 cup of Slenda to it. I keep it in a container so we can use it durig the day as a snack  :)

Delicious. Love the low temp baking and the use of the stove top to melt together the sugars and oil. This is a robust recipe, meaning you can make it your own while following the method provided. I stuck fairly close to the recipe but didn't have coconut or sesame seeds, I also used less oil (1/3 cup). Really loved the crispy granola! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great taste...not too sweet. I've made 3xbatch twice for gifts, and made it more "tropical". Every one has  loved this granola! Thanks Maxine!

This is the first time I've made granola, and I wasn't sure how "dry" the mix should be when it comes out of the oven.  I probably cooked about 8 minutes longer than I should have, not realizing how much it dries when it's cooled.  In the future, it will come out of the oven to cool at 1 hour, as written.  Not to worry, it was still delicious.  I had no sunflower seeds, so I sub'd chopped pecans, and I did cut the oil back to 1/3 cup, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I chose chopped apricots over golden raisins, and I would do that in the future.  This yielded enough to fill a half-gallon storage container.  Will be making this again.

This was great! I didn't use any seeds because I didn't have any, but substituted 1/2 cup chopped almonds instead of the slivered ones. I also would cut down the salt to 1 tsp next time. I didn't have raisins/apricots so I used dried cranberries.

I replace the sunflower seeds and sesame seeds with more slivered almonds, and then it's perfect.

I add a bit more honey to make it a bit 'clumpier' and mix up the fruits, sometimes adding apricots, dried peaches, whatever I have on hand

This granola is so easy and equally as delicious! This will be my go-to recipe from now on. I do prefer my granola a bit on the drier side, so I add an additional 10-15 minutes of baking time.

This is quite good, though as I can't stand sesame I left it out.  My oven thermometer is flaky, and because of that I use my three crockpots a lot. The method I found for making granola in one works well for me. Take the oatmeal, nuts,  and all the liquids, and cook on High, without the lid, for an hour. I stir here every 20 minutes. After an hour turn to Low, again no lid, add all the rest of your ingredients, and cook two to four hours. I now stir every half hour, and with my oval crock I find three hours gives me a nice color.  If you find your coconut and/or dried fruits too chewy/tough, add them at the first hour on low.

I just made this granola for the first time...I will never by store-bought granola again! I left out the coconut (not a fan of it) and the dried fruit.  The only changes that I will make next time, to suit mine and my husbands taste buds, is a little less salt and a little more sugar.  Maxine, YOU RULE!  Thank you for sharing!

I make this to have on hand continuously. I omit the cinnamon, use flax seed instead of sunflower, and cut back a little on the oil. We love it with yogurt or as a snack.
