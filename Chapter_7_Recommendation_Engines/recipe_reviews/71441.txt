I made this for a baby shower and it was a HUGE hit. I made a few changes; I substituted turkey for the bologna and used regular mayo in place of the Miracle Whip. I didn't frost the outside with cream cheese; when I spread the fillings betweeh the layers, I spread nearly to the edge, then pressed the top layer down to squeeze the filling out to the edge. After the last layer, I trimmed the sides, cut the loaf in half, wrapped each half tightly in plastic wrap and placed it in the freezer for about four hours, which made slicing it thinly MUCH easier. I cut it into thin slices and served it arranged on a platter; I think frosting the outside with cream cheese would have made for a messy presentation. This was time-consuming but worth it.

Using whatever sandwich filling you like this makes a lovely brunch/shower offering. When I was a girl I remember the bakery would sell coloured loaves which they would slice horizontally for us. We then could have different coloured bread slices as well as different fillings in each sandwich.

Awesome.  Use any kind of filling its a pretty presentation.  Many think its a white frosted cake at first.

i made this for a Saturday family brunch and by the time I sat down to enjoy it, only one slice remained! Everyone loved it, including my 6 year old grand daughter to our selective-eater son-in-law!
