Well, I hate to say this, but please do not waste your time, money, lobster and chocolate on this recipe.  It is truly a troublesome combination.

I am not a fan of lobster, but the chocolate made it irresitible.  My only thought is that I would have prefered the sauce to be thicker, so that the chocolate taste could be more amplified.  Maybe use heavy cream instead of milk?
