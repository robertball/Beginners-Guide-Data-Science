The recipe needs 2 emandations.  First, the cookies are eased into a pot of melted lard for deep fat cooking.  Do NOT splash, you will hurt!  Cook untill the cookie returns to the surface and turn over to finish cooking.  The cookie should not be brown!  Second, a pastry wheel will cut the cookies and allow you to create a diagonal line across the middle and flip one end of the cookie through the hole to create a cookie which looks like a belt buckle and the shape will provide a hole to hook with a fork when you lift it out of the lard.  Swallow to dry your mouth and blow the excess lard off the cookie before placing it on a flat piece of a brown paper bag to finish draining and to cool.  The cardamum will taste better if you store the cookies in a paper lined sealed container for at least a week.  The cookies will maintain their texture there also.

This recipe is good, but as another reviewer suggested, the Fattigmand should be cut in a diamond shape with a wheel on a handle.  My mother had a special wheel for this.  Also if you add a tablespoon of whisky or other alcohol, they will not absorb the oil as they cook.  My mother always used vegetable oil and never lard. My mother's recipe used more eggs and the amount it made was dependent on the number of eggs used.  The reason that they are called Fattigmand Bakkles (poor man's cookies) is that they contain ingredients that everyone could afford.

my grandmother taught me how to make this cookie 3 years ago, before her passing. her grandmother taught her how to make it. Our family came to america over 100 years ago, and have made the cookie at christmas time ever since their arrival. This cookie is truly special to my entire extended family.  I am carrying on the tradition now.  happy baking!

My Great Grandmother who came over from Norway, taught me and my mother how to make these cookies.  In addition to the other tips, we dusted the cookies with powdered sugar when we were done.

I love this recipe, I have my great grandmother's hand written copy, which is written in backing spoons, flour enough, and "spitting temperature of the lard"  This is the closest I've come to a modern version, only she used nutmeg as she didn't like cardomand

I saw this recipe & thought I'd try a different Fattigmand recipe instead of my great-great-grandmothers. I did not like this recipe at all. there was not enough cardamom and definately not enough sugar! It was completely tasteless, in my opinion tasted like cardboard. I had to add sugar to it after it was a dough & it turned out horrible I threw half of it away & made the recipe I used for years. Fattigmand is not supposed to be a sweet cookie but there is supposed to be at least enough to taste the sweetness & this recipe was not like that. I will not use this one again.

My heritage is Nowegian and German. I get to enjoy German and Norwegian Christmas cookies every year. Fattingman is one of my favorites. They have light powdered sugar on top and YUM YUM :)

Hi,

I see I am a tad late, in replying here, but never the less, I too was taught by my Grandmother, and she came here from Norway and we too keep the tradition going strong. We have A BAkkelfest every year in December, and the whole family gathers in my Grandparents old home in which my parents now own, and we have a great time!!

Close to my Grandmother's recipe.  Cardamon to taste was all that was written in English.  I also add a tbls of brandy.  Another recipe recommend refrigerating overnight to make it easier to roll.

My husbands mother, who is now passed, shared a very similiar Norwegian Recipe that she called Fuddins. Guessing that was family slang for this treat. Glad to read about the heritage of the recipe and thanks for sharing.

Just about like my Norwegian grandmother's Fattigmann's, but needs 1 tablespoon brandy.
