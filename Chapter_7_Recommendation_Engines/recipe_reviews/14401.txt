We loved this salad!  Used Kraft coleslaw dressing and didn't think it called for enough until it sat for a bit and the amount was perfect.  I love coleslaw and everything is better with bacon and bluecheese so you can't go wrong.  So easy (used prewashed & sliced cabbage in a bag!) and wonderful taste.  Took to a July 4 celebration yesterday and everyone loved it.

I made this salad even though I didn't think my hubby would like it. I wanted to try it however and went ahead and made it. I was shocked when my husband decided he would try it (without my begging for him to "just taste it!")  He LOVED IT! I LOVED IT! We both were so pleased with this that it will be made again and again.

Delicious!!!!  I made one mistake...I didn't think 1/4 cup blue cheese was enough so I added a bit, but it was too strong.  Still delicious and different.

Best slaw recipe ever!  My son-in-law wolfed it down.  This keeps beautifully and can easily be made a day ahead.  (If you don't let anybody know it's in there.)  Blue cheese and cabbage.  Whoda Thunk!  But, it's perfect and yummy.

One of the best recipes ever!  Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe.  One of my friends (who is a great cook) substituted pecans for the bacon and said it was still great!

I reduced the calorie and sodium content by using 6 slices of bacon, instead of 12.  I much prefer using halved tomatoes, as in the Ingredient list, rather than sliced tomatoes, as in Directions.

Just made this and it's great.  I love tomatoes and blue cheese so it was perfect for me.  I bet it is even better once the flavors have had a chance to combine.  Thanks!

My husband liked this but thought it was a bit salty. I thought it was OK but may try a mixture of bacon and pecans next time. I used ready made bacon bits and it had that kind of flavor as opposed to "hot out of the pan, just fried bacon." Will try it again.

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone liked it. Instead of the coleslaw mix I cut up a head of green and a head of red cabbage and added shredded carrots.  Thanks for sharing this recipe I will definately make again!

It's a great recipe.  Just keep in mind if you're looking for the standard coleslaw this is not it.  But just an awesome recipe.  I, too, used the pre-cooked bacon and it IS 100 times easier, tastes almost as good. Also, to cut down on time I used a premase slaw dressing (for the first time) and will NEVER do it again.  Just not the same at all!!!   Anyhow, great variation.

This is fantastic! I had saved this recipe almost ten years ago, but just got around to making it last night. This is very much like a chopped salad at a high-end steakhouse (Ruth's Chris/Mortons). I used a bag of cole slaw mix, only 5 slices of bacon, added 3 green onions, grape tomatoes instead of cherry and Marie's Cole Slaw dressing.  My husband loved it!  I will make this more often since I see just how good this is.  It is versatile too--great with ribs, steak, casual gatherings or elegant parties.  A keeper!!

I needed to add more bacon.  This is a twist on coleslaw and everyone seemed to like this version.

I used this recipe at a Quilters Group pot luck.  It was really liked.  I used gargonzola cheese and less than 6 slices of bacon.  I made dressing from sour cream and Miracle Whip. half and half.  I put the bacon on just before serving so it would stay crisp.

Great recipe.  Used napa (chinese) cabbage for a more delicate flavor, reduced sodium bacon and homemade cole slaw dressing (with lite mayo and plain yogurt).  It was a hit served along side of sweet barbecued chiken.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made this for two different occasions and both times, none was left.  I was also asked by several for the recipe.  A very unique and tasty slaw.

Excellent! I was a little nervous to serve this at my July 4th party, because so many people don't care for blue cheese.... but it received all kinds of compliments and the bowl was emptied! Thanks!

I got so many compliments on this recipe.  The bleu cheese is so unexpected and really makes it a nice alternative to your basic cole slaw.  Might want to let people know there's bleu cheese in it, just in case someone doesn't like it!

Loved it!  My hubby is very particular about his cole slaw, and I have never liked it until this recipe!!  I used Marzetti's Slaw Dressing which is tangy and I am a huge blue cheese fan so I gave this a try.  I am very glad I did!  Thanks Marcy for an awesome slaw salad!!

This was great and easy - I didn't have tomatoes, and I used gorgonzole instead of blue cheese.  I added cilantro, and made the dressing with mayo, dijon, dill pickle juice a little cider vinegar and sugar.  My kids love it.

Delicious as is.  I did not make any changes.  I used slightly less bacon, but overall it was the same.  The cherry tomatoes were nice.

I really liked the new taste of this coleslaw and would have never thought to use bacon or bleu cheese but it sure was good.  I took it to a Fourth of July picnic yesterday and it was well-received.  I needed to serve about 16 people so used 2 bags (about 10 cups of angel hair cabbage), 1 lb of bacon (because I always end up burning some), 1 cup of bleu cheeze crumbles, 2 cups of slaw dressing and fresh ground pepper.  Another member mentioned it was okay to prepare the night before so I did so with only the cabbage and bacon ~ but won't do that again because I think it made the cabbage too wilty and soggy.  Seems it would be okay to have all your ingredients chopped and ready to throw together a couple of hours before you plan to serve it.  Oh well, next time :-)

This was the best coleslaw I've ever eaten!  I used Marie's coleslaw dressing and the preshredded coleslaw from the grocery store which I always use but with the added ingredients, it was outstanding!

I was hesitant to make slaw as it's not usually my favorite, but this seemed like a good dish to take to a themed BBQ so I gave it a whirl.  Everyone - including my husband LOVED it! (I didn't tell him that there was bleu cheese in it until after he went back for seconds!)

I don't normally like cole slaw and picked this recipe for a 4th of July cookout as a favor to my husband.  I was blown away by how GOOD it was.  The mix of crunchy and sweet was wonderful.  We were all fighting over the last bit in the bowl and all my friends demanded the recipe before they would leave my house.  Many thanks!

There were only two of us, and I wanted to trim the calorie content, so I made some modifications.  Used 6 slices of "veggie" bacon, 3 cups of cole slaw mix, 1/4 cup of blue cheese, 1 cup of diced canned tomatoes and 1/2 cup of dressing (1/4 cup of fat free sour cream, 1/4 cup of light mayo).

We enjoyed it.  The combination of the bacon flavor and blue cheese was great.

I would have to agree; this is some of the best cole slaw I've ever eaten.  I have made this several times now, and it is always a hit.  I will often cut back on the bacon and add more tomatoes (which makes it a little healthier, plus I love tomatoes).  Yum!

I made this to take along to a 4th of July party.  Unfortunately the only kind of cole slaw dressing I could find in our grocery stores were the sweet tasting vinegar-based dressings.  I didn't have time to look up a nice creamy cole slaw dressing and go out and buy the ingredients, so I just used the premade stuff.  Yuch, yuch, yuch!  Maybe this recipe would be good if there was a good premade dressing to be had, but I do not like the vinegar-based cole slaw.

I made this a zillion times already and everyone loves it. I use a package of ready made cole slaw,package of recipe bacon bits , a container of blue cheese, and Marzettis slaw dressing- 1/2 jar per bag of cole slaw,I don't use the tomatoes- no reason just don't. Its delicious as is. Thank you for the recipe!

WONDERFUL!  Amazing...I made it for my 30th BD BBQ and it was a HUGE hit!!    I used Kraft bottled coleslaw dressing.  My only complaints have nothing to do with the recipe itself...coleslaw dressing was hard to find!  I went to 3-4 stores!  And the measurements on the shredded cabbage bag was confusing.  I wound up with sooo much excess cabage!

Awesome. I have made this three times now and my friends keep asking for more! I did cut down on the dressing a little the second time and made it the night before to let the flavors meld together. Adding shredded carrots for Halloween tomorrow.

The slaw haters loved it....the blue cheese haters loved it.  I scaled the recipe to use 2 bags of shredded cabbage/carrots, but my sister not realizing used 1.5 cups of slaw dressing (I used Litehouse).  No problem, it was saucy, but still good.  I added 3 roma chopped roma tomatoes and 8 oz of blue cheese (I'm a huge fan of blue cheese).  The result was OUTSTANDING and we all loved it.  Thank you!  I've been meaning to try it for a while!

A huge hit at our family gathering!  The blue cheese had some feeling hesitant, but as it's not an overwhelming flavor in the recipe, everyone enjoyed.  It's a great twist on too-sweet or too-vinegary slaws.  A tip - precooked bacon is worth it's weight on gold!

wow, my family adores bleu cheese so this recipe was ideal for us! like other reviewers i added a handful of shredded carrot for color. i also made the slaw a few hours earlier to allow for the cabbage to break down & flavors to mingle. thanks a bunch marcy!!

I made this for the 4th of July and fell in love with this delicious salad.  I had to make a copy of the recipe for everyone before I could get them out the door.  Even the "non-cooks" wanted the recipe.  I had to double the recipe and was glad I did.  I did have a little leftover (actually after tasting it I hid it in the fridge) and was a little disappointed with it as a leftover.  I love bleu cheese but it was a little too strong for me the next day.    

Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good and very easy, especially when you buy the precooked bacon and cheat, the way I did.  Came out great!!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, I did add some shredded carrot for color.

i recommend cutting up a "hunk" of blue cheese as the pre-crumbled pieces are too small and get lost in the sauce.  marcy is right, i'll never go back to the other way...

I made this as a side to go with the slow cooker buffalo chicken sandwich recipe on this site. My hubby and bro completely inhaled this! I may try this with gorgonzola and see how it goes over (for peeps who don't like blue cheese). I took other reviewer's advice and used Kraft coleslaw dressing. Super easy to throw together ahead of time! I'll be making this again and again!

Good salad. It's fun to read the reviews. I thought there was too much dressing and that it needed a bit of salt...just personal preference. If I make it again, I would add the dressing just til it covers the cabbage and include some other veggies to it (like broccoli, green peppers or green onions. I guess it would be Red, White, Blue and Green Slaw, though.

Five stars are not enough!  I'm not a cole slaw fan but I made it for DH who loved it... then the kids loved it... so I tried it, and now I love it too!  I used an entire package of shredded cabbage, and Marzetti's Light slaw dressing, and followed the recipe just as it's written.  I am now a convert to cole slaw, and I will use this recipe often.  Thank you!

This salad is SO good!  I tossed in more cherry tomatoes because they are so good this time of year!  I served the salad with slow-cooked BBQ chicken and garlic smashed potatoes.  The salad was almost gone at the end of the meal.  It is AMAZING!  I topped it with additional blue cheese crumbles, bacon, and tomatoes.  Try this...you won't be disappointed!

I used a bag of shredded slaw mix and pre-cooked bacon to save time.  I also left out the cheese.  It still had a great flavor.  It's all about the bacon.  The more the better!

Really good! To cut back on time I just use the bag of coleslaw mix and precooked bacon. I could'nt find Mazaretti that everyone used so I used LiteHouse for the dressing...Tasted great to me!

I was a little skeptical of this one because of the bleu cheese, but decided to try it anyways. I'm so glad I did because it was delicious! It went over well at a recent picnic we went to. I highly recomend trying this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made this yesterday for an early 4th of July BBQ at a friend's this evening.  The flavor was FANTASTIC yesterday, and even better today!  Can't believe such a simple recipe is so tasty.  Also used Marzetti's slaw dressing, gorgonzola (my deli was out of blue cheese), and my home grown cherry tomatoes will be added before I leave the house.  Thanks, Marcy!

Yum yum. I halved the recipe for 2 plus leftovers. Used real bacon bits, that' s what I had. I used "Easy Coleslaw Dressing" instead of purchased dressing. This was a hit with the family. I served it with a turkey meatloaf made with buffalo chicken spices. Tomorrow the meatloaf and salad will go into a wrap for lunch. Can't wait.

DEE Licous.  Tastes just like a fancy chopped salad.  My brother and sis in law ate the entire bowl, and I made a double recipe.  They have requested it for our next party in 2 weeks.  Yum.

Love this recipe, but I always use RED CABBAGE, which is really purple and sets off the presentation so much more. (Mixing the tomatoes in, of course.) The red cabbage even tastes better with all the strong tastes of bacon and blue cheese.

I loved the addition of blue cheese but didn't like the bacon. I might try again with the bacon though because I'm not sure if I burned it. I keep getting a bitter taste in my mouth that I think is from the bacon.

I don't know what I did wrong considering all the rave reviews. I couldn't even eat it and I like blue cheese.

I don't get the rave reviews. This was was not well liked at our july 4th party. Way too much blue cheese for my taste (and I love blue cheese). Will probabaly not make again.

I've made this before using vinegar, mayo, maple syrup and sour cream.  Being the fourth of July, I am also adding blueberries to the slaw.  It is really pretty.  Thanks

What a great change from plain old slaw.  This was delicious!  Even my husband, who does not like cole slaw or blue cheese, said this was tasty.

This is so easy and so good. Everytime I've taken it to a picnic or party the bowl is emptied and I'm asked for the recipe. Wonderful flavors.

We absolutely love this!!!  You weren't kidding when you said that once you eat this you won't go back to the old way!  I added fresh chopped tomatoes from the garden tonight and it was fabulous.  We make it all the time and won't eat it any other way now!!

I bought the cole slaw in a package that came with the dressing and added the rest of the ingrediants.  Couldn't believe how delicous!  I've had many people ask for the recipe.

If you like blue cheese, you will probably like this recipe.  I, unfortunately, should have never made it because I don't like blue cheese.  It has a very strong blue cheese taste.
