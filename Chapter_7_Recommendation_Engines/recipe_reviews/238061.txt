RefreashIng and very easy salad to make.  I used frozen corn cause I don't like the preservative taste in my salads.

7.10.17  Corn and tomatoes are in season right now, so I cut my corn off of the cob rather than using canned corn.  I actually forgot to add the olive oil.  When I realized that, I tasted the salad,  and just left it out because I thought it tasted so darn fresh and was simply spot on tasty as is.   Omitting the oil also had to drop the calories and fat (which weren’t bad to begin with I will say)!  We just loved this, and this was the perfect side kick to some grilled chicken.

We loved this recipe! I made exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of using a shallot instead of white onion.  The flavors worked well together and was perfect for a light summer meal along with the Margarita Grilled Shrimp recipe from this site.   This would be even better with fresh corn.

Made recipe exact except cut kernels off 3 left over corn on cob and only one tomato.  Diced avocado and tomato smaller than original image.  Was fantastic as a summer salsa with grilled chicken fajita burrito and rice.  Kind of like Chipotle.  A new fav in my house and great way to use left over (cooked) corn on cob.

Delicious. Used shallots based on someone else’s review and frozen corn. Could’ve used less oil.

Summer in a bowl. I used fresh corn (never canned),  fresh oregano since this was the herb I had on hand.  A perfect  side dish to turkey burgers I had on the grill.

These ingredients are just lovely together! I blanched fresh shocked corn instead of using grilled. I peeled and seeded my tomatoes first and diced them more finely than shown in the photo. Delicious! Will make it again, but next time I will skip the olive oil as it seemed to weigh down the fresh, light taste just a bit.

I prefer frozen corn to canned.  I added some lime zest and only 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  We love this salad, especially on a hot afternoon.

This salad is always a hit! I skip the jalepeno because my kids don't like spicy, and it's still great. Making it for my church picnic today!

I thought this was a fantastic salad.  A perfect side for any Mexican meal.  I used red onions, and added just a pinch of cumin to the dressing, and used frozen corn.  Can’t wait to make this again.

Made this with our homegrown/canned corn.. the only change I made was to cut the olive oil amount in half.  Delicious.. I will make it again.

Its has a healthy fresh taste. Next time I will omit the oil, it is good enough without it.

I also prefer frozen corn. Tastes fresher. I add a little extra lime juice cause we like it that way. Great salad that gets requested every time we get together.

Very good dish, I used fresh corn that I grilled first and added some fresh minced garlic, because, why not?  Also skipped the cilantro because I'm not a fan but followed the recipe besides that... Will make again!  Maybe add some black beans next time...

This salad is one of my favorites!  I make it often, but only in the summer when fresh corn is sweet and plentiful.  I do not use canned corn in this recipe.  I prefer raw corn, cut fresh off the stalk.  It's crunchy, and healthy, and sweet, and I absolutely love it along side homemade burgers or barbecue.  I usually double the lime and the avocado.  And, I don't hesitate to throw in other fresh vegetables from my garden, such as tender raw okra or zucchini.  This salad satisfies a wide-range of palettes, and I recommend you try it quick before corn goes out of season.

I loved this! I used 2 cans of sweet corn, 4 chopped avocado, grape tomatoes, red onion, only 1 diced jalapeño (not a fan) and then blended some olive oil and squeezed limes (4 small) into a bowl and tossed into the mix. Did not add cilantro and no pepper since I was out and it was awesome

Tangy and delicious...great recipe if you love corn the way I do.  My husband and I thought the flavors were sensational.  I don't keep many recipes because there are so many new ones to try, but this was a keeper!  I used my garden fresh tomatoes.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe last night and it was instantly devoured. The only thing I would suggest is use half as much olive. Otherwise it's delicious
