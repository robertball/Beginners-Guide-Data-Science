Splendid recipe - worked quite well, BUT did not fry them.  This made enough to bake six large mackerel/tuna muffins in a large muffin tin. Heat was 400 degrees and bake time was 30 minutes.

Made the following recipe ingredient tweaks:
- Reduced mustard to 1 TBS
- Added two minced celery stalks
- Used Vegennaise instead of real mayo
-  Added 1 tsp of dill weed

Came out great, but would advise to grease tins with something like coconut butter, butter, margarine.  Awesome.

I have made this twice, but with some substitutions! I'm not a fan of mackerel so I just used the tuna. I also didn't have Mrs. Dash, so I used a dash of onion powder and garlic powder, a pinch of salt, and a smidge of pepper. I love it so much as a snack or a light meal when I'm not up for anything too heavy. I've used it as the filling in a sandwich once and was not disappointed.

Some of us loved these little fish cakes while the tuna purists took one bite and made a face. I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled.  One batch would have been plenty. They held together much better than I expected but I couldn't flip them worth a darn so there was a plate of patties and a plate of not-patties.  I think I tried to cook too many in the pan at the same time.  We had frozen onion rings on the side and some nice green beans. Tarter sauce was nice on the onion rings but not really needed on the patties, they had great fishy flavor.  I wasn't sure about the pork rinds at first but I'll make this again.

Added two tbsp. Almond flour in place of pork crisps.  These were the best fish cakes we have ever had.

These are very very tasty.  I didn't have pork rinds, so I added a little coconut flour.  The seasoning is perfect.  Mine were crumbly, but that might be because I used coconut flour.

I used Old Bay seasoning instead of Mrs. Dash and brushed the cakes with olive oil since I didn't have any spray.  They turned out pretty good

Amazing!!! Hubby loved them, followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t use very many pork rinds. Didn’t seem to need it. Perfect for low carb or Keto diet. Hubby says these were better than my old recipe with cornmeal & flour??

Finally I find a yummy recipe to use the tuna cans I had. The only other thing I make sometimes is Tuna salad and kids do not like it. Anyway, this is delicious. I did not have pork rinds or Mackerel so I omitted that, it still turned out delicious!!! I will definitely make this again.

Made these tonight. They were pretty tasty, once I figured out, medium high heat was too much and my first batch, didn't hold together that well. I lowered heat and cooked them longer and they pretty much stayed together. then.  It complimented my veggie, rotini, pasta salad, nicely. Will make them again.

Okay, I hate it when recipes are changed and then reviewed, so I'm surprised that I'm doing just that!  As I detest tuna and pork rinds I subbed sardines and rolled oats.  I also used herbes de provence as I had no Mrs. Dash.  The favors are excellent but cry out for a bit of acid.  While lemon was good, the best remedy is tartar sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my first time ever leaving a review on this site, and I created a profile just so I could leave a record of saying WOW WOW WOW!  "Salmon burgers" with canned salmon has been one of my go-to meals for years, and this is a nice step up.  The mackerel adds great texture, and the raw onions are excellent (I usually saute' them for my salmon burgers because my husband *hates* raw onions, but these really get nicely cooked in the process).  My family was so impressed with these (and they're big fans of my usual salmon burgers -- they said these were even better!).
The pork rinds we had were BBQ flavored and fairly spicy, and that really added a nice kick to the overall taste.  Didn't have any parm, so I substituted coconut flour.  Eggs were on the small size, so I used 3.  Texture and stick-togetherness were all great!  Medium high heat was too much for our stove, so I tuned it down to the low side of medium once the pan was good and hot.

Tastes great!  Perfect for high protein, lower carbs & fat diets.
I sprayed a fine mist of avocado oil instead of butter spray. Avocado oil has a much higher smoke temp than other oils.
