This truly does taste just like a favorite restaurant's recipe that I have been trying to duplicate for years.  I'm embarrassed that is was so easy and I couldn't nail it!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 since it was just a side dish for 4 - wished I would have made the full recipe!

I made this for a party and it was a big hit!  It tastes sooo good and is very addicting!  It makes A LOT of dip, though.  Tastes good re-heated the next day....and the next...

Authentic and yummy! I wouldn't call it "hot" though.  For those who like it hot my "cheater" version is easy - simply add a few tbsp of med. salsa to the cheese of your choice ( I use Velvetta + sour cream)a can of sliced jalepenos (don't remove seeds!)and a squirt of real lime juice.  We also like sliced olives - hot and chunky!

This was very good and easy. I do not have a double boiler, so I just melted the heat the regular way over the stove in a pot. I also added a good bit of ground cayenne (red) pepper to the dip. That added much more flavor and a little spice, but really wasn't very spicy. Needs a little more flavor somehow though.

This is so much better than the stuff from a jar.  It's worth the effort to make!

Made according to the recipe, and was fairly disappointed. This is very bland and was overly thick. The amount of vegetables called for didn't really contribute anything. I did scale the recipe back serving-wise to use 1 lb of cheese, but proportionally, that shouldn't have mattered. I think this might be a good start, maybe add in some queso fresca or similar cheese.

I scaled down the recipe to 10 servings for our family of 4 for New Year's Eve.
I used a saucepan on low heat and it melted fine.  The queso was a little bland for us, so I added 1/2 cup of medium salsa.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Ok I thought the celery would be weird and the fresh jalapeño would be too spicy for kiddos BUT! this is SO good!  You MUST add fresh salsa tho, not the slimy jar but the kind you find in the produce/deli section.  And can I just throw some shade on Velveeta cheese "food"? Lol. C'mon, don't go thru all this trouble and then make your kids eat that.  Melt a stick of butter, gradually whisk/stir 1/2 c flour for a few minutes, gradually add maybe 3 c chicken broth, keep stirring.  When smooth gradually add whatever cheese you have.  Today I used some sliced cheese, 3 pckgs that had been in freezer long enough to get burn. But now it's queso dip and very good :)

This was outstanding!  I didn't need the 5lb version so I recalculated for 12 servings which requires 1 2lb loaf of velveeta.  The only thing I did differently was substitute some hot salsa for the water.  I only added 1/2 C of water and it still turned out a tad runny, but was absolutely excellent!!!  I also added some extra jalapenos for a spicy kick and I have to say this will definitely be the recipe I use from now on for queso.

This dip was a huge hit for our cinco de mayo/Kentucky Derby party! I had many requests for the recipe. I only made a couple minor changes - I halved the recipe and it fit perfect in a mini crockpot once it was prepared. I did melt the cheese on a double boiler and that worked well. I also took one of the reviewers suggestions and used white American cheese because it melts better. Next time I may leave some of the ribs and seeds in the jalapeño because I like a little more heat but it was perfect for a group!

Was not like any queso I've ever tasted in a restaurant . . . it would soon be out of business with a dip like this. Very disappointed. The celery added a weird taste and I missed the tomatoes. Keep looking for a better recipe.

Dangerously good. You can adjust the heat to your liking. I went mild and it was great. Used the leftovers over baked potatoes and was awesome!

This is so easy to make! I made is with the Velveeta "Queso Blanche."  My family said it's even better than restaurant cheese dip. I did use 2 jalepenos and would consider using 3 or even 4 to spice it up a bit more.

We used to love El Chico queso.  They went out of business and we have been missing it.  This was the closest I have EVER found to their queso.  My sons loved it and ate so much I had to go back and make more.   It is not spicy so we just add a couple of spoons of diced jalepenos to it and it is great!  Thank you for the recipe.
