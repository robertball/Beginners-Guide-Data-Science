This cookie is ADDICTIVE! They're like Pringles once you pop you can't stop! Be prepared to gain 10 lbs because you won't be able to contain yourself. The crunchiness of this cookie is what makes it so addictive. I used Andies mint chips since I didn't have the chocolate chips. Baked up nice and tasted wonderful.

How do you get 16 cookies/servings out of this if you divide the dough in half and make 10 cookies from each? Before I make them I just need to know how many calories in each. I can't trust the nutrient info on the recipe based on each cookie if the number of cookies doesn't come out right. Later: I made them anyway and added the total calories & divided by 20 cookies.  There are 190 calories in each if you make 20. I used a whole cup of chopped pecans. Works better on foil than on Silpat. If you want them thin you have to spread the dough thin when you shape them on the baking sheet. Otherwise they're still hard/crispy but thicker.

They were flat on the edges and puffier in the middle.  Nothing like the picture.  I added 2 tbs more flour to the rest of the batter.  They came out a little too thick and had a flour taste.  Guess I need to play with the flour if I want to make these again.  I bake a lot!  There are no eggs in this recipe, so it is good for anyone making cookies for an egg allergy child.  :-)  I will continue on my quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie.

Nice cookies! I just wish there was a less buttery version of this... I might replace some butter with almond butter next time, it might be healthier ...and still crunchy hopefully!

These super delicious cookies came out just as described. I followed the recipe exactly besides the confusing bowl to baking sheet instructions. I simply rolled 1" balls from a spoon with gloved hands and placed them 3 in. Apart with the foil as instructed. I then smashed the balls as far and flat out as I could. They were uber crisp and so chocolatey. I ate them until my tummy said no more.

Crispy and delicious but the chocolate from the Ghirardelli is almost too overwhelming. I followed the recipe almost exactly and the came out crispy and light. I had to leave them in the oven for about 4 minutes more so that they were perfecto!

i made this recipe without the nuts using normal salted butter (i never buy unsalted butter) and half the called for salt, crispy edges chewy middle, and these were inhaled within the hour.   my 11 year old son wanted them again so he made them himself using normal butter but he left out the salt completely and used milk choc chips, best non-oatmeal choc chip cookies that have ever gone through our house, and we've made oodles and oodles of cookies!

We are big fans of the crunchy chocolate chip cookie and these did not disappoint! I can barely make them fast enough to keep up with my son and husband devouring them. I've made them many times as the recipe is written (but excluding the nuts) and yesterday decided to modify things slightly, with excellent results: I reduced the amount of chocolate chips slightly (to about 3/4 c), used a small scooper (melon baller) to drop the batter on the cookie sheets (and still came out with 20 cookies of pretty uniform size and shape), and sprinkled some fleur de sel on some of the cookies (the 5 that I earmarked for me!) before putting them in the oven (kicked the deliciousness factor up a notch!).  This is the best crunchy chocolate chip cookie recipe!!

These are very delicious & crispy!! But they're also greasy because of the butter to flour ratio...which is what makes them crispy I guess! Or maybe it's the length of time they bake...? I'll try baking my regular chocolate chip cookies longer next time to see if they also get crispy.

I specifically chose this recipe because I like crispy cookies.  This recipe makes huge cookies! They were at least 5" in diameter.  I used a medium cookie scoop (about 1/8 cup) to reduce them to 3" cookies.  I think the foil is important. Be sure to flatten them somewhat before baking. So delicious!  I only finished baking them a hour ago, and they are crispy on the edges and softer in the middle.  I'll take that!

I just baked these cookies and my family loved it! This recipe is a keeper. I used a small scooper instead of the measuring cup and it still came out big. I used wax paper to flatten the batter instead of the plastic wrap.

This is the BEST recipe I think.  Don't add anything different and they will come out just as the picture!  Do it down to even using the foil!

Well, I have to take back my previous review. I stupidly used salt instead of sugar so I had to start over. This time i portioned out 16 balls and flattened them to 3".  The sugar allowed the cookies to spread in the oven. I used 325 for the 15 min but added another 4 min. They came out very crispy. Will definitely make again. Maybe I will add a pinch of chili powder.

These are absolutely my favorite C.C. Cookies!  I Love ghiradelli chips (especially dark). I love that there are no eggs in the recipe- makes me feel safe eating tons of the dough!  Through the years, there are batches of cookies I have made that don’t get eaten.   My family polishes these off in one day!

Fantastic! Crispy cookie just like I was looking for (Trader Joe’s mini chocolate chip cookies). Do NOT miss the step to pat down the dough balls thin before cooking. It will not work if you just drop the ball on the sheet like other cookie recipes. I used salted butter and just halved the salt amount. Worked great. Cooked on silicone sheet instead of tin foil and worked just fine as well.

This no-egg recipe for chocolate chip cookies is great! You can eat the dough right away if you please and it won’t be bad for you. The dough also bakes well. I tend to undertake these so they turn out doughy and soft, and they always turn out great! Baking them until crispy probably also tastes just as good, although that doesn’t suit me and my friends’ taste buds. I have made these multiple times before, and will make them much more in the future.

This is the only "crispy" chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made that actually works! I add dried cherries to the dough, along with pecans, and they're ridiculously good. I use a small scoop to measure out the dough and just flatten the dough portions with a saran-wrapped palm. This makes a medium-size cookie, which I prefer to a gigantic one.

With the exception of the Ghirardelli brand chips, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  Thin, buttery, crispy.  I particularly  love crispy chocolate chip cookies and these will forever more be my "go to" choc chip cookie.  Thank you.

It was my first time making this recipe without any issue. No changes or additions were made to this recipe, except doubling it. I was careful to press the cookies nice and thin pressing between the chips with my fingers. They were thin, crisp and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe.
Crispy and all nicely browned...

I replaced the corn syrup with 1 tsp of golden syrup and I didn't add milk.

A keeper for me!
Gonna bake more....for xmas.

I am a horrible baker, also I never give reviews.. however this was absolutely the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made (and I've tried dozens). They were super easy to make and I have absolutely no idea how those 2 bad raters had a gloppy mess (like I said I am a horrible baker, it has to be a very simple recipe for me to get it right)!! They either didn't follow the directions or have a bad oven!

These tasted great but looked terrible. They stuck to the foil somehow, even though they were super greasy, so they ripped apart. And they were only crispy on the edges. Won't make these again.

I made these because my husband always asks be to "burn" his cookies.  This is an awesome cookie.  I normally do not like crispy cookies, but these are the exception.  Only change I made was a added a little extra flour.  Recipe made two dozen cookies.  Yummy!
