My husband & I loved this.  Don't let the Quickness Rating deter you...you can always roast the peppers earlier in the day. I will make it again, but next time use 6 instead of 4 peppers.

This is a delicious lasagne, even my kids ate it (1 being an extremely picky 13 year old).  They picked out the peppers.  My husband and I loved it.  Perhaps the previous reviewer forgot to add the tomatoes, (they are considered a vegetable even though technically, they're a fruit).  I bought red peppers for 50 cents each and the white sauce turned out PERFECT the way the recipe was written.  If you cook it long enough, it doesn't taste floury.  I did add some mozzarella cheese and it was very delicious!  I will definately make it again.  By the way, what other vegetables does traditional lasagna have besides tomatoes? (See previous review)

I made this and it definetly became a family favorite! I used mozzerella cheese instead of the parmesan the second time I made it because I thought the parmesan was too dry. My husband who is a real 'meat lover' really loves this receipe!

There are several reasons why I HATED this recipe:

1)The recipe is basically red sauce with flour sauce on lasagne noodles.
2)The white sauce amounts are off, not only did I have to make it three times to get it right, but the flavor was awful and floury.  If it gets to hot, you will have lumps with that amount of flour.
3)Because the only vegetable in this recipe is red pepper, it has no substance to hold the lasagna together and is needlessly expensive.
4) The red sauce is not particularly flavorful either and needs spice and possibly fresh basil.
5) The final product is gloup, a pink, floury gloup.  It took me almost 2 hours to make gloup. 

A waste of time and money!

This recipe is the best one I have pulled off this site! It's sooooooo good! Don't let the amount of work and time involved deter you from making this dish because it's sooooo yummy and totally worth it! I prefer dicing the roasted peppers instead of leaving them in slices though. Fabulous creamy twist on the standard lasagna fare. Yum yum; my new favorite pasta dish!!!!

This lasagna is really delicious.  It is definitely worth the trouble.  I made the red pepper/tomato sauce the night before and had the lasagna in the oven and baking in no time.  I subscribe to this magazine and have NEVER been disappointed with one of their recipes.  I would recommend it to anyone.

This was not as good as I was expecting based on others' reviews.  I agree that the white sauce tasted too much of flour.  I used 5 bell peppers - 2 red, 1 orange, 1 yellow, and 1 green, because that is what I had on hand.  That part tasted good.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that I had no pepper sauce left over to put on the top.  Because of the extreme amount of time prepping this meal, I won't be making it again.

I thought this recipe was fabulous.  It did take some time to prepare the peppers but it was worth it.  Like another reviewer, I didn't think there were enough peppers so I added a small jar of roasted red peppers to the ones that I had prepared.  The leftovers were wonderful for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was very good, especially for being a "light" entree.  I prepared it for my husband, who typically doesn't like red sauce dominated food, and he was pleasantly surprised at the lack of tomato sauce.  The red peppers gave it great flavor, though I would chop them into smaller bits next time.  I didn't change anything on the recipe, though next time I may season a bit more.

I made this the other day and although it was a bit time consuming, it was very good and well worth the effort, makes great leftovers too!

Very Good!  I used no-boil noodles, so I cooked it for a bit longer in the oven.

This turned out to be really good.  I added more salt to the white sauce and put mozarella cheese on top. I don't know that I'll be making too often as it did take a long time to prepare, but everyone enjoyed it.

My husband loves this recipe! I make it all the time and it's super easy. I usually roast the red peppers a day or so before that way it takes only half an hour to prepare. Sometimes for variety I add mushrooms to the sauce or layer grilled or sauteed zucchinni with the other layers before the parma cheese. Great for leftovers too!

I don't think this makes enough sauce for a 9 X 13 pan.  I did a 9 X 9 square and it came out good.  I also added some cottage cheese into the second layer and used jarred roasted red peppers instead of roasting them myself.  I used half the crushed tomatoes called for and added diced tomatoes (balsamic vinegar flavor from a can) and topped it with cheddar cheese.  My white sauce came out just fine--YUM!  Overall, very tasty, just needs more sauce...

One of my favorite recipes and given that it's also vegetarian is a plus. We never miss having meat with this filling dish.
