The most ridiculous way of making Yorkshire pudding I've ever seen. Yorkshire pudding is more of a baked pancake... made separately from the meat.

This recipe tasted so wonderful but it didn't need the extra oil pored on it! The roaster makes plenty of fat. I had to spoon out 1/2 cup of oil when it came out of the oven. The yorkshire was good and the chicken was very moist. I have to try this again without the oil and see if it works. I really didn't understand the coating of flour either but I made the recipe as written and planned to give it another chance. Also this is not for the calorie counters but keep in mind nor is the roast beef with yorkshire pudding. My family loved it and I'm willing to give it a chance without the added oil.

This is not British do not make- I'm fairly certain it is a wind up. Never has anyone cooked a whole chicken in Yorkshire batter- that's just insane. The only 'meat' that's cooked in batter is sausages for 'Toad in the Hole' but absolutely nothing else. Yorkshires are baked separately and had on the side. Do not make this ridiculousness.

Ummmm. This chicken came out really moist and tender. I had a little over a 5 pounder so it took a bit longer to cook. I only used about 1/8 cup of EVOO and it seemed just right. Not ever having yorkshire pudding before let alone making it it was a big surprise. We loved it! Not sure if it came out the way it should have but it was good! Thanks for the post!

Thanks for adding the photo Michelle! I think next time I make it I will omit the extra oil. I bet you are right about it not being neccessary. Thanks for the review!

Awesome chicken! I took the advice of others and did not put the extra oil in at least not initially. the chicken I used was a very lean young chicken and it literally produced maybe ONE tablespoon of grease if that! So after I cooked the chicken for 1hr I added about about a 1/4 cup of coconut oil (since that is what I had on hand) and then poured in the batter and it turned out awesome! I should note though since I am allergic to milk I substituted 1 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup of hazlenut milk for the 1 and 1/2 cups of milk and i couldn't tell it was milk free at all it tasted amazing and my milk loving husband liked it too! I might reduce the oil just a tad next time but maybe to about 1/6 depending on what the next chicken produces. But wonderfully tasty dish and is very hearty it will keep you full for a long time I ate a small serving with mashed potatoes and some zuccini 5hrs ago and I am not even a little bit hungry now! Very very good! I am a huge fan of English food and if you are too its definitely worth trying!:) God Bless Amy

I've made this a couple of times and each time it turned out great. The yorkshire is beyond flavorful. The only issue is that the chicken is bland. The second time we made an extra side of gravy and it was great.

I made this recipe a few nights ago for me and my boyfriend. It turned out well but I substituted the parsley with freshly diced chives and stuffed the chicken with sliced brown mushrooms and sliced leeks surrounding the chicken with the veggies that wouldn't fit in the chicken's cavity. It took longer to roast than indicated but the chicken was pretty good-sized. Fun new recipe though!

I made this recipe and the chicken was wonderful coming from someone who has had authentic Yorkshire pudding I felt that this was extremely heavy and more like a dumpling. It was good though...
