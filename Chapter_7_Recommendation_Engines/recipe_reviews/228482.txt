This is a really great Okra dish.  Awesome flavor.  Small okra is the best.  Mine were a bit bigger, so I cut them in half on a sharp diagonal.  I kept the heat way up in the  wok and got some blackening on some of the pieces.  I followed the recipe, except I has some chili tepins, so I crushed about 6 of them and added to the stir fry.  It is really good with a little heat.  Use a chopped Serrano or Jalapeno if you don't have tepins.
