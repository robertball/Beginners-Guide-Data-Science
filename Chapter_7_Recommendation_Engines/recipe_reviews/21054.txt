I am not one for following recipes to a tee, so I added a few ideas of my own to this recipe after reading other reviews....after doing so I thought this was the best fudge and would certainly make it again! I added 1/4 cup butter. Instead of butter and rum I used vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons. Instead of half an 11 ounce bag of white chocolate chips I used the whole bag. I melted the chips and butter in the microwave then added the extract then poured in pan and let it sit for 2 hours or so in the fridge.

I was looking for a fudge recipe that didn't use marshmallow fluff.  After reading the reviews I was worried that it wouldn't turn out, so I read the information about perfect fudge, if you take this fudge to 234 degrees when you are stirring it, it will set and be perfect!  The recipe directions aren't very clear on how much to cook, but that really worked for me!

Since my husband loves butterscotch, I thought I'd give this one a try. It wouldn't set up enough to cut and eat like fudge. After a day in the fridge, it was still gooey and even my kids wouldn't eat it due to the texture.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have any butter extract so I used French Vanilla instead.  I brought the mixture to a full boil to help it set and it turned out great.  I recommend it for sure.

BE CAREFUL!!  Very easy to burn, there isn't enough moisture.  I added 1 can of Sweetened Condensed Milk and 1/4 cup of butter and microwaved it.  It's much smoother that way.  Add the extracts after it's melted.  The extracts aren't a requirement, but they make it tasty.

This was awesome, but I made a couple changes.  I love butterscotch flavor so I used all butterscotch chips and no white chocolate.  I also used two whole 11-oz bags to fix the issue others had with it not setting up (which will almost always happen when made with the standard 3 cups of any white/flavored chocolate) and it came out almost perfect; a little softer than I like but very creamy and still easy to cut.  If the fudge turns out too soft, just add more chips next time (or less s.c. milk, but adding extra chips is easier!).  This is definitely going on my regular holiday fudge set!

The 9 x 13 pan is too large-the "fudge" was too soft, not like real fudge at all. If I hadn't lined the pan with foil, I would not have been able to get it out of the pan and cut it. I will not make this again.

So easy & very tasty! I used butter flavoring & vanilla extract because I didn't have the rum. I made this a 2nd time with peanut butter morsels instead of the vanilla - DIVINE!

This is very easy to make. The only thing is that a 9x13 pan is too big. You need to use a 8x8 or 9x9 pan. I loved the flavor of the butterscotch chips and the rum extract, it is very good.

GREAT!! I changed it a bit.  I used a whole bag of white choc. chips.  I melted all the chips and 1/4 cup butter in microwave, heating for 30 sec., stirring, repeating until melted. Ten I added to sweetened condensed milk.  I heated it to 234 degrees F. (it was boiling).  It turned out AMAZING!! everyone loved it (it was a bit sweet, but we like that :])

This did not set up at all.  I even tried putting it in the freezer to harden but it didn't help.  It's as soft as caramels.  I think it tastes good as well as everyone in my family but it is very sweet.  I don't think we'll be making this again.  I would if it had come out like fudge consistancy but not since it didn't...

This is a delicious fudge, although it didn't harden up as I expected even in the refrigerator.   I've made a variation of it (from a Rachael Ray recipe) using chocolate and peanut butter chips, a can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.   The variation sets up almost immediately, literally in under five minutes.   And I've never "boiled" the variation recipe..  The obvious difference between the two variations is one additional teaspoon of flavoring.   Butterscotch is my BF's favorite so I'll have to play around with this to see what will work best.

ETA:  This year I cooked the mixture longer (gentle boil) and it set up much better.

Very easy but way to sweet.  I used an 8x8 pan and it came out just fine.  Would possibly make again but need to add some nuts to make it less sweet.

Good, but VERY sweet!  It's a diet-friendly dessert simply because you can't eat much more than a 1" square without getting a tummy ache.  Like other users, I didnt think it set up too well.  It seemed to stay soft and made a mess if left out at all.  I'm not sure if I'll add this to my fudge plate this year, but possibly if people request it.

Too sweet, too rich, and too much of a mess.  It would not set up the way it should and came way too soft to even cut.  I even tried putting it in the freezer for a little while.  I tried two batchs and definitely will not try this one again. I would have given a 0 rating if I could, but that wasn't an option.

Perfect go-to recipe for the holidays! I live at over 6500' elevation and this recipe turns out perfectly "as is" every single time I make it! I have used rum flavoring and vanilla when I didn't have butter flavoring. I have also made it with all vanilla chips when I didn't have butterscotch chips. Everyone raves about this and it turns out perfectly every time! In a 9 x 13 pan you will have nice thin slices of fudge. If you want thick slices, I recommend using a much smaller dish.

This was my first try at fudge and so I thought I may have done something wrong in the prep.  If I had of read the information regarding no fail fudge I may have had better luck.  I do like the taste of it and will try it again with taking it to 234 degrees for the proper consistency.

I also thought the pan size was too large. I used a smaller pan, and added crushed pecans. It was great.

I make fudge every year, and this year wanted to do something other than the traditional chocolate fudge.  This recipe was a mistake.  I did not like the flavor or the texture.  In fact, this almost went into the trash after I sampled it.  I won't be making this recipe again.

This fudge is INCREDIBLE!!!  So easy with awesome results!  Smooth texture with a nice balance of butterscotch and chocolate. This one will definately be made again and again!

Amazing! Super easy and the family loved it! I would have used a smaller pan next time so it could be thicker.

Just a bit too sweet and rich with the added rum and butter flavoring.

I made these, then decided to play with the recipe ( what chef wouldn't tweak a recipe for quality product?). I substituted milk chocolate and dark, then also used reese's PB chips and chocolate, then tried white and PB chips. All of them work in this recipe, and only took some minor adjustments. Feel free to contact me for the variations, if you'd like to know how to do what I did!

Followed exactly with reviews.  Took it to 234 degrees and after it cooled was more of a taffy-like consistency and tasted awful.

Didn't set into a firm fudge.  Needs to be cooked longer.

I thought this was a really easy fudge recipe. I watched it close and brought it to a boil to make sure it set up. I put it straight in the freezer and it turned out to be a really good fudge consistency. After making it once, I would like to use different flavored chips...the white chocolate and butterscotch combination was very sweet.
