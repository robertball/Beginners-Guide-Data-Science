This is delicious! I didn't use cooking sherry, instead I used 1 1/2 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar and 1 1/2 Tbsp of water. I also used Swiss Chard in place of the spinach. This was so good! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Just finished eating these stuffed tomatoes for dinner.  It was DELICIOUS!  I didn't have any cooking sherry so it was the only ingredient I was not able to use.  I cooked everything else exactly like the recipe calls for, and the result was pretty good.

I received a bunch of tomatoes from a client of mine and was looking for a recipe that I could use them in.  I picked this recipe because I had everything on hand.  It was very good.  My boyfriend loved it, I thought it was good but not as good as he thought.  I would definitely make it again though.

This was really good, rich in flavor and color, also, I had a little cottage cheese as a side and it went well with it.

I made this as written with the exception of the egg. This is easy to put together and would be great for dinner any night of the week or when we entertain. It seems like more work than it really is!

I really, really love this dish.  It's quick and easy to pull together, and it made the perfect lunch.  We'll be having this often.

I added a little bit of cheese (vegan parm and vegan cream cheese) just for interest. Simple to customize with your own spices, too. I used the biggest grape tomatoes I could find so they could be cute little apps. As a vegan it's nice to be able to sub in vegan proteins and cheeses and have a great result when recipes are as simple and straighforward as this one.
