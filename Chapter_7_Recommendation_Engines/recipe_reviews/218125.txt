What a delicious cupcake! Very moist and soft. I didn't have strawberry extract so I just used vanilla. I found some delicious homemade strawberry jam at the farmer's market and used that instead of raspberry jam. Instead of beating the jam into the batter, I folded 1/4 cup in before placing into the cupcake pan. This way it it has streaks of jam running through. After baking, i took a knife and took a little hole out of the middle then  I warmed up the other 1/4 cup of jam for 10 seconds in the microwave and filled each cupcake. My peanut butter frosting I used 1/2 cup butter, 1 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1 1/2 cup pwd sugar, and 3 tbsp of heavy whipping cream.

My cakes unfortunately turned out a little drier than I like.  However, the girls at the Casino loved them.  I filled each one with strawberry jam to moisten them up a little.

Super moist! I used about half the icing sugar for the frosting and had more than enough icing for the batch.I also substituted strawberry extract for vanilla. Delish!

This peanut butter frosting is to die for if you love peanut butter! (I couldn't keep my boyfriend out of it). I split the batter into two and made half with strawberry jam and half with blackberry jam, made 10 of each with smaller cupcakes. As others have said this is a very dense cake not like a regular cupcake. I found after baking and tasting that there wasn't enough of the jam flavor for me so I cut out small holes in the middle of the cupcakes and added a little of the jams to give them more flavor, then frosted. THESE WERE A GREAT HIT (made them for my father-in-law on his birthday, he is a PB&J fanatic) Thanks for the recipe! :) I will make these again!

I LOVED these.  While it's sort of strange, it was a nice departure from the normal yellow/white/chocolate cupcake.  I made them with my grandmother's homemade strawberry jelly.  YUMMY!

Excellent recipe - came in second place in a cupcake contest with this recipe.  The cupcakes are nice and moist, the frosting is AMAZING.  Filled the cupcakes with strawberry jam and sprinkled crushed up potato chips on the top (it sounds gross, but I promise it's delicious!!).  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe.  I used the ingredients for 36 cupcakes, followed the directions to a T with the exception of the Strawberry Extract and instead used LORANN OILS Strawberry Flavor.  Cupcakes and frosting are not overly sweet, they were just right and together tasted like a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich.  Will make again!!

I made a double batch of these and took them to work, and they loved them! You must like peanut butter to enjoy these, the frosting definitely has a strong peanut butter taste. I couldn't find any strawberry extract at my grocery store, so I used raspberry instead. I stuck with the raspberry jam.

My co-workers requested grape jam, so that was substituted for the raspberry.  Turned out so good!  And I added an extra 1/4 cup of PB in the frosting and whipped it on high.  Turned out to be one of the best frostings I've EVER made or had.

Well, I only made the frosting, to use on my favorite chocolate cake, and it was great, got compliments all around.  I found I only needed 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, plenty sweet enough.  Also, it made the perfect amount for a 2 layer cake.

I made this for my children's birthday party, and everyone really loved them. I thought the PB frosting was amazing, and think it would taste really good on a chocolate cupcake. The berry cupcake was okay. Even with strawberry extract and raspberry jam, it didn't have a lot of flavor. And it was not a pink color; the batter was whitish, then the raspberry jam turned it a slightly red color. However, after baking it was a slightly purple/gray color. If it were a pink color and had more berry flavor it would have been better, but was all right.

I switched it around, used raspberry extract and strawberry jam. I found them way too sweet with the frosting, and kind of bitter (too much baking powder?) without. Kids ate them up, luckily, but I don't think I'll be making again - the next day had turned very gluey in consistency.

I only made the frosting. I overall thought this frosting was decent. It tastes delicious but it is a little too sugary. Also it is way too thick! It was very hard to frost with. The cupcakes did end up looking nice though.

These cupcakes really taste as good as I had hoped. Made a few tweaks though. I used vanilla extract instead of strawberry, and 4 cups of powdered sugar for frosting is just ridiculous. I used half and the frosting was more than sweet enough. Next time I might even use less. Really does taste like a sweet pb&j

I used splenda and sugar free blueberry jam.  I also doubled the jam and mixed it with the batter.  The cupcakes turned out blue.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the icing was disgusting.  I ended up eating the cupcakes plain.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best cupcake recipe I've ever followed. Makes for a perfectly moist and sweet cake that's complimented perfectly by the creamy peanut butter frosting.Don't take any shortcuts!Take your time and do everything from scratch to ensure that it tastes its best!

Yummy!  We used blackberry jam instead of raspberry jam.  Also added more milk (3 tbs. instead of 1) to frosting while adding powdered sugar.  My 5 year old son who is extremely picky ate the entire cupcake.  It's a fun recipe for the family and especially the kiddos!
