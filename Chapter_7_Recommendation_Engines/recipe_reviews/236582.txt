First let me start by saying I stopped liking fish a while back (not sure why) but I still like shrimp and crab. So I tried this recipe because my husband still likes fish. I really couldn't stop eating the sauce. I'm already pondering what type angel hair pasta to pour it over next! I think I got the wrong crab meat though I didn't get the jumbo lump (mostly because I'm cheap--but I did get real crabmeat still). It did make the sauce a little thicker, which I liked. I also cut up some baby bellas and added it to the sauce! I think this will be a new favorite in my house. I would def recommend it for guys trying to cook a romantic dinner for their lady.

Very good and easy to make. I added basil with the oregano and had to use canned crab. We donâ€™t get much fresh crab in Tn.

This recipe has so very much to offer, and when I followed the recipe I felt it was lacking just a few minor points.  First of all, be sure to season the fish well with all the seasonings.  We felt the sauce was lacking just a little, and when I looked at the package, it called for only mixing in ONE cup of milk.  I'd think that with the addition of the crab that maybe one more fourth cup would be more than plenty because it would give more flavor to the sauce.  Another thing was that there were no instructions as to where to add the lemon juice, so we just squeezed some over the top of the prepared dish.  I will make this again (especially when I have a little crab left over!) and try different things, but this would be a definite DO-AGAIN recipe!  Thanks for our dinner tonight!

Delicious! The perfect compliment to mahi mahi. I used half cream, half milk because I only had 2%, but it was amazing! Will definitely make this again.
