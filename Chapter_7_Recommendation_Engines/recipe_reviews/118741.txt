As written, this recipe is a 1, 8 hours was WAY too long, the peppers came out mushy. Instead of 8 hours, 2-3 hours  is perfect, that way the peppers are still firm.

I omitted the cheese on this dish to make a vegan/vegetarian, gluten free and dairy free potluck lunch dish. It was so yummy and the aroma whilst it was cooking was heavenly. Totally drool-worthy, thank you so much for a recipe that caters to a mixture of different dietary needs.

I put the mixture directly into the slow-cooker & then when i stuffed the peppers right before serving and baked them for 20 min. (350) Served them at a birthday party, everyone liked it. =o)
