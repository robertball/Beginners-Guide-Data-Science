Very good basic recipe -- and oh, so quick-and-easy!  -- and very edible, but nothing incredibly special (So sorry!).  The second time, I browned a pound of extra lean ground beef, sauteed fresh onion, bell pepper, celery, mushrooms, and a bag of frozen peas and carrots, and then added the sauce (Not Ragu).  I also took a step out of the Easy Spaghetti page and cooked the noodles with the sauce.  (I would give it 12*) :D
