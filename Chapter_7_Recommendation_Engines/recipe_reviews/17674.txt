This was the first loaf of bread I've ever attempted to make.  It was quite easy to do.  The bread was dense which is what I was going after for French toast. Cakey. On it's own, it's a bit bland.  Otherwise, very nice loaf.

WONDERFUL tasting bread and toast... Great texture. I used 1 TBS brown sugar and 1TBS white sugar. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and needed an additional 1/2 C or so of flour to get the proper texture. Thanks for this great bread recipe!!!  Paul

I found this to be a delicious, hearty bread.  My husband loved it.  It makes super sandwiches, slices very well, and has no yeasty taste whatsoever.  Toasting this bread brings it to life!  Try it with breakfast, with sandwiches, or as a bread with dinner - it's perfect anytime.  Highly recommended.

I'm thinking that this is one of the best loaves of bread I've ever made. The texture is awesome...nice and light and fluffy. However, I do agree that it needs added salt and sugar. I will add more of those next time and report back :)

This is a very simple white bread.  It made wonderful bread pudding and french toast but, on it's own, the flavor was a little bland for us.

I do not bake bread usually. Maybe I have baked bread 5 or 6 times in my life with varing results. I have been cooking for almost 60 years. I liked the looks of this recipe and, so, I baked this bread today. I only used 6 cups of flour (bread flour) because I felt it came together at 6 cups (I do not think I could have put in 7 cups) and used salted butter omitting the salt. It needs some salt. I am so pleased with this bread. It came out of the oven just perfect and the crumb is beautiful. It is a dense, toasting kind of bread and I will be making it again very soon. Next time I will use the dough hook on my mixer...much easier I would guess.

This bread tastes great and is perfect for a marvelous brunch. However it does take plenty of time to let the bread rise so make sure you have the time. I especially liked it right pout of the oven!! Yummy!!

I made this in the bread machine and it did NOT turn out to my satisfaction.  Way too dense, with a texture like cardboard.  Maybe my pitfall was in trying to make it in a bread machine, but I won't be using this recipe again.

I love this bread. We also for a little added flavor have been adding fresh basil (diced) to the dough and bake. Comes out with a nice basil smell and tastes amazing with some butter!

This bread was easy to make and rose in about 2/3rds the time with quick rise yeast. It has a wonderful soft, dense texture, but is lacking a little in the flavor department, a bit bland.

The taste of this bread is sort of bland but it goes well with some butter and I think it will make some kickin' sandwitches.  Very simple to make and bake, also gets hilariously big from gas expansion during the first fermentation stage.

This is fair,definately nothing special about it.The big thing I didn't like about this bread is that it tasted rather bland and I followed the recipe exactly.

I halved the recipe and increase the sugar and salt. It's great. But I expect it will be dense like photo. Is it bcos I let my 2nd rise more than 30 minutes? I tried Traditional White Bread from this site, I think the texture and taste were alike. I thought it would be different since it contains egg and milk. But it didn't. But after all, still a great recipe. And nutritious.

Yummy when toasted (Even days later!) and made into a sandwich. It's really bland on its own... it definitely needs toasting! I'll follow another reviewer's suggestions on increasing the sugar and the salt next time. It was nice and soft, but my dad thought it wasn't fluffy enough. I thought it was good though...

Very good for toast.  I made this, let it cool and hubs had cut and eaten part of the loaf before I could even do anything with it, so I guess that means this is a success! It's very easy, and I used Kosher salt instead of regular to see if that helped, since a lot of reviews commented it needed more salt.  Yeah, maybe, but a lot of breads are pretty bland--you don't want a flavorful bread if you want a bread to be good for pb and j sandwiches as well as meat sandwhiches.  It was  a good way to get rid of some milk.  thanks for the recipe!

I read all the reviews and took some adjustments into consideration. It is beyond me how it is even possible that less than 3 cups of liquid can support 7 cups of flour. I followed the directions to the T and after adding the first 3 cups of flour, the dough was already very dense. I tried adding the next 1/2 cup and had trouble kneading it. The other 1/2 cup was even worse to knead in. I finally gave up and placed it in the oven to proof. It stayed in there over night and barely rose the next day. I cut it in half and placed it in two loaf pans and returned it to the oven to proof again. No luck there either. Finally cooked it and it was so dense and bland. Will not make this again. Can someone tell me what I did wrong? My yeast was live and I followed the recipe exactly.

I cut the recipe in half, but still used 1 whole egg. I lightly brushed the top with salted butter. It turned out wonderfully! Very dense and tasty. I'll be making this one quite often.

Very dense, not much flavor and it got brittle pretty quickly.  Not in love with this one. 
*Changed it to a 3 star once I tried it as toast...it does toast pretty well and tastes good with butter. I just don't find much use for it as a sandwich bread like the author claims*

This was so simple to make. I actually used my Kitchen Aid in making it and had the prep work done in no time. Once out of the oven half the loaf was gone within 5 mins. 
The texture is very good not a heavy loaf at all. It reminded me of a cross between a heavier bread and Paska.

Just made it today. It says 7 cups of flour but I only needed 5.5. It's very fluffy and moist. Loved it. Good for sandwiches and toast.

Great recipe. Made a couple modifications: replaced the water and milk with acid whey (result of me making ricotta cheese) and used whole wheat flour. Wasn't sure how it was going to work, but came out delicious.

This is a good recipe.  I halved the recipe because I didn't need two loaves of bread. The flavor is delicious. It toasts beautifully.
I mixed in my stand mixer with a dough hook.
I use the bread proof feature on my oven for proofing.

For one loaf I made the following adjustments:
1 teaspoon salt,
1 pkg active yeast,
1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of sugar,
3 cups of all purpose flour,
1/2 cup of wheat flour,
1/4 cup of unslated butter,
1 cup of almond milk,
1 egg

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It disintegrated when I tried to cut it. It was bland and indistinguishable from most other white breads out there. As the name implies, I used it for breakfast, trying it out for our favorite breakfast sandwiches. I tried slicing it and the loaf just crumbled. I managed 4 sandwiches out of an entire loaf, and I wasn't slicing the pieces all that thick. Even when I toasted them, the bread continued to try to fall apart. Perhaps I did something wrong when I attempted this recipe, but I won't be making it again as no one in the house really cared for the flavor or the texture.

First time making bread.  This recipe was easy enough to follow, except for the part about stirring in the remaining cups of flour and beating well after each half cup.  I took that to mean- stir with a spoon (I used a wooden one) and then beat with a mixer.  Neither worked very well after about one of the remaining cups, so I dumped the dough out and kneaded in the remaining cups by hand.  I followed the ingredients exactly, and I can partially see what others have said about the bread being bland.  But I don't think it's bland enough to add anything.  I would make it again the same way.  About the yeast, I don't think it every became "creamy."  It just seemed slightly less watery.  Also, I only had one 9x5 bread pan, so I shaped the loaves by hand and baked them on a baking sheet.  I used parchment paper and sprayed on some Pam.   Everything turned out really well!  Great recipe!

Love love love this bread!!!! My son loved the aroma of the bread baking and we both just love the flavor, texture and the versatility of this bread! The dough was beautiful. It rose before the hour and again before the time in the loaf pan. Baked to a golden brown. Yummy!! Will be making this bread on a regular basis!! Thank you for the recipe!!

Good tasting bread.  Made the changes of the amounts of sugar and salt as others have suggested.  Was not as dense as I hoped.  As well, 45-50 minutes baking time was too long.   Pulled mine out of the oven at 30 min. and it still had a really crispy crust.  Made at an elevation of 2116ft.

My first time to make homemade bread. Made one loaf. I used about 3 cups of flour, 2 table spoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, and one pouch of fast acting yeast. I didn't use any eggs. This was amazing loaf of bread and my kids loved it! Thanks for the recipe
