A great alternative to candy!  Sweet, but not too sweet.

Great gluten free recipe with good variety of ingredients. I substituted dried cranberries for the golden raisins, and mixed nuts for the pecans, bc it was on hand. I also added 2 Tbsp flax seeds. I used less honey and added 2 Tbsp coconut oil. These are not sweet, but will provide a good energy boost before workouts. Thanks for sharing this, Sal.
