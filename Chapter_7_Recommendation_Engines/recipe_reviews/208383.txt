I was a little skeptical. I was afraid the Italian Seasoning was too much, but it is really really good. Will definetly make more.

This was very easy and tasty. I did not have tomato sauce on hand so I substituted with a can of crushed tomatoes which made it very soupy. I probably should have added some tomato paste to thicken it. I cooked some brown rice with it which was very good.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe. I cooked it without the potatoes, only because I didn't have any on hand. I also used canned tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh. To spice it up I sprinkled the chicken with lemon pepper, and added some garlic. I also used one can of garlic and oregano canned tomatoes with a no salt added can of tomatoes and a garlic and oregano tomato sauce, with a no salt added tomato sauce. turned out perfect!! Our whole family loved it.

Reminds me of Mom's! I served it over extra-wide egg noodles. Yum! Next time I will probably add add more crushed tomatoes (I used 2 cups) and more carrots too.

This was delicious and very easy.  I used southern style hash browns and canned petite tomatoes to make a little easier.  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I used a can of tomato soup. I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on the top when serving.  It tasted even better the next day.

this turned out a little thin - made it exactly as stated. served over mashed potatoes because i didn't have noodles on hand. maybe too much "water to cover"? added some barley (3/4 cup) to the remaining stew and it thickened up nicely after an hour. needs a little more seasoning than written. and, oops, i forgot to peel the tomatoes...

Very good! I used 1 can of tomato sauce and a quart jar of our own tomato sauce with tomato chunks. I added a bag of frozen Italian veggies. My husband and the kids loved it. And it made a really big batch. Thank you!

I must say my girlfriend and I were completely disappointed with this recipe. We found it to be totally bland even after adding extra spices. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Used a bone-in skinless breast and cooked on low for 5 hours. Tossed in a yellow bell pepper that I needed to use. Also subbed onion for approx. 4 green onions. Chicken was very soft and very moist.

I try my very best to prepare the recipes from this site exactly as written because, from my understanding, that's what ratings are for -- to let each of us know exactly how good each recipe truly is as it is written. With that said, I did prepare this one as written and I feel I'm being generous in giving it 3 stars. The only reason I gave as many as 3 is that I can see that with some modifications this can be a truly excellent dish!  My slow cooker needed no additional liquid added to keep the chicken covered during the entire 8 hours, thankfully. The resulting broth was thin and quite tasteless. Before making this I had the feeling that it was going to be quite bland -- and I was right. It had very little flavor. I do love the combination of vegetables and chicken but the sauce/broth needed a LOT of help. I won't use Italian seasoning in this when I make it again, but will substitute thyme and will also add other seasonings such as garlic powder or garlic salt, etc. 

I admit that once the cooking was done and I had sampled some of the broth, I did add a little sugar to brighten up the bland tomato flavor and threw in some garlic salt as well. Since I was making this to put up as freezer meals, I let it sit in a large bowl in the fridge overnight before dividing and freezing in portions. I decided to give it a taste the next morning beforehand and it was delicious and flavorful with the sugar & garlic salt having been added. So DO make this stew but do your own doctoring

This is a great soup, especially for the cold months.  I "doctored" it up a bit though, I used cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, pepper, and soy sauce.  All the spices gave it a bit of a bite but, was very, very good.  I will be making this again.  I served this with a loaf of french bread with garlic spread on it.  YUM!!!!

Pretty good recipe.  They family seemed to enjoy it.  I would give it a 3, but based on my family's response, I'll give it a 4.

Had to thicken up the sauce with cornstarch. Reasonably good and added some precooked broccoli and cauliflower to the mixture at the end as to make a stew.

It was good - with a few modifications. I used bone-in skinless leg quarters instead of breasts; substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, and didn't add any extra liquid. Also added a few cloves of fresh garlic, salt, and pepper. The consistency was that of a hearty chicken & tomato stew - no sides needed. Will make again!

I made it yesterday with just a few changes from the original recipe:

1. I made it on the stove instead of in a slow cooker.  Took about 4 hours instead of 7. 
2. I added 1 can of diced tomatoes in addition to the fresh cut tomatoes the recipe called for. 
3. I didn't peel the potatoes. All the vitamins are there :)
4. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and thighs - 5 pieces.

The chicken shredded beautifully and the sauce was a touch soupy - like a stew, but that's what I was looking for. I made some rice to go with it and my family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Outstanding meal ! Smelled up the whole house and we could hardly wait for dinner! Didn't have potatoes so I added a large cut up sweet potato.  Always looking for dishes to add tomatoes from my garden to. Added small pare toms and rich tula's with a red onion, made the dish very colorful. Threw in 2 chicken and 1 beef bullion cube and a large teaspoon of trader joe's 21 seasoning salute, a healthy dose of red pepper flakes, then omitted the bay leaf. Didn't add any water because I threw in 8 frozen boneless chicken legs first. Perfect, easy & yummy !!

Delicious and very healthy. Great to cook ahead of time and eat the leftovers. Might cut back on the potatoes a bit but that is the only thing I would change.

I tried this today, using what I had in the house. I used a drained can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones, and I added some chopped celery and cabbage. I used a packet of Good Seasons  Italian dressing instead of Italian seasoning.. gets away from an Italian flavor and encourages a little doctoring for a mild sweet and tangy mode. I added a little sugar and three times the red pepper flakes suggested. I served this in a soup bowl with crusty bread and butter. Hearty, comforting and yummy.

It was really good, but the picture looks like there are some added ingredients.  I left out the potatoes, my husband is trying to go lower carb.  I'll do again, but may add cabbage, peppers, etc.

Good, fast, easy recipe.  I made it without the red pepper flakes because I did not have any and it was definitely missing something.  Overall good recipe.

This a very good Italian-tasting stew. I used one tomato soup & one sauce. I also omitted the red paper flakes, just not a fan. I did not need to add any water, and there was just the right amount of broth. It did take a long time for the veggies to soften. Mine took a total of 7 hours of cook time. Would make again, just cut the veggies smaller.

I tweaked just a bit. Canned tomatoes drained. Dried herbs as I am out of Italian seasoning..After 6  hours on a low setting chicken fell apart and veggies were perfect. Rate this a family favorite.

I had much the same results as some other reviewers--too much liquid. So I added rice to soak it up. I probably won't make it again.

We found that it definitely needed salt, otherwise it turned out pretty good.

I made the recipe as directed and served with bread. I found it rather bland despite that I usually like this all these ingredients together.

I loved this! I made it exactly as the recipe states and it turned out fantastic. I didn't peel the potatoes or tomatoes (like others suggested) and it was fine. This is a great recipe to build on too, you could really toss in whatever veggies you have on hand. Next time I make it I will add mushrooms, whatever other veggies I have on hand, and a can of chick peas. I served it as a stew, but it would be great over rice or noodles as well. If you want a thicker sauce you'll need to add less liquid. Mine turned out a bit runny but since I served as a stew it was fine. You don't need to cover the chicken in liquid as the recipe states, I'm not sure why it says that. Great recipe.
