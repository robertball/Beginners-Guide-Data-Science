This tea is so good!!! I added some honey to it. I couldn't find fresh Lemon Verbena so I used the dried kind and it worked perfectly  well. I doubled the quantities as I made a cuppa for my hubby. I'm sure I'll be  making this tea again and again. I think it would make a  really good iced tea too.
