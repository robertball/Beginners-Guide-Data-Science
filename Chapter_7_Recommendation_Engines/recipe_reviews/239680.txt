This was unbelievable !!!!!!!
I think the Queso (cheese) sauce totally made this.

The flavors are so delicious that I really don't want to make another Mac and cheese ever again.

The red peppers (pre-cooked) add some color, in addition to their sweetness is genius.

I also put the ingredients into a casserole dish and topped with some bread crumbs and baked until golden brown, as hubby likes it.

It was so creamy still even after that.

Delicious and easy.  Used what I had - green pepper, grape tomatoes, onion, shredded Mexican cheese blend from Costco, seasoned minced garlic from jar.  Stirred sautéed vegetables and lightly cooked pasta into soup and cheese with small can of evaporated milk and splash of water.  Baked in casserole dish topped with panko breadcrumbs drizzled with melted butter, sprinkled with dried cilantro.  This is a real winner.  Even looks great.  Love the new Latin inspired Campbell's soups.

Pretty tasty! Couldn't find the soup in the recipe at the store so I  improvised and used the regular cheddar soup and grilled the poblanos and added at the same stage as the shredded cheese. Will make again

It was pretty good. Husband enjoyed it more than me. He said it was a four star I thought 3.5. Couldn’t find the soup for it so used a Poblano pepper. Then we added bread crumbs and baked it in the oven. Seemed like it was missing something. But will definitely make it again and maybe tweak it more

Can't get the Campbell's poblano soup in Canada so I added a cup of whipping cream, a cup of chicken stock, 1 chopped jalapeno and four shakes of cayenne pepper powder.  Also needed to add lots more salt to get good flavour.  It was nice and creamy and delicious but I imagine it would've been even tastier if I'd had the soup.

It was pretty good. I think it could use more different types of cheese.

I followed this recipe as written.  I tried it.  It still needed something.  I added more cheese and baked it with bread crumbs on the top.  It is a fine recipe but both my husband and I thought it tasted like Tuna Casserole without the tuna.  I do love the Creamy Poblano & Queso soup.  I have used it in other recipes that call for a "cream of" soup and prefer it to all others.
