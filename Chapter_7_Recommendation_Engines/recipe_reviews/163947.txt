I made this as a side dish, so I excluded the chicken and added a few more ounces of pasta. I also used canned green beans instead of the broccoli and added the cheese in with everything. I added italian seasoning as well. Topped the dish with seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with a little melted butter...I also added a little garlic to the breadcrumbs. We really enjoyed it! Super easy and will make again!

This is very quick and easy. I made it with double the noodles and just added  little extra milk. I also mixed unseasoned breadcrumbs with melted butter and sprinkled on top for a little crispiness.

Quick and a hit with the kids!  I doubled this recipe and filled a 13x9 pan.  I added approx 3/4 cup of sour cream and topped with a combo of melted butter mixed with a 1/2 sleeve of ritz crackers.

Pretty bland, but unobjectionable.  Very family friendly.  It doesn't say what size dish to use, but I used an 8x8 pan.  I mixed the cheese in with the pasta so I could add a cracker topping, which the kids like.

I added some salt and onion powder to the mix.  I accidentally added the 1/2 cup of cheese to the mix then topped it with more cheese. I liked it. My 2 year old loved it.

So yummy! I modified a bit. I added some sour cream, Cayenne, Paprika, and I topped with crushed Ritz crackers. I also mixed the cheese throughout and just added a little to the top along with the crumbs. It was so simple! I will definitely make it again with my small changes

I used left-over cajun chicken. This was okay. A little boring but quick and easy.

I loved this recipe for the quickness, and it's easily customizable too.  Definitely need to add more spices than what is called for to liven it up.

LOVED this! I addend onion, green peppers and diced tomatoes. I also sprinkled dried crushed hot peppers over the top of the chicken, to make it a bit spicy, useda mix of mozzarella and colby cheese and topped it all of with breadcrumb/butter mixture. It was AWESOME! Next time I will also top with black olives and serve with sour cream.... Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe

As written, this is very bland. On that note, it is a great starter recipe to add ingredients according to your family's tastes.

This tasted o.k. My husband liked it and the kids ate it, so for a bunch of picky eaters, that's a plus. I made a few changes: I added dried chopped onion, used mince garlic, added cubed ham instead of chicken. Then, I sprinkled the top with Stove Top Savory Herbs stuffing mix, just before adding the cheese.

I doubled this recipe and added a bit more seasoning.  I substituted 1 can of chicken noodle soup and a little sour cream, plus I added a little swiss cheese with all the chedder.  I thought this recipe was extremely bland, but it may have been due to the extra ingredients I added. It really needs onions and more cheese for sure.

The flavor was a bit off, and awfully bland. However, the simplicity of the recipe is great! I might try KelbelleDesigns' suggestion of adding some melted butter and breadcrumbs if I make it again.

Hubby loves this! Easy and fast...good...but not low fat by any means.  I did cream of mushroom and fresh asparagus. It cooked to perfection. Very good.

We reeeeally liked this one. It really hit the spot. I did change a couple things: I added 1/4 cup more milk, 1/2 tsp more pepper and 1/2 tsp more garlic powder; not because it needed them, but only because we like the extra pepper & garlic flavors. I also mixed melted butter with seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled it on top. Came out awesome! Definately going on our "regulars" list........Michelle

I doubled the recipe.
Used one can cream of chicken, one can cream of mushroom
Added: 1 cup sour cream, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 cup mini peppers (sauteed), about 1/2 cup grated Italian blend cheese to the mixture
Topped with colby jack grated cheese and paprika, baked for 20 mins, then added crunchy onions to the top and baked for additional 10 mins.

Just needed a bit of salt to make it perfect.  Bonus - kids loved it.

I made this per the instructions. It lacked flavor all-around. I did not like it. There are so many other recipes similar to this one that I won`t try to figure out how to make this so that I like it.

This recipe was great. The only thing that I did differently was use 1 cup shredded cheese (mixed half cup into the pasta mixture and sprinkled the other half cup onto the top).

Made alot of adjustments. Used Broccoli Cheese soup instead (didn't have Cream of Chicken on hand), added about  1/2 cup leftover cooked Quinoa, about 3/4 cup leftover cooked sprouted bean trio, 1/2 sliced cooked mushrooms and more spices. Used about 1 tsp. pepper, about 1 tsp. of garlic powder and threw in Tony Chachere's seasoning to taste-about 1/2 tsp. or more.  Because of the added protein of Quinoa and  beans, I only added half of the cooked noodles the original recipe called for. Put in baking dish, sprinkled with plain bread crumbs and then sprayed bitter flavored cooking spray over the crumbs (it's all about cutting unnecessary fat). Mo need gor added chefdar cheese (again citting the fat). Baked as recommended. Eating it now and it tastes pretty pretty good!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was simple to make. I added some extra garlic, onion & Italian seasoning to make it a bit more flavorful.  I substituted fresh broccoli for the frozen, used 12 oz of pasta. Which made it seem a bit dry when I mixed it up so I added an extra can of soup which made it perfect.

This turned out delicious! I added some mushrooms and some extra milk. Everyone in my family loved it. Thanks!
