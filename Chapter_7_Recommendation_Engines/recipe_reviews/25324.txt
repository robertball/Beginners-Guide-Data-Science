Just tried this recipe and loved the ease and speed of preparation. The self rising flour is very important. I didn't peel the potatoes which gave the dumplings a less smooth texture, which we like. For our german dinner party this week I'll add some spices. The meal was great. We'll fry the sliced leftover dumplings for breakfast. 
My mother used to add a cube of Salami, instead of the croutons. It was the surprise for us, since meat was scarce in those days.

I made this recipe to go along with a Goulasch recipe I recently acquired.  I was trying to recrete this dish I had in a German restaurant that was Goulasch with potato dumplings.  The recreation wasn't anything like the restaurants but my husband LOVED it and even my picky four year old pronounced it good.  I didn't have any mashed potatoes so I baked four potatoes, scooped the insides out and put them in the refrigerator to chill for about 20 min.  Instead of a crouton in the center I just fried a slice of white bread in butter and used a piece of it for the center of the dumpling.  As far as I can tell this added nothing to the dumpling and unless it was added becuse the potato may otherwise be raw in the center...it was unneccessary.  I hd to use about 1/2 cup more flour than in the recipe must because the dough was sooooo sticky...it took more flour to get the dough off of my hands, formed and dumped into the gulasch.  I also used to eggs instead of one. I put my dumplings directly in the Goulasch I was making (essentially a beef stew) and cooked them for approx. 20 min.  They turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. I used baking potatoes because they seem to work well for homemade gnocchi too. And I think the crouton in the centre keeps the dumpling from being raw in the middle after cooking? Not sure but these are yummy with homemade chicken broth. Thanks.

These came out wonderfully, even though I used less broth than I should have. I made them to go with the traditional sauerbraten recipe so didn't cook them in the same pot as the roast. 

I don't use self-rising flour as a rule, so you can use 1 cup of regular flour plus 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt to make your own.

This is my staple dumpling recipe. The only thing I do different is instead of croutons I was always taught to take slices of bread soaked in milk that you tear up and throw into the mixture. My husband prefers that I season mixture with salt, pepper, and cayenne. You will never go wrong with these dumplings!

My dumplings turned out soggy. Most were falling apart in the broth. Maybe more flour next time?  Less cooking time? more?
It was good enough that I'll keep modifying until I get it right!

Great taste, but the dumplings fell apart (must have been my fault).

This is a wonderful recipe and very similar to the ones my mother and grandmother made.  Be sure not to cook the dumplings too long or they will become soggy and fall apart.  After they dumplings rise to the top of the water or broth boil them for 8-10 minutes depending on the size.

First time I have ever made potato dumplings and they were excellent! Very easy to make.  Just like the ones from the German resturant that I love.  I served them with Beef Rouledan and it was a perfect pair.

I made this to go with Wiener Schnitzel; I loved the crouton and chicken broth flavours, it worked out well. I wasn't sure how big to make them or how to form them (mine kind of turned into balls, and less like real dumplings?). There were a few people who weren't fans, but there were others who loved it. I guess it's not for everyone, but It was certainly a change :)

Excellent recipe. Just like my grandma used to make. My only addition to the reviews, because I always read them before I make a recipe is that if you don’t have self rising flour, and use all-purpose, don’t forget to add baking powder and salt!  I just made that mistake, and the texture is not quite right, but the flavor is still good!

Made these a few times now. I've even used leftover mashed potatoes. Just add extra flour so they're not runny and stick together. I haven't used the crouton. But will try that next time
