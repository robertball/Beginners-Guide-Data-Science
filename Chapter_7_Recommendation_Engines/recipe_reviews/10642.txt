These cookies were a big hit at my Cookie Exchange party.  I used Rolos, and I did notice that the cookies were much better warm than when they had cooled...  Rolo caramel is a little hard and chewy, and I imagined cookies with gooey, runny caramel in the middle, not stiff taffy-like caramel.  I have a friend who made a batch of these using 4 different things:  Hershey's Treasures (caramel, of course), plain caramels, mini Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, and Milk Duds.  She said that they were all fantastic, so I would suggest experimenting until you find the candies that are most appealing to you!  I also wanted to mention that I made the first half of the cookies without refrigerating the dough at all, and then I made the second half after the dough had been refrigerated for several hours, and I have to say that the room temp dough was much easier for me to handle.  It was very pliable, while the refrigerated dough was crumbly and hard to work with!

I decided to make these last night for a family reunion coming up-I read ALL 130 reviews before starting and was prepared to do battle with sticky dough and a time consuming process.  Well, I had ZERO problems making these cookies.  I did a couple things different from the recipe.  #1  Add 1/2 tsp salt.  Those who stated the cookies are somewhat bland without the caramel, it is because there is no salt in the dough.  #2.  Add 1/4 -1/2 cup more cocoa-they are delicious with this, and it makes the dough less sticky.  #3 PARCHMENT PAPER!  Use it on the cookie sheets-even the cookies which "exploded" were fully contained on the paper.  I cooked the cookies for 10 minutes-mine hardly spread at all.  Then cooled for 5-10 minutes on the tray and slipped them right off onto cooling racks.  Not one single cookie leaked through the cooling rack.  Also, my dough sat out at room temp the whole time-I put it in the freezer for 15 minutes while I unwrapped the candies (which by the way, I used Riesens-much better than Rolos) - I baked them on and off for 4 hours and I did not need to chill the dough.  I made a DOUBLE batch of these-I think they awesome and very easy!

This is an EXCELLENT cookie! They turned out wonderful!!! I read all of the advise of the other reviewers. I added an extra 1/4 c. flour and 1/3 c. cocoa and added 1/2 t. salt, and left out the nuts in the dough. I used parchment paper, and let the cookies cool on the sheet. I chilled the dough for about a half hour before starting. I had no problems with the dough being sticky, I found it easier to work with as it warmed up a little. I formed the dough into little bowl shapes in my hand and put the candy in the middle, working the dough around it, getting rid of any excess. I used as little dough as possible and got close to 80 cookies out of this recipe! No problem with leaking, just work the dough around the candy really well. I used rolos and 1/2 peanut butter cup, and they are both wonderful. I baked for 7 minutes, and they are still soft. This is a time consuming cookie, but well worth it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Part drop cookie, part chewy brownie, 100% fabulous!! Could not find Rolos at my grocery store, so used the caramel-filled Hershey's kisses with great results. For those who find the dough too sticky and difficult to work with, keep a small dish of water close by your work area, and dip the tips of your fingers in the water, shaking off excess, before molding the dough around the candy piece. The dough won't cling to your fingers then, and it makes refrigerating unnecessary. Be sure not to overbake, and make sure you calibrate your oven, because unless the temperature is accurate, you won't get the endorphin-inducing chewy chocolate fix you crave. I skipped the nut/sugar dip because I wanted to finish them another way. Although it was unnecessary for texture or flavor, I frosted them for looks, making these "Triple Threat Fudge Cookies" as I billed them. Nice frosting that sets up unsticky in about 2 hours: Mix together 3 Tb soft butter, 3 Tb unsweetened cocoa powder (I used Hershey's), a pinch of soda, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 Tb light corn syrup, and 1 cup powdered sugar. Added in, tsp by tsp, enough milk to make it spreadable. Frost cookies while still a little warm (about 8-10 minutes after removing from oven.) I got rave reviews all around, with one fan giving them a "10 on the swoon meter." Thank you for the phenomenal recipe.

These cookies were a hit with everyone who tried them.  I used Caramellow bars for my chocolate caramel in the center.  It was perfect.  I bought 3 large bars, each bar gives you 18 squares.  They were the perfect size for wrapping the dough around.  The caramel is very gooey and the cookies were scrumptious and very rich.  YUMMY!

Update 12/2005-I made these again this year and the first batch used 1/2 butter & 1/2 butter flavored Crisco. Forgot to do so for 2nd batch - the 1/2 and 1/2 works MUCH better & holds shape! Also used the Hershey Caramel Kisses this year & they were great too!
************
Killer cookies!  Although I meant to add the extra flour/cocoa - I forgot....I did use 1/2C butter crisco & 1/2C butter. Also used the Milky Way caramels because I couldn't fathom opening all those Rolo candies--Milky Way carmels are fast to open.  I split the dough into 4ths, put 3 in fridge and immediately used 4th - no problem with stickiness (maybe it was the Crisco?).  I found it best to cover the carmel starting at the bottom of candy and press up towards top. Not a single one leaked.  These cookies will go on the "make for cookie tray gifts" list!

excellent cookie! I used rolos and put the candies in the freezer for a couple of hours. The caramel didn't ooze out while baking.

These were a hit at my family reunion. They taste a bit like a turtle brownie. I tried both Rolo's and Hershey's Caramel's with a chocolate center...sorry I can't recall the exact name. I preferred the Hershey's. Rolo's didn't hold up as well as the Hershey's did. I also drizzled the cookies with melted milk chocolate after they cooled a bit. YUM!

My sister and I really liked these cookies.  My husband thought they were just average.  Unlike other users, I did not think they were that difficult to make.  It is alot easier if you coat your hands in cocoa before working with the dough.  I tried Rolos, Snickers, and Reese's Peanut Butter cups, and thought the peanut butter cups tasted the best... but they were all good. I will definitely make these cookies again.

Great cookie, but not original. This recipe has been around since forever, and is a standard in my Christmas cookie baking. People are always pleasantly surprised to bite into that caramel filling!

These were unbelievable straight from the oven, (weren't as good after they cooled)!  I reheated them in the microwave for 10 sec to warm them back up to goodness before eating.  They taste a bit like a turtle brownie, and can't imagine making these without nuts on top as it was an excellent texture contrast.  I added 1/4 c more flour, 1/4 c more cocoa powder, and 1/2 tsp salt (most cookies have some in them).  I used plain caramels.  I didn't use any of the nuts in the actual batter, for fear of getting the dough smooth around the candy.  I used greased baking sheets, but parchment paper would be better.  I didn't have much problem with the bottoms coming out, but you can easily remove the paper for cooling.  Damp hands helped with the rolling part. I preferred using room temp dough, the cold dough had to thaw in order to spread anyway.  I made a ball, stuck the caramel in, and worked it up around the candy.  If you like a fluffier cookie, put these in the fridge for 15 min or so before baking.  I let these cool 5 min, then transferred to cooling racks, and some of them bottomed out.  I would leave on the baking sheet or parchment until completely cool.  Mine needed almost 10 minutes to get firm enough bottoms so that they would hold up.  Hope this helps!

This recipe is Definately a keeper on my Christmas cookie list! I used Milk Duds and black walnuts & they were amazing! Milk Duds don't create a layer of carmel like shown the picture, but still soft, chewy & delicious! Next time will try review suggestions of Carmel Kisses & 1/2 peanut butter cups. Thx for a great recipe!

Followed others suggestion in adding flour, cocoa powder and salt and they were very good.  I had only  4 that broke and I think it was the store brand chocolate caramel cups I bought.  Rolos were nice but the best were the peanut butter cups.

One of our favorite cookies at my house. We use the Dove Carmel-filled Chocolates. This year, I sprinkled some high-quality Sea Salt on each cookie after rolling in sugar (just a sprinkle!) and it is truly divine!

We love these!  I did follow other recommendations and did the following: added 1/2 tsp salt, added 1/4 cup more cocoa, used PARCHMENT PAPER and cooked the cookies for 10 minutes and cooled them for 5-10 minutes on the tray and slipped them right off onto cooling racks, I just cooled them in the freezer for 15 minutes and used Riesens.

A whole lot of work, but people will beg for more. I used Dove chocolates which are more cookie-shaped than Rolos so I think that helped it not ooze when baked.

Very good and pretty easy to make.  If you cannot find chocolate covered caramels, you can substitute Kraft Caramels.  I tried them whole, halved and in thirds and halves worked best.

I tried several caramels for my batch. If you use Nestle Treasures, they will cut down quite a bit the number of cookies you will make because they need so much dough to wrap around the candy. There are christmas candies out called "Milky Way" caramels. (I found mine in the candy isle at Walmart) they use a bit of dough as well, but I found them the most tasty.  Also, there is a bag of rolo's in the regular candy isle at Walmart, that has at least 75 in it. ,,,,, I personally like the Rolos. The cookie is so rich that it really is just the right size with a Rolo.  Also, if you overcook the cookie, the caramel will melt outside a little.. It tastes just as good.
They are a chewy-fudgy brownie like cookie. Great for Santa to have with a cold glass of milk!

My 8 year old and I made these and everyone LOVED them!  We'd never made from scratch cookies before and was really surprised at how well they turned out.  Will be keeping this recipe!!!

I used Rolo candy and  rolled these in red sparkling sugar instead of nuts for a Christmas cookie exchange and they were a huge hit! They were not hard to make at all. Yum!

Just finished baking these and they turned out great!!!   I cut down the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.   Really don't need all that sugar especially with the sweet caramel in the centre.  I also cut down the cocoa from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup and they were still chocolate enough.  Scoop some dough on a spoon, put the caramel on the dough and blop some more dough on top of the caramel and form into as much of a ball as you can then place them on the cookie sheet, that way is easier and not as messy.    I will definately make these again.

After trying several different kinds of candy with these I would recommend mini peanut butter cups, I used Walmart brand, and the small York peppermint patties. I tried Nestle's treasures and used all but the caramel variety after I found that they leaked out onto the cookie sheet. I left out the nuts, didn't chill the dough the first time I made them but did the next time and didn't see much diffence. I put a hunk of dough in my hand and another on the candy to make a kind of sandwich, then I just rolled the whole thing between my palms to make it round. It covered the candy almost every time. I did use 1/2 tsp of salt with unsalted butter and 1/4 tsp with the salted kind. Another time I might dip the top of the unbaked cookie in chopped nuts or drizzle some frosting on top to dress them up. Be sure not to overbake them. It will depend on your oven but I'd start with seven minutes and see if that is enough, a good reason to sample as you go.

Oh man, these were super! I used Riesen chocolate covered caramels and did not do the nut thing, but sprinkled with powdered sugar instead. Thanks Lisa!

This is a fabulous cookie recipe!  The cookies were moist and chewy.  I used a no-name brand of chocolate covered caramels from Wal-Mart and they turned out great.  The caramel was nice and soft inside.  I am going to use this recipe for this year's cookie exchange.  The only thing I did was omit the nuts.

I followed the advice of the other reviews and added an extra 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 c. cocoa.  For the middle, I tried rolos and also Hershey's chocolate creme filled caramel classics.  They pretty much tasted the same to me and my husband, so I opted for the caramel classics, since they were cheaper :)  I used an 18/10 gauge cookie dough scoop, which made a lot more than 48 cookies, and made assembly really easy too.  If you make the cookies this way, don't refrigerate the dough since it gets too hard, but just take a scoop of dough, press the caramel into the center and seal it in.  I didn't add any of the nuts into the dough, I only dipped the top and it seemed like there were plenty of nuts.  I did have a bit of a problem with them falling off though, maybe I didn't press them into the top far enough.  I also lined my sheets with parchment paper and baked for 10 minutes.  Wow, great cookies though!

I figured out that it was much easier to put dough balls into a mini muffin tin. I baked for 7-8 min then pressed caramel filled Hershey's kisses into the top. I didn't even need to put them back into the oven- the heat from the cookie made kiss nice and gooey.

This is an excellent recipe!  I have made one similar and this is much better (the other one used prepared cookie dough).  As for the caramel center, I highly recommend the Junior Caramels (put out by the same company that does Junior Mints).  They are small, round and soft caramels and I have yet to have any leak.  (an added plus is the low cost).

I thought this was a good recipe. I melted the caramels with 3Tbs of canned milk over low heat and let it cool while I mixed up the cookie batter. I also added a 3oz pack of chocolate pudding to the recipe. I then just scooped out about a tsp of the caramel and rolled it into a ball and rapped the cookie dough around it. This keeps the caramel a good  gooey consistency after they are cooled. I make fairly large cookies, so I use about 2 heaping Tbs of dough per cookie and use a spoon to put a small indentation in the dough and place the caramel in the center and push the dough up around it. The caramel doesn't come out of the cookie then.

These are great cookies!  I didn't let the sticky dough stop me, actually I made these Friday night when I had a house full of kids and it was hard to ward them all away so that I could get one!  I split the dough into 12, then into 24, smushed 1 piece down in my hand stuck a Rolo in the middle, topped it with another piece, rolled it and plopped it onto the sheet.  The kids all LOVED these, thanks Lisa.

This recipe rocks!  I doubled the recipe and kept it outside on the deck (25 degrees!) to keep it cold.  Would suggest more than 2 hours.  I found that the dough gets very sticky very quickly while making the balls; I solved this problem by sraying Pam on my hands.  I also won for the best tasting cookie!

Incredible!  These cookies are awesome.  If you don't sift the flour when you measure/add it, you won't have the stickiness problem.  I didn't even chill it the full 2 hours and had no mess at all.  We used Milk Duds and they worked perfectly.  Also omitted the nuts b/c of food allergies in the family.  They turned out great and we can't wait to try them with peanut butter cups!  Thanks again!

These cookies were very yummy.  However they were difficult to work with as the dough is very sticky.  So don't reinvent the wheel in this process, this is what I found to work.  Helpful Hints: First, I used a caramel nut cluster candy from Walgreens and had to half it, so I  did not use walnuts in my batch. But I think a Rolo would work better.  I did refrigerate the dough overnight.  As stated it was sticky, which made rolling the "ball" out difficult.  So I wised up after a few and coated my palms and fingers with margarine, which made it so much easier to roll the dough!  I didn't divide the dough up equally, I just scooped a golf ball size dough, split that in 1/2 then sandwiched the candy, then rolled into the ball.  When baking, spacing is key!  Don't place too close together, or it's a bear getting the cookies apart.  Also, don't use a cookie sheet that will warp when in the oven or all your cookies will slide together and you'll end up with a mess.  I found 8 minutes was not long enough to cook but I found 10 to be perfect!  Let cool on cookie sheet until the cookie sheet can be comfortably touched with a bare hand, but not totally cool, then transfer to wax paper, as any sooner the cookie just squished because it wasn't cool enough, and if I left it on too long the caramel that baked through was too hard and stuck to the pan, even with it greased.  So, that was my experience.  Now I know the tricks, I will make again!  Good luck & happy baking!

The only chocolate-covered caramel candies the store carried were Dove Promises, and they were expensive.  I found it very difficult to get 12 cookies out of each quadrant of dough.  There wasn't enough dough to really wrap around and cover the candy, and as a result, the caramel leaked out of the cookie. In reading the reviews, it looks like many people used Rolos, so maybe the Dove Promises are larger???  On the last batch, I made 8 cookies (instead of 12), and this worked out much better.  Taste is pretty good, but honestly, they didn't wow me as I expected.  I'd probably give these 3-1/2 stars if I could.  Sorry, I know this recipe has had great reviews, but I doubt I'll make it again.

amazing! so chewy and chocolately! don't change a thing... except maybe bake on parchment paper so they slide off and add a bit more cocoa powder so the dough is easier to work with.

Deeeelish! I was looking for a cookie I could easily make and take to a dinner date.  After seeing the rating this cookie had I knew I just had to make 'em.  Thanks to all the reviews I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 cup of flour and 1/3 cup of cocoa. I refrigerated my dough for only 30 min beforehand.  I used caramel filled Dove chocolates that I kept in the freezer prior to rolling the cookies.  When rolling I used a little water on my hands, as suggested, to keep the dough from sticking.  Also, I used parchment paper when baking... and I baked the cookies for 9 minutes. The cookies came out awesome!  I brought some to work to test out on people before my dinner date.  Looks like I'll be entering these in my office annual bake off.

this is on FABULOUS cookie! I tried using rolos, riesens, dove, and milky way "simply caramel". The milky ways were far and away the best to use. Good amount of caramel, and didn't get too hard after cooling. After I got the timing right for removing the cookies from the oven, they were perfect. Not under cooked,not hard, and didn't ooze.

Delicious cookies!!! My sister and cousin made them one night, and they said it took forver but it was worth the wait. They used regular caramels without the chocolate covering for the cookies and skipped the rolling in sugar part. They turned out to be very soft. They ended up having a ton of cookies but that wasn't a problem!

These were out of this world!  I was skeptical because of some of the negative reviews, but I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  After looking at similar recipes on other sites, I decided to up the flour to 2 1/2 c. and added 1/2 t. of salt.  I left out the nuts because my kids won't eat nuts, but left everything else the same.  The dough was incredibly easy to work with -- I didn't even need to chill it, perhaps because I keep a cool house in winter.  Regardless, the cookies turned out beautifully with no leaks whatsoever, and I'm eager to try this recipe with different candies.

I read all the top reviews for tips and found them immensely helpful. I don't like nuts so I added the extra 3/4c flour and 1/3 cup cocoa (however forgot the 1/2 tsp salt oops!) to the batter. I didn't put nuts in the topping either and just dipped them into sugar. I didn't cool the batter in the fridge nearly as long as suggested but did for maybe 20-30 mins and I felt it worked out fine. I used Presidents Choice chocolate covered caramels as well as their peanut butter cups for the centre and they worked out PERFECT. Gooey and delicious. I used parchment paper on my cookie sheet and didn't have a single problem, so I would recommend that as well. Cooked the exact time and let cool the exact time and they never dripped out at all. Will definately be making again.

I used caramel filled Kisses, and froze them unwrapped until I was ready for them.  I also only chilled the dough for an hour.  It seemed perfect then.  I did have some cookies leak while in the oven, but more than half seem to be fine.  I also put all the nuts in the dough, none on top.  They are very delicious, even if the caramel leaks out.  I will definitely make these again, but I might try a different caramel next time.

1 year later: This year, I decided to experiment a little with my candy choice.  I was really looking for a soft, gooey caramel, that's why I went with the caramel kisses last year, but there just wasn't enough caramel.  This year, I followed others suggestions and tried both regular caramels as well as rolos.  While the cookies were warm, a whole caramel in the middle was fantastic, but then gets chewy when the cookie is room-temperature.  Rolos were much less chewy at room-temperature, but still not quite what I was looking for.  I decided to try something completely different and put in mint truffle kisses.  Absolutely delicious!!!!  Before you even bite into the candy middle, you can taste the mint flavor that has slightly seeped into the rest of the cookie.  Then when you do get to the mint center, the mint flavor explodes in your mouth in perfect harmony with the chocolate of the cookie.  The green color in the middle makes the cookie look as good as it tastes. I might just stick to the mint kisses from now on.  I also skipped the nuts this year.

My first tray of cookies was very leaky, though I'd followed the directions exactly.  The second tray was more so, since I missed the timer going off while breaking up a sibling fight in the playroom . . . it really IS important to take them out after 8 minutes!  The next ones went much better, though.  I divided the remaining fourths of dough into 10 pieces (instead of 12), stuck the caramel kisses in the freezer for a bit, and pressed the candy into the balls of dough BOTTOM first, instead of pointy-end first like I'd done with the first two tries.  I think that helped cover the candy better.  And I was rigid about the 8 minutes, and left them alone on the tray for 6+ minutes to cool before transferring them to a cooling rack--only one leaked then, and not too badly.  These were a bit labor-intensive, but folks who like to make cookies usually enjoy the process, and it certainly wasn't tedious.  My children are thrilled with the end result, and I'm fairly certain we'll try them again sometime.

Jeepy creepies these cookies are good!!  Speaking as someone a bit cookie-challenged, it did take a bit for me to get the technique down - using enough dough so the caramel didn't seep out during baking, sticky dough (refridgerating really well is definately the key), but even the "mistakes" are yummy.  Next time I make these - and trust me, there WILL be a next time, I will take the advice of a previous reviewer and smush the caramels (I used Rolos) slightly so the fill the cookie a little better - instead of being one yummy surprise right in the middle.  Gotta go - all this talk about the cookies is making me want ANOTHER one!!!

Great recipe - the trick to these is to keep the dough cold and work with only small amounts of dough at a time and then they will turn out perfect!

These were awesome!  I didn't have much problem with the dough, eventhough it is quite sticky.  I used my small pampered chef cookie scoop with each cookie being 1 1/3 scoops.  I made the dough into the balls and then pushed a rolo into the center.  Next, I formed the dough up around the rolo till it was completely covered.  I didn't use nuts or sugar and they were still wonderful. I also used parchment paper, just in case any leaked.  Not one cookie leaked, but I still recommend the parchment paper.

These cookies are absolutely excellent!  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and and extra 1/3 cup of cocoa.  Instead of refridgerating for 2 hours, I put the dough in the freezer for about 20 mins;  To avoid the stickiness problem, I sprayed my hands with Pam and worked quickly with the dough.  I used generic carmel filled balls, and they worked great.  I ended up with a perfect round cookie.

These are insanely good!!  I mean sinfully so, really.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup cocoa but no salt.  I also used chocolate caramel Reisens and they worked very well.  With the first batch I did have some trouble with them running and making a sticky mess.  I only let them sit for the 3-4 minutes suggested.  After that I let them sit for 10 minutes and them picked them up by hand instead of using a spatula.  I found the spatula tears the delicate bottoms even when they have cooled quite a bit.  I also used Silpat liners which helped tremendously but if you don't have those parchment paper would be a real assest.  They still leaked but by letting them cool longer and transferring them by hand this was not a problem.  Then, by the time they cooled completely on the wire rack the caramel that had leaked was hard enough to not be a bother.  Leakage or not these are totally worth making!  I did not find them time consuming at all and, after chilling the dough for about 4 hours it did not stick to my hands.  Make these soon and enjoy!!

I only used 2 ¼ cups of flour that this recipe calls for and upped the cocoa by ¼ cup for a deeper chocolate flavor. I subbed toasted pecans for walnuts (toasting makes such a difference!) and added ½ t. salt as others have suggested. I used Rolos, which I had refrigerated; and during the unwrapping of the Rolos, I put the dough in the fridge. I baked them for 8:30 minutes exactly and they were perfect. Remember to NOT take them off of the cookie sheet too soon. I made this mistake and the caramel seeped through the cooling rack on ½ of my first batch. I ended up with 42 cookies, which I did drizzle with the vanilla coating. Even though I like the cookie better with the modifications I made, it's still a 5-star cookie!

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now, and this year I decided to try it out with different caramel filled chocolate candies. I tried large rolos, small rolos, caramilk bar squares, and reisen. While the rolos are good, the caramilk bar squares win out BY FAR! Although they seem awkward when you're trying to roll them in to a cookie, it's well worth it. The caramel is gooeyer and it doesn't leak out.

Followed the recipe exact except dipping the tops in sugar and it came out perfect. Was amusing to see peoples quizzical expressions when they got to the caramel part too.I doubled this and glad I did, the husband kept eating them before Christmas dinner! I also had to send some home with everyone, beggars! :) Dough was easy to work with once it warmed up in my hands a little bit and parchment paper is my new best friend, highly recommend trying it. Will make these again with Snickers! Thanks!

YUMM! I used Werthers carmel rectangles, and also tried these little tiny BB sized caramels made for melting that I found. They were also Werthers brand. I added an extra 1/3 cup of cocoa, as well as 3 one ounce chocolate baking squares that I melted with a bit of butter, and also added chocolate chips to the mix. I love chocolate! They turned out great with both types of carmel. Very chocolately and rich. Next I will try the milky way caramel bars and some other fun candies!

I found these cookies quite simple to make!  And very delicious!  I used Rolos, which were kind of a pain to unwrap, but worth it.  I put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes while I unwrapped the candies.  When it got warm, I just used cocoa powder on my fingers to make it less sticky.  Quite yummy!  Will most definitely make again!

This recipe was very time consuming. I put my candy in the freezer before-hand and the carmel still leaked through the cookie. Another problem that I had was that the cookies tended to roll onto another. They tasted just ok, not something out of this world. Sorry, but I won't be using this recipe again.

I found this recipe in a book a few years ago and everyone loves them.  i found that if you cool the cookies upside down for a few minutes then turn them over that the caramel does not run out..hope that helps because they are delicious cookies!

I made these at a candle party that I hosted- everyone loved them and I ended up having to make copies of the recipe for several of the ladies.  Thanks for this great recipe.  
PS.  I just used regular caramels (not chocolate covered) and they were still wonderful!

I really expected these cookies to be something special, but they weren't. The actual cookie part isn't as good as some of the store bought dough. The dough isn't "easy" to work with unless it's very very cold. 

I really love desserts, and I especially love anything chocolate. I'm easy to please, and I cook desserts quite frequently. I will not be making this again.

This is by far my favorite cookie recipe.  Friends and family go wild for them.  I recommend using Rolos as the center candy.

A friend wondered what it would taste like as a sugar cookie, so I tried it out.  I cut the sugar to 3/4 c each, and it was excellent.  Also, with either a chocolate or sugar cookie, I recommend cutting the temp to 350.  Pull it out as soon as it looks slightly done, as it will continue to cook on the sheet.  (usually about 8-10 in a gas oven)

I made using PB Cups, Lindt white choc pieces and Milky Ways - all came out tasting great. Only problem is that they do not look all that appetizing, brown globs, ugh. For the second batch I added slivered almonds to the top and dusted with confectioner's sugar. Next time I will swirl some frosting on the tops.

I made these cookies for my son's Christmas party and they were a big hit with the kids and adults as well.  The key to this recipe is - the dough has to be cold ... otherwise you will have a sticky mess. Allow time for wrapping candies. Great recipe. (Keeper)

I was invited to a Cookie Swap the other day and I had no idea what to make. So I checked out the recipes here and found this one. I LOVE this recipe. It tastes like a brownie with a caramel center. It was a huge hit and by far the best cookie at the swap!

Oh the agony of the first time you make these.  They are great-tasting but too time-consuming.  Thank heavens for the helpful hints by other reviewers.  DON'T take the cookies off the cookie sheet in 1 min. per instructions.  I left first batch on cookie sheet longer as someone suggested but it still wasn't long enough.  The caramel leaked from the rack onto the counter.  Let the cookies cool pretty well before transferring them.  I also recommend you follow the reviewer's suggestion to work with only 4 at a time out of the fridge.  I may experiment next time.  Why couldn't you put the ball into a miniature muffin tin and just shove the Rolo on top and sprinkle with the sugar/nuts mixture?

Great taste - worth the effort.  Make sure to freeze extras or store in air tight container tho - they go stale fast.

Added full cup of coco powder and a 1/4 cup more of flour kneaded with hands. And wrapped it around peppermint patties and sprinkled with candy canes. Loved them!

I hate to criticize someone's recipe so I'll just tell you what happened when I made these; I have two teenage sons that ate them. The oldest said, "Mom, what did you do to your cookies (I have my own special chocolate cookies recipe)? I said, "I found a similar recipe online that was highly rated and I love to experiment."  They both said, "Don't ever do that again mom, these cookies s...."  Sorry everyone. I agree they are disappointing.

Awesome cookies!  While a little labor intensive, I will try the muffin tin idea.

I used dark powdered chocolate to kick the chocolate flavor up a notch!  You can never have too much chocolate!

As a variation, I have put marachino cherry in top on some and pieces of pineapple on some.  Great basic chocolate dough

I have made these twice. The first time, I totally screwed it up by measuring an ingredient wrong and using plain caramels because apparently I can't read. The second time I added 1/2 tps of salt, which it definitely needed, even after my screw up the first time. I made half the batch with rolos and half the batch with milk chocolate chips mixed in. My husband thought the chocolate chips were just as good so I am sticking with those because it is easier. I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them on hand already and mixed it into the batter.

Very good alternative to the "ordinary" cookie.  I couldn't find choc. covered caramels, but just plain caramel in the center was still really good.  Mine did not rise as much as the ones in the picture, but tasted great.

I made these with reeses mini peanut butter cups and with dove milk chocolate covered caramels and though the cookie part was really good I was dissappointed that the candies did not melt and spread any. There was a big lump of candy in the center of the cookie. Good but too much in one bite. I wish they would have spread out better. Maybe if I had squished them down some and made them flatter...

I have been making this cookie to give to co-workers and family for more than 10 years and every year I get rave reviews.  I just discovered this year (while making some 150 of these) that using latex gloves on your hands prevents the dough from sticking and makes clean up a whole lot easier.

These were very good cookies but i would change the type of candy i used in the middle. i used rieson candys but the middle goes hard when they cool. i think i will try rolo's next time.

* Update *  I made these again and this time used Mini Reese peanut butter cups and chocolate covered caramels. Everyone seemed to like the peanut butter ones more. One hint for using caramel chocolates, make sure to cover the caramel completely with dough and have no thin spots or cracks; the caramel tends to seep out when the cookie bakes.

These cookies were the best cookies I've ever made.  I chilled my dough overnight.  They were so easy to make that my 3 year old daughter was helping me.  1 bag of Rolo's has about 54-56 pieces in it, so just grab one of those.  Don't over cook your cookies, I had two batches, one cooked for 10 min, one for 8 min.  The 8 min ones looked more "puffy" and cooled to be superiour in texture.  These cookies are just awsome.. if my cookie jar wasn't emptied of them last night, I'd be eating one right now.

I really liked the concept of these cookies, but they are too sweet for us.  Next time I'll cut the sugars to 3/4c each and add 1/2t of salt.  I substituted shortening for the butter and I'll do that again next time I try.  I didn't need to refridgerate to be able to roll these, probably due to the shortening.  I will certainly try these again, only with the sugar modifications.

These are my signature cookie!  I bring them to swaps and always send them to friends and family.  I make the recipe as written, except I omit the nuts.  I use rolo candies.  I've never had a problem with leaky caramels, but I would think that freezing the candies would help.  I use the medium size cookie scoop from Pampered Chef and they always turn out perfectly.

Sorry - if you had major trouble with these, I think you did something wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly (but baked at 365 instead of 375 because high temps with cookies are a no-no, at least in my high-altitude hometown).  The dough was pretty soft but held up fine after refrigerating . . . it flattens a little around the Rolos after baking, but mine were still quite cute, and all cookies sink at least a little bit.  Yum yum yum!  Everyone loved these and I'll definitely be making them again, for holidays and every-days.

This is definitely the best cookie recipe I have come across on this site!  I used Hershey's caramel filled kisses.  I only refrigerated dough for about an hour and had no problems whatsoever.  I used about 3 Tbsp. sugar with the chopped nuts for dipping the cookies into.  Just fantastic!

i made these at christmas and my cousins all begged for the recipe. They were gone in a flash!  
The dough definitely needs to be cold when wrapping it around the chocolates, but not TOO cold. I made my dough the night before, and baked them off the next day. Well the first cookies came out like little mountains because I had used caramel kisses and the dough was too cold to spread right (I hadnt let it warm up at all before baking). After that though, they came out great.

I've made this cookie for XMas that last 3 years and it is always a hit. As others have said...FREEZE the dough before working with it. I actually split the dough into 8 equal parts and only pull the piece out of the freezing that I need. Otherwise it is messy work. Another tip I learned, wrap the Rolo from bottom up to prevent the caramel from leaking. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

These are some WICKED COOKIES.I have also made this recipe without the cocoa or nuts and used miniture snickers for the center.Surprisingly the mini snickers held their shape inspite of baking.And the rich candy filled center was awesome.

Excellent cookies!  The rolo even melts down so it is almost flat -- I was afraid I'd have a visible lump in the middle of the cookies.

Made these with a group of friends at our cookie baking party yesterday... they were a lot of work and pretty messy in the making but boy were they worth it! YUM!! We used Hershey's caramel kisses in the middle and they came out to die for! VERY chocolatey and had a little pool of caramel in the middle. Terrific! Definitely a keeper!

I had to go to 3 different stores to find Rolos, but glad I did. I didn't have the same problem as some others with the cookies hardening. Received lots of compliments.

These cookies were BEYOND fantastic!!  We made them last minute for a final addition to our christmas cookies tins, and i am SO glad we did!! they got the most compliments out of all the different types we made.  We also had to add more flour (my mom thinks she added about 1/2 cup more...she just added until it "felt right").  In the end, had absolutely NO problem with the cookies being dry, and our caramel centers never turned hard, as others had complained about.  We rolled the entire cookie in nuts rather than just dipping the tops in (I'm a design major and couldn't handle that sometimes the nuts were "off-center").  I just can't say enough good things about this recipe...and neither can each of my family members!  We got several requests for the recipe.  I will definitley make these often (and I'm not really a sweets fan)!!  Thanks!

Excellent recipe for an aweszome tasting cookie. As a novice in the kitchen, I did't find this one very hard to do at all. Hint: Keep the dough in the fridge for 24 hours as well as the rolo's. Much easier to handle.  Success with the family again.!! Thanks!!

These were amazing!  I don't think that they were difficult to make at all.  My three year old daughter and I had a blast putting them together.  I can see how the dough gets sticky if not refrigerated for sure, so definitely do that.  I also added slightly more flour.  Plus, since I am a pregnant chocoholic, I doubled the cocoa.  I took another reviewers advice about storing them in a container with a piece of bread at the bottom.  It totally works!  Yum yum!

I make these every year, and they are always a hit!  I put the rolos in the fridge for a few hours before I make the cookies and this helps to stop any leakage.  I drizzle the cookies with white chocloate and people swear they are store brought.

I consider these to be the best cookies I've had, and I've gotten rave reviews when I've made them. However, you do have to use the right kind of candy, otherwise they will come out deformed. ROLLOS are the best to use, and Treasures are ok, but I used some individually wrapped loose candies this last time that were too big and the carmel leaked out everywhere. They take a long time to make but are worth it!

These cookies are incredible!  Everyone wanted the recipe when I made these.  Do NOT be intimidated by the comments at all. They are not difficult to make at all.  I found that by spliting each of the sections in half to wrap around the Rolo works very well. I also used pecans in place of the walnuts due to an allergy.  They are absolutely the most yummy cookies! If you don't try these, you'll really miss out on something great!

These cookies are awesome.  It's a lot of work to beat all the ingredients, but well worth the effort.  I used Milkyway Caramels.  I also added the additional 1/2 c flour and 1/3 c cocoa as suggested in other reviews.  Dough was not too sticky when placed in the freezer in between batches.  I didn't use the nuts, and they were great.  When they are warm, mmmmmm!

It's okay, but certainly not the best.  The chocolate cookie part just didn't taste right at all, and after 1 day, the flavors didn't blend with the filling and the cookie.  It was messy and time-consuming and I won't make it again.

Just finished making this reciped. These cookies are awesome.  I just the nestle treasures caramels, and omitted the nuts.  I was not able to make as many as the recipe said I could, but never seem to.  I must like bigger cookies than average.  Definitely going to make this one again!!!

These are so addictive!  Time consuming, yes, but so worth the wait.  Don't wait until they cool to try one!  Just make sure you completely cover the caramel with the cookie dough, otherwise you have a huge mess on your baking sheet.

This recipe was impossible to make and it didn't really taste that good. I'm not sure why it has so many rave reviews. The cookie dough kept sticking to my hands and I was constantly having to chill it over and over again. It was not worth the time or the ingredients.

These are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I've made two batches already, some as holiday gifts, and I had a hard time parting with them! 
Instead of walnuts, I used crushed hazelnuts and crushed almond slivers. YUM. I also used Caramello chocolate pieces, instead of Rolos. The Caramellos were great because they're square and flat. I crushed them a little before putting them into the cookies, so the caramel would melt more throughout the dough. I also used the BARE MINIMUM amount of dough needed to wrap around one chocolate piece.  This made my second batch MUCH more soft and chewy for a longer time.  In my first batch, I used way too much dough, and the cookies got rock hard after one day.  Also, don't bake them for more than 10 minutes - from my experience, longer than 10 minutes makes the cookies harder (unless you prefer that). THANKS!!

I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and added 1/4 cup more each of flour and cocoa powder, and they were perfect. I made the dough one night, stuck it in the fridge, and made the cookies the next night.  Doing it like that, they didn't seem time-consuming at all.  I lined my baking sheets with parchment paper so I could slide the whole sheet off the pan and let the cookies cool for awhile but still keep using the pan.  Some of the best cookies I've ever had.  Store them in an airtight container once they're cool, and they'll stay soft for days.

From the reviews, I thought this recipe would be time consuming and difficult.  I had no problem what-so-ever.  I whipped up the dough in less than 15 minutes, put it in the fridge overnight, and rolled it into a log and sliced it to fit over the candies in the morning.  The most time-consuming part was unwrapping the individual candies.  Not a single one leaked, and I used Rolos.  Knowing my mother is a die-hard caramel fanatic, I had to make it for our annual Christmas cookie exchange.  I always try to make something new.  But after today, it looks like this will be the annual, since everyone asked for the recipe, and I only had 3 cookies left after everyone left.  My batch made 52 cookies, and I will make it time and again.  Thanks so much for a wonderful addition to my holiday baking.

This is the best cookie I've tasted in a long time.  I think this will be our newest traditional Christmas cookie.  It can be a bit messy, but worth the effort.  Try to keep the Rolo near the top (but still covered with dough) so it doesn't melt all over the cookie sheet!  I did this and did not experience any of the mess that other reviewers have.  I made mine about a week ago, have kept them stored in a Tupperware container and they are still soft and chewy.  An awesome cookie!

Tasty but the caramels didn't work. After cookies cooled the caramel center was hard and difficult to bite into. I expected a soft filling. I used kraft caramels.

I read the reviews and the cookies turned out great. I tried some with turtles and they were amazing, the kids loved them. I added the extra coco powder and these are so chocolaty. Great with a glass of milk.

Not great.  I thought these would taste wonderful.  Cookie did not have much chocolate taste.  I used Rolos.  A few of the cookies leaked caramel. Not worth the hassle of rolling all that messy dough over the Rolos for what they tasted like.  Disappointed.

These are great, everyone loves them! I used riesen caramel candies, they didn't look like caramel filled cookies when we bit into them but that doesn't matter because they taste so delicious. The dough is very soft, and it's good that the directions say to keep it in the fridge as you work with a quarter of the dough at a time! But they're well worth the work. I didn't add walnuts to the dough, just to the top with the sugar. I will definitely make these again!

I love this recipe! I, like other reviews suggested, added 1/4-1/2 cup more of cocoa powder. I used dove chocolate candies which turned out amazingly and were easy to fold the cookie dough around. I didn't really need to chill the dough, though it did make it a little more moldable but with the extra cocoa it's not quite as sticky. Do not over bake these cookies! 8 minutes is perfect and at 7 minutes I removed them, sprinkled just sugar on top instead of using the walnut sugar mix, and put them back in for another minute. They were fun to make and they are a new household favorite!

These were delicious. The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts. These will be a Christmas cookie standard for me. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good. I made some with Rolos, and some with caramels, and made some in mini-muffin tins with Reeses tucked in the top.  Made the Rolo-wrapped cookies in mini-muffin paper cups on a cookie sheet, and it helped them keep their shape.  Took others' advice and added 1/4 c of cocoa and 1/2 tsp of salt.  Will make these again!

The pictures of these were very misleading. They looked like nice little puffy cookies...Mine were pancakes. Yummy little pancakes. I added 1/4 cup extra flour, but did everything else the same. I like the taste and the idea, but I think i will experiment with different chocolate cookies until I get the right one. I started out by dividing the dough into fourths (messy), then dividing the fourths into 12(even messier)...like said in the instructions, but then I ended up using my 1-1/2 inch cookie scoop because it was so much easier. Just filled it 3/4 way full with cookie dough, and pushed a rolo in the middle. pushed the button, and out popped a cookie. Like I said, MUCH easier.

Excellent recipe!  My cookies came out nice and soft.  The only chocolate covered caramel candies I could find were a little bit big... so I just made the cookies bigger to compensate for it.  Would definitely make again.

When I first made these, I used half-inch cubes of hard plain caramel candy and wrapped the dough into little balls around the caramel. Because I am allergic to nuts, I had to omit them. I decided to omit the cocoa powder and up the vanilla extract a tiny bit in half of my dough to make a basic vanilla version, and dipped them in some sprinkles before popping them in the oven.

Fresh out of the oven, the caramel was warm and runny, which complemented the cookie itself very well. Once they cooled off, however, the caramel hardened back up, which made the cookies a little difficult to eat. Regardless, I brought them to school one time and nearly all of them disappeared.

soooo good! like others i did not put in the refrigerator and had no problems handling the dough. i got 31 cookies out of the recipe. i used a store brand 'caramel cup' inside the cookie which are like the reeses fun sized cups. i will definatly make again with candy variations. i had no leakage issues while cooking or when i put them on the cooling rack. i just made sure to let them sit the 4 min before transfering.

These were quite grainy.  Definitly too much sugar.   I could not eat an entire cookie.  Way too sweet and it over powered the caramel.  I definitly would not recommend rolling them in sugar.  My kids like them but they also could not eat the whole cookie.   I have had these cookie made with a cake mix and they are soooo good and chewy.  Ill stick to that recipe.

Just added baking to my list of things to do on here. Made these last night they are great! I put pecans and turtles in mine. They turn out kinda big and you have to adjust the baking time but they are just fabulous! All my wife could do is make happy sounds!

If you have not tried these, YOU MUST! I have made these for several Christmas's and this year they have been a HIT! I have been baking since I was a kid and I have NEVER recieved such positive feedback. My husband's work is still talking about them and it's been almost a week since I brought them in. I didn't change much, and I used rolo's. In fact the only change I made was not mixing walnuts in with sugar. I also sprinkled powdered sugar over them after they were done and BOY-O-BOY, I honestly didn't think you could make them any better! Thank you Lisa for such a WONDERFUL recipe!

I am reviewing these for my sister that made these for her holiday cookie platters this year, they are so good! She did have a hard time finding the candies (Rollos) for the middle...believe she found them in the local CVS pharmacy! A great cookie that I have been meaning to make and she did instead. Yummy!

OMG...In a word, INCREDIBLE! I used all Butter flavor Crisco, cut the white sugar just a bit, upped the flour to 2.5 cups, increased the cocoa a little, omitted the nuts & extra sugar. The cookie itself could stand alone, but... I filled half with regular caramels - cut in half.  The other half?  Hershey's Cherry Cordial Kisses. That is where it's at!!!  In fact, I have to whip up another full batch right now to fill all of them with the rest of the Kisses.  TRY THESE - I GUARANTEE THEY WON'T DISAPPOINT!

These are some of the best chocolate cookies I have ever made!  I won first place at a cookie swap for best tasting cookie.  This is a very competitive group of bakers and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly and I just made them again for another party.

I loved these!  Easy to make once you get the hang of how much cookie dough you need to completely cover the candy, yet not be too big.  I used the exact ingredients in the recipe, except for the nuts.

I chilled the dough for several hours.  Then, rather than divide it up - I just took a large scoop out of the bowl to work with at a time and left the rest in the refrigerator.  As I needed more I just took another scoop.  You do have to work quickly because once the dough begins to get to room temp it does get sticky.  Baked them for 8 minutes and they were wonderful, ESPECIAlly when they are still warm!

I also froze some, and they were just as good after they were thawed.

So delicious! I became a member just so I could compliment your recipe! I'm sending these to my long distance boyfriend in a care package and I'm sure he's going to love them! I'm also bringing them to a potluck at work and to one of my art classes. I want to share them with everyone! I made some of the cookies "open face"; I made a little cup with the dough and pressed 1/4 kraft caramels into it. I prepared the dough 2 days before baking and it was super easy to deal with. I only had problem with leakage in about 2 or 3 in my first batch, but I quickly put an end to that. All you have to do to avoid leakage is make sure you can't see the candy caramel through the dough. make sure there's plenty of dough between the caramel and the cooking sheet.

These were delicious.  I used rolos and mini reeses peanut butter cups.  Everyone liked both but I had more who preferred the reeses.  I used green and red sugar sprinkles instead of regular sugar on top for Christmas.

This is a simple recipe and the cookies are simply delicious!!  I only tried rolos, but will continue to experiment with reese's peanut butter cups, and hershey kisses.  I found it helpful to add extra cocoa powder and flour, as well as use cocoa powder when you roll the dough.  Lastly, I only kept the dough in the fridge for an hour and it was OK to work with, I'm not sure if you really need to wait 2 hours.  Everyone loved these cookies and I will definitely make them again very soon!

First off, these were very tasty. However, I followed the recipe verbatim and found the dough to be way too sticky to work with. It was almost a batter, even after I chilled it. I made about 4 cookies total before I got completely fed up. I ended up putting it into an 8x8, and pushing rolos and Hershey's kisses down into the batter. It came out great. Very rich, and more cake-like than cookie. I will probably make it again, but I think I'll stick to making it into a cake vs. fighting with the dough.

This was a wonderful cookie! I followed the recipe exactly (without the nuts) and the dough was perfect. Very easy to work with. I used Junior Caramels and didn't have any caramel leak. They didn't seem to melt down as well as Rolos might have, though. The cookies kind of had a lump in the middle, but it made them look homemade and were still awesome! Definitely will make these again.

Very good cookie. The only change I made was adding 1/4 cup flour to make the dough easier to work with. I then did not have to refrig the dough. I just lightly floured my hands. Oh, I also drizzled the tops with melted choc chips and almond bark. Will make again!

Oh, I guess I did back the temp down to 350 but my oven seems to be hot. So i did 8 mins in a 350 oven.

THis cookie is now one of our favorites.  One tip..  don't panic when you pull the batter out of the refrig and it is hard as a rock..  Let it sit for a bit and you'll be on your way.  I am now making my second batch as the first did not make it till Christmas.

These cookies were wonderful! I happened to have the special dark cocoa so used that. I used Rolos and followed another reviewers advice to freeze them before covering them with the cookie dough. Worked perfectly. I didn't divide the dough, just eye-balled the amount to wrap round the candies. Great recipe, Thanks!

First, if you're baking these for Christmas, buy the candies the day after Halloween.  Not only are they half priced, but the Rolos are packed in 3's, so it is less unwrapping to do.  They are easy and good, but not exceptional.  I have extremely HIGH standards for cookies, so even a four from me is good for a cookie.  I did get several requests for this recipe.   I followed other reviewers advice and added the extra cocoa and flour.

Absolutley amazing cookies! I love them SOO much I make them every Christmas.  I can't figure out how to get the caramel to stay inside the cookie.  It tends to melt outside of the dough when they are baking.  That doesn't matter to me..because they taste great!!

These cookies are fantastic! I got so many compliments on them when I made them around the holidays, and I haven given the recipes to numerous people who asked for it. I accidentally added all of the nuts to the batter, and it tasted great with the extra crunch. I also added nuts to the top as well. I also made them again recently without the nuts and I put a miniature Reese's cups in the middle. So good! Definitely a cookie recipe staple now.

Super rich and scrumptious.  Almost brownie-like.  I swapped the walnuts with pecans and tried both Rolos and caramel filled Hershey kisses.  But preferred the kisses because of the gooier texture.  Rolo's came out slightly harder and chewier.  Kept everything else the same and loved it.  Very easy to make, just a little time consuming to unwrap all the chocolates but well worth it.

The cookies tasted great. We omitted nuts from the dough and then ground 1/2 cup walnuts into a powder and mixed it with the 1/2 cup of sugar. Using Rolos was more effective than Brach's caramels (made for a softer caramel the next day). Very tasty - our guests were eating the raw cookie dough before we even put it in the oven! Would make again, even though they are so unhealthy!

absolutly delicious and so easy to make! I used caramel hershey kisses and they turned out amazing! The key is that the dough needs to be cold when you are working with it. I kept the dough outside in the 20 degree weather which chilled it nicely, will definitly make these over and over again!! so yummy and so easy! everyone was impressed by these!

Just finished these. They really weren't that hard. You just have to refrigerate the dough long enough so it won't be too sticky. I left the nuts out of the dough but did put them on the tops. They are very chocolately but good.

This was a great recipe to try.  As someone who can bake basic things I thought that I might mess this up, but it worked out amazing.  I used Hershey's kisses with caramel filling, and they didn't leak out at all.  They were a big hit with everyone.  This is a really great recipe, and really simple to do.

terrible cookie. I made these for a party, the caramel spilled out the cookie and burned. if you didn't position the caramel DIRECTLY in the center of the dough, it looked bad, and then when my sister tryed the cookies, not only did she say she couldnt taste the caramel, she said the cookie was dry!
never will bake again

did not look appetizing and must be eaten when warm. when they cool down they go hard and aren't good any more. i used caramilks and they were the best part of the recipe. i should have just eaten a caramilk bar and it would have been more satisfying.

We have made these for Christmas for the last 5 years. We love them! This year we used Hershey Kisses with Caramel. Every other year we used Rolos. I think the kisses made for a little bit softer caramel center. We did, however, love both versions. Also good without being rolled in nuts.

Lordy, lordy, lordy...how could I give anything but 5 stars for this cookie.  I baked them yesterday and thought about them all afternoon today at work.  I actually didn't have enough choc. covered caramels (used Reisens) and made a few without.  They were still good, but the ones with the caramel are fantastic!

Wow!  These are the best.  I host an annual mother daughter cookie exchange and I thought these were the best cookies there.  I also experimented with treasures and rolos.  Rolos win!  The were easier to roll (with the treasures you had to make an oval, with the rolos, you just did a ball).  I made 10 dozen of these.  I made the dough one day, and let it chill overnight, and took out a little at a time to work with.  Also, I did not use the walnuts.  I simply rolled them in sugar.  They stayed soft, and we never once had to microwave them.  I loved the way the carmel melted inside.

These are very good!  I used a variety of candy and like the size and flavor of the cookies made with Caramello Bar in them best.  They definitely are best heated in the microwave for 10-15 seconds and be sure to not overbake them.  They seem very soft when you take them out but they get harder/crispier as they cool.

I was a bit alarmed at seeing all these lumps of firm dough on the baking sheet,  I thought I might end up with ping-pong ball shaped cookies!  However they flattened nicely during baking so I needn't have worried.  I will definately make these again.

I spotted this recipe and knew it would be a hit with my family.  It is now my husband's favorite cookie recipe.  I used rolo candies for the center and they are incredible.  I will be sure to make these every year for the holidays and any other time of the year.

These are soooooo nummy!  I made them as gifts for all of my friends and they were a big hit.  Make sure though that when you are wrapping the dough around the caramels that you do it well because otherwise the caramel and chocolate leak out - a few of mine were wrecked that way although it just made more for me to eat instead of give away!  Thanks for a great recipe!

these cookies are great... but the dough is hard to work with and these cookies take more time than the average drop cookie, but they'll become a Chritmas staple. An extra 1/2 cup of flour might make it more workable...Milky Way Carmels work the best... I bought bage of Rollos and Treasures...Milky Ways are the perfect size

Last year I made these candies and the carmel leaked out so this year (today) I used Riesin candies but I cut them in half - it used less dough and they came out yummy.  I also didn't use the nut mixture but I will next year.  I also found that these needed longer baking time - between 10 - 15 minutes.  I've made 9 different cookies so far for Christmas and this one is my favorite !!

I've made this recipe twice now and both times received RAVES galore. Some said they found these cookies difficult to make. I didn't find that the case at all... just a longer process than your normal drop cookies. I found if the dough is too cold it's more difficult to work with. I've used peanut butter cups and halved Caramel Treasures as the filling. Both were excellent! I followed other users suggestions on no nut, bit more flour, adding salt, etc.

I found that wrapping the candy with as little dough as possible makes a better shaped cookie and with less chocolate cookie the carmel filling really stood out.

My husband thought these were really great cookies, but I thought they were just so-so and very awkward to prepare.  After a little trial and error, I decided that it worked best to leave the dough in the freezer for a little while, and to leave the cookies on the parchment paper until they had totally cooled.  The rolos were a little "grainy" if that's the right word.  I'm going to try them again with something else.  I made a few with a piece of white baking chocolate in them and they were really good also.

These cookies are absolutely awesome.   I tried using Reisens the first time and they were so good, but you have to make sure you nuke them each time to get the right softness.  The second time I tried a suggestion I saw in another review and used Nestle's Treasures - peanut butter and chocolate creams.  I think you could get very imaginitive with these.  The cookie alone is great! thanks!

Thank you for this scrumptious recipe! I added the salt and extra flour and cocoa like others said and I also left out the nuts. For the centers I tried Nestles Treasures- Caramel and Peanut Butter. I think the caramel in these candies is too thin because it spread out all over the cookie and some leaked but the peanut butter were PERFECT! So, once I figured that out, I made the rest peanut butter. My husband and I have been married 6 months and this is the first time I made him a chocolate type of cookie and he LOVED IT! I didn't know he would like it so much since he always raves about chocolate chip! I'm going to take some to some friends and family today and I can't wait to see their reaction!

These were wonderful!
A quick hint-try using those "Hersheys Bites" candy for inside. I used the York peppermint bites but I know they come in Skor and Almond as well.
Didn't use the nuts but did crushed almonds on top.
Make sure to wrap the dough tightly around the candy, if it's too loose, it can look a bit concaved.

These cookies are pretty good. I used caramilk pieces and a cookie scoop. I just pushed the caramilk into the 1/2 filled scoop and covered with more dough. It was quite easy.

These cookies exceeded my expectations...they were so good my family gobbled them up before they made it to the cookie jar!
I made a few changes... I used caramilk instead of caramels, which gave the cookie a soft, gooey centre and I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the dough.I divided the dough into 48 portions after several hours refrigeration and then re-chilled it, as suggested by another reviewer. This made it easy to wrap the individual candies. I highly recommend these cookies...they're the new favorite at our house .

A really yummy recipe. Easy to make.  I added another half cup of flour to make the dough more workable.  I also put the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes instead of putting it in the fridge for 2 hours.  It worked out great.

This recipe is way over-rated! These cookies are good, but not that good. I made them a few days ago, and there are still many left. If they were that great, my kids would have devoured them by now! They are good, but not great.

A wonderful cookie but plan for lots of time. I found adding a little extra flour 
made the recipe easier to handle.
I have also added this to my Christmas baking. I have made 295 cookies
this weekend and they freeze well! 
Instead of dipping in both the nuts & sugar, I put all the nuts in the recipe & 
rolling in sugar. Turned out great!

Delicious!  I omitted the walnuts because I don't care for them, and the recipe turned out great.  You definitely need to keep the batter refrigerated or it becomes impossible to work with.  I used a 1-inch cookie scoop, pressed a Rolo in the middle, then covered the bottom.  It made the perfect size cookie and kept my hands (reasonably) clean.

made this recipe years ago and could not stop making it  with success! there was one exception...this recipe was a disaster with butter, my old recipe called for margarine and it made a big difference in the success of the recipe.

use of margarine makes a difference,same proportions for everything else.

YUM is the word that comes to mind... Very nice treat. 
Here's what I did, maybe it'll help someone else...
In the recipe i added extra 1/4 cup cocoa, 1/2 tsp salt, used Dove Dark Chocolate with Sea Salt.
The chocolates went into the freezer for a few hours, the batter into the refrigerator for an hour.
When it was time to roll I used a 1 1/2" metal ice cream scooper, then wearing non-powdered non-latex gloves (Sam's Club) pressed out the dough into a nice round circle that the candy fit nicely inside. 
Sealed up the cookie, rolled the edges so the cookie looked like a Bon-Bon candy, dipped it in nuts, cooked for 8.5 minutes on air sheets. 
Not one exploded!!

My dear departed grandmother always made these cookies.  We called them rolo cookies. The only difference is we used chopped pecans but you don't add it to the cookie mixture. You just dip the top into the sugar and nut mixture. I usually make half with nuts and half without. A lot of people don't like the nuts.

The chocolate-covered caramels I used didn't flatten out when baked so it made for a really hard center.  The dough in this recipe is just okay, not great.  I think the concept of this cookie could be a good idea, this just isn't the kind of recipe I am going to keep for years.

Delicious and well worth all the extra effort this cookie takes. Some changes that I made were to use 1/2 butter, 1/2 butter flavor Crisco. I also upped the cocoa by 1/4 cup and I always, always, always use parchment paper when I bake. With this cookie, it's a must. If a couple of cookies "burst", you will not have a pan to scrub, the parchment will contain the mess. But if you bake these for no more than 8 minutes, bursting should not be an issue. Let them cool for 5-10 minutes before removing from the cooling rack so they can set up. These were a huge hit last year at our annual cookie exchange and I have been ordered to make them again this year! Oh, and one more thing, if you use pecans in place of the walnuts (though both are divine!), you will have more of a "turtle" cookie, yum!!

GREAT cookies!!! Especially for my caramel-lovers here at home! Eat fast, the cocoa powder makes them dry out in a couple days.

I made these for a get-together of family members for boating and motor-bike riding one summer day.  The kids really liked these.  It got a little hot in the boat, and the cookies got a little crumbly, but they ate them anyway and loved them.  I used Dove caramel-filled chocolate pieces for the centers, and they worked well.  was fun to have the surprise caramel inside.  Will probably make these again.

I followed the direction to a t, minus one change.  I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to create a nice "cracking" on top of the cookie.  It's tasteless and worked.  These cookies have a delicious chocolate flavor and I will be making them again.

These are sooo good!  I didn't bother chilling the dough and it worked out just fine.  I used caramel filled kisses and they worked fine except for their shape made the cookies sort of dome shaped in the middle.  Will experiment with other candies in the future.

Taste great! Dough is a pain to work with, but it's worth it. I used squares of Carmello bars for the candy, but next time will try Rolos since I think it needed more caramel.

I made these using the suggestions of other reviewers adding a 1/4 cup more cocoa and a 1/2 tsp. salt.  I used Hershey's caramel kisses with chopped pecans on top, a store brand of peanut butter cups cut in half topped with chopped dry roasted peanuts, and coconut macaroons with the chocolate dipped bottoms cut into 1/4's  topped with coconut.  I may try it next time using large Mounds bars cut into 8 or 10 slices each.   They were all good but I think I liked the peanut butter cups the best.  I used a small cookie scoop and got 69 cookies out of a single batch.   I did not refrigerate the dough but did wet my fingers & palm to lessen the stickiness factor.  The only ones that leaked were the caramel ones and if you throw the chocolates in the freezer for a few minutes before surrounding them with cookie dough it did seem to help. I baked them at 375 for only 8 minutes.  I used parchment paper which helped also and I let them cool on the pan for 10 minutes.  Then I scraped them off the parchment paper and flipped them to cool the rest of the way onto a brown paper bag.  The brown paper bag works great to cool cookies on if you don't have enough cooling racks.  Just rip it open flat.  It catches the crumbs and you can throw it away when you're done.

I used Toffifee and peanut butter cups instead of caramel  and it worked very well.  It's a little tedious wrapping the dough around the candy but well worth it.

Made them yesterday and worried that they would be too sweet....they are wonderful!  Not too sweet at all.  I put a rolo in them and I would definitely like to try with other candies.  Will definitely be on my XMas Cookie list to make every year.

Quality taste and easy to make with the kids. I'd flatten a cookie sized ball and they would shape it around the caramel-filled Hershey's kiss. I used Heath bar bits mixed with sugar for the topping. I was afraid the cookie would be too sweet, but there were just right...a huge hit with young and old alike!!!

Great cookies!! They had a crunchy shell & were gooey inside. The only tip I have would be to flip them upside down on the cooling rack because the caramel dropped out of mine while cooling.

I made these as part of my Christmas cookie spread.  I pretty much made them as directed. They were good, got compliments from everyone. The only negative thing I heard is that they are very very sweet.  You need to wash them down with coffee or something :)

These are really good. Used rolo's and mini peanut butter cups. they both worked great. A little messy but putting a little water on your hands is the trick. Glad I read that tip before doing these. Well worth it.

I have made these cookies twice. My first batch didnt turn out so well. I was in a hurry and didn't let the dough chill long enough so it was very difficult to work with.  The dough needs at least an hour in the freezer.  Use parchment paper and latex gloves.

These cookies are good and tasty. I didn`t have any problem with this recipe. I made some modifications. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I didn`t find chocolate/caramel candies and I used simple caramel candies. But I wish these cookies had a little soft texture.

These are really good, a nice festive cookie.  I followed the directions exactly for mixing but did decrease the oven temp to 350 degrees.  I baked them for 9 minutes and they came out perfect.  I will make these again.  My family thought they were great.

I have been making these for the past few years now, and would rate it as one of my favourite cookies ever!  I use Rolo's most of the time, with great success, I just suggest putting the cookie in the microwave for 10-15 seconds before eating it for that 'just-from-the-oven" taste and melted gooey caramel texture.  
I recently tried using the caramel filled Hershey's Kisses since we couldn't find Rolo's and I had about 30% of my cookies leak which never happens with the Rolo's.  I'll try experimenting with other flavours of chocolates, but I think the Rolo is hard to beat!

This recipe was great! I made it for the people I work with, and some loved it so much they had 5 of them! I made the recipe with Rolos and Reese's Miniatures, but my favorite were the ones with Rolos. The only  tip I could give anyone about this recipe would be to make sure to use enough dough to coat the piece of candy completely, otherwise it may leak through and stick to the cookie sheet, making them harder to remove from the pan. Otherwise, its definitely one of my favs!

I couldn't believe how great these cookies were straight out of the oven! This is my new favorite cookie recipe, hands down. Like some others, I covered my hands in cocoa while rolling the cookies and I had no trouble at all. I made half the batch using peanut butter cups and half with Rolos. Both were good, but I definitely liked the original caramel ones the best. Overall a great recipe, no modifications needed.

I used regular caramels.  They were great right out of the oven, but after they cooled, the caramels were too hard (although the cookie still tasted great).  So next time I will try Rolo's.  I also can't wait to try York Peppermint patties.

Very tasty cookies when first baked, but they dry out within a few days. I also tried using York Peppermint Patties in the center. They were yummy, but pretty rich and they made the cookies a lot bigger. I think the Dove caramels and the Reeses' were the best.

If I could give these 6 stars, I would!  I've made them each of the last 5 Christmas and they are a huge hit.  Last year, I tried some with white chocolate in the middle - they were excellent too, though richer even than the caramel ones.

This recipe is awesome and I plan to make this a new christmas tradition.  I used carmel kisses.  I did not get 48 cookies as I made them a little larger to ensure they covered the kisses and I did not have carmel leaking.

Very disappointing recipe. Tastes good but the eye appeal is lacking. Too many caramels leaked out while cooking. Needs to stay on sheet longer than 4 minutes or else they fall through  the wire racks. I needed something delicious for a cookie exchange with the recipe, but I guess I won't take these after all. Way too much work for a poor outcome, but the family will eat them anyway!

Great cookie. I used them at my cookie exchange party and everyone loved them. I used Rolo candies as the caramel and they worked out wonderfully. I did not use nuts in my cookies because of food allergies of my children. They were absolutley wonderful!!

These are easily the best cookies I've ever made.  I used Rolo's, skipped the nuts and added 1 cup chocolate chips to the dough.  The only change I'll make is more chocolate chips!

These are so good! I used rolos, and peanut butter cups. I didn't have any troubles working with the dough, or leaking out of the cookie during baking like others did. I will add these to my xmas cookie list for this year. Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe!  I love it!  I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and Rolos.  Also used salted butter, since there is no salt in the dough.  I put 1/2 cup walnuts in the dough, but didn't put any walnuts on top, only coarse sugar.  I didn't really do step 3, but instead scooped up some dough with my Pampered Chef cookie scoop, and wrapped it around the Rolo, trimming off any excess.  I still got 4 dozen this way (actually, 4 dozen plus 2).  I kept all the dough out on the counter as I worked, and didn't worry about working quickly.  It worked fine.  If it was any colder, I think it may have been harder to work with.  (I did chill for a couple hours before-hand).  Maybe I'll try other candies next.  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

Forgot to rate this recipe from Christmas time.  My family and friends really enjoyed.  Some of the caramel leaked out from the cookies but that was because I did not enclose the caramels tightly on some cookies.  Did not matter because the taste was perfect.  Thanks

This cookie is brilliant!  Using dutch process cocoa is extremely important.  It made all the difference in the flavor and intensity of the chocolate.  It balanced the extra sweet caramel filling.  Chilling the dough made it much easier to handle and roll into balls.  My cookies looked perfect and they traveled from SoFla to LA with no problem at Christmas.

I suppose I'm the minority.  After three full days of making scrumptious treats for Christmas, I had beautiful trays made up for my guests.  I was really excited about these because there was a lengthy ( not hard) amount of preparation and to me they tasted not bad, (the middle makes the cookie- the cookie itself wasn't anything all too special)but most of them were left on the trays.  I was disappointed.

These are pretty YUMMY, but sometimes the caramel came out of the cookie and it made a big mess. It gave me an excuse to eat the "mess ups" though! Everyone likes them, but make sure to factor in the 2 hour chill time in the prep time. It's a yummy cookie, but I gave it 4 stars for the extra prep work... unwrapping all the rolos, chill time, having to wrap the dough around the rolo, having to let them sit on the cookie for several minutes before taking them off because they are so soft and gooey...a little work and hassle, but if you love oooy goooy chocolatey cookies, this is for you.

The only thing I changed on these cookies was that I didn't add the unsweetened cocoa powder, only because my sister does not care for cocoa powder; they were delicious!!!  Be sure to chill or freeze the dough; I didn't and it was hard to work with.

These cookies taste amazing.  The only problem I had was leaky caramel.  I used chocolate caramels(no name brand, I think) that were huge, so it was hard to wrap the dough around them completly.  Next time I would try Rolo's, or something smaller, and I would leave the walnuts out of the dough and just roll the cookies in pecans instead.  Delicious!

These turned out great. I made these for gifts & didn't use nuts (recipients have allergies). I let the dough chill for about 3 hours while I ran errands. I would possibly divide the dough prior to refigerating next time. I used both Rolos & Caramel Kisses. Both taste great, but some of the Kisses cookies leaked. I never bake from scratch, but had no problem working with the dough.

This was a good recipe....if you like chocolate!  I used caramel filled kisses and put them on top, like a peanutbutter blossom.  I ran out of time to wrap the kiss in the cookie dough.  They were just fine.

These cookies are the bomb.  I make a similar cookie only with snicker bites and these are much better.  I loved the nuts, they really added an extra touch to the cookie.  The only thing that I didn't like was they were really messy to roll.  I had alot of extra dough left on my hands afterwards.  But very very very good.  I will be making again!!!!!!

I have been making this recipe successfully for 5 years now.  I was just married last weekend and baked 300 for the event with no complaints - just requests for the recipe and for more cookies.  Rolos have always been my best bet, although I have wondered if Junior Caramels would work too.  The cookies freeze really well and the only change I've made is to use pecans instead; I prefer them to walnuts.

A little difficult to make since the caramel runs and sticks to the pan during the baking of some of them, but generally good.  I used cut up pieces of Mars bars, I'm not sure how Rolos would work in this recipe, they seem like they would be too big, but I might try them next time.  Definitely a holiday cookie

5 friends and I have baked cookies 5 Christmases in a row now, and this has been a staple cookie for us since day 1!  They're so simple and fun to make and oh-so-delicious.  They're best right out of the oven, but just as good when kept - just microwave for 10 secs or so to re-melt the caramel.

We used Caramellos but we only bought two king size and we ran out of squares so we made the cookies a little bit larger (which helped with the carmel not spilling out) and just added a minute to the baking time. As long as none of the chocolate corners were sticking out or touching the outside of the ball, then they were ok. If they were, then the carmel would spill out. Everybody loved these cookies a ton!

Taste great but kind of hard to make.  Getting the cookie dough around the Rolo is harder than it sounds.

These cookies were great, everyone loved them.  For half of the dough I used mini reese's peanut butter cups, also very good.  Also chopped the pecans in small pieces for the cookie and fine little pieces for the top for those who don't love nuts.

This was a MESS!!  They melted all over the cookie sheet.  The caramel stuck and made it nearly impossible to remove the cookies to eat.  We peeled the cookies in chunks and ate some....it tasted good but you couldn't serve these to anyone.

Everyone loved these, and they were pretty easy to make!  I didn't have rolos, so I just used caramels.  Still very yummy.  Store them in a container with a little chunk of bread and they'll last longer, and they're very yummy heated up just a few seconds in the microwave.

I have made these the last 2 years in a row for cookie exchange parties.  I used mini peanut cups last year and they were great.  This year I did the PB cups again and also tried the Rolo's.  I think I will stick to the PB cups next time.  The rolos leaked out the bottom and made quite a mess.  The taste was great though.  I will probably make these again next year!

I omitted the nuts, used a half oz ice cream scoop, scooped up the dough, pressed a Rolo in the middle and smooshed the excess over to close...voila! no blow outs... I dipped the tops in non pareils in holiday colors and also sanding sugar, both were great at a recent cookie exchange.

This is the second Chrismas I've made these cookies and they are always a hit.  The only thing I change is I use Hershey Kisses instead of caramel candies.  I especially like the Dark Chocolate Hershey Kisses.  Thanks for the recipe!

SOOO wonderful!  They were actually very easy to make I thought and I didn't change a thing (except for the fact that I didn't mix walnuts into the dough, just on top.)  Many of my work friends asked for the recipe and said they were unbelieveable. YAY!

This is a REALLY difficult recipe to rate. If it were just based on taste, it would definitely be a 5 - they taste sooooo good! BUT, despite reading the reviews and following others' advice, these were really messy to make, and they ended up looking terrible. I kept the dough and my hands cold, but they were SO sticky. The cookies ended up really flat, and the Rolo leaked out the bottom in a puddle (I cooled them upside down!). I left the Rolos out for the second batch, and they were still yummy. I'm going to experiment with the Rolos and a different, firmer cookie dough recipe I have.

My family couldn't stop eating these, even my grandmother who is not supposed to with her dentures, haha! With my slight inexperience in baking, it was slightly difficult for me to make, but that's my fault, not the recipes. I'm sure it's much easier each time you do it! I have also made them without the caramel because I didn't have any in the house. Still chilled the dough. They were good-- not AS good-- but still tasty!

So good! Been making these for quite some time now.  Heres a tip for those who have been complaining about the cookies drying out - After the cookies have cooled to just warm, place a slice of bread in the bottom of a container with a lid, place the cookies over the slice of bread and then always keep the lid closed tight, this should keep the cookies soft. It works great for me! All else fails, heat the cookie up in the microwave and it'll be back to chewy!

I made this for a client coming into our office who loves sweets mid-afternoon.  I used pecans (because it was in the house).  I used Riessen and it was great.  I will try the Rollo's next.  If you don't tell anyone the surprise filling, they just love the surprise.  Will be making this again.  They were NOT difficult at all to make.

Made these cookies for the family and everyone couldn't stop eating them. Everyone was impressed with how creative they were and thought they were difficult to make. Really, they are so easy. They are fantastic. I used Riesen candies but next time I want to try rolo based on all the reviews. Since it's easter I also used Caramilk eggs...which were awesome too. I rolled my cookies is raw sugar too which was yummy. YUMMY....thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe was excellent and not as hard to make as I thought. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you!! Rolos are the way to go. Just be careful handling them: some of my cookies broke letting all of the caramel ooze out.

I found this recipe about three years ago and have been baking them about once a month since then.  This is definitely a favorite of my family, friends, and coworkers.  I made a double batch for my bro's graduation party and they were gone within two hours.  I use just enough dough to wrap the rolo. . . that way there is a higher caramel/cookie ratio!  I find that it works best to chill the dough for only half an hour or so. . . a little messy but easier to work with.  They taste great with or without nuts.  They are well worth the time they take to make.

Oh my god these cookies are amazing.  They are great right out of the oven, didn't get to try them cooled yet.  I made several, then froze the rest (wrapped in wax paper - cut squares, put the dough ball in the middle then draw the corners up and twist, to maintain the spherical shape, then put into a ziplock bag), pre-baked.  To unfreeze, unwrap the desired number of balls and place on a sheet of aluminum foil and let sit for about 20-30 minutes.  Then bake as specified in the recipe.  They are great frozen, and a good gift for boyfriends.  The sugar didnt really melt and didnt look great on top of them, and I dont know that it was all that needed - this recipe is sweet but rich.  Definitely try these out of the oven (give it the 3-4 minute to cool, as specified in the recipe).  Used rolos and it worked great.  Oh one thing - buy a lot of milk before eating the cookies - you'll need it!

Every Christmas I have demands for certain cookies from friends and family.  This has become a tradition.  It is easy and soooooooo very good.
If I should forget, people start asking, "When are you going to make those chocolate caramel?"  They just can't get enough of them.

This is a fabulous recipe!! I made these as gifts, together with rum balls and fudge, to give away at Christmas and everyone went crazy over them. It was everyone's favorite by far!! I used bite-size Snickers and Reeses Cups. Will definitely do these again next Christmas. Read the reviews, as they are a big help. Pay attention to tips on how to create the cookies once the dough has been refrigerated. It is also a good idea to use the extra flour and cocoa.

I made these for a work potluck and they tasted very good. However, they were so difficult to make, I doubt I'll ever try them again. No matter how fast I worked with the dough, it became a huge sticky mess. It helped to pat my hands in cocoa powder before handling each ball of dough.

If you want a brownie with a carmel filling this is it my husband said.  He didn't think it was worth the work.  I think these would be nice for the Christmas Holidays.  They taste better warm otherwise, the center is kinda hard.  I used Rollo's like many others suggested.  You do need to work fast because the dough softens so quickly.

I've never seen people so excited over a cookie!  I tried bite-size Snickers...and WOW! Delicious!  I found the dough is much easier to work with when it's cold. These will be added to my cookie plates that I give out at Christmas!

I made these for Christmas and my Great Aunt (aka the best baker in the world) actually asked me for the recipe!  You can't get a bigger compliment than that!

Really delicious. A bit crunchy on the outside and nice and chewy inside with the caramel. Great for caramel and chocolate lovers!

I made 2 batches this past Christmas and the first one was EXCELLENT.  The second, however, turned out dry and crumbly (and I used the exact same things in both batches).  I did bake the first batch at my home, and the 2nd at my mother's though, so it may be an oven variation thing.  But I used Rolo candies and they were a popular hit with my family this past Christmas

These cookies were delicious. They are best served ten minutes out of the oven because the caramel is still gooey.  I omitted the nuts in the batter but used 1/4 cup finely chopped nuts and 1 tsp. sugar for the topping - The little bit of nuts on top made a nicer presentation. The dough was easy to work with as long as you chill at for a minimum of 2 hours. I used Rolos candy because there were no Treasures at the store.

These were tasty right out of the oven but I wouldn't make them again because they get very hard very quickly. I made them for cookie trays for Christmas.  I much prefer my caramel brownies because they're moister, softer, and have a deeper chocolate flavor.

These were devine!  I made the cookie dough with the additional flour and cocoa powder as recommended from previous reviewers.  I used Rolo candies and dusted them with powdered sugar after baking.  I also used the peanut butter centers from the Buckeye Ball II recipe on this site, and rolled those in chopped hazelnuts.  Everything was a hit!

Made them for Xmas tins I distributed and they were a hit.  The only chocolate covered caramels I found were Rolo's which worked out wonderfully!  I have already gotten requests for the recipe.

I'm a beginner, but my cookies tasted great! It did get messy and the mixture was very sticky and gooey, kind of hard to work with, however, the mess is well worth it.

The taste of these cookies were very good. Anyone wanting a chocolate fix, this is the cookie to have. Although making them is quite tedious. The dough is sticky and you need to either butter or spray pam on your hands in order to mold the cookie around the chocolate. A hit with the family, but Mom gives it a "4"... :)

This is an awesome cookie. I hold a cookie exchange at Christmas and this was everyone's favorite last year!! I'm just sorry I can't use it again this year. PS-I found Rolos to be the perfect size candies.

I get so many compliments when I make these cookies - they're absolutely delicious. The dough is definately easier to work with when it's cold, and I've found that caramelo candy and reese's mini peanut butter cups work well b/c of their small size.

GREAT! Yes...they take some time. Yes...they're fussy...but OH MY GOSH! These have become a legendary part of my baking repetoire.  Read the advice about extra flour/cocoa etc. all are helpful.

Wow! These are THE BEST cookies on the planet. You literally can't stay away from them. They are messy and time-consuming, so I save them for Christmas. I used Nestle Treasures instead of Rollos. Everyone begs me to make them.

We have a favorite caramel brownie recipe that is a lot work and so I was looking for something with the same taste but not as much work.  Well the taste is close, but in my opinion - so is the work.  They were a hit, though.  I used regular caramels and no nuts.  I found that heating them up in the micro for 15 seconds made them taste like they just came out of the oven again.  I think I will try using parchment paper next time - no matter what I did they suck to the cookie sheet or the plate!

On the suggestion of other reviewers, I added 1/2 tsp salt; 1/3 cup more cocoa; left the nuts out of the dough; used crushed sliced almonds for the topping; and used parchment paper.  I thought the cookies were great, and for the leftovers, a zap in the microwave makes them as great as when they came out of the oven.  I used Reisens and Reese Mini PB Cups, and I found both to be ooky sweet (Reisens moreso than the PB cups), although still good.

my family loved them! it yielded less than the recipe called for. maybe it depends on the size of your caramel. i used cadbury caramilk (delish!) i didn't want to use up all my caramilk (i wanted some for myself!) so i substituted it with cadbury chocolate-covered peppermints. tasted just like a peppermint patty! oh and you do need to add a 1/2 tsp salt if you're using unsalted butter. if salted butter, just add about 1/4 tsp. salt. they really looked elegant with the walnut-sugar mixture on top! great recipe!

Wonderful cookie.  I made a batch a couple weeks before Xmas, planning to freeze them, but they never made it into the freezer and I had to make more!  The nut topping really makes them stand out.  It helps to form the dough into a rectangle before refrigerating, and then when cold, divide the dough into quarters, then individual squares.  Also, let them cool a while on the cookie sheets.

I thought this recipe was great, and not hard at all!  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe, except I didn't add nuts to the dough, I just dipped in pecans and sugar.  Also, I used Nestle Treasures caramels - I think they're better quality than Rolos.  The dough was a little sticky, but if you put flour on your hands, it's no big deal!  Don't be intimidated by this recipe!

The cookies were great right out of the oven but I also had the problem with them becoming hard by the next day.  I used Rolo's in mine (I love Rolo's) but I think I will use regular caramel pieces the next time.  You tasted too much chocolate.

These are just wonderful!!  I took some over to my neighbor and she now wants the recipe!  I followed the advice of others - I used 1/2 cup more flour, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 cup more cocoa.  I always use the Ultrafine Bakers Sugar by C&H, so I'm not sure that would make a difference in the outcome.  I baked them on parchment paper for 10 minutes.  They were very easy to make and I had absolutely no problem with the caramel leaking out.  I used Rolos.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!  I plan on making these again this week for my sons Christmas program at school.

I was looking for a new recipe for a holiday cookie exchange and came across this one.  All I can say is "WOW".  I did read all the previous reviews and followed one person's recommendation to increase the cocoa, add salt and bake just a little longer.  I left out the nuts but still dipped them in the sugar.  I also tried 3 different candies (rolos, riesens and milk duds) and have to say that the rolos work the best since they stay soft in the center even once the cookie has cooled.  I am already making my second batch and ran out of candy so I made the rest without any in the center.  My older son loves them this way.  Next time I am going to try making them with reese's peanut butter cups in the center.  Thanks again for sharing this recipe!

These are absolutely fantastic! I made them for a bake sale, and after tasting one, my husband told me they weren't getting out of the house. One day later, he says they're the best cookies he ever had in his life. I used 1/2 cup more of flour than the recipe called for, and didn't have any leakage problems. I made the dough into a ball in the palm of my hand, flattened it out to about a 2-1/2 inch diameter circle, and then bunched it around the Rolo. I did try to make sure the bunched-up part ended up on the bottom of the cookie, so as to minimize any possible leakage. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and mixed all the walnuts into the dough. I will make these again and again.

I admit, the only reason I tried these cookies was because of the great reviews.  Boy am I glad I tried them.  They are wonderful!  Have made 2 batches already and they disappear quickly.  I floured my hands to prevent sticking and had no problem.  I will definitely make more for the holidays.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Lisa.

I have been making these for three years now and I have varied the recipe to make my own version. I use Rolo's. When they are still wrapped flatten them lightly with the palm of your hand, letting the warmth of your hand soften them a bit. Do this slowly. Then I unwrap and cut in half. Then I halve a marchino cherry that I have dried a litte with a paper towel and set that on the caramel and then wrap with cookie dough and bake. Very good.

Just took mine out of the oven! Ate 3 right off the bat! They are totally delicious! I used REISEN as well, I read most of the reviews first before making them. Only 2 of mine out of the whole batch leaked a bit. I also put waxed paper on my cooling racks and let them cool that way! No problem. I used my Pampered Chef (medium size) scoop to scoop the dough, then pressed the carmel inside and made a ball and dipped in sugar, I omitted entirely the whole nut thing. Thanks for a wonderful treat! Totally love it!

This is one decadent cookie!  Thanks everyone for sharing your tips and experiences.  I have no trouble whatsoever.  

Here's my 2 cents worth:  1) If you have one, use a scale to weigh the flour, and cocoa powder.  2) I used both Rollo and Caramilk.  And my husband likes the Caramilk better.  3) As a previous poster stated, use an ice-cream scoop.  I didn't even need to refrigerate the dough.  I did however chill the chocolates.  4) I kind of have a feeling that this cookie should not be overbaked.  5)  Read all the reviews!  Learn from others experiences.

These cookies were delicious!  Everyone in my family loved them!  My advice:  Leave them to cool on the baking sheets for 8 to 10 minutes, because if put on a cooling rack while they're very hot, the caramel will drip out from the bottom and you'll have a real mess on your hands!

These cookies are wonderful!  I made them for Christmas, and they were one of the favorites!  I think the hardest part of making these cookies is gaurding the Rollos from the "vultures" in the house! I ran out of Rollos, and I substitued them with half of a Cherry Andes Candy.  A totally different flavor, but delicious as well!  Thank you Lisa!

First the good news--I solved the soft dough problem this way; after refrigerating the dough I flattened it into an 8" disk then divided that into four wedges, which I wrapped in waxed paper and put into the fridge. I took out one wedge at a time, cut it into 12 pieces and put the pieces on a cookie sheet in the freezer. This allowed me to form one at a time, and it worked great. Now for the bad news--I have to break ranks with the previous reviewers--I was disappointed in this cookie (even though I used high quality cocoa and upped the amount to one cup to make it more chocolatey). The cookies were good, but NOT excellent. My husband and I concluded that it is due to the quality of the candy--just not enough of a true caramel flavor--would probably be fabulous with homemade caramel!

Raelly great texture, but I found that more often than not, when we bit into them, we pulled out the whole Rolo caramel in one bite, leaving a half a chocolate cookie with a hole in it, and not any special taste to the remaining chocolate portion. If you like these flavors together, try "Caramel Brownies II" from this website.  They are awesome and have a more even distribution of caramel in them.

Wow!  This is an outstanding cookie.  Instead of using Rolos, I filled with Cheryl's "Chocolate Covered Caramels" (Christmas Cookbook) without dipping the caramels in chocolate.  I split the dough into 16 pieces by cutting in 4 pieces then each of those into 4 pieces again.  I rolled each piece into a ball before putting them back into the bowl for refrigeration.  I took out one ball at a time and cut it into 3 pieces.  I never had a problem with sticky dough.  I left the cookies on the sheet for 5 minutes before I removed them and didn't have any problems.  Thank you everyone for all the tips and tricks.  I think you've made my cookie baking experience a lot easier.  And Thanks Lisa for the wonderful recipe.  I think it will become a Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Birthday, Anniversary, and Gift-giving favorite!

I made these cookies and used rolo candies and I also put about 1/4 more cocoa in the batter and the cookies were perfect ! I used parchment paper and no messes at all! Super moist chewy and a yummy surprise in the middle with walnuts on top !

Mine didn't look anything like the pictures, they spread out really far, and the caramel leaked EVERYWHERE.
Everyone that tried them really liked them though, so they were a victory.

Crazy fun!  Mixed as per recipe the day before and refrigerated for Christmas Eve cookie bake with the cousins (age 17-24).  I planned to use Dove Peppermint bark, Caramel Sea Salt Choc., mini PB cups and mini choc. fudge candies with corresponding toppings that corresponded with the fillings.  I demoed how much dough to use, to make sure candy was covered and what topping went with which filling and set them to work.  I returned to a kitchen filled with hysterical laughter and the cousins wrapping just about anything they could find with the  chocolate cookie dough!  After redoing some of the hockey puck sized cookies to more uniform sizes, all were baked on parchment paper.  None leaked.  Do not over bake.  The smaller ones were a little too firm, but still tasted good.  I'm sure uniform sizes would have helped.   The fun continued as everyone would pause when someone bit into a cookie, and peals of laughter would erupt over the cookie filling.  The gingerbread cookie filling was actually quite good!  The cousins are already planning a rematch next Christmas!  (A fun, but somewhat scary thought!)

These were pretty good. Although I did think they were much better warm, once cooled the caramel is a bit tough to eat. My number 1 piece of advice is parchment paper! The first batch stuck to the spatula and to the tray despite it being greased, I did the second batch on parchment and that worked perfectly.

These were a huge hit with the family.  Fairly simple to make.  I couldn't find chocolate-covered caramels, so I used regular Kraft caramels. 8 mins seemed perfect.

EXCELLENT!  Made as written (other than omitting nuts) for my Milk Dud-loving husband.  Both he and my daughter agreed that they are good warm but best when they have cooled completely.  The caramel stays soft inside.  Keeper!

Normally when I make a recipe for the first time, I do it exactly as written and make changes later. But I decided to use other reviews and add extra cocoa. That was a mistake. They came out way too rich like that. For the caramel candies, I used Cadbury caramel filled chocolate (just like a carmello). I expected it to be ooey gooey but it wasn't. When the caramel was warm, it was stiff. It wasn't gooey until they were completely cool. Also after sitting for about a week or so, the caramel completely absorbed into the cookie. I'd like to make these again but with some of my own changes.

I made some changes when I made these cookies. I used Red Mill Almond Flour about 3 cups instead of all purpose. The almond flour gave it a more nutty butter flavour as well as softer cookie. I also used 1/2 stick of butter crisco and 1/2 stick of salted butter for my 1 cup of butter. I added about half cup of white chocolate morsels in with the Walnuts. This cookie turned out fantastic. I like that I added the crisco, almond flour, and white chocolate.

I made the dough for this one morning and ran out of all purpose flour so I ended up using 1/3 cup bread flour to top off to 2 1/4 cups, once I had all the dry added I mixed with the paddle on slow speed until color was consistent then added the liquids, mixed on slow until mixer started to work then switched to the dough hook and mixed on slow speed until consistent shape and color it will be sticky, transferred to another bowl and covered the bowl with a shower cap  (elastic edge and cheap) and put it in the fridge until the next morning. I had unwrapped the caramels and had in the fridge as well to match temperature with dough, they went together very well. I was so curious I actually watched them melt down and shape. They came out soft but firm as hoped and tasted just like a little brownie, my wife and two sons loved them. 

I will be making these again, next batch I will chill 1/2 of them and with a sharp knife cut them into 1/2 then 1/2 again cross diagonally so you have 4 equal little pie shapes, then into containers. I will then bring out as many as required, warm as necessary, add to ice cream with a hot fudge or caramel sauce topping. Quick dessert or tv snack.

One of my new favorites! This recipe is delicious! I love the aromatic flavor of black walnuts, so I used them in these cookies. What a success! You have to try these.

Real great chocolate dough used it with rolos and did half with maraschino cherries without nuts on top.  Like a lot of reviews  did not refrigerator them and they came out beautifully.

LOVE!  I followed other reviewers and added extra flour, coco and vanilla. I also swapped pecans for the walnuts. These are a great addition to Xmas cookie collection. Different and delicious!

These are so yummy! I used Rolos and refrigerated the dough. I made the recipe as stated minus the nuts and did not dip in sugar and nuts.I had no problems at all with the dough being crumbly as others have stated. The dough was very pliable and easy to work with. Will definitely make again.

The cookies were amazing! They had too much chocolate in them, due to the fact  my brother was controlling the measuring cup. They were definitely better when they were warm, the caramels got a little hard.  All in all, they turned out well.

AWESOME cookies.  I used rolos.  I found it much easier to make my fingers damp to work with the dough instead of using flour.  The chocolate cookie tastes great and has a great texture.  So, I also used the dough for peanut butter filled cookies.  Same concept as the caramel, but I mixed 3/4 cup peanut butter and 3/4 cup confectioner sugar to make teaspoon size peanut butter balls and wrapped them in this dough.  The results were amazing!

I make these every Christmas minus the nuts and sugar on the outside and they are hit every time. I use Caramel Hersey's Kisses which are always out during the holidays.  I would not recommend leaving the dough for more than a few hours as it gets more and more difficult to handle.

This a great recipe although a little messy and sticky as many have identified.  To help with that I kept my fingers floured and chilled the batter and candy in the freezer.  I used caramel Hershey's kisses which are really good.  Next time I think I'll try milky way simply caramels and also drizzle caramel on the top.

These are really good and I'm fairly certain the kids will enjoy them (I sure did).  Have only had warm, so not sure how caramel will be when eaten cold.  Halved recipe and made as instructed with only exceptions being to add 1/4 tsp salt and using coffee extract instead of vanilla.  Came out with exactly 24 cookies, none of which leaked.  Dough is quite sticky but dusting fingers and palm with cocoa powder took care of that.  My cookies stayed pretty much as placed on the sheet - didn't spread out - and as I used Rolo candies that had a nice puffy exterior with the creamy melted chocolate interior.  Will make again.

They have to be large cookies to cover an entire caramel, and the chocolate part is kind of dry and not too tasty. Not my favorites...

I will make these again, for sure.  I used mini Rolos so I didn't get too much of the caramel flavor I was looking for.  Per others recommendations, I also added some extra cocoa and white sugar.  I did grind some sea salt on top of the cookies as they came out of the oven too.  YUM!

Good cookies but with about half of the cookies the caramel ran out of the cookie onto the baking sheet.
Not sure if there is a way to prevent this. Would make again

These were not hard to make and were yummy. I used the caramel hershey kisses. I'd say about 1 out of every 6 cookies burst while baking, but I just shoved the caramel back towards the cookie with my spatula and let them dry like that. I used for Christmas cookie tray platters, and they were a bit sticky and gooey for that but they taste great so who cares!

Really liked this cookie. I think they would have been much better if I used the nuts that are called for, but we have a family member with nut allergies. These turned out very good anyways. Used Rolos, as they are nut free and it made a nice gooy caramel cookie.

This recipe is REALLY good.  Perhaps one of my all time favorite cookies ever!  I had not made it for several years and my husband requested them, so I made them - and added a twist!!  First off I wlll say that I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I learned that if you don't put enough dough around the rolo, it WILL explode - I had a whole pan of exploded ones because I was being skimpy with the dough....so of course, I ran out of rolos and had dough left.  I remembered that I had some left over mini candbars from halloween - you know - the bite sized ones.  We made cookies with butterfinger, snickers, milky way, baby ruth and 3 muskateers in them AMAZING!!!!!  I think my favorite is still the rolos, but man....those butterfinger cookies were pretty great, too!

You really need to use a soft chew caramel in these otherwise the caramels harden too much. They weren't on the novice side either. You need to make sure you have enough dough around the caramels otherwise they leak out and burn the caramel.

I absolutely loved the texture of this cookie! I used Halloween caramels and they were absolutely fantastic for this recipe, except they can toughen up after the cookies cool. However, I definitely advise adding salt to this recipe because the chocolate flavor can fall a bit flat without it. Aside from this, great recipe!

These are delicious.  The only thing I did differently was added a full cup of chocolate and didn't refrigerate at all.  I missed that part in the directions when I read it the first time and I wasn't willing to wait.  I used Werther's Original Chewy Caramels in them.  Yummy.

Quite possibly my new favorite Christmas cookie!  Following other reviews Hershey caramel kisses are perfection!  Nice and gooey in the middle!  It is possible to work with them without refrigerating, BUT it is much easier if you pop them in the fridge for about 10 minutes or so, then in between trays while baking.  I'm not a huge fane of any nuts so I skipped them altogether.  But the best topping was the sugar coating and just a tad of sea salt on each!!!!  A real treat!

This was so disappointing.  It had great reviews so I tried the recipe and did not stray from the recipe at all.  It had a very strange flavor and the chocolate flavor was very minimal.  This was a waste of ingredients...family won't eat them.

I am the best Mom in the world after the kids tasted these cookies!  Easy and delicious, these cookies are a hit.  I used President's Choice carmel cups and 1/4 cup more of the flour.  I put the cookies in the fridge for 1 hour before cooking and every single cookie was perfect!
Use a scoop to get them same size every time.

I have made these for years and my Grandchildren love them....I agree I use Rolos also and they are a pain to unwrap. I think I will try a little sea salt sprinkled on top like Lisa suggested. thank you for sharing I keep my hands damp and the dough does not stick to my hands so bad.

sooooo good!! dough was fabulously moist and perfect with the caramel. I used caramello's, however, still desire more of a gooey caramel middle. ONce the cookies cool, it just tastes like a piece of the candy in the cookie, as opposed to a cookie with a gooey caramel filling. hmm.

While these cookies are not the most dazzling in appearance, they certainly make up for it with taste (my husband has named them Happy Fun Rocks).  I adjusted the dry ingredients as suggested, and used the "work up from the bottom to make a pocket around the rolo" method.  Worked great, no leaks, just a LOT of tasty cookies ... and I already have requests for more.

Followed this recipe to a "T"...  Well, almost.  I didn't think I would like all the cookies dipped in the walnut/sugar mixture, but after I tried one after coming out of the oven, I changed my mind.  The walnut topping is the "icing on the cake" for this already phenomenal cookie.  I ate 5 right out of the oven!  If you like chocolate, nuts and caramel, you will love this cookie!

These cookies are awesome! I fill them with caramels, peppermint patties, and truffles.  The dough really does need time in the fridge in order to work, and it helps the cookie keep its shape in the oven.

These were some of the best cookies I made this Christmas, very rich and delicious! They were so chewy and good. I chopped the nuts very fine so I didn't have big chunks of them in the dough.

This cookie is amazingly delicious and always a hit at parties and cookie exchanges.  I make it every year.

I think the few members who have rated this 1 or 2 stars need to learn a term called "user error."

Fabulous! I made these for our cookie exchange tomorrow. I can't wait to hear the same raves that I got from my husband who was my taste tester! I used Rolos too, as long as you don't cook longer than the 8 minutes, you shouldn't have any problems with the cookies spreading or the caramel leaking. Definately a keeper! Thanks!

I am so NOT a baker, so I will admit making these was a little challenging - I only have a hand mixer and the dough is a little stiff.  However, I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were great.  I used rolos.  Nothing leaked and the center stayed soft. As far as dough stickiness, it was NOT that bad at all.  I refrigerated mine for about an hour, that's all, and kept a bowl of water next to me to dip my fingers in and it worked fine.  I'd recommend taking half out of the fridge at a time.  I just rolled dough into a ball, pressed into it with my finger, inserted the rolo, and then instead of trying to "work" the dough all up and over, I just took another small bit and plopped it on the top, sealing the edges.  I put the candy in the freezer when I put the dough in the fridge, so it was firm to work with.  There was nothing complicated about putting in the candy.  Time and temp were right on. This was a "practice" batch for an exchange in a few days.  I think they'll be a hit!

Tasty!  These cookies were delicious.  I used milk duds and hershey's caramel kisses.  I think the kisses worked better.  Also, I only used 3/4 of the sugar specified in the recipe and still thought it was too sweet.  Ill try 1/2 next time.

I've made these cookies several times and always love them. I made them recently for a 'Holiday Bake-a-thon' with friends and they were a HUGE hit. Super easy, look great and taste even better!! One tip-- don't use 'Rolos'. The caramel in Rolos gets stiff and chewy after baked. My favorite caramels to use are Caramilk Minis.

mmm so delicious and SO easy.  I didn't change a thing from the recipe.  I baked on parchment paper which prevented the cookies from burning and sticking to the pan (no leaks!) and I used plastic gloves when I worked with the dough (which I did refrigerate for a few hours) which kept my hands from getting sticky.  I'll definitely make these again, and try using different kinds of chocolate candies in the center, too!

OMG! These are the best cookies I have ever had! I cut the recipe in half after reading the reviews about the dough being difficult to work with. I used rolos because they are one of our favorites and they worked great. I found that if I dipped my fingers in water before making each cookie, the dough was easy to work with and the cookies turned out perfectly shaped. I didn't sprinkle the tops with sugar because I didn't think they needed it and we don't like walnuts so I left those out too. Make sure to leave them on the pan until cooled, otherwise the caramel will leak like crazy!

These were good but they seemed to dry out kind of fast.  I stored them in locking containers between wax paper-but they still dried out in two days.  So if you are making these-eat them quickly!

These were my family's favorites this Christmas. I didn't change a thing - they are a little time consuming, but worth it! I didn't find the dough too difficult to work with as some reviewers mentioned. I also used Rolos.

Delicious! I used hershey's kiss' with caramel. Fairly easy to put together, especially once you get a process. I used the revised proportions.

This recipe was really simple and the cookies are AMAZING... taste like brownies... I used about 1/4 cup more flour, but I added it in after mixing the original ingredients together, it is a bit stick but adding the additional flour, it's fine. I only stuck it in the fridge for about 20 min and it didn't seem to matter. I also used peanute butter cup and they were YUM.

These are really good.  I just refrigerated the dough, grabbed a chunk of dough, stuck a Rolo in the middle and rolled it all together in a ball.  Once you get the hang of it, it goes very fast.  I Think I might try this with Kraft caramels next time so there's more of a caramel flavor and less chocolate.

These were an awful lot of work and I don't think I'd bother making them again.  My dough was very sticky and I had to throw it into the freezer periodically to make it workable.  The cookies were bigger than I usually make my cookies, but it was of necessity as it takes a lot of dough to cover a Rollo.  I like the caramel surprise inside them, but they're not a WOW cookie in my book.

My husband really enjoyed these cookies but I thought they were just ok.  I used Rolos - maybe I will try something else next time - they weren't quite as caramel flavored as I expected.  I think the batter would make a good plain chocolate cookie.  I omitted the nuts and added extra flour/cocoa as someone else suggested.  These cookies don't spread out on the pan much - so you can place them close together to bake a lot at one time.  I only chilled the dough for an hour and I had no problem with it being sticky as others mentioned.  I might make them again one day but they aren't going on the favorite list.

Very good recipe that I use every year at Christmas. I did change a one thing: instead of Rollos I inserted Milk Duds and peppermint patties into the center of the cookie. Using Milk Duds had the advantage of not having to unwrap the candies but you need to microwave the cookies for a few seconds if you want to eat one with gooey caramel in the center. Great cookie! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Not enough stars available!  So yummy.  I used Caramoo caramels cut in half, green and black dark mint chocolate squares and Endangered species mint chocolate.  The mint choco ones were awesome!  The carmel was good too, but the dark choco in the middle with the mint made me forget about my diet!  My nex thought will be to try junior mints or some healthy version of that with no artificial flavors.  The dough really does need to be super chilled.  I had a hard time with the first two trays, but then just scooped out enough in my palm for each cookie and rolled it from there.  These will make great xmas gifts, very nice looking when baked.

These are pretty yummy cookies. Definitely don't ignore the part where it says to allow the cookies to cool before moving to wire racks... I moved my first batch too soon and the caramel ended up leaking out the bottom. Also, if I make these again I probably won't chill the dough, as I found it much easier to work with after it had warmed up. Thanks!

These are great cookies, but a pain to make.  If you are looking for a pretty cookie that gives the WOW effect, then make these.  They are very good.  However they do take a long time.  This is what I changed.  I used a Dark Chocolate coco power. Then instead of dividing up the dough a bunch of times I just kept the big bowl in the fridg and took a little out at a time and made my cookies.  If the dough starts to warm up then it is impossible to work with, must keep it chilled.

I really liked these!  I didn't have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  I followed the recipe and used Dove caramel filled choclates.  I experienced to running of caramel with these.  They tasted much better than the Rollo ones I tried just to compare.  Neither ran, and I didn't even put them in the fridge.  Made them right from the mixer.  Not sure if I'll like them as much cold, but they are divine right out of the oven!

I should have read the comments before I made this recipe.  The original recipe is miserable to do and did not raise.  I adjusted the recipe based on previous review by adding the extra 1/4 c. flour, 1/3 c. cocoa, & 1/2 t. salt plus I substituted the butter with shortening and removed the nuts and they came out beautiful.  My mother always used shortening with her chocolate chip cookies and swears that's why they raise.

This recipe is so good!  I followed it exactly (and did find that it had to be chilled 2 or more hours for ease in working with the dough).  I used chocolate covered milky way caramels (didn't read previous reviews and will use rolos or the hershey next time!) the problem with the milky way was the rectangular shape/rather large/odd to roll dough around...so I had to make 9X4 instead of 12X4 cookies.  But still delicious.  A definite keeper.

Delish!!  We (my son and I) followed other reviewer's suggestions and used caramel filled Hershey's Kisses, added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and a half teaspoon of salt to the dough.  As well we didn't use the walnuts and scaled the cocoa down to 1/3 cup.  AWESOME!!  Next time I'm going to try with Kraft caramels cut in half.

Very good.  Dough does need to be refrigerated while you aren't using it - gets very soft.  I didn't use nuts and they were still great.

I have been using this recipe for years. Sometimes I add white chocolate chips to the cookie.  I have also changed the caramel filling to almond bark with different flavorings.  Mint flavoring is my favorite!

For the past few years I have made the same cookies/baked goods for christmas.  This year I wanted to try something else.  WOW!  These are so good I have to make a second batch as my husband ate too many and he's already requesting more.  Fairly easy to make and as long as you make sure you refrigerate the dough as directed it isn't too hard to work with.  Excellent and will definitely be on my baking list for years to come.

Fabulous cookies - the dough is very sticky to work with...I store it in the freezer for an hour before I work with it and take a small bit out at a time.  Rolos work perfectly.

People at the office just love these cookies! I omit the nuts &roll the entire cookie in sugar- even though I  double the recipe, these people pleasers are gone in seconds flat!  I've done a version using mint filled candies (just a hint- cut larger candies in half or the mint can be over-powering).  Thank you Lisa for this wonderful recipe!!

These were excellent cookies!  They turned out perfectly using parchment paper.  They were a bit more work since you have to unwrap all the candies and roll each cookie but well worth it!

I missed the part about letting them cool on the cookie sheet first, so first batch leaked on wax paper.  Other than my mistake, these cookies were great and loved by my family.

The caramel kept falling out and I had to use a ton of dough to keep that from happening.  Still they tasted good even withouth the caramel.

I have made these the past two christmas' and always get great feedback on them.  The dough does get a bit sticky so you have to work fast, but I have found that if I spray my hands with Pam cooking spray it is much easier to work with.  Lets face it, your hands are going to get messy anyway while making these cookies anyway so why not do whatever you can to make it easier on yourself!  These cookies are great and well worth the mess!!

These went on my Christmas cookie plates this year. The dough is very easy to work with and covers the candy quite well. The cookie tastes like a brownie with caramel in the middle. I would recommend cooling them on a flat surface, not wire racks. The caramel oozed out of some of the cookies and got stuck on the wire.

I had to add another 1/4 cup of flour, but other than that, these were great! I've got orders from family to make more.  For future reference... mini rolos need about 20g of dough and normal rolos need 25g.  I sliced the dough and wrapped it around the rolo - had very few that spilled out but they still tasted good.  Enjoy.  We did and will again. Thanks

this recipe was very time consuming but the end result was wonderful.  After chilling the dough i found spraying pam on my handswhile I form the cookies and put them on the cookie pan worked wonderfully and had hardly any problems with the dough being hard to work with.  I had no problems with leekage and used Milkyway Caramels along with Rolo's and Reeses peanut butter cups.  Everyone loved them!  The only problem I had was the middle cooking completely.  Some said that they seemed a but undercooked, maybe I will leave them in longer.  Great recipe, will do again for next christmas!!

I omitted the nuts, used Rolo candies, and refrigerated the dough overnight.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they were wonderful.  I did not find that the dough was too difficult to work with as long as it was kept cold.  These will be a great addition to my Christmas cookie tray!

I used Milk Duds for this and I thought they were a bit too chewey for such a soft cookie.  The dipping in the walnut/sugar mixture didn't stick very well.  Next time, I'd try a different center and melt a piece of chocoate on the tops when they come out of the oven instead of the dipping.

This cookie is great! I made them brought them to work and one girl said it was the best cookie she ever had and she said she doesn't eat a lot of sweets.I do think warming the cookie the nest day is the best way to eat it, as the caramel hardens a bit.
I also think using rolo's would be a great idea.I have to say they're really great and expect to eat more then one!!!

My family and I loved these cookies.  I read some of the reviews about them being dry, so I sdid add an extra 1/4 cup butter.  I have had them in a container for 4 days no and they are still moist and fresh.  YUMMY!!

Awesome cookie! I took all of the advice from fellow bakers and added more flour and more cocoa and I added a dash more of Baking soda the 2nd batch. I didn't use walnuts though. They were fairly easy too. I kept the dough in the fridge while they baked to keep it the right consistency. All in all, I will make these again. My kids thought they tasted like brownies! I can't wait to exchange them at the cookie swap!! They are definitley going to win best cookie!

The first year I made these I was annoyed about how much work they were. But this was my third year in a row making them for Christmas and they are always a hit. I have them down to a science now and don't mind the work. They are a Christmas favorite in my home.

I'm sorry but I don't care for these at all. I am not sure why all the hype over these. They were a lot of work and got very dry very quickly. I was asked for the recipe so I guess that is a plus, but they were best underbaked and out of the oven. Otherwise given time to sit, thes became so blah. I also had to add some salt to the recipe to give it a little flavor because it was way to bland. That improved it a little. My family didn't care for thse much either.

I would have to say this is just an okay cookie, despite the yummy ingrediants.  They didn't stay very fresh tasting, and just seemed kind of dry.  The caramel just isn't enough...maybe a peanut butter cup would be better.

I really had high hopes for this recipe & couldn't wait to try it, but it just didn't work out like expected.  I used the rolo's for the center, don't get me wrong...any kind of cookie is great, but like the previous review said "it was alot of work, but not delicious enough to make them again"

I originally followed this recipe exactly, and the dough was so wet it spread all over the cookie sheet.  You MUST add additional flour.  We tried an assortment of things in the center: york peppermint patty "bites", milk maid caramels, caramelo bar squares, and Rolos.  My kids liked the peppermints, my dh and I preferred the caramels.  The Rolos made an odd looking hump in the middle of the cookie.  The caramelo square didn't provide enough filling.  The cookies are best the same day.  They were alot of work, and not delicious enough for me to make them again.

These cookies are okay.  I used Hershey's cocoa & did not think they were chocolately enough.  They are easy to make & others seemed to like them, but I thought they were bland.  I used rolo candies in most of them, but ran out so I used half a reisen candy in the others.  If I make them again, I will use dutch cocoa or some other richer chocolate tasting cocoa.

Rich, fairly good cookies. I made half with Rolo candies and half with Riesens candies. I liked the Rolos better. The Riesens are a larger candy and they leaked out of the cookies onto the pan while the rolo candy all stayed inside the cookie and the Rolo caramel stayed firmer. These cookies dry out extremely fast.

We enjoyed these made with both peppermint patties and Caramilk bar pieces.  I baked them only 6 1/2 - 7 minutes and they were great.  I even forgot to dip them in the nuts and sugar.   My kids really liked them!  Only 4 stars is because they dried out quickly even with the shorter baking time.  We probably will make again, though.

My husband & I made these cookies a few days before Christmas.  The cookies are very tasty but hard to wrap Rolo around dough even though we refrigerated dough over 2 hours.  We won't make these again.

Very good cookies, but a little time-consuming  to make and they get hard fast so eat quickly!! I found that Rolos are the best choice to put in the middle.

I love these. They were so easy, and they taste soooo good. They smell like brownies when baking. Yummmmmm. I did a boo-boo at the end (from not reading the direction carefully, but they still came out GREAT! Instead of only adding 1/2 the walnuts to the batter and saving the other 1/2 for on top, I added them all in the end. I didn't put anything on top, no sugar nothing. I think they tasted just fine this way, and I will probably do it this way always, since it eliminates a step, hehe. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this recipe for the holidays! Requests have been made in advance by the children as their "birthday cookie" of choice (to take to school).  I did reveiw the suggestions of others here, however choose to follow the recipe as it was using Nestle's Treasures - Carmel - hmmmmmmmm our first trial run of cookies lasted less than 5 minutes.  As soon as I put them on the plate they were eaten as quickly! Wonderful!

These are so good.  Don't be afraid of them!  They're not that messy.  I don't even chill the dough that long.  I add a bit more flour and cocoa as suggested.  I have used different varieties of Nestle Treasures.  The peanut butter ones are really good and don't "explode."

Fantastic, unique cookie.  I made these and froze them.  You can get a few out, put them on a plate, and nuke them in the microwave for a few seconds to make the centers soft.  Just add milk!

These cookies were sooo delicious. One of the best I've tasted - like caramel filled brownies. I used typical caramel squares and when the cookies first came out of the oven, the caramel was so soft and yummy. Later, after they have cooled, you may want to put them in the microwave for 10 seconds to soften the caramel before eating or the caramel will be back to candy texture.

Wonderful cookies -- chewy, chocolatey, not overly sweet. A bit of work, but worth it. I made half a recipe to give away on Valentine's Day. Now I wish I had kept them!

Today is Valentine's Day and I decided to make these cookies for my husband.  He better get home REALLY quick, because I might eat them all before he gets here!  These were so quick and easy, and they're virtually mess-up proof!  I used caramel Nestle Treasures.  These are delicious!!!

these cookies are delicious.  i waited at least 5 minutes before removing the cookies from the sheet and i didn't have leakage problems at all.  very easy to make!  these cookies are best 1-2 days after you make them when they are fresh.

Very good cookie!  I didn't have any caramel candy, so I just filled them with 4-5 chocolate chips and used just enough dough to wrap around the chips.  Also I cooked them for 5-6 minutes or till some of the cookies started to crack.  Thanks for the recipe!

I lost my recipe for these great cookies and was so happy to find it here!  These are favorites in our house.  They are good right out of the oven AND several days later - if they last that long!  They are surely worth the effort of making each ball.  Try to make sure you seal the candy inside the cookie dough so as not to get "leaky" cookies!  Enjoy!

My husband and all the neighborhood teens loved these cookies.  I tried them with several different candies for them to test.  Riesens and Reeses mini peanut butter cups were the best.  These are very sweet so you can't eat too many at one sitting.  They were still very moist and soft the next day.

These were big hit cookies for christmas time, The only problem I had was they were big cookies to make sure I got the carmel covered enough. I like to have bite size cookies for Christmas because there are some many varites that every one would like to try them all.

This cookie is a true delicacy.  I read previous reviews and added the additional ingredients.  The dough was not sticky at all.  I will definately make this recipe again, especially at the holidays.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used both Rolos and Reisans, as those were the only chocolate covered caramels I could find. The caramel gets a little hard after the cool completely, best when eaten warm from the oven.

I made these for my husband's cookie exchange and everyone loved them!  I used Rolos and the caramel did seem to get a little hard.  Next time, I'll try to use a softer caramel.  Also, the dough gets very sticky- but these cookies are worth the effort!

These are AWESOME!!!  They were gone before I knew it.  They're very easy to make, but they taste like a million bucks!  I also wrapped the dough around marshmallows and they were a real hit.

I made these cookies for the first time this holiday season.  Everyone who tastes them absolutely loves them!!!  These cookies have become some of my family and friends favorites!  Everyone is surprised to find the caramel inside and have no clue how it got there!  Just a tip:  if the cookie dough becomes too soft or sticky just stick the piece you were working with in the refrigerator for a few minutes.  It'll harden right up and you can start working again.  I used rolos and they came out perfect.

I made the suggested adjustments of flour, cocoa, and salt and the cookies tasted great.  Unsure if they were worth quite that much trouble though. I used half rolos and half Nestles Treasures.  The rolos turned out great, but the Nestle Treasures stayed in balls, and made more of a chocolate filled cookie than caramel.  Overall, great tasting cookies...mess, time, and easieness factors will probably prevent me from trying them again though.

I followed this recipe with none of the recommended adjustments, and had no problems.  These cookies were wonderful the same day they were baked, but got a little hard the following day, even though I sealed them up in an airtight container.  Maybe I baked them too long?

I made these for my husband to bring to work and he was lucky he had any to bring! They are sotasty, they seem intimidating to make, but are easy and turn out great...and I can't bake to save my life! I plan to make these for every party I go to from now on! MMMMMMMMM! Oh yeah, make sure to have pleanty of milk on hand, they go great together. I omitted the nuts and they still turned out good! Theonly suggestion I'd make is watch the size of your cookie to see how they turn out. Different sizes turn out the same, lol! Once you get the hang of it you'll be fine. I used Rolos, will try Risens next time! I love those!

Outstanding cookie.  My husband pouted when he discovered I was taking them to neighbor's for Christmas gifts-I had to bag them quickly before he ate them all!  Very nice flavor and texture-a real keeper!  I made the recommended flour, cocoa and salt adjustments also.

These cookies taste great, but they are a little crumbly.   Allow to cool completely before removing from cookie sheet to lessen the crumbliness.

Yup..this one is sooo good for chocolate cravers...brownieish but not so much that it loses it's cookie quality. I used Reisens..soo good and I cut them in 1/2 cause I wanted to make smaller cookies for Christmas boxes..BTW all the recipients  LOVED them!!! Go ahead ladies...need a chocolate fix? this is the one...Or CHOCOLATE CAVITY MAKER CAKE...either one will do the trick...ENJOY!

Holy Cow!  These are like a little piece of heaven in your mouth.  We had a Christmas party and they only lasted about an hour.  These do get kind of mushy when right out of the oven so I waited about 5-10 minutes to transfer them to wire racks. I also used Rolos as they don't sell any other kind of carmel candies in Canada!

These cookies are great.  I am not very creative at baking and the same old chocolate chip cookies can get a little boring.  I made these cookies and brought them to my office.  Everyone loved them.  I had to bring in the recipe the next day.  I plan on making them for the holidays and bringing them to my family.  This is an excellent recipe.

This really comes out looking fancy. When people bite into the cookie and get the chocolate and caramel you can see their eyes light up.  VERY NICE.  Thanks.  Much better when they are warm and the center is soft.

My husband really likes these cookies. I didn't find the dough difficult to work with; I just put it in the freezer for 30 minutes before shaping. They are very rich, I could only eat one at a time. I used Rolos and was pleased with the result. Next time I may try different nuts, like cashews perhaps.

Excellent!  I made half the batch with regular caramels and half with rollos.  Most people preferred the caramels over the rollos but both were verrrry good!

I just made these today. They are wonderful. I used Gertrude Hawk smidgeon caramels. I also tried a caramel the size of a peanut butter cup. That came out great - nice and gooey.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I is guaranteed to bring raves. Its like having the best brownies with candy inside. I baked a batch of these, packed them in a box and toted them with me on an airline trip. On day 3 they were still tasty, but not as good as that first day. I microwaved a few and "revived" them. They do get stale quickly, so if you are baking for a special event plan to bake the night before or day of. KUDOS to the person who designd this recipe. It is now a family favorite to be passed along in our multi-generational cookbooks.

Pretty yummy. I had to bake it a tad longer than 8 minutes because the dough didn't quite cook all the way through. I wrapped the cookies on a plate, wrapped 'em in colored cellephane, and added a little bow -- it made a great birthday gift!

Wow these cookies are something.  Right out of the oven they are fantastic, but as they cool the carmel rehardens making them a bit difficult to chew through.  I added 1/2 cup more flour, 1/4 cup more cocoa, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and omitted the walnuts all together.  They were easy to make.  They were messy rolling up the candy inside them.  I used rollos and resins (24 of each).  Very brownie like.  I baked them for 9 minutes on parchemnt paper lined cookie sheets.  I pulled the paper right onto the cooling rack after about 3 minutes cooling in the pan.  None of mine broke or oozed.  Good cookies.

This is a wonderful recipe and not hard to make at all.   Make sure the dough is well chilled and you won’t have a problem with the dough being sticky.  I’ll definitely make these cookies again.

This cookie has a wonderful flavor and with the caramel inside  a little something extra . I had trouble with the first batch. But fixed it when i placed all the other dough in plastic wrap and formed logs and placed it in the fridg for couple minutes  before putting the rollo in the center. I'll make this cookie over and over .

I cooled the cookies on the cookie sheets for 5+ minutes and continued to cool on a flat surface.  There was no problem with caramel "leakage" at all.  Very easy to make.  Since I only used enough dough to cover the candy, the recipe yielded more than 48 cookies and I liked how the cookie was not that big.  A very moist and chocolatey cookie.  I used Rolos and Reeses peanut butter cups.  I liked the Rolo version better.

I was expecting the greatest cookies ever. Unfortunately they let me down a little.  But they still were very good. I experimented a little by adding 1/4 cup of flour as some suggested, pecans instead of walnuts, and along with Rolos I used mini Reese's PB cups and PB Nestle Treasures. If you like peanut butter the ones with Nestle Treasures were awesome! Even though they did not live up to the hype I will still make them again.

Absolutely loved these cookies.  We made these for 4th of July BBQ and there were none left.  I left the nuts out of the recipe and used Chocolate Reisens for the caramel (made it even more chocolately!).  They are really fabulous right out of the oven!

We really loved these cookies! I made them for a July 4th BBQ and all four dozen were inhaled within hours. I had no trouble at all working with the dough, since I used 2-1/2 cups of flour instead of 2-1/4 cups. I put it in the fridge for two hours, then pulled out a batch of dough at a time to work with. No measuring, just a tablespoon or so of dough wrapped around a Rolo! I also used pecans instead of walnuts, and used the entire cup of nuts in the cookie dough and only rolled the cookie dough ball in sugar. The resulting cookie tasted like a yummy brownie with caramel tucked neatly inside! No leakage, no mess, and one of the few times I had perfect results on the first try!

These cookies were delicious and easy!  I did not find the need to chill the dough.  I divided the dough into fourths and chilled them only for about 20 minutes.  Also no need to roll them - too messy!  Just take a good size chunk of dough (about a tablespoon or more)and pat it around the candy piece.  Make sure the candy piece is completely covered!  The cookies will flatten as they bake into circles.  Only bake them the 8 mins. as suggested.  Cool on cookies sheet about 3-4 mins. before moving them to the wire rack.  I used  "Nestle-Treasures" with caramel filling - not "Rolos".  My kids loved them!

I must say these were outstanding. My husband, as well as my children, devoured these. I only had one for myself to enjoy! (The dough was tasty though.) Have added to my recipe collection and will make again.... very soon.

I sort of disappointed in all the reviewers who said that making these cookies were just too messy. I always thought the joy of cooking was the mess. I love how my hands turned a rich chocolatey brown after I've rolled a few dozen cookies. These cookies have made me the hit of every cookie party and potluck I've attended since I found this wonderful recipe. Everyone's always buzzing about who made the chocolate/caramel cookies. I also love the way we dip them into sugar and nuts, it gives the cookies a gourmet appearence. Thank you Lisa for sharing such an inspired recipe.

I have alot to say about this recipes. First of all how does it supposed to look like? :A flat cookies with Rolo as part of the ingredient or chocolate ball with runny caramel in it? I followed the recipes step by step, imagining a beautiful choc ball,unfortunately it "collapsed" when I placed them in oven and it filled the whole baking tray !I had to cut them into smaller pieces !I would be really appreciated if someone could tell me what went wrong during the process. Anyhow the tastes and aroma were excellent and I still got loads of compliment.Thanks:)

These are absolutely wonderful, and look great when dipped in nonpareils!  The dough is messy when wrapping around the candies, but flouring the hands helps.

My daughter and I enjoyed making and eating these!  The only thing I would recommend is that you leave them on the cookie sheet at least two minutes before removing so that the rolo doesn't melt out of the bottom and drip everywhere.  Other than that, excellent find!

I followed this recipe to a "T" and the cookies spread out so only a little bit of the middle had candy in them. Regardless everyone ate them up, I will have to experiment next time...YUM WORTH THE TRY!

These cookies are yummy!  I'm impatient so instead of refigerating the dough for a couple of hours, I put the dough in the freezer while I washed the dishes and unwrapped the Rolos.  Worked great!

These cookies are probably the best that I have ever made.  They are very rich.  I followed the advice of the other reviews and only worked with about 3 or 4 pieces of dough at a time and it wasn't too sticky.  Try these!

I made these for Christmas.  I don't like caramel, so I cut a mini peanut butter cup in half and used it instead.  These are very, very good and did not last long on the cookie tray.

Oh the agony is right when it comes to making these yummy cookies, the dough was very sticky even after refrigerating for a full day.  I had to bake mine about 2 minutes longer,(not sure if that is due to higher altitude).  I would also agree letting the cookie cool on the baking sheet keeps it in one piece. I placed mine on waxed paper in a rubbermaid container to prevent them from sticking together.  I am planning on experimenting before I make these again.

These were the best cookies ever!!  One hint: before eating, put the cookie in the microwave for about 10 seconds.  This makes it taste like its fresh out of the oven, and makes the caramel gooey!  YUM!

These cookies turned out so good, I almost lost my eyesight. They seem like they will turn out odd, with the Rolos in them, but the Rolo just becomes part of the cookie. The woman in the candy store looked at me really wierd when I sat there counting the number of rolos in a tube.

This was a hit! I did not find them difficult to make, as other reviewers did. It helps to use a cookie scoop, place the candy in the ball of dough after you scoop it, and give it a quick roll in the hands to completely cover the candy. I have had these for 2 weeks in my tupperware, and they are still soft and yummy! I do think they need a bit more chocolate flavor in the cookie itself.

These are delicious right out of the oven when the caramel is still warm and gooey but still great after a couple of days!!!

Great cookie.  I brought some to work and everyone who ate one really liked it.  It is my favorite of the new cookie recipes I've tried.  Unfortunately, it's a bit messy to make... and you do need to buy 2 bags of Rollos, so it's not cheap either.

Great end result, but they do take quite a bit of time to make.  I'd recommend keeping the bowl in the freezer, and taking out enough dough for about 4 cookies at a time.  The dough gets soft, and hard to work with, very quickly.

Mixing this batter at the end is a little difficult but the end result is fabulous!!  I loved them.  I ran out of rolos and put some butterscotch chips in them and that was great too!

I've been making these cookies for a few years and they're always a hit.  One other thing I do that makes them look fancy and professional is I drizzle melted white chocolate (with a bit of Crisco added) over them.  Letting them cool for a few minutes before moving them to a cooling rack helps take care of the caramel dripping through the bottom problem.

My family and friends really liked this recipe.  I used a little less cocoa than called for.  If you apply Crisco to your hands, you won't have a problem with the dough sticking.

I had never tried a similar recipe..I always thought trying to roll dough around a candy would be too much of a pain. I'm glad I didn't let it stop me from trying this recipe! It wasn't too time consuming at all and the cookie is delicious!

This cookie is fantastic - they disappeared at the office and are definitely 
this season's favorite!  The only trick is getting the bottom of the cookie 
thick enough so that the caramel doesn't leak through.

This is a good but very sweet chocolate cookie.  In rounding the dough into balls, I used two spatulas because using my hands was too messy!  If you love chocolate this is the cookie for you.

This is a great cookie!!  The family loved them!!!
Everyone asked, "How did you get the caramel in them"..I will never tell! Orders have been placed for Christmas.  Thank you for this recipe.
