We thought this was a very good meal.  The one and only change I made was to use a different pasta.  I've maybe had a more traditional piccata before, but this was a great meal for us tonight.  My hubby is very grateful tonight, Arica!  Thanks!

Well, I am a little mad at this recipe. I did exactly what it said to do, and it is not thickening at all. I had to add almost the whole container of cheese. I hate when the pictures are nowhere near the real thing.

Very easy and tasty recipe. It went very well with fresh collard greens and baked macaroni and cheese.

While the flavor was good, the texture of the sauce was terrible. I wondered about putting parmesean cheese in a sauce while it was heating, but I followed directions and I was right, it clumped up really bad. So the cheese and capers were all lumped together instead of uniform throughout the sauce.  Clean up was a mess because everything the cheese touched had to be scrubbed to get it off. Thats why I gave it only 2 stars.

have tried several other picatta recipes while looking for a taste comparable to my favorite  dish from a local restaurant, and they were either too dry or too thin, and something lacked in the flavor. The addition to of parmesan to this recipe got my tastebuds singing. it came out amazing. it did seem like much of the lemon had evaporated, so I did add an extra squirt or two when I removed the chicken. the lemon didn't overpower the recipe at all! after trying several recipes, this one is definitely the keeper!

We really liked this recipe.  The sauce is so good.  I think the parm cheese was not needed because it just made the capers clump.  I added a little more lemon and a few pats of butter at the very end to finish it off.

Very good sauce!  I found that it wasn't thickening either, so rather than add more parmesan cheese, I used baking powder to thicken.  I actually used the sauce to fix the leftovers from a similar crockpot recipe.  Don't know what I do wrong, but my chicken breasts always get too dry in the crockpot.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use a skillet, as this recipe does.  This makes a lot more sauce and it is much tastier than te crockpot recipe.  Both my husband and I liked this one.

This was really good.  I read the review about the parm, added a little, yup, it clumped.  I added mushrooms and a little more lemon.  It turned out fabulous.  Thanks Arica, I'll make this one again.
