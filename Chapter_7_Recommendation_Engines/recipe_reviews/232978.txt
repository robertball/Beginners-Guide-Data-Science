Of course I love it, it's mine.  I usually use homemade peanut butter, which has little to no sweetener, so if you are using store bought (even natural) you might want to cut back on the other sweeteners.  Also, some reviewers commented on only boiling the peanut butter mixture 2 minutes, I don't even boil it that long, I just let it come up to a boil, which takes 3-5 minutes from when I turn the heat on.  Love that everyone is playing with the ingredients, change up the cereal, grains, nuts, seeds, chips etc.  The peanut butter chocolate is our favorite and I always use the PB, sometimes with the almonds, sometimes more peanuts.  I have done white chocolate & almonds.  I've used golden Graham's for the cereal, and replace the nuts with mini marshmallow for a s'more like bar.  Did pecans & a white chocolate & cinnamon chip mix.  Enjoy your creations.

Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this since I changed so much, but I thought this recipe was a great reference if you're experimenting with cereal/granola bars. My changes: I used chopped dried apricots instead of chocolate, 1/4 c or more of wheat flour instead of wheat germ, cheerios instead of rice crispies, frosted mini wheat crumbs instead of corn flake crumbs, half and half almonds and pecans, added a little cococunt and sunflower seeds. Wet ingredients: omitted the peanut butter and agave, reduced the amount of sugar and honey, and added 2 eggs. I mixed it all up then combined it with the dry ingredients, and baked it at 325F for 30 minutes. Yumm. This recipe is so adaptable. And delicious :)

This was a wonderful recipe. Instead of using the crispy rice cereal and corn flakes I used what I had, Life cereal (crunched up), and Honey bunches of oats. And instead of wheat germ I used Oat Bran. It really turned out great! When you boil the honey and peanut butter mixture only let it boil for about 2 minutes. My batch got a little crunchy instead of chewy. But this is a great recipe where you can interchange some of the ingredients.

This was delicious and definitely a recipe keeper.  My son eats through granola bars like you wouldn't believe and now I can control the processed food and sugar by making them myself.  Only made minor changes because I didn't have rice cereal so I doubled the flakes.  Added sunflower seeds and used natural peanut butter.  May try to reduce the brown sugar by half next time because they are sweet for my taste but not a huge deal breaker.  Agree with the previous review to only boil for about 2 minutes.

Made it just as the recipe describes. Very tasty.  Today I am going to make another batch and substitute left over grain from beer making instead of the rolled oats and also increase the binder to make them a little more chewy.

This was a very good base recipe and easily customizable.   I made as is but next time I will omit the cinnamon.  Even though I added slightly less than called for, it was still too much for me & took away from the peanut butter & chocolate.  I will also add more binder & bake this for about 5 to 7 minutes, because it crumbled.   Thanks for submitting.

A very adaptable recipe...however, I couldn't imagine putting 1/4 flax seed into it...that would be all it would taste like! 1 Tbsp was plenty to have the flavor and crunch. Grape Nuts were good in it too.

I didn't like these at all - they had a bad aftertaste - I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth until I brushed my teeth.  Woul not make this again.

Love this recipe. Made them in greased muffin pans, and refrigerated to set. They came out as little pucks. Perfect for hiking and a good replacement for Clif bars.

Made these a couple times. Very very good! The first time made exactly and they were perfect. Another time I omitted the nuts and added craisins, really good. Another time added peanut butter chips to the chocolate pieces and toasted coconut to the oat mixture.  Excellent recipe as is, but nice one to change also.

I'm on the go all day and was looking for a granola bar that would give me quick energy. This recipe is amazing! Very simple to make, and the chocolate is a little treat. Next time I will probably add more fruit (whether that be raisins or dried cherries, etc) and use a darker chocolate (like an 85%+) to balance out the sweetness of the bar. Overall very happy!
