This cheesecake is delicious.  I only gave it 4 stars because 500 degrees for 15 minutes
made the top of the cheesecake very brown, almost burnt. I had to cover the top with foil. Next time I'll try it at 400 degrees.  Also I didn't bother with the pastry trimmings as stated in step 5, I used almost all of it in step one.This makes it much easier.

This is the best cheesecake, it is the same as the famous "Lindy's" cheesecake from New York City.

This cheesecake is very good. I had the same trouble with the top getting a bit too brown. I also found the crust a bit hard to handle. My cheesecake didn't cook through 100% but I feel that might be the fault of my oven. Overall, very tasty (though one can't eat too much at once!)

Well this was a lot of work! But it was my first homemade cheesecake, so maybe they are all like this.  It turned out very good. The crust, however, was very overcooked. Next time I am going to skip the first part of baking the crust, or cut the time in half, because the crust in the end was a dark brown and dry.  The cheesecake baked well though, and had a very light taste and texture.  Very good, but again, a lot of work.

I first saw this recipe almost 40 years ago as "Lindy's New York Style Cheesecake".  It was the first cheesecake I ever made and its still my favorite!  I always make sure I use  .fresh lemon and orange zest.  For me, a water bath and an oven thermometer are essential for  a properly cooked, crack free cheesecake.

The citrus notes are delightful-I substituted lime zest for the lemon, and the result was quite satisfactory. I definitely agree that the baking time or temp needs to be reduced, since I had to shave all the sides off since they were nicely burnt. I ended up having way too much filling; I don't know if that was a personal problem or a recipe issue. :)
