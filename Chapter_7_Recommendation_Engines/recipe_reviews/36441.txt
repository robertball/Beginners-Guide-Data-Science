Love this recipe. I was short on time so we didn't bother soking the bread. We just dipped the bread in just before frying it up. We topped the french toast with berries.

I had so much fun with this recipe. I used day old hawaiian bread that I cut in half and then into sticks (ala fast food restaurants) the night before. In the morning (midweek)I toasted SLICED almonds while I made up the egg mixture (as I am a fan of almonds but not almond extract and to go with the hawaiian bread, I substituted coconut flavoring), dipped about half of the precut bread and put in a pan in the refrigerator while I went and did my hair and makeup, came back pressed the almonds into the sticks and layed them all at the same time on my new electric family-sized griddle, cooked them about 15 mins @ 300 degrees, dusted them with powdered sugar, handed each family member an individual cup of syrup (available at my local 99 cent store) and off we all went! Delicious, fun and easy. Leftovers heated for 20 seconds in the microwave were terrific the next day, too. Next time, I'm going to try it with toasted coconut! Thanks. This one is a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I thought it was restaurant quality.  I fried the bread in butter like others on medium/low.  I had no problem with burning.  I was surprised that the almonds stuck to the bread, I thought they would fly when I turned it.  Great recipe, thanks.  I served with mixed berries.

This is much more filling than regular french toast.  I found that it was difficult to get the egg mixture to cook before the almonds started to burn.  Perhaps my stove runs too hot.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe and I am not a huge fan of almonds! I used soft french bread and followed the diretions for the most part, except that I did not fry in canola oil, but rather in butter. I think that canola oil can sometimes be tasted in food, and another comment indicated that she had detected the taste of canola oil when making this. I received numerous compliments and requests for the recipe at a brunch. This one is a keeper!!!

I found that I didn't need as many almonds as it said for pressing into the toast, but nonetheless-I won't make this only once.  Yum!!

Thank God I tried this before serving for Fathers Day.  Definately NOT worth the effort.  Almonds added a strange flavor.  Use lots of Maple syrup if you try this!  I won't be making this again.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I could not get this to cook through... I cooked it forever it seems and all I got was too done outside and a still uncooked middle.  I will not try this again.  Sorry :(

Yummy!!  Used a little bit of butter instead of canola oil and I did not brown the almonds first as they got plenty of browning while they cooked.

My kids liked this recipe.  However, make sure you don't cut your french bread slices thicker than 1", cook on medium low and cover with a lid.  Some of my bread slices had some soggy middles after cooking.  I only used a handful of almonds and let sit for 30 before cooking.

This recipes is AWESOME! Every time we go to my brother-in-laws for brunch, this is the requested thing for us to bring. There is never any left.  ai make it as is, just don't toast the almonds before cooking the french toast. I found they burned if toasted and then toasted again when cooking the toast. Thank you for sharing it!!!!

This was very filling and very tasty. I may have sliced my bread a bit to thick but other than that my husband and I both enjoyed it. My son really did not so I put four starts because chances are if we all aren't going to eat it I won't make it again.

Delicious!  The almond extract really makes the flavor of these amazing french toast.  The sliced almonds added a delightful crunch.  Be sure to cook it over low heat so that the thick slices cook completely.  I didn't make a single change to the recipe and it came out awesome.  One caution--I was surprised by how many people don't like nuts.  My sister-in-law and my niece did not care for them, so they didn't like this dish.  So next time, I'd ask people beforehand what their preference is.  But for nut lovers, this dish is too marvelous to be believed.

The almonds were an ok addition, but it definitely made frying the toast more difficult.  You really had to have the fryers on low if you want the toast to cook evenly.  I'm not sure the difference was worth the effort.

This is th best french toast i have ever eaten! I followed the recipe and the end result was an amazing melt in your mouth, close your eyes, look up to the heavens, sigh in relief, yummy french toast. I used day old challah bread and after cooking it i sprinkled confectioners sugar, cinnamon and honey. Oh happy day! (Also, i didnt have any almonds on hand so i omitted the toasted almonds and almond extract).

This dish looks beautiful, and tastes great, too! One change: Next time I will fry the toast in butter only. I could taste the oil. 

I loved the added crunch of the almonds, and the flavor created by the almond extract in the batter. My husband liked this dish best with maple syrup. I preferred powdered sugar.

We just had this very recipe served to my hubby and I at Silverstone Inn (a B&B)in Lancaster,PA. Each slice of bread was cut into 4 pieces, dunked into the liquid, and all four sides of each finger were then rolled in the chopped almonds. It was cooked to perfection - a light golden color and cooked all the way through. It was heavenly.

This was beautiful!  Upon his first bite, hubby said "This is the best french toast I've ever had!" and I have to agree with that.  I used Challah bread (Challah I from this site) and that enhanced the heavenly-ness of this dish.  It was so, so good.  I wasn't sure what the baking powder/flour was about, but I did it anyway, and it never really incorporated, but floated to the top in little clumps, so I just skimmed that off and threw it away.  I also didn't do anything ahead, or toast the almonds.  After putting the bread in the skillet to cook, I sprinkled almonds on the wet side.  I only did one side, and it was fine that way.  Just made sure I served almond-side up.  I also used sliced almonds, which worked very well.  Served with pure maple syrup.

I found my French Toast recipe, very good!  I didn't have almonds on hand so I didn't use them. And, I didn't take the time to refrigerate them. They still turned out great! Good french toast flavor.  Will definitly make again.

I made this for Valentine's Day brunch and my fiancee and I LOVED it!  It was a bit time consuming (mostly just waiting the hour for the bread to soak in the batter), but it was well worth it.  I would definitely worth it, especially for those who love Almonds.

This was not a good recipe. It had no hint of a french toast taste. It was also difficult to cook. My boyfriend liked it that's why it got 2 stars. If you do try it, I wouldn't use french bread!

I was pleased with this recipe overall but had a hard time cooking the toast all the way through without burning the almonds.  But my family enjoyed this recipe.  I think next time I will cut the toast into "sticks" so that it will cook more evenly through.

One word for this, Yum !
Ok I didn't put this in the fridge first, but that was because I had my lads all standing drooling in my kitchen, so I cooked it straight away and it came out great. This will be made again in our house.
 Thank you for the recipe.

There is not a restaurant close to my home (or anyhere that I know of)that could serve up french toast as good as this.  My family felt like we had just stepped into a quaint little cafe with Rachel Ray.  A few changes that I made to the recipe were to...omit the oil, sprinkle nutmeg in the egg mixture too, use Sara Lee (thick sliced) honey wheat bread and dip each bite into some warm maple syrup.  Also, because all I had were the whole almonds...I chopped them up in a food processor and then used a collander to shake off the almonds that just chopped down to powder.  I wondered if I had heated the almonds first and then chopped them, if they would have chopped better??? I might try that next time.

This was wonderful! I used the sliced almond accents since I did not have anything else on hand & regular sliced bread.  Next time I will use the loaf ~ thicker slices would be a nice change. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was incredibly rich, but good! I used a squirt of butter-flavored Pam instead of the oil and butter. Also, I cooked one side of the bread before adding the almonds to the other side - this way I didn't risk burning the almonds. This was great for a treat, but not something I would crave very often. Thanks!

The almonds added a nice crunch to the toast.  Next time I will press them into the bread until they are flush, so that side will brown evenly.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I've made it twice for guests and both times had the pleasure of watching their eyes light up when they tasted their first bite.

This was soo good.  I didn't have thick bread, so I had to use thin bread.  It was hard to handle, but still tasted good. I only used butter to cook the bread.

VERY tasty!!! We also didn't refrigerate, but instead placed the toast in the freezer for about 15 minutes. (Who wants to wait another hour!?!) The first time we had about 1/2 of the almonds called for, and really wouldn't like it with anymore than that.

Everyone liked this recipe, I loved it.  I did not follow the recipe with the almonds.  I just sprinkled them over the top of each serving.  I didn't have French bread and used Italian, which worked out perfectly.

I also did not soak for an hour, used half of the almonds and it turned out great.  You definitely must toast the almonds first or you'll miss out of the true flavor of this dish.
Like the previous reviewer, my flour and baking powder never fully incorporated either but I didn't bother to skim off and all was fine.
Be sure to sprinkle with powdered sugar after cooking for a decadent treat.

I used sliced almonds. After the first two pieces of toast, we left off the almonds.  They were too brown by the time the bread was cooked.  If I made this again I would not toast the sliced almonds first. Not a bad recipe but we decided we prefer our french toast without almonds.

The flavor was okay.  The almond extract was a nice change.  I also didn't soak for an hour, only about 3-4 mins per side.  I dusted with cinnamon instead of the sugar.  I will probably make some variation of this again.

Finally, I have found a french toast recipe that doesn't taste soggy!  I cooked mine on the stove in an iron skillet and that browned it nicely.  My family preferred fewer almonds for next time, and I think I might even add a little sugar to the recipe to sweeten.  I made this with sourdough french bread and it was great!

My kids loved this!  The almonds give it a nice crunch, and the flavor is really nice.  I'll have to remember to keep almonds on hand this winter, as I know my kids will be asking for this again.

Very interesting but very good! I used less oil to fry the toast in but that was the only change made. Loved this unique twist to french toast and my boyfriend and I both agree we should make this again! GREAT with fresh fruit!

I disagree with the previous review. This recipe is not at all bland. It is delicious!!! The only thing I would change would be to add a little bit of sugar. I would like to try it next time w/ a different nut, cuz I am nuts for nuts!

YUM!  I didn't have any almonds on hand, which is a bummer for me because I'm a nut for nuts, but good for my kids because they think nuts will kill them.  Next time, I will definately make sure I have some for mine!  I also didn't leave it in the fridge long enough, because we couldn't wait!  I left it in for about 20 minutes.  The bread did stick to the waxed paper, but not that bad.  My only problem was that the batter only coated about 7 slices, not 12 as the recipe states.  But that's okay.  I'll double it with no problem.  I think it was missing something, though I'm not quite sure what.  I think I'll try using a little nutmeg next time like another rating suggested.  The kids used butter and maple syrup, my husband used butter and powdered sugar, and I used margarine and apricot preserves.  The best part of it all is that my hubby loves French toast, but neither myself nor my kids care for it.  Now we can all be happy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The batter dip was really good.  I didn't care for the almonds too much since they were bland.  Perhaps adding some sugar to the toasting of the almonds would help the flavor.  Other than that, it was a good recipie.

This was very tasty, as sweet as a sweet roll in the morning. I had the egg mixture soak in the bread overnight, so it was ready in the morning. The only problem was that the bread wanted to stick to the dish, before cooking.....

We had some friends in from out of town and this was a big hit!  It was a bit sweet for me for everyone else seemed to like it.  I would use a little less oil next time.

I made a baked version of this which in my opinion is much better. Less almonds, more eggs and milk. Leave in fridge overnight then bake in the morning. Easy!

The flavour of the almond extract combined with the crunch of the sliced almonds makes this a delicious option for a special breakfast. I have made these numerous times. The step of toasting the almonds may be skipped over entirely as the nuts will brown while the french toast are face-down on the griddle.  I use MUCH MORE mixture than is called for in this recipe.  I suppose the amount required depends on the thickness of the slices + the size of the loaf.

Awesome recipe!!! The only thing I changed was throwing in a little sea salt for toasting the almonds and some cinnamon for the egg mix. Definitely going to make it again.

This recipe was just delicious, more than what I expected, just skipped the almond extract since my wife and I don't really like the taste, but it was exceptional,  thank you for the recipe.  Will make as much as I can.

Excellent Almond French Toast.  Sooo good you will want to have 4 or 5 pieces of it with fresh butter and hot Maple Syrup.

Made it (mostly) according to recipe. Browned the almonds, took a little longer than it said, used a French Brioche bread for my bread. It made 8 pieces. I ended up coming up with another idea last minute, buttered the top of the toast, added maple syrup (medium amber 100% pure, non-GMO organic) then a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream followed by caramel syrup and hot fudge and a nice scoop of Cool Whip on top. There wasn't any left and we were all stuffed at about the halfway point, just tasted too good to stop eating it! My wife loved it and our 9-year-old thought we had given him dessert for breakfast!

Used sourdough bead, but French bread would probably be better.
Make French toast first,then press in the almond slivers.

This batter can be prepped the day before. I even baked fresh loaf of bread (Bridgeford Frozen) Because I baked it the day before I lighted toasted in the oven to dry it out a bit.

We loved it! We used almond flour instead of regular flour and did not refrigerate before cooking. Still delicious and enjoyed by this mom for Mother's Day!

I didn't have slivered almonds on-hand, but even without them, the recipe was divine.  This is the best french toast recipe I've found by a long shot.

Im not fan of French Toast, this recipe piqued my interest with the shaved almonds for texture and a nutty flavor, plus the almond extract added an Amaretto flavor that made the French Toast taste like it was from a B&B.
I cut up organic strawberries, black cherries and bananas that I layered in between two pieces and on top.
I doubled the almond extract and added a liberal amount of cinnamon.
