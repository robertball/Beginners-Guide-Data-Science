I added 1/4 tsp of salt like one review said.  I didn't peel the peaches and the whole things was great.  This isn't a very sweet dessert and that I what my husband and I loved about it.  However, my husband wishes there was more topping so maybe I will make a double topping next time.

I made this just as recipe states.  My husband said it was the most fresh fruit dessert he had ever had -- not too sweet or too far away from the real peach flavor.

not great recipe.  Needs a bit of salt. Something else is missing but can't figure out what.

Ok I made a lot of substitutions on this because I didnt have enough fresh peaches and we tend to like sweeter desserts...even if i had had all the peaches i still think i would have done it this way...it is very yummy and rich...also, though i think these additions would benefit the recipe regardless if you used fresh frozen or canned peaches which makes this a more universal quick put together..i appreciated how easy it was.

...here are the changes I made:  FILLING I mixed a can of peach pie filling with some real peaches, increased the amount of brown sugar by 1/8 c, added 1/2 t. salt, used 1 t. vanilla extract and 1 t. maple extract in lieu of almon extract, a full teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. ginger and 1/4 t. allspice.

for the Topping i increased the oats to 3/4 c and the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  I also used more like a half cup of sliced almonds on the top.  everything else i kept the same. we served with ice cream.

this was very yummy! :)
Thanks for the recipe! :)

try to use sugar cane melt to became caramel and forget brown sugar! too bitter and strong flavoured when heated! a bit of salt is a very good idea!

My family loved this - but I think the 1tsp of almond extract is too much.  Next time I would use 1/2.  I also substituted Splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar.  Really easy to prepare, and quick too!

The topping was good and I liked the addition of the almonds. But the cornstarch was too much and made the peaches have a pasty instead of juicy texture. And 30 minutes was too long to bake this. The topping got a little too crunchy and the peaches were too overcooked. I'll use the topping part of this again but not follow the instructions for the peaches.
