A great recipe, but even better with some additions. I followed the other reviewers' advice, and used lemon extract instead of the vanilla. Then, I tinted the icing with yellow food coloring, and I also added vanilla and lemon extract (1/4 tsp each) to it. I drizzled the icing over the tops of the cookies and then sprinkled confectioner's sugar on top of the icing to pretty them up a bit. The result was a tasty cookie that was easy on the eye, and even more pleasing to the tummy! Will definitely try these again!

A variation of this recipe recently won top prize at a cookie exchange I attended.  Fantastic cookies.  The variation I have uses cream cheese frosting -  4 oz cream cheese, 1 Tbl butter, 2 C 10X sugar, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  It really adds to the wonderful flavor.

I made these cookies for Easter with a few changes and they were fabulous!  I added a tablespoon of grated lemon peel to the dough and used half lemon juice instead of milk for the icing.  I tinted the icing yellow with food coloring and topped with pastel colored sprinkes.  They were delicious and beautiful!!!

These cookies are great...wonderfully light and airy!  I played around with some extracts, doing one dozen with lemon extract (topping with a lemon glaze and grated lemon zest), one dozen with maple extract (topping with a maple flavored cream cheese frosting and chopped walnuts), and another dozen with coconut extract (topping with a coconut infused vanilla frosting and fresh shredded coconut).  They were all wonderful, but the coconut was my favorite!  The flavor of these by themselves leaves so much possibility as far as flavorings go, which makes them perfect for me, even though others have mentioned thinking they "lacked something".  A little imagination can turn a good cookie into a GREAT cookie and I think these have the potential for that!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)

These cookies were good, and very easy. I made them a little less bland by making a simple glaze with almond extract, milk and confectioners sugar. They freeze well.

These are cake-like cookies, not your standard cookie texture and density, so don't expect the same consistency as a chocolate chip cookie. Also, the batter was very thick and my 100 watt hand mixer did not have enough power to handle the dough. I tried to make these a little lower in fat, so I reduce the amount of butter. That was a mistake. The cookies were too crumbly -- the butter is needed for moistness.  These cookies have a mild flavor and do not taste very sweet without the icing. I mixed 3 T. of fresh orange juice with 3 c. of powdered sugar to make the icing.  The citrus of the OJ was a nice complement to the cookie.  I think almond or maple extract would also be good in the icing. After I get a new and better mixer, I'm going to try these again.

Good. Just a very plain soft and cakey vanilla cookie. I followed recipe exactly, but didn't make the icing. The cookies are plenty sweet without it. They do not spread at all, so can be put close together on cookie sheet. Mine only needed 12 minutes in the oven.

These are a great base cookie. I prefer to add the zest of one lemon and replace one of the teaspoons of vanilla with lemon extract. I then frost them with a light lemon flavored cream cheese frosting made with 4 oz cream cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, some lemon juice (or extract), 1.5 cups of powdered sugar, and a few drops yellow food coloring. They taste so nice and springy this way. Great for easter. They are more like Italian lemon teacakes this way. I can imagine that almond extract would also be good in these with a cherry flavored frosting (though would unboubtably be much sweeter). The texture is incredible, and, as with a lot of Italian recipes, it's not all about the flavor, but the texture that makes something irresistable.

These are probably the BEST drop cookies I've ever made!  The family devoured them!  They are so soft and moist!!!  I would give this a ten if I could :)  They would even be good with a little lemon flavor somewhere...I might try that in the frosting next time!

Great recipe! Made cookies last minute for my daughter's Ricotta report she did in Italian class. Very moist and a big hit with students and the teacher.
Grazie!

I made these exactly as written. I'm very impressed by the taste and texture of these cookies! They remind me of a sweet scone or fluffy shortbread. I made them huge and then froze them in order to use them for a strawberry shortcake dessert later. The only thing I will do differently is let them brown a bit more. Thanks!

A similar recipe has been in my family for years that is a better version of this. And the secret to the icing is 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 TBL milk and 2 cups sifted powdered sugar.  The icing is the perfect texture and sets up perfectly.  --  We also do not add vanilla to the cookie!  They are a hit and every event.  You will give 5 start if you do this!!!

I had never made these before but they came out perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, only added about 1/2 tsp more vanilla just because I was afraid they would be too blah without it.  I will use this recipe over and over again!  Also, the glaze only lasted for half the batch so I just left the other half plain.  Either way they are delicious!

These are really good, as another reviewer said, they're not like a chocolate chip cookie or anything, but they are good.  I followed the recipe exactly except when it came to the icing.  I substituted some of the milk for 2 TBSP of vanilla extract and 1 TBSP of maple syrup.  The icing, I believe is what really set these cookies off, they had just enough of a maple flavor to bring out the best in the cookies.  My husband took these to work, and a buddy of his said that they tasted just like some cookies that he'd gotten from the Amish bakers in Ohio.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I ran into a friend who said she got a recipe from her Italian sister-in-law for Ricotta Cheese cookies.  Sounded interesting so I came home and checked All Recipes for a recipe, found it and baked them.  Delicious!  Then my friend brought some of her cookies over from her sister-in-law's recipe.  Tasted the same.  They were awesome.  My son loved them and he's not a cookie eater.

Very nice cookies, I used a teaspoon cookie scoop to get uniform sized cookies.  This made approx 70 cookies! They need to bake for exactly 15 minutes.

I loved these! The first time, I cut the recipe in half but accidentally put in the whole cup of butter... but they were great! And I made a half recipe again with the right amount of butter and they weren't as good as the first time! I'll make them again.

Great use for leftover ricotta.  Definitely use lemon or almond flavoring with or instead of vanilla.  Very moist cookie--not too sweet.

I have been making cookies for over 50 years, and never have been so disappointed. I totally agree with "Arianne". If you are looking for a recipe what tastes like BISCUITS, then this is IT! Exactly as written, it is bland. Without all the additions made by others,the cookies are tasteless. (Sigh!)

Absolutely delicious! Added anise extract to the icing and used pastel colored nonpereil sprinkles....Such a moist cake-like cookie....I remember these growing up....they bring back a lot of memories. The ricotta really makes these cookies moist. My family loves these cookies and they made great Easter gifts for them.  This recipe makes a lot of cookies....but so worth it. The best! Thanks for a great recipe.

I really liked these cookies!  They are light and have just the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't have quite enough ricotta cheese so I added a few tablespoons of cottage cheese (drained).  I also took one reviewer's suggestion and used half lemon juice, half milk in the icing.  Yum!

These are so delicious, soft, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. We have a Christmas cookie exchange party every year and everyone brings all these fancy cookies, but these cookies are everyones the most favored and out do the fancy cookies. You can add a little food coloring to the dough or frosting and make these really cute. Sometimes I add a whole pecan on the top of the frosting, very designer like!

I really liked these! They weren't sweet enough for the rest of the family. I used a cream cheese frosting & made colored sugar to sprinkle on. Thanks, I'll be making these at Christmas!

Made the recipe as provided, no tweaks.  The taste was very good, but it does need glaze.  Nice cake like texture, however, they did not store well at all.  I stored them in an air tight container and the next day they were very, very mushy.

these cookies were amazing, but i tweaked them a bit! i cut the butter in half and substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce (will use all apple sauce next time) and used egg whites instead of eggs.  these cookies were so delicious and fluffy - will definately make again!

These cookies are WONDERFUL!!  We have dairy goats and make our own ricotta cheese, so I was looking for a way to use up the excess.  I did make some modifications though.  I used 1/2 oat and 1/2 spelt flour, added 1/2 tsp. of lemon peel and 2 tsp. lemon extract.  I used lemon juice and p. sugar for the icing.  Everyone loved these cookies!  No grainy texture, no blandness, no complaints at all.  :)

t was my first time making ricotta cookies, and wow - they were a huge hit! This recipe is really easy, and it makes a lot of cookies. And be forewarned - the Italian in-laws might just snatch up the leftover cookies after dinner and give your Tupperware container back completely empty!

I have been making these cookies for awhile and they are the best cookies ever.  Everyone always asks me to make these for them.  The only thing different is I use 2 1/2 cups conf. sug. and 5 tbsp milk.  Also for the holidays you can sprinkle green and red sugar crystals on them.  You won't be disappointed with these.

Very tasty cookie - light and fluffy, not too sweet. I made three frosting variations: almond extract, lemon extract and coconut extract, and sprinkled sliced almonds, lemon zest and coconut on top, respectively. Yum!

Had some Ricotta left after making Lasagne and wanted to use it, found this recipe, super easy..the cookies are great, not too sweet. I made the frosting with the juice of Calamansi fruit and some lime zest...so delicious on the hot days here in Hawaii. I will make theses again, a great cookie to go with afternoon tea.

I only had enough ricotta to make half the recipe.  Decided to make a "bar cookie" out of it instead of drop cookies.  Placed the dough in a ~6x10 baking dish and baked for about 30-35min.  When cooled, I topped with the powdered sugar mixture, which included some almond extract.  Very good.  Was more of a dense cake consistancy than a bar cookie, but it got good reviews from friends and family.

I'm a little disappointed with these cookies. While they were pretty easy to make, had a nice texture and looked great, the flavor was not what I wanted. Followed the recipe to a T, but even with the glaze they had this bland sort of flavor that I can't quite put my finger on (almost like a scone or biscuit, maybe too much baking powder... not sure). And, yes, I know that Ricotta Cookies are generally not a rich, super sweet cookie. This recipe is OK, but not what I wanted.

I just made these for St. Pat's Day - and instead of using vanilla I used Almond Extract - WOW - they were terrific.   I also put a little dropof Almond Extract in the frosting too and sprinkled with green sugar crystals....  Also to cut down on the sugar (for my weight/diabetic friend I used the Splenda sugar blend)...  I would make them again and again.....

These were quick to mix up. I used a cookie scoop which made things easy too.  They didn't spread much, so were rather rounded. When the cookies were ready for tasting, I loved the fact that the outside was crisp and the inside cake-like. I added a tsp of cinnamon to the batter. I iced half of them since hubby likes 'em less sweet.  I substituted 1tbsp almond extract for the milk. Yum!

Tried this recipe to use up some extra ricotta cheese...NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...didn't have that much taste, and i ended up with 5 dozens! They tasted more like biscuits and we ate them with butter! won't be making them again.

I was looking for a way to use up some leftover ricotta cheese when I came across this recipe.  I halved the recipe since I only had half a tub of the cheese, and was very pleased with my use of the leftover ricotta.

Yummy cookie! I made everything as the recipe reads, except I did a glaze. I made half with orange and half with almond extra. Thank you for sharing! This is a keeper!

These are wonderful!  I added some extra vanilla extract but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The batter had a great texture and was easy to work with.  Very cake-y texture and a great base for additional flavors.  I iced some with confectioners sugar with lemon extract and added sprinkles and I iced others with confectioners sugar mixed with amaretto and a dash of almond extract and sprinkled with chopped almonds.  Both were big hits and I've had quite a few requests for the recipe.  Thank you very much for sending in this recipe!

I made this recipe one day after reminiscing about the tasty ricotta cookies I used devour while living in Italy. 
What resulted from this recipe didn't taste much like the cookies I wanted to make.  First of all, it was a bit too soft and crumbly.  And for some reason tasted like corn muffin.  I didn't make the glaze, as I try to be calorie conscious, but w/o a glaze, it doesn't have much flavor.

I have made these cookies several times and everyone always loves them.  The first time I made according to the recipe.  Since then I have added mini cholocate chips and also walnuts on occasion.  They turn out good no matter how I make them.

I've had this recipe for a while and finally made it last night with some left over ricotta.  I reduced the batch to make "12 servings" and my roommate and I finished them all before bed.  

I used a little less butter than called for, and I just dusted them with powdered sugar.  They were not too sweet, and very moist and cakey.

Probably unique to my stove... but next time I'll cook them at 325 for 12-15min for a more even bake.

I made these cookies last year at the advice of a friend.  She never got to taste them because she moved prior to making them.  However, my family loves them and they are now a constant for Christmas.  I covered some with sugar sprinkles, I put a walnut on top of some and I drizzled chocolate on others. This makes a large batch (which I love) and I give as gifts too.

My family loved it. I made four dozen cookies AND there were three cookies left this morning. I think it was a hit. Only change I made was put one chocolate morsel on the cookies and skipped the icing and sprinkles.

These cookies are so easy to make - I have made them dozens of times - They are the closest to the way my grandmother made them years and years ago.   Delicious ----I used different colored sprinkles for all occasions......  The picture here is not really accurate if you go by the recipe.

Unfortunately, my batch was a little short on the Ricotta cheese and my oven runs hot for the bottoms to be a little browner than likely intended, but I didn't let them burn.

For future reference, I would likely double the amount of the icing from the recipe given as I ran short on that while decorating. However, it was tasty for my whole household and I was nibbling on those cookies for days. 

A teacher in grade school brought cookies like these to class one year and, wouldn't you know it, gave me the recipe when I was a kid and would no doubt lose it before I could really implement it. Not sure it lived up to my memories, but it could easily be a case of rose-tinted glasses. It was an interesting recipe and I was rather happy with the result and, having tried it once, I can tweak it here and there (like buying more ricotta) in the future.

I made these cookies with exact ingredients except I made a frosting with almond extract. They were very cake like and flavorless. They had an odd aftertaste. I think there is too much baking powder. I think they would have been better with much less baking powder.

I made these but I changed the amount of baking powder to two teaspoons instead of two tablespoons.  It sounded like way too much.  I’ve nevee seen that amount in any cookie recipe.  They turned out great with 2 teaspoons.

Having made these before (lost my original recipe); I remember one of the important steps to this recipe is to fold the ricotta in last so that you don't work it.

I then topped with a great cream cheese frosting!

I dip half the cookie in white or choc almond bark.  I use half vanilla and half almond extract. I have also used orange and almond extract together as well as adding lemon rind in the dough and almond extact along with royal icing with disorrano in it.

These were ok...a little bland, but a good way to use up ricotta, and after glazing and decorating they were very pretty. Note that they don't spread do you can put them closer together on the pan, and they don't smooth out so after my first two pans I shaped them a bit, otherwise they were too craggy. Note too that the glaze dries quickly so if you're going to sprinkle something on them don't wait.

Light cookies. Added lemon zest.  Used small spoon, baked for 13 min. Not too sweet as well. Kept this recipe in my box.

These remind me of Mrs. Rannali's ricotta cookies...a neighbor from my childhood.  I have made these twice.  The second time I added the zest of one lemon and 1 T. of lemon juice.  Very very good.  Thank you for sharing Lindak.

Cut the recipe in half and still made almost 4 dozen cookies!  For the icing, we mixed Key Lime juice with the confectioner’s sugar and decorated with lime-colored sprinkles to get a taste of “Key West”.

I had made lasagna and had 7 oz of ricotta cheese left. So I substituted 8 oz sour cream. My grandkid's loved them. The recipe makes a large batch, so froze about half (unfrosted). When we needed more, I took the plain cookies out of the freezer and put the glaze on top. To top them I used glaze, powered sugar and sprinkles. The dough is a bit sticky, so next time I will try a cookie scoop with a trigger release. If you want a very smooth, melt in your mouth cookie, then this is your cookie.

Every time I do stuffed shells or lasagna I always use this recipe to use up the extra ricotta cheese. I don’t ice them as they are the perfect addition to a coffee just as they are. I yield 280 per batch.

A very good cakey cookie. They did spread out a bit, so the cookies were big but did still had a nice dome top. I think next time I will make them a bit smaller. My bake time was a few mins. longer then stated.

No changes to the recipe, except that I made half the amount, turned the icing pink using maraschino cherry juice, and topped each cookie with a cherry half.  So delicious and soft!  Easy to make.  This will be one of my trademark recipes in my social circle!

I thought they were ok but my daughter loved them.  I would use almond extract if I make them again.  My sister told me they should also kbe kept in the freezer because they get funky if left out.

These are wonderful cookies.  They are light, fluffy and melt in you mouth wonderful. 

I made sure that I whipped the heck out of the butter and sugar in the first step (until it looked like whipped butter, about 5 minutes using a stand mixer) , this is very important for a successful cookie.  

The other adjustment I made was to add about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of butter, 1/2 Tsp of vanilla.  I happened to have on hand some Wilton icing white as well.  Took advice from another review and dusted with powder sugar, and clear/silver sprinkles to finish.  They look a wonderful as they taste.

I love these cookies and they are always a hit. Ricotta keeps them moist. I top some with colored icing and roll in coconut. Others I use colored sugars or sprinkles. Makes them look very festive. Definitely will make them again and again

I had some left over Ricotta cheese that I didn't want to throw out. I followed the recipe as written and the cookies were delicious. They almost seemed part cookie, part biscuit, part cake. It was light and fluffy with crisp edges and a soft middle.

this recipe is amazing, easy to follow and ended up with enough batter for 56 cookies. Pretty good considering it said 36, so I got a bonus 20 cookies. These were a major hit at the office. 
I added a little bit less vanilla, and added some anise extract as well to make them sort of like anisette cookies. Turned out very well and I will definitely be making these again soon

I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to use our ricotta cheese before we went on vacation. We love, love these cookies! I do use real lemon flavoring in them instead of vanilla and grate the rind of at least one lemon for the cookies and then sprinkle more lemon grated lemon rind on the top of the frosting. I have been making them for about three years and they are a favorite of our grandchildren.

I made these cookies and thought they were very good.  I had a 15 oz. ricotta and was glad to find a recipe to use it especially cookies.   I used  lemons for the flavoring and also for the icing with bits of lemon in the icing....try to make the icing smooth and get out the lumps before spreading on the cookies.  Would definitely make these again.

I don't make cookies often...but when I do, I go to All Recipes! These Ricotta cookies were so easy to make, but they weren't as tasty as I had hoped. I added some orange juice to the icing; that gave it a little kick! I didn't have candy sprinkles; blue colored sugar worked good. I'll make these again next time I've got leftover Ricotta cheese.?? I may ad some chopped pecans for taste and texture.

Mmm... These are fluffy and beautiful. A touch of lemon juice to the icing adds the perfect touch. These are some beautiful cookies. Follow the recipe carefully, though, because they puff up a ton when baking.

I love these cookies! The only change I made (and its only because i was being lazy) is I topped with powdered sugar instead of the glaze. I also think these cookies would be good in a lemon version or glaze.

Simple and delicious! I'm usually a needs nuts, cookie eater, but these are so delicious I didn't even miss them! I did split the batch in half and added chocolate chips to the second half, thinking of a cannoli, and they were just a good. I found the icing recipe to be the perfect amount. Thank you for this recipe!

I made these with my husband in mind, and also to use up some ricotta I had from a previous meal. I took other reviews and tweaked it a bit by using lemon extract instead of vanilla, and using half lemon juice and half milk for the icing. Also, I didn't have parchment paper so I used a cookie sheet lined with lightly buttered foil instead. The bottoms browned nicely and there were no adverse effects from not using the parchment paper. Will definitely make this again; thanks for posting!

I really enjoyed how easy this cookie was to make, and sooo much of it. I had to share with my family and neighbors.  I did add some cinnamon to the batter and used a cream cheese icing. They were like little cakes. very yummy. Next time I will add some lemon zest to the dough and orange juice to the icing, this will be great for a summer brunch. My cookies stayed soft like cake for 7 days afterwards!!

Really, really, good.  I tweeked it by using half all purpose and half oat flour.  I didn't frost it, I added mini chocolate chips to the dough.  They are a perfect not too sweet cookie.

These are DELICIOUS!
I just took these out of the oven; when I made them, split up half my batch to bake as plain and added chopped walnuts and a sprinkling of cinnamon to the other half. Both are delicious. The plain ones have a great texture but not much flavor on their own; however, I'm leaving them that way on purpose so I can experiment with different toppings (pumpkin butter, peanut butter, black raspberry jam) - they taste really good with a dab of black raspberry jam on them.

I'm proud to say that I made these using all-healthy ingredients: 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup honey instead of 1 cup sugar (my measurements were based on half of the given recipe) and they still turned out fine! Thanks for the recipe- will be making these again soon.

These are such wonderful cookies. I'm not even a fan of ricotta cheese, but my family and I love these. There incredibily soft, and melt in your mouth. I dont frost these because the taste of the cookie is to good.

These cookies were so good! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used a smaller yield). For the frosting, I added a small amount of cool whip and it was great! I also used some leftover strawberry glaze mixed in to make strawberry icing. Excellent!

These cookies turned out to be better than i would have imagined it to be. Very soft. I used vanilla extract but only because i didn't have almond extract. I found it to have almost like a bread like texture. Not too sweet, but that's what makes it unique. Sprinkled some white sugar on top of the cookies before popping them in the oven. Watch the time.

These cookies were good if you have leftover ricotta cheese.  They are cakelike and you can add many different extracts like banana, lemon, orange or even probably cocoa if you desired.  And for the frosting you could make a glaze with powdered sugar or even use frosting in the container. I would definately make them again if I had leftover ricotta cheese.

To LindaK. I want to thank you for sending me your Italian Ricotta Cheese Cookie recipe. I made these for a wedding that I went to and they went over great. Only one thing, mine stayed small and puffed,the ones I had previously were larger and flatter. Is this the way this recipe gets. Thanks Jeanette S.
