This was pretty flavorless. Needs some serious modifications. I added some fresh ginger, more soy sauce, oyster sauce, and some peanut butter. Also used frozen zucchini noodles which did not reheat well. When all was said and done it looked really unappetizing but tasted ok. Not sure I would make again.

This was fast and fun but there was something lacking in flavor for us. If you are a sesame oil kind of person I recommend using it instead of the coconut oil and that will bump the flavor up a notch.
