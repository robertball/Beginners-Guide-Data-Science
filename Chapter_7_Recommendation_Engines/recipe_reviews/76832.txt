You have to use smuckers natural peanut butter in these bars.  For those who said that they were too sweet, or didn't have enough liquid probably didn't use the right peanut butter.  I have tried using store brands with this recipe and they never turn out the same.  I always use rice crispys and the smuckers natural and they are perfect!

Yummy! My son couldn't get enough!! Used half the sugar recommended (3-3/4 cups is FAR too much for anyone-no wonder some said it was too sweet!) and regular Kraft peanut butter (nuked for 30 seconds so its easier to mix) and turned out very well.  Great way to use up those large boxes of cereal after the kids decide they have a new favorite!

Delicious.  I've made these several times and everyone loves them.  This recipe makes more like 60-80 bars, because they are far to rich to be bars, you should really cut them into bite sized pieces.

Delish!  The kids loved these.  Please not that the recipe calls for ALL NATURAL PEANUT BUTTER, i.e. UNSWEETENED peanut butter.  That is why all the sugar is called for.  If you are going to make these with regular peanut butter...well, just don't, because the powdered sugar makes the whole thing thicker, so if you leave some out you will change up the consistency.  Just pick up a jar of the natural peanut butter, and you will be fine. :)

These were yummy!  I made them to share with the whole gang for an annual camping trip with other families. They were gone within the first couple of hours and everyone was fighting for the last ones.  So now I have to bring them every year!  And they're so easy!  I didn't use natural peanut butter, and I used milk chocolate chips instead, since I had a whole bunch of those.  Very fun recipe!

This was a very sweet recipe. Next time I will either use less or no COrn Flakes. It was way to much. Overall it was very easy to make.

YUM!  I took these to work and they disappeared! :)  There's no way I'll make them again and leave them home, we'd eat WAY too many!

my son and husband loved them. i thought they were pretty good, except that the cereal used (corn flakes) was still crunchy in them? next time will try a puffed rice instead. i did use a natural peanut butter but not smuckers.

Rich and delicious and the corn flakes added a nice crunch. You could also make these into a ball-form (just add a little parafin to the chocolate). YUM!

Delicious!  Basically the same recipe except in bar form as my peanut butter balls I make at Christmas time.  A lot less fussy than the balls are to make.  I made a half batch and put in a 8x8 in dish.  If you are using processed peanut butter (like Jif) reduce the sugar buy at least a half cup.  I was running low on chocolate so I added some butterscotch chips in too and just did a thin coating of topping.  Wonderful!

This recipe is odd - the corn flakes make the texture a little different.  I agree with previous reviews - 1/2 cup of butter is not enough liquid.  I halved this recipe and still used almost 1/2 a cup which is quite a bit of butter.  These are very sweet but they aren't bad.  I don't think I will make this again.

This is a great recipe--although I roll small bits of the peanut butter dough into balls, dunk them in the melted chocolate and let the balls set up on a cookie sheet lined with parchment. More time consuming, but they are so rich they can only be taken in small bites.

easy to make, but unbearably sweet. Kids seem to like them, but only in a small portion.

I just made these and there is no way that 1/2 cup of butter is enough liquid! I haven't tasted them yet but I won't make them again. I think that the recipe is wrong or written wrong.
