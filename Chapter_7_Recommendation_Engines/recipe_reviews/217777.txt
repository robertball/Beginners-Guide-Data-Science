This was okay but not as amazing as I ad hoped.  I eliminated the nuts (children and allergies), and I changed it to 375 degrees for 35-40 minutes like my other kugels and it baked perfectly.

We had Seder at our house tonight where I served this kugel. I didn't change one item in the recipe. There were 15 of us in all with the majority of the guests being NOT Jewish but the kugel was a HUGE hit with EVERYONE!  :-)  Definitely going to make this again.

I have made this following the recipe exactly, and it's very good! I've also subbed cherry preserves for the shredded apple, which is great!! Serve with whole milk yogurt for a tasty Passover breakfast.
