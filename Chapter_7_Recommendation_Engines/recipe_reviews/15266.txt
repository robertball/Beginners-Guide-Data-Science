Great for a quick and easy lunch - I love swiss cheese and instead of sour cream, I used a little lite mayo mixed with a bit of dijon mustard. This was so good with some chips and a dill pickle on the side!

I bought a whole load of various deli meats the other day and decided to make this for lunch yesterday.  HOWEVER - I didn't have deli chicken SOOO I grilled some chicken breasts (first pounded flat) and then I carefully sliced the breast into 2 halves. Used a couple slices of ham and instead of the sour cream - I used Miracle Whip.  Finally, since I was making a batch for my family - I "grilled" the whole batch of sandwiches under the broiler on a cookie sheet - a minute per side (be careful b/c they will brown quickly). This allowed for 6 sandwiches to be done at one time AND my sandwiches were nice and thick - like a cordon bleu sandwich should be. The miracle whip gave it a nice zip. Thanks for the nice/quick lunch recipe Deirdee.

This was a superb sandwhich!  Delicious, filling, and something a little different.  I used LF cheese and butter and Light mayo instead of sour cream.  Also, my grocer didn't have pre-cooked chicken, so I took a 1/4 of a fresh boneless chicken breast and cooked it before making the sandwhich.  YUMMY!

Yummy!  I was looking for an easy lunch recipe to feed my husband and these were great.  I used small French bread rolls and simply heated in the oven.  These will be a do again for sure in our house.

These were pretty good.  A nice change from regular grilled cheese, but not a very good sub for real chicken Cordon bleu.

Yummy! Use only a light smear of sour cream and maybe next time I will only use one slice of cheese per sandwich.

There has to be about 800 calories in this sandwich!  No wonder it tastes so good!  Yum!  This will be a new favorite at our house to replace those boring grilled cheese sandwiches.

This is one of those infinitely variable recipes that easily lends itself to just about any taste.  I added some peeled and seeded jalapeno peppers cut into extremely thin slivers.  Also, substituting mayo mixed with a little Dijon mustard works very well in place of the sour cream.  Aged cheddar (or any good melting cheese) works well in place of the Swiss cheese.    Crumbled cooked bacon is also a nice addition.

Very tasty. Added some thinly sliced red onion in the middle to give it a kick. Also, mixed the sour cream with a tablespoon of Ken's honey mustard. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy, fast, and very good.  I prefer my food super-hot, but leaving the sandwich in the skillet too long will burn it.  So, I browned it, melted the cheese lightly and popped it in the mirco to finish the heating job.  Perfect.  I used sourdough bread, and full chicken breasts--pounded down.  Thanks for the idea!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  Perfect on a hot summer day when you don't want to turn the oven on.  I did use mayo in place of sour cream, as I'm not a huge fan of sour cream.

nothing special, but edible.
I didn't particularly care for these, but my boyfriend ate them (his attitude towards it was "grilled cheese with meat, can't go wrong there") Not so much remnicient of the recipe's namesake.
Still, very quick and easy to prepare, might make them again for a lunch rush.

I didn't care for this. The sourcream overpowered the sandwhich. This did not remind me of chicken cordon blue. I think I will pass on making this again.

Nice twist on a meal that otherwise takes a long time to prepare. Very easy and quick to make. I used Carving Board prepackaged deli chicken. Also made a side of broccoli soup and was full beyond belief after I was done with dinner.

I LOVED this sandwich! I used sliced italian bread in place of the whole wheat because that's all I had. Also, I didn't have any sour cream, so I subbed whipped cream cheese. The flavors were wonderful and I know I will be making this again~YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used a grilled chicken breast cut in half lengthwise, sour cream/miracle whip combo, provolone cheese, and ham. My husband said it reminded him of a Cuban sandwich (he's Cuban). I thought it was very good and will most likely make again and again! Very filling!

I made a few changes that made this sandwich really filling. I used grilled chicken breast instead of sliced from the deli.  I also used sour dough bread. The sandwich recieved raves from the whole family.  I did take one reviews advice to spread the sour cream thin...I would spread it thicker next time.

Husband thought this was pretty tasty but I thought it was only so so and cannot see making this ever again. I thought the swiss cheese really overpowered the other flavors and you couldn't taste anything else other than the cheese and the sour cream. The addition of the later is still baffling to me. Maybe if you reduced the swiss cheese amount or added more ham and chicken breast to balance out everything.

This is a special tasting sandwich.  I enjoyed it as a change of pace from the usual fried cheese.  Next time I will use mayonaise on the outside instead of butter as that is the way I do fried cheese sammies now.

I LOVED this sandwich. It has probably taken over as one of our favorite grilled sandwiches. My husband does have a picky palate and he ate up two of these the night I made them. They are very filling too!

Instead of using butter, I use butter spray in the can. You get better coverage on the bread, plus you use less butter so the sandwich isn't greasy. I also substitute  with low fat cheese and meat. I don't care for sour cream so I subsitute with fat free Miracle Whip or Mayo.

Yummy and easy.  The only reasons it is three stars instead of five is the sour cream wasn't a hit and it is loaded with unkind calories.

Made this for lunch today using 12-grain bread and Miracle Whip instead of sour cream. Served with a green salad.   Would be great for a quick weekday dinner with soup.  Thanks for posting, Deirdre Dee.

I'm not a hot sandwich person but my husband is and we BOTH loved this sandwich. We ahd this w/potato soup 1 week and Onion soup the next. It's tasy and filling. We were only able to eat 1 sandwich a piece my husband usually needs another to quench his hunger. 
My husband also woke me up at 3:00 am to make him another for work that day. I was more than willing to do that being that he's NEVER asked that before. So I give this 2 thumbs way up.
Older kids can make tis w/supervision just because of the use of the stove.
Mangia everyone!

Great idea. I used sliced french bread and they were great. It was a hit for the whole family. My daughter asked me to cook and extra for her to take in her lunch to work. We use Dijon Mustard instead of sour cream. Excellent!!

I rated it according to the ease with which the mentally retarted consumers in my care could make this receipe independently.

My daughter just drove off as I was logging on to my computer. I wanted to view this site last night but was too busy. I logged on and thought how fun.
I can really enjoy using this recipe box I have a billion saved. Then my daughter came back. Could I please fix supper for all of us she wasn't feeling well.
I decided to try the chicken recipe I was just looking at. I added a salad and crackers and it was wonderful. We loved it and it was ready so fast. My grandson thought
it was just great and we made plans to serve this again at a church picnic in June. It was so good.

The Grilled Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwiches were excellent.  
They were quick and easy to make.
Also my 5 year old son loved them.

I used this as a springboard and we had some really good grilled sandwiches.  Mixed sour cream and mayo half and half and spread very lightly on Italian bread.  Layered swiss, ham, chicken (deli slices), ham and provolone.  Grilled them toasty brown in unsalted butter and placed tomato slices in the middle right before serving.  Really good.  Thank you for the original.

Just ok. The bread was well toasted, however the meats inside were still cold - luke warm.  It was a good change of pace, but will not be making again.

Pretty good. Used cream cheese instead of sour cream and was good, but maybe needs more sauce since it was a little dry.

This is good as well as a quick lunch to take to the office. I like to substitute French dressing for the cheese.
