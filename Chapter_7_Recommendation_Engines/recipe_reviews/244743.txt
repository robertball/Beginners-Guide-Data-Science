I was so tired of ordering Parmesan garlic wings and ending up with chicken soaked in oily garlic.  So I searched and searched for a creamy sauce like I had years ago and boy am I happy I came across this one!  It was amazing!  My whole family loves it and I don't believe I'll ever order out again!  My husband wants it on pasta and the kids want pizza with the sauce.   It was perfect!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Doubled recipe to insure enough to coat 4-5 lbs of fried wing sections, which was the perfect amount.    I have been looking for a good garlic parmesan sauce for wings for a long time and this is it.      Although I have made many recipes from this site, this is the first time I have rated a recipe...they were fantastic!  Thank you for sharing.
