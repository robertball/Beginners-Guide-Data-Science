What a bunch of negative whiners.  Reviews are to be written by those who made and tasted this dish, not by those who simply want to bash the ingredients.  I made this based on the "quick and easy" in the title.  And I'm here to attest that it was quite tasty.  Don't like the ingredients?  Don't make it.  Worried about the sodium?  Don't make it.  Looks like a whole lot of people posting here woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  Do you have nothing better to do?  Sheesh!

All the haters gonna dis on this but I've had this dish in Mexico, it's delicious! You can add all kinds of stuff black olives, mushrooms, sauteed bell peppers, onions. A added bonus is my 8 year old can make this by himself.

Very easy and tastes great, any additions you like makes it work even better.
I know some people thinks its to much prepared foods and not home made, but I'm 67 years old and I like to cook for wife at times and I shy away from the recipes with 15 to 20 ingredients.
This is quick and easy and she loved it, I'm still her hero!

So after reading all the reviews, both positive and negative, I thought I would try it and judge it for myself. I love cooking and don't mind complicated recipes,  but the simplicity of this one was attractive for those nights when I don't have a lot of time.    It was so easy to make, and I did not change a thing.    It was very good.  Don't get me wrong, I have had better enchiladas but the ease and simplicity of the recipe and the fact that my 4 boys loved it merits the 4 stars.  I did not think there would be enough sauce to cover the Taquitos but it was fine. Also, I tried to find the largest Taquitos and all I could find were about 1" diameter. But it turned out great!  Check it after 25 minutes - my cheese started to brown at about that time, and I like my cheese gooey not crunchy. Adios, amigos!

I have made this recipe a few times. It is a great dish for the rush dinner nights. I did find that if you prepare it in advance and refrigerate it for a bit, that the taquitos are softer and easier to eat. This dish can be layered too! I put a layer of taquitos, pour half the sauce, spread refried beans over the top, add the cheese, another layer of taquitos,  sauce and cheese. It's really good with an egg on top. I make my own enchilada sauce when time permits. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was soooo easy to make!  Perfect for times when you just don't feel like making a big production in the kitchen. I only changed one thing....instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken soup.  My son won't do the mushroom thing so I had to change things up a bit.  We love black olives so I put them on top with a little chopped green onions!  This was awesome.  Thanks soooo much for this recipe....I would never have thought of using the frozen ones...so much easier!

I enjoyed it. I left out the mushroom soup and just went for the enchilada sauce, Quick and easy with items I usually have in my cupboard and freezer. I added some parmesan cheese and mild green chiles for some added flavor.

This is your basic a man a can and a plan recipe.  For the I love to make hamburger helper rather than actually cook crowd.  Don't get me wrong, I ate it and even had some leftovers which I ate.   I made the recipe as directed and it was edible but not memorable.   Might be better if enhanced with other ingredients.   I can see where kids might really dig this.

Very tasty. I did change a bit as I don't like mushrooms. I used cream of celery soup, and used beef and chicken taquitos. Hubby loved it.

The qiick, easy and 4-ingredient title caught my attention. I followed the recipe and it turned out very good! It had taste and texture of an enchilada! My friends enjoyed it, too!

Great week day meal. Anyone can make it as written. More experienced cooks will make it their own. 1st time made as is now  I just make it larger.   Black olives or roasted peppers and a dab of sour cream with a side of saffron rice. It's really worth trying and I think naysayers would be surprised.

Not bad at all, really simple to make and not cost prohibitive!I only gave a three because I wouldn't necessarily call it a recipe, but honestly, it tastes good. So on that note,  give it a try.

Quick and easy, I made it with cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  I served it with sour cream and my kids loved it.  Come on, can't get  any easier than this recipe.

This is simple, quick and easy.  I have the ingredients on hand for an easy dinner.  My husband loves it.
