I was going to make my shortcake out of Bisquick but decided at the last minute to make these. They are the best I've ever had! I heeded the advice of others and omitted the cream of tartar. I cut back baking powder to only 3 tsp. thought 4 tsp. was too much. I gently pulled mixture together after cutting in butter, with my hands in mixing bowl and instead of rolling and cutting, I formed into 12 gently formed balls. Flattened top just slightly and sprinkled with coarse sugar carefully cuz it tends to want to roll of the top. Just lightly pat into top so it stays put. They were great! Taste a little bit like shortbread. Very tender. I always use more sugar in my strawberries to create more of a juice. For the viewer that was wondering why theirs came out flat, check the expiration date on your baking powder, it is usually found on the bottom of the can. It doesn't stay fresh that long, so that might have been the problem. Hope this helps. Thanks Sara, this was delish!

I WANTED TO MAKE A TRADITIONAL STACKED STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE FOR A CROWD!  I searched for a nice cream biscuit recipe, and this was the one I used.  I was able to successfully double the biscuit recipe and bake in a 9-x-13 pan.  I kneaded the dough right in the bowl and then pressed into the 9-x-13 pan.  I forked the raw dough in the pan before baking.  It took my oven about 35- to 40-minutes to be done.  I cooled it about 10 minutes in the pan and then turned out on a rack to cool.  I sliced the biscuit in half  horizontally using a serrated knice and flipped it over on a serving platter using a thin cookie sheet like a giant spatula.  I then slathered the warm biscuit with butter and then layered the fresh strawberries with their juice that I had sliced up the night before with a little sugar and lemon juice on top followed by fresh whipped cream, the next buttered biscuit and then another layer of strawberries and cream.  Let it sit overnight in the frig, and it was delicious.  Presented the large cake for the crowd, and they loved it.  It sliced nicely into tall squares--some fell over, but it tasted incredible.  Thanks.

These were wonderful!!  My modifications included, 1) reduced amount of cream of tarter to only 1/8tsp(a pinch) 2) used food processor to cut in the butter 3) used 2% milk instead of heavy cream 4) added in 1-2 tsp vanilla extract 5) sprinkled tops with sugar before baking.

This is the best biscuit strawberry shortcake recipe I've tried.  I took all the advice given...left out the cream of tartar and cut the baking powder down to 3...added 1/2 tsp of salt...brushed with cream and sprinkled with sugar...soaked the strawberries overnight...AND made real whipped cream.  It turned out tender and sooo delicious...not too sweet and the taste resembled a tea biscuit.  Could not have been better for me and my crowd.

Hands down the best shortcakes I've ever made!  These shortcakes are flaky like a pie crust but soft and chewy like a biscuit.  I prefer to add lemon extract with poppy seeds and to make 6 large rather than the 12 smaller ones.  I also roll them in my hands and flatten on the cookie sheet and use half-and-half if I don't have the cream.  I originally made this recipe following all ingredients to a T and it was delicious, my lemon version just sounded good one night.  I also mixed in some fresh blueberries as they are good with lemon as well. Serve with homemade sweetened whipped cream and WOW! what a treat.

I needed a quick recipe for shortcake for a last minute dessert during the Memorial Day holiday.  I read some of the reviews and decided to go with the opinion of those who did not use cream of tarter, and only 3 teaspoons of baking powder.  As I mixed in the egg and cream, I decided to add a bit of vanilla to the dough, using one teaspoon.  I liked how it came out. The shortcakes were good enough to eat alone, without any fruit or whipped topping!

It was INSANELY good. I halved the recipe and omitted the cream of tartar, per other reviews. Also, I only had 2% milk on hand (and didn't feel like going to the store) so I used that instead of cream, and I noticed no difference in the taste. They were divine, and I will DEFINITELY be making these again.

I was told (the first time that I made this) that it was the best shortcake that they had ever eaten!  I am a cooking novice and after reading the reviews I tried this recipe.  I eliminated the cream of tartar and cut the baking powder down to 3 and it was wonderful.  I also made a strawberry glaze by putting the strawberries and 1/2 cup of sugar in a pot and boiled them for the glaze.  Everyone thought they were wonderful.  I made them again today.  Yum!

I don't see how the last review could substitute applesauce for butter in a shortcake recipe and then be surprised at a poor result! I think this recipe is wonderful. I have always used the no cream of tartar version. Sometimes I use whole wheat flour (or half white and half ww) to improve the nutrition, and it is still great.

My dad says that this is just like his mother used to make for him when they lived in the south. Genuine thick, dense strawberry shortcake. Absolutely delicious. I don't know if I'll use the cream of tartar next time I make it; it did add a bit of an aftertaste. Not unpleasant, just unconventional. Still, the best shortcake I've had since I was in Maryland. Bravo!

After reading a TON of reviews and adding my own touch ....I compiled suggestions and came up with the following - which turned out beautifully...  3 C flour, 3/4c sugar, 4 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp cream of tarter and 1 tsp vanilla - mix dry - shave 1 c frozen butter into mix. Mix together 1 beaten egg with 1 1/4 c heavy cream and pour into dry mix.  Knead on floured surface for two mins. Roll out to about 1/2" thick and cut into circles (I used a large glass). Place your circles in a buttered pan, brush with heavy cream, sprinkle with generous amt of sugar and bake at 350 for 20 mins. Remove from pan to cooling rack immediatley so that the bottoms do not burn.  I used a strawberry glaze recipe with the strawberrys and mixed 1 c sugar + 1 tsp almond extract with a large carton of heavy whipping cream.  Family can not stop eating!

This IS strawberry shortcake and shouldn't be compared to putting strawberries on biscuits or pound cake. Shortcake means it has a lot of shortening; the crumb is between biscuits and pie crust.
Be sure to split the shortcake, not stack two together. Also let the berries rest a few hours after sugaring to develop juice.

I just did not like this recipe.  I was expecting a more buttery, sweet shortcake.  This was very dry, and I thought it had a bit of a bizarre aftertaste (maybe from the cream of tartar).  I won't use this recipe again.

YUMMY!!!!!  I have always liked strawberry shortcakes on biscuits, but my husband doesn't agree; I figured I'd give these a whirl to see how they worked for the both of us.  Amazing!  I halved the recipe but still used one whole egg.  Only used a pinch of cream of tartar and added vanilla extract and a few drops of almond extract.  It came out like a biscuit/cake/pie crust hybrid; Flaky yet moist and slightly crumbly with a hint of sweetness.  I rolled the dough into balls and flattened them but they spread a little too much during baking.  I think I will try making them in Texas muffin tins next time to keep the size.  Also, I slice the strawberries and stir with the sugar many hours in advance to encourage the sugar to draw out the liquid in the berries, creating a light syrup.  And since the recipe calls for heavy cream, whip some up to add fresh whipped cream to the fresh shortcakes!

I made mine bigger than the recipe called for and did not add the cream of tartar as recommended by other members. The result was delicious and huge buttery and flaky shortcakes.

Absolutely the best shortcake we have tried from this site. Perfect in everyone's opinion. The only change I made was to back down the cream of tartar to about 1/8 teaspoon. Texture reminds me of a very tender shortbread/biscuit combo that is not overly sweet and really lets the fresh berries shine. Still delicious the next day. Cant wait to try it with various fresh berries/fruit this summer. Thanks for sharing!

These were GREAT... 

I did not have Heavy Cream on hand so I used 2% milk and added a bit of salt and they were awesome.

This was amazing - omitted cream of tartar based on reviews and the cakes were fabulous.  Served with strawberries and blueberries that were marinated in sugar and balsalmic, and did homemade whipped cream with a little sugar and almond extract.  Divine dessert and the leftover cakes were great for breakfast with jam and butter the next morning!

I made the recipe exactly as written and loved it, as did all my family and friends I shared it with. I like the flavor of the cream of tartar. This is great if you like a not-too-sweet, dense cake, the perfect background to fresh berries and homemade whipped cream.

A pain to make (hence the 4 stars), but they were so much better than the store-bought variety! Made exactly as is with no changes.

Wonderful! I froze the butter and grated it instead of cutting it in, worked perfectly. I also brushed the tops with egg white wash and sprinkled some sugar crystals on top.

I made this with the other reviewers suggestions (cut out the cream of tartar and reduce the baking powder) and I also added some lemon extract...I think this gave it a very refreshing taste.  I also made 12 individual shortcakes (roll them in balls and flatten them slightly) and it turned out great!  So easy to make and looks like you spent more time on it than you really did.  Will definitely make this again!

This was the first time I tried making strawberry shortcake, and followed the advice of others, about not using the cream of tartar and using only 3 tsp baking powder. I also used applesauce instead of butter for the recipe. I was disappointed with the results however, it tasted like sweet bread with a strawberry filling.

I used this recipe for my daughter's 3rd Birthday party because of the whole Strawberry Shortcake theme. The guests loved it!!! It was almost gone when I got a little bite. It was a hit! Even my girlfriend who was allergic to strawberries loved it. I know I will be using this recipe again sometime. Thanks!!!

This was a very good recipe, although I also left out the cream of tartar and one tsp of baking powder.  This was a very good dessert, a little too cakey, but I still prefer my strawberry shortcake the old fashioned way with just a sweetened biscuit dough.

I chose to follow and use all ingredients in original recipe as I could not understand how another reviewer thought that the end product had a strange taste and blamed it on the Cream of Tartar???  I was well pleased with the results!!  No funny taste, not flat, just a simple, light and subtly sweet shortcake.  I hate the sponge type things they sell in the stores as I think they are far to sweet and detract from the berries.  This is a perfect compliment to your berries and with just the hint of sweetness allows for the use of whipped cream without overwhelming sugariness (I just made that up, but for lack of a better word I think it works)!

We REALLY did not care for this shortcake.  It turned out fluffy and just slightly odd tasting. The consistency was off.   I guess I was looking for more substance and flavor.

We were disappointed with this recipe.  When I invest so much fat into a dough, I expect it to be fantastic.  Unfortunately the end result was flat, bland, and crumbly.  The cakes did soak up the strawberry juices, but even then they didn't shine.  It's too bad because the dough was easy to work with and retained it's shape well while baking (I used cookie cutters to make fun shapes).

I was a little disappointed by the shortcake in this recipe.  It was simple, but not quite as good as I had hoped.

My stomach still hurts from eating so much of this.  I have never made strawberry shortcake because I distinctly remember not enjoying the taste of the taste of the shortcake growing up.  This recipe has changed my mind!  Making your own whipped cream and using fresh strawberries just makes it even more scrumptious!  I can't wait to have it again tomorrow!

Great, quick, and easy shortcake recipe! I reduced the baking powder by 1 tsp. & added 2 tsp of vanilla extract as other reviews suggested. I served it w homemade whipped cream & a strawberry and blueberry mixture (w little sugar) that was saturating overnight. Lovely summer dessert!

I made this recipe for 15 people and they ALL raved about it!! I doubled the recipe and heeded the advice of others and reduced the baking powder to 3 tsp.(per single recipe). I also omitted the cream of tartar. I added more flour as I kneaded it right in the bowl. I then rolled the dough into about 20 2.5" balls and flattened them to about 1" thick on a cookie sheet, leaving approximately 2" between. Once the cakes cooled I split them and filled them with the freshly whipped cream and thinly sliced strawberries. I spooned a good sized dallop of cream on the top of each and covered them in more sliced strawberries. Very satisfying, buttery and light - quite a treat!!

Crumbly and soft the way my grandmother used to make 'em. I used 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar. I think 1/2 thickness is not thick enough. 3/4 to 1 inch would be better. I used a round biscuit cutter and got 15 cakes. Prep time isn't 25 minutes, more like 15. I used same temperature, 350, but used convection and baked 15 min. Perfect.

This is the perfect, traditional biscuit-like shortcake.  My family adores biscuits, but plain biscuits are not sweet enough for a strawberry shortcake dessert.  These are delicious--simple, sweet, tender.  I substituted skim milk for the heavy cream and still thought they were heavenly.  Served them with the spiced strawberry syrup, and they were wonderful.

My only critizism is the cornstarch is unnecessary and it does not need to be kneaded and rolled. It works fine as a drop dough. I ommitted the corn starch and rolled balls in my hands. My dough was sticky, not great rolling material anyways. I am not sure if that's because I didn't use corn starch. I also used less baking powder (I ran out) and more sugar (my own preference) But over all this is THE best tasting dough ever!

I bake a lot of stuff at home and frequently work with different types of dough.  I noticed the dough was a little dry and increased the whipping cream to 1 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup.  The result was excellent. Try adding some cinnamon and vanilla to the strawberries. Overall this was an excellent dessert.

Very good!  The cakes were good enough to eat plain.  I did not use the cream of tartar.  Also, I did not pat the dough to 1/2 inch, more like an inch thick for our personal preference.

Made this for Mother Day this year (2009) and they turned out amazing.  I followed some of the previous reviewers advice and excluded the Cream of Tartar...but everything else I used as directed.  It should be noted that when combining everything together, it might seem like the dough will be very dry, however when you do the kneeding part for 2min, thats when the dough really comes together.  I almost was about to add some more heavy cream to the dough when I first started putting it together because it looked so dry...but im glad I didnt.  I also chose to form the dough into individual balls and press them down slightly before baking them.  I like the way the come out and look...a little more rustic and "homemade", and you also get that nice edge crust all around.  Yum!

I just didn't enjoy this recipe as much as the others here.  It was a lot of fun to make, but it just didn't taste all that special.  I guess I expected the dough to rise a lot more.  Mine was more like shortbread than shortcake.  Did I do something wrong?

Super easy AND delicious!  I skipped the cream of tarter like someone recommended and dropped the baking powder to 3 teaspoons, then pulsed the dry ingredients + butter in my food processor until crumbly and dumped into a large mixing bowl to receive the wet ingredients.  Whisked the egg before adding it into the mixture with the cream, then kneaded directly inside the bowl until it came together.  Instead of rolling it out, I quickly divided it into 12 individual balls, flattened on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then sprinkled a touch of sugar on top for extra crunch.  The result was a crumbly, crispy, crunchy, soft, buttery shortcake that paired beautifully with fresh strawberries, as well as the "Lime and Tequila Infused Strawberries" recipe from this site too!

Thank you thank you thank you! I've been searching for the perfect Strawberry Shortcake recipe for years, and I've finally found it! My kids agree, the search is over. Complete perfection. I used a round biscuit cutter so they would all be the same size. Due to the altitude here I had to make a couple adjustments to the amounts. I reduced the baking powder to 3 3/4 tsp, added 3 tbs of cream, and then increased the oven temperature to 375. I did not change anything else. The biscuits are buttery with just the right amount of sweetness. We all agreed that they're almost like cookies in flavor. They are also extremely filling. One of those is a meal. Make sure you use home made whipped cream for this, the spray can stuff won't hold up.
Thank you so much for sharing this!

Easy and delicious! A little on the dry side but I liked that... It soaks up more strawberry juice that way. I think next time I will sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the shortcakes before I bake them.

This turned out pretty good with using some changes in most of the reviews I read. I did increase the sugar to 1/2 cup, omitted the cream of tartar, also had no heavy cream so I used 1/2 n 1/2. This is not the recipe for someone who wants cake with there strawberries and cream, but I did enjoy it.

Delicious!  I couldn't resist eating some without the berries & whipped cream.  Yummy shortbread!  I also zested a little lemon rind in it.  It was a big hit at our Easter gathering.

These are sooooo good. We make them every strawberry season and we all love them! I do half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. Also I take out the cream of tartar and replace it with baking powder. Still sooo delicious! I recommend this recipe to all strawberry lovers!

I'm sorry, I must not be a "traditional strawberry shortcake" kinda person.  I found the shortcake very dry. I made this by following all the ingredients and directions to a t,  thinking by the rating, it would be the perfect start to a summer get-together.  NO ONE liked it!  I was so disappointed, Everyone agreed that it was too dry, and tasteless.  :-(
(We ended up pouring coffee creamer over the top, to give it more flavor...which actually helped....but, even the kids didn't like it!)
The shortcakes were fine on their own, but just didn't agree with my taste buds. 

I prefer strawberry shortcake on pound-cake, or angel-food cake....

If you are looking for TRADITIONAL strawberry shortcake, you'll probably like this!  

Won't make again.

Very nice texture with the indicated amount of cream of tartar however, it could be more flavorful its actually pretty bland. Will use again with more sugar.

The shortcake has a really good texture, flaky and slightly chewy at the same time, but it isn't too flavorful. My husband loved it but I still prefer a sweeter cake-like shortbread.

Scrumptious & Delicious just as the name says. This was certainly a hit today at Sunday dinner. I will be using it many more time. Made it just as the recipe says.

To those who thought this was not sweet enought or would be moist, etc.  Shortcake like this is more like a biscuit and less like cake.  It is not like the little round cakes you buy in the grocery store.

Absolutely delicious! I trust this site & its user reviews for a lot of the things I make. I followed a majority of opinions and omitted the cream of tartar. They turned out wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone, the recipe is simple, no need for tons of experience. A big hit with everyone who has tried them!!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was such a hit!!!!  I omitted the cream of tarter like the other reviews and mashed half of my strawberries with some sugar and used homemade whiped cream.  It was so good that we had a few kids licking thier plates clean!

As everyone seems to do, I left out the cream of tartar and used only baking powder.  I halved the recipe and divided it into 4 portions, which were generous but not overly large servings.  The shortcake was a little on the dry side.  3 of us ate them sandwiched with whipped cream and diced strawberries, mango, and blueberries.  The 4th person added vanilla ice cream, which she claimed dealt nicely with the dryness.  Overall it was tasty, but I might try another recipe looking for something moister.

This was very easy to make and delicious.  I realized after making and eating them that this recipe is basically the same as for scones.  These are very light and fluffy on the inside and nicely crispy outside.  I also left out the cream of tartar, decreased baking powder to 1T (3 teaspoons) and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I used real butter but had to substitute half-and-half, as I did not have heavy cream.  I tried making into squares but the dough was too sticky (from the heat and humidity of the season).  I would definitely use others suggestions and shape into balls, flatten and then sprinkle with sugar before baking.  I am going to try other variations for scones.  Wonderful recipe...and so easy.

I love this, it was terrific.  I followed the advice of others to reduce the baking powder to 3 tablespoons and omitted the cream of tartar.   Because I haven't made something like this before, I was worried the dough was too crumbly, but after kneading it, it all quickly came together -- so that's apparently how it should be.    The only other thing I did differently was added a little bit of lemon zest, which gave them a nice flavor.  I'm sure they're great with or without.    I don't think I'll be able to eat store-bought shortbread again!  Highly recommend this.

Good but not fabulous. The shortcakes tasted much like any other from scratch biscuit like shortcake I've had. I'll use this again, but it's not "heavenly."

Great recipe. I made a few changes. I used brown sugar instead of white, 1 cup whole wheat + 2 cups white flour and only used 3 tsp baking powder as per other reviewer's suggestions. Turned out light and flakey! Very nice.

So good and so simple.  Worth the effort (which really isn't much).  I borrowed these ideas from other reviewers: 1) froze the sticks of butter and then grated them 2) left out cream of tartar and scaled back baking power to 3 tsp 3) used half and half instead of cream. might try 2% milk next time? 4) Formed into 12 balls which I gently pressed and then topped with a little sugar 5) Mixed a little sugar into my sliced berries.  I've made it twice - once with homemade whipped cream and once with the kind in the can and while the homemade whipped cream was better, the other version was still scrumptious!  I liked someone's idea of making a vanilla mascarpone cream and may try that next time.

Excellent!! I made this for my husband's birthday, and I feel like (after many tries over the years) I finally found a strawberry shortcake recipe he loves! I took others' advice -- omitted the cream of tartar (mainly because I was out of it) and used only 3 teaspoons of baking powder. I also upped the sugar a little (1/3 c instead of 1/4 c), because I know he likes it sweet. I spread the kneaded dough out in two lightly sprayed 8" cake pans and baked for about 20 minutes. Then I made them into a layer cake, with a layer of frozen whipped topping and strawberries in between and another on top. It looked beautiful and everyone raved about how delicious it was. Thanks!

The shortcakes were okay, but I thought only average.  They tasted like they needed salt -- I would add 1/2 to 1 tsp salt to this recipe to keep them from being bland.  I also cut back on the cream of tartar to avoid the aftertaste.

this is great shortcake; make sure you know what kind of shortcake you want. this seems very authentic to me, and i love to attend the strawberry festivals in texas and eat strawberry shortcake. the cakes are not too sweet, which is what you want since the berries will be! make sure you make the cakes at least a half-inch thick before baking so you can have reasonably thick cakes to cut in half (unless you like it thinner). i also did not use cream of tartar, although i may add a tad of vanilla or almond next time for variety. this would work with any other kind of berry -- thanks for the great recipe!

A friend asked for Strawberry Shortcake for dessert for her birthday dinner.  I have never made it before and was thrilled with the results from this recipe. It was easy and everyone loved it!   It was not to sweet and very delicious...I added a dollop of home made whipped cream.

A+++ recipe!!  My husband LOVED it!  This was my first time ever making strawberry shortcake from scratch and I will say it was very easy to whip together and the end result was DEEEELICIOUS!  Will probably make this recipe for 4th of July along with a scoop of homemade ice cream.  What a way to cool down in the heat of summer!!

These are delish. They do crumble so I just broke them into pieces and put them in a bowl with the strawberries on top. I also kneaded the dough in the bowl instead of making a mess with flour on the counter. Then I just tore pieces away and put them on the cookie sheet that way to make them kind of puffy and they did. Right before baking them, I sprinkled sugar on top.  Wow...this is certainly a keeper...woohoo

Made just like the recipe with the exception of substituting 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream just because that is what I had on hand. Very good. The short cakes were light and fluffy. We'll hang onto this recipe.

The only change I made was using 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar.  These little biscuits came out so buttery and flaky!  Pretty close to perfect!

Good but not that much better than the recipe on the Bisquick box. Didn't know what size pan to use and the cakes came out too large and too flat. I do like the idea of making them square rather than rolling them out and making them round.

Made this today - and it was a hit. I DID read all reviews and use only a pinch of cream of tartar, and 3 tsp baking powder as per suggested by other cooks. And the result was a houseful of "oooh" and "wow"s. I didn't roll the dough out either, I just formed biscuit shapes and baked individually.

Light as a feather, flaky and the not so pretty ones you make from the scratch at the end we eat while warm! I sprinkle the top of the dough with raw sugar and gently press in before cutting. So pretty with a sugary crunch. I never kneed 2 minutes. I kneed it over gently maybe 7 times until the dough is soft but the butter is still small pea sized pieces. I also used cream and milk. I won't use another recipe! (For the people who had dry shortcakes- not enough liquid or baked too long. Mine have always come out perfect. I add more liquid if needed until it feels right)

I used 2 cups of all-purpose flour, and substituted the 3rd cup with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of cornmeal.  I used whole milk instead of cream and I think the mix was a little wetter that way, so I spread it in a 13X9 pan instead of kneading and making separate biscuits.  Oh my, it was so delicious.  This is my forever shortcake recipe.

This was a great shortbread recipe. Very simple and tasty. If you are looking for the sugary, cake-like store version, this will NOT do for you. But if you're looking for a dense shortcake, this is perfect. I did modify it to make it even easier, though. Here's what I did: Omit the cream of tarter. Knock the baking powder down to 3 teaspoons, and cut the butter in HALF. That's waaaay too much butter. I mixed it all by hand in a bowl, added egg and cream, and continued to mix in the bowl. Then, formed rough biscuit patties by hand and put them on a baking sheet. They turned out GREAT, rising and tasting delicious.

Take It to the Top!

It's been a very long time since I've had shortcake this good.  Unfortunately, when my grandmother passed away, we couldn't find the recipe for shortcake.  This comes as close as anything I have tried to her very fine shortcake.  The flavor is good, though I may add just a touch more sugar the next time I bake it.  The crumb is wonderful with a melt-in-your-mouth feel. We dressed it with a sour cherry compote comprised of canned sour cherries, honey, ice wine riesling, and a touch of cinnamon, mace, and allspice.  The taste was as if a small part of heaven had come down among us.    

 One warning: many recipes overstate their serving power–this really does makes twelve servings.  As we are a family of three, we've put a few in the freezer.  I hope they will save well.  If not, next time I make the recipe (and there will be a next time), I will try to reduce the number of servings.

We did a strawberry shortcake taste test at our house. We had a traditional biscuit type shortbread and this one. My company enjoyed the biscuit type shortbread more than this recipe and I have to agree. The high butter to flour ratio made this taste 
more like shortbread. It was fine, but when we did the taste test, the samplers perferred the way the biscuit type soaked up the juices and balanced so nicely with the strawberries and whipped cream
There just is soooo much unncessary fat in this shortcake.
I think we'd rather save our calories for the whipped 
cream!

These were delicious and a recipe keeper. I didn't have on hand heavy cream so I used half-n-half and I didn't notice a difference. Aside from that I added more sugar to my strawberries and let them sit overnight which created a sweet delicious berry juice. My kids loved these shortcakes and said "mom this is a keeper".

This was good but not what I remember having when I was younger. I think the shortcake was sweeter. I let the strawberries sit with the sugar too long. Don't add the sugar until a few minutes before serving.

Made with no changes. I did drizzle blackberry syrup over the top and added a few blackberries to the strawberries.  Very good, will make this again. Next time I will make them thinner.

Not my favorite dessert - I always experienced an angle food cake or sponge cake version but had good reviews from those who like this traditional cake. Made individual serving size rounds

I don't really know what I did wrong but I didn't think this was fantastic.  It calls for a lot of butter and I don't usually make high fat bake goods but I thought I'd give it a try.  It must be my error though because everyone loves it.  I'll try it again.

3tsp. baking powder no cream of tarter used french vanilla non dairy creamer(but would go  half w/milk next time) and learned a new method of adding butter (grating frozen, worked so good I'll try it with my pie crust recipes) used milk wash for tops prior to oven will use egg next time as I'd have liked them to brown more. Excellent texture a bit lighter then a scone. This is going to  be part of a fresh peach shortcake so the extra vanilla from the cream will complement it!

Yummy shortcake - tasted a lot like shortbread to me.  I followed the advice of others and omitted the cream of tartar and decreased the baking powder to 3T.  I also used fat free milk in place of the heavy cream.  My new favorite recipe!!

These were YUMMY!!!  I followed the advice of other reviews and omitted the cream of tartar and only used 3 tsp of baking powder.  I also used fat-free evaporated milk in place of heavy cream to reduce the fat.  Soooo good, I didn't miss the cream at all!

The shortcake has a very nice flavor!  Probably the best I've ever had.  Mine was slightly crumbly but the flavor made up for it.  I sliced my strawberries thin and added a little extra sugar.  I also sprinkled the shortcake with sugar.  EXCELLENT summer treat!!  Thank you for the recipe!!

This was very good. Made it without the cream of tartar & 3 tsp of baking powder. (Just thought I'd go with the opinion of the group) My husband and daughter loved it. Thanks!

Wow!  This is THE only shortcake recipe I will ever use!  I picked fresh strawberries and was looking for a homemade shortcake.  All I heard was, "oh my God, this is too good Mom!"  Thanks for the post, Sal ... strawberry season just got even better!!!  PS:  I did omit the cream of tartar and reduced the baking powder down to 3 tsp.

very good; i brushed with cream and sprinkled with raw sugar before baking, which sweetened it nicely and made it look a little less pale and more appealing.

Fabulous!!!  I had to add an extra egg (my first one was small) and a dash of fat free milk to get the batter to stick together.  The shortcakes were not dry at all once baked.

OK, really lovely shortcake. I didn't want to make minor changes, had too. I have been trying to come up with some sweet things for my DH who needs to bring his cholesterol down. I followed it exactly as written except I used non dairy creamer. I was nervous that it would ruin it. It came out wonderful. Light, airy, perfectly sweetened, super easy. I served it with fresh strawberries and blueberries and lite whipped topping. Just great. Honey, didn't notice a thing. And he is the beaker of detection on things nonfat, sugar free, diet, missing out kind of stuff. I am so confident now that next time I am using Splenda. 5 stars from me!

Have made this a few times now.Still 5 stars! The best shortcake we have ever had! Wanted to add in a few thoughts... The recipe does not give detailed instructions on how to mix this. I am not very good making light pastry stuff. My pie crusts for example need work. Reading the reviews, it is important NOT to handle the dough much. The less the better. So I did things like whipping the egg in with the cream, added the dry ingredients and mixed really well before moving on, and I just used my fingers to the small pieces of cut up butter. Used my hands to gently mix in the end, with a quick roll out with my rolling pin. I followed the ingredients exactly. Did not cut out  the cream of tarter as others suggested. Light, delicate, just great!!! Thank you.

Wonderful! Easy to make and delightful to eat. If you want straight edges on your shortbread, I would suggest useing a cleanes ruler to cut to squares. Great recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe for shortcake. No more angel food or pound cake for us. Yummy! I like mine with a little light cream or even half and half poured over it. My Dad ate it like that when Mom made shortcake, only she used sweetened bisquit dough.

I wanted to make some strawberry shortcake for a church gathering and I came across this recipe.  I had never had real shortcake before, so I decided to try it.  These came out great!  They were delicious... just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the strawberries and the texture was perfect.  I doubled the recipe and we ate a bunch of them for breakfast without anything on them or with just a small dab of jam.  I'll be making these again :).

I made these shortcakes for our 4th of July barbeque, and they turned out very good. Even my grandmother, who is very picky, said they were, "melt in your mouth good"! I would highly recommend this recipe! I followed the recipe except that I did not roll them out. I rolled them into balls and dipped the tops into sugar and flattened them slightly. They were wonderful!

For this type of shortcake this is an excellent recipe.   I would suggest not to omit the cream of tartar completely because that is what gives it the right texture.   Cut it back to 1/4 tsp. and definitely use butter.   Cream of tartar can be drying if too much is used.  To add vanilla just doesn't seem appropriate in a biscuit like this, at least not to  our taste.

This was absolutely delicious!  I've never had "real" strawberry shortcake and was NOT disappointed when I tried this.  I followed the recipe exactly (but did add 1 tsp vanilla) and I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really good, it had a light, buttery, flakey texture.  
I used my food processor to mix everything and had to use a little whole wheat flour when I ran out of white, sometimes that can make it more dry but that was not a problem at all.  I did not have a problem with tasting the BP or the Cream of tartar.  I lessened both the first time I made them and the second followed the recipe exactly the second round were more puffy.  Both the BP and Cream of tartar are rising agents changing the amount will affect how much the shortcake will rise.
This is a simple recipe for a simple but beautiful dessert!!

Look no further...the perfect shortcake recipe is here!  These were flaky, light and not too sweet.  I was out of cream and half and half, so I took a chance and used whole milk.  They were still fabulous. I was worried about over working the dough, but they weren't tough at all.  I'll be making this for years to come.  Very fun for kids to do as well.

The dough was very dry and took a while before it came together. I baked it for twice the time called for and it turned out very nice. It did have a shortcake kind of texture. I sprinkled white sugar on top before it went in the oven and this gave it a nice little extra. It was better than I thought it would be. Very light and delicate. Went great with strawberries in their own juice.

It's really *PERFECT*. This recipe is very similar to my biscuit recipe (2 C self rising flour, 1/2 C butter, 3/4 C heavy cream) so I am very familiar with it. I ended up with closer to 1 C cream. I also brushed tops with cream and sprinkled with demerra sugar. Marinated strawberries for a day and a half. Made homemade whipped cream. It was great -- thank you!

Divine! I used half&half instead of heavy cream b/c that's all I had and it was great! I soaked the sliced strawberries/sugar mixture for 1-2 hrs and it was a delicious topping! I also used a 1/4 tsp cream of tartar.. why not? Topped it all off with homemade whip cream. I only got 10 shortcakes out of the dough, but I'm not complaining b/c these were just soo good! They disappeared before my boyfriend could eat one on St. Patty's. Thanks!

I had my mum, stepdad and nan to lunch and they all loved this. Stepdad had 2 helpings. I took other reviewers suggestions and left out the cream of tartar but I did use the full amount of baking powder. I split the shortbread whipped the cream and put the sugar in with the strawberries in advance then made them up at the table so that they wouldn't go soggy. Thanks for a great dessert.

It turned out more like a scone than shortcake and the presentation is not very good. I also recommend adding whipped cream as a topping and the recipe does not note that.

Okay, can you believe the store was ALL OUT OF HEAVY CREAM!!!!!  So I bought flavored coffee creamer, French Vanilla, and used that.  I used the amount of creamer the recipe called for and cut the sugar in 1/2.  Basted the top of the shortcake with the creamer and sprinkeled sugar on top and WOW!!!!!  THEY TURNED OUT GREAT!!!!!  I think I could have used the full 1/2 cup of sugar but other than that.....Any flavor coffee creamer would be GREAT!!!!!!

This was absolutely THE BEST shortcake I have ever had.  I had something similar at a friend's house and was looking for a recipe as good and this far exceeds it!  Seriously, with real whipped cream made on the spot, this dessert is divine.  I love that it feels so light even though it's definitely chock full of yummy fattening stuff!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  A definite repeat at our house.  I can't wait to make it for guests!

These were ok, but I’ve had better. I followed as directed, but omitted the cream of tartar .  I honestly prefer Bisquick type short cakes. These were really high in fat, I think there could be a healthier alternative.

This is the best shortcake I have ever had! I've made it at least 4 times now. Despite carefully measuring all the ingredients I've always needed to double the cream to get enough moisture to bind the crumbs together. I wonder if regular cream would distribute better since it isn't as thick?

I do NOT eliminate the cream of tartar, reduce the baking powder, or increase the sugar. 

Since most shortcake recipes say to toss the wet ingredients with the dry just until combined, I've been leery of kneading it for 2 whole minutes per the instructions. This last time I kneaded it for a minute and it turned out flakier and rose higher!

I baked this into cake pans and made it into a wedding cake. Everyone raved about it! Thank you for a delicious recipe!

I loved these, but my husband not so much.  He's more used to the angel food cake you buy in the stores (mother didn't do much baking).  Anyways, I loved these, had extra and just used them to snack on at work.  Followed the advice of others by reducing the amount of cream of tartar and sprinkled the tops with sugar before baking.  I also used more sugar on my berries, and I served with homemade whipped cream.  I thought it was delicious, as did my little 1yo daughter.

Dull on flavor, short on sweetness and lacking in texture.   Yes, the strawberries and cream are the "main event" of this dessert, but the shortcake is the foundation and if it has no flavor on it's own and won't soak up the juices of the strawberries, it's not doing it's job.   My cakes were very dry and broke easily when cutting.   How is that possible with 1 cup of butter and some cream in the mix?   In my opinion, you're just not getting the bang for the buck here.

I completely disagree with lower baking powder and no cream of tartar suggestions.  I followed other reviews and made two batches with 3 tsp bp and no cream of tartar....then made a third batch as the recipe is written....third batch was by far the best!  Big, lofty....awesome.  4 stars because I found it a little drier than I would have preferred.

Delicious!!! I made just a few accidental variations--- First off, I ran out of whipping cream as little shy of 2/3 but luckily I had whole milk so it worked out just fine. The dough was just a little dry while kneading so I added probably a tablespoon extra of whole milk. Secondly, my silly boyfriend killed the timer after probably ten minutes of baking, so I had to check every five minutes. I must have baked longer than 20 minutes, more like 25 or 30 actually.... The biscuits do not get very 'golden brown', so just take them out when you can insert a knife and pull out clean. Also, I did not spread into a sheet, I made six traditional biscuits.

Came out perfect!!

UPDATE: I've been making this recipe for several years now and I still like it the best! Definitely use parchment lined baking sheets. Sprinkle the tops with a little turbinado sugar for a yummy, sweet finish.

Original Review 06/12/2012
I have tried a lot of strawberry shortcake recipes over the years and this one tops the list. It gets 5 stars in both taste and simplicity. 
I reduced the amount of cream of tartar to 1/4 tsp, I used a 3 inch square cookie cutter to get uniform pieces, and sprinkled them with raw sugar before baking.
This is a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

I followed this exactly but i used milk because that is all i had,  no cream of tartar, and reduced Baking Powder as most suggested. I am not sure what went wrong but the first batch looked pretty but had a really sharp after taste. So the next batch i added more sugar and vanilla extract- still a very bitter after taste. I would really love to know what caused this. I keep my baking soda in the pantry and it wasnt expired, but i did use great value butter. I know my grandma always said biscuits need good butter- maybe that was the problem? If anyone knows why please reply to this-i really would like to get this right.

Great! These are excellent. I don't like the really bready and dry shortcakes. Like someone said, these are flaky, kind of like a pie crust. I make my own strawberry concoction to go on them.

Rather tasteless as it is. Needs vanilla. I gave this recipe four stars instead of three because the strawberries I bought at the supermarket were rather tasteless too, which can't be blamed on the recipe.

This is a popular way to eat short cake, i.e, biscuit dough.  I prefer the sweeter version using either pound cake or hot milk spongecake.  Schaum torte, and I don't mean hard meringue shells, is the supreme shortcake base for us.  Thanks for your recipe, it affords some variety.

These are the best shortcakes I have had in a long time.  I patted them into rounds and sprinkled them with sugar before baking.  I did leave out the cream of tartar, only because I didn't have any, and used half and half because that's what I had on hand.  

I will make these again, following the recipe exactly, to see what the difference may be. However, they were a great consistency, soaked up the strawberry juice without getting soggy, and were not too sweet.  It's the closest to my favorite  recipe that was lost years ago.  Thanks for sharing!

I deleted the Cream of Tartar and used buttermilk instead of heavy cream (because that's what I already had). Turned out beautifully; flaky and tasty. I was just a bit discouraged with the lack of golden color after baking them.

These turned out great even though I had to use white wheat flour-being that is all I had-and I did as one reviewer just spread the dough in a 9x13 baking dish to make it easier.Just cut squares out, topped with the fruit and whip. Yum. Nothing left. I also did not use the cream of tarter since I had none as many had mentioned and did not seem to miss it.

I have no idea what went wrong, but this was bitter and just BAD.  The texture was nice, but the flavor was just awful.  I served it to a large group and they scraped the strawberries & cream off to eat without the shortcake.  I will experiment tomorrow and see what I can improve on.  I must say, I didn't think there was enough sugar in the recipe, but trusted the reviewers.  I have no clue what went wrong, but will get back with any further findings.

This was amazing!  It's so much more satisfying than a large cakey piece.  A little goes a long way.  Yum! We (1) reduced the baking powder and (2) omitted the cream of tartar.  Thanks Sal!

A little light on flavour.  I added some lemon zest but will put some vanilla in next time.  Easy and quick, nice for a breakfast treat.

Fabulous!  Kind of like a great shortbread cookie, only more moist.  The whole family loved it.  I did omit the cream of tarter.

I cut baking powder to 3 teaspoons, changed sugar to 1/2 cup, cream of tartar to 1/8 tsp and when I had it all in the pan, I pressed coarse sugar into the tops of the cake.  SO YUMMY!!

This made wonderful shortcake and was very quick and easy to make.  I did substitute half & half because I didn't have any cream on hand.  Not too sweet and definitely better than Bisquick!

Great shortcake recipe.  Good enough to eat on its own.  (Not that I would do that... )  I cut the baking powder to a little over 3tsp because of my 5000' altitude, and I didn't have any creme of tartar, but they turned out great.

I love this shortcake! I looked long and hard for a good shortcake recipe that I loved and this is it! I use a glaze that consists of strawberries, a squeeze of orange sugar and some water, add cornstarch and whoa-la a yummy glaze. I also use the rest of the heavy cream and turn it into whipped cream. My whole family of 40+ people thank you for this shortcake!

Very good.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and topped with cinnamon and sugar.  Next time won't bake as long as they were a tad dry. Used milk instead of heavy cream ,which may be the reason.

Perfect shortcake! This was remarkably easy and quite delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I made "easy whipped cream" to go with. This is what real strawberry shortcake is meant to be.

This was excellent.  The texture was like shortbread, a very tender biscuit.  I used only 3 tsp. baking powder and left out cream of tartar per another viewer's suggestion.  I did have to add a total of 1 cup of cream, as the batter was so dry.  I rolled the dough into 12 balls and placed on a cookie sheet, slightly flattening.  I put about a tbls. of strawberry mousse over each half bscuit, spooned sliced strawberries over the bottom biscuit,placed the top biscuit on and spooned a few more berries on top and topped it with cool whip.  My family thought this was the best strawberry shortcake ever and so do I.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

This is an easy and very delicious recipe. I only made 1/2 as there is only the two of us. I also rolled into 6 nice sized balls and topped with sugar. I also omitted the cream of tarter. I added 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I used half butter and half butter-flavored Crisco. I didn't have any half & half, so I used coffee creamer mixed with water.

I did as most others and omitted the cream/tartar, and reduced baking soda to 3. Added vanilla for flavor and brushed top w/butter. Is very dry, crumbly- definately more like a shortbead. Decent flavour. May try again.

This was amazing. As soon as I tasted it I wanted to whip up a second batch. I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream. I also used the flattened ball method recommended by others, and sprinkled the tops with sugar. I liked the shape of the shortcakes by using this method, but next time I'll make the balls larger, so each serving gets even more of the scrumptious cake/biscuit (even though this means less than 12 balls/servings).

I tried this recipe yesterday and I really enjoyed it! Tasted much like a biscuit and was so fluffy! I did cut the baking powder down by 1 tsp and I also cut down on the cream of tarter; I added just a pinch. Served it with vanilla ice cream in the middle, along with strawberries whipped cream on the top...delicious!!!

Delicious and beautiful shortcake.  I patted out the dough by hand and cut rounds with a large biscuit cutter. Can't wait to serve this to company.  I'll never use sponge cake rounds again!

I thought this was a very yummy base recipe.  I skipped the cream of tartar, cut down the baking powder by a teaspoon, split the cream (half cream and half almond milk) and split the flour (half whole wheat flour, half unbleached white).  I also added a short dash of salt to the biscuits.  I was told by my guests that it was the best strawberry shortcake ever!  I whipped my own whip cream using organic whip cream, almond milk, vanilla, and half confectioners sugar, half regular sugar until the consistancy was right.  :) Yay!

I took the advice of others to omit cream of tartar and only use 3 tsps of baking powder.  I also sprinkled the top of the shortcakes with raw sugar for some sparkle.  Everyone raved about the dessert.  I thought it was wonderful as weel.  The only complaint I had was that the shortcakes while delicious, seemed to be really rich and heavy.  I wonder if using half and half and possibly 2/3 of the butter would lighten them up.

These tasted good but didn't come out so pretty. I followed the recipe with the exception of using milk instead of heavy cream. I've had short cake before and you couldn't really tell the difference. These turned really poofy.

Really great!  I did as suggested by another user, and instead of cutting into squares after rolling out, I balled into 1" balls, then flattened a bit, dipped in sugar, then baked as directed.  These were a major hit, and I will for sure use them again!

I just made this using the standard mods (2.5t baking powder, no cream of tartar) and it turned out FANTASTIC. I took my butter right out of the freezer and diced it all up with a sharp knife, so the mixing was quick and painless. The shortcake is soooo flaky and has just the right amount of sweetness.

Great taste, but a little to greasy and buttery. Also, add 1/2 tsp lemon juice to the strawberries for a delicious and perfectly sweet taste!

This recipe was very different from the strawberry shortcake recipes I am used to but I did like it. It didn't seem cake like at all. The shortcake is more like a shortcake cookie. It was very tasty. I am in the middle of moving and had packed my rolling pins so I smushed the dough in a jelly roll pan and cut it into squares after baking. It worked out just fine. Lovely recipe!

Followed this to a 'T' and it was just what I was looking for. Real biscuits complement fresh, ripe berries and given plenty of whipped cream. Sugar baked into the shortcake is perfect! You won't be sorry. :)

Pretty good recipe. I liked it, but my mate thought the shortcake was too savory and a bit like a scone. The shortcake WAS a bit biscuit like, but very tasty all the same to me. Since I didn't purchase enough strawberries and whipcream, I just saved the shortcakes and had them with some eggs the next morning. Tasty!

Since I was out of heavy cream, I used evaporated milk. These cakes were a bit dry and a bit thin. I sprinked some sugar on top before baking them. I thought these shortcakes were too thin to cut. Next time, I would make these shortcakes a bit thicker.

I was looking to health it up a little.  I substituted half the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I also used skim milk instead cream.  It came out perfect.  I used my food processor to cut in the butter than mixed the wet ingredients by hand.  I also omitted the cream of tartar because baking powder, not soda was in the recipe.

very good recipe...definitely cut back on the cream of tartar. dough was a little too wet for comfort, but after kneading, a good elasticity formed and turned out very well.

I had never made shortcake before, and these turned out pretty good. I used 3 tsp of baking powder as recommended, and a small pinch of cream of tarter instead of the listed amount, and they turned out fine. About half of them were too thin to be able to cut in half; next time I'll  try to make them thicker. This recipe is so rich! While baking, my whole house smelled delicious.

I never had "real" shortcakes before, so I was curious to try these. Going with other reviewer suggestions, I used 3 tablespoons of baking powder, and 1/4 tsp cream of tarter. I noticed no strange after taste. I really like the texture, and even ate some plain and with strawberry jam. These got many compliments when I made them for a Memorial Day Cookout.

This was a really good recipe!  I took the advice and left out the cream of tartar and cut the baking powder down to 3, and it got rave reviews tonite.  I thought that it had a bit of an odd aftertaste, but I was the only one.  I served it with homemade whipped cream (I used the french vanilla blend vanilla) and strawberries that I soaked overnite in sugar.

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and omitted the cream of tartar.  I made this for my boyfriend and his family and they all thought it was delicious.  They especially loved the  cake.  I thought it was pretty good but somehow I guess I was expecting a bit more.  I will probably make this again but may tweak the recipe a little bit.

This was a very good recipe.  I omitted the cream of tarter as well and sprinkled powdered sugar over the top of them prior to baking. The shortcake turned out very well.  My boyfriends dad had 3rds, even though he's on the Atkins diet.  :)  I grew up pouring milk over top of my shortcake so I did that, and it was d-lish.  I'm making this recipe for my parents next...My dad is the ultimate judge of Strawberry Shortcake.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. I guess that I should have read the reviews first... As someone else mentioned, this turned out more like a scone than shortcake. You definitely need home-made whipped cream with it.

This was the first time I have made old fashioned shortcakes.  We usually use those dessert cups from the grocery store.  These are way better. Quick and easy to make, I had all ingredients on hand.  They came out perfectly and the feeling of accomplishment from making my own homemade shortcakes just warms my heart!!  Thanks!!

I was so happy to come across this recipe! Homemade shortcake is something that I've only a couple of times in my life, and this has always been in a restaurant. I had no idea how to make the real stuff, and usually resorted to a quick-mix type of recipe. This recipe is outstanding; and I even found myself munching on the shortcake minus the strawberries. I prepared this just as written, minus the Cream of Tartar as per other reviewers' suggestions. Wonderful recipe, Sara!

These did not taste good in any way shape or form.  Well, I lied.  If you smother them in butter and honey, they are all right.  They browned very fast in oven.  Had to turn oven off.

Best ever. The second time I made it I didn't have any cream in the house so I substituted milk and sour cream 50/50. Outstanding! I will make it that way from now on. The whole family raved about it.

I told my fiance this would "ruin" his concept of strawberry shortcake forever (he was used to the store bought sponge cakes). Needless to say, things is his favourite and he requests it for his birthdays.

If you like homemade whipped cream as well, then I highly suggest putting the bowl you use in the freezer for at least 30 minutes prior to whipping.

I'm a Bisquick shortcake recipe girl; it's what I grew up on, and I've never found anything to replace it that I love better. That said, this came mighty close. Soft, fluffy, and buttery biscuits drowned in sugared and juiced strawberries. So delicious. I did omit the cream of tarter per other reviewer suggestions, and used 3 tsp. baking powder instead of 4. I doubled the recipe; my family ate until we were stuffed, and then I still had enough left-over for breakfast the next day!

I made this recipe as written.  Everyone enjoyed them! In fact, the shortcakes were gone before the strawberries, as they were eaten without anything on them. It has a nice crumb and isn't too sweet and was easy to make.   Perhaps the reviewer who stated the recipe had a funny taste, possibly due to the cream of tartar, used bad cream?

This strawberry shortcake was very good. The shortcake was not soggy when you add the strawberries and cream. The recipe does make 12 shortcakes which I will cut the recipe in half next time for four people.

Followed everything and took everyone's suggestion to reduce Cream of tartar.  I thought it had a nice flavor but it seemed dry and crumbly.  Need to research how to make it less so.  Regardless, making it for dessert for a 4th of July party.

Wonderful! I really liked that it wasn't too sweet. With the sugary strawberries added there was plenty of sweetness! Used less cream of tartar per other comments.

This was wonderful.  Took me back to my childhood.  I did make a couple of changes; I used White Lily baking flour because I was out of all purpose flour.  I added vanilla extract ( about 1 1/2 teaspoon) and I left out the cream of tartar.  My husband was so impressed and he never eats strawberries but this shortcake made it worthwhile.

Thank you Sal for this absolutely delicious biscuit recipe!  I followed LazyFoodieGirl's advice:
Omitted the cream of tarter and reduced the baking powder to 3 teaspoons.  Pulsed the dry ingredients in the food processor.  Added cubes of cold butter to the processor and pulsed about 15 times.
Emptied the mixture into a large bowl.  Mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with the egg and a tsp of vanilla in a small Pyrex 2-cup measuring cup.  Poured the wet on top of the dry.  Mixed.
Floured my hands and kneaded in the bowl for about one minute (maybe a bit less).
Formed the dough into small balls (13), flattening them out with my hand slightly.  Brushed with 1/2 and 1/2, sprinkled with sugar.  Baked on a Silpat lined 1/2 sheet for about 15-18 minutes.  
Theses are supposed to be for dessert tonight.  I don't think they will make it.  So delicious and so easy.  Why did I wait to make these?

This is a very forgiving recipe, I make it with Pamela's gluten free bread flour. The flour is very silky and soft so I always need more than a recipe states, and this flour is expensive! I'm able to make delicious and easy little biscuits in no time! And I don't need to add an excessive  amount of flour.

Sensational! I made this for my fiancée's birthday and it was a major crowd pleaser! One guest even had thirds! I made the shortcake recipe for 24 servings so I could make two 9x13 cakes to make one stacked shortcake. For each layer cake, I made a few changes--substituted some whole wheat flour for white flour, omitted the tartar, used 2% milk instead of heavy cream, and added one teaspoon of vanilla and a half teaspoon of salt. I rubbed some room temperature butter on the top of the first layer cake a few minutes after it came out of the oven, then layered with the fresh whipped cream and strawberries, then placed the second cake on top, and did more layering of the cream and berries. I used about 6 cups of strawberries (3 pints) that I marinated with fresh lemon juice and sugar the day before. I made the whipped cream while the cakes were baking so it was very fresh. This cake was a hit with everyone!

I have never tried Strawberry Shortcake before and this was pretty delicious.  I added a Strawberry Bourbon Syrup to it and it really took it over the top.  I made the recommended revisions (No cream of tartar, 3 tea spoon baking powder instead of 4, egg white wash with sugar before baking).  It is a nice combination between a biscuit and cookie texture - a bit dry for my taste but it actually grows on you the more you eat it.

Awesome!!!  I read one reviewer noted they were dry. These are a kind of dry shortcake- perfect for soaking up the strawberry juice, YUMMMM!!!!  I thought the taste was spot on. I froze the butter then shredded it into the dry mix and it worked great. Also I did not use cream of tarter; and used a little less baking powder as indicated.

Changed a lot to make it healthier! Substituted 2cups of wheat flour for 2 cups of the white. So one cup white 2 cups wheat. Blended 2 apples and a quarter cup of Splenda and added it to the dry ingredients (no butter or egg) used Splenda in place of white sugar in all areas. Added about a quarter cup of while milk instead of cream. Turned out really good! And much healthier for all of my friends losing weight!!

It was really delicious and much easier than I imagined strawberry shortcake to be. I didn't use cream of tartar b/c I couldn't find any. Had to add a little flour at the end to make the batter less sticky. Followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 tsp. of baking powder instead of 4. Kneaded dough right in the bowl and divided it into 12 balls (half flattened). Baked it about 20 min. Topped with homemade whipped cream and a little powdered sugar.

Made this for Easter dessert - super yummy! Definitely a "short bread" - buttery, flaky, but holds together really well so you can stab it with a fork.  So good!

This is a lovely way to celebrate seasonal strawberries. Made this today in Abu Dhabi,  where they don't sell Cream of Tartar. They turned out ok, but I prefer a better rise and a more fluffy shortcake. Don't leave out the Cream of Tartar!

This came out dry and crumbly for me, but the taste was there so I'll probably work with this recipe again.  If you are looking for a spongey shortcake, this is not the recipe for you.

I have NEVER tasted such a delicious shortcake in my life! It was so flavorful and not at all dry!  I sliced up my strawberries with an egg slicer, and then pureed another cup of berries to make the berries juicier.  I made this for a family event and everyone-adults and kids loved it!!  No tartar necessary for this recipe. Will be making this often!

These were so delicious. I only added 3 tsp of baking powder and omitted the cream of tarter. I also added a tsp of vanilla extract. They came out nice and fluffy. I cut them into 6 large squares, brushed them with heavy cream and sprinkled sugar on top. What a treat! I actually found that they were better the next day. They were flakey and the edges were crispy. Went well with homemade whipped cream and strawberries that were cut hours earlier and mixed with sugar. I will definitely be making these again!

So this is what REAL strawberry shortcake tastes like? This was just so delicious. I never knew making shortcake from scratch was so easy. The shortcakes were light and fluffy and had just the perfect texture.  I skipped the cream of tartar and used 3 tsp of baking powder, as suggested by other reviewers. I added about 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I didn't have a pastry cutter on hand, so I just used a knife and my hands to make sure the texture was nice and crumbly. Rolled into 12 balls and smashed them down to 1/2 inch size then sprinkled with some sugar. 20 minutes in the oven was perfect for me. Be careful when slicing the shortcake, because its nice and crumbly and may fall apart easily if you aren't careful, but then again, its supposed to do that, its shortcake! I can't say enough great things about this recipe. It was awesome.

Yummy flavour.  I made the dough too thick, but because it fluffed up quite a bit I could cut them in 1/2 horizontally. Think I'll try the tip of making the balls & flattening them.  Even so, it was a hit with the family. Yes, it is a keeper!

This is excellent. I wanted to keep eating more. I did follow the recipe exactly regarding ingredients; however, one reviewer recommended rolling the dough into balls, dipping the tops in sugar and flattening slightly which worked out great for me.  This is a definite keeper for me.

Everything has already been said!  Wayyyyyy good!  I ommitted the cream of tartar, scaled to 3 tsp baking soda, and made the dough into 12 rounds.  Tastes just like I imagine a shortcake should - like cake and shortbread crossed!

I don't know what went wrong here.  My dough was beautiful, and then it never turned 'golden' in the oven so I ended up leaving it in for more time.  My boyfriend said it was like eating crunchy toast.  I'm sure this recipe is fantastic and I just failed miserably at it.

So easy and so delicious!  Like many other reviews I didn't use cream of tartar (because I don't have it), and used 1% milk instead of cream.  You couldn't tell a difference and my husband loved it.  After mixing I kneaded in the bowl and formed round dough balls and placed in a round pan.  I wet the top with tiny amount of milk and sprinkled with sugar.  Some sliced strawberries with powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream made this perfect!

SIMPLY PERFECT!!!  I've been looking for a recipe like this one!  I like the soft texture and the slightly sweet biscuit this makes!  It's not rock hard like many of the other recipes I've tried.  Thanks for sharing!  This is a keeper!!

This is the best shortcake that I have ever made.  I made the suggested deletions/reductions posted in earlier reviews.  I think next time I make them, I will add lemon zest.

These are good, but my first reaction upon tasting was OMG, this needs salt! It really needs salt to balance it out (especially if you're using unsalted butter), a 1/2 tsp will do. I prefer my Cook's Illustrated recipe, though.

Yummo, I also changed the recipe as follows, I added powdered sugar to the strawberries and let them sit for a few hours. I deleted the cream of tarter and decreased the baking powder to 3teaspoons  and i upped the sugar to 3/4 of cup for the dough and upped the cream to 1 1/4 cup. I place in a buttered 9x13 pan. This will be a special at our restaurant this weekend and I am sure it will sell out. Thanks again. P.S brush the top of dough with cream and sugsr to top.enjoy

Very good flavor.  They were good just to eat plain too.  I was going to make these but had to have my daughter do it instead.  She rolled it out too thin so they were hard to split open.  I will try these again only thicker.

This was really yummy.  I cut the strawberries a couple of hours beforehand and let them sit in the sugar for a couple of hours.
Easy recipe.  Followed it to a T.

Wonderful recipe.  Made these for my Dad's 82nd birthday.  Mom said it was the best she has ever had, and apparently her mom used to make biscuits from scratch, also.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I loved this and my family does too. I doubled the recipe for twelve but still made twelve shortbreads- it makes it easier to cut and stuff with strawberries. Becareful of burning bottoms though..twenty minutes is just about enough. I also used whipped cream in the center and top and garnished the top of the whipped cream with a strawberry for decoration...very cute.
I also adapted the recipe for my little sister's gluten free diet using gluten free flour for the shortbread- a little less sweet but not bad

Hmmm, not really my taste. I guess I was imagining it to be more moist and less dry. I can't say it's bad, but I can't say I really liked it either. I don't think I'll make this again.

I was wanting to make a special strawberry shortcake and read the great reviews for this one.  Well I was disappointed.  To me it did not even taste like shortcake - pretty dry and uneventful for presentation.  Will not make it again.

I thought these shortcakes were excellent!!!! They provided just the right sweetness to off set the tartness in the strawberries.  I also added whipped topping (can't have strawberry shortcake without it!) and the flavors came together perfectly.  Another thing I loved is the crispness of the cakes.  They weren't doughy like biscuits.  I will DEFINITELY make these again.

Not a good shortcake recipe.  Too much baking powder gives an aftertaste which, amazingly, is worse with the cream and strawberries.  I have discovered that they make good scones with coffee however so all is not lost.  I won't use this recipe again though.
