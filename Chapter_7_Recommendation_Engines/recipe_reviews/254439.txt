These turned out great! I used leftover mashed potatoes from the night before that were seasoned with green onion, red bell pepper, and cheese.  Although I do not make a habit of eating Spam often, this would be great to take out on the boat for those early morning fishing trips.

Made it and will definitely make it again  I did use a little more oil to fry it, my pan was not that big so I could only fry a little at a time
