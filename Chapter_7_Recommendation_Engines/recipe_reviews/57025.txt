It's my kind of drink so I'm biased, but I loved it.  Got sick of the taste and calories from gin and tonics so gave this a try and really enjoyed it. The photo is of a martini glass version, but this really needs to be a bigger, highball glass kind of drink because trust me, you'll want more!  I make something similar with gin, a squeeze of bottled key lime juice and diet citrus soda, but this was really very good. Thanks for posting Grosbach!

This was great!  I'm not a big fan of gin, but this was light & tasty.  We'll use it for our 1920s party!

This was a really good drink with far less calories that my typical gin and tonic. It's not as sweet (although, I only used a large pinch of sugar), and you really need a good gin - but I enjoyed it.
