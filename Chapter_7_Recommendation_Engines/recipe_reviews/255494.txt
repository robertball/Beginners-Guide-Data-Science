I would give it four stars but no one in the whole family liked it. Everyone took one bite and put it aside. Too many pecans, too sweet, too jiggly, where's the cake??.......endless excuses as to why this was not a good dessert.  Thank goodness I made a pumpkin cheesecake or we would not have had dessert this Thanksgiving!

This recipe is delicious!  I only used 1 cup nuts.  Two seemed like a lot.
