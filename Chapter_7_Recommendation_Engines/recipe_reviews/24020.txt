I used this recipe to make Baklava. I don't know what Baklava looks like, tastes like, and I've never cooked with Phyllo Dough either. My finished product tasted delicious though so 5 stars for the recipe!!! I can never find Phyllo Dough in the grocery store so this recipe helps out alot. ***UPDATE*** I finally cooked with phyllo dough and I must say that this is SO MUCH BETTER! I'm never going to use the packaged stuff ever again.

This reminds me of the recipe my mom used to use when making her Macedonian cheese burek. She would use old clean sheets specifically saved for this purpose and roll out countless phyllo snakes full of tasty feta/egg mixtures.  I remember 3-4 large sized pans baked on Saturday mornings.  And the crispy flaky texture was amazing.  Puts the store bought stuff to shame and I could never understand why anyone would use store bought.  This is more versatile.

Girl!  First time to use this  and make it for Baklava-it was wonderful!  This is also the first time I had not changed the recipe slightly.  You have a winner!  It is also fun to play with!

I tried this recipe a couple days ago and it worked wonders. I used it for some chicken roll-ups which I fried in oil. I would use this as an equivalent for frying a tortilla for a mexican style dish. It's less greasy that using a tortilla.

I live 4 hours away from Brooklyn, where I used to get the BEST knishes.... Was really craving a good sized NY-style knish, and this is the recipe I used for the dough. I tripled the recipe to produce 5 large-size rounds (about the size of a dinner plate). I had no trouble with it except to say that I added an additional teaspoon of white vinegar even after tripling the normal amt to help let it stretch. (Which if you weren't aware is the reason the dough stretches so well in the first place - you could substitute with the same amt of lemon juice if you were making more of a dessert dish.) FANTASTIC - and it really hit the spot!

20/04/2009 I`ve never bought Phyllo dough because I have problems to find it in my country. I used this recipe. I don`t know how Phyllo dough must be, all I can say, this recipe makes very good dough. 5 stars ****Update***Finally I found Phyllo and I have to change the rewiew. I realized this is not a phyllo dough substitution. It is imposible to roll and stretch the dough so thin as phyllo is, so you will get the wrong dough and texture in final dish. When you bake with phyllo you put a few layers together. It is imposible to do with this dough. Even if you are able to stretch this dough very thin without tearing, the layers will stick together, so you will get almost one layer after baking. The texture wasn`t flaky at all. I realized this recipe can't be used for Baklava and other Arabic sweets or Greek recipes with Phyllo. I tried this dough for other recipes without success too.

I like this recipe.  I do not know how this recipe calls it for cooking it this long, my phyllo would have been burnt to a crisp. Maybe it is just my oven lol. (new oven too)  They came out all right.  I wanted to add some vanilla extract the second time, it ruined the consistant of the dough and would not stretch. I guess this is one of those recipes you need to be careful how you change things up a bit.  Maybe it was the alcahol in the extract.  good recipe nonetheless.

I used this recipe and rolled it out and cut it into squares, I put the ingredients for shepard's pie in each of them and pinched the dough at the top so it looked like a ball with a bow on top. it turned out great. my whole family loved it. I served it with a little gravy. thanks for the recipe. 5-5

i Used this recipe to fry small cheese & chopped oregano filled pies, cooking time was so fast & turned a nice golden color within minutes.  I didnt try baking it though but I love the way my pies turned out nice & tasty!

I made the recipe as called for but it turned out to be somewhat drier than others that I have made. I would suggest another recipe as this is not adequate.
