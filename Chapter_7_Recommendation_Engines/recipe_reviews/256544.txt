Paleo or Whole30 compliant, if you choose sausage that is compliant, this is a tasty change from the usual breakfast omelet.  Of course, there is no bread or cheese in this, but with the rainbow of colors and flavors, I didn't really miss them.  I only changed the greens, subbing in fresh spinach for the kale, because that is what I had on hand.  I don't believe that changed the outcome of this solid recipe.  I had one serving for breakfast, wrapped up a serving to take to work for lunch, then froze the rest.  We shall see what happens after some time in the freezer.  I like sweet potato, but in this recipe, i willto season adequately to balance the sweet flavor and make it more savory, next time.  Thanks for the idea!

I make this for 12 Servings & it filled to the brim a 9" x 12" dish. It  called for 3 llbs of sausage meat which I used, but if I make it again I will cut this back as I find that 3 llbs is way too much meat. I used a mixture of sweet potato & yams & I used fresh spinach instead of kale. Otherwise I followed the recipie as stated.  While it's tasty I do feel it needs some other seasoning to give it some zip. but a nice change from the bread or hashbrown breakfast dishes.

Quite a little prep, but did taste very good. I made it as a breakfast dish, so tried prepping everything but the eggs, thyme, and water the day before. I also ended up throwing in the kitchen sink, all the veg indicated, plus 1/2 a yellow squash and a bit of fresh broccali. Wasn't sure what size pan to use, so used an 8"x 8". It was pretty full, so took more like 40-45 minutes to bake through. Main part of the dish was in the fridge overnight, so maybe bringing to room temp in the morning might have helped the bake time. It did work fine to most everything the day prior and dump the eggs, water, and thyme over it just prior to baking, though! Will make it again, I'm sure.

Great filling breakfast or lunch.  I added 3 extra eggs the second time because I wanted more protein, and didn’t want it to be dense with ingredients.  Will be part of the breakfast rotation.

I admit that I changed it, but only because I did not have all the ingredients. I did not have a bell pepper, mushrooms, or kale. I used 1 large jalapeno and spinach and omitted the mushrooms. I also used 8 eggs. I served it with avocado slices and salsa. It turned out fantastic. Next time I'll add the mushrooms.

This was an excellent recipe! Just for my own preferences because I’m not doing Whole30 right now, I used milk instead of water and added a small amount of cheese just because I wanted to use some leftover cheese. I used 8 eggs and added spinach too.

I missed the cheese and pie crust, but for what is essentially a paleo quiche, it was very good.  I didn't think it was at all dry.  Used chicken-garlic-red pepper sausage and sliced on a bias after sautéed.  I served with hot sauce and warmed picante for anyone that wanted a bit more flavor, but I ate mine as-is and thought it was very tasty -- not too dry.  The only modification I made was to add 1 extra egg.  This is EASILY a serving for 6 -- I used a medium-size casserole dish and it was perfect.

I was on the hunt for a new breakfast casserole as my old stand-by no longer fits into my new low-carb diet plan. We enjoyed this unusual (for us) combination of flavors. We didn’t have kale on hand, so used fresh baby spinach and, per other reviewers, increased the egg count to 8. I also par-boiled the cubed sweet potato in 1 cup of water until the water evaporated, then sautéed it a couple of minutes in coconut oil (out of olive oil, too). Next time, I want to try the kale and use hot & spicy sausage. I think it’s a keeper!

I use the Allrecipes site frequently but have never written a review. I had to make comments on this one! I doubled the recipe (for a gathering) and followed it as written with one exception; I used baby spinach rather than kale. Outstanding flavor and reviews from the group. If you’re not a sausage fan, like my wife, this would likely be great with ham or bacon! It was great leftover, so it would be a good  make ahead dish to warm up in the morning for overnight guests. Definitely will make again and again!

I added 3 eggs, as suggested by another reviewer. I doubled the onion, added 4 cloves of garlic and skipped the pepper because I love garlic and hate peppers. Substituted thyme with mixed herbs, sausages with sliced hot dog wieners and fresh mushrooms with canned. Smelled good; tasted better.

This  dish came out drier than I had hoped.  Also, If I repeat it, I will add more herbs and spices.  I found it too bland for my taste.

I read the comments... I used spinach for male and I drained the mixture before adding it to the dish. I doubled the egg and halfed the meat....it was perfectly fluffy and not wet at all. It was bland so I added my own "taco theme spices" &  I ate it with guacamole & salsa! Yum! I can't have cheese right now but if you can I'd swap for regular potatoes and OMG it would be amazing (especially with crispy bacon on top).  But as it is on the recipe I don't give it a 5. Wth modification it's going to be used a lot on his diet!

My husband likes it so that makes it a win.  I'm ok with it. A bit too sweet for me.   Next time , when everything is sauteed, I think I'll scramble everything in a cast iron skillet instead of baking it.  I think it will finish fine and a bit quicker.  Might add some jalapeno too.

New to paleo eating. I made this for breakfast and it is great. Substituted spinach for the kale, otherwise I followed the recipe.

I ended up changing a couple things in this recipe:  since I'm vegetarian, I omitted the sausage; used a green pepper instead of red; and used spinach instead of kale (I dislike kale).  I also did not add salt/pepper to the dish but added pepper when I ate it.  I used three cups of fresh spinach, partly because I had omitted the sausage and also because spinach, when cooked, wilts down quite a bit.  The recipe didn't indicate what size pan/bowl to cook this in so I used a metal mixing bowl and greased it.  

I baked it for 25 minutes.  There was a small puddle of liquid on top when I checked it.  I stuck a knife in it and it appeared done in the middle but I decided to let it bake for another 15 minutes to see if the liquid would bake off.  It didn't.   When I spooned some of the dish onto my plate, I was stunned at how much liquid was INSIDE the casserole.  Everything was cooked but there was a lot of liquid.  I know that mushrooms and spinach release liquid when being cooked, but since they were sauteed first, I would think that most of the liquid would have been released then.  

The excess liquid aside, this  simply wasn't good.  I'm almost tempted to throw it away but I am going to attempt to rescue it by draining off the liquid and perhaps warming up leftovers on the stovetop and without a lid on the pan to dry it out somewhat.  I will not be making this again.  Really disappointing.

I made it without the eggs / water, as a breakfast "hash" for Christmas brunch potluck. Otherwise, followed instructions in the recipe. I like onion a bit more cooked, 10-15 min on medium-low. Also, I used Herbes de Provence instead of thyme (I don't think it makes much of a difference), and a mild Italian breakfast sausage. It did not need additional salt.
