You can add chili powder to make it spicier, and more chickpea flour to make it crispier. To avoid the stickiness, just be careful with how much you stir the okra (pre-cooking it in the microwave helps with this)

This turned out really delicious! I used regular flour instead of chickpea flour... I'm sure it's better with chickpea flour but I still really liked it.

This is a great curry recipe.  The flavors are mild yet aromatic.  The okra comes out crispy and full of flavor.  There is a slight (very slight) kick at the end that I'm sure could be dialed up (doesn't need to be dialed back) and tastes great.  This is so much easier to cook than many Indian recipes I find in recipe books.  Nice job and keep submitting more great Indian recipes!

Used cumin powder & wheat germ (instead of chickpea flour) - what I had on hand. Best part - super fast & healthy.

So yummy with rice.  I subbed with ground cumin, and chili powder.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Wonderful with okra fresh from the garden.

The only reason i give it 4 stars vs. 5 stars is the lack of bacon.  Unless, of course, you consider it as a side dish to a plate of bacon. Then it's definitely 5 stars.  But seriously folks, having lived in North Carolina for 8 years before moving to Seattle, if I had only known of this recipe back then I could have found a lot more use for all my neighbors okra!

This was excellent! I'm so excited to have an a new recipe for my garden-grown okra.

Thanks for the tip about microwaving the okra. This dish came out perfectly, and the seasoning was great. (I substituted ground cumin for seed and wheat flour for chickpea flour.)

This was a really good way to use okra from the garden.  I added some ghost pepper to kick up the spice and it was great.

I was lucky to have a small sample and will make this on my own soon! Previously my only recipes for okra were to add it to soup! I'm excited to have a new easy Okra recipe! The taste is slightly spicy and the Okra has a slight crunch- which is great for a side dish or with rice!

need to make it MUCH spicier. we ended up adding hot sauce and soy sauce on when it was finished. i think i like it simply because it is okra and i love okra.

I was not impressed at all with this recipe.  It was bland and sticky.  I don't know what I expected, but I wasn't able to eat this.  Texture is a big thing for me and I found it too slimy for my taste.  I won't make this again.

It was yummy!! I substituted ground cumin, and wheat flour as I had in on hand. I would recommend cutting down on the salt and increasing on the curry powder. Otherwise I followed it exactly and the hubby loves it!

I love okra and this recipe was great because it was different. I used whole wheat flour instead of chickpea. There's so little of it needed, I don't know how it could make a significant difference.

Normally, I don't like okra excepts when it's pickled, but having a surplus of okra in my veggie basket I searched and found this recipe. Great recipe...really tasty. I did add some onion and garlic to it because that's who I am, but I'm pretty sure without them it would have still tasted great.
Also added a dab of sour cream at presentation.
Thank you vburrito for a great recipe. It's a keeper.

This is terrible. Mushy and sticky. The flavor was okay, but the seasoning didn't fully cover the okra because the recipe doesn't use any liquid.
