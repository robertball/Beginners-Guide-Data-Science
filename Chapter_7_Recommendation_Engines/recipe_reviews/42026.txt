Excellent - as a side dish or an appetizer! And what really great is this is so easy, yet it tastes like you spent a lot of time and effort. I used a combination of Parmesan, Romano and mozzarella cheeses to take this over the top. But, no matter what cheese you choose this is bound to be good!

These were great.  I think next time I will try some with Mozz. cheese on top.  Try to use tomatoes that are more firm so they didn't get mushy as they sit.

Cute, easy and delicious, these added color, flavor and interest to our dinner.  Even tastier and easier because I had homemade pesto in the freezer. I probably went a little lighter on the pesto, however, than the recipe directed. Also, since Hubs is not a big fan of Parmesan,  at his request I topped his with mozzarella.

I have made these for years. I do them in the oven or on the gas grill. They are great in the summer with steak.

These were super yummy.  I took the advice of others and added just a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the pesto before adding the parmesan.  The mozzarella helped "bind" everything.  I used vine-ripened small tomatoes and their size was perfect.  A melon-baller made scooping out the tomatoes a snap.  I then let them drain on a paper towel so they wouldn't get mushy.  They took about 15 minutes in the oven - - give or take.  This was a nice compliment to my Father's Day dinner.  Thanks, lovedody!

WE LOVED THESE!!  Scaled this way down to 2 servings last night for dinner!  I just eyeballed the amount of pesto and parmesan.  This is one of my favorite flavor combinations - nothing better than a great tomato with basil and parmesan!  I only baked mine 10 minutes, basically just to warm them through, and then slipped them under the broiler to brown/crisp the parmesan.  We'll definitely be having this again this summer while great tomatoes are available.  Thank you!  10/15/10 UPDATE: Made these again using sun dried tomato pesto, which was equally as wonderful as the basil pesto I used last time!  This time I used a melon baller to scoop out the tomato, which worked very well.

This is tasty, fast & easy.  It adds great color to the plate along with whatever else you are serving.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and found it to be fine as written.  The next time, I sprinkled a small amount of salt & pepper on the tomato before adding the pesto.  I also used mozzarella along with the Parmesan that I freshly ground.  I will make it with this way in the future.

These were awesome!  My picky kids even wanted me to make another batch!  I used Roma tomatoes, jarred pesto (classico) and both mozzarella and parmesan cheese!  The best I have ever had!

Loved the pesto paste, very delicious but after cooking the tomato in the oven made the tomato very watery. It might work better if the tomatos cook in a muffin pan so when being removed the tomato is still in tact.

What a terrific, quick, and flavorful side.  How easy was this!  I placed the tomatoes in a pie pan and had hubby warm them on the grill while steaks were cooking.  Came out perfectly.  Great recipe, lovedody.

This is yummy!  When I cut the tomato in half, I cut it in a zig-zag (just poke a sharp knife in little "v"s all around & pull apart). This makes an attractive side when plated with any meat & vegetable.

Flavor-wise, these were delicious - and a great way to use the abundance of tomatoes and basil we have right now! I must have overcooked the tomato, I left it in for 15 mins and when it came out it was so soft it disintegrated when you cut into it. Or maybe I used a tomato that was too ripe. My boyfriend said he would have preferred the tomato to be sliced thick and baked with a little pesto and mozzarella on top, so I may try that instead next time.

From reading reviews of these I was prepared for them to get mushy if not eaten promptly.. They did get a little mushy, but over all were a big hit at my Christmas party. I served them with some crusty bread. With the few leftovers I cut them up and made grilled cheese and pesto tomato sandwiches. yum!

The flavor was good but these had a sort of weird texture. The tomatoes get a little mushy. I used hummus instead of pesto and that turned out well.

To solve the watery problem add a couple of croutons (store bought or make your own) before adding the pesto and toping with cheese. The croutons will absorb the tomato juices. Try drizzling a bit of balsamic glaze before serving. Now it is like a warm panzanella salad. Get creative, great recipe.

If you scoop out the tomato as directed they will not be as watery.  Remove seeds and seed membrane.

I used vine ripened tomatoes, halved and seeded.  I had them drain on paper towels before filling with pesto, shredded mozzarella/cheddar, and topped with freshly grated Parmesan.  They were baked on a parchment sheet in a 350 oven for about 20 minutes.  Even though I made extra,  all were devoured by our dinner guests!   So easy to put together — I will definitely make again!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I was surprised to see I've never rated it.  This is a perfect recipe for your home-grown tomatoes.  I also used pesto made from fresh basil.  I follow the recipe exactly.

I had some tomatoes that were a bit more firm than usual. They were large size and I just cut off the tops and scooped out the insides with a spoon. This made for just 10 when finished. I added the mozzarella and salt and pepper that others suggested. I used it as a side dish and my guests really liked the flavor.   Even one asked what I used to flavor (store bought pesto) and she said she didn't really care for pesto normally. I only used a teaspoon or so for each tomato. I will make this again, but I would like to figure out what to do with the leftovers. They are very visually unappealing after a while on the table. Maybe throwing it all in a blender with the middles and calling it soup?

Super easy and super tasty. We'll definitely be doing these again. I was concerned about the amount of pesto I was putting in each tomato, but it wasn't overpowering at all.

These are delicious! I used my garden tomatoes, Genoese pesto, and fresh grated Parmesan. The Genoese pesto was the best. You find it in the refrigerated section. I made my own and tried other brands but it was just not the same. Also, the oil in the pesto drips down while baking so I found you don't need to oil the baking dish. After making these as directed once, I decided to use thick slices of the tomato rather than halving them and scooping out the flesh. I like this better.

Great use of our abundant Tomato harvest.  Make sure you have some bread to dip in the left over juicy goodness.  Used Parm on some and Moz on others. Both great.

The first time I had these was at a dinner party. My friend used her homemade pesto sauce. Were they yummy!  Can't wait to serve them at my next dinner party.

These totally would have been 5 stars for flavor, but they were a little hard to eat, not that any of my guests complained.  I did use homemade pesto for a little bit of fresh flavor.

Perfect taste of  summer!  My husband absolutely loved these.  The only pesto I could find was "Classico" and it was unexpectedly delicious.  I also used shaved Parmesan for a nice topping.

This sounded great and easy but in reality it just didn't work for us. Nice presentation though.
