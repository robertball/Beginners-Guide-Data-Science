I thought this was a great vegan key lime pie recipe. Next time I think I will add more lime juice though (maybe even a key lime juice specifically) to give it more of that key like flavor. The avocados whipped up nicely so it really had a mousse texture. I also added shredded coconut on top, which I thought was a nice aesthetic touch. You might need to play with the amount of agave and lime juice, but overall I thought it was good!
