This was a smash hit at a special Father's Day picnic, but I did modify and clarify for myself a bit. I used a half sweet onion and it took a full hour to broil on high, the garlic 45 minutes. When to chop the mushroom was vague. I chopped before broiling and it broiled rapidly, 10-12 minutes was plenty. Once all was blended I added a bit of mayo for smoothness of texture, a bit of lemon juice and a dash of worcestershire. I dislike fennel so I left that out. This sauce looked gorgeous and extra kept well for use with other things. Prepare for rave reviews!

I was only making two servings of this but I made a full recipe of the dressing as I had a feeling it would be versatile & it was. It's really good over pasta too! Although next time, I think I will divide the dressing recipe after preparing it & add a bit more olive oil & maybe some vinegar to one half. The "dressing" is perfect as is for pasta but I think it would coat the lettuce leaves better if it weren't so thick. We used leftover grilled lobster, didn't shred it (it was cut in half lengthwise for visual appeal), garnished it w/ huge slivers of parmesan cheese (they added a lot!)  & served it on the patio w/ a glass of pinot grigio. Great recipe...thansk! Forgot to add that you don't want to chop the mushroom before you roast...I did, according to the directions & they were pretty rubbery. Next time, I will roast, then chop.

The dressing alone is reason to try this recipe.  It makes an impressive & wonderful salad.  I can't wait to try the dressing with a grilled pork tenderloin!!!

I made the dressing for a regular salad and it was way too thick for that.  Then I re-read the recipe and it said to pour dressing around the salad instead of on.  The taste of the dressing was delicious.  I ended up thining this up with some red wine vinegar and tobasco sauce and it still had a wonderful taste.

I invited my mom over for her birthday. I wanted something really different to serve her. I FOUND JUST THE SALAD. This is a wonderful and amazing taste sensation. Its different, its delicious and its beautifully presented. PS Mom and I don't care for mushrooms so I left them out! Thanks for making my mom's bday lunch so special, Dave.

I love fennel seed, but thought the amount here was overkill. I reduced it to 1 tsp and everyone enjoyed the sauce, which I served over pasta. It would also be delicious with Italian sausage over polenta.
