These are the yummiest treats I have ever made! They are very time-consuming to make (probably because I always do a double batch), but they are soooo worth it! I have used sage sausage in place of the regular from time to time and it is really good too. Gives a slightly different flavor. My husband scarfs these up as fast as I can finish frying them.

My girls enjoyed these! I left out the onion and added cream cheese. This makes A LOT so I suggest you make these when you have leftover sausage. I ended up freezing 3/4 of the recipe for breakfast buritos. A dipping sauce goes good with them.

i make these with bacon instead of sausage sometimes and they're great too.  these are a regular with the scrambled eggs for our sunday breakfast.  to save time i usually make the night before and then just fry up in the morning!
