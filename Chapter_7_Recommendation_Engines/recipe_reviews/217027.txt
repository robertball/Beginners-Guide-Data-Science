Saw this recipe yesterday and since I had all the ingredients, I made it up this morning for work.  I make my own jam and had about a cup leftover from last year's bounty.  Well, it never made it to work!  The family chowed down with one person sprinkling powdered sugar over the top of theirs and another dipping in some cream cheese icing we had in the fridge.  Excellent! Followed the recipe exactly and turned out great!

Oh, man, this is dangerous. I used Rhodes dinner rolls which, in my opinion, are the best frozen rolls out there. I opted to add a tiny bit of cream cheese (maybe a scant teaspoon) to the center of each roll with the jam. I also swapped out half of the corn syrup for pure maple syrup, and increased the butter because, well, it was the apocalypse and all. :) Absolutely delicious, and so easy. Thanks, mominml!

My family devoured these right out of the oven! I think it survived maybe 15 minutes and then poof gone! I did have to change some things. I never have the frozen dinner rolls so I used some white yeast bread dough that I made today, it worked perfectly. Also I didn't quite have 1/2 cup of blackberry jam so I ended up using strawberry jam towards the end. It was fine but the blackberry ones were a million times better :) Made the glaze as is and it was fine but next time I think I'll do a vanilla glaze using powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe, wish I had leftovers!

I added a dallop of cream cheese to each dallop of Blackberry Jam and it was wonderful!

yum.  yum.  yum.  This was so easy.  I used Smucker's 3 berry jam and Bridgeford rolls.  I bought dark corn syrup; the sauce is amazing.  These were great.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My wife makes homemade blackberry jam.  Wow, the results were wonderful.  We used Rhodes Rolls.  They were gone so fast, I was hoping for some leftovers.  Next time, I will have to set some aside for later.

I was going to give it only 4 stars. I didn't have any corn syrup, so I used honey instead. I waited for half an hour, and it never absorbed. So, it made quite a mess when I inverted it onto a plate. But it is so good! Quick and easy to make and very delicious.

Oh my gosh.....this was so good.  Disappeared in no time.  I actually used crescent rolls.  This however, will be just a once in great while occasion as it is way too sweet.
