These cookies are SO good.  I like that they have so much fruit and grains in them. The cherries plump up a bit and are tart yet sweet.  A great 'healthy' taste combination!  I just mix everything together in my stand mixer and use a cookie scoop - easy.  Make sure you grease the cookie sheet if not using parchment.  They can get a little dry the next day, but they're  usually gone by then.

These are so good.  I used dried cranberries instead of dried cherries.

These had a good flavor, but were more like a breakfast health cookie. If you choose to substitute flax meal (as many sites say that it is okay in place of wheat germ), you might want to use less. It makes the cookie pretty dry! I used cranberries instead of cherries, too.

These are delicious and everyone ate them up.  They wanted to make the recipe for themselves.  Recommendation: place 2 sugars at top of jar as the best way to mix cookie dough is sugar and butter, then add egg, other liquid, and then dry ingredients.  Also with wheat germ you must keep jar in fridge, so advise giftee to take jar out of fridge in advance of fixing, room temp is best for getting sugar out of the top, etc.

Pretty mixture!  Next time, I will see that the recipe says to mix in a liter jar!  A quart jar is too small, so the giftee gets the quart jar and the extra flour mixture!

I thought these were pretty good -the texture is more cake-y than chewy.  My husband and son both liked these.  I was out of wheat germ so I upped the quantity of oats to 1 1/2 cups and it seemed to work well.
