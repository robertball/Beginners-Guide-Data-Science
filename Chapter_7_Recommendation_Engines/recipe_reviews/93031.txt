I made this cranberry sauce, but did not have any apple cider, so improvised a little and used a little red wine instead.  It was the surprise hit of our Thanksgiving get together!

I loved this sauce!  I didn't need that much sauce, so I halved the recipe but it definately dissapeared quickly! The cloves were a bit strong, but I was looking for a spicey sauce so it it did nicely. If your not a fan of cloves, I would cut the amount in half.

My first time making cranberry sauce.  Had I known it was this easy to make I would have done this decades ago.  Much better than store bought and I would have rated it a 5 star but I'm not real crazy about cloves and to me a little less on the cloves or no cloves would have been better.

This is THE best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted!  I just made it for the 4th time and tried to change it up a bit with some dried apricots...we'll see how that turns out!

I love the cranberry sauce on brie, on salmon and especially turkey sandwiches.

Thank you Hazel!!

Very good flavor, and about as easy to make as a box of macaroni and cheese!  I cut the recipe in, since I didn't really need enough to last until Spring...just enough to last until Thanksgiving!  Also, I let mine cool and put it into a freezer container instead.

Took this to dinner party, and the girls really liked it.  I just cut down a little on the cloves and allspice.  Delicious on turkey sandwiches.  A keeper.

Amazing!  I've never, ever, enjoyed cranberry sauce with my turkey, but now I don't think I want to eat turkey without it!  I was a little concerned about the amount of allspice, but went with it anyways, and was so glad I did!  I added some thawed, frozen dark cherries.  Next time I may hold back a little of the sugar, but then again, maybe not.  Thanks for a new favorite!!

I have made this for the second time, and it keeps getting better. I only had apple juice on hand this time, which sufficed fine. I really suggest using all seasonings to taste. For me, the recipe calls for way to much all spice, so I cut way back.

I served this cranberry sauce along side my Thanksgiving turkey. Let me tell you, it was delicious! The tart/sweetness of the sauce was a great compliment to the meat. I imagine this would be yummy on pork as well. FYI-I was out of allspice so I substituted cinnamon.

This recipe really represents the holidays for me. Its spice and warmth compliments any meal! I have tried many other cranberry sauces to my father and fianc√©s dismay but always seem to come back to this one. I use apple juice instead of cider and I never seem to have cloves in my pantry so I usually just use cinnamon and it turns out fantastic every time. Great recipe!

This was too fancy.  It just tasted like everything else at Thanksgiving with the spices.  I thought I would love it, but opted for the regular cranberries-sugar-water version for this year after making this last year.

Like everyone I thought this was very easy and my family loved it. The nutritional benefits are also worth the little bit of extra time. I will never buy the canned stuff again. Oh and I also used cinnamon.

I've been making this cranberry sauce for years, and it's a huge hit every year. Several of my friends and family now also make this cranberry sauce for their holidays, too. I do back off the cloves just a tiny bit, but that's only because my MIL requested it. Otherwise, it's perfect!

I have been making this recipe every thanksgiving for the past 5 years and it's a hit every time! It's very easy.. I would just suggest making it the day before you need it ready... It's best when chilled over night.

This recipe is a huge hit for Thanksgiving. It makes a lot of cranberry sauce, so I would either cut the recipe in half, or even better, freeze some to be used for Christmas or in other recipes. I like my cranberry sauce a little more tart, so I only used 1 cup of sugar. Instead, I added a 1/2 cup or orange juice and zest from one orange. Yum!
