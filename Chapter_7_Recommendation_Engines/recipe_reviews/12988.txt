This soup is awesome.  I did as others suggested and added additional potatoes, cut back on the milk so it was a bit creamier, and I also left out the salt since there were so many other salt ingredients.

Awesome and unique soup!! Very simple to make! I ommitted the sage (none available), reduced the amount of thyme by half and only used 3 1/2cups of milk (which was all I thought was neccessary to keep the soup at the consistency that we enjoy). Very flavorful and "high-class." Next time, I may use 1-2 more potatoes and perhaps even the addition of a 1/2c celery while sauting the onions. Excellent soup and would go great as a first course entree' to any meal!! Thanks Kristin for sharing this recipe!!

The flavors of the soup were very rich and sharp. You could really taste the parmesam, and the bacon added a nice smokey flavor to the soup. I halved the butter in this recipe, and ended up just caramelizing the onions, since I think the flavor is a little better if you can get them nice and brown. I also stopped adding milk at 4 cups, because it was a pretty thin soup by that time and I wanted it to retain some thickness. Overall, a very easy and tasty soup to make; quick to prepare and eat.

You weren't kidding!  This was the best potato soup ever! I added garlic, didn't add all the salts, doubled up on the basil, used buttermilk and cut the amount in half.  Also, I cooked the onions in the bacon drippings.  Boy was it good!

Delicious!!.  I used only 2 14.5oz cans of chicken broth (not the 4.5 cups called for) and 1 to 2 cups of milk. I wanted it thick.  I also added about a tablespoon of granulated garlic to the spice mix.  Thanks for a great recipe.  The family loved it.

Served this on a cool summer evening and we all loved it, even my picky son.  Wish I would have read reviews ahead of time because I agree with others that it could use a couple more potatoes and a cup or two less milk.  Because there are so many salty ingredients in this recipe, I used no-salt butter to saut√© the onions and low salt bacon and chicken broth.  I then changed the celery salt to celery seed and the onion salt to onion powder.  I also cut back on the sage because I am not a huge fan.  We thought it tasted perfect.  Served with salad and warm rolls, along with fruit and had a great supper.  Thanks, Kristin!!

This was so delicious! The only thing I did differently was to omit the sage, up the amount of Parmesan, and I also added a splash of heavy cream. So good with warm crusty bread on a chilly day. Thanks, Kristin!

This soup was delicious! All the flavors; the onion, bacon, potato and parmesan compliment eachother very well. Its very easy to make, but the result is definitely restaurant quality. I used less milk and didn't have all the spices on hand but the soup turned out great anyways.

Love this recipe! Like all truly great soups, it is easy and forgiving. I took the suggestion of many reviewers and used more potatoes than called for. I used 7 medium potatoes. I sauteed chopped veggies (celery, carrot, and minced garlic) in the oil. I didn't add sage at all but used the other suggested spices. Once the potatoes were added into the soup, I used my potato masher to gently break up some of my potato cubes into smaller pieces. This also thickened my soup. It made a lot...about 8 to 10 hearty servings. it is rich and flavorful and my teenage boys and husband loved it...they all ate a double serving. Great recipe.

Like some of the others, I carmelized the onions in the bacon grease which gave them a good flavor. I did 6 potatoes instead of only 4 since we like a chunkier soup.  I also added celery instead of celery salt.  I only added 4 cups of milks instead of the 6.  We wanted a thicker soup and 6 cups would have made it too thin. I also used cheddar instead of parmesan.  This soup had an excellent flavor and I will definitely be making it again!

Followed the recipe exactly - sage over powered the taste, couldn't taste the cheese.  Way too much trouble for the poor taste.  Definitely wouldn't make again.

This soup was wonderful... We had some left over and very few potatoes were left in it.  I added some frozen hash browns to this and it was even better a few days later.

Good flavors in this soup. I cut the broth and milk in half and used butter instead of margarine.  I added bay leaf (remove before serving) and dill weed. Used only 6 slices bacon. Eliminated the celery salt and seasoning salt.

Too watery. Not flavorful enough. Called for 10 cups milk - only added 3. Bacon was a nice touch.

Love it!Love it!Love it! This recipe is awesome just the way it is.  However, I did do a few things different. Instead of using margarine, I sauteed onions, garlic, portabello mushrooms in the bacon grease.  I also didn't bother with boiling my potatoes in a separate pot.  I just added them to the sauteed veggies added my spices and chicken broth. Then followed the recipe from there.  Also, if you want a little kick fresh green chili is awesome!Thank you for the recipe!

I made this soup with a few changes.  I used 6 good-sized red-skinned potatoes instead of 4 as several reviewers said there weren't enough potatoes.  I added a couple ribs of celery, sliced, shortly before adding the cheese.  I like my celery  hot but still crunchy.  The celery added a nice bit of color & a little more nutrition without substantially changing the basic recipe.  The big change that I made was eliminating the chicken broth & using the potato cooking water instead.  This makes the soup much more economical & there is a tremendous amount of potato flavor in the cooking water as well as lots of nutrition.  In other potato soup recipes that I've tried I couldn't really taste the broth with all the seasonings, cheese & bacon or ham but it always seemed like something was missing.  I found the missing ingredient when I made those recipes again using the potato water instead of broth.  The soup was much better...true comfort food.  I'd give the recipe 4 stars as written or 5 with my changes.  This soup would probably be really good with ham & Cheddar cheese substituted for the bacon & Parmesan.  I intend to find out.  Thanks for the great recipe, Kristin.  It's the best tater soup I ever tasted!  I will be making this soup often. :-)

Didn't have all the "salts." As others suggested, I put in more potatoes & only 1/2 the milk. Good, but next time, double the spices.

SO good!!! I added a couple more potatoes, as well as 2 cloves of garlic saut√©ed with the onions in the bacon drippings. I only used 4 thickcut bacon slices as well. And I also cut the milk down to 4-5 cups. It had such a great flavor. I served it with some garlic Parmesan bread and the family devoured it, thank you!

This was very yummy. I did not use the full amount of bacon. I only used six pieces. I thought it had plenty of bacon flavor with that amount. I would make this again.

Great soup. Added garlic with onions and added some bacon drippings to the sauting of the  onions and garlic with margarine. I used celery seeds instead of celery salt and cut the milk to 2 cups. My husband said it tasted like the potato soup he had in germany

This was disappointing.  I expected a potato soup, instead it was a thickened seasoned gravy with very few potatoes, despite the fact that I increased the amount of potatoes and significantly decreased the amount of milk.  It was not good at all.  I usually try to salvage recipes, but this was a waste of ingredients.

This was tasty. I made it with extra potatoes and less milk, as suggested. I also substituted other things for the salt items, as suggested.

This was VERY popular around my table!  Everyone had seconds.  The parmesan cheese adds a nice snap to the normal taste - I'll prepare this one again.  Thanks!

Really pleased & my family loved it. I did cut back to 4 cups of chicken broth & 3 cups of milk & it was the perfect consistency for us. Next time I will add a couple more potatoes since I like mine chunky. Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe...SO yummy. The one change I do make is I use half and half - it gives it a richer, creamier flavor.

I thought this soup was fantastic.  The Parmesan gave it an extra bit that you usually don't get in other potato soup recipes.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star was because the bacon in the soup didn't re-heat well.  It became soggy and chewy for leftovers.

Great soup and easy to make.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed it.  Even my picky eaters.  :)  I used all of the suggested ingredients except the salts and made a few small changes.  I added 2 more potatoes, only 6 teaspoons of the butter and used 1/4 a stalk of celery and only 4 cups of the milk.  Since I was short on time I bought ready to eat crumbled peppered "real bacon" and it tasted great.  I could take this to any pot luck and it would be a crowd pleaser.

I gave this 5 stars after I customized it.  I used 3 pounds of red potatoes chopped with the skin on, 3/4 cup of flour, added a clove of garlic, reduced the butter to 1/8 cup, reduced the milk to 3 cups and used nonfat, added 1 cup of brocolli and added 1 cup of light sour cream.  After all was combined, I blended it with my immersion blender.  Then topped with fresh chopped chives.

The boyfriend made this for our family the other night. He used a few different kinds of cheese instead of just the parmesan. It was awesome! For sure a keeper.

Very good soup...I reduced the milk by almost two cups and added a couple of extra potatoes.  Despite these changes, the soup was still too thin for my liking so I boiled another couple of potatoes, pureed them and then added them to the soup.  I got just the right consistency!

This is such a great potato soup recipe, but it does take time to make! After making it once exactly as the directions read, I made some changes.  I like very flavorful things, so I add extra amounts of the seasonings, minus the sage.  I also add carrots. I prefer a thicker soup, so I also add extra flour. Overall, this recipe was easy to follow for an inexperienced soup maker!

The combination of spices really give this soup a restaurant quality flavor. I (at the suggestion of other reviewers)also added additional potatoes. My only complaint was that it was a little too salty for my taste, next time I will cut down on the salt spices. Otherwise the soup is a HIT.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I've made this a few times now and I never have leftovers!  Even the three pickiest eaters ate it and had seconds to boot!  We get together with friends to watch football on Sundays and they always ask for this one.  Thanks Kristin!

A huge hit with the menfolk in my world.  Easy to make.   I tossed a couple of cups of frozen peas in near the end so we'd have a green veggie to go with the meat and potatoes.   A very hearty soup!

This soup is very yummy. I add carrots and celery and saute them in the butter with the onion. I like the extra veggies instead of just potato and onion. I also cut down on the milk by a little bit, use a 2-3 extra potatoes and use turkey bacon instead of pork (we just prefer it). Highly recommended recipe!

I had no bacon and used Italian Sausage instead.     It went well with the Basil and other seasonings.      I used WAY LESS MILK!    Maybe just one cup.     I like a thick and hearty soup.    It was very good.

For some reason it didn't have much flavor so I almost doubled the seasonings. I used cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. Maybe that had something to do with it? Next time I will use less milk. Other than that it was WONDERFUL!

Recipe makes a very, very thin soup.  Use less milk (as much as you prefer) and maybe a bit more flour to thicken it up.  As is, it was like potato-bacon-water...

I make soup quite often and I think this is the best soup I have ever made.  The "herby" flavours were just awesome.  I only used 4 cups each of milk and home made chicken broth.  My only regret is inviting my daughter to dinner because now there are no leftovers.  This is definately a keeper.

This soup was absolutely amazing!  I love a really good potato soup, and this was totally out of this world.  The boyfriend loved it too!  I did make a few changes though:  didn't have seasoning salt, onion or celery salt - instead used celery seed and sea salt (just adjust the amount of salt to your liking); used about 2 tbsp's of butter insted of the 1/2 cup.  Also I found you only needed about 3 cups of milk, and even then it was a bit too runny for my liking so I mixed up some flour and water to help thicken it.  I only had 3 slices of bacon on hand, so I cooked them up to crispy and put them in, with a small amount of Hormel Real bacon bits I also had on hand.
Oh! I also added a whole grated carrot and 2 chopped up pieces of celery to the onion for flavour and colour.  I added one chopped green onion also at the end to the soup.  I will DEFINATELY make this again!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!

Absolutely excellent soup, I served it at luncheon and received rave reviews and requests for recipe.
I did alter the ingredients a bit.
I used 6 small white potatoes, peeled and diced then boiled.
3 cans Swanson chicken broth, 1 qt half & Half.
Sauteed 2 large bunches chopped green onions in butter, then made a roux with the flour mixed with seasonings, then added broth, potatoes and simmered for 20 minutes, then added half & half.

Excellent flavor.  I added some shredded colby-jack cheese.  My dad said not to lose this recipe.  It's a keeper.

I didn't add celery salt or sage because I didn't have them, but the mixture of flavors in this soup is excellent! I used turkey bacon because I never buy the real stuff.  I'm sure it would have had more flavor but I was trying to make this a little lighter.  It was still jam packed with flavor.  Thanks!

Easy to make, and very good! A godsend for a college student, too. I cut out all the salt, however, since the chicken broth I used was already salty enough by itself.

WOW! Loved it, and for those of you out there cooking for one-- it freezes GREAT. I have sent it to most of my family as well. The only thing I did differently was mash the potatoes a little, but I think that is a texture preference for me. So good for a cold night!

This is sooooooo yummy!! My son who is a picky eater had 3 bowls last night and 2 bowls for breakfast! i did however put my bacon on the top of each bowl (i don't like sawgy bacon! And i also used more than the recommended amount of potatoes, i used 7 and that seems to be perfect! The first time 4 just wasn't enough. i also used the parmesan blend of cheese instead of just parmesan! This is deffinitely a keeper!! yummy!!:)Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Great soup!  I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to add a little spice. I also used red potatos and added about 3 cloves of minced garlic in while they boiled away.  Lastly, I just dumped the entire container of cheese in too (about 1 3/4 cups). Yummy!  Next time I might add browned, ground sausage to the mix.

Thank you for the recipe!

FANTASTIC!!!  What a great twist on an old favorite.  I didn't make many changes except instead of 6 cups of milk (cause I didn't have it)I used 3 cups of evaporated milk and 3 cups of half & half.  I also used 1/2 of the bacon (used pepper bacon) the recipe called for (and would rather sprinkle on top as a garnish than mix in).  I also used fresh grated parmesan (not the canned stuff).  If your using canned I don't think you'll get much of what this soup has to offer.  My soup wasn't THAT thick, but it wasn't thin either, but once refridgerated (if you have leftovers), it got really thick.
This one is definitely a keeper and will make many times this winter.

This was ok.  I think too much milk diluted the flavors or something (and I only put in 5 cups).  I used 5 TBS of butter instead of 1/2 cup, and 4 cups of broth.  I like my soups thicker, so after I added the milk I let it come to a simmer so it would thicken.  Hopefully the leftovers are better.  It was a little troublesome to make too, with boiling the potatoes separtately and all.  I think if they were cooked in the broth it would have been a lot better.  Plus, I could hardly taste the parmesan- kind of made me sad that it used so much!

this was pretty good.  I added chopped garlic and broccoli and used oregano in place of basil since I was out.  6 slices of bacon was enough; 12 would've been overkill.  I only used 3 1/4 cups of milk but the next day it was too thick so next time I'd use about 4 1/2 cups.  Also, it needed more salt.

This was very good I am not going to make potato soup any other way again.  Don't make the same mistake I did and think that the bacon wouldn't make a diffrence It would have been 300 times better if I just had some bacon.

This was a good soup--nicely seasoned, with a strong parmesan flavor.  The sage provides a nice aftertaste.  My husband, who proclaims not to care for sage, kept asking what that good herb flavor was.  He was surprised to find that it was the sage.

So very yummy! Definitely do again! I had no problem with the sage, although I didn't add as much as the recipe called for. And I used butter and whole milk to keep it creamy. Even my husband liked it and he doesn't do soup.

Hmm.  This soup is okay.  I modified things a bit; added regular celery, cooked the potatoes in the broth instead of boiling separately, and I added less milk than called for.  Bf said it was good but not as good as others I've made.  I can't quite put my finger on what we aren't sure about, but I appreciate the recipe.  Thanks!

My family loved this soup served with crusty bread on a cold snowy night.  The only change I made was to use 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of milk for a thicker soup.  It was delicious!  Oh- and I also did the potatoes in the microwave (4 russets), let them cool and peeled and chopped them.

This was really good!! I followed the directions exactly.  However, next time I will mash the potatoes a little bit, add some cheddar cheese, and top each bowl with green onions.  This makes alot, so we had yummy leftovers for a few day.s

It was good for a cold night, but it didn't have too much flavor.

Had a good taste to it. I used 4 cups of milk and it was still to runny for my taste. I also used 6 potatoes instead of 4. Probably will not make again.

I didn't think the directions were very clear, so I wish I had done a few things different.  Next time I will peel the potatoes and slightly mash them after boiling. I would add more parmesan (I only had 1/2 cup) because I loved the flavor it added, and I would add some bacon earlier on for the flavor it imparts.  I added about 4 cups of milk, which was plenty, as other reviewers suggested.  I didn't think it was too salty as written, like some reviewers thought.  I kind of thought it tasted flour-y, so I tweaked the spices some more at the end.  Will make again.

Do not make this recipe as written.  I used half the amount of milk called for and it was still too runny. I ended up adding an entire 5lb bag of (small size) potatos. Also, the bacon becomes soggy and yuck if you have leftovers for later.  

It tasted pretty good inspite of all of this. Not sure if I will make it again though.  (I didn't use the sage btw)

You guys aren't kidding! This is really delicious soup! I added chopped celery and garlic to the onions and only used 3 cups of milk. Such a gourmet tasting soup!

This was so good, but I made modifications.  Didn't have all the spices, so I used celery seed and onion powder, and added some sea salt to make up for the celery salt and onion salt.  The sage added a nice flavor to the parmesan cheese.  I used six smallish potatoes, and used the cooking water and added bouillon.  I used a cup of heavy cream and a cup of half and half instead of the milk.  Served with crumbled bacon and roasted garlic bread.  While not wonderful for the waistline, yummy!

LOVED IT!  Only recipe I could find for Parmesan soup.  I didn't add the bacon and I added double the cheese.  Very creamy and yummy.  My son wanted it for lunch and dinner!

I really enjoyed this -- the parmesan is less overpowering than traditional cheddar. I used five medium potatoes and two cups of milk, and I added peas.

This soup was great. I did leave out most of the butter and all of the flour. I cooked the potatoes with the onion and spices and then added the broth. I added half of the milk and when potatos were done I pureed the soup with a hand blender and that made it creamy. My kids loved it. Thanks

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  My family had a fit when they learned I was trying a new potato soup recipe, but mine was always missing something.  They all agree this one is much better.  We will defenitely make it again.  Thanks!

We made this on Christmas and all our guests loved it.  We did reduce the amount of milk we added to approximately 3/4 of what it called for. I would recommend highly!

This was a great rainy day dinner.  I would definitely increase the number of potatoes with the liquid amounts listed.  Next time, I think I'll decrease the milk as suggested by another review.  I also omitted the salts since I was using boullion for the broth and I substituted 1/2 tsp. of poultry seasoning for the sage and thyme.  I think I'll use the first stage, prior to adding cheese and milk as a basis for chicken pot pie!

I have rarely followed a recipe when making potato soup but thought I would try this one based on the addition of parmesan cheese & spices. I thought it was just OK and will make my own version next time. My daughter loved it, but my Mom & husband prefer my version. It honestly reminded me of the taste of dressing, probably because of the chicken broth & sage. Still, it was fun to try. Thanks for sharing, Kristin.

This is a very tasty soup. I would allow more than 15 minutes prep time unless you chop at a professional chef's speed! I also added less milk to make a thicker soup. I had the recipe halved and the new measurements were fine.

My family loved this soup!  Dd has a dairy allergy so I left out the milk.  The consistency was still creamy and delicious.  I also added more potatoes and sauteed carrots & celery too in a safe margarine.  Also omitted the thyme.  I am going to use this as a chicken pot pie base later in the week b/c I couldn't find one that would work w/the allergies.  THANKS!!

Sorry but this was just too weird.  The spices way overpower the soup and left a weird taste.  Maybe leave out the sage and thyme, or use much less.

Thanks to others, used more potatoes, a little less milk and wanted to add the sage but I just didn't have any available. In general, I love potato soups but by the end of winter, I'm so tired of the american cheese based potato soups. This brings a whole new level of diversity to your average potato soup! Thanks for sharing it.

Outstanding recipe!  I was out of sage but that would only make it better.  Next time I think I'll add 1 or 2 more potatoes but it was excellent.
