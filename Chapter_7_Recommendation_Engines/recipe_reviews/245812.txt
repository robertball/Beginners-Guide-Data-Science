My Mom always made these at Christmas time but I never asked her for the recipe and had no idea where she got it from, had never seen a written copy (like some of her recipes written by hand in the back of an old Five Roses cookbook) She called them Frying Pan Cookies. When I was growing up they weren't my favourite because I didn't like dates, but now I guess my tastes have changed, because I was missing them along with my Mom at Christmas time and so glad I found this. Just made them and they brought back so many good memories of Christmases past.

Very good!  It takes a bit of work, but if you have the ingredients measured out ahead of time, that makes it easier.
