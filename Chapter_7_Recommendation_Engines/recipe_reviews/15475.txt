EXCELLENT!  All my friends ask for this recipe.  I make large batches, make the cookie balls, flash freeze them and store them in a zip loc bag to bake a few at a time at a later date.

O.K.!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
There are still more cookies left to bake but I couldn't wait to tell everyone how awesome these really are!!!!!!!! At first I thought they were so thick and cake-like but as they cooled they flatened down. Resulting in a perfect light & crispy cookie with a very moist and chewy inside.Absolutely awesome!! I will never use another recipe again!!

This is just the sort of cookie I dislike so much; very similar to Nestle Toll House Cookies - flatter, sweeter and greasier than I prefer. Hubs will love 'em.  As far as I'm concerned, however, these suffer from too much sugar, not enough flour, or both.  A generous three stars for my rating, only because I know Hubs' rating would be higher than mine.

If there was a definition of chocolate chip cookie in the dictionary, a picture of "Stephen's Chocolate Chip Cookies" would be beside it. My search for the perfect chocolate chip cookie began and ended with this recipe!!!  These are ideal...slightly crispy around the edges and wonderfully chewy in the centre.  I used cold butter when making these, and had no problems with them being too flat.  A truly gourmet cookie is not "puffy" anyway.  As for cookies sticking to the baking sheet, might I suggest parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Also do as indicated in the recipe and allow cookies to cool for the specified time on the baking sheet.  One more thing, I found these were the best when cooked between 8-9 minutes.  Wendy, these are restaurant quality cookies, and my family says a big THANK YOU!!!

***UPDATE:  I'd sort of forgotten about this recipe in my quest for trying out other choc chip cookie recipes, but I have to say, this one still heads my list.  I think I'll stop the search. :-) Made them with semi-sweet chips (my fave!) and all three kinds of nuts.  SO good and buttery-flavorful!  They're not made with shortening (a plus; no transfats) & they hold up well after they've cooled down.  Thanks again, Wendy!
Jan 26, 2004: Of the chocolate chip cookie recipes I've tried so far on this website, this one is my fave.  They have buttery-crisp edges, and that is the way I like them.  I only used one kind of chip (milk chocolate for DSD's sake), and one kind of nut (pecans); but the cookie itself is of the texture that I like.  They're addicting!  Thanks, Wendy.

This is the perfect cookie!  Anyone who rated this less than a five must have done something wrong.  I have tried cookie recipe after cookie recipe, and this one is by far the best.  I don't understand how some have said that its too flat, it came out EXACTLY how a cookie is supposed to come out.  If you want something fluffy, bake a cake.  Your school has served you well, my friend, many many thanks.

This is cookie perfection, in my opinion. The recipe is VERY beginner friendly (which is important for me and my limited skills!)The perfect balance of fluffy and chewy, and that sweet vanilla flavor that so many are apprehensive about? That's what I Love so much about these. They smell like a fudge shop on Mackinac Island on a cool Autumn afternoon. I read in another review to omit baking powder to make them less cakey-textured, so I did that. And I had to omit all nuts because I have a very picky fiance, but there will be time to add nuts as I will be making these for the rest of my life.

My husband's favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe is one that I have been making for years from King Arthur Flour (it is no longer on their website, or I would direct you there).  Anyway, everytime I make a different chocolate chip cookie my husband will say "it's good, but it's not as good as my favorite".  I made this recipe, using King Arthur organic whole wheat white flour, all three chips, and pecans only.  "Oh, no, these are as good as my favorites and now I won't know which to ask for!" cried hubby.  That makes these crispy cookies one darn good cookie!

My husband's name is Stephen so I just had to bake these! We omitted all nuts and used only 1 cup of morsels. I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1/2 cup of butter brought to room temperature. As such, this recipe rated a 5. If we had made them according to recipe, more gourmet, I might have had to petition for 10 stars! These did spread out and become rather thin - which we like. They were crunchy onthe outside and chewy on the inside. They taste heavenly; somewhat similar taste to Toll House, that means comfort food to me! These were easy to make and smelled wonderfully baking, thanks Wendy for sharing with us. Yum!

I had a hard time choosing from this recipe or the Big Fat Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe (I like my cookies chewy and big) but this one sounded better so I made this BUT I used a 1/4 cup sized "drop" (I also only used semi-sweet chocolate chips).

LOVED these!  Even using the large drop it made 2 dozen cookies.

Very easy to follow, and the flavor of this cookie is divine. I didn't like how lightly colored they turned out. I prefer a toasted golden brown color. Since I was trying to achieve this my cookies got too crispy. But they were still a hit!

I don't like nuts so I just went with 2 cups of chocolate chips. If you want puffy cookies go make a cake, if you want absolutely delicious chocolate chip cookies that stay soft after they've cooled, then make these! If you don't give this recipe 5 stars then you're doing it wrong.

This is a very nice cookie. Crispy around the edges and soft on the inside. I took advice from other reviewers and decreased the white sugar by 1/3 cup and omitted the white chocolate chips...which resulted in a not-overly-sweet cookie. It was just right for us. I didn't have any almonds or walnuts on hand so just substituted those with pecans. I baked them for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees, and the recipe created 46 2.5" - 3" cookies. Thanks for a fun cookie recipe!

HOLY COW!!!! This recipe makes a ton of cookies! I followed the recipe exact, only doubling up on the pecans and omitting the almonds only because my husband dosen't like almonds. I did chill the dough for about an hour before beginning to bake them and halfway through, I put the remaining dough in the fridge. This is an incredibly sweet cookie, but we thought this was one of the best cookies we've ever had. I did have to add an extra half cup of flour because my dough seemed to be a little wetter than I would have liked and if I hadn't, the dough would have spread terribly. If it wasn't for that, I would have given it all five stars, plus some. Next time I make these, I'll make sure I have a playdate or friends I'm visiting so I can make the whole amount and gift half. These are addictive little puppies. NOTE: I did not add the baking powder because I did not want a cakier cookie.

Didn't change a thing and came out with big, fat, chunky cookies that had an awesome flavor. I used a 1/4c measuring cup to measure the dough into equal portions. I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect. Thank you for sharing!!

This is the perfect chocolate chip cookie in my book, absolutely perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use only the nuts and chocolate chips I had on hand (pecans, walnuts, semi-sweet chips). I made these for my husband hoping I wouldn't like them (I am trying to watch my calories) since I don't like nuts, but unfortunately one little taste was all it took.

Sorry, but these didn't give me the soft, chewy cookie I was expecting. Also the flavor was off. Not enough vanilla, to my taste. More chocolate and flavoring would have made a world of difference.

These are pretty killer cookies.  I used white chips, dark (60%) chips, macadamia and pecans.  They are sweet, but people - they're cookies not bread.  They're supposed to be sweet.  It's a keeper, that's for sure.

Awesome cookie! This recipe is now my "go to" when I want a perfect chocolate chip cookie. I did not add nuts or different kinds of chips, just one bag of milk chocolate chips. They are delicious!

I have been looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that is crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. This recipe is hands down the best I have ever tasted. My husband kept coming back to get more and he is usually very picky about desserts. I plan on making these for my niece and nephew out of state. But if there are people out there rating this less than five stars needs to learn about the true art of baking!

These were awesome cookies!  I loved the consistency.  I will definitely make the again.  Honestly, I just made them last week and they were gone so fast that I plan to make them again today.  The baking powder seemed to make them fluffy at first.  Then the cooling process helped them settle down making them nice and chewy.  All of the different chips and nuts made every bite taste a little different than the last.  Thanks for sharing!  This was a really creative cookie recipe.

These were so good. I made one batch with chocolate chips and walnuts for the hubby (he doesn't like to try anything new) and made the other batch exactly as the recipe states. The only exception was I used only milk and while chocolate chips since I don't care for dark chocolate. These were awesome and I noticed the hubby took some of my cookies with him to work this morning.

this was a GREAT cookie. I wish I had all the different chocolates/nuts but I only had semisweet chips & chopped walnuts. I love how they turned out, they cooked perfectly. I halved the recipe to bake 1 full cookie sheet worth, and then flash freeze another batch for baking another day. It was the perfect amount :) thanks!

Great recipe!  I cannot stop eating them.
I only had white chocolate chips on hand so I used the whole bag.  I also added a bag of the Skor Bar bits as I wanted to use them up.  Fantastic!

These are good cookies.  I wouldn't say they necessarily deserve the overly hyped up reviews - they're a fairly basic-tasting chocolate chip cookie - but they do taste good and are worth repeating.

Awesome cookies!!! My husband said these were the best ones i've ever made. I used milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, pecans & macadamia nuts. Thanks Wendy!  Update: The 1st time I made these I used stick butter. The 2nd time I made these I used bowl butter. They were still good but a different consistency. Definitely one to experiment w/ & make to your own liking.

These are good although I think they are a bit to sweet. My oldest son is a chocolate chip cookie snob & he said "Mom, how much sugar did you put in these?!" DH liked them though!

DELICIOUS!  This is my new chocolate chip cookie recipe!  I used a bag of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of toasted pecans, since that is what I had on hand.  I took the cookies out of the oven at 12 minutes, which is when they were just turning brown on the edges, and still looked wet in the middle.  They continued cooking for a couple minutes out of the oven, and then moved them to the cooling rack, as the recipe stated.  Crisp on the edges, soft and chewy in the middle- Perfect!

I don't usually like chocolate chip cookies that flatten out, but WOW. These cookies are amazing. I only changed the mix of chips and nuts to match up with what I had in the pantry.

Fabulous cookie recipe!  Crisp on the edges and slightly chewy/gooey in the middle.  Instead of three types of nuts & chips, I only used two. Semi-sweet chocolate & peanut butter chips with walnuts and pecans.  They are food-gasmic.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  These were great!  I've been making chocolate chip cookies for ... well, let's just say a very long time.  I always use to use the Nestle Toll House cookie recipe.  Stephen's recipe definitely out-shines the Toll House recipe.  I didn't have any almonds on hand so I substituted macadamian nuts.  My daughter and her family loved them.  My 6-yr. old grandson said that he wants me to make these cookies every time now.  Thanks Stephen.

I added two tablespoons of Cocoa powder to the recipe because my family is made up of chocolate freaks.  I thought they were great.. but I didnt try them without it yet so I have nothing to compare it to. Anyone tried them both ways?

I tried these cookies over the weekend.  I started out making them as drop cookies - then realized I wasn't going to have enough time to make the whole batch into cookies, so I made them into pan cookies.  I liked the pan cookie version much better.  As a drop cookie, I found these were too sweet and rich, but for some reason, I did not find that when I made these as pan cookies - everyone ate them up.  These were good, but I just don't think I'll make them again - nothing that unusual.

With two children under the age of 2 I don't usually take the time to make homemade cookies. But occasionally my husband and I get a craving for the read deal. I made these cookies last night and we loved them! Like many others, I subsituted with some of my own add-ins; milk chocolate chips, milk chocolate/carmel swirl chips, and peanut butter chips. I didn't have any nuts so I used coconut and oatmeal. The cookie was so buttery crisp on the outside and so chewy on the inside. I didn't have any problem with them coming out flat and I even made them really big! I plan on using this recipe time and time again and I will continue trying different add-ins! Thanks!

These cookies are great, not that easy to make because of the extra time it takes to chop the nuts.  But it's worth the effort.  I even chop extra nuts so that I can make these wonderful cookies anytime the mood strikes. Every time I have made them they have disappear very fast.

YUM! I am so glad that I followed this recipe EXACTLY. I was tempted to change it due to some of the bad reviews. I don't see why people thought these were flat. Mine turned out just like a cookie should. Yes, they are sweet, but not overly so. I didn't pack my brown sugar, because the recipe didn't say to. I also stirred the flour into the butter / sugar mixture (this is how I read the recipe), rather than using mixer at this step. I don't know if mixing would have produced a flatter cookie?! Also, I put the dough in the fridge between cooking and cooked for 9 min. which seemed perfect. I also let them cool on cookie sheet about 9 min. before transfering to cooking rack. Lastly, I didn't soften butter as long as I usually do when a recipe calls for softened butter. Mine was pretty chilled. I just had to mix a little more to get it creamed with the sugar. SOOOOO.... I have no idea if any of this might have made the difference in the final result of the cookie, but this was a perfect chocolate chip cookie in my eyes (and in my tummy)! Like others, I usually am underwhelmed with chocolate chip cookie recipes, and keep trying to find one I like, THIS IS IT!!

I liked these cookies and made them exactly as written.  I think the batter could use a bit more flavor though...a dash of cinnamon maybe?  Despite refrigerating the cookie dough, they still flattened out more than I wanted them to, therefore, I watched them carefully to avoid burning them.  I would probably make them again with a few changes to "spice" them up a bit.

Wonderful cookie. I had to add and extra 1/4 cup flour or so. I was able to 1st, double the recipe, then half the recipe easily..half with nuts and half without for those in our home with nut allergies. Tons of cookies.

Great recipe.  Omitted all of the nuts because didn't have any.  Look forward to trying with the nuts.  Used milk and white chocolate chips.  Used 3 eggs because mix was very dry with just 2 (maybe eggs too small).  Cooked for 13 min.  Excellent!

I don't like nuts in cookies, so instead, I chopped up a 100gr Cadbury Dairy Milk bar and added that to the chocolate chips.  These were the best cookies my family and I have ever eaten! Thanks!

Finally a cookies that doesn't fall flat! I have been having trouble with my cookies being too buttery and cooking flat. I added 1 cup dark chocolate and 1 cup semisweet chips and 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 chopped walnuts. What a great combinations. Thanks!

These cookies can be described as one word: Fabulous!  I'm usually not big on nuts being in my desserts, but they work just perfectly in these cookies.  Everything I altered was done only because I lacked a few ingredients, but even without the almonds and semisweet morsels these cookies were a hit!  My fiance kept talking about how good they were and he just couldn't keep his hands out of them!  I'm planning to make some more tonight when my future in-laws come over for dinner. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Well I need another chocolate chip cookie recipe like I need a hole in my head!  But this sounded interesting so I gave it a try.  I made it exactly as written (it was such a sweet tribute to the author's Dad - I wanted to make it just the way she created it for him)  The texture was absolutely perfect!  I thought it would be too many nuts but the ratio is still the same so they were great.  Also I don't even like white chocolate chips but I enjoyed them in combo with everything else.  Thanks for sharing this :-)

These cookies sound awesome just as is! However, I choose to use just chopped almonds & white chocolate chips. Literally MOUTHWATERING COOKIES! One of these days I'll try it with the variety of chocolate & nuts. I love almonds & chocolate like nothing else in the world. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I'll use it years.

Wendy, this recipe makes the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever eaten!  Many thanks to you for sharing this recipe; it deserves much more than just five stars!  I didn't have walnuts in the house, so I toasted sliced almonds and chopped pecans to add to the recipe.  I also used just the white chocolate chips and Ghiradelli 60% Bittersweet Baking Chips because I didn't have milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips in the house.  In addition, I added one 7 ounce bag of coconut to the dough...OUTSTANDING!  This recipe is a "must try", it is amazingly good.

I will never make a different kind of cookie ever again. Beware that these cookies are kryptonite if you're trying to watch what you eat because once you start you can't stop! They are so soft and wonderful the three different kinds of chips make these cookies unique and so delectable. Instead of using the different nuts the recipe calls for I used macademia nuts instead, just a personal preference. I don't see how this recipe can go wrong though. I got so so so many rave reviews for them and people saying "you HAVE to get me that recipe, those cookies were amazing!" I made them for a party and a little 8 year old boy stood by the table and ate half of them and would yell every once in awhile and say "These cookies are SO GOOD!" They are loved by people of all ages. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! I don't think I will ever make a different cookie recipe again, this is the one!

I'm not a fan of flat cookies. I like them chunky, thick, and well-formed. But the taste reviews were so great for these that I had to try them. Well, after reading the other reviews and putting all the "tweaks" together, I have to admit that this is an awesome cookie! For those of you that are interested, here is what I did--no flatties here!
1. Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening,
2. reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup,
3. added 1/2 cup finely processed rolled oats,
4. omitted baking soda altogether,
5. increased vanilla to 2tsp (just cuz I love vanilla :) )
   I used milk chocolate, semi-sweet, and butterscotch chips; walnuts, pecans, and macadamias (just personal preference) and reduced amounts to 1/3cup each for chips, and 1/4cup each for nuts since I used only half the dough for these. To the rest of the dough I added chopped maraschino cherries, white chips, and macadamias.  I chilled the dough thoroughly then rolled into balls and baked on parchment paper. No sticking, no flat cookies...just beautiful, chunky, heavenly tasting gems! Even better after a day or two. Thanks for a great recipe to work from!

Wow! These were such a big hit in my house. Instead of adding almonds I added coconut to half of the batch and they were awesome!I think this will now be our new favorite chocolate chip cookie. I've made these a couple more times since my first review. Real butter is a must. We love these.

I think these cookies are perfect.  If you like your cookies soft, chewy and buttery- these are the cookies for you.  They are definitely not puffy.  I followed the recipe exactly except used almond extract because I was out of vanilla, cut up chocolate toffee bars and added pecans.  I brought them to a football party and people seemed to really love them.  One girl said they were the best cookies she's ever tasted.~~ Made them again and this time I wanted them just a bit less flat so I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 egg.  They were absolutely perfect.

Loved the flavor of these! I might add a little more flour next time because I had to chill my dough to keep it from spreading too much. I like the little bit of puffiness the baking powder adds. I used all semi-sweet chips and only pecans. Good keeper recipe!

Def a great cookie. All the flavors were wonderful. I did leave out the nuts in half the batch for taste preference for the happy recipients.  The only thing I did change was that it was so hot and humid when I made these that I added a cup of quick oats that I blended into powder and added in with the flour.  My choc chips tend to turn into pancakes when it is so hot and this trick makes for perfect cookies.  Do try!

if you can get past eating the cookie dough and actually put some in the oven they turn out perfect, fantastic recipe. although i didn't have all the ingredients, i only had walnuts & hazlenuts in the cupboard so they went in as well as dried cranberries to make up the measurements.  Not sure what semisweet chocolate chips are so just added more of the other variety. family loved them!

I wasn't as jazzed about this recipe as others have been.  I think my butter was too soft because the cookies spread out quite a bit.  The big problem, though, was that these were just too sweet for me with the milk chocolate and white chocolate chips.

Very, very good cookie... a nice change of pace from the standard choc. chip cookie.  I love the 3 kinds of nuts and 3 kinds of chips.  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup and made giant cookies.  Yummy!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe EXACTLY (except for the nuts -- I only added a cup of almonds) and they came out AWESOME!!!!  I thought I had found the perfect cookie recipe. BUT now, I'm not sure what I must be doing wrong, followed the recipe exactly again the last 2 times, but the cookies come out so flat that you can actually see thru some of them.  I'm perplexed. Anyone have any thoughts?? (I bake them at 325 in a convection oven, on parchment paper.)  Thanks!!

So, if you're like me and have difficulty producing perfect chewy chocolate chip cookies, follow this recipe and struggle no more! They came out nice and golden, and chewy- not doughy. I don't like much choc. in mine, so I just threw in a handful of semi-sw. chips, and handful of walnuts. I also sub. 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla. ( I do this with every recipe.) I did cook my cookies for 14 minutes, but when I dropped the dough they were roughly the size of golf balls, so maybe that's why it took longer. I like bigger cookies, especially when they come out like this!!!!! Thank you SO much for inventing such a masterpiece of a recipe. A++

Great Recipe!  I agree that they came out crispy on outside and soft inside...even when we left them in an extra 3 minutes (whoops...).  We used only 1 type of choc chips and walnuts only as that's all we had in the house but they turned out good regardless.  Thanki You Wendy!

Halved this recipe since it's just for the two of us, used only milk chocolate chips and no nuts (not a fan of nuts myself, though next time my husband is voting for at least walnuts ^_^). Cooked at 350 for 12 minutes as my cookies spread out and became absolutely HUGE. Which is fine, but did surprise me.
These are delicious! Other reviewers are right--crispy edges, soft in the middle. Yum! I thought the amount of sugar was just right and I don't usually care for sweet things. I will definitely be making these again as I usually fail miserably at making chocolate chip cookies.

My Husband and I both agree that these taste like Entemann's choc-chip cookies, which are the best cookies. I think these taste even better. I baked these using margerine and a semi-sweet chocolate baking bar that I chopped into chunks (I don't like nuts in my cookies). My husband invited a couple of his friends over to watch the football game and they polished them off. I baked one tray for 10min, and one for 9min. Next time I will bake them for 8min. The less cooked ones came out better.

These cookies tasted good, but were very flat due to the baking soda and it says to use an ungreased baking sheet. I greased mine just a tad because there is no vegetable oil in this recipe and they still stuck to the pan. Fell apart when I tried to pull them off.

It is so hard to find the perfect cookie recipe. They always come out either too flat and fall apart or too cakey. These are PERFECT! Due to ingredients on hand I used all semisweet chocolate chips and chopped cashew nuts (same amounts as listed). My family and I love them, thank you so much for this great recipe!

I made these with semi-sweet chocolate chips only.  For whatever reason, they didn't taste as well as I hoped. All I could taste was the pure vanilla extract (at least I think). Anyway, they were quite bitter. Not as sweet as I'd like.

This makes an EXCELLENT cookie dough. My husband and I have been on the search for the perfect choc. chip receipe for dough (we just eat it out of the bowl)and we found it! We also save some of the dough for cookies, and they are divine. It's the only receipe we use now!

So, half my family likes nutes & the other half doesn't.  I don't know what posessed me to make these one day but, I did and the whole family ate and loved these cookies.  I didn't have the white chocolate chips but, I made everything else as written and we will make these often. We still love our favorite recipe but, this one has quickly risen above all others and some of the family now says this is their favorite.  Thank you!

Like most, I have been making choc chip cookies for decades and this is the best!  I am not a big nut fan, but these are still perfect as is.  The baking powder and baking soda give these great texture!  Love these as written, no changes necessary!

These were great - although I think I will make them into balls and freeze them to bake as needed. They seemed to flatten out more than I like, but my family didn't seem to care - it was just me. Love the dark and milk chocolate together - along with the different nuts. More like a gourmet chocolate chip cookie.

These are delicious.  I followed the recipe except I left out white chocolate chips and only used pecans (just doubled them) because I didn't have the other nuts or white chips.

Bf was at these cookies before I'd even mixed in the chocolate chips and nuts. He told me the dough looked good and proceeded to taste it.  I didn't have white chocolate or milk chocolate chips, so I just put in about a cup or so of semi sweet chocolate chips and added some craisins to the dough as well.  These are good cookies and bake up longer than stated, at least for my oven.  I put them in for 12 minutes but they were still gooey after cooling, so I jacked the time up to 14 minutes.  A little crispier that way, but still an excellent cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!  I have a feeling the bf will be asking for these again.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie I've EVER eaten.  All I can say is...WOW!!!  I am not a fan of walnuts, so I substituted macadamia nuts instead.  (Maybe that's what made mine so awesome?)  Anyway, thanks for the fantastic recipe - it will replace my standard tollhouse cookie recipe, hands down!

The 1st batch got great reviews and I thought they were pretty good (although I don't really like chocolate chip cookies) -- however I made a couple of modifications. I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 t salt; increased the amount of *coarsely* chopped nuts to about 1/2 cup each; chopped the white chocolate chips so that they weren't as prominent (to avoid the "Oh, are these *white* chocolate cookies?" question) and I used a small cookie scoop instead of "heaping spoonfuls" -- which, of course, changed the cooking time to about 8-9 minutes. Yummmmmmmmm.

I don't know what I did wrong, but mine turned out nothing like the pictures.  I didn't add the nuts b/c my dd hates nuts, but they were as flat as pancakes & crispy.  I was hoping for a hearty cookie & this didn't even get close.

I've searched for quite awhile, for a good old-fashioned chocolate chip recipe, but I think I have met my goal with these!  I just made a batch (froze the rest of the dough in a log), and I had to make them without the nuts...since I'm taking them to work and have a lot of picky colleagues..LOL.  But they are WONDERFUL.  I love the way they look, and the texture is perfect.  It gives a little tiny crisp at first bite, with a soft and chewy center.  I halved the white sugar, and I baked at 325 for 10 minutes (I think my oven is hyperactive and reads higher than it is set to).. but next time, I will lessen the sugars even more..and add all the nuts!  Thank you, Wendy!  Your talent has made a lot of happy cookie eaters. :-)

I liked the use of walnuts, pecans and almonds in this recipe. The cookie looked good but tasted ordinary. My favorite is still the Best, Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie from this site.  Thanks for the post.

These cookies are so good.  I followed the recipe, adding all of the chips and nuts.  I used one cup of whole wheat pastry flour and baked for exactly 9 minutes.  They were a perfect texture for me.  I don't like plain chocolate chip cookies so these are a good alternative.  My kids (and myself) couldn't stay out of them!

These are awesome, definitely a keeper! But I have to say as is they would be too sweet for us. I used 3/4 C. sugar, 3/4 C. brown sugar, 1/3 C. chips for each chips and up the nuts to 1/2 C. for each of the nuts. Now that is some good cookie! :) Thanks for posting the recipe :)

This was good, but it didn't really taste any different from any other cookie.  I used walnut chips, but it probably would've been better with walnut pieces instead.  Maybe a dash of cinnamon would do this well too.  The texture is ok.  Mine didn't stay chewy the next day.  They softened up, but that didn't affect the taste any.

I think I'll stick with the recipe I use on the back of chocolate chip packages.  I used slightly less sugar and omitted the white chocolate chips, so maybe that was a mistake!

That must be some cooking school!

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, hands down.  I have made so many over the years and they are always flat and/or cakelike.  These were perfect.  My husband said they're better than Mrs. Field's.  I replaced the almonds with hazelnuts and used 1 cup milk choc chips and 1 cup semi-sweet (no white chocolate) just for personal preference.

This was a fabulous recipe!  I love chocolate and nuts so what a great one to try!  My only suggestion would be to add more nuts lol!  And maybe a tad more semi-sweet morsels.  Even my DH loved them and he isn't a huge nut eater!  Definitely a keeper!

A perfect cookie base! I only used one kind of chips, and tossed in some oatmeal instead of nuts. The base of this cookie is so great, you can add whatever fixins' you like and still have it work out. Delicious!

My cookies came out really good, but I made some alterations to the recipe because I like my cookies to be puffy.  I used melted butter and put the mixture into the refrigerator for a few hours prior to baking.  The result was perfect, puffy cookies that my family devoured.

These are the best cookies ever, hands down. I'm not a white chocolate fan however, so I just add more milk and dark chocolate. I did not have a problem with thin cookies - I rolled them in balls bf putting them on the sheet so maybe that helped add thickness?

This is a good cookie, but not "THE ULTIMATE" in my opinion. Even though I'd read the reviews that stated these cookies came out flat, I was surprised at just how flat they were. If you like a thicker cookie, you may want to substitute 1/2 the butter for butter flavored Crisco. The taste is good and a change from run-of-the-mill chocolate chippers, just not the best I've ever had.

great recipe. would advise to roll dough into balls slightly larger than a golf ball, and not to pack it too firmly. bake for 15 mins at 375F for a perfectly browned cookie, with a chewy center.

What a perfect, buttery chocolate chip cookie! I've tried many versions--some with oats or shortening--and they're good. But this one is so flavorful. Chocolate chip cookies are not all created equal. My husband's eyes popped when he took a bite. I even tried--and liked--the other recipe on this site that had tons more ratings but this recipe is the creme de la creme!

Like other reviewers, I enjoyed the flavor of this cookie.  It has the taste of an expensive, gourmet cookie.  Prior to making this cookie, I read other reviews and noted that this cookie seems to be too flat for some reviewers.  So, I made sure to use butter (not margarine).  I creamed the butter and sugars thoroughly.  I beat the eggs in completely and thoroughly.  I mixed the baking powder, baking soda and salt thoroughly into the flour before adding it to the cookie mixture.  After taking all these precautions, I, too, ended up with a cookie that was too flat for my taste.  The cookie is fine...however, I like my chocolate chip cookies a little thicker.  Perhaps adding a little more flour (1/4 to 1/2 cup) might help?  I would also recommend that the cookie sheets be sprayed with Pam.  I removed them from the sheets as soon as they were firm enough but not before they cooled thoroughly.  They wanted to stick to the sheets even when still warm.  Despite these minor objections, this is a great tasting cookie.

These cookies were absolutely fantastic!  They had a moist texture and such a gourmet flavor.  I found the recipe very easy to make.  My family appreciates chocolate chip cookies.  You made them very happy!  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I hope the San Francisco Culinary Academy gave you an award for creating one of the most best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.

These were delicious!  They were gone in a day.. everyone loved them!  They did come out sort of flat and it does take some time to chop the nuts. But its worth it!

OMG THESE COOKIES R DA BOMB! me and my neighbor made them and they are a chewy, delicious, and melt-in-ur-mouth kind of cookie! Once we took them out of the oven a few minutes later we tried one. They were SO GOOD! They were soft and taste heavenly. 
The changes we made were only add the semi sweet chocolate chips, (2/3 cup) add dark chocolate chips to the recipe, (2/3 cup) and did not add the nuts, white and milk chocolate chips. We are going to give these to our friends and we know they will LOVE THEM!!!!!!1!!!!  
Thank you so much Stephen for this amazing recipe!!

This was my first time making homemade cookies and they turned out excellent.  I omitted the different types of chocolate chips & just went with the semi-sweet chocolate chips and crushed walnuts.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

Very good cookie! Made up in a snap. First run on dark cookie sheets got a bit over done. Lowered temp a tad and switched to my lighter pans and they came out beautifully!

I've made this recipe a number of times without modification (except that some batches are with or without nuts). Every single time I get consistent results and great compliments! Easy and delicious, with just enough about them to be a bit unique. My husband is a baking professional and even he gives these a thumbs up! A definite "keeper" in my book!

Good recipe. I didn't use all the different chips and nuts this time. I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and pecans. They turned out great. I did bake for 11 mins in a 350 degree oven. Ten minutes just wasn't enough and 12 was too much, oddly one more minute made the difference.

I didn't pack the flour.  The cookie was too flat.  It needs to be cooled to get it off the pan without it breaking.  More flour is needed.  Start by making a couple of sample cookies.  If it turns out too flat, then add more flour to get the consistency/texture you want.  It calls for more choc. chips than I like, which also makes it more difficult to scrape off the pan.

pretty darn good!  I substituted half of the butter with applesauce and added a little soy flour for protein.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and they still turned out beautifully!  They are also easy to make.  I got 32 cookies instead of the 48 the recipe says.

I've tried many recipes in the past and this is currently my fav chocolate chip cookie recipe! Great buttery-flavor cookie. Crispy around the edges and soft on the inside. I substitute all the chocolate chips/nuts for 1 kind - dark chocolate chip. Baked at 10mins makes the perfect cookie - soft & chewy.

Dangerously delicious! What a decadent, rich little cookie! My DH and I both thought these are definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies we've ever tasted. Nice tender cookie, a little chewy on the edges. These would be great for those Christmas cookie gift platters. I didn't chop the almond, I just used slivered ones. I used real butter to make these. Melt in your mouth delicious! I got 5 dozen cookies from this. (Note to self: Hubby prefers his cc cookies plain without nuts of any kind...) but he sure ate the heck outta these babies! Thanks Wendy for sharing these with us, they're a keeper.

These cookies are simply excellent.  They're also a great basic recipes to play with: take out the nuts, use organic wheat flour, use butterscotch chips, etc.  Great recipe and I, and my co-workers, thank you.

These were great right out of the oven, but they got really hard as they cooled. Think I will try more brown and less white sugar next time.

Good. I've used this recipe several times now. The first time I only had semisweet chips, hazelnuts & pecans. I've also used other combinations of chips & nuts, I liked the macadamias the best. This is a good recipe for kids, each can choose a different ingredient (chips or nuts).

The cookies are in the oven & my first batch received 2 thumbs up from my 3 kids. They say they'd give it a "gazillion" stars & that they're the best cookies I've ever made. Very impressive! I love them - very sweet, great texture. I had to leave out the nuts, but they are great just the same. Another reviewer said the cookies taste like gourmet - I totally agree. Thank you, Wendy, for sharing such a great recipe...an interesting take on chocolate chip cookies! It's a keeper!

These are by far the best cookies I have made.  They were crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  The texture was just right and I liked them flat.  Would definately make again and again.  This is my new goto chocolate chip cookie recipe.

GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!  I've been searching for the ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I think I've found it!  Love all the nuts!  I consider myself a cookie dough connoisseur, and the dough is out of this world!  I'm lucky I had enough dough to make any cookies at all!  I made giant cookies and they cooked for about 14 minutes on an airbake cookie sheet.  Will be making many more times and will play with the chip/nut combinations.

The first batch isn't even out of the oven and i'm already writing to tell you that the raw dough is just amazing! My friends ate about half of it already, I had to fight them off just to make sure I could get 2 of the 4 dozen cookies it was suppose to make! The only thing I added to the base was milk chocolate caramel swirl chips, comes out great! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This is the perfect chewy cookie base. I made several batches. Some as stated in recipe, some w/out all the nuts (using only pecans) & some w/ white chocolate chips, chopped-up maraschino cherries & macadamia nuts. All were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten. And my family agreed w/ me!

This cookies are the best! I've made them light (with splenda BFB, light margarine, egg whites, you just have to flatten them a bit right when they come out of the oven, otherwise they come out cakey), i've made them with only macadamia nuts and white chocolate, and when i'm running out of ingredients i make them only chocolate chips... this is the only cookie recipe of this kind i've tried and i wouldn't try any other.... here in Mexico baking this kind of cookies is not something very common, so everyone loves when i bake this homemade cookies... I just love them ^_^

I only had choc. chips and walnuts to add to these cookies but they were still fantastic, chewy and moist. I think the mix would make a great base for a christmas cookies with pecans, white chocolate chips and cranberries or next time I might just put raisins and walnuts in and use a maple flavouring. Great recipe.

First batch was measured to cook like recommended amount size but didn't cook very well all the way through so made the rest smaller which cooked much better.  I thought too sweet with all that sugar and chocolate chips maybe next time will try not to add as much sugar nor chocolate chips.

Great cookies.  Mine weren't all that flat and crispy but were basically like regular-looking chocolate chip cookies.

Was looking for a "new" choc chip cookie recipe and decided to try this one. My reaction is "wonderful" Easy to put together and bake and results are superb. Used mixture of almonds, pecans and macadamia nuts and Callebaut chocolate chips. Wouldn't change a thing. Perhaps I used a smaller measure, but I ended up with 5 1/2 dozen terrific cookies! Had to keep my husband from eating them before they cooled.

I rated these cookies a 3 star because that's what I would rate the nestle tollhouse cookies.  Except for the baking powder, chips and nuts, the recipe is exactly that which is on the back of a bag of nestle chocolate chips.  I prefer cakelike cookies and these are more crunchy flat but with an abundance of melted chocolate.

This recipe DESERVES TEN STARS! Stop looking for cookie recipes - this is the ultimate!  I replaced milk and white chips with all dark, and I added extra pecans and walnuts because I left out the almonds.  The dough seemed too runny, but the cookies baked perfectly!  There is nothing flat about them.  If you follow the recipe exactly, you will also rate it five stars.

I love this cookie BUT it is a bit thin.  The best way to fix it is to use Brownulated brown sugar if you can find it.  But when I can't and I want them not so thin, I cut the butter & sugars to 3/4c each, use half butter flavored shortening and half butter, REMOVE the baking powder and increase vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp.  You may have to adjust the amt of "stir ins," I just throw in handfuls.  Then they essentially are toll-house like. Please try these either way!!!!!

I have always considered my chocolate cookies to be the best, but not anymore.  Stephen has done a great job of developing a recipe for and old fave, with a new twist.  I had to freeze the dough because I kept eating them for myself.  They are supposed to be for gifts.

I am pretty picky about chocolate chip cookies.  Do not hesitate to make this perfect recipe.  They taste really buttery and I agree with the other reviewer about the slightly crispy edges and soft middle.  Maybe it's just a taste preference but I don't mind my cookies not being puffy, that starts to taste too much like a scone.  I used hazelnuts instead of almonds.  Yea!  I found the ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe..thanks Wendy.

This has to be one of the best cookie recipes I have tried and I have tried many.  I cooked the cookies at 350 for 8 minutes and they came out perfect.  I also was able to buy pre-chopped nuts at the grocery store so it was quick to make.  This recipe is absolutely the best.

I’ve been using this recipe for over 8 years! It’s hands down the best cookie recipe. I use the basic recipe and add whatever I want. One year it was dried fruit and walnuts. Last time it was semi sweet chocolate chip and roasted salted pecans.

Probably the most delicious cookie I've had in a long time. I am so happy that it didn't come out cakey or bready. These are perfectly crisp and with a nice soft crunch.
When I went to cook them, I added a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips rather than adding in nuts or white chocolate...It came out divine. I hope to add nuts to it when I make it in the future! I recommend this to anyone and everyone.

These cookies were SO good. I added 2 cups of  flour and half a cup of cocoa powder to make double chocolate chip cookies because I couldn't find a super good one, but they were SO good either way.

I like that this recipe doesn’t make such a dry dough.  I was able to add my own additives (1 oz. crushed Lays potato chips, 1/2 c grape nuts, 2 Khalua, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ancho chili powder)

I use this recipe as my basic cookie recipe and then do add ins with whatever I happen to have in my pantry rather than all of the different chips and nuts listed in the recipe. I always receive awesome feedback on these cookies.

These turned out  way too flat and crispy.  Judging from the picture posted I thought they'd be soft and at least a little chewy.  They were a tad too sweet as well and for what I paid for all the ingredients I am very disappointed.  They're not too bad and I can always dunk them in coffee. I only gave one star to balance out all the wild five star reviews.

I've made these cookies several times without changing the recipe. Everyone that has eaten them can't stop! This is a great recipe. Recently, I added coconut flakes and the cookies just got better. Thanks for sharing this. I'm glad your Dad sent you to cookie baking school!

I loved them. Probably just a bit sweet for my taste, and a bit crispy, but overall delicious. Oh also, our batch made 60 cookies.

My whole family LOVES these cookies!! I’ve made so many chocolate chip, M&M, Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, and so many more cookies with this recipe! The cookie is so yummy and it doesn’t take too long to make. I also like this recipe because you can add whatever you want into it! It’s not like a Snickerdoodle where the only thing good in it is cinnamon.  You can add M&M’s, oatmeal, chocolate chips, Reese’s Pieces, and more. The only change I made was I altered the cooking time from 10-12 minutes to 15 minutes. Absolutely amazing cookies.

I loved making these cookies because my family wanted some and I’m technically  the baker of the family and so I wanted to make some and found these and they turned out great! I was having some trouble with mixing but in the end they were so delicious and yummy. I definitely recommend this recipe to all bakers and people who are into making treats, I watched the cookies bake and they baked so easily I was astonished. They were soft and gooey when I bit into them. All bakers and family’s would love these and I would definitely make them again. Whoever made these, you are an amazing baker and I encourage you to make more recipes like this. I am glad I made these cookies and my family loved them as much as I did! I hope everybody who reads this comment agrees.

Delicious. I made it with only semisweet chocolate chips (2 cups) and 1 cup of walnuts instead of all the different types of nuts. It was delicious and I love it. 10/10 would recommend.

I prefer these over most of the cookie recipes on here, although like the other ones I found them to be too sweet so I used 1C brown sugar and only 1/2 of white sugar. That made them near perfect. They are thinner cookies and spread quite a bit, so space them well!

Best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've tried! Delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I left out the nuts because of allergies. I just used semisweet chocolate chips because that's all I had on hand. Cookies were crisp on the outside and chewy inside. Perfect!

SOOO GOOOODD. I've made these cookies a lot of times and i loved them. My family always asks me to make them when guests come over. I would really recommend to wait 12 minutes stick a toothpick  in one of the cookies. If little crumb-like bits appear on the toothpick and the toothpick is hot and soft (just a little before it fully bakes), take it out and don't take the cookies off of the pan to let them bake outside the oven. After 5-7 minutes, take them off and let them cool. Trust me,  if you do this you will get a soft, chewy cookie.

They weren't as amazing as I would've thought since the reviews were so good. They were good but like every chocolate chip cookie recipe with just butter, they flatten out and are a bit greasy. Substituting half the butter for shortening will keep their shape and improve the flavor.

This recipe was a little greasy. Maybe I'll put a little less butter in the mix. I will make these again.

This recipe is so good! I've been trying to find the perfect recipe and this is it! These are very similar to nestle toll house cookies. I didn't add any nuts bc I don't like them and I just used milk and semi sweet chocolate chips. I baked at 375 on convection for 10 mins. Perfect!

So delicious! We used all one type of chocolate chip, and sliced almonds. The sliced almonds added the perfect kind of crunch! We shared with many others, and everyone loved them!

I made a few "tweaks" because this is the closest recipe to one I use to know. I melt the butter. I only use dark and milk chocolate chips and walnuts. I mix the flour, baking soda and powder together in one bowl, eggs, add melted butter, and vanilla mix with blender, both sugars and mix with blender again. I then quarter the flour mixture and fold in with a rubber spatula. Finally add the chips and nuts and bake! This makes them even more moist!!!

This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe!  I made the original recipe with no changes the first time and they were delicious.  I have since tweaked it a bit, to suit our family's tastes!  I use semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips, and then only walnuts and almonds for the nuts.  I use the original, total amount of each, just divided between the two flavors of each.  DIVINE!!!  They are very easy to make and it's not very long before you are eating a warm, homemade chocolate chip cookie.

These cookies are fabulous!! 

I'm not a person who normally eats cookies, but I had one of these after I baked them and they are marvelous. My husband doesn't like nuts in his chocolate chip cookies, so I didn't use them. I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used salted caramel, semi sweet and white chocolate. I don't think this is a recipe that could turn out badly, as long as base directions are followed. I hated to write what I did differently, but Allrecipes asks you to include this in your reviews. 

Thumbs up! I'll make these again (I'll be sure to have the right chips next time).

Tasted great, however, nearly  impossible  to get off the sheet, even after I tried greasing it. Resulted in broken crumbled cookies, which is fine for eating but not for gift giving etc. 
More of a chewy, hard cookie than appears in the picture. Yummy though! The recipe makes way too many so I recommend halving it unless you really want 48 cookies...I'm freezing half mine.

Excellent!  I used only dark chocolate and chopped almonds, but the recipe worked out perfectly and tasted great.  I'm sure you can make it a variety of ways.  Since it's only my father and me, I'm going to shape and freeze part of the recipe and I'll let you know how it worked.

These are delicious!  I used a different combination of chips (semi-sweet, butterscotch, and white) and didn't have all the nuts, but the basic recipe comes out wonderful.  These will be on my Holiday trays this year.

I followed the recipe until the chips and nuts came in. Instead of all that chocolate, I used a cup and a half of dark chocolate, 1/3 cup of cranberries and 1/3 of crushed walnuts. Not too sweet, just right. My wife said it was not too sweet. Even my wife liked it. Feel free to try it.

I made a half batch, and it's a good thing, because I can barely keep from eating all of them. 3 "changes": 1, I used extra vanilla. 2, I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips. 3, I also had only almonds, so no walnuts or pecans. STILL DELICIOUS. Only comment: be very careful to not overbake. Other than that, foolproof!

The cookies taste great. Leave out the baking powder as it makes them cakey. not crisp (I tried both ways). Also, reduce white sugar to about 1/4C - that's enough. 
But can anyome tell me how to keep the dough from sticking to my tbsp-sized ice cream scoop?

I only used semisweet chips and walnuts.  Tasted pretty good, although nothing too special.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.
I found the overall cookie flat and unappetising, it has way to much sugar and with the addition of the chocolate chips it was just to much.I found the cooking time off. I baked teaspoonfuls of dough for 14 minutes and it was still uncooked inside, I raised the tempreture by about 10-15 degrees, tried another batch and they were cooked but the kids each ate one and the rest are on a plate untouched. Thanks but will have to continue looking.

Mmmmmm... this is my 3rd try at home made cookies and it was GREAT.  They came out perfect.  I was afraid they'd come out flat like some others mentioned but they didn't.  I use stoneware for baking so I don't know if that helped.  I also omitted the white chips and instead used butterscotch with chocolate chips and chopped pecans.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  THanks so much for sharing!!!

Well, they're tasty, but they are nothing out of this world. I was looking for a cookie with some volume; these came out flat like all the rest of the cookies i've made in the past. Could it be me??? Or my pans??? Either way, they are very good and my household is very happy to have any cookies at all. Next time I will try a recipie what will give me thicker cookies....thanx anyways

The best chocolate chip recipe I have tried! I left out the nuts (my preference) and used milk, butterscotch and white chocolate chips. Yummy!

I have a few choc chip recipes I really love, but there is something special about this one, too!  The base tastes really great, in fact I used less chips to taste the cookie dough.  I had to add about 1/2 cup of flour for high altitude to keep them from being totally flat.  I will make this again!

Very easy to put together and delicious.  I baked them exactly as stated, but you also can't go wrong in substituting your own favorite nuts and chocolates.

This is the way chocolate chip cookies were meant to be!  I just used milk and semi-sweet Ghiardelli chips and walnuts.  They are fantastic!

This was a good recipe, nice and chewy. The melted chocolate made it very gourmet-like and my boyfriend was crazy about it! However, I expected it to be a lot better considering the great reviews it got. Surprisingly, unlike most others, mine didn't turn out flat at all, rather, it was the perfect cookie shape, but this was probably because i refrigerated the dough right up till the moment it had to go into the oven. My only suggestion would be to reduce the sugar as it was a little too sweet to really savour the combination of flavours. Anyone should give it a go and try to adapt the recipe to their own taste. Enjoy making it!!!

p/s: does anyone know how to modify this to make it crisp rather than chewy?

I am on a quest for The Best Chocolate Chip recipe and I loved this one!! I did not have baking powder so I added 1 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla and they came out perfect. I want to thank Stephen's dad for sending Stephen to Culinary school.  Please keep sending in recipes!!

this is truly the best chocolate chip cookie I've baked in a long time. I used only dark chocolate chips and it turned out very well. I increased the nutes to add to twice the amount and it came out very well, not too nutty. Thank you.

The cookies taste great but they turned out flat. I was thinking maybe less baking powder and the white chocolate chips were no good. Maybe adding more milk chocolate and semisweet would be better.
