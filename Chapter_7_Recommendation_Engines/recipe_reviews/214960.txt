I am the author of this recipe and just wanted to note that I use whatever oil I have on hand and I also don't blanch the peas- I like the snap.  I wanted to remain true to the original recipe given to me when I submitted it, but thought it was worth mentioning the above.  Enjoy!

This is a five-star recipe for me!  I could inhale the dressing!  I can hardly wait for my family to try this one!  Now I'm sorry I cut the recipe in half!  I was glad to see that the author of the recipe doesn't blanch the peas because I would not have, either.  I forgot to get the parsley, so that wasn't included in my version, and I did get a little heavy handed on the onions, garlic, and almonds.  My sister, who sends me the wild rice from Wisconsin, will love this recipe!  Thank you very much!  EDIT:  I tasted this several hours into refrigeration, and I think what happened is that the rice soaked up all the lovely dressing.  So I made more and added it just before serving it.  And now I even have a bit of that left over for another purpose!  Yum!

very yummy. I didn't have wild rice, but used black rice instead since it has a nice nutty and sweet flavor. made the rest as is and would love to make again.

The rice base and dressing is really tasty. Tried it with a little less oil and mushrooms, as I had no snap peas, but did everything else according to the proposed recipe. Room for play; will try this with shrimp, aspargus, dill, broccoli. Thanks!

I used white wine vinegar since I didn't have tarragon vinegar, used raw snap peas and added some sliced red grapes which were a very tasty addition to the flavors.  Very versatile recipe.  Everyone loved this at Christmas 2011 as a side salad.

Excellent and very flavorful.  Only gave it four stars because I modified the recipe.  I substituted the Tarragon vinegar w/ white wine vinegar and the safflower oil w/ EVOO as both were hard to find in the store. I also used half the amount of crushed red pepper.  This would be a good salad to make at the beginning of the week to eat throughout.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe because I didn't have tarragon vinegar or dried tarragon, but I thought I'd share my opinion that it turned out too "greasy". I would lighten up on the oil if I were to make it again. I liked the little bit of heat in it, but thought it was more work than it was worth.

Beautiful colors and nice flavor. I substituted garden rotini for the rice. Divided the receipe in half and replaced the chicken with feta for my vegetarian friends. Both versions were a hit!

I gave it 3 stars, hubby gave it 5, hence the 4 star rating above. I used white vinegar + 1/4 tsp tarragon, omitted the celery and used dried garlic and parsley, but I can't imagine those changes would affect the rating too much. I think I just don't like tarragon all that much. Our baby hated it.

Loved this, I only used 1 cup of wild rice as it was expensive at my local grocery. I cooked it 55 minutes. I also only had the option of White Wine Vinegar. Oops, forgot to athe almonds and it still was fantastic. I would make again and use fresh tarragon and tarragon vinegar. A fabulous dish for a summer girls night or potluck. I will make this again for sure. The prep time is worth the effort.

We weren't too sure about a cold rice dish, but we actually loved the flavor. The only issue my daughter had was that it was a little oily as leftovers. But otherwise, a very savory dish!

Warm weather calls for salad dinners in our house.  This was a huge hit in our house.  I don't particularly like wild rice so used brown rice.  Otherwise used recipe as written.  It was a big hit in our house on one of those hot nights when only salad would do.  Everyone had a second helping and there were leftovers for the next night's dinner.    Will be making it for the second time this week.  It's a keeper!

The only change I made to this recipe was the type of oil used.  We thought it was phenomenal.  My husband says "everything" I make is good and if I ask what he wants to eat he say "anything".  After a decade I finally found a recipe he actually requests.  And he requests it over and over and tells everyone about it.  That is the highest compliment I can give. (The rest of the fam loves it too!)  Thanks
