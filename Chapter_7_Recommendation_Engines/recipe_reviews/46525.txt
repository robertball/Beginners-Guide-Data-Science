This is a lovely dessert!  Try substituting Limoncello for the white wine, it lends a more subtle hint of alcohol.  I also like using double cream (Devonshire) for its richness and serve with a lemon ginger cookie or lemon biscotti.

While I think it's dubious to warn parents about giving their kiddos the equivalent of a teaspoon or two of wine, I have to give Sarah-neko props for  sharing this recipe.  It's essentially glorified whipped cream, but that's not a bad thing! It comes together easily and earned me  tons of praise when I hosted dinner a few weeks back. I used half splenda, half sugar, incorporating the sugar first and the splenda after I had stiff peaks. I chose Pacific Rim Dry Riesling because it's relatively inexpensive, not too sweet, not too dry. I plan to add this recipe to my permanent collection. Thanks again!

Very delish! I changed the presentation a little bit. I put sponge cake in the bottom of a parfait cup, then a layer of fresh blueberries, and then topped with syllabub and a few more berries. It was wonderful!!! Although, with the added sugar from the cake and berries, in the future I would reduce the sugar added to the whip cream mixture, as it was quite sweet. Overall though, it was a huge hit, and I will certainly be making it again.

I was going to a dinner part hosted by a bunch of foodies who drink expensive wine, eat cheese I have never heard of and use the word "palate" in their sentences. Needless to say I didn't want to bring my usual spicy popcorn or deviled eggs.

This recipe was super easy and a HUGE hit with the foodies. They now think I'm this amazing dessert chef.

Next time I will add a little less sugar - I'm not a huge fan of sweet sweets. 

It takes a while to whip - I used a hand mixer on low until I got impatient and put in on medium - it didn't seem to hurt it at all. 


I'm excited to experiment with adding flavors and fresh fruit.

Chilled is the way to go. Note: starts to separate after a day but can be re-whipped.

This has been very popular with guests.  I love to serve it when I cook seafood.  I pair it with lemon curd, either swirled or layred.  Very nice.

Light and delicious as well as being quick and easy to prepare.  Makes a great alternative to a Sabayon/Zambaglioni for a dinner party, since it is made in advance.

This dessert is delicious,light and creamy. The 2 things I did not like about it though is the Lemon Zest(Lemon Peelings) in it. And it is also fattening.

If you’re going to make and enjoy a syllabub, do it in the real 18th manner. For goodness sake, don’t chill them! Cover the glasses and put them on the counter and wait until they separate. The longer they sit , the more they separate – and that’s a good thing! I’ve kept them for days and they’re fine. No, they’re delicious!

This was delightful! I took the suggestion to use a Riesling & it was a very nice choice. I was going to go w/ a Gewurztraminer (it's very fruity & kinda sweet) but glad I took the advice of the reviewers...the dryness of the Riesling really complemented the sweetness of the dessert. I  sprinkled quite a bit of nutmeg on top...it made a wonderful addition. Served it in vintage parfait glasses & garnished w/ a lemon twist but you are going to want to use sherbet glasses if you want 6 servings out of it...I only got four using parfait. Who knew something so simple could be so elegant & have such complex flavors...will have again many times. Like other reviewers, I can't wait to serve it to company.

For a non-alcoholic version, you can substitute ginger ale for the white wine.

Wonderful! I took the more traditional way and let it set. There's the thick almost custard topping and a sweet white wine at the bottom waiting for you. I like to present it in our "nice" wine glasses so you can see the seperation.

Fabulous easy recipe!
I made this for 30 people-I Used Pinot Grigio for the wine and the recipe multiplier.
I served it in 5oz plastic shot glasses from Part City garnished with sprigs of fresh lemon balm and a spoon.
I put it in the fridge over night and put nutmeg and lemon sprig on right before serving.
The tart wine balanced the sugar.
Next time...a fresh raspberry in the bottom of the cup !

Does anyone have any suggestions on what type of white wine is the best to use? I used a Chardonnay but thought it might've been better to use something else -- maybe a Pino Grigio or a Soave? Still, it WAS delicious, and fairly "impressive" for serving to guests.

Holy smokes! Perfect light dessert after a big meal. I will make this again for sure! Paired it with some biscotti as per another review (only could get almond, would actually recommend over the lemon as to not take away from the Lemon Syllabub). I also used Limoncello as per another review as I happen to have some, not sure how much it changed it, but I imagine I only deepened the flavour of the lemon. So easy to make- although when I added the liquid as per the recipe, it fell a little flat and remade it- whipped it much thicker as I would normally do when making whipping cream, then added the limoncello and lemon juice- but we dug into the first batch for seconds!!- it was just more of a drink, equally delicious in flavour....). This is the perfect thing to make after a heavy meal or for a summer treat, so glad I finally tried this recipe!

This was simple and tasty. I had left over heavy whipping cream and this was refreshing way to. I was surprised how much the white wine (Chardonnay) added to the flavor. I wound up adding a bit more lemon to balance it out.

I found this syllabub when the dessert I first made for 10 guests turned out a disaster just hours before I was expecting them. I needed to find something quick, easy & light in a hurry. My husband was dispatched at the last minute for more cream & we put together a double quantity of the recipe VERY quickly, put it in the fridge & when I bought it out at the end of the evening it was an absolute triumph. exactly the right light, refreshing taste to finish the fork & finger buffet perfectly. I will definitely be making it again. And I didn't change a thing, it was great just as it was.

Fantastic recipe and so easy! I prepared this following the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. I topped fresh raspberries with it and added a sprig of mint and it was a hit!

This was great. I made this for guests and they loved it. I think next time I will try a new flavor maybe orange? This is a very rich dessert a little goes a long ways. My husband suggested using this on top of sponge cake for a flavor maybe next time I make this Ill try that. a simple suprising dessert!

I htought this was ok.  My two children thought it was disgusting and my husband tasted it and turned his nose up to it.  I ate mine and thought is was ok.  I could only eat a little glass full.  It would have been better without the wine, then again we aren't big wine drinkers.  I most likely will not make again.

Used limoncello to top up juice to make 3/8 c liquid. Use less sugar to whip the cream. Excellent with raspberries

Light and refreshing after a big meal.  I will have to experiment with another wine, but not 100% sure  I love the wine and whipped cream combination.  I served this near Christmas, so I garnished it with three raspberries and a couple of mint leaves.  It looked beautiful.

I used Sauvignon Blanc, and dissolved the sugar, wine, and juice together. I made white chocolate snowflakes to garnish, and sprinkled a touch of King Arthur Winter Spice on the tops. Lovely!

Easy, fresh, and tasty! I used muscado white wine (wasn't sure what sweet wine would be good and this was the ticket!). My sugar was a bit lumpy so I gave it a spin in my mini food processor and the resulting syllabub wasn't grainy in the least. 

I just dumped it all in together into the chilled metal bowl of my mixer and whisked away! I made a double batch and filled 7 juice glasses. I topped it with ginger snap crumbles and a ginger snap and served it at an English themed Poldark viewing party to rave reviews! The Poldark episode even referenced "syllabub" so it was a definite win! :)
I will definitely make it again. 

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us!

Sublime.   Used a fruity Canadian Riesling for the wine.  The fresh nutmeg takes it over the top.

Whipping it by hand took awhile but was well worth it. The nutmeg is essential. Absolutely splendid.

My mother has made me syllabub every year on my birthday as long as I can remember (sparkling grape juice replaced the wine) and it has become a cherished memory. Love it.

This dessert is very sweet. The original 17th century recipe calls for brandy to be used and not to chill it. That way it separates as it's supposed to. Tried this recipe and it was loved by my family and now I make a non-alcohol variety with ginger ale for family gatherings.

Very good!!  

I have actually heard and made this recipe before I came upon this one and thought it was quite good!  It is a very light and dessert with just enough tartness and sweetness.  The perfect LIGHT dessert to top off a Thanksgiving meal.

When I saw this recipie I thought it sounded interesting but I wasn't sure if it was in a good way or a bad way. I had a dinner with a bunch of foodies and figured I'd subject them to it as an experiment. We all loved it. I also used a dry Riesling (as someone else suggested), fresh lemon juice, and manufacturing cream (40% butterfat). I didn't really notice the nutmeg but it didn't matter. Some of us found it a little on the sweet side and so I would make it with a little less sugar next time (given that someone made it with half sugar/half Splenda, I think slightly less sugar will still stabilize the cream). It sounds like it will be rich and heavy but it comes out very light and perfect for a warm evening and it takes almost no time to make. We will be making this again!

Like mantovani I can't wait to serve this to company. Minimum work, prepare ahead and guests I'm sure will think you're very clever my family certainly did. Thanks.
