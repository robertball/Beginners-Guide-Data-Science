So you won't be disappointed if you plan to use this oil in marinades, or stir-frying, please don't pay attention to Allrecipes: "Prep time 5 minutes - Ready in 5 minutes".  The recipe description clearly states: "Let sit for a week or so to let the spices do their stuff."  It is great for use in stir-fry dishes.

Worth Noting: The bacteria that causes botulism can grow in infused oils if they are stored for too long. Anything that may contain a trace of water, when placed in the oxygen free environment that oil provides, can be a breeding ground for Botulism. If you intend to make this oil, 1) use it within the week and 2) after allowing it to stay out on the counter for a few hours to infuse, refrigerate! This should reduce the chances of any botulism getting a foothold in the oil.

Ok not sure what the earlier reviewer meant regarding botulism.  Obviously if you used dried anise, cardamom, and cloves you're fine!  No need to worry just infuse the oil and have fun.
