I took Tiina's suggestion and quartered the lemon and squeezed the heck out of them to get all the juice I could out of them instead of throwing the whole quartered lemon into the blender. I did not have vanilla yogurt, just plain Greek yogurt. I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to make up for it. One of the BEST smoothies I've had in a LONG time. So very good.

I am the submitter of this recipie. I have discovered since submiting it that the best way to go is to quarter your lemon (DON'T PEEL IT), and just squeeze everything you can out of each quarter. It eliminates the pith issue. My kids love sour stuff, so this is a big hit at our house! You can add more honey or even sugar to cut the sourness of it.

This is Rachel, Maureen's daughter. I can't believe no one else has commented!!! My mother made it and I was quite surprised.  It's got a mix of sweet and sour that complement each other amazingly. Even better when you try it with whipped cream. It's easy to make and a truly healthy treat, which is a rarity in the age of processed foods.

Tina - Thank you for this recipe - LOVED IT!  It is a wonderful blend of two of my favorite fruits.  I didn't add all of the honey as I wanted it on the tart side.  I had fresh berries that I froze so I cut back on the ice a little bit.  The result was a refreshing thick creamy drink.  This will be a great recipe on the upcoming hot summer days.

Yeah, a recipe with no white sugar and very excellent taste.  I use plain yogurt to eliminate the white sugar entirely. I like it thick because it makes a nice hot day sipper.  Plop a few of those fresh raspberries, mint leaves and a thin slice of lemon on top and you've got quite the elegant drink.  With all the attention lately on how 'poisonous' sugar is when taken in anything other than very small quantities, I really appreciate finding this recipe.  Keep'm coming folks.

Not using an intact lemon was something I chose to do without hesitation as I didn't want the bitterness the pith would impart.  Even with just a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice, Hubs still thought this smoothie a tad too tangy.  Even so, he called it refreshing (in other words, too tangy in his mind is better than too sweet) and very raspberry (I used more than called for).

I love smoothies, but this was way too thick.  Taste was super, just waaay too thick, even after adding additional liquid it was thick, but could at least come out of the blender.

wow, this was like no other smoothie I've ever tasted.  The seeds and pith in the smoothie were not especially appetizing.  I used one container greek yogurt and one container regular vanilla yogurt.

Oh. Wow.Best Smoothie Ever. It's sweet, it's tart, it has the great flavors of raspberry and lemon. he only changes I would make would be straining it (  there is a lot of pieces of rind in it) and adding a tad more honey. But great, great, GREAT smoothie.

Perfect! My 4 kids (ages 1-9) all liked it. Used the juice from 1 lemon, as Tiina mentioned.
