Didn't have much flavor to the "filling".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart.

I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make

This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning.

Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner.
