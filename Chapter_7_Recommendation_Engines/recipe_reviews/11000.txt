I followed the recipe exactly, but after letting them cool I realized they were just a blob of thick buttery chocolate mush in the pan. I even tried baking them again, in case they could be saved somehow, but they just remained mushy. Is there too much butter in the recipe? What a waste of time and ingredients!!!

When I make these brownies I print out several copies of the recipe....I always have several
people ask for a copy.  Most often heard, 'best
brownie I have ever had'

I melted all the chocolate and butter together and they turned out beautiful! Everything a brownie should be! Nice crust on top and chewy moist decadence in the middle. I baked them in a silicone mini muffin tray for 25 minutes ans they were perfect! Definitely will use this recipe again.

These brownies are absolutely delicious! I've read a few of the other reviews stating that there are other brownie recipes that are better on this site.  However, I recommend to try this recipe as I'm not sure how many other recipes could compete!

These are the most amazing brownies I have ever had. Everyone I shared them with said they were the best they have had as well. They are a difinate remake. These are very fudgy so if you like cake like brownies, these wont be for you. They were very easy to make as well. I would not change a thing either.YUMMY!!

This is the best fudgy brownie recipe. So delicious! Subbed nearly a cup of unsweetened cocoa plus 2T butter for the unsweetened chocolate (which I rarely have on hand). My son--who prefers brownies without nuts--ate one, then hugged me. "These are best brownies ever," he said, then proceeded to down a few more.

Chocolate perfection, I made a double batch, one for home one for work. I used macadamias instead of walnuts and added chopped white chocolate instead of the chocolate chips. Everyone loved them and its great to have an easy recipe with ingredients you always have in the pantry..Many thanks...chris

Wonderful recipe for fudgy type brownies, my personal favorite!! I used a 7"x11" pan which produced a thicker brownie and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips mixed with 1 teaspoon of the flour (this keeps the chips from sinking to the bottom). Substituted pecans for the walnuts, since that is what I had on hand. I topped the brownies with the nuts and chocolate chips half way through the baking time so that they didn't get overbaked.  Delicious!

I followed directions exactly and had no problems with it being doughy or undercooked. These brownies are sooooo good! Especially with the walnuts. My family can't get enough of them and I've already handed out the recipe.

I made these following the recipe exactly and mine came out dry not moist or chewy. There was enough chocolate and nuts but didn't stay together. I will try it again...They tasted good except for above issues

I was surprised there as no leavening or salt listed in the ingredients.  I added 1 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt.   They were delicious.
