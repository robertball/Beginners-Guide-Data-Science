This was very tasty. I found it when looking for something to make as part as the South Beach diet. Low carbs, excellent flavor. I cooked it over a bed of cabbage and rice wine vinegar, and the steam was able to cook all the ingredients. If you cut the tofu into squares, it makes pretty servings, ready to eat.

I added a beaten egg to the pork mixture for extra flavour.

I wanted to like this more than I did. Maybe if I hadn't made "Chinese Style Ground Pork & Tofu" the same time, I would have.  I did mine in a pan, not microwave.  I made more sauce, but that wasn't the problem.  It's not bad, just tastes like Americanized Chinese.  Also, used reduced fat ground pork & it was a good choice.

Very tasteless and boring.  Would not make again- it's quick to make but so plain.  I had to cover it in hot sauce to make it taste like anything
