My 15 year old son made this exactly as the recipe says.  I was very skeptical because I'm not a fan of bread pudding - but it is delicious!  Very tasty - 5 stars from the whole family.

My family serves this alongside pork chops or thick slices of ham.  I substitute half the butter for 8oz of cream cheese!

instead of using shredded cheddar cheese a good substitute would be stewed fruits whether stewed pineapple, apple, plum, mangoes. more than nine slices of bread can be used as this makes the casserole more enjoyable.

We just moved to Alabama and heard of this dish.  This is the first recipe we tried and we really enjoyed it.  It works well as a side dish for ham, turkey or fried chicken.    We recommend that you add the bread cubes to the egg mixture before adding the pineapple.  This will reduce the amount of curdling that occurs from the acid in the pineapple and will result in a creamier dish.

It is very easy and tasty. I used to hate pineapples. Every time I ate pizza I always take out the pineapples. Now after eating this... I love pineapples so much. You don't even need to put cheese on top... it is delicious with and without cheese!

I have made this three times this month already!  My son was home from college and I packed him some goodies, including some of this dessert.  He called me specifically to tell me how good this was.  I do cut back on the sugar and butter some, cuz it just seems like so much.  I also tried a baguette of french bread as another reviewer suggested.  Delicious!  I have not tried it with the cheese as it just doesn't seem to need it.  This is a treat for sure!

very good and sooo easy!  I serve it with a baked ham-not for dessert.  I've never put cheese in mine but it does sound good!

Everyone loved this, and I had many recipe requests.  I made it exactly as written, with a baquette of crusty French Bread.

I really liked this recipe. I did make a few changes to it. The first was that I used pineapple tidbits instead of crushed because I was out of crushed pineapple. I also added some cinnamon to the whipped butter sugar mixture. I thought that the cinnamon really added to the recipe. Also if you are like me you may be questioning the cheddar cheese. I tried it with the cheese and it was delicious. It cuts some of the sweet and gives it a great flavor. Trust me you are not going to be tasting a strong cheese flavor. YUM!

Wow, this is great & can be used as other reviewers advised--a dessert or a side dish. Picky guest even liked it. Today I found a can of peach tidbits & can't wait to try them because I love peaches, too. THANKS for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I did not have pineapple so instead I used canned peaches and added a handful of raisins! IT WAS DELICIOUS! I made this and took it to the office for our weekly "treats day" and it was all gone inside of 15 minutes! Even people who normally eat small portions of sweet were having second and third helpings!

I was skeptical about the cheddar cheese so when i served this to my game nite ladies I served it with whipped cream, which was really good! Fortunately there was a tad left over and so the following day I heated some up and used the cheddar. Well knock my sox off - it was fantastic. I WILL make this again!!

I made this as a dessert after a good Thai meal and served it warm alamode with coconut ice cream.  It was a great finish to a spicy Thai meal.

I thought the cheddar cheese seemed out of place but it's perfect. Added the perfect salty counterpoint to an otherwise sweet dish. I think I'd cut back a bit on sugar next time. I served it as a side to a ham dinner but even as a dessert, it was sweet. I think I might take it to a covered dish supper as something different that people would like. Good one, sal.

Big hit! I used a baguette for the bread, cut the sugar down some, used cinnamon with the butter and sugar and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. We chose no cheese. ??

My family loved this. I reduced the sugar slightly. Next time I will try the suggestion of replacing part of the butter with cream cheese.

This was quite good.  I used fresh pineapple, pulse in the food processor a couple of times  and I drained off and drank a bit more of the juice than I probably should have.  It needs a bit of juice to be perfect.

My first attempt was a huge success, even though I forgot to drain the crushed pineapple.  I haven't tried draining the pineapple in my subsequent attempts. It was very sweet, but my subsequent attempts at the recipe to cut back the sugar were not as good.  The dish is too sweet for a side dish in our family.  Hubby didn't think the cheddar cheese topping was a good fit, and the cheese may not be necessary for a successful dessert. I have tried using up some whole grain bread that was getting a little stale, and it was good, but we enjoy the results better when I use a fresh heavy white bread.  The cinnamon is a good addition.

This was fantastic! I used it as a side dish, but could have used it as dessert for sure! I used cinnamon butter for half of the butter called for. That really made it sweet and yummy! I would totally do it again. I would most certainly make it again, and I would use the cinnamon butter again too. :-) The whole family feasted on this dish!
