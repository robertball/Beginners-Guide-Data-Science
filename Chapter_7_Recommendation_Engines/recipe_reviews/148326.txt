This was a fabulous recipe.  I used my indoor electric grill and sliced the eggplant before grilling to speed it up.  The only other change was to use white wine vinegar.  I will make this again and again!

We went to the market and bought 4 pounds of eggplant. So I started looking for things to do with them and when I found your recipe I decided to give it a try. It is wonderful! I did make some adjustments for what we had. I added one can of garbanzo beans and left out the feta and tomato. But I did have some trouble cooking the eggplant. So I ended up not cooking it all the way I think. But no matter, it still tastes great.

I used everything except the feta. It was a nice, fresh tasting recipe.

Quick and so easy. You can wrap the eggplant in foil and roast it in the oven if no grill is available. If you don't like raw onions this is not the dish for you.

This was a great way to use up summer garden produce.  I used Japanese eggplant, green and yellow peppers, sweet onion and yellow squash.  Simple and delicious.

This was delicious and very easy to make.  My grill was not working properly, so the eggplant was only partially cooked in the time I needed it, so I diced it up and use the olive oil and 1 small minced clove of garlic to saut√© it until it was fully cooked, removed it from the heat. and mixed in the rest of the ingredients while eggplant was still hot. Chilled for an hour and it was wonderful. I will make this again, for sure.

Followed recipe except for eggplant preparation. I sliced it thick and grilled over gas heat. I think this method worked fine. I needed a larger eggplant but, it was still good. I just made this again for 2nd time in 3 days. It is so good. I had more eggplant this time. If you love the individual ingredients, give this a try. You won't be disappointed.
