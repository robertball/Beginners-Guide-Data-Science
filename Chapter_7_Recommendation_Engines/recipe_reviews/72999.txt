Love this recipe, have made it many times already. I have a solution for the foil leaking if anyone else had this problem. Try using the mini tin pie plates and then wrapping those in foil. Now you have a serving dish too and no mess!!

I tried this last night and we were delighted with it. We lived in Paris for 4 years and althought this is not authentic by any means it did satisfy the taste buds.  My husband declared it a keeper.
I prepared it in the oven but increased the oven temperature to 400 degrees and baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes to get the onion as soft as we like it.

I tried this tonight and it was delicious.  The flavor of the broth was exceptional and the onions were so tender and sweet.  I didn't have sherry, so I used a splash of white cooking wine. I baked it in the oven since it's raining out, and it did take longer than one hour.  In fact it took almost 2.  I added several more ice cubes, since several said there was not quite enough broth.  Other than that, the recipe was not altered.  The provolone was very tasty, but what a mess. It stuck to the bowl, the knife and fork when I cut up the onion in my bowl, and then the spoon.   I just had a nice hearty slice of toasted nine grain bread from the bakery and all in all it was a great and satifying meal.  My husband will be home late, and when he does, he'll get a bowl and maybe I'll return and write his review.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely make this one again.

This was absolutely delicious & so simple to make.  I didn't change a thing. It's important to pour it all to a serving bowl immediately otherwise the cheese will stick to the foil.  We added garlic onion croutons to the soup before serving. Mmmm.

I love this soup!! I started making it last summer on my gas grill. I made it twice in the first week after I found the recipe. I follow the recipe as written, except I don't add the sherry (I do 4 ice cubes). I cook it for an hour then pour the broth and onion into a deep bowl. I add the slice of cheese and cover the bowl with the used foil for a few minutes. This eliminates any mess with the cheese sticking to things. When the Vadalia onions are out of season, I have used sweet onions and it is still pretty good.

I love this recipe, and make it often.  I got lucky and found some 10oz soup crocks at goodwill and prepare the soup right in them.  Just follow the recipe as is, and wrap the entire cup/crock w/foil, making sure to seal it well (leave some room at the top though).  Works great both on the grill, and in the oven!

Delicious! I baked these last night for dinner and everyone loved them, even our two teenagers. After reading the reviews I baked them at 400 for 1 hr. 15 min. and they were perfectly done. What a neat recipe... we plan to try them on the grill this summer.

Great, easy recipe. I followed almost all of the recipe. I found it too salty with a bouillon on each onion. Therefore, 2nd time around, I did one onion with and one onion without bouillon, etc.  When they were done cooking, I did not add the cheese. I pulled them off the grill, cooled them and sliced them all the way through. I threw them in a pot, with the remaining liquid, added a can of low sodium beef broth and heated through. When I was ready to serve,  I added the cheese to each individual bowl. Thus, no cheese sticking to tin foil. Delicious soup.

Fabulous fabulous fabulous. I did ultimately put in a little mustard powder and some extra ice cubes to make extra broth. I also let it sit on the grill for about an hour or so (on low at the end) since the people I was feeding were late. However, I think that was only to its benefit - the onions break apart after cooking for so long and it's got a wonderful flavor. I put the cheese on once I had the soup poured into bowls and let it melt that way. The man said it was the best onion soup I'd ever made and I had to agree....and I've made some good onion soup! Love it. Now I want to try using this cooking method to try something like stew while camping....!

I was at home by myself tonight and decided to make this.  I didn't have any alcohol in the house, so I used cranberry juice instead.  Very tasty.    I will definately keep this recipe handy especially when I am by myself as it is so easy to make.

My roommate and I ate this all summer long. The only change was we added more ice cubes because we wanted more broth. It's so delicious and easy to make!

This is a family favorite when we go camping.  With a salad, it is a meal in itself.  My daughter is a vegetarian so, by substituting vegetable bouillon cubes, it is one thing we can grill that she will eat.  I often leave out the ice cubes because I don't have them when camping - they aren't crucial.

My husband & I enjoyed this soup (without the sherry), except that we both found it a bit too salty. The next time I made it with 1/2 bouillon cubes & Walla Walla onions (Vidalia onions are not available for long here in Quebec); not as good as the 1st time. We look forward to next summer when I will try it again with 3/4 boullion cubes & Vidalia onions; also, we will try it again with Walla Walla onions to see if the onions also make a difference. This is such an easy & delicious recipe.

We followed the directions, but there wasn't hardly any broth.  I'll stick to other recipes.

This was great, easy and really tasted like french onion soup!  Used chablis as I had no sherry - I think red wine would work as well.  Will do again.

Yum!  I had to use a chicken cube and leave off the cheese, but it was still really good.  Easy to make too.  I can see us using this recipe a lot during the coming months, and I think it'd be good in the oven too.

Yum!  Giving it only 4 since I had to make some changes. Only had vegetable bouillion and no sherry, so I subbed worcestershire sauce.  Needless to say I am doing a grill full of these this weekend!

This was wonderful!!!
Best to eat in a bowl after grilling.
