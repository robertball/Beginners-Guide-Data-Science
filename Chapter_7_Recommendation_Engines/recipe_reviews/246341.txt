I added some craisins to the salad as I saw it as an ingredient in other salads.  My carrots were cut in a disk shape with my salad shooter.  I did not use yeast in the dressing.  It is wonderful.  I will certainly make this again.  Great to use as a salad base under leftover grilled chicken or probably any other protein.

Update 5/22/16.  This salad has become a favorite.  I use either more fresh lemon juice or less olive oil in the dressing.   I used  Red Russian Kale from my garden. I have made it adding avocado & pumpkin seeds or apple and raisins.  Versatile! Old review:  The dressing was a little flat,  which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The salad was filling and I see much potential with adding a little more zing to the dressing.
