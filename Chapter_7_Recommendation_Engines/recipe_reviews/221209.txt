Not bad. Nice way to use leftover ham. I added some salt, pepper and a bay leaf and it flavored it up nicely.

I enjoyed this soup very much. I like how you puree the veggies to thicken the soup. Brilliant idea wthout adding calories.

I loved this soup, but because I did not have any white beans at home, and of course, did not want to go out to the store, I left the soup as a broth. It was delicious without any thickening. I felt no need to add any other seasonings. I will definately make this again, and I may chose to leave out the beans again.

First of all, I wanted to note that this makes more like 12+ servings or more, not 6 as listed. I used small sweet potatoes and large celery stalks/onion. I had to pan fry the veggies in 2 batches because it was just too thick in the pot to have cooked properly in one batch. I used the biggest pot I have in the house and still could only get 6 cups of liquid in the pot. Anyway, I changed this recipe a lot to suit what I had on hand, so take my rating with a grain of salt. I had just made Greek Burgers (from this site), and I cooked the veggies in the grease from that. The burgers have shallot and fennel and oregano in them, and you could taste it in the veggies once they were cooked. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular, omitted beans and corn, used veggie bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth, added 3 smallish fennel stalks and 2 smallish bay leaves to the broth. The ham was leftovers and had a sweet orange glaze on it. I was worried the sweet would clash with the savory flavors, but it all blended nicely and tasted great. I accidentally put the 1 C ham in with the hame bone, so I didn't bend it up. This recipe is a great base to modify as needed for leftovers.

Wonderful!!  I added a leak but accidentally added an entire onion too instead of the 1/4 onion.  Still so good.  Be very careful how long the bone simmers in the soup.  I had a lot of meat/fat on my bone so it didn't take but just a few minutes for the ham bone to work it's magic.

Love! I didn't make any real changes to this, but added in green beans that I had as leftovers in the fridge so as to not let them go to waste. As said before in other reviews, this is a great way to use up leftovers and randoms that may be in your fridge awaiting a second use. Also, I found it to be very clever to puree two cups of veg to thicken the soup without using any type of dairy. I'm definitely carrying that idea into other recipes going forward!

Amazing soup!  Love having a creamy dairy-free soup.  Lots of options of adding whatever veggies you like, but loved it the way it was!
