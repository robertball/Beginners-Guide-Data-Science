Made this last night and even my picky husband loved them! I liked that you could make the butter ahead of time and was easy enough for a work night. I missed the instructions about double egging and crumbs but was fine. Definitely a keeper!

Nice to see you froze the butter mixture. Definatly the trick to stop them leaking.
