Lacking depth as is. If you want to make this dish taste like fine restaurant quality, do not reconstitute the sd tomatoes. Eliminate the broth altogether. Boil your penne to al dente. Then saute your garlic, onion, & red pepper flakes. After that, toss ALL ingredients together (do NOT pre-wilt the baby spinach, add it raw), and add in FRESH LEMON JUICE ("that extra something") and enough olive oil to very lightly coat, and maybe some cooked shrimp for a main course. It is also good with toasted walnuts if you don't want to spring on pine nuts. Sprinkle with FRESH shredded, not grated, parm or none at all. It will make the flavors pop instead of melting in or tasting powdery. This is how I made it for a dinner special as a restaurant cook and it was my most requested dish.

Really easy and very tasty!  Few changes: used chicken broth, oil packed tomatoes, doubled the garlic and pepper flakes, and added about a tbsp of fresh basil.  Will make again.

One of my favorites ... very simple to prepare and tasty! I omit the pine nuts as a personal preference, substitute dehydrated tomatoes with julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, no need to presoak them and adds great texture and flavor, and drizzle additional olive oil as the final step to moisten the pasta a bit. Serve with garlic bread and a glass of wine ... sophisticated simplicity. Prepare to impress! Photo available on my profile page.

Very good, very simple.  I added some artichoke hearts and a little salt to taste.  Toast the pine nuts and use 1 Tbsp per serving.  As others have said, I would add a lot more spinach.  Thanks, one of the  quickies for my recipe box.  I may add some chicken next time.

This recipe is great as written but if you have a little extra time I'd reccommend soaking the sun dried toms. in redwine and chicken broth and throw in  roasted minced garlic to the broth & wine- very aromatic!Leave them in about 1 hour. Also this recipe converts nicely in to a great dolled up version of Meditarrean Cous Cous dish. Just sub-in Cous Cous in place of the Penne.

This was really really good.  I didnt have penne so i used angel hair, and i also used the sundried tomatoes in oil.  I sauted 4 cloves of garlic in a little oil, added spinach and tomatoes, and about 1 1/2 cups of the starch water from the pasta and 1/2 tsp of chicken broth seasoning.  It was GOOOOOD! i personally used a little more sundried tomatoes because i love them, i couldnt stop munchin on this after dinner it was soo good topped with an italian cheese blend! thank you~

I can't wait to make this again with penne.  I used ditalini b/c I had it on hand.  Also I used chicken broth (well actually bouillon mixed with water b/c that's all I had…shhh) - just popped it in the microwave for 2 minutes then let sit w/tomatoes for 15.  I added an extra clove of garlic, but next time I won't and only had 1/2 a bag of baby spinach, but could have used a whole bag.  Didn't have pine nuts but I’m sure it would be perfect with them.  Topped with gruyere and parmesan - DELICIOUS!!!

This pasta recipe is PERFECT! It was easily adaptable, simple to prepare and looked beautiful in the serving bowl! Here were my substitutions: I had no broth so I used water. I used sun dried tomato spread instead of chopping tomatoes~ made a nice sauce! Also, I had no pine nuts so I substituted slivered almonds. I will definitely make it again and throw in some chicken next time. Thanks for a great, healthy, family friendly recipe! Whip up a batch with a crusty loaf of bread and a nice salad and people will think you put much more effort into it than you really did!

I loved this dish.  I did substitute white wine for the vegetable broth.  Even the leftovers were yummy.  I think I might add some fresh mushrooms next time.

This was pretty good but I was expecting it to be much better based on the ingredients and the reviews.  It needs more of a "sauce"--maybe some tomato sauce or half-and-half?  Probably won't make again.

I know, I know, we all hate it when we change the recipe & then rate it high...     We LOVED it and I changed it by: using bow tie pasta, Sun Dried Toms (from Costoc) in OIL - lots of them!, rotisserie chicken, lots of red pepper flakes (cooked with garlic and sun dried toms in lots of olive oil).  After the pasta COOLED, I added small diced Monterey Jack cheese cubes and lots of OLIVES and a little more olive oil to make a light sauce.     We loved it... husband took it to work (fire station) and they loved it there too!

If you like creamy pasta, you can tweak this by adding 3 oz. of cream cheese - so good! For diabetics, try Dreamfield's pasta - it's my daughter's fav dish.

Really tasty dish, but at the end I would add cooked pasta to pan with spinach mixture and continue heating through.  Otherwise, the dish isn't really hot, just lukewarm when serving.

Excellent!  I didn't have any pine nuts so I omitted them.  I too added some green olives and capers to this restaurant quality pasta!   A keeper!

The rustic feel of this dish makes it very easy to modify. In the past I have added asparagus, zucchini, meat and broccoli (but not all at once) because I have needed to use them up before they went bad. I always add a can of chopped tomatoes and substitute some of the broth for white wine -- it makes the pasta seem a little less naked when its done... however the added liquid does increase the amount of time you need to allow the sauce to cook.

This is just like a dish @ Bravo which is my favorite.  Add feta...that makes it.  P.S.  Make this cold and it is  great pasta salad.

I too used oil packed sun dried tomatoes.  I rinsed them to make them less oily.  This was a delicious, light pasta that comes together very quickly.

This is one of the reasons I love this site, it's for recipes like this! I made this for a dinner party, and it was a HUGE hit! I added chicken and artichokes like many others and the leftovers were delicious.  As for the cheese, I had the feta and parmesean on the side and let them choose. Thank you for such a great and versitile recipe for my collection!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!! The whole family loved the freshness and flavor. I did add some finely chopped celery, onions and Italian seasoning to the garlic saute. Next time around I may add some roasted red peppers. Definitely a keeper and will be added to my favorites.

Fantastic and simple recipe. The best kind. I added asparagus and chicken to my version and they were great additions. Cook the chicken in a skillet with cooking spray and an additional clove of garlic (I'm Italian, garlic is life blood). Just cook the asparagus after you saute the garlic. After the asparagus is cooked but still crunchy add in the spinach and follow the original recipe.

Excellent recipe! I felt like my husband and I were on a date at a nice Italian restaurant. A couple changes that I did end up makings: chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, sun dried tomatoes that come pre-soaked in a jar of oil, sauteed a couple shallots and 3 cloves of garlic, added a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, added a can of drained quartered artichokes and used 4x the amount of red pepper flakes. Salt and pepper to taste. I served this next to a bunch of sauteed shrimp seasoned with some garlic salt and cayenne pepper. I will definitely make this again. I bet it would be great with some grilled chicken strips too.

Bleh.  Maybe it's just because I don't LOVE sundried tomatoes (I like them ok) but I did not like this recipe.  It needed more of a sauce or more seasoning or something.  My husband didn't like it either and he likes tomatoes more than I do.

Very good. Added some grilled chicken to make a complete meal. Tasted very fresh, not heavy. My husband loved it and asked for it to be made again.

Hit a HOME RUN with this recipe. Added a half cup of diced red, yellow, orange pepper for another layer of freshness, and added mushrooms because I love them... Added Lime Juice and a shake of Tabasco. My grown kids wiped out the pan...

I'm still mostly a beginner but wanted to make this.  I don't know how much a "bunch" of spinach is and I also could not find individual sun-dried tomatoes so used (2) 7 oz. from packets (too much).  I've never heard of vegetable broth.  After a lot of work and using every pot, pan and strainer to make this I ended up in a bad mood.

This was DELISH! I just finished dinner and both my boyfriend and I ate the whole dish. I followed the recipe exactly except used chicken stock in place of vegetable.  It was VERY flavorful.  I had read previous reviews saying that the dish was bland and needed salt and pepper, so I added some salt.  Next time I will NOT add salt because it would have been perfect without it, it was a little too salty with the extra. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe! All of the flavors blend so well together. The only changes I made were using sundried tomatoes packed in oil and I used chicken stock instead of vegetable.

Very tasty recipe.  We added sliced sweet italian sausage and it was wonderful.  Would be very good with no meat too though.   I will try it will some additional garlic and chicken next time I make it.

Will definitely make again!  Served as a side dish at a dinner party and it got rave reviews!  I didn't have pine nuts but it was fantastic without them.  I also didn't use dehydrated sun dried tomato but instead used a jar packed in oil and used some of the oil from the jar for extra flavor instead of the olive oil called for.  I still added in the veggie broth.  Served it with freshly shredded parmesan.

Delicious and super easy! I make this all the time and it always turns out great. The only change I make is omitting the vegetable broth. It's too salty and the recipe does not need it. If you get oil packed sun dried tomatoes they are already soft enough to chew and don't need to be soaked. I also use extra Parmesan cheese and extra pinenuts.  Great heated up the next day too.

This recipe is fantastic! I added both shrimp and chicken just because we like to have meat with dinner. It would be fabulous without those two additions though too.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have pine nuts so I used walnuts and I added chicken and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I also used Feta cheese instead of Parmesan.  The flavor was fabulous.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I substituted the Veg. stock with chicken stock because that is what I had on hand and it turned out delicious.   If my kids weren't eating it, I would have added just a bit more of the crushed pepper.
I recommend this for a nutricious weeknight meal!

I definitely added mushrooms but I didn't end up using any chicken broth.  I basically sauteed the veggies, spices, and garlic in the olive oil and then mixed in the cooked pasta and added lots of parmesan.  It looks beautiful with all the colors and it tastes wonderful!

Excellent. Easy. Entertainment-worthy. I used cheese tortellini instead and added some fresh diced tomatoes and a little crumbled feta cheese on top. Plus I used extra sun dried tomatoes, 5 cloves of minced garlic and extra spinach, but omitted the pine nuts (didn't have any). I was worried the red pepper flakes would be too hot for my little ones, but it wasn't. It held just the right flavor. I will make again! Thanks for sharing.

As I was preparing this I thought there was no way it would be interesting or flavorful but it turns out to be both!  My 3 year old son LOVED it so it's definitely on the family dinner rotation now.  I didn't have pine nuts and chose not to buy them at $5.99 for a little jar but otherwise I followed the recipe as written and will again next time.

Made this dish the other night and it was very good -- Used the sundried tomatoes in oil instead of reconstituting the dried ones.  A shake of hot sauce made it even better -- nice dish.

I've been making this for months and I've told all my friends about it. It's my favorite recipe and great how it is, but I use dried habanero pepper flakes to make it hotter, and I love adding salmon for more protein. This is an all around good meal.

This dish gets cooked every week in my house. However I made some changes. I don't use any pasta. Instead I add chic peas. Also, if I don't use broth I will use a 1/2 cup of water, chicken bouillon cube and coconut oil. Sometimes I may even add avocado. It has been transformed into a popular vegetarian dish .

Loved it! Having said that, I made a couple of changes. For one thing I marinated chicken breast in It. dressing for a couple of hours. Fried the chicken in olive oil and cut it into cubes. Added that to the pasta. I didn't have "de-hydrated" sun dried tomatoes, so I used the ones in the jar. I also doubled the Garlic and the red pepper

My husband & I couldn't finish this. I think it was the vegetable broth that really ruined it for me. It gave such a strong flavor and one that didn't match the rest of the ingredients. And it gave the tomatoes a really strong, odd flavor. Maybe if I would have eliminated that, it would have been edible, but I probably won't be trying for a next time.

This recipie was good, but I took it further.  Instead of pine nuts, add a small jar of basil pesto. Added 1 cup diced onions and half pound of proscoutto (sp?). Cut back to 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, and use about 12 diced roma tomatoes. Also added 1 tspn fresh minced garlic and added enough chicken broth to keep it a little moist while it simmered to develop flavors. All this makes this a little more savory.

This is good! It's easy & quick too :)
I used oil packed toms & just sorta drained them on some paper towel. I used baby spinach & next time I think I will use more! I had the intention to add the pine nuts but then stumbled across some information about people having bad reactions to them!? It made me scared so I threw away my $6 bad of TJ's pine nuts :( Still tasted great & I will make this again. Used wholewheat pasta too.

Not a bad dish, I think the success of this dish depends on what sort of vege broth your putting into it, even still I think broth is a bit too strong - maybe boiling the pasta in it would've been a better option.  Unfortunately I didn't have any vege broth, so reverted to Chicken broth which was a tad overpowering.....i'm rating it 4 instead of 3 because I had to change a few things.  I didn't have pine nuts, which wouldn't have made a huge difference.  I also didn't have fresh parmesan - which I think would've helped bring this dish together.  I put a bit of feta in the mixture which spruced it up nicely!  Thank you!

This was simple and very good.  I love things that are easy to make.  The only I changed was adding more garlic because I love it.  Someone suggested adding artichoke hearts or mushrooms, and using some wine.  I will try those ideas next time to step it up for company.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It was a little bland to me, something was definitely missing.  Most of the reviews seemed to have added several other ingredients and I can now see why.  I won't make it again.

I liked this, but I think I would reduce the amount of broth. Also, the whole family said there was 'something missing'. Not sure what the something is, but will try the dish cold today and see what it's like as a pasta salad. Not sure I would make it again.

There is a lot of flavor packed into this simple dish. I added white beans for more interest and to make it a more complete meal, and substituted farfalle as the pasta base. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Really good pasta- I did like others suggested and added feta, which I liked because it cut down on the spice of the cracked red pepper.  Next time I might add chicken to add a little more to it.  Great base for a recipe.

This was a little bit bland, but just needed a dash of salt.  I used Barilla Plus pasta and also added a little extra broth and tomatoes so the pasta wouldn't be so dry.  Great recipe!

I had about 3/4 of an 8 oz. jar of oil packed julienne sun dried tomatoes, so I used that.  I poured some of the oil along with a bit of olive oil into a large frying pan, and sauteed two sliced chicken breasts.  Pushed them to the side and cooked 3 cloves of minced garlic, the peppers and about 1/2 tsp of basil. Added the tomatoes and a can of drained chopped artichoke hearts. Sprinked with Wondra, added a 14 oz. can of chicken broth and a splash of Marsala.  Simmered this for a few minutes then added the spinach. At the end, added some crumbled crisp bacon and Parmesan. My husband said "This is heaven" and "You hit a home run with this one." It was good!

This is good as a side dish (or add some meat to the pasta to make it a main course). I used bowtie pasta instead of penne, and only 3/4 cup of broth (because of other reviews). Everything else was done as directed per the recipe. Because there is no meat in this dish, my husband heated up some leftover chicken to eat with his pasta.

Outstanding recipe!  I used oil packed sun-dried tomatoes and chicken broth, but did not soak the tomatoes since they were already moist.  I used a little more crushed red pepper than 1/4 t. and loved the extra heat!  My husband who isn't much of a sun-dried tomato fan had to force himself to stick with 2 helpings!  He really enjoyed the dinner and raved throughout the meal.  I plan to make this one often!

What a  great recipe. Easy, fast, with ingredients I always have at hand. The only ingredient I didn't have were the pine nuts and I don't think I will use them in the future. I didn't think the dish was missing anything without them. I served the pasta with the parmesan-crusted tilapia from this site and my husband gave it a "fantastic" (his highest rating).

Great healthy pasta dish - added more spinach and did not have pine nuts, but it really didn't matter.   I also cut back on pasta, but that is a matter of taste.  Thanks for submitting.

This was very good. Like another reviewer, an wonderful change to the heavy tomato sauces. My printer wasn't working so I scooted between the kitchen and monitor.  Tried to chopped the tomatoes before soaking, duh... The red pepper flakes were just right.  I also had some mushrooms to use up and I threw in 2 large sliced french echallotes.  Used baby spinach and really didn't have quite enough. Will make sure I have more on hand next time.  On the side I served butterflied scampi done with garlic/butter and coated in breadcrumbs.  Scrumptious.  Thank you for your excellent combinations of sun-dried tomatoes and spinach.

Very nice pasta dish. I added 2 chicken breasts, which I cooked by themselves and then added the pine nuts with only 2 tsp. of olive oil and 2 minced garlic cloves. I tossed this with 8 ounces of whole wheat spaghetti and then garnished with dried parsley and grated Parmesan.

I used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes and chicken broth, which I let reduce down.  This was a great way to get spinach onto the plate.  The pine nuts were a great addition.  Good standby recipe when marinara just won't do.

Had with spaghetti and it was great! Used water instead of veg broth and was fine.  A very nice light change from thick sauces.  Thanks!!
Double the red pepper to make it a very spicy dish!

I was looking for a recipe for an item recently removed from the menu of a local restaurant: this is very similar. I sautéed some sliced chicken breast with the garlic; otherwise I made it as written. We enjoyed it & will make it again.***The second time I made this, I used a tomato & basil flavoured pasta. It was a perfect compliment to this recipe.

I changed this recipe quite a bit to suit our taste and to make a complete meal of it by adding chicken and the best part, all is done in one family style skillet except for cooking pasta separately like in original recipe.  I used a 6 oz jar of julienne strip sun dried tomatoes in olive oil, one finely chopped whole peeled shallot and 3 cloves of garlic finely chopped. Saute the tomatoes , shallot and garlic along with red pepper flakes using the olive oil from the sundries tomato jar.   If you want a little more oil add some regular olive oil. Add in a 3-4 oz can of sliced black olives and a 6 oz bag of baby spinach. Sauté  until spinach almost wilted, add 1 ½,cups of chicken broth, heat it all through then mix in the cooked pasta and I added in two sliced or cubed already grilled boneless skinless chicken breast. Let it all heat through in the skillet. Serve with parmesan cheese on the side so everyone can put however much they want on top. Note: I did not bother with pine nuts but these can  be added and mixed in also, toasted or not.

I LOVED this recipe. I made it for my husband and Mother for their Valentine's Day dinner and they loved it too. I will be making this a lot in the future. I should have read other reviews before going shopping for the ingredients and would have just bought the sun dried tomatoes in the bottle and skipped soaking them in the broth. I also like one of the other reviews that was listed as "most helpful critical review".  I will be following that advice next time I make it. Also suggestions from other reviews to add different things.  You could make this for a week straight and it could be a different dinner each time, due to all the things you can add to it.

I would suggest to those just learning to cook (one of the bad reviews that was posted) to just go online and Google search any questions you may have.  I did not know what a "bunch" of spinach is because my stores sell it in bags.  I learned by looking online that a "bunch" is considered 10 oz, which was what I bought in a bag. Always research anything that you may not understand, works for me every time.

Really good. So good, I was asked to make it for company a few days later. I added a few mushrooms, a touch of lemon. and added the spinach last.

Absolutely follow advice in Missteree's Feb 2014 review.  Simpler prep and bright, intense flavors. Served this with spinach/feta chicken sausage and it was a hit.

Funny: Made this to use an expiring jar of never-opened sun-dried tomatoes, but liked Missteree's version so much, will add SDT to grocery list for next time.

Love, love, love this recipe. It's one of those recipes that you can make exactly as written, or change it up. It's difficult to mess it up. I add marinated artichoke hearts, kalamatta olives, and sometimes will skip the sundried tomatoes, and opt for grape tomatoes that I cut in half, sprinkle with a little salt, and roast to bring out their natural sugars. Yum!

Fast and delicious, makes great leftovers (just heat + add parmesan!). I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil! As always, tripled the amount of garlic. I'm on a student budget, so I *toasted* crumbled walnuts instead of *frying* up pine nuts, it was delish!

Just cooked this... ...was really, really tasty. 
???????
†I used two stock cubes (for two servings) and a little over 140mls of water, to make a stock which replaced the "Chicken Broth". I also added some mint and sauteed that with the spinach.

We used whole wheat penne, and added a bit of fresh basil just before serving.

My husband and I loved this recipe, so simple I found it while at the grocery store on my phone. I added extra garlic, extra red pepper and a little white wine. There were many flavors going on, I couldn't believe that it was so simple.

I worked in some cornstarch and about 3 Tbsp of Neufchatel cheese to the vegetable mixture to make the sauce thicker and creamy.  Then, I stirred that into 16 oz of cooked orzo.  Pretty darn good.

I liked it a lot.  However, I didn't use vegetable broth.  I sub'd that out for water w/Vegeta.  I added Basil, and I also used Kale in addition to Spinach.  I also did not use pine nuts.  And the sun dried tomatoes I had were in a jar already finished, with oil and spices.  

But it was great, and it was super quick and healthy.

Followed exactly and found the sundried tomatoes overpowering so next time will use the ones packed in oil but other than that, it's a really good and easy to prepare meal.

Not bad--very easy.  I thought it was a little bland, which is weird bc sundried tomatoes tend to add bursts of flavor, but it wasn't quite enough for me.  A quick, pleasant meal, however.  Thanks for the recipe.

I found this pasta to be quite bland unfortunately.  I had never used dehydrated sun dried tomatoes until now - but found that they did have quite the same flavor as the ones that come packed in oil in the jar (which I love).  I think it probably could have used a little chicken as well - it is a VERY light pasta dish in my opinion.

Not bad.  I agree with one of the previous raters that it screams out for mushrooms.  Next time I'll throw them in as well.  First time I used pine nuts.  They were a nice touch.

Yum!! So good and really quick and simple to make. I didn't have pine nuts so just left them out and it was still delicious. Love the touch of heat from the red pepper. Added a bit of fresh ground black pepper at the end to taste. Perfection!!

Pretty good.  There is a recipe similar to this that has feta on this site.  I like the feta dish better.

This dish was delicious!!! I added marinated artichoke hearts to it and it was awesome.  It took less than 1/2 hour to cook and it was a lighter pasta dish!

This was a great meal, but I found it to be a bit dry for my tastes so I increased the broth to 1/2 cup and that made it perfect! Thanks for sharing, Madball :)

This was my first venture with dehydrated sundried tomatoes and I was not impressed.  Maybe I did something wrong, but they were mushy and tasteless and the spinach was overpowering.  It sounded good, but we didn't care for it.

This is very good!  I didn't have enough sun-dried tomatoes for what this recipe calls for, and it seemed that I had a lot too lol but I made it with about half and I think that worked out great, DH likes tomatoes but as long as they're not too much. I added a 2nd cup of vegetable broth too, it was a bit dry with just one cup.  I didn't have any pine nuts either, didn't realize I had run out so I just made it without, no substitute - I'll try this with them next time but we really liked it without. I also doubled the crushed red pepper flakes, wasn't too much at all.  We added cooked shrimp as well - so good with this recipe!!

Thank you thank you thank you Madball!  This is amazing.  Hubby could not stop raving about it.  I did add a few things:  one cut-up boiled chicken breast, one can of chopped drained artichoke hearts, red wine and fresh chopped garlic to the tomato-broth soak (the juliened sundried tomatoes in a 3oz pkg. from Trader Joes was the perfect amount).  The only pasta I had on hand was bowtie.  It worked great.  Thanks again and also thanks for the suggestions from other raters.

So good! I used pre-washed packaged spinach and pre-chopped sun-dried tomatoes to cut down on prep.  Only took a half hour total!  Followed recipe pretty much exactly, but I doubled the red pepper flakes because I love the kick of heat at the end that they give.  The pine nuts add a lovely little crunch! Love having great vegetarian meals that are easy to prepare, will definitely add this to my permanent recipe box!

Loved this recipe, but I did make a few modifications based on some of the other reviews.  I used my own chicken stock and added a heaping tablespoon of capers and about 6 chopped kalamata olives.  I didn't have any pine nuts on hand, so I toasted some walnut pieces.  Also, I use whole grain pasta - the dish was absolutely fantastic!  Will definitely make it again.

This was wonderful, and so easy!  I used regular whole sun-dried tomatoes, so hydrating them wasn't necessary.  I used an entire bag of baby spinach (no need to rinse & chop - time saver!).  I added pre-cooked, seasoned chicken breasts, cut up to make it more of a meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this. A lot of different flavors...nutty from the pine nuts, a little kick from the red pepper flakes and the tangy of the sun-dried tomatoes. A hit in my book and will be making it again.

OMG this was restaurant quality!  Everyone raved...this is delicious!!  Also easy to make: my sister, who doesn't cook, actually asked for the recipe, and made it soon after, also to rave reviews!  My only stray from the recipe: I doubled the dish (wish I tripled it lol) but instead of adding a second cup of veggie broth i added a cup of water with some freshly ground pepper to keep the sodium low. Thanks for a keeper! =)

This was good, but we didn't love it.  I did have to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand - chicken broth for the veggie broth and 10 oz frozen spinach instead of fresh.  Also I left out the pine nuts based on personal preference.  If I make this again, I'll add some mushrooms as others suggested.

Very good, I took some recommendations of others.  I didn't soak dried tomatoes in broth but instead used sun dried tomatoes in oil.  I drained about 1/2 of the oil.  Also added cubed chicken, package of low fat feta cheese and some fresh basil.  Was planning on using marinated artichokes as well but didn't have any.  Salt and pepper to taste.

A family favorite.  When the cooking starts, it goes so fast, so it pays to do all prep work before hand.  I tried it with vegetable broth and didn't like it.  I prefer to use chicken broth.  Also, I add 2-3 stewed boned chicken breasts.

I accidentally added twice the amount of penne pasta and it was still awesome! I will use this recipe again and again. I recently found chopped dried jalapenos at my local Costco so I thought this recipe was the perfect place to try them out. I added about 2 TBS jalapenos with the garlic saute. It made it even better. I did not have pine nuts so I added chopped chipole flavored almonds. My whole family rated this recipe very high!

This turned out absolutely wonderful!! I loved that there was not too much broth and it wasn't as rich as some similar recipes I've tried.  I'll keep this around in my recipe box.

Rated four stars because I added extra to dish for more flavor. Did not add pine nuts. However, I added 1/2 container of fresh mushrooms, cilantro, green onion, and ground black pepper.  I used whole wheat penne and added a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar for added color and flavor at the end. As others has commented, this dish would be excellent with chicken or even shrimp.

Hmmm... Well, Good, BUT... On my second try, I did add 2Tblsp of cream cheese and 2 Tblsp of heavy cream. Personally, it needs some kind of a sauce. Also, added 1/4 cup packed, sliced fresh basil, and a total of three cloves of garlic, which I thought were excellent additions to the flavor medley going on with this dish. With all these adds, I thought it was a very good dish. In its favor is that it is suprisingly easy to prepare. NOTE: Prepare your spinach (and basil, if you're going that route) beforehand, because when this dish gets going, it's very quick. Good table presentation - gourmet, actually - and people will think you spent hours making it. Served with penne, fresh garlic bread and antipasto salad. It's a four rating, but I'm keeping this recipe.

This was a great start for a recipe, but I definitely felt something was missing.  I just can't figure out what it was.  Maybe next time I will add some chicken like some of the other reviewers suggested.  This dish had a beautiful presentation, but lacked flavor.

Great recipe, very delicious.  Red Pepper flakes add some kick and the pine nuts added the nutty flavor.  I used angel hair pasta (instead of penne pasta) and it was fantastic.

Great recipe, I think it would have been a little bland had I not added chicken. I cooked chx in frying pan, set aside and added a little lemon juice. I also used chx broth instead of veg broth then used same frying pan to cook spinach etc. Good stuff!

I made this for dinner last night, it was verry good.  I made it by the recipe and would only make one change the next time that i fix it, add more spinach, mainly because I love fresh spinach.

Hubby said this is a keeper.  We are a gluten and dairy-free family.  Have outstanding penne pasta, used a 8.5 oz jar in juliann sun dried tomatoes in herbs and fresh spinach.  Toss with hot, cooked pasta and added spices--excellent.  Dish was a snap to make and had zip!

Nice dish for a busy day. I modified a few things: added mushroom while cooking spinach, added salt and pepper. Also maybe its me but every time I try to put red pepper flakes on a hot skillet with oil they basically burn. So I added them not as called out in the recipes but while cooking spinach.

This was really good, although I also altered it. I used gluten free pasta, soaked the sun-dried tomatoes in water, omitted the pine nuts and pepper flakes and spinich, added Kale, artichoke hearts and pepperoni. The whole family liked it.

Really tasty with the following modifications: used 2 large cloves garlic, less pasta, sun-dried toms in oil vs dry, and chicken stock (from bouillon).  This was very flavorful and light.

This was really good.  I used couscous instead of the penne and used the remaining stock as the liquid for the couscous.  I will make this again.

It was great, but a little too tangy for my taste. I think this was because I used oil packed tomatoes...not too sure. I added some brown sugar and a pinch of garlic salt and it turned out perfectly. Next time, I will use the sun dried tomatoes that aren't oiled. It was delicious and beautiful. Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very easy and simple recipe but tastes great!  Quick to prepare and very pretty once cooked and plated.  Hints:  If you like spicy food, add more pepper flakes.  Also, more spinach makes it a little more healthy but still does not overwhelm the recipe.  I used extra firm tofu (cubed) instead of chicken or shrimp as a protien and it complemented well.

Very tasty. Made a double recipe. Used a little less oil and less vegetable stock (amount recommended for one recipe) Glad I did, I think it would have been to much liquid.

I didn't bother with the vegetable broth and just used hot water to soften the tomatoes. I added some left over grilled chicken to up the protein on this dish. And because I omitted the broth, I tossed the noodles with some extra olive oil. Great combination of flavor and even good the next day as a pasta salad.

Not very good at all.  Still edible, but barely.  Soaking the tomatoes in broth gave the tomatoes a smelly, almost sour dog-food like taste.  If this recipe had been prepared with sun-dried tomatoes in oil, it may have tasted a lot better.  I could have salvaged this pasta with some cream, cheese, and garlic or maybe some bottled alfredo sauce, but it was the healthiness of the ingredients that attracted me to this recipe in the first place. Overall, one of the worst recipes i have tried on this site.

Made this in a different way. Any type pasta, fryed some pine nuts with garlic and small amount of chilli, added sun dried toms and olives mixed in spinach at the end. Stir in the pasta and served some nice warm ciabetta. Was very nice!

So simple yet so delicious. I think I prefer oil packed tomatoes, but the broth that the dried ones had soaked in was a really good way to add some flavour to the pasta. With garlic bread and a salad it's a winner.

Good. Used frozen spinach because that was all I had -- will use fresh next time!

I like the combination of flavors and I feel the pine nuts are a must. It does require a lot of dishes, though, pots and pans etc.

Oooh yum - this recipe is really easy and good. I recommend Rapunzel brand veggie bouillon (it's even vegan) - then you don't have to open a can and not use the whole thing. Also I added more sun-dried tomatoes because 12 wasn't very many, and I'll definitely put in more spinach next time too. YUM

This is an easy to make, quick recipe that is great after a long day. It never disappoints. I always add more sun dried tomatoes and if I dont have fresh spinach I use the frozen. It is def. one of my go-to recipes.

I made this last night for dinner and loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe states, the only difference is that I used a little extra garlic and also added some chicken to make it a complete meal.  I sauteed cut up chicken with the garlic for a few min and then added an entire large bag of spinach.  After everything was mixed together I added some of the cheese and mixed that in and then topped each serving with a sprinkle of cheese.  Like another person suggested, I added a bit of EVOO to it to make sure the noodles to keep everything moist.  Also added a touch of salt to each serving.  Wonderful!

My husband and I love this recipe and we make it probably once every 2-3 weeks.  I have modified it a little though--I add spicy Italian sausage, fresh sliced mushrooms, and I subsitute fresh diced tomatoes for the sun-dried tomatoes (less expensive than sun-dried and easier to find).  I also don't use the vegetable broth; if I need a little liquid I add V8 tomato juice.  I top with feta cheese if I have it on hand.  Delish, and great leftovers!

I think this recipe is really good. I added 1/2 cup more cheese and it really needed more seasoning..so I added some salt and pepper. My husband says he hates spinach so when I asked him what he thought he said this is pretty good. So thank you for a great healthy recipe!

It was ok...I think I'm going to play with the veggies and maybe not use broth.  I know there's potential but it's just not there yet for me.

I made this recently when a vegetarian friend came over to dinner.  It was a hot day, and so I was looking for a vegetarian pasta dish that wasn't overloaded with cheese and butter - this was exactly what I was looking for.  I made it almost exactly as written, and it was wonderful:  just the right amount of spice from the red pepper flakes, freshness from the spinach, richness from the sun-dried tomatoes, and cruch from the pine nuts.  I used the tomatoes in oil, like many other reviewers, and it was delicious, but I think next time I might try using the dried, bulk tomatoes, since I think using the vegetable broth to rehydrate them might bring a really nice, complex flavor to the broth before it's used in the sauce.  Excellent recipe!

This recipe was awesome...Instead of an oil based sauce, I opted for a rosé sauce out of an enveloppe and I also added so diced chicken.  My husband is a meat and potatoe man and he said it was fantastic.

I loved the way the ingredients made each bite different.  I liked the tang of the sun dried tomatoes.  However, I would have liked the pasta to be in a creamier sauce.

This is really good. I didn't have pine nuts and used red pepper instead of red pepper flakes. Although I really enjoyed it, it is missing that wow factor that a recipe must have for me to give it 5 stars.

Very healthy and has a good flavor. I also added chicken to the garlic/red pepper flakes round, and may experiment with some fish next time.

I wouldn't write a review unless it was outstanding..trust me, this one IS!  The broth really sets the flavors and the red pepper gives it a little kick that makes it just perfect.  Seriously, I don't think I've had better pasta dishes in any Italian restaurant!

Yum!  Although I used a lot of pots and pans making this, it was quick and easy, and most importantly, delicious!  I've made different versions of this in the past, but the crushed red pepper flakes were a nice new touch.

Wonderful and very tasty. I used a bag of prewashed baby spinach for convenience and also used an extra garlic clove. I served with a nice crusty bread and salad. It was a hit with the whole family. This dish heats up nicely too.

This was terrific! I added the vegetable broth even though my SDT’s didn’t need it, along with some pesto that I had on hand. This totally added to the flavor that others said was lacking. Along with that I sliced in Davio’s delicious chicken Italian sausages! A green salad with big chunks of Reggiani Parmesan cheese Yum! I’m only giving it 4 * because of the additions I made that changed the original recipe.

This is a solid go-to recipe for a weeknight in my house.  Great flavor with the sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts and so easy to make!

This was okay, but lacked flavor.  Although, I did not add much red pepper flakes.

The recipe was pretty good. I loved the kick the red pepper gave the pasta, and since I used fresh tomatoes, the pepper really soaked into the tomatoes further improving the flavor! However, in order to serve my family of four, I had to double the recipe. Other than that, this recipe was very good.

I also used oil packed sun-dried tomatoes.  I added some quartered artichoke hearts and sliced Kalamata olives, at the very end.  Also used some fresh basil leaves, at the end and eliminated the broth.

Really delicious and easy to do.  I had everything, but the cheese so I omitted it.   I added spicy sausage and cream (due to lack of cheese).  Tasty and quick. A real winner.  The pine nuts were a great addition as well. Added a lot of interesting texture to the pasta.

Just made it,  and it was delish! I ended up not using the broth, just wasn't sure how it needed to be used. I used rotini a that is what I had and used sun dried tomatoes in oil b/c again, that's what I had. I put the garlic, spinach,  red pepper (may have put too much), with basil, parsley, black pepper, garlic and then added the sd tomatoes at the end. After tossing in with the pasta, I followed another reviewer and added a little lemon juice and it was perfect. It helped take the red pepper down a notch. Will make again... thank you!

I made this on a whim with a few variations since I didn't have all ingredients. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable an I did soak the sun dried tomatoes. I sautéed garlic onion red pepper flakes parsley basil and oregano. I added the spinach and cooked for s few minutes then added the broth and tomatoes. I also added a little half and half and parmesan to the sauce. I only had thin spaghetti so I tossed that in. It was delicious!!!

This is a great base to add your favorites,  I printed out the recipe and then read all the reviews and wrote down all the ingredient suggestions to have on file to change it up. Thank you much as this dish can be vegan, and for my husband who is not, can have his meat on the side! Although I didn't make it with meat and he ate 3 servings. Bravo!

We scrapped the pine nuts (too expensive for this one dish) and instead added a spicy grilled chicken breast. The result was a fantastic dinner!

Yum,but I did add a 12 oz bag of raw shrimp , peeled and deveined before the spinach. Cooked about 3 minutes stirring often. Removed then followed recipe. There was Not enough sauce so I popped another bouillon cube with a cup of water in the micro for 1 mi ute.  Then I added that as well as the shrimp to everything and it was delicious ,  definitely a  keeper!

Made the dish just as the recipe called for and it felt like it was lacking something, a little acidity maybe.  I will defiantly try some of the great suggestions that I've seen posted in the comments section!

I happened to have most of these ingredients just lying around taking up space so I decided to make it. Very glad I did. I used a lot more pepper flakes (on accident) and a little more garlic (which is only to be expected) and it turned out surprisingly delicious for a vegetarian dish. I'll try making it with chicken next time.

This was delicious!  I cut up some chicken breasts into bite size pieces, coated them with S&P and browned in some olive oil.  I removed them after done and added some more olive oil and cooked the garlic and red pepper and some basil in the same pan.  I doubled the garlic and red pepper.  I also used more chicken broth as needed than recipe called for since I added the chicken.  Wonderful.  Will make again.

I didn't have any penne pasta on hand so I substituted with tricolor rotini, otherwise, I made the recipe exactly as written.  Delicious! Even my husband, who doesn't like sun dried tomatoes, took seconds!

It was pretty good. I changed it a bit. I used julie ne cut sundried tomatoes in olive oil instead of the dried ones. First i toasted the pine nuts, then added the oil soaked sundried tomatoes. After cooking them together for about five minutes, i added two tablespoons of minced garlic, some dried basil, and some orégano. Then i chopped up the fresh spinach and mixed that in and cooked until all was flavorful and hot. Added another tbls of olive oil to drained pasta, poured on nuts tomatoes and spinach and mixed it all together with the pasta. We enjoy spices in our food and with those added this was very, very tasty.  We will be having it again soon, be sure of that!

This recipe looked like it would be so yummy, but I did add some boneless skinless chicken breast (cubed and sautéed in olive oil).  This was a very tasty dish, of course I added black pepper, garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I was a bit worried that it would be dry, but it was not.  My husband liked it, but the red pepper flakes were too much for him (even though I only used a small amount), next time I will add that on my plate.    I will definitely make this again, real soon.

Delicious!  You can add so many things for your tasting pleasure.  I followed the recipe but added chopped up portobello  mushrooms, to kinda trick my husband into thinking he was getting some meat! It worked, he liked it.  I didn't have pine nuts, so I used walnuts. It was so tasty, I will definitely make this again and again.  I might add shrimp next time!

Marvellous. I agree with some comments..skip wilting the spinach, skip the broth. Otherwise perfect as is. I added a bit of fresh basil, bit more oil,  maybe next time (oh yes there will be a next time) some sliced artichoke hearts. Tastes great and makes a lovely presentation.

I didn't have dried tomatoes so used canned diced ones, added more garlic and pepper flakes, black olives, omitted the nuts and forgot the cheese but it was great anyway and I am sure it would have been even better if I followed the recipe.  My entire family loved it and I will definitely make it again and again.

This was very good but like others, made some changes based on comments by others. I didn't cook the dried tomatoes in broth. I sauteed garlic and shallots in olive oil, then added dried tomatoes and mushrooms and cooked til soft. Didn't have any chili pepper flakes but would have used if I did. Had some left over chicken, chopped and added to the pan. Cooked the pasta and added to the pan mixing well.  Added fresh spinach leaves, squeezed fresh lemon juice from half lemon and mixed for a few minutes which softened the spinach. Grated fresh parmesan cheese on top, mixed in and served.  A quick, easy and tasty meal! Will use again. Thank you!

The 2 stars are for the recipe. This was a joke of a dish as it was presented. Used sun toms in olive oil, added sautéed broccoli rabe instead of spinach. Added clams and mussels and oil packed Italian tuna. Threw in some stewed tomatoes and rough chopped garlic cloves and capers.

This was a nice and easy and flavorful recipe. I doubled it since I was using a pound of pasta.  The sauce is a bit thin so might suggest some tomato paste or other thickener.  A bit more garlic and red pepper flakes added to the flavor.  I left out the pine nuts and used Romano cheese right into the pasta after mixing everything else together - which added to depth of flavor.  Added salt and cracked pepper also.  Tasty!

Really easy! I added ground chicken, mushrooms, and roasted peppers for fun and a non diary pesto for a little kick.

This is a firm favourite. I use oil packed tomatoes, which give a wonderful flavour. We love garlic so I always add a "little" more and I use chili flakes.  This is my youngest daughter's favourite meal so I make it quite often.

As always, I made this exactly as written except I used gluten-free pasta.

I did not like this at all.  It just did nothing for me.  Not nearly enough flavor.  I love all the ingredients, but the sauce had no flavor, so I added the cheese into it before I even put it on the table, something I never do because I am not that fond of grated cheese on my pasta.  Will not make again.

My family loved this one! I doubled all ingredients except the pasta and pine nuts. I also added chicken, cooked in same ingredients. The pine nuts make the flavor! Added lots of parm cheese once plated and served with italian bread. Yummy! Tx!

Made this last night for dinner but wanted a little protein in it. So browned some cut up skinless boneless chicken breasts before everything else. Added a splash of  cream and white wine for more of a sauce. Added chopped roasted walnuts and cheese(had no pine nuts) at the very end. Served over Penne  pasta. Was fun fooling around with this.

Made it exactly as written. Needed something. Good but not great. Went to work on it a bit to bring it in line with the family taste. Added a small bit of ham, mushrooms, toasted walnuts (hey, my family loves them) bell pepper and then added Cajun seasonings. Family loves it now. This is a good recipe to build on. Made it while living in China with Chinese noodles except for cheese which is hard to find there. Went over very well there.

This was delicious. I especially liked the fact that there was not a lot of sauce as I don't care for a plethora of tomato sauce on my pasta. The only change I made was to add some small slices of pepperoni type sausage which satisfied our need for meat in most main dishes. Will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe twice now; the first time as written, and the second time to my taste.
First time: I decided that reconstituting the sundried tomatoes took away from the tart taste that I associated with sd tomatoes. I also added the pine nuts, which have never been a favorite, and still aren't. Didn't feel there was enough garlic or crushed pepper (hey, I'm Latina; gotta have me some heat and flavor!). Overall impression? Meh....
Second time: Sauteed a chicken breast, then added the other ingredients to the same pan. Used julienne-sliced sd tomatoes (softened during cooking). Omitted the pine nuts altogether. Doubled all of the remaining ingredients, then tossed with the cooked pasta and freshly shaved Parmesan.
LOVE my version so much more, but the original recipe was a good starting point.

It was pretty good. I followed a few suggestions from other reviews. I doubled the recipe, used oil sun dried tomatoes, added mushrooms and cream. Not hard to make vegan.

I used chicken broth, sun dried tomatoes soaked in oil, used 3 garlic cloves, doubled the red pepper flakes, added lemon juice, 3 oz cream cheese, and excluded the pine nuts. My boyfriend and I loved it! Will definitely make again. Definitely a new favorite.

We make this on the regular and love it. We do add ground spicy Italian sausage after making the pine nuts golden brown in the hot pan and add the garlic and spinach straight into the browned meat. It's even good the next day! :)

Hmmm, this did not work for me. Granted, I omitted a few ingredients so that may be why. I'm not a fan of pine nuts and I didn't have any Parmesan cheese on hand so I made it without that. I found this recipe really really spicy with not a lot of other flavor profiles. It was like all spice and no richness. I would not make this dish again.

Very  good, I was unsure of the Vegetable broth but it really surprised me. The Parmesan cheese is a must for me! I used 8oz  of pasta and 10oz of spinach (my  small town doesn't have much on produce) and the proportions  came out perfect. enough to feed four and a little left for seconds!!

This was a great, family-friendly, vegetarian recipe! I made it as recommended and really enjoyed it.  It was more flavorful than I expected.  I do think I'll add in some artichokes or some vegetarian chicken  for variety  next time.  I will definitely be making it again!

I agree with the other reviewers, I omitted the veggie broth, used sun dried toms in oil, doubled the garlic, added a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts (olive oil and lemon and black pepper) with the chili pepper flakes ( 1 teaspoon) and sautéed for a few minutes, then before putting sauté on pasta, I tossed in 3-4 tblspoon of fresh basil chopped and bit size pieces of spinach (1 large bundle rinsed). I did not let the greens wilt much, just enough to warm spinache (about 30 seconds or so). Then poured everything on hot pasta with a squeeze of lemon, tossed and served!

Was lucky to see this recipe and made a few changes where I got to skip some steps and still came out amazing. Instead of using sun dried tomatoes, I substituted Sun Dried Tomato Pesto sauce with Pine Nuts made by Bella Sun Luci (at Smith's/Kroger Foods). I cooked some chicken Italian sausage in with a cup of water and chicken broth with a splash of Merlot after most of the water was steamed away. The wine made the water boil off faster, so beware. Set it aside. Then followed the directions for sauteed garlic, spinach, and adding the above tomato pesto. Cooked until Spinach wilted then added the Chicken sausage back in to reheat on medium flame approx 5 minutes. Cooked Penne as directed. Mixed together on the plate. Topped with Feta Cheese instead of Parmesan. Took about 30 minutes total. Thanks for this recipe. Made the wife's day!

It was SOOOO good! I bet it would be fantastic with some sauteed sausage in it, too. I will definitely make it again!

I loved this recipe.  I used large egg noodles and arugula instead of spinach.  It was one of the best pastas I have ever made.  My boyfriend usually doesn't like pasta but he loved this one.

This was quick, easy and delicious. I didn't have pine nuts so I used walnuts. I think they tasted great. I also had already chopped sun dried tomatoes, so I was able to just put them and the broth directly into the pan with the spinach.

I made some changes based on what I had in the house. I used a jar of sun dried tomatoes in oil, so I skipped the first step. I added some extra garlic and used just a bit of chicken broth. Very very delicious!

I am sorry for giving this a one star but I am not impressed at all. It was so dry after I made it and it had no flavor. I had to start adding a bunch of other ingredients so my family would eat it. I did follow the recipe exactly. The recipe sounded tasty but I didn't like it at all! Sorry.

Quite good overall and I will make it again.  I think this is a good base recipe which anyone can tweak to make their own special spin.

I did add chicken to this for a much needed protein. Next time I'm going to add a ton more spinach and chop up the sun dried tomatoes a little.  One other option I'm considering is doing a Lemon Butter sauce to this.

Deeeee-licious!!  I made it this morning to have for lunch and could not stop tasting it.  I did a couple of things slightly different but not much.  I used 2 (large) Cloves of Garlic instead of one, and I used Chicken Stock (Bullion) instead of Vegetable because I was out of Vegetable.  And because I have been trying to eat healthier, I used Whole Wheat Penne instead of white pasta.  Yum!!  This is definitely a Keeper and I will make it often.

Good recipe but I think may need a little more tweaking for a bit more of a pop. One thing I did not care for in the recipe was the measuring "12 sun dried tomatoes...bunch of spinach" the tomatoes available to me were already pre cut making the estimation difficult and personally i do not know what one bunch of spinach refers to. That's just me though, if I decide to make this a second time I'll have a better idea on quantity. The only change I made was by adding about a table spoon of fresh lemon juice at the end when tossing the pasta.

I made this recipe last night and my husband and I loved it! We first sautéed the garlic in olive oil then put broth, red pepper and tomatoes in the same skillet until softened (we used fresh tomatoes). Then threw the spinach in there near the end. We threw it on whole grain speghetti noodles and topped with Parmesan cheese and Oregano. We didn't have any pine nuts but would like to try it with some next time.

I enjoyed this recipe very much! I added 3 cloves of garlic instead of one and also 1 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of 1/4 tsp (I like things spicy). Very easy recipe and tasted very good! I also love spinach so next time I would add a whole bag of spinach (about double compared to the recipe). Thanks!

Excellent with these changes.  Tomatoes in oil, use the oil for more flavor.  Add diced Kalamata Olives and white wine.  Also some of the water from the pasta for the right sauce consistency.  Next time I add some grilled chicken breast.

A recipe will always get 5 stars when all 3 kids plus the adults enjoy.  I did get oil packed sun dried tomatoes to save time and used chicken broth on hand as the reserved liquid.  This was a great post-swim team practice, week night dinner for my family.

I skipped the pine nuts to save money and the bother of toasting. Used sundried tomatoes in olive oil (drained) rather than reconstituting. We had tortellini on hand so used that. Easy recipe- liked by all.

The original recipe needed a few tweaks. It calls for only 8 oz. of penne pasta, but that was not enough for my family of four, so I'll be doing 16 oz. in the future. I used 1 cup of canned diced tomatoes as a subtitute for both the veg. broth and the sun-dried tomatoes which tasted devine! Adding in feta cheese when I combined all the ingredients also added a kick to the flavor. I will definitely be making my revised version again!

I have tried several meatless pasta dishes and this is the first one I have liked! We are huge garlic lovers so I added more. Also has some mushrooms that needed to be used before they went bad and I added them as well. This is a great recipe to add extra veggies too! Will make again!!

This is a family favorite!!  My kids are very picky!  In fact my daughter doesn't eat anything green.  She LOVES this dish.  I do leave out the pine nuts just as personal preference.  I also use sun-dried tomatoes in oil and cut into smaller pieces.

This pasta turned out great!  I didn't have vegetable stock so used chicken stock and it tastes great.  I wish I had made some chicken though to toss with it.  The peppers give it a real bite, if you like hot!

Love it! Added some turkey bacon, corn, peas, and finally added a hint of lemon juice with the parmesan, and wow, this had people going for seconds and thirds. Yum!

It was good. I also added mushrooms, and omitted the broth (I didn't have any) instead I just rehydrated the SDtomatoes in a few tbsp's of boiling water and added them and the water for some flavor. Also added black olives and just a TAD of seasoning salt as the spinach causes the dish to need some saltiness. Have made before... it's better with chicken ;)

I used a jar of sun dried tomatoes in oil based on other suggestions.  I also used a little white wine towards the end and I put grilled shrimp on top! Delicious!

good basic recipe!  to add a kick, modified by using a big heap of chili flakes, 5 garlic cloves and home-made chicken stock from the freezer (instead of veggie broth).

My husband and I rated this 7 out of 10.  It was very good, very tasty.  This dish was easy to make and the ingredients were easy to work with.  I would definetly make this again however I would leave out the red pepper flakes and the pine nuts.  I'm looking forward to having the left overs at lunch!

This is a wonderful dish!  I had some Italian Sweet Sausage patties that I had cooked.  I cut them up and added them making this dish a complete meal.  I love the toasted pine nuts and the fresh spinach too!  I had some left-overs and looking forward to lunch.  Enjoy!!!

Amazing pasta dish though i made many changes. 1) i doubled the red pepper flakes in the initial cooking and then added more on top of the cheese 2) i quadrupled the garlic 3) i used the olive oiled sun dried tomatoes in the bottle that were already chopped 4) i am a veg freak so i added red and orange bell pepper as well as red onion 5) i added a shake of paprika, salt, ground black pepper and italian seasoning  great dish. Really, the best one ive ever made. I even used frozen spinach and it was good

This was excellent!  I added thinly sliced shallots and some crispy finely crumbled bacon.  I used 2 lbs of spinach, 2x as many tomatoes, extra garlic and pine nuts and 14 oz of veg. broth plus about a 1/2 cup of white wine in order to get enough liquid.  Thanks for the great recipe! I will definitely make this again!

Sorry Madball...this one didn't work for me.  I gave it two stars only because a few of the 14 people I made it for, said it was OK.  I found it barely edible. I even tried adding some Barilla pasta sauce to it, which helped, but it was still very bland.

I could only find oil packed sun dried tomatoes so I rinsed the tomatoes in water and drained them.  Next time I make this I will add capers and black olives.

Good base recipe.  I agree with the other reviewer and prefer a little more 'sauce', I had some sun dried tomatoe butter on hand, so I added a little of that with equal amount of whipping cream and it gave it a creamier texture.

This was good-not great. Its very lite in flavor and kinda boring made as written. I did like the sun dried tomatoes and the spinach. Makes a nice side dish with grilled chicken .

A quick and easy meal to assemble.  I added a large chicken breast, which I chopped into small pieces, and about a cup of fined chopped mushrooms.  I used medium shells in place of penne (because that's what I had on hand).  I served it with salad and bread and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  It might have been a bit better with more of a sauce.

Good simple, quick dish.  I add chicken when I have it.  Not sure why you would cook chicken and pasta together and give the recipe a bad review........    Reviewed: Jul. 29, 2009 Pasta didn't cook all the way without the chicken being overdone. I suggest cooking the pasta separately and then adding it in with the spinach. There wasn't much flavor to this dish.

No flavor unless you have a tomato bite.  Sauce is way thin.  Tastes like plain noodles with sundried tomatoes.

The family thought it was good, I thought it was blah. I added feta cheese since it had sort of a Mediterranean taste to it anyway, and that made it a little better.

We like this, but it's not our favorite spinach/pasta recipe on this site.  I had sun-dried tomatoes in oil and chicken broth to use up, so I used those instead of the called for ingredients.  I used less pasta, and would use more pine nuts if I make it again.

This was fantastic! VERY easy and quick. I didn't have pine nuts on hand, and didn't think we would miss them, but I think that nutty flavor would add a lot to the recipe. I had the sun dried tomatoes in oil from Costco, so I boiled them in broth to get some of the oil off and then diced. I added about 3/4 of the broth to the spinach mixture, then added the noodles and let simmer for about 3-4 minutes and this was perfect. The heat from the pepper flakes and the other flavors co-mingle perfectly!!

This was DELISH!  I used a lot of spinach- fresh from my CSA- and used 2 full cups of chicken broth.  To the sauce I added about 3 tbsp of butter to the sauce to thicken it up a little bit.  This was SOOOO good!  Great flavor, nice and spicy!  YUM!!!!

Pretty good, more of a pasta salad side dish than a main dish.  Needed salt and some Italian seasoning to bring it to life. Won't make it again.

Very good! It sounded a bit bland, so I went ahead and added 3 cloves of garlic, and artichoke hearts and salt to taste.  Next time, I will add more artichoke hearts and more sun-dried tomatoes!  Even my picky children, who are getting quite used to my love of non-mainstream foods, enjoyed this meal.  We will make it again!

I used white wine in place of broth, and didn't have as many sundried tomatoes as I would have liked in the recipe on hand, so I added in some chopped fresh roma tomatoes at the very end. I also added some bite size pieces of chicken which I cooked on the stove with about 1 Tbsp. of olive oil and some garlic and diced onions. My boyfriend, who does not like spinach or tomatoes, ate it up and told me I should make it again soon.

This recipe was amazing! I made it for dinner last night and my husband loved it. We made it a 2nd time and added cut up chicken. We buy this microwaveable chicken from Wal-Mart. Cooked it up and put it in. Made it more awesome! Thanks for posting it!

Delicious! Have been looking for pasta recipes without red or heavy white sauce and this was it. I did skip broth as I only has oil soaked tomatoes, and I had sliced mushrooms to use up which provided liquid. Also added some salt free spice mix and as always used whole wheat pasta. An easy and versitile recipe.  Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!! What a delightful change from heavy cream based pastas. I added 4 slices of turkey bacon to give it some added flavor. Delicious!!

I make a similar recipe and noticed that alot of people notes a lack of flavor and that the pasta was too dry. Try adding italian salad dressing to it a little at a time until coated and flavorful! Hope many of you find this info helpful!

Great quick, easy, and adaptable recipe for a low-fat dinner.  I doubled the garlic, used sliced summer squash instead of spinach since that's what we had on hand, and added 1/2 t. Trader Joe's pasta seasoning.  Topped with a toasted bread crumbs and a sprinkle of dried parsley along with the parmesan.  Next time I may add garbanzo beans for (vegetarian) protein.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great tasting dish.  Used canned sundried tomatoes and used the oil instead of olive oil for added taste.  Used cashews instead of pine nuts and it worked well too

This dish was delicious. I omitted the pine nuts and used fresh basil, which gives a really nice flavor. All the ingredients blend well on this dish. I will make it again.

This was delicious. Used sun-dried tomatoes in oil instead of the dehydrated. Forgot to add the Parmesan, but it didn't even matter! Served it with steak.

This was an easy and tasty dish!  I added extra garlic and next time I will add a little more broth and white wine to get more of a sauce.

Very disappointing.  It may have been the tomatoes we purchased, but they were so strong I could only stomach a few bites.  The pasta in the picture appeared to be orange-tinted, so I had been expecting at least some sauce - there was none, the pasta itself was bone dry and flavorless.  The ingredients looked fantastic, but it didn't come together for us.

I had some sun-dried tomato and ricotta stuffed pasta medallions that I was looking to use and when I happened upon this recipe, I couldn't resist!  I only had chicken broth so used that.  I had sauteed some mushrooms and zucchini to go alongside as I needed to use them up and decided at the end to just throw them in with this dish.  I was disappointed that I had run out of parm (crazy!), but it was still fabulous.  Added some spicy grilled sausage that were originally to be served alongside too, yummy!

This is a good, quick recipe. I would not omit the pepper flakes, I would adjust to taste if you do not like heat, as without them I think the recipe would be way too bland.

my father has hypertension and i picked this as our meal for the night. he's not allowed to eat salt much so this was perfect! i was afraid it might be bland because he doesn't eat garlic/onions/meat for religious reasons either. it was absolutely fantastic though! this is definitely something i will be making for him more often. it's easy and it's yummy. i'm usually someone who prefers very strong flavors but i was very surprised that i enjoyed it! thank you for this recipe.

he mentioned that next time i could probably add some baby broccoli, fresh tomatoes, or mushrooms as well. i think i'll try that next time, but if you don't have a lot of ingredients at hand, this is wonderful as is.

I thought this dish had good flavoring.  The pine nuts were especially tasty.  
It seemed like the amount of spinach called for seems like a lot when you're cutting it, but once it gets in the pan and whilts, you realize it's actually not overkill. 
I added chicken to my version and it blended in with the rest just fine.
Between the boiling of the sundried tomatoes, the pasta, and pan, the recipe does seems to make a lot of dishes, though.  At least it's for a good meal.

This was a pretty good recipe, one that I'll definitely make again.  I cut back on the red pepper flakes, which was a mistake because the dish needed that full flavor.  I used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes because that's what I had on hand, but it added extra oil to the vegetable broth.  Even with the extra oil removed, I only needed about 1/3 cup of the broth.  The dish would have been too soupy if I'd added the rest.  Next time I'll try adding something else to it -- maybe feta cheese or chopped olives.

This recipe is a good base for all the other ingredients I added---including white beans, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and eggplant. With all of those additions, it made a good main dish. I think I'll add chicken or steak next time. I really liked the suggestion to boil the sun dried tomatoes. I did the same to the eggplant.

My family really liked this.  I made a few changes to suit my family.  For the sauce I used frozen chopped spinach, sun dried tomatoes in herbs and oil, mushrooms, chicken broth, doubled the garlic, and added fat free half and half.  I pureed the sauce so that my kids would eat it.  Great way to get some extra veggies in.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love sundried tomatoes but I think 12 is too many for this recipe bk it was pretty salty. I would add more vegetable broth, more spinach and less sundried tomatoes. It generally has a great flavor tho.

This was good but I agree with some of the other reviews in that it seemed to missing something. I threw in a twist and added some roasted red pepper alfredo sauce that obviously changed the nature of the dish but tasted really good with the other ingredients.

I expected this to be much better than it was, given that I like all of the ingredients.  I used a 9 oz. bag of baby spinach.  Next time I will try a thawed 10 oz. package of frozen spinach and a little less broth and a little more cheese.

This is a quick and yummy dinner. I had some leftover crawfish in the fridge that I added that gave it a little extra flavor and kick. Mushrooms are great added to this recipe as well.

This was really good tasting and has a light, healthy appeal. The only thing I would do differently is to cut the recipe in half. I made this for my husband and myself and we just had too much left over pasta. Other than that, this was simple and delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Yum!!! This dish was awesome! I loved every bite of it and there was only a little bit for leftovers the next day (very disappointing... next time I'll have to make more). The recipe was very easy to follow (although it did dirty up a lot of pans). I did as other reviewers suggested and added a little bit of leftover chicken, artichoke hearts, mushrooms and sprinkled with feta cheese. My hubby couldn't stop raving about this dish and he had 3 plates worth (he was moaning in pain later). I will definitely make this recipe again and again. Thank you Madball for the excellent recipe!

Very good!  My husband made this for us and it was really nice-I especially like the pine nuts.  We'll definitely make it again!

My husband loved this. I thought it was ok. Not enough flavor for me. The pine nuts were delicious in this pasta. I would definitely not substitute any other type of nut. Will make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I did modify it a bit by adding feta, grilled chicken, basil and lemon zest.  I also added a quarter of a cup of Marsala to the chicken stock to add a bit more flavor! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious....a definite "comfort meal!"  Full, flavorful, and easy....the perfect combo.  I added a bit of cream and cornstarch to the sauce, just to thicken it up a bit, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly.  Highly recommended!

I thought this was delicious. I added feta cheese and chopped basil and omitted the parmesan. I served a large amount and it vanished quickly. The pepper flakes added a really nice complexity. The spinach was also a nice addition.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was quite good.  I think next time I will add mushrooms and take out the crushed red pepper (we like spicy but didn't seem necessary with all the other great flavors).  But a tasty, healthy and quick recipe is always welcome in my collection :)

Very good!  I added olives, pre-cooked chicken, some italian dressing and chopped artichoke hearts.  My husband raved that it was his favorite pasta dish yet!

This was delicious.  Great flavor but also very light.  The only change I made was that I used sun-dried tomato ravioli instead of regular pasta.  I would recommend doing that as the ravioli goes well with the light sauce.

I followed the directions except had to use walnuts instead of pine (all I had).  This was wonderful and fun to make.

This was amazing!  We wanted to go out to dinner last night, but are trying to watch our budget, so I made this -- it was better than pasta dishes I have had in many good Italian restaurants.  I omitted the pine nuts (didn't have any) and added a little chicken.

Delicious!  I melted the cheese into the pasta rather than just sprinkling it on top by adding it in just before pouring the warm sauce over the noodles.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth since that was all I had on hand. This dish is so convenient... it only took 15 minutes to make!!

This was such a pretty and tasty dish, and it was really pretty simple to make although you do dirty a few dishes. I used WW spaghetti instead of the pasta and it worked out just fine. I used 1/2 t of red pepper flakes and I think I might even up that a little next time. I did add 1 large diced chicken breast to the pan with the pine nuts/pepper/oil, just to have a bit of meat in the dish. I served with the Basil and Sun Dried Tomato Bread recipe from this site, that I made into rolls. Everything was great, thanks for a beautiful and tasty dish.

I didn't think this pasta had much flavor. Seemed like it needed more spice to it. Probably wouldn't make again.

I wasn't blown away with this recipe. Perhaps if I had used oil packed sundried tomatoes, but I didnt find that the recipe allowed for enough moistening time for the tomatoes, and I didnt enjoy the texture. I would recommend increasing the soaking time. Favours were ok, but not very strong. I found myself being bored within a few bites of this dish. Make sure to add lots of pepper flakes to give it some punch!

I liked this dish, and my husband really enjoyed it. I used a bag of pre-washed baby spinach, and added diced chicken with the garlic. It was a tasty, light meal.

Delicious quick & easy--My boyfriend loved it! I made the sauce for Gnocci--very favorful--next time I am going to add Shrimp or Scallops.
