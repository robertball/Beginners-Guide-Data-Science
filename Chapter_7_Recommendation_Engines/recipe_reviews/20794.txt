Very Good! I also changed the recipe a bit as did some of the other reviewers. I added some minced garlic and onion to the broccoli. I used tofu that had been frozen, thawed, drained, and then crumbled (it ends up looking something like shredded chicken) because I prefer the texture of tofu prepared this way to that of plain tofu. I piled the brocolli and tofu mixture onto toasted wheat bread for an open face sandwhich. I will definately make this again!

This recipe was good, but didn't have zip.  Along with the broccoli, I added diced onion, minced garlic and a squirt of hot sauce.  It lengthens the prep time, but it zips!

This sandwich would probably be ALOT better if you chilled the broccoli and tofu first...but i put it right into the pita, and it ripped a hole in the bottom and the dressing got really watery and didnt have much flavor.  I was pretty disappointed

This was surprisingly tasty.  My husband who is very picky when it comes to tofu also liked this.  I made sure the tofu was crumbled up rather then cubed.  I wanted to keep it simple so just added a few spices to the broccoli while it was cooking like garlic and onion powder.

I needed a quick vegetarian meal for my daughter.  Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews for this.  It was really quite bland as it was.  I will definatly try this again with some of the suggested changes such as garlic and onion...maybe a little green or red pepper.  I bet it would be great with flavoured tofu as well.

Great mix, but quite dry. I had to add lots of extra dressing to moisten it up.

I cooked this for dinnertonight. I also added some minced garlic green onion and cilantro. I lined the pita bread with fresh spinach and topped it all with ceaser salad dressing. Very very good.

This was a good basic recipe.  I, like several others, made some changes.  I reduced the amount of veg. oil and added sesame oil for flavor.  And I used a sesame ginger marinade instead of Thousand Island.  You have to make sure you really press the tofu to get the extra fluid out.  I will definitely use the recipe again, and I will change it depending on what I have available.  Good building block.  Thanks for posting it.

I loved these.  I used sesame-ginger salad dressing since that's what I had in my fridge, and they turned out really well.  Even my wife, a tofu-hater, said these were "pretty good."  I think next time I'll add some brown rice for bulk and to stretch the tofu a bit.  I also froze and thawed the tofu as someone else suggested, which made very nice crumbles.

This recipe was about average.  I just made it once and it's not one I would just 'have' to make again.  I substituted a creamy italian dressing for the thousand island and left out the pita (low carb diet).  It was okay.

After experimenting with tofu all week I could tell that as written we were not going to love the treatment of tofu here. We are big meat eaters so I knew I needed to treat this one a little differently. I made another recipe with my other half of the block of tofu earlier tonight which was coated in a few different things prior to tossing in the skillet and it turned out really good. With that in mind I decided to toss the tofu cubes in crushed up saltine crackers for this one and it worked perfectly for us. I simply fried the broccoli up first and while that was draining I fried up the tofu cubes on high real quick. The recipe submitter mentions to use salad dressing of choice and my choice was one I grew up on. The brand is Otts and it is labeled as a French dressing  but it is a dark French and more like a Russian type dressing. This turned out excellent and even better than the awesome recipe I made earlier tonight. I do however recommend giving your tofu a little more love than what this recipe calls for.

I'm vegan so I made the thousand island dressing from scratch using vegan mayo, ketchup, relish, sugar, vinegar, and salt. All in all a yummy twist.
