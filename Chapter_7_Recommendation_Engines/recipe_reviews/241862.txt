Whoa! this is the bomb. i always wanted to make my own icecream but never ever had enough room in my freezer for the container. i cut this recipe in half, as i didn't want too much left over. i'm diabetic and shouldn't be eating such awesomeness! but i just had to try it and it very very good. i used a french vanilla cake mix and added just a tad of vanilla bean paste from one of my vanilla beans. the combinations are endless! my son wanted the recipe, and when i showed it to him he said "that's it...it's better than hagen daz"!  i'll put up a photo, but it just doesn't do it justice (i don't take very good photos). thank you Emygrant for a great recipe!
...i've just made this for the second time, used non fat evaporated milk plus the sugar stated in the submitter's notes. added, toasted walnuts, semi-sweet choc chips and toffee bits!  STILL THE BOMB! :)

Made this for a Memorial Day gathering and the four star rating is based on what others thought because my personal taste rating would have been two stars. It is an easy recipe to prepare.  I whipped the whipping cream for 3 minutes and then folded in the sweetened condensed milk and the 1 1/4 cups of FunfettiÂ® cake mix, poured the mixture into a loaf pan, inserted pan inside a ziplock freezer bag and froze for 24 hours. It scooped up and served nicely.  My chief complaint is I did not like the taste of eating overly sweet cake mix batter. If I make it again, I will make some modifications on the ingredients especially the amount of the cake mix.

OMG!  This is even better than the premium brands of "Birthday Cake" ice cream.  I used a regular yellow cake mix and added some Christmas colored sprinkles, as that's what I had on hand.  I also added some cake chunks (had those in the freezer from a previous "project").  This stuff is awesome!  Can't wait to try with some different flavored cake mixes.  I have a "cinnamon bun" flavored mix that I bought recently...the flavor sounded so good...didn't know what I was going to do with it at the time, but now I know...and that flavor is next!  Thanks Emygrant for a fabulous recipe.  I won't be buying those premium brands any more.

Super easy recipe. It was very creamy but it was definitely overly sweet for my family. The hubs and daughter both love super sweet treats and both agreed that it was too sweet. If I try this again, I will double the amount of whipping cream and leave other ingredients the same.

I liked this, but I have to agree w/ Shearone about the overly sweet cake mix taste. Also, I felt it left a thick, slightly gritty texture in my mouth. I don't think the kids cared too much for this, which totally surprised me b/c they LOVE ice cream, but they all had leftovers in their bowls (very unusual). I do want to play around with this more to see what I can come up with b/c I love the idea of it and it was super simple to make. Thanks for sharing. :)

The flavor was definitely good & rich but something seemed off. Maybe the consistency or texture? It set up well, scooped perfectly, was light in weight but felt heavy/thick eating, if that makes sense. I am interested in trying it without the cake mix batter, and maybe just the cream, condensed milk, and vanilla.
