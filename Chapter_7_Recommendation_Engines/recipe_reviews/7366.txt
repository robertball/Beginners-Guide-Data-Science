My family has been making this cake for years. We love it! The only difference is 
that we don't add the seeds. We also make  the chocolate version, although the
sherry flavor doesn't come through as much. Be sure and use decent sweet sherry
and not cooking sherry. Delicious subtle nutty flavor from the sherry!

This is the most flavorful and EASY cake to make!  I omit the poppy seeds, and add a ribbon of 1/4 c chopped walnuts, 1/2 c sugar and 2 T brown sugar and 2 T cinnamon to the middle.  I just pour 1/2 the batter in the pan, sprinkle the mixture over the batter, and pour the rest on top.  Same baking.  Adds a nice touch, especially if you like a hint of cinnamon!!

This is delicious, simple, & fast - what more could we ask for?  Make it in a decorative bundt pan (I use Williams-Sonoma's cathedral pan) with a dusting of confectioner's sugar, and you have a dessert which will stand up in any company.  Note:  my variation of this recipe uses two boxes of instant pudding, and also includes 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.

I just l0ve this cake and sp does every one who has tasted it!  You can make any flavor of cake you want and play around with the recipe by changong the puddin flavor compared to the cake.  A favorite is chocolate cake mix with banana or caramel pudding.  Evening trying different types of Sherry adds just a bit of a different kick to it.  Awesome recipe!!!

I did not have the sherry for this so made a small adjustment but this cake was a huge hit with adults and kids alike! I will make this again for sure!
