I substituted butter for oil bcos ran out of butter, so it was a little dry. Though I wonder if it'd be moist with butter. I made 8 regular sized cupcakes with the recipe, which I followed most of it except for butter, buttekrill replaced with plain fresh milk and red colouring with strawberry emulco (paste). It tasted very nice with the paste. I had to add 2 tbps to get the colour I liked, and added a little less than 2-thirds of sugar. I liked the frosting for awhile, until it deflates after awhile. I put the rest in the fridge and hope that it'll be moist.

This recipe is great. However, I had to add 1/2 cup more milk (or buttermilk) because the batter was too thick. I also made 12 regular sized cupcakes out of this recipe instead of mini cupcakes. The meringue is amazing!
