Also, another helpful tip with kingfish.  To take away the strong fishy taste, soak the fish in milk for several hours before cooking or, if you plan on freezing the fish, fill a ziplock bag with half water and half milk and freeze.  This will also help take away the strong taste of the fish.

Your captain must be used to long trips! We dispensed with the two days of soaking in water and did just fine. Our fish had been caught and fileted 24 hrs. earlier, kept in ziplock bags in ice. We simply skinned the filet, marinated in Wishbone Italian for maybe one hour, then grilled in the Weber kettle for maybe 20 minutes. Also sauteed some trimmings. All were superb! The fish was more tender and mild than I remember from store-bought Kingfish!

This is a delicious recipe and so easy.  I have cooked far more elaborate recipes for fish that weren't as tasty.  A real keeper.

If you really want to bleach out a King Fish soak the fillets in lemon juice and salt with enough water to cover completely over night. This gives you very white fish with a lemon taste.

I had four kingfish (roughly 20 lbs of meat), and knew this needed to be fresh. This meant skipping all the water stuff and going straight into the dressing. Marinaded most for an hour, but even just a half hour worked and fed an entire fraternity house with left overs. It's beat most of my more elaborate fish dishes and gotten to like fish who didn't like it before.

Definitely not my thing and I used fish that I had caught hours before so it was guaranteed fresh.

Did it after being frozen for a couple of months. Used a raspberry Italian, and it added a fantastic touch of sweetness!
