Great recipe! This was so easy and a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken. I cut the recipe in half and used Hellman's light mayo. I loved the lemon and garlic combination! I might use the filling and dressing in a spinach wrap next time.

Excellent and simple recipe! I love meals like this because they make me feel like I am on vacation or eating out! I added about a teaspoon of fresh mint to the sauce for our Mediterranean tastes. If I were to make this again, I would substitute yogurt for the mayonnaise (and probably whip up an osmosis contraption to drain the moisture from the cucumber because I'm a nerd like that and SCIENCE IS FUN AND TASTY!).

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to use up some rotisserie chicken we had left over and I'm glad I gave this a try.  The sauce was sooo full of flavor, the garlic gave it the right amount of kick!  I shredded my cloves over a small grater/zester, so much easier to handle that way.  Next time I don't want to heat up the kitchen on a hot day, I'm making these delicious sandwiches!  Don't be afraid to fill that pita up with spinach, YUM!

THE CHICKEN GYRO TASTED OK.  BUT I WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE SAUCE AND USED YOGURT INSTEAD OF MAYO.

This was pretty good for being so easy to make. I bought a rotisserie chicken to use and added extra garlic & pepper to the sauce. Think I over did it a little though, this sauce should be light and refreshing & mine came out quite spicy. I still loved it though.

I really liked this.  I did follow the suggestion of tossing the chicken WITH the dressing before serving rather than just topping the meat with it.  I had no lemon for the juice or zest so, I subsitituted margarita mix and this still tasted so good.  Mike really liked it too.  Had the fresh spinach and a chopped tomato.  We had it in the pita bread but, putting in a tortilla would be good as a wrap too, probably.  Will make again.

Very good and easy, but did not wow me. Don't get me wrong, it was quite tasty but I had higher hopes being as the recipe came from Bobby Flay. I will probbly make this again, but next time I will toss the chicken and veggies together with the sauce before filling the pita for more even coverage. I think this concept would work well with any meat or poultry, mixed greens and creamy dressing. Endless possibilities.

The Tzatziki sauce was good for how easy it was compared to the real thing, but it still tasted like an imitation.  Next time, I'll take the time to prepare the sauce using yogurt instead of mayonnaise.

The cucumber sauce was awesome (I didn't have lemon, but substituted with lime.  Also, I used half Chobani plain greek yogurt, and half Canola oil mayo from Hellmans.  Even with these substitutions, it was delicious).  The reason I'm giving this recipe 3 stars is because there was no marinade recipe for the chicken (I did marinade my chicken in some lemon, olive oil, salt, pepper, & oregano).  Knowing that I don't like just "grilled" chicken for my gyros/shwarmas, I went to look for a recipe.  Because it was lacking that part of the recipe that I felt should have been included, that is why I'm giving it 3 stars.

I love a Gyros and was excited to have found this recipe....even begged my hubby to let me make it (he hates spinch).  This was NOT delicious.  The sauce tasted NOTHING like a gyro sauce....I am way sad that it didn't go over well in our home.
