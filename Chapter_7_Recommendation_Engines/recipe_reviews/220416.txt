I love how simple this recipe is.  This is just plain comfort food.  It all comes together so quickly too.  I weighed the 4 oz of egg noodles and measured them - it was about 2 cups in my large glass pyrex measuring cup.  Remember your soup will only be as good as your broth / stock.  Enjoy!

Excellent! I used Chef John's roasted chicken stock recipe and the schmalz (chicken fat) from the roasted chicken for making this soup. Next time I might try adding some frozen peas  at the same time that the chicken is added.

Awesome!!! We love this soup, all I had was 2 quarts of regular chicken broth, but I went back to the store and bought one more quart of chicken stock because we like the extra liquid in our soup, the stock makes the difference. Perfect for a day you don't want to do alot of cooking. Thx

I always save my rotisserie ckn carcasses after I trim off the leftover meat @ freeze that in a separate pkg with the carcass. Broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn. Pretty much followed the recipe & added trimmings at the end.  Great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck. Your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you're like me you have them in the fridge anyways. A pot of soup for no extra cost!  If I'm not going to serve right away I cook the noodles separate.  If they're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth.  So I just toss them in when I'm reheating the soup.

I love it when cooks change the recipe so much and then complain/say it is great - not!  That being said, this was superb totally as is.  I made it for my kids and they slurped it up and were sad when it was gone.  A total comfort food.  I have never made broth from scratch, usually use bouillon to enhance my stock, but this was the first time I didn't need to and I felt like a real chef!

My hubby is under the weather this weekend so i made this soup for him. I followed the receipe as posted but added some LOVE and it was PERFECT!!!!! I have never been a fan of chicken noodle soup because of the bland taste, but this one is hands down the best i have ever had. It was also easy to make which is always good during this busy time of year. Thanks Chef John!

Changed a couple of things.  Poached the chicken breasts with a little olive oil, celery and onion with chicken granules and four cups of water.  Brought it to a boil and then turned off the stove; one hour later perfectly poached chicken.  Shredded the chicken and sieved the ingredients from the broth.  Used the chicken and the broth with some homemade amish egg noodles; plus all other ingredients.  Did not have chicken fat so I used canola oil instead.  This was absolutely delicious.  I think my method is a lot easier with less work and the taste plus presentation is wonderful,

This is chicken soup as it should be - absolutely excellent.  My family has been making this since I was a little girl- probably longer than that (without cayenne - we use Hungarian Paprika) Sometimes we put potato instead of noodles - depending on whether it is for dinner as a starter or supper with a baguette.  Thanks for being such a`user friendly`chef, Chef John.  Love your methods and your attitude.

Very nice soup!  I made the Roasted Chicken Broth, omitting the tomato ketchup, and followed this recipe with 2 exceptions.  I used leeks instead of onions, and I added 1/2 c. of dry white wine to the broth before adding the noodles and the chicken.  Yum!

Very tasty, not much of a thyme lover, so i substituted a little bit of poultry seasoning in its place. I also used a small whole chicken to make the broth and used the meat to add to the soup.

Very close to my Ma's. Only difference is she used dill instead of thyme and made stock out of chicken wings(feeding 7 so cheap at the time) and took the meat off those. Some of us liked it without meat/some  with so it worked in our house. The chicken wings have more flavor and add a bit of sweetness. She added more carrots since most of us liked it meatless. Tip: do not use baby carrots as they don't add the full flavor the big ones do. Chef John I have made many of your recipes and have loved them all. It may be a simple soup but still my favorite chicken soup to this day!

Did not have time to make stock so used Swansons. Also used 3 cans chicken breast drained.  Cooked noodles separate.  Yum! Froze leftovers and even better second time.

It's amazing that such a simple, easy recipe can be so good.  It's my favorite chicken noodle soup anywhere.

As is, the recipe is fantastic.  I've made this dozens of times, and here's my personal tips I've found that get the most of of it (at least for me).

1) Use a Costco (or supermarket) rotisserie chicken.  It's already cooked and has the best flavor that the soup will really absorb. 

2)  I once opted for a more expensive "Amish brand" style fat egg noodle, and the noodle was amazing.  I never thought it would make such a big difference.  Now I consider it mandatory when I make it :)

3) Fresh thyme is really important.  I've tried with dried versions, and even freeze-dried, but still is best with fresh.  

4) I double the amount of each vegetable (carrot, celery, and onion) and use a bit more butter to compensate. Just a personal preference; it just seems to be a bit light on veggies if the regular amount is used.  Either way its still great.

5) Always make more than you'll eat in one sitting as the next day the flavors are even better.  

Thanks Chef John - as always - great work.

I made this for lunch today with homemade roast chicken stock made from the Juicy Roasted Chicken by ROBINROCKINBIRD that we enjoyed last night.  Used store bought noodles to save time.  The soup was absolutely delicious - both kids (3 yr and 9 mon) enjoyed it!  thanks for sharing

Wonderful! this was the first time I have ever made homemade chicken noodle soup. Although doing it all in one day was a bit time consuming, it was well worth it!!! Absolutly love it and my husband said the same thing! Next time I may try the rotisserie chicken.

Chef John's creations are always awesome, kudos chef. Those who complain about the recipe, keep in mind, in your own home YOU'RE THE COOK, you can change the ingredients, technique, even add whatever you like in your soup. Most Chefs see recipes as basic outlines, you learn techniques and your own tastes by trying things out. Experiment :) This recipe is very tasty.

I thought this was delicious! I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the broth and chicken.  I used leftover chicken that I made using a Rotisserie Chicken recipe from this site and for the broth I used two quarts of water and Better Than Bouillon mix.  Used a total of 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper which gave this quite a kick. Altogether it was very flavorful and I will be making it again!

Delicious homemade soup! Can't beat this recipe. Keep in mind that it takes more than 40 minutes if you haven't previously made the roasted chicken broth. Also, don't use more than 4 ounces of egg noodles. I used the exact amount and it was plenty!

I liked it very much. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I added  lemon zest. I like the flavor of lemon in my chicken broth. I also used tortellini because that is what I had

I made the homemade broth.

When I started eating the soup , at first my tastebuds fought the flavor, but somewhere I knew I was liking it.

It was so different than the store bought broth I was used to.

As I continued eating I realized I was loving it.

It took some extra effort to make the broth, but it was so worth it.

Such a good soup recipe.

I make my one broth, always have from chicken bones and vegs, coagulate off fat, freeze broth in bags, ready to make chef John's wonderful soup. Only other tip I have is to add one capsule of 1000 mg Turmeric/Curcumin to the pot. Gives it all a rich yellow color.

Wow! I thought I already made an awesome chicken soup until I tried Chef Johns recipe. I followed his instructions pretty much except I didn't have thyme. I had rosemary, so I used this while simmering. Yummy recipe. Follow his advise. Good things take effort & this was a great recipe.

This is the chicken soup recipe I have been looking for.  I wanted to make a homemade soup because I felt I was coming down with a bug.  I made this one basically as it is laid out though I
 added more salt, pepper and cayenne pepper for flavor as well as more thyme and a sprig of rosemary.  It is simple but the cayenne pepper gives it a wonderful flavor.

My husband said this was the best soup I ever made (I have made a lot). I doubled the recipe and then doubled the seasoning and cut back the broth by 1 litre. I used veg broth and chicken thighs (it's all I had).

This soup was delicious. Rich broth. However, it was a bit time consuming, making the roasted chicken broth, then making the soup.

Our all time favorite soup-with the bonus of special healing powers and the cure for the common cold. If you make Chef Johns homemade chicken stock for use with this soup you will attain a whole new level-a guaranteed out of the park home-run every time.

I felt this recipe was a good baseline and made several changes.  I used homemade chicken stock, but it wasn't roasted.  I also added parsnips and various spices.  I liked another recipe on this site for white wine chicken soup, so I took some cues from it and added white wine.  Soooooo goooood!  It was thick, almost like a stew instead of soup.  So my advice is to use this as a baseline recipe and get creative to satisfy your own personal tastes.

Guys and Gals, just.... Wow. I tweaked this recipe slightly but it is by far the best. It's simple, and oh so delicious. My 16 year old son and I made this last night and our family of 6 want more tonight. This is a family where we usually all eat something different so to find something we all like is nothing short of a miracle. But enough of that here's what I did different. I used thighs instead of breast, I did not use the cayenne, I cooked the chicken by boiling it in salt water until done then added about a cup of that water to the butter/vegetables as they cooked, and I used a basic chicken broth. For those of you who were not impressed, try these alterations and bet you find you're eating the best bowl of chicken noodle soup you've ever had. Thanks Chef John. ??????

So flavorful, easy and a favorite in my household. I made a modification and added more veggies  including  baby spinach, peas ( I hate peas but they look great in this soup) and substituted the egg noodles with cheese tortellini.  Family and friends request this modified soup/stew regularly and there are never ever left overs. Thanks Chef John.

I made the roasted chicken broth from Costco roaster chicken legs. They package them for sale for $4.99 (approximately 2.75 lbs) and sell them in the prepared fresh food case. To make the stock, I separated the bones/skin from the meat and covered with water, reserving the meat for use in the dish later with extra left over. This made a wonderful rich broth.

Amazing!!

I like mine well seasoned so added 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1.5 teaspoon celery seed, and made the roast chicken (Dutch oven) same day and knew I wouldn’t have enough juice from it so added 1 can of chicken broth to it and it was just the right amount of broth ratio to noodle.

This was exactly what the doctor ordered! My daughter was up all night with a bad stomach bug and I got up early this morning to make a pot of this deliciousness for her. Something about chicken noodle soup......and THIS recipe is a keeper for sure! Delicious, comforting, healing! Thanks, Chef John, for yet another spectacular share!

I've made this soup with Chef John's roasted broth dozens of times and I've had people say it's the best soup they've ever had in their entire lives!  The broth is clearly the secret.  Simple, yet amazing.  That's the sign of a good recipe.  Thanks Chef John.  I get awesome reviews on many of your recipes when cooking for friends!

Delicious and restorative! I used thighs because that's what I had, and I don't think I will change that. Next time, knowing it is just for one, I may cook the noodles separately and add as needed. They were perfect the first day but mushy the next. I didn't add the optional cayenne. I feel much better today. Coincidence???

i roasted bone in chicken thighs after removing the skin. I like the flavor that dark meat brings to recipes in soups and stews. White meat tends to dry out quickly. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was delicious!

Excellent!  Best chicken noodle soup I ever had. I made semi home made stock using a bought a rotisserie chicken and took the meat off of it, saving the meat to be used in the soup. Using the skin and bones, I added it to 3 cartons of store bought chicken broth. simmered for 3 hours with vegetables (carrots, celery, onion, peppercorn 2 bay leaves and thyme).  strained it after 3 hours of simmering and cooled the stock for several hours.  Then I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was excellent.  This will be the chicken soup I'll make going forward.

Time consuming if you make the roasted chicken broth first, but very yummy. I added more noodles because I like a thick soup. This is a good thing to do on a snowy weekend afternoon.

This is a good start, you hardly need a recipe for this timeless standard, and  you can put anything but the kitchen sink into it :)  When I make it will all fresh ingredients, and make my own stock from last nights roast chicken, people's heads explode with happiness!  When I make it with all store bought stuff it remains a favorite.  Make it and they will come eat it...

Super yummy and easy!  Just time consuming if you make the recommended broth.  I doubled the noodles because my kids like them and it turned out great. I was salting to taste and added too much, so I will take it easy next time and add after it’s in the bowl if needed.

Excellent! I added  4 Tbsps of Challenge Butter in lieu of Chicken Fat, Better Than Bouillon Roasted Garlic Base, Freshly Graded Ginger, Garlic Powder, Fresh Gourmet Garden Lightly Dried Organic Parsley & Fresh Organic Thyme from cold product section in produce.  Used Creamette Dumpling Enriched Egg Noodles (Dry pasta/noodle section in store. Freshly grounded black pepper & Cayenne Pepper to taste. Fabulous, Warms Body & Soul! Enjoy!!!

You did it again John, I made the soup exactly the way you said, including making the broth first and it is by far the best chicken soup I have had. You are absolutely right about using the homemade broth, it has a lot more flavor, thanks again, Rick

Perfect! I made in my Instant Pot and used Roast Chicken Better than Boullion as my broth! I also used the seasoned roast chicken carcass I made on a vertical roaster and some of the skin .......of course, removed both before serving!

This chicken noodle soup recipe worked out incredibly  well. I really enjoyed the extra wide noodles. I stirred in a little tumeric powder and a splash of lemon on top. Mmm. It’s the utmost comforting soup to have on a cold day.

loved it! You don' t have to follow directions to carefully  and no special chef john broth is required. SO flavorful and it helped to add extra salt but no cayenne pepper is needed. This recipe was awesome and  my 10 year old and I made it together! Super yummy!

Have made this a dozen times now, always turns out great, only change I do is roast the bones after the initial cook and before the boil. 400-425 for 25-30 min, you get a nice deep brown colour and flavour to the broth at the end.

I make this soup several times in the winter to keep on hand.  My Aunt refers to this soup as "Medicine" when one of us gets a cold or the flu.  :-)  it is Excellent.  I follow the recipe just as is and if I don't have time to roast a chicken I pick one up at the grocery store already roasted.  You can get that great chicken fat and drippings from the  bottom of the container they come in.

I have made this several times and enjoyed this soup but this last time I made some necessary changes due to the available of pantry items and we REALLY loved it.   I baked three medium chicken breasts in a shallow dish with a sprinkling of salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth .  I sauteed the veggies as directed but with ground thyme not fresh.  I usually put in 2 boxes of chicken broth but only had 1 box of chicken and 1 box of vegetable broth so that is what I used plus I added 2 bullion cubes and approximately 2 tablespoons of  chicken fat.  I think the vegetable broth with the bouillon really made a difference....sort of like wonton broth.  We used a short wide noodle...precooked then added the chosen amount to the bottom of the serving bowl then add the chicken soup.  (My husband likes lots of noodles and me--not as much. )  Thanks Chef John for all your recipes and I will continue to make this one.

the only thing that I didn't do is I didn't add any salt to my water while I was cooking my food cause some people that eat my food does not like salt in their food while it's cooking and some don't like salt in their food while it's cooking at all the ones that do eat salt they added to their food after they are put it in their bowls. Thank God this was an easy recipe. Thanks Mr.John.

The soup part was good. But egg noodles took homemade out of the title. Next time I’ll make my own noodles. Slimy egg noodles doesn’t do this soup justice.

The best chicken noodle soup I've ever made! I cooked chicken thighs (because I didn't have the breasts) the day before in the crockpot meant for a different dish altogether but hubby got the flu so I made this instead. Soooooo good.

I've been making this soup recipe for years and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. This is an excellent soup to make and I always use Chef John's Roasted Chicken Broth or his Homemade Chicken Stock-I add a couple bay leaves to the broth/stock now. This soup is delicious as written though! I usually use bone in chicken thighs or drums, or carcass of a whole chicken (rotisserie) to make the broth/stock. Over the years, I've included the chopped celery leaves (why waste em?) and sometimes add a little marjoram, parsley, and ¼ - ½ tsp turmeric when sautéing the carrot, onion, and celery. Instead of butter, you can use olive oil with no problem. I'll occasionally add some frozen cauliflower/broccoli florets the last 10 minutes of cooking. I cook Gluten Free Elbow Noodles separately (helps with leftovers for the next day otherwise I find they get mushy. Again, very delicious chicken soup recipe and easy to adjust to your liking! My random and occasional alterations are only after years of making this soup as is. Thanks for the excellent soup recipe, Chef John!

This soup was indeed "soul-warming".  My only changes were to use canned broth and dried thyme (didn't have fresh on hand).  I also used leftover turkey breast for the chicken.  It still turned out great.

Loved it. Used regular chicken broth and added fresh spinach leaves. We're having an arctic winter in SE Michigan. This will be a regular dish. 

Thank you.

Came out good and I like the flavor but we ran out of broth and still have lots of noodles and vegetables left. I think it needs more broth go with 2 1/2 or 3quarts

Had two boys with sore throats and then a hubby who started feeling unwell before lunch and dinner plans quickly changed to the old stand-by chicken soup. But with less time allowing me to make a soup stock, I found a quick fix on here - Fast Chicken Soup Base. Family loved it, and I bet it will be even tastier tomorrow! Yum!

Hey. The first day I would have given it a "2," but a couple days later, I would give it a "5!" The flavors had time to meld and it was really good! Thus, my rating is "3." Theory? Simmer a lot longer the first day.

This is a great recipe and really easy. It's good as is, but my family likes noodles, so I doubled the noodles. I and used two pinches of cayenne as mine was fairly mild.

Have a cold this weekend. Always a plus to make homemade stock. I added dried time to the broth at the end because I didn't have fresh thyme. Chef John is always a go-to when I want to make something! Try this!

I have made this 4-5 times now, I love it.  I follow the roasted chicken broth recipe and have determined that it sometimes needs a little salt (1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp ) and sometimes it does not.  I highly recommend tasting and adding if needed at all.  I have made with Fresh and Dried Thyme and both turn out great.  This is honestly the best chicken noodle soup I have ever had. Simple and perfect, I would not change a thing.

I loved this soup! I wanted to use some chicken left over from roasting it. Unfortunately, I didn't save the schmaltz...so I added a little extra butter. I also made meatballs  (Chef John's recipe, as well). Yummy-licious!! Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly as indicated.  The soup was really good, but it was way too much work.  I expected the taste to be great, and it was only good.  And the ingredients were expensive for the amount of soup it yielded.  We only got 4 bowls of soup out of the batch.   Maybe if you use store bought broth or stock, and just follow the soup instructions, it might be worth it, but I won't be making it again.  Four stars for taste, one star for effort and cost equates to a two star overall rating for me.

Perfect for cooler evenings, or comfort food when kids have colds.  I dont always have his homemade chicken broth, but if I just fry my chicken first in my soup pot with some garlic and various spices, remove cooked chicken and add onion, carrot etc to the pan drippings, then I add 2 quarts of chicken buillion later.  Whole family enjoys with little remaining for leftovers!

I really liked this.  I substituted boneless skinless thighs because I think they hold up better in a soup and have more flavor.  I simmered them in the broth for about 20 minutes while I had a gin & tonic.  I let the thighs cool on a plate for a bit while I sauteed the vegetables, then chopped up the thighs and added them back into the broth with the veggies and noodles.  As someone else suggested, I weighed the noodles then measured them and they were a tad over 2C by volume, but a little more or less would have been fine.  Pretty easy dish to make and good for a cool evening.  Only other change is I added maybe 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.

Very quick and  easy to prepare, it is delicious and a certainly "make again" soup,  I had run out of egg noodles so I used small shell pasta instead and it worked out great.

Excellent recipe that is delicious as written. I added more veggies to mine: zucchini and spinach at the end and frozen corn at the beginning. I also served with whole wheat egg noodles. Soup is even better the next day.

I made this including the broth. It's nice and savory! Great for sicklings, births, and shivas. Or just a cold blustery day. I did make 2 changes: a) I added fresh dill like my grandma used to; b) I felt like despite an ample amount of salt I added there was some ..."body" missing from the broth so I added 1.5 tbsp of granulated sugar. Much better! Next time will add tomatoes too.

I was looking for a chicken noodle soup recipe for my Dad who was feeling sick. I didn't have time to make the roasted chicken broth, so I used organic chicken bone broth instead.  I added minced garlic to the veggies when I sautéed them. My Dad really liked this soup. Next time I make this I will use the roasted chicken broth recipe by Chef John. Thanks for the recipe:)

Made it for my sick husband. Used chicken legs, added bell pepper and a bit more seasoning than suggested. Perfect!

By all means make Chef John's Roast Chicken Broth for this soup. If you don't have that, this is still a wonderful soup. Great for whatever ails you! Thanks Chef John!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe. DO NOT make any changes and do make it often. I always have the roasted chicken broth in my freezer for when anyone is not feeling the greatest....this soup is truly "The Chicken Soup for the Soul". Thanks Chef John. P.S. - if you are making it for young grandkids then one substitution may be required......my  young grand girls love it when I put alphabet noodles in the soup and it makes it easier for them to tackle!!!

This is the ONLY recipe that I will ever use for chicken noodle soup.  It is a homerun every time!  I rarely have fresh thyme but dried thyme works just as well, and I don't feel that the chicken fat is necessary.  I have never tried a Chef John recipe that I didn't love, and this is no exception.  Try it...you'll love it!

Pretty darn good as written. If you cannot find necks and backs, just use 3 lbs of leg & thigh  chicken  quarters ( skin off) Often there is back bone  attached...which is why they are a cheap way to buy chicken. I think this recipe could be a bit better with adding some chicken meat on the bone and skin off in addition to the necks and backs.. If you try it that way, add in 1  more carrot and celery with leaves attached .

Delicious.  Only change is that I used canned chicken stock instead of water.  It came out wonderfully.  I've made it twice and everyone loves it, including my little girl.  Thanks John!

I made this tonight for the second time.  I really enjoy the flavor and it's very easy to make.  I added a little more thyme than it called for, and a little extra chicken base because I like a strong flavor.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it and we'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

I used pre made organic chicken broth and added a little bit more chicken bullion concentrate, and used gluten free noodles.  For the chicken, I used the de-boned chicken breast pieces that are available at my grocery store-taken from their rotisserie chicken.  This all made it very fast, and very delicious!   My husband said this was the best chicken noodle soup he had ever had.

This is the first time I've made chicken soup from scratch (including the stock, go me!) Absolutely delicious. The proportions of veggie to meat to noodles to broth was perfect. I will definitely make it again.

Didn't have time to make the homemade stock so used store bought. I made sure I got stock instead of broth and it was delicious. I will be trying this again when I have time to make the stock but it was really good with the store bought.

My hubby got sick so I made the soup for him and to have extra during these winter months. Good base recipe, especially made the homemade chicken stock suggested (will trt it with rotisserie chicken next time). But I am a spice queen and couldn't help myself,  I added pinch of garlic salt, cumin, chives, and parsley. Nom Nom Nom!

I made this twice and both times it went over great with my family. I followed Chef John's recipe for the homemade chicken broth. Once you have the broth, making the soup is really quick and easy and can be made as a weekday dinner.

Great basic recipe. We prefer our soups loaded, so I'd increase the amount of veggies and make some homemade egg noodles which have better texture. This is our go-to recipe for leftover turkey, using rendered turkey fat in place of the chicken fat called for here. Fresh thyme is a nice touch.

Love this soup!  I didn't have time to make my own broth.  So, I used two quarts of Swanson's Chicken Broth.  I also added 3 leaves of fresh chopped Swiss Chard.  My sick (viral cold) husband loved it!

This was great.  Simple to make and very tasty.  We didn't have the fresh thyme I used dried.  I also didn't have the chicken fat so just used more butter.  Make this and you will enjoy a simple tasty meal.

I didn't make the homemade broth or use chicken fat. I did add some garlic powder and extra pepper and cayenne. It was pretty good!

Made 12/7/2015.  Double the ingredients and used a rotisserie chicken (simmered in pot of water and some chicken broth for 1 hour with carrots and celery)  Took meat off chicken (very tender/easy to cut).  I double the carrots and added 4 cloves of garlic.  Added also some extra seasoning... dash of basil and oregano.  Added noodle of any kind that I had for the last 15 minutes.  Family enjoyed it - good taste.

This is a very simple soup and, as said elsewhere, really depends on great stock for its flavor. I made  this recipe using stock from leftover cornish hens that were deliciously seasoned.  Not surprisingly, the stock and soup were both delicious as well. Great ingredients make wonderful food!

The best - used my Thanksgiving turkey frame to make stock almost following the stock recipe exactly after the cooking part and then used turkey meat instead of chicken - only had dark meat leftover.  Amazing!

Phenomenal!! I made this for dinner but used turkey breast left over from Thanksgiving. Also, I didn't have Thyme but used poultry seasoning and 2 cartons of reduced sodium chicken broth. This was so yummy, even the kids liked it!

Yummm!!!!   This was so good on a cold rainy night.  I didn't have any carrots but used some green beans, peas, and corn and it was just as good.   It smelled awesome and tasted the same.

The one thing I didn't use was the rotisserie broth which I wish I did. This recipie is so easy breezy...good one, not so time consuming. What can I use beside chicken fat? I am not familiar with it.

THE "GO-TO" recipe for REAL chicken noodle soup. I've made this 7 times so far. You have to make the broth. Yes, it takes time but is well worth the effort.

First time reviewer - I made this recipe exactly as it was written & my family really liked it. My only change for next time would be adding more noodles and my kids like there to be a lot of noodles.  Very easy and good.

True, down-home Chicken Noodle Soup.  This recipe is excellent exactly as written but also a wonderful starting point for experimentation. My family prefers a fair amount of "flavouring" so I added more herbs, including 1 tsp. of tarragon and dill, to the fresh thyme that the recipe calls for. 
The quantities listed of diced carrots, onion, celery and noodles were just right but I also used my own homemade chicken stock and ended up thickening this soup with the vegetables (primarily carrots, onions and celery) that had simmered for hours in the original stock. I pureed them first and it gave the soup a nice golden glow from all the carrots.
I will definitely make this soup again. Thank you, Chef John.

Great soup, but admittedly it took me three days to make it. LOL! I started from scratch by roasting the chicken, pulling off the meat, boiling the carcass to make the broth, then finally making the soup itself. I am sure it could be done a lot faster if I had really committed myself to the effort. The final product was good, even very good, but not sure it was good enough to justify the time and effort. My wife liked it and loved me for making it for her ;)

It came out nicely.  Later I tried it with e following"on hand" changes....Orzo for my pasta, extra of all of the veggies, added garlic and chicken stock to replace the broth.  It came out nicely this time, too. This is a good recipe on its own and to build from.  Great to teach to my kids!

From another recipe I picked up using a rotisserie chicken to get both the meat and the bones to make the broth, so I did that. I tried thyme the first time, sage with ginger the second. I did give yours a shot, Chef John, but I go with the traditional flavors. Nonetheless, this is a great recipe in its simplicity and as I write I am off to cook it as a dinner for 8, to serve with some dark rye bread here in Finland :)

It's amazing how the added chicken broth kicks this up a couple notices. Always relied on cooking a whole chicken, bones and all, for full flavor, (and then strain) which it does but the added broth just knocks it out of the park. Made this recipe for 40 years but will add the broth from now on.  Just one thing, I always cook my noodles separate because they tend to cloud the broth.  I add them to the soup at the very end for a clearer broth.  Good one Chef John!

Not terrible but a bit on the bland side. Mainly I think the ingredients don't simmer together long enough for the flavors to marry. Also could use more seasonings.

Made some changes, didn't do thyme or cayenne pepper, just some italian seasoning & a bit of salt & pepper, used 2 chicken quarters- uncooked on the bone, just took meat off when ready, substitute for melted chicken fat was shortening & a chicken boullion cube & I kept onion out. Just used regular chicken stock, put everything in crock-pot, cooked on low for 7hrs & voila yummy warm soup!

I changed a few things. I made this for three servings. It called for 1 teaspoon of butter. I thought it said 1 tablespoon. And even better, I had two and a half tablespoons of butter left in my fridge and I just through it all in. Whoops! Then also, I don't like as much broth so I put in only two cups and it called for three. Also, I like a lot of noodles so I NEVER put on what it calls for. I put in two handfuls of egg noodles. It tasted absolutely amazing. ??

Wouldn't change a thing also.  Maybe add a couple of chicken boullion cubes instead of salt, is all!  Like it thicker?  Add some starch!  Bon appetite!

There's a lot of food I cannot eat but this is nice and simple. I mostly used it for the timing of when to add ingredients but I loved the result : )

I followed the recipe, even making the stock,,,with the exception of adding ketchup to the stock (don't use ketchup). Today I put the soup together with no cayenne pepper. It's blah, it's needs something.

Wow. Just wow.  I am SOOO glad I decided to keep those chicken bones and carcass from 2 previous chickens (had in my freezer for awhile). I decided to make the homemade stock for the 1st time, and I am so glad I did because this is what truly takes this soup over the top (not to mention I now have 4 extra jars of stock in my freezer for future recipes).  The soup recipe is super simple once you have made the stock--probably the BEST chicken noodle soup I have ever had and I have made CNS many times.  I even took the simplicity a step further by buying my favorite Mirepoix veg in the frozen section and using that instead of dicing fresh. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T."  This is my new Chicken Noodle Soup recipe forever!

I glanced at this recipe & since I actually had most of the ingredients I figured why not. I'd grilled chicken last nite w/bell peppers, garlic, onions & tomatoes, so this was my variation plus I used plain chicken broth. My husband loved it & had two large bowls. I will try this again once I have the RCB as listed in the recipe. -VJ

I followed the recipe exactly, including making the chicken stock from scratch. The soup was very good, and I really appreciated the simplicity of it. However, I felt that the soup was fairly bland. At the end I did add in soup extra spices and herbs because I just felt it was a tad boring. Otherwise, I enjoyed this soup very much.

This recipe is perfect for great, good for the soul, cures what ails you, like mom used to make, classic chicken soup.  I make a quad recipe as it freezes great.  You can freeze the stock and do this part later or freeze it all made with the noodles and just thaw and warm later as a great alternative to the junk from the can.  If you need to for medical reasons you can obviously reduce the salt.

Simple, pure, unadulterated chicken soup. Full disclosure - I added about a TBL of "Better Than Bullion" to the broth instead of salt as well as about a TBL of lemon juice after I took it off the heat.

This was really yummy and so simple!  I didn't have the fat or the roasted chicken broth but similar substitutions and it turned out excellent.  I'm sure it would have been even better making it exact.

Simple and delicious. I can't use egg noodles so I broke linguine noodles into about 2-inch pieces and it worked great for us. I used a little dried thyme since I didn't have fresh. Nothing spectacular here, just good old chicken noodle soup.edit: using the linguine noodles may be why but when using the full amount, which I don't usually do, the leftovers were nearly without broth as they had soaked it all up. The texture still seemed fine but I had to add broth to the leftovers and it ended up mostly noodle soup.

I was surprised how rich tasting this soup came out. It's delicious! I doubled the recipe and used a roasted lemon pepper chicken from Albertson's, added 2 TB olive oil to the butter, used canned chicken broth, Italian seasoning and Oregano (didn't have thyme). I needed to make it in a hurry to heal my sick daughter's cold. This is a winner!

I have been making chicken noodle soup for 50 years and this is the BEST!!!  I used the chicken carcass from a Costo rotisserie chicken.  Reserved the breast meat and used the rest to make the stock, per your recipe.  Next day I made the soup following the recipe exactly.  It was so easy and simply delicious.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I only made a few changes. I used a roasted chicken from the store instead of roasting my own (I wanted the soup fast due to illness). I also always add extra helpings of veggies (my daughter loves carrots) so I upped the thyme. I cooked the veggies as directed, but also added Herbs de Provence and some smoked paprika. Even without sauteing the veggies and herbs in the chicken fat, it was excellent. Oh, and I am now a fan of Better than Buillon. If you have not yet tried this, I highly recommend you do. Happy cooking!
