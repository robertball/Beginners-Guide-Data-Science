This is my second no bake cookie recipe I've tried and the same result. When cooling they did not harden like they are suppose to. No sure what I am doing wrong. I followed both recipes to the "T". Does anyone have any suggestions?

These came out great, and my boys love em' too!  I only had a half stick of butter on hand, so I used 1/4 cup shortening as well.  For those that were finding they were to runny, make sure you boil the full minute, and then after all ingredients are mixed in, I stirred them in the pot for a little while to help the "dough" cool and harden a bit, as they were runny until they cooled a little in the pot.  Then drop them on your wax paper, they should form great at that point.

The only thing I changed in the recipe was using creamy peanut butter vs. crunchy.  It is a great fast remedy for that feeling of "I-gotta-have-chocolate-quick-or-I'm-gonna-hurt-someone"!!! haha

I've been making these cookies since I was a little girl (we always called them 3 minute or No Bake cookies).  I also use creamy peanut butter and I sometimes immediately pour the mixture into a 13x9 pan (lightly greased) to make bar cookies, instead of the drop cookies.

I've tried a few of these recipes and this was the only one that turned out like it was supposed to. I also used creamy peanut butter instead of the crunchy. The whole family loves these treats.

This recipe is wonderful. Years ago I made the ones that you cook for 3 minutes, with that recipe sometimes they would harden and sometimes they would not. But, once I started using this recipe I have never had a problem with them setting up. I do use evaporated milk in mine an most of the time I use creamy peanut butter. Every once in a while I will add i cup chopped pecans and/or 1/2 cup coconut to this recipe. You can cook for about 20 seconds longer but i minute should be perfect. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! For thr oatmeal if you use anything but the quick cooking (1 minute kind), they will not taste right. The rolled oats will make them tough with a cardboard taste. Rolled oats are great but just not for these cookies.

I had been looking for the recipe for months and I was glad to find it.  They turned out wonderful just like the ones my aunt used to make when I was little.

I have loved these cookies since I was a child and now my littles are loving them! The key to these cookies setting up right is to bring them to a rolling boil and then begin the timer for 1 minute. I boil them for 2 minutes up here in the Rocky Mts. FYI-they are called Preacher cookies because you can whip them up pretty quick when the preacher calls for an unexpected visit :)

Only change in ingredients I made was using creamy peanut butter.   I wasn't sure when to start timing my minute - when you first start seeing bubbles or when it's boiling rapidly....so I started when I first started seeing bubbles and cooked it 1 minute 20 seconds.   I also followed a previous reviewers suggestion of letting the mixture set up in the pot before dropping them on was paper.

This is one of my family's favorite.  I have been making this cookie for over 50 years. I have made it both ways - with creamy and chunky peanut butter. I myself prefer the creamy.  To get the cookie to set up right you must bring it to a FULL ROLLING boil then start timing it for 1 minute.  If not a full rolling boil and/or too short on time the cookies will be  sticky and gooy.  If you boil longer than a minute then they set up too fast and get sugary. It takes practice to get these right.

This is a wonderful recipe for Preacher Cookies....I use it every time I make these tasty lil' gems, and will continue to do so in the future!!! What I do differently is I use creamy peanut butter and an extra 1/2 to 1 cup of the quick oats. The extra oats really make a difference and always helps the cookies set up more firmly for me....they turn out perfect every single time. I plan on making these again very soon!!! YUMMY. :)

I had the same problem some others mentioned. I followed the exact steps let boil for a full minute and no matter how long I waited they never hardened. I tried putting them in the fridge but they stayed the same consistency as play doh and were very sticky. I would not make this again

This is a recipe that my grandmother and mother have always made. We use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. It's great! I like to put the cookies in the refrigerator so they harden nicely.

I love these cookies. They're simple and quick and I usually have everything necessary to make them.   Three things I figured out from previous reviews and minimal tinkering.... 1) I start timing my rolling boil once the butter is melted.  2) If I'm a little low on cocoa, it doesn't matter terribly. 3) If you add extra peanut butter, you're going to need a little more oat or they're runny and melty if left out on the counter.

This is the first time I have ever had preacher cookies turn out right!!  I have the same recipe but the wrong directions.  If you follow this recipes directions you will get the perfect consistency.  The boiling for one minute makes all the difference in the world.

My initial review of these cookies, after making them one time, was between 2 and 3 stars.  The second time I made these cookies I made these changes: I used 1/2 cup less sugar, but deviated from the recipe and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown sugar; I also used Jif creamy peanut butter; and I used 1/2 cup more quick-cooking oats than the original recipe called for.  I found out that it is essential to cool and harden the cookies (on wax paper) by immediately putting them in the refrigerator.  (I made sure I had a full 1 minute rolling boil.)   By making these changes, the cookies are now perfect-- both in taste and consistency!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes when I have a chocolate craving.  So easy to make.  Make sure that you use just a 1/2 stick of butter, not 1/2 cup butter as recipe indicates. That's too much butter and they will not setup.

Loved them.....1 min. boiling the mixture wasn't nearly long enough to set them so we had to freeze and eat....next time I'll boil for at least 3 mins. and see how they work out.  Well worth making!

These are WONDERFUL cookies and super simple to make.  My only change was using creamy peanut butter (all I had).  Not to mention, perfect to make when you can't think about turning on the oven just to make cookies!  UPDATE:  I have made this recipe several times now and taken them to parties as dessert..a hit EVERY time!!

Sooo easy, delicious & quick to make!  I use 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white, plus add a bit more peanut butter (prefer creamy instead of crunchy).

I really liked the recipe. I have used it several times.
still working on the hardening part. sometimes it sets hard and sometimes it comes out gooey . I believe it is in the time you allow to boil. 1 min isn't enough . Try to let boil between 2 & 3 minutes .
seems to the trick.
Also try using recipe with rice Krispies  instead of oatmeal.It was really good. The kids seemed to really like them. Use 4 1/2 cups of cereal .

If you are having trouble with the cookies hardening, it is probably because the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of crunchy peanut butter.  I prefer creamy, so I use only 1/4 cup and they turn out perfectly.

These cookies were delicious, however, they were super sweet! Almost sickeningly so. Half of a cookie each and my husband and I were on a sugar high. Next time I will probably use 1/2 a cup less sugar and definitely add more peanut butter. Also, I let them harden in the refrigerator and they were set in less than 10 minutes. Thank you for the quick, easy and ultimately delicious recipe!

Lovely, easy, quick, no-fuss, economical recipe. Made it twice in 2 weeks (once for church, once for my daughter's school cake sale). My fussy 6yo loved it. Poured the mixture onto a lined cookie tray and made it into squares instead of drop cookies the 2nd time and it was even better as a thick, chewy square:)

Absolutely amazing. Brought them to work and they were gone in seconds! I have tried no- bake cookies several times and failed, but this recipe is right on. My only tweaks- I used creamy peanut butter and left them in the pan for a few minutes after combining the oats, stirring occasionally until the mixture firmed up a bit. I have always had problems with the set- up in other recipes but these were firm and perfect. Thank you!

We always called these "diaper cookies" (I know...), so it was nice to learn the real name.  These were delicious!  Wish there was a way around so much white sugar, but I figure the peanut butter and oats are healthy.  I do cool mine in the fridge and keep them there.

I'd been wanting to make these for a while, and finally got the chance to do so tonight. My boyfriend was skeptical at first, but snuck some of the mixture off the spoon. He was following me around exclaiming how amazing they tasted! My mix was having a little trouble setting up, so I added some honey and let it boil for a bit longer. Turned out fabulous!

Perfect little no-bake chocolate-peanut butter cookie.  Personally, I always use butter because I think it tastes better than margarine and, margarine has more water in it and can, sometimes, make the cookie a little soggy.  Also, the key to making sure that these cookies set up or harden the way you want them to is to make sure that the sugar has dissolved completely while boiling.  Be sure that the mixture has come to a full boil, where it is really bubbling well, stirring constantly so as not to burn the ingredients.  Once the mixture has come to a full boil, be sure to boil (and stir) for a full minute, or even a little longer.  I like to boil the mixture for about a minute and a half to two minutes to make sure the sugar has completely dissolved.  Just be sure to stir the sugar mixture constantly and watch it closely so as not to burn and you should never have a problem with soggy cookies again.  If you've ever made candy before, you know that your sugar has to come to a certain temperature before it will set up correctly.  These cookies are similar in that you really want your sugar to come to a full boil and boil for at least a full minute or you end up with what I call spoon cookies because you'll have to eat them with a spoon. ;)

Wow!  These are good and very easy.  They set up fine for me.  When the recipe says "boil", it means BOIL, really get it going.  I think these are called Preacher Cookies because you need to pray for willpower while they cool.

For better cooling/hardening, cool in the freezer for 20 minutes and store in the fridge, don't do any of this at room temperature, or else they won't harden or stay hardened very well.

Excellent recipe.  I exchanged Almond Breeze for the milk and used margarine (I am allergic to milk).  These turned out perfectly.  I have been making Preacher cookies for 40 years and these are the best I've ever made!

This recipe was the closest I've found to my mother's no-bake cookies.  The only thing I did differently was to sub 1/4 cup of the sugar with brown sugar.  Oh, and I used rolled oats.  Thanks!!!

Excellent recipe with just the right amount of peanut butter and cocoa.  I will be making it again in the future.
Thanks so much.

Love these cookies - we always had these at Bible School when I was younger, and they are my husband's favorite cookie so I had to find the recipe - I make them all the time for him (and his family!)  The only thing I changed was to use creamy peanut butter and only because that's what we normally eat.

Well as always, before you start in on a recipe make sure you have all of the required ingredients. When I reached for the oats there was less than 2 cups in Mr. Quakers belly. The butter chocolate mixture  was already boiling, what to do, what to do. Scanning the cabinet I spotted plenty of granola. Substituted 3 cups of oats with 1 cup of oats/2 cups of granola.  Try it you won't be disappointed!

Absolutely amazing. We have a recipe for chocolate oatmeal no bake cookies but I picked this one up because freezing isn’t necessary. I do prefer them cold but back when we had a tiny freezer this was helpful. I saw several reviews saying that they didn’t harden or got crumbly but I have the solution. You need to make sure you boil for EXACTLY one minuet, these cookies can be picky. Too short and they’re watery, too long and they’re dry and crumbly. Family loves these and they’re great for a hot day or a sudden chocolate emergency.

A little crumbly texture, but other than that great. I think I will use creamy peanut butter next time.

I've made this recipe countless times, and it almost always turns out. Although, I did boil it for 1 minute and a half instead of one. I love it.

These are one of my favorite cookies growing up. They are naturally wheat free and can easily be made gluten free by using gluten free oats. These are great for hot summer days when you don't want to turn the oven on. Just make sure you boil them for a full minute or you get a sticky mess.

I made it and it was perfect. My daughter made it and they didn't set up. She clearly started her 1 minute timer at a different stage of boil than I did. I'd love for this recipe to provide the temperature to cook to. I read some forums and Softball was recommended so we'll be trying that next time.

These get five stars for simplicity, but only four for flavor. They're a bit bland. I cut the sugar to a cup and a half - no more is needed, and also subbed the marg with oil. To save time, I poured it into a pan. The only downside with that is that they stayed quite sticky.

Excellent recipe.  For those that have trouble getting the cookie to harden - make sure the mixture is at a ROLLING boil before starting the 1 minute timing.  Mine always come out perfect!  Hope this helps!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  For a Mexican chocolate version, add 2 tbsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It adds a tiny spicy tingle at the end.  My coworkers loved it.

Turned out great, just like I remember. If your cookies aren't setting, it's because you aren't cooking the sugar long enough. Make sure that it's really boiling for a full minute, but not too long or your cookies will be dry and crumbly.

I've always loved these cookies and my favorite is leaving the cocoa out and making them with just peanut butter, yum! Do cook for a minute or more if you have problems with them being runny. Sometimes it's the humidity or altitude you live in. You can always adjust and add more oats.

I am really surprised by how many good reviews this recipe has received.  I followed this recipe as written but was concerned about the 2 cups of sugar since that seems like a lot.  I was right.  These cookies are so sickeningly sweet, I could practically feel all of the sugar crunching in my teeth. Perhaps they would be tastier if I had cut back on the sugar, but this recipe is a non-repeater for me.  I'm admittedly not a huge lover of PB & chocolate, but my husband is, and he agreed these cookies weren't that great due to the extreme sweetness.  Blech.

Love these, been making them for years, my grown son asks for them.  We call them "buffalo chips."  I think my original recipe called them "boiled cookies."  Just make sure they come to a rolling boil for 1 minute.

I grew up on these but hadn't made them in forever. I used creamy Jif and left out the salt, primarily because I don't recall my mom putting salt in when she made them. They set up just fine - boiled for one minute. 

If you're having trouble with getting them to set up, make sure you've got a full rolling boil going before you start timing. Also, the more humid it is, the longer you'll need to boil it. I like to double check myself any time I make a fudge type candy by making sure it's reached the soft ball stage.

I followed the script on the 1st batch but I found that putting in the dry oats and then the peanut butter and vanilla made it hard to distribute the mix evenly.  I also noticed that they come out more sticky than 'melt in your mouth'.

The 2nd batch I made sure to only use real butter and I added 1 tablespoon on cocoa--and voila more dryer looking less glazed cookies that are much more 'melty'.

Awesome recipe. Anybody having trouble with it setting soft, make sure you don't let it boil for more than two minutes, otherwise it breaks down the sugar and doesn't let it crystallize. Another trick to make them really good is to add some unsweetened flaked coconut. Not too much, maybe a cup at the most.

It turned out fine but tasted too sweet for my taste. Also maybe the oats I used weren't 100% instant cause they needed some cooking.

I probably wouldn't make this again. It tastes pretty good, definitely satisfies that chocolate craving, and its easy which I really appreciate, but they weren't a hit when I served them at all. These cookies are just okay. I see a lot of people had issues with it not setting, mine thankfully set fine.

I make these with Splenda and a little more crumbly but still that chocolate fix even diabetics need.  Make regular for the grandkids and we love them.  Sometimes crunchy, sometimes creamy peanut butter, sometimes add coconut and my youngest grandchild loves raisins or dried cranberries in them.

The easiest recipe!  I don't know why I don't make them more often.  I happened to have dark cocoa powder and makes the cookies even yummier!

These were good.  I used rolled oats instead cause that's what I had and I totally suggest no one do this in the future.  They do not "cook" and therefore left my cookies too dry.  But the taste was great.  Mine didn't look anything like the ones in the picture but that could be because of the oats I used.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I found this same recipe on a baby shower site.  There they were called "Baby Poop" cookies.  I made them for a baby shower, substituting soy milk and margarine for the milk and butter.  The chunky peanut butter really added to the "theme" effect!  They were a big hit, especially with those familiar with this cookie.  In fact, several said these ones turned out better than their own versions!  Great recipe!

wonderful and simple recipe! I wasn't sure if the 1 minute boiling time was for one minute from the first signs of boil or from  a good steady already hard boiling, so I counted my minute off from the hard boil, and it was just dandy. Cut the recipe in half, had plenty of cookies to spare.

I used creamy peanut butter like a lot of other reviewers, but made it even easier by letting the dough set in a 13x9 pan and cutting into bars.  Excellent!

This is a great no-bake cookie recipe. Follow the 1 minute boil instructions and there shouldn't be a problem with them setting.

These are good. My problem was that they were too runny and just not as rich and delicious as I had hoped.  I had to add in 1 more cup of oats to get them to stop running, not sure why!

Yummy! I only made a few changes, used 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead and smooth peanut butter (all we had) and add a few walnuts. Turn out well.
