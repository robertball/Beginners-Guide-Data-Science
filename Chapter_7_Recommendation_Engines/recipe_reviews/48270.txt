Just wanted to up my rating to 5*. I made this again since I liked all the ingredients, added some cayenne pepper, marinated for 48 hours, and it was great!  Such a nice change from so many marinades with soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is way too liquid to be a bbq sauce. It's more of a marinade than anything else. I did manage to make sauce  out of it by omitting the water and reducing the cider vinegar to a 1/2 cup. I also reduced the chili powder to 2 Tbsp. and the black pepper for the children. I mixed everything in a saucepan over medium heat to get rid of the sugar grit and stirred in a can of tomato paste. Not bad.

I added the tomato paste and put over heat as well. Wouldn't have been so sauce-like without. I also added a little dab of hot sauce for an extra kick.

I had high hopes for this recipe. I looking for a homemade BBQ sauce to pair with some Ore-Ida french fries and tater tots. This mixture turned out to be very liquidy and like other reviewers said, it more of a marinade than a sauce for dipping.

WOW!  I'll be honest, I wasn't terribly impressed with this one at first.  Thin, watery...ugh.  But I let it simmer for about an hour and it thickened WAY up.  Not a thin sauce at all by the time it had simmered for a while.  The only change I made was a few drops of liquid smoke and subbing brown sugar Splenda for the sugar.
