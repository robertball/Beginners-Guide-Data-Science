Loved this!  I had a 4 pound rump roast, twice as big as called for in the recipe, so I made a few adjustments. First, I used beefy onion soup mix since that's what I had and I much prefer it over the plain onion soup mix anyway. I did add the packet of au jus gravy mix, 1/2 cup red wine for half of the water, and for extra liquid to accomodate the larger roast, an 8-oz. carton of beef stock. I also added 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I cooked it on low, about 7 hours, then chilled it overnight. The cold meat is firm and slices perfectly, which I like better than shredding it. The meat was melt in your mouth tender and richly flavorful, as was the au jus, which I served in ramekins alongside the sandwich. On a buttered hoagie or sub roll, this was just delicious, even without the cheese!

I gave this five stars with one alteration: I used onion and herb Mrs. Dash instead of the onion soup mix.  The Mrs. Dash contains no sodium; the onion soup mixed with the au jus has almost 1000 mg of sodium!  I used 6 tsp. of Mrs. Dash to equal one packet of soup mix.  Very yummy sandwiches!

Doubled this and made the day before my get-to-gether. Refrigerated in my crockpot insert and the next day put back on the crock to reheat. The best part about doing that for me was that all of the fat came to the top and solidified .....just used a spoon and it all came right off in solid form....so I felt better about using the drippings to dip these wonderful sandwiches. Our company loved them, served on rolls with swiss cheese. Just delicious! Thanks!

Really good and easy! I made this for a football game. Everyone loved it.
 I did add 1/2 of a thinly sliced onion,  when I put the other ingredients in the slow cooker.
Thanks, this is a crowd pleasing keeper.

Fantastic! I have to admit, I didn't have the highest of expectations. Just tasting the meat I kept thinking it needed something, but couldn't decide what. I was wrong! Once this was shredded I put it back in the juice to cook for a couple more hours. I toasted a hoagie roll, added a little mayo & spicy mustard, then the meat & cheese - popped it back in the oven just to melt cheese - then a little lettuce & tomato. Added a little bowl of the jus for dipping. WOW! The result was one fabulous sandwich! Loved, Loved, Loved it! One note: This cut makes definitely has a lot of fat. So be SURE to remove as much as you can when shredding the meat AND definitely chill and remove the floating fat or use a fat-separating pitcher then pour the jus back over the meat.

This was an amazing recipe! I used a 4lb bottom round roast and just upped the liquid to 1 1/2 cups but it came out perfectly and there was enough meat left over to make Beef Stroganoff the following day-The flavor of the gravy is so luscious that it almost seems like a restaurant meal-Will make this again

So good. My husband's friends hear I'm making this and next thing I know I have a house full of hungry men. Favorite all around.

I did find the original recipe a little too salty, so I use 2 cups of water instead of just the one.

Outstanding and so easy! After shredding the meat, I cooked it in the sauce until absorbed and it was so full of flavor - no dipping sauce needed.  Substituted 2/3 can of beer for the water with excellent results.  Super flavor, but a little salty, so might try 1/2 packet of onion soup next time.

Very good. I added to the mix canned mushrooms. I also used the juice to dip my sandwiches in like a french dip.

I made this last night for a card party, and there was NOTHING LEFT.  It was a big hit, and several people asked for the recipe.  I absolutely will make this again!  The only changes I made was using low sodium beef broth instead of water, Lipton 'Beefy' onion soup mix instead of the regular onion soup mix, and slices of provolone instead of shredded mozarella.  Next time I will use smaller sandwich buns ... I served this buffet-style where everyone built their own sandwich, and everyone took too much meat to fill their big hoagie buns.  It was slim pickings for those unlucky enough to be at the end of the line!  I'm planning 1/2 lb per person from now on.  Even though it looks like a lot of meat when it first goes into the crockpot, the meat is heavily marbled so will shrink substantially as it cooks.  Besides, I want LEFTOVERS!!

Super easy and super good!  I love that this recipe requires only two simple ingredients that I usually have on hand anyway.  The only change I made was using beefy onion soup instead of the regular onion, because I prefer it and that's the only kind I buy.  I served the sandwiches on soft, fresh kaiser rolls.  The picky eaters in my family raved over them, and they agreed that no cheese was needed.  Delicious with just meat and roll.  I have made this many times and it is staying in my regular rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I stumbled upon this recipe while searching for something to do w/a "chuck roast" from our first side of beef.  When I read the reviews and saw it had earned 5 stars from "naples" (I trust naples reviews/suggestions as though I actually know her in real life), I knew it would be a good one.  And it was.  I doubled the recipe because I used 2 chuck roasts which looked/felt around 4-5 pounds.  On the advice of naples' review, I used some red wine and beef broth in lieu of the water.  I wasn't sure how much liquid to use, so I assumed I was to cover the meat and used about a 2/3-1/3 ratio of beef broth to red wine to cover the meat.   It cooked on low from about 6 am-5pm and it was fall apart tender.  Great flavor and texture.  I served on hoagie rolls w/sauteed peppers/mushrooms/onions and provolone cheese or shredded mozzarella.  We've got a few more chuck roasts in the freezer so I foresee this recipe getting more use at the LTH house!  THANK YOU, stephmonn, for the recipe!

Yummy!  I used beef broth instead of water, but left everything else the same.  Toasted the buns w/ cheese on them in the oven, then added meat.  I do wonder why this recipe states that it would make 12 servings though.  I used a 1.4# roast for just my husband and I, and it made just one large sandwich for each of us.

Sooo easy and delicious.  Followed recipe exactly in preparing the meat.  Used smaller rolls and didn't even need the cheese.  Thanks for a minimal prep/delicious recipe.  (By the way, I don't usually even like meat!)

Well, let me tell you, this recipe is very good!  I’m usually hesitant about using packaged soup/au jus mixes, because I worry that they will be too salty.  But I threw caution to the wind and used Beefy Onion Soup mix and an au jus mix.  Instead of the water called for, I used a full can of low sodium beef broth and, like another reviewer, I added 1/2 cup of red wine.  I cooked this on high, as indicated in the recipe, and it was perfectly done in 5 hours.  I shredded the beef and strained the cooking liquid to use as an au jus dipping sauce for the sandwiches.  I chilled the au jus and removed the fat that rose to the top and re-heated it before serving.  To make the sandwiches, I re-heated some of the shredded beef with a little of the au jus.  I made Garlic Bread Spread from this site and spread it on the cut sides of a baguette and then toasted it under the broiler.  I assembled the sandwiches, adding provolone and popped them back under the broiler to melt the cheese.  These were delish!  I froze the leftovers of both the beef and au jus, and look forward to having these again!

Delicious & Easy!  My husband and I loved this meal.  In order to keep the sodium down, I took another reviewers advice and substituted Onion & Herb Mrs Dash for the dry onion soup mix - I used about 4 tsps.  It was very flavorful and I'll definitely make this dish again!

Mine didn't turn that out well (they ended up being too greasy) but typically when something is wrong it's me! But, I have re-read the instructions a few times and can't figure out what I did wrong, so I gave this a three star rating.

Very good, easy to prepare and clean up! I was concerned about the salt so doubled the water, halved the onion soup mix and added a thinly sliced whole sweet onion. I used 3.6 lbs of meat and cooked on low for eight hours. It turned out juicy, tender and the salt level was just right. I served meat/onions on top of havarti cheese (cause I like it), creamy horseradish and a side salad. It's just two of us so there is a lot left over (filled a 1.7 qt container of the meat and 1.2 pt container of liquid after serving two, six inch sandwiches) and will add a bit of half/half, simmer and serve over noodles for another meal. Might even have enough for another sandwich or two for lunch.

These were delicious! Really only needed about 6-8 hours on low heat to become fork tender. I would top with a slice of cheese and some ketchup on the side for dipping.

I made this over the weekend for my family and they turned out wonderful except for one thing, they were SUPER salty. Next time I will try cutting the sodium by using Mrs. dash instead of the onion soup or just cutting out the onion soup all together. But other than for the saltyness they were great. I did broil the sandwiches after I put the cheese on them.

This was very tasty!!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was that I added 1 cup beef broth as well as 1 cup water.  Even though I heated the sandwich to melt the cheese, I will be using mozzarella slices instead of shredded mozzarella.  The shredded pieces (they didn't all melt in the microwave) kept falling in the sauce when I would dip the sandwich.  The taste was very delicious and I will be making this again soon!

I don't ever post reviews, but this recipe is worthy of my time!!!! My entire family loved loved loved this!!!! I did use beer/water combo versus straight water and 1/2 package of onion soup mix for a tad less saltiness and added a sweet onion.  My 6 year old said I should quit my job and sell these sandwiches, because they were the best sandwiches ever!!!!!! Thank you for sharing this great go to crowd pleaser!

These were AMAZING!  I used Beef Onion soup mix, a 1 cup of wine and about 2 cups of  beef stock instead of water.  This created a lot more jus as well.  It was incredibly flavorful.  So delicious!

This was awesome!!!  I made this last night for the football game and their wasn't a scrap left.  The only changes I made are that I used beef broth instead of water and a sirlion tip roast instead of the chuck roast.  This is definately a new football favorite in my house!

This was very tasty! I think I'll use half of a packet of au jus next time because the dip was a little too salty. My husband really liked this meal, though! As recommended by other users, I put the meat and cheese on the bread and then broiled them for a couple of minutes in the oven. I was amazed that it didn't take any longer to cook when starting with frozen meat. (I did cut the roast in two, though, so it would heat all the way through.)

Super easy very tasty.it was a bit 
to salty and could have made a little more juice so next time I'll use a full
beer and add a pinch of thyme and rosemary to brighten the au jus.I browned the beef the night before then deglazed the pan with the beer mixed in the other ingredients then through it in the crok and placed it in the fridge.Next morning I put the crock on,when I came home it was good to go.Thanks

This was excellent!  I didn't have the au jus packet so I used beef base and just sorta eyeballed it.  I cooked on high about 4 hours, then on low for 2.. it broke apart and was so tender and flavorful.  I made homemade ciabatta bread and it hit the spot! I'll make this again for sure.

Made this for my family last night and they all loved it! Even my super picky 3 year old nephew kept asking for more!! The only changes I made were to use beefy onion soup mix, 2 tablespoons chopped garlic and 1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe!

I loved these!  They were so simple to make and other than mixing in a little more water, throwing in a ton of chopped garlic, and sliced onions I didn't alter the recipe.  My fiance was in "man paradise" just enjoying juicy beef and melty cheese.  I did use a monterey jack cheese blend.  We just like that cheese better ;)

If I were rating for my honey - I would give it a 5.  He said these were better than (gulp) his mom's!  But - they were a tad strong for me.  Still amazing, but couldn't finish it all.  However - I did replace the water with beef broth, and I had to leave it in the slow cooker after shredding a little longer than I had planned.  Still - will DEFINITELY make again!

Used a 3.5 lb bottom round roast, added 2 1/4 cups water, used beefy onion soup mix, and it's delicious!  Would add more water next time as I didn't have much liquid for dipping.  Served on toasted french rolls, and was even better the next day!

This turned out real good. I only used 1/2 packet of the dry au jus mix, as it had enought salt,so I added a little more water to dilute the saltiness. Other than that, this will be my french dip recipe!

This was very good, my wife and I love pot roast.  This was a real treat/suprise for my wife having it on the hoagie rolls. The aroma during cooking was driving my wife nuts and the taste was even better. I followed the recipe as it was written and we both thought it got 10 stars. Thank you stephmonn for a wonderful and easy meal.

This is so good. The only thing I changed was I used beef broth instead of water. When the roast was finished I shredded it separating the fatty areas. I put the juice in the refrigerator so the fat went to the top. Discard the fat and put back into the slow cooker. Use good rolls and top with mozzarella cheese. So good may make it to Christmas Eve standard.

This was tasty and easy.  I didn't have the au jus mix, so I just used the onion soup and a beef boullion cube.   This is a busy day friend.  For those that said it was too greasy, let the juices sit and skim the fat off of the top.

I made the recipe as-is and it was perfect and I am really sensitive to salt.  So maybe my soup mix wasn't as salty?  Fabulous taste and great au ju to dip the sandwiches in.

I layered sliced onion and fresh minced garlic in the bottom of my crockpot before adding my roast. I also seared my roast on all sides before crockpotting it. I did sprinkle in a couple healthy teaspoons of italian seasoning when I added the onion soup mix/au jus. Not bad. I think the broth could use a little more oomph next time but a great base to work with for next time.

Doesn't get any easier than this!  I too, left out the dry onion soup mix in favor of Ms Dash to reduce sodium, otherwise followed exactly.  Delicious meal to feed a crowd with very little effort.  
*Second time I made this I added sliced onions - Great!

This was really, really good. Perfect comfort food with only 3 ingredients! Super simple to make, I didn't change a thing and it turned out moist with lots of flavor. The entire house smelled amazing. A keeper.

Absolutely Delicious! I added extra broth as some of the reviews said and added extra water also. When we made the sandwiches we had lettuce and tomato meat and cheese and the dip and it was very messy but it was OH SO GOOD!

This was AMAZING!!  I used onion rolls instead of the sub rolls and took some of the reviewer's  advice and used beef stock instead of the water, but this will be made again in our home!  My husband is now wishing that I had gotten enough meat for a double batch!!  :D

This was good but I had one problem. After 5 hrs. the meat did not shred with 2 forks. I had to slice the meat. I used a chuck roast. I'm not sure what happened. My daughter cut hers in small peices and put in a sandwich.I don't think I'll make these again.

This has become a staple dinner in my house. My husband even said that if he had ordered this from a restaurant menu, it would easily become his favorite restaurant. The only thing we did differently was use provolone slices instead of shredded mozzarella. Using a bigger chuck roast (maybe 3 pounds) is probably a good idea, because the roast tends to shrink up a bit in the crockpot. This is a family favorite, and it will be for years to come! And it's so easy! Be warned. If you're at home while this is cooking, the smell will make you hungry all day long.

This is by far the best and most simple way to yield fantastic results with a pot roast! My entire family, including picky children, loved it also. The au jus created from the seasoning and beef drippings is a little bit greasy if you are using as a dip for the sandwiches. I prefer to make a separate batch.

Delicous!  Easy to make,  and my picky eaters loved it.  I made triple the recipe since there was a buy one get one free sale on Chuck roast at Kroger.  Had a great meal, and now 2 more in the freezer.

Very tasty.  I seasoned my roast with salt and pepper, seared it in a Dutch oven to lock in the flavor and then put it in the slow cooker. Delicious!

I made this a few days ago. I followed the recipe exactly. Then I let it cool, and refrigerated over night. In the morning I was able to remove all the fat from the top. After rewarming the crockpot, I shredded the meat and cooked it on low for 2 hours. It was delicious!! Thank you for the recipe, I will no longer buy roast beef from the deli for French dip.

De-li-cious.  This was fantastic.  I halved the water and added a 1/2 cup of red wine.  Will most definitely make again.  I had leftovers but only because there are only two of us.

Absolutely delicious.  Only changes we made was to use only half of the onion mix and added a raw onion.  Only had to cook on high about 2 1/2 hrs in my crockpot to become tender.

Oh my gosh, this is an amazing recipe. My husband has always been dismissive of pot roast, but he couldn't get enough of this! The only thing we did differently was add some fresh cilantro -not much, maybe 2 tablespoons - about halfway through. Also, living at sea level as we do, we didn't have to cook it as long...I think we started it in the slow cooker at 1:00 and it was ready by 6:00. But you  do have to let it cook slowly for an extended time to get the required tenderness. I then shredded it and served it on hamburger buns to my husband and son. For myself, I mixed some of the  shredded beef with some mayo, salt and pepper and added a tblspoon of sweet relish for a roast beef sandwich. Delicious!

Really easy to make. I modified for sliced pepper jack cheese and about half a cup more of water to have more juice for dipping. Love this, it's a great recipe.

While rushing around like a crazy woman on Christmas Eve, I threw this roast in a slow cooker, added beefy onion soup mix, a cup of water, and turned it on high for 6 hours. ...then I left to run around some more. I forgot about it, so it stayed on 'warm' for 45 minutes or so, and was pull-apart-fork tender.  My family consumed the entire thing in less than 15 minutes....with zero leftovers.  Thrilled with the result!

Followed some advice of some prior reviewers and replaced some of the water  (1/4 cup) with red wine vinegar, cooked for about 9 hours on low.  Reheated in crockpot on low two days later for several hours and it was as good/better.  Just ate roast with a side of vegetables and egg noodles did not make sandwiches.  Awesome.  Bought 4lb butt roast on sale cooked half and froze the other half.  Will be using the same recipe for the other half.

I have made this several times and the family LOVES it!  My mom enjoyed it so much,  I passed the recipe on to her. I made zero alterations,  but would like to note that if you have leftovers,  you can toss that in a skillet with green chili's and make some seriously good tacos!

I made my own au jus with 4 cubes of beef bouillon, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, pepper and 4 cups of water. The meat just melted and we had plenty of juice to dip our sandwiches in. I might even add one more cup of water next time.

My husband and son gave this 2 thumbs up, I wasn't as impressed and just thought it was okay. I gave it 4 stars because it was simple to make on a busy work week and because I was overruled by the family :-) After shredding the meat and putting it back in the crock pot, the meat soaked up all the left over au jus and there was nothing left for dipping, although the meat was flavorful enough that you didn't really need more juice.

I used a 3 lb blade roast and put it on low overnight for about 17 hours, very tender and tasty. I used 2 cups water and rubbed the roast with pepper, onion powder and garlic. Served on toasted buns with horseradish mayo and skipped the cheese.

This one is hard to rate. This recipe is very tasty, but too greasy for me. It upset my stomach with all the grease. But, I do like it as a "roast" using a little bit of the sauce to pour over the meat. I don't think I will be shredding the meat in the future, but rather using this as a good pot roast recipe.

This is a great recipe and so simple too! I did think it needed a little more fluid in the crock than called for, so I used two cups of warm water w/ two beef bouillon cubes dissolved in it. I then added the au jus & soup mixes as called for and added a little dried onion, garlic powder, & lots of fresh cracked black pepper. The extra seasonings were really unnecessary as it would have been just as delicious w/o it. The only two things I would suggest are adding 2 cups in lieu of 1 and adding onions if you like them. We used hoagie rolls, which I split spread w/a thin layer of (homemade) Horseradish Creme, then added the shredded mozzarella and toasted them in a 350 oven for 7 mins. Then, added the shredded meat as directed & served w/fries and au jus. Though, the meat is so tender, flavorful & juicy, the au jus really wasn't necessary. Enjoy!

I've tried half a dozen similar recipes; this one is the best.  When I went to start it, the plumber was at my house and I had no water, so I used beer instead, it was great.  Also, I like to serve these with provolone cheese instead of mozzarella, less stringy.  I slice the roll in half and layer it with a slice of provolone so it's less messy.  Also, I like to add some pepperoncini to the sandwich!  Delicious!

Excellent recipe!!! Easy to make and very tasty. I have a small family and we had left-overs for days and it tasted great every time we made a sandwich. I sliced a medium onion into thin rings and put it in the pot for the last 2 hours. Next time I make this, and I will make this again for sure, I'm going to add some fresh sliced mushrooms.

made as is but slow cooked on low for about 9 hours. cut fat off before. very flavorful. only made about 3 sandwiches using full hoagie rolls.
