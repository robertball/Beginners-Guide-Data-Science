Very simple recipe...but topping is very dry...I used brown sugar for the top...maybe white sugar would be better (like the recipe says!).  Just my 2Â¢

The batter is very basic and slightly bland. The topping was dry and fell off if you don't press it into the batter. This would be good with a few adjustments. I did use brown sugar for topping and chopped pecans. as we don't eat a lot of walnuts. This would still go good with a latte or cappuccino for a quick breakfast.
