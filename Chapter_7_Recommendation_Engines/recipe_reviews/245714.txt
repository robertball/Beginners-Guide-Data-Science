This was very good. We like cooking for adventure.  I made my own dough seasoned with garlic and rosemary.  I grilled white potatoes using water as advised when grilling in the bacon grease to crisp up and with maple smoked bacon . Very caloric! But everyone liked it after convincing them to try it! ;)  I posted a photo in the photo section but the app should allow this.

Delicious! I did not use the recipe for the dough, b/c I made my own, but I followed the recipe for the sauce and ingredients. No red potatoes in the house, so I used regular ones, which worked fine. We really enjoyed the flavors of this pizza and I will definitely be making it again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
