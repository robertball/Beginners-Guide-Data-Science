Absolutely delicious! I actually replace some of the oil/butter called for in the cake mix recipe with applesauce--intensifies the flavor and makes this cake so moist, it melts in your mouth! :) I've also used more than 2 apples without a problem...

DELICIOUS! A boxed cake mix that doesn't taste like a "boxed cake mix"! I did add additional cinnamon and at least 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Didn't have a tube pan, plus my cake mix didn't have directions on the box for one either. I used a bundt pan, baked at 375 for 30 mins. let cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan. A small amount of cake stuck in the pan (this may be because I was out of shortening so I had to use pam to coat). Very Moist and Very Flavorful. Topped with Butterscotch Sauce II recipe.

This was way too easy to be this good!  Instead of using oil in the cake mix I used cinnamon applesauce.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. We topped ours with cool whip.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!

The result was delicious.  Some comments:  Mix box does not have a size 10 tube pan as one of the sizes to use.  The bundt pan is probably the smallest you can use.  Batter is voluminous and wouldn't fit into a 10 tube.  I used a 13x9 and it worked fine; not as pretty. Cinnamon taste was not strong, might add a bit more the next time. I was also thinking of adding apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.

I didn't try this so I have to rely on hub's review.  He found this nice and appley, like a fresh apple pie, with a pleasant balance of cinnamon and sweetness.  There was something off putting about it though, he said, and my guess is that he found that the boxed cake mix taste shined through.  He said that while it was good, it was not stellar, just average. His favorite part was the butterscotch chips/toasted chopped pecan topping and the caramel glaze I topped it with. (For the caramel glaze I melted some caramel ice cream topping with butter, then added powdered sugar until desired consistency.  A perfectly acceptable, but only average, cake. Following day update: First, I forgot to mention that I substituted apple juice for the water called for in the recipe. Second, hubs brought the cake to work this morning and it was gone just a few hours later. And a co-worker personally took the time to email me that the cake was...."heaven."  I guess I need to change my rating from 3 stars to 4!

I tried this twice - once as it's written and once with ground cardamom instead of cinnamonand with a butter recipe mix - yummy both times.   I love cooking, but since baking isn't my thing, all recipes that start with a mix are terrific!

As is, the recipe is flavourless but very moist.

It needed adjustment to make it flavourful.  I mixed 2Tbsp flour with 2Tbsp cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup brown sugar and mixed it into the diced apples before folding them into the batter. Walnuts add texture if you're interested in nuts. These changes elevate the recipe to a 5.

The name is right. It is easy.  I used a homemade cake mix but added the additional ingredients for an apple twist.  Loved it.  I might even add a little nutmeg, or other spices and a butter mix to give it an apple pie feel.

This cake was awesome! I used canned apples in water and used the juice from the can for part of the water for the cake mix. I put chopped walnuts on the bottom of my Bundt pan and poured the batter over. Glazed with mixture of powdered sugar, cinnamon and apple juice. Was a big hit!

This cake was really easy, I did modify it though.  I added 2 Tbs of sour cream, added 1/2 TBS of Nutmeg and 2TBS of cinnamon, I used butter yellow cake instead of one requiring oil, 2 apples grated and 1 diced and 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Also i drizzled a vanilla glaze over the top. It was gone in 15 minutes.

Extremely easy to make and very light! I added brown sugar and walnuts to the bottom of the bundt pan before putting in the batter. It was a huge success in my house!

WOW! Just as delicious and moist as it is easy. I'm impressed and the cake is already almost half gone. Used 3 apples and topped with a caramel glaze from another recipe on this website.
This one's a keeper!

This recipe is great! My family and friends love this when I have made it. People don't even believe it starts as a box cake. I have made some changes to the recipe. I use cinnamon applesauce instead of oil. I also use equal parts water and apple juice. I add more apple to the recipe as well. It comes out so moist and juicy. I then use the Caramel frosting I recipe on this site. It is the perfect compliment to the apples. Try it!!

This was great! Used 1/2 amount of oil called for and added applesauce for rest. 
Made pumpkin cream cheese for an extra nice treat. (4oz reg cream cheese/4oz low fat cream cheese/1/2c pumpkin/ 1tsp vanilla/4T brown sugar) Served a dollop with those that wanted it. :)  Super yummy!!

After being left with several pounds of apples after a school event for my daughter's Winter Guard team, I've been searching high and low for recipes with apples in them so all these beautiful apples wouldn't have to be thrown out! When I found this cake it seemed too easy, but hey, I'm all about easy this time of year, so I gave it a try! This has to be by far the best cake I've made in quite a while! I did replace the oil for the cake mix with cinnamon applesauce after reading one of the reviews, and added a little more chopped apple...and wow, what a cake! So easy and so good, this will become a frequent flier at our house! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I just made this . very good & easy . You could easily pass this off as home made. I was out of oil so I subst. an individual cinnamon applesauce like was suggested by many. This made the cake really moist. I also sprayed the bundt pan & dusted with sugar instead of flour. This makes it sweet enough..no glaze/ frosting needed.

Wonderful cake! Followed recipe exactly, except for adding some grains of freshly grated nutmeg along with the cinnamon. I used a tube pan that has a wide hole in the center, about 3 or 4 inches, so the cake is a big "donut" shape. So moist! A nice maple glaze is perfect. 

****MAPLE GLAZE********

1/4 C. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter; 
2 T. pure maple syrup; 
2 T. whipping cream; 
6 T. powdered sugar, sifted; 
12 walnut halves.   
Melt butter with maple syrup and cream in heavy small saucepan. Remove from heat.  Add powdered sugar and whisk until smooth. Cool glaze until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Drizzle glaze over cake. Arrange walnut halves decoratively on top of cake. 
Let cake stand until glaze sets, about 15 minutes.

Very easy, extra moist cake.  The cinnamon changes the appearance of the cake enough that it doesn't look like a box cake.  I took this to work and everybody loved it.  Can't believe it is so easy! Will definitely make it again.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, the cake is moist and delicious.  Be sure to use the full amount of Granny Smith apples chopped fine, the flavor it adds is amazing.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this for thanksgiving. I made a simple homemade yellow cake from scratch and followed all the rest of the directions.  no temp on the recipe so I baked on 350 degrees in a bundt pan, no 10 inch tube pan.  Took forever to bake and then it fell when I took it out of the oven. I will have to say that the cake itself was very good and moist.  am going to try this cake again in a different pan. directions could of been better on what temp to use instead of bake in the preheated oven. Do you use the temp on the cake mix box or in my case the homemade cake mix? actually I would of gave it less stars if it hadn't tasted so good just because of the flustration of trying to figure out how long it had to bake at a guessed temperature.

Delicious! I used 3 macintosh apples because they were in season locally.  I glazed the top with a basic vanilla glaze which made it pretty to bring to work but was not necessary.  Cake is plenty sweet and moist.

My house smelled amazing & my kids said the cake "tasted like Thanksgiving."  Will definitely make this again. Thank you Cindy!

Since I used a mix, I did notice a slight fake vanilla taste. This one was a hard sell at a potluck. Took it home to my fiance, and he said he was glad it didn't get much play since it was so good.

Good recipe.  Don't use a cake mix that uses butter instead of oil--didn't taste as good.

This is just as the recipe says... super duper easy AND super duper YUMMY! I have made it with both name brand cake mix and a generic cake mix. I would suggest only using the name brand mix. We served it with a scoop of Cool Whip. Perfect!

This was easy and delicious!  I did have a problem with the consistency, but that's more a high altitude issue than the recipe.  So good it's almost gone and I made it today!

The cake is delish and very easy.  I made them into cupcakes for my daughter's b-day and they didn't rise at all, one batch (the 1st) even shrunk.  I don't know if the cinnamon impeded the baking powder/soda or if the apple just had that affect.  Anyway, they are good, not to sweet that I can't frost them, and not "heavy", the chunks of fresh apple are really nice.  One more thing is that I put in a snack cup of apple sauce rather than oil, very moist.

This was great - does NOT taste like a boxed mix.  I used 3 gala apples, and took another reviewers suggestion and mixed  2Tbsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup brown sugar into the diced apples before folding them into the batter.

I did slightly more than 1 T. cinnamon, added 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1 t. vanilla.  I subbed applesauce for the oil.  It was fine.  Kenny liked it, I think I just expected it to be a little bit better somehow.

This was very good for a boxed cake mix. I felt like I was cheating! Based of reviews I added more cinnamon and replaced some of the oil with applesauce. It was delicious. I made mini muffins and various loaf pan sizes for a bake sale and all of them sold. I cut one up for sampling and got great reviews. it's a keeper.

I was rather disappointed with this recipe. With the high rating it got and others' rave reviews, I expected much more. I made a few adjustments as mentioned in other reviews such as increasing the cinnamon by 1+ teaspoons and adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg, as well as adding 1/4 cup applesauce to replace some of the oil, but the flavor is still surprisingly BLAND! Sure, it is "super duper" moist, but to me the flavor in this is almost non-existent. Would definitely not make again!!

The cake tasted great and smelled heavenly coming out of the oven. I added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg as other reviewers had suggested. Rather than dicing the apples, I used a coarse grater, which I found to be much easier than dicing them! The cake was moist but a little on the crumbly side. But that may have been the cake mix I used. It only said to bake in a tube pan for 40 minutes. I was in a rush and didn't perform the toothpick test. I will definitely try it again, but bake it for longer next time. We still enjoyed mashing the crumbs together into cake balls to eat! If it's not crumbly the next time, I'll change my rating to 5 stars! This recipe felt like homemade!

Such a good cake!  Very moist, I added a 1/2 of an apple more just because I just love the texture of them and it turned out great. It really does taste homemade.

This cake lives up to the name!  I added more cinnamon than the recipe called for and it gave it a cinnamon zing!  I also drizzled caramel sauce over the top and it was delicious!!  The cake turned out incredibly moist!  I recommend this cake to anyone who needs a quick yummy dessert!  I'm planning on using this as a go-to brunch recipe! It's GREAT!!

Super easy! I used a box of spice cake mix and omitted the  cinnamon. I also used 3 apples. Came out nice and moist. Will make again!

I substituted fuji apple clear america sparkling water, for 3/4 cup of the cake mix water.  I also added cardamom to the mix.  Made into mini bundt cakes and melted hersheys gold candy on top.  tasted like a carmel apple cake.

No I didn’t make any changes. I felt it wasn’t dense enough. Also... I’d never use a bundt pan for this recipe ... I followed the instructions to a ‘t’ and it did not come out well and didn’t really seem like a bundt cake to me. I wouldn’t make this again   Very disappointed

Disappointing. Made cake as directed subbing applesauce for oil and cake was moist but bland tasting. Definitely needs more flavor. Next time I'll add some nutmeg, allspice & cloves & see if that gives it more flavor.

I just made this, and I used eggnog in place of the water on the cake mix box, and i did do a drizzle of powdered sugar/milk/vanilla on top. I used Granny Smith apples and did not peel them. put them in the food processor to chop them up. It was gone in 10 minutes

My son and I made this today as dessert for Rosh Hashanah and My whole family loved it! We used apples my daughter and husband had picked and the house smelled so goodI I can't wait to have some with coffee tomorrow and will never again make yellow cake mix without adding (at least) cinnamon and vanilla!

I took suggestions from other reviews. I tossed the apples with cinnamon and nutmeg before folding into cake batter. I added a hand full of chopped walnuts too.  Tasty and moist.  I sprinkled confectioners sugar for extra flavor and presentation!

This cake was so easy and absolutely moist and delicious.  I also added nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar. This cake is perfect for breakfast with coffee too. I did not make mine in the tube pan. I made it in the sheet pan.  Great recipe.  Thank you very much.  -  Mari

It's definitely easy, but, for me, it just doesn't have that home-cooked taste. It has an"industrial" taste.

This tasted like a yellow cake with some apple pieces. I will make it again but try it in a different pan. I'm sure it was my own cooking of it and not the recipe itself.

I used an extra 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon. And I used canned apples for pie. I didn't drain them, I just chopped them fine. I made muffins with this recipe. The kids went nuts over them. I am wondering what did Cindy put on top of her cake? You can see something in the photo, but it's not in the recipe. I found a wonderful pecan glaze. It turned out great, we will be making this at thanks giving and christmas. Also if you have leftover apple cake, after about 3 days you should refrigerate, you can reheat in microwave, about 10 seconds for muffins. I had enough batter to make 30 full size muffins.

great recipe -very easy and  very moist ! I took a number of other members suggestions from the reviews and used all of  them . I used 4 apples, added an extra  teaspoon of cinnamon, substituted cinnamon apple sauce for the oil, substituted apple juice for the water, add 2 tablespoons of sour cream . I used a caramel frosting from this site which was good but makes enough for 2 cakes . I will try caramel ice cream topping next time .

This was pretty good.  As per other reviewers' suggestions, I added nutmeg and cinnamon.  I didn't have yellow cake mix, so I used Duncan Heinz butter cake mix.  It came out very moist.  I think it will be very nice with walnuts too.

This cake had a very nice taste and was easy to make.
The only problem was that since it was made from a cake mix it was very hard to get nice slices, it crumbled when sliced. Also the apples ended up sinking to the bottom.

This was very good and super easy, but I wouldn't say it was "out of this world" good.  My picky daughter loved it and so did my even pickier husband.  It is definitely worth making though and I will make this again!

made this today for a school fall bake sale.waited till last minute so needed something quick and easy and these are. made it into cupcakes without any problems, cooked per cake mix directions for cupcakes. mine rose fine. i didnt have GS apples (used macintosh) so i think that maybe why i didnt get a really good apple flavor but they were still good.

Gone in no time.  Just had some apples and often just make pies.  But this is a great alternative and is even easier.  Taste great.
