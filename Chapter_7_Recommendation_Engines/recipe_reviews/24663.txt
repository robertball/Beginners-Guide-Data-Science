My friends raved and raved about this seafood dip!  We did not have chili sauce so we added several Tablespoons of chili powder (to taste) and it was very very good.  We served w/shrimp that had been sauted in olive oil, garlic, chopped jalapeno peppers. Awesome w/just the right amount of kick!

Very Good low fat substitute for the same old cocktail sauce.

Tasty and easy. I am a traditional cocktail sauce girl, so this will not be my first choice, BUT it's great to have both available for guests. It is a little sweeter, but my guests really loved having both dips available. Thanks!
