3.7.19  I made this exactly as written and was a little let down in the depth of tomato flavor.  Tomato soup is just about my favorite soup, I’ve made a good number of recipes on this site, and I was longing for more intense, rich tomato flavor, even after  adding more tomato paste.  I did like the texture that all of the chopped veggies brought to the soup, as well as its creaminess, but it simply was not as robust as I would have liked.  I might try this again with the suggestion of another reviewer to use  tomato juice instead of vegetable broth, maybe even V8 Spicy.  This is not one of those “throw everything in the pot Instant Pot®” recipes, took a little time to make, and again, although it was OK, I still was a bit disappointed.

This was so easy and tastey. I didn’t have celery on hand, so I doubled the amount if carrots I used and also tossed in bell peppers.

I doubled the tomatoes and used a whole can of tomato paste because I like thick and hearty tomato soups. I doubled the garlic too. I had a roasted bulb of fennel I added too at the initial sauté stage . I cooked on high for 10 minutes instead of 6 since I doubled the amount of tomatoes. I made the roux as directed and used powdered milk cause that’s what I had. I added a cup of fresh grated grana padano and  parm. I did add the hot pepper flakes as well. Immersion blended together and WOW! Perfect October Sunday dinner. Made giant croutons out of day-old French bread dusted with olive oil and dried fennel to accompany. I would make this again and serve it to guests proudly.

used tomato juice instead of vegetable broth, used 1/4 tsp  basal, added 2 tsp of oregano, used 1/2 cup half and half, 1/2 cup skim milk.  When soup was done i stirred in 8 ounces of cheddar cheese cut up and heated through.
