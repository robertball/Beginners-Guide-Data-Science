Guess I changed this recipe to "Italian More Than One Step Casserole".  Instead of throwing everything directly into the oven, I fried the breakfast turkey sausage, red onion, chopped cauliflower(7x8ziplock bag amount),(instead of carrots), and spices in a non-stick frying pan.  Added garlic powder and basil, less salt, and more oregano & pepper.  While doing this I boiled the potatoes and sprayed the roasting pan with oil.  Dumped everything into the pan and topped with canned whole tomatoes, Mozza, and parmesan cheese.  Baked covered for 20 minutes.  It was juicy, Absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks Michele!

Delicious - my husband wants this often!  It did take longer to bake than the recipe indicated.  Oh, and I've used half sweet potatoes and half white ones - it was wonderful.

My husband doesn't like tomato chunks, so I substituted a mixture of strained juice from a can of tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste and some leftover taco sauce. This worked very well.

Others have suggested adding parmesan cheese. I added some grated parmesan and cheddar for the last 20 minutes, and it was wonderful.

I found that I had to cook the casserole for 20 minutes more than the recipe called for, and even then some potatoes were a little crunchy.

Overall, a delicious recipe. We'll definitely make it again.

I really liked the idea of this recipe but was a little disappointed in the results. It was incredibly easy, which is a big plus. But I found it to be quite bland, and I was much more generous with the Oregano and pepper than the "pinch" of each called for in the recipe. I will more than likely try this one again but alter it somewhat to zip up the flavor, using garlic and possibly seasoned diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes.

This was really good.  Browned the sausage with the veggies first to make sure they were cooked through.  Added garlic and added some parmesan cheese on top which was suggested in another review.  Would definitely make again.

This was a super easy recipe.  I used red potatoes, turkey sausage, green bell peppers instead of carrots, one can of stewed tomatoes, and one can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  This gave it a bit of heat.  Cutting the potatoes into smaller cubes reduces the cooking time.  Very tasty!

This was a hit with my husband, but not my kids (picky eaters).  I used spicy Italian sausage and added a lot more garlic and oregano than the recipe called for. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. It took a long time for the potatoes cook though. Next time I will parboil them first.

SOOOO GOOOOOOD!- That's what my huband said when we had this tasty dish the other night. I did change things up just a little though. I used a mild Italian sausage with sweet basil, a 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes, a 14 oz. can of Italian diced tomatoes, and added a layer of cheese for the last 10ish minutes of baking. Goes great with a fresh salad and garlic bread or sourdough. We are definitely going to be having this often!!!!

We enjoyed this.  I browned the sausage first but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used a good quality, spicy Italian sausage which added to the success of the recipe.

Not very tasty at all...needs a lot more seasoning AND it took forever for the vegetables to soften...I used the crushed tomatoes, but would be much better to use the same amount of canned, diced tomatoes.

Added some parsley, basil and parmesan cheese on top.  Was very good.  A good recipe if you want to have italian sausage but you don't want spaghetti and sauce with it.

We liked this the first time.  The second time, I browned the sausage a bit and sliced it before putting into the recipe and used stewed tomatoes. Also, did a mix of sweet and hot sausage.

It's a great idea and an excellent start. I added extra veggies to mine and spiced the sauce the way my family likes. I like the idea of the casserole. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband made this for us and our three VERY picky children tonight.  We all thought it tasted wonderful- the kids all had seconds, which is saying a lot, considering it was something different, and chock full of veggies they normally refuse to eat!  It was very colorful and filling as well.  The only change he made was to omit the carrots, as we didn't have any, and it was still fine. Hubby says the only thing keeping this from being a 5 star recipe was that he had to bake it over a half hour longer than specified to get all the veggies tender, however, this seemed to carmelize the onions, so it worked out well.  Served with Italian bread, everyone left the table stuffed!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a definite keeper!

Tasted ok, once it was cooked!!!  Took twice as long as it said, before the vegetables were cooked through.  Next time - if there is one - I will par boil the potatoes & carrot first to save an extra hour in the oven.  Oh & I will stir it through a couple of times while it is cooking.

I will probably make this again because it can make a very healthy and economical meal.  But it really isn't very kid friendly and isn't very appetizing looking.  But it tastes wholesome and smells wonderful while it's cooking.

I used healthy choice sausage instead of regular sausage to cut fat.  It was as good as low-fat gets.  And I also sprinkled just a little bit of grated parmesan on top to make it look a little more appetizing.

Very good flavor for very little work!  The only change I made was to use a red onion.  Mix veggies well with loose (uncooked) sausage.  Poured on only used 8 oz. of my own canned crushed tomatoes.  Added some garlic powder and sprinkled with dried basil instead of oregano (just preference).  Baked covered one hour until veggies tender, then uncovered until sausage well browned.  Hubby called it an "again" meal!!!!

This recipe was a little bland for my taste.  I did use ground beef instead of sausage though, so that might have been a lot of the problem.

Very good.  I will make this again...and may add some squash or zucchini next time!  Changes... I used a can of Tomato Bisque soup because I didn't have any crushed toms. on hand. Also - put it in the Pampered Chef Covered Baker and  microwaved it for 30 minutes (I didn't want to turn the oven on as it is summertime).

Very tasty! I didn't have any canned tomatoes on hand, but I did have a jar of tomato pesto. I put that on the top of vegetables and added one can of chicken broth and 2 cups of water. My son hates chunks of tomatoes. This flavored it nicely and everyone enjoyed!

I tried this for dinner tonite. Of course I made some changes. I did not use the carrots but used a 8 oz. package of frozen thingreen beans. Instead of the crushed tomatoes I used 2 15oz cans stewed tomatoes. Pureed them in a blender with garlic powder ,basil and oregano. I did have to cook longer than it said in the recipe. 1 1/2 hrs covered and 30 minutes uncovered. Very tasty, with the spices that I added. I will make this casserole again.

This was good and I'll make it again, but it wasn't anything special.  I did season everything with quite a bit of Italian Seasoning and garlic.  cooked it at least 1 1/2 hrs.  Family liked it and we had leftovers for another complete meal.  I had never added sausage to my roasted veggies before, and it is very tasty cooked that way.

This is one of my husband's favorites!  I usually add whatever vegetables I have on hand.  It always turns out great!

I was incredibly skeptical about this - it just seemed too easy. I was, however, very pleasantly surprised! I added a lot of garlic powder and Italian seasoning because I thought it might be a little bland. The dish was rather full with just 2 cans of tomatoes, so I added some V8 veggie juice. Finally, I used beer-flavored brats because that's what I had on hand. Don't be fooled by its simplicity! Thanks, Michele!

this recipe was delicious and extremely easy to prepare (and I prepared this in a dorm kitchen!). Cook for an hour or so to make the carrots and potatoes tender. I also used alot more diced tomatoes with juice than was in the recipe. This is definately going to be a staple in my apartment. I can't wait to make it for my mom!

This recipe was very good.  I did add more italian spices to it.  Because I love spicy food, I added crushed red pepper.  I didn't have potatoes, so I used broccoli and carrots in this recipe and it still came out great.  Definately will make again and hopefully make it more the way this recipe calls for.

I topped this with mozarella cheese and really enjoyed it.My husband thought it should have been cooked longer as he claimed his carrots and potatoes were too "crunchy"-however he did like the flavour.

I read the reviews and changed the recipe. I browned the sausage, sliced potatoes, added browned red onions and red pepper. (did not brown carrots- will not use the next time) Then I put everything in a casserole and added crushed whole tomatoes+ juice, salt & pepper and oregano and baked covered at 375 for 1 hour-uncovered and baked for 15 min. more - The red pepper and onions really added to the taste - it was Delicious!

GREAT EASY. I adjusted this for 18 people and even added a bit more of each. I used 4  cans  28 oz diced tomatoes with herbs and spices. I also added 1 1/2 tbsp. Italian seasoning., plus
chopped up many  roasted garlic cloves from a grocery deli.
I cut the half frozen sausage with scissors into chunks and sauteed . I roasted all the vegetables ahead of time and added sausage for last bit of cooking with a bit of wine. Smells great.
We will have some for dinner to sample, but will freeze rest as my start to getting ready for a family gathering. I will report  back.

This was great! I only had to add 10 extra minutes of cooking time. I used Italian sausage. I used 4 small golden potatoes which was the perfect amount. I mixed 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp parsley and 1 T basil with the tomatoes. Sprinkled in Parmesan cheese the last 30 minutes! Yum! The only thing is it had a lot of extra juice from the tomatoes. Next time I will only use 2 cans crushed tomatoes.

I like this recipe a lot, but my husband doesn't care for it.  I always use the spicy italian sausage to give it a little kick.  I would recommend pouring off some of the juices from the tomatoes as it does tend to get a little soupy.

I made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was a very strange recipe. Could not figure out what it was supposed to be.
But it was very tasty,very good.  I added a half can of rotel tomatoes, and pepper jack cheese the last 15mins.
My husband and I both enjoyed. This is not my style of cooking. Seems too easy and strange ingredients. But I will have to give it 4 stars!

It was a great recipe but took too long to cook.  I would pre cook the carrots and potatoes first.

I cranked up on spices.  I used hot Italian sausage,  a table spoon of oregano and a teaspoon of basil.  Also put two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce in there as well.  It was barely tolerable at that.  Probably should have used diced tomatoes rather than crushed as well.  I don't anticipate making this recipe again.  If I do I'll be adding a bunch of garlic too.

Fantastic.  I made my own Italian Turkey Sausage and added cauliflower, halved brussel sprouts, and bell pepper to the veges.  I also browned off the meat and onion in my cast iron pan, then put the whole thing in the oven with the lid on.  Husband and brother both loved it.  Thank you for the great base.

This was an edible recipe mostly after I added a lot of cheese so that we could eat it and semi enjoy and not waste the food.  I would not say by any means that this is an outstanding recipe.  I am giving two stars since we were able to eat this casserole, but it really needs some improvements to make to a 5 star rating.  It was very bland without additions of cheese and other spices.  It also took twice the time to bake then was stated.

This was just okay.  It was a convenient way to make an easy meal with things I had on hand, and it was certainly a decent meal, but I think I will look for another recipe next time I want to make something along these lines.  I did add to the spices, and I reduced the tomatoes as some reviewers have suggested.  The proportion of the ingredients was fine, it just seemed to be a pile of ingredients, and lacked something to hold it together or make it seem like it was complete.

I had guests over and asked them to help me rate this recipe.  The comments I heard were mostly - it would be better with noodles versus potatoes and there needs to be more spices, so I would try the recipe with additional spices and perhaps noodles versus potatoes.

Very easy preperation.  Good with a salad.  Needs a bit more flavour though, maybe try seasoned tomatoes, like Italian or garlic.

Big hit at my house, and so easy.  I agree with another review, don't think this is not going to be flavorful because of the few ingredients.  We loved it.
