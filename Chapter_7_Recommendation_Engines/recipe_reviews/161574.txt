This was an OK recipe. I added a bit of splenda since it had an almost bitter taste to it. My husband liked it which surprised me as he doens't care for Cumin and that was a major flavor to this. Will make it again, but keep tweaking a bit until satisifed.

We are a pretty healthy couple, so we try to find easy, healthy recipes. Just for future reference, we liked the way this recipe worked, on the other hand, we did not use any chili powder, and did not marinate the chicken over night. We simply mixed together the ingredients, and spread them over a few pieces of provolone cheese which we put on top of the chicken before popping it into the oven. It came out smelling great and went well with green beans. Thanks!

i used lite soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce and brown spice mustard instead of dijon. also added a 1/2 teaspoon curry powder and a little less ginger. a litte olive oil in the bottom of the dish. It was wonderful!! Had it with broccoli, cauliflower, and rice.

Not that great. I scaled it down for two chicken breasts, and reduced the ratio of Worchestershire and chili powder to mustard, but it was still too much. I tried adding brown sugar to mellow it out, but it must not been enough, because it was still very bitter after cooked. This one has potential, but needs major tweaking to make it tasty.

I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used yellow mustard. I followed the recipe for everything else. I loved it and so did my husband!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Great flavor. I cut it down for just my family and added some cayenne pepper. I didn't realize it was supposed to marinate until it was to late, so I just let the chicken set in it for about 10 minutes. Served with brown rice and green beans.
