I have made this recipe twice now--my husband and I love it for a dinner meal. It's quick and you can substitute other meats that you happen to have in the fridge, like ham. (Although I like the bacon better!) Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Oh, this quiche was delicious!  The caramelized onions really made the difference--well worth the effort to make.  I had serious doubts about using the canned refigerated pizza crust since I've had lots of trouble in the past with a soggy/not done crust in the bottom center. . .but it worked out great.  The crust was wonderful.  This could also be made a day ahead if you're having guests.  The flavors seem even better and more blended--and the crust held up great.  Just reheat in the micro or oven.  Nice recipe.

Excellent quiche, and really easy to make. Be sure not to skimp out on any of the onions - the flavour is wonderful!  The pizza crust, while unbeatable for efficiency, doesn't really have the right consistency or texture for a quiche crust.  If you have the time, use another recipe for the crust.  If not, it's really not all that terrible.  It's my only complaint!

I made this for Christmas-morning breakfast and everyone gushed about it. I traded out Canadian bacon for two strips of applewood-smoked bacon. My dad almost wet himself over how much he liked it. I'd like to see if I can get a bit of the fat out of the crust so that I feel better by adding a few grams with the bacon. I think the bacon works much better with the onions than Canadian bacon.

While I loved the flavor of this quiche, and the fact that it was a "light" recipe, I won't be making it again.  For dinner tonight, I made this quiche and the "easy quiche."  While my husband and I agreed that the flavor of this quiche was slightly better, we really didn't like the pizza dough crust, and I just felt that it took too much time.  In the future, I'll use the easy quiche recipe but use caramalized onion, bacon and spinach instead of the broccoli and ham that recipe calls for.

I made this for a baby shower luncheon.   I was worried because I had not made this exact recipe before, this quiche was better than the other two I have been making for years!

I made this this evening and while it was very tasty, I had a very hard time with the pizza dough resulting in a very chewy crust. Also my amateur attepmt at preparing the dough called for a thick mess that tore and did not fit the pan allowing a good amount of excess liquid to spill on to the counter and drip onto the floor (the dog didn't mind!) I will use the prepared crust (thus negating the light concept) in the future to make this a truely easy quiche.
My husband and I both love this and for 5 points per slice, it's a keeper! : )

I did not make my own crust, but rather opted to use a store-bought pie crust. Next time I would omit the bacon all together as the flavor of it didn't really go well with the rest of the ingredients. I also topped it with mozzarella cheese as that is what I had on hand.

Great base recipe!

I used a store-bought pie crust, and honestly, that was the best thing about this dish. We like all of the ingredients, but the combination didn't taste right. It definitely needed more salt in the spinach layer. I'm wondering if it would taste better if you combined all of the ingredients rather than layering. Anyway, most of ours went in the garbage.

A friend sent me this recipes a few years ago and it's become a favorite in our house.  I also use the store bought deep-dish pie shell.  I no longer even look at the recipe when I make it.  I use whatever I have on hand, so sometimes the sour cream or  evaportated skim milk is left out.  It never affects the final taste.  This is a great quiche for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner.
