This has been a family favorite for 40 years or more! I have a couple of adaptations, though:  Add a dash or two of cinnamon in the cake part.  It improves the taste and color.  Add a tablespoon or two more of sugar in the cake part for added sweetness.  WE LOVE THE STREUSEL TOPPING! So I double the recipe for the topping.  Also include nuts (walnut or pecans).  Which brings me to the next point:  Not everyone likes nuts, so I bake these as either regular muffins or mini-muffins.  Half the batch is made without nuts in the topping. The other half has nuts as indicated by a piece of nut clearly showing on top.  The muffins/mini-muffins work spectacularly well with this recipe. They are cute as buttons and everyone can choose their preferred style.

I like that this recipe is really easy and quick to put together. A added bonus for the minimal ingredients.  I followed the recipe except I used a 8" round pan and had to bake mine for 20 minutes.  I was a little concerened that the cake part would not be sweet enough with only 2 TBSP of sugar, but the cinnamon streusel on top balanced the sweetness very nicely.  I like this coffee cake but I found it a little dry. I would certainly make again as it was so easy to put together and took no time at all to bake.  THX

This was a quick and easy substitute for my kid's cinnamon roll craving.  I added 1/3 C extra milk & 1/2 t vanilla to the cake mix then I made a cream cheese frosting to take it to that cinnamon roll level: 1/2 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened  2 tablespoons butter, softened  3/4 cup confectioners' sugar  1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract  1/8 teaspoon salt  Yummy!!!!

I have read a few reviews that mention this recipe being dry. If you add 1/2 cup of apple sauce, this will be so very moist! Also to add different flavors, you may use one of the delicious flavored liquid coffee creamers and water. for the same amount of liquid as recipe.

This was very good but I agree with the member named Cookies...its very dry! I think next time I'll add more milk or maybe I'll add apples to give it some moistness. I will definitely make this again...very easy!

Super fast and easy.  I added about 1 and 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries, and had to bake it an extra 20 minutes.  Good with ice cream.

Very easy and will definitely make again.  I agree with the others that it is a little dry.  In the future I will add a little more milk and maybe vanilla extract.

This didn't do well for me. I added an extra 3/4 a cup of milk and it still came out dry. When the cake came out of the oven, the cake had deep crevices in it  and the streusel didn't totally cover the cake. I am not sure how this happened but it might have been the streusel mixture and the sprinkling of it.

Simple, light and fluffy.  Not a lot of flavor in the cake, but the topping is very good.  I think this would be nice with some apples or blueberries mixed into the cake.

This coffee cake is the best coffee cake I've ever had! It was moist and I enjoyed it very much! Easy to make, and not many ingredients needed! Great for people on the go who don't have a lot of ingredients laying around the kitchen!! Simple, and delicious! I will make this again!

After reading other reviews stating the cake part was bland, I increased the amount of streudel and used a knife to cut some into the batter.  It tasted great.

My kids beg me to make this for them.  My extra for this recipe is chocolate chips.  Mix them in the cake and sprinkle on top before added the streusel topping.  To make it easier don't mix up the streusel...just sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on top.
It won't be as thick but my kids don't seem to miss it.

Very dry, and just tastes like the Bisquick.  There are better streusel coffee cake recipes out there, so I won't be making this again.

This was good, not great, just good. I think the coffee cake part needs more sugar, tasted a little bland. The topping is very good however. I think I will make this again and maybe just add more sugar.

Wow, I almost made myself sick off of this. It turned out awesome! I did add a little applesauce to the cake and I doubled the topping. I highly recommend it.

This is so good.  I added 1/3 plain Greek Yogurt to the cake batter.  It comes out so moist and super delish!

I agree with other reviewers to add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to the batter and doubling the streusel. I love cinnamon so I added extra to the topping. I also used 3 T of sour cream in the batter which added to the moistness and richness of the flavor. I think using buttermilk would also be a good idea in place of the milk or water the recipe calls for. (I would use 3/4 C of buttermilk).  Nothing is worse than dry coffee cake!  I was very pleased with the recipe with these couple of quick additions.

The top third was about the right ratio. The rest was dull.
