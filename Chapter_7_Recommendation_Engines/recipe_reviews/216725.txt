Great dish!  I've made mine pretty much the same way, but  never thought of the sherry, and that adds a great bit of oomph.  The mushrooms are fabulous, too.  Thanks, Carole!

Excellent recipe.  My husband is Italian and he said this recipe tasted and smelled just like what his mother used to make!  We added Italian peeled tomatoes which we hand crushed, 1/4 tsp oregano and 1/4 tsp of basil.  Also some fresh parsley.  Great one pot dish!!!!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and used all fresh ingredients. It was just plain bland. I will use more wine and more spices next time.

We weren't too crazy about this one.  My kids didn't care for the veggies/sauce, and even I didn't care for it after the first couple of bites.  Probably a good recipe for some, just not for us.
