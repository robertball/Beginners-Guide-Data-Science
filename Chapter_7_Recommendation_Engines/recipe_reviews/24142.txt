I made this using my Kitchen Aid mixer from start to finish. I did double the filling. I might triple it next time, for a deeper swirl. The dough came together beautifully (I've been having such issues with that lately) and rose like a champ. It's baking now, but I'll update after we've cut into it at tomorrow's breakfast. EDITED: Excellent bread. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet. The raisins add a nice touch. I couldn't wait for it to cool fully, I ate a piece warm with butter. Heavenly.
Cut well even warm, didn't fall apart like most cinnamon breads do. Perfection.
TIP: You might want to oil the pan down and make sure both sides of the loaf are oiled. It's a stickier bread, which means when it rises, you'll have a heck of a time getting it off the saran wrap if you don't. EDITED AGAIN: The vanilla glaze from this site is wonderful drizzled over warm slices of this bread. Just like a cinnamon roll!

I made this once to give it a try. LOVED it!  Only changes I made when making it again was to put a dash of cinnamon in the dough, added powdered milk and skipped adding the milk (to keep the dough more elastic instead of sticky) and soaked the raisins in water for about an hour before starting the recipe for the bread machine.
My whole family loved this recipe so much I made 15 loaves for a bake sale and sold out in less than an hour because I offered samples.
Thank you Joey for this awesome recipe!

HERE'S MY RECIPE NOT USING A BREAD MACHINE:
Soak 3/4 raisins in hot water for 1/2 hr. or till plump.  Drain and pat dry on paper towel. Set aside.
Dissolve 2 tsp. yeast and 1/2 tsp. sugar in 1/2 c. warm water - 95-105 degrees.  Proof for 10 minutes or until foamy. 
Melt shortening in 3/4 c. water and 1/4 milk. Cool.
Put salt, rest of sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon in large bowl.  Add cooled milk mixture and proofed yeast. Stir together. Stir in flour until batter leaves side of bowl.  Turn out onto lightly floured surface.  Knead in remaining flour adding 1/2 - 1 cup extra flour if necessary. Knead about 6-7 mins. adding in the raisins during the last couple of minutes of kneading.  Place in lightly oiled bowl. Turn dough over once in bowl to oil top side of dough. Cover with thin dishtowel and place in warm place to rise 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hrs. Punch down.  Separate dough into two halves.  Roll out each half of dough into rectangle (roughly 8 x 10").  Spread with softened butter and sprinkle with cinnamon brown sugar mixture (I doubled the filling).  Roll each rectangle up tightly and seal ends and fold under.  Place each rolled up dough in prepared pans, place towel over pans, let rise for another hour.  Bake as directed in recipe.

Maybe it's because I'm pregnant, but this bread was sooo good!  I had to add some more flour, about 1/4 cup, as it was too wet and sticky in the bread machine.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough and plumped up the raisins in boiling water before adding to the bread machine.  After rolling out, I doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling.  Baked exactly 30 minutes...perfect!

I make this bread all the time, it is that good.  I've been experimenting a little with it.  The last time, I added about 3/4 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup chopped granny smith apples.  Next time I think I'll add more apples!  It came out great.  I also use 2.5 cups bread flour and 1.5 cups wheat flour and that seems to give it the perfect balance between a wheat bread and a white bread.

So, I kept the basic bread part the same, but I added orange extract (1 TBLS) and some chopped apricots (about 1 CUP) to the dough as mixing.  You never need to add more flour than a recipe calls for, when it stops sticking and starts slapping the side of the bowl, it is ready to rise btw.  For the swirl, I used 1 egg(egg holds your sugars without splitting your bread) and 1 tea. orange extract and brushed that over the bread.  Then, I sprinked my brown sugar (1/2 cup), cinnamon (1.5 TBLS), clove (1/4 tea), and nutmeg(1/4 tea) over the bread and let it rise again.  Baked it for about 35 mins (but the best way to tell is with a thermometer reading at least 190 degrees).  This way the best bread I've made (and I make some pretty decent bread), and I probably ate most of 1 loaf all by myself!  Enjoy!

OMG -- this was SO GOOD!  I made a few changes per other reviewers.  First, I soaked the raisins in hot water to make them softer.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough ingredients, and I doubled the filling ingredients.  Lastly, I topped both loaves with a thick sugar glaze.  The loaves were soft & moist with a chewy texture.  My husband ate an entire loaf in one evening and said "You can't buy bread this good anywhere."  Amazing!!!

This recipe makes a very good cinnamon raisin bread. I had to add a little more flour, as the dough was very sticky. The loaves didn't rise as high as I had expected; may consider using a single 11"x5" loaf pan in the future. An additional 1/2 cup of raisins was added to the brown sugar and cinnamon prior to rolling. Some extra brown sugar was also added. Will definitely make this again.

this recipe doesn't say how much nuts to use.  I put in 1/2 cup.  My 2lb. bread machine took about 30minutes before the beep to add the nuts and raisins.  The rest was really easy also.  Everyone really liked it just out of the oven.  I'm sure it will be good toasted.  Thanks Michele

This was a really great loaf of bread! It came out soft and fragrant. My family gobbled it up. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

Here are some changes I made to make it 5 stars:

1. I used butter instead of shortening (not melted, just kneaded room temperature butter into the dough).

2. I used 1 1/2 cup of warm milk (microwaved) instead of warm water and omitted the 2 T of milk. Depending on the humidity, you might need to add more or less milk to get the dough at the right consistency. (If you are substituting whole wheat flour for some of the bread flour, you might need to add more liquid as well.)

3. I soaked the raisins in hot water before drying on a paper towel. This allows the raisins to remain moist and does not cause the raisins to pull moisture from the dough during baking.

4. I kneaded the raisins into the dough (gently or the raisins will tear) to get a more even distribution. After the first rising, I then rolled out the dough, brushed the top with some water and sprinkled the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture on top before rolling up (this also prevents the rolled up dough from pulling apart after baking). Sometimes I add crushed walnuts to this mixture for a nice crunch. 

5. To reduce calories, I did not use butter or brush the top of the loaf with butter. Did not miss it. Top of the loaf was soft even without the butter!

Overall, delicious recipe. Will continue to make in the future.

FANTASTIC!  This recipe really made for a FANTASTIC loaf of bread.  I plumped the raisins before adding.  I added them by just sprinkling them over the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Although I measured the filling, the next time I will just sprinkle it on as needed.  Thank you Dmseck for such a FANTASTIC recipe!

Tasty bread, easy to dry out though.  Easy to make.  I did not use a bread machine.  I also made it using cranberries instead of raisins, just as good.

AMAZING! This bread is heaven on earth. I have some suggestions, read below! I added a couple of dashes of pumpkin pie spice to the dough, doubled the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture to put inside, and I also added another cup of raisins on top of the cinnamon mixture/rolled out dough. If you don't want the bread to fall apart around the swirls do this: beat up an egg, and before adding the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture to the rolled out dough, brush the dough with the beaten egg. then add brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. Your bread will not fall apart.  A few tips: Use FRESH bread flour. If it's been sitting in your cupboards for a while, it'll taste stale and will make a big difference between fresh flour. Use FRESH yeast (check the date!) Check the temperature of your water for the dough. If you don't have a thermometer, just know that the water should be about body temperature. If it's even a few degrees too hot or too cold, it'll effect the texture of the bread. If you've ever felt a warm baby, the water should be about that temperature.  Heat up the milk you're adding. If the milk is cold, it'll cool off the warm water, and negatively effect the yeast. Just nuke it for about 15-20 seconds until it's warm. If the milk is too hot, let it sit out for a minute before adding to the water. Don't bake for more than 30 minutes!

Here is a tip on how to make this bread totally in the bread machine. Make dough using your regular cycle. About 5 minutes after the dough is done kneading, take the dough out and stretch the dough out on a floured board to about 9" x 13". Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon and about 3 T sugar (I don't use butter)  and roll up from the short end. Place the roll back in the bread machine and let it go through the rest of the cycle. Nothing smells better!

YUMMY - I say this as I am eating my second piece just out of the oven.  I was a little concerned that it would not turn out because the dough was like a thick cake dough - but it came out to be the best Cinnamon Raisin Bread I have ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added cinnamon to the batter.  I also plumped by raisins by bringing them to a boil in water and let them set for a few minutes.  I did use my bread maker to make the dough and added the raisins when the timer beeped.  Then I poured the dough onto a floured surface and kneaded it (adding a little flour) for about a minute.  I just shaped the dough into a rectangle and smeared my butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar on top - then rolled it up and put it into a Pyrex loaf pan, let it rise for an hour, then baked.  It came out perfect!!!  Excuse me while I cut a piece for my husband....

Delicious bread!  I doubled the filling recipe because I wanted it extra cinnamon-y and it was great.  This would be great with a powdered sugar glaze over the top after baking.  This would be a nice bread to give as thank you gifts or during the holidays.  Thanks for another great bread recipe!

Awesome bread! I doubled the filling recipe and used my Kitchenaid instead of a breadmaker. Left plumped raisins for the filling. I loved the not so sweetness of the bread and used bread flour for the first time instead of AP flour. What a difference in texture! Loved it and will make again. Saving a loaf (that's hard!) for Sunday a.m. breakfast.......

I am still working on my bread making skills, and even with my limited abilities this turned out really good. We couldn't stop eating it warm right out of the oven. I don't have a bread maker so I used my Kitchen Aid and kneaded the rest by hand. It tasted great with and without raisins.

Love it. Turned out perfect. Soft and stayed together. I didn't use a bread machine and next time I think I will try and add a little more cinnamon.

I use five Tablespoons of sugar to the bread recipe and add at least a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon as well. When this comes out of the bread machine, I let it rise for an hour in a warm place after I've swirled the butter and brown sugar into the dough and it allows for the bread to rise. Wonderful recipe. I've made it three times now (making 6 loaves.) I'm going to experiment with whole wheat flour next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This has become my "signature" bread.  I tweaked the recipe per other comments...adding a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough, soaking my raisins and doubling the filling.  

It also makes the best french toast...nice thick slices, warm maple syrup...absolutely delicious.

Very good.  I cut this into thirds (I think I rolled it out too long), made a regular size loaf, a smaller loaf, and some cinnamon rolls.  Very delicious!  I made the Cocoa Cinnamon Spread from here to go with it, so I used some of that to top the cinnamon rolls while they were still warm.  I forgot to add the raisins during the bread cycle so I just added it to the filling--which I didn't measure out, just sprinkled on until it looked good.  Wonderful bread, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  The texture of the bread is very soft and almost chewy...in a very good way. I doubled the raisins--kneaded a cup into dough after it was done proofing out of the breadmaker and then scattered the second cup on top of the cinnamon sugar filling before the final roll-up.  I actually added a Tbsp of "sweet dough flavor" from King Arthur Flour, some cinnamon and nutmeg into the dough--wonderful.  If you don't know what I am talking about, "sweet dough flavor" is a liquid flavoring that has the taste of butter, vanilla, and citrus.  I highly recommend it, but if you can't get it try some vanilla extract and orange extract.  I love this bread, you should definitely try it.

This was my first time with this type of bread. My bread was dense and soggy in the middle and the only thing I think I did wrong was not let it rise enough. Regardless... it was still very delicious and is a new family favorite.  As suggested my other reviewers, I doubled the swirl and I did make the sugar glaze with milk and confectioners sugar and drizzled it on the tops of the loaves. Yummy!

This bread came out excellent. I cut the recipe down to half and tripled the filling. It is perfect.  I don't have a bread machine so I used my KA. Added the warm water (90-110 degrees) the milk and let the yeast proof for 5 minutes. Added the rest of the ingrediants, mixed it and let it rise. Then baked.

Don't know what went wrong here. My bread machine is fairly new, but all my rolls and breads have risen beautifully. I decided to do an apple version subbing dried apples for the
raisins, apple pie spice for the cinnamon, and using part apple juice for the water. I cant imagine any of that affecting the outcome. In fact it had a nice flavor. The dough is probably best for cinnamon buns. It was super soft coming out of the bread machine. Luckily, I shaped in on a piece of parchment as I had to continuously flour my hands and roll with the paper. It rose fine in the pan too. For some reason, I ended up with 2- 2 1/2 inch loaves, when they completed baking. I wont be able to toast it as desired, but it will work fine as a non-conventional rectangular sliced version of a breakfast bun.

This is a good starter recipe. I would rate is 5 stars after my modifications. The bread itself is not sweet. I doubled the sugar in the bread. I did not add raisins because my kids don't care for them. I substituted butter for shortening and I doubled the filling. I used butter to grease the pans and sprinkled a bit of coarse sugar in the pans. I have used all purpose flour as well as bread flour and usually have to add more all purpose when I use it. I've made this recipe multiple times with my adjustments and it always turns out great. My family loves it!

Great bread!  I have to incorporate more whole grain into my diet, so I used  2 1/2 cups bread flour and 1 1/2 cups wheat. I also soaked the raisins. Since some noted an issue with the rise, and I used WW flour, I used 1 full pkt of yeast (2 1/4 tsp).  I used considerably more cinnamon than called for, but will use more next time, as I prefer a stronger spice flavor. Light, soft, moist,  and chewy bread, even with 1/1/2 cups wheat flour. Awesome toast, great texture!!

I was looking for a good cinnamon bread to distribute to my family for Christmas. I've made cinnamon rolls before, but I'm pretty inexperienced when it comes to bread, but after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try. Instead of using 2 big loaf pans, I filled four mini loaf pans, after cutting off both ends(which were uneven). The four pans cooked for twenty minutes and turned out amazing! I topped them with a cream cheese glaze, and they turned out fantastic.

I substituted milk for water, doubled the butter and filling.  This bread was soooo moist and delicious.  My kids loved it, and the first loaf was gone within minutes.  Definitely bake closer to 40 minutes to ensure doneness in the middle.

A little bummed. I doubled the filling and I can barely tell it has a swirl. I will triple or quadruple it next time. The texture is very nice and I had no problems with the filling splitting the bread or leaking out...just a little light on flavor.

This bread was really good.  It rose a little too much for my bread machine.  It hit the top.   I deflated it and put some Pam oil spay on my hands so it wouldn't stick (I read the suggestion on another site, it worked and I didn't  have to add more flour).  I did substitute 2 Tbs canola oil for shortning and white sugar instead of brown sugar(I didn't have shortning or brown sugar).  I didn't put the raisins in the dough, I rolled out the dough, put on the sugar/butter mixture and sprinkled on the raisins.  I than rolled up the bread. I was out of butter and eggs, so I brushed the top with water and sprinkled on some cinnamon and sugar.  I might us an egg wash next time.  I froze one loaf and baked the other.  Oh, mine only needed 1/2 hour to rise.  I then set the oven to the temp and left the bread in for 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  This bread was great!!!  I would definately make it again.

It was pretty good, I increased the filling ingredients by half and thought it was enough. The bread itself did lack something though, I might try some of the other cinnamon raisin bread recipes on this site and see what might be missing. I did like the fact that it had no eggs though! Thanks!

Really an excellent recipe.  I made the recipe this very day and the smell is still wafting through the house.  I like that it makes 2 loaves.  Well worth making. It beats all the commerical Cinnamon Raisin bread to pieces.

Made this bread but rolled it flat and lightly sprinkled cinnamon and sugar and chopped 1/2 cup or more nuts and sprinkled on bread.  Rolled up jelly roll style into a loaf.  Let rise in bread pan and baked.  My husband took a piece in his lunch and called to say he wished he had brought more.

Yummy!!  Very easy!  Next time I will add cinnamon to the dough.  I made 2 loaves and both were really small even after rising double...maybe next time i will only use one 9x5 pan to get that big puffed top on the bread.

After the bread machine's kneading cycle, the dough came out very sticky so I added 1/4 cup more of bread flour and kneaded a little bit more. I added more as needed while flattening it into a rectangle using a rolling pin. As suggested by other reviews, I soaked the raisins before mixing them in. A tip I learned from reading many bread machine recipes: Each time I use yeast, I put all liquid together in a big cup and microwave until warm. I stir in the yeast in this warm mixture until dissolved. I pour this last in the bread machine. In the winter, I let the dough rise in front of the fire place. In the summer, I turn on a portable heater directly in front. Perfect rise all the time!

This is an excellent recipe with a few adjustments. As several reviewers have suggested, add approx 1/2 to 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough itself. Also, you will probably end up using slightly more flour. I used 3+ cups bread flour and 1 cup of white whole wheat flour to give it a bit more heartiness.  I used a filling mixture of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1.5 TBSP of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves and the flavor was excellent but I found I had a lot left, so the proportions are good but it gives you more than enough.  Instead of using butter to brush on before the filling, beat 1 whole egg with 1 TBSP water and brush that on, then use the remainder on the top crust before baking and you will have a nice shiny loaf. Lastly, I found the 9x5 loaves to be somewhat small, so next time I will probably increase the dough amount by 50%.

Made 1/2 recipe (1 loaf) followed directly except 2T. sugar in dough to sweeten it a bit and doubled filling as per other reviews. Also used AP flour since it was what I had on hand. Used kitchen aid and dough hook to mix dough (added a few extra tbsp flour as needed) let mixer knead dough til smooth and elastic and not sticking to sides of bowl. Oiled bowl, flipped dough to oil top. Let rise 1 hour. Rolled into 9" wide 15" rectangle spread with filling (mixed my brown sugar, cinnamon & butter) roll, place in greased loaf pan. Let rise 1 hour, bake :)

The recipe is really lovely! But I would say it needs a tiny bit of help, add cinnamon to the dough mixture and double the filling cause its not enough, other than that its perfect.

Follows the recipe exactly. Turned out really well, everyone loved it! Not too sweet and sugary, so much better than bought! Will try adding chopped walnuts or pecans to the filling next time.

This was very easy to do.  I use my breadmaker and it rolled up like a cinnamon role.  I was a great hit at my RCIA meetings and Bible Study groups.

Glad I used powdered milk instead of regular because dough is sticky even using that. I also added some cinnamon to dough as well and tripled the filling. Overall satisfactory loaves as I was looking to make grilled cheese sandwiches with it and then glazed the other loaf for the kids.

I'm no sure how so many people found it dry, I made it for my husband and he said it was super soft and yummy, makes great toast for those quick on the go mornings. Thanks for sharing, will be making again.

This is a keeper! Made a few changes myself as others had suggested. I increased the amount of flour by 1/4 cup. I used 2 1/2 cup unbleached white flour and 1 3/4 whole wheat flour. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also soaked the raisins in hot water for a short while. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the liquid ingredients. I doubled the butter/cinnamon/brown sugar mixture and I mixed them all together before spreading on the dough. I think this way makes it easier to roll the dough up. I also used a bundt pan and baked for 30 minutes to perfection. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was excellent! I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar. I also added an egg. Some here have said the "dough didn't rise well enough", mine was perfect. You need to make sure your water is not too hot or it will kill the yeast. I also soaked the raisins in hot water so they didn't suck moisture from the bread. I didn't measure the sugar/cinnamon, I just added it until it looked the way I would like it. This is a delicious bread for sure!

Oh my goodness!  This is a big hit with my family!  Both loaves were devoured for breakfast this morning.  The only thing I did differently was I doubled the amount of filling.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I am making more right now for the rest of the week and to give away.

Disappointing recipe. The dough looked perfect, until I shaped the loaves. Did not raise very well and the taste was not to my liking. The texture was course and not appealing.

It was easy and delicious! I did double the filling...I may even triple it next time. The only critique I can give on this recipe is it doesn't tell you how large the rectangle of rolled dough should be. I rolled mine out very thin into a large rectangle. I believe it was about 18X10 inches. I jelly-rolled it length-wise. Other than that...5 stars!

Several people complained that the loaves didn't rise too much, which I experienced as well the first time I made this recipe. The second time, I tweaked it to 1.5x the original recipe (ie: 6 cups of flour instead of 4). This resulted in nearly perfectly-sized loaves. I also found the butter-sugar-cinnamon filling to be very runny, so I decreased the amount of butter used to turn it more into a rub than a liquid.

This bread is very tasty and was not hard to make.   The cinnamon and sugar oozed out of the bread and burnt on the bottom of the pan.  I baked the bread in 3 large loaf pans but would use 4 pans next time.  I also made one loaf with apples instead of raisins.   Note:  The crust is very crumby...I'm hoping that it softens up over night.

Doubled the filling, left the raisins the same. Everyone loved this - followed the recipe exactly except I added two shakes of cinnamon to the bread dough as it was mixing.. the bread didn't need to be eaten with butter and was perfectly sweet without being too sweet.. company and my husband loved it - they took some home. :) Great!

So very, very good!  Subbed powdered milk for regular and subbed craisins for raisins as it was all I had.  Plumped them up in some warm water for about 20 minutes prior to putting ingredients into the pan and then used the drained water from the craisins to make the bread.  Before I added the craisins to the dough, I placed them on a paper towel to absorb the extra moisture and then tossed with a T. of flour.  It helped reduce the stickiness and improve the overall texture.  I've also tried adding 1/4 c. finely chopped apple, 1/8 c. walnuts and subbed some white flour for wheat and loved it that way too. And like many others I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough and doubled the filling.  Great recipe and great ideas from reviewers to change it up if you want.  Highly recommend!

Kind of bland, it seems like it was missing something....maybe more cinnamon or something...I even added more raisons than it called for. I think if I made it again I would load up on the cinnamon and sugar some more :)

I followed others suggestions and doubled the filling, added cinnamon to the dough and a little flour. Rather than bake it in two loaf pans, because whoops...I only have one, I fit it into a bundt pan! It was amazing. I poured about 1 1/2 TB of melted butter over the top to help with browning. It was fantastic. Now I am going to try to make a Chocolate swirl version, substituting cocoa powder for cinnamon! We shall see!

The bread was very yummy, and rose nicely, but its top became flat in the oven. Also, the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon called for in the recipe didn't create much of a swirl. Next time I would use twice as much of each.

I made 1/4 of the recipe and baked it in two mini loaf pans. It looked quite different from the picture on this site, but was no less attractive. My husband ate his entire loaf in ten minutes, and said it tasted like something you'd get at a bakery. He suggested that next time I put some kind of fruit filling at the center- I'll have to experiement.

I'm not a raisin fan, so I followed the recipe without raisins.  It was still a hit.  Next time I might add more cinnamon mixture to truly bring out the flavor in the bread.

Pretty good.  This recipe made a lot though.  It lifted the lid on my bread machine.  It was too much for 2 loaves - I made it into 3.  The crust was a bit too crunchy/dry.  I followed other reviewers and added cinnamon to the dough and soaked the rasins.  I didn't double the filling, but I wish I had.

Pretty good for my very first raisin bread.  I used 2 1/2 tablespoon of splenda and added a little extra flour in the bread machine because it looked a little sticky.  I used a lot more of the brown sugar/cinnamon, which made it ooze out, but it just made it taste better!

This is absolutely delcious!  I followed the directions exactly using the bread machine.  It's a wonderful dough to work with.  The only thing I would change is putting the butter on the top after it's baked rather than before as it tends to collapse the loaf a bit.  Mine made beautiful swirls rather than just one as in the picture and looked as good as any I've seen.  For an obnoxiously sinful treat you could add some buttercream frosting!  Go for it - it's wonderful.  Oh and the "ready in" time is not 20 minutes ... it takes several hours with the rising and all... mine had to rise for over 2 hours.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it in the oven, I don't have a bread machine. Was good, but not quite as sweet and sugar-y as I like, was more of a hint of sweetness, but still good.

My family loves this bread!  I forgot to add the rasins in the bread machine, so I kneaded them into the dough before I rolled it out.   It worked fine and freed me from having to listen for the beep on my bread machine to add them in.  I also had to add a little more flour when kneading the bread because the dough was sticky.  I did have to let the loaves rise for more than an hour to fill the 9x5 loaf pans.  Baked for exactly 30 minutes and they came out beautifully!  I froze one which was great when thawed.  This bread would make a great teacher appreciation gift.

This bread was really quite simple to make and yummy. I didn't get the swirls right but next time i will. I just put all the initial items into a mixer with a dough hook in no specific order instead of a bread machine . Thanks

I made this in my stand mixer also.  If you don’t buy yeast in a jar, use 1 package of dry yeast.  I made 4 mini loaves out of this recipe. (My pampered chef stone loaf pans).  They turned out super!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a delicious bread and was a big hit with my family. However, being new to breadmaking, I learned an important step not mentioned.  First of all, its irrelevant,, but I made this without a bread machine.  After baking, I found large gaps where the filling was, causing the bread to fall apart when trying to eat it. After researching, I read it is wise to brush an egg mixture on the dough before sprinkling with the butter, brown sugar, filling.  This will help the dough stick together when rolled, and prevent gaps.  Since it was otherwise gobbled up by my family, I will try again with the egg mixture.

This was amazing!!!  I doubled the cinnamon/butter/sugar and it was great because it wasn't runny, more of a paste.  However, I think I rolled it out too big and wound up making more of the cinn/butter/sugar, and that was runny so it was difficult to roll up.  BUT, it still worked out and was delicious!!  Will just work on my technique!!  Would still at least double the cinna/butter/sugar!  AND the vanilla glaze is amazing!!

I tried to follow this recipe as written, only using butter instead of shortening since I was out. It turned out amazing! I just had some trouble with the swirl, more of a blob in the middle but it's still delicious!

I think this is a really great recipe but I changed a few things . First I used 5 cups of flour rather than 4 . I'm not sure why it worked out this way but it was too sticky at 4 . I did not use a mixer or bread maker , it was all made by hand . I substituted coconut oil for the shortening . I also added two table spoons of brown sugar instead of just one and two teaspoons of cinnamon instead of one to the middle layer for the swirl . One thing I added that just really makes this bread sing is the cinnamon and clove frosting I spread on afterwards . To make the frosting you just use water and confectioners sugar and mix the cinnamon and clove to taste . Thanks for posting this up :) .

My loaves collapsed and didn't have that signature swirl on the inside. I think next time I'd cut back on the amount of liquid since the dough was much wetter than a standard bread dough.

I pretty much followed the recipe as it is. The only changes were that I used my mixer rather than a bread machine and I also took the following advice given to soak the  raisins first and to add a little cinnamon to the dough. I'm not a fan of raisins in my food, but this was incredible! Everyone loved it. It is quick and very easy.

I loved this bread. I did however mix all of the ingredients together and upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and added 1/4 cup of molasses. Also I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. I don't have a bread maker so I folded the raisins in once the dough was combined then continued to kneed until it had come together but a bit sticky. Also I soaked my raisins on the counter in a bowl of boiling water to plump them up. This makes them soft and yummy baked in the bread.

My family loved this!  I too doubled the swirl filling, and added 1 tsp to the dough.  I topped it with the vanilla glaze recipe off of this site and added OJ to it. Be aware though when making the dough in the bread machine, to not rely on the dough cycle, it needs to come out before the last rising begins,and use in you pans instead.

Great recipe, but I don't know where they got their times from.  It's clearly not 10, 10, 20.  I would say about 5-10 minutes prep, 11/2 hour in machine, 1 hr. Raise, then 30 min. Bake.

I have made this recipe about 4 times and love it, could someone tell me the recipe for the frosting, I used the one for the cinn. buns  it looks a little heavy more like cake frosting,  this is more like a glaze.  please help.  I'm also going to try soaking the raisins, this sounds like a good idea

I substituted butter for the shortening, as I did not have shortening on hand. This was very tasty! I was a little disappointed in the texture...it was nice and soft, but too dense. did not have a bread machine, so I kneaded by hand, and I think I should have kneaded for much longer. I actually added orange extract instead of any of the cinnamon mixture, and folded in pistachio nuts and plump raisins. Thank you for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I had the same problem others before me have noted (with the bread separating where rolled.  Have tried several other cinnamon bread recipes without coming across this problem before, so not sure what caused it.  Personally, we prefer the sweeter dough base, but thank you for recipe.

This raisin bread is wonderful! One night I was bored and attempted cinnamon rolls with the dough; Oh MY! They were awesome! I made a butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar mixture that I spread over the rolled out dough with cream cheese icing to spread on top when they came out of the oven. Thanks for the awesome recipe! :)

I made this bread twice in one day. The first time I made it following the instructions halved, adding a tsp. of cinnamon to the dough and doubled the filling. The only problem I had was that as the dough rose, the filling gooed out.  It was sitll very good.  (I am a little ashamed to say that I ate all but one piece... oops!) The second time I made it, I made it according to Amy B.'s recipe with orange extract and apricots and it was heavenly!  My husband LOVED it and he's a pretty picky eater! (whenI say picky I mean that I make what I would for my 5-year-old niece: PB&J and fruit rollups).  I will definately be putting this and the motified apricot recipe in my book!

I made the dough by hand, let it do its final rise in my bread machine, then baked it on the bake only function. I followed others' advice in adding a little cinnamon to the dough, doubling the cinnamon/sugar mixture, and boiling the raisins to soften them. My only complaint is that the "roll" didn't stay intact when slicing the bread, the sliced pieces fell apart. In retrospect, I think that the sugar in the filling made the yeast react where the dough was rolled, making for large gaps instead of a solid loaf. I will try this again with the recommended amount of filling. Otherwise - absolutely delicious.

This bread was very good, but I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to the dough and doubled the filling. I actually made one loaf of bread and made the other into cinnamon rolls. Mmm good.

Love how not sweet it is, a true yeast bread. I added chopped walnuts and plumped the raisins as others suggested. It doesn't last long enough to dry out.

This recipe turned out great but I did make a few changes.  I substituted honey for sugar, olive oil for shortening, half the flour I used wheat flour and I also used dry milk instead of liquid milk.  The consistency was great!  I also doubled the filling mix and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  In my bread machine I think I will let the bread go through the entire dough cycle.

I was very anxious to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews, but I am a little disappointed, it was VERY dry, I worked in another 1/4 C milk while I was kneading it just to get it to be of a bread like texture, but it still could have used more. I triple checked the recipe to make sure I had done everything right... I wonder if it is maybe because I am in Alaska?   Because the dough was so dry and stiff I know it wont turn out really well but what I am looking for this time is flavor, if I like the flavor then I will continue to make it just adjusting the ingredients.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the loaf, smells heavenly. Right now it is rising, so I will update later to post my results.  Also if you are hand working this bread I would recommend adding the raisins in with all the wet ingredients, it is too hard to work them in while kneading!

This was amazing cinnamon bread. It tastes just like the kind at the local bakery. I used whole wheat flour- but I needed a lot more of it than the recipe called for, by about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. I also added a little extra sugar to the dough to counteract the bitterness that sometimes comes with whole wheat flour. Next time I'll add some cinnamon to the actual dough.

Bread was good.  The brown sugar mix for the swirl didn't even cover the rolled out bread.  I made a little over a double recipe of the swirl.  We were looking for a cinnamon swirl recipe to use for making french toast, it worked great for the french toast.  With the cinnamon swirl we hardly needed any syrup on the french toast.

what is everyone crowing about? I made this the other day and found it to be very very very dry - i used craisins and raisins and doubled the filling but was not at all pleased. I will stick with a recipe I have had for years that I make by hand without the bread machine.

Very good! I added cinnamon to the dough and doubled the filling as suggested by previous reviewers. Smelled wonderful while it was baking! It looks great when it's all sliced up, all swirly. Would be great with a glaze on top!

I halved this recipe, but used all of the 3T of sugar the recipe called for to make the bread sweeter.  I probably should have made 3/4 of the recipe b/c my loaf turned out a little small.  I left out the raisins, but would add cinnamon to the dough as others have suggested.  Taste is good, though.

Great recipe! I have no idea how to make bread in a bread machine or from scratch, so I use the Rhodes White Bread loaf. I also omit the raisins... still tastes great!!

Tried it this afternoon, very impressed with results. I don't use a breadmaker, and it fluffed up grandly. Tasted superb too. Not many changes - just extra filling, & flaked almonds.

this bread had good flavor but didnt slice well for me. I think it had alot to do with how I rolled it. I would make it again but try changing a few things
