I took these to a pot luck, the kids were eating them up like crazy!  I did add some pumpkin pie spice to zip them up a bit.

Yum! I made this for my daughter's Pre-School Thanksgiving Feast. They loved them. I exchanged the canola oil for some homemade applesauce. Added a bit of chunkiness for texture and made them even healthier! I also used mini-muffin tins since they were for pre-schoolers. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Used this recipe to fill 36 mini-muffin tins, omitting the nuts.  Baked at 425 for 10 minutes.  Came out perfect - flavorful, light muffins - taking them to Thanksgiving dinner today. (Note: I used peanut oil, and stone ground whole grain cornmeal rather than the more common degermed cornmeal.)

I made this cornbread to go with some pumpkin chili I made -- these were top notch! The pumpkin made it moist and cake-like, not dry and crumbly, making you want to choke, like most cornbread I've had!
I substituted 1/4c applesauce in for the oil, and also used 1/4c whole wheat flour with 3/4c all-purpose flour.
Would be great with butter, but they were best eaten plain when they came out of the oven, I didn't want to spoil the delicate pumpkin taste.
These seem like they would even hold up to a sweeter, chocolate-chip breakfast version (probably a cornbread sin of some sort, though?)!

I actually (a rarity)  made these muffins according to the recipe and they turned out very well- my husband loved them! I would have prefered them to be bit a little less sweet. next time, I will probably cut the sugar in half. If you decide to try this recipe think cornbread rather than pumpkin pie.  If you are after a spicier pumpkin pie type flavor it would probably be better to choose a different recipe.  These are a nice accompaniment to soup or stew and would also be good for a nourishing, not too sweet, breakfast.

Awesome! I added a splash on vanilla extract and about a tsp of pumpkin pie spice. These were wonderful warm with butter.

These weren't the "bomb," but they are good & I will make them again.  I didn't add the nuts.  That seemed odd for cornbread.  Only had light brown sugar.  Subtle pumpkin taste, but that's what you want if you're having cornbread, not pumpkin bread.  BTW why add pumpkin bread spices to cornbread?!  Just because there's pumpkin in it?  Maybe those who did could add cornmeal to their pumpkin bread & like it better.  Just sayin'  :D  Almost 2T pumpkin per serving.  Yeah!  Vitamin A!  Did mine at 425 for 15.  Not dry at all - considering we're dealing with cornbread, not cake - or pumpkin bread.  :)  Next day review:  My cornbread lovin' boy (13) didn't like these.  His cornbread nonlovin' sister (11) didn't either.  Huh.  Guess I'll try the pumpkin trick in the ususal recipes - Grandmother's buttermilk, golden sweet or homesteader.  Third day review:  He now likes 'em.  They moistened up & he wants these again.  He thought I'd tried another recipe.  There was that much of a change. Yeah, Vitamin A (again)! 7.12 Tried w sweet potato & white sugar.  Good, too - & easier to mix w white.  'Made 12 muffs, done in 20 min.

I tried to make this in a bundt pan and it simply did not work. The middle of the cake was completely raw. I will try it again as muffins because I think it does sound great.

This recipe is really yummy.  Cornbread with a hint of pumpkin and very moist.  It doesn't turn out as well if you don't make them in muffin tins.  The center doesn't get done.  I didn't use nuts and it turned out fine.

I'm always looking for ways to use pumpkin so I gave this one a try.  My only modification to this recipe was to add a streusel topping of 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. chopped pecans, and 1 Tbsp. butter.  I topped each muffin with a bit of this mixture and baked (reduced temp. to 400 based on other comments).  I thought they were just okay but my family gobbled them all up.  Just not my favorite.

Pretty good.  Easy to make with items on hand.  I went ahead and just put in the whole can of pumpkin and decreased the oil a little.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of pampered chef 'cinnamon plus' for spice and only added about 1/2 c of nuts.  Maybe could have used a little white sugar. Still, yummy spread with butter or cream cheese.

Delicious!  I thought these would be mediocre, but I wanted to try it out.  WOW, the texture, moistness, and density is so perfect!  So tasty too, but I added some spices for the more pumpkin-like fall taste.  YUM!

There was no way I wouldn't like these as I love pumpkin and I love cornbread.  Still, I think they could use a little extra flavour.  I thought of adding cinnamon but wasn't sure it would go with cornbread.  Perhaps vanilla?  Or no, I have it - a splash of orange juice!!  Next time!

These muffins are really delicious.  I replaced the oil with more pumpkin and added cinnamon and ginger.  They turned out fantastic!  So much flavour, very moist, and the perfect mix of my two favourite muffins!  Much better than I even thought they would be :D

Delicious!  What a great way to sneak some pumpkin in.  I've made this recipe exactly as is and with a few changes.  The main change I recommend is to add the entire can of pumpkin versus just 1 cup.  Dark brown sugar is a must as well, so no substitutes with light brown sugar.  Using applesauce in place of the oil works well.

I used some spare strawberry-flavored applesauce in place of the oil and these muffins turned out DELICIOUS! I also added about a tstp. of pumpkin pie spice. Very moist and flavorful, much more so than normal cornbread. My husband and I loved them!

These are delicious! I made them with gluten-free flour, and added a little ground clove and cinnamon. My kids kept asking for more! I also used these to make Thanksgiving stuffing, and it came out great. Highly recommended!

We made these for a party to serve with chili and everyone loved them! We omitted the pecans but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out great as muffins and in a 9 x 9 pan. I will definitely make these again and try adding pumpkin spice as others have suggested.

Love these. I actully used Jiffy corn mix, 1 can pumpkin and 1 egg, and baked muffins for 12-15 min.....came out perfect!  They taste like corn bread but are nice and moist.  Next time I'm making with mashed sweet potates to go with a Carribean theme! My kids loved them

These were ok but they lacked luster. They need a lil more spice. If I were to make them again I'd add a lil allspice.

These are wonderful!  They are not too sweet, so they can be served with chili/soup.  The pumpkin makes them moist (and healthy). You've got to try these!

Made 36 mini muffins. Added pumpkin pie spices. Added scoop of vanilla protein powder and 1/4c ground flax seed meal. Subbed 1/3c applesauce for oil but also added about 1-2T oil and 1/4c 2% milk. Left out nuts.

I made this and put the batter in a 9" diameter round pan.  Omitted the nuts.  Since I only had light brown sugar, I added a tablespoon of molasses for flavor.  Served with homemade chicken-veg soup.  Very nice!  A piece with butter and honey was good for breakfast.

I made these to go with chili and they were fabulous. I did, of course, switch things up a bit due to ingredients on hand. I used 1/2 cup flour, 1 and 1/4 cup cornmeal, 1 can of pumpkin, no oil, 3 tablespoons maple syrup and omitted the brown sugar. I made one batch without nuts and one with and both were delicious. A definite keeper!

These were nice enough. My pickiest son even liked them enough to say so later in the evening.(my pumpkin hating husband didn't eat the meal when I served these *grin*) The pumpkin was more subtle than I personally would have liked, but perhaps I simply didn't pair these with the right meal? One reviewer used applesauce instead of oil, which actually sounds quite good. However, if one wanted more of a pumpkin flavor, one could substitute more pumpkin for the oil instead of applesauce, no? (at least sometimes, depending on the meal)? I personally enjoyed the texture and sweetness (except that my son made these up and he slightly over baked them, so they were a tiny bit dry - I don't think they were dry simply because we used 3/4 C whole wheat and 1 C corn meal...not likely anyway, at least, not based on my past experiences). These muffins were not extremely sweet, but not savory at all. I'd say, for comparison's sake, that these are not quite as sweet as, say, Jiffy corn muffins.  If I were pairing these muffins with an autumn salad, then I might actually sweeten them a tad more and add some cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves, and perhaps some chopped dates at times.  On the other hand, if I were serving these with a pumpkin-turkey chili with traditional chili spices (no sweet spices) I might make them as is.  I'll have to toy around with these some and see when/how they work best for our family (well, the kids and myself anyway....).  Thanks for some 'food' for thought!

Took these corn muffins to a women's potluck and got several compliments.  They are about as sweet as a Jiffy corn muffin.  I baked the muffins for 14 minutes and thought they were a bit dry so you might check them after 12 minutes.

Nice recipe!  I made as written, just didn't add the nuts. They turned out perfect - moist and just the right mixture of flavor IMO.  I made a couple of different flavored butters - sage and cinnamon - to top them with.  That way, you can go with savory or sweet, whichever you prefer, without having to change the muffin recipe ;^).  

Next batch I think I'll try using some orange juice as another reviewer suggested - think that sounds tasty!

Thanks - this is a keeper!!

I baked according to the recipe and served with vegetarian chili.  It was delicious.  I don't think I will change the recipe for savory dishes, however, I think adding some spices would make it a perfect breakfast muffin.

These came out awful for me...they were lumpy and had no flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly so I don't know where I went wrong.  Judging by the other reviews it should've been better.

I am not usually inspired to write reviews, but this recipe is a keeper! I think these basically taste like corn muffins, but the pumpkin makes them so moist and delicious! They don't crumble like regular corn muffins usually do, and they just have a bit more character. They went well with baked beans on a winter's night.

I had to use whole wheat flour and walnuts as that was what I had on hand and I thought they turned out great. A healthy quick breakfast with honey or jam, but equally good with soup as Christi Larsen says. I would not add any spices as it would seem more like a dessert and would not go with everything so well.

i made these muffins with a mexican-themed chicken cassarole, because i had some leftover pumpkin in the freezer from the holidays.  my kids and boyfriend loved them.  i didn't deviate at all from the recipe, and they are not a dessert muffin at all, more of a cornbread taste, but very good.  thanks!

I spiced these up with 1 t ginger, 1 t cinnamon, 1 t pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 t nutmeg. With these additions, the muffins had some flavor. Without them, I'm guessing these muffins wouldn't taste like very much at all. I don't think they are very pumpkin-y. They have a good texture though; they are not too dense but are moist. So, if you are going to make these, make sure to jazz them up a bit.

This was really good!  It is meant to be a corn muffin that is moister due to the addition of the pumpkin.....not a pumpkin muffin!  Please try this if you like cornbread or corn muffins.  I did add a little extra cornmeal.  I made 4 mini loaves, baked at 400 for 22 min.  It's so moist!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist, but not super flavorful. Would use more cornmeal less flour if I made them again. Heated my cast iron skillet in the oven, then spread the batter out in heated pan and baked about 20 minutes. Love cooking cornbread this way.

Great recipe and my 3 year old kids loved it. I really like the recipe's flexibility. 
2nd time, I swapped the nuts for unsweetened coconut flakes and added the whole can of pumpkin.
3rd time, I swapped the dark brown sugar for orange maramlade and I swapped coconut oil for canola.

I think this is a great recipe.  If you want pumpkin bread or pumpkin muffins, go look for a diffeent kind of recipe and don't dock points on this recipe!  I made as directed, except I lowered the temp to 400 and baked it all in a pre-heated cast iron skillet for 30 minutes until it was nicely browned on top.  The flavor and texture worked out great.  I served this with white chicken chili, and seconds were eaten with butter and real maple syrup.  Wonderful.

These are delicious and easy to make and quick to cook in a hot oven.  I varied the recipe a tad to accommodate dietary issues: for the one cup white flour I substituted:: one third cup each whole wheat and white flour;  1/3 cup mix white flour and flaxseed meal; for the one half cup brown sugar:; 1/4 cup each stevia and brown sugar; walnuts.  Delicious.

Was looking for a 'from scratch' cornbread recipe and found this little gem! Only tweeked the recipe slightly by substituting melted butter for the canola oil and reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup soft brown sugar (which was more them sweet enough).  They turned out perfect and were a wonderful accompaniment with chilli. The husband and both loved them. I will definitely make these again

I doubled this recipe and used chia seeds to substitute for 2 eggs because I didn't have enough. The consistency of the batter before baking was really thick. I'm not sure if that's how it would be if I had not substituted the eggs and doubled it.  My children liked. I left off 1/4 C sugar based on other reviewers saying it was too sweet. Next time, I will use the entire amount as it wasn't sweet enough. I used Trader Joe's Pumpkin butter to make up for it and served with a Vegetarian Chili recipe from this site.

These were amazingly good!  I normally don't review any recipes that I change, but this is such a good recipe, I wanted to tell others! I didn't have any pumpkin, so I replaced it with crushed pineapple.  My husband is a diabetic, so I replaced the sugar with splenda.  Now I thought these muffins would loose the texture and be a little dry but they weren't!  The muffins turned out so moist and fluffy!  Next time I'm at the store, I'm buying pumpkin!

This recipe made a very moist cornbread. The color was beautiful and the pumpkin flavor came through. I was making this to go with a vegetarian chili so I cut down on the sugar to 1/3 cup and omitted the nuts and spices. I used white cornmeal because that's what I had on hand. Baked at 410 degrees(because I was using my small oven): 9"x 9" pan for 20 minutes and muffin tins for 15 minutes. This is a good basic recipe to dress up or down as needed.

These sounded good but turned out sort of heavy and dense. I guess not what I really had in mind.  Taste OK though, so will still go fine with our chili tonight.

These are really good.  To make it a little heathier, I used half wheat flour and I also used applesauce instead of canola oil.  I made these to go with chili and it was the perfect pairing.  I will make these again and again!

I looove this recipe. I make a non fat version of it by adding just egg whites instead of the whole egg and I exchange the oil with fat free sour cream. I also do not add the nuts, even though I love nuts, but for it to be fat free they aren't added. I have also exchanged the pumpkin with sweet potatoes or banana, and they turn out super moist and keep at-least a week in the fridge.

I tried this out for our thanksgiving dinner and after my boyfriend confessed he didn't like cornbread he raved about these muffins!  They were rich and earthy, very moist and just a bit sweet.  Perfect!

I had one cup of left over pumpkin in the fridge when I read this recipe. Perfect. Made the recipe as written and was happy.

Nice alternative to conventional corn bread. I skipped the nuts, added 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and sprinkled the top with a tiny bit of coarse salt and coarse raw sugar. That made them savory sweet: good with chili and then the next morning for breakfast.

This was good. I used fresh pumpkin, substituted applesauce for oil, 1 tsp. cinnamon and left out pecans. Baked at 425 for 12 minutes and they were nice and moist. I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is a keeper.  The men in my family really enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe except that I used walnuts which I had on hand.  Can't wait till I try them made with pecans.

Yuumy! Moist and dense. We used applesauce, no oil, and only a 1/4 quarter cup brown sugar to serve with our chili. Next time I'll keep the full sugar and add the pumpkin pie spice with some crumble topping for a sweeter option.

These were simple and yummy. I added a bit if cinnamon and nutmeg plus a pinch of allspice, and they turned out great, if not wow. However, I think this is a good standard recipe that can easily be tweaked per your individual taste to make it wow for you. (Like I want to try cutting back on the sugar and maybe adding some cheddar for a more savory muffin next time). The mixture of cornmeal and pumpkin was perfect. I would definitely make these again.

I made these sugar free using splenda and sugar free maple syrup for the brown sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour.  They are terrific!

I love these!  This has become my go-to recipe for corn muffins & I make them often.  I make the recipe exactly as written, although I sometimes used another cooked, mashed winter squash (butternut, acorn, kabocha, etc.) instead of pumpkin.  I love the addition of the pumpkin - extra nutrition plus it keeps the leftovers moist, unlike other corn bread recipes.  Love the added flavor & texture of the pecans, too.  I often have these with stew or a soup for dinner, then have the leftovers with jam for breakfast the next morning or send them in my kids' lunches.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Even adding cinnamon, ginger, pumpkin spice, & vanilla... these barely had any flavor.  will not make again.
