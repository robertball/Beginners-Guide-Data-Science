Delicious recipe and very sweet.  Next time I might try adding less white sugar and more fruit.
I did add 1/2 cup of dates to the recipe so it's possible the extra sweetness came from that.
Excellent and tasty!!

I'm a big fan of the scandinavian variety of fruits soups. However, I was very disapointed in this recipe for one reason. TOO SWEET. You would do well to ignore the addition of any sugar as that is sweet enough. Seriously, my teeth hurt from the sweetness.

very good recipe !!!! with the fruits I like, and in the   rigth proportion, refreshing in summer time and conforting when served hot. I just use half of the sugar. Delicious.

This is a wonderful Norwegian soup you can eat year round but it's a Christmas tradition, as well.  You can use almost any dried fruits you like, up to about 2 1/2 cups, and you can adjust the sweetness to taste, too.  I used 1 cup whole bite sized prunes, 1/2cup dark raisins, 1/2cup golden raisins and 1/2 cup dried cranberries and/or 1/2 cup dried dark sweet cherries.  I started with 1/2cup of sugar and added about 1/4 cup more. (the cranberries needed it!) I added some additional orange juice at the end along with the lemon juice (I didn't use the lemon slices because the white pith is too bitter and comes through in the sauce)  This is a very slightly jelled liquid that is wonderful chilled or warmed.  Tasty along with creamy rice or tapioca pudding on some pound cake or Julekage bread and butter.  Mmmm!
