Having just made another Raita recipe that contained mint, I decided to use only 1 tsp instead of 2 tbs. That is the only change I made and I really enjoyed it. Though I love fresh mint, I don't particularly care for it in this recipe and will omit it completely next time.

DELICIOUS!  The only change I made was adding a tiny bit of roasted garlic powder, but just a touch.  This made a LOT, I don't know how we'll use it all up.  Next time I'll cut this recipe in half, if not thirds, but other than that?  Wonderful!
