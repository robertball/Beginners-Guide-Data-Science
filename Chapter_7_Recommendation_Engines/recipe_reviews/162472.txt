Easy and delicious! I browned the sausage first as the recipe states but didn't reserve the pan drippings as I felt the sausage itself was greasy enough. The only thing I changed about the sauce was to use minced garlic vs. garlic powder. When it was done I served it on toasted hoagie rolls and topped it off with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheese. Very good and very filling - definitely makes enough for a crowd!

I didn't have whole stewed tomatoes so I used a can of crushed; cut the recipe down to 5 servings for my package of 5 links.  I really thought this was wonderful .  I didn't cook this for as long as recipe stated, I cooked for 3 hours and by then my peppers were pretty much boiled down to mush.  This made for a delicious sauce but you'll have to add sliced peppers during the last 1-2 hours if you want any resemblence of them left.   :)

Be sure you drain the grease from the sausage but keep the dark drippings and add to the pot.

I did not cook it with the sausages nearly as long as it called for in the sauce because I made it with 10 italian links..5 mild, 5 hot.. And melted a little provolone atop before serving....YUMM!!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This was amazing and so easy.  I cut it down to 6 servings cause I had 6 sausages.   Okay so I didnt have any of the tomatos needed except for the sause :)  So I used the following: 1 can of stewed tomatos- throw in blender 1 can of rotel ( diced tomatos and chilies ) drained the above frozen onions and green peppers 1/2 cut sauted  combined the above and all other spices after the serving calculation adjusted to 6 servings. I also used Hot Turkey sausage. My 14 year old loved it and his friend to.  My hubby was surpised I was able to throw it all together so quick.

I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and it was a quick, easy and tasty meal. Also cooked up some angel hair pasta as a side dish to use the rest of the sauce.

Super Yummy!!  I made a few changes using Jalapeno sausage and added Poblano chiles along with the bell peppers.  I also only put in half of the peppers in the beginning and put the rest in about an hour before serving.  This was a huge hit!  I even liked it...and I HATE bell peppers!  :)

Felt like a mobster, like that scene in "Goodfellas" where they're making sausage & peppers in prison...LOL

Highly recommend!

This is a wonderful receipe. I made this on today; but I added oregeon, basil, fresh garlic and crushed peppers to give it a spicy taste. I made crusty french bread and stuffed the sausauge and sauce in the bread topped with parmesan cheese. OMG! it was so good.

Made this exactly as stated, except I did not add grease and I sliced my sausages in half (lengthwise) before cooking them in the sauce.  Used hot italian and they were fabulous!  This does make a ton though- will probably half it next time.  Highly recommended for football parties!  Serve with sliced provolone on top.

I made this for a huge crowd just like the recipe called for.  I made this the day before my party and simmered it for 5 hours. The day of the party I cooked it for another hour.  I would have liked the sauce thicker though.  Everyone loved it.

The flavor was very good, and very easy to put together. I scaled it down to 1 lb of sausage and put it over spaghetti instead of making it into sandwiches. I followed other reviews and added the peppers in the last hour, and they still got plenty soft. Letting them simmer 6 hours, and they would have dissolved.

I was looking for an alternative to rigatoni or chili, which it seems are my go-to when cooking for a large group and this turned out to be the ticket. The only thing I changed was while I was browning the sausage, I threw the rest of the ingredients in a large roaster oven and let it come to a boil, then I added the browned sausage and covered it and just let it simmer for a few hours. Everyone raved about it! I will definitely make it again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great, I tried to cut it to 5 servings but I think I got the ratio wrong. 

We didn't mind the sauce because it tasted great,  I was just wondering if I made this incorrectly.. It did not look like the photo.

Delicious!  This hit the spot on a cold, rainy Sunday evening.  I used turkey Italian sausage and added fresh herbs to the pot.  The house smelled wonderful as this simmered on low all day.  Paired it with fresh fruit and 'World's Best Potato Salad' from AR, and we greatly enjoyed dinner.  I'm using the leftovers served over cooked pasta later in the week.

I made this for my husband's 40th bday party and it was completely gone before the end of the night. People raved about it!! 
I did wait to put the sausages in the sauce until the last two hours, but other than that, followed the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I make it in the slow cooker...I brown the sausage first, there isn't a ton of grease by making it in the slow cooker.  I don't add the pan juices because the sausage is already simmering all day. Makes the house smell yummy!

Great recipe.  Easy and fast to put together...great candidate for the crockpot.  If you have extra, use it another day over pasta...Just add some wine or water to thin it, and heat and top with parmesan.

Loved these. My mom even said that they are better than hers.
