This recipe doesn't work- literally. It says to form a ball with the dough...well, it was pretty difficult to form a ball when the dough was more like a batter consistency and very drippy. I had to add 2 more cups of flour. The end result was a very doughy product that tasted rather disgusting.

It is a good basic recipe for kreplach except for the dough. i found a solution for the dough is to by kosher wanton or egg roll wrappers. Fill the wrappers and then boil or fry .

I also wanted to add that it made WAY more meat filling than we could possibly use in the dough, even after we had added the extra flour to make it more dough like. Also I upped the amt. of cinnamon and walnuts from the reccommended amount and still couldn't taste them. I would cut the meat down to a pound and maybe only put one onion in if I were to try it again.

This recipe will work if you increase the amount of flour to 4 cups.  I would also suggest removing the cinnamon and walnuts.
