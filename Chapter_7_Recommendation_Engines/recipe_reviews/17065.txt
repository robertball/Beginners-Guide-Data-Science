My favorite is the Best Marinara Yet on this site.  This one is good too, just a little plain and my fiance said too tangy.

I was very disappointed in this sauce.  A few more herbs would make the difference I think.  I probably won't make it again.

This is a great sauce particularly becacuse it's not runny.  I used mine for meatloaf sandwiches so I was looking for somehting thick.  The extra freezes well and complements bread sticks or cheese sticks.

This is a great base recipe to bend and make more personal. I sauteed fresh minced onion in with the garlic and I added a good amount of basil and oregano as well as red pepper flake and a pinch of brown sugar for sweetness. The longer this cooks, the better it gets.

I used concentrated crushed tomatoes for a smoother sauce in this recipe.  I added a small amount of sauteed garlic and italian seasonings.  It still was a little bland to me.  I will continue to try the other marinara recipes on this site for "the one".

a really great sauce!  i like lots of spices so to this recipe by the letter, i added fresh basil, oregano and marjoram from my herb garden.  I also grow parsley, so that was fresh as well.  My husband said this was even better because of the undertones the red wine added.  It has replaced my usual recipe.

I served it with turkey meatballs, pasta and snack size pieces of fried polenta with fresh parm cheese sprinkled on top (ala Giada-for dipping in the sauce of course).

An easy and magnifico sauce!  highly recommended.

Quartering the tomatoes so that they melt into the sauce is an improvement, but this is an excellent sauce.

Mamma mia!  This is-a mighty pizza sauce!  It was like making sweet love to a tomato all over again.  So tasty, it brought me way back to the good olden days, a week ago (sigh).  It was a very delicious sauce; I recommend it to those that want to have an out of body experience. :D

THIS is THE BEST marinara sauce EVER!! .. I use crushed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes, and mix everything as it's heating up directly in the saucepan .. no need to use a blender at all .. (just find/choose a chunkier canned crushed tomato for the best consistency) .. LOVE IT!  :)

Most excellent.  We used cooking wine, so omitted the salt since that is already pretty salty.  Also, we stuck with a can of diced tomatoes, which worked like a charm.

This recipe was SO yummy!  My husband and I could have made a meal off of it alone.  I reserved a little to serve with an appetizer of fried ravioli, and it was scrumptious.  When I mixed the rest with ground beef for lasagna, I lost a lot of the flavor, though.  I would recommend doubling the recipe if you plan on using it as part of a meat sauce.  

By far, the BEST marinara we have attempted - we're adding this one to our family recipe box.  Thank you so much for sharing this, gknee!

Great sauce base.  I used diced tomatoes instead of whole, and threw in an extra clove of garlic because I love garlic, and it's great for your circulation! (So is a glass of smooth red wine, which goes well with this sauce)  Along with the parsley, I added fresh basil, about 1/3-1/2 cup chopped/packed.  Also added a pinch of thyme and a pinch of sage.  Marvelous flavor.  The red wine in the sauce adds extra depth.  Will make again!!

A very good simple sauce. I blended everything, including the garlic and parsley. Simmered the mixture for about 30 minutes. Left out the wine as I didn't want to open a bottle, and it was still great. Added a pinch of sugar. Served with Meatball Nirvana from this site and spaghetti.

Tangy is definitely the best way to describe this recipe. It was a bit too tart for my tastes so I added about a tbsp of brown sugar and that really seemed to help. My boyfriend liked it fine before the brown sugar so that's just a matter of taste, I suppose.   We ate it over spaghetti with Italian sausage (cooked separately) the first night. Everybody liked it. The next day, I cooked up some ground beef with a pinch of salt, drained it, and added the leftover sauce and that made a lovely lunch. No leftovers! That's always a good sign.   I may make this again, but I will probably try the other recipes on this site first.

I made the sauce as the recipe instructed, and it was a very good basic sauce. It does have a bit of zing to it, as others have said, but I made it to go with arancini and it really complemented it. This sauce is good as is, but those who think it is too tangy can simply use the recipe as a basis for something on which to expand.

Excellent! I found that the edges of the sauce started to burn after 4.5 hours in the crockpot on low (this just may be my crockpot, all are variably different). Next time I would do low for 3.5 hours. I used this over turkey meatballs and made a pizza with some the next day. The rest I am freezing for another night. Has a lot more zing and freshness than jar sauce.

I thought that the wine was too overpowering.  On a whole it was good.  I now just cut the amount of wine in half.

A really good marinara sauce.  I added another 1/4 cup of wine and a tablespoon of basil.   Very tasty, I will definitely make it again.

This sauce is tasty. It's nice and thick and chunky, and the flavor from the red wine gives it a richness that is not overbearing. I doubled the garlic (I always go heavy on garlic), but that's the only adjustment I made. In the beginning of the recipe, when it says to "blend" together the whole peeled tomatoes and tomato paste in a bowl, I wasn't sure if they meant mix with a blender or just stir it all together. I ended up using a potato masher to squish the whole tomatoes into smaller, more manageable pieces. I would make this again!

This is amazing!!!! My family and I absolutely LOVE it!!!! I have found a way to make this recipe even better though! I added 4-5 large fresh basil leaves and I also put in 4 medium/large bay leaves. This gives that recipe a little more herby flavor that it really needs! Also I would encourage anyone to experiment with how long to cover and uncover... I try different times each time I make this recipe (20 min on 20 off repeated until I like the thickness) but really love this recipe and experiment with what you like!

I have a garden full of gorgeous tomatoes, and this was the right recipe to make use of them.  I used fresh tomatoes in lieu of the canned tomatoes (spun in my food processor), and simmered the marinara on the stove for about 2 hours (which reduced it to a lovely, useable consistency).  I added a small amount of brown sugar, and exchanged the parsley for basil.  I made a huge batch in a large stockpot, and froze a lot of it in Ziplock bags (so I can revisit my garden tomatoes anytime I want).  With so many tomatoes to use, I'll probably do this several more times this year.  It's money in the bank ;)

Basic marinara recipe. I always tweak a recipe so I added tons of fresh herbs from my greenhouse. I also started with onion, then added garlic and my homemade roasted canned red pepper. Added bay leaf too. No marinara is good without bay leaf.
