An alternative is make tuna salad with chopped onions, celery and mayo.  Spread on english muffs and top with a slice of cheddar cheese.  Broil until cheese is melted.  Yummy.

I rated this recipe 5 stars, however with a substitution: I don't put salt in it (I find with everything, it's salty enough so no salt and no garlic salt either) and instead I put a little bit of curry powder (depending on how much you like it)...but even just a little hint is delicious! & you have to put chopped black olives in the mayo mixture - sooo good! Then I just bake them in the oven normally...they also work well if you freeze them 1st. Always a hit & ppl always ask for the recipe!

Great basic recipe.  I always use garlic powder, not garlic salt. (It is mostly salt.) Black olives and crab meat is the best addition.  Will make them often.

These are AWESOME and SUPER easy!  I made the following english muffin recipe from this site last night: English Muffins. Since my boyfriend will be out of town for a week, I wanted to use up some of the english muffins.  These were perfect. Unfortunately, I didn't have green onions (and the bf doesn't like them) so I made these without.  They were still incredible.  They taste like the best cheese bread you've ever had at a pizza place.  I will make these again!  I love the idea of adding shrimp to these and plan to make them as my solo "dinner" this week. Thanks!

I followed Barbara's advice and added black olives.  I used low-fat cheese and mayo and these little guys were still very rich and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe, Dave!

I started making this with my Nana when I was a little girl around the Holidays in the early 1970's. (Don't do the math, I am an old lady now : ) ..... These are wonderful and easy, however we would mix it up and use Parmesan reggiano in place of Cheddar and this added a bit more punch. Use fresh not the canned, fresh had more zing!  Yummy Yummy in my tummy.

These were good but next time I will 'kick' it up a little leaving out the regular salt, using more than a pinch of garlic salt and sprinkle the tops with Asiago cheese.

These are really good! My mom used to make something very similar. Instead of the cheddar cheese, she added 8 ounces of softened cream cheese. She also added a raw egg and a 4.5 oz jar of mushrooms to the mix. She made them all the time for dinner parties, reminds me of my childhood.

Wife and I made these as part of our homemade Saturday brunch. We added chopped red peppers. We also subbed plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, used 2% lowfat shredded cheddar, and 100% whole wheat muffins for a healthier spin. Tasted really good. Will continue to add/remove ingredients per other suggestions here and have fun with it!

These were good, but not great.  I added crab meat which went over well, but I think I would prefer to use pit bread rather than english muffins.

I needed a hors d'oeuvre dish for a potluck event and I found this recipe. It turned out to be a huge success. The other guests ate it all. I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll use a little less mayo than called for.

We make them instead of plain grilled cheese. You can add extra toppings, olives or bacon both work well!

These are really good!  I added a can of chopped black olives as other reviewers had suggested.  I baked some and later broiled some, both ways turn out great. Since I was making them for myself and my husband I did not cut them, but left them as whole circles as seen in photo. Great recipe!

I made for a get together at my place, I did substitute  about 3/4 cup of the mayo for cream cheese and used a bit more than a pinch of black pepper.  They were gone in no time with nothing but praise!
