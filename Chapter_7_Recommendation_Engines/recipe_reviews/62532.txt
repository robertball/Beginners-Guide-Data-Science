Fruit was very good. Wasn't too fond of the parsley and arugula.

Not bad, kinda blah...I couldn't find arugala, so I substituted Romaine.  I also substituted balsamic vinegar for the olive oil. The fruit and Gorgonzola are awesome together!  I would suggest cutting the greens by 1/4 and increasing the fruit, basil and cheese a bit and definitely using balsamic vinegar!

We made this lastnight... fruit was perfection. Added a little cilantro with parsley and basil. arugula awesome used goat cheese instead of Gorgonzola and drizzled balsamic with the olive oil and topped with avocado. I was nervous as I served it for dinner without trying it first. HUGE hit!! Loved it!!  Always like to adlib recipes to my  liking ... Perfect spring/summer salad. Will definitely do it again and may add caramelized walnuts next time. Thank you
