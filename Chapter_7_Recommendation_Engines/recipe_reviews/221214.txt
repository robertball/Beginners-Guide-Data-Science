Absolutely delicious!  One of the best carrot cakes I've had and there was no way you could tell it was gluten free!  I went exactly by the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  I used a recipe from one of my cook books to make the cream cheese frosting.

This makes a great dense cake, no wheat flour or sugar.  I didn't have grapeseed oil so use canola which seemed to work fine.  The cake stuck to the pan so I would use parchment paper or something on the bottom of the pan the next time.  I frosted it with simple neufchatel cheese sweetened with agave syrup and a teaspoon or two of vanilla extract.

I made major modifications after reading the comments - here is what I did 

Used Quinoa flour - I find that this is the best for baking 
Added 3/4 cup of buttermilk
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder

The cake was light and fluffy but tasted super bland - next time 1 cup of Agave and 2 teaspoons of nutmeg and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon but ladies Quinoa is the way to go when baking and if you want light add buttermilk with baking soda, baking powder and salt in equal parts

This is an amazing recipe.   I substituted walnut oil & olive oil for the grapeseed oil and cut down on the cinnamon.    It was wonderful.  I used a cream cheese frosting that included butter, cream cheese & homemade powdered sugar (because it is corn free.     Next time I would experiment by adding a little crushed pineapple but as this recipe stands it is fantastic.    As for the complaint that this cake is too salty or dense you could decrease the salt to 1 tsp. or eliminate all together and increase the baking soda to 2 tsp.   The cake is dense because of the lack of flour.  You could also very easily turn this recipe into a bar pan recipe.   I also dusted the top with crushed walnuts.   Enjoy!!!

I was looking for a cake for my daughter's 1st birthday party that was made with almond flour and no sugar, and this one came up.  After thinking about the frosting, and not wanting to use dairy, I decided to try some major modifications.  I made an apple cake instead using the amounts listed, but only using the almond flour, celtic sea salt, baking soda, eggs, and grapeseed oil.  I substituted plain apple sauce for the agave nectar.  Apple sauce was also the "icing".  I used Fugi apples.  It turned out great!  It was moist and had a good flavor.  I got multiple requests for the recipe.  I will definately try the carrot cake down the road.

Gets extra bonus for being without flour. Too salty for me-I will use much less salt next time I make it.

This carrot cake is very moist. I followed the recipe, added 1/2 tsp ginger and omitted the walnuts. I also decorated the cake with sliced almonds. Our guests were asking for seconds! Thank you for sharing such a great gluten-free recipe!

My boyfriend can't have gluten and this have become his favorite cake. I use slightly less salt and it isn't too sweet - which he prefers. I use veg oil.

One modification I made was an egg substitute of applesauce and baking powder. Also made a delicious dairy free frosting to go with it.

Love the flavor! I get compliments EVERY time I make it. I only wish it had a little more rise; I add a little more leavening to help. Also, I've used canola, and have used butter w/great results.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site. Didnâ€™t have agave so I used organic unbleached cane sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly and used a simple cream cheese recipe for the frosting. The cake (which I brought to Thanksgiving dinner) was divine -- very moist and incredibly delicious, without being overly sweet. It was a HUGE hit with the family! I am so excited to make it again for future holidays.

I made it in a 9x13 pan, used parchment paper following someone's suggestion. It was perfect. I will make it again!
