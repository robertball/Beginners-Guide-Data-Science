The flavour for this icing is nice. I added real amber rum instead of rum extract.  I used it on cupcakes, so I also added quite a bit more icing sugar to thicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

This frosting is so good with the rum sugar cookies. I found I had to add a lot more water to get it thin enough to frost the cookies.

This did not turn out for me at all. I cut the recipe to 12, maybe that was it? the consistency was course and way too sweet. I used very fine sugar (berry sugar). Maybe should have used icing sugar instead..I also found it runny.

I added 1 1/2 tsp cocoa powder and used golden rum instead of extract and frosted rum rains in brownies. Huge success!

Really was runny. I could have added more powered sugar to make a better consistency but the flavor wasn't worth the additional sugar that I'll probably toss out any way.  Not a favorite.  Sorry.
