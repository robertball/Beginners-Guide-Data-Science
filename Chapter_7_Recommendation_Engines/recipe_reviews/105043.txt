Take it from a vietnamese cook, you NEVER add fish sauce to a spring roll.  You use a mixture of peanut butter, hoisin sauce, water, sauteed minced garlic for a dipping sauce.

VERY IMPORTANT: there are 2 kinds of spring roll wrappers! DO NOT get the kind made of wheat flour from the freezer section that look like egg roll wrappers! Rice wrappers are thin, clear, and feel just like a dry noodle. In fact, the asian store I went to stocked the wrappers in the noodle aisle.   You just have to moisten the wrapper in hot water for a second or two, NOT 20. It will feel hard but by the time you layer the ingredients it will have softened.   Great recipe!

Excellent directions for handling the rice wrappers.  I filled them with shredded Chinese cabbage and finely sliced shrimp, jalapenos, scallion, carrots, peppers, and alfalfa sprouts, cilantro and mint. Made a tasty dipping sauce with juice of one lime mixed with Hoisin sauce. They were a big hit with my dinner guests.  This is an interesting substitute for a salad course.

Firstly, great simple directions on rolling rice wrappers. I got better the more carefully I followed them. The recipe is perfect, but I did add grated carrots and julienned English cucumbers. I like "Best Peanut Sauce" on this site, for dipping.

Excellent. Very easy to make and even kept fresh for a day or so in the fridge. I did watch a video on u-tube on how to assemble them. (the visual helped me).

I was glad to learn how to make spring rolls!  Always wanted to know how to do it!  I would change a couple of the ingredients though.  I would skip the rice noodles and fish sauce!  Instead next time I think I will add some sliced cucumbers and shredded carrots!  I just gave each roll a little dash of the fish sauce, and they turned out rather salty!  That's why I would skip the fish sauce!  But thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are good. Fresh and healthy. I have been making spring rolls for a few years and I always put in carrot and a fresh basil leaf. Great to dip in peanut or hoisin sauce.

Spring rolls are supposed to be deep fried.

These are salad rolls.

But other than that, these are delicious.

I didn't add the mint because I prefer my rolls without it.  It was great!

Made these last month and they were beautiful and delish! I added cucumber and spicy bean sprouts to the original recipe. Definate learning curve on using the rice wrappers, dip wraps for a second and roll quickly on a towel! The texture of the finished rolls was a little sticky so I served with and on lettuce leaves for easier handling.

My review is certainly no reflection on the recipe itself, it's just that my family didn't really care for these. It was a texture thing with the rice wrappers they didn't like. I'm certain they're just used to a crispy shell as in fried spring or egg rolls so being that I read you can sub rice wrappers for egg roll wrappers I'm going to give them a shot and try frying them. Don't get me wrong, they all ate two of these but they didn't ask for a repeat performance. Oh well, their loss! Thank you Cristina!

these were good, I didn't make the hoisen sauce, maybe that was what this was missing. Avocado would be yummy in this as well. I thought it was a little plain but I don't think that was the fault of the recipe.

At last!!! I have been looking everywhere for this recipe! Just like the ones I get at Vietnamese restaurants, and I really love them.
I like to dip them in red chile sauce, fish sauce, with a touch of hoisin all combined. Great stuff!

These are delicious. I found similar spirng rolls in a vietnamese restaurant which were served with peanut sauce. I tried it at home and it was a big hit with the in-laws!

Very easy to make and tastes great. One thing i did differently was that i used a peanut sauce. To make it you just mix some peanut butter and rice vinegar!

my hubby didn't care for these.  He said they were too bland, he couldn't taste the shrimp and he didn't like the leaves.

I never write a review but this was SUPER easy and very good!  I kind of considered this as a burrito and with a burrito you could add whatever you want.  I added  cucumber (cut lengthwise) and shaved carrots with the other ingredients and for the sauce I used peanut sauce.  I had all the ingredients out and my daughters just put whatever they wanted in their own rolls.  A big hit and nice family time!  thanks
