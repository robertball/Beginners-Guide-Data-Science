If you substitute almost everything it is tasty as can be...I cooked the chorizo with diecd peppers and red onions...added a drained can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno, and a drained can of black beans and I threw a hand full of low fat grated cheese at the end....now that was good...

I prefer to use canned pinto beans OR homemade slowcooker beans over the baked beans and I omit the bell peppers, adding ortega peppers instead.

excellent change of pace for chorizo. The slightly sweet flavor of the beans compliments the spicy chorizo taste.

The only way to go is to use Basque (instead of Mexican) Chorizos. They are very hard to find but Gem Meat Packing Company in Boise Idaho makes the best and most authentic chorizos that they will ship all over the country. Every Basque like me knows exactly where to get them.

This was easy to make and very colorful. I made the chorizo w/ onions and peppers (added some butter) and put it on a bed of rice with a small ladle of black beans on top.  It was rather bland until we put some green Tabasco on it.  It came alive with the low heat jalapeno flavor.  Everyone wanted more.  It's on the favorite dinner rotation now. Thanks!!!

I thought this was kinda meh, and Husband didn't like it much at all (and he'll eat anything). Needed a lot of tweaking to make it flavorful, and even then it was pretty mediocre. Thanks anyway.

I used pinto beans with jalapenos and this turned out good. The brand of chorizo I used was Cacique chorizo de puerco. I'm not sure the baked beans would make a huge difference but I thought it needed a little heat and the jalapenos delivered.
