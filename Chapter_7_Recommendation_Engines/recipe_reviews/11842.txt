This was a great basic sauce but I did make a few changes that people might like: put a tbsp. of olive oil in a pan and saute 1-2 cloves of garlic until brown, add onions and saute until translucent. Then add mushrooms ( I added 2 cups), a small can of olives, chopped artichokes, and basil. I then added the flour and milk until sauce thickened. Then I added 2 cups of tomatoes (b/c I love them) and 1 tbsp. of italian herbs and 1 tbsp. of parmasean cheese. I served with angel hair and foccacia bread. It was delicious.

I like to add a little more sauciness than what this recipe calls for, by using grated parmesan in conjunction with the flour, and adding extra milk. This makes for a thicker, richer sauce that coats all the noodles.

I pureed all the vegetables in my processor because I like a smoother sauce.  After pureeing, I simmered the sauce on the stove and added a little fat free evaporated milk.  I didn't need any flour at all.  It turned out great!

Have to give it 5 stars when it tastes this good and is this easy.

I used marinated artichokes (which I think are packed in water with some oil and spices), and it tasted great.

I went for the route of cooking up some garlic/onion in olive oil before making the sauce.  Also added dried basil (no fresh) and a bit of oregano.

I absolutely love this recipe!  Instead of the 2 tomatoes, which I don't always have on hand, I use a can of diced tomatoes.  Yummy!

This is a great recipe.  I have fixed it twice.  My family loves it.  The first time I fixed it according to recipe, and the second time I included some cubed chicken breast.  It is great both ways.  Thanks Holly...

I thought this was quite tasty.  I used different vegetables only because I used what I had on hand (onions, roasted red peppers, zucchini and tomatoes), but followed the recipe for the most part.  I really liked it and thought it was a good change from standard pasta and not as fattening as some alfredo sauces are.

As others have mentioned, it's not really alfredo, but it's still really good.  I omitted the flour and used heavy cream instead of milk and added minced fresh garlic and some sweet red pepper.  This is a nice quick way to serve pasta. I will make this again.

I made all sorts of changes to this recipe, but it turned out fantastic!  I sauteed the onions beforehand, then sprinkled them with basil because I didn't have fresh.  I used marinated canned artichokes.  I then added the milk and flour.  I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Then added garlic salt and parmesan cheese and it turned out great.  Let it simmer for about 7 minutes so the flavors blended and served over pasta with a side of baked chicken.  A great meal

We really enjoyed this.  I did saute  the onions and mushrooms briefly ahead.  Then I used some non-fat sour cream because it was in the refrigerator.

This recipe was good.  I cooked the onions with the artichokes in some butter, and then made the cream sauce.  I also added some fat-free cream cheese to make a richer sauce, and a bit of garlic.  I used a lot of pepper (personal taste) and served it over angel hair.  This recipe scales down easily when cooking for one!

Not bad and super easy.  I only used a drained canned of diced tomatoes along with the milk/flour and artichokes.  Threw in some dried basil and onion powder as well.  Prior to everything, sauteed two cloves of garlic in olive oil like another person suggested.  Good flavor and was just what I was looking for to get rid of an old can of artichoke hearts!

It was a nice dish, but I thought the "alfredo" sauce was a bit bland.  I will try making again and tweaking it a bit though, because the rest of the flavors were nice

This recipe turned out great. I followed SONFLOWERJEWEL05's suggestions and sauted the onions and mushrooms first, separately from the rest of the ingredients. I also substituted soy milk for regular milk. This made a very good meal that can be prepared quickly.

Great recipe! I preferred to saute the garlic and onion before hand, and then add in the mushrooms, artichokes, and some black olives. I stirred in the tomatoes, flour and milk and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan and some Italian seasoning. Instead of pasta we mixed it with some grilled Italian sausage and spinach tortellini. A great white sauce without the calories! Next time I will make it with whole wheat flour and low fat, 1% milk.

Love it! I was a little concerned as I was preparing the sauce that it didn't look very good, but once it started cooking up it looked and smelled delicious! It was a lot of work to make but worth it, and I'd make it again.

Not much flavor just following the directions. Needs more garlic, salt, and we added parmesan at the table to give it a bit more flavor.

Maybe I didn't make this right, but it just lacked some serious flavor.  I did use fat free condensed milk instead of whole milk, so maybe I lost some of the savory flavor that way.  I tried to take the majority of the suggestions into account, but it just wasn't great.  Probably won't make again.

I don't even like alfredo sauce, but this is great!  Probably because it's not creamy like you would think.  It's light and flavorful...but definitely room for personaliztion!

I've noticed that pretty much everyone who rated this recipe highly commented that they added something else to it to add flavor.  That's because this recipe as written just doesn't really have much.

Not bad. Next time instead of adding the artichoke water I will add white wine. I did cook the onion first cause that is what I am used to...not really an alfredo sauce, but looking foward to the wine addition. It was lacking a little something.

This recipe is a good step in the right direction, but needed more oomph.  I started by sauteeing the onion and a couple of cloves of garlic, then adding in the artichokes, milk, flour, etc.  After adding the rest of the ingredients I tossed in some crushed red pepper.  A good basic sauce on which to build!

I used fat free evaporated milk instead of the whole milk, works well.  I love veggies also so I added green and red peppers also!!  I put this sauce over spaghetti squash and it was great!!  Very filling!!

Delicious.  It is quick and easy to make.  My boyfriend was very impressed.  I found it to be lacking something in flavor, though.  Otherwise a great recipe.
