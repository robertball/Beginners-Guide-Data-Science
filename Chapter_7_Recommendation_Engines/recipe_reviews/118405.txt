This recipe is a good start, but on its own it's a little bland.  I tripled the amount of garlic (we really like garlic and normally double the amount in a recipe) and added oregano, thyme and rosemary.  I baked the squash @ 350F for about 40 minutes and did the rest on the stovetop.

After reading the other reviews, I used twice the garlic, and I subsituted a jar of medium salsa for the tomato/oil mixture. I also used SteamFresh vegetables (they make a broccoli/snap peas/carrots medley), which made the vegetable part easy. With the alterations, it was really good! My boyfriend and I loved the taste - the perfect amount of spiciness, and incredibly easy!

This was great! I cooked the squash halves in the microwave for about ten minutes in 1/4 inch of water, then I shredded the squash into a casserole dish. I sauteed a purple onion, a carrot, a green bell pepper, three cloves of garlic, and half of a zucchini in a tablespoon of olive oil. I grilled some spicy sausages, chopped 'em up and added them to the mix. I mixed everything together in the casserole dish and baked it covered with foil at 350 for 20 minutes.

I tried this recipe but found it had very little taste.  I took small spoons full in little bowls and tried adding an ingredient to give it flavor, but did not find anything that made it great.  I tried Italian dressing, next I tried oregano, then beef broth, even extra salt.  Nothing I tried made it something I wanted to try again.

This was really excellent. The only thing I did differently was to increase the garlic (we love garlic) and I added half of a diced bell pepper, which I microwaved for 2 minutes. It was really really good. It was filling, and nutritious, and looked great, too! It received rave reviews from both my dad and husband, both of whom I think would rather have a meat-based meal. And it's great for our hot Phoenix summer-no oven required!

I doubled the garlic, replaced the tomatoes with red bell peppers and left out the snow peas.  I also added the thyme, rosemary, and oregano as suggested by another reviewer and about 3/4 cup of Roasted Red Pepper Alfredo sauce.  Very flavorful!

Excellent!  I love the fact that you can use this recpie to *clean out* the fridge by adding pretty much whatever you have.  I topped with frech mozarella cheese and then broiled until it was melted.  Delicious!

This is a really nice recipe that's easy to modify with whatever veggies you have on hand.  I made a great version of this.  I had some leeks that I wanted to use in something so I cooked the carrots and broccoli, then sauteed thinly sliced leeks with lots of garlic, salt and pepper in butter. Meanwhile I had roasted the spaghetti squash to get it tender, and once everything was ready I just combined it all together and got rave reviews.

This was a bit bland.  Will definitely make again, but will spice it up a bit with additional flavor--more Italian season and pepper perhaps.

THis dish was very easy tomake. It was my first time cooking with this squash. I liked the result. I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I added Fire Roasted diced tomatoes, and the Italian herbs. It was a winner with our company.

Served inside of half the squash.  Bake large Spaghetti squash at 350 (face down in an inch of water) 60 min.  Saute chopped carrots, onion and okra until soft.  Add thyme, bit of rosemary, garlic and a can of canned tomatoes (l like Italian style). let simmer for 5 min, add a splash of red wine. Scrape the sides of the cooked squash with a fork to loosen the spaghetti.  Scope veggies and juices in to squash top with parm. and return to oven for 10 min.

I really liked this recipe I did tweak it a bit so that i could bake it in the oven and not in the microwave. 
preheat oven to 350 degrees
cut spaghetti squash lengthwise, remove seeds.
place on baking sheet cut side down and bake for 45min or until tender
chop tomatoes, garlic and slice carrots.
put tomatoes, garlic and oil in a small sauce pot over med heat add basil, salt and pepper. heat until tomatoes are tender, stirring occastionally.
steam carrots, peas, and broccoli until tender.
when the squash is done, using a fork seperate the squash into strands in a bowl. toss with tomato mixture and steamed veggies. serve with parmasean cheese.

loved it! did make a few changes though. I used celery instead of peas and sweat red pepper instead of tomatoes, because that`s what I had on hand. I also added some onion about 1/2 cup and dint use any cheese. I ate it with a little ranch on the side and really enjoyed it.

I made this recipe because I had a spaghetti squash from my garden that I didn't know what to do with. Recipe was pretty good...I added leftover sausage and more seasonings to add flavor. (since those posting said recipe needed it) I used frozen veggies, since that was all I had. I would use fresh if I ever made it again. I also did not microwave at all, I used the top of the stove and then baked at 350 for 20 minutes. It was a good way to use up veggies and leftovers.

AMAZING, DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know why everyone doesn't have 5 stars because I thought this was great. I didn't use any snow peas though and added canned chicken to mine which added some protein. Then I added more parmesan cheese which made it even better. I'm going to make it again!! A must try (possibly with chicken)

Isn't it funny how we take a recipe and change it up? HA..but this is a wonderful recipe to use whatever veg. you have on hand.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used a can of diced Italian tomatoes.  Since I had more veg's than tomatoes (I only had a small can) I added a can of tomato sauce.  As suggested I added more garlic than called for. I had a package of frozen cauliflower, brocolli & carrot mixture + I added a few frozen English Peas.  I baked it 350 approx 25 minutes. After taking from oven I put cheese on top.  So good my husband ate a large portion and took more to work today. Next time I am going to use Rotel and Mexican Cheese for a different variety. YUMMY RECIPE - A KEEPER

I had high hopes for this, but thought it turned out pretty bland. I had even added veggie Italian sausage, which helped, but not enough. I think I will look for some ideas to make it more flavorful and try it once more.

Yummy! You can really use any veggies, add different cheeses and you can steam veggies on stove if you prefer instead of microwave.

Best way to cook Spaghetti Squash thank you thank you!  While the squash was in the microwave I sauteed half a white onion 3 cloves of garlic & cup of sliced mushrooms in olive oil with oregano.  I added the squash to it & tossed with some balsamic vinegar & more olive oil.  It was amazing, so much so I went out the next day and bought another!

I had left over spaghetti squash and substituted leftover spaghetti sauce for tomatoes and then sauteed all the ingredients together (adding ingredients like broccoli and carrots first, and finishing with lighter ingredients like basil and sauce).  Was a tasty way to use up the vegetables in the fridge!

I gave this recipe 3 stars b/c I found it was still too bland.  I tripled the garlic, added oregano & even some shredded cheese & it was still too bland.  I think this recipe needs some meat or something!

enh! nothing to rave about. guess I don't like spaghetti squash much. I added 2-3 tbs Garlic salt and used 2 gloves. that was tastey but the texture of the squash didn 't do it for me... won't try again. I did like all the veggies and such together. I added cilantro and soy beans those were my favorite part of the dish.

This was great. My family loves it.  I added some chicken and some other veggies...Then I added cheddar, mozz, provolone, and cream cheese chunks and put it under the broiler for about 5 min.  We eat it all the time.  Thanks for sharing.
