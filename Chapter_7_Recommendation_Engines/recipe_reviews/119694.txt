This was a good white cake I didn't make the fruit filling I needed to find a better white cake recipe and this one worked.

This recipe was amazing!!! Everyone loved it! I took the advice of one reviewer and used less white chocolate chips (3/4 cups). It turned out wonderful- one person said that there was a perfect balance in the icing- not too much of anything. The pineapple also added a nice texture to the icing. The whole thing was delicious! Will use again.

I didn't use the whole recipe, just the cake part, which actually deserves five stars!  This is the best white cake I've ever made.   It had a very even, light texture and both layers were in perfect proportion.   I used sliced, sugared fresh strawberries between the layers, and frosted it with the Wilton white buttercream recipe for my daughter's birthday cake.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  Be sure to use clear vanilla extract if you are shooting for a really white cake.  It was delicious, and this will now be my go-to recipe for white cake.  Thank you!

I made this for my mother's 75th birthday, and it was WONDERFUL!!! I was a little unsure about the possibly artificial taste of the whipped topping, but it was fine. I used strawberry preserves instead of jam, which worked well. I also subbed two whole eggs instead of just whites. The texture of the cake was light and fluffy, and it looked gorgeous. I have a new favorite birthday cake for the few who prefer something other than chocolate - and there are PLENTY of birthdays in my family! Thanks so much!!

WOW.  This cake is perfect for spring and is delicious on so many levels.  I didn't want a layer cake, so I baked the cake in a 9x13, made half the recipe for the filling and topped the cake with the filling (omitted the frosting).  I then arranged strawberry halves on top of the filling and drizzled the whole thing with chocolate ganache.  I took the advice of other reviewers and half the amount of white chocolate in the filling.  My guests LOVED it.

5 Stars for the cake portion (I used a different filling). This is the best white cake recipe I have used. I will turn to this when I need a white cake for any occassion. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very refreshing dessert!  I made it for my husbands birthday.  Whenever you get a bite of the filling with the cake itself, it is like eating strawberry shortcake.  I gave it only a four is because next time I will do something different with the icing.  Too much of a vanilla chip aftertaste.  But the cake was WONDERFUL!  I am claiming the white cake as my new white cake recipe.  Thanks!

Flavor was good but I found the cake to be dry and spongey like an angel-food cake.  Not what I was expecting for a white cake.  Won't be using this recipe again, sorry :(

Wow!!! I made this for a baby shower, and everyone loved it. I made my own chocolate butter cream frosting and I used a strawberry spread from Costco for the filling along with fresh strawberries. Not Complicated! It was so easy and I will use this as a staple recipe for my  white cake from now on. I used two 9x13 pans and doubled the recipe. It didn't throw anything off and they layered beautifully. I have been asked to make this again, and I will!!!

I have made this topping twice for two different birthdays and everybody loved it!  I also did 3/4 cups of white chips instead of a full cup, and it was perfect!

This was a huge hit!!! Cake and filling/frosting turned out fantastic!
Although, I still gave 5 stars- for taste and presentation, the cake was not quite the consistency of fluffy white cake, but rather- spongy pound cake. Which happened to work beautifully anyway, but the cake was much different than I had anticipated. I also added a bit extra jam and pineapple to suit us, and again- turned out awesome! The Birthday Girl was very happy :)

Tried this just for the white cake part without the filling. So far, it's very good. I only added 2 full eggs instead of 4 whites though, so I ended up with a white/yellow cake. I am going to frost it with a chocolate frosting with little andes mint pieces in it :D

The best from-scratch cake recipe I've ever used.  It turned out perfect, both as a layer cake and as cupcakes.  Even the die-hard boxed cake mix lovers in our group thought it was great.

I made this cake for a friends birthday.  Someone else brought her a cake also.  Once they tasted this one no one cared about the other until this one was all gone.  It was a big hit.  Great recipe especially the frosting/filling.  I did use 3/4 cups of melted chips like others suggested.  I will be making this again.

This has become my go to recipe for white cake. Always comes out great, however last time I reduced the recipe down to one to make one for myself in a ramekin and made a mistake I added 2 1/2 TBSP butter instead of in Teaspoons. Well it was the most amazing little cake ever! P.S If you reduce it to 1 serving add 1/4 Teaspoon of cornstarch  (instead of 3/8th an egg white?) and change the measurements of flour and milk; 2 TBSP of milk and 4 TBSP of Flour.

This cake was good, but it tasted a lot like pancakes. I needed to make a wedding cake, but the cake didn't rise at all so I had to find a new White cake recipe fast. I may have done something wrong, but I've tried making this a few times and failed each time. It tastes great, but comes out looking and tasting like a pancake.

Yummy!!! This was my first from scratch cake. Turned out wonderful! Brought it up to work and everyone loved it! I also cut down on the white chocolate (only 3/4 cup used). I read a review that someone made just the filling and it was runny...make sure you drain the pineapple well or it will be runny! 

Also, I think next time while I'm waiting for the cakes to cool will put the filling in the fridge as well. Might help it set up a bit better. Who knows. This cake was scrumptious!

I used only the cake part of this recipe, and it was very good.  We all liked how soft and light it was, and the birthday girl thought it was just perfect!
