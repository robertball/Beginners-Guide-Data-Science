I wanted to make this tonight as a surprise for my husband because it was the first thing he cooked for me 25 years ago when we first met and started dating.   He thinks this is what "sealed the deal" so to speak!   lol  I let him think that ;-)
     
This casserole is in the oven as I am writing this.   I stole a little bit before I put it in the oven and it is AWESOME!   OF course my husband's version is very straight forward.   Blue box Kraft Mac and Cheese, 1 can tuna, a slice of Kraft Singles on the top (cut diagonally, because he's fancy) hahahaha   Then baked.  PERFECTION!   lol  Just between us though... This one is MUCH better!   I did swap out the mushrooms for peas just because I was in the mood for peas, I also added in a little Dijon mustard, but that's it.  Oh, and I still got Kraft Mac and cheese, but the fancier one that has the cheese sauce in it,( because I'M fancy!  lol) unlike the orange powder (what IS that stuff anyway? )lol   I love it and can't wait for my husband to get home so he can have it tonight.   Thanks Melissa Loudy for posting this :-)

I've made this twice now. It's a real winner with my family, particularly my husband who likes tuna, but has never been a fan of any tuna cassarole until now. Tip: for those who think 1 cup of bread crumbs is too much. Just sprinkle over the top until desired amount is reach. Problem solved. 5 stars for ease in making, the over all taste and its a good meal if your on a budget. Most usually have every ingredient on hand anyway! Great recipe!

This is a good, quick meal.  I fixed this for my kids and now for the grand kids.  The only thing I do differently is to use English peas instead of mushrooms

This recipe tasted better than it sounded. I Replaced the mushrooms with broccoli and used garlic and herb bread crumbs.

This was ok but I think it would be better with two 6 oz. cans of tuna.

I used fresh mushrooms and added a double amount.  Also added 1/2 c. diced onion.  I covered it with 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese before baking.  Put an aluminum foil 'hat' over the casserole dish before putting it in the oven and slow baked it for 1 hour.  Hubby and I both liked it.  Will make again.

Saute your own veggies instead of canned shrooms. Try: onion, garlic, broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms. Add garlic and onion powders, and salt.

Was very good but suggest using less than 1 C of bread crumbs. I doubled the recipe & used 1 C of bread crumbs & it was way too much. It calls for 1 C in the initial recipe. Next time I'll use 1/4

Really simple busy day recipe. I keep all the ingredients in the pantry so I can quickly whip up a batch for my wife and I.  I added a half can of cream of mushroom soup and a half cup shredded cheddar to the mixture and half cup shredded cheddar as a topping. Real comfort food. BTW, tried using a full can of soup but it was too salty for our liking.  Also have made it with left over diced ham, turkey and chicken —- all variations were good. I also reduced bread crumbs to 1/2 cup as so many others have suggested.

It was pretty good I swapped out the mushroom for a can of beans and used crushed Doritos instead of bread crumbs. It turned out great and was a hit in my house.

Been making this for decades.  I usually add chopped onion and sliced green olives and top it with coarsely crushed potato chips instead of bread crumbs.  Thanks, so good!

Delicious and similar to an old favorite. First time I made it as written except about 1/3 the crumbs. Second time I added green veggie and did not bake it - just mixed it together and heated it after pasta was cooked.  Also the can of tuna was larger.  (This is a GREAT food storage meal!)

I used velveeta Mac & cheese. Did not add butter or milk. Substituted peas for mushrooms. The boyfriend loved it even more than my precious tuna casserole recipe!! (I like both recipes about the same.) Extremely easy to make!!

I made this recipe for my husband as I am not a fan of hot tuna.  He really enjoyed this dish.  I did sub frozen peas for the mushrooms as he does not care for them.  It did stay nice and creamy while baking and that was a plus.  I also made this for the AR August Faceless Recipes on Pinterest.

I didn't have any mushrooms as I don't like them, so I didn't use any. The recipe is basically make the mac and cheese according to the box, add a can of tuna, tops with breadcrumbs and voila! I added a bit of shredded cheddar as that's how I always make mac and cheese. I used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs and that seemed still too much so 1/2 cup would probably be better. I should have used my tiny casserole dish because the medium sized dish was too big. By thinning it out so much and then adding breadcrumbs, it ended up very dry. I also only cooked it for a little over 15 minutes because it was so spread out. This is a super easy recipe but next time I'm going to use less breadcrumbs and a smaller dish.

I am sure this recipe is delicious as is. However, I made some changes to our liking. Used Cracker Barrell White Cheddar mac and cheese, peas instead of mushrooms and topped with seasoned breadcrumbs to our liking. Only used one can of tuna, might use two cans and a little more milk  next time I make this.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe.

What a lucky dinner time for me and my husband. I had exactly each ingredient, changed the mushrooms to peas though. I didn’t know what to make for dinner until I searched up Mac and cheese tuna because I saw that I had tuna. I added cheese on top and I added a tiny bit of bread crumbs. Thanks for saving my life I legit didn’t know what to make for dinner tonight! Amazing! :) I even joined because of this!

I made it exactly by the recipe because I was not familiar with making a dish like this. I would recommend reading other comments and seeing what they did! One cup of bread crumbs was way too much for the recipe, I would possibly double the recipe and possibly still use less. It's a very basic tuna mac dish. I also would add some velvet a cheese, with the normal box macaroni, it did not have enough cheese. But I'm learning!! :)

Really good and SO easy! I didn't have mushrooms so I used peas and it was delicious! I think next time I'll double up the recipe so there's leftovers and I might add some cheese to the top.

My 5 year old loved it! I substituted corn for the mushrooms and added an entire bag of frozen broccoli. Didn't come out dry, it was really good. The bread crumbs don't do much for me, so next time I'll save the calories and skim them.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. I don't believe in rating a recipe if you make changes to it because it is no longer that recipe. 
Really liked it, quick, easy, simple very little clean up, what's not to like. My husband is a meat and potato man and he liked it. 
A real winner in my books.

I made this last night, and I did a few things differently. I added sautéed onions and celery (I love celery with my tuna). I also used velvetta mac and cheese instead of the kraft. Overall, it turned out really good and it was so easy! Next time I would try adding some velvetta cheese to the casserole, mostly because I couldn't really taste the cheese as much after baking.

This recipe was how you'd expect it to taste basically. I doubled the tuna, because one can just isn't enough between my husband and I! I don't see the need to stick it in the oven, unless you're topping it with extra cheese. If I was to make it again, I'd add some garlic and peas. I don't have mushroom and it needed SOMETHING so I used mixed veggies, it was good for lunch, wouldn't work for dinner if you ask me. Love how simple it was, thank you!

Eh. It's one of those, 'throw together what you have left right before payday' kind of meals. My family didn't care for it too much. I don't think I would try it again using anything else either.
