I couldn’t find apricot nectar, (they had to our), so I substituted and bought peach. Same thing with the jello. The only apricots in it were the can of halves. I bought dried apricots, thinking that would add a little more apricot flavor, but it turned out that the organic apricots are almost black in color and I did not want to do that! (They are not processed with sulfur, which is why they are dark and not that beautiful apricot color).It was delicious just the same. A perfect, light, airy spring/ summer dish. Pretty color. One star lost for “hard to find” items.
