It was my daughter's night to cook so she picked this recipe to try. Turned out great just as the recipe was written.  It was easy to make and everyone  loved it!  Only problem is that we should have doubled the recipe, we all wanted more!

4 18 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/245100/fiesta-refried-bean-soup/ ... This wasn't quite four star for me, but because of ease, I bumped it up.  I'd like it to be thicker, but maybe the tortilla strips I didn't add would cure that.  I added a half cup frozen corn instead; also leftover red pepper.  This is one of those "fast, good & doesn't make enough for an army" soups.  Thanks!  Oh, I didn't have bacon so squinted & added 1/8t liquid smoke.

This was really good!  I didn't have any celery or cilantro.  I used ancho chili powder and Mexican oregano along with the garlic powder.  For the salsa, I used Trader Joe's hot hatch valley green chili salsa - we like spicy and this added a nice heat!  Served with cheese quesadillas instead of  cheese garnish and tortilla strips and it was like a Tex-Mex version of the famous "couple",  tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich!  Thank you so much for this quick and  yummy recipe bd.weld!  A definite make again here!

This will definitely warm you on a winter's night. With -5 degrees outside, this soup hit the spot! I topped it with some avocado and sour cream, not having any cheese or tortilla strips. All the flavours just seem to work perfectly together for a one-bowl meal. Thank you for the recipe.

Yummy.  I never would have thought to make soup with refried beans.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but only because I had some veggies in the fridge that I wanted to use up, and they worked great.  Added 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 poblano pepper, 1/2 small jalapeno, 1/2 very small zucchini, fresh garlic, and accidentally opened a can of beef broth instead of chicken broth, and it was fine.  Omitted the salsa since I had added all those veggies.  Added cumin.  I made a bunch of changes, but it was still basically the same soup.  Thanks for the recipe.  The red bell pepper and zucchini made it pretty, and then I floated some very thinly sliced raw zucchini on the top.

Absolutely delicious. I lightened up the fat content considerably and it was still fabulous. The bacon really adds something special. Thanks for sharing!

Great soup and hearty enough for main dish. My husband and son love it and they aren't soup fans. I was generous with the salsa and spices because we like it spicy. Very versatile to adjust for your own taste. It's thick like pea soup but more broth can be used to thin it out. This is now a family favorite.

Great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly as is, although I did make my own tortilla chips on the side instead of topping onto the soup -- dare I admit that I dipped them!! Thanks, Brian, for another 5star recipe, and thanks to Swanson's for publishing!!

Really good, my whole family liked it!  I just think the spices should be tweaked a bit - I like the McCormick's taco seasoning better in beans.

Excellent soup.  Used approximately 3/4 carton of chicken broth and one and half cans of refried  beans only because I had half can left from another meal.  Also added one can of diced tomatoes. Used medium salsa bur Rotel would also work.  Topped with cheese and tortilla strips.

This gets five stars for being delicious and incredibly cheap and easy to make. leftover salsa, homemade chicken stock from the freezer, and slightly stale chips I had went into this, along with a can of black beans. Didn't change anything else. My husband and I loved it! I think next time I will add some shredded chicken, and make sure I have cilantro on hand.

Easy to make with simple ingredients, tasty and filling. I added sliced smoked sausage to make it even more filling.

This was an awesome soup! I didn't have celery on hand, so I used green peppers. I didn't have oregano, so I used cumin. The soup was rich and creamy. Perfect for cold weather or if you have a cold! Topped it with cheese, cilantro, and chips. Yummy! There won't be leftovers!

made this soup for lunch and essentially followed the recipe to a T aside from swapping the celery with sweet peppers.  I really enjoyed the flavor and how easy/quick it was to make. if I were to suggest any changes I'd recommend doubling the recipe to get 5-6 servings (currently it would serve 3 @ best) and adding more beans for a thicker texture...a solid 4.5 out of 5, I'd definitely make this again!!!

I love bacon and didn't think this was even possible, but it ruined the soup for me.  Something was off with the flavors and it just didn't do it for me or my family.  I won't be making this one again, sorry.
