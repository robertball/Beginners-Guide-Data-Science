since I couldn't figure out how to edit my prior review,  here goes.  My team at work is doing Whole 30  so I wanted to see if I could tweak.  although I am not participating.  I have a great set of Rachel Ray pots so I skipped the oil. I substituted himalayas salt for soy sauce.   I upped the garlic.   it was still amazing.  Plus the calories are only about 225 and a lot less fat!

I also added fresh mushrooms to the mix, it would have been easier to cook the livers separately and then add them.  Overall this recipe had good flavor and is a healthier option than the traditional fried livers/mashed potatoes & gravy I would have rather had the latter though.

My husband said this was very good. I sprinkled lime juice instead of lemon juice in place of the sumac because he likes the taste of limes better than lemons, especially when cooked.  I don't like liver of any kind so I'm rating this on his sayso!

Delicious!

I've also tried it with hot green chili peppers and it worked a treat.  Highly recommended!

I liked the addition of peppers in this recipe. The flavor was lovely. I used frozen pepper mix (green, red and yellow strips) and lemon juice instead of sumac. I added an extra tsp. of soy sauce. I was afraid that allspice will add an unpleasant taste, but it all blended in nicely. I will be making it again. Thanks!

I really wanted to love this recipe because we adore chicken liver.  I tried it because I was looking for something that wasn't fried or a pate.  With that being said, even after reading the reviews and tweaking the ingredients, it was just a 3.5 star recipe with a half a star for creativity.  I omitted the sumac because we don't care for lemon/lime flavoring in food with the exception of fish.  I doubled all the ingredients except for the liver and added a can of sliced water chestnuts with a small bag of snow peas.  I dredged the liver (cut in to cubes) through seasoned flour, pan fried in shallow oil and placed on paper towel to drain.  I knew from experience that if I added the raw liver to the veggies that it looks like a horrible pink mess.  After tasting the veggie mix, I added 1 tbsp of Badia Complete Seasoning and an inch of anchovy paste.  I served it in a bowl with 1/2 cup of chicken flavored rice topped with a generous helping of veggie mix.  I added the liver on top so it didn't get soggy too fast.

The overall flavor of the veggies and seasoning was tasty after I added another tablespoon of soy sauce and a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil, but neither my husband nor I liked chicken livers in this dish.  I think tender pieces of beef or cut up dark chicken meat would have been better.  I'm going to try it again with another type of meat.

I made 1/2 of the recipe , only due to the size of skillet, but it was still just as good. A first time experience with the green and red peppers with the liver and onions and I think it is the best way I have ever had it! Now a favorite!

I really liked this recipe. Since I had leftover spaghetti noodles and wanted a nice thick sauce, I added some milk and cream cheese to the livers. Sprinkle some parmesan and voila! This one's a delicious keeper.

A little bland for us. BUT , that is a personal taste thing. 
Otherwise, this receipe is good. Quantity is accurate - quick easy thing to have on hand. I even have the  right variety of sumac required to make the spice. Used lemon juice, and that may be where the bland came from.

First I am a novice.  I did not use green pepper.  I used yellow and sweet onion (purple).  I did not have the sumac spice I just used lemon juice, and some lemon pepper I had on hand.  The smell was fab, and like the taste.  Eating liver is new and I find this very pleasant and quick recipe.  I love the spice combo and will probably try this with chicken or beef as well.
