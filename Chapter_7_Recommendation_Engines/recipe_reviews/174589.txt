I don't have a Trader Joes so I roasted some pine nuts then sprinkled them with chili powder and lime (the powder). I left out the cayennne and added a little garlic.  I put it on chicken I baked and mixed it in some rice, beans & corn for the side. It was really good, both my husband and I devoured it.

I made the recipe as written and the cashews were too prominent.  It tasted like an herby nut butter.  Delicious herby nut butter, but not quite what I was going for.  2nd batch I used 3/4 cup of chili lime cashews and I love it!  Omitted the cayenne because it seems there is enough chili in the cashews, grated the zest in addition to the 3 tbsp. of lime juice, and used 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp.  I think this will be great on roasted potatoes, any meat (fish, chicken, beef...), or just eaten by the spoonful.  Yum!  Each batch got a bit over 1 pint of pesto.

I will definitely make this again! I added more garlic, zested the limes and used more lime juice, used nutritional yeast to keep it vegan. YUM!!
