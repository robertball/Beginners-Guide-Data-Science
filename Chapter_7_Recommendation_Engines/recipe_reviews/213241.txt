Soggy? My brownies didn't turn out soggy at all. I used the cocoa krispies (rather than rice krispies) and crushed them extremely well (until it was flour-like.) I followed the recipe exactly, however, was out of all-purpose flour and used whole wheat-- still turned out perfectly. I used slivered almonds for the little football people lined up in the middle. Refrigerate overnight after frosting the brownies- IMO makes them better. *The key is crushing the cocoa krispies until finely ground. Only problem I had was the endzones-- the rice krispies fall off easily, which you could prob press down with a spoon, though it alters the look a bit. What an awesome superbowl treat!! [I took photos, but it wouldn't let me post directly here]

I made this recipe for the big game tomorrow and I'm glad I tried it before I took it to the party!  The rice krispies were soggy and chewy in the brownies.  I can see why they want you to put icing on top as it covers the hard top.  I would not recommend them.
