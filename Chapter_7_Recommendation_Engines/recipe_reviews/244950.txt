Absolutely amazing!!!! No other words. Simple to make and delicious just without the excess oil! Thanks for this recipe.
Will now make a weekly meal out of this... and picky eater kids ask for more :-) The only thing is that I didn't add the lemon zest

Made following recipe exactly, except we didn't flip the chicken and it certainly wasn't soggy.  We had great praise from the 56 people to whom we served it.  Easy to make.  Served with pickled red cabbage, German Spaetzle Dumplings (AR), and my own mushroom gravy, for an excellent Oktoberfest luncheon.  Dessert was Deep Dish Brownies (AR) served with a Quick Cherry Sauce.

Extremely delicious dish, and an excellent recipe as written. It's definitely worth the mild annoyance of dredging/coating. It was very good even with store-brand seasoned bread crumbs. Don't omit the lemon zest! It's what sends the dish above and beyond IMO.

Excellent!!! We loved this chicken. So much flavour and far less oil than the traditional cooking method. I made this exactly as written and can't think of anything that would improve it. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Update: I don't know why I waited so long to make this again, so very good.  I thought that I had taken out four chicken breasts but  after defrosting I discovered that two were pork loin chops. Proceeded with the recipe anyway and I wasn't disappointed. Thanks again Chef V.

Quite good. I didn't have lemon to zest, so I substituted lemon pepper for the pepper and zest. Panko crumbs were a timesaver.  Be sure the baking sheet is truly hot before taking it out of the oven and put the chicken immediately into the hot oil if you want it to brown.

I'm not sure what happened since I followed the recipe exactly, but this was a total flop. It came out soggy; I tried flipping and baking more, but was afraid it would dry out. When my extended baking wasn't doing the trick, I pulled them out and finished them off in an oiled pan. That helped crisp up the outside and I suppose it was less oil in the long run, but kind of defeated the purpose of oven baked!

Worked out great.  The chicken was was crispy, tasty and easy.  I used A bit of extra oil after plating the schnitzels and scraped everything into a sauce pan,  added a pat of butter and used the left over paprika flour mix to make a sour cream dill sauce. Mushroom gravy is traditional, but I have a H8ter in the house.

Yee-Haw! Tasty, moist and juicy chicken breasts without having to fry! I used gluten free ingredients. My chicken breasts were a bit bigger than average, so I had to double the bread crumbs and egg. Times were right on though, 6 minutes on each side and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  My kids typically don't like meat that is breaded and scrape it off but not with this dish.  We all loved it as written.  Definitely a keeper.  I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.  Family said the meal was better than the schnitzel at our favorite german restaurant.

Works fine as is.  I once tried House-Autry chicken breader instead of bread crumbs and got a lighter coating that way.  By the way, auf Deutsch die Name ist "Haenchen Schnitzel."  ("Little Hen Schnitzel"  I couldn't produce the umlaut  here so had to substitute "ae")

I made this with panko instead of a finer breadcrumb.  I was not happy with the panko and wish I had used finer breadcrumbs.  It was still good and I recommend it.  Next time I make this I will use finer breadcrumbs.

I needed a new way to cook pork loin chops. I followed the directions (cut everything in half because I only had three chops) and they turned out great. The lemon zest added just the right zing. I will try it with chicken next.

Made as directed and turned out juicy and delicious.  Sprinkled some lemon juice over the baked breasts.  Thanks for a great simple recipe.

I've been making chicken breasts like this for all my married life. I'm now 70!  The only thing different is the lemon sext. I tried it and it's good. I sometimes pop the chicken in 'homemade' buttermilk. It's 1% milk with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice

I made it with cajun added directly to the chicken and went very good but I also added oats instead of bread crumbs and was a mistake.  I will try with panko bread crumbs next time.

Great recipe. Unfortunately I had run out of eggs at the time of making so used milk instead and repeated flour and egg/milk dipping (double dipped). This worked as it created a 'glue' for the breadcrumbs to stick to.

It worked perfect for me! The oil did smoke quite a bit when it was in the oven by itself, so I just took it out and put it in with the chicken, and if you dip the chicken in another layer of eggs and breadcrumbs it creates a better crust. Add a bit of honey and lemon juice and it’s perfect.

The flavor was good, but I didn't use enough oil to get a good crisp on the first batch, and the chicken stuck to the foil.  The second batch was much better, I used parchment paper instead of foil, and made sure to put enough oil to get a good crisp.

I only rate 5 star if it's the best food ever,  This was great and fast. I got my chicken at Sams club and I used 3 very large breasts which must be equivalent to this recipe because it worked. The only thing I changed was add garlic powder to the flour mixture. I used Panko bread crumbs which was great. So easy. The lemon zest  is incredible.

I know that when I make chicken like this, I will hear no complaints from the husband or the kids! I only had unseasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I just threw in some seasoning of my own (garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano and dried basil). I loved the method of putting the olive oil on the baking sheet and then drizzling more on top and then baking rather than frying. I served this with a side of dandelion greens ("cicoria" in Italian - which my husband absolutely LOVES). Altogether, It made for a tasty, and healthy weeknight dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as written and it was delish. I’ve made similar recipes but this one was better. I’m assuming the combo of flour then egg then bread crumbs. With the seasonings in between is what made it better. I didn’t see the sogginess a previous poster mentioned but I could see how that happens. If you have the olive oil with the larger opening and use it directly from there I can see putting too much. You want to drizzle it on somewhat evenly. I had a little bit of a rough time with that but I think I need to buy a top that allows less oil to come out. I didn’t have it but I was extra careful to not coat it too much.

Pretty good - although it's difficult to drizzle the oil over the chicken before baking without overdoing it and making the coating oil-saturated (in which case there's not much difference from frying it).  My family thought the coating was a little chewy, albeit tasty.  The baking times (5 minutes per side) were spot-on though, and the lemon zest in the breadcrumb coating was genius!  I'll be using that trick for schnitzel from now on, whether I bake or fry it!

Cooked exactly as recipe called for. Used thinly sliced chicken breasts. Cooking time was perfect. Nice recipe that doesn't take long- healthier than pan frying. Love the lemon zest. Next time I won't use so much breadcrumb since I didn't need it all, to increase the lemon ratio. Served this with kaese spaetzle.

My husband has had a really bad flu the last week. The only thing he can keep down is smoothies and mashed potatoes. I was looking for something that would go well with mashed potatoes and found this recipe. OMG... This was delicious!!!  Hubbie, who has eaten so little the past 4 days gobbled this up and I have to admit that I had seconds. It was fun to make and so good!!! Thank you for an outstanding recipe that will be added to our regular routine - and hopefully, will help Hubbie feel better!

When I told my husband I was making a new recipe with chicken breasts, his face fell. "Chicken breasts are almost always dry", he said. I had read the reviews but was nervous that the chicken woudn't be moist. We cooked it exactly as the recipe suggested, and the chicken was divine. My husband ate 2.5 pieces! What's great about this recipe is that you can change it creatively - add mozzarella, parmesan and tomato sauce for chicken parmigiana. Make a dip with mustard and honey, etc.

Made this tonight for dinner, and it was delicious! Only changes were a dash of garlic powder in the flour mixture, and some minced garlic in the egg mixture.

I've made this several times now. It's better with marjoram and caraway seeds added to the egg. It can also be fairly-low carb, if you "skimp" on the bread crumbs.

I used GF Italian seasoned Panko  and GF flour otherwise stuck to the recipe. Turned out delicious. Golden brown crispy on the outside and moist inside.  Side dishes were cauliflower grits with Parmesan cheese and roasted sweet potatoes.

I cut the chicken into strips before breading, so we could pick up and dip.    It was very good!  Next time, I will add a tablespoon or two of milk to the beaten eggs, as I didn't quite have enough.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my! This was delicious and a keeper recipe! I prepared and served it with chicken gravy, steamed broccoli and roasted squash. My husband loves schnitzel and all German food. He said this was restaurant quality. I oven baked it, but I will reheat the leftovers in my air fryer. Yum!

This is a great quicky dinner. I use more spice and vary it depending on the mood I'm in and the side dishes I'm serving. Replace the breading, or some of it, with ground almond or pecan meal for a low carb tasty alternative. It's also good sauted in a skillet. De-glaze the pan with a little white wine, adjust your spice, and gravy is yours!

This was delicious despite my mistakes! The chicken was moist and tender. I was easily able to convert this recipe to be gluten free for my dietary needs. I was rushing and forgot to season my breadcrumbs and forgot about the lemon zest part! It was still tasty and I served with lemon wedges to squeeze on top. Perfect! I baked the chicken on a rack placed inside a sheet pan and had no problems with soggy breadcrumbs (thanks for that tip a long time ago Nanny129!). Next time I’ll make sure to season the breadcrumbs and zest the lemon. Looking forward to making this recipe again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

My husband and I have gone to Germany several times so I was interested in trying this. It turned out great! I made some fried potatoes with it, which is how it’s usually served in the places we’ve gone. Easy dish and easy clean up, I’ll for sure make it again! Make sure you have a lemon slice for the chicken and potatoes, makes the flavor even better!

This chicken was great. My whole family liked it, even the kids. I have a very picky 10 year old and he thought it was so good. He loved the hint of lemon. I will definitely be making this again.

I used thin sliced chicken breast, and I had no lemon zest.
However, my family absolutely loved the chicken.
I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great chicken strip recipe.     Added 1/2 "smoked" paprika and also a teaspoon of garlic powder.     Great supper with fries that is quick and easy.
Honey mustard dipping sauce: 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 TBSP honey, 1/2 TBSP regular mustard.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I was babysitting my grandkids and needed a good chicken recipe and found this one.  The pieces of chicken my daughter left for me to use were very thick so I cut them into cutlets rather than trying to pound them into thinner pieces.  I ended up with a lot of pieces, which was good as they were gobbled up rather quickly.  The only thing different I did to the recipe was to use half seasoned and half plain bread crumbs.  Next time I will use all seasoned.  I baked them in the oven but definitely want to try cooking them in the air fryer.  The grandkids, my husband and I really enjoyed the chicken this way and it is so easy to put together.

Chicken turned out great except a few pieces were a little soggy on the bottom.  I didn’t use seasoned bread crumbs because I’m trying to watch my sodium so I added spices to my liking.  Definitely don’t omit the lemon zest it does elevate the chicken. Don’t feel so guilt because it has a lot less fat than traditional frying.

I made this and it had to be the most tender and juicy chicken i've ever had. I never had a Chicken Schnitzel before but this as absolutely amazing! I would definitely make it again. My one comment is the bread crumbs were not crispy and after the second day were soggy. My pan probably wasn't hot enough when I put it in though :/

I made it mostly as described (I used Panko instead of normal bread crumbs and didn't use any lemon because I didn't have it), and it tasted good. Except, I think I need to add more seasoning to the flour. I could hardly taste the paprika underneath all the other flavors. I'll try adding it to both the flour and the bread crumbs next time.

Good recipe! I followed it to the letter and it turned out great (although the chicken was thicker - I let it cook an extra minute per side). Plated with buttered egg noodles and steamed carrots/broccoli/cauliflower. Second time making it, and I’ll keep this one!

Will definitely make again. My oven was not warm enough at first and it seemed like they may come out soggy so I got the oven to the correct temp and left them in way longer and they turned out crispy and still juicy which was awesome.

Rookie cook, it didn’t get crispy after 6 mins per side. Plus I don’t understand the heating up the pan process. Tasted OK but I was really disappointed, don’t know what I did wrong. Suggestions????? HELP

5-24-2018 ~This was disappointing, but not surprising as I thought from the outset that this "experiment" might just be too good to be true .  For me, it was.  Easy and quick for sure,  producing moist and tender chicken.  However, this was a poor substitute for the overall browning and crispness you get from frying which would have been just a little more effort (and, admittedly, a little more mess).

Really hot day so I decided to not use the oven. Fried in olive oil and turned out beautiful. The chicken was so moist and breading was flavorful. Will be making this again.

I had been using Vera's method to oven bake pork and veal schnitzel but had never actually made her recipe! We really enjoyed it as the lemon really compliments the chicken. I had plain panko so I processed them in my food processor to make them finer and added Mrs Dash garlic & herb, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, paprika and black pepper. I doubled the baking time as my breasts were quite large, 12 minutes a side was perfect.

5.12.18  Used chicken thighs just because I had a bunch of them in the freezer.  This was super easy, and I loved the fact that I didn't have to brown them on the stove top (no mess), just headed into the oven to bake.  Used Egg Beaters and Italian panko crumbs and served with Pat's Baked Potato Salad and Deluxe Garlic Green Beans, both of which are on this site.  Very nice and easy dinner!

Great base recipe for baked schnitzel, I used pork chops and they came out great this way. Much healthier and quicker than the frying pan. My oil drizzle burned in the pan by the time the oven hit 425, next time I'll use some oil spray on the warmed pans at time of inserting the schnitzels.

Really good.  My son even liked it.  I didn't have lemons on hand but I substituted orange zest and it worked nicely.  I didn't  find that it needed as many bread crumbs but had a nice flavor and was relatively quick if a little messy to cook!

I found it a bit dry. My fault as I was trying to make it a bit healthier for my WW program and I used Pam instead of oil.
I ended up finishing it in a fry pan to crisp and brown more.

I love schnitzel but not the smell of grease in my house. This recipe solved the problem. I followed the recipe except I used a crushed a stack of Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Timing  for baking was right on. Served with lemon slices. Thank you for providing me a schnizel recipe that won’t stink up my house!

I'm not sure why this recipe  received such high ratings. 
No very flavorful.  I won't make it again without lots of changes. 
Two stars instead on 1 because you can never go wrong when you tenderize chicken.

made this as per the recipe the results where very good,  moist and golden, the lemon zest gave it a taste that didn't really appeal to me. It could be the lemon I used I don't know but next time I'm going to try lemon pepper and just serve a wedge of lemon on the side. Served it with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.

This was really good!  My husband said that this was the best schnitzel he'd ever eaten, and his mom is German!  Definitely mix the lemon zest into the bread crumbs, and drizzle the fresh lemon juice over the cooked chicken - the sour lemon was the perfect flavor accompaniment .

This was wonderful!  my teenager and my husband ate it up. I made this according to the recipe using Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  My chicken breasts were on the smaller side, so I only needed one cup of crumbs, but I easily could have made more as we would have eaten the leftovers the next day. Served with mashed potatoes and a salad.

Yum! I used turkey cutlets that I had and I didn't drizzle the top with olive oil.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Simple, flavorful, crunchy, tender. Great recipe that I'll use again! Excellent for a quick and healthy weeknight meal.

a measurement of lemon zest would have made it taste better.  Mine tasted more like lemon chicken and cook time was almost twice as long.  With less lemon and more time to cook It'll still taste great.

This turned out great! No frying needed. I made it exactly as the recipe said. The aroma while baking was so good.  I cooked it a few minutes more on each side, and they crisped up nicely. Served with some gravy (cheated -- used a mix) and some whipped potatoes. Hubs (who is picky) loved them, too. I will make again. Did I mention how quick this recipe is from start to table? A big plus!

The chicken was very tender and moist which was great. Unfortunately none of us liked the lemon zest flavor so next time we will omit that. Next time I think I will also make a gravy.

Used tenderloins and followed recipe exactly (except I used tenderloins LOL!) Was an easy meal. It didn't crisp up like I expected but my kids loved them. I like that the leftovers can be repurposed later in the week (Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Tenders, Chicken Sandwiches)

Thank you for a very good recipe!  My family enjoyed this so much.  Made it with green beans and fingerling potatoes as sides .   I enjoyed the crunchy outside with the juicy tender inside.   Happy to find a breaded chicken recipe without having to fry.  I made this as the recipe is written exactly.   Thanks again!

It didn't turn out very well. Not sure how you can get a good browning on the bread crumbs without over cooking the chicken with how thin they are. The flavor was ok. Won't make this again.

This was very good - we really enjoyed it.  I had a lot of bread crumbs and flour mixture left over, next time I'll cut back.  It would be nice if there was some sort of light gravy or sauce to accompany it.

I made this for a dinner with friends and everyone loved it. The lemon makes the chicken taste different from other chicken dishes. Moist in the inside, crunchy in the outside, simply delicious!

Yum! This is a great recipe--the lemon zest makes it truly delicious. I used planko with garlic powder instead of the breadcrumbs, but followed the rest of the recipe precisely. And it tastes even better the next day! Highly recommend.

I've been eating and making schnitzel all my life but I've never mastered the art of baking it. I used this recipe simply for the baking technique and it was perfect! The chicken was cooked through and the crumbs were toasted well. I will definitely have to use this method from now on!

Delicious, i  used lactose and gluten free oatmeal ground up fine.The oatmeal has no taste when used for breading so i added fresh rosemary and fresh basil finely chopped, along with  minced onion and garlic added to the oatmeal crumbs.
A super easy dish  and very tasty,will be making again,
Thank you for the recipe.
