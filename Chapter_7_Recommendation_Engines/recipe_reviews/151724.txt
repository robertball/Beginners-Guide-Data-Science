I was kind of skeptical, but this tasted AWESOME. Even after I replaced the sugar with Splenda, the eggs with egg whites, and the butter with butter spray.  It's really delicious and tastes nothing at all like squash!

Just make it, seriously, I had my doubts, but I gave it a shot and it was great!!!  For anyone not sure how to cook the squash, I cut it in half lengthwise, scraped out the seeds and pulp, and then placed face down on a cookie sheet and baked at 400 for 40 minutes.  I let it cool for a little bit and then I scraped out the flesh with a fork.  I had a rather large squash and got about 5 cups out of it, so you should only need 1.  If you do not cook the squash long enough, the pie may have unwanted liquid.  I will definitely make this again.

This is absolutely delicious! My teenagers ask for it all the time. They love it for breakfast! Warm or cold!
I would recommend always using the oven to bake the squash when preparing it as the pie seems to be watery if the squash is microwaved. I blend the sugar (I use less than a cup), eggs, butter, lemon juice and vanilla in a blender and pour over the squash and stir together and pour into a greased 9X9 dish and bake as recommended until a knife comes out clean. I have never used a pie crust with this recipe and we have never missed it. 
The squash seems to be a more acceptable texture to most if it is chopped up into small strands before mixing in.

Wow.  I was scared to try this pie, but I'm SO glad I did.  It was so good.  My mother in law and husband couldn't believe there wasn't any coconut in it!
It did take a bit longer to cook and when I finally pulled it out after 50 minutes (and my oven runs HOT) it still didn't allow a knife to come out clean, but it was still great.

I think I'd recommend cutting the squash up a bit.  When it's long and stringy, it's tough to cut each piece.

The whipping cream is wonderful on it -- don't skip it!!

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out.  I didn't want to make a crust or go buy one, so I made it crustless.  No problem.  I didn't want the added fat anyway.  It was a too sweet for me.  Next time I might cut the sugar in 1/2.

I was realllllyyyy nervous because I added the squash straight from the oven and it seemed to make the egg mixture go runny.  Then I thought I added too much squash (I made a mess).  BUT it turned out fine!!!!  I agree, cut up your squash, maybe drain off the liquid and let it cool after you cook.  But it's great!!!! I added 1/4 C coconut just for fun too.  Also, this only used up about 1/4 of the squash I have.

What a surprise! I was looking for something to do with spaghetti squash, found this recipe, tuned down my initial "eww..." and "uh...." reactions, tried it... and I LOVE IT! So does my husband, and his 8 year-old daughter is going to try it tonight - we'll see how she likes it :) 
TRY IT, TRY IT, TRY IT!!!

Like everyone else, I was pleasantly surprised!  I cut the sugar to 3/4C, reduced the butter to 3Tbsp and they were great.  Also, to further cut the fat and calories, I made them in cupcake tins lines with wonton wrappers from any asian grocery store.  Use the square ones, spray the pan first, and use a small glass to press the wonton wrapper into the well of the pan.  Fill with the mixture and bake only 30 min.  The swap saves almost 100 calories and they make very cute petite desserts or appetizers!

I thought this recipe was a joke - with a bunch of pre-teen kids giggling at the thought of somebody actually preparing it and serving it to their family.  But I had some spaghetti squash left over from dinner and figured, what the heck.  What do you know, it's delicious. I will definitely make this again and pass it along to my friends.  Thanks for a fun AND tasty quirky dish!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!! I just made this recipe and had a piece while it was still warm. It is absolutely yummy--strong vanilla flavor with the texture of, well, spaghetti squash (coconut). It is a yellow color, and I put some cinnamon on top--it smelled scrumptious while baking!   Definitely recommend for an easy, tasteful way to get rid of an abundance of spaghetti squash.

This was one of the greatest UNUSUAL recipes ever!!!! This turned out beautifully and I will make it over and over again. I had made this for a church dinner and had several ask for the recipe. We are hoping to try and make this recipe using maple syrup. I will post with the outcome at a later date. Just a note: Those who do not like coconut because of the texture will probably not like this pie as the texture is indicative of coconut...However, I say try it before you knock it. You may be surprised. I love this pie YUM! YUM!

This is a great idea and here are my tweaks. I used 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of sugar as well as 1/4 cup of coconut milk and coconut oil instead of butter. Used vanilla and cinnamon as well. I cut the squash in half length ways and baked it cut side down on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 until very soft. Scooped it out and processed it in a food processor with all the ingredients. I made a piecrust with almond flour and coconut oil and then just poured it in and baked for about 60 mins. I then sprinkled coconut on top and baked another 10 mins until the coconut browned.  I served it with coconut "whipping cream" ( Put two cans of coconut milk in the fridge to cool down thoroughly. Then scoop off the solid coconut  and add some maple syrup to sweeten. I used about 1 teaspoon and add 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whip it with an electric mixer until soft peaks form and serve immediately. The pie had a lovely coconut flavour from the coconut oil and milk and the sweetness was just perfect. My family could not guess what the main ingredient was and thought it was a coconut pie. This is a really good guilt free dessert.

Surprisingly yummy! I took other people's advice and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Also used lime juice instead of lemon, but I don't think it really made a difference as far as taste goes. Even with the 1/2 cup of sugar, this was still pretty sweet, so I can't imagine using the full cup! I think next time I will use 4 eggs instead of 3 because I just like it to be a little more custard-y. Definitely give this recipe a shot because you'll be pleasantly surprised!

I had an extra half of a spaghetti squash sitting in my fridge waiting to be put to use, and this was a fantastic way to do it! I found that just that half was almost a perfect 3 cups.  I made a few changes as per other reviewer's suggestions: lessened the sugar to about 1/2 cup, and cut the "spaghettis" up a bit. Also, I omitted one egg and added 1/4 cup of coconut milk instead, as well as adding about a tsp of cinnamon and leaving out the nutmeg (didn't have any at the time), and baked it in a pre-made graham crust I had accidentally bought a while ago. SO GOOD! I planned to add the whipped cream at first, but upon tasting it found it so rich that it really wasn't necessary for me. I'll definitely make it again if I ever need to get rid of some squash!

Great pie!  I made this by adding 1/4 cup dark cocoa powder and about 5 drops of peppermint oil, while omitting the lemon juice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  In effect, I changed this into Chocolate Mint Pie, but without the idea of a spaghetti squash pie, I never would have made this!

Just recently, I've started to use coconut oil, coconut flour and shredded coconut when cooking due to the health benefits of coconut. When my husband brought home 3 spaghetti squash I thought this would be a great recipe to try. I used coconut oil instead of butter,3/4 C of sugar (since so many reviewers said 1 C was too sweet) ,put a few drops of almond extract instead of the lemon juice & added some shredded coconut. I put it into a casserole dish and it came out like an egg custard. It was DELICIOUS! I will definitely make this again, but I'll decrease the sugar to 2/3 C since it was still very sweet.

This was a fun pie to make. I would have never though of using spaghetti squash for a pie! We are eating asw healthy as we can so I adapted this recipe a bit. I used splenda in place of sugar, egg whites and baked a whole wheat crust. For topping I used soy whip cream. So if you're craving a pie and want to stick to a healthy diet this just might work for you.  The texture was great. I took a previous reviewers suggestion and cut the spaghetti squash small to look more like real coconut.  Have fun!

Wow, this was surprisingly tasty!  I still can't understand why it's called "Mock Coconut" pie because it definitely had a flavor of its own which had nothing to do with coconut.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I used only 1/2 cup sugar and I can just imagine how gross it would have been if I had used the full amount.  Try this recipe, it's surprisingly good and it has this definitely unique twist!

What a crazy thing! This was so good but like most others, I was very skeptical, especially because I don't usually like squash (unless it's disguised). This was a super easy recipe to make and it tasted good too! I will definitely make it again. I only had 1 cup of squash so I just made a small batch of this (using a 3rd of everything - 1 egg, etc) and it worked fine - it was small but just for 2 people so it was fine. I also didn't have crust stuff so I put it in a dish and had it more like a casserole/pudding...I will definitely make this again but not sure if I will do the crust - it was delicious without!

Really good! I made this as per some other suggestions with 1/2 rather than 1 cup of sugar and a tsp. of coconut extract to replace the vanilla extract. I also replaced the lemon juice with the juice and zest from 1/2 of a lime. Delicious! Fine with or without the crust.

So, OK.  It really doesn't taste anything like coconut (thus the 4 stars), but if you want a custard pie with texture, this is a good substitute.  Maybe ading some coconut flavoring would help if you really are wanting coconut flavor without the coconut.  It did have a lovely subtle lemon flavor.  I served it to my hubby (who doesn't like coconut) and he thought it was great.  Next time, I'll chop the squash up much finer, maybe put it in a food processor.  All in all, I thought this was an excellent use of spaghetti squash.  I'll make it again.

A good use for leftover spaghetti squash...Not bad, not great on it's own, but would be much better with whipped cream, which I didn't have. It does not taste at all like coconut, and definitely tastes like a squash pie, so if you're looking for coconut, just make coconut!  I did follow the other reviews and used half or less of the sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  It would definitely be too, too sweet if the full amount of sugar was included.  And I have a pretty sweet tooth!

I substituted a mashed banana for part of the squash, and used Splenda instead of sugar, used a few extra pinches of the spices on top, then topped with 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Awesomely good, but too sweet, so will reduced Splenda to 2/3 cup and tried again.  One key to making this pie a nice texture is to cut up the spaghetti squash either before or after cooking and very thoroughly drain the water from the squash before and after mashing. First I used a colander, then paper towels to absorb the last of the water from the cooked squash, changing the paper repeatedly. Even then, the knife inserted when pie is done may come out moist, but otherwise clean. The filling does set up when cooled if enough water was squeezed from the squash. Mine came out great. To cook the sqaush, I put it in a glass covered cassarole with 1 2/3 cups water and cooked in the microwave on high for 10 minutes to 15 minutes, until fork-tender.  I also saved time by using Pillsbury pre-made crusts that come rolled in the refrigerator section at the grocery store. After making it this way several times, I increased the banana (substituted it for half of the squash) and used acorn squash instead of spaghetti squash. I like the taste and texture of the acorn squash with banana better. One of the most delicious pies I have ever made!

I also don't really understand why this is called "mock coconut pie" there is no coconut flavor in the ingredients. That being said I omitted the lemon and vanilla and added approx 3 TBSP of coconut flavor Da Vinci Gourmet syrup, made mine with 1/2 cup Splenda and used 2 egg whites and one whole egg. I skipped the crust and just put it in a 2qt casserole dish and baked for 40 minutes and then turned my broiler on high for an extra 5 minutes and it came out very good.Kinda like a custard/pudding. Thanx for such a great recipe idea. So creative!!!

WOW!  This pie is so yummy!  My picky kids even loved it!  I followed the recipe as stated except I only used 1/2 cup sugar and omitted the pinch of nutmeg.  The wet mixture fits nicely into one 9 inch deep dish frozen pie crust.  Next time I make this I will definitely chop the squash up into shorter strands so that the pie is easier to cut.  Also just for fun I might try it sometime with coconut extract like others suggested.  This pie doesn't need it though, I just love coconut. :)  Oh and we didn't use whipped cream because it's good enough without it.

This was surprisingly good! I gave it 4 stars because there's no way this would taste like coconut pie without the (1 teaspoon) coconut extract I added. I also left out the optional seasonings because I don't think coconut pie should have cinnamon or nutmeg...MAKE SURE YOU CHOP OF YOUR SPAGHETTI SQUASH STRANDS FIRST! Make sure the bits are pretty small and add the coconut extract. Also, HALF THE SUGAR. It was perfect sweetness with only 1/2 cup of sugar so I couldn't imagine how it would be with the full amount!

FABULOUS!  Super Simple and very tasty.  Better if the spaghetti squash is not completely done, gives the pie just a bit of crunch. This pie is a sneaky sleeper and it is worth all the effort.  Definitely my new favorite pie!

Terrific!! I added a meringue top instead of the whip cream topping. My husband and 12 year old son loved it!!  Next time I might add a little coconut or coconut extract to it to increase the coconut cream resemblance.  A definite keeper!!!!

Hubby and I are on the South Beach Diet and this recipe fit the bill for adding yet more vegetables to our daily diet while giving us something sweet. I prepared this with 3/4 cup of Splenda and it was very sweet. It may be that I'm just not used to eating sweets anymore, but I might cut the sweetener back a bit next time. This would be good as a baked custard (no crust) or with a nut crust for low-carb or Phase 1 South Beach dieters. As others suggested, be certain to cook the squash very well until it is very soft. I cooked each half of a large squash on "high" in the microwave in a covered pan with 1/4 cup of water, face up, for 12 minutes and let it stand while covered until cooled. Strain the squash after you remoe it from the skin so its not too soupy. Cut it into coconut-size pieces; I used kitchen scissors. Coconut extract was used in place of the vanilla, as others suggested. I will make this again. Thank you.

I was a little skeptical about this at first, but I had left over spaghetti squash after making another recipe on this site, and had all the other ingredients on hand.  It ended up tasting quite good! It is good either warm or cooled, however we liked it better warm.  Thanks for the interesting new recipe!

Really unusual but delicious recipe. I added a little lemon zest just to brighten the flavor and because we love lemon. My husband and my dad had seconds and would have had thirds if I hadn't removed the pie from the table! Creative way to use spaghetti squash. Take the advice of others and drain off the excess water from the squash after shredding it. Makes a big difference!

The BEST pie ever! I never in a million years would have thought this would be good but it was fantastic. The whole family loved it. 

I was really puzzled by the fact there was no coconut flavoring in this though. I gave four stars because of the changes I made. I omitted the spices (which have nothing to do with coconut cream pie) and added half a can of coconut milk to the eggs and sugar. I did use the vanilla but cut the sugar in half. It taste exactly like coconut custard! SO GOOD!

Thank you so much for this recipe!

After tasting the pies made with this recipe, I would do three things different - drain the squash before using, less sugar and add 1/2 cup of whole cream to make the base more of a custard and thus thicker and less runny. Flavor was great but the consistency of what I remembered was off and it dawned on me that milk/cream was missing.

I LOVE this pie. A dear friend gives me spaghetti squash from her garden every year,  just so I will make this pie and bring it in to work. :) I added coconut extract instead of the vanilla and sprinkled a little shredded coconut on top. I took one reviewers advice and chopped the squash into smaller "threads." I love this cold for breakfast.

I couldn't wait to try a sliver before the pie completely cooled down. OUTSTANDING flavor! I'm sure it'll taste even better once cooled and with a dollop of whipped cream. The texture of the squash was perfect (not watery at all), but I cheated by pulsing the squash in a food processor 10-12 times for about 5 seconds each time. The pulp looked fairly mashed but had that "flaked coconut" look in the pie filling. I made the squash ahead of time by piercing several times with a fork and heating in a crockpot for 2 hours at "high" setting. Once cooled the squash is easy to slice and gut. I kept in a covered plastic container in the fridge (overnight) until ready to use. Instead of butter I used coconut oil (my husband has it on hand for his Paleo recipes). Don't know if that made any difference in flavor because coconut oil has no real coconut taste. But this recipe is a WINNER in our kitchen. We will make again because we grow spaghetti squash out in our backyard garden.

Thanks for this great recipe. Easy and yummy. I made it tonight for my in-laws and they really liked it.
Just one thing, I used 3 cups of spaghetti squash and I actually had enough to make 2 pies. I made one with crust and one without the crust. To be honest it does not need the pie crust, but for sure do not miss the whipped cream.

This is a fantastic recipe. My family loved it and came back for second helpings. I will definitely be making this again. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar way down from the 2 cups suggested. I used 1/4 cup of sun crystals (which is a mix of stevia and sugar) and it was plenty sweet enough for me. I also used an almond flour crust, as  we watch our carbs. I added the optional dusting of nutmeg & cinnamon, which gave it a nice flavor. It tasted like a very nice cross between coconut pie and egg custard. My finished pie based on 8 servings worked out to less than 8 net carbs. I'm so happy I found this recipe, I will be baking it forever. Thanks a bunch.

Didn't really care for this.  I make a lot of unusual things and make wonderful zucchini cake, crisp & brownies, but this was just so-so.  The flavor was good and it smelled wonderful, but the texture wasn't good.  I even cut the squash up before adding it like others suggested.  Not a favorite.  Sorry!

This was surprisingly tasty!  A great way to get in some veggies while satisfying that sweet tooth.  I will be making this again.  Next time, I'll make sure to cut the shredded squash into short strands.  Some of them were a bit too long in the pie.  Thanks for the recipe!

My first impressions upon reading the recipe did not match the results.   This is fabulous!   Made it for picky eaters and didn't tell them there was spaghetti squash in it.  They ate it and liked it! Would defiantly make it again!

Awesome!!!  I made a double batch one in a crust and one in souffle cups--warm out of the oven tasted like vanilla custard!  Cooled with whipped cream was coconut-ish--but next time I'll toast some coconut and sprinkle it on the top!!!! I just LOVE IT!!!

REMEBER TO SHRED SPAGHETTI SQUASH!!!  I completly looked over this step... the pie tasted great ( I cut the vanilla in half and added coconut extract in for that extra edge) The texture however was like eating really sweetened spaghetti squash,, would have been similar to coconut if shredded...  We'll have to try again

Easy to make and very yummy!!!  It is a little sweet so you may want to adjust the sugar. Baked for 55 mins and still never got the "clean knife" but pulled it out and pie set just fine.  I may try so coconut extract next time as there will  be a next time...YUMMMY!

Wow - this really is good!  I only added 1/2 c sugar & that was plenty.  I also did not use a crust as suggested by another reviewer.

I made this for a potluck, and people were definitely fooled.  They couldn't believe that there was no coconut in the pie.  I thought it was pretty tasty, especially with some homemade whipped cream. I found that it took longer to cook to make the knife come out clean, but then my crust tasted burnt even after putting aluminim foil over the edges. I think next time I'll try it without the crust.

Sounds strange, tastes terrific, especially warm - a little like chess pie. I've found that the full recipe doesn't fit in my store-bought pie crusts, but maybe it's worked for others. Last time I used 2/3 of the filling recipe and added a bit extra spaghetti squash, and that left less waste. Still completely delicious! Give it a try!

Good but does not taste like coconut, although it has the look and texture.  Also too sweet for me but I'm not sure if decreasing the sugar would affect how it bakes and sets up.  I used a ready made pie crust; definitely should have used deep dish as I had about a cup too much filling.  I plan to try it again with coconut flavoring instead of the vanilla and decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup or less.

CRUSTLESS FLAN VARIATION: I poured the batter into my flan pan (no crust), and it turned out great. Mine took 1 hour to cook (not 45 minutes). I also had chopped up the spaghetti squash into small coconut-length pieces as suggested by other reviewers, and substituted the one cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of honey (I don't like sweet desserts), and added the grated rind of an organic lemon. I believe that the lemon rind gave it a nice tang.

Awesome!  you do have to let the spaghetti squash sit in a bowl after you have scraped it longitudinally out of its shell.  then pour off the water.  instead of sugar i used spenda a sugar substitute and instead of whipped cream i used Liberty coconut yogurt.. totally AWESOME!

I told my family it was a coconut pie. The only one who wasn't fooled was my daughter and that was because she saw that the squash was missing from the countertop. I was surprised at how little it tasted like squash. Only gave it 4 stars because it was too sweet. Also I think I would have liked it better if it was more custardy.There were several reviews about the squash being too watery -  For those of you who are boiling the squash to cook it - you can pierce the whole squash with a knife a few times then microwave it for about 7-10 minutes until you can push a knife easily through the outer shell. Then cut in half and scoop out the seeds. I did put the cooked squash in a dish and chopped it up some so there were no long strands.

This recipe looked so weird I just had to try it.  It is fantastic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get anyone in my family to try it once they learned it was spaghetti squash.  My vegetarian secretary and I pigged out on it at lunch.  Will defintely make again!

Loved this!  I probably could have eaten half the pie myself tonite... and I may yet!  Definitely use less sugar - it was very sweet. I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. It was delicious! It has sort of a custard-y taste. I also did not use a crust, just buttered a pie dish and it worked just fine.

What a clever way to use an abundance of spaghetti squash and get the family to eat more vegetables. I baked the squash in the oven and blended the eggs, butter, and sugar (I only used 1/2 cup) in the blender. I added coconut extract instead of vanilla and dusted the pie top with a little real coconut prior to baking. I did chop the squash to give it more of a coconut texture like one writer suggested. The taste and texture are both fantastic and I will definitely be making this again.

Made it crustless.  Tasted good enough to repeat (like others, I liked the whipped cream), but I wouldn't buy spaghetti squash just to make it.  I liked the parts that were really well done the best, as the sugar sort of carmelized.  The texture was a little strange, but I've never had coconut pie, so maybe it's a similar texture.

I was very skeptical at first, but this is really an amazing pie.  I substituted half of the sugar for splenda added half a can of coconut milk to the recipe.  I used a mixture of almond meal and graham crackers as the crust and baked it in a tart pan.  It took about 10 extra minutes but it turned out fabulous.

This is unbelievable!!  Don't let the squash ingredient fool you - it tastes sooo good!  I took it to a family gathering and everyone was shocked after eating it that Spaghetti Squash was the main ingredient.  I made it just as the recipe stated and it was incredible!  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe (except no crust) and it was just ok.  Maybe I beat my eggs too long, not sure.  Will maybe try again next time I have extra squash.

Okay, so this recipe was FANTABULOUS! Why not 5 stars?? Because imho it tastes nothing like coconut pie, nor does it have the texture of it. It could be I cooked the squash too long, but still - tastes nothing like coconut.  With that being said, it tastes soo mouthwateringly delicious! It has a unique flavor of it's own. Better than pumpkin I think. And I will make this recipe again, and serve it as Spaghetti Squash Pie. My husband loved it, and it disappeared fast at a party I took it to. Great recipe! Needs a new name though. ;-)

I adapted this recipe for mini tarts. They used about 1/3 of the recipe for 24 mini tarts in the Deluxe Mini Muffin Pan from Pampered Chef. Bake at 400 for 25 minutes. Delicious!

This is surprisingly good and a very interesting way to use up garden spaghetti squash.  I wasn't expecting to like it as well as I did.  Be sure to cut up the spaghetti squash strands into little pieces.

I tried this pie yesterday and it turned out fabulous. It's basically a custard pie. I don't like the texture of coconut , and I loved this pie. As one reviewer said, chop up the squash after it's been WELL COOKED  so it won't have that chewy texture (I oppose so much) and  it won't be stringy. DON'T BE AFRAID TO TRY IT!!!!! Don't forget the whipped cream, too.

This pie is amazing.  I made it with the Easy pie crust.  I LIGHTLY sprinkled coconut on the top and then the cinnamon & nutmeg, although I think it would be fine without the coconut.  IT IS SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  I will make this again!

I am really impressed with this recipe.  For me it didn't turn out much like a desert, but instead a sweet side dish.  Perhaps the kind of thing you'd serve at Thanksgiving.  That said, I did make some changes.  I added NO sugar.  I don't eat refined sugar and I felt like the squash I had was sweet enough.  I added about a T of maple syrup for good measure and it was quite delicious.  In addition I took a page from other reviewers and added almond extract, as I'm a glutton for it.  I'm so glad I did.  I was a really fun recipe that I'll make again and play around with different squashes and flavors.  Thanks so much!

I ate almost the whole thing by myself! I suggest changing the name...It didn't go over so well with everyone that was expecting a coconut cream pie.

Yum!  This is so good I passed the recipie on to my parents.  At first is sounds and looks kind of gross when you are putting all the ingredients together.  When you sit down to eat it...it is the best!

This tastes great - but I would definitely chop up the spaghetti squash a bit before putting it in the custard mixture.  Also it took me about 10 minutes longer in the oven than the directions call for.  But other than that its great!  I am sure it would be a good way to get kids to eat their veggies too!

I love this pie!  Made mine Weight Watcher friendly by using Splenda, lite butter, egg beaters and a Ritz cracker pie crust and it was still 'to-die-for' good.   I can't imagine what it would be with all the full fat and eggs....yummy in the tummy.   I used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  I did drain the squash really well and wrapped it in a towel and it still was a little wet (I just cooked it longer).  Maybe next time I'll try and "toast" the  squash in the oven after cooking to dry it out a little more.  Still, even a little wet, it's a delish treat.

This was delicious.  I didn't tell my husband what was in this until after he ate it- he loved it too.  I cut back the sugar like suggested, but wouldn't next time.  I would've liked more sweetness.

I adore coconut custard pie, but hate the calories and cholesterol.  I didn't have quiiite enough spaghetti squash, so I filled in the rest with coconut and I added 1/4 tdp almond extract.  It was really good.  In fact, I like the texture of the squash better and was sad that I had added coconut at all.

I was so pleased with this recipe.  Never would have come up with this myself.  I did not put it in a crust and did put in only 1/4 c. sugar and 1/4 c. Splenda.  We loved it

I took this to work and there were some skeptics in the crowd, but after tasting it everyone wanted a)the recipe and b)a spaghetti squash from my garden!  I used 3/4 cup sugar and only 2 eggs because I ran short...it was delicious, and easy to make.

I was interested in the pie as a moderately healthy dessert; and as a healthy dessert I didn't expect it to be amazing, but at least edible.  The biggest problem with this pie is the consistency of the squash.  The little strands everywhere just isn't appealing; it's like eating pie made of linguine.  If you could process the squash for a creamier consistency, this pie might get three stars.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it has received raves.  I preferred the first recipe I made which had less squash than was called for.  When I used the full three cups, it was still good, but the consistency was not as pleasing.  I also added some leftover coconut to the second time I did this pie and it was very nice.

This smelled SO GOOD while baking. It tastes pretty good, kind of like a custard pie with a crunchier texture. I will make this again. Very easy to make if you have the spaghetti squash prepared beforehand.

If I hadn't made this myself, I would have never believed that this pie was made with spaghetti squash.  It is outstanding!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Definitely a 5 star recipe!  I used the No Roll Pie Crust 1 from this site for the crust.

This was an amazing pie. I love spaghetti squash so I was willing to give it a try. I would have never imagined it to taste so good. Not at all like a squash. I will be making this one again (many times) for sure. Will be great for Thanksgiving.

I made this for my best girlfriends and told them it was spaghetti squash pie. We were all beyond skeptical. But they loved it! The funny part was they kept saying it tasted like coconut pie. So I showed them the recipe and we laughed at how accurate the name is. I think they all had a second helping. It really was that good. I was shocked.

I made this and just let my family assume it was coconut... lol It was a total hit. Even family members that do not eat squash loved it. All were surprised by how good it was. I have actually made this recipe several times.

A great (can be) low-carb seasonal recipe and unique way to add different veggies into breakfast. I replaced the sugar with 6 packets of Splenda (1 per slice) and thought it was plenty sweet.  Did not use a crust, but did everything else in the recipe as written.  We had it for breakfast with bacon.  Next time I might add cottage cheese or ricotta as an experiment. I would also suggest cooking the squash in the oven instead of microwaving to reduce moisture issues; I didn't have any.

Like many of the other cooks I was skeptical, but my husband and I both like the pie very much. I made it following the recipe but the next time I make it I am going to add coconut extract instead of the vanilla, not that I didn't like the vanilla but just to see the difference.

This mock pie is GREAT!   I cook my squash with water in the oven.  I had read one negative review so I drained my squash as much as possible before combining (and btw, three loose cups not packed - had myself a bit of a mess)  i will agree with another reviewer that it was a bit sweet - but not too sweet - I think though a drop to 3/4 sugar would fix much of that.  All that said, my son HATES spaghetti squash-after two pieces of pie we told him....lol   His reaction, "I've been betrayed!!!"    Really it was great...put me in mind somewhat of pecan pie for sweetness.

Okay, had some leftover spaghetti squash, and wanted something different. Nothing to lose. I used stevia instead of sugar, the only difference. So glad I tried this, it is definitely a win for us diabetics!

I loved this recipe but  cup of sugar was much too much for us. Tried it again with a little less than half a cup and loved it. Also shaved the butter down a bit and made it without crust. We don't skip the whipped cream, though!

I had 2 cups of leftover spaghetti squash, so adjusted ingredients accordingly. We are eating low carb(ish), so I substituted the white sugar with 1/4 cup of agave syrup. Next time I would halve that if the spaghetti squash was as sweet as this one. Also halved the butter.  I substituted the cinnamon and nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice. Next time, I would add a pinch of salt. Delicious as a dessert, but I also ate a slice in the morning for breakfast!

I made it today and love it.  It is sweet, may cut the sugar by 1/2 and I added a few drops of coconut extract.  Used a a pre made pie dough and still good.  Top it with a little whipped topping or a bit of vanilla ice cream  One other thing that might be good is to chop the squash so it isn't so stringy.  Flavor is excellent.

I love this pie! After shredding the squash, I cut the strings into small pieces which makes serving the pie easier. Our whole family loves it.

I recommend squeezing the excess water out the squash to keep your pie crust crispy. To cut the sugar, use half a cup of sugar and half a cup of Stevia. I also add a teaspoon of coconut extract.

It was a HIT!!  Everyone loved it.  It was both delicate and flavorful.  I made a couple changes...Substituted 1/3 of the butter with coconut oil.  Decreased the sugar by 1/2 and it was still plenty sweet enough.  We all agreed it tasted both like coconut and mildly like pumpkin.  It was delish and for sure one a pie I will make over and over.

Simple and delicious! Great, easy way to use spaghetti squash. Everyone loved it and it made them all excited that we had so much squash from the garden this year. I used mostly the full cup of sugar and didn't think it was too sweet. The whipped topping totally works!

I have a house full of veggie lovers who were looking forward to this and none of us enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly. The squash needs to be drained/dried, which isn't mentioned anywhere in the recipe. It was too sweet for our taste, and egg without dairy in a custard pie seemed pretty out of place here. It was mostly a sweet squashy/egg soufflé which will now be heading for the trash.

I was very skeptical at first, but I gave this a try when I didn't know what to do with a spaghetti squash. my son doesn't like the texture of coconut so I blended everything in a blender until smooth and substituted the lemon juice with orange juice because it was all I had on hand the pie was delicious and my son asked for more we will be making spaghetti pie again for sure!

I have tried spaghetti squash many different ways and this is the only way I actually liked it! If you cut the squash into small 1/4 - 1/2 inch pieces you will never know it isn't coconut. The custard has a delightful texture and taste. Even my never-eats-veggies brother was fooled and ate it up!

This recipe is amazing!  I followed it exactly. It was a little too sweet for me so the next time I am going to cut back a bit on the sugar, or maybe try Stevia. I give this recipe 5 Black Stars.  (Bowie forever)

I used a food processor to mix the ingredients, because I wasn't sure I'd like the long strands of squash. It still had a chunky quality to it that I wasn't a huge fan of, but the flavor was excellent.  Next time I may 1) roast the squash longer to soften it more, and 2) puree the squash before mixing in with the egg an sugar. Otherwise, very satisfying, tasty and well-received. Raves from the whole family, including my 4 yr old son.

I did use the full 1 cup of sugar. I didn't think it was too sweet, but it would probably have still been very good with less sugar.

I've made this many many times and it is absolutely delicious!!!  I replace my sugar with Stevia in the raw.  It tastes best after it has been refrigerated overnight.  Put a little light whip cream on top...YUMMY!!!!  I could eat the whole pie...and honestly, I probably have but no biggie...it's just squash!

Made this because I had an extra squash and everyone loved it. Kids have been eating it for breakfast,  has less sugar than cereal.  I added some shredded coconut because I had it.

Awesome.  Used 1.5 tbs. coconut extract and 1 tbs. vanilla extract.  Cutting the squash to shredded coconut size works great.  Used a graham cracker crust, will experiment with a real crust or crustless.

I've never cooked with squash before tonight. Searched through & thought this recipe seemed interesting so I made it. Turns out it tasted great and was easy to make! I made a few changes to the recipe based on some of the prior reviews. First, I used a premade graham wafer crust. Then, I like others only used half the sugar the recipe called for. I also added a small amount (1/4c?) of sweetened coconut. I also mixed the cinnamon and nutmeg in with the egg mixture. I cut the squash shreds as suggested to make the slices easier to cut. In my oven 350 degrees for 40 mins was enough. Seemed a slight bit runny when I went to cut it, but I think because it was still warm and I was too impatient to let it cool fully. A dollop of whip cream on top - YUM! I will definitely make this pie again and again!

Really good. Made no changes to recipe and it tastes very much like coconut cream pie. My kids gave it a thumbs up too. The only thing I will try next time is to cut up the squash a bit more because there is quit a bit of texture and I personally prefer less :)

This was a great inspiration for a GAPS Diet/Paleo recipe with some modifications.  I replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup of honey (and could have cut it even more, next time will try 3 Tablespoons, and then hopefully just 2 Tablespoons would be enough).  I omitted the crust entirely (crustless).  And I increased the eggs to 4 eggs (will go all the way up to 6 eggs next time).  We can't handle dairy, so used coconut oil.  This was great for dessert or stand alone breakfast (especially with increased eggs).  I could see this being a nice breakfast side dish to have with sausage.  My 9 year old child and I are on GAPS Diet.  She loved this.  My husband is not on a special diet and he loved this as well.  Definitely a win when everybody in the house likes a dish.  And we did think it resembled coconut pie.  Thanks for posting!

This was just ok. However, I did make some modifications:

1.  I did not have a crust (which probably would make it taste a million times better if I had) It had the consistency between pumpkin pie and coconut cream.  I greased a 9x9 glass pan and baked it.

2. I used 2 eggs and some coconut/almond milk

3. I used 1/4 cup sweetener and 1/4 cup sugar - still kinda had that bitter taste sweetener gives

I did cut up the squash into small pieces and let it drain for quite some time before. 

it took longer than 45mins to cook- probably closer to an hour. I did sprinkle some coconut and cinnamon on top.

I added 2/3 cup of coconut and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  didn't add the additional optional spices (nutmeg and cinnamon).  It came out great and actually tastes like coconut to the hubby doesn't know he is helping reduce the spaghetti squash bumper crop.

Yummy recipe, though to me it tastes more like egg custard. I've made this a couple of times and everyone loved it! The taste of squash is nicely hidden.

I'm giving this 2 stars because I would have given it 4 but my boyfriend would have given it a 1.  I loved the taste but struggled with the texture.  He ate one piece and wouldn't touch it.  He described this as eating a sauerkraut pie (not that it tasted like that).

I made a few modifications.  I used only 2 eggs, added in 1/2 a can (about 6 oz) of cocount milk and cut the sugar down to only 1/3 cup.  It was plenty sweet with 1/3 cup.  I also had to bake it an additional 10 minutes.

I was as surprised as everyone else, my father-in-law is not a huge fan of coconut so he was skeptical of trying it, he still had a problem because the consistency is so close that he struggled swallowing it. I agree that maybe if you chop it up a little it won't be so stringy. He still said the taste is great and took another piece for the road LOL. I will be making this again and sharing with many. I love dishes like this, thanks for sharing!

love it. Next time though I will cut the sugar 1/2. It was a little sweeter then I like. I made the whip topping myself but instead of adding sugar to the whipped heavy cream I added "Dickenson's Creme Coconut curd" it made the dish extra special.

Tasted okay, but was looking for that "coconut" flavor and texture.  Didn't have either, but wasn't bad- heck, it had eggs, sugar and vanilla- can't taste too bad!  Don't think I'll make it again though.

Mock Coconut Pie? Not sure if this was supposed to actually  taste like a coconut pie or just look like one, because it really tasted like a stringy kind of pumpkin pie. It tasted fine, but not really what I was expecting.

Oh my this is soooo good.  I did change one thing... instead of vanilla I used coconut extract.  It's addictive... I ate almost half a pie in one sitting.  I did notice that instead of only making one 9 inch there was enough filling to fill 2 - 9 inch shells right to the top.  Which was a good thing seeing as I ate as much as I did lol.  If I hadn't been the one to make the pie I would never have known that there was spaghetti squash in there.  Over all I will be making this again ... this time to share with my friends and family.

Maybe I'd feel differently if I didn't realize what was in this pie, but to me it just tasted like spaghetti squash pie. Not that it was bad, just not something to get excited about.

This pie definitely was better than I thought a spaghetti squash pie would be! However, the taste is bland and the texture is so-so. It was well liked, but not good enough for second helpings! Next time, I will add cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling, so that it is flavored like a pumpkin pie. I think that this would make a significant improvement to the taste. Also, it made enough for two 8" pies, and I cooked them for a full hour. The whipped cream is a MUST! Definitely worth trying, but don't expect it to beat Grandma's pumpkin pie!

I really had high hopes for this, but I was disappointed. I love spaghetti squash and thought this would be an interesting new way to eat it. I baked my squash in the oven and followed the recipe exactly. But it was somewhat dry and more like a sweet quiche texture than a creamy coconut pie. Maybe I'll try it again and add another egg and some cream to up the creaminess.

I didn't think this pie tasted anything like coconut, but it had a tasty sweet flavor to it.  I used 1/3 C each of white sugar, brown sugar & splenda.  I used 4 egg whites and a pre-made graham pie crust.  I don't know that I'd make again, because I find the texture weird for a sweet dessert, but I'd consider using the pie filling mixture as it's own side dish as part of a dinner.

First of all, I did not bake my pieshell first.  It is FINE to used an UNbaked pie shell.   But, I was not impressed with the flavor of this pie at all.  I followed the recipe, but used a little less sugar, but even so, it was still very sweet.

This pie was . . . interesting.  The flavor tasted like my grandmother's buttermilk pie.  Every now and then I would get a weird squash flavor though that just didn't quite match with it being a sweet dessert.  I don't regret trying it but probably will not make again unless I have an abundance of spaghetti squash for some reason.

I don't know what I was expecting, I love squash of any kind and love coconut, this just didn't do it for me. I boiled the squash and wonder if it was a texture thing that bothered me? Used less sugar and that was fine. My mom also made this recipe and loved it. Maybe I'll have to have her make it for me!

I liked this however my hubby did not.  It also did not taste like a coconut pie. The custard for lack of a better word was excellent, but the squash just didn't go over well. I think the texture was what my husband did not like.  The taste was good and it is a unique way to get veggie haters to eat them.  I followed this recipe as directed.

This was more coarse and dry than I was expecting.  I omitted the spices and used Splenda, but maybe should have added some coconut extract and cream to the batter.  Next time I will cook the squash TO DEATH!  This is a spaghetti squash pie, not a mock coconut pie!
