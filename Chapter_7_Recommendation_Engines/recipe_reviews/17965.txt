i am the mom of seven boys...i made these cupcakes making half with blueberry pie filling and the others with strawberry pie filling...they were gone within an hour.  my one son had some teenage friends over and they ate them all !  i never had a chance to icing them...but they were delicious !  i am making more this morning to take to a friends house for lunch today...i am sure we won't have any left over ! my only advice...when doing the pie crust don't make it too thin.  i didn't lay the pie crust all the way to the edge.  the batter filled it up fine.  also, not too much filling on the bottom (i used pie filling) it will be too heavy when you take them out and tear.  i kept mine in the frig over night and they were perfect.  you will love these...many alterations with fillings.

I think that these are awesome and I am having fun dreaming up different variations. For example, today I used canned apple pie filling (I pulsed it in my food processor a couple of times to make small apple pieces) and spice cake mix. Then before baking, I topped them with a "french apple pie" topping consisting of 1 cup flour, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and a handful of chopped pecans (I had a lot left over, I just froze it for later use). Baked them up, cooled them, and dusted them with powdered sugar. Now I have French Apple Pie-Cakes! Yummy!

You know, I was not sure what to expect with these little cupcakes when I read the recipe, but I’m always looking for interesting treats to share with my department at work so thought I’d give it a shot.  These are marvelous. When making them, be sure to really grease each cupcake cup before inserting the pie crust and other ingredients.  Some of the preserves bubbled over on a couple of mine and it was very difficult to remove the cakes intact.  No worries though, the damaged ones tasted just as good!  I used white cake mix (added extra vanilla) but really any cake mix, boxed or homemade, will work just fine.  Because I was under some time constraints I topped my cakes with canned butter cream frosting but these really need something a little more special.  Next time I will take the extra effort and top them off with a really good, fluffy frosting. These were a hit with my co-workers (one asked for the recipe and made them for his son’s birthday party) and a hit at home.  The creative possibilities with this recipe are endless so I’ll be sure to make them again and again.

These cupcakes turned out great! They were a hit with my entire family. With the pie crust and the cake mix, you get the best of both worlds. I didn't frost them in any way, and personally I thought they were best like that. I used rasberry preserves, but I would certainly like to try other fruits. Also, the pie crust is a sturdy base, keeping the filling from falling out, just be sure to make it thick enough! This recipe was simple and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  I served it at a graduation party and was asked for the recipe.  I topped it with a white chocolate buttercream frosting.  Delicious!

Absolutely sinfully delish!  I had some trouble with the crust, but I've never rocked the pie thing.  Agree with another post to keep the dough not too thin.  I made it with Lemon Cake and canned Raspberries....great combo of snarky flavor!  The best ones were the mini-muffins, bite sized for easy handling.

I made these with homemade pastry, raspberry jam, one bowl chocolate cake and then ganache on the top.  Garnished with a fresh raspberry.  They were to die for.  Everyone loved them.

Excellent.  Very different from a typical cupcake -- a bit more sophisticated.  I use pie filling, which keeps it from being overly sweet, and a buttercream frosting.  I always get rave reviews when I make these.

Wow! These are awesome. I ended up with 24 regular sized and 12 mini from just one recipe. I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe instead of a box and used a chocolate ganache icing recipe from this site for the top. The only issue I had was that the crust did not brown well on the regular sized cakes. Maybe my pans? Maybe next time I'll bake the crust quickly before I add the jam and batter. I agree that these could be a lot of fun to get creative with. Thanks for sharing!

These were GREAT!  I wanted them to be bite-sized, so I used mini-muffin tins... and since I only had 2 tins (made 48 mini chesscakes), I still had enough leftover ingredients to make 4 regular-sized chesscakes.  I used raspberry pie filling instead of raspberry jam and it worked great.  I can't wait to experiment and make different flavors next time!  I served these for a party and they were a hit.

This a thing that has always been around in my family all my life but we tart shells instead and it tends to stand up easier and we call them jamcakes  yum yum makes me want to make them.

I made these with lemon cake mix and raspberry jam. I planned to frost them with lemon cream cheese frosting. After reading all the reviews, I was eager to try them. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the outcome. The crust was soggy and they just didn't taste good. I did not bother to frost them.

I wanted to try this recipe because many of my 23 grandchildren have been asking me to teach them to cook. So I made a "trial" batch alone first. Mine came out perfect with spice cake and apricot filling. Because pie crust by scratch can be challenging, I decided to use refrigerated pie dough that you roll out so their first attempts would be easier. I had five of the girls try theirs first and then four of the boys, each choosing flavor options  They all came out perfect and each had a great time. I think my favorite combination was the chocolate cake with hot fudge filling and buttered toasted nuts on top. This was so easy to make and scrumptious that all I had to really do was sit back and wait for my tastes of each :o)

Fantastic!  I used sugar free raspberry jam & I didn't put pie crust all the way up the muffin pan.  I only put a bottom layer of pie crust, jam, cake batter.  This recipe is versatile and can be adapted for whatever you want it to be.  Delicious!

Turned out more pretty than I anticipated.  Taste OK, not really like the top part (not very moist & fluffy like Angel cake), next time I will try yellow mix or other butter cake recipe & maybe strawberry preserve)

I made these for a graduation party, and they flew off the dessert table.  The chocolate cake/raspberry/ganache version was the first to go, however I preferred the white cake/strawberry/cr.cheese frosting variety myself.  This is a great recipe with many possibilities!  Have fun with it!

Made this for a potluck, at work.  None, leftover.  It was a hit.  I had used 2 different type of preserves, and topped with frosting.

I didin't have a round cookie cutter, so I just used one of my drinking cup, that did the job. 

Thank you, adding this one to my recipe bool.

Very easy to make and a complete hit every time I bring them to gatherings.  I have tried different combinations of cake mix and preserves and they all turn out good.  Frost with a cream cheese frosting...yummy!

Excellent! Cute! Quick! Delish! I made these using a mini-cupcake type pan from Wilton,  that has 24 minicakes in it.  The recipe made 2 of these sheets for a total of 48 pieces. I used the vanilla/Rasp. jam and a Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust that  you just open and unroll.  I also sprayed the pan well.  They came out easy and the kids loved them. Great finger food that looks like it took a lot of time, but it was so quick! Thanks for the recipe!

I loved these...and loved making them. It is much easier than it looks. I also tried orange marmalade and it was fantastic. To know the difference between each of the cakes I put either a little orange zest or raspberry colored crystals on the top right after taking them out of the oven. Everyone enjoyed!
