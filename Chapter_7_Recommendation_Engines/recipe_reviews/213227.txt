sure looked like a winner, but it had 2 major problems that made it not work.  6 tablespoons oil in the sauce made it greasy, and the sauce wasn't thick enough to stick to the foods.  sorry, but i couldn't finish my serving, and for me, that says a lot.

The sauce in this recipe has great flavor, we made it last night.  I have to agree with Jenny however, it definitely does not need 6 tablespoons of vegetable oil.  We used three and it was plenty.  

We didn't have linguine pasta, so we used rice noodles.  They work well.  

I made another batch of the sauce after as well and added peanut butter.  Very good results.  

Thanks for the recipe. I will use it a lot.

I thought this was a great way to use tofu. I didn't have that much soy sauce so I subbed teriyaki!! I used the rooster hot sauce in place of the thai chili sauce and shredded cabbage in place of the bean sprouts ( the bean sprouts were super brown at the store and didn't look good at all). I didn't shred my carrots just super finely diced them. I really liked this!!

Not sure what Jenny did because we loved this.  Next time we are going to add peanut flavor either with peanut butter or chopped peanuts or both.  Delicious!

Good flavor, but very greasy.  I tossed in defrosted stir fry veggies instead of those listed here, so it was very easy to make.  I'm going to use the same basic ingredients (with the oil halved) and the instructions from a different recipe next time, I think.

This is a good recipe.  For people who are complaining that it's too greasy, you can certainly use less oil and it shouldn't be a problem.  Also, if you have a problem with the sauce not sticking or being too thin, you can add a little COLD water to a little bit of corn or potato starch in a separate small ball until dissolved and add that right before you turn off the heat to thicken the sauce.  You can also add arrowroot directly into the sauce to thicken the sauce before you finish cooking/turning off the heat.

We liked it. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the oil down to 3 tbs. in the sauce (I used peanut oil); also added chunky peanut butter. I used leeks instead of green onions, and added large shitake mushrooms (because I had them). Very tasty!

My husband lets the tofu simmer in the sauce to make the tofu firmer & we put it over brown rice. We usually leave all the veggies out too. If anyone is a fan of szechuan tofu or sweet and sour tofu or anything sweet then you will like this!

I'm glad I read the reviews before I attempted this. I followed the recipe for the most part but I used only about 1 to 1.5 TBS of oil. I also used 10 cloves of garlic (because I looove garlic) and also put about half of cup of white onions in it when I browned the garlic. I didn't have thai chili sauce so I used korean hot chili oil instead (prob very similiar). 

When I was stir frying the veggies I put a little more sesame oil in it and also put maybe half a TBS of more hot chili oil when I added the noodles(I like my food spicy!). 

I also used udon noodles instead of linguine. 

I bought a pack of precooked udon noodles at the korean supermarket. I put in a bowl of warm water and let it sit (the noodles will seperate). Drain it and then put in the hot pan (or wok if you have one) with the sauted veggies and about 1/4 cup of water. 

The sauce was awesome, thanks!

I used sesame oil and agree with the other reviews that there is too much in the original recipe (I would use about 1/2).  I also think there is too much vinegar so would 1/2 that as well.  Because the vinegar was too strong I ended up doubling the sauce which ended up being the perfect amount with a package of bean threads which I used instead of the noodles.  I also like things hotter so doubled the amount of chili sauce.

Alright.   Subtle flavor.  I thought it was too sweet.  I would also add more garlic and some crushed red chili for some kick.  Great with Ramen noodles!

I used around 13 oz of noodles instead and that is perhaps why I didn't find it too greasy. I would agree though that the amount of oil can be reduced. Overall a comfort food for me for sure and a great way to use tofu.

This was good; however, I should preface this review with I began making a tofu w/ veggies in a peanut sauce- different recipe but didn't realize I had no peanut butter. I used this sauce as a last minute fill-in. Will make definitely make again!

of course, i made a few changes.  awesome husband and i don't eat tofu.  also, i have found this great frozen bag of veggies that includes just a bit of pasta.  it's got broccoli, red peppers, carrots, water chestnuts, string beans, and onion.  i scaled this back to 2 servings and followed step 1 exactly, up to stirring in the tofu.  then i heated the sesame oil in the pan and added my frozen veg, cooking for about 6 minutes.  then i added the sauce back in and cooked over medium for about two minutes, stirring and folding the sauce in.  i decided to top with some regular and black sesame seeds because i have a ton of them and want to use them up.  we thought this was delicious! definitely will be added to our rotation.

I used far less oil, but this was really yummy.  I used carrots, red peppers, and shelled edamame for my veggies along with the tofu of course.

Great taste, so easy to put together! I agree, it doesn't need 6 Tbs of oil and while sauce was simmering, I added fresh ginger just because I love ginger and it's healthy. I just ate it without noodles.  Next time I think I will just add more vegetables and have with a small amount of brown rice.  Not much of a fan of noodles.  Thanks for the recipe, it's one of my favorites!

Definently half the oil. It wasn't bad though, would probably be better with a peanut flavor as the soy sauce (and I used low sodium) is a little over powering also. Still edible just needs a tweak or two.

Overall a great recipe. First off, I took the advise of other reviewers and did not use 6 tbsp of oil. Also, for the tofu, here's my suggestion from my "hippy" days as a vegetarian :)Take your tofu and wrap it up in paper towels or cheese cloth and place a pan (or anything heavy) on top. This will push out all the water. Leave it for about 30 minutes or so...it will shrink some. Get your rice vinegar/soy sauce/honey/chili sauce mixture ready. Then Soak the tofu in your mixture for another 30 minutes. I recommend this to give the tofu even more flavor! I couldn't find bean sprouts at the store so I used sliced mushrooms instead; I also added some spinach for some extra leafy-ness. I also used a TON of soy sauce and a bit of teriyaki sauce when I was cooking the veggies. I can't eat a lot of pasta (gastric bypass) so I left out the lingune on my plate and had mine with just tofu and veggies (my partner had the linguine in his and he LOVED IT!)Very delicious....we will be making this again!

7 3 17 I changed just a little, not enough to be an unfair review.   'Didn't "do it" for us.  I'm the only one eating leftovers - more out of not wasting it/money than enjoying it; okay, I also don't want to make something new.  :D

I made it with half of the vegetable oil, as directed by some of the reviewers.  I used sriracha sauce instead of thai chili paste, which I did not have.  I also used vermicelli noodles instead of linguine.

I absolutely love this dish.  I think next time I will add some crushed peanuts.

Made this tonight for Chinese New Year...Year of the Red Monkey!  We liked it...4.5 stars.  I did add broccoli and made my own sesame oil.  Also used lo mien noodles instead of linguine.  Oh, because we like spicy, I added red pepper flakes and topped with crunchy peanuts.

The flavor was "almost right"...but way too much liquid still wouldn't cook away. Everything was "swimming" in the sauce. This recipe needs altering. I followed the directions step by step. I made no changes until the end because it was NOT presentable. Good luck if you want to try this recipe!

Don't you just hate it when a reviewer takes a recipe and changes it and then reviews it anyway? Yeah, I did that. I steamed the tofu first. Tofu can carry bacteria just like meat. Who knows whether the people that helped package it used gloves? I just placed it in the top thing of my rice cooker while I steamed some brown rice for this. No honey. No noodles. Frozen stir fry veggies. I also thickened the sauce in the end with a tad bit of cornstarch in water. The sauce is YUMMY! :)

I just made this tonight and it was a hit. After reading the reviews, I used 4 tbs of vegetable oil instead of six and substituted peanut oil for sesame oil. The sauce was a bit thin, but I didn't mind that. Good recipe. Easy. (I'm a novice!!)
