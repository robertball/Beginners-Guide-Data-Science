The frosting was delicious!  The cake was OK.  I followed the recipe to a T---But, we thought it had a funny after taste.  I will try another red velvet  cake recipe next time.

I have the original Waldorf Astoria cake recipe from the 1960's that the customer originally paid $500 for.  I applaude changes to this one. Original had 2 2oz bottles of red food color....a little too much. Original frosting contained canned Crisco...and was way too difficult for a commoner like me to make...so I changed to Cream cheese icing but I will try this one.  Thanks for the changes...looks like they are all for the good of the finished cake.  Applause, applause, applause!!!
