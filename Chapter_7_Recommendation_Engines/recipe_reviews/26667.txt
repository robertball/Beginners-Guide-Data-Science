I made this recipe but i changed a few things to make it to our family's taste.  First of all I added yellow corn chips on the bottom like the recipe call for.  Then for the ground beef I added two med sized cans of green peppers.  I did not put sour cream in with the ground beef.  I layered as follows: chips, ground beef, (2 cans) black beans, (1 large jar)pace chuncky salsa and mexican blend cheese.  I repeated all the layers one more time.  My husband said that it was a killer dish and he means that in a good way so I am making this again with my additions.  Thanks for the recipe

HUGE hit with the family.  I had it in my head to make this for supper when I realized I didn't have a taco seasoning packet, nor did I have a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I opted to use spices from my rack:  cayenne pepper, seasoning salt, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and italian seasoning.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.  Due to many reviews saying the dish comes out dry, I used 1 1/3 cup salsa and 2/3 cup water in addition to the 1 cup sour cream.  I also added some diced black olives to the meat mixture before layering.  A wonderfully yummy, mildy spicy enchilada tasting casserole.  I have no doubt that if I had followed the recipe to a T (had I had the right ingredients) it would have turned out just as great.

Good basic recipe to work from. Added fresh onion, corn & garlic. Added chiles rather than the ones mixed in with the tomatoes. This added the much needed moisture. On top in the melting cheese, I added sliced olives and green onions. Increased cooking time to 30 minutes. The family loved it. Thanks for a great starter recipe.

I made this recipe thinking my kids would love it.  After all it was like a taco.  However, it was not so.  I do have one very picky eater and he was just not into it.  Personally, it was just OK for me.  I made the recipe exactly as was listed, but it just wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  The chips were soggy and soaked up all the liquid which made the whole thing a little dry.  I think it needs more meat and more cheese.

I threw this together because plain ol' tacos sounded kinda boring.  Turns out, it was a good move!  It was a big hit at my house, made evident by the fact that it didn't last very long at all!

The was EASY to throw together and my family LOVED it!!! It has just a little zing from the chili's, and that perks up the whole dish. It's very filling and kind of fun to eat. We now eat this fairly often, and it's the "last dinner" mean my kids request before leaving on vacations in summer!

very good recipe-we changed it up a bit by not adding the tortilla chips until serving the beef mixture- it made it crunchy so my kids would eat it and still had a very nice taste to it!

My husband is a very picky eater so I invited my parents over so I wouldn't have left overs. there was barely enough of this stuff to go around  everyone had at least 2 huge helpings.  My husband even said I wasn't allowed to have anyone over when we ate it!  Definatly making again!

Everyone liked this.  I was afraid to use the diced tomatoes with mild green chiles, but I did, and it was very good. My children also always have green olives on their tacos, so I added green olives to the mixture.

I thought this was pretty good, there are a few things I would change.

I would not use tortilla chips on the bottom the next time. I used them this time and by the time the dish had baked, they were soggy and blah. I did use some medium tortillas after layer one and those did not get as soggy as the chips. I still felt like I needed something crunchy so we crumbled tortilla chips on top of the bake.  I also used a large jar of mild salsa and a can of diced tomatoes (slightly drained) which helped it not dry out. A good recipe for family dinners but if you get home later from work like I do, cook the meat mixture the night before and it saves a bunch of time.

This was a great recipe! I used 1pkg of taco seasoned ground turkey instead. I also sauteed about a half an onion and 4cloves of garlic along with a can of corn and a can of beans and diced up fresh tomato for the juice.and because i AM hispanic, i added some hot sauce!
This really is a keeper. quick and easy. Kids LOVED it. THANX!

I only had 1 lb ground beef. Used half the tomatoes/chilles and kept everything else the same. Baked in 8x8 pan instead of 13x9 and 15 mins instead of 20. Only... I forgot the layers of chips after I did my first layer, but it still turned out very yummy!  We just added chips after it was done. Used corn chips. Would recommend!

Used a can of rinsed black beans and some fresh corn instead of meat.  Also used 1 1/2 c. salsa instead of tomatoes.  Used two flour tortillas for the bottom layer and crushed tortilla chips for the second layer.  Fast, easy and very good.

This recipe is so great! I was a little skeptical of the sour cream but I loved it! I did improvise a little....used our favorite salsa instead of canned tomatoes and added corn and black beans.  Overall, outstanding! i will be making this again!

We thought this was very good even though I used ground turkey, fat free sour cream, low fat cheese, and Mrs. Dash taco seasoning because I have to watch my sodium/fat intake.  It still turned out very tasty. Also substituted the Rotel with a can of no salt added diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilies.  And instead of the tortilla chips, I layered with regular corn tortillas (because I didn't have any chips on hand) which made it kind of a Mexican lasagna.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add some chips on top for some crunch.  Topped with salsa and avocado and served with a side salad with Catalina dressing. Sorry to rate the recipe with the changes I made, I try not to do that, but thought other people with fat/sodium issues who try to eat healthier might want to know you can do it healthier without sacrificing taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was soooo disappointed.  The name "Taco Bake" made me think this was more of a casserole type of meal.  This is just nachos baked in a 9x13 pan.  The chips get soggy.  It's a waste if you have leftovers because they would taste terrible.  The meat mixture is okay, but the idea of layering all this is unappealing.  Just make nachos on a cookie sheet if you're thinking of making this recipe.

Fantastic recipe and super easy to make! I made a couple changes as I was worried it'd be too runny and make the chips soggy. I browned the meat, added the taco seasoning, 2/3 water, diced tomato & peppers, italian bread crumbs (for consistency) and when I put the sour cream in, it was perfect. Not too runny, not too dry looking. Also added chili powder, garlic powder and cacher's seasoning. When I layered, I put chips, balsamic rice with fajita seasoning in it, meat mixture and cheese. The rice kept the meat mixture off the chips and they were crunchy and crispy for the most part. It tasted Fantastic! Thank you for this recipe!

Very tasty, but a bit dry, & not too kid friendly. I added some corn, black olives & a few jalapenos to taste. Since I read about the mushy chips, I decided to try a base layer of chips, with only 1/2 the meat mixture and 1/2 the cheese and then broiled it for a few minutes until cheese bubbled and chips were lightly browned. Then I took it back out and repeated the process and the chips came out just fine. The whole dish did come out a bit dry for my liking, so I simply served it with a side of salsa and it was great. Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight and I really liked it.  I used tortilla chips, not corn, and they turned mushy (it was all I had on hand).  I took the advice of others and added a little extra water to prevent it from becoming too dry.  Before I added the cheese I added some extra salsa to the meat layer.  It was super easy and really yummy!

Thanks for sharing this speedy, economical and tasty recipe!  If my very picky sister eats something you KNOW it's good!  My husband said "Dinner was amazing!"  I did modify the recipe to use what we had on hand...marble cheese, 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes with herbs and spices (undrained), 1 pound ground beef.  Omitted water because of the tomato juice.  Been craving heat so I added a VERY generous amount of crushed red pepper flakes and fresh black pepper.  Simply a great simple dinner idea.  Definitely serve with a dollop of sour cream, salsa, additional cheese and maybe shredded lettuce.  Oh, and although I used store brand tortilla chips (just as good as the brand name ones I think) I did serve this with a handful of Doritos Cool Ranch on the side, just to change up the flavor a bit.  I will be making this at least once a month--when the pantry stock is low or when I don't have the time (or desire) to prep a big meal.  I was going to add onions because my husband is an onion addict and normally mentions that "this would be excellent with onions" but I didn't and I must say it was nice not to have them for a change.  :)

This recipe was a hit!  I used mozzarella cheese because that's all I had, and since reviews mentioned it cooked up a little dry, I didn't drain the tomatoes.  It turned out great!  I might add onions next time.

This was good.  Very easy to prepare so a great weeknight meal.  Next time I'll only put the tortilla chips on top because I wasn't loving how soggy they got on the bottom and middle layers.

I have been looking for another recipe for a taco casserole, one that doesn't require a pie crust, this one is very good.  I made a few changes, only half drained the tomatoes so I didn't need the water and added some refried beans and fresh tomatoes and black olives.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe, in it's self was fairly plain but good. To make it a heartier meal my family would enjoy, I added beans, onions, jalapenos, hot sauce, olives & rice. It was absolutely great with the additions but now where near the same recipe.

I upped the beef to 2 pounds and sour cream to 2 cups.  I also added 1 tablespoon of cumin, green onion and cilantro.  It is very tasty.

This was great, I had to change it up a bit because I didn't have the ingredients it called for. Inplace of the Sour Cream I added 2/3 cup of heavy cream and 3 Tablespoons of Cream Cheese. Then instead of the tomatoes with green chilies I just used green chillies and a can of southwestern style corn (with black beans, onions, and red peppers). Then in between the layers I added some sliced black olives. Thank you for this dish my family devoured it!

This was simple, used things I normally keep in the pantry, and tasted good too. I added the sour cream after the filling simmered. I did add a little garlic and some cumin to the meat as it was cooking and some roasted Hatch chile pepper that I shaved off the chunk of frozen peppers. I used an American/Cheddar cheese blend since it is what I had. I liked the top layer the best as the chips were still crunchy, but I really didn't care for the soggy corn tortilla layer beneath. I could have used plain corn tortillas for that and saved my good chips. Overall, this is a good filling recipe and while it wasn't outstanding, it was a nice comfort meal on a cold winter day.

This recipe was DEEElicious!  It won the approval of my entire family, which is no small feat!  I followed the recipe except for the following:  I only had one pound of ground beef, and I added one can of Cream of Mushroom soup to cut the spicy-ness.  I put a little dollop of sour cream on top and served it with a green salad and some dessert, and it was PERFECT!  The recipe is now going to be in a permanent spot in my recipe book and will be used for church potlucks as well as for a regular meal in our family home.

I have tried several different recipes for Taco Bake when I found this one.  My family loved it!  Even the kids, and you know how picky they can be.  The only thing that I changed was that I had some salsa and put a layer of salsa on the first layer.  Next time, I am going to use the smaller tortilla chips because it was a little hard to cut through the bottom tortillas.  I also put an extra layer of sour cream on the layers.  This is the recipe that I will keep though.  It was a huge hit!

Very Good and SO easy to make.  I used a mix of Pepper Jack and Cheddar Cheese on the top and used a small can of V8 spicy to replace the water.  NOT dry at all!!  I think next time I will leave out the layer of chips as they got very soggy.  I will just have them on the side.  Overall a super recipe for a quick and easy meal ~ Thanks!!

Overall, the entire family LOVED this recipe. I did make a few adjustments though. I added a 5.5 oz can of tomato juice in place of the 1/2 cup of water. It wasn't dry at all, as others mentioned theirs often were. I also added 1/2 inch cubes of Velveeta to the final top layer. It was just enough! Once cooked, we garnished it with a layer of sour cream, black olives, tomatoes, and mixed greens. As my 6 year old said, "YUMMY!"

This was very good and easy to make BUT if you plan on leftovers, the chips on the bottom do not reheat well at all.  You'll either need to remove them prior to reheating or not add them into the baking dish at all.  Just cook up the mixture without and dish it over a plat of chips.

I tried this recipe before it was excellent. This time I decide to try adding and a layer of chips after the meat & cheese layer and needless to say it was definitely not the way to go. The original recipe is perfect the way it is!!!!!! Lol

Came across this recipe looking for something new to make with ground beef. Made a few changes (some based on other reviews) and it came out amazing!! I did not use water in this recipe - instead used about 4 oz of tomato sauce and a jar of salsa. I also added onion, chili powder, and crushed red pepper to the hamburger mixture. I didn't layer with chips as I really didn't want soggy chips in my recipe like others had mentioned. Instead, I made my own simple "Mexican-y rice" (instant rice made in chicken broth, add tomato sauce, taco seasoning, chili powder, crushed red pepper) Spray-greased a 9x13 pan, rice on bottom, followed by hamburger mixture, then shredded colby-jack cheese on top. Covered & baked. Crunched tortilla chips on top and baked another 5 minutes. SO YUMMY. Next time I will add olives! :D

My son and I liked it, but my wife didn't care for it. I think she caught a little too much of the taco seasoning or a particularly spicy chile (I like spicy, bold flavors, she's got a much tamer palate). 

If anything, I'd say the flavor is a little one-dimensional. Swapping out the tortilla chips for a cornbread crust may do the trick.

I poured the can of tomatoes along with the liquid and it still seemed a little dry. I think I will add sour cream after its done next time.

This is a good recipe. If your looking to fill the casserole dish I would suggest to double the meat, sour cream, tomatoes and taco seasoning. I would not suggest changing anything else.

I am making this as we speak. I have made similar recipes, omitting the taco chips and the tortillas since my husband doesn't like the soggy additions....So, I added while cooking on the stove; onions, 1/2 can peeled tomatoes that I cut into quarters, celery, chopped garlic. I then added black olives, tomatoes with juice (instead of water) sour cream and black olives and placed in a rectangular baking dish. I also added cheddar cheese on top with more sliced black olives. I am making this with a side of jasmine rice. It smells great!
I added onion and black pepper, taco seasoning and Italian seasoning for spices, also added a splash of Louisiana Hot Sauce for zing. Thanks!

I'm a dad and I make dinner once a week. I've added this to my handful of things I make. I took all the tips from other reviews and I have something everyone likes. Added a can of corn, can of black beans, and a can of black olives. I usually double the recipe and use a can of tomatoes or fresh ones from the garden plus a jar of salsa. We use ground turkey instead of beef. I like to top it off with semi crushed chips sprinkled with cheese and some fresh tomato and black olives for presentation. The chips on the bottom get really soggy, so the fresh chips on top add a nice crunch to this dish. Enjoy!

NO SOGGY BOTTOM! I added chopped onions, salsa, chopped fresh tomatoes (not a whole lot) & taco seasoning to ground turkey.  I also added a small amount of sour cream which made the mixture a little creamier.  Following the advice of a previous reviewer I used a pack of boil in the bag brown rice and added taco seasoning to that also. I layered the bottom with crushed corn tortilla chips, the rice, re-fried beans, then the meat mixture, then cheese & repeated-2 layers in total. It wasn't in the oven for very long and I was pleased to hear the crunch on the bottom when I put my serving spoon in. It was a tad bit dry so I may add more sour cream to the meat mixture and not completely drain the rice when I make it again.  I will definitely be making this again!  Only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I'm not sure if this would be considered a COMPLETE meal-maybe add corn on the side?? I still love it though.

Am I the only one who had a soggy layer of mushy chips on the bottom? Everyone in my family complained about it. I followed the instructions exactly except substituted salsa for the tomatoes with chilies. I even used lean ground sirloin. It had a good flavor, but mush on the bottom.

I made some changes to this recipe.. but i used it as a base.  I used 90% lean ground beef, added onion, 3 cloves garlic, green bell pepper, fresh diced tomatoes, red kidney beans, black beans, and taco seasoning.  I layered the meat mixture, shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese and tortillas ending with cheese on top in a 9x13 pan. Served with sour cream, salsa, and tortilla chips on the side.  I knew it was a hit when they went back for 3rds.

Was very good.  I changed it a bit to what I had on hand.  I used a can of enchilada sauce and a bit more water.  I added a little cumin, mexican oregano, and chili powder.  It was great and it will satisfy my cravings for mexican.  I served with salsa and sour cream.  I would have added shredded lettuce to the plate too, but didn't have any.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! We were craving tacos but didn't have taco shells or tortillas, his dish satisfied the craving! I scaled it down to fit an 8x8 dish since it's just the two of us. Other than that the only thing I changed was I forgot to put in the sour cream so I just served it with a dollop on tops and garnished with sliced green onions. Will definately become a regular in the menu rotation!

This was just ok, a bit dry.  We chose to use Frito's but 18 oz. is way too much, a regular sized bag is 9 3/4 oz.  The sour cream seemed to get "lost" in the mix and had to add more while eating it to get some moisture along with some iceburg lettuce and taco sauce.

This was very good - totally satisfied my craving for Mexican food. Mine turned out like glorified nachos, however. I made about a quarter recipe, using approx. 4 oz of meat, and also used restaurant-style tortilla chips. Guacamole on the side is a must!

Well, overall, the recipe sure has potential.  I found a couple things wrong with it.  There were WAY too many chips.  And, the 20 minute cook time was a little too long.  But, with a few tweaks, I think it could be really good.

My husband adores this recipe - he requests it! I make it differently every time; I've added black refried beans and salsa to the mix, or corn. I've tried leaving out the sour cream, which was good. Once I added strips of steak (husband's favorite).  I always cook the meat in onions and coconut oil (best for cooking), and top with Tapatio sauce, avocado, and more sour cream. This recipe (8 servings) makes plenty for us to have dinner and several lunches as well - good stuff!

This was a hit with the family!  Thanks for the great recipe!  We topped ours with sour cream, salsa, diced onion, black olives and diced tomatoes... YUM!  I think it would be even tastier if you added beans to the meat mixture, but we haven't tried it that way yet...

This was simple to make, yet yielded a great result. I made some changes (and didn't measure) by using salsa, frozen corn and a can black beans.  I thought it was going to be drippy when baked - but the chips sucked up all the liquid and made a nice 'crust' bottom.  I will definately make again and customize with black olives and other favorites.

I left out the sour cream so it was  a little hot. It left your mouth with a warm feeling. I would definately use this recipe again!

I used Aldi's salsa instead on the tomatoes & added onion & garlic to the meat while it simmered. It was good. Tasted a lot like the filling in taco bell tacos. Fast & easy dinner with a salad & extra chips.

This was OK.  I did have to make a substitution since I didn't have the diced tomatoes.  I used a jar of salsa in their place. I served it w/ fresh tomatoes, sour cream, salsa and avocado.  Overall, I felt this recipe was lacking something.  I will not make it again.

This was delicious and so quick and easy to make.  My two teenagers ate almost the whole 9 x 13" pan!  Definately will make again and again.

I modified this a bit: I omitted the can of tomatoes and substituted 3 small (fresh) chopped vine tomatoes, 1 small chopped onion, 2 Tbs. fresh chopped cilantro, 2 Tbs. fresh lime juice and 1 Tbs. red pepper flakes.  I left all other ingredients the same.  The dish came out really well and tasted delicious!  I garnished it with sliced black olives, sliced avocado and tomato, along with cilantro sour cream (1 c. sour cream, 4 Tbs. fresh chopped cilantro, 2 Tbs. fresh lime juice, dash of salt).  When served with the sour cream/fresh veggies, this dish wasn't so dry.  
:-)

This wasn't very good at all.  It was actually better the second day after reheating it.  I thought it was dry and not very tasty at all...and my family hated it.  We LOVE tacos too!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was to dry. Next time, I will add a can of salsa and a lot more spices to it.  It's a good base recipe but it is in need of some tweaking.

Only thing I changed was I substituted and salsa for the green chilies.  Because I beg the question of me first before any toppings make it come out of the oven delicious not one bit soggy and just wonderful.  I didn’t think they added crushed tortilla chips of the top would really make a difference but I was wrong, that little bit of crunch just finished it off nicely

This recipe is quick, easy and fast to make. I added a few ingredients and seasoning. First I sautéed some onion and garlic, then browned my ground beef. After draining I added tomatoes & green chile but instead of adding a ½ cup of water I poured entire can of tomatoes & chile into ground beef. I then added the sour cream& taco seasoning along with black olives. I sprayed my pan with nonstick cooking spray (it keeps my chips from being soggy) then layered Doritos, meat mixture & Mexican, Colby, Monterey Jack, and cheddar cheese. I baked it for 20 minutes then let it sit another 10 minutes before serving. My family loves this recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday for dinner and it was DELICIOUS! However, I did not use corn tortilla chips due to everyone saying their soggyness put a damper on the whole meal. So here's what I did. I used mexican yellow rice, cooked it, and put it in the bottom of the casserole dish. Layered 2 cans of black beans DRAINED on top of the rice, and 2 cans of corn DRAINED on top of the beans. As for my meat, I used 2 lbs. of ground beef, 1 taco seasoning packet, 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped green pepper, 1 can of green chilis UNDRAINED, 1 15.5 oz. jar of salsa, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup of water. Then I scooped this meat mixture on top of the rice, beans, and corn. I finished it off with 1 pack of shredded Taco cheese, but if your a cheese person, you could certainly use more throughout the dish. I baked uncovered at 350° for 30 minutes. I have 3 babies, my fiance, and myself and we ALL loved it!

I tweaked this recipe, 2# ground beef, 1.5 cups sour cream, 2 10oz cans Rotel, used the juice on the Rotel, plus some water, and two packets seasoning. Used 18oz 4 cheese Mexican blend. And barely filled a casserole pan.

I tried this for a Mexican themed party with a few changes. It has become one of the most requested meals from my family since then.  I substituted Rotel for the diced tomatoes and added black beans.  My family prefers it made with cheddar cheese which gives it a little extra bite.  I serve it with jalapenos, salsa, and sour cream on the side.

I added 3 Tablespoons chopped jalapeños. Next time I make it I plan to add 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls of water because it was a bit dry. 
I also plan to add more green chilis.

Made as written except I added onion, minced garlic, and some red pepper flakes to the meat.  Also, used a slotted spoon/spatula to add the meat to the pan.  Retained juices to serve after baking.  This ensured it wasn't soggy.  We loved this recipe!

This was a big hit with me and my husband. I used the hot taco seasoning and added a layer of jalapeños, would probably be good with a layer of refried beans as well. We'll definitely be making this again.

I read reviews, which are quite helpful.  This was very good, using salsa, enchilada sauce, onions & sliced Roma tomatoes.  My pan was large so it only made one layer.  To remedy that I used chopped soft tortilla shells as  topping for a thin second layer with a can of retried beans spread across plus 1/2 can enchilada sauce, cheese & tomatoes. It gave the dish just enough crunch.  Omitted chips (soft tortillas instead) & taco seasoning but really enjoyed the sour cream. Yum!  It made a nice amount & will be even better as leftovers for a second meal.

I made this today, and we loved it!  I had to substitute nacho cheese doritos, since that is what I had on hand. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Excellent!!

Overall, the taste was good and easy to make. I didnt have tomatoes and green chillies so i just added about 1 1/2 tsps of diced jalapenos and it tasted great. My only complaint was that the chips were completely soggy by the time it was done. I only cooked it for about 10 minutes or so, because we have a convection oven so the cook times are shorter. I will make it again but probably not put the chips in, just scoop the contents ontop of chips.

I used rotel (2 cans of the hot kind). Instead of putting the sour cream in the meat I mixed it with two cans of retried beans for a creamy layer. It went chips, taco blend, retried beans, and cheese. It turned out great.

18 oz of tortilla chips is a whole lot!  I don't know if I used that much.  I will definitely make it again but I will increase the amount of shredded cheese.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for today. Came across this and decided to give it a try. I'm coming for 7 so i had to double the recipe. with the beef i used salt, pepper, garlic powder and tones of cumin. I used one can black beans and only one can tomatoes with green chili's because my kids HATE tomatoes and if they see it they refuse to eat...ugh. I also added a jar of medium salsa con queso. 

Only complaint i had was the chips were a little too soggy. :(

otherwise good base recipe.

I made this for the second time over the weekend, or rather, something based on it. Instead of tortilla chips I used actual tortillas because they have no salt and I thought it might just bee to salty when I combined taco seasoning and the chips. I had to double the recipe as we were quite a bit of people and so, because I had a deeper lasagna dish, I improvised to fill it with other stuff. I made on layer of cottage cheese mixed with salsa, and I added a whole lot of corn to the beef mixture. These two changes added an extra layer to the lasagna and actually gave it more of a kick, it was very nice. The only reason I give this recipe 4 starts instead of 5 (it IS great) is that it is rather basic and it's the kind of recipe that you use as a basis to make something more to your taste.

So good! Only change made based on comments was not draining the tomatoes/chili peppers. Turned out the perfect texture. Served with black beans on the side and had no leftovers.

Three things. 1.) I add a jar of salsa from the Dollar Tree to the brown beef/venison. 2.) I use Plain Yogurt vs. sour cream 3.) I toss the spaghetti with the soup/yogurt so it doesn't stick to the pan. The kids love it!

I was not sure about this recipe. It seemed very different from the recipes my family normally eats but I was intrigued. It seemed like an easy and fun recipe to try. And it was! I stuck pretty closely to the original recipe. I added a little more beef, a little less tomatoes, and a little more sour cream and water. I had zero problems with dryness as many have complained about. I also added green olives to the top (if I had had black olives I would have added those instead) and in the future I think I will brown the beef in minced garlic first and add some beans (either refried or black, I'm undecided). Overall I am very happy - this is certainly going to be an easy recipe to add to our family's meals!

My family is a large group of picky eaters.  It was my turn to cook, and I needed something fast.  Even my pickiest daughter went back for seconds, as did my wife.  I was floored!  The only change I made was to use a package of Ortega burrito seasoning instead of taco seasoning, so it was a little milder, but the chiles gave it a nice little kick!

I used 1.32 pounds of grass fed ground beef.  I only used one 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I added 1/8 cup of water.  I added one cup of organic mild salsa.  I added a little extra taco seasoning and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I used a 7"x11" glass Pyrex dish that I sprayed with a light coating of cooking oil spray.  Then, I spread 1/2 cup of ground beef mixture into the bottom of the dish. I then layered  3.2 oz. of organic blue corn tortilla chips broken into smaller pieces.  Next I put slightly less than 1/2 of the remaining ground beef mixture on top of the chips.  Then, I spread 3 oz. of shredded colby jack cheese on top of the chips, then another 3.2 oz. of broken tortilla chips, followed by the remaining 1/2 of the ground beef mixture, topped by another 3 oz. of the shredded colby jack cheese.  I tented aluminum foil over the casserole, crimping it around the dish.  I then cooked the casserole in a preheated 350 degree F oven on the center oven rack for 25 minutes.  I then removed the foil and continued cooking for an additional 10 minutes.  I then removed the casserole from the oven.  I let the casserole cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.  Delicious.

Love this recipe!  I made a few modifications in the interest of moisture.  I used the basic ingredients but used a whole cup of sour cream, a half cup of Philadelphia cream cheese with jalapeños, and 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup, plus I simmered it only for about a minute or two.  It was delicious!! Next time I think I might forego baking it and just pour the meat mixture over the tortilla chips and top with additional cheese and sour cream and eat like nachos.

This was excellent! My husband rated it a "20" out of 10....hard to beat that.  I added a little extra water so that the meat mixture would be extra saucy since it was going to going over top chips, and therefore less dry after baking.  Served it with homemade ranch and a side of beans. YUM! Will be definitely making this again.

I have made this as directed and it's great!  I have also jazzed it up by adding a can of rinsed and drained black beans and a can of corn that had chipotle peppers in (drain the corn but don't rinse it).  I also put in a can or two of tomato paste. I put the chips, then the meat mixture, then sour cream then top with the cheese and layer it up.

I LOVE THIS! I've made this several times now. I've used a few different cheese blends when I couldn't find colby / monterrey and it's always turned out great. I like to crunch up the tortilla chips before spreading them in the casserole dish.

This was an awesome recipe! I bumped it to 2 lbs of beef, added more spices, and an extra can of Rotel. Instead of the sour cream, I used 8oz cream cheese. I also nixed the tortilla chips (low carbing) but it would be great with fritos. We gobbled this up and will be making again next week.

Only made two changes to this dish and there were no leftovers! I substituted Nacho Cheese Doritos for the regular corn chips, added less water than called for (about a 1/4 cup), and added Pace Medium salsa to the mix while on the stove. Very good and just the right amount of heat for my family! I recommend McCormick's original taco seasoning packet, much better than other brands I've tried! (:

I've made this several times now....don't like too spicy so I use plain diced tomatoes & add the juice to my cup measurement for water. I also add chopped onion & green peppers to the browning beef. Up it to 10 servings with 2lbs. of ground beef, so I add 2 packets of seasoning to the mix. Otherwise, I follow the recipe & serve w/ additional sour cream, salsa & tortillas...Always a Hit!! Thanks for the basics!!

The concept of this recipe is great with leftovers from taco night.  I strirred sour cream into the leftover beef/bean taco filling and then layered with the crushed taco shells(just enough to make each layer) and shredded cheese.  So good!!

This recipe was pretty good.  The only thing we didn't like was the sogginess of the chips that were throughout.  I am glad I crunched up some and added on top once it was done.  It definitely needed that crunch.  I also did not drain the tomatoes with green chilis.  We like the extra bite the juice adds to a dish.  Will make again without chips on bottom and throughout, recommend if you like crunch like we do to add them at the end crunched up.

I have a 4 yr old who basically survives on chicken nuggets because he wont try anything else.  Tonight he took a big bite and his eyes lit up! Praise the recipe gods for this! We did alter is slightly as we used ground turkey and added cumin to the seasoning.  Def putting this in our "dish to pass" category too.  Its an awesome base recipe as my husband and I have already started talking about what we can do with it next time.

Desperate for something besides just tacos.  Didn't have sour cream (don't you hate it when it's the day before you shop for groceries and the cupboard is looking kinda bare???) so, I used cream cheese!  Put a couple of flour tortilla's (low carb ones) into a pie plate and commenced to make layers, topped all with a couple more tortilla's and piled on the cheese.  We loved it!  There's plenty left we can have for lunch tomorrow AFTER we get home with the groceries!!  Fast, easy and very tasty!

This was very good. I made this to bring to a friends. I increased the servings to 10 which was 2 lbs of ground beef. I added 2 full cans of diced tomatoes & 2 packs of taco mix & increased the water. Not much of a change. I omitted the sour cream because my Husband & I don't like it. Served Tostito scoops on the side. Came our great & everyone liked it

I served this to my teen children and their friends.  I used chicken broth instead of water thinking that would aid in the flavors coming together.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  I thought it was a little dry, but a nice flavor and simple to make.

I made this because I had leftover taco meat, and it was great.  I just added sour cream to the meat sauce.  My husband and I even enjoyed the leftovers a couple days later.  I didn't have any plain tortilla chips so I used "Salsa and Limon" flavored tortilla chips.  (they made it a little spicier).  This will be a quick dinner to make.  I will make sure I have normal chips next time.

i used ground chicken in place of the beef, like i do all my taco dishes. left out the sour cream and used 1/2 a 18 oz bag of fritos scoops. it was a nice change from regular tacos. my 3 y/o didnt care for the chips she just ate the meat.

We all liked this, I did add a can of black beans and sliced black olives, I also used the taco season recipe from this site not a packet.  Served with shredded lettuce, sour cream, diced tomatoes, and salsa.  There are 5 of us and there were lots of left overs.

I made this last night for a quick and easy taco dinner. I did not drain the tomatoes and instead omitted the water.  The chips soaked up a lot of the moisture, so they were a little soggy, but it made them taste a bit like a tamale, so it wasn't all bad.  My family enjoyed it, even my picky six-year-old daughter finished seconds.  We always serve this type of dish with lettuce, cheese, sour cream and salsa on top.  This particular dish didn't stand out in my opinion, but it was something different and easy and I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

The chips were too mushy for our taste but we liked the overall flavor. Next time we'll leave the chips out and serve the bake as a dip.

Marvelous!  I love how you can use whole grain tortilla chips and fat free sour cream and cheese to make the recipe a bit better for you.  Also, you can keep it as it is, super easy and quick, or if you have more time, you could chop up and throw in some in-season tomatoes as well. Fabby!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe, although I did not drain the tomatoes, and therefore did not need the water.  We don't like a lot of spiciness, the green chiles in the tomatoes is about as hot as we go!  I used the Taco Seasoning I from this site, also.  I baked a smaller batch, (I have leftover meat mixture for another day), only filling a 9x5 loaf pan for three of us.  It only took about 10 mins. in the oven.  I will make this again.

This was very good. My hubby and 4 kids ate it up. My 7 yr old stepson told me he has never ate anything this good before. And my very picky 8 yr old ate it up. I didn't have tomatoes with chilis in them so I just used a can of diced tomatoes. My hubby doesn't like chunks of tomatoes so I pureed it first. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great! The chips do get soggy. But no one cared. They actually didn't like the chips that were still crunchy. We will be making this one again.

Very good, I recommend this to everyone. I would suggest not draining the diced tomatoes to add more moisture. I urge everyone mexican food lover to try this

Delicious!  I followed the recipe except used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced chilis instead of a combined can.  Also substituted Mexican blend of cheeses.  Chips lose their crispiness during cooking, so broke some fresh chips over top of dish when serving

I tweaked this recipe a little by using ground turkey instead of the beef. I also used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup ricotta cheese vs. 1 cup sour cream and it turned out yummy!

This is a very good, quick recipe.  You can omit the 1/2 c water and not drain the tomatoes and green chilis.

Meh... it was ok but not great. The tortilla chips were really soggy abd the flavor was kinda bland. Maybe I cooked too long? I doubt I'll make this one again

This wasn't bad, but not my favorite. I have to agree with others that the chips were alittle soggy. My husband covered it with hot sauce and then ate it. Probably won't make it again. Thanks anyway!

I'd rate this recipe more like 4.5 (if there was such a rating).  My family enjoyed it and it was very easy to make.  I used fresh tomatoes and didn't have any green chiles on hand... maybe that would have made it a five?  Overall, this is a good recipe.

This is a great meal.  My kids can be pretty picky when it comes to some things, but they loved this meal.

There was nothing special about this recipe.  I thought it was dry.
