I have made this salad for three family occasions!  It is always a big hit.  I'm not a vegetable cutter, so I have made the salad without the broccoli and cauliflower and it has been tasty!  My husband loves veggies, and loves to cut them and the salad is great that way too!  
Lots of people try to guess all the ingredients in the recipe!  Most of them don't guess the Hidden Valley Ranch Packet or the seasoning!  It's really a great, tangy recipe that is well worth the work (which isn't much) and you will not take any leftovers home!!!!

I tried this recipe for our local firemen on a mutual fire call. Only the first wave of fireman got to try it. As they ate the whole large bowl I had made. Others where disappointed that they did not get to try this wonderful looking and smelling salad.

This had a good flavor and it certainly makes a LOT.  Remember to break the spaghetti into smaller pieces before cooking for easier eating.

This won rave reviews at a barbecue we just attended.  My picky husband who doesn't usually eat spaghetti salad thought it was great.  I omitted cauliflower, I added red bell pepper and a large sized tomato chopped.

This was really good. I changed up the veggies and just did cucumbers, olives, green onions and tomatoes. I also added some mozzarella cheese. I wasn't sure how the Italian dressing and the Ranch would be together but it had great flavor. I will make this often and play around with different veggies and cheeses.

\is was pretty good.  I offered grated parmesan cheese on side which was a nice addition.  I also added some tomatoes from the garden which was a nice addition for both taste and color.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, DEHERDEBU!

I found this pasta salad a little light on flavor and too much veggies for the amount of pasta. Some weren't a fan of the Italian dressing taste. Overall I think it was a ok recipe but just not for us.

I made this for a pot luck at work, and it was devoured.  Since then, I've made it two more times, varying the vegetable ingredients according to what I have available.  It's excellent each time.  I think the secret is in the combination of zesty Italian dressing and the ranch dressing mix, with the salad seasoning.  It gives a nice kick to the pasta and vegetables, whichever kinds you decide to use.

Doubled it. Except, I didn't put in the tomatoes. (My husband doesn't like tomatoes.) It was pretty good, my husband loves  it.

Yes.  This is very good.  I also add pepperoni for the meat lovers out there.  Very tasty side dish.
