Very easy and worth the wait it takes to cook.  Keeps well too.  Lite alternative to butter or cream cheese, and not like jelly at all!

I don't know what apple butter is supposed to taste, for I've never had it before, but this surely is a good healthy spread. What is more, it only takes minutes to prepare. I'm sure the ones made in a slow cooker would taste even better, but I don't have one, and this is a great alternative. Gotta give it a try. P.S.: I stirred it every 30 minutes while baking, but next time, I'll do it every 45-60 minutes.

WOW!  This is really, really good and so easy!  I didn't change a thing except I cooked it uncovered in my slow cooker (on high).  Made the house smell amazing!  I may never buy apple butter again.

No, it doesn't taste like homemade, but with the main ingredient being a conveniece product, I didn't expect it to.  That stated, this is absolutely delicious!!  Ten stars!  My whole family (including 9-yr-old Mr Finicky) loved it!  I was trying to use up a large amount of leftover applesauce.  Looks like I need to go get more now.  Simple to prepare, no exotic ingredients, easy to store, yummy to eat - perfect!!  Oh, and I took the advice of a previous reviewer and stirred every 45 mins.

I omitted the cloves as I didn't have them.  I also didn't have vinegar, so I used bottled lemon juice instead.  Definitely need to cut down on the sugar by at least 3/4 of a cup, but otherwise nearly perfect.  You can tell the texture is a little 'off' from your normally smooth apple butter, but the taste is beyond amazing.  I jarred and froze some for later.  Thanks!

My husband loved this recipe.  I will be making another batch today.  I did make some changes.  I use less sweetener and I also used 1/2 splenda brown sugar and 1/2 regular brown sugar.  This time, I'm going to try using splenda only as the sweetener since our family has a lot of diabetics.  This will be a welcome additon to my basket of homemade birthday/christmas presents.

I was running low on my favorite purchased apple butter, but it was locally made from a town 8 hours away, too far to pick up at my local store.  I saw that the ingredients were the same in this recipe, so I went for it.  I was looking for a recipe with applesauce, since my baby decided he was no longer going to eat baby food, so I had a freezer full of applesauce to use up.  I am so glad this recipe was posted here!  All the ingredients are readily available in any cook's kitchen.  The only problem I had was that the casserole dish I used was too small, and the apple butter cooked out and splattered all over my oven.  Next time, I may try someone else's recipe suggestion and put it in the crock pot all day.  This recipe makes your house smell AWESOME!  I tried some on a ritz cracker and I almost couldn't stop eating it.  I look forward to making this recipe again, possibly for Christmas gifts!  I didn't think I liked apple butter, but after making and tasting this recipe, I am convinced that this apple butter is quite possibly the best fall food ever!

I made this with my daughter's preschool class.  Loved the fact that you baked it.  I cooked down red delicious apples for it.  I doubled the apple portion of the recipe and it seened like I should have cut down on the vinegar.  Great recipe though.  Teh house smelt great while it was cooking and had a great color when it was done.

OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! This is the best apple butter i've ever had. And the comment dissing using applesauce instead of 'homemade' was uncalled for.  Just someone with a superiority complex.  This product is incredible. I didn't change a thing and it was tart/tangy/sweet/mouthwatering. You won't regret trying this.  And yes, the suggestion of stirring every 45 min. in from the corners helped alot. Thanks for this recipe diane!

I only wanted a small quantity so this recipe caught my eye.  I had already made unsweetened applesauce, so I used about 24 oz of that, added a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 3 tbs cider vinegar, the cloves, cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice.  After 2 1/2 hours baking it was still not close to the right consistence, so I turned the oven down to 300 and let it bake for another 2 1/2 hours.  The result was heavenly.  Thanks for the idea of baking apple butter.

This is really easy and really good. I cut the recipe in half and add 3/4 cup of pumpkin for the fall, making an Apple Pumpkin Butter. Really tasty!

YUMMY!! I thought I would not like it by the way it looks, but it is fantastic.  Light and sweet.  This is the perfect breakfast jam.  It makes the house smell wonderful.  I did not have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar.  I will use this to make apple butter pork loin which is from this site.  Thanks for the formula.

This is good for a quick recipe for gift giving but nothing can beat the old fashioned way for
apple butter by cooking the apples for a long time.

I made this apple butter and gave as a simple gift for people who helped with my parents 50th wedding anniversary.   Wonderful and easy to make.

Yum!  I had  to cook this a little longer, but I was using homemade applesauce, so it might have been a little more watery.  Either way, this was amazing!

This was great - I've never had apple butter before but will definitely be making it again. I cut the recipe in half and it made a great hostess gift for Thanksgiving, with a little left over for home! Thanks, I'll make this over and over.

I'm not an apple butter aficionado or anything, so I don't know if this is great apple butter or not.  It gets 5 stars from me, though, because it was easy to make and tasted good on my Apple Butter Pork (another recipe on this site).

I made this once as written and then made another batch and created a cranberry-orange version.  In both instances, I did not leave it in the oven as long as the recipe said to.  After an hour and a half, I started watching the consistency closely so that I would still have a spreadable butter and not a jam.  

For the cranberry-orange version.  I substituted 1 can of cranberry sauce (jelly, not whole berry) for 14 oz. of the applesauce.  When the butter had cooled, I added about 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1-2 t. orange zest.  This turned out to be a nice, festive, spin on apple butter.

Each time I made this recipe it yielded 3, 8 oz. freezer containers of apple butter.
