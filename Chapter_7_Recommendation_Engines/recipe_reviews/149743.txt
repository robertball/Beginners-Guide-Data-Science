I was looking for a recipe to use up the coconut milk I had leftover from making Thai noodles. I did not have any banana leaves but I did have foil packets. I did add a 1 tsp of curry paste to the marinade. It was wonderful. The chicken fell off the bone and my husband loved it. I can only imagine how much better it will taste when I try it with the banana leaves.

I couldn't help it and added a little minced garlic with the ginger. I made it for a friend who grew up in PNG and he said it reminded him of home but didn't taste like the food in PNG because when he was there the food wasn't very flavorful (I blame the garlic). I thought it was tasty and fun (hard to wrap with banana leaves though). I used the extra coconut milk to boil with the rice, gave it a cool flavor.
