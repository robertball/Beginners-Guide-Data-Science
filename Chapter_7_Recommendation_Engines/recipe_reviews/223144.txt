We made this as written using frozen wontons and added baby bok choy and bean sprouts to make the soup more filling for dinner.  This was easy, fast, and made a lot.  We made half of the recipe for the two of us and we still had leftovers.

Delicious and easy, even for a newbie cook like myself. Just make sure you get the right chile-garlic sauce for that kick. I don't think I got a good brand, I should have just gone ahead and bought Srirachi. But I'm still thoroughly enjoying my dinner, I can tell you that.

We love this easy recipe.  My 13 year old makes it using a bag of frozen trader joe wontons.  We cook the wontons right in the broth and just add a little extra broth.  The recipe is very flexible and will come out ok even if your measurements are off a bit - perfect when hungry kids are cooking.

This is a favorite recipe of mine. I have gotten rave reviews every time I make it. I use homemade chicken stock, mini wontons from Costco, add baby bok choy and green onion and it's perfection. I add the wontons, baby bok choy and green onions all straight into the simmering broth and everything turns out great.

LOVED this soup! I'm lazy, so I just threw the wontons in the broth, and that worked fine for me. I also added a bunch of green onions that I finely sliced. I could see making this w/ rice noodles too. Really great flavor...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Used this recipe as my first attempt at wonton soup and I loved it! Added bok choy, celery, carrots, shitake mushrooms and green onions for color and filling and it worked out perfectly. Definitely needs some ginger though. I used powdered and it brought it all together.

Fabulous stand alone recipe just as written. I am so happy and impressed, just made it for lunch, only had potstickers in freezer and threw them in with a fresh chopped chard and scallion greens.
thanks for the best wonton soup ever

I made this according to the recipe. Sriracha sauce is a must—knockoffs won’t do, IMHO. I boiled my wontons separately. Since they were frozen and only took two minutes to reheat I think I may boil them in the broth next time, just for more flavor. One thing—low sodium chicken broth is very bland, so if you also use low sodium soy, you may need more seasoning. I added more salt. When I make this again, I may use a full fat full salt chicken broth. I added fried wonton strips to the soup and fresh basil leaves. Yumm-O!

Delicious. I was out of soya sauce so substituted 1 tsp fish sauce. For veggie I added chopped up Swiss chard.

I will admit that I only took advice from your recipe but it has become a HUGE hit at my home. I use “red wine vinegar” instead of “rice” because it gives the extra kick. And other than the soy sauce...I do not follow. But it helped me perfect mine with the mini wontons (chicken and cilantro) from Costco and udon noodles. I also cook the wontons directly in the broth. Point is....our last minute meal after a long day went from chicken broth and wontons to a dope broth, wontons, udon noodles, bok choy, -!; green onions. Sooo easy to make and totally delicious. Thanks for the advice!

This broth was fantastic! Made the broth exactly as written but because I wanted to make it a supper dish, I added vegetables and ramen noodles. I cooked everything but the noodles right in the broth. Everyone loved it and wanted it put on the make again list!

This got mixed reviews from my family.  My son and my husband thought that the broth was a little sour so next time I would leave out the lemon juice and/or the vinegar.  I left the chili-garlic sauce out so that my husband and I could just add it to our own bowls, as it would have been too spicy for the kids.  It's much, much better with the addition of the spicy sauce.  Without the chili-garlic sauce it was about a 2-star rating but with it, it was somewhere between 3 to 4 stars.    I did everything else exactly as written.  Not sure if I'll make this one again since nobody really loved it.  I though the broth was decent so maybe I'll give it one more try without the lemon juice/vinegar.

I made this as written. Although I’m not sure why you couldn’t just add the wontons right to the broth I didn’t so I can give it a true rating. In my opinion it was to much sesame oil and overpowered it. My local Chinese places don’t add the oil to their broth. It’s not a true wonton broth but it served its purpose for what I wanted for lunch on a cold day and used the leftover wontons I had in the freezer. I won’t make it again tho. Just not to my tasting. Thanks for the recipe though.

I have a wonton soup recipe that makes great wontons, but is lacking in the soup area so I tried this recipe.  I didn't use the lemon juice and I didn't have sriracha (so I used a teaspoon of hoisin sauce which gave it a little hint of ginger).  I saw a one-star rating that said the soup tasted like watered-down soy...wonder if they added the wonton water to the broth?  I though this made a great wonton soup base!

Very good flavor. I cooked the wontons right in the broth instead of separately and just removed them when they floated to the top so they wouldn't open up. I put the wontons along with some steamed broccoli in a bowl and ladled the broth over it to serve. I imagine it would be great with other asian veggies and/or shrimp.

This was bad. There is no kick to this soup; after following this recipe exactly, the broth tasted just like watered down soy sauce.
