these walnuts were so delicious! the only alteration i would suggest would be a little less topping (and i mean a little) as well as placing in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes.  If not put in the oven, the nuts taste chewy and raw under the sugar coating. the oven just crisps them a bit to make them even more delicious!

Wonderful and so much less expensive than buying them in the store. Be careful, use an heat proof spatula when stiring.

This is the fastest way ever of making salad glazed nuts.  It's definately not the holiday nuts, but that's not needed for for salads.  I don't really even measure the sugar to water ratio strictly, and it always turns out fine.  The only thing is the time in the microwave.  BEWARE: WATCH THE CARMELIZATION because you may end up w/ charred walnuts w/ 8 minutes in your microwave.  I find that 4-5 minutes works well with me.

This is a keeper! I made 1 cup with 800 watt micro and it took 3 minutes. I used brown sugar for a different flavor.

I put these delicious nuts on a spinach salad with dried cranberries, mandrin oranges, and poppy seed dressing last night.  I couldn't believe it when my friends went back for seconds on the salad instead of the other yummy choices!  They literally scraped the salad bowl clean!  My microwave tood about 5 minutes; it's not hard to know when they're done.  Just stir them every couple of minutes, and take them out when the sugar looks caramelized.

These were good, but they do taste like little sugar bombs. I tried using more walnuts the second time and they came out better, but still too sweet. My father in law loved them though.

Easy and so good.  Great in a salad, but most of the recipe disappears before the table is set.  Watch the time as each microwave differs.  Thanks, Sharon.

I wanted to make these basically just so I could recreate the McDonalds fruit and walnut salad here at home...these were perfect! And so easy to make! I did reduce the cooking time in the microwave by half, so I only microwaved them for 4 minutes, stirring every minute for the first 2 minutes, then every 30 seconds for the last 2. Then I put them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes. They turned out perfect! I definitely will be making these all the time!

If you need glazed walnuts quick for a salad, this is a perfect recipe.  I agree that time is less in the microwave - about 5.5 min. for mine.

I always toast my walnuts or pecans before I do anything with them. Gives them a much more flavorful taste. Toasting in a coated pan for 5 or so minutes, or when you start smelling that wonderful aroma. Take off the stove before they cook too long. Don't want them to burn. Then I do the remaining recipe.

This version should be called "sanded walnuts".  Generally I consider myself a fairly accomplished baker, however, when it comes to caramelizing sugar I cringe!  After reading the reviews I decided to break one of my standing rules, not to change anything the first time out.  This is what I did:  2 Cups walnuts, 1/2 cup BROWN sugar, 3 tablespoons of water in a wide Pyrex 4 cup measure, 8 minutes at 8% power in microwave.  Stirred every minute until it got really bubbly then I shortened the time.  At one point the bubbles were multiplying.  It was at about 4 minutes.  I held them out for more than 30 second stirring for some reason, popped them back in.  40 seconds later I did not see bubbling, took them out and the "syrup" had turned back to sugar (this is why I cringe).  Decided to take them out with about 3 minutes to go, spread them onto parchment (I'm lazy) on a cookie sheet.  They are really good!  I will try it again but take them out sooner and try not to let them cool down too much while stirring and popping them back in again.  Thanks to all you for your suggestions!

These were awesome. I cooked them in the oven b/c I don't have a microwave and the nuts were great.  I made 2 batches, and on one I added some ground ginger and cinnamon which were extra good.

After reading the reviews, I was very cautious about the timing--but found it took me the entire 8 & a half minutes suggested in the recipe to caramelize the sugar.  Easy easy easy!

This recipe is great for whipping up glazed walnuts for your salad in 5 minutes flat!  DO be careful with the cooking time however- some microwaves are much stronger than others.  I nuked the nuts for 4 1/2 minutes, stirring after each minute.  They would have been perfect after only 4 minutes.  The sugar started to recrystalize after that- not as pretty.  They were slightly browned and oven-crispy.  Who knew you could have crunchy glazed nuts from the microwave?

Just like the McDonald's ones w/salad. I add a touch of vanilla and cook on stove top for a minute or so. Toss occasionally while drying. But this is almost same recipe I use and they are great.  Very addicting!!!

Wow...what could be easier??  I was looking for sugared walnuts to add to a salad I was making so I tried these--they were excellent--and my husband and kids scarfed the rest down as a snack.  I used walnut pieces and cooked for between 5 and six minutes.

Very easy and great taste, but not quite there on the texture.  Even after cooling completely, they were still not crunchy - slightly mushy.  Will try again and put them in the oven for a bit.

Amazingly easy.  Being a skeptic, I made 1/2 recipe to test and added a small amount of honey to the sugar/water before mixing in the walnuts.  You definitely want to stir every minute.  I have doubts how much of this will make it to a salad! YUM!

This is a great recipe for quick and easy sugared walnuts, but got mixed reviews for taste at my house. I thought these tasted like little sugar bombs that did not allow the walnut flavor to come through. My husband liked them a lot saying they tasted like walnuts to him! I added some cinnamon to mine as well.

Yikes -- too good to last in my house!!  I made some adjustments to suit my sweet tooth at the moment.  I used a mixture of walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds.  I added maybe 1/2 to 1 tsp of cinnamon and a touch of sea salt.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Microwave for about 5 minutes and oven at 350 for maybe 10 min as well.   I know this is a bit different from the posted recipe, but there's a lot you can do with this!!

Worked out great...Sugar Glazed as promissed.  I only needed half the recipe so I put it in the micro and every 20-30 seconds stirred.  It was like a syrup for every stir and then finally (about 3 min. into it) it turned within 20 seconds to sugar glazed...so I can see if you are not watching this, how it can burn quickly.

I make half the recommended quantity by halving all the ingreds and microwaving for 3.5 mins.  Start checking on it every 30 secs after the 2 min mark.  It should start to look a light caramel-y brown in color.  Better to check often and pull it out too soon.  If you over-do it, it will burn in an instant and there's no recovering your walnuts then.

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before attempting this, and I too ended up with a charred mess and smoke filled kitchen.  I stirred at 3 minutes and should have only gone maybe another minute more.  At 6 minutes they were black.  I'm sure they would be very good if not cooked too long, so I will try again another time.

Great microwave recipe!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and a good sprinkling of salt and cinnamon.  It took 6.5 minutes in my microwave to cook and, after a few minutes of cooling on parchment paper, they crisped up nicely!

These would be great put into a pretty jar as a holiday or hostess gift!

These came out great. I overcooked my first batch and got crystalized walnuts (still yummy), but made add'l batches with better results. Big thank you to those who sent in variations.  I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar + cinnamon & vanilla. As I prefer almonds, I used this variation after toasting almonds and they came out better than those I buy at Cabela!

I'm giving this five stars with the additional final step, as one reviewer suggested, of roasting the walnuts at 350.  I made a 1/4 recipe using All Recipe's calculator, and I cooked the walnuts in the microwave for 2 minutes on high, stirring often.  I then roasted the walnuts for about 10 minutes.  They will be perfect for tomorrow's spinach salad--if they last that long!

I scaled this recipe way back since I only needed a small amount to top the Sweet Summer Fruit Bruschetta recipe from this site.  My walnuts burnt after 2.5 minutes so make sure you watch them closely.  That was all the walnuts I had so I substituted pecans instead and the recipe worked great with about a 2 minute cooking time (about 1/2 C of nuts).  They'd be good with some cinnamon added too.

I used Splenda, and they turned out just wonderful. I used these in an apple spinach salad for my daughter's wedding. I served the nuts to the side, in case folks were allergic. It really added a touch of elegance, and guests raved. Several asked for the recipe.
I will be using them for my Christmas salad as well.
Thanks for helping me add elegance and flavor

YUM!  Delicious addition to salad!  I followed this recipe, but wasn't sure what 'done' meant- having never cooked these before.  I think I went a little too far (6 1/2 mins. in my microwave) and they recrystalized.  I stirred after every minute and kept watching to see how much of the liquid was absorbed.  Once I though they were done, I spread them out on a parchment lined cookie sheet and then put them in the oven- which I had just turned off after baking a cake- and let them sit there until I was ready to assemble the salad.  This added an extra bit of crunch to them and really made them over the top good.  Thanks for an easy recipe that has LOTS of wow-factor!

Love this recipe. Reduced sugar by 2 tbsp. Used square glass pan.  Started in microwave for 2 min at a time for 8 total min then 3 min. Stir in between ea time segment. Moved to baking sheet lined w/ parchment paper & placed in preheated oven at 350' for 15 min. PERFECT!

Easy, but cook time was way too long for my microwave - walnuts were kind of burnt tasting in half the time.  I will try again but only microwave 2-3 minutes.

Very Good, I do agree that you could add more than 2 cups of walnuts. If I go 8-8.5 min in my microwave (1100 W) they over-crystalize. I take them out just as the bubbling starts to stop. That means the water is about gone and they turn out great. If they end up chewy you can stick them in the oven for 5 -10 minutes to drive off the water and make them crispy.

Easy and Fast.  I originally tried to cut the recipe in half and it was a disaster.  I ended up with  burned walnuts and sticky mess.   I tried again the next day with full recipe in a glass pyrex container and they came out perfect.  Stir often!

DO NOT let them cool on parchment paper as one reviewer suggests...you can guess what happens, lol should've known...Other than that, these were great!  I lessened the water and sugar by about a tbsp and added a tbsp honey.  Excellent.

I'm sure this recipe has great potential, but as written I ended up with a smoke-filled house and a black mess in the microwave that smelled horrible.  I checked the nuts every 2 minutes - after 4 they didn't seem carmelized at all, but at the 6 minute stage it was already WAY to late.  I can't imagine anyone needing to microwave these anywhere near the 8 minutes.

These were really good (I used pecans because I didn't have walnuts), but the only thing wrong was that they stuck together in clumps even though I spread them out on the baking sheet.  Anyway, really good on Strawberry Spinach Salad!

These are excellent. I don't do them in the microwave. I do them on a sheet pan in the oven at 350 for 10 mins, stir them around then about another 10 mins or until the sugar crystalizes. This works great with pecan halves too!

Just tried this recipe. In less than four minutes I managed to annihilate all the walnuts and most probably the glass measuring cup that I was microwaving them in. The whole blackened mess is sitting on my kitchen counter still bubbling away like some noxious witches brew. Oh well, I guess it will be plain old unglazed walnuts for my salad! A word to the wise...watch cooking times VERY carefully if you bother to try this recipe.

Very easy recipe, and came out very tasty!  Although, it seemed like too much sugar, so I doubled the walnuts.  And then I too put them in the oven for 15 minutes to crisp them up a little more.  Great suggestion.  I recommend stirring every 2 minutes for 6 minutes, then microwaving them 1 more minute before spreading on a baking sheet.  Then just pop them in the oven.  Came out perfect twice!

Used with Splenda Blend, a 1/2 tea of vanilla extract, and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and they were ready to be added to anything my heart desires.

I used pecans and combined previous suggestions.  I added a little brown sugar with the white sugar.  Watch very carefully so it doesn't burn.  Very good.

Updated 07/28/2019:  I no longer stir the walnuts every 2 to 3 minutes, I just let the microwave do all the work.  At about 5 minutes into cooking you should start to smell the walnuts and at about 6 minutes you should be able to see the sugar browning through microwave window.  Let the walnuts get a little color on them and pull them out and spread out over a baking sheet.  Don't wait too long to pull them out, they will burn quickly.

Excellent and easy!  Watch after the last stirring--I was close to burning the nuts since each microwave will be a little different for timing.  We plan to duplicate a delicious restaurant salad of roasted pears, rotisserie chicken, fresh raspberries and bleu cheese over mixed greens with a raspberry dressing and these glazed walnuts as the yummy combo...can't wait!

These are pure YUM!  Easy, fast and you can eat them by the handful or put them in salads, cookies or wherever.  I didn't have to put mine in the oven as one other reviewer did.  I just let them cool on the greased cookie sheet and they crisped right up.  Try these for sure!

This were even better than I had hoped! I microwaved them at a power level of 8 on a 1000watt microwave.  Stirred every 30 seconds.  Total cook time was 5 1/2 minutes.  Toasting them up in the oven for a few minutes makes them even better!  Put on green salad with red onion, feta cheese and golden raisins- was SO delicious!

Should have stopped at 7 minutes, the extra 60 seconds was too much-burned the mixture.  Good taste, will try again with less time.  Will recheck my star rating after another attempt.

I ended up with a solid clump of walnuts and (still white, no brown at all) sugar solidly stuck to the bottom of my bowl.  And that was after less than 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.  I am once again convinced that trying to microwave a short-cut is always a waste of time.

After 7 minutes the ingredients became a brick.  Perhaps the time should be only 6 minutes but I'm not willing to risk anymore walnuts to find out.

i have made these a number of times. you can add spices to the sugar before adding the water (i just added some 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a  pinch of nutmeg) or make plain. either way, they are delicious. the first few times i made them, i wound up with a glossy, sugary perfect nut. today, i think i let them go 30 seconds too long and got a thicker coating. they are still tasty, i stirred in a few cranberries but i want to try it again when i have the stickier version so that they form little clusters. all in all, so easy and so good. you MUST watch though - i stirred every 45 seconds and was done by 4 min and a half (although i went to five:/) - i think you need the mixture to still be just the slightest bit bubbly in the microwave to get the sticky kind of nut:)

I'm sure it depends on your microwave but 8 minutes was way too long in mine.
Per the instructions planned to stir several times so I set the first round at 2 minutes then stirred. It was at the first stage, liquidy. Then 2 minutes more and stirred. The second stage was a much tighter liquid, more like a thick syrup. Then 2 minutes more. The third stage was a coarse candy texture. Then 2 minutes more...but...after 1 minute of the last 2 minutes, I could smell them starting to burn. I removed them after 1 minute and thank goodness I did. Some of them were almost black and the sugar was stuck strongly onto the glass of the measuring cup. I had to scrape them off of the glass in order to get them out. All in all, the ones that didn't burn were very tasty. I made these to put on my salad and it served it's purpose. I will make these again as they were quick and easy but I will definitely not go 8 minutes. This time I will go 6.5 minutes and they should be perfect.

Again toasted the nuts first, and only made one cup.  Took less than 4 minutes to caramelize the sugar.  What a money saving idea, 3.99 for same amount already done.

These are perfect for a sweet snack or as a topping on a desert or fruity salad! They are very sweet. I think they taste good right out of the microwave or popping them into the oven after microwaving them. Will satisfy any sweet tooth!

Throw is a dash of cinnamon for a warm holiday flavor.  I throw these over mixed greens with dried cranberries, red onion and a sweet and sour dressing.

These are great!  I tweaked the recipe a bit.  Added a tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt to enhance the flavor.  I  threw everything, except the nuts,  into a nonstick frying pan and heated, stirring continuously until the mixture thickened up a bit.  Then I added the walnuts and continued to stir until the liquid was almost gone.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and baked them for about 20 min in the oven (255 deg.)  Yum!

So so easy. I made this for the first time and couldn't believe how easy it was. The zoo sells glazed almonds, a small bag, for $6. For that price you can make quadruple the amount if you make your own.

Very easy and yummy!  Careful, the sugary liquid is very hot!  Do not be tempted to overcook.  The time provided is adequate.

I just made these; used oecans and brown sugar, also dashed in flavored sea salt and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.  did in two minute bursts in the microwave and turned out on a cookie sheet to harden.  I think it took about 5 minutes.  Excellent!  These are going on my thanksgiving table as a side dish to sprinkle on salad or sweet potatoes.

make sure you stir this every minute to keep an eye on it.  the first batch i mircowaved for 5 minutes and ruined it.  it only took my micro. 4 minutes to cook it.  the only thing i would change is maybe to roast the walnuts first in the oven to get rid of some of the raw nut taste, and then do this recipe.  these are fantastic on a salad with green apples! thanks for the recipe!

This is my families favorite snack. I prefer to use pecans and brown sugar. I also like to add an extract, usually vanilla but raspberry or other fruit flavor works well too, about 1 tspn. I also tried lime juice and chili powder and/or cayenne pepper, both were great adds. For the holiday's, I pour the glazed nuts, hot out of the microwave, straight over a fudge pie just before baking.

These walnuts were a hit with my family!  I made them to go into a strawberry and blue cheese salad, and it was wonderful!  I will be making these over and over again! I did put them into the over for 5 minutes just to crisp them up, but that's the only change I made.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I baked the walnuts on a cookie sheet with parchment paper, at 350 for 15 minutes.  

These went into a Thanksgiving salad with mixed greens, roasted golden beets, blue cheese, and dried cranberries.  Dressed with a lemon vinaigrette.

Tasted great. Husband got to them and confessed he couldn’t stop eating them. I microwaved the sugar mixture for 6 minutes total. Stirring every 2 minutes. I followed the previous suggestion and baked them for 15 at 350 degrees to finish them.

I decided to cook the sugar glaze on the stove top. I then placed the glazed walnuts in the oven for a little but to assure that they were crispy.

I gave this one less star only because I made a couple minor changes.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what my recipe called for, this would work for either.  I followed the recipe except I microwaved it for 4 minutes, stirred every minute for the first 2 minutes, then every 30 seconds.  As per other suggestions, I then put it on a baking pan in the CONVECTION oven, 325 for 7 or 8 minutes (I've made a version of this before and the nuts weren't crunchy enough, so that's why I baked in the oven, and this time they turned out much better).  Two other things I would change:  after microwaving, there was still some syrup left in the glass measure, and I would try harder next time to transfer the nuts to a baking pan for the oven baking with as little of the leftover syrup as possible, and I would try to separate the nuts on the baking pan better so they're not stuck together (no problem breaking them apart if not separated, but I think they look better in the end when baked & dried separately).  Also, instead of finally pouring them onto a greased baking sheet, I used non-stick aluminum foil on the counter.  Worked great!  Also, for those of you who made just half a recipe, go ahead and make a full recipe and put the unused nuts in the freezer in a zip-lock bag!  I do this all the time so I have the nuts ready when I need them!  I can eat these nuts like candy, they're so good!

OH MY GOODNESS!  WONDERFUL RECIPE AND SO EASY!!!!!  I added a little vanilla extract to mine.  It took mine about 8 minutes in a large Pyrex round casserole dish.  I stirred every 2 minutes.  At 8 minutes, it was looking slighty dry and when I tasted it, I knew it was ready.  This is so much less expensive than buying the glazed walnuts pre-made.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!!!!!  :-)

My family loves these on Strawberry Chicken Salads. I stir mine every 30 seconds and it doesn’t take long for them to caramelize in our microwave. I’ve started baking for 6-8 minutes after the microwave and find I like them better and also think it’s better for storing any unused nuts.

Tried this twice. The first time I didn't watch it close enough and they burnt. The second time, I stopped the microwave every 1-2 minutes to stir (still only had to cook them 4-5 mins) and they turned out powdery. I've made these before, stovetop in a frying pan and they were far superior.

I tried this recipe - put it in the microwave for 8 min.  I stirred at 6 1/2 min, and turned my back and the whole microwave was smoking.  I pulled it out & the whole mixture was burned and stuck to my glass dish.  I'm going to look for a recipe that is baked!

These were great for a quick recipe, the coating became sort of crystalized on mine, which is fine, I'm using them for an ice cream topping, I was hoping for a more glazed type nut which I think would need the addition of milk.   I'm thinking of trying this same recipe with milk instead of water next time.  I cooked for 1 minute then stirred every 30 seconds, they were done in my 1000 watt microwave in 3 minutes.

This recipe was amazingly simple. The walnuts could have used a light toasting in the oven after microwaving if I were putting them in a salad. However, I used them in an oven baked appetizer (puff pastry, Stilton, and caramelized onions topped with glazed walnuts), and they were perfect. I stirred the mixture every 30 seconds and had no problems with burning.

I had walnuts and wanted to sugar them, found this recipe and in 8 minutes had exactly what I craved.  Talk about instant gratification... AMAZING.  I followed the directions exactly, used a 4-cup Pyrex measuring cup to cook them.  Stirred every two minutes.

I toasted my walnuts in the oven first (375 for about 8 min), then sugared them as written but with a little less of the syrup. The nuts come out crispy and flavorful but just slightly sweet.

cinnamon and vanilla. I also added nutmeg, cloves, allspice and some chipotle powder for kick. These were fabulous. I love that you can do these in the microwave. My family scarfed these down, and now I have to go crack more walnuts.

I love how easy this recipe is.  I cut back on the sugar a bit, as the first time I made it my husband thought it was too much. (I enjoyed them both ways.)
