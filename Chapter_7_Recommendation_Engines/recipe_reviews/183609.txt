I tried this with no idea how I would like it. I've actually never had feta cheese before. I loved it. The chicken by itself tastes very good, and the salad is just a healthy way to set it off. I didn't buy Newman's Own dressing. I bought Bragg's all natural/organic Sesame and Ginger dressing.

Wow! This was great! I marinated the chicken overnight in the fridge, covered & baked it for about 40 mins. The chicken in itself was quite good, but in the salad it is just as good! I'm going to take some to my grandma right now :)
