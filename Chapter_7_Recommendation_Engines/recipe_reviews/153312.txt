This was good.  as suggested, added milk to thin out the sauce.  Also added additional ginger, red curry paste and red pepper flakes to the saute, and seasoned chicken with garam masala.  Used greek nonfat yogurt which gave the sauce a cheese-like richness without the guilt.  Would make again especially since the kids ate it too.

I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a good base recipe and I tweaked some things. First of all I substituted some red onions for the peppers. I used curry paste (I prefer it to powder). I also did not use so much chicken or garlic. I added garam masala to the chicken and I also added cilantro (love cilantro). I served it over jasmine rice. Delicious!

Family liked this one but I did make some changes. I added some red pepper flakes and a bit of cumin to spice it up. It was bland as written. Also added some milk and light cream to thin out. I used a roaster chicken shredded into the sauce to save on time and served it over rice.

My husband made this recipe and left out the bell peppers (because I don't care for them).  It tasted good and he said it was very easy to put together.  I'd recommend adding red pepper flakes or something to make it more spicy.  It's pretty mild, though good.

Very good except next time I will use smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy; the peanut pieces felt like I was biting into something dry and crunchy. I did as previously suggested, adding milk to thin the sauce, and red pepper flakes, ground ginger, salt, and pepper to season. I cooked whole chicken breasts on low in my crockpot and then shredded the chicken. Served over white rice.

Absolutely delicious and so easy. Instead of the peppers I used mushrooms and zucchini and came out amazing.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy to make and tasted great as a leftover as well.  However, the sauce was a bit too thick and grainy.  I added milk as other reviewers suggested, and while the sauce thinned out, it still had a coarse texture.  Perhaps it was the peanut butter that I used (JIF).

This was sooo easy and so healthy if you replace the PB with all natural PB and I used Greek Yogurt.  Easy 1 pan dish!  High in Protein and Low in Carbs.

This was such an easy recipe.  I added slivered carrots to the pepper/onion mix.  Also, I added two tablespoons of sweet chili sauce and a couple shakes of crushed red pepper.  After reading the previous reviews I too thinned the sauce with milk.  I topped it off with green onion.  My husband doesn't like spicy hot food, which is why I used the sweet chili sauce.  It was a good balance.  I used Sriracha hot chili sauce to top off my serving.  Very good, I'll definitely make this again.

I made it almost excactly how it said and I think it it amazing! I just added a little bit of milk at the end, because I like a little bit more sauce and the yogurt/peanut butter mix was a little thick.

I made this for dinner and its a keeper. I took the advise of many of the reviewers and added milk to the sauce to thin it out.  It works well with many different vegies. I didnt have a full cup of peppers so I added carrots, brocili, a potatoe, and cilentro. Has an exellent flavor. Thanks for the recipe. :)

This is a great base sauce but it could definitely use a flavor boost unless you're feeding it to people who prefer food that is tasty but bland. I added a really big squirt of sriracha hot sauce and soy sauce, and some rice vinegar to cut the peanut sauce a little bit. Fresh basil and coconut milk would make it a real Thai curry but I like the healthier choice of yogurt! To balance out the peanut sauce, try a squirt of lime juice over the top (not while cooking, the sauce will separate).

This was a yummy, easy meal.  I added about a tablespoon of milk to the sauce, which helped.  I also included a little ginger and some red pepper flakes to give it more kick.  And it needed a good bit of salt and pepper, but after that, it was great. Oh, and I added some extra pine nuts I had sitting around, which I toasted in the pan before sauteing the vegetables.  I would definitely make this again.

I've been looking for a tasty, easy to make curry/yogurt recipe for a while, so far most have disappointed. This one did not! it was very simple and delicious. I do recommend adding a little more kick, but that's just me

Tasty chicken recipe.  I added extra Curry and some Red Pepper Flakes....advise of other reviews.  I just used a couple 6oz Yoplit Vanilla Thick and Creamy yogurts...it's what I had on hand.  I wish I would have added a little milk to thin out the sauce, also, advise of other reviews, my hubby wanted it thick.  I poured this over noodles, next time I'll try rice.  I ommited the peppers as I don't care for them.  I will make this recipe again, but add even more Red Pepper and Curry and add the milk.

As is the recipe needs extra flavour but it is very easy to tweak to your taste so that is why it gets 3 stars. My family enjoyed it with slight alterations, it was fast enough to do for a busy weeknight meal and was very filling. I added extra garlic and some red curry paste . It also needed a splash of milk to thin out the sauce just because my all natural creamy peanut butter was far too thick.

After reading through some of the other reviews, I added a few red chili peppers, seeded and chopped, and 2t chopped fresh ginger to spice this recipe up a bit, and I used smooth peanut butter rather than crunchy.  For extra veges, I added 1 cup of cut-up fennel bulb.  I did not need to add any milk, as the sauce was just the right thickness.  Served it over brown rice.  It was ok, and we enjoyed it, but not enough to make me want to make it again.  Even with the extra spices, it was rather bland, and the sauce wasn't smooth because the yogurt curdled when mixed with the pan juices, making it grainy.

We really loved this recipe! I used 2 red bell peppers just because I don't like green peppers.  It was easy and delicious- and pretty healthy too! I served it over brown rice and we had green beans as a side.

this is a great dinner! The peanut sauce is almost addicting. I really like to put carrots in mine i think it goes good with the sauce. I also never seem to have bell peppers, and substitute it for cabbage which I think tastes great. I do add about a Tablespoon of sugar, it just seems like it needs a little sweet.

So good and so easy! I made a couple changes - I boiled my chicken first and then chopped it up and cooked it with the onion/curry mixture. We find chicken juicier that way. Also I skipped the peppers (we don't like them) and added shredded zucchini. I also doubled the sauce because we like things saucy. (added a bit of milk to thin it as well.) This recipe is so good and so easy, I'm adding it to a weekly favourite rotation! Thanks for sharing!

After reading reviews i changed a few things.  I added 2 tbs of curry and a cup of P butter, used chunky would use smooth next time.  Also I added a can of coconut milk and red pepper flakes.  I had yellow and red sweet peppers on hand so to add color I added peas I had on hand.

It's not that it tasted bad but I was expecting something fresh and spicy with a nutty base and instead this was quite bland, even with extra salt and pepper, extra garlic and a heavy helping of cumin. I probably won't be making this again.

This was easy to make and very tasty.  I used medium curry powder so it had a bit more kick.  My husband and I deemed it "a keeper".  We will definitely be having this again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it smelled great until we added the pnut butter. That totally overwhelmed the dish and basically for us ruined it.

Easy, fast, and yummy.  I will definitely make this again.  I used fat free yogurt, which may be why my sauce didn't come out too thick as others have described.  I altered slightly to our tastes by omitting onion and using onion powder instead and adding extra red peppers.  I also used smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy, but that was only because I didn't want to go buy a whole jar of it just for one recipe.  Next time I might add some cauliflower for variation and/or swap garam masala for curry powder to see how that tastes.

Very mild in flavor but satisfying.  My family enjoyed it.  Some did add a pinch of red crushed pepper to theirs while eating.  I would and will make again.

quick easy and yummy!  tastes like it's more complicated to make than it actually is  =).  i also added milk as the sauce was a bit too thick for my liking as well as red pepper flakes and chili powder for an added kick.

Definitely needs twice the curry, and some red pepper flakes I think.  Next time I would do just a bit less peanut butter and add some fresh peanuts to give it crunch.

This was really good! I added 1 tomato and only used red peppers. I also used not as much peanut butter (was out) and fat free yogurt (stirred in at the end so that it would not separate). Yummy and healthy!
