Not sure about the negative reviews on this one - it's a classic burger recipe.  I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner tonight (didn't thaw anything) so we went out and got a pound of hamburger and fired up the grill.  These were great and really hit the spot.  We poured a little beer over these while they were cooking (an old trick from my Dad) added a little ketchup, some pickles and a side of kettle cooked chips (oh and a couple of beers).

This is a great hamburger but isn't this just an all American typical burger? I really didn't need a recipe for this. As far as slicing the veggies thin and assembling it in a certain way being special, well that's nice....give me a big old slab of juicy tomato and a nice slice of vidalia, oh yeah, some barbeque sauce and relish and ketchup and pickles and ...I'm, getting carried away and my mouth is watering. Gotta go fire up the grill.

In response to those who thought it was so simple that a recipe was unnecessary...I'm so glad I saw this. I'm a novice cook, especially with meat, so this was what I needed. Some of us still need recipes for the simplest meals. And this one was both simple and delicious! I just added lots of Worchestershire.

We like to season our burgers up a bit with either seasoning salt, lemon pepper, black pepper or whatever we are in the mood for. We use either a Vidalia or a red onion, sliced thin, yummy! If you happen to be frying your hamburgers instead of grilling you can also use the same principle for the buns indoors, just place butter in a pan and lay your buns open side down in the hot pan. Lots of restaurants prepare their buns this way on their grills. Hubby likes to add bacon to his burgers, kids omit tomatoes. It's all good.

I'm trying to figure out why everyone came running for this recipe.  Seems pretty common and nothing special.  Dissappointing.

I have never made burgers before, this recipe was so easy, and they tasted so good.  My friends loved them and i served them with potato wedges and corn on the cob.  I will always use this recipe, Thanks!

Yum, a classic, simple to make cheeseburger.  My only change was using white American cheese, as that is what I had on hand.  We liked the toasted buns with the butter and mustard.  I prepared a small batch of 'Tangy White BBQ Sauce' from AR to go with the burgers and served cottage cheese and grilled corn in husk to complete the meal.

Simple or not! Communication, information & an open mind is key to any great cook. This is a classic for any family event or picnic. I recommend using charcoal over gas for that charcoal flavor. (glad you didn't add bread crumbs or anything else.) Simplicity can be great!

With all the different 'gourmet' hamburgers and toppings out there, it's nice to get back to just a classic cheeseburger! I added pickles and ketchup to mine (along with everything else). This is just all-American goodness-DELICIOUS! :)

/These were OK, I made mine too small so they looked like dinner rolls. LOL 
Anyway I thought they were too dense for hamburgers though.
