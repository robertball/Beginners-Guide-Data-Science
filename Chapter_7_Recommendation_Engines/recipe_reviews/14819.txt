There are many ways to improve this recipe.  I made a small batch following the recipe word for word, without any adjustments, and it came out rather bland and like others said, chewy.

Having read the reviews and taken them to heart, I only made a SMALL batch.  I then prepared another batch as follows: I seasoned the pretzels after chopping them in the blender for a minute or so.  Added garlic salt or powder (depending on whether your pretzels are already salty) and red peper flakes to the pretzels.  Then I added a dash or so of sriracha sauce (Thai hot sauce, so good!) to the half of the mustard mixture that I used for dredging my chicken to give it a little kick.  In order for them to be crispier as opposed to chewy, I sprayed the chicken with a cooking spray (reg or butter flavored) before placing them in the oven and then taking them out halfway, flipping the chicken over and spraying again.  I had the oven preheated at 350 and it took about 15 min. to cook the chicken.

Fantastic.  I made these for a Christmas gathering and everyone loved them!  One recommendation:  If making for children, use regular honey mustard over the dijon - depending on the brand, it can be spicy!

Not bad, the pretzels have a tendency to become more chewy than crisp.  The marinade without the pretzels is great though.

My whole family loved it. My daughter keeps asking for me to make it again. We had it as a main dish, but It will be a great appetizer for any party.  I think I would double the recipe for the dipping sauce. We ran out and still had some chicken left. A+

Excellent! Different than regular cracker or breadcrumb coatings. For those complaining of chewy or soggy coatings, it will be crispier if you use the thick, hard, sourdough pretzels. Regular pretzels will absorb too much liquid.

I had an Oscar night gathering and tried this recipe as a starter.  I was lucky I printed off a copy of my own, because before the night was over 12 guests had copied it for themselves.  The only problem was my 5-year-old daughter had to pick off the pretzels, because she said they hurt her mouth.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and tasted great. I didnt crush the pretzels into crumbs I left bigger pieces and I think that added to the texture. I also added mayo to the mustard mixture to make more of a honey mustard. The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

I used this as a main dish, and it was quite yummy.  I scaled the recipe to 8 servings, so it didn't seem like too much work since it was only 2 chicken breast halves. I did need twice the sauce and twice the pretzels though.  The pretzels & sauce worked well together & added a nice "zing" to the chicken.  I will keep this one.

When the chicken first came out of the oven it was okay but, after a few minutes it was chewy. I brought this to my Xmas party and it didn't go over to well. I should have made this once before, before taking it. Sorry, I hate to give bad reviews but it just didn't work out well.

This took a little longer to prepare than I had hoped, and my kids thought it was a little too "spicy".  My husband and I enjoyed it, though, and we ate it all up.

My guys were skeptical, but thought it was pretty good. I increased the amount of garlic and cayenne to account for our personal tastes. The pretzel coating did turn out more chewy than crunchy which was a bit of a disappointment. It ended up being 15 minutes to cook the chicken but my pieces may have been thicker than what was originally used. All in all it was a quick tasty main dish which I served with tater tots and veggies on the side. Not bad.

I used honey mustard (since I prefer that over dijon) and some crushed red pepper.  I didn't cut the chicken up very small and I flipped it halfway through the baking time.  I received high compliments for this!

These were OK. I wasn't a huge fan of the pretzel taste, but they went over better with my friends.

We did not like the pretzels. Luckily we had decided to make half the chicken with pretzels and the other half using crushed Ritz crackers, just in case. The crackers turned out much better.

The "sauce" just tasted like mustard, and the pretzel chunks made the chicken taste dry.  I wouldnt make these again.

By eyeballing the recipe I knew that it was going to be too bland for our taste, so I used it as more of a guide than following word for word.

I have several picky eaters and they all loved this recipe. I did try with the sourdough pretzels, crackers and baked with just the sauce. Crackers were soggy but both sourdough pretzels and baked in sauce were favorites. I do prefer less spicy, used half honey mustard and half Dijon.

I liked this very much.  Bf said it was all right, which is high praise indeed from him on something that contains mustard!  I used this recipe because I had pretzels I wanted to get rid of.  I still have some more pretzels, so I'll make it again with pretzels just to use them up.  However, I think that it would be better with breadcrumbs.  The pretzels get a little soggy and I don't think add that much to the dish.  I also won't set aside any of the mustard sauce for dipping, either.  Dijon mustard is such an intense flavor I don't think it needs to be dipped or sprinkled on after it's alreay been saturated on the chicken.  I used a plastic ziploc bag to mix the chicken and pretzels, and it worked well.

I doubled the sauce recipe. 
I also marinated the chicken in 2/3 of the sauce overnight and used a honey mustard and dijon mustard combo so the flavor wouldn't be too strong for the kids.
These were loved by everyone and will make these many more times to come!!!!
