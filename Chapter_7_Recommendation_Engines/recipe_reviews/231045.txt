This was a really nice easy quick meal for one of those nights you don't really feel like cooking. I didn't have white kidney beans so used black eyed peas instead and whole wheat rotini noodles. I only had one green pepper so also put in a nice seeded jalapeno pepper. I made it all in one pot, made the noodles first and put in a strainer and then made the rest in the same pot, added the noodles back in. Topped with cheese, sour cream and creamy avocados. Filled our bellies and it is actually pretty healthy to boot.

One of our summertime family favorites. We are garlic lovers and add a little Chili Garlic seasoning and a little heat. We like the added extra of knowing when we can save on the ingredients from here and at www.frugalharbor.com. Just makes it that much better.
