I made 4 pork chops and used 8oz of Russian dressing.  My husband and I thought this was excellent.  The chops were nice and tender and my son even gave it 4 stars.  This is really sweet but we enjoyed it more than other "sweet" recipes we have tried.

Pretty good! This recipe tastes surprisingly homey - I think I expected a very exotic flavor.  The effect is somewhere between a very subtle barbeque sauce and a fruity teriyaki or sweet & sour.  This went together in a minute, and came out perfect in an hour.  My family says they could go for this every couple of weeks or so - I'm going to try on boneless skinless chicken thighs, too.  ** I used a light catalina dressing, and it didn't lose any flavor.

5 stars from a family of picky eaters?!?  No way!  WAY!  So tender and flavorful that even my 18 month old, who won't consider eating anything but bread, couldn't get enough.  Make this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This pork chop recipe was a pleasant change from the cream of mushroom soup fare. I found them to be more sweet than sour, so in order to tone down the sweetness, I added 2T of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon of distilled vinegar. Thanks Katie.

Very good recipe for 'something different' from the norm' rut and routine.  I did not have the 1oz. of onion soup mix (but according to other reviews I didn't want that 'overpowering flavor' competing).  I did however use 1 T. of dried onion and 1 t. onion powder.  My bottle of russian dressing was only 10oz.  The sauce this makes tastes so very wonderful (sweet and sour chinese like) over my rice cooker's sticky rice!  IF my husband and son weren't opposed I would of added onions, mushrooms and maybe bell pepper diced into the 'gravy' and let the flavors meld in the oven.  This recipe is number one on the 'super easy to put together' list for sure!!!  Thanks for submitting this recipe, it will go into the mix for future use. :)

I really liked this recipe. It wasn't quite as sweet as I feared, which is a good thing.  I noticed some of the past reviews complained about a lack of taste or seasoning.  This recipe produces is a very subtle-tasting sauce, which I think is just right for pork chops.  Lets the taste of the meat come through.

We love this with pork chops and with chicken breasts.  To cut the sweet experience you can serve with sides of rice and steamed broccoli or an Asian salad with cabbage, or with egg rolls and even dip them in the sauce.

This is such a good recipie and so easy to make! I added 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper and 1/2 cup of red onion. Even my 3 year old loved it! The sauce is great on rice also.

Delicious! I chopped sweet onion and green bell pepper and added it to the sauce. I also used an egg wash and flour and lightly browned the chops before I put in oven. I served it with veggie fried rice and a pineapple gin and juice made with freshly juiced pineapple and mandarins. YUMMY!

These were very good. I mixed up the sauce early in the day so the flavors would blend.  I baked them covered in the oven at 300 for about a half hour then bumped up the heat to 350 and uncovered them for another half hour. Sauce was nice and thick and chops tender.  Will make again.

Made this for dinner tonight. We only had apricot/pineapple preserves so  used that. Also I added veggies to the mix...baby carrots, green peppers, big chucks of onions and chunk pineapple. We had white rice with this, and put the juice over the rice. Only thing I would do next time is add some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. Thank you for the recipe!!

This was soooo good. I used catilina instead of russian though. Served the pork over rice drizzled with the watery sauce left in the pan, my sides were greenbeans and Pork flavored stuffing. I had made enough for seconds and there was only enough left for a small chop over a little rice the next day. Of which I hide and nabbed first thing in the morning! I honestly thought it was even better the next day! The meat had soaked it up real good by the morning!

Easy to make and tastes great.  Like other reviewers, I used Catalina dressing instead of Russian because that's what I had on hand.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper and browned pork chops before baking.  They turned out very tender, moist, and tasty.  Loved it.

This is a really good recipe. I made it almost a directed. I had an 8oz. bottle of Russian dressing so I used that. Also I browned 3 thick cut frozen chops in butter in a pan and seasoned them with salt,pepper,garlic powder and onion powder. I fry chops from frozen because it makes for more tender chops. i baked them for 45 minutes because they were partially dun from the pan frying. Totally awesome recipe. We loved it and will have it again. Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good. I used a whole jar of pineapple-apricot preserves. I thought the sauce tasted sort of sweet and sour/bbq like. Served it over white rice and broccoli on the side. My family enjoyed it and it was quite easy to put together. Perfect for a week night gotta throw something together quick dinner.

This fantastic recipe can be even more delicioso.
Add:  green olives (15 -20)
         chopped onion (1/2 to whole sweet onion)
         1 green pepper
         1 red pepper
         mushrooms (as many as you want!)
Saute these veggies in a tad of olive oil for five minutes, then pour them in the sauce; then pour the sauce over the pork. (Make sure your casserole dish is large enough). 
      By the way, this exact same sauce with veggies added to it, is absolutely wonderful over pot roast!

The flavor was great.  I served it over brown rice and the sauce was great on the rice.  My chops were a little tough.  I think next time I will try this is the slow cooker.

Nice recipe & so easy.  The taste is somewhere between sweet & sour and bbq.  I added a little orange juice to the mixture and also used a pork roast, not chops.  Browned the roast and seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper & a little sage prior to baking in the sauce. I think it would be great to use as a marinade for grilled chicken.  Next time I will use as a marinade prior to cooking and grill instead of bake. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy.  I use with chicken breasts since my daughter does not like pork.  This is so easy on busy nights.

PERFECT, just as is.  Lovely taste, and quite possibly the easiest recipe I've ever seen for a dinner entree.  So long as you like a good blend of sweet and savory, you will LOVE this recipe.  And seriously, it's soooo easy...

I followed this recipe but I put it in the slow cooker.  I thought it was ok after you get past the first few bites.  I'm giving it a 4 star because I thought it was just ok but my husband loved it - says he wants me to make it again.

This turned out really good. I doubled the recipe making 12 chops. I also took the advise and added 1 chopped onion and 1 sliced bell pepper. I also seasoned the chops with salt and pepper and garlic powder then I browned them in a skillet and tossed everything into my slow cooker for 4 hours. Very tastey and tender, they fell apart.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for a long time, and it's a hit with my family every time I make it. It is similar to sweet and sour pork, but so much easier, and the sauce is delicious over rice. I use fat-free Catalina dressing and instead of apricot preserves, I use a small can of pineapple tidbits. Sometimes, I add some bell pepper strips. Best of all, I throw it all in the crockpot for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Serve it with packaged fried rice (like Rice-A-Roni) and steamed veggies. Fast, easy, cheap, and good!

Do not ruin your pork. The taste was nowhere near good.  We had to rinse the pork off and pour liberal quantities of soy sauce onto it to keep the taste down.

My husband's aunt has been using this recipe except on chicken for years. I didn't like it as well on pork but the kids ate it well.

We made this recipe with no changes, and everyone LOVED it! The only thing I'll change next time is maybe add some red pepper flakes for some heat.

I thought this was great.  It was very easy and my husband liked it, which says a lot since he usually hates pork.  I didn't have the dressing so I made some with catchup and mayo and it worked fine.

Just made this tonight, loved it. Also rice is a must for the extra sauce to soak up. Not to sweet but just enough.

I made this for dinner and I followed the recipe except I didnt add the dry onion soup mix , I added onion salt, onion powder and galric powder to substitue for the dry onion soup that I didnt have. I also added thinly slice onions on top of the chops before I poured the apriot mix on top. It was a hit even though it was watery. I don't know how to avoid this the next time. .But my family loved it and I just served it with white rice and corn bread. I will make this again. But I think next time I'm going to fry the chops to avoid the watery chops. lol thanks for the recipe

We all loved this!! my 9 and 5  year old  really enjoyed the pork chops, my 5 year old is rather a picky eater, so this is a keeper!  I didn't have russian dressing so I used catalina and peach preserves, added some soya sauce and a tiny bit of vinegar, the sauce was nice and sticky yum!!!  We didn't have rice, so we had it with mashed potatoes, this quick was soooo easy....love it!!

I never would have put this combination of flavors together, but it really does work. The only thing I would change is that I would cook the sauce and the pork separately. I felt like the sauce "came apart" a bit after baking.

This was edible but not great. I prepared the dish exactly as written. The flavor was too weird and artificial. The flavor basically gave away that I was feeling lazy that day and wanted to whip something up real quick to get it over with. Not good.

I did this in the slow cooker today for 4 hours. I took a suggestion from another user and used pineapple instead of apricot. My husband said I was authorized to make it again (which means he likes it in my house) and kids loved it. 

Next time I will try it with the apricot. 

I served this over rice with spinach as a side.

This recipe is delicious! For a little more sweet flavour, try using crushed pineapple instead of apricot preserves.

This was really yummy. I made some modifications, using 2 pork chops: 1/3 cup apricot and pineapple preserves; 3 oz tomato sauce; and 1 tbsp onion powder. After I mixed and poured the sauce on the pork chops, I added one dollop of the apricot and pineapple preserves on top of the pork chops. It turned out delicious - both my husband and I loved it. This recipe is going in my recipe book!

Very easy recipe and the kids did love it. I thought it was a little sweet, maybe use a light Russian dressings, and 1/2 the pack of onion mix.

Love this recipe. I have used both french and catalina dressing, and they work great.  I have also substituted peach jam for apricot.  I usually make this dish with rice, so I can spoon the sauce on top.  Very goood!

Nice change for pork chops. For better flavor season (salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc.) the pork chops and brown on each side (approx. 3 min per side in a little olive oil) before placing in baking pan. You can then reduce baking time to approximately 35 minutes or so. I sometimes add a splash of soy sauce to the mixture as well as a minced garlic clove. We use this same amount of sauce for 4 generous sized boneless chops as well. I like Catalina dressing for a spicier dish rather than Russian. Great over a bed of white rice.

I used the Russian style salad dressing recipe on this site, and no onion soup mix. I made it for my wife's bday surprise dinner, we had six 8 oz chops.  All around a very simple recipe to make in about a total of an hour and 20 minutes, and surprisingly delicious.

This recipe made a great base, but it needed perking up for a little more flavor.  I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder first.  Then I browned the chops in olive oil, adding a diced onion, and half a finely diced green bell pepper.  To the sauce mixture, I added a liberal squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and a little white wine.  After adding the mixture to the chops, I baked as directed.  And it was absolutely delicious served with rice and steamed broccoli.

I never made this recipe as stated, but I really like the idea. I didn't change it too much. What I did was use a pork tenderloin (I use anywhere from a 2-1 lbs but you can go bigger or smaller just adjust the cooking time.) I take a 1/2 tbsp sesame oil and 1/2 tbs Olive oil and warm in a nonstick pan over the stove. I spice the pork loin with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a few red pepper flakes. Then I brown the pork loin on all sides very quickly. While I am browning I warm up the over to at least 350, mix 1/2 packet onion soup mix, 8 ozs of apricot preserves, and 8-10ozs of french dressing, 1tsp sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. I put the pork loin in a foil lined pan, pour the sauce over it, and then wrap the foil around the pork tight. I cook 2/3 baking time covered, and 1/3 uncovered. Like I said about cooking times you will have to ajust the cooking times to your size pork loin.

My 1 lb. of boneless chops were cut 1/2 inch thick and they were a little overdone in 30 minutes (thickness of chops relates to cooking time, so there can be a great deal of variation - and I think that may be the cause of some of the other reviewers' dissatisfaction).  I used 1/2 the sauce recipe on 1 lb of meat and there was plenty to go over brown rice.  I used russian and pineapple-apricot preserves (some other reviewers suggest variations, so that's mine).  Not "the best", but very good; will repeat.

My husband is not a "sauce" person but likes this recipe.  I add rice as a side and pour the sauce on it.  I have used chicken too and it's great!

This was super easy to make and pretty tasty.  I can't say that it was my favorite dish in the world, but for a basic, fast and easy pork dish, it did the trick.  It gets four stars because of ease and because my kids and Mom liked it!  I served it with rice.  The sauce would certainly work on chicken as well.  I used the light Catalina like some others, but might try the Russian next time to see how that changes the taste.

My husband really liked this recipe, but I didn't care much for it.  Maybe it was the brand of onion soup mix we used, but I thought it didn't complement the apricot very well.

Excellent!  I first browned the pork, as others recommended, and only cooked for about 40 minutes (will decrease by about 10 minutes next time).  Will also try adding grilled pineapple, snap peas, carrots and onions for a sweet-and-sour pork.

Didnt have onion soup mix so I used onion powder, garlic salt, and sweet honey catalina dressing. I used 10 thin sliced boneless chops. It was excellent. Reminds me of sweet and sour pork but not as blah. You could add peppers and call it an asian dish. Best with the rice! Something different to do with a pork chop.

This is superb!  I hate pork, but my husband and children love it.  I was in a hurry, looking for a change of pace that I could make quickly, and found it!  Want to hear the biggest compliment of all?  I ate 2 chops!  To top it off, it's on our menu for next week again.  Wonderful combination of ingredients, and my kids gobbled it up.  Finally, a pork recipe that I can enjoy with my family.

I seem to be one of the few middle-of-the-road reviewers, and truly I was expecting to either love or hate this. As it stands, neither. The smell while cooking is amazing, and they're very pretty. But the flavor is just a little off to me - it could be that maybe I just don't like onion soup in recipes. Ironic, because I am the only one in my family who loves onions. But this is the 2nd pork chop recipe I've tried which uses soup mix, and I have to say, I won't be trying any more. But, I might possibly try this again w/out the mix - I made a homemade russian dressing, and really liked it with the apricot preserves and definitely don't feel the onion added anything anyway.

I love sweet and savory. Thats what this is. Delish. Thanks to the AR people from here, I made my own dry onion soup mix.[dried minced onions, beef boullion, garlic powder, and onion powder,[pepper] I made this along side 'easy mushroom rice,' and they were done at the same time. Love it!

I really liked this recipe.  I used Catalina dressing since russian is not available in my area.  I used more apricot preserves than it called for and if I was to do it again, I would reduce the amount of catalina dessing to 6 ounces.

I've been using this recipe with chicken for years and never thought about using it with pork chops -- it was delicious!  However, I use an entire jar of apricot preserves to balance the tanginess of the Russian dressing.  And you don't need the full amount of the sauce for this many pork chops -- use half and save the other half for another meal.  It keeps well for quite a while in the fridge.

I only used a cup of the salad dressing and it was too overpowering. None of the apricot flavor came through. All five of us did not find this worth repeating. But, to be fair, I did use the crock pot and do not recommend it. It adds too much moisture and dilutes the sauce way to much. It was not even worth using.

Yummy! I used really thick pork chops and they turned out really moist and tender.  I also added some fresh onions just because I had them.  It turned out really flavorful.

I made this last night and my Husband enjoyed it very much. I used thousand island dressing and peach/apricot saucy susan with the onion soup mix and it came out very tasty. I made it with rice and some of the sauce from the pork chops ran into the rice, it was a good mix. I will make this again, probably once a month!

This was actually pretty good. I did use Catalina dressing instead of the Russian style dressing. The only thing I will try differently next time is only using 1/2 the onion soup mix. I thought that the flavor of the soup mix over-powered everything else. Otherwise, my husband and daughter thought they were great. We served with white rice and fresh green beans. It was a very satisfying and EASY meal. Thanks for the post!

This is an easy/quick recipe.  However, my family didn't care for the taste of the Russian dressing.  I think next time I will take the advice from some other reviewers and try Catalina dressing instead.

Really, really good! I didn't have any Russian dressing so made my own from an entry on Allrecipes. I used Knott's 100% Fruit spreadable apricot, so it was sweet, but not too sweet. The pork chops were  moist and very tender. Thanks, Katie!

This is a super easy and tasty recipe that can also be used with chicken breasts. Keep the ingredients in your pantry and you'll never have to wonder what's for dinner.

This was good.  I added some salt and pepper before putting the sauce on just for added flavor.  My husband thought they were good but lacked something.  I served with rice.  I might make these again since it was quick to make.

I tried this recipe, and found it somewhat lacking in flavor.  The recipe does not specify what type of chops to use, or the thickness.  I used bone in, about and inch thick, and they came out dry.  Not tough, exactly, but just not tender.  The glaze is mediocre in flavor.  It's not bad, it's just not very exciting.  Per haps broiling the chops for a few minutes right at the end would help to carmelize the apricot preserves, giving a nice, thick sweet glaze, which is not what you get when you follow the recipe.  It's more like an apricot sauce than a glaze.  Go ahead and try this recipe, it's quick and easy and tastes ok.  I probably won't cook it again, though.

This recipe was fast, easy and delicious. This is coming from a person who has a hard time boiling water. Believe me, ANYONE could make this pork chop recipe. I too could not find Russian dressing and used Catalina instead. It turned out great. I served it with rice and buttery cooked carrots (also found on allrecipes) for a great meal. Next time I may try using pork loins instead of chops and fat free/light catalina dressing to cut down on fat. If you are a little rusty in the kitchen, this is a great recipe to start with!

This dinner was great. Both picky kids and my husband enjoyed it. Super easy and fast. I did add 1 tbls soy sauce because I had read other reviews that it was a little too sweet and it turned out perfect.

These were ok for us. I used light thousand island dressing and low sugar apricot preserves, and just four pork chops. The sauce did this odd combo of congealing in places but also becoming watery. It was  edible, but the onion soup mix was definitely the most prevalent flavor. Probably won't make it again. Thanks for sharing, anyway!

Husband liked it, kids thought ok, but didn't eat too much. I had to make my own Russian dressing, and only had 1/2 packet onion soup mix and 1/2 amount of apricot preserve to make recipe. I liked it and saving recipe for future use. Nice to know I can replace pork with chicken. I think would work well in crockpot.

This recipe is definately a keeper!  I cubed a boneless pork loin and cooked it on the stovetop in the sauce.  Since it is a sweet and sour sauce, I added a can of water chestnuts, a container of fresh sliced mushrooms and some sprouts.  Served it over rice and it was delicious!!

This was an excellent recipe! The sauce was delicious! However, my family loves spicy food so I added three cloves of garlic grated, half a teaspoon of red chilli powder, and 3 to 4 chopped up scallions only the green parts. This combination gave the sauce a little kick.

I have made a very similar recipe, Apricot Chicken(using both white and dark chicken and with skin on and off).  This recipe has been in my family for as long as I can remember. It calls for 1 packages of onion soup mix, 1 bottle of apricot jam, 1 bottle of Russian Salad Dressing and 1/2 cup water. The chicken is baked at 350 for 1 hour and served with rice.  Yum!

This recipe got an all thumbs up from all of my children!  I had to substitute the Russian dressing for a bottle of Western dressing as our store doesn't carry the Russian dressing.  It still worked out beautifully!  I'm going to attempt this recipe in the slow cooker and add some chunk pineapple to serve over a bed of rice. But I highly recommend this recipe!

I got this recipe a couple of years ago. It is a good recipe to make when you don't have a lot of time, just throw it all together and in the oven it goes.  Not out of this world but a good dish to make during the week.

This was really great!  I was suprised how good it was for being so simple.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly but you really can improvise a lot with this one.  I ran low on apricot pres. so I filled in with orange marmalade.  Also, I only had a little bit of Western dressing so I just added what I had and used a bit more marmalade to make enough.  I also put in a couple tbls. of lemon juice since I used so much sweet stuff.  This would be great over rice and veggies as a stir fry.  My husband doesn't like sweet stuff and he even thought is was great.  He suggested a little more spice so I thought of using a little ginger with it next time.  I am so glad I tried this it was really wonderful.

WOW!  I didn't think I even liked pork chops before this!  Love it - will do this one again and again!  (I used twice as much preserves - it was yummy!)

The chops were real tasty and it was a breeze to prepare. I would recommend less Russian dressing and more apicot.

This is VERY EASY and very TASTY. I've made it twice now for my boyfriend and I and it's become a huge hit.  My mother who's made the same pork-chop recipe for years tried it and LOVED it. A MUST TRY!

I put this in the crock pot on low for six hours with frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I added some red pepper flakes. My husband kept coming over to investigate the wonderful smell coming from the pot, and dipped into it before I even came home.  I served it with a stir-fry of peppers, onions, carrots, waterchestnuts, peapods, almonds and steamed rice.  Very good for fans of sweet and sour Chinese food.  Next time I'll try with turkey and a can of cranberry sauce or with chicken dark meat and orange marmelade.

A different twist, but not my favorite.  I will make it again just for a change.  The Awesome Honey & Pecan Pork Chops rated higher in my opionion, but I always need a change.

Quick and easy prep with simple ingredients. Turns out tender and delicious pork chops with a sweet sauce (not "gourmet" or complex, but good). The whole family liked them, and here's my tips:
1- use thick pork chops (I used thin) 
2- I had too much sauce, so next time I'll go with -- 8 oz. russian dressing and 6 oz. apricot preserves. We threw away a pan full of sauce that wasn't used.
Good option for the usual pork chops to make them more flavorful and interesting!

I've always used this recipe for chicken in my crock pot. It also makes an amazing sauce for meatballs! I serve them with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Tonight I'm trying it with pork chops and I'm pretty excited because I already know how much my family loves the flavor of the sauce.

I just made these. I read previous reviews and made the following changes, Added two tsp of soy sauce and one of white vingear. I also used thousand island salad dressing as I read online it is the closest to Russian dressing. I cook them for only 45 mins. I wasnt impressed. The taste was weird, hard to describe. I will not be making these again.

These were really good! The kids loved them. They were more sweet and sour than apricot flavored which is good because my husband wouldn't have liked them too fruity.

This is delicious with chicken, too, bake at 350 one hour, covered, and another 30 minutes, uncovered. Next time I will try with the from-scratch thousand island dressing from allrecipes.com. Yum.

I chose this recipe to prepare for a dinner party...14 guests...because I could prep ahead and do it in the oven.  It was a big success and so easy!  I do prefer the Catalina dressing however for a tangier flavor.

Very intersting flavor. Both of my picky sons liked it, although one did scrape off some of the extra onion soup mix. Pretty easy with the flavor of slaving over an oven.

Family loves them!!
Its so hard to find milk free recipes so my family eats pretty bland most days but this is milk free and YUMMY.
Nice to have a change of pace with pork chops :)
I accidently bought pinapple apricot preserves and it was very yummy.
Thanks

This was quick and easy, but my husband thought it was just ok, and I really didn't like it. I think its the onion mix that I didn't like in it. This is surprising because I use onion mix in a lot of recipes.

This is a delicious, easy, saucy recipe. It's also terrific on boneless, skinless chicken breasts!

Excellent!  I used Apricot pineapple preserves and found a recipe and made the Russian dressing from scratch and it was very good.  My husband even said he loved it.  Definitely something that will be made again.  ??

I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious! Pork chops were tender and sauce was delicious- not too sweet.  Served with broccoli and veggie rice.... yum!

I love the taste of it..I used Catalina dressing since I couldn’t find Russian dressing..it tastes almost like sweet and sour..my 13yr old who’s picky asked what the sauce was and said it’s different..he gave it 2 thumbs up..I didn’t do anything different to the recipe and followed as is..it’s delicious

kinda sweet. I feel like the sauce could have used something more. The cook time was a little long and the meat was a bit tough. I'd go a shorter next time, maybe 35 minutes.

I HAVE USED THIS RECEIPE FOR YEARS, BUT WHEN I HAVE MADE IT I USE OTHER INGREDIENTS ALSO.    I USE CHICKEN, OR SHRIMP OR THE PORK CHOPS AND CALL IT SWEET AND SOUR PORK CHOPS ETC.    I ALSO USE PINEAPPLE CHUNKS, MUSHROOMS, CELERY, ONION, CARROTS AND WATER CHESTNUTS , BAMBOO SHOTS, SWEET PICKLES AND MACHINO CHERRIES .    THIS MAKES IT A ONE MEAL IN A DISH.    MY FAMILY ASK FOR IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE DIFFERENT MEAT CHOICES OR SEAFOOD CHOICES.   I ALSO SERVE IT OVER RICE WITH CHINESE NOODLES FOR THE CRUNCH.   I ALSO BAKE IT IN THE OVEN AT 375  FOR 1 HOUR.   THE OTHER INGREDIENTS ARE POURED OVER YOUR RICE SO YOU GET THE SAUCE AND VEGGIES.

The flavor profile was off. I don't know if it was the onion soup mix or the Russian dressing that clashed with the apricot preserves, but it was not good. We had to add can of diced stewed tomatoes at the end and let it cook an additional 15 minutes to cut the intensity and make it somewhat edible.

Very good recipe, nice blend between sweet and tangy!  My picky teen generally won't eat any meats with sauce or breading, but wolfed this down after 1 bite!  Next time, we want to try it, as some of the other reviewers say, with some peppers or onion.

I made this tonight and it was very good-my husband said he definitely wants me to make it again.  I cut the recipe in half as I was only making 2 large pork chops.  I used Kraft Zesty Catalina instead of the Russian dressing, as I had it in my pantry.  It worked very well and I served the sauce over noodles. Can't wait to have it again!

My very picky eaters ask for seconds. I used light catalina and it was still very tasty.  Perfect to put in the oven, carpool to practices, add quinoa and carrots, dinner is done.

Very yummy, Very easy, Very quick....what more could you ask for?  I was really surprised at how good these were.  Recipe doesn't call for tons of ingredients, so it doesn't take long to throw together, a big plus in my book!
