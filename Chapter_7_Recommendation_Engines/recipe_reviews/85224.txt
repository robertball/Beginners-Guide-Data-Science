Yummy and perfect. My only suggestion is to make sure you use Pam on the pan otherwise it will stick. But, overall it was great!

Wow are these good!  And really easy to make.  Very subtly sweet with just a hint of heat.  I did try making a second batch using Splenda.  Don't try it!  Not nearly as good!  Will use these on my Christmas gift trays this year.

I burned these a bit, but they were still pretty good! Will try again, minus a few minutes.

These are AWESOME !!!  I made them for Christmas and my Husband almost finished the first batch so I made double the recipe and everyone loved them.  Gave my Sister the recipe because my Niece wanted to take a batch back to college with her.  The only change I made was to cook the walnuts on parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet.

These are delicious! I use them on salads and stand alone snacks. They also make a great gift in a pretty tin or jar.

Since I found this recipe, I've made it for every party we have. My guests love it.  I've also tried it with pecans which is just as tasty.  Yum!
