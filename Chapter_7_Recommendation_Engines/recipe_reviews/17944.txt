Very good pie the only thing is I used a spiced rum need to use a milder rum without so many extra flavors so the egg nog flavor isn't over shadowed

Made it exactly as the recipe said, was basically vanilla pudding with rum flavor. Very disappointing. Made it again using eggnog instead of milk and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend the eggnog variation.
