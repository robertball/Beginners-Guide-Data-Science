Okay, now I didn't doctor this much ... just by necessity:  I didn't have cream so I used canned evaporated milk, as I often do in a pinch.  (That's why I keep it in the house.)  The first time I made it I just decided on it at the last minute as a way to use the pork I had thawed - huge hit.  HUGE.  Tonight I needed inspiration for dinner ... and no thawed pork ... so I made this with chicken.  Again, huge hit.  REALLY huge.  Will become a staple.  And yes, I use vermouth.  This recipe is a good reason to keep it in the house.

This is so quick and easy. I substitute red wine for the vermouth (only because I don't keep vermouth on hand)and use WAY less allspice- between 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. The flavor is delicious. I like to serve it with buttered noodles and peas. Great for a weeknight dinner.

Great recipe.  Very tasty.  I also used garlic with the butter when browning the pork and subsituted red wine for vermouth as the earlier suggested, but I did not add any onions or tomatoes.  After I added the cream and mustard I let the mixture simmer about another 15 min to further reduce it.  Served it over egg noodles and it was great!  Thanks.

I couldn't wait to make this recipe - I love mustard sauces...but this was a disappointment.  It should have been called Pork with Allspice Sauce.  You better really like the taste of allspice to appreciate this - or I would suggest adding it in small quantities and adjust to taste.

Very good!  This came together so quickly and tasted very gourmet.  I used savignon blanc instead of vermouth and dijon mustard instead of yellow.  I also just used a T of honey instead of honey mustard.  And, I used more like 1 pound of pork.  I served over egg noodles.  It doesn't make a ton of sauce but I wasn't expecting it to be 'saucy', just a nice drizzle of sauce over each serving.

Modified this recipe after reading comments. Doubled the sauce recipe, adding twice the lime juice and leaving out the allspice. I added other seasoning I like instead. I used a red wine instead of Vermouth because that's what I had. I also added Panko to my flour. Served over noodles. IT WAS AWESOME! I will be coming back to this recipe many more times! Thanks

I've made this several times and it turns out great every time! The layers of flavor work well together.  The allspice and mustard balance each other beautifully, and the rest pull it all together.  I wouldn't change a single ingredient.

THIS ROCKED!  I'm always looking for pork recipes, as its so cheap that we eat it often. This was a fabulous experience for the tastebuds... perfect amount of sweet and flavor. Mmmmmm! Will make again and again! Thank you!!! Oh! I almost forgot... I substituted evaporated milk for whipping cream and it was wonderful.

This was really good; I'll make it again but will add fresh garlic next time.  Also, don't forget the salt!  It needs it!  It wasn't saucy, which I was expecting it to be (so I used 8oz of whipping cream rather than 4 oz).  I would also like about 1/4 cup of lime juice vs. 1 T.  I just made my own honey mustard with about 1 tsp of mustard and 1 T honey.  Served over egg noodles.  I think it would also be good to brown the entire tenderloin in a pan, bake it in the oven, slice it and serve the sauce oven.  It was a lot of work dredging in flour and pan frying 2 batches.

Delicious loved this recipes.
Made a few changes for I didn't have the ingredients listed.
1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream
Crisp apple wine instead of vermouth
Lemon juice instead of lime
My family loved this recipe, served with mashed potato and southwestern veggies. This was very easy to make.

This turned out very good, and seems so much more high class than the crockpot style I usually cook pork tenderloin. I altered a little, as I just used what I had. Half and half instead of cream, spicy yellow and regular yellow mustard instead of honey, all chicken broth didn't have any kind of booze in the house, and I made my own all spice.. I had the 3 parts of it. Only thing I added was corn starch as other reviewers said would thicken up the sauce.. it did. My picky husband loved it and thought I may have bought it and threw some pans in the sink! Really yummy!

I actually baked the pork chops first in the oven with shake and bake.  Then made the sauce as calls for in the recipe and just drizzled over the top when done.  It was awesome, and a really quick dinner option!!!!

It's always interesting (and appreciated) to find a recipe made for two people!  I did cook it as the recipe stated except when it came to the allspice.  I added about a half of that, knowing that allspice can be very strong---and I was glad I did.  I had zested the lime before I used it, so I just added that to the sauce instead.  There was enough sauce left to add some over rice (if I had I made any--which I will next time).  We did think that we would have this dish again!  I must add that it is much easier to cut pork tenderloin when it is just thawing because otherwise it is very unwielding!  Thank you very much for the recipe!

The mustard gave it a bit of a tang that was very good in taste. I added a few things and it was really excellent. (1.) I used boneless pork chops and cut them in strips about 1/4 inch wide. (2.) I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the butter before adding the pork. (3.) I didn't have any burgundy so I used red wine instead. (4.) I added a diced medium onion to the wine and let that cook. (5.) Before returning the pork back to the skillet, I added a can of diced petite tomatoes. It really turned out great and everyone that ate it just loved it. I had no leftovers at all. The next time that I make this I will add some celery and green peppers to it also.

A restaurant quality meal for which I would gladly purchase. The blend of ingredients highlighted by the allspice brings out a level of flavors easily enjoyed by those with a more sophisticated palate. A definite home run!

No substitutions to ingredients, measurements were followed. Thank you for posting this. (Jack)

Did not coat with flour, just salt and pepper.  Sauted a shallot in butter first.  Subbed red wine for vermouth per other reviews, used dijon instead of yellow mustard and 1/2 Tbsp honey for the honey mustard and added peas at the end.  This was amazing.  I licked the plate.

So...we liked it. Didn't love it-but it was something different and it was good. Only change I made was light cream because that's what I had and I used lemon because I didn't have lime. Drastic change? No, I don't think so...the vermouth surprised me-good! Use it!! You have to like mustard...and allspice. I am on the fence about the allspice. It's a weird one for me. I won't make this again BUT I will play with this and change it up to try to improve it for our family. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!!!  We didn't have honey mustard on hand so just used Dijon in place of both mustard measurements.  Warning - when the vermouth went in, it did not smell great but that all burned off and the flavor was wonderful!!!!  We had it on date night as wasn't sure if it was for a Kid's palate.  I would serve this to company.  We had it with baked potato.  Also, I used very thin pork chops.

Sooooo good and even my picky boys loved it! Only thing my husband commented on was that he thought it needed salt but I thought it w a s absolutely perfect. I read other comments on using half the all spice which worked because it tasted of the perfect amount of it.
 Can't wait to make again.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and let me tell you, this is gold.  I am not a huge fan of pork usually, but I love mustard, and my wife I an finished this dish without looking back.  Well done Nicole!

Tried this and what a hit! I used center cut pork chops, no allspice, white wine instead of vermouth and I doubled the sauce. Served over a bowl of penne!! Delicious
