For just a few ingredients, these were pretty good.  Instead of baking them, I pan-fried them in a little butter to make them nice and crunchy.  I also shaped them into patties instead of balls.  The only addition I made to the recipe was to add two thinly sliced green onions and black pepper.  Next time, I may try adding a little mustard powder to up the flavor.  This is a great little meal that's quick and very good.

They were good, but we all felt like they needed something. I did add a little Dijon mustard with the mayo.  Next time may add some spices. They were easy, which is always nice when cooking with a preschooler in the house.

I thought these were pretty good for something different
