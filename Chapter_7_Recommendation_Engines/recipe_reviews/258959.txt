These will be a great go-to snack for me.  I am trying to incorporate more protein into my day, but it's a struggle, since I'm both gluten-sensitive and vegan. 
 
A few notes:  
- The recipe didn't mention that lentils need to be immersed in water the night before to allow them to soften.  
- I took the advice of the first reviewer and heated them on a low temperature for a longer time.  
- They sizzle as they are cooking.

Mine are getting crispy!  I used 3 dried chili peppers, since that's what I had on hand.

I loved the idea of this as a snack. I can't imagine how it could be a meal. I only made 1/2 cup at a time. The first batch was  too hard to eat even though I heard them pop. They smell wonderfully nutty but stay rock hard and then begin to burn. For the second batch, I reduced the temperature slightly and allowed them to cook a bit longer so they wouldn't burn. They were a bit better, but still hurt my teeth they were so hard. I used green Puy lentils. I ended up boiling them afterwards and ate them in a soup.
