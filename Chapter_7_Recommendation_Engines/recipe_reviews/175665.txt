This is a great recipe when on a tight budget! Easy & good. If I have leftover chicken, I shred it & add right before the noodles are done. I also use a chicken bouillon cube and add about 1/2 can tomatoe  sauce. My kids love this, esp when I add the chicken.

This was very good.  I used 1-8oz can of tomato sauce because i didnt have cubes and i added the cumin like the submitter suggested.  I also added a pinch of oregano.  Served with sour cream, cojita cheese, lime and tortillas.

UPDATE: Chicken-y flavor, not too tomatoey and not spicy at all. Our vermicilli fideo only comes in 5 oz packages here so I used a 26 oz box of stock and only 1 and about 2/3 the other tomato bullion cube and then simmered it until the liquid was reduced. I added a generous pinch of both ground cumin and oregano. Awesome meal!  
Original: Thanks Amy! I found my new favorite fideo recipe. This was great. Quick and easy to make.
I used chicken boullion cubes instead of tomato and mexican tomato sauce and water for the broth. I did add some comino and topped this with sour cream and some mexican cheese blend. I snuck in a pinch of oregano too as suggested by another reviewer, thanks SB for the tip! This turned out great and I will be making this one again (and again).

Yum! When the noodles were about browned, I tossed in 2 cloves of garlic (minced), and 1/2 tsp of cumin to cook for a minute along with the tomato broth powder. I added a few shakes of cayenne, black pepper, and a can of diced tomatoes during along with the chicken broth. Tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is the closest to authentic as I have seen. Most people use water and tomato sauce here in Texas. The tomato boullion cubes are good too. Salt and pepper are a must with the tomato sauce though.

Fantastic! I used this in tandem with an old family version (the old one calls for 1 stick of butter!). I made some changes, but they were fairly minor. Great recipe, Amy! Thanks for sharing.

We love this recipe.  Thanks so much for putting such a simple dish up.  It's quick, easy and I generally have these ingredients around the pantry.  Even my PICKY 15 year old daughter went for seconds!

I made this to go with my mexican meal when I discovered I was out of rice. It was pretty good, everyone ate it up! I think this is a good alternative to rice. I used angel hair pasta broken into small pieces. I also added some garlic powder, cumin and a little oregano.

Yumm!  Fixed it for lunch.  Since I have gluten issues, I used a corn pasta instead.  Will be doing some cooking for a big birthday party soon.  With a bit of "dressing up" (corn and peas perhaps?) this will make an excellent (simple, inexpensive, and easily expandable!) side dish to the 10 chickens I will be roasting!  Thanks for the great idea!

Great one pot weeknight dinner. I browned chicken thighs with the onion, toasted pasta in another pan then added the rest of the ingredients to simmer. I used scoop of Better than Buillon to avoid MSG in buillion cubes.

Really enjoyed this. I typically make fideo with tomato sauce , onion,garlic, cumin and i add less water.  However, I decided I wanted to try another method and this is a good and quick recipe. Much faster.  However because of the chicken bouillon and vegetable bouillon it was salty.   I only used 3c water and it has a soup like quality that I liked. I can see myself making this alot during the winter.  Beats Campbell soup from a can.
