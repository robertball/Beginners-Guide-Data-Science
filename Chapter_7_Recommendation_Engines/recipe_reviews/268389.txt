Great tasting recipe and definitely adding to my menu rotation. Update: I no longer have grilling weather. For those of you in the same boat, I did the following: baked in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes, turned over and baked another 20 minutes. Then reduce oven to 350 degrees and put on glaze and baked for 15 minutes more. I used drumsticks this time. Perfect.

Made as written and these turned our great! The ginger was a little overpowering for me so I'd leave it out next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It tasted like a good autumn meal with the Chinese five spice powder. I halved the rub & glaze ingredients and used on just 2 chicken thighs. Will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe because i could not find my original recipe.  I have made it twice once with the rub and once without. Definitely better without the rub, much less salty. I also used low sodium soy sauce. Will try to find my original recipe which was much better.

This recipe is excellent! It has become our favourite way to do chicken. With thighs and teenaged boys, it keeps things economical. Very good flavour. Don't listen to the sour review of the person who complained about allspice. There is NO allspice in this recipe!! Chinese five spice powder is not allspice and is what gives it that beautiful flavour. Highly recommend.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. I was skeptical of the method - grilling the meat with just the spice rub for the first phase before putting on the glaze - but it worked perfectly. The meat was juicy the flavors are nicely balanced and the cooking time is right on. I don t normally give a five star rating because there s always something I would change but not in this case. I will definitely make it again.

I made it for a party of 14 it was a big hit. It was simple to make and we paired it with the Best Fried Rice. This is definitely a keeper!

Tastes delicious and keeps the chicken moist. I substituted the chicken thighs for chicken breasts and it still tasted great!
