This recipe has potential but as written has flaws, at least for hubs and me. Even though I used only half the amount of vinegar, it still was way too vinegary for us. (I generally like a ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar). I used frozen corn rather than the canned, and would recommend adding another can of black beans to the mix. The flavor, other than that of vinegar, was rather flat, so I added a good half teaspoon of cumin which did seem to help. Since I reduced the vinegar by half and still found it too vinegary, I can't even imagine how overpowering the full amount would be.

My new favorite Summertime take along dish. Love that I don't have to worry about keeping it cold. This is wonderful, and whenever I make it and take it, it's a smash. I tend to get a little heavy handed with the garlic. I pretty much double the recipe except for the peppers which are usually large anyway. This make a good amount to take for a large group. I find myself sharing the recipe with others.

This salad is DELICIOUS! The only thing I changed is that I sauteed the peppers, onions and garlic in a little oil first. My preference-don't like raw onions and peppers. My whole family loved this-even my two teenage sons who usually don't like "these" kind of recipes. Lime juice makes the salad.

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't change anything, but if I was to make it again, I would definately use fresh or frozen corn, not canned.  Other than that, it was pretty good with chips.

This is a great colorful salad that I have made several times.  I found myself adding a second can of black beans in order to balance out all the peppers.

I take this dish to most potlucks; it's easy and delicous. Red and yellow peppers can be pricey, so sometimes I substitute green pepper and fresh roma tomato. Tasty.

Excellent for take alongs or carry-ins.  Serve with scoops chips.  I try to always have Bush's Black beans on hand and corn.  Just need to buy the peppers then.  Always a hit!

I liked this bean salad recipe but the vinegar was a bit over powering. So I modified it a little. I used all the ingredients listed except I only added 3 tablespoons of the vinegar and added two tablespoons of white sugar. I also used a can of the Southwestern style corn as I like more beans and less corn. My cilentro was from a spice jar instead of fresh. The sugar added just a hint of sweetness that really brought out the flavors. it was even better the next day after it set in the fridge. Thanks for a good recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone LOVES IT!  I use it with chips for dip and with greens for a salad.  It's very "pretty" to serve with the variety of colors.  Don't ever delete this recipe as I look it up and share it all the time.

Awesome summer salad/dip. I bring it to almost every bbq and always have requests for the recipe. It's simple and inexpensive. Tastes blend best if you make it night before and add a diced jalapeno if you like a kick:)

This is my fail-safe summer dish: everyone loves it, it's easy, nutritious, flexible (eat as a salad or dip with scoop tortilla chips), portable, adaptable (add grape tomatoes, avocados, celery) and yummy. My MIL and SIL now serve it as all thier cookouts too. Everyone raves and asks for recipe, and I give BushBeans full credit!

Not bad. I had to tweak it a bit by adding additional amounts of seasoning, lime juice, honey and sugar. Went well with chicken fajitas.

I love this salad. The first time I tried it I didnt use this recipe but they came out exsactly the same! I eat it warm and use a bag of frzn black bean, corn, and pepper mix in the grocery store. Then mix together a whole lime, 1/4 evoo, garlic, 3 tblsp red wine ving., and salt and pepper. Shake it up and add it to the warm salad and serve along side some Rice Enchilladas. YUM!

YUM! I love this recipe! The only thing I changed was to add a bit more lime juice and fresh cilantro; just my preference. I will make this again!
