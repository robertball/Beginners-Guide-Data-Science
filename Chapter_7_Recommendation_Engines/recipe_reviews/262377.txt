At the time I'm writing this review, the recipe is rated halfway between 4 and 5, and that's what I'd give it if we could give half stars.  It offers a tasty, healthy twist on the old standby of mac and cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it got very good reviews in our house.  When I reheated the leftovers, I sprinkled a little more cheddar cheese on top, and that seemed to make it even better.  I also think it would benefit from having some cheese layered inside the macaroni ... but that may just be nitpicking.  If you're undecided about whether to try this or not, do it.  It probably won't become your signature dish, but everyone will enjoy it.

Tasty! I only had half of the pasta but accidentally made a full batch of the sauce (and added some onion), so my mac 'n cheese was SUPER creamy, just the way I like it.

I LOVE this recipe for my toddlers and me! They love it and get spinach without any complaint! I have made this recipe more for them than anything else-SO much better and healthier than a box of kraft! I love it too for me-I just add more salt to mine.

It seemed a little dry. I expected it to be creamier. Tastes good though!

This is pretty good-- I was afraid that the sauce would be too watery with 3 cups milk, but it wasn't. I didn't use nutmeg, and used an Italian cheese blend instead of cheddar (omitting the top cheese layer). Trying to decide whether water chestnuts might be a good addition...
