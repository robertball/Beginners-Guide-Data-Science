Needed a dessert for tonight, and it needed to be quick.  Used sugar free pudding, skim milk, light whipped topping, and it still tasted fantastic.  The mint Oreo cookies really star in this, but it also has a satisfactory mousse-like texture to it.  Presentation is lovely, the taste is refreshing, and this is a winner!!

Very good dessert. It's quick and easy, and very pretty with the fresh strawberries and fresh green mint leaves!

I substituted pie crust for graham crackers and didn't use any mint. Came out GREAT!
