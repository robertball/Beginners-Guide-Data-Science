I've been making these for months now, but keep forgetting to take a pic because they disappear so fast! :)  I made them again this morning and didn't have hungry friends ready to pounce, so I took the opportunity to take a pic.  

Like all skinny or flourless pancakes I've tried, these can be a little more difficult to flip because they are 'eggy', but if you're used to this style of pancake you'll have no problems.  I love the flavor and texture. These aren't sweet at all, so a fruit topping as suggested in the notes is a great idea. I topped mine with frozen raspberries that I simmered down with a bit of water. If I'm by myself, I make just a half recipe. I use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to ladle out the batter. 

I also recommend cooking these over medium heat instead of medium-high so they don't get too dark.   There's been a couple times where I ran out of eggs, so I topped off the egg mixture with Egg Beaters egg whites and this worked just as well.

This recipe didn't work for me. I followed the recipe exactly. I wasted SO much batter trying to get just ONE pancake.... Hence you'll become skinny if you use this recipe because you will only be able to get one pancake -if you're lucky!

I made these again closer to the original recipe this time but I used melted butter instead of coconut oil and 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp. sugar.  delicate and delicious.

After a couple of flipping mess-ups, I found that a low flame and leaving it on one side a little longer made it easier.  But the "mealy" texture put me off a bit so I don't think I'll make them again.
