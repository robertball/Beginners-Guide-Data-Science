I mean this respectfully, but the review that has been flagged as "most helpful" on this recipe is so misleading. I have been making this recipe for at least six years (easily since 2004) following the instructions to the letter. I was a novice fudge maker and my first batch was perfect. Six years later, and not once has the fudge not set up or turned out. The beauty of this is that you **don't** need to worry about "soft ball" stages or thermometers, which can be so intimidating. Do what the recipe says. Stir constantly until it boils and start timing your 7 minutes once the fudge hits a full rolling boil, not when it just starts to bubble.  I've started the timing up to a minute late (oops) and it was still fine. I find this very forgiving. Use the timer on your stove and boil for 7 minutes. Remove from heat and immediately add marshmallow creme, incorporate and add vanilla & peanut butter as directed. No need to let cool to a magic number. I've made countless batches and it has never seized up. Pour into your 9x13 pan, let cool (don't refrigerate, I set mine in the cool garage), cut. Easy easy easy! One thing to note, using a commercial peanut butter vs an all natural gives a creamier texture. I've used name brands and cheapies and it comes out about the same. I'm a choosy mom so you can guess the brand I prefer! ;) My best advice is to keep this as the wonderful person who shared it intended. Easy!

This fudge has an excellent flavor, BUT the instructions are not adequate to get the recipe to turn out regularly--after 7 batches and only 2 that were edible, I finally figured it out.  

First of all, you must cook the fudge to softball stage--234 to 240 degrees.  Depending on your stove and cookware the time could vary significantly.

Secondly, you must cool it adequately before adding the peanut butter and vanilla.  It needs to cool to somewhere between 110 and 125 degrees in order to prevent the mixture from seizing.  Cooling it to this temperature could take quite a bit of time and it should not be stirred during this time.  Hopefully this helps everyone out.  The recipe is quite good and even better once you figure out the details.

An important thing to remember when making candy is it needs stirred up until the moment it starts boiling.  You can't touch it during the 7 minute boiling phase.  Otherwise you will make large sugar crystals and it will not "melt in your mouth".  If you follow those directions it will be a 5 star candy.

OH MY GOODNESS! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! This is the best peanut butter fudge that I have ever eaten.  My husband & I go to a specialty shop once a year and buy about 2 lbs. of gourmet peanut butter fudge....well, no more!! This is much better.  I am so impressed with this recipe I just don't have enough room to say everything I want about it.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you must try it!!  
The only thing I must caution you about is the cooking time on this recipe is off.  It says "Total cook time: 7 minutes". That is wrong, it takes 7 or 8 minutes just to get to the boil stage and then you must boil it for 7 more minutes, so your total cook time will be about 15 minutes.

Very good. Turned out great. I saw the other post where someone said it was dry and crumbly, it was cooked too long. And the one that turned out grainy, it wasn't cooked long enough. Fudge recipes are touchy, you have to follow the instructions exactly. This fudge is good in that it isn't too sweet, has a good balance, and couldn't be any easier to make.

This peanut butter fudge recipe is so luscious it is beyond any description.  Seven minutes at a rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down) made the perfect creamy texture.  If you have a candy thermometer, boil to 234 degrees.

I tried this at my very first attempt to make fudge. PERFECT! I took the time to read the reviews and it helped me understand what I was doing. Everybody raved about this fudge and asked me how to do it. Note: Wait for a full boil before you start the 7 minutes timer. I did not stir at all while the sugar was boiling.

Wow.  I made this for Christmas goodie baskets and it received RAVE reviews.  The fudge was so good, I just couldn't stop making it.  Before the day was over, I had gone through 15lbs. of white sugar.  Friends were giving it to friends, and I am still getting e-mails for the recipe.  
This recipe also makes great chocolate fudge.  Just replace the peanut butter with 4 cups milk chocolate chips and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Very creamy.  Very delicious!

Made this recipe for a football tailgate this past weekend and got rave reviews! Two very important things to note: (1) depending on the pan size/temperature settings on your stove, boiling for 7 minutes may not get the fudge to the right temp, and if its not hot enough, it will be runny and goopy. The easiest way to guarantee that your fudge sets up correctly is to use a candy thermometer and heat it to soft ball stage (235-240 degrees). I recommend an instant-read digital thermometer - so easy to use. (2)For those who have a hard time finding marshmallow creme (or want to save some $$) 4 large marshmallows equals 1 oz of marshmallow creme, so about 30 large marshmallows should do the trick here. Best PB fudge I've had in a while, thanks for the recipe!

Superb recipe, both in taste and texture. For an easy variation, after the 7 minutes of boiling is complete, stir in the marshmallow cream and vanilla, then divide in roughly half (put 1/2 in another bowl, keep half in the boiling pan.)   Mix 1 cup peanut butter in one half, and stir a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips until melted into the other half.  Pour both into a foil-lined 9" X 13" pan. (Turn the pan over and smooth the foil over the outside bottom, then lift the foil, turn over the pan and place inside the pan. The foil will be exactly the right size and shape to conform to the inside bottom. Do this ahead of time, before you start cooking the fudge, so that it's ready to receive the cooked fudge immediately.) Work quickly.  Take a knife and marble your way through the entire pan quickly. Allow to cool. Additionally, you may pour in the chocolate, level it, then pour the peanut butter on top for a two-layered look.

Terrific fudge!  I followed somone elses advice on using a candy thermometer and cooking to the soft ball stage.  I had set my timer after it got to a roiling boil.  At 7 minutes I was not near the soft ball stage. They also said to cool to 125 degrees before adding the peanut butter and vanilla which I did.
  I would not want to make this around small children because it needs your full attention and stirring while boiling. 
  This would make a great gift and with a thermometer, it is not hard to make.

I had NEVER made fudge before, but decided to take a stab at it after reading the simple instructions and great reviews for this recipe. WOW I'm glad I did! Please do not listen to the other reviewers who say you need a candy thermometer and this and that... Just stir it constantly until it comes to a rolling boil, stop stirring and then set a timer for 7 min. Mix the marshmallow creme in just after taking it off the burner and mix until dissolved. Immediately add vanilla and PB and stir until mixed well. Mine began to set right after I added the PB. It was so rich and creamy, better than anyone else's fudge I've ever tried and it was my first time making it! I made a chocolate batch by substituting the PB with 4 cups milk chocolate and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate morsels like another reviewer suggested. Think I'll melt the chocolate before adding it next time, came out great but the dips were hard to stir in. Please just follow the instructions and don't make it more complicated than it should be.

Whoa...my teeth are hurting after every bite! Very sweet and very peanut buttery!!  Not sure the brown sugar was necessary except in adding the color.  I threw in a handful of chocolate chips, just because I'm partial to chocolate. Didn't really add any flavor..just felt like getting creative. Very creamy indeed.  I enjoyed mine with coffee.  Good Recipe!

This has been a "go to" recipe for me for years.  I find that you really have to time this right.  Wait until you have a full boil you can't stir down and then use a timer for 7 minutes exactly.  I also use a full jar of peanut butter even if it is a couple ounces more.  For chocolate fudge just add semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of peanut butter and for really dark chocolate fudge, mix about 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder in with the sugar before adding wet ingediants and then add the chocolate chips instead of peanut butter.

Fudge perfection! So creamy and it set just right. There are 2 things you must do that the directions don't state clearly.  Combine your butter, milk and sugars on medium heat and stir constantly until you reach a boil and then set a timer for 7 minutes and do not stir at all....just allow it to boil. This is the key to creamy goodness.

I tried this recipe two ways.  Long story short: follow the recipe exactly!  I read all the reviews and initially boiled it to 235 F (which took 10 m), then mixed in the marshmallow creme, and waited till the mixture cooled to 125 F before mixing in the PB and vanilla.  The resulting fudge was edible/fine/a little crumbly.  Following the recipe exactly as indicated took far less time and yielded a deliciously creamy result.  Save yourself some time and follow this recipe as written!

Creamy, YES, however it is too creamy texture-wise.  As in semi-firm-paste consistency.  Even after setting up overnight, it is still not fudge-firm as I feel it should be.  I made this with the intention of including it in goodies boxes to be shipped to family and friends, and that's just not going to happen with this recipe...  I will keep them in the frige, and nibble far too many squares I'm sure, because flavor-wise it is DELICIOUS.  I wish I would have used the other "easiest" recipe on this site, but don't want to use up a whole other jar of peanut butter to find out now.  I have made many fudges in the past, so I don't think it was a novice-issue, and I took care to follow this recipe EXACTLY, btw, even setting a timer for the 7 min and stirring constantly!  I think with less evap. milk and maybe a half stick of butter more you may get a firmer, and for me more desirable, consistency...  even straight out of the frige this is sooooft... melt in your mouth, yes, but also in your hand, in the bag on the counter, etc.  *****  Was actually able to salvage this... rolled the crumbly paste into balls, popped in the freezer for 30m and then followed the recipe for the chocolate part of Buckeye Balls, came out AWESOME--- like Reese's balls!  But I'm not ammending my 3-star rating because as FUDGE, this failed for me.  Just thought I'd mention the Buckeye Balls in case anyone else ends up where I did...

This is an AWESOME recipe! I agree with the other reviews, you MUST start the 7 minute mark after the mixture starts to boil or it might turn out too soft. I put foil in the pan and sprayed a little butter flavored nonstick spray on the foil, its MUCH easier to take out this way.

As another reviewer said, use a bigger pan than stated to use. I just made a batch and it boiled over with the heat turned off! My son asked for me to make it and I'm making 3 batches to give out as gifts as well. Its a GREAT recipe! (I'm almost tempted to use chunky peanut butter for one batch)

Best peanut butter fudge -- EVER! Advice: scoop out the peanut butter from the jar into a bowl before you get started. It's much faster getting it into the fudge. Also, keep the stove on medium. Not medium-high, not medium-low, MEDIUM. And leave it there to allow it to come to a boil. Stir the entire time it's coming to a boil BUT once the fudge comes to a rolling boil, set the timer for 7 minutes and DO NOT STIR! Really, leave it alone. Guaranteed fool proof fudge if you follow this recipe exactly. It is SOOOOO good!

I've been making this recipe for Christmas for 10 years!  I have requests for this on my cookie platters every year from many of my neighbors. It is very similiar to fudge I had growing up that a neighbor always brought to me when I visited my Grandmother.  The only difference I make is to cut the recipe in half and use an 8 x 8 glass dish lined with foil.  It turns out almost every time.  This year I used "off" brand products to make this fudge and it set up to fast (before I could get it in the pan),  I tried a 2nd time and this time it turned out "grainy" textured (under cooked).  When I make this again I will only used the best products!!

Yum!  I couldn't believe how good this turned out!  I actually didn't stir constantly (as I was told that it creates sugar crystals and results in a coarse texture).  It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious!

I made this for christmas and it got rave reviews! A digital instant read thermometer is a great asset when cooking fudge which helped me get it right to 234 degrees. Take it off the heat the moment it reaches that temp and your set. You will love this.

"Raz" is soooooo right!!!! How stupid are we paying the prices we do when we can make this absolutely wonderful, fantastic and delicious fudge right on our own stove!!!! I too added more peanut butter, but that's the only change I made. I'm craving another piece as I'm writing. Thanks sooooo much Janet! We luv ya girl!

I participated in an open house in a large art gallery this weekend,  this fudge lasted 30 minutes on the table, I went home and made another batch for Sunday. It was a huge hit. Remember, the jars are 18 oz, so you don't use the whole thing. Also, when you time the boil, you start the time when it is a full rolling boil that can't be stirred down. Hope that helps. Thank you for a great recipe! This is the most requested recipe I have during the holidays!  Makes 5 pounds, I think!!

So good!  I'm not a big fan of plain peanut butter, so I wasn't too sure if I would like it or not.  It's just the right sweetness and peanut butter flavor.  But it does need to be refrigerated because it's too soft to eat when left at room temp.

Other than the bit of instructions that are not quite specific about cook time, this turned out perfectly. I made sure to start timing when a rolling boil was reached and used a candy thermometer as well. 7 minutes was perfect time. Remember do not stir at all while it is in the rolling boil stage. I mixed in the marshmallow creme first, then the peanut butter and vanilla. This all must be done quickly and poured out fast, so have everything ready. Very sweet, exactly how we love our fudge!

Creamy and smooth. I couldn't get enough of this! The only problem I had was that most peanut butter jars come in 15 oz. so don't forget to slightly adjust the other portions or you'll end up with a fudge that doesn't set =(

Please don't make the same mistake as me!  I made the fudge exactly as the recipe stated and everything was going great, I had added the marshmallow cream after taking the fudge off the heat and it looked like a heavenly cloud and then I added my peanut butter and the disaster began!  Not thinking,  I was using my Lifetime cookwear which really holds the heat for a long time.  I added the PB and it instantly dried up right in the mix!!!!  I had to add another 1/4 cup milk to cream it back out again.  Please, if you are using cookware that holds the heat really well, let it cook down for a few min before adding the PB so you don't end up with a grainy mess.  In closing, I can't wait to try this again and use my noodle next time!

This fudge was fantastic. Perfect color and consistency. A couple of notes: Make sure you don't start the 7 minutes until the milk and sugar start a rolling boil. If you don't cook the sugar long enough the fudge will be too soft. Use a large pot. I used a medium sauce pan and almost didn't have enough room to stir.

This is the most fantastic peanut butter fudge!  May I recommend, however, that creamy (NOT crunchy) peanut butter is best!!  Also be sure to stir completely!! I didn't stir as good as I should have and there was some peanut butter at the bottom of the pan.  It resulted in a swirly pattern fudge...looks pretty, though!!!!!

Made this pretty much just as written though I've varied the amount of peanut butter and we think it's best with about a cup and 3/4.  Look out, it's addictive!

This was yummy, but as it's written it's only a 4 star recipe. The first batch I made I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. It turned out grainy and had a weird aftertaste. I frequently get coffee at a place in town that is also a fantastic fudge shop, so I asked the local fudge maestra about it. After discussing a few things with her I altered the recipe for the 2nd batch I made a few days later and it was great!   I made the following changes - the brown sugar was the reason for the aftertaste so I omitted it completely the second time. I also found that 7 minutes wasn't near enough to adequately dissolve all that sugar so I boiled for 10 minutes and (at the suggestion of the local expert) kept stirring during the boiling phase. The 2nd batch turned out MMMMMMMMelt-in-your-MMMMOUTH DELISH! Definitely a 5 star recipe with the changes.

My second try at fudge and it turned out perfectly. It's so good it's addictive. I'll definitely add this recipe to the Christmas season goodies I bake. Way yummy. Fair warning: I have gained 10 lbs. since I started making this fudge. Could be a coincidence, but consider yourself warned.

My hubby made this and Iam 1 happy mommie rite NOW :). We just got off  Vacation  3 wks ago and I ALWAYS get Pb fudge frm were we go to VAC. Now  all   I have to do is ask my hubby to make this GREAT Pb fudge.  It's  ALL MOST the same as I get on VACATION.  and I don't have to drive 4 hours  from  home.  It's so so so CREAMY  and rich very rich. It does take a little time to make the hard part is waiting  on it to hardened   but well worth the wait. I have a secret  I got into the FUDGE  while it wasn't ready  it's was still hot and it was GREAT  hot. This s a go to EVERY NITE  Pb fudge,  just don't worry about the calories.  It's a keeper.

So I'm totally a fudge virgin and this recipe worked perfectly for me. I took my time and followed the directions closely. I SLOWLY warmed the mixture to the rolling boil so that it was smooth and well mixed. I even had to change pans in the middle of the process b/c mine was too small after boil began. I maintained that 7 minutes of the rolling boil and it set up great. This was an easy recipe that turned out really smooth and yummy! I had none of the problems with it that other folks have reported.

YUM!  Came out fabulous.  I have to laugh at the reviews saying not to make this fudge on a rainy or humid day though since...I live in Puerto Rico where it's approximately 70-90% humidity every day!  Came out fabulous none the less :) Will be serving it at my Christmas Eve celebration tomorrow.

This was the first time I made fudge. It turned out perfect!  I did what others said and stir it until it started to boil. Then I stopped stirring and cooked it until it reached 235 degrees, which took about 10 mins. Other than that, I followed the directions. Very very yummy!!!

EXCELLENT!!! Very creamy and tasty.  One suggestion however is to use a large enough pan.  I used a medium saucepan as suggested and it overflowed everywhere.  It was a sticky mess, not easy to clean!

Made this today for Christmas Eve festivities. It is very creamy, lots of flavor.  I followed the recipe, and it set up fine. Make sure you let it come to a boil that can't be knocked down with a spoon before starting the 7 minute timer.  This is a keeper for me!

I made this for a cookie exchange. I followed the directions exactly and it never "set up" for me, not even after 6 hours in the refrigerator.  After an hour in the freeze I was able to cut it into squares that melted within the hour.  It was a smooth, creamy blob and I was so embarrassed at my cookie party.  I gave it two stars only because I thought it tasted really good if it would have been the right consistency.  Very disappointing!!!!

WONDERFUL peanut butter fudge. Easy and incredibly creamy. I followed the directions exactly except instead of 1 jar peanut butter I used 1/2 creamy peanut butter and 1/2 crunchy peanut butter(we like peanuts). Just remember to start your 7 minutes boiling time AFTER it reachs a full rolling boil.

This fudge was wonderful.  The texture was not grainy at all and it set up beautifuly.  It was very easy to prepare.  I made a batch last Christmas and everyone seemed to really like it.  It was just like the fudge that my dad used to make for us when I was a kid.  I had been looking for a good recipie for a while and I have found the one that I will be keeping in my recipie book.

Pro's:  Very creamy, sweet, rich, and easy to make.

Con's:  Took longer than 28 minutes, could use a little more peanut butter.

Notes:  If your's turned out grainy, then you need to cook it longer.  It should be very frothy, like foam.  I prefer a more peanut buttery taste, so I will add more next time.  I also love nuts in my fudge and will add pecans next time as well. Who care's if it's called "Peanut Butter", I love pecans!

I have made this fudge for my family for over forty years and it is a goof proof fudge if you know cooking terms and follow the directions. It also is the basic recipe for a lot of different fudges just exchanging chocolate chips for peanut butter or other flavor chips and increasing or deceasing evaporated milk. It is an excellent recipe I will continue to use. deb1001

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  This fudge is delicious; my husband doesn't like peanut butter fudge usually but says this is good! Be prepared for a large amount of fudge--my pan was overflowing. Thanks for the recipe.

Really good recipe.  Because it is so super sweet, I cut the recipe in half ad poured into a 9x9 inch pan. I still cut into 24 pieces however.  This is great to package up for holiday gifts. Will make again.

This is a great recipe, I didn't change anything.  My first batch turned out well (I accidently forgot the vanilla) but my second batch was AMAZING.  I'm not sure why it was that much different- it could have been my measuring as I just split a 13oz jar of marshmellow creme.  Any way, great recipe!  I will definately use this again.

This is a fantastic Peanut Butter Fudge recipe! I followed the directions EXACTLY and it came out great! Stirring is easy and smooth. Took me about 10 minutes of stirring to reach "soft-ball" stage and then I let it sit for 7 to 8 min. I moved it away from the heat, and let it sit until it stopped boiling. I then added the marshmellow cream and stirred it in until completely melted & mixed. I then added the peanut butter and vanilla until well-mixed. I put it in the fridge and let it cool overnight. EXCELLENT! PERFECT TEXTURE!!

The taste of the fudge did not disappoint.  However, I too had trouble with the fudge turning out too soft even though I read the reviews of what to do differently.  I guess maybe I didn't use the correct amount of peanut butter since I could not find the correct size container/.  If I decide to try this again, I will maybe cook it even longer and cool it longer as well.  After two days it is more firm and more fudge like in my opinion.  But again, I could've just messed this one up...

I have been making this fudge for a couple years now. It is awesome!  Some helpful hints: cook in a 5 quart stainless steal pot and use a wooden spoon. Also if you have one, use your candy thermometer and cook to soft ball stage of 234 degrees. Stir in the marshmallow creme and peanut butter as directed. There is no need to cool before adding the peanut butter. It comes out perfect every time!

Ive always had to go to a speciality shop to get smooth, creamy peanut butter fudge.  NO MORE!!!
This was as good as it gets.
I followed the directions exactly as written and was I thrilled with the results and compliments I recieved.  The recipe made a large batch (no more paying 5.99 for 1/4 a pound) and was simply a "melt in your mouth" delight.
Thank you sooooo much

This is the best!!! creamiest, peanut butteriest fudge I have ever tasted!  I made a couple of changes... Someone suggested using dark brown sugar, so instead of 4 cups of granulated sugar and 1 of brown sugar, I used 3 of granulated sugar, 1 of light brown sugar, 1 of dark brown sugar.  Also, I added 1 teaspoon of salt (toward the end of the 7 minutes), to reduce the cloying sweetness fudge sometimes has. It helped. Used a 10 1/2" x 13" (I know-an odd size) pan.  One half of the recipe I left plain, and to the rest, I added walnuts (sounds weird, but a great addition!).  It produced 3/4" fudge.  I didn't use a candy thermometer, and wasn't sure if I was supposed to stir for the 7 minutes it was at a full boil (but I did).  The fudge pours into the pan, so you may doubt that it will set to be hard enough to cut, but it does.  When cutting the fudge, if you wipe the knife with a damp, hot towel between cuts, it will help you cut the fudge more easily. Yum- the best!

This is excellent.  It makes a large batch.  I may halve it next time and cook it for about 1 minute longer since it was just a little soft.

This recipe is quick, easy, and the children enjoy assisting.  I make peanut butter balls with mine and utilize chocolate (candy coating) to dip the peanut butter balls in and it is absolutely outstanding.  Thanks for the recipe, it has become a holiday tradition in my home.

I've been making fudge for years and have never had fudge turn crumbly like this. I followed the directions exactly.  I believe 7 minutes is too long to boil.  Next time I'll reduce the time.  Flavor is great!

This recipe was very easy, very quick and very good.  I also used it to make chocolate fudge by substituting the peanut butter with two cups of milk chocolate chips and that also turned out great.

It's a very good recipe, but I disagree with the cooking time. Seven minutes overcooks the mixture and you end up with a dry, crumbling fudge. Five minutes is plenty of cooking time, and the fudge comes out smooth and creamy.

After reading the reviews I was unsure of whether to cook for 7 minutes or not but figured I would try the recipe as is.  It did harden for me even though it did not reach soft ball stage but the next time I make this I will cook for longer than 7 minutes. I would have liked it to have had a little more firmness to it. But, a very tasty and good looking peanut butter fudge. I will make again.

Well, as a fudge snob eletist, I fully expected to find this wanting somehow. I allowed as how I don't know everything and went ahead anyhow and the end result was pretty fine indeed. Some thought the peanut butter taste strong, others, like me, thought it a bit light. Some thought it too sweet, others, like me, said its fudge for crying out loud. In the end, this recipe makes a bunch of fudge and it all got eaten up. Its a winner.

I am a total klutz at cooking fudge and even I didn't screw this up.  Took the advice of others and didn't stir. Don't know if this was the trick or if the other way  would have turned out just as good. Definitely will use this recipe over and over

I don't like peanut butter and thus, do not like peanut butter fudge. . .but, man, do I LOVE this stuff! Incredible!  I took other folks' advice and stirred until it came to a rolling boil over medium heat after which I left it alone for 7 minutes to boil on its own. I took it off the fire and added the marsh. cream, then peanut butter and vanilla,  NOT waiting for it to cool (as another reviewer stated)incorporating each before adding the next AND I used a hand mixer. Not too difficult and with great results; beautiful to look at, creamiest texture ever and incredible flavor. Thank you so much for this one!

used marshmallow fluff instead of creme. and regular milk (1%) instead of evaporated.  turned out awesome!! I think the fluff is a better way to go if you have it. otherwise followed the recipe.

This fudge was super easy to make, no need for a candy thermometer.  I just boiled it according to the recipe and it turned out great.   This fudge never gets too hard.  I have had more compliments on it and it was my first time ever making fudge.   I have already made it twice and will be making it again before Christmas.

This fudge is PERFECT! I did exactly as said, except I mixed the marshmallow, peanut butter, and vanilla all in immediately after removing it from the heat, rather than one ingredient at a time. This is the recipe I will now use year after year.

Fudge intimidates me, but I thought I would give this a shot. Glad I did! Cooked just as directed- it came out so creamy and yummy! I was so excited that such a quick easy recipe could produce such a yummy product. Making more to give out for christmas gifts! Oh- and it freezes well too!

This Fudge is by far the best I have ever made (or eaten)! I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly. If I could I would give it 6 stars!!

Oh my goodness! Follow the recipe and be sure to let the mixture boil for 7 minutes without touching it (it's hard I know but don't touch it!). Then wait for the mixture to cool before adding the rest of the ingredients. After completed my fudge looked weird but I used my hands to press the fudge into the 9x13 pan and smooth it out...It came out perfect! And everyone loved it and even ate the entire pan within 1 hour!

I would have gave this five stars for taste but I cooked mine too long and it turned out dry and crumbly.

This came out grainy and I did everything that was listed on all the "tip" reviews. What can I do with a cake pan full of gritty sugar? Can I recook it in the microwave? I'm very disappointed.

OK, so I had some serious doubts about this recipe, but it was amazing!!  First of all I used a medium sauce pan like the recipe called for.  Well, the fudge gets to a rolling boil (which you need in order for it to set up) and the sugar/milk mixture is growing and growing and gets so close the the lip of the pan I quick get out my large pan and put the sugar/milk mixture in there, but it totally cools it down.  I get it going in a rolling boil again, but I'm not sure how much time I have lost with the cooling down and the heating up and the recipe states 7 minutes.  Use your large sauce pan folks!  Next, I used Jiff natural peanut butter (no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oil) I wasn't sure how that would work, but the fudge is brilliant!  So easy and so YUMMY!  Thanks for sharing, this is a total keeper and easy to make.

I always get requests for this fudge.  For those having trouble with it being too soft, try reducing the butter by a tablespoon or two.  It helps!

This was my first time making fudge.  I dont own a candy thermometer (but plan on getting one now) but I was looking for a dessert I could make with what I had on hand and this was it.  It took about 4 minutes to get to a boil and then I set the timer for 7 minutes and watched it boil - I didn't stir.  After 7 minutes I moved it from heat and added the marshmallow mix.  I waited about 5 more minutes and then added the peanut butter and vanilla.  Placed in my glass pie pan and put in the fridge to cool.  Turned out just fine, creamy yet firm and very good.  I will make again, a must for peanut butter lovers.

I made the recipe as stated, but added melted milk chocolate on top of the finished product.  

This stuff was absolutely fantastic and has become an instant family classic.  I've had to make a couple batches to keep up with demand.  

It's so good that I can't decide whether to thank you or curse you.

OH MY GOODNESS! This was fantastic.  Very creamy, very yummy! This recipe was easy. The only thing I did differently was use a candy thermometer to 236 degrees instead of boiling for 7 minutes.  Whole family loves this one.  This will be a new favorite.

I have to say that this is the easiest and best peanut butter fudge I have made.  The recipe is easy to follow, and the flavor is perfect--not too sweet, yet rich and creamy.  Since I first tried the recipe a few days ago, I have made about 30 pounds of it because friends and family have begged for more.  Thanks for sharing.

I have been making this recipe for about 6 years.  Follow the recipe exactly. I use a 18 oz jar of pbutter, cuz i cant find a 16 oz.  It works just fine.  Boil exactly 7 minutes.  It will seem a bit soupy when you pour it in the pan at first, but it will eventually set up.  I keep at room temp.  It really is the best pbutter fudge i have found yet.

Good - but not the best.  This makes a TON of fudge.  The thing I like best about this one is that I can use a sugar substitute for the white sugar, bringing the calories down and lowering the effect to glycemic response.  Many other peanut butter fudge recipes don't call for white sugar, so it's not an option.

Excellent. I made this for Christmas last year and everyone loved it.  My husbands brother asked me to make some just for him, and my husbands co worker is always bugging him to get me to make some.  If your trying to decide on a fudge recipe, pick this one!

Definitely rich, definitely creamy, and DEFINITELY delicious!!  Wow! I used a candy thermometer and waited until it reached 234 degrees (which was right at 7 minutes after it started boiling).  It's so soft and "fudgy". I've tried other fudge recipes that are too dry or hard. This one is perfect and makes a TON!  Ally

I used this recipe in my first attempt at fudge-making. First batch didn't turn out... too soft, didn't set up.  After looking for some fudge-making hints, I found that there's a difference between air-bubbles and boiling...also seemed easier to use a thermometer to make sure it was at the right stage. I also agree with others that you should let it sit and cool undisturbed for a few minutes before adding the fluff and PB. So my second attempt, I used a candy thermometer instead of timing it, let it sit for a few minuted and it turned out really good.  My BF said "This stuff is awesome".  Will definitely use again.

This recipe was good but wayyyyyyyyyyyy to sugar-y for me.  However, an excellent alternative is to make this a chocolate peanut butter fudge.  Right after you stir the marshmellow cream in, pour half the mixture over a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips in a seperate bowl.  Then add half the jar of peanut butter and vanilla to the remaining mixture.  Spread the chocolate fudge, then peanut butter fudge on top and swirl with a spoon for a marble effect.  THAT was a five-star fudge!

This is absolutely the best peanut butter fudge EVER.  I've already made 3 batches this year and everyone who has tasted it thinks it's the GREATEST.  It's a "keeper" and will become a holiday tradition.  I wanted to add that I even used 2% evaporated milk and reduced fat Jif peanut butter in making this fudge.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I had been searching for a peanut butter fudge recipe that is exactly like my Great Grandmothers for a very long time with no luck, until I finally came across this one. This recipe is JUST like hers and everyone loves it! My mothers boyfriend would request her fudge every holiday until she became too old to make it anymore. I have decided to take over the tradition and he couldn't have been happier this Christmas when i brought him a giant tub of fudge. thank you for sharing this recipe with us! 

Update: I wanted to share that when I cook this fudge I do use a candy thermometer just because I own one and I like to be consistent every time. I have been cooking it to exactly 240° because we like the fudge to be nice and creamy. 7 minutes is just about the perfect cooking time for that,but make sure it's 7 minutes from when it comes to a rolling boil.

Absolutely the BEST peanut butter fudge I have ever had! Seven minutes at a rolling boil (wait for it to come to a full boil) and do not stir!

PHENOMENAL FUDGE!  Knowing how the cooking time makes the difference between a rich fudge and one that's stiff, flaky or brittle, I followed the directions EXACTLY and it turned out perfectly.   Using premium ingredients will give you a premium fudge...tried the store brands and although it turns out okay, the taste is not the same.

This is 5th time I've made this fudge--perfect everytime!  I put my PB, marshmallow cream and vanilla in my kitchenaid so when the 7 minutes is up, I CAREFULLY pour it over and let it mix until it has a little sheen.  Then I pour it into 1 8x12 glass dish and I only pour what will freely come out of the bowl---this gives the pan a beautiful texture that looks creamy.  What is left in the bowl, I scrape into a little container--can't waste any of it!  Note that the jar of Jif is 18 oz, recipe calls for 16oz but I used it all and it always comes out perfect.

I'm sure this recipe is great, but it sure isn't for beginners. I didn't have a candy thermometer and I scorched the mixture pretty easily.

Ihave made this quite a few times now, and everyone who has had some comes begging to me for more. I followed the suggestion using a candy thermometer and bringing it to softball stage. I also found that I didn't need to wait for it to cool down to add remaining ingrediants.

After making this only one time I can honestly say the recipe needs very little, if any, tweaking as far as technique goes.  I brought the mixture to a rapid boil while stirring constantly.  When it achieved a rolling boil, I stopped stirring and set my timer for 7 minutes.  I added the secondary ingredients as directed and everything went extremely well.
I did make some ingredient changes.  I used fat-free evaporated milk and reduced-fat peanut butter as they were what I had on hand. 
I prefer a thicker fudge so I used a 9 x 9 inch pan instead of the 9 x 13.
The fudge came out perfectly and was incredibly creamy and smooth.
Would highly recommend this recipe as I can only  describe it as fool proof!

Since this calls for so many ingredients and way too much sugar (IMO), I tried substituting Splenda. Either the recipe creates very soft fudge or for some reason it didn't work with Splenda - I wasted a lot of ingredients and ended up with soft,  mushy, inedible goo

I have never made fudge before and I was making this as a Christmas gift. I was so nervous!! I read all the reviews and tips and had a plan! At the last minute I couldn't find candy thermometer! Panic! I was going to just rely on the soft ball stage...scared....Then I scrolled down and read Lorna's review and followed her advice (don't test, just boil 7 mins starting at the rolling boil point) and had the most fabulous fudge!! I will def make this again and again! If I could give it 10 stars I would!! Follow instructions and ingredients to a T and listen to Lorna and you can't go wrong!!

This is a very simple recipe to make.  I agree when it comes to a boil do not stir.  Let it boil on it own for the seven minutes.  It took a bit of stirring to get the marshmellow cream and then the peanut butter to blend, but it was worth all the effort.

I am 40 yrs old and have never attempted fudge before due to all the horror stories.  This was SO good.  I read a bunch of the reviews prior to making and it turned out perfectly!  My niece and nephew were here and said it is better than Grandma's.  They told their Mom and Grandma that I am the "Fudge Master".  Thanks for making me look good!!

This was my first attempt at making fudge, but I followed the advice in other reviews. It nearly ended in disaster, as my saucepan was just a tiny bit too small! It wound up boiling over slightly, so I had to remove it from the heat for a moment to pour some out to keep it from making a mess of the stove. Fortunately I think I got it back on quickly enough, since it turned out great! It was a little soft, but solid enough to hold, and incredibly smooth and creamy. While stuffing another square into his mouth, my boyfriend asked me not to make it again any time soon because it was just too  good!

Words cannot describe my love for this fudge.  I boiled the sugar mixture for 7 minutes as directed (did *not* use a candy thermom.) I premixed the pb/fluff/vanilla in a glass bowl while the sugar mixture was boiling (and I did not stir it during that time).  I poured the hot mixture over the pb/fluff in the bowl, mixed it with my spatula and voila!  I had perfet fudge.  We all love it! Thanks!

Fudge is tricky. Not wanting to waste ingredients, I followed the fudge-making rules when I made this, namely I used a candy thermometer and tested for soft ball stage. Timing it at 7 minutes without testing is risky. It might work for you if you happen to accidentally get it to the right temp, but you might not and you'll end up with a glob of goo. I pre-mixed the peanut butter, marshmallow fluff, vanilla and melted butter in a glass bowl. Brought the milk and sugars to soft ball stage (about 117-118 C - I tested it!) dumped that into the glass bowl, then stirred it all vigorously with a wooden spoon until it turned into fudge which took about 2-4 minutes. I only made a half batch and it was plenty. I used natural peanut butter and it tasted great. Good luck.

Great creamy fudge everyone loved. Followed instructions making sure to start 7 minutes at full boil and it turned out perfect. Unfortunately it was second batch. The first time I read tips in reviews, measured temp, waited to cool before adding pb and vanilla and it ended up in trash. If you follow given instructions there will be no problems. i should have known it wouldn't have had such a great score otherwise!

First, let me just say that the flavor was FANTASTIC. Absolutely delicious and oh so creamy. But it was so runny that I had to keep it in the freezer. Even straight out of the freezer, I could cut it easily with a butter knife. The stuff just melted in our hands as we ate it. Maybe I didn't boil it long enough. I'm willing to try this recipe again because of the amazing flavor but next time I will follow other reviewers' advice about boiling to the softball stage.

Made this recipe as stated last night for work today. It turned out really nice considering it was my first attempt at fudge. I will state, however, that it is a tad sweet for my taste and I would probably cut back on the sugar a quarter cup in the future. Not sure what I would need to do to make up for that. Also, I think this might be very nice with a little sea salt sprinkled on top.

This tastes just the same as the inside of a Hershey's Reese! Really good, but also really sweet. Mine turned out slightly grainy, but I didn't use a candy thermometer or anything. Also, by the second day, my fudge was leaking oil, so that was a put-off.

This fudge is delicious.  I was worried it would be too too sweet with all the sugar, brown sugar and marshmallow creme, but it turns out perfectly balanced.  It makes a large amount of fudge, so I slice it in blocks and freeze some.  This is a keeper.

By far the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had. I gave it away in candy/cookie packages to friends and family this holiday season and everyone LOVED it. I will absolutely make this fudge every year.

WOW!  Talk about the most perfect pb fudge EVER!!  This was my first attempt at making "real" fudge.  Usually I buy the stuff you microwave and mix together, but I was ready to try it.  It turned out PERFECT. =)  I followed the recipe exactly and stirred constantly until it was boiling, then set the timer for 7 min and let it boil on medium without stirring.  I am so happy and proud, and I now have another favorite for family get togethers.

I have made this 2 times.  The first was good but dry the second was perfect.  Make sure when you make this to use a good quality peanut butter like Peter Pan.

I have been making this fudge for the last few years for Cristmas gifts. I love it ! And I don't have any problems with getting it to come out right folowing the instructions.
 I prepare all the ingredients before I start cooking and it's all ready to blend in at the right time.
 I love the peanut butter taste, and the creamy texture of this fudge.

My grandma used to make this every fall.  I could never find her recipe (probably was in her head).  This is it!!!!  Easy and tasty, but you do have to watch the temps on a candy thermometer as suggested by another poster.

This recipe is good but I have tasted better. It set up well but I could definitely taste the brown sugar. I had to use a reduced fat peanut butter because I accidently picked up a jar of extra crunchy at the stor and I really wanted a smooth fudge. I may try this again with regular peanut butter.

This fudge tasted fantastic!  I made it vegan style, which means I used vegan soy margarine, ricemallow creme, natural peanut butter, organic sugars, and organic vanilla.  It was sooooo delicious!  I did have to follow candy-making guidelines rather than the recipe's instructions and use a candy thermometer, cooking to about 234 degrees, then cooling to 110 degrees before beating it.  Great fudge!

This is excellent!  My mom and I made 4 different kinds of fudge and this one is the best.  Kinda tastes like the middle of a reese cup.  I took some of the different fudges to work to share and this one went first.  I've had several people ask for the recipe.  Fortunately, I still have some left at home.  Whew!  I will definitely make this again.

I have been using this same recipe for the past 3 years without changing a thing.  A couple of batches have not been firm enough, but it was because I didn't let it cook long enough - there is a science, and I found that electric stove present more challenges than gas stoves.  I have received so many compliments and so many people asking for the recipe.  I look forward to making it every year, and have found myself creating a wonderful tradition for my family.  Merry Christmas, Everyone!

For a fudge that takes the easy way out by using marshmallow cream, I found this recipe pretty difficult to get right.  Mine was on the crumbly/dry side, which apparently means I boiled it too long.  Fudge can be tricky.  The flavor was good though and I'll attempt it again to get the "creamy" experience!

Good taste and is very creamy. People at work thought it was good. But it does not set up like normal fudge. It is very soft and must be kept in the fridge. Will boil longer next time and let it cool before I add the peanut butter and marshmallow to see if that helps.

Turned out perfect. Great recipe. Didnt have to tweak anything (and that is unsual with the recipes you get on here. Also, if the fudge didnt set, then it wasnt boiled long enough. Make sure it is boiling before you set the 7 minute boil timer)

yummy I loved this fudge. I used a candy therm. and it took about 13 min for it to reach 235 as opposed to 7 min. mabe this is why som are having trouble with it setting up. mine was great. half of this is for a gift the other half is for a party and I will not be ashamed to take this at all. give this a try but use a candy therm.

VERY good fudge. I made a few other recipes from this site and this one is by far the best peanut butter fudge recipe. It also keeps well for a while as long as it is in a tupperware container or in a ziploc bag.

This fudge was delicious.  I was afraid it would turn out a bit grainy, but it didn't.  My Aunt Debbie used to make to-die-for peanut butter fudge and I was looking to recreate her recipe.  This was not it, but very good!  Thanks for sharing.

First time making fudge and first time trying peanut butter fudge - delish!  Unless you are an experienced candy maker I wouldn't even attempt this without a theomometer.  It took quite some time to bring to a boil - then start timing for 7 minutes.

The BEST.  Look no further, because this recipe ROCKS!  I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit, and everyones favorite, so I doubled the already large recipe for Christmas and made it again.  I had more fudge then a fudge shop..... and it's all gone.  Thanks a bunch!

Awesome fudge.  I've tried alot of recipes, but this one tasted great and held it's shape.

I used one of the others suggestion and made chocolate peanutbutter fudge.  After boiling for 7 minutes, separate the heated mix in half and added 1 bad of chocolate chips to one and 1 cup peanut butter to the other.  Poured them in the pan then swirled them together.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving.  It makes alot of fudge!

This recipe never fails me. It makes a generous portion {13x9 pan}, and keeps EXTREMELY well. Not that it lasts that long at my house....I have found that I prefer the taste of this when I use non-generic peanut butter. It just seems to come out a bit more peanut-buttery. This recipe makes you look like a pro in the kitchen, so be sure to pass some of the fudge out as little gifts for co-workers, family and such. They'll be awed by your prowess! Thanks so much Janet.

Great flavor, makes an enormous amount of fudge.  My only negative is that this fudge is very soft, and must be kept in the fridge.

This is the BEST and easiest PB fudge recipe I have ran across during years of experimenting. I used margarine instead of butter. Also, once it begins to boil, you time it 8 minutes from that point. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent, easy, foolproof recipe that needs no alteration. No need for a candy thermometer since it cooks by time. Makes A LOT, because it is so rich you will cut into very small pieces, so consider halving it. Or make the full recipe for yourself and plan to give some away as gifts to teachers, coaches, neighbors. All my recipients asked for the recipe immediately. Can use chunky peanut butter if you like. Store in refrigerator for best consistency.

My husband has been nagging me to make peanut butter fudge "just like [his] grandma's." I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. Not only was this fudge so easy to make, it was BETTER than his grandma's! ;) It was gone in two days! Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good, exceptionally easy, delicious and creamy.  But unless you have many avid peanut butter lovers in your family, I suggest halving the recipe.  I am obviously the only one in my family, aside from my 90 year old great aunt, who likes peanut butter so I was stuck with all this fudge! I did give it to my neigbors as little Christmas gifts however, and they enjoyed it!! Great recipe!

This really was the best peanut butter fudge I have ever tasted!  My uncle got angry whenever anyone else ate some because he wanted it all to himself.  I've made it three times already and it's the only recipe I will use from now on.

I have been looking for a peanut butter fudge recipe that uses marshmallow cream and this tastes better than any I have tried.Also it was so easy that my 12 year old can make it with supervision.

The taste is great, but sometimes, believe it or not, the texture is too creamy and difficult to cut, no matter how long I let it set. However, everone who tries it always asks for the recipe. However, I like a somewhat drier taste.

Yummy, easy recipe.  Very sweet.  I wanted to make chocolate peanut butter fudge so I added 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate to the sugar mix.  I also added a bit more peanut butter.  Worked out very well, although next time, I'll probably add more chocolate because the peanut butter was very overwhelming.

I never even liked fudge until I made this recipe. Very easy to make. I have not had a bad batch yet and I have made this recipe about five times in the past year. Makes a very large portion which is great because there is plenty to give to friends. I have never had the grainy problem that others talk about.

I was a little disappointed in the texture (a little grainy) and it also didn't set right.  I followed the directions exactly.  They were o.k. in the frig, though.  It was good -- just not terrific.  The kids liked them, but the husband didn't care for them as much.  I think I'll keep looking.  Thanks!

I remember as a child having peanut butter fudge made from Fluff. It was the best fudge I ever had. I have tried for years to find fudge that tasted exactly like that. Well I finally found it! And it tastes as good now as it did back them. YUMMY!!

Yum! THe creamiest Ive ever made- the first time I made it, I boiled it according to the recipe, and it turned out a little too soft, but still good. This time, I boiled for 9 minutes, which was just what it needed-perfect!

I have been craving peanut butter fudge forever, and everytime I try to make it, it turns out gooey and sticky and tastes terrible.  But, I decided to try this recipe anyways, and I am SO glad that I did.  Even my husband who doesn't care for peanut butter fudge loved it.  My picky 2 year old son, keeps asking for more now that its gone.. guess mommy found a new family favorite!!  This recipe was so simple, and it turned out great!  thank you!! UPDATE! I took this fudge to our family christmas dinner, and it went so fast!  My brother had to take some home with him, and guess what they didn't even make it that far! Thanks again this is a great recipe!!

Excellent flavor and it IS creamy - wish it could be just a little more firm so it would be easier to cut even, clean pieces.  Makes a lot!

Ok FANTASTIC. I have NEVER in 67 years could make fudge. So I braved it and tried this recipe.
Oh my gosh, my teenage grandaughters think I'm the berries now. So easy. For me the secret was to bring sugar, butter & milk over med heat till all was dissolved, then turned heat up a little, when I saw the bubbles start, I STOPPED stirring and set timer for 7 minutes, well I went to 8 minutes. Note it was hard not to touch it. It was a full boil 8 minutes. Took off heat, dumped in 1/2 bag small marshmallows, J*ff Peanut butter and vanilla, then stirred like crazy. It started setting up, poured into greased baking dish and popped in frige. It is wonderful, creamy, not too sweet. Go ahead just try it, you won't be sorry. May be a little chunkier in weight but life is short.

I've made this recipe "as is" several times and it never disappoints.  This is the only pb fudge recipe that I've ever had to turn out.  Make sure you get it to a good rolling boil before you start the timer and don't touch it for the full 7 minutes!  I cut the recipe in half once and it came out a bit gritty but still delicious.  I love that you don't have to worry about soft balls or thermometers.  Watch the video, if you only read the instructions you may not realize to stop stirring.

I followed the recipe exactly but perhaps I should have followed some other user reviews. My "fudge" was smooth, creamy and had a good taste but it wasn't what I'd call fudge. After chilling for hours its still soft and easily squished, it never hardened to an actual fudge consistency.

Soo good.  Had never made fudge before this. I watched the video a few times, followed the instructions precisely.  Turned out great. I used jiffy peanut butter and organic butter.  The fudge was delicious. It was perhaps a little more crumbly than I expected it to be and I wonder what adjustments might be made to make it a little creamier, but overall no complaints--I will definately be making this recipe again.

This recipe is so freakin' easy!!! Just follow the directions exactly and it will be perfect. No need for thermometers or anything else. Just remember...STIR CONSTANTLY until it boils then...DO NOT TOUCH IT once it comes to a rolling boil...just make sure it stays boiling for the full 7 minutes and that your fire is not up too high or it might burn. Easy peasy and perfectly creamy fudge.  I also substituted 6 cups of chocolate chips (4 c milk and 2 c semi-sweet) for the peanut butter and it was also perfect!  Don't over-think this people!!!

Easy and delish. Look, there is no reason to make a big, complicated chemistry project out of this. The beauty of the recipe is that YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT softball, hard crack, thermometers and various kitchen accoutrements. Make the fudge following the recipe and call it a day! It has never failed. The comments above that have been too creamy, too grainy or too crumbly have altered the recipe in some way. With all due respect to previous comments and those who made them, the recipe works every time...if I follow it.

I read all the reviews and was sooooo careful about the 7 minute timing.  I stirred and stirred and when it came to a full rolling boil, out came the spoon and the timer went on.  Well, mine crumbles when I cut it, I am so disappointed since I tried to be exact!  It does taste good and isn't super sweet.  I just wish it was more like "fudge".  I'm still giving it 4 stars.  It smells and tastes wonderful, but not the super creamy I was expecting.  Probably my fault somehow though...

Sometimes I make this and it turns out so creamy and delicious.  Other times I make it, it is hard and crumbly.  It's best to use a candy thermometer to make sure it doesn't boil too long.

This turns out perfect every time if you use a candy thermometer and bring it to softball stage.  do not go by the time sometimes it is under and comes out like playdoe.  The end result is fantastic when done right.

This fudge is pretty good. Very peanut-buttery. I used a candy thermometer and cooked it to the soft ball stage, which was just a minute longer than the stated directions. It wasn't grainy or crumbly. It looked a little rough in the pan, so I used my fingers to pat it into a smooth top...which worked pretty well. Not sure if I'll make it again.

The first time I have ever made this fudge.  I over cooked it(boiled it too long).  The fudge was a little dry but still tasted good.  The 2nd time I made the fudge I  followed the directions correctly and the fudge turned out great.  Everyone at the office loved the fudge. Will absolutely make again.

I'm a Man Who has made 40 to 60lb. of this Fudge during the CHRISTMAS SEASON.  It has been a "HIT" for the last 3 years as Gifts for Friends & our annual Church Auction. My wife says I should sell it, because the reviews are exceptionally favorable, but that would take the fun out of it!  LOVE THIS RECIPE!  THANK YOU FOR IT!

I just made this today for the second time for my daughter's birthday. My family loved it at Christmas and my daughter is a PBFudge lover anyway. Each time it has come out PERFECT following these instructions!
I use a 4 Qt. heavy copper pot to make it in. I bring it to a full boil then reduce the heat to just a STEADY low rolling boil for 7 minutes.(If you leave it at a rapid boil it will form sugar crystals making it gritty textured). I checked it at that time (by dropping a tiny amount into a half-glass of cold water and stirring it with a butter knife to form a soft ball) and it was at soft ball stage. I then removed it from the heat and added Natural Peanutbutter,vanilla and marshmallows (32 regular sized,melted in the microwave on low level heat setting for 30 seconds at a time until melted, they will appear still puffed but will be melted when you stir them). I then stirred all the ingredients with a lg. spoon until blended well then beat until it just started to lose it's glossy appearance then immediately poured into a 9x13 buttered glass baking dish.(If you beat it until all the gloss is gone it will set before you can get it poured).I've been making fudge for 50 yrs. and this is really an easy recipe.

I made 5 different kinds of fudge for Christmas this year and this was hands down the favorite at two different parties.  I made it exactly how the recipe is written and had people asking me for the recipe.  It's the perfect balance of peanut butter flavor and sweetness.  YUM!

My first time making PB fudge.. after reading reviews i to stopped stirring after it came to a boil that didnt calm down when stirred..I added a candy tempature gage and set timer for 7 minutes. at 7 minutes it was at (tread) 230 degrees, removed from heat and added the rest according to recipe..my advice would be to dont over beat , add marshmellow following with the peanutbutter and vanilla and add to prepared buttered dish quickly..Tastes Wonderful, Thank You Janet and everyone who left reviews , over 600 people gave a 5 star , had to be yummy

Smooth and creamy.....very easy to make. This is the first recipe that has successfully turned out perfect fudge. I followed the recipe. The only thing I can say to people who didn't have good results is, "I hope you are using good quality ingredients. Reduced fat or cheap peanut butter will not work. Use real butter and not margarine (too much water in margarine)." Ask any baker, quality peanut butter is key.

High altitude must cook longer than 7 minutes.  I made my first batch according to the recipie and it came out with the texturee and density of custard.  I tried again with a candy thermometer and it took my sugar 11 minutes to reach soft ball stage at 6064 ft.  The second batch was heavenly, best fudge ever.

Followed the recpie exactly as written, yet the fudge ended up grainy.  Will try this recipe again, but I doubt it will replace my current peanut butter fudge recipe

So yummy and super-simple.  I used an 18 oz jar of peanut butter, as I could not find a 16 oz jar. I did not stir the mixture at all while boiling for 7 minutes, except to scrape down the sides of the pot a little.  Make sure you have a good steady boil before timing it for 7 minutes.  I also lined my pan with foil then peeled the foil away once the fudge was set.... no mess!  It's so creamy and full of flavor!  My family loves this recipe, definitely a keeper.

I love when the star reviews on here match up to the recipe. This recipe is awesome. The fudge is creamy and delicious. I didn't have to change a thing to make it that way! My family has already devoured 2 turns of this stuff and I am currently working on my third batch.

Fudge is tricky. I've just started making it a couple of years ago and fail more than I win. Then I went to a candy class. Came home and got cocky and tried again. Maple pecan fudge. I turned to sand. I turned to the internet and found that Maple was one of the more difficult fudges to make (and expensive) so I decided to try this peanut butter fudge. I read the reviews and learned to not touch the fudge while it was full boiling, to time it for 7 minutes and that under boiling and over boiling can lead to sand or huge crystals. To use the thermometer AND check for soft ball stage and stir and stir and you need a good arm. I thought I'd failed -- again -- as it looked like a goopie mess and yet I stirred. And then it happened, the gloss turned dull and it was so difficult to stir. I poured it into a buttered pan and then tasted it. YUM!!! The best peanut butter fudge I've ever had.  Practice *IS* making perfect!

this is the first time i made peanut butter fudge. I did follow some of the reviews that said let sugar mixtures boil for 7 minutes without stirring, i admit i did stir 2x just to make sure it didnt stick. I let fudge cool at room temp. over nite, and cut into squares next morning, absolutely delicious, a little sweet so next time i think i may only use 3 cups of white sugar instead of 4, and will add chopped dry roasted peanuts, other than than a very excellent receipe that i will be making again soon.

This is a fantastic recipe! I made it and took it into work where a co-worker compared it to peanutbutter cookie dough. Be prepared to constantly stir so it doesn't burn but it's definetly worth it!

This fudge is so good! A very nice texture. Following the advice of another reviewer, I did not stir the mixture AT ALL during the 7 minutes of boiling. Turned out perfect... thanks for the great recipe!

When making this, I took JTODDM's advice to cook it to soft ball stage, and it turned out perfectly. I might not have cooked it QUITE long enough, but by the time I stirred in the peanut butter and vanilla, it didn't really matter. Perfectly smooth and creamy. I also added a topping made from raspberry jam mixed with a little lemon juice and water. It added a touched of brightness that kept it from being too overwhelmingly rich for me. Great and easy, and I'd make it again in a hot minute.

I didn't have time to read all the reviews, so I just followed the recipe exactly. I had my stove set on medium (5 of 10). After waiting 20+ minutes for it to boil, I decided to turn it up to 6 then almost to 7. It finally started boiling, so I reduced the heat back to 5. I stirred the entire time, 30+ minutes. I immediately added the other ingredients as directed then let it cool over night. I cut into it this morning... it was a little soft, but nothing that couldn't be firmed up in the fridge. I put it in the freezer for maybe 10 minutes then cut it up easily. I also attribute some of the softness to the horrific Alabama humidity. It tastes Amazing!!! The recipe also makes a ton! Very thick even using a 9x13.

Following reviews of others, I (1) brought the sugars/butter/evap milk to soft ball stage - which was 12 minutes at high altitude (7220') and (2) substituted 7 oz. of mini marshmallows for marshmallow creme.  While adding the vanilla and stirring, the whole mixture turned to crumbs!  Suitable, possibly, for ice cream topping or on some kind of cheesecake or something?  Tasty, but doesn't resemble fudge in the least.  See photo of some crumbs in my green Martin's Glass House bowl!  It made quite a bit of "crumb topping," so I likely won't need to make this recipe again for a long time if I want more crumb topping!  I hate to rate it low because I subbed regular mini marshmallows when it called for creme; but it does taste okay, and it can at least be used for something, so I'm giving it 4.  It'd get a "5" if the recipe had been intended to make crumbs! :-)

Excellent flavor and texture, didn't need to adjust ingredients or measurements at all BUT I followed some of the other reviewers advice and stirred constantly until it came to a boil and then STOPPED STIRRING while it boiled away for another 7 minutes. Very easy and delicious!

These were relatively easy to make.  A bit dry/crumbly if you ask me but I am not a big fan of fudge.  My hubby said that he wanted to sit in front of the TV with the tray and a gallon of milk...guess he likes them!

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it came out the way it is supposed to.  That being said, I did not like it much.  It tasted like a lump of sweet peanut butter frosting.  It was hard to get out the pan as well.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I would not make this again.

I took the advice of some of the reviews about not stirring once it reaches a full rolling boil, (it only took 7 minutes to reach the soft ball stage from the minute it started boiling) and I waited until it cooled to about 120 before adding the peanut butter. But, be forewarned that you have to work fast to be able to mix it well at this point and get it in the pan. I had to butter both of my hands and mash it out. Good workout. It's worth it though. I may try putting the peanut butter in at the same time I do the marshmallow creme next time and right into the pan.

Weighed ingredients, used candy thermometer, followed tips in reviews. Recipe still failed. Perhaps it was humidity or room temperature.

I've never had a reliable peanut butter fudge recipe until now!  I love this recipe.  Easy Easy Easy.  Followed the recipe perfectly and it set perfectly just sitting out on my counter.  Raves from everyone that ate it.  I'm so glad I found this recipe before the holidays!  I lined the dish with foil and popped it out when it was firm- made it easier to cut.  Did cut it small--very rich.

This was great! I boiled it for about 7 and a half minutes and used marshmallows as I couldn't find the creme at my store (I put in about 28 large marshmallows). I put the marshmallows in while it was still quite hot (I don't have a candy thermometer so I just kind of guessed) because I was afraid they wouldn't melt, then I let it cool down a bit more and put the peanut butter and vanilla in. It worked perfectly! Definitely will make again. Thanks!

I just made this recipe and Aunt Teens Chocolate Fudge.  I had better luck with this recipe.  I had a candy thermometer in the mix, but I decided to follow the recipe and not worry about the temperature on the thermometer (which got to about 250 degrees at the end of 7 minutes).  I stirred constantly until it was to a full boil and then left it alone on the advice of other reviewers.  After the 7 minutes I added the marshmellow, vanilla and peanut butter right away.  I stirred it until it was smooth and poured it into a pan that I lined with plastic wrap.  I left it out to cool (did not refrigerate) and it firmed up pretty good.  The texture is very creamy and not as hard as the chocolate fudge.  It is extremely sweet though so I cut the pieces small!

I am not a fan of PB Fudge.  I made this recipe for our LWML sale last year.  They took orders for 20 extra batches after I made 10 to sell.  I will continue to make this for this event each year and never share my secret!

OMG!!! This had THEE best flavor, texture...yummie!!! OK, the only problem is I could not get it to set 'hard'...so, I'm definitely making again...but letting it boil a tad bit longer than stated...and then letting it cool down a bit before adding the peanut butter and marshmellow!  Everyone still ate it, though...I just kept it in the fridge at all times to keep it somewhat 'hard like' otherwise it would turn to mush!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  It was very easy to make.  I did use a candy themometer to 240 degrees.  I also made it easy to get out of the pan by lining the pan with saran wrap, (doube wrapped it to make sure it was up high enough on the sides.)   I made it for gifts, but found it hard to stay away from!  I will definitely make this part of my Christmas tradition!  PS, I did follow the hints of the seven minute boil starting at a rolling boil stage, and stirred constantly up to that point.

This was my first time making any fudge and it turned out great. I read some of the other reviews and made sure it was a rolling boil for a full 7-8 minutes. I also waited about 5-10 minutes before adding the marshmallow and the peanut butter. I waited till the next morning when it had cooled and frosted it with melted chocolate chips. I got rave reviews and couldn't keep my 7 year old out of it! The texture was perfect, I will be making this every year now.

Yum!  This fudge recipe rocks!!  One small word of caution, what I call a medium saucepan is WAY TOO SMALL to contain the sugar mixture once its been boiling for awhile.  I had to make an emergency "mid-boil" switch into a bigger pot as my sugar boiled over!  Yikes!!!  {the fudge was still divine...!}

Great recipe! This fudge is easy to make and the brown sugar gives it a little richer taste. The only thing I would do differently next time to make it easier to remove the fudge after it has set up, is that I would line the baking pan with foil and grease the foil with butter. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked 7 minutes from full rolling boil, tested a drop of fudge in ice water to ascertain it had reached soft ball stage and it was perfect. If you're not experienced at making fudge, candy thermometers are inexpensive and help assure you've cooked long enough, etc.

First time I had no candy thermometer - terrible.  I cooked it too long and by the time I got to mixing the PB it was solidifying on me.  SOO...got a candy thermometer the next time.  I also read from another fudge review about mixing up the PB and Marshmellow cream and this also worked like a charm.  This time - creamy goodness!!!  I will never try to make fudge again without a candy thermometer.  I also like lining the pan with foil instead of greasing it up.

This stuff is awesome!! I have been making this for my husband and his family for 6 years and they love it!! The only prep changes I make are adding the peanut butter, mallow creme and vanilla at the same time. Saves on stirring!

This is the first try for me on peanut butter fudge but I think it turned out well. I followed the recipe exactly except for the boil time I used a candy thermometer and cooked to soft ball stage in a cast iron pan which held the heat long enough to mix in all the ingredients. Turn out smooth and just the right firmness.

This was a very easy recipe to make, although the fudge didn't turn out quite as hard as I'd have liked it to be.  When I brought it in to work, most of the comments involved the fudge simply being too sweet.  Only one fellow here can stand more than a sliver of the stuff at a time.  I'm probably going to melt most of it down and try to make some cookie out of it, in hopes of dulling the sweetness.

My grandma used to make fudge when I was a girl but never used a recipe.  Since this one used all her ingredients I gave it a shot and it was fantastic.  Even better than hers.  No one at Christmas believed I had made it and assumed it was purchased.  There wasn't a single piece left.  Perfectly creamy and rich like PB fudge should be.

This is a very good recipe. I enjoyed the flavor and the texture. However, it took me two times to get it right. The first time, I followed the advice on one of the reviews that was incorrect. The review said to boil the mixture at 240 degrees, then to let it cool before adding the marshmellow creme, peanut butter, and vanilla. Well, as I was letting the mixture cool, it was hardening in the pot. You should add the remaining ingrediants as soon as you remove the pot from the heat. Then, poor the mixture into the greased pan and let cool. The only advice that I would have is to make sure that you have a large enough pan so that your fudge is not too thick. Thanks for the recipe. I will definetely use it over and over.

I tried this recipe for the first time this year, along with the many other cookies and candies I make every year.  It was a hit with everyone who tried it.  I recommend chilling before trying to cut into pieces.  I will definately make this recipe again next year!

The flavor is good, but I've run into the problems that others seem to have had -- crumbly fudge. I measured with a candy thermometer to the soft ball stage, and let it cool, but I guess it did the "seizing up" thing. I may give it another try, this time:

1) Just boil for 7 minutes, forget the thermometer

2) Don't stir during boiling (the instructions don't say if I should or not, and I am afraid to let sugar, butter, and milk boil without stirring! I guess that's the wrong thing to do). 

3) Use a larger pot

This was the best tasting Peanut Butter Fudge, and it was so easy to make. My family and friends loved it. I put in 4 cups of miniature marshmallows instead of the marshmallow creme. It gave it a lighter taste. I also put in one 18 ounce jar of super chunk peanut butter. This recipe is definately a keeper.

This is a wonderful fudge recipe.  I had never made fudge before trying this recipe.  It earned rave reviews with my coworkers. As long as it is cooked between 234-240 degrees, it comes out great!  I cook it to 237 degrees and comes out perfect.  What an easy recipe.

I was sorry I tried this recipe because the fudge is way too soft.  I have to keep in in the freezer and serve it frozen or it is very mushy.  I was going to give it in Christmas tins as a gift,but it would be a huge mess if I did and ruin the other candy.

This was a good tasting fudge--but I'm giving it three stars because I've made much better tasting peanut butter fudge from a more simple recipe. For starters the listed times are way off. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to make and isn't ready in 50 minutes, as listed. For me it took almost a half an hour to even come to a boil. I boiled it for about 8 minutes but it was still a teensy bit grainy and it probably needed a couple more minutes of boiling time. Also, it never really set up as firm as I like. It was still a bit too soft for my tastes even after sitting in the fridge overnight. Don't get me wrong, anything with 5 cups of sugar, peanut butter and butter in it is bound to taste good, and this did taste good--there are just better Peanut Butter Fudge recipes out there.

I had no problems with this recipe.  I've made fudge before and just can't seem to stand to watch a candy thermometer.  This fudge did not have crystals in it clear to the end, which wasn't long.  It didn't last long at our house.  This is now my FAVORITE peanut butter fudge recipe!

I can't say enough about this recipe.  I consider myself a pretty good cook but I have never had an luck with fudge.  I tried this recipe at Christmas. It came out great.  The texture was perfect, not too soft and not too firm.  I could tell that it was going to be awesome while I was pouring it into the dish.  It looked like silk.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.

Wow!  I've been a little fudge obsessed over the past 4 years and this is the best fudge I've made!  A definite keeper.  We used natural peanut butter and it gave the fudge a nice taste and feel.  Regular peanut butter would be creamier but we liked the texture of the natural.

I have made this recipe probably about 20 times and I figured it was about time to rate it. I love to bake, but not fudge. It is just so hard to make. NOT this recipe. It is so easy and turns out perfect EVERY time. It only turned out dry one time, but that was my fault due to over cooking. Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

Excellent recipe! I made it exactly as you were supposed to except for boiling for 8 minutes as I do my chocolate fudge recipe, that is very similar, and it turned out perfect. Slightly soft, just the way most people love it. Just the right peanut butter flavor. Thanks so much for a great recipe! This will definitely be the only peanut butter fudge recipe I'll need from now on!

This was my first attempt at fudge.My family absolutely loved it, and it was just so easy to make.The only suggestion I would make would be to cook this in a large pot.As I was stirring this in a medium pan as it boiled it started to boil up and over. Thankfully, I was able to transfer to larger pot and not ruin the boil time.
I can't wait to make this recie again. It is definetly a diet breaker!!

This is my NEW PB fudge recipe, replacing the one I have used for 15 years!  The brown sugar made it wonderful!  I used a candy thermometer, and cooked till 235 degrees..perfect!  Made a 9x13 pan of very thick pieces! Thank you for the recipe!

The best peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever used.  Make sure you spend $5 and invest in a candy thermometer.  It is a must when making candy.  I have made this with light brown and dark brown sugar.  I like the dark brown the best!!  Use a good peanut butter.  Go to a Trader Joe's or a whole foods market where you can get peanut butter that just contains peanuts, and maybe some salt.  I prefer unsalted...but to each, her own. If you get the brand that the market carries, that is natural, it is very hard at the bottom of the jar and takes forever to melt.  If you are making lots of candy to give away for the holidays, it will spare your arm.  Thanks for the recipe.  It will be my peanut butter fudge recipe for life.

Loved this recipe. The kids at the school I teach at loved it too. Was asked by quite a few people for the recipe. I added a little more peanut butter than the recipe called for (about half a cup) and it brought out much more flavor.

Be sure you don't undercook it, or it will be too soft.

This was awesome! It was my first time making peanut butter fudge and I was ecstatic that it set and everyone loved it. I only had wished I had cut the recipe down, a 9x13 pan of fudge is alot.

WOW!!!  This was just awesome!  The only think I'll do different next time, is use a bigger suace pan.  This is really good, really creamy, and simple to boot.  All my guests loved it, and everyone was asking for the recipe!

This fudge is so good!  I didn't change a thing - just followed the recipe to the letter.  I turned out three beautiful batches to divide up for Christmas gifts.    Just be careful not to overcook the sugar mixture - your fudge could end up really dry and hard.

Tastes pretty good but I found the texture too grainy and softer than I'm used to for fudge. Looks nice with melted chocolate drizzled on top and swirled with a toothpick for a marbled effect.

Well, I don't know what I did wrong, but my fudge never 'set up'.  I ended up with a delicious tasting pan of... mush. So, the flavor was excellent, but the consistency was definitely not.
Of course, I couldn't just pitch it, so I got creative and put it in jars mixed with chocolate chips and gave it away for Christmas as  "Peanut Butter Cup Spread".  I've been told it's delicious on graham crackers!

As its name says, this is a very creamy fudge, and it has an excellent flavor.  I thought it was a little soft and kept it in the refrigerator.  It seemed to get a better flavor the next day after making.

The peanut butter flavor in this recipe was perfect. However, I found it a bit grainy in texture due to all the white sugar. In my second batch I replaced the white sugar with powdered sugar and it came out wonderfully creamy.

Wow, what a fudge! It's soft, creamy melt in your mouth. We did 2 baking sticks of peanut butter (just a little more than the recipe calls for) and it's peanutbuttery! One square is enough to satisfy your sweet tooth, it's very rich as well. YUMMY!

Best tasting PB Fudge & you will have lots to share! I used Imperial margarine instead of butter, Reeses PB & cooked 8 mins. I couldn't spread mine fast enough and it started to get cracked and crumbly on top, so I used a spoon in a baggie coated with margarine to temporarily moisten back up and smooth out, it worked beautifully! Hubby likes it cold, so I refridgerated & cut with flat metal chopper for a professional look.

This is my second Christmas for this fudge recipe, and it's Christmas Eve and I'm getting ready to make my 2nd batch (the 1st one is almost gone). One hint I do have for 1st time users is:    Start counting your 7 minute boil after the mixture come to a full boil, one that you cannot stir down. Good Luck, and Merry Christmas

This peanut butter fudge is by far the best I have ever had...I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  The only suggestions I have for the recipe is to mix the ingredients in a large saucepan instead of medium and to zap the peanut butter in the microwave for about a minute before adding.  You won't be disappointed!

I tried 2 other Peanut Butter Fudge recipes (disappointing) and then I came to All Recipes. This recipe is "THE TICKET".  If you follow the directions, you will be sooooooo happy with the results. My husband said that this fudge is awesome. My search ends here, This is the best Peanut butter fudge!!!

By far the easiest recipe for pb fudge I've ever found.  My husband has spent 60 yrs trekking the US buying fudge.  This recipe is as good as any he's found and it's so easy to make, I no longer dread him asking me to make pb fudge.  I did add a minute to the boiling time, but other than that, it comes out perfect as is.

I've tried oodles of pb fudge recipes and this one was the easiest and most successful. It makes a wonderful,creamy fudge that disappears quickly. If you follow the recipe you will be successful. If you can't make this fudge than maybe cooking is not your fortay..it's that easy! Thanks Janet for the great recipe!

Excellent flavor but it did come out very soft.  I had to keep it the refrigerator otherwise it'd be so soft it was hard to pick up.  After making it a second time and boiling it longer it set much better.

I had very high hopes for this recipe after seeing all the great reviews here.  I followed the directions closely and was left with a very soft fudge that wasn't even cuttable.  I put it in the freezer hoping that it would harden up some, but it was still way too soft.  I let it sit out again and added a few more cups of sugar to it and that thickened the consistency.  The result is a decent fudge, but not one I'd get too excited about.

This was a pretty good recipe but there were two major flaws with the recipe.  One flaw was that the fudge is so creamy that it almost has a mushy consistency, and you can't leave it out for too long because it melts very easily.  The second flaw was that it made so much that even after I gave most of it away I still ended up throwing some of it in the garbage.  The fudge had a nice flavor but if you're looking for a normal peanut butter fudge recipe this recipe isn't for you.

Great recipe and very easy, double the recipe because I wanted a lot and one is definatly enough.  It was a lot of fudge but it got eaten all of it!  Be careful to cook the full time and maybe a minute over (but not any longer) is very good!

Great! All the children loved it, especially my little one (who eats peanut butter out of the jar)
My husband said it was good, but too sweet, he only had 1 piece which he would took one bite of every day and returned it to the container. Over all I was very pleased with this recipe. Thank you.

This fudge is great, though there is a LOT of it...seriously consider cutting the recipe in half if few will be enjoying it!  Next time I think I will add some chocolate, simply b/c my family prefers it to solid peanut butter....but a wonderful change and a FANTASTIC end result for a first-time fudge maker!!

This was my first attempt at fudge.  I made it for a bake sale and most of it was eaten my fellow classmates!  I had many comments that they wanted the recipe because it was the "creamiest fudge and not gritty"  I was very satisfied with the recipe and the turn out. Thanks!

This recipe was quick and easy.  The fudge turned out tasting good, but it was dry and crumbly.  Neither of my children liked it and they both love peanut butter.

This was my first fudge making experience and it was FILLED with complements at our church Christmas party!  It was SO quick and easy to make!  I made it only an hour before the party!  I’d never made fudge so I didn’t know how long it would take to cool.  I stuck it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes (that’s all the time I had) and it was still kind of warm when I took it out and cut it up, but it still turned out GREAT!  I couldn’t believe how many complements I got on it!  I honestly almost wasn’t going to take it ‘cause I thought that it was a little too grainy (I could feel the sugar granules in each bite).  I think next time I either boil it for longer or use a medium-high temperature rather than just medium.  I highly recommend this recipe to ANYONE (it is honestly that easy and that good!)

Peanut butter flavored sugar. sugar sugar and more sugar. sugar lovers thought this was great. i'm not a big sugar fan, but those with a sweet tooth said this was really good. (emphasis on really and one of them always makes candy and fudge)

The flavour of this fudge is lovely, but I found the consistancy far too soft for my liking.  Even refrigerated it did not come out as proper firm fudge pieces, it remained "doughy".

The directions were perfect.  My family loved it.  It was definitely the creamiest peanut butter fudge I'd ever tasted.  I already have requests for more.  Thanks!

I modified this recipe to use less sugar, substituting stevia for the white sugar but used only 1 cup stevia for the 4 c. of white sugar, but still used the 1 c. of brown sugar though, plus I used mini marshmallows instead of the marshmallow crème. Also added 1/2 c. of Baker's Cocoa, whisked in well before boiling the first batch of ingredients. After adding the marshmallows, peanut butter and vanilla extract, I added 1 cup of uncooked oats and 1 cup of rice krispies and divided the recipe into 2-8 inch square pans.  I plan on using these bars as a substitute for breakfast bars. These are chilling at the moment and when pouring the final result into the pans the texture seemed thick enough to set up, yet nice had a fluffy, light texture, so I am anxious to try them after letting them chill a few hours.

Super easy to make. Keep it covered and only cut what you are going to eat and it won't dry out. It is very rich so a little goes a long way.

I make fudge and this recipe is very easy with no candy thermometer needed.  It is smooth and delicious.  It is very sweet but luckily I have a sweet tooth.  The only negative thing about the recipe is, it doesn't tell you not to scrape the sides of the pot.  Never ever scrape the sides of the pot while making any fudge or it will come out gritty.

Irritating that instructions don’t tell you not to stir during the 7 minute boil. First time fudge makers need to know this! I assumed it would burn if not stirred!  Also, it doesn’t state how much peanut butter in cups if all you have is the huge jar. First batch crystally and doesn’t taste very peanut buttery. I’m going to make another batch once I buy the 16oz jar of peanut butter. I’ll be back to update.

Just made today. Followed directions exactly. Found the finished product a tad dry tasting, not creamy. When I did the final step adding the peanut butter and mixing til blended, did I blend too much? I only folded it in.  Hubby thought it was a bit too sweet. I think I will go back to simpler recipes.

Amazing! I had to use actual marshmallows instead of the marshmallow creme because I couldn't find it at the grocery store.  I added about a half a bag during boiling.  It turned out delicious :)

The flavor first of all was delicious but after my family and I ate a few pieces we threw the rest away. It did not set well to form fudge it appeared greasy at the bottom and would not set at all. I feel like I did something wrong as the reviews were great. I did not stir it constantly I misread and thought it said occasionally lol! So any advice on how to get it to set would be amazing. The taste alone is worth several more tries.

This is a simple and delicious fudge recipe.  I used 13 marshmallows and 1/4 c corn syrup instead of fluff only because I didn't have fluff. it makes a very large batch.

This is the best fudge recipe ever. I accidentally left out the stick of butter, and it was still amazing! Can't wait to make it again....with the butter!

This simple and easy recipe does not take a lot of time to make but the delight that you get in eating it is well worth it. This is the creamiest peanut butter fudge I have ever made.  My family loves it.

Well, this was my first time making fudge and I was excited since there were apparently other first timers that had success by following the recipe exactly. I did this, exactly as it states. I followed everything to the T and I guess I still messed it up. Everything seemed fine until I added the peanut butter, and it immediately turned from liquid into crumbles. I'm not sure what I did wrong but I'm upset it wasn't as easy as everyone claimed it to be. I pressed it into the 9X13 since it wasn't spreadable.

Everyone that I've made this for loves it.  I get several requests to bring it to parties.  Made it for Easter Sunday this year, there was none left.  You can also freeze it and it still tastes just as good.

I made the peanut butter recipe as written, perfect!  Tried making it as chocolate fudge  and it came out crumbly, not creamy.  Only my third attempt at fudge, two out of three's not bad!

I agree with another reviewer that these are too sweet.  I thought they would be since the amount of sugar is so much more than other fudge recipes on this site, but I needed to use up some evaporated milk so I gave it a shot.  I do like the fact a thermometer does not need to be used, but like another reviewer said, it should be clear to bring the fudge ingredients to a full boil before timing for seven minutes.  Other than these two issues, it would be a very good recipes.  I won't make it again based on these assertions.  However,  I always appreciate members sharing their recipes.

The only recipe for peanut butter fudge I make and it always comes out just right and delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly and have never used a candy thermometer because I don't need to, just boil it for seven minutes. 

I've seen one review in particular that says the reviewer boils this for a total of 15 minutes.  All I can say is I don't know how on earth she winds up with fudge, as that would make it extremely dry.  

Other reviews say to ignore the seven.minutes and use a candy thermometer.   I wouldn't do that..that just makes it less likely to turn out right.

We followed the recipe exactly. The fudge never fully hardened / formed. The flavor was as if I was scooping a spoonful of peanut butter straight out of the jar. Very disappointing

This fudge is wonderful.  I didn't have light brown sugar, so I substituted dark brown sugar.  It was great.  No one I gave it to cared. ;-)  
Try this recipe, you will love it.
Oh this does make a lot of fudge.  Freeze for nibble throughout the rest of the year.

This is my new go to for peanut butter fudge. It was a hit with all my family. I’ve already made a second batch! Do exactly as the recipe says and you will not fail.    This fudge gets better with some age. Keep in air tight container. Freezes well for short time. (30days)

I'm not sure why there are so many ppl saying there's haven't turned out...this was my first time making it this way it turned absolutely marvelous!!! I stirred till it boiled .then stirred another 7 mins  constantly....poured mixture in a bowl stirred in the jar of pnut butter and marshmallow fluff had to use fluff didn't have creme and poured the mix in the pan let it set up sitting on the table. And as I said it turned out amazing better than some fudge I'd purchased from bake sales!!!

This recipe didn’t turn out well. I thought I followed the recipe recipe meticulously but it didn’t harden and was slightly grainy.

This is by far the best fudge everyone who has tried has had. This is an old fashioned style fudge that is both creamy and flaky (if that makes sense!). It makes me think of fudge from when I was a kid. I have made this several times and each has turned out perfect, I have even doubled it with no problems. Just follow the directions and start timer at a good rolling boil.

Followed the recipe exactly except before starting sugar mixture in pot, I slightly roasted peanuts and spread them evenly in the bottom of the cooling pan (on top of parchment paper). Fudge therefore has peanuts on top to add flavor and identify as  peanut fudge. Really good.

Very tasty!!!  It compares to the peanut butter fudge they make at  Ponderosa. Makes a generous 9 x 13 pan ! By the way, I stirred it during the boiling period and it turned out creamy!

Follow the directions as they are written. Don’t start timing until The fudge is at a full rolling boil. That means a boil you cannot stir down. 

 I have been making this for 15 years. Never once have I had it fail. Don’t try to make it like you do every other fudge recipe you own. Make it the way it states and you will have great fridge every single time.

After it comes to a boil DON'T  stir for 7 minutes. Take it off the heat then stir in the rest of ingredients. I only use 3 cups of white sugar and 1 of brown. I always use chunky peanut butter. I line the pan with foil and grease the foil then you can lift it out of the pan for easier cutting. Very yummy!

It tasted good, but turned out not as good as I hoped. It never solidified to fudge standards, was very crumbly and messy. It’s an okay fudge, though I wouldn’t make it again.

This is my new favorite fudge recipe. I have now made it four times and  find it to be pretty forgiving of slight variation in cooking time  (inopportune phone calls).  The fudge itself is creamy and rich with a great peanut taste.  As much as I love chocolate, this peanut butter fudge is the best.

Followed instructions completely as I've found this is a must with fudge.  Smooth and creamy but was hoping for a stronger peanut butter flavor.  Used an all Natural Peanut Butter which consisted of just dry roasted peanuts and salt.

The best I have ever made(and ate).  LOL!!   Easiest one too.  The family really enjoys this every year.    The 7 minutes is definitely the key to success.    I even added instant coffee to mine just before the boiling point and it was marvellous.

I have made this fudge for over 30 years with one slight difference, I add nuts to every now and then at my husbands request. Family and friends ask for  it every holiday season.  It makes up as easy as the recipe reads. When I first started making fudge I had one or two failed batches. Impatience is the enemy when cooking fudge. Don't start timing it until it boils and it will be perfect.

This was sooo good. Made it  exactly as written except-the whole rolling boil for 7 minutes. That was my plan but I also have a candy thermometer, so I used it & about 3.5 minutes into was at 234 degrees soft ball stage so I cooked for 1 minute longer and pulled it off (scared inside that it wouldn’t set up right) but it turned out perfect. So I guess it’s all about how you heat. I’d use a candy thermometer if you have one. This makes so much fudge I hate to mess that much up!!  Wonderful recipe!

This is the best fudge EVER!! I just made it for the first time. The only thing I did differently was to substitute the marshmallow cream. I didn’t have any, so i used  7 ounces of marshmallows and 2 tsp.light corn syrup. I softened them up in the microwave. Other than that, I made it exactly as the recipe was written, and it was AMAZING!!!!!!  I have made peanut butter fudge before, but it NEVER tasted this good!!!!

I still use a candy thermometer to get to soft ball stage. I don't trust my self or my stove. It is about the same boil time as suggested.

I do not stir once it starts a hard boil.

I do not really let it cool down much before adding the marsh mellow cream or peanut butter. Maybe just long enough to transition my supplies. I never have an issue with it seizing or being uneven.

Everyone loves this recipe and asks for it often.

I used 13 large marshmallows as equivalent to the jar of marshmallow cream and I used crunchy peanut butter because we like it better. The recipe turned out great! Not at all too soft but nice and creamy. It cut well and everyone loved it !

Made this for Christmas and it was a hit! I also made chocolate fudge using this recipe, just replacing the peanut butter for a bag of chocolate chips. Turned out great.

Great recipe. You just have to wait the full 7 minutes of it in a rolling boiling without stirring it.

I  found this recipe on this website many years ago. I make it every Christmas and it's always a hit. It's great because if you follow the instructions and cook 7 minutes you don't need a candy thermometer. Which when I started making candy I didn't. My daughter is 12 and this candy is her favorite Christmas candy and has become a tradition.

I think this recipe is great! I made the fudge exactly the way the directions said to and the fudge turned out wonderful. I think like everyone has mentioned stir until you reach boiling then leave it alone for 7 minutes. It was my first time making fudge never knew it was so easy! I have an Amish store that makes fudge around the corner from me for 2.99 per 1/4 lb. So much cheaper and tastier to make it myself at home.

I'll totally be making this again! This recipe has just the right amount of sweetness and smells amazing. Only boiled for 3 minutes, stirred during that time, and it came out great. I don't know about all the "softball stage" stuff but I'm a teenager who's been making fudge since I was 12 and I've never gone wrong. I just popped this one in the fridge and stirred it a couple times while it cooled to stop any crystallization. Perfect peanut butter smoothness :)

I followed the directions exactly and made three batches and it came out wonderfully. You definitely need to continually stir prior to the rolling boil and then set your timer for seven minutes, and remove immediately. As long as you mix in your marshmallow creme and peanut butter thoroughly, you are in for a treat!!!

I read a lot of the reviews before I made this. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not use a candy thermometer either. It set up while I was pouring it so I had high hopes. I've not made fudge before so I was nervous that it wouldn't set. So I prepared all the ingredients ahead of time. Did what the steps said and it turned out to be a lot of fudge. I used two pans!  And even had some leftover that I'm going to use to make Buckeyes like one reviewer said she did!!  The fudge I made is a tad crumbly on the outside but so creamy on the inside. I cooked it in a larger pan and let it cool on the counter. It's very tasty. Not to sweet or overpowering peanut butter taste. Thanks for an easy nom intimidating recipe. Can't wait to make again next Christmas to give away in my cookie/candy arsenal.

This fudge is so delicious!  I made it per the directions and set my timer for 7 minutes as directed and once it was cooled, it set very nicely.  This was my first attempt at fudge and I will admit, I was stressed, but it turned out great!

Read reviews first. Used two I used thermometer and didn't bother with cooling down. Followed recipe pretty much, just made sure went to softball stage.  Turned out perfect. 7 minutes,  depending on stove and cook, may or may not get you to softball stage. I cook at low medium on gas, take time working up to full roiling boil. The intent is that you reach softball stage. Also read not to stir after reaching full roiling boil, this helped to know since it doesn't specify that in directions.

Since I had never made fudge before, I watched the video that's provided. I made it exactly how it was instructed, and it turned out perfectly. I did make a mistake and used a pan that was too small and it bubbled over, so I had to transfer to a pot I use to make vegetable soup, but everything turned out fine. I agree with one of the reviewers that it could use a little bit more peanut butter.

Easiest and best recipe ever!   Don't try and skimp on the boil time, this is very important.   I stir continuously and add  the peanut butter and marshmallow creme right away.    A little goes a long way so I half the recipe.   Follow it carefully and your fudge will be beautiful!

Great recipe! I've found make sure you set the timer for 7 minutes once it's a rapid boil, not just starting to boil and you can't go wrong.  I like to cut up Reese Cup or Fast break bars and line the bottom of the pan with them before you pour the fudge into the pan. Always a hit with family and the kids!

Made a few modifications with using peanut butter chips and chocolate chips and used mini marshmallows instead of the fluff. It's cooling right now and can't wait to taste the final product. The pan scraps are yummy!

First  let me say this,  THIS IS THE  MOST SMOOTH , PERFECT  
"YUMMY-EST" FUDGE  EVER!!!  I've been  making  fudge  for  a few  years  now.  I use  a  recipe that  doesn't  require  marshmallow  cream.  It's  quite  good, but  this  is  better.  I read many reviews  before making  this, and  decided  to  settle on going by  LORNA'S review.  She basically  said  to follow  the  recipe  exactly.  She also said  to start the 7 minutes  boil timing  once it begins  to  actually boil (not when you see a bubble here or there, but an actual boil).  I did CONTINUOUSLY STIR FOR 7 MINUTES , because I didn't  want the liquid  to burn. Otherwise  I followed the recipe exactly.  No changes. No need for thermometers.  No need to refrigerate (fudge should never be refrigerated to get it to firm up). Let it sit out to cool slowly.  If the directions are folloed it will firm up. I got perfect peanut  butter  fudge and a new go to recipe to replace my other recipe! Firm and smooth!  Thanks for submitting  this one !  



Update:  Made the chocolate  chip  version as  others  suggested.  Uses 2 bags semi and 1  bag milk chocolate  chips.  Also DIDN'T  STIR DURING  7 MINUTE  BOIL.  Came out fine.  Began to set up quickly while mixing.  Nice firm , smooth  fudge.  Yummy

I made this but with a few changes.  to this recipe. and the thing is it tastes great but it won't harden into a solid chunk that I can cut into squares. I used for ingredients: 1cup BP, 1 Teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 3 cups of confectioners sugar, 1 cup of milk, a dash of salt, about half a cup of Karo Syrup (instead of sugar), and 4 Ozs of Butter. I melted the Butter, milk, BP, vanilla, and karo together. then dumped it into the powdered sugar that didn't want to get all the lumps out (I couldn't find our sifter)  so I just dumped in 3 cups, and used a Whisk.  I lined a Pan with Wax paper for easy clean up.  But like I said it never set up. I think maybe  I used too much better.

Outstanding! Creamy and smooth, just the way good fudge is supposed to be! I also followed the suggestion of 1 cup PB, 2 cups brown sugar and 3 cups confectioners sugar.  Easy & fast, it hit the spot.

I have made this recipe for 3 years now for Christmas and everybody, and I mean everybody, says it's amazing and asks me for the recipe.

This fudge has bcome a classic in my kitchen! Have been preparing it for over 5 years now, and it is still a favorite.  It is  easy to double, and keeps well when stored in an airtight container (not that I have ever had many leftovers). I have always used 

Patience is the key with it, use a candy thermometer and watch it closely. If doubling, the mixture can become pretty thick and somewhat difficult to stir , so be prepared for that., very thick wooden spoons are a must.

I spent a long time looking for Peanutbutter Fudge before finally deciding to just learn how and do it. I am, or atleast was a first time baker/candy maker so I had no prior experience at this but the first batch and everyone since has turned out amazingly.

I bake every Tuesday for the office and this is usually the default item when I don't have a lot of time in the afternoon. It takes about 30 minutes total and it's enough for about 20-30 people. I don't change anything in the recipe it is already perfect. Everyone seems to prefer the chunky peanut butter version.

This fudge is amazing. Out of all the different kinds of fudge I made and gave away over the holidays; THIS is the one I made again so I could freeze it and enjoy a little bit here and there throughout the year. 
There is one way I deviate from the recipe as it's written; I use 30 regular size marshmallows instead of the marshmallow cream. (I have a preference for campfire brand marshmallows. I think they are a higher quality product than any other brand I've used.) The grocery store was out of the cream when I was shopping for ingredients and I made the substitution. It worked and I'll stick with it because I don't wanna mess it up by doing anything different.

This recipe is easy and delish and I'm not really a peanut butter fudge fan.  I made it at the request of a friend.  I followed recipe and also tips from Lorna's review.  Once you remove mixture from heat and incorporate other ingredients, you must work quickly.  The fudge sets up fast.  It was so creamy and nice consistency.  All who sampled it said it tested like the inside of a Reese cup.  Yum - but extremely sweet for me.

I never understand when someone gives a recipe 5 stars then goes on to tell how they "improved it." This is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever made. I made it exactly as shown and it turned out perfect. I used the advice of ban_the_circus and stirred it up to the boil stage, but did not stir it even once during the 7 minute boil stage. Perfection!

I made this fudge as is..No changes at all.
Although it set up beautifully, I was disappointed with the peanut flavor. 

It has more of a sweet sugary flavor than peanut butter taste to it.
If I make it again, I will lessen the amount of marshmallow and add more peanut butter and possibly add chopped peanuts to it to add additional peanut flavor.

Great recipe overall, it just lacked the peanut flavor I was looking for.

This is the easiest and best peanut butter fudge I have ever made.  You will be successful if you time it just like the recipe tells you to do.  No need for a candy thermometer.  Don't get tired and cut the time short - it will not work if you do.

Read the first few reviews for tips. This is creamier and more "professional" tasting than "Easiest Peanut Butter Fudge" on this site (although that is a great recipe too).

I will use this as my go to peanut butter fudge recipe every time. I read the reviews and went with Lorna's advice and it turned out perfectly! I even added chocolate to the top and swirled it into this recipe. It was the best peanut butter and chocolate fudge swirl ever! It even tastes way better than what you would find in one of those expensive confectionery shops.  Also I want to add some advice- if the fudge comes out dry, use damp paper towels or a damp wash cloth. Just lay it on top of the fudge for a few hours or overnight and wrap it up. It will absorb the moisture from the towels and make the fudge moist. The damp towels method really works and it will come out perfect if the dryness is an issue.

After reading posted great reviews with helpful hints (and a candy thermometer), a first attempt at making this peanut better fudge turned out perfectly.
My batch did require setting out uncovered overnight to firm up.
Thanks to all who submitted reviews!

Fabulous fudge!!! Such a soft texture and rich creamy taste. I did use a candy thermometer and cooked to soft ball stage which took longer than the 7 minutes.

I made this because the reviews were so good.  I have made fudge several times and this fudge is so soft you can't even pick it up without it turning to mush.  I cooked it exactly according to the recipe and maybe even a bit longer.

Made this last year and it was FANTASTIC. Trying to make it this year and I don't know what I'm doing wrong!! Have tried twice with the same result...keep it on medium heat, stir constantly, can't get the stupid thing to boil, ends up scorching and then turns into a ball. Any suggestions? UPDATE: Just tried one last time and...it turned out beautifully!! When you read all the little words you realize the recipe calls for evaporated milk and not sweet and condensed milk like my grandmothers fudge!!! How embarrassing!

I have used this recipe countless times! It has a wonderful flavor.. I have just a few tricks that might help though. DO NOT stir while boiling, that is the most crucial tip I can give and since I have a gas range I only boil mine for 6 minutes. There's nothing else that can be improved upon.. Like I said, it has a wonderful flavor and like many other reviews have stated.. it's meant to be simple, so keep it that way.

I never leave reviews but this is by far the easiest best tasting peanut butter fudge.  I read all the reviews and have not had one bad batch, I have made this over 20 times in the last 3 yrs as it is a favorite amoung everyone I know.  The key is to constantly stir the mixture while it is heating to a rolling boil.  This takes about 7-10 mins on medium heat.  As soon as it is a rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down) set a timer for 7 mins exactly and do NOT stir during the 7 mins.  Another posted the same comment and it is the 1 detail that will make or break this fudge.  Enjoy

I started making this recipes last year for Christmas. First I made it as written and then I tried changing it up. I use the base of the butter, sugar, and evaporated milk, then I add the marshmallow and vanilla extract but instead of adding the peanutbutter I add 3 teaspoons of orange extract and 2 cups of dark chocolate bits, or mint extract , or almond extract and chopped almonds, or coconut extract and 1 cup of coconut, or 1 teaspoon of ground cloves, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, with the chocolate bits. This comes out great every time and I  get to make so many different flavors  from the same basic recipe.

It was easy to make, wasn"t completely creamy, but tasted really good!
I added some coarse Sea Salt to the top as it was cooling. I just love salty and sweet. Very rich and tasty. Kind of like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups with out the chocolate.

This fudge is DELICIOUS! It makes a lot of fudge, it fills the 13x9 pan about an inch high. You really need to use a large saucepan, a medium one will just overflow and make a giant mess. I used a candy thermometer because I already own one and it only took 4 minutes once it reached a boil (on medium heat as directed) to come to the appropriate temperature so I'm very glad I used it. It's a little awkward to get out of the pan since it's so creamy and soft so I had to sacrifice one of the corners (and the piece next to it) to be a taste test :-)  also, I stirred the whole time since I didn't want it to burn and don't have any granulated bits at all. Can't wait to try the chocolate version previous reviewers have mentioned!

I've made this twice in the past week and it is AWESOME!!!  Followed the instructions exactly, even though I found "boiling 7 minutes without stirring" a little intimidating (I just KNEW it would scorch or stick to the bottom of the pan!). Well, it didn't stick or scorch. Removed it from heat, stirred in the marshmallow creme til it was fully incorporated, then the pb & vanilla. Poured in pan, cooled, cut, and VOILA, it is INCREDIBLE!! Family loved it so I took some to work & they loved it too. Made the second batch today because we're just about out.  Again, it turned out perfect.  Smooth & creamy delishness, firm enough to cut but not dry or hard AT ALL.  YUM!!  Oh, and I didn't use a candy thermometer.

Made this a couple of years ago as a Christmas treat for work and neighbors. Several people asked for the recipe and a couple mentioned how it was just like the fudge they remembered as a kid. I was asked by co-workers if I would be bringing it again. This recipe is a keeper and turned out great following the instructions exactly.

My husband loves Peanut Butter Fudge and I spent several years trying different recipes and I was never really satisfied with any of them.  Many of them did not set up correctly or had a weird texture.  The first time I tried this recipe, the fudge turned out perfectly.  I had never been a fan of PB fudge but that all changed too the first time I tried it.  What made it even more fantastic was another reviewer who gave instructions on how to divide the recipe and make one with the PB and the other with chocolate chips for a batch of chocolate fudge.  So that is what I do now for my family members that love chocolate.  Although, ever since I started bringing this PB fudge to our X-Mas dinner, the rest of the family has been saying to bring more of that and less of of the chocolate.  LOL!!  Wonderful recipe and I am so happy I found it.  A lifetime keeper for sure!  5 stars!

I did not have marshmallow creme so I substituted 1 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows instead and it turned out great. I feel the addition of brown sugar is the key for this fudge to be nice and rich and creamy. Thank you for the great recipe!

I might experiment with adding a bit of salt as it is a bit too sweet. But its melt in your mouth delicious.

I never made fudge before trying this recipe and I went big with it. I quadrupled the recipe to make 4 pans at once. Hell, I even burnt some of it to the pan and it still came out great. I always heard fudge was a pain, but not anymore. Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe has saved all my friends and family from ever having to eat concoctions of candy melts again!  I am a novice cook, and definitely not experienced with candy thermometers and different stages of candy making.  Some of the reviews frightened me, so I just followed the recipe exactly.  Oh. My. Goodness.  This was the most perfect and beautiful fudge.  I will never again go to a Holiday party with something made of microwaved chocolate chips.  If this is your first attempt at candy making, it's a great place to start.  My husband had two co-workers try to place orders, thinking I was a professional!  Thanks for making me look so good!

Review on: Janet Awaldts  " Creamy Peanut Butter Fudge Recipe "
Reviewed by: Tammy Piccolo / Professional Baker
     My hubby loves peanut butter fudge. I decided to try this recipe. He rated it a four and a half...leaving a half because he said, my sisters recipe was better.    
      I did not have any evaporated milk. So I used 1 cup (8 oz ) of 2% milk and 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of heavy cream. 
     Who knows...maybe had there been evaporated milk in the pantry, he may have given it a five star rating.
     To be fair I will eventually give the original recipe a try.  ...intentual or necessary, the changes I made may have degraded the recipe.
     Thank you Janet for sharing this great recipe and for all the enjoyment my husband got from eating it...all of it...in two days flat.!

I've made chocolate fudge in the past, but never peanut butter. This fudge was very easy to make. I read the many reviews that said to stop stirring once the mixture reaches a rolling boil, and to let it boil for exactly 7 minutes. Well, this worked perfectly and the result was a creamy, delicious fudge. I removed one star because the recipe calls for way too much sugar. When I make it again I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 a cup.

I've never made fudge before this but this recipe turned out just like I expected.  I didn't make any changes and I had no problems with it turning out perfectly.  I gave out as Christmas treats and it was very delicious and very easy to make.  Awesome!

Made the peanut butter fudge for my sister for her birthday....everyone loved it!!  Said it was amazing.  I also just made the chocolate fudge version that another reviewer provided.  I DO NOT recommend the chocolate version at all!! It was not creamy like the peanut butter version.  I think 6 cups of chocolate was way too much.  It didn't mix well and after it totally set, when I cut it, pieces broke.  Did not cut as smooth as the peanut butter.

Love...Love...Love...  I have never been able to make fudge before, and I'm 61!!  This is excellent, however. by looking at other comments, I found out that you CANNOT stir for the 7 minutes...and I think that's what I was doing wrong...THAT should have been stated in the recipe...otherwise I would have given it a 5 star...but still excellent recipe.

Just finished making this and I could not be happier with the way it turned out. I've been making fudge for years and this recipe made my job just a little bit easier, thank you so much for that. It set up perfect and the taste and texture are just right. Kids are going to love it.

I just made this fudge and followed the directions to a T.  Boiled 7 minutes, stirring just enough to keep it from scorching and it turned out perfect.  My son said it's the best Peanut Butter Fudge I've ever made.  Score one for me!

This recipe was yummy.  The creaminess and richness reminded me of what the perfect peanut butter fudge should be.  Reading the reviews are so important if you want to avoid the little mistakes you could make otherwise.  The tip about starting the 7 minute cooking time only after it came to a full boil is priceless to avoid grainy texture.  I set the timer for 7 minutes once it was a full boil and when the timer went off I slowly counted to 30 just to be sure.One bit of advice I can add is if you have a man around the house to help you stir once you add the peanut butter you will appreciate him for it

Good, but (and yes, I know it's candy) too sweet for my taste. It was like concentrated sugar. I would have liked more peanut butter flavor, and less cloying sweetness. It also did not set very well. I had to keep it in the refrigerator, and even then it was soft. That could be because I am at a higher altitude (5,000 feet), and perhaps should have cooked it for longer than 7 minutes. All that said, I enjoyed it anyway!

I am at high altitude -- really need to get this up to about 240 degrees or it will be totally soft -- nice to spread on some brownies, but not anything like "fudge."  I read through all of the reviews, and even with that, I had to do two batches. High altitude really must get to the right temp.  Ps:  I threw one batch back on the stove, added in some powdered sugar stirring vigorously until stiffened up some, and it was interesting and a "new" kind of fudge. :-) Once that cooled, it was quite edible. Definitely need ways to save that many ingredients!

This was the best peanut butter fudge I ever had, my husband will eat the whole thing if I let him. Best advice I can give is make sure you are watching the boiling sugar you do not want to burn it. This is simply amazing!!!

My husband is a PB fudge lover and I have made this for him several times. I follow the direction exactly and it turns out great every time. I don't reccomend putting this in the fridge for very long though. I out it in for about an hour and then take it out. This keeps it creamy like the name says. I found out the first time I made it that it will turn hard if left in too long. Just follow the recipe and you'll have perfect fudge every time!!

Tasted pretty good but seemed slightly to much sugar flavor. Will try adding more peanut butter next time. My son and I enjoyed them more than who I made them for especially, my husband.

I made this recipe today - definitely creamy and delicious. I did, however, cut back on the sugar by one cup because I enjoy fudge that is less sweet.

This stuff is addicting. This stuff has the best flavor even though I thought OMG there is so much sugar...but it is soo good! Now, I dont' know what I did wrong though. My first time tying this and first time ever making fudge because my Blessed mother used too...this turned out to be Peanut butter soup! So for it not to go to waste I am going to back a carmel cake...or a spice cake and use this as the frosting! I will try to do this again, this time I won't leave the stove and not stir it but it nearly boiled over, so I need a larger pan too!

I attempt fudge every year around Christmas time.  THIS recipe is by far the best and easiest!  Once you have a rolling boil on Med heat set you timer for 7-8 minutes as that is the perfect cook time.  :)

Super easy, even for a first time fudge maker, lol.  Follow the recipe as written and you will be just fine.  Of all the baking and cooking I've done over the years, I've never made fudge until now.  I'll have to try my hand at chocolate next time.

This is a simple, and perfect receipe......just follow the directions.   Important....once the sugar mixture is boiling (rolling boil), set your timer for 7 minutes and do not stir!    Add the ingredients as directed after the boiling process.  Pour into wax paper lined glass 9X13 dish, cover with press and seal wrap and set in a cool place, i.e. cold garage.  My first attempt at PB fudge....perfection!!

Awesome! Simple to make, stays fresh in air tight containers, and you wont have to break the bank buying ingredients. I put a layer of chocolate ganache on mine when it was cooled.

This recipe has the best flavor of any peanut butter fudge recipe that I have tried. The critic was correct, you MUST bring this to a softball stage for it to turn out.  I also used real aka natural peanut butter and it is by far the best tasting ever

This is an amazing recipe. I've used it twice now. The first time was my first fudge ever, (I was nervous because I had observed my sister's many failed attempts) and it turned out great. The only problem is I would suggest boiling it for only six minutes, because seven minutes is too long and the fudge will be a little crumbly when it's done.

I, unfortunately, did something wrong.  It started to set up before I got the vanilla in it and then ended up very crumbly.  I hate the fact that I just spent all that money on ingredients and have to throw it away.  I even thought of just eating it myself, but the taste is strange.  Someone tell me what I needed to do.  I waited until it started boiling before I begin my 7 minute timer.  I followed everything and it didn't work.  HELP!!!  I love peanut butter fudge and want a good recipe.

Made this tonight, I followed the directions exactly as written. It came out perfect and creamy, the best peanut butter fudge I have made. I don't know what the negative reviews did wrong but this is easy and good. The only other comment, it says 24 servings, only if you want sugar overload, this makes a lot of fudge.

This was excellent. I'm not experienced with making fudge, so I was a little dubious going into this after reading some of the reviews. Truth is, it's really uncomplicated. I followed Lorna's advice and it turned out creamy, sweet, and perfectly set. I have deemed this recipe my new tradition. Thanks!

I've tried numerous PB fudge recipes and this is by far the best ever. Followed directions to the letter. One weird thing, though, is that there are little pellets of what I believe is crystallized sugar in it, and I don't know how that happened. Otherwise, creamy, amazing fudge! Oh, I live at a high altitude and still boiled it 7 minutes. Wondered about that when I started.

This is the PERFECT PB fudge recipe I have been looking for!  You do have to make sure you stir it CONSTANTLY up to the boil and the entire time it boils.  And time it right.  I only made this recipe as a half batch to make sure it was good.  So I split the recipe and put it into a 9x9 glass pan.  Love it, thank you!

This was very easy to make. I was able to adjust the recipe to make the batch as big as I wanted or as little as I wanted.  I added miniature buckeyes at the end before pouring into prepared pan.

I love this fudge recipe. It is SO easy and really fool proof. I read the reviews and saw people saying get it to softball stage before adding the rest....well at 7 minutes my mixture was right at softball stage and it turned out PERFECT! so 7 minutes after a rapid boil is pretty spot on. :)

This has to be the best fudge I've ever made. This recipe was super forgiving and easy to follow. When it reached a boil I left the kitchen for about 4 minutes and ended up having to rush back in there when I heard it boil over. Apparently my saucepan wasn't big enough. I ended up having to stir it like crazy to get it to go back down, which totally went against some of the comments saying to not touch it at all during the boil. I was afraid I'd ruined it, but it set up just fine on my counter top and is super creamy. I'm going to put it in the fridge later this evening to help it firm up a bit - right now it kind of requires a spoon to eat it, which is a great testament to its creaminess XD

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, and WOW! This is the only time I have had perfect peanut butter fudge the first time I try! I gave some to my mom and she said it was better than the pb fudge my great grandma made...which is the recipe we've used for years. I love this recipe! Thank you so much Janet for sharing :)

On a side note, I've read other peanut butter fudge recipes calling for candy thermometers, putting a drop of the mixture into water too see of it forms a ball or whatever...too much work.  I LOVE baking, but when it comes to fudge, I must stress that this was my first time ever making any kind of fudge or candy.  I followed the recipe, for the most part, to a tee.  I stirred the mixture semi-constantly (I did walk away a couple of times), and when it started to boil (rolling boil), I set my timer for 7 minutes.  I also stirred while it was boiling (I was afraid it would burn to my pot or something).  After 7 minutes, mixed in my marshmallow fluff with a wire whisk until it was thoroughly incorporated (I didn't have a 7-oz jar of fluff, I bought a 16-oz one and guestimated), then added my butter (used 2 cups of peanut butter because I had bought a big jar) and mixed with my whisk until incorporated, then guestimated 1tsp of vanilla extract.  After everything was thoroughly mixed, I poured the mix into a 13x9-in aluminum pan, let it cool until warm to the touch, and placed in the fridge overnight (I like my fudge cold).  Also, my stove has got to be the most ancient one in the world (a wall unit with the oven on top, and the part with the burners slides in and out of the wall).  DELICIOUSNESS times 10!!

Wow!  Super easy and if you do what everyone says below about letting it self-boil for 7 minutes (I cheated and did stir a few times), it's perfect.  Set up right away and tastes fabulous!  I didn't start with medium heat, but used a medium low to melt the butter with the milk and sugars.  Seemed to really dissolve better and make the fudge more creamy.  Didn't have any trouble adding in the marshmallow creme (because the mixture coming off the stove is HOT) or the PB & vanilla.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I cooked the milk/sugar/butter to 240 degrees (just over soft ball stage) and it turned out *amazing*. Not at all gritty (because of the corn syrup), and then I cut it into 1 inch cubes with a pizza cutter once cool.  

Pat it down firmly into the pan as soon as it is cool enough to touch and it makes it easier to cut without fragments.  

I added up all of the ingredients to get 76 calories per 1" square. Makes 110 inch-sized squares, so be ready to gift some!

Yummy!  I cooked two batches.  The one in the wider saucepan (10in?).  The one in the the smaller saucepan (7?) did not harden.  So I'm guessing if you have a skinnier saucepan, you will need to add more time than boiling 7 min.

This was pretty good, but it had to much peanut butter, and marshmellow fluff. I will cut those in half next time, and see how it turns out. Kids and husband had no complaints, they loved it.

I just made a batch... It was so easy, i used a candy thermometer once it hit soft ball i turned off the burner and added the PB and marshmellow.  Used a hand mixer to combine... Poured into a 8x8 wax paper lined baking pan and put in fridge over night.... It was very very good... No more paying 7.98lb at sees or somewhere like that... Thanks...

I tried this recipe and at 5 minutes the sugar had already gotten to hardball stage, when the marshmallow and peanut butter was added it turned into a peanut butter dust in the pan...any suggestions? Definatly not my mama's peanut butter fudge:)

I read loads of reviews and was confident I knew what I was doing. I follwed directions and advise exactly, the taste is there but it was really grainy. I think that means it was undercooked... but the odd thing is that it set perfectly! I will try again though  ;0)

I would add 1/4 tsp. of salt, as this fudge is a bit too sweet.  I should also add that I have the biggest sweet tooth of anyone I know, so if it's too sweet for me, it's probably too sweet for most people.  The flavor is great and it set well.

delicious!  i followed some other advice and used a thermometer.  i waited for it to boil and then watched the thermometer slowly move up to the soft ball stage.  i mixed in the marshmallow, then waited for the temp to drop a bit before adding the pb.  i forgot the vanilla, but it turned out great!!

I should have read more reviews before I made this. It's delicious, but a bit grainy if you stir it while it's boiling. The recipe as stated could be interpreted either way, but once it hits a boil STOP STIRRING! :) Delicious either way, but not as smooth and creamy if you stir it the whole time.

The confectioner's sugar makes it taste more like frosting than fudge. It's not bad, but I'm going to find an alternate recipe for next year's holiday season.

I had to use marshmallows for the creme, I was out, it worked great, just had to stir a little harder-my arm was sore! I also ran out of gran. sugar so I used 2 cups of gran and 2 cups of powdered. It worked perfect. First time I have ever made fudge, it came out great!!!!

Wonderful fudge!!!  I made several types of fudge this year, and this was my favorite!  It came out a little softer than regular fudge- more creamy.  It reminded me of peanut butter nobake cookies.  This is a recipe I won't just save for Christmas! :)

This fudge was delicious, creamy, and fairly easy to make.  It came out on the first try, which is not something I can say for all fudge recipes.  I will definitely keep this in my folder.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  A lot of reviews give tips on fudge making.  It's just not necessary with this one.  When it comes to a full rolling boil, start timing for seven minutes.  Stir the whole time.  Before you know it, you will have the most delicious, creamy, and wonderful peanut butter fudge ever.  Don't try to be a hero, just keep it simple and follow the directions.  If you want to be a superstar, try making fudge without the marshmallow cream.  That's where we separate the girls from the women.  (I'm still a girl, by the way!)

This fudge had fantastic flavor.  I followed a lot of the reviewers remarks and used a candy thermometer to be sure the boiling sugar reached 234, which took at least 10 minutes at full boil not 7, and it became a dry crumbly mess.  I'm going to try it again for 7 mins as the recipe states and Im sure it will be perfect!  Im new to fudge making so if anyone has a better tip as to why, if using a thermometer, this would still over cook let me know!

When my grandmother kept giving me the wrong amounts to her fantastic fudge I turned to this site. I've been using this recipe for nearly four years now and tell everyone it's my grandma's recipe (shh, don't tell her!) I am now known for my "mean peanut butter fudge" and am expected to make it at any pot luck, gathering, picnic, etc. For those that are having trouble with this recipe: stick to pot and stick to the instructions. don't leave it alone for a second and following the steps exactly. you can't make a more simple fudge recipe. I love this recipe.

My staff sergeant son requested peanut butter fudge to share with his team for Christmas. I had never made it before so I tried this recipe. After reading the reviews, I didn't stir it once it started to boil and I got a big burned mess. So I tried it again stirring all the time and just following the directions exactly and it turned out great. I cooked it to 234 degrees F. checking it with my instant read thermometer. It is creamy and tastes great. I was thinking it should have a stronger peanut butter flavor, but I am having a hard time staying out of it so it must be that it is fine the way it is! The soldiers will enjoy it.

Am a beginning cook, and made this recipe on my first try with Fudge.  It came out GREAT!!!  Couldn't believe the review that did the recipe 7 times and only 2 edible.  Only thing changed was using 30 large marshmallows because I had no marshmallow creme.  Thanks for all the great recipes as I am loving my attempts at cooking.  Have been at it for 2 yrs, am 78 yrs old and having a terrific time.  Love the Baking.

if only I had let it boil a little longer, it would have turned out perfect. It never hardened *at all* and is still in a creamy phase. It tastes awesome though. If not for user-error, it would've been PERFECT.

This was the first time that I've made fudge, and I carefully followed the directions (and the directions/reviews regarding time for boiling and not touching it while it boils).  It turned out a little crumbly (although I'm not sure what it's supposed to look like when you spread it in the dish), but I just pressed it out and it turned out great!

The taste is great, but I can't get the consistency right.  I stired the mixture while it was boiling and then waited until it was 125 degrees before I added the marshmallow creme and PB.  The next batch, I didn't stir while it was boiling and it scortched in the bottom of the pan.  I aslo added the marshmallow and PB right away, and I still came out with the same texture.  Should I add more marshmallow creme?  HELP!

Does taste amazing. I stirred for 40 minutes never came to rolling boil so i quit stirring put my candy thermometer in and it came to a boil in seconds. Cooked to soft ball within a minute or 2 and removed from heat stired the marshm. creme in till completely dissolved, then at about 150* I stirred in the pb and the vanilla, stirred well and put on a small cookie sheet covered in tinfoil and was slightly larger then a cake pan. Taste amazing off the spatula. Sat praying it would set b/c it looked so creamy as my previous recipe looked slightly stiffened right as i was pooring it. after set about 20-30 minutes still not stiff but a little more set. took parchment paper layed on top and smoothed with hands and set a pan the same size on with some weight on it to hel smooth the top out and make it look a little more professional..Of course couldnt wait til it was set to try so i cut a tiny square out of the corner so delicious if this sets it will be perfect and i will use it forever.. about 2 hours later still not set. so i put it in the refrigerator. see if this works. well... never set up but is really good try again next time.

WOW! Amazing Fudge. I just cut the cooled fudge and it is dreamy. I followed the directions to a "T". I stirred for the complete 7 minutes and it was perfect and smooth. Follow the directions as listed and you will get perfect fudge every time.

I love love love this recipe!! I've been making it but never rated it, this is so perfect every time. I time the syrup once it is boiling and I can't stir it down. Throw away the thermometer and follow the recipe, it works! I've never had issues with it at all.   Makes a good 3 pounds. It is great for a large gathering, or for trays for your friends, or gifts. Thanks for sharing, Janet!

I should have read the reviews. I envy those who tossed a pot on the stove, watched a show and came back to the perfect PB fudge.  Even with a candy therm and timers the fudge came out too sweet, dry and gritty or came out too sweet and mushy. My chocolate fudge is always smooth and creamy.

We have made peanut butter fudge in my family for years but this recipe tops the cake!  So easy to make, but i did make one change...after mixing all ingredients on stove top, before pouring into pan, i poured into mixer and did some extra "stirring".  It did the trick and the fudge turned out great!  I actually had people fighting over it!  I will definitely do this again!

Have been making peanut butter fudge for years. Made your recipe just to try something different and was amazed at how creamy and delicious your version is. Have had to make it THREE times since Thanksgiving just to satisfy my guests craving for this wonderful fudge. Thank you for sharing this recipe with the world!

I made this fudge to the recipe and it never set up.  I would have given it a lower rating but did not since it had so many other good ratings.  I tried another recipe and it came out fine.

LOVE this recipe!! Love that it does not use marshmallows.....
I did substitute the extra peanut butter and decrease the confectioner's sugar as posted by the reviews.  My husband and friends all rave about this recipe.

Very smooth, melt in your mouth fudge.  It did set up on me pretty quick after adding the marshmallow cream and I had to hurry to get it into the pan.  I'm not new to making fudge so I watched the time pretty close but I think I left it on the heat just a hair too long.  It was still great.  As my husband put it - not sickening sweet, not too peanut buttery - creamy and just right.

I have just made this; however, I couldn't stand to look at the color, so, I added 2 cups of chocolate chips....Very tasty!...Grandkids & kids will think it is awesome, I am certain...I tasted it and I certainly do.  I used crunchy peanut butter and topped the fudge with chopped pecans...very good!

I followed this recipe to the tee.  I know how fickle fudge can be.  I should not have trusted it, and used the soft ball in cold water method to test it before adding the final ingredients. I figured with such a high rating, and not suggesting to test it, the fudge would have set fine. I just ended up with an expensive mess.  On the bright side, it tasted good.  If it had set it would have been wonderful!

Excellent!  As I was making the fudge, I realized that I only had a 5 oz can of evaporated milk, so I used that, and then filled up the can 1.5 times with milk, and it was so good!  I also used crunchy peanut butter because, again, it's what I had on hand.  I had no problem with a gritty texture or with it not setting up.  The only problem that I'm having is that me & the family can't stop eating it!

This is such an easy recipe to make, and the fudge comes out so creamy and smooth. I  have started to not like anyone's fudge but my own because other fudges seem to always be dry and crumbly. This fudge is amazing. I like to pour half a layer of "Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate Fudge" and half a layer of this fudge to make a peanut butter/chocolate layer. So good!

This fudge tastes AWESOME!!!  Although, when I made it, I must've messed up somehow.  They were WAY too soft.  But, that didn't matter for my family, they still wen't fast.  I'll have to try again and see what I did wrong.  Thanks!

This was incredibly delicious and so easy to make! I only had skim milk on hand and was worried it would affect the quality of the fudge, but it didn't seem to make any difference. I carried some of this to work and my co-workers loved it! I think I'll be adding this to the home made treats I give as Christmas gifts each year!

I give this a 4 because of "operator error." I read all the reviews and was careful to monitor the temperature. The flavor was great, but the whole pot seized because when I stirred, a small piece came out of the pot and landed on my knuckle, scalding it. It burned so badly that I stopped stirring to put cold water on it, and the brief time I took to relieve the burn was time that I wasn't stirring, and the whole amount became very stiff. I put it in the greased 9x13 pan hoping it would be okay, but even after it cooled, it was inedible. I couldn't cut it without it shattering. Maybe I'll try again another time, but I was disappointed that it was so time consuming and picky. Good luck and be careful stirring!

Very good fudge.  Everyone loved it at Christmas time, but it was a little grainy in my opinion.  Could be maybe I didnt cook it long enough, but I'm going to use this recipe again, to see if I can perfect.

Easy to make and tastes great. I get lots of requests for this fudge. I've been making it for three years now and it is a big hit. I did try doubling the recipe once, but it did not turn out well at all.

I too had a problem with the timing of this recipe.  I heated the fudge for twelve minutes and it still came out soft.  The taste was superior though.  I think I'll try it again.

This was first attmept at making fudge, and it came out fantastic. I have had so many compliments, my dad said, "It is the best fudge he ever had". I set the oven timer for exactly 7 minutes, as I was worried about over cooking it. 
Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I LOVE this recipe and it was very easy to make also. I cut the ingredents in half and made a smaller batch since my boyfriend doesn't care for fudge...but i thought it was the best i've ever tasted!
thank you very much

Delicious! I would suggest using a bigger pan to cool fudge in, I thought they were too thick but the recipe cooked well with or without candy thermometer. This is a keeper. Yum!

I made this for giving with gifts at Christmas.. while I was pleasantly suprised with the creamy melting taste, I was disappointed to find it was more 'cookie dough'-like in texture. 
After 3 batches with the same result, I gave up.

No surprise, didn't turn out for me. Every year I try a new recipe for fudge and follow instructions perfectly and every year it turns out doughy. This was no exception. It did have a good flavor to it though. Thought this recipe looked a little too easy. Oh well, will try another one next year.

Awesome recipe!  I made it several times and distributed as gifts.  Also took to  my Bunco group and they loved it.  I didn't use a candy thermometer, but I did follow the directions precisely as written.

I give this 5 stars based on everyone that has ate this fudge has loved it. I personally do not like PB fudge so I have not even tried it. I do know that is has a soft texture, even after it has set up a few hours or even over nights, so this is not a firm fudge.  My daughter ate 4 pcs of this fudge and give all of the sugar in it, I have no idea how she ( a 14 yr old) ate so much without getting sick. My 5 yr old son liked it, my hubby and everyone I gave it to. So, even though I personally can't vouch the taste, everyone else sure has :)

This is without a doubt the best Peanut butter fudge I have ever made. I got the recipe online last week  and have made four batches just trying to keep up with request. My husband took it to his office and they went nuts over it. Just follow directions to the t and it will be your favorite as well. Thanks for sharing it.

I had never made fudge before and this recipe was really easy.  I made it for a work event and can't believe how many people asked me for the recipe - especially since I forgot to add the vanilla! Just as a tip, since I didn't have the exact size of peanut butter or marshmallow creme, I used my food scale to weigh out the 16 oz. PB and 7 oz. of marshmallow creme and it worked great.  I would make this again!

Delicious fudge!  My boyfriend and I are peanut butter freaks (and also love fudge), so I just had to make this.  I followed the recipe exactly except let it cool down for about 5 minutes before stirring in the marshmallow creme, PB and vanilla.  Next time I, too, will use a candy thermometer because like some others said, the batch I made turned out rather grainy.  I boiled it for exactly 7 minutes (go stop watch!), but I guess it was a bit too much.  Regardless, the taste is wonderful, so nice and sweet with a good peanut butter taste and no problem setting up. My boyfriend is thrilled to death to have an entire 9x13 pan of it!  Also, I happened to have a little square of peanut butter fudge I bought at a store and I couldn't even taste the peanut butter in that one compared to this.

I tried this for the first time for a bake sale and it was a good experiment. I did it without a candy thermometer and it was almost perfectly creamy. I lined the pan with foil so I could cut uniform rectangles. I drizzled the results with white chocolate and every one sold. Thanks to the cook who posted it!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I have made it several times now, and it is always a hit!  I have never made fudge before, and I didn't realize it was going to take so long for it to boil, but it is well worth the effort!

Easy to make and rich and creamy. I added about a teaspoon of salt per other reviewers to cut down on sweetness. Thanks for great recipe!

this was so good. The sugar does need to be cut down, I added a bit more milk to make it more creamier and it was perfect.

This recipe is okay.   It is really too sweet overall.   Some of the other recipes call for less sugar and I'll bet they're a lot better than this one.

If I could add more stars I would. THis was my first time attempting fudge and it came out WONDERFUL. I didn't even have to use a thermometer, just boiled for 7 minutes as instructed. I had to make 5 batches for my whole family at Christmas... everyone took some home. Thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe with all of us.

Everyone loved this fudge on Christmas.  My 6 year old son is begging for more and my niece asked to take some home.  It was pretty easy to do even with the help of my 3 year old.  I used a thermometer and cookied it unitl 234 degrees, then allowed it to cool to 125 before stirring in the peanut butter and vanilla.  It's very soft, but does set well in the refrigerator or even the freezer.

Perfect recipe!  I didn't use a candy thermometer. I took another's suggestion and made sure it was at a full boil (not air bubbles) for the seven minutes.  Delicious!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  Not to sweet and a very rich peanut butter taste.  Make sure you have everything measured and ready to go because once you start it goes really quick.

The taste was awesome! I brought it to a church function and every bit was gone within an hour. The only problem that I had was the consistency was "mushy". I had to chill it in the fridge overnight before I could cut it. Even then it was really soft. Next time I will use a candy thermometer to assure consistency but the taste was TOTALLY DELICIOUS!

This was a great recipe.  Very good Peanut Butter taste.  Makes a lot which is good for Christmas Baskets.  Initially it was soft, but after I put it in the refrigerator it was perfect.  Takes about 10 minutes to make before cooling for awhile.

Mmm.  I was afraid this wasn't going to turn out, it was my first time making fudge.  I threw a cup of chopped walnuts in the fudge and we are in heaven.  It is perfect, not too sweet, not too rich, just perfect.  Very creamy, great for peanut butter lovers!!!

I am sorry to say that I did not care for this recipe much. One of the girls here brings in peanutbutter fudge that is made by her sister in law. I was hoping this one would be like it, but it was not as creamy and much sweeter.

I printed this recipe off 3 years ago and have been putting it on my Christmas candy trays every year since then.  This pb fudge is creamy, not sickeningly sweet, and is as good or better as any fudge-shop peanut butter fudge I've ever bought. It sets up nicely at room temperature and gets just firm enough to cut into very small squares, while remaining creamy.  Excellent recipe, Janet, thank you for sharing it!

I followed the directions to the letter but the fudge did not set too well and it was too sweet.

This was the first time I ever attempted to make fudge. I've always heard it was very touchy - so I was afraid to try. But the recipe was super easy and tasted even better!! Thanks so much for making my first attempt so successful!!

This recipe was easy to make from basic ingredients I already had on hand, and got rave reviews from the peanut butter lovers in the family.  It did come out smooth, but was just a bit soft for my taste.  The consistency is like cookie dough.  Tasty!

This is the easiest and tastiest peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever made. I live at 10,000' in elevation and just increased the cooking time by 1 minute.  It came out perfect. Everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.

This was not what I was hoping for at all. I followed the directions completely and the fudge didn't set up after several hours. The top layer set up but as soon as I tried to lift it, the bottom half stuck to the foil. I would definetely skip this one.

I love this recipe, but I only use 3 cups of white sugar. We like our fudge more "peanutbuttery" and less sugary. I agree with the other folks, all you have to do is let it come to a full boil, turn on your timer for 7 minutes, and stir constantly. You do not need to make the balls, use a candy thermometer, etc. I've been making this for years and it's always sat up nicely.

Also, those who say let it cool before adding PB - may I ask why? I've never done that and it's always been fine. The key is to boil rapidly at 7 minutes. Don't worry about what your candy thermometer reads - 7 minutes will do the trick.

I thought I had a good peanut butter fudge recipe till I made this one!!! It's foolproof and makes a nice amount.  Smooth and definitely creamy.  It's the only peanut butter fudge recipe I'll ever use again.

The fudge turned out wonderful.  It was smooth, creamy and perfect consistancy.  It also cut easily.  Rather than using a greased dish, I lined the dish with waxed paper.  When the fudge was cooled I simply lifted it from the pan and cut into squares.  It gave my squares a professional look.  I will definitely make this in the future.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

My grandmother made peanut butter fudge for years, always around the holidays. Her PB fudge was the one thing that she did cook. When she died 10 years ago, I was the only family member to get her recipe.  I made it for a few holiday after she died, but everyone commented that it just wasn't the same.  UNTIL -I made this PB fudge recipe.  EVERYONE went wild over it - told me that Mom-Mom would be proud.  I just smiled; I didn't have the heart to tell anyone that it wasn't her recipe.  DEFINITELY - set your kitchen timer for the 7 minutes of boiling/stirring.  I poured the fudge out onto a wax paper lined jelly roll pan (which I won't do again) The fudge stuck to the wax paper, but still tasted GREAT.  VERY CREAMY, not super sugary like some fudge can be.

SUPER NICE recipe for something special without a lot of fuss!  Everyone was impressed with the taste and the creamy consistency.  Kids especially love this fudge.  This is great to box up and give away.  You'll have them asking for more, more, more!

Take the time to make this recipe and you will see that the evaporated milk and marshmallow creme make the difference.  Also, because granular sugars are used instead of confectioners sugar, the end consistency is nice.  Wonderful peanut butter flavor.

This is the easiest and best peanut butter fudge I've ever made.  This is the 2nd year in a row I've made this and I have given it away on cookie trays.  Why pay almost 8.00 a lb for this when you can make it at home for a fraction of the price.  A++++.  Thanks!!!

This stuff is so good that it's dangerous...while cutting this up, I kept sneaking pieces.  It turns out very creamy, almost melts in your mouth.  I get many compliments every time I make this.

THE BEST PB FUDGE!!!  Super easy and really good!  Make sure you take into account the boiling action when you choose a saucepan.  I didnt get a big enough one and had to transfer the contents to a larger one and had to start my boiling time over, but even them it turned out super creamy!

Don't know what is happening to the other folks, my son who's 11 made this all on his own and it turned out great!  It set up very nicely, very creamy and smooth.  The taste is sweet and peanut buttery... What else are you looking for in a peanut butter fudge?!?  Good recipe, will make lots.

I was craving Peanut Butter Fudge and the kids were out to a movie - I was not going to the store - I taxied around the offers of Peanut Butter Fudge, settled for this one as I had all the ingredients - so, what a blessing.....everything just moved right along and my craving treated to the very best - I too love cooking and seldom even use a recipe - this one is now embedded in my gray matter.  Thanks & Happy Day.  God Bless America.  Pat McNabb

Very good recipe!  Very creamy in texture.  I had hoped, however, that the result would be worth the effort.  I have a no-bake fudge recipe that tastes EXACTLY the same and is just as creamy.  Very fine candy though, I am just too busy with my 4, 3 and 1 year old boys to stand at the stove so long when I have a quality replacement!  Thank you for sharing though!!!

This is a great recipe! Very Creamy and well worth making.  I have tried different peanut butter fudge recipes and this one tops them all.

This fudge has a delightful flavor.  Although it was a bit soft if not refrigerated.  Everyone who tried it, loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.
