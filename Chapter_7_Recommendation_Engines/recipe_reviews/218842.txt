Have been making similar recipes to this one for years and they have been lacking in flavor. Using the Johnsonville sausage filled that gap. Added mushrooms, as is our flavor, and this is a WIN! recipe!

This was a tasty quick meal. I chose to make my own pizza sauce using a recipe on this site. What I love about this is that you can change it up by adding whatever you would love on your pizza. I happened to follow the recipe as is this time but oh the possibilities!

I knew this was a hit at our house when three bowls later my 7 year old announced he was full. Super easy to toss together, add different ingredients to change it up.  We will be having this one more often.

Loved it! So easy and it does taste like pizza...I used Johnsonville hot sausage, just took the casing off and crumbled it in big pieces! Definitely would make this again....so quick, served with a green salad and garlic bread....done in 30 minutes!  I did use green olives because its what I had on hand....make it like you like your pizza...I was wishing I had mushrooms! Thank you Johnsonville for this recipe!

We really loved this! The only change I made was adding a can of mushrooms to it. Next time, I might add pepperoni and onion as well...we like our "pizza" pretty loaded. This is sure to become a new weeknight favorite in your household!

We both enjoyed this one.  The pizza sauce I used was a little thick, so I did add water to it because I knew the pasta would absorb it.  I also like to simmer the sauce with the sausage added for about an hour so the flavor of the sausage infuses the sauce.  Another tip....do use freshly grated mozzarella.  I used the pre-shredded, and it didn't melt as well as I would've liked.  A really good and easy recipe.  Thanks again, Johnsonville!

After an abnormally long commute home, I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table before everyone else came home hungry.  This is a very quick and easy weeknight meal, which is plenty in my house!  I cheated just a little, though, to save on dish cleanup.  I cooked my sausage, drained it, and then added the green peppers and some eggplant (I needed to use it up!) in the same skillet.  Then I added the sauce directly to the skillet, followed by the cooked pasta.  Finally, I used fresh mozzarella (again, needed to use it) and left out the olives.  I saved a dirty casserole dish and just made it all on the stovetop!  I also used whole-wheat rotini and thought it came out nicely.  It's a great recipe to play with depending on what your family likes on their pizza...or, in our case, depending on what produce needs to be eaten before it goes bad on the countertop!

This was super yummy. The mild Italian sausage really added a great flavor to this dish.  I didn't have a green pepper on hand but I added some diced onion. Tasted fantastic!

My household approved of it!! Yum! I added onions to it. Next time I will probably add in some pepperoni and perhaps a bit more pizza sauce. The flavors came together so well. We served it with garlic bread and it was so quiet during dinner - they were too busy eating! :)

Tonight we had the BEST comfort food!  The biggest change I made to the recipe was to use Trader Joe's Traditional Marinara Sauce.  Then because I was so stoked to find three (yes, three!) Johnsonville products that do NOT contain MSG that I added a little of each of the three---All Natural Ground Mild Italian Sausage, All Natural Ground Hot Italian Sausage, and 3 Cheese Italian Chicken Sausage!  I cooked all three sausages and drained them in paper towels before adding them to a wonderful little baking dish that I have been gifted.  I combined all the ingredients and baked them for about half an hour at 350.  Yum!  This is a keeper for us!  Thanks, Johnsonville!

We are pizza lovers. This was simple and tasted great! My son didn't like the black olives, but they were east to pick out because they were on top. We will definitely make again and experiment with different toppings.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I added a chopped red bell pepper and managed to sneak in some chopped spinach as well.  The sausage added great flavor to the dish.  We will make this again.
