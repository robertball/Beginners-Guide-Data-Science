Wow, I am so surprised with how good this is!! Toasting the crushed peppercorns is brilliant! This opens up the pepper and releases the oil from the peppercorn into the olive oil, infusing it with so much more flavor. I thought it might be overpowering, but you get such a different, deep, delicious flavour from the pepper.  So using freshly crushed peppercorns is a must! I love Pecorino Romano so I used a whole 1/2 cup in this. I also would use freshly grated cheese, you just can't get the same flavour from the pre-ground powdery cheese in the containers.  Using Linguine is also a perfect pasta pairing, you get a good bite and chew from the thicker noodles, and it soaks up the sauce better. I love this and will definitely make it again! I paired this with roasted chicken and a tomato salad, perfection!

I decided to revisit this one, as i butchered it last weekend. i wasn't in my own kitchen, i forgot to save some of the pasta water and had no fresh cracked black pepper and both of these elements are IMPERATIVE to this recipe. So glad i gave it another chance. It was delicious, served along side a green salad and turkey cutlet! Yum. I halved the recipe for the two of us. I really enjoyed the fresh cracked black pepper in this dish. Lends a nice little bite as a contrast to the creaminess of the pasta without being over powering! Deeeelicious. Will definitely make it again :)

This was excellent. The pepper seemed like a lot but I wanted to try the recipe as is.  We found the pepper isn't overpowering - you would never guess there was that much in it.   I usually buy the cheapest pasta on the shelves at the grocery store but in using Barilla Spaghetti (I had no linguine) I found there is a noticeable difference in the quality, though I must confess to cooking it 1minute longer than the box recommends.  There was quite a puddle of butter/olive on my dish when I finished eating so I may cut that back a bit but all in all I will make this again.

Sometimes less is really more! This was fabulous with just a few ingredients. You can taste the quality of the Barilla Pasta! Will make again and again as a side or add some protein for an easy tasty dinner.

Nice change to red or white sauce. Not saucey at all in fact. We found it a little too oily for our pasta pleasure but I understand the need for the amount called for. If you don't like pepper, don't try this. Don't be afraid it will be too spicy either. It's flavourful but not really spicy. Cheese gives a nice bite. I like the idea of adding pasta water. It kept the pasta loose after the cheese was added. Will try this again.

This is a simple and savoury recipe.  I'll definitely make it again. 

  I suggest using fresh pepper as stated in the recipe, rather than regular ground pepper.  The ground pepper flavour doesn't come through in the recipe.  

Note: I used spaghetti since I didn't have linguine. I don't think this affected the recipe at all.

I didn't have freshly ground pepper, so I used the regular fine ground stuff. I bet it would have been even better with the proper pepper, and I'll make sure I get some for the next time I make this. It was a great pairing to the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe from AR. (Would make a lovely entree with fresh bread & salad).
I did salt the water, and I used spaghetti instead of linguini (I realized while my water was boiling that I was out of linguini noodles!).
Made as is, it was good, but next time I will make sure I use fine ground pepper, and I think some minced garlic & crushed red pepper flakes would make a fabulous addition.
Thanks Barilla for a lovely recipe!

This recipes was absolutely delicious!  Next time I might add in a splash of heavy cream, but it's great as-written.  Amazing use of things I already had on-hand, so I will definitely be putting this recipe into my regular rotation!

The amount of pepper called for in this recipe seemed like too much,the original recipe from barilla calls for 1 TBSP of pepper, very easy and delicious
