The Kraft Kitchens have come up with another tasty recipe! I COARSELY ground cheddar cheese (rather than Mozzarelli),bacon and 3T of chives in my food processor.I did this because the one inch pieces of bacon suggested by Kraft wouldn't stick to the dough. Pieces just kept falling off.Then I made little balls of dough (1-2 in) and put them together with the bacon mixture into a plastic freezer bag.Shook them carefully to coat. Then placed them in a tube pan, sprinkled the remainder of bacon mixture over them and baked at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.Yummy! PS I don't like the frozen bread dough, so I used Steve Morrison's ONION, GARLIC, CHEESE BREAD recipe from this site. Yummy!

I liked the flavor of these bread bites, but my husband disagreed.  They're not pretty to look at, so keep that in mind if cooking for company!

I use olive oil when I make this and put a thin coat of olive oil on the dough before cutting it into pieces. I think it helps make the other ingredients stick to the pieces better.

I made this again for company last night. They loved it! Even though they said it looked strange. I agree it is hard to get the bacon to stick to dough -- so I made smaller pieces of bacon and persistant on kneeding the pieces into loaf! I also chopped the mozzarella into smaller pieces.

I liked this a lot.  Very strange looking but the taste was pretty good.  Really easy to make too.
