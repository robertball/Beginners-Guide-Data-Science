I'm giving this 5 stars because of the 4.5-star taste and the 5-star simplicity! I did add a can of beef broth and a bit of garlic.  Unbelievably good for the effort involved!  I don't understand the other reviewers who change a recipe completely and then give negative reviews.  Frozen vegetables will NOT be as good as canned (the soup will be watery and bland) so please try the recipe as written first!  :-)

People.. this recipe works!  I didn't add the canned veggies @ first, did add the liquid though.  The veggies themselves didn't get added until 2 hours into cooking.

My husband loves this soup!  I did add a can of beef broth and just a little water, other than that, the perfect vegetable soup.  I was worried about the can vegetables, but you couldn't tell at all.

I'm trying to use my crock pot for things other than chicken, so I came across this recipe.  I made a few changes though based on what I had on hand- I tossed in some baby carrots instead of from the can, and also sliced up some potatoes instead of from the can too.  My husband and 3 year old thought this was great!  And it heated up well for my lunch the bext day too!  This is an extremely easy recipe- I love being able to just "toss" it into the slow cooker and not have to precook anything!  This is my kind of recipe- thanks for posting it!

Couldn't be any easier, dump it all in the crock-pot and go.  No chopping, measuring, etc.  I like that part!  But as far as taste, its overwhelmingly, and I mean overwhelmingly, tomatoes...and therefor VERY acidic even after cooking all night!  I was skeptical about using canned veggies b/c I always use fresh or frozen, but they were just fine.  The recipe has so much potential, I think if I tweek it a little bit, with less tomatoes, maybe a little wine, and some more beef, it would easily be 5 star.  I like the idea from another reviewer to add a little bit of cooked pasta shells at the end. Will try again.  
PS-Get your bread maker going timed to finish at the same time and everyone will think you are superwoman...homeade soup and fresh hot bread!!!

1st time making this recipe, and I took Islandgirl's suggestion for extra veggies, bouillon, and onion soup mix.  But to kick it up the proverbial notch, I added Chipotle Tabasco.  Awesome!

In a 16 oz cup I put two bouillon cubes, 1 1/2 packets of onion soup mix, about 3 tablespoons of Chipotle Tobasco (20 shakes of the bottle) and filled the rest of the glass with water.  Dump that mixture in and it gives it a very nice flavor; mildly spiced and a little smokey.

I used frozen vegetables and it was fabulous! I didn't have the canned veggies on hand, just the frozen mix. I was worried because of the reviews saying not to use frozen. I took into account the reviews saying there was too much of a tomato taste. Here's what I did, (and keep in mind it's mainly because I just used what I had on hand) 1 bag frozen mixed vegetables, I cut up 7 small red potatoes in very little pieces because they needed to be used, I also cut up one roma tomato for the same reason, 2 cans of beef broth to keep from getting the watered down taste from the frozen veggies, and 1 can of tomato soup. Everything else I did as directed. I added 1 can of broth first and then waited to see if I needed anymore liquid. About 4 hrs. in I added the second can and the soup to make it more soupy. Hope this helps someone that only has frozen vegetables on hand!

If you don't like a lot of tomato flavor, you might want to try a smaller can of crushed tomatos.  Otherwise, excellent!

We've cooked this several times, and love it! I use canned lima beans instead of green beans and use two cans of sliced or whole potatoes instead of one.

One of my favorite recipes.  So easy and simple to do.  Throw everything in the crock pot and forget about it.  I always make this when our schedules are hectic or if I am making a meal for a friend or family member.  I always receive rave reviews.  And most importantly, my boys always ask for seconds and thirds.

This is a nice recipe.  Comforting and different for a nice change.  Changes I made:  Used frozen corn, fresh baby carrots, 1 large diced potato and about 3/4 can crushed tomatoes.  Could not find the soup mix, so I used a can of beef broth.  Also put in a good sprinkle of onion powder and some garlic powder.  

My husband is not a fan of veggies at all, so that's why I didn't go with all the canned stuff with the juice in it.  Just wanted to simply as much the first time, but he really enjoyed it, so I won't change a thing and keep my alterations.

I thought I would need to add water, but the soup thinned out as it cooked.  I start my crockpot recipes the day before and turn it on to a 'Keep Warm' setting, so it cooks for abour 18 hours without burning.  Makes everything really tender.

The recipe is great and is especially helpful for busy people. You can always rinse your canned veggies to remove some of the sodium content or buy the no salt versions.

This is EXCELLENT recipe for BUSY FAMILIES!!  The first time I made it, it came out on the thicker side (maybe too much meat?), so I added a little corn starch/water mixture to thicken it even more; now it's VEGETABLE STOUP.  The only thing I did differently was to add Oregano and a little Creole seasoning in place of salt.  Served with Beer Bread (another to-die for recipe) & salad for a great meal!!  ONE RECOMMENDATION: For a more tender, fall-off-the-bone meat, I recommend cooking it for at least 7-8 hours on low.  After 6 hours, my meat was tender (and tasty), but after 7 hours, you could cut the meat with a fork.

I made this soup yesterday and I think the final result was amazing. I don't have a slow cooker so I just simmered it in a covered pot for nine hours.I used canned everything, just like it called for, except the carrots and the potatoes, which I used fresh. I found a vegetable soup spice mix in the gravy section of the supermarket as I couldn't find the one recommended in the original recipe, and used a carton of beef broth instead of a can. Sirloin steak was on sale (cheaper than stewmeat) so I used that instead. The only other alteration was one cup of white cooking sherry. The result was fabulous!! Either I'm really drunk or this is the best soup I've ever made!! Well done!!

Although I don't use the canned vegetables as this recipe calls for we still feel the recipe is awesome.  I am raising my 2 year old grandson that is allergic to most things that are not fresh or raw so that is why I altered the recipe for our situation. I think it's a great recipe or a great start for altering if you have allergies....but good all around.

This may be the best soup I have ever made. Excellent!  I made a few changes.  I used fresh carrots and potatoes cut very small. I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil and I added (2) cans of beef broth since I didn't have any liquid from canned pot. and carrots. For the meat I used left over roast beef from the previous nights dinner. Did not need extra salt/pepper due to the onion soup mix. This is a keeper!

This was perfect for a chilly winter evening.  I worried about using canned potatoes, but they were just fine and saved the hassle of peeling and dicing.  I browned lean ground beef the night before.  I added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker pot and refrigerated till morning.  All I had to do was pop the pot in the slow cooker, turn it on low, and come home to a warm, comforting meal with my family.  I drained the vegetables out of habit, so it needed more liquid.  I added a can of beef broth and two 11.5 ounce cans of V8 juice.  This soup is delicious served with piping hot Fabulous Homemade Bread.  Even my 8 year-old daughter, who announced that she was not going to eat vegetable soup, gave it two thumbs up!  I'll make this again and again.

Some of these reviews crack me up. If you don't like the ingredients, find another recipe! There are plenty of them on this site. Don't rate a recipe you haven't tried, people! ...Anyway, my family devoured this. We are not big fans of carrots, so instead of a can of carrots, I added a can of peas and carrots because the carrots were diced smaller. Plus, this gave me the opportunity to sneak peas in. That was the only change I made. Everyone loved it. Perfect easy, throw-together meal for a busy weeknight. Does NOT taste like canned soup, despite the canned ingredients....And veggies from a can are still veggies, and way better for you than the fast food alternative for a lot of busy families.

This is a very easy recipe! I made it at camp in the croc pot and was happy with the results. I followed the recipe and found it to be too tomato-ey. When we warmed up the leftovers, I added beef broth and it really cut the tomato flavor. Much better! I'll make it again but cut the tomato in 1/2 and add broth.

I read reviews from others and used two bouillon cubes along with 2 packs of regular onion soup mix and it came out fine.  I also used fresh baby carrots, mushrooms, onions and celery along with 2 canned veggies.  I just had to add a little water when I came home, it was thick like a stew.  If you prefer it to be a stew then leave as is..otherwise you might have to add a bit of water once it's done cooking and mix well.  Other than that, it was great to come home to. My toddler loved it...he wanted seconds!  I'll definitely do this one again, with other veggies to experiment with. Thanks for the idea!

I keep a supply of canned foods, mostly low or no added sodium, on hand as an emergency food supply.  They do need to be rotated, so occasionally, I need to make dishes using canned veggies.  This is a pretty good way to use some of them.  Since I am a vegetarian, of course, I didn't add the beef, but instead used a very rich, brown veggie stock.  My lower rating is for a lack of flavour.  Adding a few herbs and spices would really perk this up a lot. Still it's a good basic recipe for tweakers.

I mostly cook from fresh ingredients, even for soup, so I didn't think I would like this. But, I was looking for a quick, easy meal that I could make from stored food, so I tried it. It is delicious! I thought the vegetables would be mushy but they were fine. I didn't have canned potatoes so I cut up fresh and it was fine. The flavor was great, and the meat tender. I put all the ingredients into the slow cooker and cooked it on high for 6 hours, but turned it off after 5 hours because I came home from work and wanted to eat! I served it with nice crusty rolls and both hubby and I enjoyed it very much! It is a keeper.

This soup was the best soup I have ever had in my life!!!! I used 2 cans of beef broth, 2 cans of water and 3 tsp better the boullian (located by the bouillans), 1/2 an onion (chopped), 1/2 can diced tomatoes w/ garlic, fresh carrots, fresh cubed potatoes, 1/2 can drained corn, fresh green beans, 3/4 cup frozen peas, oregeno, 1 bay leaf, 1 1/2 pounds stew meat, and the beef onion soup mix. It took about 10 hours on low for the potatoes to be done.  Sooooo tasty!!!!

This recipe was fabulous and easy!  My kids loved it and ate every bite.  I substitued the veg-all instead of buying all of the different cans of vegetables and used onion soup mix since they didn't have beef onion at the store I was at.  Added a can of beef broth since I didn't have the beef onion mix and also added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and some celery that needed to be used up.  The house smelled great and since I work late, when my husband came home from work, he was able to put a hot meal on the table for the kids before running off to soccer practice with my 3 & 4 year olds.  For all of those who reviewed this recipe without trying or complained of the canned vegetables, they must not have a busy life like the rest of us.  Stop being haters.....

WOW- the dish was a major hit with both the grown-ups AND the kids!! The only substitution I had to make was an exchange of the beef onion soup mix, for a packet of Lawry's Beef Stew spice mix. VERY yummy!

Whenever I rate a recipe I make sure that I make the recipe as called for. 

On that note, I thought the soup was very good especially with using canned vegetables.  It taste like homemade to me and is super easy.  

So for a super easy recipe and great taste, I will be making it again. 

Thanks for the recipe.

Have made this twice

Attempt #1 - as written, but used frozen veggies.  Found it way too "tomatoey", but showing promise.

Attempt #2 - much more to my liking!  Doubled the recipe as follows:
2 Lbs stew meat (precut) - browned in hot skillet with olive oil
2 Cups each of frozen corn, peas, green beans
2 Cups cubed fresh carrots
1 Russet potato, cubed (one potato is enough for our liking)
1 28oz can crushed tomatoes (I would NOT add more than this...but that's me)
2 14oz cans beef broth + 1 can of water
3 Tbsp of homemade stew seasoning (if you don't have this, could simply add some onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and maybe some crushed red pepper flakes)
2 bay leaves

The beef broth and water add some nice liquid (especially important for leftovers).  And I only cooked it for 5 hours and it was great.

This is a wonderful base for whatever it is you like to have in your soup. I don't do canned carrots or potatoes, so I used fresh and added some water to make up the difference for the missing liquid. I also had some leftover veggies and beef stock in the freezer that I added. The husband loved it. There's enough for another two meals for the two of us (which I will freeze). Served with biscuits, but it would be good also with cornbread. Thanks for sharing your recipe...will definitely make it again!

Yummy and satisfying!  I should note that we like our food very seasoned so I added one can of beef broth and two bouillon cubes.  Also used only half the tomatoes per other reviewed suggestions.  Midway through cooking we added a cup of barley- yum!

Really yummy! I did take suggestions and added a second packet of beef/onion soup mix. Didn't add water b/c I liked the "stewwy" consistency. Tastes even better on day two! Will make again--couldn't be easier!

Very good, but like most i made some substitutions.  Used frozen veggies since I don't like canned and also added cubed red potatoes. Added about 6-8 cups of water and 2 beef boullion cubes as well as 1/4 cup dry red wine (cab sav was open so I went with it). Also added 1/2 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I was nervous since I read a lot of the good and bad reviews but overall good and will probably make again.

I think this is a really good recipe. I used more fresh veggies and added some water and just a couple of beef bouillon cubes but otherwise just the same. Very easy and good.

All most too easy to be so good!  I used 2 undrained 29-ounce cans of veg-all diced vegetables instead of the various cans called for and the small can of rotel original tomatoes PLUS an additional can of broth.  
Excellent ... and I don't even usually like vegetable soup!

Fantastic recipe.  I used fresh carrots, potatoes, frozen green beans and corn.  I didn't have stew meat so I used cube steak which I broke up in pieces.  I added extra seasoning as we like a little spicy, crushed red pepper and cajun seasoning.  Simmered it all day - even my very fussy granddaughter said it was deliciious.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is what my family has called beef stew for close to 60 years. The only difference is I add celery, peas and a jar of med Tostitos chunky salsa for a little kick. Add  warm crusty bread and butter and you have a meal made in heaven.

This recipe is great if you are in a hurry, but I prefer to use fresh vegetables in my soup. It still tastes wonderful, and I'll use it when I have to "dump and run" in my crock pot!

Very good recipe!  I substituted a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and added beef broth for extra liquid.  Also threw in some barley - made a salad and cornbread and enjoyed a delicious meal with not a lot of fuss and bother!

Good!  I used kabob meat I had on hand; frozen veggies:green beans, yellow (green) beans & carrots.  One small (14 oz.) Hunt's Diced tomatoes.  For the 'sauce' I used 3 beef granules dissolved in 3 cups hot water.  Also, used a packet of McCormick Hunter Sauce Blend with a butter base.  Salt & peppered the beef, drenched in flour then browned in skillet in olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 a sweet onion.  All this went into the crock pot to slow cook for 4 - 6 hours.  Oh yes, also added 1/2 cup Shiraz wine.  Delicious!  Does anyone know a homemade version of Hunter Sauce? The back of the package includes tomato, onion, salt, mushrooms, parsley, pepper, tarragon, shallots, & garlic.

This was a big hit with my family.  The only changes I made to this was used real potatoes, real carrots, a can of diced tomatoes & a can of crushed tomatoes and added a can of chickpea.  I served it with Honey Corn Bread and my family loved it.  I definitely say this recipe is a keeper.  :-)

So easy & so delicious!  I put this in the slow cooker this morning as written (except I didn't have stew meat, so I cut up a chuck roast instead) and the end result was a wonderful, flavorful soup that was perfect on a cold & rainy day like today.  My family loved it & asked for it again!

I have been searching for a good vegetable soup and finally found it! I held back about a 1/4 of the crushed tomatoes but followed the recipe as is.  This is a perfect workday recipe.  Thank you to the chef!

This was sooo easy and with my SLIGHT changes, it was wonderful!  I cubed up 3 large potatoes instead of adding a can of potatoes (just because that is what I had).  I put in only a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz can.  I added a can of mixed veggies along with the carrots, green beans and corn.  I did not add much of the juices from the cans...instead I put in a carton of beef broth with the stew meat.  I mixed the packet of onion soup mix with 1 beef boillion cube and 3/4 cup of water before I added that.  Put it all in the crock pot on low before I left for work and 9 hours later we had delicious beef vegetable soup on a yucky chilly rainy day!  Tastes just like my mom's!  I have always been afraid to try to make it myself just because hers is sooo good!!  I'm so glad I did!!!  Definitely worth a try if you like vegetable soup...YUM!!!

This soup was so easy and delicious! I cooked the meat in the slow cooker for 2-3 hours on low before adding the veggies, then cooked on low for another 3-4 hours. The only thing I am doing differently next time is adding cabbage.

We have made this many times now. Extremely simple and delicious. This is a great go to recipe when you need to take food to someone who has had surgery, just had a baby etc. Everybody raves about it and wants the recipe. Almost embarrassing to give them such a simple recipe.

Loved this soup, though I must admit, I did modify it quite a bit. I used 1.5 lbs. stew meat, 1 bag each frozen sweet corn and frozen green beans, 1/2 small bag of carrots sliced, 1 bag golden honey potatoes, a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and 2 packages garlic and herb soup mix. To offset the lack of juice from the canned veggies, I added a 32oz box of beef broth. It was AMAZING! I am on a low sodium diet and so using fresh/frozen veggies is generally a must for me. I know I'm not rating the recipe "as is" but I feel that I kept the basic structure of the recipe and just subbed for fresh ingredients. Even my picky-eater husband loved it. This recipe was easy and tasty. I'm excited to see how the leftovers taste!

Sorry, I could only give this one star.   Too many carrots, to much corn and way to salty with the soup mix.   Just didn't have the taste of good old fashion vegetable soup.  Tomato's over powered the taste.

The best vegetable beef soup ever! I changed it up a bit by adding 1 can of beef broth, half of the juice from the green beans, half the juice from the Potatos, no juice from the corn and all of the juice from the carrots. I just opened the cans in that order, but the point was not to add to much juice to take away the flavor since I was using a can of beef broth. While eating this my 9yr old daughter said," I know you asked me a question, but I didn't want to stop eating to answer you!" this one is a KEEPER!

great soup, however I doubled it and it was to thick and tomato tasting, so I made it again and used beef broth instead of 1 can of tomatoes and it was great. I also substituted Lima beans for 1 can of green beans. Now it is perfect!If you don't like the thickness or strong tomato taste then try this.

WOW!  My husband is not a big veggie soup person and he loved this.  The only thing different i did was I drained all my canned veggies, and I added beef broth.  Seem to need a lot of beef broth as this recipe calls for no liquid other than the juice from the cans.  Would also add some other spices.  Delish!

This has to be my favorite crock pot recipe ever.  Just pour everything in, cook on low all day, give it a little stir, and serve with corn muffins.  It's very thick and filling and lasts us all week.  It's a great way to get a husband to eat vegetable (they're surrounding the meat so he has to eat them to get to the meat!)  :-)

This is so easy to make. The only changes I made were: I used fresh potatoes, carrots and celery. I added a can of low sodium beef broth. Very good soup. We made fresh bread to go with. This is going into the favorite's. Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make. Everything went in to the pot on low for 7 hours. I used fresh carrots, celery, frozen peas and canned corn. I added 1/4 cup of barley at the last hour. Turned out perfect!

I was a bit doubtful about this but I shouldn't have been. This was fantastic I did change it a little bit to suit our tastes I used a can of ratatouille instead of tomatoes as we're not great canned tomato lovers and used peas instead of sweetcorn as my husband doesn't like sweetcorn. This is definitely more of a stew but very filling and great comfort food as well. Will be making often. Thanks

This was pretty good. I was a little skeptical. With all the canned ingredients, I was afraid that it would taste sort of like canned soup, but it turned out to be pretty good. I made one change. The last 30 minutes or so of cooking, I turned up the heat to high, added about 3 cups of beef stock, and the added about 1 1/2 cups of small pasta. It was really good and very filling. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

You can follow the original recipe and get a soup that is O.K. and easy. I would 1/2 the amount of tomatoes as they tend to take over the taste. This is how I make my crock pot soup but I have to add chopped onion, celery and minced garlic along with a heaping tbsp of beef base, in place of the onion soup mix. If you have the time use fresh cut vegetables for supreme flavor and nutrition; Also 1/4C red wine which gives it some zing. I would also throw in 2C of large shell macaroni a half hour before serving.

Loved this soup - it is so simple!  I will plan to cook it longer next time (8hrs on low) because the meat wasn't as tender as expected, even after cutting it very small.  I also added a can of beef broth to cut the tomato taste down a bit and half cup of barley.  Delicious!

I've never posted a comment about a recipe before but I had to on this one - it was wonderful!! I mean.... how much simpler can you get?!?! I did make a couple of changes after reading a few reviews; I drained one can of the veggies and substitued it with a can of beef broth. I suppose you could just add the broth with everything else but I didn't want it to get too watery. Then I used both envelopes of the beef with onion soup mix so there was added beef flavor. Last I added some garlic. Nothing major just a few tweaks. Oh, and for all those who are afraid of canned potatoes - we were too but they were perfect and plan on using them in more recipes.

I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it. I have used the beef with onion soup mix in something else before and thought it was too salty. Added a soupson' of water to the crockpot and it came out deliciously. YUM MIE

This is a great recipe.  I used all the canned veggies and I added a can beef broth for more liquid which it needs or you can add water.  We just like more liquid.  The third time I made it I diced up fresh potatoes because I did not have a can and it was great.  This is a family favorite

YUM! This was GREAT!!! It has been dreary and chilly here in the Windy City - PERFECT weather for a steaming hot bowl of soup. :) As you can imagine, this REALLY hit the spot! Admittedly, I had to make several changes to get this *just* right. I'm not sure this would have been AS good without my modifications (but still delicious nonetheless). Concerned that my soup would be too thick and tomatoe-y, I added approximately half a can of (reduced-sodium) beef broth. To add a little zip (this seemed a tad bland as written), I subbed crushed tomatoes with basil and added a 1/2 t dried oregano / 1 t Italian seasoning. I also added a small (chopped) onion / celery rib and 2 cloves of minced garlic (which I sautéed with my ground beef - my final change). I let everything "get acquainted" all afternoon. When my hubs and I returned from the movies, all I had to do was pop a loaf of French bread in the oven and voila! NOTE: I was skeptical about using canned veggies (ick!), but after sampling just one bite of this satisfying soup, you'll never think of them the same way again lol. :-) Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe with the AR community, Judy!

I made only a couple minor tweeks to this soup, I used Hamburger instead of the Stew Meat, and used a smaller can (maybe 15oz) of crushed tomatoes.  Was pretty good, and will put this in my soup rotation.

Fabulous soup! My mother-in-law lives with me and needs low-sodium meals, so I used my own defatted, low-sodium beef broth and added fresh, diced potatoes, fresh corn (cut right off the cob), and fresh, diced carrots. I added the canned green beans, a can of low-sodium crushed tomatoes (so many of the raters complained about the soup being too tomato-ey), about half an onion, sliced, and 2 cloves (unpeeled) of garlic. I used the beef stew meat and a package of onion soup mix. I lightly salted and heavily peppered! Cooked all day! Served with fresh Bisquick biscuits and watermelon.......Beautiful!

This is a very easy recipe and the prep was truly less than 10 minutes.  I did not have any Onion Soup mix so I simply sauteed a small onion and placed that into the mix.  The result was flavorful and hearty. Highly recommended.

This has become a favorite dish in our home.  I make it weekly.  It's delicious and super easy.  I serve with a French Bread recipe from this site.  I tweeked a little to suit our taste.  I subbed 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes because I thought the original recipe was too tomatoey.  I added two cloves of fresh garlic, minced.  I use fresh potatoes instead of canned and I add 1 & 1/2 tsp of beef better than bouillan paste.  I skip adding salt and sprinkle fresh ground pepper over top.  Yum!  Thanks for this recipe.

Yummy! I've made this twice now and the first time I did all canned vegs except for using raw potatoes. At the end of 8 hours on low, the potatoes were still a little tough. The second time I made this, I microwaved 2 medium potatoes in some water for 5 minutes before adding to the crockpot. Perfect! This is wonderful on a chilly Fall night with some homemade bread.
*****Gotta a change- Youngest daughter wasn't crazy about the broth with tomatoes in it so I now omit them and add 1 can of beef broth. I miss the tomatoes, but it's still excellent without them.

Fabulous flavor!  I doubled the beef because I have two sons who are big eaters, and also added a can of beef broth because I was going to be away from the cooker for 12 hours. Delicious and soooo easy!

This is a very flavorful soup.  I was surprised because it was so easy.  I had to substitute a couple of items because I didn't have them canned.  I cut up potatoes and carrots and poured water over them so that it would be quick and easy in the morning.  I don't like tomatoes and green beans so I substituted butter beans.  I read some of the comments saying it was very tomato-ey so I added 2 beef bouillon cubes.  It was very good and simple.  Thank you.

Love it! I do agree though you do need to cut back about half on the crushed tomatoes and maybe use whole baby potatoes instead of the sliced.

This was an excellent base recipe for us. I used fresh potatoes and carrots, added frozen peas and frozen corn and beef broth. I also added bay leaf, soy sauce and worchestire sauce. It was just what I have been looking for and so easy. I love having dinner waiting on me when I get home. Thanks

I just tried this recipe yesterday because I was looking for something quick & easy & this is definitely both of those!  What makes this recipe so great is you can add or subtract any vegetables you want.  I added in a can of peas along with the other cans listed in the recipe.  I also added in some beef broth, one beef bouillon cube & some onion flakes.  I used diced potatoes & they didn't turn out mushy at all.  I also did not add a full can of tomatoes.  I didn't want an overpowering tomato taste so I only added half a can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  My kids gobbled it up!  I will definitely make this again & add a different combination of veggies next time.

Loved it! This was my first attempt at making vegetable soup. I was a little unclear if the green bean juice was supposed to go in or not, I left it out. Also for the 1 package beef with onion soup, I wasn't sure what this was so substituted with 1 packet of onion soup and 1 tbsp beef bulion. I also added 1 small can of V8 and about 1 cup water.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  I couldn't find the soup packet called for, so I bought a beef stew seasoning packet, which worked well.  Also subbed wine for the water and added a good bit more liquid than indicated-- better to be too watery when I got home than burned.  Also added some chopped celery and worst sauce.  Used diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  My husband loved the canned sliced potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

This was great!  I modified this a little.  I always brown the meat a little before putting it in the slow cooker, you don't need to but I like it that way.  I used two bags frozen veggies, one mixed veggies and the other the seasoned veggies with potatoes.  I used the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and I either have added a little more water or I have used beef or vegetable broth.  I have also cut up some celery if I had it on hand when I was making it.  I have made this many times since I found this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

A very tasty, easy, and economical recipe.  I made a few changes: I also added a can of whole white potatoes, and I added a decent amount of cooked pearled barley about an hour before serving.  This was mainly to 'cut' the recipe with some healthy, inexpensive whole grain (I'm a college student - always trying to get the most out of my expensive ingredients such as meat).  Last, I added about a cup of red wine at the same time I added the barley - I think that added some nice flavor.

I also agree with the prior reviewers who said that you don't lose anything in this recipe by using canned veggies. This was a very tasty stew I plan to make again.

I am a terribly picky eater who turns her nose up at anything resembling a chunk of tomato.  My husband is a die hard chunk guy.  I made this soup a couple of weeks ago when he wasn't feeling well.  It was really easy to follow and turned out great.  It made so much I had a few servings to freeze.  Thanks for sharing this!

This is the best recipe I have found in a long time!!  The soup came out perfect.  I aded one 2.0 oz pk. of onion soup mix and a Tbs. of beef granulated bouillon, instead of the beef/onion soup mix.  Whole family loved it!!

My husband raved about this soup. I didn't have the beef with onion soup. So I combined two ideas from previous reviews. I used about 1/2 a packet of dry onion soup mix and I used beef broth. It was so easy to make and it was wonderful. I highly recommend it!!!

My husband loves this soup.  I added peas at his request.  What a great smell to come home to after a long day at the office.   Couldn't be any easier.

The men loved this and it couldn't be easier. I added two cans of corn. I also couldn't fine the right soup so I used onion soup mix and some beef soup base.  Very good.

Perfect.  This is more of a stew than a soup.  I added an extra can of potatoes and carrots, and used Rotel, as suggested previously.  But I used the Italian Harvest Rotel, and it turned out great.  Great for taking leftovers to work for lunch!  Everyone else was drooling...

Pleasant surprise!  My family likes very flavorful foods so I added a 10 oz. can RoTel to the pot with the other canned goods. This way you need no guess-ti-mations with pepper. When the dish was about finished I added a little salt and a few tablespoons of Tony Chachere gravy mix to thicken the soup. (NOTE: You need a 6 qt crockpot. This makes a lot of soup). GREAT Taste!

I love this recipe! It is so easy and delicious. My pawpaw used to make a vegetable beef soup that tasted almost exactly like this one, and he would make a pot of it especially for me when I would visit. I never found out his recipe before he died, so finding this one makes me so happy! Not only is it delicious, but it brings back great memories! It is also very quick and easy to prepare!

this is my "go-to" recipe for beef vegetable soup whether I use a slow cooker or not.  I add limas and some broth or bouillion sometimes or use a mix of canned and fresh/frozen veggies but it comes out delicious every time.  Thanks Judy G.  I never would have thought something so simple would be so good!

Our family loved this soup. I'm going to make a point to have all the ingredients on hand for those days when you need something quick and easy yet hearty and nutritious, to throw together. It would also be good to have on hand for when you want to take soup to a sick friend.

I was skeptical of all of the canned vegetables.  But this turned out awesome. I put it in the crock pot at 8:00 a.m. and turned it off when I got home at 5:00.  I had a bunch of roasts from a side of beef that I needed to get rid of so I cut it in chunks and put it in.   The meat was perfect and very tender. I did add a can of beef broth, as many reviews suggested, and I added about 2 tablespoons of worchestershire(I like it) about 2 tablespoons of crushed garlic(I like garlic too) and a can of peas.  I highly recommend this recepie!!!

this is a keeper!!!!!!  I drained all of my canned veggies....I used petite cut tomatoes, undrained.  as per several other readers, I added one can of beef stock -- one hour before it was ready, I added a large handful of elbow macaroni, which sucked up the liquid (will probably add 2 cans of beef stock next time).  I thought this was a fantastic outcome with canned veggies!

Perfectly easy!  This is a great recipe for children learning to cook because there is no chopping or peeling!  I use whatever I have - frozen or canned veggies.  Sometimes fresh ones.  Thanks for submitting a good, basic recipe.

Love, love how easy this recipe is.. couldn't help myself, I browned the beef w/onions & garlic before throwing it into the crock pot w/everything else.  Next time will only use 1/2 a can of crushed tomatoes because it was too tomatoey for my taste & replace w/a can or two of beef broth.  Also 6 hrs on low, wasn't enough, needed more time.  Overall, great recipe.  Thx!

Very good! I took this to a meeting of about 20 people, so I tripled the recipe. It was such a hit! Several people said it tasted like the soup their grandma used to make :) you would never be able to tell the vegetables came from a can. Really hit the spot!

This recipe is amazingly easy and it tastes exactly like my grandmother's veggie beef soup recipe, without the hours of chopping and stirring! The only change I made was to make sure all the canned items were low or no sodium. It's a family favorite!

Easy Easy & D-Lish. I used chunky ground beef cooked in garlic. I used fresh & canned potatoes, canned corn, canned lima beans, can diced tomatoes, fresh celery, fresh carrots. I also used as suggested 2 packets onion soup mix and beef broth. Tastes great!

Great recipe! Family has requested it be made regularly.  I have changed it up a little. I cut the tomatoes in half and added a can of different beans each time and a can of peas. I added more beef onion soup mix and beef broth to ratchet up the flavor just a bit.  Terrific meal with buttered crusty French bread.

This is the easiest recipe I've ever made, and it tastes wonderful.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and am about to make it for the third time.

This makes a good soup!  I actually used a bone in chuck roast and the meat fell off the bone and shredded, bone added flavor.  I found the cube meat was very lean and not as tender when slow cooked.  I also just added the juice from veggies and stirred veggies in during last 2 hours.  Changed tomatoes to a 15 oz can which was perfect.

This recipe is great and simple.  I did do all fresh veggies, not canned and it was terrific.  And I did add beef stock too.

We LOVE this soup! Easy to put together, tastes great! I experimented and replaced the large can of tomatoes with a small can of diced tomatoes and a carton of the Campbell's specialty tomato and roasted garlic soup, and we very much liked the change. I've shared this recipe with all of my friends. Thanks!!

Needs a bit more seasoning, other than that I didn't change much.  I went with fresh baby carrots and fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned.  Once I tasted I added a good chunk of garlic powder and a little more salt and pepper.  I would definitely make it this way again.

I love this recipe, only way I changed it was by adding some beef broth, added in some cabbage, and a few bay leaves. Makes this taste incredible. Great recipe considering the easy prep.

When i read this recipe i figured for its simplicity i had to try it. I didn't think it was going to be all that great but after i saw the ratings i figured it wouldn't hurt. I just had a bowl and it is absolutely DELICIOUS! You can't even tell it's canned vegetables. It was so good. I'm definitely going to share this recipe. It makes a lot too!! I did add 3 dabs of hot sauce and 2 garlic cloves (minced).

So easy to make that my 10 year old Grandson Shane loves to make it by himself. It's surprising if a child helps or makes a recipe they are more inclined to eat it!

This an awesome soup.  The only change I made was to add onions. and skip the beans.  I will try other beans as I don't like green beans, maybe edamame beans.

My 3 year old daughter LOVES this soup. We actually call it "favorite soup" .  It is so easy to make and delicious. I do add an onion, chopped and 4 cloves of garlic, chopped. Other than that it's outstanding. I make it at least once a month.

My family loves this recipe. It's quick and easy. 
The only difference I made was I used (28 ounce)Tomato Sauce instead of Crushed Tomatoes. 
My bunch doesn't like crushed tomatoes.

This soup is so simple but delicious, and exactly what I was looking for. The only adaptations I made was to cook the beef in the broth first and add veggies later because I was not home during cooking and was afraid of coming home to overcooked mush. I also added lima beans. I froze half of it and it reheated very nicely. Welcome to the front of my recipe box!

Amazing soup!  I try to use as many fresh veggies as possible and add beef stock to make up for loss of liquid from the cans. I usually toss in a bay leaf or two for some extra flavor. The soup freezes well (the potatoes do lose some texture).  I have had lots of compliments on it!!

We have made this soup many times now.  I like that you just dump everything in the crockpot and go.  I cut way back on the tomatoes or sometimes don't add them at all.  Great both ways.

I enjoyed this soup!It is easy to make. I made a few changes though: I added two cans of beef broth, beef cube, can of garlic diced tomatoes, two cans water, fresh cut potatoes, carrots, celery, 1/4 cup barley, 3 bay leafs. I let it cook on low for 8 hrs. I find it to be perfect and not too much tomatoe flavor like other people were saying. I will definatly make this again!

I fixed this using all canned vegetables just like the recipe stated.  However I did add a few things... I added a can of peas, two celery stalks, seven small green onions, half of a green pepper and finally one medium size jalapeño pepper. THe pepper gave it just a little bit of zip.  I thought it came out just perfect for me!!!

Very good recipe. Next time I think I may marinate the meat or brown it with seasoning first as it was a bit bland. Veggies all tasted great though! I did add Beef broth instead of water for extra flavorand a can of white kidney beans. Will definitely make this again as it is a very versatile recipe.

Cut the tomatoes by at least half and you've got an awesome dinner. I only put in half of the can of crushed tomatoes, added a can of peas, and 2 cups of beef broth and it came out excellent but still strong on the tomato side.

You really cant get more simple than this!!  And honestly its really good.  I took a few tips from other reviewers and made a couple of my own and it turned out great.  Any of the vegetables that I could find in low sodium I used.... I used the juice from all but the green beans.... not sure why but the recipe didnt say to use it so I didnt.  I used both package of the beef onion soup mix that came in the box.  I added a few splashes, maybe a tablespoon of worst. sauce and a few shakes of garlic powder.  Plus I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth... I'm glad I did because it would have too thick without.  What I didnt do and would do next time for sure is cut the stew meat into fours.... it was way too big as it came for soup.  This is a very easy and good recipe... a keeper for sure!!  Doesnt taste like canned vegetables at all!!

I made this mostly as stated- I added some chopped onions.  We didn't like it at all.  I'm not sure what the problem was, maybe the onions, but it just didn't taste good to us.  I think I'm a little bit hard to please with veg beef soup.  My 'pop-pop' was the KING of veg beef soup and I've never been able to duplicate it.  I wasn't old enough to be a good observer when he made this recipe and sadly, he's since passed, so I can't get his recipe now.  I keep looking for a soup as good as his so I can keep the memories going.  Thanks for another try at veg beef soup!

I've always used recipes where you'd have to cut up endless vegetables -- I didn't even know canned carrots and potatoes existed until this recipe!  It saved a ton a time, was delicious, and my whole family loved it -- even the 3-year-old!  (I added barley too.)

Very good and easy to make.  Instead of canned potatoes and carrots, I used fresh.  I did pour in about a cup and a half of water to add liquid since I didn’t use canned potatoes and carrots.

This soup is a simple option when you have a sick family member, and not a lot of time to chop and dice fresh ingredients.  A bonus is that you can keep all ingredients on hand in the pantry or freezer, and whip this together without an extra trip to the store.  The result is a very tasty and healthy beef vegetable soup.

I could not bring myself to use a prepackaged soup mix, however, so I used several tablespoons of this all-natural homemade beef stew seasoning. 

I browned the beef with onions to get some extra onion flavor.

I used half the recommended crushed tomatoes, and supplemented with Rotel roasted tomatoes and chilis. 

Instead of canned potatoes, which my husband does not care for, I used two small cans of mushrooms, drained.  and for a carbohydrate, added 1/2 cup quick cooking barley 20-30 minutes before the end of cooking time.

I had a couple cups of broth leftover from boiled beef short ribs, so threw that in too. 

I recommend serving with crumbled saltines or oyster crackers.

This is a great easy recipe and easily adjustable. I decided to make this recipe and use whatever veggies I had left in the house. I made it with fresh little potatoes, celery, onion, and carrots. I also used canned corn, peas, and diced tomatoes. As other reviewers had suggested, I added 16oz of beef broth. I also added one teaspoon of Better Than Bullion to the crock pot for flavor because I did not have onion soup mix.

This was really good.  Wonderfully easy to throw together.  Following other suggestions, I used a 15oz can of crushed tomatoes, a can of beef broth, and 2 packets of soup mix.  It came out great!  I cooked it for 8 hours and the meat just melted in our mouths.  I will definitely make this again!

This was great!! My entire family loved it!! I added 1 can of beef stock broth and 3 cloves of garlic.   The canned vegetables were easy and tasted great!  I might add 1/2 pound more meat next time.  The guys in my family love to eat!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This soup was delicious. I used 1.5 lbs of stew meat, and I used 1 packet of the onion soup mix and 1 packet of Au Jus Beef gravy mix. Instead of canned sliced potatoes I used tiny whole red and yellow potatoes with peel left on. It turned out really good!

Pretty good, but I added a lot to 'beef' up the flavor. Garlic, fresh veg, (what I had on hand). Worcestershire, soy, turnips, not potatoes. I seldom use canned veg.

This is truly simple to make. I browned the beef cubes slightly before adding to the vegetables. I had no-salt corn and no-salt green beans so I used those to cut down on the sodium a bit. This soup is delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe as written, but added additional stew meat, a can of lima beans, and some vegetable broth.  I did add fresh carrots and potatoes instead of the canned (I don't care for the texture of the canned versions). Oh my gosh, it is delicious!  This one is a keeper!

Made it per instructions and it was delicious. Although I seared the stew meat.  In our slow cooker the project was ready in 5 hrs although we started on 'high' for 45 minutes before dropping to 'low'.

After supper, I decided to add cubed turnips that I cooked in the juices of the soup then added it to the package, yup it was equally as delicious!! 

Highly recommend this recipe for its simplicity.

This was a delicious and super easy weeknight soup with quick prep, loved that.  Opening cans ,  how easy is that!  I cut the beef into small cubes, seasoned with Montreal, and added a minced scallions I needed to use up.  This is pretty bland as written, so later I added some seasoned salt and some onion and garlic powders.  I did use salt free beef broth and salt free veggies.  I also used diced tomatoes and a small can of tomatoe sauce in place of the crushed.  Thanks for sharing!

Great basic recipe. Would have given a 5 but made some changes. One can of tomatoes filled with beef broth, added oregano and bay leaf. Cooked 6.5 hours on low. Next time will use 1.5 lbs of meat.

It was easy to make. I added a can of beef broth like others suggested and some beef bouillon. But it still had too much tomato taste for my liking. However my 8 yr old son loved it.

Yes!!!! Made this exactly as per the directions with one exception (I used 1 1/2 lbs of meat as I wanted mine meatier). This was perfect!!! Hearty and delish! I was skeptical about using canned veggies but everything came out just fine. The base is a little bit on the tomatoe-y side but I liked it. May add tablespoon or so of garlic powder next time but aside from that. Perfect!!!

We loved it - followed the recipe exactly but added a half can of water at the beginning (I used the tomato can). This is a keep and I will be making it often.

I made it with the stew meat and then again with hamburger. I loved it with the hamburger. It was probably the best vegetable soup I’ve ever made.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my family absolutely loved it! It was more like a stew; therefore I called it "stoop' Haha! I let it cook in the slow cooker for 8 hours and it was amazing.  Leftovers were even better yet! Will certainly make it again.

Since I am not a big fan of canned veggies I used fresh veggies  from my garden, added a container beef broth, garlic, doubled the beefy onion soup for additional flavor and a tiny pinch of sugar to bring out the flavor. It was delicious. My husband and 5 year old loved it

You know how canned soup just has that "je ne sais quoi" taste about it?  Well this soup has that same taste, so I'm thinking it comes from using all the canned veggies...

It is by no means a BAD soup  but it's not GREAT either.  It is SUPER EASY and makes A LOT, so I might make again because of that.

My only modifications were to add 6 cups of beef broth and a little ditalini pasta because I like my soup brothy and with pasta.

This is good soup!!   I like the easy fix, and it tastes like homemade.   Instead of peeling and dicing potatoes, I make it even easier by using hash browns - I always keep a bag of the plain frozen ones on hand for soups, etc.  No need to thaw them - just add some to the crockpot.
I will make this soup again.

What a delicious meal!  My sister gave me this recipe and I made changes to it based on what she told me.  I used the onion soup mix instead of the beef and onion mix.  Also, I used three cans of beef broth.  I will definitely be making this again, AND, my sister makes this quite often as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Ok, first off I'm going to say, use this recipe as a jumping off point.  Don't worry if you don't have the exact ingredients!  Soup is incredibly versatile and adapts to just about any change you want to make.  That said, I made this recipe (sort of) and it came out great!  I used some suggestions from other reviewers and what ever I could find in my freezer and pantry.  I used a 1/2 bag frozen mixed veggies, 1/2 bag frozen green beans, 3 red potatoes diced, a 1 lb ham steak defrosted and cubed, a box of beef stock, a 14 oz can diced fire roasted tomatoes,  1 can diced carrots and the envelope of onion soup mix , about 2 cups water, pepper and garlic.  Ok, so it might seem like a brand new recipe- but it was great!  Be creative!

Very good and so EASY.  I did make the following changes though: I omitted the tomato sauce, added some beef broth and a can of Veg-All.  Substituted lima beans for green beans and added a lot of garlic.  I also used two cans of seasoned diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes called for.

Took me 10 minutes to prepare this soup in the crock pot - and that includes browning the meat ... It is absolutely delicious and what a great meal to have ready when everybody comes home from school and work and sports ....

Made exactly as directed but reduced tomatoes by about 60%. Cooked for 8 hours on low but could have used even longer. yummm

Easy as easy gets! I did add one can of Beef Broth and only put 3/4 of the canned tomatoes - but all in all, it was DELICIOUS! My husband said that it was the best Vegetable Beef soup he has ever had and I agree with him!

Canned vegetables are okay but usually have salt in them and being canned, taste differently.   I usually make vegetable soup starting with a beef soup bone and brown it first. I also add a handful of barley.  I  save left over veggies from dinners in a container in the freezer, adding different amounts as I have them.  I toss in corn with garlic butter over it, mixed frozen veggies with butter etc.  That tablespoon of this and 1/2  cup of that veggie adds up.  When I have 2 or 3 containers filled, I make soup. I use crushed tomatoes also. My husband like thick soup so I add fresh diced potato and carrots too.

Used the recipe with my own add-ons.  Instead of 1 lb of stew meat, I used 2 lb of beef shank.  The beef marrow added so much flavor and oddly enough - aroma.  Even a day later you could smell this soup.  I did 8 hours on low.  Added an extra can of corn and potatoes.  Did not add any additional salt.  The soup mix and vegetables had enough salt.  This basic recipe is a keeper.  Everyone should try it.

I used all the ingredients exactly as it calls for but cut up my own potatoes (2 medium size) instead of canned potatoes.  I also added about 12 oz of water.  So easy and so delicious!

I accidentally bough onion-mushroom soup mix, and it was in the middle of an ice storm, so I just added a can of beef broth. Probably the cheapest, easiest crock pot meal I've ever made, and the kids loved it. (Even the picky ones) I was skeptical of the canned potatoes, etc, but it was great! So glad I found this recipe, I'm making it again and it's only been 3 weeks!

This was my very first slow cook recipe. Initially I wasn't very happy about the taste because the vegetables tasted like they came from a can, but I enjoyed the soup because the beef was fresh. The flavor blended really well after eating in the next day. Will make it again during a cold day.

This was really easy, filling and perfect for a cold, wintry day. I made the recipe exactly as written except I didn't have canned potatoes so I used small potatoes, cubed that I had in the bin. Everyone at the sledding party loved it. Will definitely make it again.

I made this a few more times and used fresh veggies in stead of canned. Turns out so much better. I know it's more work but worth it! I also added Montreal steak seasoning. It is my go all with practically everything I make!! Just be careful not to over use it, it can get salty. I buy the 25% less salt. Also I add beef bouillon.

So easy! I've made this several times, and it's always a hit. If you're looking for some zing, consider adding a can of Rotel tomatoes in place of the crushed tomatoes.

My entire family loved this soup.  It is not easy to get young children to eat vegetable soup but mine wanted seconds of this one!!   I followed the recipe except I used Liptons onion soup mix and one can of beef broth in the place of the beef soup mix since I did not have any.  I also added about a teaspoon of Tabasco hot sauce (because we like things spicy in south Louisiana).  I think I will try making it with stewed tomatoes next time in the place of the crushed.  I will definitely be adding this to my routine meal collection.

So quick and easy! I cut the beef onion soup in half and add beef bullion because we don't like a lot of onion. I can get this in the crock pot in 10 minutes and come home to real dinner. Love it!

I was leery about using all canned vegetables for this, but decided to try it to see how it turned out. I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice the vegetables were! I did add a bunch of seasoning when I made it, though. I added garlic powder, rosemary, basil, onion powder, dried chives, parsley, salt, and pepper. I also used a can and a half of beef stock instead of adding any water. The broth turned rich and flavorful. The best part is the amount of leftovers there were, which stretched the low cost of this meal even further.

We love hearty soups all year round, and this recipe is easy to make.  I substituted frozen corn and green beans for the canned vegetables.  I think that ground hamburg would be tastier than the beef, and will try it next time.

I made the soup but with a couple of small changes. I used fresh carrots and substituted the potatoes for a can of black eyed peas. I also used two cups of beef broth and onion soup mix. The beef broth rounded out some of the tomato flavor which I liked. It was easy to make and tasted great! I also used the low sodium veggies in cans. I would definitely make it again.

You couldn't tell the difference between canned and fresh veggies.  Because my store didn't carry canned potatoes I used a large yellow Yukon which I chunked up and let it cook with the beef for 6 hours along with a can of beef broth.  Everything else was canned except I excluded the corn and substituted small green Lima beans for the green beans.  I used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed as I like a more broth-like soup. All canned ingredients were added in the last hour or so.  Plenty of salt in the canned stuff so I eliminated the onion soup mix.  Excellent!  Just the right amount of  solids to broth.  I'll make again.

We loved this soup!  I used 2 packets of Beefy Onion Soup Mix and threw in some tobasco, but it would be just as delicious as written I'm sure.  Great recipe!

Cooked on high for 2-3 hours. Added vegetable last 15-30 mins so they wouldn't be mushy. Used 1 packet of 20 ounce onion soup mix. Added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 3/4 tsp salt.  Used pot roast meat, diced. Easy and flavorful.

This is very easy to make and also quite tasty. I added a few changes... I cut potatoes instead of canned (only because I didn't have canned potatoes), I added water and beef broth to get more juices, I also added half an onion (chopped in small pieces) for more flavor and lastly I added noodles to make it more of a soup. I've done it with and without noodles. This is so good!! I ate leftovers the next day and it was just as good as the first day.

I have made this several times now and whole family likes it.   I did not include the liquid from all the vegetables because I felt like it might be too much which it was.   It came out nice and thick.  I poured the liquid into 2 cup measuring cup just in case it turned out that I needed it.   It amounted to 2 cups.   When I first put everything in the crock pot, it looks like it will be too thick but as it cooks it forms its own broth.    I have also added 1/4 cup quick cook barley to it.

This is a great, easy, recipe!  The hardest and most time consuming part is cutting up the beef.  I add a cup of real beef broth, a can of diced petite tomatoes, a can of peas, and double the potatoes and carrots.  Also with about an hour left I add a half cup of pearl barley and a cup of macaroni elbows and it turns out just like mom used to make when I was a kid.  My sons love it, and so do I!  The boys love to help open the cans and pour everything in and stir it.  We cook this about twice a month during the winter and the leftovers make a few good quick suppers for this single dad of 2 boys.

This was really good. Slow cooking the meat all day made it really tender. The soup was such a good base that you could really do anything to adjust it to your taste. You can add pasta for a noddle soup or even dumplings if you prefer. This reminds me of a base for a Maryland crab soup, just add some Old Bay seasoning, and some crab meat. This is a great, quick, easy meal for a busy week night dinner.

I was skeptical of all this canned stuff, but honestly the soup was delicious. The whole family loved it. I did add a can of beef broth, but otherwise stayed with the recipe. I served it with shaved parmesan cheese on top. This is in my weeknight repertoire until springtime!

This was prepared per the recipe except an added small can of mushrooms that my husband snuck in later. Next time, I will use the smaller can of crushed tomatoes and add beef broth. My family thought it was a little too tomatoey.  Also may try double the meat & adding some other vegetables.  Really good and so easy!

I will definitely make this again and again. I dumped everything in together and the meat and canned veggies were perfect. I chose tomato sauce over crushed tomatoes because I don't like the texture. Also, I added a can of beef broth and half a cup of red wine to increase the flavor and amount of liquid. I tasted it all day and was so please, then, at the last 30 minutes I decided to add some tiny shelled pasta and I'm so glad I did. However, it's excellent without the pasta.

Do not make this if you are looking for a 5 star restaurant quality meal. However, I'm not picky and sometimes I need a super easy meal to make on a week night. This is absolutely perfect for that! I've never made a simpler soup! The only prep time is opening cans! There is great flavor for a soup that uses canned veggies. Perfect family meal for the busy parent!

I used onion soup mix and it was wayyy to strong for my taste.  I ended up adding about a cup of water and a small can of tomato paste since I prefer more of  a tomato flavor, and finished it with a couple dashes of cayenne. Very tasty.

I followed the recipe as directed except I mistakenly drained all of the liquid from the canned vegetables - I did add some water.  I was disappointed in the outcome .... the flavor was disappointing - just wanted to warn everyone do not drain all the liquid. Maybe that's what went wrong with my soup.

I made it without the soup mix due to an egg allergy and it still tasted great! My favorite thing about it is that since it uses canned vegetables, it's easy to stock up when they go on sale and it is super fast and easy to open all the cans and dump them in the crock pot.

This was wonderful! The only thing I altered was adding one small can of chiplotle diced tomatoes along with a small can of diced tomatoes.  Yummy!!

Loved this recipe and so did my husband and daughter!  So easy and quick to throw together.  I only had a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes, so I added a can of beef broth at the beginning and also a small can of peas.  Added 1/2 cup barley towards the end and another can of beef broth.  I will definitely make this again.

Disappointed.  Needs more flavor.  We ended up dosing the soup with A1 steak sauce so it didn't go to waste.

OMG, this soup is soooo good just as written.  I however used 2 cans of sliced potatoes, and 2 pkgs onion/beef soup.  I had some left over, and to that I added some beef broth for the extra juice.  I may add that the 2nd time I make this.  It gave it a bit more of a beefy flavor.  Whichever way, this soup is wonderful!!

I made this and It was a big hit, especially for how easy it is to make! All I did differently was add some water and used less tomatoes. This is def a family favorite here!

I made this recipe last week exactly as it instructed. My family loved it, and we finished it off after just a day or two. I was in search of a simple to put together easy vegetable beef soup. This did the trick! I'm making it again as I type with only one alteration. I used a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, and 1 can of beef stock. I also drained a little of the liquid from each of the cans of veggies, then made up for the liquid shortage with a little more beef stock. I'm hoping to boost the beefy flavor, and cut back on the high acid of the extra tomatoes. My wife actually LOVED the original (she loves tomato soup) but I thought it was just a little too tomatoey. Still an awesome easy recipe, and the thing that makes cooking fun is to put your own spin on it.

WOW!  Ridiculously EASY! I mostly went by the recipe.  Just added a handful of raw baby carrots to the can of carrots and an extra can of undrained green beans.  Used most of a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes as the recipe stated.  I cooked it for over 7 hours.  DELICIOUS!  I love the tomatoes and it had PLENTY of flavor. I will definitely make it again. My husband, being the usual carnivore male, would have taken MORE meat, but I LOVED IT as is!  No need for extra salt and I used all low sodium cans. Just added more pepper.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was so simple! I love to make most of my dishes from scratch, so I was pretty hesitant to use all canned vegetables. But it turned out to be AWESOME! My boyfriend loved it and he can be rather picky. The only modification I made was that I used a Beef Tender Chuck Roast rather than stew meat. I'm sure stew meat would be fine, I've just never used it before. For an easy recipe with lots of flavor, this is it!

I loved this soup!  I was a little apprehensive about the canned vegetables but they really held up!  I only used a small can of diced tomatoes (Italian seasoned)and a can of water. I added a couple beef bouillon cubes., but no added salt or pepper.  The taste was outstanding and it was very filling!

This soup was not only amazingly easy, but amazing and hearty! I used canned diced potatoes. Half the canned veggies I used no salt added, and added NO additional salt or pepper and it was amazingly tasty!!! Not a single person reached for the salt or pepper when eating it. Great recipe!

This recipe was so easy and my fiance said it was a 5-star dinner . . . the only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I used only half the can of tomatoes (per other reviews) and added an extra fresh potato and a carrot.  If I hadn't done this, the tomato flavor would have been completely overwhelming.   Oh, and I cooked it for 8 hours so the fresh carrot and potato would soften up during the cooking process.

I made this recipe.  Which I thought was very good.  Would have given it 5 stars except did not make enough broth, mine came out more like a stew, next time will have to add beef broth or more tomatoes.  And just my opinion, I felt like it was missing something to give it a little bit more flavor.  Will have to go through reviews and see what other people did to give it a little more zip. Thank you for the recipe, it is very good.

Five stars because it is so simple to make but still delicious. This should be a winter staple of every busy parent! The recipe is good as stated but can easily be improved if you have a little time by doing the following:
Brown the beef before adding to your slow cooker (I used 1.5 lbs. of beef). Substitute a can of Veg-All for the can of carrots. Add a can of beef broth. Saute a medium sliced onion and a clove of minced garlic and add it to the soup about an hour before it is done. Excellent served with cornbread or a crusty baguette and butter. So yummy but delightfully simple! Freezes well, too!

What a wonderful surprise!  I generally don't cook with canned vegetables and rarely use the crock pot.  But I printed out this recipe a while ago and kept bumping into it so I finally decided to make it on this gloomy, rainy weekend.  I added a cup of beef broth as I like brothy soup, but I didn't change anything else.  It came out amazingly tasty.  I am taking cooking classes and learning to cook foods in new ways, using farro, farmer's market ingredients, etc.  That's nice, but sometimes it's great to just throw everything basic into a pot and let it cook.  Making a good soup can't get easier than this recipe.  - urs3477

I added a can of beef broth as other reviewers suggested, but the overall flavor was still a little bland.  The recipe was an easy weeknight meal, but won't be on our menu list again.

The EASIEST way to make a delicious stew. I almost forgot to make this before leaving for work, and literally had it cooking 3 minutes later.

This recipe is hearty and I add water to each bowl I fill to make it a little more soup-like. This serves about 5 large bowls of soup, and cost me about $13 to make. Leftovers are as delicious as the first bowl.

My only concern is the high amount of salt (due to the canned ingredients), so be sure to by low sodium ingredients!

Quick and tasty! I made it exactly like the directions, using the cheapest canned veggies and generic onion soup mix.  It was just fine.

this was awesome - i agree with the other reviews - very easy to do, can use with canned vegetables. i put it all in the crockpot before i left for work and cooked it on low for 8.5 hours. given that long cook time, i added 2 cans (from canned potatos) of water to make sure it didn't dry out. i used 2 tablespoons beef bouillon instead of the beef and onion soup mix because i already had it on hand. this was so tasty!

Made exactly as recipe states.  Was super fast to throw together.  If you brown the meat first, you can pretty much eat it right away, if you wanted to make it on the cook top.  But I used the slow cooker like the recipe called for.  It was good, but nothing stand out that will makes me want to make it again.  There really isn't much broth with this and you could add a bit more water if you wanted more broth, and counter the extra water by using an extra envelope of onion soup mix.  But I served it with homemade rolls and it was nice to dunk those in the broth. But the flavor was nice overall.

This recipe is so easy to make, and my kids ate it!(and they don't like soup). taste - 4; simplicity - 5; my kids actually eating it - 5+++
Only modification was used onion soup mix - couldn't find beef with onion mix in store.

Such an easy soup to make.  I made this in my slow cooker and added some barley while it was in crock pot.  Came out great and really liked the added barley which cooked perfectly in crock pot.

Jan won't eat it.  To much tomato
Add onion and celery.  Also peas at the end.
Needs spice:  bay leaves, parsley flakes, garlic power, orginago, etc.

Flavor was great!!  Only problem I had was the beef was kind of tough.  I had cooked it on high with the tomatoes and the liquid from the canned vegetables for over two hours and then when I added the vegetables I switched to low and cooked for 5 more hours and beef was still tough.  I think next time I will brown off the beef first and also cut into smaller chunks.  But great flavor and used full amount of tomatoes and didn't think it was too tomatoey at all!!  Overall will definitely be making it again - so easy and tasty!!

My first review, just had to give it 5 stars.  So simple, so fast, very delicious.  The kids thought it was awesome!  I put it together before we went to the state fair, and we came home to a hearty nutritious meal.  It was perfect!  Must confess, I did brown the meat first - just because I like the taste better in the crockpot.  Did not season it with salt, just the pepper was plenty.

Hubby said this was awesome and it was so easy to make.  I did add a little garlic and a can of beef broth as well.  I cooked some pasta separately and rinsed in cold water and added to the soup before I stored it in plastic containers for the freezer.

Made this yesterday. I thought this was just okay. Had  pretty good flavor but I thought it was a little too tomatoee tasting. I thing I would prefer more of a beef stock flavor. I didnt really notice any difference between using the canned veggies and the frozen ones which I normally use when I make soup. Even though I thought is was okay, I probably will not make this again as written.

This was really good!  My family ate the whole crockpot!  The only thing I did differently was dredge the meat in flour and brown it a little in oil (I just like it that way) and add a can of beef broth and use baked potatoes that had been in the fridge a couple days, cut up.  Oh, and we didn't have carrots.. but I think you could almost do anything! So easy!

This was delicious , husband said I can make it anytime. Followed almost exactly but added 2 cans of whole potatoes, only 14 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and could not find the beef with onion soup so used onion soup and added beef stock.

I have it going on the stove (didn't' use slow cooker due to the timing).  I didn't have stew meat on hand but had everything else.  I had some cans of Beef in juice from a food basket I had recieved and didn't know what to do with it.  I used that instead of the stew meat.  I've sampled a bit of it while cooking and it tastes great.  Makes alot for one person, but I'm probably going to freeze a couple of servings and also give my dad a container of it.  Good way to use up excess of canned goods that are on hand.

This is my favorite kind of recipe for a rushed day AND it was super good. I added peas because I didn't have green beans. This one, just the way it is, is a keeper.

Have made this about six times now and the only changes I've made are to use a large 28oz can of plum tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes.  I drain all the vegetables (but not the tomatoes) and add one 14.5 oz. beef broth.  The first time I made this the onions from the packaged soup mix were still hard so I don't put this into a slow cooker anymore I just heat on top of the stove for a few hours.  I brown the stew meat throughly before adding all the canned vegetables.  I cook about a half to three fourths cup of Kluski noodles, in salted water, then drain and add to the soup the last half hour of cooking.  If I can find salt free or low sodium canned veggies/broth that is what I will use then add salt to taste.  I've stopped making all the other vegetables soups because this one is the easiest and the best tasting soup by far.  Thank you Judy G for submitting this tasty recipe.

Excellent soup!  Never made vegetable beef soup before and made it just like the recipe except for following the suggestion that fewer tomatoes would be good.  Next time I will add more corn because I like it in soup!

Great recipe!  Omitted the carrots, threw in a few green peas & a little beef broth rather than water.  Served with cornbread & a cobbler for dessert & my family about licked their bowls!

Delicious! Added a can of peas and an extra can of potatoes. Used 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes, and added 1 can of beef broth. When it was done cooking, added a couple handfuls of instant mashed potatoes to thicken.

Excellent quick soup, especially for a college student on the go. I did add an onion and garlic salt, but other than that, it was well received among friends and it reheats well the next day.

Well 4.5. I've NEVER used a crockpot/slow cooker and this was the first recipe in it! The only thing I didn't like was it seemed a bit salty. Using canned veggies tends to have lots of salt. I try to buy the least sodium as possible. I did add 1 can of beef broth (MORE salt) and an xtra lb of stew meat. Put it on at 2pm and it's still cooking at 9pm (although I did have TWO bowls with some noodles). Used peas instead of beans but next time will add that too!).  I'm thrilled to have used my slow cooker! I could never get beef to be tender (as in chili). Was a good tummy filling recipe for a cool night.

Everyone Loved this soup! I was in a hurry so I cooked hamburger on the stove with garlic then dumped into a large pot with the other ingredients. I didnt use carrots though. Added a can of mushrooms. After it had cooked for about 30 minutes it still looked a little to thin so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and it made the soup a little more hardy! GREAT!!

This was good..I changed it a bit, using a can of diced tomatoes in garlic & olive oil, I added a drained can of mixed veggies instead of the can of potatoes & green beans since both were in the can of mixed veggie can.  I also added a can of rinsed kidney beans.  I added some other spices as well.

I give this a 5 for ease of preparation but only a three for taste -- and isn't that what really matters?  It tastes just like canned vegetable beef soup.  If I'm going to go to any more trouble than opening up a can (even if it's opening up 5 or 6 cans) then I really want my meal to taste better.  Also:  WHOO-EEEEE!  CANNED POTATOES SMELL AWFUL!   AVOID CANNED POTATOES!  I served the soup with a tasty artisian bread instead -- a real highlight.

Great Beef Veggie Soup.  We used canned vegetables but would recommend using the low sodium canned veggies.

My family really enjoyed this soup.  I made only slight changes by adding some Tobasco and 1 can beef broth.

Couldn't get any easier than this.  I enjoyed it but my family preferred the veggies to be a little finer rather than chunky so I will change that the next time.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I tried to make this exactly to spec - even though a couple of the ingredients were in sizes that I couldn't find in my local store, I measured everything to get it just right.
I had most of this myself, but shared some with The Woman I Love. We'll probably give this a 4-out-of-5-stars rating. It is good, solid comfort food, and pretty easy to make. The meat turned out to be very tender too. I didn't think this deserved all five stars because I'm sure some improvement(s) can be made to make this a knockout recipe. For example, I was a tad disappointed that the only spices were the salt and pepper. I'm a rookie cook so I don't know what spices could have been the best additions, but I'm pretty sure that some kind of spicing-up might bring it to a 5-star recipe.

My husband loved this soup, and it sure was easy to make.  My only complaint is that I didn't think it tasted all that much different than canned soup from the supermarket.  I'll probably only make this again if my husband requests it, which I'm sure he will since he was such a fan.

Very Good! The whole family really enjoyed it. I served hot cornbread with it and it warmed our tummys and hearts! Loved that you can just dump it and go...so easy and yummy!

Unfortunately, this turned pretty mushy and bland by the time it cooked all day.  I used frozen stew vegetables instead of the canned. Not a big hit...thanks anyway.

Great meal for a weeknight when you don't have time to think about cooking.  Very easy and filling.

I just LOVE a recipe that you can literally "dump" everything in the pot and forget about it!  This is so easy and makes plenty to eat for one meal and freeze the other half for later.  I used a large envelope of the beef and onion soup mix...it was just right for us.  Great recipe!

I read a few reviews and add beef broth and frozen vegetables.  Both my husband and my 1 year old like it.
