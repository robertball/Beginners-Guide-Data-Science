I used all minced red pepper and omitted the green only because my family does not care for green peppers. I also used reduced fat sour cream/mayonnaise and I increased the garlic powder to a half teaspoon. This is absolutely DELICIOUS. My kids and I shared this for a quick lunch, served with tortilla chips. All of us loved it. I was missing the flavor of cilantro (I know that it's usually a love/hate relationship with cilantro, I'm a lover.), next time I would swap out the parsley for cilantro.

Just made this. Used fresh sweet corn, cooked in olive oil for 5 minutes. Very good!

I doubled this and served once as a side dish and once as a dip.  It received rave reviews at church.  I made a few changes based on personal preferences.  I replaced the green bell pepper with more red and yellow peppers, substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, and used corn I had canned.  Simple to make, versatile, and tastes great on the second day!

Very easy to make.  Was skeptical of the sauce, but when we all tasted it...absolutely delicious! I didn't have fresh parsely, so I used fresh cilantro.  I am a big fan and almost always have it on hand. It was a big hit.  Will definately make again (and again)!

As a cilantro hater, this cilantro-less salsa appealed to me. I followed the recipe, though I did choose to eliminate black pepper per personal preference and I didn't measure the corn, peppers, or onions.  We preferred to eat this as a side dish, rather than a dip.  If I make this again, I'll use dried parsley as opposed to fresh, simply because it's not our favorite and dried is a bit less pungent.  Thanks for the recipe, Amy!

Delicious.  Made all of the dressing, but only used 1/2 when I tossed it in with the beans and veggies.  For my family's tastes, it was a good choice - perfect amount.  Thanks for the recipe, will be making it again.

I loved this! I did make one adjustment, only as a nod to the fact that I'm trying to watch my macros. I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and the dressing was delicious! This is one of those recipes that you could easily play around with; add avocado, hot peppers, whatever tickles your taste buds! I also plan on making the dressing to use it on my salads, it's that yummy :)

I really like this. I adjusted a bit. I added jalapeno pepper, diced. I do not like mayo, so I doubled sour cream ( would use a bit less next time).

Good flavors but needed to reduce the amount of dressing as the recipe as given made too much.

We have made this with red peppers and omitted the cream for people who do not do dairy, we serve it both ways. This is a family favorite.

Made this last night and brought to work today.  Everyone loved it.  Very good, fresh tasting.  I used Tony Chachere's instead of the chili powder and cumin, and apple cider vinegar because I didn't have the red wine vinegar on hand.  This would be great with avocado, fish, or chicken in a wrap.  Definitely a keeper.

Instead of adding parsley to the salad, I added 1 teaspoon cilantro paste to the dressing and the juice and zest of 1 lime to the dressing.  It was delicious!!  the dressing the way I made it is also good plain with tortilla chip dippers.  I used this as a side salad instead of a salsa...lots of flavour!!

This recipe was a hit with my friends and family. However, I did leave out the red wine vinegar and the cumin. Later, I tried adding the cumin and didn't like it nearly as much. Be cautious when adding red onion because it can be overpowering, and make sure you cut the peppers very small! Overall, this is a great recipe!

This needs something. Very flat. I even duded jalapeño peppers and cilantro. Still flat.
