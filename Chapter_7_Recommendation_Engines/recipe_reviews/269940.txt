I needed a quick recipe with sausage and this was amazing! I put this over veggie spaghetti. I didn’t have sweet potato or eggplant so I used zucchini, cherry tomatoes and spinach. It is a hit! Thank you for this! I will definitely try it your way soon!

I made this NEVER having it in my life.. I won’t lie I have not ever liked sweet potatoes but made this exactly as recipe called for figuring I would give something new a try... It was FANTASTIC.. very light  but very good. The flavors all melded together are truly perfect. The only reason I gave it four stars is because my husband said it is too light..?? will certainly be making again.

Fabulous meal! Although I did not have any sweet potatoes I made this last night for dinner. Honey said "Make this again please!"

My family loved the recipe.  I thought it might not have a lot of flavor, but the vegetables compliment each other very well.  The sweetness of the sweet potatoes, the zesty tomatoes popping in your mouth along with the smoked sausage and shallots added to the flavor which only needed the salt and pepper to bring out the flavor a little more.  I highly recommend this recipe.
