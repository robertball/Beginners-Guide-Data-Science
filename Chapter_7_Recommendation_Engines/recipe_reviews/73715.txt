Hello, its me.  I submitted the recipe and I would like to clear a few things up.  When I submitted the recipe, Allrecipes changed a few of the steps which confused the process.  First, this recipe makes two full dinners, or 8 servings of paneer for hefty eaters.  The paneer must be processed in a food processor for the right consistency.  You do not need to turn out the cheese unless you do not have a food processor (mistake made by website).  The paneer should be chilled overnight and I cannot stress this step enogh.  The last and most major mistake, the paneer should be deep fired, not fried in a shallow pan with a cup of oil.  Because of the delicate nature of paneer, flipping it over in a pan will make it crumble.  The paneer should only be fried until very pale golden brown.  It will appear like it is not completely cooked.  It only needs about 30 seconds to firm up.  It adds almost no fat to the recipe if the oil is hot enough and it is fried quickly.  The fried pieces can be frozen for up to 30 days in a ziploc bag after chilling.  I hope this clears up a little of the confusion about the recipe.  The website changes a great deal once submitted.

I have been making paneer for years, and I have always used lemon juice to curdle the milk.  I will never do that again!!!!  Using the buttermilk adds such a softness and light texture.  I can't hardly believe that I made this myself.  It is the most authentic I have tasted.  Also, I emailed Ami (the owner) and she mentioned a few mistakes in how the website converted the recipe.  First, you do not need to knead the paneer on a cutting board unless you do not have a food processor.  Second, the paneer tastes better if you let it sit overnight, and frt the next day.

AWESOME!  This recipe is so simple and ultimately delicious!  You will not be disappointed.

I've previously made paneer using yogurt - but it didn't turn out nearly as good, or produce as much as this recipe!  


I've since made this recipe a couple times... my suggestions?  Don't bother with food processing OR the kneeding.  However, if you do decide to food process, you do NOT need to kneed the cheese as well.  However, I found that I prefer the texture and firmness of the paneer without either step...  the cheese was less crumbly too!

I use several layers of cheesecloth.  Then I just squeeze as much of the liquid as I possibly can by hand through the cheesecloth.  (Note: use a towel or a large wooden spoon to avoid burning your fingers on the hot liquid).  Then I hang the cheesecloth from the kitchen sink and allow it to drain the remaining liquid and cool.  

After about an hour it's ready!  I take the ball shape and cut slices and then cut the paneer into cubes.  

Since the recipe does make a lot of cheese, I refrigerated the unused portion.  After 5 days I still had some left over... it was tastier than the first day I made it.

The recipe for Paneer is great but as an Indian myself and a great user of paneer I really don't see much point in frying the paneer. A better and a low fat option is to simply chop it and use it without frying. It is just as yum and soft. If the paneer is good quality the longer u cook it the softer it will become.

This is pretty much how I have always made paneer. I never really measured the ingredients though and have always just done it by eye/feel (so to speak). I don't do the food processing part of it though but maybe I will try it sometime...it just seems like too much work. What I do is strain the cheese into a cheese cloth, drain as much water as I can, wrap it tightly into the cloth, set it on a towel, put a towel on top, a pan on top of that and two or three five pound weights dics on top of that. I leave it that way for a few hours. By then it is well pressed, cuts easily, and it more like the firmer kind you get in the shops. Although, if you want a softer variety for stuffing veggies etc... then perhaps following the recipe instructions might be better.

This was a fantastic recipe!!! I put it to the test a little.  Because another reviewer suggested that the frying was not needed, I separated the batch into 2 portions (recipe made a lot of cheese).  I have to admit that the fried paneer tasted much better than the unfried.  I like the lightly browned, crispy edges that help up under curry.  The unfried paneer was also good, but didn't hold as well and lacked the flavor of the fried.  If you are looking to cut back on fat, I guess it would be OK though you probably shouldn't be eating paneer anyway.  My mother in-law is Indian and she had never use this method, though her mother often spoke of using buttermilk instead of lemon juice to curdle milk.  She tried it and switched to this method also.  This will be my standard recipe from now on.  Thanks Ami, for submitting your old family recipe.

Made paneer before, but this recipe is much better than any that i have ever tried.  The buttermilk is different from the lemon juice I usually use but makes a big difference.  .  Let me give it to you straight, you won't know if you are doing it right while making it.  When I first started boiling the milk, I thought I was heading down the wrong road.  I kept going, kept stirring and added the buttermilk.  It was like magic.  I strained it for a few hours, used the food proicessor, and then stored it in plastic wrap until the next day.  I deep fried it instead (have a fry daddy) and it came out great.  This is better than the paneer in the local Indian Restaurant that my family goes to, so much softer.  This recipe is going to save us a ton of money when we are craving good authentic Indian curry with paneer.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe works out very well.  You can also freeze the left over paneer for later use.

I absolutely love making paneer cheese.  The buttermilk is a nice change.  Try adding 2 cups of yogurt or a yogurt/lemon juice mixture to the gallon of milk for a different twist.

I agree with other reviewers -- this is a great recipe. I think you definitely need to smooth the paneer in a food processor first. I also found it key for the paneer to be very cold before the frying process, as it is much easier to handle. I left mine in the fridge overnight and did the frying in batches, keeping other portions in the freezer just before handling. I didn't cut the paneer as the recipe suggests, but rather grabbed a small amount, rolled between my hands into a smooth ball and flattened slightly before placing in pan.

No one has mentioned saving the whey! I like to drink a small amount chilled. (I know, most people think it's gross.) It also makes a fantastic flavorful, healthy base for soups and stews.
Recipe needs a bit of salt in my opinion. I have also added anise seeds and chopped fresh basil for a change. Great crumbled on a salad or veggies like feta.

Excellent. Does need a bit of salt. I pressed it between coffee filters on a rack over night to dry.( I did not knead or use a proccessor)  I cut it into cubes and made veggy and paneer shish kabobs. I grilled these with a brush of olive oil and a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Served on warm pita. Really delicious "grilled cheese"

This is the first time I have tried to make paneer at home, and I was excited that the recipe was so easy. I was a little disappointed at how little cheese I ended up with, though. I saved a cup or so of the liquid, so I tried re-heating it and added a couple of drops of lemon juice and it curdled again! Next time I will make sure I continue to heat the mixture for a while longer after adding the buttermilk, and maybe add a couple little bit of lemon juice to make sure I get as much as possible out of the recipe.

Loved this recipe. I usually make paneer with just milk and lemon juice, but tried this to see if it might be more flavorful. It was. I doubled the recipe, and that worked out great. I also added 2 tsp. salt while cooking, to see how that would taste. That also enhanced the flavor. The only thing is that I wasn't sure the curds and whey were properly separating, so I panicked and added several tsp. of lemon juice and hot water toward the end. No damage done, the cheese turned out beautifully. I never knead or process the cheese. I simply wring it out in the cheesecloth with all my might (running cold water over it to avoid burning my hands) and then I press it between two plates to squeeze out still more water, then I place the plates (sandwiched around the cheesecloth-wrapped cheese) under a heavy cast iron Dutch oven -- filled with water to make the pan heavier -- and leave it there for several hours. I got many compliments on my cheese this time around, which I made for palak paneeer for a large family gathering. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I've been looking for an easy way to make Paneer ever since I learned to cook.  Paneer was the only thing I would eat as a child (I'm South Indian) and I've got fond memories of it.  My aunt told me to bake ricotta cheese and I didn't like the sound of it. . .I was a little apprehensive of this recipe because it looked to easy.  BUT WOW!  It IS that easy!  Actually, it's easier than the recipe indicates - as another reviewer suggested - skip the food processor.  Use cheesecloth in your colander when you go to separate the whey from the water.  Tie the opposing corners together and hang it over the sink for an hour or so.  Once it stops dripping, wrap it up tightly in plastic to help preserve the moisture.  You will need to brown it a little before using, but it tastes good uncooked to.  As other reviewers have said - use WHOLE milk - the fattier the milk, the more whey you'll get.

PERFECTION! This is the best way to make paneer - try this method before using one that uses lemon juice or vineager which alter the natural flavor.  This comes out creamy and delicious.  I added salt the curds and omitted the food processor step.

This did not work out well at all.  The cheese did not maintain its shape when I went to fry it, and I was left with a big, oily cheese pile.  I've fried paneer before, and it was nothing like this.

This was a simple and yummy recipe. It turned out perfectly! It was surprisingly easy, and gave me exactly what I was looking for. I may not fry it next time. I served it with saag, chicken and cauliflower over rice. I will definitely use it again.

Hello, I used fresh homemade buttermillk in this recipe and it would not curdle the milk. I splashed in some white vinegar, which did the trick.

Tried this version with buttermilk for the first time instead of lemon juice.  This is also the first time I have used a food processor.  It was so rich and creamy I was eating it out of the processor!  Can't wait to put it in my palak paneer tomorrow!

This recipe worked, the paneer separated nicely, and I was left with gorgeous green whey, which is what I was really after.  I did fry them, I followed all of the original recipe writer's directions in the comments.  I ended up with gorgeous, squeaky little paneers.  I don't actually like paneer, but if I did, I would like this.  I might personally rather skip the frying and put it in calzones or lasagna like ricotta.  I really like that the whey comes out pure with this recipe.

I might have to try this again.  This was my first attempt at making paneer (I was making the Palak Paneer from this site).  I used 1% milk and low fat buttermilk.  I think that might have been my first mistake.  It just didn't make that much.  I ended up with probably an 8 X 4 inch rectangle 1/2 inch thickness.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge.  It stayed very firm...probably too firm.  Pan frying it was very easy.  I thought it could have used some salt maybe...and the texture was too firm.  I will try again for sure with whole milk next time.   Whole milk update....came out about the same, maybe not quite as dense though

Super easy recipe. Watch the milk mixture closely, the instant it starts boiling it will try to bubble over. I let my paneer drip in cheesecloth for about 20 mins then set it in a wide bottom colander with a heavy pot on top for 20 minutes. I then kneaded in some salt for flavor and pressed it again for 10 minutes to get a flattened brick that was easy to slice.

This is very tasty recipe. I made this paneer and added it to simple gravy and it was talk of the party!! I made some change. After let it drip for 3 hours, I Wrapped it in paper towel and put it under pressure. After couple of hours, I put it in tightly closed container and refirdgerate it overnight. Next day, cut it into cubes, fried for 15-20 seconds and added in a gravy. They were very soft and tasty.

I'm sorry to give a bad review, but I really did not care for this paneer.  Paneer is one of my favourite ingredients to find in any dish, and this version seemed overly granular... the texture just wasn't right.  I followed the tips of the submitter too, so I don't know what it could be.  I'll be buying paneer premade from now on.

This was my first attempt at making paneer. I followed the recipe exactly (but cut the recipe in half since other reviewers said it made so much).
It was easy and the flavor was great. I let the mixture set in the colander for several hours until it stopped dripping, per the recipe. I also used a food processor and the consistency was exactly like firm ricotta cheese. I then refrigerated the paneer overnight.  The next day I cut it into cubes and attempted to fry it.  It crumbled.  I still used it in the Navratan Korma recipe I made though.

This was absolutely the easiest and best recipe I have ever tried.  I have never made paneer, but I could eat it by the pound, and this is just too easy to do.  Thank for such a simple to follow and wonderful recipe.  I can't wait to eat it with my masala - yummy!

I thought this cheese came out very good. At med-high heat in a heavy pan I think was too high, I had to turn down and let my cast iron cool a bit before starting again. This makes A LOT of cheese, I will half it next time. It was very easy and delicious and I will make it again for sure! Note that it takes a VERY LONG time to boil milk at medium heat. I ended up having to turn it up a little which i'll do from the start next time. Thanks, Ami!!

This as my first attempt to make paneer and this recipe made it very easy.  I thought the paneer turned out well.  The recipe I used for saag paneer wasn't so great (it was from a different website) but the paneer was great.

Delicious!  When trying to lightly fry it, pieces stuck to the bottom of the pan.  I baked the rest--brushing lightly with oil and placing on an oiled cookie sheet--and that worked really well.  I think I'll try w/o frying the next time I make Saag Paneer.

This is the most simple cheese recipe I have ever made, I followed instructions and it turned out great, I did not however deep fry the paneer, mine turned out firm enough that I was able to saute it in 1-2 Tbsp of Ghee (clarified butter) as long as I was gentle about turning it.  I will certainly make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've never made paneer before, but this is an excellent recipe even for beginners! It's super easy. I followed one of the tips from a reviewer (squeezing the excess fluid from the cheese) and it turned out great. I didn't even have to chill it overnight. Just stuck it in the fridge for 2 hours and chilled it even more in the freezer for 15 minutes to get it extra firm. Great great recipe!

I never made paneer before but Had tasted it many time. I loved how easy this recipe was. It turned out sooo nice. Instead of making it to pieces and frying I just let it cool and used it in a crumbly feta like version. It was sooooooo good.

This was my first time making cheese, and it was a very exciting process. 
The taste was good, but it was a little crumbly and difficult to cut neatly.
Halved the recipe, used whole milk and the results could easily serve 6. 
The recipe was good, except I think I prefer the tofu-like cheese in restaurants better because they probably are easier to cut and work with.

Overall, very good recipe but it seems to like something compared to traditional paneer. Also, it is very delictae to handle. Next time I will try pressing the milk soilds and get more water out. Will update the review when I try different variations.

I made it as written and I think it could have used a bit of salt to it.  I used pink himalyan salt.  I think  sea salt would be fine.  It absolutely must be kneaded.

I had a bit of issue trying to get the curds.  I saw a tip about white vinegar and it pulled the whey from the curds quickly.  I rinsed the cheese in cold water to get any residual whey and vinegar off.   I had a nice smooth paneer about 6 hours later.   I had tried and almost given up after a few trys with the buttermilk and lemons thing.  Did add a bit of salt though.

Wow!  I had no idea how easy it is to make paneer; I've missed out on so many good meals because of my ignorance.  It is a very simple recipe, but you need a little bit of time, and I usually make a mess of my kitchen during this process - I don't really know how.

Great recipe. Make sure you read the creators comments about not having to kneed it. One issue that I had is that I made the mistake of adding in some liquid when putting it in the food processor. The issue is that the cheese then became sticky. I would try to add little to no liquid back if at all possible since it is is the liquid that makes it sticky. i deep fried the cheese.

This recipe is a bit flawed. It doesn't tell you if you need to keep heating the mixture after adding the buttermilk. I followed the recipe exactly, making sure the milk didn't boil over, yet it still had some surface ripples and lots of steam. I poured in the buttermilk, and got very few curds. By few, I mean a handful. Then, upon realizing I was going to be stuck with a big pot of wasted milk, I Googled 'paneer troubleshooting,' and added the juice of two lemons. That curdled it fast. Other than that, this cheese is in desperate need of salt to give it something.

I used this paneer for another recipe, and while that dish was a bust, it had nothing to do with this one. This was delicious. My ancient food processor wasn't able to combine up the cheese properly, so in the end I wound up dumping the contents into a gallon size zip top bag and just kneading and pummeling until it came together. My only recommendation is to add some salt at this stage - without it, the cheese is a little bland.

This is so easy and fast to make.  I was so excited to make my own paneer, because I LOVE Indian dishes with paneer.  With the paneer that I made from this recipe, I made mattar paneer (using store bought coconut curry sauce) and I was in heaven.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe - my first time making paneer and at first I was worried because it looked super crumbly.  I squeezed all the excess water out I could,  food processed AND turned out the cheese and put something heavy on it for 30 minutes. But after refrigerating it overnight, it firmed up (even though still looked a little crumbly) and was NOT difficult to cut! I used 2% buttermilk because thats all I could find and it worked great.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I cannot believe how easy this was to make. Easy, but SUPER messy. Great taste, like other reviewers said it's a little lighter then the Paneer at most Indian restaurants. I definitely will be making this often!
