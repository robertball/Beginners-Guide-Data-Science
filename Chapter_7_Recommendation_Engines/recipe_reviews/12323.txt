This was so good, I loved the crust.  Since fresh peaches are only available for about a month in my area, I bought frozen sliced peaches, defrosted and well drained in a colander.  Pretty good, but not quite as tender as fresh peaches.  The meringue crust puffed up somewhat while baking so after it cooled, I just piled everything up on top.  Does not come out of the pan cleanly, but who cares?  It's delicious.  One recommendation:  make this to serve enough people to clean it up in one or two sittings, I noticed by the next day the peaches were starting to drain and make the crust a little soggy.

I've made this several times and its fabulous!  A little difficult to serve as the merangue crust is difficult to cut and doesn't hold togther but - believe me - no one will complain.  Maybe even better with fresh strawberries instead of peaches.  Heavenly!

Delicious.  I had a similar recipe that we loved that used cracker crumbs instead of the coconut and almonds.  This recipe blew that one out of the water. Two suggestions:   1st: slightly spray pan with PAM before scooping in the egg mixture. 2nd:  I sprinkled the peached with a bit of cinnamon sugar before adding the whipped cream topping (coolwhip was great) I'm going to make it again but for a larger crowd and will try doubling the recipe and putting it in a 9X13 pan instead.

This didn't turn out very well for me. I wasn't sure how done the meringue was supposed to get, just browned but still creamy like a meringue pie topping or more toward crisp? I assume it is supposed to be more crunchy since that's how it turned out with the 35 minute cooking time. My peaches were not very ripe and I had to sugar them so they were very juicy, that didn't do the meringue much good. I also found the toasted almonds to be too strong a flavor in the crust. All in all, I don't think I got a very good dessert this time around, but it's worth working on and trying again. Maybe I would leave the almonds out next time. And hope for riper peaches.

This was great, easy to make and delicious! I did substitute grated dark chocolate as we're not coconut eaters, and I think that turned out really well. We also used canned peaches (cheaper!). I would cut back on almonds though when I make it again, as it was a little too nutty in texture for my taste. It was a hit, and my husband loved it!

I have been making my mother-in-law's chocolate angel pie for years, and it is one of my best desserts. The crust has no flour in it, because it's a meringue. It is not supposed to have flour in it.

Great recipe!  I had no problem with the crust coming out and it looked beautiful.  However, I forgot my glasses when I went to the store and picked up a pkg of macadamias instead of almonds.  But I sliced them up and toasted them and it was delish! My family asked for another pie tonight so maybe I will try the almonds this time.

This was a nice light fruit pie. The texture of the crust is interesting, chewy in a pleasant sort of way. The flavor of the coconut goes well with peaches. I did feel that the filling lacked something, though. Maybe a little sugar would have helped, although I used ripe peaches.

Light, gluten free dessert. Baked the crust right at 30 min and it turned out nice and lightly browned all over. Took the advice of another reviewer and sprayed my pie plate with coconut oil, so it cut and served perfectly. Do wish I had a deep dish pie plate so the backs of the slices weren't so thick. I used 5 medium-large peaches and wished I used 6 to make it a little peachier. I also roasted the peaches a little bit to caramelize and cooled them before putting them on the crust. It was good, but I feel like fresh peaches would have been just as good. I also put some vanilla and a bit of sugar in my whipped cream (1 cup was not enough to really cover the whole pie, would do more next time or not hand-whip it so I could get it fluffier.)  Will make this again and may try other fruits since it seems pretty versatile. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

Great recipe! A nice change to a standard pie crust and quick to make. It tastes wonderful and is now my family's favorite fruit pie.
