I liked this recipe, although I didn't have lemon flavored yogurt, but used plain instead and added another teaspoon of lemon juice. I'll definitely make this again.

I had fun w/ this recipe! I used part yogurt and part sour cream, as that's what I had in the fridge.  I cut the oil a bit and added more juice (I used bottled lime juice), and I omitted the zest as I had none. The batter is thicker than cake but thinner than cookie, so I put 1/8 C batter in muffin tins lined w/ paper muffin cups, added 1 1/2 tsp cherry jam, than another 1/8 C batter. I baked for 25 min @ 375' and I'm delighted w/ the turnout! I'm sending overseas w/ a can of cherry frosting. Fabulous! Thinking of adding chopped cranberries next time.

These are definitely very cakey and moist, and very ideal for having with a cup of tea or coffee.  After reading what others had to say, I dropped the oil and used butter instead, and I also omitted the lemon juice and opted for 3 t. of lemon extract instead.  I still used the zest, though- there is no sub for that!   Not the best cookie I've ever had, but decent and with potential!

I have not used this recipe as written... After reading all the reviews I made the following changes: Used a touch extra baking soda and powder, added extra lemon extract and juice (probably about double what was written) plus a few Tbsp. rum and a few drops vanilla (I like lots of flavor), 1/4 cup room temp butter and 1&1/2 Tbsp oil, replaced 1/2 cup regular sugar with 3/4 cup powdered sugar, but that exchange was out of necessity, I ran out of sugar! It is a light cakey type cookie, and still could use a few adjustments... But I was looking for a lemony cookie that would still be soft after a week in the mail, and from experience, the cake like cookies are some of the best for that.

These cookies were indeed soft, but their subtle flavor left much to be desired.  I suggest adding an additional teaspoon of lemon extract and maybe some frosting to boost the flavor.

I made these for a tea party and they were all that was left. Too soft, too cake-y and boring flavor. You might as well spoon lemon cake mix onto a cookie sheet and bake. It would be a lot easier and taste just the same. I'm deleting this from my recipe box so I make sure not to make it again.

These are okay...they get too moist after the first day. I'm not a big fan of cake-like cookies and they need a little more flour.

not enough lemon flavor, came out somewhat like pancakes, didn't look like the photo at all. maybe that's my fault!  I plan to add lemon drizzle icing because they are very plain.

easy, great for kids to do, though I'd probably cut 1/2 cup of sugar next time.  Not bursting with flavour, but the kids didn't complain

I made the cookies for a cookie tray. They were good but I don't think I'll make them again. My 9 year old stepdaughter rated them 1 star.

Easy but no flavor. More like lemon biscuits.

these cookies didn't taste very rich or sugary which was nice if you prefer a more subtle flavor
I put icing on top for a sweeter taste

I liked these cookies, but I do prefer a little more flavor.  They are very soft and cakey, but I love that. I don't like crispy cookies. I even put in 1 cup of whole wheat flour and they were still very light and moist!  I do think the lemon taste needs to be intensified, but overall a good cookie!

I have one that's better but if you want to spice this one up, mix equal parts of white sugar and fresh squeezed lemon juice (keep it stirred)  While cookes are still warm, use a pastry brush to put a glaze on each cookie, going over it again.  It forms an awesome  crisp glaze that is out of this world!  My favorite lemon recipe.  Kim Skye
