My DH made these potatoes for dinner the other night and we were very (pleasantly)surprised with how well they turned out!  My DH did make some changes (as suggested by other reviewers); he added all the cheddar cheese called for, but also added two Kraft cheese slices to the mix.  As well, he did not layer the ingredients, but rather just mixed them all together with salt, pepper, cayenne (about 1/2 tsp) and some garlic powder (2 tsp).  Lastly, he added about 1/4 cup of milk to allow for a creamier consistency.  In the end, we thought they were great and we will make again...the only other thing we will change is that we will add a lot more onion (1 medium would be good in my opinion).

We've had this recipe in our family for years. Instead of the shredded cheese, we use Velveeta. It makes a huge difference. It's an excellent, quick side dish.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I added a small amount of milk and used a mixture of Velveta & shredded cheddar cheese.  This was very good and tasted alot like cheesy scalloped potatoes.  Mine were done in 18 minutes.

YUMMY!  I think this is awesome, some people thought bland - I thought perfect!  Even my picky husband and kids adored it.  Yes the cheese did get a little crunchy at the sides, I'll just add it after the 1st 10 min. next time.  I never dreamed anything microwaved could taste so good!!!  I also added a little garlic salt for taste and parsley flakes for looks.  PERFECT!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thankyou for such a great recipe. My husband says he will never eat boxed potatoes again.Fresh ingredients - not dried up potatos in a box. Make sure you slice your potatoes thin - It was so easy and quick to make.I like to make this with a good marinated steak cooked on my George foreman grill. Thanks for sharing

We really liked this recipe. Simple, easy, and flavorful. Just the way we like it. The only differences I did was to cube the potatoes instead of slice them (much easier to stir later), and to sprinke on the cheese after the stir instead of in the beginning, so it was nicely layered on the potatoes. This one will go into regular rotation!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the potatoes didn't turn out well AT ALL!  Some of the potatoes didn't get done all the way through and those that were done tasted very bland.  I don't think I'll try this one again.

These didn't taste like anything but potatoes with cheese melted on top.  I made them because I thought my 8 year old neice would like them.  She wouldn't eat them.  Plus they got super greasy, I won't make again.

This recipe was very average. I had to force my kids to eat it. Would have been better with Velveeta. Cheddar just clumps together leaving many slices of the potatoes without any cheese.

Not great.  Kinda blah.   The version of these where you fry them on the stove, or bake them in the oven... either way, is lots better than microwaving them like this.  Won't be making them this way again, despite the time is saves.

This was so simple and tasty. I typically don't give something 5 stars but on the rating of yummy and easy, I don't see why not. I mixed all the ingredients together, microwaved it for a total of 20 minutes and it was perfect.

This is VERY good for a microwave recipe!!  I did alter the recipe a bit and I didn't measure anything, so I'll just tell you what I put in it.  I cut half of the potatoes that it asked for.  I just layered the cheese, onion powder, and potatoes as I felt fit.  I used about 1/3 c. milk with a couple shakes of Wondra, put the milk mixture in gladware with a lid, shook it up, and poured it all over the potatoes, onion powder, and cheese.  This made it very creamy when it came out.  I used onion powder instead of chopped onions because my husband hates onions.  It turned out perfect and we both loved it.  Great idea!

This recipe is a good substitute recipe when you're in a hurry and can't take the time for an oven-baked potato casserole. I added 2T milk, more onion,  a teaspoon ofgarlic powder and I used Asiago cheese for a little more bite.

This was so easy & yummy!  Will definitely make again. 

I halved this recipe with the exception of adding one small potato.  Not sure how much of a difference it makes but I used red onion and a cheddar/colby cheese.  I also added 1/8 cup milk & a tsp of garlic powder.  I mixed all ingredients together and during the last 10 minutes, I topped it with some more cheese & bacon bits.  It made a nice crunchy & tasty topping.  Even my 5 year old liked it.

This was a little bit greasy but not too bad.  Maybe next time I'll try a low fat cheese, but then again I wonder if it will be as yummy!

instead of microwave i seared the potatoes and onions in a pan with olive oil, then when they got a little brown and the onions were clear i added more water and boiled them until they were a little soft, from there i drained them and put them in a casserole dish and baked them with a whole bag of cheddar cheese at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, they were so yummy!

Very simple and quick.  Velvetta is the best way to go for a creamy texture.  My family really enjoyed them.

Don't try to halve this recipe--I tried it a couple of times, adjusting cooking times, and it still didn't turn out to well.  Not inedible, but not really tasty.

Easy and delicous!  Added 2 T of milk and added the cheese half way through cooking.  Cubed mine; make sure they are same size and stir before adding cheese.  Had a few hard ones, so cooked about 5-6 minutes longer.  Reheated great, too!

I love how easy these are to make.  I slightly altered the recipe by using a can of cheese soup and slightly less cheddar, omitting the butter, and adding a little garlic powder.  Turned out awesome, my guy just loved them and so did I! Will be making this again!

These were good - but not a favorite. I used sliced american cheese to achieve the creamy effect that cheddar doesn't always provide. Also - I added some milk and a dash of garlic powder. Taste was good but it took 30 minutes for all the potatoes to be cooked through (and even then - there was a couple not completely done).  I suggest slicing them thin and then quartering them for even cooking. However - I do LOVE the fact that this was cooking in the microwave while my stove was full of other dinner items! Thanks.

These were great!  I loved that I could cook them in the microwave - very easy! I did change it slightly  by substitutin g a 1/2c sharp cheddar cheese for a 1/2c of the regualr cheddar. And I threw in some sliced fresh mushrooms to boot!  It was a hit!

I didn't peel my potatoes, just sliced them.  My kids weren't real wild about the dish but my husband and I loved it.  It was very easy and much better than anything from a box.

I just made this and it is delicious, I did however pick up 2 suggestions from others, and used cubed Velveeta, and added some Garlic powder, TY so much, will be making this often! Another great tip was to slice Your potatoes quite thin :)

I made a smaller batch and when I microwaved it some of the cheese hardened up and was very tough. If you want to make a smaller batch I recommend adding the cheese near the end

This is a very simple recipe. I love that it is cooked in the microwave because sometimes I run out of space on the stovetop. Delicious.

It turned out OK.  Some potatoes were a little rubbery. I added a little sour cream, milk and cheese whiz to make them more creamy. Kids loved it though! Total time to cook including peeling potatoes - 35 min. not bad.

Did not turn out well for me. My microwave burnt the cheese. I had to hurry and salvage it and through in some velveeta and sour cream. Maybe I missed something.

I made it like the recipe said- was not happy with it.  Definitely needs some adjustments in order to be good.  Edible, but I won't make it like this recipe again.

It came out a little greasy so I use paper towels to soak up the excess grease.  I also used milk instead of butter and also fresh garlic.  My husband and children siad they would like to have it again.

I've made these many times, they're a hit with me but not with my father. My only complaint is that it doesn't matter how much I cook them, reduce the time or such, the cheese always burns.

THESE WERE GOOD, BUT I ADDED SOME STUFF TO THE BASIC RECIPE. I ADDED SOME FAT FREE RANCH DRESSING AND BACON BITS TO MAKE IT SORT OF LIKE POTATOE SKINS. PLUS I CUT BACK ON THE CHEESE A BIT TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT. I LIKE THE FACT YOU CAN MAKE IT IN THE MICRO INSTEAD OF THE OVEN.

I thought these were very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't layer, but stirred everything together.  I also added a pinch of cayenne for a little zing.  The cheese even crusted a little like it would in the oven.  Will definitely keep this recipe for when I need a quick side dish.

We didn't care for this recipe. It ended up just potatoes with globs of cheese stuck to them. We prefer more of a cheese sauce for our cheesy potatoes. We will not be making these again, thanks anyways.

The potatoes came out ok, the onion gave good flavor to them, but they seemed to turn out a little greasy, so I may try low fat cheese next time and see how that works

Easy peasy and very good!  Much like other cheesy potato recipes, but cooked in the microwave.  I read some reviews and opted to go for the creamier sauce, so I added a bit of milk, sour cream, and 2 slices Velveeta cheese to the cheddar cheese.  I also love garlic, so I added dehydrated garlic and onion.  The only work involved was peeling and slicing the potatoes.  It is very, very important to slice thinly--like 1/8" or thinner.  Perfect.

My microwave isn't very strong so cooked extra long.  Added onion powder because I didn't have onions.  Didn't add salt but next time I would add a little.  But with lots of pepper which I did add it wasn't bland. Cut back on the cheese for caloric reasons and cost effectiveness and still delicious.  I'm making this again.

I stirred everything before putting it in the microwave and used a sweet onion instead of a normal one.  The other change I made was to use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar with two tsps of margarine gently spread along the top.  Tasted just like scalloped potatoes.

With hot weather approaching I wanted a potato and  cheese casserole that could be cooked in the microwave.  This recipe is wonderful!  I followed previous suggestions and added 1/4 cup milk, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  I did not add the cheese until midway in the cooking.  Even though I love onions I reduced the amount of onions in the recipe - big mistake as the onions cook down into sweet yumminess.  This recipe is going into my permanent file.

I kinda like to make these types of recipes in the oven. Don't care to much for microwave.

The basis of the recipe is good. However read and used other suggestions to quarter and slice potatoes very thin, only add milk(about 1/4 cup) and potatoes at first and microwave for 10 mins then added onions (I used one medium) and cheese (I also added 2 cups cheese and garlic powder). The seasoning needs to be amped up from the original recipe. Also had to microwave for at least 25 minutes total. Probably could do without the margerine/butter. It was better the next day so this would be a perfect make ahead dish and then just microwave for 10 min to serve.

Delicious and simple! I did make a few changes as other reviewers had suggested. I added 1/4 cup of milk and sour cream. I also did not layer the ingredients, but added the cheese for the second half of the cooking time.

Add a little milk and this is a great recipe.  I usually never like anything cooked in the microwave, but this turned out good.  Don't forget to COVER IT!  Or you will get crunchy cheese.  And when you mix it, don't let the potatoes slices all chunk together or it might not cook through the middle of it.

This was tasty and easy to make. I added a little milk and extra cheese based on other reviews. I'd also suggest cutting the potato slices thin and small to make it easier to mix. I also added some papricka, garlic powder, and since I didn't have an onion on hand, I added onion powder.

I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes. This recipe is really easy and fast to whip up when the kids are hungry for something cheesy.  My picky kids loved this recipe, and so did I.  I loved the ease of the dish most of all.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe has great flavor- but took me FOREVER to cook in microwave. Will make again, but will put potatoes in boiling water for a minute to soften first. I also pureed the onion, because my little ones pick it out. That way I got the great flavor, and they didn't pick it apart! Thanks for a new addition to my dinner menu!

It was a little too greasy for my taste.
Next time I will skip the margarine and a little less cheese.  It was very quick and easy definitely will make again.  Great for those hot days of summer when you do not want to heat up the kitchen with the oven.

It can't get any easier than this!! I didn't layer the items, I just cut them then stirred together with Velveeta and some garlic powder, salt, pepper.  I also used a little milk to make it creamier---just like scalloped potatoes without the wait time!!

This is an incredibly easy and very tasty cheesy potato recipe!  I used garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne for the seasoning.  I also used half velveeta and half cheddar cheese and probably used closer to 2 cups.  I added a little milk like other people suggested.  I am so happy to find this quick recipe for cheesy potatoes!

This is a great tasting dish but i wouldnt make it for company, It doesnt present very well. Also dont let the cheese touch the side of the caserole dish while its in the microwave because it will harden and burn.

These were the easiest potatoes ever.  I cooked them tonight for dinner, and we haven't even eaten yet.  I was tasting to make sure the potatoes were done, and OH my God, what a wonderful flavor.  Who would have thought that so few ingredients could produce such a good flavor.  The only thing I did different was add a little less cheese than called for, because I didn't have enough.  These are great!  IONA.  Can't wait to see more of your recipes.  Thanks again, Rhonda
