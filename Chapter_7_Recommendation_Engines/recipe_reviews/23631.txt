Although I made a few changes...used 3 1/2 lbs. skinless boneless chicken breast halves, homemade chicken based onion soup mix, 11 oz. nectar, 21 dried apricots and cooked it in the crockpot...I think the recipe is wonderful because it provided a good way to use the leftover apricot nectar sitting in the back of the fridge!  Nice flavor.  I served it with rice and peas & onions.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Some suggestions: skin the chicken; add your favorite seasonings (I added a pinch of Ital. seasoning and some cumin).  Definitely double the amt of sauce - it's delicious! Only use 1/2 the amt of onion soup mix.  I will definitely make this again - i'm thinking about using a larger package of assorted chicken pieces next time. Marinate for at least a few hours.  Cook for 2x the amt of time called for in recipe to get meat very tender and get the sauce to a nice reduced consistency.  Add the apricots in for at least the last 1/2 hour so they get a bit mushy with the sauce.

This dish has a nice mix of salty and sweet flavors.  I marinated the chicken for a few hours in the apricot/onion soup mixture and had good results.  FYI: It goes nicely with the recipe for honey roasted red potatoes on this site.

Very easy to prepare and delicious!!!
The onion soup mix and the apricot flavor go very well together, even though the combination may seem strange at first.  If you are an onion fan, I would recommend you add a bit more onion soup mix than apricot nectar.  The apricot flavor is very tangy and will not be drained out by the addition of more onion.
Instead of drained apricot halves, I used an apricot puree.  I also allowed the chicken to marinate for 3 hours, although overnight would probably provide even greater results.
Clever recipe .. clever taste!

I skinned the chicken thighs (bone in), and added soy sauce & sesame seed oil as another reviewer did.  Marinated 3 hours in one pkg of onion soup mix, and two cans of apricot nector (because we use generous amts of sauce when having sticky white rice).  The dish was bland in overall flavour; which was limited to 'the first bite:'  The chicken (meat) itself wasn't very flavourful either.  Next time I try this recipe I'll also add brown sugar/or apricot jam, fresh sliced ginger root, and maybe a bit of chopped garlic to the marinade.  Will use a vacuum food bag sealer to marinate (so marinade is pulled into the meat), instead of marinating in a bowl for a few hours.

Great recipe! An eaiser version would be to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs (more moist), catalina dressing, onion soup mix and one can of apricots in light syrup (drained). Mix everything together and bake for 2 hours (stirring every so often). super tasty and its makes a nice sauce. Great served over rice.

I used 9 skinless chicken thighs, one pack of onion mix and one teaspoon of goya adobo without pepper and two cans of apricot nectar.  Instead of baking, I pressure cooked this combo for 8 minutes and cooled at once.  It came out way more juicier than when I've baked it.  I think next time I will add about a half teaspoon more of adobo to add just a little more salt flavor.  So if you are in a pinch for time and don't have an hour of baking time...pressure cook this baby!

I had some leftover apricot nectar to use up, so that's what led me to this recipe. I used drumsticks and found it to be one of the best chicken dishes I've ever eaten. And it couldn't be much easier. The sauce is wonderful over rice. I will make this for a dinner party with boneless thighs for less mess.

Fantastic 5 min prep meal. Some of the recipes I find on this site say 10 min prep, but that is only true if you already have all the ingredients prepared i.e. chopping is done. In this case 5 min is the truth. Meal is very tasty and fantastic if you're busy.

This chicken didn't have much flavor, I don't know if it needed to marinate or what.  We will try this again with peaches.

This is a great recipe for a potluck or buffet style party.  As others, I made a few minor changes to make it more in line with my style. I salted the chicken, dredged it in flour, and pan fried it in about 2 tbl of oil.  I also added 2 tsp of Red Curry Paste to the oil to add a spicy flare to the chicken. Once the chicken was brown, I moved it to the oven to finish cooking and hold. I made the sauce as directed but doubled the Apricot nectar and simmered. About 30 minutes before serving, I combined the chicken with the sauce and simmered.  You may want to hold off putting the apricot halves into the sauce until this step. My thanks to the original author of this recipe for posting this wonderful recipe. It is very simple and easily accommodating to your own style.

I used chicken breasts and turned out pretty good.Very easy, very tender and juicy, and tasted good. I will definitely keep this very simple recipe. One thing, I could not find the apricot nectar, so I used apricot preserve instead.

This had a nice flavor, but I think it really needs to marinate for a few hours first.  After it was done, I thickened the leftover sauce from the pan with flour and made a sort of of apricot gravy for it.  Over all, a good recipe.

There is really nothing redeeming about this recipe except that it is easy. I think it's better to use fresh onions and herbs than to use onion soup mix. The canned fruit adds nothng. If one must use the canned fruit, at least add some spice to it.

This recipe is very good. I put it in the crockpot as I am a busy mom. I used a can of peaches and placed all of the ingedients in the blender and a little water. yummmy. I let it cook all day and it was wonderful. I served this over rice and had a green salad. even my picky eaters ate this. awesome recipe.

My husband and two year old gave this chicken a thumbs up! Me too. I turned it into a crockpot recipe. I think that took care of the need to marinate. The chicken was moist and flavorful all the way through. I will probably add a few crushed cloves of garlic next time. I used a whole packet of french onion soup. I think it depends on the brand. The one I used had way less sodium then the one sitting next to it on the shelf.

Made this tonight with breasts and preserves instead of nectar. This just didn't trip our trigger the way that the other recipes do that call for salad dressing. Perhaps if you had the liquid from the apricot halves, that would help.

I too used 1/2 the onion soup mix as suggested by others.  but I was still disapointed with the flavor so I added 3 TBS. soy sauce, 1/4 C. light brown sugar, and 1 tsp. sesame oil.  Made for a very nice asian kick... marinated in the frig for 3 hours.  Served with steamed rice

This recipe turned out really good. I skinned the chicken and marinated it in the onion and apricot nectar for a few hours. I also baked the apricot halves for about 15mins to get them abit mushy. Will probably make this again in the near future.

This recipe is easy and tastes great! For those who want a sweeter, distinctive taste, use Apricot preserves, beforehand, rather than fresh apricots at the end. Also, it is more flavorful if you marinade it overnight. I also recommend that you use whatever herbs and seasonings (no salt-the onion soup mix has plenty!) you prefer on any basic chicken dish. The other is just for it's distinctive flavor.

I am an onion fan but this was pretty overpowering.  I also was disapointed that it wasn't sweeter.  I may make it again but I will definatly cut down on the onion soup mix.

This recipe was super easy but disappointing in flavor. The nector sauce was tasty but the chicken did not pick up the flavor. Chicken is very plain. For the chicken to pick up more flavor it might be best to mirinade chicken overnite. Using the dry onion soup mix was too salty. Suggest using fresh onions and seasoning instead of dry onion soup mix. Don't think I would use this recipe again..unless I am short on time.

I didn’t have the apricot pieces but it turned out fine I just wish that the skin would’ve been crispy I probably should’ve taken the skin off. Also use the Catalina dressing

I made this with chicken breasts rather than thighs. Marinated overnight, so the chicken was VERY tender. I couldn't find any onion soup mix without MSG. I added extra onion soup mix per one reviewer's suggestion... My guy really liked the pairing of onion and apricot, but I would have preferred less onion flavor.

I made this recipe last night for my boyfriend.  It was super simple, and I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I made was I used drumsticks instead of thighs.  I served the chicken with steamed bok choy with a drizzle of soy and sesame oil, and some steamed rice.  Next time I'd like to try and marinate the chicken in the nectar, and also cook it for a bit longer.  Will definetly be making this again!

This recipe is pretty good! We have a lot of food allergies in our family, so it's hard to find recipes to fit our needs.  We halved the recipe to feed ourselves & our 15 month old & served it over cooked rice. If you're looking to reduce fat in the recipe, use skinless thighs (or breast - but that is more expensive) &  make sure to cover the dish tightly while it's baking so the chicken doesn't dry out. We substituted dried onion (1/2 t) & salt (1/2 t) for the dry soup mix, as that's often a product that contains allergens for us. We added 1 T blackstrap molasses in place of others' suggestions of soy sauce (again - allergens) to give the flavor a little more depth & also for added nutrition! We also added a clove of minced garlic. We did let the chicken marinate in the sauce for a few hrs b4 baking (& adding the apricots). For those who are curious about nectar - it's conventionally sold as fruit puree mixed w/corn syrup (eew!) & water - however you can buy higher quality nectar that's only fruit puree/juice & water. Thanks for such a simple supper dish!

This recipe has been a stable in my home for years.  I use lovely legs (skinned legs with the knee removed).  I like to add a handful of sliced mushrooms to the cooking process and 1/4 cup roasted almond slithers just as I am serving.  Serve with steamed rice, borccoli and corn - delicious!!

This was a FANTASTIC dish! Three generations of my family loved it. I, too, used about half of the onion mix and marinated the chicken for about 10 hours. Make sure to save the sauce--it tastes wonderful over some plain rice.

I reduced the recipe down to 1 serving, reduced per other's suggestions the amount of onion soup, replaced the onion soup with dried onion and salt, added in a splash of soy sauce and a dash of garlic, marinated it over night, and broiled the chicken.

It turned out very tasty! It's not a show stopper. It is an excellent compliment to a oriental chicken salad.

The onion soup definitely overpowers the Apricot.  I did use a can of apricots with the juice, as I did not have any nectar but don't really think that would make much difference.  I skinned the chicken and suggest, as others have, that the chicken be marinated.  I think half as much onion soup would be sufficient.  I do like how easy this recipe was, but would adjust next time so that the apricot flavor was the primary flavor.
