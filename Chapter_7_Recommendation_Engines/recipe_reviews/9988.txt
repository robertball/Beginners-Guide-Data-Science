This one is a treasure, tried it for the first time tonight, and crunchy and great as is, but am planning to try some variations like adding a bit of ground nuts such as hazelnuts or pecans, almonds, pistachios, or walnuts, etc., or even a bit of finely shredded coconut.  With the ground hazelnuts it could be heaven to sandwich 2 with Nutella in the middle!  Or dipped in chocolate as some others suggested...dusted with cinammon, cocoa powder, what ever seems good to you...all kinds of possibilities to play with!  Some additions may change the consistancy somewhat, will have to experiment to find out, but when I do, I'll report in.  Enjoy!!!

A great and easy recipe. Be careful not to use more than rounded tsp and leave a lot of room (5" or so) on the cookie sheet since they really spread out. This recipe works best when cookie sheet also pre-heated and very lightly greased or sprayed. Can leave on the cookie sheet while you're curling them so others won't harden before you curl. Powdered sugar (after cooling) is a nice touch

Very easy to make. An alternative is to make them double with chocolate as "glue" and serve with ice cream.

Easy to make. Found that 350 for oven temp. worked better, less burning(4-5 min.).   Cookie can be used as cone or wafer for great fillings or just drizzle chocolate over. Wonderful possibilities with this recipe.

Mmmm, these are great!  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  I'd had them once before, but couldn't remember exactly what they were called.  I kept coming up with almond lace cookies, but then I came across this recipe.  BINGO!  Exactly what I was looking for.  These are not only pretty to serve, they're a tasty treat too!

These were great, I added some almod flavor and a bit of ground almond, they wouldn't bend very nice after that but they were still awesome.

These were a hit recently - very pretty and delicate, tastey too!  A bit time-consuming to prepare since you only get five on a cookie sheet at a time, but worth it!

I just baked these cookies a few minutes ago. I just tried one and it was SO DELICIOUS!!! I think I'll take another reviewers advice and eat another with chocolate and ice cream. At first I tought these would just be like normal oatmeal cookies; I was really surprised to see flat, crispy wafers when they came out, but, now that I've tried them, they're even better than oatmeal cookies! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Dang, these are good! Follow the directions carefully and they come together just right, though I have had no luck curling them as suggested. Iâ€™m thinking of dipping them in a little dark chocolate and serving them with ice cream.

Delicious, very buttery.  Daughter and I worked together, forming over or inside small bowls to make bowls out of the cookies, which we had made on the larger side.  Later we served ice cream in them, with peach & raspberry compote on top.  It made a delicious dessert with great presentation.  I have also made these previously using brown sugar, also delicious.

Oh my freaking goodness!

You need to be on the ball with the cook time, as 30 seconds in either direction will make or break the texture/flavor combination, but these things are INSANE!

I gave one to a Swedish colleague and he said they were "just like my mother used to make". That was all the praise this recipe needs.

Not for the novice baker, though, if you intend to curl them.  They're delicious, but need to be handled VERY gently, especially if you're trying to curl/curve them.  I just now made them, and I bake LOTS, and didn't have an easy time with getting them off the prepared pan or getting them curled on to a rolling pin or glass.  If I try them again, I would just let them cool FLAT, and just be cookies, rather than rolled around anything.  And I'm Swedish.

Doubled recipe & added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Used non-stick foil on trays. Cookies VERY oily when cooling. Lined cooling racks with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Tasty & crisp! May try with brown sugar next time to see if they take on a more caramel flavor.

This is a quick simple recipe. I  loved it but I think I may add some vanilla and a dash of cinnamon maybe. I also used half and half. Anyway, yummy!

These sounded too easy, so had to try them.  Taste was very good.  Very fragile!  Would be nice for special occasions dipped in chocolate, sugar or whatever.

That is a very tiny recipe and could use some vanilla or something. Next time I have to double it or more. I remember my mother making them, and there would broom sticks, mop sticks, vacuum cleaner hoses spread out all over the kitchen with cookies draped on all of them and more being baked.

Made a half recipe yesterday evening in case my fiance would not like them.  They were gone by morning!  I curled them and added a creme filling - he loved them with or without the filling.  I will be making these again this week.  Great recipe!

These seemed like they had way too much butter. They oozed oil and were so lacy the edges crumbled. I added more sugar and oats halfway through and those turned out much better.

These are very, very delicate.  I found the flavor to be disappointing.
