I used a flour that is mostly tapioca and potato starch.  I rolled it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper and it worked like a charm! My mom will be so happy to have homemade pie again. Thank you!

Great recipe! My husband really liked it! I'll definitely be making this again! I used it to make a quiche.  I didn't pre-bake the crust,  just poured in the filling and baked according to the recipe instructions.  I did end up having to press the crust into the pie plate.  The texture is nice after it's baked, but it is pretty difficult to roll out. No worries! Pressing it into the pie plate worked fine for me! Thanks for posting,  Buckwheat Queen!

BEST PIE CRUST I EVER MADE. I just needed a lower crust so I cut the recipe in half. I did what the other reviewer said and patted it into the pan and it was impossible to roll it out. It was no extra trouble, and this crust is so good!!

Can you add a temperature and bake time?
I baked at 400degrees F for 5mins and then added a precooked filling. Reduced the temperature to 380dgrees F for 15-20minutes:)

Taste was very good, but it did not roll out very easily. Ended up pressing it into the pie plate.
